Another factor could be when you are in a shop and you are not well attended , the people that work in the shop are doing other things , and cannot help you , so you have to look for the things you want to buy by your own .

Another important change related to the modern technology are the credit cards .
5, 6 UD

10, 10 MT
14, 15 AGV
23, 24 S
29, 31 IJ

Another important thing is that , despite the number and quality of films , there were , from my point of view , not many plays .

Another important thing will be the use of technology .

Another one is that how much money I have to prepare .

Another point is the time when it started , exactly 45 minutes later .

Another point mentioned was the choice of activities .

Another point of view against shopping is a lack of the items that you really want .
1, 4 RN
7, 8 RD
10, 11 UD

Another point that I want to comply about , is the time that the musical was supposed to start ( 19:30 ) but it started at 20:15 , so there was a mayor unsatisfaction about it , but the last and worst thing was that your theatre restaurant was closed because the British health institute considered that your food was unhealthy , and not considering many other points like unsatisfactory service , and uncomfortable seats .

Another problem that bothered me about the show was its late start .

Another problem was that I did n't have any discount , and I was n't alone , we were five persons .
7, 8 RV

Another problem was that the show started 45 minutes late and I had a surprise when I saw that the main character was not played by Danny Brook , who is one of my favourite actors .

Another problem was that the show started forty-five minutes late .

Another problem was the band .

Another problem was the starring male actor : the well known and talented actor , mentioned in the advertisement was replaced with another one , who was really very disappointing and after the performance , I visited the theater restaurant , which was said to be open and available for meals after the show ; but it was closed .

Another reason for swimming is that I 'm good at it because a few years ago I had lessons , where I learn very good swimming .

Another reason that I agree famous people deserve to have a private life is that if journalists followed them all the time , it would result in their death .
5, 5 MC

Another reason why I was disappointed was that you said there would be discount available but there was n't .
13, 13 MD

Another significant technological developement is the creation of electrical appliances .
3, 4 S
6, 7 RN

Another simple example is my mobile telephone ; A few years ago , I had to buy a telephone card and then to find a telephone box to call my parents and to tell them that I would be late for dinner , or other stuff like that .

Another situation in which shopping is not enjoyable , is when you go shopping with a man .
8, 9 UP

Another solution could be working as a barman , the problem is that you go to bed very late , but it 's very exciting because you meet a lot of people and enjoy your night .

Another solution to get a friendlier service is of course to go to another shop .
