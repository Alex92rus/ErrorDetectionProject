Because	c
is	i
good	i
time	c
for	c
camping	c
and	c
the	c
weather	c
is	c
lovely	c
at	c
this	c
time	c
of	c
the	c
year	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
your	c
time	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
visiting	c
there	c
.	c

Also	c
,	c
I	c
belonged	c
to	c
golf	i
club	c
when	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
university	c
in	c
Japan	c
.	c

The	c
group	c
needs	c
to	c
found	i
a	c
good	c
microphone	c
for	c
the	c
concert	c
,	c
because	c
the	c
singer	c
lost	c
his	c
microphone	c
last	c
concert	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
about	c
the	c
weather	c
in	c
the	c
camp	c
area	c
because	c
I	c
do	i
n't	i
know	c
what	c
kinds	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
bring	c
.	c

I	c
find	c
the	c
reasonably-priced	c
ticket	c
excellent	c
,	c
because	c
there	c
is	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
people	c
who	c
went	c
to	c
see	c
only	c
one	c
or	c
two	c
events	c
,	c
and	c
by	c
paying	c
the	c
all	c
events	c
ticket	c
they	c
might	c
see	c
other	c
events	c
and	c
learn	c
about	c
something	c
they	c
did	c
n't	c
expected	i
to	c
find	c
interesting	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	i
despite	c
of	i
your	c
advertisement	c
of	c
the	c
possibility	c
of	c
discounts	c
,	i
when	c
I	c
showed	c
my	c
student	c
identity	c
card	c
to	c
one	c
of	c
your	c
employes	c
she	i
angrily	c
told	c
me	c
that	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
pay	c
the	c
whole	c
prize	i
.	c

Some	c
people	c
when	c
they	c
are	c
in	c
a	c
sadness	c
,	c
they	c
will	c
go	c
shopping	c
to	c
forget	c
every	c
thing	c
and	c
the	c
fact	c
is	c
that	c
every	c
body	c
knows	c
how	c
to	c
shopping	i
.	c

We	c
use	c
different	c
electric	c
kettle	c
.	c

He	c
was	c
very	c
kind	c
to	c
me	c
,	c
we	c
talked	c
many	c
things	c
and	c
after	c
the	c
concert	c
he	c
invited	c
all	c
the	c
team	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
dinner	c
,	c
yes	c
I	c
know	c
what	c
you	c
're	c
thinking	c
,	c
"	c
Dinner	c
and	c
Sting	c
"	c
yes	c
my	c
friend	c
it	c
was	c
the	c
best	c
thing	c
in	c
my	c
life	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
the	c
car	c
parking	c
is	c
not	c
convinent	i
and	c
expensive	c
.	c

Which	c
was	c
very	c
chooking	i
for	c
her	c
mother	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
that	c
you	c
can	c
consider	c
my	c
suggestions	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
that	c
you	c
will	c
find	c
this	c
composition	c
interesting	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
are	c
in	c
a	c
hurry	c
,	c
do	c
n't	c
go	c
shopping	c
!	c

If	c
it	c
is	c
no	c
problem	c
I	c
would	c
rather	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
lab	i
cabin	c
because	c
I	c
do	c
not	c
like	c
much	i
sleeping	c
on	c
the	c
floor	c
,	c
but	c
if	c
you	c
can	i
not	i
put	c
me	c
there	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
fine	c
anywhere	c
.	c

As	c
I	c
have	c
informed	c
you	c
all	c
the	c
fact	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
not	c
worth	c
the	c
money	c
I	c
paid	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
want	c
the	c
refund	c
for	c
£	c
15	c
.	c

Tina	c
,	c
guess	c
WHO	c
was	c
he	c
?	c

We	c
're	i
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
am	c
not	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
golf	c
.	c

How	c
much	c
money	c
do	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
with	c
me	c
for	c
these	c
two	c
weeks	c
and	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
do	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
bring	c
with	c
me	c
?	c

But	c
I	c
always	c
finds	i
it	c
not	c
look	c
nice	c
on	c
me	c
.	c

Fourthly	c
,	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
of	c
it	c
's	i
problems	c
.	c

That	c
was	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
our	c
holiday	c
,	c
and	c
next	c
year	c
for	c
sure	c
we	c
wo	c
n't	i
be	c
going	c
to	c
the	c
see	i
side	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
always	c
dreamed	c
about	c
going	c
camping	c
and	c
staying	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
if	c
someday	c
I	c
forgot	c
the	c
book	c
,	c
with	c
the	c
internet	c
I	c
can	c
find	c
the	c
book	c
inside	i
it	c
,	c
and	c
more	c
information	c
.	c

They	c
stopped	c
me	c
to	c
do	c
the	c
operetion	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
answer	c
"	c
yes	c
"	c
for	c
both	c
questions	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
really	c
surprise	i
to	c
hear	c
that	c
.	c

Then	c
,	c
they	c
really	c
regret	c
it	c
.	c

And	c
it	c
will	c
change	c
our	c
lives	c
,	c
also	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
.	c

Some	c
of	c
them	c
were	c
speaking	c
with	c
her	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
n't	c
this	c
lucky	c
person	c
,	c
but	c
still	c
I	c
'm	c
happy	c
,	c
that	c
I	c
could	c
be	c
thear	i
.	c

The	c
home	c
of	c
the	c
future	c
will	c
be	c
very	c
impersonally	i
and	c
the	c
atmosfear	i
will	c
be	c
cold	c
and	c
very	c
essencial	i
.	c

I	c
'm	i
the	c
teacher	c
of	c
that	c
class	c
.	c

Most	c
of	c
us	c
would	c
agree	c
on	c
that	c
.	c

But	c
it	c
might	c
not	c
be	c
the	c
same	c
everytime	c
.	c

Modern	c
technology	c
has	c
changed	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
very	c
much	c
.	c

Do	c
you	c
suggest	c
me	c
to	c
take	c
cash	c
or	c
can	c
I	c
used	i
my	c
credit	c
card	c
?	c

At	c
home	c
is	c
different	c
,	c
each	c
family	c
has	c
its	c
own	c
rules	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
sure	c
you	c
'll	c
find	c
this	c
book	c
an	c
interesting	c
object	c
of	c
study	c
.	c

After	c
she	c
came	c
home	c
her	c
mother	c
was	c
sitting	c
in	c
front	c
of	c
the	c
TV	c
and	c
looked	c
after	c
the	c
lottery-numbers	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
like	c
if	c
they	c
lose	c
their	c
concience	i
while	c
they	c
are	c
shopping	c
.	c

This	c
time	c
,	c
as	c
Katie	c
,	c
her	c
cousin	c
,	c
had	c
told	c
her	c
their	c
friend	c
Bobby	c
had	c
stolen	c
a	c
great	c
camera	c
,	c
but	c
that	c
this	c
was	c
confidential	c
,	c
Pat	c
reacted	c
violently	c
;	c
why	c
was	c
she	c
told	c
secrets	c
she	c
was	c
unable	c
to	c
keep	c
?	c

What	c
a	c
pity	c
,	c
I	c
thought	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
so	c
excited	c
that	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
believe	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
interesting	c
to	c
invite	c
young	c
compositors	i
to	c
hear	c
news	c
from	c
the	i
classical	c
music	c
.	c

"	c
It	c
sounds	c
nice	c
but	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
believe	c
it	c
"	c
she	c
replied	c
.	c

I	c
wonder	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
tell	c
me	c
about	c
the	c
wheather	i
and	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
bring	c
with	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
'm	i
crayz	i
about	c
tennis	c
and	c
swimming	c
.	i

You	c
should	c
spend	c
more	c
money	c
on	c
buying	c
clothes	c
and	c
food	c
,	c
you	c
will	c
very	c
happy	c
when	c
you	c
buy	c
it	c
,	c
but	c
,	c
when	c
you	c
come	c
back	c
home	c
take	c
out	c
you	c
purse	c
,	c
you	c
must	c
be	c
feel	c
sad	c
,	c
you	c
purse	c
nearly	c
empty	c
,	c
(	c
when	c
you	c
do	c
n't	i
have	c
enough	c
money	c
.	c
)	c

Sara	c
could	c
n't	i
understand	c
the	c
fact	c
,	c
that	c
she	c
did	c
n't	i
do	c
the	c
right	c
thing	c
.	c

And	c
I	c
can	c
continue	c
my	c
list	c
on	c
this	c
way	c
...	c
becouse	i
science	c
never	c
stop	c
on	c
one	c
place	c
.	c

We	c
have	c
n't	c
met	c
each	c
other	c
so	c
long	c
time	c
and	c
I	c
'll	c
tell	c
you	c
more	c
story	c
of	c
this	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
afraid	c
that	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
write	c
you	c
immediatly	i
,	c
but	c
last	c
month	c
I	c
enjoyed	c
helping	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
and	c
so	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
busy	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
assure	c
you	c
that	c
I	c
would	c
do	c
my	c
best	c
to	c
be	c
the	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
winners	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
.	c

Concerning	c
the	c
dates	c
of	c
the	c
stay	c
,	c
I	c
will	c
only	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
come	c
during	c
the	c
first	c
two	c
weeks	c
of	c
July	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
starting	c
a	c
new	c
job	c
on	c
July	c
15th	c
.	c

I	c
like	c
going	c
between	c
colourful	i
shelfs	i
and	c
picking	c
some	c
nice	c
things	c
for	c
dinner	c
or	c
for	c
decorating	c
our	c
house	c
with	c
.	c

As	c
for	c
the	c
"	c
Over	c
The	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
presented	c
by	c
your	c
theatre	c
last	c
night	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
inform	c
you	c
of	c
the	c
following	c
problems	c
.	c

At	c
the	c
end	c
,	c
the	c
theatre	c
resturant	i
was	c
closed	c
for	c
holiday	i
!	i

If	c
I	c
had	c
the	c
possibility	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
never	c
go	c
shopping	c
to	c
the	c
big	c
supermarkets	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
sure	c
all	c
the	c
things	c
which	c
are	c
based	c
on	c
electronic	c
parts	c
will	c
totally	c
change	c
.	c

I	c
went	c
to	c
buy	c
the	c
ticket	c
and	c
as	c
I	c
like	c
to	c
enjoy	c
the	c
show	c
near	c
of	c
the	c
stage	c
I	c
bought	c
a	c
£	c
20	c
tiket	i
but	c
when	c
I	c
asked	c
for	c
the	c
discount	c
they	c
told	c
me	c
"	c
I	c
am	c
sorry	c
but	c
there	c
was	c
an	c
error	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
,	c
It	c
will	c
be	c
impossible	c
to	c
make	c
you	c
a	c
discount	c
"	c
.	c

The	c
show	c
has	c
begun	c
later	c
,	c
much	c
more	i
later	c
than	c
your	c
advertisement	c
writes	i
,	c
at	c
about	c
20:15	c
.	c

I	c
enjoyed	c
the	c
festival	c
pretty	c
much	c
.	c

Except	c
these	c
two	c
things	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
quite	c
good	c
.	c

To	c
begin	c
with	c
on	c
your	c
advertisment	c
you	c
say	c
that	c
Danny	c
Brooks	c
will	c
be	c
starring	c
the	c
show	c
but	c
instead	c
their	i
was	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
which	c
made	c
us	c
very	c
disappointed	c
.	c

While	c
I	c
'll	i
be	i
at	c
the	c
Camp	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
play	c
tennis	c
and	c
swimming	c
.	c

He	c
is	c
funny	c
and	c
easy-going	c
.	c

Recently	c
I	c
visited	c
an	c
arts	c
festival	c
,	c
organized	c
with	c
your	c
help	c
.	c

Even	c
if	c
I	c
worked	c
hard	c
on	c
it	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
surprised	c
of	c
winning	c
just	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
.	c

In	c
these	c
days	c
people	c
prefere	i
shopping	c
at	c
supermarkets	c
than	c
at	c
shops	c
or	c
even	c
shopping	c
areas	c
,	c
because	c
shopping	c
at	c
shop	c
is	c
less	c
enjoyable	c
and	c
you	c
spent	c
the	c
same	c
amount	c
of	c
money	c
.	c

Tennis	c
is	c
just	c
something	c
new	c
that	c
I	c
recently	c
discovered	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
still	c
on	c
a	c
beginner	c
level	c
.	c

For	c
the	c
accommodation	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
can	c
not	c
sleep	c
in	c
tent	c
.	c

Becouse	i
the	c
computer	c
was	c
more	c
interesting	c
than	c
my	c
friends	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
you	c
should	c
refuse	c
my	c
money	c
because	c
the	c
evening	c
and	c
the	c
show	c
were	c
so	c
terrible	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
the	c
only	c
month	c
that	c
I	c
can	c
have	c
my	c
holiday	c
in	c
a	c
year	c
and	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
nice	c
in	c
the	c
summer	c
time	c
.	c

All	c
the	c
best	c
wishes	c
and	c
good	c
luck	c
.	c

There	c
were	c
so	c
many	c
youngsters	c
at	c
the	c
concert	c
,	c
but	c
because	c
I	c
was	c
the	c
youngest	c
in	c
a	c
helping	c
team	c
so	c
I	c
guess	c
that	c
I	c
was	c
the	c
luckiest	c
at	c
that	c
moment	c
.	c

The	c
smokers	c
in	c
the	c
school	c
yard	c
,	c
the	c
buffett	i
and	c
the	c
other	c
pupils	c
,	c
who	c
are	c
sitting	c
in	c
front	c
of	c
their	c
tables	c
writing	c
their	c
homework	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
the	c
students	c
in	c
my	c
class	c
,	c
we	c
have	c
seen	c
an	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
which	c
will	c
be	c
on	c
14th	c
March	c
between	c
10.00	c
to	c
19.00	c
at	c
the	c
Central	c
Exhibition	c
Hall	c
,	c
London	c
.	c

Sara	c
remembered	c
the	i
was	c
golden	c
fish	c
.	c

So	c
we	c
tried	c
to	c
stole	i
adult	c
's	c
panties	c
.	c

Firstly	i
,	c
in	i
your	c
advertisement	c
states	c
:	c
stars	c
and	c
artist	i
from	c
around	c
the	c
world	c
,	c
and	c
this	c
year	c
one	i
only	c
from	c
six	c
countries	c
It	i
would	c
be	c
great	c
if	c
there	c
was	i
more	c
artist	i
not	c
only	c
six	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
been	c
playing	c
the	c
classicial	i
guitar	c
for	c
three	c
years	c
.	c

To	c
continue	c
with	c
the	c
others	i
information	c
you	c
need	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
sleep	c
in	c
tent	i
because	c
of	c
the	c
proximity	c
to	c
the	i
nature	c
.	c

I	c
'm	i
also	c
good	c
at	c
swimming	c
and	c
surfing	c
but	c
I	c
'd	i
like	c
to	c
try	c
sailing	c
.	i

This	i
are	c
too	c
many	c
negatives	i
points	c
for	c
one	c
evening	c
.	c

We	c
had	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
fun	c
during	c
our	c
last	c
holidays	c
and	c
we	c
took	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
pictures	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
the	c
starring	c
that	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
be	c
(	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
)	c
were	c
n't	c
there	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
so	c
enthusiastic	c
about	c
your	c
starring	c
,	c
when	c
I	c
realized	c
was	i
a	c
failure	c
,	c
even	c
though	c
they	c
do	i
good	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
the	c
same	c
.	c

Some	c
people	c
do	c
n't	c
like	c
doing	c
shopping	c
at	c
all	c
and	c
they	c
can	c
well	c
explain	c
to	c
everyone	c
why	c
it	c
is	c
n't	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

There	c
is	c
only	c
one	c
bad	c
fhing	i
,	c
that	c
this	c
festival	c
was	c
too	c
short	c
.	c

Pat	c
my	c
sister	c
and	c
I	c
felt	c
very	c
rensposible	i
.	c

To	c
reply	c
your	c
answer	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
realy	i
an	i
nice	c
experience	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
were	c
supposed	c
to	c
perform	c
in	c
the	c
show	c
but	c
instead	c
of	c
them	c
different	c
actors	c
performed	c
badly	c
.	c

I	c
guess	c
I	c
did	c
n't	i
know	c
that	c
she	c
would	c
have	c
said	c
it	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
want	c
to	c
regret	c
about	c
shopping	c
,	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
make	c
a	c
shopping	c
list	c
firstly	i
before	c
going	c
shopping	c
.	c

We	c
both	c
know	c
this	c
is	c
not	c
true	c
,	c
or	c
shoud	i
n't	c
be	c
.	c

The	c
timer	c
of	c
my	c
radio	c
wakes	c
me	c
up	c
at	c
half	c
past	c
six	c
.	c

As	c
I	c
growed	i
up	c
,	c
T.V	c
was	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
mysteriest	c
things	c
like	c
a	c
telephone	c
and	c
a	c
bus	c
.	c

Because	c
we	c
have	c
a	i
free	c
time	c
on	c
15	c
March	c
afternoon	c
