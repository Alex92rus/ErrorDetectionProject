I	c
went	c
to	c
London	c
for	c
a	c
holiday	c
last	c
week	c
and	c
read	c
the	c
advertisement	c
about	c
'	c
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
'	c
in	c
the	c
hotel	c
which	c
I	c
stayed	c
.	i

I	c
saw	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
were	c
written	c
on	c
the	c
advertisement	c
paper	c
and	c
was	c
very	c
excited	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
really	c
disappointed	c
about	c
it	c
.	c

Because	i
of	i
the	c
reason	i
above	c
,	c
I	c
,	c
indeed	c
,	c
spent	c
awful	i
last	c
night	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
you	c
to	c
refund	c
,	c
otherwise	c
,	c
I	c
will	c
take	c
an	i
action	c
.	c

People	c
will	c
wear	c
this	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
100	c
years	c
later	i
from	c
now	c
.	c

If	c
weather	i
is	c
hot	c
then	c
we	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
to	c
wear	c
under	i
wear	i
because	c
very	c
thin	c
and	c
light	c
clothes	c
will	c
support	c
our	c
bodies	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
T-shirts	c
for	c
women	c
are	i
included	i
bra	i
:	c
easy	c
to	c
take	c
it	c
out	c
when	c
you	c
wash	c
it	c
,	c
is	i
very	c
simple	c
and	c
comfortable	c
.	c

Most	c
important	c
thing	c
is	c
that	c
we	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
to	c
kill	c
the	i
animals	c
only	i
for	c
people	c

To	c
Mr.	c
Robertson	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

In	c
a	c
country	c
like	c
the	c
UK	c
,	c
we	c
are	c
all	c
bound	c
to	c
have	c
houses	c
.	c

They	c
struggle	c
to	c
survive	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
as	c
we	c
approach	c
the	c
future	c
,	c
our	c
homes	c
will	c
start	c
to	c
change	c
.	c

Have	c
you	c
ever	c
thought	c
about	c
how	c
the	c
changes	c
will	c
affect	c
our	c
lives	c
?	c

I	c
doubt	c
it	c
.	c

It	c
may	c
be	c
built	c
out	c
of	c
a	c
stronger	c
substance	c
or	c
a	c
more	c
attractive	c
one	c
,	c
such	c
as	c
glass	c
.	c

Also	c
,	c
due	c
to	c
global	c
warming	c
,	c
sea	c
levels	c
might	c
rise	c
and	c
risk	i
of	c
flooding	c
will	c
also	c
rise	c
.	c

Therefore	c
,	c
houses	c
will	c
be	c
built	c
on	c
high	c
supports	c
.	c

All	c
domestic	c
appliances	c
such	c
as	c
showers	c
,	c
kettles	c
,	c
lights	c
,	c
TV	c
and	c
curtains	c
may	c
be	c
voice	c
activated	c
.	c

It	c
has	c
been	c
a	c
pleasure	c
sharing	c
my	c
thoughts	c
with	c
you	c
.	c

What	c
do	c
you	c
think	c
will	c
happen	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
?	c

Dear	c
Mrs.	c
Jane	i
Clark	c
,	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
this	c
letter	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
giving	c
a	i
possibility	i
to	c
know	c
more	c
about	c
modern	c
art	c
.	c

Then	i
,	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
mark	i
,	i
that	c
concert	i
halls	c
were	c
too	c
small	c
,	c
that	c
is	c
why	c
they	c
were	c
overcrowded	c
during	c
some	c
concerts	c
.	c

May	i
be	i
you	c
should	c
make	i
more	c
next	c
year	c
?	i

You	c
asked	c
,	i
if	c
there	c
are	c
some	c
school	c
rules	c
in	c
my	c
country	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
know	c
,	c
I	c
'm	c
studying	c
at	c
the	i
private	c
Academy	c
,	c
so	c
the	c
rules	c
in	c
my	c
institute	c
are	c
different	c
from	c
the	c
rules	c
in	c
state	c
institutes	c
.	c

The	c
fine	c
for	c
smoking	c
on	c
the	c
Academy	i
is	i
territory	i
is	c
100	c
dollars	c
.	c

You	c
also	c
wanted	c
to	c
know	c
about	c
what	c
I	c
'm	c
allowed	c
or	c
not	c
allowed	c
to	c
do	c
at	c
home	c
.	c

The	c
only	c
rule	c
for	c
me	c
at	c
home	c
is	c
to	c
walk	c
out	i
with	i
my	c
dog	c
three	c
times	c
a	c
day	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
it	c
was	c
interesting	c
for	c
you	c
to	c
know	c
about	c
the	c
rules	c
in	c
my	c
life	c
.	c

I	c
was	i
to	c
Circle	i
Theatre	c
to	c
watch	c
'	i
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
'	c
musical	c
show	c
,	c
recently	c
.	c

My	c
expectations	c
were	c
high	c
after	c
I	i
've	i
read	c
your	c
leaflet	c
in	c
which	c
it	c
was	c
advertised	c
as	c
'	c
London	c
's	c
newest	c
and	c
best	c
musical	c
show	c
'	c
.	c

Now	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
assure	c
you	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
wait	c
fourty-five	i
minutes	c
before	c
the	c
show	c
finally	c
began	c
.	c

Another	c
unkept	c
promise	c
are	i
the	c
discounts	c
.	c

Lastly	c
,	c
when	c
I	c
got	c
hungry	c
after	c
the	c
delay	c
it	c
appeared	c
that	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
is	i
closed	c
.	c

You	c
can	c
believe	c
me	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
'	c
my	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
'	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
no	c
other	c
choice	c
than	c
asking	i
to	i
give	c
my	i
money	c
back	c
.	c

I	c
paid	c
for	c
something	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
get	c
so	c
it	c
is	c
obvious	c
that	c
I	c
want	c
my	c
money	c
back	c

After	c
two	c
days	c
the	i
whole	c
school	c
knew	c

When	c
Paul	c
entered	c
the	c
school	c
gate	c
,	c
other	c
children	c
began	c
to	c
tease	c
him	c
and	c
laugh	c

He	c
ran	c
out	c
quickly	c

leaving	c
everyone	c
behind	c

He	c
felt	c
very	c

and	c
did	c
n't	c
know	c
what	c
to	c
do	c

They	c
were	c
no	c

As	c
he	c
was	c

there	c

he	c
heard	c

turned	c

As	c
I	c
never	c

tidy	c
up	c

where	c
they	c
have	c
to	c

Other	i
thing	c
I	c
had	c
to	c

is	i
keep	c
an	c
eye	c
in	i
the	c
towels	c
,	c
I	c
mean	c
,	c
dried	i

because	c
as	c
you	c
know	c
that	c
country	c
is	c
too	c
hot	c
,	c
especially	c
for	c
my	c
liking	c
,	c
as	i
they	c
have	c
to	c
change	c
the	i
clothes	c

looks	i

;	c
do	c

ask	c

be	c

,	c
I	c
will	c
make	c
a	c
copy	c
for	c

OK	c
?	c

Love	c

I	c
hope	c
that	c
next	c
year	c
's	c
festival	c
will	c
be	c
much	c
more	c
successful	c
that	i
this	c
year	c
's	c

People	c
all	c
have	c
different	c
opinions	c
about	c
books	c
.	c

Above	c
all	c
,	c
realistic	c
stories	c
teach	c
me	c
something	c
of	i
the	i
life	c
,	c
or	c
at	c
least	c
influence	c
me	c
.	c

Here	c
,	c
the	c
fishman	c
is	c
very	c
old	c
,	c
but	c
he	c
is	c
still	c
challenging	c
to	i
everything	c
he	c
faces	c
.	c

When	c
he	c
caught	c
a	c
shark	c
which	c
was	c
bigger	c
than	c
the	c
ship	c
,	c
he	c
never	c
gave	c
up	c
taking	i
it	c
back	c
to	c
his	c
village	c
,	c
even	c
when	c
sharks	c
were	c
around	c
him	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
to	c
that	c
,	c
realistic	c
stories	c
are	c
more	c
attractive	c
,	c
I	c
personally	c
do	c
n't	c
want	c
to	c
hear	c
stories	c
about	c
very	c
peculiar	c
incidents	c
as	c
I	c
know	c
they	c
cannot	c
be	c
true	c
.	c

But	c
,	c
while	c
reading	c
realistic	c
stories	c
,	c
I	c
just	c
fall	c
deep	c
into	c
the	c
story	c
,	c
into	c
the	c
writer	c
's	c
own	c
world	c
.	c

Ernest	c
Hemingway	c
's	c
sentences	c
are	c
precise	c
,	c
but	c
still	c
very	c
powerful	c
and	c
alive	c
.	c

So	c
when	c
I	c
read	c
other	i
sharks	c
eating	c
the	c
shark	c
the	c
old	c
man	c
had	c
caught	c
,	c
I	c
got	c
very	c
angry	c
and	c
annoyed	c
.	c

That	c
's	c
why	c
I	c
prefer	c
realistic	c
stories	c
to	c
unusual	c
ones	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
a	c
musical	c
show	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
disappointing	i
a	i
week	i
holiday	c
for	i
me	i
because	c
I	c
had	c
got	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
problem	i
with	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

The	c
musical	c
should	c
started	i
at	c
19.30	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
20.15	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
asked	i
for	c
the	c
discount	c
of	i
ticket	i
in	i
the	c
cashier	c
desk	c
they	c
told	c
me	c
no	c
discount	c
available	i
for	i
this	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hear	i
a	i
good	c
new	i
.	c

I	c
think	c
somebody	c
will	c
make	i
a	c
very	c
big	c
area	c
to	c
grow	c
plant	i
because	i
they	c
can	c
sell	c
the	c
oxygen	c

Dear	c
Ms	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
reply	c
your	i
letter	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
so	c
glad	i
to	c
win	i
the	c
prize	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
!	c

In	c
answer	c
your	i
questions	c
:	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
.	c

So	c
July	c
is	c
the	c
only	c
time	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
free	c
.	c

Therefore	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
afraid	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
get	c
used	c
to	c
log	c
cabins	c
easily	c
.	c

Besides	c
camping	c
,	c
I	c
also	c
like	c
painting	c
.	c

My	c
Dad	c
is	c
an	c
amateur	c
painter	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
begun	i
painting	c
for	c
8	c
years	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
good	c
at	c
portraits	c
and	c
landscapes	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

It	c
's	c
always	c
a	c
great	c
job	i
to	c
go	c
home	c
with	c
bags	c
of	c
purchases	c
,	c
but	c
is	c
it	c
doing	c
us	c
good	i
apart	c
from	c
the	c
temporary	c
satisfaction	c
?	c

Also	c
supermarket	c
owners	c
have	c
put	i
in	i
a	c
vast	c
amount	c
of	c
money	c
to	c
find	c
out	c
the	c
best	c
way	c
to	c
place	c
goods	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
get	c
the	c
most	c
profit	c
.	c

Therefore	c
,	c
we	c
become	c
impulsive	c
buyers	c
easily	c
under	c
these	i
tricks	c
.	c

The	c
result	c
,	i

than	c

Shopping	c

us	c
mentally	c

also	c
physically	c

I	c

Dear	c

it	i
is	i

but	c
I	c
would	c

to	c
suggest	c
to	i
you	i
something	c
that	c
the	c
students	c
saw	c
in	c
an	c
advertisement	c
.	c

The	c
advertisement	c
that	c
students	i
saw	c
is	c
about	i
a	c
fashion	c
show	c
,	c
but	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
show	c
you	c
will	c
need	c
cancel	i
the	c
tour	c

show	c
,	c
because	c
the	c

is	c
from	c
10.00	c
to	c
19.00	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	i
,	c

Freedom	c
!	c

It	c
is	c
really	c
interesting	c
how	c
people	c
like	c
knowing	i
famous	i
people	i
life	i
.	c

Without	c
someone	c
famous	c
know	i
,	c
photographs	i
take	c
pictures	c
secretly	c
,	c
try	i
to	c
get	c
money	c
on	i
it	i
.	c

Secondly	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
45	c
minutes	c
late	c
.	c

Last	c
week	c
we	c
had	c
another	c
demostration	i
of	c
this	c
.	c

Each	c
of	c
us	c
had	c
a	c
different	c
task	c
.	c

Anna	c
prepared	i
the	c
cake	c
,	c
Peter	c
organized	c
the	c
music	c
,	c
Heather	c
and	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
buy	c
the	c
present	c
;	c
Pat	c
said	c
:	c
"	c
OK	c
I	i
'll	c
phone	c
to	i
some	c
of	c
Ted	c
's	c
friends	c
to	c
invite	c
them	c
"	c
.	c

On	c
Tuesday	c
afternoon	c
we	c
met	c
to	c
prepare	i
the	c
last	c
details	c
;	c
Pat	c
said	c
:	c
"	c
I	c
've	c
just	c
phoned	c
to	i
Tommy	c
,	c
Billy	c
and	c
Alison	c
and	c
I	c
met	c
Ted	c
yesterday	c
evening	c
:	c
they	c
all	c
have	c
said	c
ok	i
for	c
the	c
party..	c
"	c

In	i
that	c
moment	c
she	c
understood	c
that	c
something	c
was	c
wrong	c
!	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
organising	c
good	i
programme	c
,	c
especially	i
like	c
sightseeing	i
from	i
River	i
trip	i
to	i
Greenwich	i
in	c
London	c
for	c
three	c
days	c
.	c

Most	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
It	i
is	c
free	c
for	c
students	c
to	c
enter	c
.	c

We	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
if	c
it	c
is	c
possible	c
to	c
change	c
your	c
programme	c
.	c

We	c
would	c
be	c
grateful	c
if	c
we	c
could	c
go	c
there	c
in	c
the	c
afternoon	c
on	c
14	c
March	c
because	c
we	c
are	c
able	c
to	c
go	c
shopping	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
was	c
twenty	c
years	c
old	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
go	c
to	i
Army	i
.	c

However	c
,	c
instead	c
of	c
going	c
to	i
Army	i
,	c
I	c
was	c
able	c
to	c
apply	c
to	c
Korea	i
Auxiliary	c
Police	c
.	c

One	c
year	c
later	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
working	c
in	c
Kang-nam	c
police	c
station	c
in	c
Seoul	c
.	c

As	c
a	c
result	c
,	c
I	c
could	c
go	c
on	c
vacation	c
.	c

But	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
police-man	i
.	c

Therefore	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
in	c
spite	c
of	c
it	c
being	c
dangerous	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
asked	c
in	c
the	c
letter	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
only	c
on	i
july	i
because	c
I	c
work	c
at	c
the	c
central	c
library	c
and	c
I	c
'm	c
also	c
having	c
English	c
classes	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
will	c
just	c
have	c
holidays	c
on	i
July	c
.	c

Is	c
it	i
suitable	c
for	c
you	c
?	c

As	c
you	c
mentioned	c
about	c
the	c
accomodation	i
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
stay	i
in	c
the	i
tents	i
,	c
because	c
it	c
's	c
more	c
exciting	c
and	c
I	c
really	c
love	c
camping	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
choose	c
sailing	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
facinating	i
with	c
the	c
sea	c
and	c
it	i
's	i
misteries	i
and	c
I	c
also	c
like	c
the	c
watter	i
,	c
the	c
wind	c
in	c
my	c
face	c
...	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
receiving	c
your	c
prompt	c
replay	i
.	c

sincerely	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
some	c
news	c
and	c
to	c
ask	c
a	c
little	c
bit	c
about	c
you	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
unbelivebly	i
!	c
!	c
!	c

Although	c
it	i
was	i
5.000	i
thousand	c
people	c
there	c
,	c
people	c
could	c
walk	c
and	c
dance	c
without	c
any	c
problem	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
very	c
well	c
organised	c
,	i
the	i
shows	i
started	c
in	i
the	i
exactly	c
time	i
and	c
the	c
group	c
were	i
well	i
performed	i
too	c
.	c

However	c
the	i
success	c
of	c
the	c
concert	c
,	c
at	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
show	i
some	c
full	i
gays	i
started	c
a	c
big	c
confusion	i
and	c
some	c
people	c
get	i
hurt	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
some	c
news	c
about	c
you	c
,	i
What	c
have	c
you	c
done	c
?	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
;	i

I	c
have	c
just	c
received	c
your	c
letter	c
which	c
is	i
made	c
me	c
so	c
hapy	i
.	c

I	c
prefer	i
stay	i
in	c
cabin	i
because	c
I	c
have	i
some	c
experience	c
with	i
tents	c
from	i
my	c
childhood	c
and	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
very	i
good	c
experience	c
therefore	i
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
cabin	i
.	c

I	c
will	i
definitly	i
chose	i
Basketball	i
and	c
Swimming	i
wich	i
are	c
the	i
my	c
dream	c
sport	i
.	c

Your	i
sincerely	c

I	c
can	i
not	i
believe	c
how	c
they	c
doing	i
this	c
things	i
every	c
day	c
,	c
even	c
when	c
I	c
need	c
something	c
at	c
home	c
I	c
alway	i
try	c
to	c
find	c
out	i
something	c
to	c
use	c
instead	c
of	i
that	i
things	i
.	c

The	c
queue	i
is	i
not	c
only	i
the	i
problem	i
if	i
you	c
go	c
by	c
car	c
there	c
is	c
parking	i
problem	i
,	c
if	c
you	c
go	c
by	c
bus	c
there	c
is	i
again	i
queue	i
and	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
carry	c
many	i
carry	i
bag	i
carrier	i
bags	i
during	c
the	i
your	c
journey	c
and	c
you	c
wo	c
n't	c
be	i
alway	i
luky	i
to	i
find	c
a	c
seat	c
to	i
seat	i
.	c

If	c
you	c
go	c
shopping	c
for	c
(	i
buy	i
)	i
clothes	c
that	c
is	c
the	c
worse	i
kind	c
of	c
shopping	c
.	c

Some	c
people	c
says	i
"	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
alway	i
enjoyable	c
"	c
but	c
for	c
me	c
definity	i
unenjoyable	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
same	i
rest	i
of	c
my	c
life	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
with	c
reference	c
to	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
I	c
saw	c
last	c
week	c
in	c
your	c
theatre	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
must	c
complain	c
that	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
started	c
almost	c
an	c
hour	c
later	i
and	c
in	c
addition	c
to	c
this	c
anyone	i
did	i
n't	i
excuse	i
.	c

Furthermore	c
I	i
would	c
like	c
to	c
enquire	c
why	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
must	c
say	c
that	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
very	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
get	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

I	c
wish	c
I	c
had	c
know	i
it	c
two	c
days	c
ago	c
...	c

Dora	c
wanted	c
me	c
to	c
come	c
with	c
Pat	c
because	c
she	c
was	c
in	c
love	c
with	c
him	c
.	c

Well	c
,	c
I	c
forgot	c
that	c
it	c
's	c
just	c
a	c
boy	c
!	c

I	c
really	c
regret	c
that	c
I	c
was	c
so	c
foolish	c
.	c

Mr.	i
Manager	c
:	i

Firstly	c
when	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
show	c
it	c
was	c
writing	i
that	c
the	c
starting	i
time	c
was	c
19.30	c
but	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
quarter	c
past	c
eight	c
I	i
had	c
waitted	i
for	c
fourthey	i
five	i
minutes	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
the	c
first	c
time	c
I	c
was	i
going	i
to	i
go	i
to	c
a	c
musical	c
show	c
but	c
I	c
guess	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
the	c
last	c
one	c
too	c
.	c

Anyway	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
I	c
felt	c
hungry	c
so	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
restaurant	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
they	c
were	c
having	c
the	c
inside	c
altered	c
.	c

I	c
just	c
knew	c
I	c
could	i
n't	i
have	c
trusted	c
to	i
her	c
but	c
as	c
I	c
went	c
in	c
the	c
house	c
my	c
dad	c
offered	i
pot	i
to	c
stay	c
for	c
meal	i
I	i
was	c
in	c
a	i
schock	i
thinking	i
why	c
is	c
n't	c
anyone	c
getting	c
angry	c
to	i
me	i
after	i
a	c
while	c
we	c
sat	c
for	i
dinner	c
and	c
Pat	c
just	c
talk	i
my	c
parents	c
that	c
I	c
was	c
smoking	c
and	c
when	c
my	c
family	c
heard	c
they	c
got	c
ever	c
so	c
angry	c
.	c

As	c
my	c
husband	c
is	c
a	c
native	c
and	c
we	c
live	c
in	c
Switzerland	c
,	c
we	c
apreciate	i
to	i
pass	i
a	c
week	c
in	c
London	c
every	c
year	c
.	c

We	c
are	c
keen	c
on	c
theatre	c
and	c
musical	c
show	i
.	c

Your	c
theatre	c
is	c
known	c
to	c
present	i
excellent	c
spectacles	i
.	c

Anyway	c
we	c
had	c
a	c
very	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
.	c

Then	c
the	c
spectacle	i
began	c
45	c
minutes	c
later	c
than	c
mentioned	i
.	c

Last	c
but	c
not	c
least	c
,	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
was	c
replaced	c
by	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
,	c
whose	c
name	c
I	c
probably	c
forgot	c
because	c
of	c
his	c
poor	c
performance	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
soon	i
from	i
you	i
.	c

I	c
was	c
free	c
as	c
the	c
air	c
.	c

The	c
kids	c
were	c
by	i
their	c
grandmother	c
,	c
who	c
take	i
care	c
of	c
them	c
.	c

I	c
drove	c
to	c
Ouchy	c
where	c
I	c
took	i
a	c
drink	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
so	c
hot	c
,	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
go	c
for	c
a	c
swim	c
in	c
tutry	c
,	c
although	c
I	c
had	c
n't	c
any	i
swimming-clothes	i
.	c

I	c
parked	c
the	c
car	c
and	c
went	i
ten	c
minuts	i
.	c

I	c
took	c
my	c
clothes	c
of	i
and	c
swam	c
twenty	i
minutes	c
in	c
the	c
lake	c
.	c

There	c
I	c
called	c
Pat	c
who	c
picked	c
me	c
up	c
.	c

If	c
only	c
Pat	c
could	c
keep	c
secrets	c
!	c

However	c
,	c
we	c
have	c
seen	c
an	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
It	i
would	i
be	i
on	c
the	c
13th	c
of	c
March	c
from	c
10.00	c
to	c
19.00	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
a	c
famous	c
exhibition	c
,	c
where	c
are	i
showed	i
latest	i
fashions	i
,	i
leisure	i
and	i
sports	i
wear	i
,	i
make	i
up	i
and	i
hairstyles	i
.	c

Could	i
it	c
be	c
possible	c
to	c
cancel	c
the	c
museum	c
and	c
the	c
shopping	c
time	i
and	c
to	c
replace	c
them	c
by	i
the	c
London	c
Show	c
?	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
will	c
consider	c
my	c
request	c
.	c

I'am	i
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

My	c
dream	c

I	c
had	c
always	c
wanted	c
to	c
swim	c
in	i
the	i
middle	i
of	i
sharks	c
.	c

My	c
father	c
was	c
a	c
captain	c
on	c
a	c
huge	c
boat	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
child	c
,	c
I	c
used	c
to	c
go	c
with	c
him	c
travelling	c
from	c
harbours	i
to	c
harbours	i
.	c

I	c
grew	c
up	c
through	i
the	i
water	i
world	i
and	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
live	c
whitout	i
it	c
.	c

Since	c
this	c
famous	i
experience	c
,	c
I	c
dreamt	c
every	i
night	i
about	i
that	i
.	c

I	c
went	c
to	c
your	c
show	c
called	c
"	c
Over	c
The	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
really	c
disappointing	i
in	i
many	c
points	i
.	c

How	c
could	c
we	c
appreciate	c
the	c
show	c
properly	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
in	c
your	c
advert	c
you	c
spoke	i
about	i
discounts	c
available	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
the	c
case	c
.	c

Then	c
you	c
offered	i
people	c
to	c
visit	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c

You	c

something	c
impossible	i

I	c
did	c
not	c

a	c
good	c
time	c

I	c

The	c
nightmare	c
started	c
at	i
this	i
time	i
.	c

She	c
could	c
n't	c
keep	c
my	c
secret	c
and	c
everybody	c
knew	c
which	c
boy	c
I	c
was	c
in	c
love	c
with	c
.	c

I	c
looked	c
at	c
her	c
and	c
she	c
became	c
pale	c
and	c
suddently	i
left	c
the	c
class	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
ready	c
to	c
fight	c
but	c
somebody	c
stopped	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
n't	c
go	c
back	c
to	c
the	c
class	c
so	c
I	c
went	c
home	c
.	c

My	c
Mum	c
was	c
at	c
home	c
and	c
I	c
told	c
her	c
all	i
the	i
story	c
.	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
:	c

My	c
name	c
is	c
Julia	c
Sanches	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
on	i
July	c
because	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
on	c
my	c
school	c
vacation	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
would	c
not	c
miss	c
my	c
classes	c
.	c

About	c
the	c
activities	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
do	c
Basketball	c
and	c
Surfing	c
.	c

I	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
beach	c
almost	c
every	c
weekend	c
to	c
improve	c
my	c
surfing	c
-	c
it	c
is	c
the	c
sport	c
I	c
like	c
best	c
-	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
nice	c
oportunity	i
to	c
practice	i
surfing	c
too	c
.	c

There	c
are	c
some	c
things	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
:	i
the	c
tipe	i
(	c
and	c
quantity	c
)	c
of	c
Clothes	c
I	c
will	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
,	c
if	i
it	c
is	c
necessary	c
to	c
take	c
some	c
money	c
and	i
any	c
additional	c
stuff	c
(	c
like	c
raincoates	i
)	c
.	c

Well	c
,	c
that	c
would	i
be	i
all	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
receiving	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

IS	c
EVIL	c
INTERESTING	c
?	c

Although	c
the	c
other	c
people	c
on	i
the	c
story	c
are	c
the	c
good	c
ones	c
and	c
suffer	c
with	i
his	c
domination	c
,	c
they	c
are	c
quite	c
poor	c
and	c
empty	c
,	c
not	c
interesting	c
and	c
not	c
well	c
described	c
,	c
meanwhile	c
Anthony	c
is	c
a	c
very	c
interesting	c
and	c
different	c
person	c
,	c
and	c
all	c
his	c
thoughts	c
are	c
told	c
us	i
by	c
the	c
author	c

I	c
went	c
to	c
your	c
theatre	c
last	c
saturday	i
,	c
about	i
7.	c
p.m.	c
I	c
asked	c
for	c
discounts	c
.	c

But	c
a	c
clerk	c
said	c
that	c
time	i
for	c
discounts	c
had	c
been	i
finished	i
.	c

I	c
was	c
waiting	c
for	c
the	c
show	c
that	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
start	c
at	c
7.30	c
p.m.	c
But	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
8.15	c
.	c

I	c
felt	c
nervous	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
upset	c
and	c
disappointed	c
.	c

After	c
the	c
show	c
ended	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
on	c
the	c
way	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
.	c

What	i
was	i
more	i
,	c
it	c
closed	i
because	c
of	c
refurishing	i
.	c

I	c
enclosed	i
the	c
receipt	i
of	i
theatre	i
.	c

-	c
How	c
has	c
modern	c
technology	c
changed	c
your	c
daily	c
life	c
?	c

At	c
this	c
time	c
,	c
our	c
nation	c
was	c
under	i
a	c
developing	c
country	c
.	c

As	c
I	c
growed	i
up	c
,	c
T.V	c
was	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
mysteriest	i
things	c
like	c
a	c
telephone	c
and	c
a	c
bus	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
university	c
student	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
find	c
out	c
some	c
imformation	i
about	i
my	c
homework	c
.	c

but	c
a	c
computer	c
made	i
me	c
get	i
them	i
from	c
internet	i
.	c

Now	c
I	c
am	c
in	c
England	c
.	c

Third	c
thing	c
is	c
a	i
telephone	c
.	c

It	c
saves	c
time	c
.	c

Whenever	c
I	c
do	c
not	c
know	c
about	c
something	c
,	c
I	c
phone	c
and	i
ask	c
it	i
.	c

But	c
it	c
might	c
be	c
a	c
problem	c
,	c
making	c
me	c
lazy	c
.	c

Now	c
,	c
the	i
world	i
is	i
one	i
end	i
and	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
advantage	c
of	c
modern	c
technology	c
for	c
my	c
future	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
recently	c
been	c
at	i
your	c
musical	c
show	c
at	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
but	c
I	c
'm	c
sorry	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
very	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
in	c
London	c
for	c
a	c
week	c
's	c
holiday	c
and	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
.	c

I	c
saw	c
your	c
musical	c
show	c
advertised	c
in	c
my	c
hotel	c
and	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
buy	c
a	c
ticket	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
still	c
a	c
student	c
and	c
I	c
saw	c
in	c
the	c
advertisment	i
that	c
there	c
were	c
some	c
discounts	c
available	c
.	c

But	c
,	c
at	c
the	i
moment	c
,	c
I	c
thought	c
that	c
these	c
things	c
can	c
happen	c
.	c

When	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
started	c
I	c
had	c
the	c
third	c
bad	c
surprise	c
.	c

At	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
the	c
show	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
hungry	c
and	c
so	c
I	c
had	c
the	c
brilliant	c
to	i
decide	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
but	c
,	c
of	c
course	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
!	c

I	c
'd	c
like	c
not	c
only	c
to	c
reply	i
but	c
also	c
to	c
have	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
because	c
my	c
evening	c
was	c
n't	c
"	c
perfect	c
"	c
as	c
you	c
advertised	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
big	c
disaster	c
.	c

Every	c
aspect	c
of	c
our	c
daily	c
life	c
is	c
influenced	c
by	c
technology	c
.	c

The	c
first	c
thing	c
I	c
do	c
when	c
I	c
arrive	c
in	i
my	c
office	c
is	c
to	c
switch	c
on	c
my	c
computer	c
.	c

To	c
conclude	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
technology	c
has	c
improved	c
many	c
aspects	c
of	c
our	c
daily	c
life	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
concerning	c
the	c
London	c
trip	c
that	c
my	c
English	c
class	c
is	c
going	c
to	c
do	i
in	c
March	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
the	c
good	i
programme	c
that	c
you	c
mack	i
for	c
my	c
class	c
in	c
such	c
a	c
short	c
time	c
.	c

My	c
class	c
think	c
that	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
for	c
them	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
because	c
tuesday	i
is	c
the	c
last	c
day	c
that	c
the	c
show	c
is	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
showed	i
.	c

Thank	c
you	c

In	c
what	c
ways	c
do	c
you	c
think	c
people	c
's	c
homes	c
will	c
be	c
different	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
?	c

What	c
about	c
rooms	c
which	c
can	c
feel	i
your	c
mood	c
and	c
acting	i
after	i
that	c
,	i
if	i
you	c
are	c
tired	c
for	c
example	c
then	c
your	c
stereo	c
might	c
put	c
some	c
relaxing	c
musik	i
on	c
and	c
turn	c
down	c
the	c
light	c
a	c
little	c
bit	c
.	c

The	i
technologi	i
is	c
good	c
as	c
long	c
as	c
it	c
gives	c
people	c
more	c
free	c
time	c
,	c
but	c
what	c
would	c
happened	i
if	c
freetime	i
became	c
your	c
life	c
?	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
the	c
advertisement	c
I	c
got	c
layed	i
emphasis	c
on	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
's	c
starring	c
,	i
but	c
eventually	i
,	c
a	c
disappoint	i
unknown	i
actor	c
played	c
his	c
part	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
wonder	c
whether	c
he	c
had	c
real	c
skills	c
to	i
.	c

To	c
make	c
matters	c
worse	c
,	c
not	c
only	c
was	c
the	c
restaurant	c
closed	c
,	c
without	i
any	i
appearant	i
reason	c
,	c
but	c
also	c
the	c
discounts	c
that	c
were	c
said	c
to	c
be	c
available	c
were	c
not	c
.	c

On	c
top	c
of	c
everything	c
,	c
the	c
performance	c
began	c
forty-five	c
minutes	c
late	c
.	c

Consequently	c
,	c
I	c
ask	c
for	c
money	i
back	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
will	c
not	i
obviously	i
go	c
back	c
in	i
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
.	c

I	c
join	i
my	c
receipt	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

Over	c
the	c
last	c
five	c
years	c
,	c
she	c
had	i
caused	c
many	c
arguments	c
because	c
of	c
unkept	c
secrets	c
,	c
but	c
she	c
could	c
n't	c
help	c
speaking	c
to	c
everybody	c
.	c

This	c
time	c
,	c
as	c
Katie	c
,	c
her	c
cousin	c
,	c
had	c
told	c
her	c
their	i
friend	c
Bobby	c
had	c
stolen	c
a	c
great	c
camera	c
,	c
but	c
that	c
this	c
was	c
confidential	c
,	i
Pat	c
reacted	c
violently	c
;	c
why	c
was	c
she	c
told	c
secrets	c
she	c
was	c
unable	c
to	c
keep	c
?	c

Pat	c
knew	c
there	c
was	c
no	c
solving	c
the	c
problem	c
without	c
the	c
adults	i
'	i
help	i
.	c

Katie	c
and	c
Bobby	c
would	c
be	c
furious	c
,	c
but	c
anyway	c
...	c

We	c
have	c
seen	c
an	c
advertisment	i
for	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
in	c
a	c
newspaper	c
.	c

We	c
think	c
it	c
could	c
be	c
great	i
opportunity	c
for	c
us	c
because	c
we	c
'll	c
see	c
the	c
fashion	c
show	c
might	i
shop	i
for	i
leisure	i
and	i
sports	i
wear	i
and	c
all	c
girls	i
in	c
our	c
class	c
are	c
intrested	i
in	c
new	c
styles	c
in	c
make	i
up	i
and	c
hairdressing	c

Best	c

your	c
students	c

The	c
Home	c
of	c
the	c
Future	c

Our	c
life	c
is	c
changing	c
every	c
day	c

New	c
technological	c
inventions	c
bring	c
us	c
new	c
cars	c
,	c
new	c
planes	c
,	c
new	c
houses	c
.	c

With	c
new	c
computer	c
technology	c
nothing	c
is	c
impossible	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
already	c
predictable	i
,	i
that	c
very	c
soon	c
all	c
house	i
appliances	c
will	c
be	c
voice	i
controlled	i
.	c

Lots	c
of	c
changes	c
could	c
be	i
done	i
in	c
the	c
future	c
,	c
but	c
the	c
main	c
purpose	c
of	c
the	c
house	i
-	c
to	c
keep	i
comfort	c
and	c
safety	c
,	c
to	i
place	c
for	c

feel	c
at	c

-	c
will	c
remain	c

It	c
is	c
a	c
pleasure	c
to	c
write	c
to	c
you	c
and	c
we	c
want	c
to	c
thanks	i
for	i
organising	c
a	c
school	c
trip	c
to	c
London	c
.	c

We	c
have	c
seen	c
the	c
programme	c
list	i
and	c
we	c
all	c
think	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

We	c
will	c
have	c
free	c
time	c
on	c
Wednesday	c
afternoon	c

12-12-00	c

Because	c
there	c
was	c
a	c
man	c
had	i
a	c
serious	c
car	c
accident	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
walking	c
pass	i
him	c
.	c

Nobody	c
had	c
noticed	c
him	c
because	c
it	c
happened	c
at	c
night	c
and	c
the	c
car	c
had	c
actually	c
crashed	c
into	c
the	c
bushes	c
.	c

I	c
have	i
n't	i
got	c
my	c
mobile	c
phone	c
with	c
me	c
And	i
I	c
was	c
half	i
way	i
between	c
my	c
school	c
and	c
home	c
.	c

And	c
checking	i
his	c
body	i
condition	i

After	c
that	c
I	c
turned	c
on	c
the	c
car	i
light	i
in	c
order	c
to	c
tell	i
the	c
passing	c
cars	c
.	c

I	c
ran	c
back	c
home	c
for	c
help	c
.	c

I	c
phoned	c
to	i
police	i
And	i
told	c
the	i
whole	c
story	c
.	c

Where	c
could	c
they	c
be	c
?	c

I	c
was	c
wondering	c
.	c

Oh	c
,	c
sorry	c
they	c
were	c
not	c
in	i
this	c
road	c

they	i
were	c

Saturday	c

17th	c
June	c
,	c
2000	c

I	c
live	c
in	c
France	c
and	c
I	c
recently	c
spent	c
a	c
week	c
's	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
a	c
very	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
.	c

I	c
supposed	i
to	c
see	c
the	c
famous	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
and	c
what	c
a	c
surprise	c
it	c
was	c
not	i
him	c
.	c

Thirdly	c
it	i
said	c
that	i
"	c
discounts	c
available	c
"	c
.	c

So	c
please	c
,	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
fair	c
,	i
that	i
you	c
give	i
my	i
money	c
back	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
clothes	c
will	c
not	c
change	c
so	c
much	c
,	c
because	c
fashion	c
is	c
an	c
eternal	c
cycle	c
.	c

We	c
will	c
find	c
the	c
same	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
with	c
gadgets	c
included	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
:	c
a	c
short	c
very	i
classical	c
inside	i
of	i
it	c
could	c
be	c
included	c
a	c
mobile	c
phone	c
,	c
or	c
we	c
could	c
find	c
too	i
some	i
buttons	i
,	c
to	c
have.	i
.	c

fresh	c
air	c
,	c
why	c
not	c
?	c

Or	c
special	c
flying	c
shoes	c
,	c
and	c
maybe	c
on	i
your	i
watch	i
you	i
would	i
have	i
a	i
screen	i
to	c
watch	c
your	c
favorite	i
soap	c
operas	c
.	c

Everything	c
is	c
possible	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
fun	c
to	c
see	c
this	c
type	c
of	c
gadgets	i
with	i
old	c
clothes	c
,	c
like	c
a	c
dress	c
of	i
the	c
middle-Age	i
.	c

Do	c
not	c
worry	c
about	c
this	c
,	c
it	c
will	c
not	c
happen	c
!	c

Dear	c
Ms	c
Ryan	c
,	c

Please	c
noted	i
that	c
I	c
can	c
only	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
of	c
summer	i
holiday	c
shut	i
down	i
.	c

I	c
think	c
the	c
log	c
cabin	c
is	c
more	c
fun	c
&	c
exciting	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
won	i
a	c
first	c
prize	c
for	c
painting	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
at	c
High	c
School	c
,	c
and	c
won	i
a	c
third	c
prize	i
of	c
playing	c
Golf	c
for	c
a	c
Charity	c
.	c

Could	c
you	c
please	c
tell	c
me	c
for	i
what	c
sort	c
of	c
clothes	c
do	i
I	c
need	c
and	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
to	c
take	c
.	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

Shopping	c
is	c
an	c
ordinary	c
way	i
of	i
life	i
.	c

You	c
might	c
think	c
shopping	c
is	c
enjoyable	c
but	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
think	c
it	c
always	i
enjoyable	c
.	c

You	c
have	c
to	c
try	c
to	c
park	c
your	c
cark	i
first	c
which	i
sometime	i
the	c
space	i
are	c
fulled	i
and	c
after	c
you	c
have	c
parked	c
your	c
car	c
and	c
went	i
in	i
the	c
supermarket	c
the	c
product	c
you	c
wanted	c
have	i
run	c
out	c
so	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
changes	i
your	c
plan	c
for	c
dinner	c
or	c
going	i
to	c
another	c
supermarket	c
to	c
facing	i
a	c
long	c
queue	c
.	c

I	c
mentioned	c
it	c
,	c
but	c
they	c
told	c
me	c
that	c
promotion	i
had	c
ended	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
ago	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
evening	c
I	c
got	c
a	c
flat	c
tire	c
,	c
and	c
because	c
of	c
this	c
I	c
got	c
late	i
to	i
the	i
show	i
,	c
when	c
I	c
got	c
to	c
my	c
place	i
,	c
it	c
was	c
used	i
(	c
it	c
cost	c
a	c
lot	c
)	c
and	c
they	c
took	c
me	c
to	c
the	c
cheapest	c
seats	c
,	c
where	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
see	c
a	c
thing	c
.	c

After	c
waiting	c
a	c
while	c
in	c
this	c
uncomfortable	c
place	i
the	c
show	c
started	c
,	i
I	c
waited	c
45	c
minutes	c
and	c
then	c
the	c
actors	c
appeared	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
find	i
myself	i
that	c
the	c
main	c
one	c
was	c
n't	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
an	c
impostor	c
.	c

Sorry	c
,	c
but	c
all	i
these	i
stuff	i
are	i
not	i
proffesional	i
,	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
going	c
to	c
make	i
a	i
demand	i
exactly	i
because	i
you	i
do	i
n't	i
have	i
that	i
,	c
if	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
give	c
me	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
understand	c
me	c

But	c
there	c
was	c
a	c
little	c
problem	c
and	c
it	c
was	c
that	c
my	c
parent	i
's	i
did	c
n't	c
let	c
me	c
go	c
alone	i
to	i
disco	i
's	i
,	c
so	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
go	c
illegaly	i
,	c
and	c
I	c
decided	c
I	c
would	c
do	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
made	c
her	c
promise	c
she	c
would	c
n't	c
tell	c
anyone	c
my	c
secret	c
.	c

The	c
next	c
morning	c
Pat	c
came	c
to	c
my	c
house	c
,	i
I	c
was	c
sleeping	c
so	c
she	c
talked	c
to	c
my	c
mom	c
and	c
she	c
suddenly	c
asked	c
her	c
:	c
At	c
what	c
time	c
did	c
Catana	c
arrive	c
last	i
night	c
?	c
...	c

All	c
the	c
truth	c
was	c
then	c
told	c
,	c
and	c
now	c
I	c
am	c
grownded	i
for	c
life	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

Then	c
I	c
found	c
out	c
that	c
the	c
discounts	c
are	i
not	c
available	c
but	c
on	c
the	c
notice	c
board	c
,	i
it	c
said	c
that	c
they	c
are	i
available	c
.	c

The	c
evening	c
that	c
I	c
spent	c
there	c
was	c
terrible	c
so	c
please	c
may	c
I	c
have	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

Well	c
,	c
for	c
instance	c
people	c
in	c
Roman	c
times	c
(	c
Roman	c
soldiers	c
)	c
did	c
n't	c
have	c
any	c
sort	c
of	c
transport	c
to	c
move	c
them	c
from	c
one	c
place	c
to	c
another	c
.	c

The	c
only	c
way	c
they	c
could	c
move	c
was	c
their	i
feet	c
.	c

They	c
could	c
walk	c
over	c
4	c
km	c
per	c
day	c
without	c
any	c
breaks	c
.	c

But	c
people	c
in	i
nowadays	c
like	c
me	c
ca	c
n't	c
even	c
walk	c
1	c
km.	c
And	c
also	c
what	c
is	c
the	c
point	c
of	c
walking	c
when	c
you	c
have	c
cars	c
and	c
buses	c
or	c
even	c
bikes	c
.	c

Phones	c
also	c
affected	c
my	c
daily	c
routine	c
.	c

E-mails	c
are	c
also	c
one	c
of	c
my	c
examples	c
.	c

When	c
e-mails	c
did	c
n't	c
exist	c
,	c
I	c
was	i
writing	i
letters	c
and	c
it	c
took	c
longer	c
to	c
get	c
to	c
the	c
person	c
I	c
am	i
writing	c
to	c
but	c
with	c
e-mails	c
,	i
the	c
person	c
could	c
receive	c
my	c
message	c
within	c
few	i
seconds	c
and	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
to	c
count	c
in	i
how	c
many	c
days	c
he	i
will	c
receive	c
it	c

Dear	c
Madam	c
:	c

I	c
prefer	c
my	i
accommodation	i
at	i
Camp	i
in	c
tents	c
because	c
it	c
reminds	c
me	c
my	i
first	c
school	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
have	c
lots	c
of	c
people	c
near	c
me	c
.	c

My	c
father	c
was	c
a	c
great	c
singer	c
and	c
he	c
has	c
been	c
helping	c
me	c
.	c

Painting	c
is	c
my	i
challenge	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
very	c
hard	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

Women	c
love	c
shopping	c
.	c

All	i
weekends	i
I	c
and	c
my	c
boyfriend	c
go	c
to	c
B.H	i
Shopping	c
Center	c
.	c

I	c
bought	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
shoes	c
,	c
clothes	c
and	c
books	c
last	c
week	c
.	c

I	c
tried	c
to	c
buy	c
a	c
handsome	c
suit	c
for	c
him	c
but	c
he	c
shouted	c
and	c
abandoned	c
me	c
with	c
my	c
bags	c
.	c

I	c
took	c
a	c
cab	c
and	c
went	c
to	c
my	c
house	c
.	c

I	c
cried	c
very	i
much	i
because	c
my	c
life	c
is	c
really	c
very	c
stupid	c
.	c

I	c
intend	c
to	c
continue	c
studying	c
and	c
return	c
to	c
work	c
because	c
when	c
our	c
life	c
is	c
empty	c
everything	c
looks	c
ugly	c
and	c
sad	c
.	c

I	c
know	c
in	i
deep	i
of	i
my	i
heart	i
sometimes	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	i
enjoyable	c
.	c

We	c
are	c
different	c
.	c

We	c
need	c
different	c
things	c
than	i
men	c
.	c

I	c
believe	c
him	c
because	c
he	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
man	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
that	c
he	c
forgets	c
my	i
shopping	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
July	c
is	c
the	c
only	c
month	c
I	c
can	c
travel	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
got	c
exams	c
at	c
school	c
and	c
I	c
wo	c
n't	c
finish	c
them	c
until	c
the	c
last	c
day	c
of	c
June	c
.	c

And	c
in	c
August	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
go	c
back	c
to	c
school	c
to	c
do	c
some	c
classes	i
work	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
got	c
a	c
camp	c
to	c
organise	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
what	c
is	c
the	c
weather	c
in	c
USA	i
like	c
and	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
should	c
I	c
wear	c
?	i

I	c
helped	c
the	i
concert	c
which	i
was	c
my	c
favour	i
singer	c
's	c
concert	c
.	c

I	c
helped	c
with	c
the	c
piano	c
part	c
in	c
that	c
concert	c
.	c

But	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
good	c
experience	c
for	c
me	c
because	c
I	c
learnt	c
how	c
to	c
claim	i
down	c
and	c
play	c
well	c
in	c
front	c
of	c
the	c
audience	c
the	i
concert	c
.	c

At	i
last	i
thank	i
you	c
for	c
sharing	c
my	c
experience	c

Best	c

Circle	c

To	c
Mr.	c
Smith	c
,	c
Circle	c
Theater	i
's	c
manager	c

We	c
had	c
preparred	i
quiet	i
a	c
long	c
time	c
ago	c
,	c
this	c
travel	i
to	c
the	c
capital	c
and	c
spared	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
money	c
as	c
well	c
.	c

When	c
we	c
saw	c
your	c
leaflet	c
mentionned	i
"	c
London	c
's	c
newest	c
and	c
best	c
musical	c
show	c
"	c
,	c
we	c
were	c
so	c
enthusiastic	c
and	c
curious	c
that	c
we	c
bought	i
immediately	i
the	c
tickets	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
waiting	i
evening	c
,	c
at	i
the	i
entrance	i
stood	i
people	i
,	i
who	c
were	c
shouting	c
at	c
you	c
because	c
there	c
was	i
n't	i
any	c
discounts	c
available	c
.	c

One	c
thing	c
that	c
you	c
promised	c
on	c
your	c
leaflet	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

What	c
we	c
wear	c
is	c
also	c
influenced	c
by	c
models	c
,	c
medias	i
,	c
or	c
new	c
collection	i
,	c
which	c
come	c
from	c
Paris	c
,	c
London	c
,	c
or	c
New	c
York	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
people	c
will	c
wear	i
no	i
clothes	c
anymore	c
,	c
just	c
being	i
natural	c
,	c
nude	i
and	c
feeling	c
free	c
,	c
like	c
many	c
many	c
years	c
before	c
.	c

Because	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
people	c
need	c
to	c
find	c
again	i
their	i
authenticity	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
some	c
advice	c
about	c
the	c
International	c
Arts	c
festival	i
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
idea	c
to	c
organise	c
this	c
sort	c
of	c
festival	c
because	c
most	c
of	i
people	c
enjoy	c
it	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
about	c
plays	i
and	c
films	c
it	i
will	i
be	i
good	c
if	c
you	c
make	i
more	c
because	c
the	c
children	c
like	c
it	i
.	c

The	c
dance	c
shows	c
was	i
very	i
wonderful	c
like	i
art	c
exhibitions	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

It	c
began	c
when	c
my	c
parent	i
sand	i
I	c
were	c
going	c
to	c
the	c
South	c
of	c
France	c
for	c
holidays	i
.	c

We	c
were	i
going	i
to	c
the	c
toilet	c
and	c
ate	c
something	c
to	i
the	c
snack	c
bar	c
.	c

We	c
called	c
the	c
police	c
but	c
they	c
said	c
us	i
if	i
you	i
did	c
n't	c
close	i
your	i
car	c
we	i
did	i
n't	i
make	i
something	i
.	c

We	c
went	c
to	c
an	i
hotel	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
expensive	c
and	c
uncomfortable	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
the	i
life	c
in	c
France	c
are	i
crasy	i
,	c
this	c
is	c
the	c
tradition	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writting	i
to	c
complain	c
about	i
I	c
am	i
really	c
disappointed	c
your	i
musical	c
show	c
which	i
is	c
"	c
over	i
the	i
rainbow	i
"	c
.	i

on	i
last	c
week	c
.	c

I	c
could	i
compare	i
between	i
the	c
advertising	c
of	c
musical	i
and	c
actual	i
musical	c
show	c
last	c
week	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
the	c
advertising	c
shown	i
us	i
starring	i
,	i
which	i
is	i
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
,	i
however	i
,	c
when	c
I	c
had	i
seem	i
it	c
,	c
starring	i
of	i
musical	i
completely	c
diffarent	i
actors	c
,	i
I	c
really	i
disappointed	c
about	c
it	c

Secondary	i
,	c
the	c
advertising	c
shows	i
as	i
the	c
musical	c
start	i
14.30	i
and	c
19:30	c
,	c
but	c
the	c
musical	c
started	c
20:15	i
,	i
it	i
's	i
45	c
minuts	i
late	c
,	c
and	c
also	c
,	i
I	i
'd	i
asked	i

in	i
the	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
;	c
I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
musical	c
show	i
"	c
Over	c
The	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
,	c
which	c
as	i
organised	i
in	i
your	c
theatre	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
as	c
for	c
the	c
times	c
,	i
instead	c
of	c
19.30	c
it	c
all	i
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
,	c
which	c
involved	i
being	c
stranded	c
in	i
the	c
theatre	c
for	c
such	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
.	c

Added	i
to	i
this	i
,	c
I	c
had	c
brought	c
very	c
little	c
money	c
in	c
the	c
hope	c
that	c
I	c
would	c
get	c
a	c
discount	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
may	c
realize	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
a	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
but	c
a	c
complete	c
disaster	c
.	c

In	c
spite	c
of	c
that	c
,	c
I	c
found	c
it	c
difficult	c
to	c
forgive	c
her	c
as	c
she	c
had	c
hurt	c
my	c
feelings	c
;	c
that	c
's	c
why	c
the	c
only	c
thing	c
I	c
could	c
tell	c
her	c
since	i
we	c
had	c
quarrelled	c
was	c
:	c
"	c
It	c
serves	c
you	c
right	c
,	c
I	c
'll	c
hate	c
you	c
for	c
the	c
rest	c
of	c
your	c

I	c

Dear	c
Ms	c
Ryan	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
only	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
going	c
to	c
work	c
in	c
Aougust	i
to	c
earn	c
money	c
and	c
after	c
(	i
from	c
September	c
to	c
June	c
)	c
I	c
go	c
to	c
university	c
as	c
usual	c
.	c

About	c
accomodation	i
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
rather	c
be	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
than	c
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
because	c
in	c
July	c
the	c
weather	c
is	c
really	c
good	c
and	c
when	c
I	c
am	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
I	c
feel	c
closer	c
of	i
nature	c
.	c

Finally	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
what	c
sort	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
should	c
bring	c
and	c
also	c
if	c
I	c
should	c
bring	c
some	c
money	c
.	c

13th	c
June	c
2000	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

The	c
most	c
exciting	c
thing	c
when	c
you	c
help	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
is	c
that	c
you	c
can	c
meet	c
popstars	c
,	c
and	c
,	c
indeed	c
,	c
I	c
met	c
OUR	c
favourite	c
popstar	c
!	c

But	c
do	c
n't	c
worry	c
,	c
I	c
thought	c
about	c
you	c
and	c
he	c
signed	c
an	c
autograph	c
for	c
you	c
,	i
you	i
will	c
find	c
it	c
with	c
this	c
letter	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
I	c
worked	c
very	c
hard	c
because	c
the	c
concert	c
finished	c
very	c
late	c
and	c
after	c
the	c
concert	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
clean	c
up	c
the	c
room	i
and	c
you	c
ca	c
n't	c
imagine	c
how	c
dirty	c
the	c
fans	c
are	c
!	c

But	c
I	c
could	c
stand	c
up	c
on	c
the	c
scene	i
and	c
talk	c
with	c
the	c
musicians	c
.	c

Looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c

Love	c
,	c
Astrid	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

That	c
show	c
was	c
n't	c
as	i
it	c
supposed	i
to	c
be	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
for	c
that	c
reason	c
that	c
I	c
am	c
writting	i
to	c
you	c
.	c

The	c
second	c
show	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
start	c
at	c
19:30	c
,	c
but	c
to	i
make	i
the	i
matters	i
worse	i
,	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
20.15	c
,	c
so	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
got	i
to	c
the	c
cinema	c
.	c

Apart	i
from	i
that	i
I	c
could	c
n't	c
visit	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
for	c
holidays	i
.	c

On	c
top	c
of	c
everything	c
the	c
tickets	i
did	c
n't	c
offer	c
any	c
discounts	c
,	c
so	c
the	i
last	c
day	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
buy	c
the	i
present	c
for	c
my	c
neighbour	c
.	c

One	c
of	c
the	c
best	c
examples	c
is	c
the	c
car	c
:	c
in	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
cities	c
around	c
the	c
world	c
,	c
cars	c
can	c
be	c
seen	c
in	c
the	c
streets	c
all	c
day	c
long	c
.	c

During	c
the	c
last	c
decade	c
the	c
number	c
of	c
people	c
who	c
has	i
a	i
particular	i
car	c
has	i
increased	i
very	c
fast	i
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
people	c
who	c
has	i
n't	i
any	c
cars	c
,	i
can	c
also	c
be	c
helped	c
by	c
technology	c
:	c
they	c
can	c
use	c
the	c
public	c
transport	c
like	c
the	c
train	c
or	c
the	c
bus	c
,	c
which	c
is	i
also	c
a	i
comfortable	c
form	i
of	c
travelling	c
.	c

But	c
technology	c
can	c
also	c
help	c
you	c
at	c
home	c
if	c
you	c
use	c
modern	c
machines	c
for	i
cleaning	i
your	c
house	c
,	c
clothes	c
or	c
dishes	c
.	c

Apart	c
from	c
that	c
,	c
technology	c
also	c
helps	c
in	c
hospitals	c
.	c

Every	i
time	i
more	i
machines	c
help	i
doctors	c
and	c
nurses	c
with	c
their	c
difficult	c
tascs	i
.	c

In	c
contrast	c
,	c
technology	c
is	c
very	c
bad	c
for	c
the	c
nature	i
:	c
if	c
we	c
use	c
cars	c
we	c
contaminate	c
,	i
and	c
many	c
cars	c
are	c
being	c
used	c
every	c
day	c
!	c

On	c
balance	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
evidently	i
technology	i
has	c
got	c
more	c
advantages	c
than	c
disadvantages	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
sleep	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
done	c
it	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
an	c
experience	c
not	c
to	c
be	c
missed	c
,	c
a	c
very	c
original	c
adventure	c
!	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
do	c
singing	c
and	c
swimming	c
.	c

Concerning	c
swimming	c
,	c
I	c
practise	i
this	c
sport	c
once	c
a	c
week	c
on	i
myself	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
am	c
just	c
an	c
amateur	c
,	c
not	c
a	c
great	c
swimmer	c
!	c

What	c
is	c
the	c
weather	c
like	c
in	c
July	c
?	c

Should	c
I	c
take	c
trainers	c
?	c

Or	c
is	c
it	c
better	c
to	c
take	c
only	c
an	c
international	c
credit	c
card	c
?	c

Streets	i
are	c
crowded	c
and	c
you	c
ca	c
n't	c
walk	c
easily	c
.	c

It	c
can	c
be	c
funny	i
!	c

Finally	c
,	c
shopping	c
can	c
help	c
you	c
to	c
feel	c
happy	c
if	c
you	c
are	c
down	c
in	c
the	c
dumps	c
,	c
if	c
you	c
feel	c
horrible	c
.	c

despite	i
these	i
fact	c
the	c
show	c
began	c
at	c
a	c
quarter	c
to	c
eight	c
.	c

As	c
a	c
result	c
of	c
that	i
I	c
demand	c
to	i
have	i
some	c
of	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

If	c
I	c
say	i
that	c
technology	c
has	c
not	c
changed	c
my	c
life	c
I	c
would	c
be	c
lying	c
.	c

I	c
do	i
n't	i
.	c

Also	c
,	c
if	c
I	c
use	c
the	c
car	c
,	i
in	i
small	c
distances	c
when	c
I	c
can	i
go	c
on	c
foot	c
,	c
I	c
destroy	i
my	c
physical	i
situation	i
.	c

I	c
could	i
not	i
.	c

Althouth	i
with	i
the	c
computer	c
I	c
can	c
contact	c
with	i
my	c
friends	c
and	c
with	c
the	c
television	c
I	c
relax	c
,	c
I	c
could	c
not	c
find	c
another	c
way	c
to	c
relax	c
and	c
contact	c
with	i
others	c
.	c

Technology	c
is	c
very	c
important	c
for	i
my	c
life	c
.	c

MADRID	c

Although	c
we	c
had	c
problems	c
at	c
the	c
entrance	c
with	c
the	c
tickets	c
,	c
we	c
looked	c
forward	c
for	i
that	i
marvellous	c
night	c
.	c

You	c
can	c
imagine	c
how	c
upset	c
we	c
were	c
and	c
we	c
asked	i
you	c
for	c
our	i
reward	i
for	c
the	c
night	c
that	c
we	c
spent	c

or	i
the	c

how	c
we	c
can	c
change	c
our	c
lives	c
only	i
with	i
press	i

look	c

we	c

just	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
your	c
current	c
musical	c
show	c
which	i
I	c
saw	c
last	c
week	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
it	c
began	c
at	c
20:15	c
.	c

Second	c
,	c
instead	c
of	c
being	i
starred	i
by	i
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
the	c
musical	c
was	c
starred	i
by	i
another	c
actor	c
,	c
who	c
I	c
found	c
really	c
disappointing	c
.	c

Although	c
he	c
sung	c
quite	c
well	c
he	c
danced	c
terribly	c
and	c
that	c
spoiled	c
part	c
of	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
,	c
we	c
had	c
planned	c
to	c
have	c
dinner	c
at	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
as	c
it	c
closes	c
every	c
Thursday	c
.	c

Yours	c
Faithfully	c
,	c

I	c
've	c
been	c
able	c
to	c
improve	c
some	c
things	c
that	c
could	i
have	c
annoyed	c
me	c
some	i
time	i
ago	c
,	c
and	c
although	c
they	c
're	c
mainly	c
little	c
changes	c
they	c
make	c
me	c
notice	c
that	c
my	c
life	c
is	c
easier	c
.	c

Nowadays	c
,	c
almost	c
everybody	c
have	i
a	c
microwaves	i
oven	c
,	c
where	c
you	c
put	c
your	c
milk	c
less	i
than	c
two	c
minuts	i
and	c
it	c
is	c
ready	c
to	c
delight	c
your	c
mouth	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
the	c
letter	c
you	c
wrote	c
to	c
me	c
to	c
inform	c
me	c
about	c
the	c
prize	c
I	c
won	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
fun	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
those	c
two	c
weeks	c
,	i
I	c
have	c
never	c
done	c
that	c
before	c
,	c
by	i
my	c
friends	c
told	c
me	c
that	c
I	c
would	c
enjoy	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
not	c
very	c
experienced	c
but	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
I	c
will	c
find	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
beautiful	c
motives	i
in	c
the	c
USA	c
.	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
the	c
card	c
you	c
wrote	c
to	c
me	c
,	i
I	c
hope	c
you	c
enjoyed	c
your	c
holidays	c
.	c

I	c
spent	c
some	c
great	c
days	c
in	c
Vienna	c
where	c
I	c
had	c
the	c
chance	c
to	c
help	c
at	c
the	c
concert	i
of	i
"	i
pearl	i
jam	i
"	i
.	c

There	c
always	i
was	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
security	c
stuff	c
around	c
us	c
to	c
make	c
sure	c
every	i
thing	i
is	i
ok	i
,	c
because	c
there	c
really	c
were	c
thousends	i
of	c
persons	i
.	c

The	c
other	c
thing	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
was	c
to	c
make	c
some	c
sandwiches	c
and	c
drinks	c
just	c
before	c
they	c
returned	c
behind	i
the	i
stage	i
to	c
rest	c
a	c
little	c
bit	c
before	c
they	c
continued	c
playing	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
amazing	c
to	c
be	c
in	c
the	c
same	c
room	c
they	c
were	c
.	i

Edi	c
Vedder	c
even	c
talked	c
to	c
me	c
about	c
their	c
programms	i
!	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
giving	c
me	c
such	c
a	c
good	c
opportunity	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
very	c
pleased	c
and	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
States	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c
,	c
however	c
I	c
'm	c
free	c
only	c
in	c
July	c
.	c

Currently	c
I	c
'm	c
studying	c
in	c
England	c
and	c
the	c
school	c
finishes	c
at	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
June	c
.	c

At	c
the	c
Camp	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
do	c
climbing	c
and	c
golf	c
.	c

I	c
often	c
climbed	c
mountains	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
in	c
high	c
school	c
.	c

Secondly	c
I	i
think	c
the	c
FCE	c
class	c
should	c
be	c
filmed	c
.	c

Most	c
of	c
us	c
(	c
students	c
)	c
came	c
to	c
our	c
school	c
because	c
they	c
wanted	c
to	c
study	c
English	c
,	c
so	c
it	c
should	c
be	c
the	c
important	c
part	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
nextly	i
we	c
can	c
film	c
either	c
the	c
development	c
class	c
or	c
the	c
society	c
class	c
,	c
because	c
in	c
my	c
opinion	c
they	c
are	c
the	c
most	c
interesting	c
classes	c
apart	c
from	c
the	c
FCE	c
class	c
.	c

During	c
my	c
stay	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
your	c
theatre	c
to	c
see	c
a	c
musical	c
show	c
which	i
was	c
OVER	c
THE	c
RAINBOW	c
,	i
however	i
,	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
very	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
.	c

Thirdly	c
it	c
said	c
there	c
were	c
discounts	c
available	c
on	i
the	c
advertisement	c
,	i
however	i
,	c
there	c
was	i
not	c
any	c
at	c
all	c
.	c

Finally	c
it	c
said	c
we	c
could	c
visit	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
colsed	i
because	c
your	i
excuse	i
of	i
being	i
used	i
at	i
that	i
moment	i
.	c

I	c
look	c
forwards	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

"	c
Why	c
did	c
Mr	c
Brown	c
want	c
to	c
kill	c
me	c
?	c
"	c

She	i
said	c
to	c
herself	c
"	i
I	c
am	c
just	c
a	c
servant	c
in	c
this	c
castle	c
,	i
I	c
loves	i
him	c
so	c
much	c
and	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
want	c
anything	c
from	c
him	c
although	c
he	c
is	c
the	c
owner	c
of	c
this	c
castle.	c
"	c

She	c
was	c
so	c
frighten	i
and	c
sad	c
that	c
she	c
had	c
no	c
energry	i
.	c

She	c
fell	c
down	i
onto	c
the	c
floor	c
and	c
wept	c
,	c
while	c
nobody	c
could	c
help	c
her	c
.	c

Dear	c
,	i
Sir/Madam	c

Last	c
week	c
I	c
was	c
on	c
holiday	c
and	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
The	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
to	c
see	c
over	i
the	i
rainbow	i
musical	i
.	c

However	c
,	c
the	c
reading	i
actor	c
was	c
not	c
him	c
!	c

Also	c
the	c
musical	c
did	c
not	c
start	c
on	c
time	c
,	i
it	i
was	c
late	i
thirty	i
minuts	i
.	c

We	c
just	c
sat	c
on	c
the	i
seat	i
and	i
nothing	c
to	c
do	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
too	c
late	c
and	c
we	c
could	c
not	c
have	c
a	i
dinner	c
.	c

Fathermore	i
,	c
discounts	i
was	i
unavailable	i
.	c

It	c
was	c
not	c
marvellous	i
evening	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

Nowadays	c
.	c

For	c
instance	c
,	c
TV	c
,	c
computers	c
,	c
telephone	i
,	c
air-conditionings	i
.	c

I	c
have	c
my	c
own	c
TV	c
in	c
my	c
room	c
and	c
I	c
enjoy	c
watching	c
TV	c
everyday	i
.	c

If	c
I	c
watch	c
TV	c
too	c
much	c
I	c
might	c
not	c
speak	c
to	c
my	c
family	c
often	i
.	c

I	c
think	c
I	c
should	c
cut	c
down	c
watching	i
TV	c
.	c

What	c
about	c
computers	c
?	c

It	i
is	i
very	c
useful	c
too	c
.	c

And	c
I	c
can	c
send	c
e-mail	c
anytime	c
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
.	i

I'am	i
very	c
serpride	i
when	c
I	c
get	i
the	c
letter	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

And	c
you	c
need	c
some	c
imformation	i
from	c
me	c
.	c

About	c
when	c
would	c
I	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
?	c

And	c
I	c
think	c
I	c
love	i
togo	i
on	i
July	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
will	c
choose	c
two	c
activities	c
that	c
I	c
good	i
at	c
and	c
not	c
good	c
at	c
.	c

The	c
first	c
one	c
is	c
the	c
one	c
that	c
I	c
good	i
at	c
is	i
Basketball	c
.	c

I	c
love	i
to	c
try	c
surfing	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
very	c
interessting	i
sport	c
and	c
use	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
power	c
and	c
enigy	i
so	c
now	c
is	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
the	c
letter	c
.	c

And	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
know	c
more	c
about	c
the	c
money	i
can	i
you	c
give	c
me	c
more	c
imformation	i
about	c
the	c
money	c
that	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
bring	c
whith	i
me	c

Frank	c
Steven	c
.	c

Now	c
let	c
's	c
start	c
whith	i
shopping	c
at	c
Beverley	i
Center	i
.	c

Beverley	i
Center	i
area	c
is	c
the	c
place	c
that	c
the	c
teenager	i
like	c
to	c
go	c
shopping	c
the	i
most	c
.	c

But	c
some	c
teenager	i
like	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
Bolton-Market	i
.	c

It	i
's	i
make	i
you	c
feel	c
want	i
to	c
go	c
home	c
.	c

And	c
that	c
's	c
why	c
some	i
time	i
shopping	c
is	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

Because	c
the	i
place	c
and	c
people	c

Dear	c
Mrs.	c
Brown	c

I	c
want	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
to	c
come	c
to	c
our	c
party	c
and	c
also	c
to	c
help	c
us	c
about	i
what	c
present	c
shall	i
we	i
buy	c
for	c
Mr.	c
Brown	c
.	c

Some	c
of	c
the	c
children	c
will	c
bring	c
food	c
and	c
also	c
there	c
would	i
be	c
nice	c
music	c
too	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
a	c
good	c
present	c
could	c
be	c
a	c
CD	c
or	c
a	c
book	c
.	c

What	c
do	c
you	c
think	c
?	c

We	c
hope	c
to	c
see	c
you	c
at	c
the	c
party	c
and	c
have	c
a	c
wonderfull	i
time	c
together	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
most	c
of	i
the	i
people	c
love	c
summer	c
,	c
especially	c
the	c
people	c
in	c
Greece	c
.	c

I	c
dont	i
know	c
why	c
but	c
the	c
summer	c
it	i
is	c
the	c
most	c
beautiful	c
season	c
.	c

I	c
believe	c
that	c
the	c
summer	c
is	c
a	c
season	c
for	c
everybody	c
who	c
wants	c
to	c
have	c
wonderful	i
time	c
and	c
wonderful	c
memories	c
wherever	c
the	i
go	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
musical	c
show	i
,	c
OVER	c
THE	c
RAINBOW	c
,	c
and	c
also	c
about	c
the	c
servic	i
.	c

So	c
I	c
am	c
sure	c
that	c
you	c
will	c
understand	c
why	c
I	c
feel	c
so	c
frustrated	c
and	c
disappointed	c
about	c
the	c
whole	c
thing	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
farward	i
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
in	c
the	c
very	c
near	c
future	c
,	c
to	c
offer	c
me	c
the	i
money	c
back	c
.	c

"	c
Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets.	c
"	c

After	c
that	c
a	c
being	c
climed	i
out	c
from	i
the	c
potato	c
.	c

I	c
went	c
back	c
to	c
my	c
chair	c
and	c
when	c
I	c
looked	c
up	c
I	c
saw	c
my	c
main-teacher	i
walking	c
through	c
the	c
door	c
with	c
the	c
being	c
after	i
him	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
also	c
writing	c
to	c
ask	c
for	c
your	c
permission	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
show	c
,	c
which	c
would	i
be	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
14	c
March	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
add	c
that	c
it	c
could	i
be	i
definetely	i
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
because	c
the	c
tickets	c
will	c
be	c
free	c
for	c
students	c
.	c

Many	c
thanks	c
in	c
advance	c
for	c
your	c
cooperation	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
foward	i
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
in	c
the	c
near	c
future	c
.	c

Yours	c
Sincerely	c

My	c
husband	c
and	c
I	c
were	c
sitting	c
on	c
our	c
bed	c
.	c

As	c
a	c
postman	c
,	c
Peter	c
,	i
had	c
to	c
deliver	c
letters	c
aroud	i
our	c
little	c
village	c
.	c

He	c
knew	c
everybody	c
,	c
especially	i
Mrs	c
Rilke	c
,	c
an	c
elderly	c
,	c
eagle-eyed	c
teacher	i
in	i
retirement	i
,	c
who	c
lived	c
in	c
a	i
old	c
cottage	c
with	c
her	c
five	c
bad-tempered	c
dogs	c
.	c

After	c
I	c
had	c
opened	c
her	c
gate	c
,	c
she	c
called	c
loudly	c
her	i
five	c
,	c
horrible	c
dogs	c
.	c

I	c
realised	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
run	c
away	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
had	i
still	i
her	c
letter	c
.	c

Suddenly	c
I	c
made	c
up	c
my	c
mind	c
,	c
and	c
running	c
as	c
fast	c
as	c
a	c
champion	c
horse	c
I	c
reached	c
her	c
hands	c
and	c
left	c
the	c
letter	c
,	c
then	c
I	c
went	c
away	c
quickly	c
and	c
,	c
fortunately	c
,	c
just	i
in	c
time	c
to	c
close	c
the	c
gate	c
between	c
me	c
and	c
the	c
dogs	c
!	c

Lately	i
,	c
I	c
had	c
the	c
oportunity	i
to	c
go	c
to	c
yours	i
Circle	c
Theatre	c
event	c
.	c

Unfortunatly	i
I	c
never	c
thought	c
it	c
could	c
be	c
so	c
dissapointing	i
.	c

The	c
first	c
problem	c
happened	c
at	c
the	c
box	c
office	c
because	c
there	c
were	c
abosolutly	i
no	c
discounts	c
available	c
.	c

Well	c
,	c
I	c
bought	c
a	c
the	i
ticket	c
anyway	c
.	c

The	c
show	c
supposed	i
to	c
start	c
at	c
19:30	c
but	c
it	c
actually	c
started	c
forty	i
five	i
minutes	c
after	i
it	i
.	c

When	c
the	c
show	c
began	c
had	i
my	c
biggest	c
disappoint	i
,	c
instead	c
of	c
the	c
great	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
there	c
were	i
another	c
actor	c
,	c
totally	c
unknown	c
.	c

From	i
my	i
surprise	i
,	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

And	c
it	c
is	c
responsable	i
for	c
many	c
changes	c
in	c
my	c
life	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
I	c
would	c
n't	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
live	c
without	c
it	c
anymore	c
.	c

But	c
for	c
me	c
,	c
the	c
best	c
thing	c
is	c
definatly	i
the	c
microwaver	i
.	c

And	c
there	c
is	c
a	i
quite	i
good	c
reason	c
for	c
it	i
.	c

There	c
are	c
some	c
of	c
the	c
modern	i
techonologys	i
that	c
most	c
help	c
me	c
but	c
there	c
are	c
some	c
others	c
which	c
are	c
also	c
very	c
important	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

Dear	c
Ms.	c
Ryan	c
,	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
the	c
kind	c
letter	c
you	c
have	c
sent	c
me	c
.	c

It	c
would	c
also	c
be	c
a	c
chance	c
to	c
try	c
it	c
out	c
for	c
the	c
first	c
time	c
in	c
my	c
life	c
.	c

I	c
take	c
painting	c
as	c
my	c
hobby	c
as	c
well	c
,	c
even	c
though	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
took	i
proper	c
lessons	c
.	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

Hi	c
!	c

Two	c
hours	c
before	c
the	c
concert	c
began	c
,	c
I	c
arrived	c
at	c
the	c
hall	c
.	c

and	c
I	c
was	c
having	c
a	i
time	c
of	c
my	c
life	c
!	c

I	c
handed	c
out	c
refreshment	c
to	c
the	c
pop	c
group	c
's	c
members	c
during	c
breaks	c
-	c
my	c
friends	c
were	c
so	c
jealous	c
of	c
me	c
!	c

At	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
the	c
concert	c
,	c
when	c
it	c
was	c
after	c
midnight	c
and	c
everyone	c
had	c
alread	i
left	c
,	c
the	c
group	c
came	c
up	c
to	c
each	c
of	c
us	c
(	c
who	c
helped	c
out	c
)	c
and	c
thanked	c
us	c
personally	c
!	c

We	c
shook	c
hands	c
and	c
they	c
even	c
wrote	c
(	c
scribbled	c
?	c
)	c
their	c
signatures	c
on	c
my	c
T-shirt	c
!	c

I	c
guess	c
this	c
was	c
the	c
best	c
part	c
of	c
the	c
night	c
!	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
with	c
regards	c
to	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
'	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
'	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
going	c
to	c
complaining	i
about	c
it	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
it	c
did	c
n't	c
start	c
at	c
seven	c
thirty	c
.	c

I	c
should	c
not	c
have	c
gone	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
musical	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
not	c
want	c
to	c
think	c
you	c
told	c
a	c
lie	c
but	c
I	c
felt	c
to	i
waste	i
my	c
time	c
and	c
money	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	i
refund	c
all	c
the	c
money	c
and	c
I	c
recommend	c
to	i
thinking	c
about	c
the	c
advertisement	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
understand	c
me	c
and	c
the	c
show	c
is	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
succeeded	i
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
time	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
happy	c
at	c
that	c
time	c
and	c
I	c
met	c
with	i
him	c
almost	c
every	c
day	c
.	c

I	c
believed	c
that	c
I	c
get	i
married	c
to	c
him	c
although	i
my	c
happiness	c
did	c
n't	c
last	c
.	c

One	c
day	c
,	c
Pat	c
gave	c
me	c
a	c
ring	c
and	c
she	c
told	c
me	c
that	c
my	c
best	c
friend	c
was	c
going	c
out	c
with	c
my	c
boyfriend	c
in	c
secret	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
n't	c
believe	c
her	c
because	c
my	c
best	c
friend	c
was	c
a	c
boy	c
!	c

I	c
tried	c
to	c
avoid	c
thinking	c
about	c
it	c
but	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
true	c
!	c

If	c
I	c
did	i
n't	i
hear	i
from	i
Pat	i
anything	i
,	c
I	c
could	c
have	c
got	c
married	c
him	i
.	c

I	c
could	c
n't	c
do	c
anything	c
and	c
two	c
month	i
later	c
,	c
my	c
boyfriend	c
got	c
married	c
to	c
my	c
best	c
friend	c
.	c

I	c
felt	c
sad	c
and	c
miserable	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
been	c
sailing	c
in	c
the	c
Mediterennean	c
for	c
eight	c
years	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
playing	c
tennis	c
for	c
four	c
years	c
so	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
choose	c
sailing	c
and	c
tennis	c
activities	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
the	i
sort	c
of	c
the	i
clothes	c
I	c
am	c
supposed	c
bring	c
.	c

I	c
know	c
that	c
I	c
will	c
need	c
sports	c
equipment	c
such	c
as	c
;	i
tennis	c
shoes	c
,	c
a	c
few	c
sport	i
shirts	c
and	c
shorts	c
.	c

Also	c
deck	c
shoes	c
and	c
a	c
waterproof	c
jacket	c
for	c
sailing	c
;	i
but	c
besides	c
that	c
will	i
I	c
need	c
any	i
thing	i
else	c
?	c

Yours	c
Sincerely	i

I	c
heard	c
they	c
were	c
looking	c
for	c
volunteers	c
to	c
help	c
at	c
the	c
pop	c
concert	c
.	c

I	c
,	c
ofcourse	i
jumped	i
into	i
it	c
.	c

The	c
idea	c
of	c
meeting	c
a	c
worldwide	i
known	i
pop	i
singer	i
;	i
just	c
made	c
my	c
heart	c
punch	c
my	c
ribcage	c
.	c

Then	c
we	c
,	i
were	c
told	c
go	c
to	i
the	i
back	i
stage	i
and	c
make	c
sure	c
everything	c
was	c
perfect	c
.	c

After	c
a	c
fantastic	c
concert	c
I	i
actually	c
had	c
the	c
chance	c
to	c
meet	c
Britney	c
Spears	c
.	c

Take	c
here	i
!	c

At	i
last	i
would	c
you	c
tell	c
us	c
which	c
is	c
the	c
best	c
present	c
for	c
him	c
a	i
compact	c
disk	c
or	c
a	c
book	c
.	i

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
receiving	c
your	c
answer	c
and	c
do	c
n't	c
forget	c
that	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
surprice	i
birthday	c
party	c
.	c

Parents	c
play	c
with	c
children	i
and	c
have	c
fun	c
.	c

And	c
the	c
difference	c
in	i
that	c
children	i
is	i
effectivily	i
when	c
they	c
grown	i
up	c
and	c
want	c
to	c
make	i
a	c
family	c
they	i
do	c
the	c
same	c
with	i
their	c
parents	c
and	c
make	i
a	c
happy	c
family	c
.	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
family	i
life	c
is	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
think	i
for	c
childrens	i
phycological	i
wold	i
which	c
help	i
them	c
in	c
their	c
education	c
,	c
job	c
and	c
their	c
married	i
in	c
future	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
because	c
I	c
received	c
your	c
letter	c
saying	c
that	c
I	c
won	c
first	c
prize	c
,	c
a	c
two	c
week	c
holiday	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
in	c
U.S.A	i
,	c
and	c
that	c
you	c
need	c
further	c
information	c
from	c
me	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
on	i
July	c
,	c
because	c
is	i
the	c
only	c
month	c
I	c
have	c
holidays	c
in	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
because	c
I	c
think	c
they	c
're	c
more	c
comfortable	c
than	c
the	i
tents	c
,	c
also	c
because	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
like	c
to	c
sleep	c
in	c
tents	c
very	c
much	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
they	c
're	c
very	c
cold	c
during	c
the	c
night	c

About	c
the	c
activities	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
chosen	c
basketball	c
because	c
I	c
enjoy	c
playing	c
it	c
,	c
and	c
also	c
because	c
I	c
know	c
very	i
well	i
how	i
to	i
play	i
.	c

Another	c
thing	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
for	c
,	i
is	c
money	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
an	c
expensive	c
trip	c
and	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
enough	c
money	c
to	c
pay	c
for	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
's	c
all	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
look	c
foreword	i
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

One	c
could	c
be	c
when	c
you	c
go	c
into	c
a	c
shop	c
and	c
you	c
can	i
find	c
something	c
that	c
you	c
like	c
,	c
and	c
you	c
decide	c
to	c
buy	c
it	c
,	c
but	c
when	c
you	c
see	c
the	c
price	c
,	c
you	c
find	c
out	c
that	c
it	c
's	c
too	c
expencive	i
,	c
and	c
you	c
cannot	c
afford	c
to	c
buy	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
this	c
is	c
a	c
common	c
problem	c
in	c
shops	c
,	c
and	c
that	c
's	c
why	c
sometimes	c
people	c
leave	c
the	c
shop	c
without	c
buying	c
anything	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
thing	i
the	c
solution	c
would	c
be	c
to	c
hire	c
more	c
workers	c
.	c

You	c
just	c
find	c
the	c
type	c
of	c
clothes	c
you	c
would	c
never	c
wear	c
.	c

This	c
cituation	i
is	c
very	c
annoying	c
for	c
most	c
of	i
the	i
people	c
,	c
and	c
that	c
's	c
what	c
makes	c
shopping	c
unejoyable	i
.	c

AND	c
FOR	i
SEEING	c
IT	c
MY	c
FAMILY	c
HAD	c
A	c
VERY	c
DISAPPOINTING	c
EVENING	c
AND	c
SO	c
DID	c
I	c
FOR	i
IT	i
YOU	i
CAN	c
READ	c
BELOW	c
MY	c
POINT	c
OF	c
VIEW	c
ABOUT	i
IT	i
.	c

FROM	c
OUR	c
HOME	c
WE	c
CAN	c
USE	c
IT	c
FOR	c
DOING	c
A	c
LOT	c
OF	c
THINGS	c
LIKE	c
TO	i
BUY	i
FOOD	c
;	c
TO	i
WORK	i
,	c
TO	i
READ	i
NEWSPAPERS	c
AND	c
MANY	c
MORE	c
THINGS	c
.	c

ALTHOUGH	c
IT	c
MAY	c
BE	c
BAD	c
BECAUSE	c
WE	c
NEED	c
N'T	c
TO	i
GO	i
OUT	c
FOR	i
DOING	i
THE	i
MAIN	i
THINGS	c
AND	c
FOR	i
IT	c
WE	c
DO	c
N'T	c
KNOW	i
NEW	c
PEOPLE	c
AND	c
WITH	i
THE	i
TIME	i
WE	c
HAVE	c
LESS	c
CONTACT	c
WITH	c
THE	i
PEOPLE	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
happy	c
to	c
answer	c
your	c
letter	c
,	c
which	c
I	c
received	c
this	c
morning	c

About	c
accomodation	i
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
cabins	i
,	c
because	c
I	c
suffer	c
alergic	i
,	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
tend	i
,	i
would	c
be	i
not	i
very	c
suitable	c
for	c
my	c
health	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
happy	c
to	c
have	c
the	c
opportunity	c
to	c
do	c
some	c
sports	c

Dear	c
Kim	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
happy	c
to	c
receive	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
sure	c
you	c

You	c
asked	c
me	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
about	c
my	c
experience	c
to	i
help	i
in	i
the	c
concencert	i
last	c
week	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
asked	c
to	c
put	c
in	i
order	i
all	i
the	i
chair	i
for	c
the	c
singer	c
,	i
this	i
was	c
only	c
in	c
the	c
begining	i
,	i
after	i
that	c
I	c
need	i
to	c
control	i
all	c
the	c
microfons	i
.	c

After	c
that	c
all	c
the	c
singer	i
arrived	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
in	c
charche	i
to	i
greeting	c
them	c
and	c
give	i
them	c
something	c
to	c
drink	c
.	c

Well	c
Kim	i
,	c
remember	c
if	c
they	c
asked	i
you	c
to	c
help	c
go	i
you	i
will	c
see	c
how	c
wonderful	c
experience	i
.	i

With	c
Love	c
.	c

Last	c
night	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
your	c
theatre	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	i
"	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
what	c
I	c
expected	c
to	c
see	c
.	c

This	c
was	c
the	c
most	c
disappointing	c
thing	c
I	c
herd	i
.	c

The	c
discounts	c
were	c
n't	c
available	c
and	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
n't	c
open	c
,	i
because	c
the	c
owners	c
were	c
for	i
holidays	i
.	c

Every	c
day	c
after	c
school	c
she	c
went	i
to	c
my	c
house	c
or	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
hers	c
.	c

Always	i
we	i
were	i
laughing	c
and	c
having	c
great	i
time	c
.	c

I	c
loved	c
her	c
a	c
lot	c
and	c
I	c
thought	c
she	c
felt	c
the	c
same	c
about	c
me	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
had	i
wrong	c
.	c

She	c
started	c
to	c
act	c
like	c
them	c
and	c
speak	c
like	c
them	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
told	c
her	c
,	c
she	c
became	c
very	c
angry	c
.	i

Dear	c
Ms.	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
so	c
glad	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
won	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
!	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
really	c
big	c
surprise	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

In	c
June	c
and	c
in	c
August	c
I	c
will	c
have	c
to	c
work	c
,	c
so	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
rather	c
impossible	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
join	c
Camp	c
California	c
then	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
have	c
an	i
accomodation	i
in	c
log	i
cabin	c
because	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
more	c
comfortable	c
than	c
a	c
tent	c
.	c

So	c
if	c
I	c
could	c
choose	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
.	c

Being	c
at	c
the	c
Camp	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
swim	c
and	c
to	c
play	c
tennis	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
swam	i
for	c
10	c
years	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
played	c
tennis	c
since	c
I	c
was	c
9	c
years	c
old	c
and	c
those	i
activities	i
I	i
like	i
best	c
.	c

I	c
woke	c
up	c
early	c
in	c
the	c
morning	c
and	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
go	c
shopping	c
.	c

I	c
decided	c
to	c
try	c
it	c
on	c
.	c

-	c
What	c
is	c
your	c
size	c
-	c
said	c
shop-assistant	i
.	c

-	c
Och	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
sorry	c
,	c
but	c
we	c
have	c
run	c
out	c
of	c
36	i
size	i
.	c

I	c
went	c
in	c
and	c
I	c
asked	c
the	c
shop	c
assistant	c
if	c
I	c
could	c
try	c
it	i
on	c
.	c

-	c
38	c
-	c
I	c
said	c
.	c

-	c
I'am	i
very	c
sorry	c
but	c
we	c
do	c
not	c
have	c
38	c
.	c

I	c
came	c
back	c
home	c
-	c
tired	c
and	c
angry	c
.	c

Surely	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
the	c
best	c
day	c
for	c
shopping	c
.	c

I	c
did	c
not	c
buy	c
anything	c
,	c
although	c
I	c
tried	c
.	c

Dear	c
Miss	c
Ryan	c
:	c

I	c
received	c
your	c
letter	c
about	c
the	c
two	c
weeks	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
rather	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
,	c
and	c
if	c
it	c
's	c
possible	c
,	c
during	c
the	c
first	c
two	c
weeks	c
because	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
starting	c
college	c
at	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
the	c
summer	c
and	c
therefore	c
I	c
have	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
paperwork	c
to	c
get	c
done	c
.	c

I	c
must	c
say	c
I	c
am	c
quite	c
good	c
at	c
tennis	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
have	c
any	c
questions	c

not	c
hesitate	c
about	i

Dear	c
Kim	c
:	c
Hi	c
!	c

How	c
are	c
you	c
?	c

I	c
helped	c
Korn	c
in	i
a	c
concert	c
they	c
had	c
at	c
the	c
Auditorium	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
so	c
much	c
fun	c
,	c
we	c
had	c
a	c
great	c
time	c
that	c
night	c
.	c

Well	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
go	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
an	c
exam	c
tomorrow	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
n't	c
studied	c
at	c
all	c
.	c

Please	c
write	c
back	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
madam	i

To	c
begin	c
with	c
on	i
your	c
advertisment	i
you	c
say	c
that	c
Danny	c
Brooks	c
will	c
be	c
starring	c
the	i
show	c
but	c
instead	c
their	i
was	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
which	i
made	c
us	c
very	c
disappointed	c
.	c

To	c
make	c
matters	c
worse	c
the	i
restaurant	i
of	i
the	i
theatre	i
was	c
closed	c
.	c

You	c
can	c
understand	c
how	c
that	c
made	c
me	c
feel	c
,	c
and	c
when	i
the	i
tickets	i
had	i
no	i
discount	i

If	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
do	c
as	c
I	c
say	c
an	i
article	c
in	c
the	c
biggest	i
newspaper	c
will	c
deffenetly	i
change	c
your	c
ming	i

Are	c
they	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
the	c
same	c
,	c
are	c
they	c
going	c
to	c
have	i
colours	i
,	c
are	c
men	c
going	c
to	c
wear	c
long	c
skirts	c
and	c
women	c
boxershorts	i
?	c

The	c
variety	c
of	c
new	c
fabrics	c
,	c
colours	i
and	c
quality	c
,	c
make	i
new	c
fashions	i
statements	c
every	c
day	c
.	c

Although	i
the	c
clothes	c
are	c
getting	c
more	i
and	i
more	i
smaller	i
.	c

In	c
the	c
early	c
90s	c
it	c
was	c
in	c
fashing	i
the	i
women	c
to	c
wear	c
only	c
skirts	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
sixties	c
people	i
worn	i
clothes	c
with	c
flowers	c
,	c
big	c
glasses	c
,	c
jeans	i
,	c
and	c
men	c
should	i
have	i
had	c
long	c
painted	i
hair	c
.	c

Nowdays	i
women	c
were	i
really	c
short	c
skirts	c
,	c
short	c
t-shirts	c
,	c
short	c
tops	c
,	c
and	c
cut	c
their	c
hair	c
short	c
just	c
like	c
men	c
.	c

If	c
this	c

and	c
soon	c

I	c
take	i
the	c
dissision	i
to	c
write	c
to	c
you	c
because	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
complaine	i
about	c

I	c
write	i

last	c

I	c

and	c
unfortunatly	i
I	c
was	c

You	c

The	c
first	c
was	c
very	c
early	c
at	i

the	c
ather	i
at	c

We	c
went	c

Finally	i
the	c
musical	c

I	c
can	c
say	c
that	c
I	c
want	i

When	c
the	c
show	c
finished	c
we	i
went	c
to	c

I	c
discavered	i

It	i
also	c
puts	i
that	c
there	c
was	c
a	c
restaurant	c
to	c
eat	c
in	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
completely	c
built	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c

She	c
got	i
very	c
surprised	c
when	c
Pat	c
told	c
her	c
that	c
he	c
was	c
gay	c

On	c
Saturday	c
Peter	c
,	c
Pat	c
and	c
some	c
other	c

went	c
to	c
the	c
cinema	c

When	c

saw	i
the	c
film	c
,	c
Katy	c
and	c
John	c
approached	c
to	i
Peter	c
and	c
told	c
him	c
that	c
they	c
will	i
continue	c
being	c
his	c
friends	c

Pat	c
did	c

Dear	c

Here	i

Wherever	c
you	c

every	i
one	i
would	c
love	c
you	c
because	c
of	c
your	c
troussers	i
,	c
would	i
clean	c
all	i
the	c
rubbish	c
that	c
are	i
on	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

I	c
believe	c
that	c
you	c
must	c
be	c
the	c
manager	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
point	i
some	c
complaints	c
of	i
mine	i
about	c
the	c
play	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c

Moreover	c
,	c
the	c
theatre	i
's	i
play	c
was	c
expected	c
to	c
start	c
at	c
half	c
past	c
seven	c
in	c
the	c
afternoon	i
,	c
however	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
quarter	c
past	c
eight	c
!	c

To	c
make	c
matters	c
worse	c
,	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
and	c
one	c
of	c
your	c
assistants	c
said	c
that	c
it	i
was	i
being	i
under	i
construction	i
for	i
the	i
expansion	i
of	i
that	i
place	i
.	c

After	c
all	c
I	c
've	c
been	c
through	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
a	c
refund	c
of	c
my	c
money	c

Sincerely	c
yours	c

Nowadays	c
,	c
the	i
technology	c
has	c
expanded	i
its	c
"	i
legs	i
"	i
to	c
almost	c
every	c
part	i
of	c
our	c
interests	c
,	c
jobs	c
and	c
even	c
hobbies	c

The	c
biggest	c
achievement	c
of	c
modern	c
technology	c
has	i
broken	i
into	c
my	c
house	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
I	c
was	i
at	i
the	c
age	c
of	c
ten	c
.	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
my	c
life	c
is	c
surrounded	i
by	i
modern	c
gadgets	c

Sometimes	c
these	c
gadgets	c
are	c
for	c
the	c
best	c
and	c
-	c
more	c
often	c
-	c
for	c
the	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
on	i

I	c
finish	c

and	c
I	c
go	c
to	c
Great	c

on	i

If	c
I	c
can	c
choose	c
my	c
accomodation	i
,	c
I	c
prefer	c
living	i
in	c

I	c
want	c
playing	i

I	c
did	i
n't	i
play	i

I	c

I	c
go	c
to	c

I	c
think	c
the	c
best	c
choice	c
is	c
to	c
show	c
many	c
types	c
of	c
activities	c
.	c

We	c
should	c
filmed	i
our	c
pub	c
and	c
room	i
of	c
students	c

To	c
make	c
matters	c
worse	c
when	c
we	c
bought	c
the	c
tickets	c
,	i
they	c
were	c
too	i
much	i
expensive	c
and	c
there	c
were	c
n't	c
any	c
discounts	c
for	c
young	c
people	c

for	c
groups	c

Your	i
's	i
Faithfully	c

Now	c
Pat	c
is	c
angry	c
with	c
us	c
because	c
we	c
did	c
n't	c
explain	i
her	c
what	c

because	c

that	c
I	c
would	c

to	c

I	c
thing	i
it	c
very	i
exciting	c
although	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
tried	c
climbing	c

because	c
in	i
my	i
city	i
there	i
are	i
no	i
mountains	i

I	c
just	c
want	c
to	c
ask	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
are	c
having	c
fun	c
and	c
that	c
you	c
are	c
OK	c

Last	c
Sanday	i
my	c
friends	c
and	c
I	c
saw	c
that	c
advertisement	c
about	c
the	c
theatre	i
you	c
were	c
supposed	c
to	c
present	i
.	c

We	c
went	c
there	c
on	c
time	c
.	c

We	c
could	c
n't	c
believe	c
it	c
.	c

We	c
were	c
very	c
disappointed	c
because	c
before	c
this	c
happened	c
we	c
pouded	i
the	c
tickets	c
but	c
there	c
were	c
no	c
discounts	c
available	c
.	c

We	c
did	c
see	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
but	c
we	c
did	c
not	c
see	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
.	c

That	c
was	c
very	c
disapponted	i
.	c

We	c
decided	c
to	c
visit	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
.	c

But	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
!	c
!	c

When	c
we	c
asked	c
why	c
was	i
it	i
closed	c
the	i
people	c
there	c
told	c
us	c
that	c
they	c
did	c
not	c
organized	i
it	c
before	c

And	c
please	c
do	c
not	c
be	c
very	c
suprised	i
If	i
you	c
recieve	i
more	c
letters	c
about	c
this	c

I	c
did	i
a	c
big	c
mistake	c
by	c
trusting	c
him	c
.	c

What	c
a	c
fool	c
was	i
I	i
.	c

We	c
did	c
n't	c
want	c
out	i
grand-mother	i
to	c
find	c
it	i
out	c
at	c
that	c
moment	c
so	c
we	c
was	i
trying	c
to	c
keep	c
it	c
secret	c
.	c

I	c
knew	c
Pat	c
,	c
my	c
cousin	c
,	c
loved	c
our	c
grandmother	c
very	c
much	c
.	c

She	c
and	c
Pat	c
had	c
a	c
special	c
relationship	c
.	c

After	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
thought	c
I	c
told	c
it	i
to	i
him	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
was	c
sure	c
he	c
would	c
tell	i
nothing	c
.	c

Just	i
as	i
Pat	c
left	c
my	c
house	c
he	c
went	c
right	c
away	c
to	c
the	c
hospital	c
.	c

My	c
grandmother	c
was	c
very	c
sensitive	c
and	c
bored	c
life	i
and	c
when	c
she	c
heart	i
it	c
her	i
condition	c
became	c
more	c
serious	c
.	c

After	c
two	c
days	c
she	c
died	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Brown	c
,	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
suggested	i
you	i
to	i
come	i
to	c
our	c
party	c
and	c
we	c
would	c
like	c
not	i
to	c
tell	i
anything	i
to	i
your	i
husband	i
because	c
the	c
party	c
is	c
a	c
surprise	c
.	c

At	i
the	i
party	i
will	i
come	i
his	i
students	i
,	i
the	i
teachers	i
and	i
the	i
principal	i
.	c

We	c
would	c
like	c
to	i
tell	c
us	c
which	c
is	c
the	c
best	c
present	c
for	c
him	c
.	c

I	c
did	c
n't	c
beleive	i
him	c
at	i
the	i
first	i
time	i
.	c

I	c
wanted	c
t	i
know	c
why	c
we	c
were	c
there	c
.	c

At	c
that	c
moment	c
we	c
saw	c
the	c
bus	c
to	i
come	i
,	c
it	c
stopped	c
and	c
one	c
man	c
come	i
and	c
sit	i
near	c
of	i
us	c
.	c

He	c
was	c

Now	c

Dear	c

I	c
am	c

to	c
give	c
you	c
some	c
further	c
information	c
that	c
you	c

Camp	c
California	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
allowed	i
to	i
take	i
holiday	i
only	i
in	c
July	c
.	c

Concerning	c
accommodation	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
log	c
cabins	c
.	c

As	c
requested	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
choosed	i
two	c
activities	c
-	c
sailing	c
and	c
surfing	c
.	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

I	c
'm	c
sorry	c
I	c
have	c
n't	c
written	c
before	c
,	c
but	c
as	c
you	c
know	c
,	c
I	c
've	c
been	c
very	c
busy	c
because	c
I	c
was	c
helping	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
last	c
month	c
.	c

I	c
helped	c
people	c
setting	c
and	i
decorating	c
the	c
concert	c
hall	c
which	c
was	c
great	c
help	c
for	c
my	c
major	c
subject	c
-	c
You	c
know	c
that	c
my	c
subject	c
is	c
design	c
.	c

The	c
day	c
I	c
shaked	i
their	c
hands	c
,	c
I	i
though	i
I	i
was	i
over	i
the	i
moon	i
!	i

I	c
will	c
never	c
forget	c
that	c
day	c
.	c

Write	c
son	i
and	c
let	c
me	c
know	c
what	c
you	c
have	c
been	c
doing	c
.	c

How	c
are	c
you	c
?	c

I	c
did	c
n't	c
see	c
anywhere	i
Danny	i
Brook	i
,	c
but	c
another	c
actor	c
.	c

That	c
it	i
was	c
a	c
big	c
mistake	c
.	c

Unfortunatly	i
your	c
advertisment	i
said	c
that	c
the	c
show	c
starts	c
at	c
19:30	c
but	c
it	c
started	c
45	c
minutes	c
later	c
.	c

Also	c
there	c
were	c
n't	c
any	c
discounts	c
.	c

I	c
know	c
that	c
,	i
each	c
student	c
gave	i
its	i
different	i
answers	i
,	c
but	c
some	c
of	c
us	c
will	c
have	c
some	c
opinions	i
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
,	i
the	c
big	i
'	i
improve	i
'	i
of	c
technology	c
the	i
last	c
30	c
years	c
helped	i
and	c
still	i
helping	c
us	c
a	c
lot	c
in	c
our	c
daily	c
life	c
.	c

With	c
the	i
telephones	c
,	c
the	i
aeroplanes	c
,	c
even	i
the	i
fast	c
ships	c
there	i
are	c
no	c
big	c
distances	c
any	c
more	c
.	c

With	i
a	i
lot	i
of	i
using	i
of	i
T.V	i
and	c
computer	c
,	i
make	i
people	c
more	c
close	i
.	c

You	c
might	c
not	c
know	c
your	c
neighbour	c
because	c
all	i
the	i
time	i
your	i
in	i
the	i
house	i
.	c

Children	c
are	c
not	c
studying	c
as	c
much	c
they	i
have	i
to	c
,	c
because	c
they	c
are	c
watching	c
T.V	i
,	c
speacing	i
on	c
the	c
phone	c
or	c
even	c
playing	c
computer	c
games	c
.	c

That	c
's	c
why	c
my	c
marks	c
this	c
year	c
were	c
bit	i
low	c
.	c

And	c
ofcourse	i
my	c
parents	c
were	c
very	c
angry	c
with	c
me	c
.	c

Dear	c
Ms	c
Ryan	c

The	c
second	c
week	c
of	c
July	c
would	c
be	c
perfect	c
to	c
start	c
my	c
trip	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
rather	c
sleep	c
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
.	c

What	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
would	c
be	c
appropriate	c
,	c
winter	c
or	c
summer	c
?	c

This	c
is	c
a	c
report	c
to	c
plan	c
and	c
suggest	c
ideas	c
for	c
the	c
daily	i
life	i
video	c
at	c
school	c
.	c

It	c
would	c
reflect	c
the	c
atmosphere	c
when	c
they	c
meet	c
early	c
in	c
the	c
morning	c
.	c

Filming	c
lessons	c
such	c
as	c
grammar	c
lessons	c
and	c
speaking	i
either	i
theory	i
lessons	i
or	i
practice	i
would	c
give	c
a	c
general	c
idea	c
about	c
a	c
day	c
at	c
school	c
and	c
how	c
students	c
work	c
on	c
their	c
lessons	c
.	c

The	c
team	c
has	c
been	c
training	c
very	c
hard	c
during	c
last	i
weeks	c
.	c

Your	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
musical	c
show	i
,	i
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
,	i
said	c
it	c
was	c
London	c
's	c
newest	c
and	c
best	c
musical	c
show	c
,	i
I	c
agree	c
with	c
that	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
wonderfull	i
show	c
but	c
,	i
it	c
said	c
that	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
would	c
be	c
starring	c
in	c
it	c
.	c

On	i
the	c
advertisment	i
it	c
also	c
said	c
,	i
you	c
could	c
visit	c
our	i
restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
and	c
that	c
is	c
what	c
I	c
did	c
,	c
but	c
when	c
I	c
got	c
there	c
it	c
was	c
shut	c
for	c
no	c
reason	c
.	c

What	c
I	c
'm	c
trying	c
to	c
say	c
is	c
that	c
this	c
was	c
n't	c
my	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
and	c
that	c
I	c
should	c
get	c
at	c
least	c
some	c
money	c
back	c
!	c

This	c
time	c
she	c
told	c
Pat	c
that	c
she	c
thought	c
her	c
dog	c
,	c
Churls	c
,	c
was	c
going	c
to	c
die	c
.	c

Jacob	c
whispers	c

Jacob	c
shouts	c
.	c

"	c
I	c
'll	c
talk	c
to	c
her.	i
"	c

I	c
hope	c
,	i
that	c
's	c
possible	c
.	c

From	c
the	c
activities	c
I	i
want	c
to	i
take	i
Golf	i
and	i
Surfing	i
.	c

Golf	c
play	i
the	i
wealthy	c
people	c
,	c
the	i
upper	i
class	i
of	i
a	i
town	i
,	c
and	c
surfing	c
sounds	c
like	c
freedom	c
.	c

There	c
is	c
only	c
one	c
more	c
question	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
ask	c
:	c
Can	i
I	c
take	c
my	c
girl-friend	i
with	c
me	c
,	c
of	i
course	i
with	i
paying	i
?	c

Very	c
often	c
,	c
for	c
example	c
on	c
Friday	c
afternoon	c
or	c
Saturday	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
so	c
many	c
people	c
in	c
a	i
shopping	c
centre	c
,	i
that	c
you	c
ca	c
n't	c
move	c
yourself	i
forwards	c
or	c
backwards	c
.	c

Many	c
people	c
say	c
that	c
this	c
is	c
real	c
shopping	c
,	c
when	c
you	c
queue	c
for	c
hours	c
to	i
pay	i
only	i
a	i
pair	c
of	c
socks	c
or	c
a	c
bottle	c
of	c
mineral	c
water	c
at	c
the	c
supermarket	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
,	i
you	c
ca	c
n't	c
really	c
enjoy	c
shopping	c
when	c
there	c
are	c
hundreds	c
of	c
people	c
and	c
everyone	c
wants	c
to	c
buy	c
something	c
.	c

I	c
like	c
going	c
shopping	c
during	c
the	c
week	c
,	c
when	c
I	c
can	c
look	c
at	c
each	c
good	i
a	c
store	c
sells	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
see	c
this	c
musical	c
'	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
'	c
because	c
the	c
actor	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
was	c
acting	c
in	c
it	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
ridiculous	c
!	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
have	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
in	c
ten	c
days	c
,	c
in	i
the	i
other	i
case	i
,	c
I	c
would	i
have	c
to	c
sue	c
you	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Pat	c
used	c
to	c
be	c
my	c
best	c
friend	c
but	c
a	c
few	c
days	c
ago	c
I	c
knew	i
all	i
the	c
truth	c
.	c

I	c
started	c
to	c
get	c
along	c
with	c
other	c
people	c
and	c
had	c
new	c
friends	c
but	c
I	c
continued	c
telling	c
Pat	c
my	c
secrets	c
.	c

My	c
new	c
friends	c
sometimes	c
talked	c
to	c
me	c
about	c
Pat	c
and	c
they	c
asked	c
me	c
once	c
if	c
we	c
were	c
close	c
friends	c
.	c

I	c
asked	c
them	c
why	c
they	c
had	c
asked	c
me	c
that	c
.	c

They	c
told	c
me	c
Pat	c
used	c
to	c
be	c
a	c
close	c
friend	c
of	c
them	i
and	c
she	c
used	c
to	c
talk	c
about	c
me	c
and	c
my	c
problems	c
.	c

At	c
first	c
,	c
Pat	c
denied	c
all	c
the	c
things	c
my	c
friends	c
told	c
me	c
about	c
herself	i
but	c
she	c
finally	c
agreed	c
with	c
that	c
.	c

I	c
asked	c
her	c
why	c
she	c
could	c
n't	c
keep	c
my	c
secrets	c
and	c
she	c
told	c
me	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
impossible	c
for	c
her	c
keeping	i
secrets	c
.	c

I	c
thanked	c
my	c
new	c
friends	c
for	c
not	c
to	i
tell	i
anybody	c
my	c
secrets	c
though	i
before	c
the	c
trouble	c
they	i
and	i
me	i
were	c
n't	c
very	c
friends	i
.	c

I	c
cannot	c
bear	c
when	i
somebody	c
says	c
something	c
and	c
then	c
does	c
just	c
the	c
opposit	i
way	i
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
despite	c
the	c
fact	c
that	c
you	c
said	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
starring	c
by	i
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
,	c
I	c
must	c
tell	c
you	c
that	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
did	c
not	c
appear	c
at	c
all	c
.	c

Instead	c
of	c
him	c
there	c
was	c
another	c
actor	c
who	c
neither	i
act	c
nor	c
sing	c
,	c
and	i
,	i
even	c
though	c
,	i
it	c
was	c
a	c
Musical	c
Show	i
.	c

If	c
in	i
the	c
advertisements	c
and	c
leaflets	c
says	i
"	c
VISIT	c
OUR	c
THEATRE	c
RESTAURANT	c
AFTER	c
THE	c
SHOW	c
"	c
there	c
are	i
not	i
reasons	i
for	c
being	i
closed	c

HOW	c
HAS	c
TECHNOLOGY	c
CHANGED	c
OUR	c
DAYLY	i
LIFES	i

In	i
times	i
of	i
our	i
grandparents	i
life	c
was	c
so	c
different	c
,	i
that	c
we	c
cannot	c
beleive	i
that	c
this	c
huge	c
change	c
to	c
our	c
day	i
life	c
happened	c
in	c
only	c
one	c
hundred	c
years	c
or	c
less	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
as	c
we	c
all	c
know	c
,	c
day	i
life	c
now	i
a	i
days	i
is	c
quite	c
simplier	i
and	c
an	c
example	c
of	c
this	c
is	c
that	c
instead	c
of	c
buying	c
a	c
peice	i
of	c
ice	c
to	c
cool	c
drinks	c
(	c
as	c
our	c
grandparents	c
used	c
to	c
do	c
)	c
we	c
not	c
only	c
have	c
a	c
refrigerator	c
but	c
also	c
a	c
freezer	c
in	c
case	c
you	c
want	c
it	c
faster	c
and	c
cooler	i
.	c

One	i
the	i
other	i
hand	i
,	c
despite	c
the	c
fact	c
that	c
technology	c
make	i
things	c
easier	c
in	c
our	c
day	i
life	c
,	c
the	c
same	c
happens	c
in	c
industries	c
and	c
companies	c
where	c
they	c
use	c
computers	c
and	c
machines	c
instead	c
of	c
people	c
.	c

As	c
people	c
do	c
not	c
get	c
a	i
job	i
because	c
is	i
not	c
needed	c
they	c
get	i
into	c
poorness	i
,	c
criminal	c
activities	c
,	c
being	i
isolated	c
and	c
without	i
the	i
possibility	i
of	c
getting	c
a	c
good	c
education	c
.	c

This	c
is	c
the	c
most	c
terribly	i
disadvantage	c
technology	c
has	c
.	c

With	c
advantages	c
and	c
disadvantages	c
,	c
technology	c
is	c
in	i
our	i
life	i
and	c
may	c
represent	c
an	c
advance	c
for	c
some	c
and	c
a	c
bad	c
thing	c
for	c
others	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
thank	c
for	i

me	c
about	c

and	c
I	c

in	i

to	c
you	c
the	c
information	c

requiered	i
in	c

About	c
the	c
Accommodation	c
I	i
would	c
like	c
you	c
to	c
take	c
careful	c
consideration	c
that	i
I	c
am	c
ashmatic	i
so	i
,	i
I	c
would	c
appreciatte	i
it	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
reserve	c
a	c
bed	c
in	c
log	i
cabins	i
.	c

Your	c
letter	c
also	c
mentioned	c
some	c
kind	c
of	c
activities	c
in	c
which	c
we	c
can	c
involve	i
through	i
the	c
camping	i
.	c

I	c
have	c
recently	c
finished	c
a	c
three	i
year	i
course	c
of	i
painting	c
and	c
I	c
always	i
be	i
fascinated	c
by	c
the	i
photography	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
to	c
see	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

You	c
may	c
be	c
asking	c
why	c
I	c
have	c
n't	c
written	c
to	c
you	c
before	c
.	c

Well	c
,	c
I	c
've	c
been	c
very	c
busy	c
you	i
know	c
.	c

Two	c
weeks	c
ago	c
I	c
enrolled	c
in	c
a	c
group	c
to	c
help	c
on	i
building	c
a	c
stage	c
for	c
a	c
concert	c
of	i
a	c
famous	c
singer	c
star	i
.	c

Activities	i
lasting	i
almost	c
2	c
days	i
and	i
a	i
half	i
.	c

It	c
was	c
really	c
awful	c
and	c
hard	c
.	c

We	c
just	c
worked	c
in	i
building	c
the	c
stage	c
and	c
all	c
those	i
of	c
thing	c
.	c

Putting	c
the	c
instrument	i
in	c
the	c
right	c
place	c
,	c
testing	c
all	c
the	c
microphone	i
as	c
well	c
as	c
the	c
sound	c
was	c
the	c
rest	c
of	c
the	c
job	c
.	c

My	i
regards	i
to	c
your	c
family	c
.	c

Write	c
me	i
soon	c
.	c

As	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
whole	c
week	i
holiday	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
spend	c
it	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

At	c
first	c
I	c
though	i
I	c
would	c
just	c
make	i
a	c
bit	c
of	c
sight-seeking	i
all	c
around	c
the	c
city	c
.	c

But	c
when	c
one	c
night	c
I	c
saw	c
your	c
advertisement	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
spend	c
my	c
last	c
night	c
in	c
the	c
city	c
watching	c
a	c
musical	c
show	i
.	c

But	c
as	c
the	c
show	c
began	c
,	c
I	c
realised	c
that	c
the	c
actor	c
was	c
someone	c
different	c
,	c
his	c
name	c
was	c
Tim	c
Paradise	c
.	c

If	c
this	c
had	c
been	c
my	c
only	c
disappointment	c
nothing	c
would	c
have	c
happened	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
wait	c
stil	i
quarter	c
past	c
eight	c
in	i
order	i
to	c
watch	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
instead	c
of	c
beggining	i
at	c
half	c
past	c
seven	c
as	c
you	c
had	c
written	c
in	c
your	c
advertisement	c
.	c

a	c
disappointed	c
user	i
!	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

It	c
consisted	c
in	c
having	c
to	c
memorisize	i
a	c
whole	c
book	c
of	c
250	c
pages	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
pass	c
a	c
final	c
exam	c
.	c

Although	c
this	c
project	c
could	c
seem	c
a	i
very	c
though	i
work	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
try	c
it	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
rise	i
my	c
low	c
global	i
mark	c
.	c

As	c
she	c
was	c
also	c
making	i
the	c
project	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
let	c
her	c
copy	c
the	c
answers	c
.	c

She	c
agreed	c
and	c
went	c
home	c
very	c
happy	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
n't	c
believe	c
that	c
my	c
best	c
friend	c
had	c
told	c
everybody	c
about	c
my	c
secret	c
.	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c

Finally	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
practise	i
basketball	c
and	c
swimming	c
,	c
because	c
in	c
my	c
school	c
I	c
used	c
to	c
train	i
those	c
sports	c
a	c
lot	c
.	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c

Nowadays	c
most	c
of	i
the	i
people	c
are	c
atractted	i
by	i
shopping	c
centers	c
,	c
which	c
is	i
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
it	i
's	i
written	c
that	i
it	i
will	i
be	i
played	i
by	i
Danny	i
Brook	i
,	c
but	c
in	c
fact	c
it	i
was	c
n't	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
to	c
this	c
,	c
the	c
timetable	i
19.30	i
was	i
n't	c
correct	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
enquired	c
about	c
the	c
discounts	c
,	c
at	i
the	c
cashier	c
they	i
told	c
me	c
that	c
they	c
did	c
n't	c
have	c
any	c
information	c
about	c
it	i
.	c

We	c
spent	c
all	c
our	c
childhood	c
together	c
usually	i
driving	c
our	c
parents	c
mad	c
.	c

As	c
we	c
grown	i
up	c
,	c
we	c
were	c
getting	c
closer	c
and	c
closer	c
sharing	i
all	c
our	c
love	c
stories	c
and	c
even	c
more	c
.	c

Pat	c
is	c
n't	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

For	c
instance	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
organizing	c
a	c
party	c
for	c
my	c
sister	c
's	c
birthday	c
asking	i
all	c
.	i

friends	c
to	i
close	i
their	i
mouths	i
.	c

All	i
did	c
except	c
one	c
:	c
Pat	c
.	c

Firstly	c
I	i
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
only	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
two	c
months	i
holiday	c
which	c
are	c
July	c
and	c
August	c
,	i
I	c
choose	c
July	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
the	c
only	c
one	i
month	c
that	c
I	c
think	c
I	c
'm	c
free	c
.	c

Secondly	c
I	i
prefer	c
the	c
tents	c
because	c
I	c
've	c
never	c
been	c
in	c
that	i
tent	c
so	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
try	c
.	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c

Shopping	c
is	c
when	c
human	i
goes	i
to	c
the	c
shop	i
and	c
buy	c
what	c
they	c
went	i
,	i
however	i
I	i
think	c
this	c
word	c
is	c
for	c
women	c
because	c
they	c
like	c
beautiful	c
clothes	c
all	i
sort	i
of	c
things	c
.	c

Thirdly	c
if	i
you	c
're	c
fat	c
you	c
wo	c
n't	c
find	c
you	i
size	c
.	c

Forthly	i
that	i
product	c
is	c
too	c
expensive	c
for	c
you	c
and	c
the	c
last	c
problem	c
is	c
you	c
buy	c
to	i
much	i
things	c
but	c
you	c
have	c
not	c
got	c
your	c
own	c
car	c
so	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
carry	c
big	c
boxes	c
by	c
your	i
self	i
.	c

For	i
me	i
my	i
opinions	i
on	i
this	i
one	i
is	i
true	c
it	c
is	c
boring	c
,	i
it	i
might	c
because	i
I	c
am	c
a	c
boy	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madame	i
,	c

Also	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
delaying	i
for	i
more	i
45	i
minutes	i
than	i
the	i
advertise	i
mentioned	i

I	i
could	i
bare	i
it	i
by	i
the	i

One	c
of	c
them	c
is	c
fashion	i
area	i
.	c

For	c
instance	c
,	c
we	c
can	c
see	c
that	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
in	c
sci-fi	c
films	c
like	c
Starwars	c
.	c

however	i
,	c
in	i
the	i
other	i
hand	i
,	c
there	c
is	c
a	c
different	c
idea	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
most	c
designers	c
prefer	c
to	c
use	c
natural	c
material	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

Although	i
,	c
this	c
musical	c
show	i
was	c
not	c
as	c
good	c
as	c
I	c
expected	c
.	c

To	c
make	c
matters	c
worse	c
,	c
instead	c
of	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
performing	c
you	c
had	c
another	c
actor	c
,	c
which	c
was	c
very	c
disappointing	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
it	c
says	c
in	c
your	c
advertisement	c
that	c
discounts	c
would	c
be	c
available	c
,	c
despite	c
the	c
fact	c
they	c
were	c
not	c
.	c

According	c
to	c
your	c
brochure	c
it	i
says	i
this	c
would	c
be	c
the	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
expecting	c
a	c
full	c
refund	c
and	c
compensation	c
for	c
the	c
discomfort	c
I	c
have	c
suffered	c
.	c

Fashion	c
of	c
the	c
future	c
.	c

Everybody	c
wants	c
to	c
be	c
the	c
best	c
.	c

Due	c
to	c
this	c
the	c
quality	c
of	c
clothes	c
is	c
getting	c
better	c
and	c
in	c
100	c
years	c
we	c
will	c
be	c
asking	c
for	c
a	c
bigger	i
variety	c
of	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
the	c
prize	c
two	i
weeks	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
in	c
the	c
USA	c
.	c

On	i
the	c
following	c
there	c
is	c
some	c
further	c
information	c
from	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
not	c
think	c
I	c
have	c
enough	c
time	c
to	c
prepare	c
somethings	i
to	c
travel	c
before	c
of	i
July	c
.	c

In	i
fact	i
,	c
I	c
really	c
do	c
not	c
mind	c
to	i
stay	i
in	c
log	c
cabins	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
stayed	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
before	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
choose	c
tennis	c
and	c
swimming	c
.	c

The	c
other	c
activity	c
is	c
swimming	c
.	c

I	c
started	c
to	c
learnt	i
when	c
I	c
was	c
five	c
years	c
old	c
.	c

Now	c
I	c
own	c
a	c
swimming	c
school	c
and	c
have	i
trained	i
the	c
staffs	i
every	c
week	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
spend	c
during	i
a	i
camping	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

(	c
Mali	c
Ratana	c
)	c

How	c
are	c
you	c
?	c

Before	c
the	c
concert	c
started	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
help	c
the	c
staff	c
prepared	i
a	c
stage	c
,	c
like	i
put	i
the	c
instruments	c
where	c
they	c
should	c
be	c
on	c
the	c
stage	c
,	i
.	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
frightening	i
I	c
might	c
put	c
too	c
much	c
make	i
up	i
on	c
their	c
faces	c
,	c
but	c
everything	c
was	c
allright	i
.	c

I	c
was	c
running	c
around	c
to	c
find	c
something	c
I	c
could	c
do	c
,	c
like	c
serving	c
some	c
drinks	c
for	c
staffs	i
or	c
the	c
singers	c
.	c

I	i
think	i
I	i
did	i
n't	i
waste	i
my	c
time	c
at	c
all	c
.	c

I	c
spent	c
my	c
free	c
time	c
to	i
helping	c
them	c
its	i
made	i
my	c
life	c
a	c
little	c
bit	c
busy	c
.	c

To	i
helping	c
people	c
you	c
should	c
not	c
expect	c
anything	c
back	c
to	i
you	i
,	c
except	c
happiness	c
and	c
enjoyable	i

Dear	c

To	i

idea	i
to	i
make	i
a	c
short	c
video	c
about	c

I	c
am	c
also	c
very	c
fond	c
of	c
photography	c
,	c
so	c
when	c
I	c
have	i
seen	i
that	c
it	c
is	c
among	c
your	c
options	c
it	c
has	i
been	i
a	c
wonderful	c
surprise	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
which	i
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
are	c
more	c
suitable	c
for	c
that	c
time	c
of	c
the	c
year	c
at	c
the	c
camp	c
,	c
the	c
amount	c
of	c
money	c
that	c
more	i
or	c
less	c
I	i
would	c
need	c
to	c
bring	c
with	c
me	c
and	c
if	c
there	c
is	c
any	c
cooking	c
equipment	c
to	c
cook	c
the	c
meals	c
ourselves	c
.	c

Thanks	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
your	c
last	c
letter	c

Because	c
I	c
could	c
see	c
how	c
anxious	c
you	c
are	c
to	c
know	c
about	c
my	c
experience	c
at	c
the	c
Radiohead	c
concert	c
last	c
month	c
,	c
I	c
'll	c
tell	c
you	c
something	c
:	c
it	c
was	c
fantastic	c
.	c

He	c
asked	c
to	i
me	c
to	c
go	c
and	c
when	c
he	c
told	c
me	c
the	c
group	c
was	c
Radiohead	c
I	c
felt	c
the	i
luckiest	c
person	c
in	c
the	c
world	c
(	c
you	c
know	c
I	c
've	c
always	c
been	c
an	c
enthusiastic	c
fan	c
of	c
them	c
,	c
so	c
you	c
can	c
imagine	c
how	c
excited	c
I	c
was	c
)	c
.	c

And	c
his	c
signature	c

I	c
'll	c
always	c
keep	i
it	i
like	i
a	i

Love	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
let	c
you	c
know	c
the	i
disappointed	i
evening	c
I	c
had	c
seen	i
your	c
show	c
with	c
the	c
worst	c
services	c
I	c
have	c
ever	c
seen	i
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
in	i
the	c
ticket	c
for	i
entrance	i
says	i
that	c
the	c
actor	c
was	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
realy	i
he	c
was	c
not	c
.	c

The	c
last	c
thing	c
is	c
that	c
you	c
invited	c
us	c
to	c
visit	c
your	c
restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
the	c
food	c
was	c
not	c
already	i
done	c
.	c

I	c
thought	c
you	c
were	c
a	c
good	c
theatre	c
,	c
were	i
people	c
can	c
go	c
and	c
have	c
a	c
good	c
evening	c
alone	c
or	c
with	c
somebody	c
else	c
,	c
but	c
realy	i
I	c
am	c
very	c
disappointed	c
and	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
ask	c
for	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

I	c
'll	c
never	c
return	c
again	i
because	c
of	c
the	c
bad	c
service	c

I	c

say	c
the	i
moden	i
technology	c
has	c
changed	c
my	c

to	c

a	i
good	i
health	c

To	c
finish	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
say	c
technology	c
has	c
changed	c
my	c
life	c
in	c
good	c
and	c
bad	c
ways	c
,	c
helping	c
the	i
things	c
be	i
easier	c
but	c
making	c
me	c
develop	i
a	i
big	i
independence	i
.	c

I	c
have	c
just	c
received	c
the	c
letter	c
with	c
the	c
result	c
of	c
your	c
competition	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
as	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
on	c
traineeship	i
in	c
August	c
,	c
I	c
hope	c
this	c
could	i
occur	c
in	c
July	c
.	c

Besides	i
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
staying	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
also	c
very	c
glad	c
to	c
see	c
such	c
a	c
variety	c
of	c
activities	c
at	i
the	c
camp	c
.	c

Will	c
I	c
have	c
the	c
opportunity	c
to	c
visit	c
San	c
Franscico	c
or	c
Los	c
Angles	c
?	c

Moreover	c
,	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
will	c
I	c
need	c
if	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
go	c
out	c
at	c
night	c
?	c

These	c
are	c
some	c
further	c
details	c
I	c
keep	c
wondering	c
about	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	i
for	c
your	c
answer	c
.	c

Yours	c
Sincerely	i

Eventually	i
,	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
nice	c
to	c
make	i
a	c
sequence	c
with	c
lots	c
of	c
sports	c
activities	c
.	c

These	c
are	c
some	c
ideas	c
we	c
could	c
discuss	c
over	i
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
your	c
musical	i
show	c
.	c

We	c
thought	c
that	c
we	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
let	c
you	c
know	c
all	c
details	i
which	i
it	i
did	i
n't	i
make	i
us	i
happy	i
.	c

We	c
were	c
thinking	c
to	i
get	i
some	i
discount	c
on	c
our	c
tickets	c
,	c
because	c
we	c
had	c
already	i
read	c
from	i
the	c
advertisement	c
but	c
they	c
did	c
n't	c
discount	c
the	c
prices	c
so	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
pay	c
complete	i
money	i
for	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

We	c
were	c
ready	c
for	c
the	c
show	c
at	c
19.30	c
.	c

We	c
sat	c
out	i
sits	i
and	c
waited	c
for	c
the	c
show	c
but	c
it	c
did	c
n't	c
come	i
out	i
on	c
time	c
,	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
20.15	c
which	c
was	c
redicoulus	i
time	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
when	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
looking	c
for	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
because	c
this	c
actor	c
was	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
reason	c
for	c
me	c
to	i
come	i
here	i
.	c

I	c
realised	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
different	i
actor	c
playing	c
instead	c
of	c
Danny	c
brook	i
.	c

After	c
show	i
we	c
went	c
immediately	c
to	c
the	c
tickets	i
office	c
for	i
asking	i
money	i
back	c
,	c
but	c
they	c
were	c
to	i
strict	c
and	c
close-minded	i
.	c

They	c
just	c
said	c
,	c
"	c
we	i
do	c
n't	c
give	c
money	c
back.	c
"	c

We	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

necessiraly	i
some	i

them	c
not	c

Too	c
many	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
this	c
letter	c
to	c
inform	c
you	c
that	c
the	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
was	i
with	c
wrong	c
information	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
the	c
actors	c
were	c
different	c
from	c
the	c
ones	c
written	i
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
which	i
was	c
very	c
disappointing	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

When	c
the	c
show	c
ended	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
visit	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
I	i
could	c
not	c
get	c
in	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
as	c
the	c
chef	i
of	i
the	i
restaurant	i
was	c
not	c
there	c
.	c

I	c
did	c
not	c
have	c
a	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
have	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
the	i
doctors	c
have	c
found	c
the	c
cure	c
for	c
many	c
diseases	c
and	c
many	c
operations	c
have	c
been	c
done	c
in	c
less	c
time	c
and	c
in	c
a	c
painless	c
way	c
,	i
by	i
using	c
especial	i
machines	c
doctors	c
have	c
be	i
able	c
to	c
save	c
more	c
lives	c
than	c
in	c
the	c
past	c
.	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
technology	c
has	c
been	c
a	c
great	c
help	c
to	c
all	c
of	c
us	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
future	c
,	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
help	c
people	c
even	c
more	c
since	c
it	c
has	c
been	c
increasing	i
its	i
capacity	i
day	i
after	i
day	i
.	c

It	c
was	c
great	c
to	c
hear	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
keen	c
on	c
in	i
summer	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
tents	c
.	c

Both	i
of	i
them	i
I	i
am	i
not	i
as	i
good	i
as	i
you	i
expect	i
,	i
but	c
recently	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
intrested	i
in	c
those	i
.	c

Howeve	i
,	c
we	c
decided	c
to	c
have	c
the	c
job	c
,	c
because	c
of	c
good	c
money	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
see	c
a	c
great	c
number	c
of	c
pop	c
stars	c
in	c
front	c
of	c
us	c
.	c

Can	c
you	c
believe	c
that	c
.	i

My	c
job	c
just	c
prepear	i
drink	i
for	c
them	c
.	c

Moreover	c
one	i
of	c
famous	i
stars	c
gave	c
me	c
a	c
sign	i
.	c

A	c
big	c
hug	c
from	c
me	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
the	c
advertisement	c
said	c
that	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
would	c
be	c
the	c
lead	c
actor	c
,	c
but	c
he	c
was	c
not	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
the	c
play	c
did	c
not	c
start	c
at	c
the	c
time	c
it	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
to	c
wait	c
for	c
forty	i
five	i
minutes	c
.	c

All	c
the	c
waiting	c
made	c
me	c
quite	c
hungry	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
was	c
expecting	c
to	c
have	c
good	c
meal	c
at	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

By	c
the	c
way	c
,	c
why	c
were	c
n't	c
any	c
discounts	c
available	c
for	c
the	c
tickets	c
,	c
as	c
it	i
was	c
said	i
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
?	c

This	c
can	c
be	c
very	c
useful	c
when	c
you	c
have	c
a	c
problem	c
that	c
needs	c
an	c
immediate	c
solution	c
.	c

For	c
the	c
next	c
years	i
,	c
we	c
can	c
expect	c
many	c
more	c
technologies	i
that	c
will	c
continue	c
making	c
our	c
lives	c
easier	c
.	c

Dear	c
Helen	c

Fist	i
of	c
all	c
I	c
'm	c
going	c
to	c
give	c
some	i
informations	i
about	c
me	i
.	c

I	c
'd	c
also	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
'll	c
need	c
for	c
these	c
two	c
weeks	c
,	c
and	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
should	i
I	i
take	c
with	c
me	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
've	c
never	c
been	c
to	c
the	c
States	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
how	i
the	c
weather	c
is	c
in	i
California	c
during	c
the	c
summer	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
hearing	i
from	c
you	c
.	c

Especially	c
if	c
you	c
are	i
going	i
with	c
women	c
or	c
children	c
to	c
the	c
shops	c
.	c

To	c
let	c
you	c
arrange	c
the	c
details	c
of	c
your	c
programe	i
,	c
I	c
'm	c
going	c
to	c
give	i
my	i
answers	i
to	i
you	i
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
I	c
've	c
already	c
resistered	i
another	i
summer	c
course	c
which	c
starts	c
in	i
the	c
end	c
of	c
July	c
.	c

Sorry	c
about	c
that	c
but	c
I	c
can	c
make	c
that	c
travel	i
only	c
in	c
July	c
.	c

I	c
might	c
have	c
lots	c
of	c
chances	c
to	c
take	c
photos	c
of	c
beautiful	c
nature	i
.	c

And	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
choose	c
swimming	c
as	c
the	c
other	c
one	c
.	c

I	c
learned	c
swimming	c
at	c
my	i
age	c
of	c
8	c
for	c
5	c
years	c
and	c
I	c
still	c
love	c
swimming	c
.	c

Thanks	c
loads	c

Kyon	c
Chwa	c

All	c
the	c
students	c
in	c
my	c
class	c
are	c
excited	c
about	c
that	c
work	c
and	c
now	c
we	c
're	c
in	c
the	c
process	c
of	c
discussion	c
about	c
what	c
will	c
be	c
filmed	c
.	c

Every	i
students	i
keep	c
talking	c
about	c
he	i
theme	c
and	c
give	i
their	c
opinions	c
.	c

Because	c
we	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
pub	c
which	c
is	c
situated	c
near	c
to	c
the	c
school	c
quite	c
often	c
and	c
we	c
talk	c
more	c
about	c
personal	c
stories	c
that	c
make	c
us	c
closer	c
,	i
the	i
pub	c
after	c
the	c
lessons	c
will	c
be	c
interesting	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
have	c
just	c
received	c
your	c
letter	c
and	c
I	c
'm	c
writing	c
back	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
how	c
much	i
it	i
made	i
me	i
happy	i
to	c
win	c
this	c
prize	c
and	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
the	c
answers	c
to	c
your	c
questions	c
.	c

Singing	c
has	c
always	c
been	c
a	c
hobby	c
and	c
takes	i
an	c
important	c
part	c
in	c
my	c
life	c
.	c

to	i
finish	c
off	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
is	c
needed	c
for	c
my	c
personal	c
shopping	c
and	i
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
should	c
take	c
.	c

Making	c
a	c
short	c
video	c
about	c
daily	i
life	c
is	c
an	c
enjoyable	c
but	c
difficult	c
thing	c
to	c
do	c
.	c

Effectively	i
,	c
in	c
these	c
classes	c
,	c
students	c
express	c
themselves	c
more	c
than	c
in	c
other	c
classes	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
important	c
to	c
observe	c
students	i
attention	i
and	c
therefore	c
we	c
should	c
film	c
them	c
during	c
an	c
exam	c
(	c
but	c
only	c
for	c
a	c
short	c
period	c
of	c
time	c
)	c

The	c
cafeteria	c
is	c
an	c
interesting	c
place	c
to	c
go	c
because	c
one	c
can	c
see	c
if	c
students	c
respect	c
food	c
and	c
if	c
they	c
remain	c
polite	c
towards	c
each	c
other	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
important	c
to	c
remember	c
that	c
short	i
shots	i
should	c
be	c
taken	c
for	i
each	c
subject	c
.	c

This	c
looked	c
very	c
good	c
to	c
me	c
,	i
one	c
of	c
my	c
favourite	c
actors	c
,	c
the	c
time	c
did	i
suit	i
me	c
and	c
for	i
the	i
tickets	i
was	i
a	i
discount	i
available	i
.	c

Your	i
state	i
in	c
your	c
advertisment	i
that	c
he	c
would	c
come	c
on	c
stage	c
,	c
but	c
instead	c
of	c
him	c
someone	c
else	c
turned	c
up	c
.	c

The	c
other	c
thing	c
was	c
the	c
time	c
,	i
the	i
show	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
start	c
at	c
half	c
past	c
seven	c
,	c
but	c
we	c
have	i
been	i
waiting	i
for	c
45	c
minutes	c
,	c
before	c
the	c
light	c
turned	c
off	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

Luckely	i
I	c
could	c
keep	c
my	c
secret	c
for	c
a	c
couple	c
of	c
days	c
but	c
then	c
,	i
it	c
became	c
urgent	c
and	c
I	c
needed	c
someone	c
to	c
talk	c
to	c
.	c

I	c
thought	c
he	c
would	c
keep	c
everything	c
like	i
a	i
thing	i
between	c
him	c
and	c
me	c
,	c
but	c
he	c
disappointed	c
me	c
.	c

He	c
actually	c
went	c
to	c
Carla	c
and	c
told	c
her	c
every	i
thing	i
.	c

No	c
doubt	c
she	c
would	c
never	c
ever	c
look	c
at	c
me	c
again	c
.	c

But	c
she	c
did	c
,	c
she	c
asked	c
me	c
out	c
.	c

The	c
horrible	c
thing	c
about	c
this	c
is	c
,	i
I	c
'm	c
still	c
in	c
heaven	c
,	c
but	c
out	i
with	c
the	c
wrong	c
person	c
,	c
because	c
Pat	c
mixed	c
the	c
persons	i
with	c
their	c
names	c
.	c

There	c
are	c
two	c
Carlas	c
in	c
my	c
class	c
!	c

Dear	c
Mrs.	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
:	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
on	i
July	c
,	c
please	c
,	c
because	c
that	c
when	i
I	c
am	c
in	i
vacation	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
love	c
it	c
if	c
I	c
could	c
be	i
accommodated	i
in	c
a	c
tent	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
learning	c
how	c
to	c
take	c
care	c
of	c
myself	c
in	c
dangerous	c
situations	c
,	c
such	c
as	c
getting	c
lost	c
in	c
a	c
forest	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
being	i
in	c
a	c
tent	c
will	c
be	c
very	c
usefull	i
for	c
that	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
good	c
singing	c
skills	c
too	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
sung	c
in	c
the	c
church	c
's	c
choir	c
for	c
three	c
years	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
had	c
singing	c
classes	c
at	c
school	c
since	c
first	c
grade	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
how	c
cold	c
it	c
is	c
up	c
there	c
,	c
for	i
me	i
to	i
know	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
should	c
bring	c

Yours	c

Benedito	c

I	c
helped	c
setting	i
up	c
the	c
sound	c
equipment	c
,	c
programming	c
the	c
light	c
system	c
on	c
the	c
computer	c
,	c
tidy	i
up	c
Madonna	c
's	c
room	c

But	c
the	c
unpredicted	i
was	i
that	c
I	c
actually	c
got	c
to	c
meet	c
Maddy	c
,	c
and	c
talk	c
to	c
her	c
for	c
almost	c
one	c
hour	c
!	c

The	c
Material	c
girl	c
's	c
the	c
sweetest	c
person	c
in	c
the	c
world	c
,	c
totally	c
unlike	c
the	i
media	c
says	c
.	i

Mo	c
'	c
told	c
me	c
everything	c
about	c
her	c
new	c
album	c
,	c
"	c
Music	c
"	c
,	c
and	c
how	c
the	c
single	c
with	i
the	c
same	c
name	c
had	c
slipped	c
into	i
the	c
Internet	c
in	c
the	c
UP3	c
format	c
.	c

Her	c
daughter	c
,	c
Lourdes	c
Maria	c
,	c
is	c
such	c
a	c
pretty	c
little	c
girl	c
,	i
that	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
take	c
my	c
eyes	c
off	c
of	c
her	c

Hope	c
you	c
enjoy	c
the	c
pictures	c
,	i
got	i
one	c
autograph	c
for	c
you	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
share	c
with	c
you	c
some	c
feelings	c
I	c
have	c
after	c
watching	c
a	c
musical	c
show	c
,	i
which	c
was	c
played	i
at	c
The	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
last	c
week	c
.	c

Unfortunalety	i
my	c
feelings	c
are	c
rather	c
bad	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
a	c
week	c
's	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
last	c
week	c
,	c
when	c
I	c
saw	c
your	c
advertisement	c
concerning	c
'	i
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
'	c
musical	c
show	c
.	c

The	c
advertisement	c
looked	c
pretty	c
interesting	c
and	c
I	c
dicided	i
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
to	c
watch	c
this	c
musical	c
show	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
really	c
disappointed	c
when	c
I	c
saw	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
.	c

The	c
'	c
theatre	c
'	c
even	i
did	i
not	i
appologize	i
for	c
this	c
range	i
.	c

Despite	c
I	i
am	i
a	c
student	c
and	c
the	c
advertisement	c
said	i
that	c
discounts	c
were	c
available	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
refused	c
to	i
buy	i
a	c
half-a-price	i
ticket	c
,	c
and	c
the	c
explaination	i
'	c
why	c
'	c
was	c
n't	c
sufficiant	i
.	c

Unfortunately	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
,	c
which	c
made	c
me	c
even	c
angier	i
.	c

The	c
advertisement	c
say	i
'	c
your	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
'	c
,	i
however	i
it	i
was	c
the	c
worst	c
evening	c
I	c
have	c
had	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
you	c
give	i
me	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

I	c
told	c
her	c
about	c
my	c
plans	c
on	c
Monday	c
,	i
however	i
on	i
Friday	c
almost	c
half	c
of	c
my	c
class	c
knew	c
what	i
's	i
going	c
on	c
.	c

I	c
wanted	c
to	c
tell	c
them	c
about	c
this	c
after	c
I	c
would	i
pass	i
the	c
exam	c
.	c

Saturday	c
morning	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
driving	c
center	i
for	c
my	c
first	c
lesson	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
never	c
driven	c
a	c
car	c
before	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
Pat	i
was	c
there	c
and	c
half	c
of	c
my	c
class	c
.	c

I	c
felt	c
terrible	c
.	c

At	c
the	c
beginning	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
start	c
the	c
engine	c
.	c

I	c
looked	c
at	i
the	c
mirror	c
and	c
I	c
saw	c
how	c
my	c
friends	c
were	c
lauthing	i
.	c

I	c
started	c
doing	c
stupid	c
things	c
:	c
turn	i
right	c
instead	c
of	c
left	c
and	c
so	c
on	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
afraid	c
that	c
everybody	c
would	c
comment	c
my	i
first	c
lesson	c
.	c

Eventually	i
the	i
things	c
were	c
n't	c
so	c
bad	c
.	c

Pat	c
appologized	i
me	i
for	c
not	c
keeping	c
the	i
secrets	c
.	c

At	c
the	c
begining	i
I	c
was	c
very	c
angry	c
but	c
in	c
the	c
end	c
I	c
said	c
that	c
everything	c
is	i
O.K	c
.	c

I	c
liked	c
all	c
the	c
stars	c
and	c
the	c
artists	c
who	c
came	c
from	c
around	c
the	c
world	c
,	c
even	c
if	c
the	c
number	c
of	c
countries	c
was	c
very	c
little	i
,	c
only	c
six	c
.	c

And	c
that	c
's	c
the	c
reason	c
because	i
lots	c
of	c
people	c
came	c
.	c

Capua	c
,	c
16/12/2000	c

I	c
received	c
your	c
letter	c
yesterday	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
answer	c
you	c
soon	i
!	c

I	c
think	c
the	c
discussion	c
in	c
your	c
class	c
was	c
very	c
interesting	c
.	c

You	c
ca	c
n't	c
write	c
on	c
walls	c
and	c
desks.	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
some	c
rules	c
also	c
at	c
home	c
,	c
but	c
they	c
are	c
few	c
.	c

My	c
parents	c
are	c
afraid	c
of	c
it	c
because	c
I	c
took	i
my	i
licence	i
only	i
in	c
September	c
.	c

For	i
the	c
accommodation	c
I	i
would	c
like	c
to	c
have	c
log	i
cabins	i
rather	c
than	c
tents	i
because	c
two	c
weeks	c
is	c
quite	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
they	c
are	c
more	c
comfortable	c
and	c
give	c
you	c
more	c
privacy	c
.	c

Can	c
you	c
please	c
give	c
me	c
some	c
recomendations	i
about	c
the	c
clothes	c
I	c
will	c
need	c
and	c
also	c
the	c
cost	c
of	c
the	c
food	c
there	c
to	c
make	i
my	c
budget	c
.	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
shopping	c
sometimes	i
is	i
really	c
boring	c
specially	i
when	c
you	c
buy	c
at	i
the	i
supermarkets	i
almost	i
all	i
the	i
time	i
the	i
same	i
things	i
like	i
cleaning	c
products	c
and	c
the	c
ingredients	c
for	c
every	i
day	i
food	i
.	c

If	c
there	c
was	i
someone	c
to	c
do	c
so	c
,	c
we	c
could	c
have	c
gone	c
out	c
to	c
eat	c
something	c
.	c

Instead	c
of	c
the	c
famous	c
actor	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
a	c
very	c
bad	c
and	c
disappointing	c
actor	c
showed	c
up	c
.	c

As	c
it	c
was	c
too	c
late	c
,	c
the	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
and	c
we	c
starved	c
till	c
we	c
got	c
to	c
our	c
homes	c
.	c

We	c
were	c
also	c
disappointed	c
because	c
there	c
were	c
no	c
discounts	c
!	c

(	c
As	c
I	c
mentioned	c
above	c
)	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
disappointed	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
asking	c
for	c
some	c
money	c
back	c
if	c
possible	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

He	c
went	c
out	c
of	c
his	c
house	c
and	c
got	c
on	c
his	c
bike	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
bakery	c
.	c

On	c
his	c
way	c
he	c
saw	c
lots	c
of	c
places	c
he	c
could	c
buy	i
the	c
birthday	c
cake	c
but	c
knowing	c
that	c
the	c
safest	c
one	c
was	c
the	c
one	c
which	c
is	i
as	i
andy	i
as	i
Alison	c
's	c
house	c
he	i
kept	c
on	c
riding	c
.	c

When	c
he	c
reached	c
the	c
bakery	c
,	c
he	c
was	c
quite	c
relieved	c
and	c
he	c
almost	c
forgot	c
that	c
he	c
had	c
a	c
secret	c
to	c
keep	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
tell	c
your	i
some	i
things	i
that	c
happened	c
to	c
me	c
at	c
the	c
theatre	c
,	i
at	i
that	i
moment	i
I	c
felt	c
astonish	i
thinking	i
about	i
:	c
"	c
How	c
an	i
important	c
theatre	c
have	c
problems	c
like	c
this.	i
"	c

It	c
was	c
very	c
disappointing	c
.	c

I	c
felt	c
like	c
a	c
dumb	i
,	c
and	c
all	c
the	c
people	i
felt	c
like	i
me	i
.	c

Maria	c
passed	i
all	c
the	i
day	c
thinking	c
about	c
who	c
told	c
them	c
that	c
,	i
there	i
were	c
two	c
posibilities	i
:	c
one	c
her	i
best	c
friend	c
Becca	c
or	i
his	i
sister	c
Pat	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
like	c
a	c
"	c
chain	c
reaction	c
"	c
,	c
until	c
Maria	c
did	c
n't	c
want	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
school	c
any	i
more	i
,	i
her	i
mother	c
talked	c
to	c
her	c
,	c
but	c
there	c
was	c
no	c
case	i
,	i
she	i
was	c
very	c
angry	c
and	c
hurt	c
.	c

One	c
day	c
,	c
at	c
his	i
house	c
,	c
she	c
listened	c
Pat	i
talking	c
with	c
a	c
friend	c
and	c
Maria	c
realised	c
that	c
Pat	c
said	i
everything	c
,	c
because	c
they	c
were	c
talking	c
about	c
a	c
secret	c
of	c
another	c
friend	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
we	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
show	i
which	c
takes	c
place	c
from	c
Monday	c
13th	c
to	c
Wednesday	c
15th	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
opened	i
from	c
10:00	c
to	c
19:00	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
for	c
free	c
for	c
students	c
.	c

This	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
because	c
we	c
can	c
know	i
more	c
about	c
leisure	c
and	c
fashion	c
from	i
this	c
city	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
allow	c
us	c
to	c
go	c
we	c
could	c
change	c
the	c
programme	c
in	c
this	i
way	i
.	c

We	c
hope	c
you	c
consider	i
our	c
suggestions	c
letting	i
us	c
know	c
your	c
answer	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

All	c
this	c
will	c
happen	c
in	c
the	c
next	c
50	c
years	c
,	c
how	c
can	c
we	c
be	c
prepared	c
to	c
receive	c
all	c
these	c
things	c
in	c
our	c
homes	c
?	c

The	c
next	c
50	c
years	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
one	c
hand	c
,	c
we	c
will	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
spend	c
more	c
time	c
with	c
our	c
family	c
and	c
not	c
to	i
be	i
worried	c
about	c
anything	c
.	c

No	c
more	c
housework	c
,	c
no	c
more	c
stress	c
,	c
nor	i
more	c
illnesses	c
;	c
everything	c
will	c
be	c
perfect	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
really	c
surprised	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
.	c

I	c
have	i
not	c
expect	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
send	c
you	c
some	c
futher	i
information	c
which	c
you	c
need	c
.	c

I	c
need	c
relax	i
after	c
year	i
in	c
the	c
office	c
thats	i
why	c
I	c
choose	c
photography	c
and	c
painting	c
which	c
are	c
not	c
very	c
active	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
which	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
should	c
take	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
your	c
opinion	c
how	i
much	c
money	c
I	c
should	c
take	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

We	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
belive	i
that	c
shopping	c
is	c
the	c
most	c
wonderful	c
part	c
of	c
our	c
life	c
.	c

After	c
working	c
all	c
week	c
,	c
finally	c
on	c
Saturday	c
we	c
can	c
do	i
shopping	c
.	c

We	c
love	c
spending	c
money	c
,	c
but	c
spending	c
money	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

When	c
we	c
finally	c
do	c
this	c
,	c
we	c
cannot	c
go	i
confortable	i
because	c
of	c
crowd	i
.	c

Why	c
its	i
always	c
the	c
same	c
!	c

The	c
answer	c
is	c
that	c
we	c
choose	c
the	c
same	c
street	c
(	c
usually	c
the	c
most	c
popular	c
)	c
and	c
the	c
same	c
time	c
as	c
six	c
hundrets	i
other	c
people	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
great	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
could	c
be	c
even	c
better	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

First	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
an	c
international	c
festival	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
great	c
idea	c
,	c
but	c
only	c
six	c
countries	c
were	i
here	i
.	c

So	c
,	c
if	c
you	c
can	i
have	c
more	c
than	c
six	c
countries	c
,	c
it	c
could	i
be	c
great	c
.	c

This	c
idea	c
is	i
in	i
relation	i
with	i
the	c
number	c
of	c
plays	c
and	c
films	c
.	c

If	c
there	c
are	c
more	c
stars	c
and	c
artists	c
from	c
around	c
the	c
world	c
,	c
there	i
are	i
more	i
plays	i
and	i
films	i
and	i
it	c
is	i
better	c
.	c

It	c
would	c
be	c
better	c
if	c
you	c
have	i
some	c
large	i
halls	c
,	i
like	c
your	c
"	c
Arena	c
"	c
hall	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	i

my	c

the	c
only	c
things	c

are	c
things	c
which	c
can	i
disturbe	i
my	c

But	c
there	c
are	c
also	c
some	c
life	i

not	c
put	c

the	c

when	c
we	c
are	c
eating	c
or	c
eat	i

WHEN	c
THEY	c
CLOSED	c
I	i
TOOK	c
THE	c
7	i
BUS	c

I	c
WAS	c
LIVING	c
QUITE	c
CLOUSE	i
TO	c
PORTOBELLO	c
ROAD	c
BUT	c
I	c
DID	c
N'T	c
KNOW	c
VERY	i
WELL	i
THE	i
AREA	i
BECAUSE	c
ALL	c
TIME	i
I	c
JUST	c
HAD	c
TO	c
GET	c
OFF	c
IN	i
THE	c
COURNER	i
OF	c
MY	c
HOUSE	i
.	c

I	c
TOLD	c
HIM	c
,	i
I	c
DID	c
N'T	c
KNOW	c
WHERE	c
I	c
WAS	c
BUT	i
HE	c
JUST	c
SEID	i
SORRY	c
.	c

10	i
MINUTES	i
AFTER	i
I	i
WAS	i
FOLLOWING	i
HIM	i
,	c
I	c
START	i
KNOWING	i
THE	c
PLACE	c
,	c
AND	c
I	c
WAS	c
FELLING	i
MORE	c
CONFORTABLE	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
with	c
reference	c
to	c
the	c
international	c
arts	c
festival	c
that	c
you	c
organise	c
every	c
year	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
from	c
my	c
point	c
of	c
view	c
the	c
festival	c
itself	c
is	c
a	c
wonderful	c
idea	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
notice	i
that	c
the	c
festival	c
would	i
be	i
able	i
to	i
appeal	c
to	c
more	c
people	c
if	c
a	c
few	c
improvements	c
were	c
made	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
I	c
'm	c
quite	c
busy	c
so	c
do	c
n't	c
worry	c
if	c
I	i
happen	i
to	i
delay	i
answer	i
to	c
some	c
of	c
your	c
letters	c
.	c

In	c
your	c
last	c
letter	c
you	i
wondered	c
what	c
the	c
rules	c
of	c
behaviour	c
at	c
school	c
and	c
at	c
home	c
are	c
like	c
in	c
my	c
country	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
'm	c
going	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
some	c
information	c
.	c

In	c
Poland	c
rules	i
that	c
refer	c
to	c
the	c
ways	i
of	i
being	i
dressed	i
at	c
school	c
are	c
n't	c
very	c
strict	c
;	c
we	c
do	c
n't	c
wear	c
any	c
uniforms	c
,	c
but	c
our	c
clothes	c
have	c
to	c
be	c
clean	c
and	c
nice	c
to	c
look	c
at	c
.	c

At	c
home	c
young	i
people	c
should	c
help	c
their	c
parents	c
do	c
some	c
houseworks	i
.	c

Generally	c
,	c
we	c
are	c
supposed	c
to	c
treat	c
our	c
parents	c
(	c
as	c
well	c
as	c
the	c
teachers	c
at	c
school	c
)	c
with	c
respect	c
and	c
not	c
to	c
argue	c
with	c
our	c
brothers	c
and	c
sisters	c
.	c

Give	c
my	c
regards	c
to	c
your	c
family	c
,	c

We	c
were	c
told	c
that	c
this	c
was	c
a	c
great	c
show	c
,	c
and	c
we	c
decided	c
to	c
see	c
how	c
it	c
was	c
.	c

If	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
as	c
good	c
as	c
we	c
were	c
told	c
we	c
should	c
save	c
our	c
final	c
night	c
for	c
it	c
,	c
this	c
was	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
our	c
vacation	c
,	c
a	c
great	c
one	c
by	i
the	c
way	c
.	c

When	c
our	c
final	c
day	c
arrived	c
,	c
we	c
went	c
shoping	i
in	c
the	c
morning	c
and	c
then	c
we	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
hotel	c
to	c
change	c
our	c
clothes	c
and	c
get	c
ready	c
for	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

When	c
we	c
entrance	i
the	c
place	c
our	c
problems	c
begun	i
.	c

Then	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
had	c
a	c
great	c
delay	c
,	c
almost	c
an	c
hour	c
,	i
we	c
deal	i
with	c
that	c
too	c
.	c

After	c
that	c
they	c
changed	c
the	c
principal	c
actor	c
,	c
the	c
one	c
that	c
replaced	c
him	c
was	c
very	c
bad	c
,	c
that	c
made	c
us	c
realy	i
angry	c
.	c

But	c
that	c
is	c
n't	c
all	c
,	c
to	c
complete	c
this	c
tragedy	c
the	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c

How	c
has	c
moden	i
technology	c
changed	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
?	c

Nowadays	c
,	c
technology	c
is	c
everywhere	c
,	c
all	c
over	c
your	c
house	c
,	c
your	c
school	c
,	c
ofice	i
or	c
any	c
place	c
you	c
can	c
be	c
in	c
a	c
city	c
.	c

This	c
technology	c
has	c
help	i
in	c
many	c
fields	c
,	c
like	c
medicine	c
,	c
entreteinment	i
,	c
work	c
and	c
other	c
thing	i
,	c
so	c
it	c
has	c
obviusly	i
change	i
the	c
life	i
of	c
many	c
people	c
.	c

This	c
is	c
a	c
new	c
era	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
this	c
letter	c
to	c
express	c
my	c
thoughts	c
about	c
the	c
International	c
Art	c
Festival	c
of	c
this	c
year	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
so	c
impressed	c
the	i
exhibitions	c
of	i
the	c
festival	c
that	c
you	c
had	i
organized	i
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
the	i
artists	i
or	i
stars	i
from	i
we	i
have	i
rare	i
chance	i
to	i
feel	i
the	i
atmosphere	i
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
some	c
concert	c
halls	c
were	c
too	c
small	c
to	c
enter	i
all	c
of	c
the	c
audience	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
plays	c
and	c
films	c
were	c
shown	c
only	c
twice	c
a	c
day	c
so	c
that	c
people	c
had	i
gathered	i
one	i
time	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	i
to	i
be	i
held	i
more	i
performances	i
next	c
year	c
in	c
the	c
bigger	c
halls	c
.	c

You	i
may	i
consider	i
my	i
suggestion	i
to	i
have	i
the	i
art	i
festival	i
for	i
next	i
year	i
.	c

Long	i
long	c
time	c
ago	c
,	c
there	c
were	c
the	i
old	c
man	c
and	c
old	c
woman	c
lived	i
in	i
a	i
foot	c
of	c
mountain	i
.	c

One	c
day	c
,	c
when	c
the	c
old	c
man	c
went	c
into	c
the	c
bambo	i
bush	c
,	c
he	c
found	c
one	i
bambo	i
gritted	i
white	i
.	c

Then	i
there	i
was	c
a	c
lovely	c
baby	c
in	c
it	c
.	c

She	c
grew	c
very	c
quick	i
and	c
was	c
so	c
beautiful	c
.	c

One	c
full	i
moon	i
night	c
she	c
said	c
to	c
her	c
parents	c
sadly	c
,	c
'	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
return	c
to	c
the	c
Moon	c
tonight	c
.	c
'	c

This	c
story	i
happened	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
ago	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
,	c
when	c
I	c
entered	c
into	i
the	c
theatre	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
have	c
discount	i
in	c
spite	c
of	c
student	i
and	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
use	c
in	i
your	c
restaurant	c
either	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

In	i
that	c
time	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
it	c
had	c
been	c
being	c
repaired	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

How	c
has	c
modern	c
technology	c
changed	c
our	c
daily	c
life	c
?	c

Of	c
course	c
,	c
our	c
life	c
will	c
be	c
completely	c
changed	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
the	c
developed	c
technology	c
and	c
science	c
will	c
make	c
our	c
life	c
more	c
convenient	c
than	c
now	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c

I	c
was	c
really	c
disappointed	c
therefore	c
I	c
am	c
writing	c
a	c
complain	i
.	c

Firstly	c
I	c
bought	c
the	c
ticket	c
because	c
I	c
like	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
's	c
acting	c
but	c
in	c
the	c
show	c
someone	c
was	c
acting	i
his	c
part	c
.	c

Secondly	c
the	c
time	c
on	c
the	c
leaflet	c
is	c
totaly	i
wrong	c
.	c

It	c
said	c
it	c
will	i
start	c
at	c
19:30	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
an	c
article	c
about	c
fashion	i
of	c
the	c
future	c
to	i
the	c
international	c
student	c
magazine	c
.	c

Fashion	i
are	c
always	c
changing	c
therefore	c
it	c
is	c
really	c
difficult	c
to	c
say	c
what	c
sort	c
of	c
clothes	c
people	c
wear	i
in	c
future	i
.	c

For	c
example	c
our	c
fashion	i
style	c
at	c
the	c
moment	c
is	i
comes	c
from	c
70's	c
fashion	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
the	i
people	c
will	c
wear	c
clothes	c
which	c
are	c
metalic	i
or	c
bright	i
colourful	i
colour	i
with	i
mixture	i
of	i
history	i
and	i
future	i
fashion	i
style	i
.	i

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
.	i

I	c
'm	c
very	c
pleased	c
to	c
hearing	i
from	c
you	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
'm	c
glad	c
I	c
've	c
got	c
this	c
chance	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
Camp	c
California	c
in	c
the	c
U.S.A.	c
for	c
two	c
weeks	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
'd	c
prefer	c
to	c
accommodate	i
myself	i
in	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
log	c
cabins	c
,	c
as	c
they	c
are	c
more	c
comfortable	c
,	c
usually	c
have	c
central	c
heating	c
and	c
other	c
necessary	c
facilities	c
.	c

Despite	c
my	c
appriciation	i
of	c
all	c
kinds	c
of	c
sports	c
and	c
activities	c
,	c
I	i
'd	i
choose	i
my	c
favourite	c
ones	c
,	c
which	c
are	c
swimming	c
and	c
tennis	c
.	c

As	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
champion	c
of	i
swimming	i
competition	c
in	c
Russia	c
in	c
1997	c
,	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
continue	c
to	c
practice	i
my	c
skills	c
.	c

In	i
the	i
conclusion	i
I	i
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
if	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
take	c
some	c
money	c
with	c
me	c
and	c
how	c
much	c
?	i

What	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
will	c
I	c
need	c
in	c
the	c
U.S.A.	c
in	c
July	c
?	c

Your	i
sincerely	c
,	c

Hope	c
to	c
hear	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

Sincerely	c
,	c
I	c
must	c
admit	c
,	i
that	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
like	c
shopping	c
in	c
supermarkets	c
and	c
big	c
stores	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
it	c
takes	c
too	c
long	c
to	c
find	c
something	c
you	c
need	c
in	c
unfamiliar	c
stores	c
.	c

Despite	c
I	i
like	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
nice	c
clothes	c
shops	c
I	c
usually	c
return	c
home	c
with	c
nothing	c
in	c
my	c
hands	c
,	c
as	c
prices	c
are	c
usually	c
to	i
high	c
,	c
unfortunately	c
not	i
affordable	i
for	i
me	i
.	c

Sometimes	c
I	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
local	c
market	c
,	c
but	c
not	c
on	c
my	c
own	c
.	c

I	c
ask	c
my	c
husband	c
or	c
mother	c
to	c
come	c
with	c
me	c
,	c
as	c
I	c
had	c
bad	i
experience	c
in	c
the	c
past	c
,	c
when	c
my	c
bag	c
with	c
all	c
my	c
money	c
was	c
stolen	c
.	c

Another	c
thing	c
I	c
dislike	c
about	c
shopping	c
is	c
some	c
annoying	c
shop	c
assisstants	i
which	i
try	c
to	c
sale	i
any	c
products	i
to	c
the	c
"	c
victim	c
"	c
entring	i
the	c
door	c
.	c

Dear	i

question	c
about	c
where	c
would	i
I	i
prefer	c
to	c
sleep	c
,	c
I	c
prefer	c

because	c
it	i

closer	c
to	c

and	c
I	c
like	c
sleepping	i
in	c
sleepping	i

Now	c

In	c
our	c
lyceum	i
we	c
have	c
listem	i
of	c
"	c
double	c
lessons	c
"	c

As	c
a	c
student	c
of	i
economical	i
form	c
I	c
think	c
I	c
should	c
tell	c
you	c
about	c
one	c
day	c
in	c
time	i
table	i
of	c
our	c
form	c

For	c

Tuesday	c

On	c
Tuesday	c
we	c
have	c
such	i
lessons	c
English	i
,	c
Math	i
,	c
Economics	c
and	c
Phisics	i
.	c

Especially	c
English	c
and	c
Economics	c
because	c
we	c
are	c
going	c
to	c
become	c
famous	c
economists	c
.	c

Not	c
only	c
these	c
subjects	c
are	c
studied	c
by	c
us	c

also	c
Latin	c
,	c
Russian	c
,	c
Ukrainian	c
,	c
Biology	c
and	c
Phisical	i
training	c
,	c
but	c
as	c
we	c
study	c
them	c
we	c
understand	c
that	c
they	c
are	c
not	c
so	c
important	c

International	c
Arts	c
Festival	c

I	c
am	c
student	i
at	c
London	c
College	c
and	i
studying	c
English	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
great	c
that	c
you	c
organised	c
Art	i
Festival	c
in	c
this	c
City	i
,	c
because	c
people	c
realy	i
needed	i
this	c
kind	c
of	c
sochibal	i
activities	i
here	c
.	c

I	c
have	i
spent	i
two	c
days	c
at	c
the	c
International	c
Arts	c
Festival	c
with	c
some	c
of	c
my	c
friend	i
and	c
I	c
must	c
say	c
we	c
realy	i
delighted	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
great	i
idea	c
to	c
do	c
that	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

I	c
believe	c
plays	i
and	i
films	i
should	i
be	i
more	i
than	i
it	i
was	i
for	i
next	c
year	c
and	c
stars	i
and	c
artists	c
should	c
be	c
from	c
round	i
the	c
world	c
.	c

One	c
reasonably	i
priced	i
weeker	i
ticket	c
for	c
all	c
events	c
was	c
excellent	c
because	c
its	i
alway	i
busy	c
for	i
the	c
weekend	c
and	c
people	c
prefer	c
to	c
go	c
any	c
week	i
day	i
.	c

I	c
hope	c
,	i
you	c
will	c
concider	i
about	i
my	c
opinions	c
and	c
my	i
suggestions	c
would	i
be	c
helpful	c
for	c
the	i
next	c
year	c
.	c

Look	i
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Dear	c
Freddie	c

It	c
was	c
very	c
nice	c
to	c
hearing	i
from	c
you	c
.	c

We	c
never	c
like	c
rules	c
,	c
do	c
we	c
?	c

However	c
there	c
are	c
lots	c
of	c
rules	c
in	c
our	c
lives	c
,	c
both	c
at	c
home	c
and	c
at	c
school	c
.	c

We	c
ca	c
n't	c
listen	c
music	i
at	i
class	c
as	i
well	i
.	c

I	i
've	i
to	c
cook	c
myself	i
and	c
worst	i
thing	c
is	c
I	c
'm	c
not	c
allowed	c
to	c
listen	c
loud	i
music	c
in	i
everywhere	i
at	c
home	c
.	c

Love	i
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
happy	c
to	c
spent	i
two	c
weeks	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
in	c
the	c
USA	c
.	c

Yet	c
,	c
I	c
could	c
only	c
travel	c
July	i
because	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
student	c
and	c
so	c
my	c
holidays	c
begin	c
on	i
July	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
rather	c
sleep	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
since	c
I	c
like	c
being	c
near	i
nature	c
and	c
especially	i
singing	i
birds	c
.	c

Thus	i
,	i
I	c
enjoy	c
sports	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
practice	i
swimming	c
and	c
climbing	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
not	c
too	c
bad	c
at	c
these	c
sports	c
.	c

To	c
conclude	c
,	c
will	c
you	c
kindly	c
let	c
my	i
know	c
if	c
I	c
need	c
some	c
money	c
and	c
what	c
sort	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
should	c
bring	c
with	c
me	c
.	c

This	c
year	c
,	c
our	c
English	c
class	c
has	c
decided	c
to	c
make	c
a	c
short	c
video	c
about	c
daily	c
life	c
at	c
our	c
school	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
we	c
should	c
be	c
interested	c
in	c
the	c
other	c
activities	c
such	c
as	c
sports	c
wich	i
could	c
appeal	c
more	i
students	c
in	c
our	c
school	c
.	c

To	c
conclude	c
,	c
in	c
this	c
short	c
video	c
,	c
we	c
must	c
show	c
that	c
thanks	c
to	c
our	c
school	c
we	c
are	c
able	c
to	c
make	i
come	i
out	c
the	c
best	c
of	i
ourselves	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

The	c
show	c
begun	i
45	c
minutes	c
later	c
than	c
supposed	i
!	c

How	c
can	c
you	c
explain	c
that	c
big	c
mistake	c
?	c

At	i
the	i
top	i
of	i
everything	i
,	c
you	c
proposed	i
us	c
to	c
visit	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
really	c
disappointed	c
about	c
this	c
experience	c
.	c

I	c
will	c
not	c
make	c
troubles	i
but	c
I	c
ask	c
you	c
politely	c
my	i
money	c
back	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
,	i
you	c
will	c
agree	c
and	c
share	c
my	c
disappointement	i
.	c

Fashion	c
of	c
the	c
Future	c

In	c
fact	c
,	c
winterseason	i
will	c
be	c
rare	c
or	c
will	c
maybe	c
even	c
disappear	c
.	c

So	c
small	c
that	c
I	c
can	c
imagine	i
,	c
they	c
will	c
be	c
introduce	i
(	c
maybe	c
like	c
chips	c
)	c
in	i
our	c
clothes	c
.	c

Clothes	c
will	c
take	c
a	c
very	c
important	c
place	c
in	c
our	c
future	c
.	c

To	c
:	c
The	c
Principal	c
of	c
Westminster	c
College	c
,	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
with	c
a	c
request	c
for	c
a	c
change	c
in	c
the	c
scedule	i
of	c
our	c
trip	c
to	c
London	c
.	c

Everything	c
seams	c
very	c
interesting	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
sure	c
that	c
we	c
will	c
all	c
have	c
a	c
very	c
good	c
time	c
.	c

That	c
's	c
because	c
the	c
"	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
"	c
takes	c
place	c
that	c
date	i
in	c
London	c
.	c

All	c
of	c
the	c
students	c
-	c
including	c
my	i
self	i
,	i
think	c
of	c
this	c
as	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
that	c
would	i
be	c
pitty	i
to	c
be	i
missed	i
,	c
especially	c
when	c
students	c
can	c
enter	c
for	c
free	c
.	c

My	c
suggestion	c
is	c
to	c
use	c
Wednesday	c
's	c
afternoon	c
free	c
time	c
as	c
an	c
alternative	c
solution	i
of	i
the	c
shopping	c
.	c

This	c
way	c
we	c
will	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
visit	c
the	c
Central	c
Exhibition	c
Hall	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
evening	c
,	c
and	c
see	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
dangerous	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
knew	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
.	c

There	i
were	c
my	c
thoughts	c
when	c
I	c
first	c
saw	c
the	c
advertisement	c
for	c
a	c
"	c
Sky	i
Dive	i
"	c
.	c

The	c
same	c
afternoon	c
I	c
picked	c
up	c
the	c
phone	c
and	c
I	c
gave	c
them	c
a	c
call	c
.	c

The	c
following	c
Sunday	c
I	c
fint	i
my	i
self	i
on	c
a	c
plain	i
flying	c
20000ft	c
from	c
the	c
ground	c
.	c

When	c
the	c
time	c
for	c
the	c
jump	c
came	c
I	c
had	c
some	c
second	c
thoughts	c
.	c

But	c
then	c
,	i
I	c
thought	c
of	c
the	c
birds	c
again	c
-	c
of	c
how	c
nice	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
to	c
share	c
their	c
world	c
for	c
a	c
few	c
minutes	c
and	c
,	i
I	c
jumped	c
!	c

Well	c
,	c
danger	c
is	c
in	c
my	c
nature	c
an	i
Life	c
is	c
nothing	c
but	c
an	c
adventure	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
,	c

On	i
the	c
hall	c
of	i
our	c
classroom	c
we	c
have	c
seen	c
an	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
and	c
we	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
show	c
is	i
it	i
possible	c
.	c

We	c
know	c
that	c
we	c
will	c
spend	c
three	c
days	c
in	c
London	c
in	c
a	c
with	i
a	c
determinate	i
programme	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
we	c
make	i
thanks	i
for	c
the	c
good	i
programme	c
especially	i
for	c
the	i
Science	c
Museum	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
14th	c
About	i
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
we	c
are	i
very	c
excite	i
to	c
go	c
because	c
it	c
's	c
on	i
extravagant	i
and	c
unusual	c
show	c
with	c
leisure	c
,	c
sports	i
wear	i
and	c
hairstyles	c
.	c

As	c
I	c
see	c
your	i
programme	c
the	i
shopping	c
is	i
at	c
the	c
same	c
time	c
of	i
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
so	i
I	c
'll	c
make	c
you	c
a	c
suggestion	c
:	c
we	c
'll	c
start	c
in	c
the	c
morning	c
with	c
the	c
Science	c
Museum	c
and	c
immediately	c
after	c
we	c
'll	c
go	c
to	c
Central	i
Exhibition	c
Hall	c
without	c
doing	c
shopping	i
.	c

It	c
is	c
comfortable	c
,	c
not	c
too	c
big	c
with	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
carpets	c
and	c
antiques	i
components	i
for	i
example	c
potterys	i
,	c
my	c
bed	c
,	c
and	c
a	c
wardrobe	c
of	c
my	c
grandmother	i
.	c

Think	i
people	c
's	c
homes	c
will	c
be	c
different	c
in	c
the	c
future	i
about	i
the	i
new	i
materials	i
of	i
structures	i
,	c
they	c
will	c
have	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
computers	c
for	c
doing	i
recipes	i
and	c
making	i
shopping	i
while	c
you	c
are	c
staying	i
at	c
home	c
.	c

We	c
will	c
have	c
a	c
relaxing	c
room	c
,	c
with	c
soft	c
light	c
,	c
music	i
New	i
Age	i
and	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
essences	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
we	c
ca	c
n't	c
stop	c
the	i
progress	c
but	c
if	c
we	c
want	c
we	c
can	c
conserve	c
traditional	i
things	c
.	c

The	c
home	c
of	c
the	c
future	c
will	c
be	c
very	c
impersonally	i
and	c
the	c
atmosfear	i
will	c
be	c
cold	c
and	c
very	c
essencial	i
.	c

1/3/2000	c

Dear	c
Mr.	c
Robertson	c
.	c

We	c
feel	c
ca	i
n't	c
wait	c
until	c
that	c
time	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
the	c
students	c
in	c
my	c
class	c
,	i
we	i
have	c
seen	c
an	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
which	i
will	c
be	c
on	c
14th	c
March	c
between	c
10.00	c
to	c
19.00	c
at	c
the	c
Central	c
Exhibition	c
Hall	c
,	c
London	c
.	c

What	c
do	c
you	c
think	c
about	c
this	c
plan	c
?	c

We	i
're	i
always	c
want	c
to	c
know	c
about	c
others	c
'	c
life	i
especially	i
the	c
famous	c
one	i
even	c
the	c
one	i
that	c
we	c
hate	c
.	c

Famous	c
people	c
are	c
also	c
the	i
normal	c
people	c
like	c
us	i
just	i
because	c
their	c
jobs	i
are	i
known	i
by	c
every	i
people	i
,	c
it	c
does	c
n't	c
mean	c
that	c
we	c
can	c
invade	c
their	c
privacy	c
.	c

They	c
also	c
want	c
to	c
have	c
special	i
time	c
with	c
their	c
family	c
or	c
their	c
friends	c
.	c

The	c
best	c
way	c
is	c
they	i
,	c
the	c
famous	c
stars	c
and	c
the	c
journalists	c
,	c
should	i
compromise	c
and	c
respect	c
each	c
other	c
's	c
rights	c
.	c

You	c
can	c
imagine	c
how	c
upset	c
I	c
felt	c
,	c
as	c
I	c
really	c
wanted	c
to	c
see	c
his	c
performance	c
.	c

To	c
make	c
matters	c
worse	c
,	c
despite	c
the	c
fact	c
that	c
the	c
second	c
show	c
of	c
the	c
day	c
was	c
scheduled	c
to	c
start	c
from	i
7:30	c
p.m	c
,	i
it	c
started	c
from	i
8:15	c
p.m.	c
What	c
's	c
more	c
,	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
,	c
because	c
the	c
chef	c
suddenly	c
took	c
a	c
day	c
off	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
receiving	c
your	c
response	c
within	c
the	c
next	c
seven	c
days	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

I	c
think	c
this	c
tendancy	i
will	c
become	c
more	c
common	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
express	c
the	c
deserve	i
of	c
all	c
students	i
in	c
my	c
class	c
to	c
visit	c
the	c
LONDON	c
FASHION	c
AND	c
LEISURE	c
SHOW	c
at	c
Central	i
Exhibition	c
Hall	c
,	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
14	c
March	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
will	c
be	c
very	i
good	c
programme	i
.	i

especially	c
the	c
part	c
of	i
the	c
Latest	c
Fashions	c
,	c
because	c
is	i
something	c
which	c
affect	i
the	i
people	c
of	c
all	c
ages	c
today	c
.	c

But	c
also	c
the	c
rest	i
parts	c
of	c
the	c
show	c
seems	i
to	c
be	c
very	c
interesting	c
.	c

The	c
girls	c
are	c
interesting	i
more	i
than	c
boys	c
,	i
For	i
make	i
up	i
and	c
hairstyle	i
.	i

and	c
they	c
want	c
to	c
know	c
all	c
the	c
latest	c
news	c
about	c
these	c
.	i

I	c
know	c
that	c
for	c
Tuesday	c
14	c
March	c
you	c
have	c
already	c
organise	i
the	c
programme	c
which	i
including	i
for	c
morning	i
a	c
visit	c
to	c
Science	i
Museum	c
and	c
For	c
afternoon	i
shopping	c
but	c
we	c
can	c
change	c
that	c
as	c
Follows	c
:	c

Tuesday	c
morning	c
until	c
15.00	c
visit	c
to	c
Science	c
Museum	c

Tuesday	c
afternoon	c
from	c
1600	c
to	c
1900	c
visit	c
to	c
THE	c
LONDON	c
FASHION	c
AND	c
LEISURE	c
SHOW	c
.	c

I	c
am	i
apologise	c
For	c
any	c
incovenience	i
.	i

I	c
think	c
that	c
they	c
have	c
right	i
because	c
,	i
they	c
are	c
also	c
people	c
like	c
me	i
or	i
like	i
you	i
and	c
they	c
should	c
have	c
private	i
life	c
.	c

Private	i
life	c
is	c
very	c
important	c
to	i
anyone	i
,	c
because	c
your	c
job	c
create	i
you	i
stress	c
and	c
you	c
should	c
rest	c
,	i
charge	i
your	c
batteries	c
For	c
the	c
next	c
day	c
.	c

If	c

Miss	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
:	c

I	c
think	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
be	c
in	c
tents	i
,	c
because	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
funnier	i
and	c
you	c
can	c
be	i
in	i
more	c
contact	c
with	c
nature	c
,	i
but	i
if	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
like	c
the	c
tents	c
can	c
I	c
change	c
my	c
mind	c
?	c

You	c
told	c
me	c
to	c
choose	c
2	c
activities	c
and	c
I	c
chose	c
surfing	c
and	c
singing	c
.	c

Please	c
,	c
when	c
you	c
recive	i
this	c
letter	c
give	c
me	c
a	c
call	c
so	c
we	c
can	c
arrange	c
everything	c
.	c

Looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c

CHEMISTRY	c
:	c
We	c
do	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
experiments	c
and	c
the	c
materials	c
we	c
use	c
are	c
very	c
good	c
.	c

We	c
could	c
film	c
it	c
and	c
produce	c
it	c
,	i
instead	i
of	c
uniform	i
we	c
could	c
wear	c
costumes	c
,	i
the	i
ones	c
that	i
are	c
animals	c
could	c
pain	i
their	c
faces	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
if	c
we	c
do	c
it	c
properly	c
we	c
could	c
have	c
a	c
great	c
spanish	i
play	c
.	c

Those	c
three	c
classes	c
are	c
my	c
choises	i
,	i
I	c
hope	c
we	c
could	i
do	c
them	c
and	c
make	c
a	c
very	c
good	c
video	c
about	c
our	c
school	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
some	c
problems	c
I	c
had	c
when	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
two	c
weeks	c
ago	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
were	c
supposed	c
to	c
perform	c
in	c
the	c
show	c
but	c
instead	c
of	c
them	c
different	c
actors	c
performed	c
badly	i
.	c

The	c
Theatre	c
also	c
promised	c
discounts	c
,	c
which	c
were	c
not	c
available	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
pay	c
the	c
full	c
amount	c
.	c

I	c
also	c
wanted	c
to	c
visit	c
the	c
Theatre	c
Restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
but	c
it	i
was	c
impossible	c
because	c
it	c
closed	c
at	c
20:30	c
and	c
the	c
show	c
finished	c
at	c
21:00	c

Finaly	i
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
£	i
20	c
back	c
as	c
I	c
was	c
not	c
satisfied	c
with	c
your	c
services	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
not	c
like	c
to	c
take	c
legal	c
action	c
,	c
as	c
it	c
would	c
not	c
be	c
convenient	c
for	c
both	i
of	c
us	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
will	c
if	c
I	c
consider	c
it	c
necessary	c
.	c

I	c
will	c
be	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Last	c
weekend	c
in	i
the	c
Local	c
Festival	c
,	c
that	i
is	c
held	c
every	c
year	c
in	c
our	c
Town	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
walking	c
with	c
my	c
little	c
sister	c
,	c
who	c
is	c
three	c
years	c
old	c
.	c

She	c
started	c
running	c
and	c
got	c
lost	c
.	c

When	c
Mr	c
Smythe	c
saw	c
me	c
there	c
,	c
he	c
told	c
me	c
:	c
"	c
If	c
you	c
say	c
a	c
word	c
you	c
're	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
in	c
serious	c
trouble.	c
"	c

We	c
were	c
at	c
school	c
when	c
she	c
told	c
me	c
this	c
and	c
Mr	c
Smythe	c
went	c
to	c
our	c
class	c
and	c
said	c
to	c
me	c
"	i
May	c
I	c
talk	c
to	c
you	c
?	c
"	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
some	c
further	c
information	c
about	c
the	c
competition	c
I	c
won	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
sleep	c
in	c
an	i
log	c
cabin	c
.	c

The	c
two	c
activities	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
choose	c
are	c
:	i
Photography	i
and	c
Surfing	i
.	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

How	c
are	c
you	c
?	c

I	c
had	c
to	c
help	c
back	i
stages	i
.	c

The	c
realy	i
thing	c
was	c
that	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
look	c
after	c
them	c
because	c
without	c
me	c
they	c
would	c
have	c
been	c
lost	c
.	c

I	c
also	c
had	c
to	c
give	c
them	c
drinks	c
and	c
food	c
and	c
help	c
them	c
to	c
relax	c
whenever	c
they	c
were	c
nervous	c
.	c

Afterwards	c
they	c
talk	i
to	c
me	c
and	c
thanking	i
me	c
for	c
helping	c
them	c
in	c
those	c
exciting	c
moments	c
.	c

I	c
realy	i
got	c
to	c
know	c
them	c
after	c
the	c
concert	c
.	c

They	c
also	c
took	c
me	c
to	c
a	i
after	i
hour	i
party	c
and	c
they	c
asked	c
me	c
if	c
would	i
like	c
to	c
do	c
this	c
again	c
.	c

Mabey	i
next	c
time	c
you	c
can	c
come	c
with	c
me	i
that	i
would	c
be	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
fun	c
.	c

The	i
will	c
call	c
me	c
next	c
week	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
write	i
when	c
I	c
talk	i
to	c
them	c
.	c

Talk	c
to	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

Finaly	i
,	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
understand	c
why	c
you	c
pushed	c
people	c
to	c
visit	c
your	c
restaurant	c
if	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
open	c
it	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
!	c

I	c
am	c
sure	c
you	c
will	c
understand	c
my	c
request	c
regarding	c
my	c
complaint	c
,	c
your	c
credibility	c
is	c
depending	c
of	i
.	i

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
earing	i
from	c
you	c
.	c

Since	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
the	c
40's	c
which	i
is	c
the	c
period	c
where	i
the	i
technology	c
started	c
,	i
nobody	c
can	c
say	c
that	c
nothing	c
has	c
changed	c
.	c

In	c
fact	c
our	c
life	i
style	i
is	c
based	c
on	c
the	i
technology	c
,	c
now	c
,	c
if	c
we	c
want	c
to	c
stay	c
at	c
home	c
without	c
having	c
contact	c
with	c
other	c
people	c
,	c
we	c
can	c
do	c
it	c
,	c
we	c
just	c
need	c
a	c
computer	c
and	c
a	c
modem	c
and	c
that	c
's	c
it	c
.	c

If	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
discuss	c
with	i
friends	c
or	c
order	c
a	c
Pizza	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
do	c
it	c
easely	i
as	c
I	c
want	c
,	c
when	c
it	i
want	c
.	c

If	c
I	c
compare	c
my	c
life	c
now	c
with	c
the	c
life	c
of	c
my	c
grand	i
parents	i
,	c
I	c
think	c
both	c
are	c
comparable	c
,	i
I	c
say	c
that	c
because	c
without	c
knowing	c
the	i
technology	c
,	c
it	c
's	c
difficult	c
to	c
imagine	c
a	c
best	i
life	c
,	c
in	c
fact	c
,	c
you	c
leave	i
with	i
your	i
time	i
.	c

Even	c
if	c
the	i
technology	c
is	c
important	c
for	c
my	c
quality	c
of	c
life	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
not	c
able	c
to	c
say	c
if	c
it	i
will	c
continue	c
to	c
be	c
the	c
case	c
in	c
10	c
years	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
my	c
classmates	c
and	c
I	c
also	c
found	c
another	c
fascinating	c
thing	c
about	c
the	c
trip	c
.	c

It	c
must	i
be	i
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
show	c
because	c
we	c
are	c
keen	c
on	c
fashions	c
and	c
clothes	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
,	c
students	c
can	c
go	c
without	c
paying	c
any	c
fees	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
be	c
grateful	c
,	i
if	c
you	c
could	c
understand	i
our	c
concern	c
and	c
change	c
the	c
programme	c
on	c
14th	c
of	c
March	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	i
,	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
they	c
should	c
accept	c
the	c
fact	c
that	c
they	c
are	c
well-known	i
and	c
they	c
should	c
be	c
observed	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
,	c
as	c
we	c
are	c
curious	c
to	c
know	c
what	c
they	c
do	c
and	c
we	c
love	c
to	c
gossip	c
about	c
others	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
it	c
might	c
be	c
a	c
good	c
thing	c
that	c
scandales	i
usually	c
increase	c
their	c
fame	c
,	c
even	c
if	c
they	c
did	i
anything	i
wrong	c
.	c

It	c
does	c
not	c
seem	c
possible	c
that	c
we	c
can	c
live	c
without	c
any	c
private	c
life	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
Carlos	c
Gregore	c
and	c
during	c
my	c
last	c
holiday	c
I	c
stayed	c
in	c
London	c
for	c
a	c
week	c
.	c

Then	i
,	i
I	c
read	c
the	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
show	c
of	i
your	c
theatre	c
and	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
see	c
it	c
.	c

An	c
actor	c
was	c
changed	c
and	c
the	c
pubblic	i
were	c
no	i
informated	i
.	c

The	c
show	c
started	c
45	c
minuts	i
late	c
without	c
valid	i
reasons	c
!	c

There	c
were	c
no	c
discounts	c
available	c
like	c
the	c
advertisement	i
had	i
written	i
.	c

At	i
the	i
end	i
,	c
the	c
theatre	c
resturant	i
was	c
closed	c
for	c
holiday	i
!	c

At	c
the	c
bottom	c
of	c
the	c
advertisement	c
was	c
wrote	i
:	c

I	c
also	c
think	c
I	c
am	c
lucky	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
live	c
in	c
a	c
period	c
of	c
tecnologic	i
boom	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
last	c
fifty	c
years	c
the	i
human	c
tecnologies	i
are	i
growed	i
up	i
exponensially	i
.	c

My	c
daily	c
life	c
should	c
be	c
changed	c
by	c
these	c
innovations	c
!	c

At	i
the	c
present	c
day	c
,	c
for	c
ecsample	i
,	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
people	c
have	c
a	c
personal	c
computer	c
at	c
home	c
,	c
and	c
a	c
very	c
big	i
part	i
of	c
that	i
have	i
also	i
internet	i
,	c
the	c
new	c
frontier	c
of	c
computers	i
evolution	c
.	c

If	c
I	c
look	c
back	c
in	i
the	c
past	c
I	c
can	i
find	c
that	c
computer	i
is	c
following	c
the	c
same	c
street	i
of	i
television	c
,	c
telephon	i
and	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
other	c
things	c
,	i
that	c
now	c
the	c
biggest	i
part	c
of	c
population	i
have	c
at	c

HERBERTO	c

12th	c
December	c
2000	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
suggest	c
you	i
how	c
the	c
programm	i
could	c
be	c
changed	c
.	c

Instead	c
of	c
a	c
shopping	c
tour	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
afternoon	c
we	i
could	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
show	c
and	c
do	c
the	c
shopping	c
on	c
Wedensday	i
afternoon	c
in	c
our	c
free	c
time	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
will	c
unterstand	i
this	i
kind	i
of	i
matter	i
and	c
the	c
class	c
and	c
I	c
looking	i
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	i
,	c

First	i
point	c
we	i
will	c
use	c
more	c
often	c
new	c
technologies	c
like	c
telecommunication	i
or	c
internet	i
.	c

In	c
the	c
future	c
they	i
both	i
getting	i
closer	i
and	i
closer	i
.	c

Your	c
freezer	c
tells	c
you	c
when	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
buy	c
some	c
milk	c
,	c
eggs	c
or	c
chees	i
.	c

Or	c
never	i
living	i
the	c
office	c
you	i
are	c
able	c
to	c
heat	c
the	c
wather	i
for	c
a	c
hot	c
bath	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
also	c
housewifes	i
will	c
receive	c
more	c
help	c
with	c
a	c
robotor	i
in	c
the	c
household	i
.	c

And	c
of	c
course	c
the	c
furnitures	i
of	c
people	c
's	c
home	i
will	c
not	c
change	c
as	i
well	i
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
I	c
could	c
not	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
because	c
,	c
by	c
the	c
time	c
the	c
show	c
had	c
finished	c
,	c
it	c
had	c
already	c
closed	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

She	c
was	c
a	c
very	c
pretty	c
and	c
kind	c
girl	c
,	c
but	c
she	c
had	c
this	c
bad	c
habit	c
.	c

The	c
day	c
of	c
the	c
party	c
arrived	c
and	c
Pat	c
succeeded	c
in	c
keeping	c
the	c
secret	c
.	c

My	c
name	c
is	c
Gabriel	c
and	c
I	c
represented	i
our	c
class	c
.	c

The	i
Monday	c
13	c
March	c
would	i
be	i
fine	i
.	c

It	c
will	i
be	i
beutiful	i
if	c
you	c
would	c
agree	c
to	c
change	c
your	c
plan	c
.	c

The	c
last	c
day	c
,	c
the	i
Wednesday	c
15	c
March	c
will	i
surely	c
very	i
interesting	c
because	c
the	c
National	c
Art	c
Gallery	c
is	c
very	i
famous	c
place	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

It	c
was	c
dangerous	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
knew	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
it.	c
,	i

It	c
happened	c
on	c
a	c
very	c
lovly	i
day	c
in	c
summer	c
.	c

The	c
most	c
important	c
things	i
was	c
a	c
little	c
boy	c
about	i
ten	c
years	c
old	c
,	c
who	c
was	c
in	c
the	c
watter	i
without	c
parents	i
and	c
could	c
n't	c
swimm	i
.	c

Now	c
,	c
when	c
I	c
consider	c
about	i
the	c
events	c
it	i
's	c
clear	c
for	i
me	c
that	c
if	c
I	c
got	c
a	i
few	c
minutes	c
later	c
probably	i
would	i
be	i
to	i
late	c
.	c

You	c
should	c
ignore	c
the	c
dangerous	i
if	c
you	c
convince	i
you	c
can	c
save	c
somebody	i
his	i
live	i

Dear	c
Ms	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
the	c
person	c
who	c
won	c
your	c
competition	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
writing	c
in	c
reply	c
to	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
travel	c
only	c
in	c
july	i
because	c
that	c
is	c
the	c
only	c
time	c
when	c
I	c
am	c
free	c
from	c
my	c
examinations	c
.	c

I	c
prefer	c
staying	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
as	c
I	c
am	c
used	c
to	c
it	c
and	c
find	c
it	c
more	c
comfortable	c
.	c

The	c
two	c
activities	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
do	c
in	c
the	c
camp	c
are	c
swimming	c
and	c
photography	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
a	c
good	c
swimmer	c
and	c
I	c
had	i
some	c
expirience	i
in	c
photography	i
however	i
I	i
have	c
very	i
much	i
to	c
learn	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
got	c
two	c
questions	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
.	c

The	c
main	c
job	c
of	c
the	c
head	c
of	c
the	c
computing	c
department	c
is	c
not	c
to	c
teach	c
but	c
to	c
keep	c
the	c
computers	c
working	c
properly	c
.	c

Maths	c
is	c
the	c
most	c
popular	c
subject	c
in	c
the	c
school	c
.	c

The	c
teacher	c
looks	c
after	c
the	c
pupil	i
while	c
they	c
are	c
investigating	c
the	c
topic	c
of	c
the	c
lesson	c
.	c

Kitchen	i
staff	c
works	c
hard	c
to	c
provide	c
students	c
with	c
variety	i
of	c
food	c
.	c

The	c
video	c
can	c
be	i
finished	i
with	c
a	c
view	c
of	c
the	c
school	c
from	c
outside	c
.	c

Dear	c
madame	i
Jane	c
Clark	c
,	c

I	c
was	c
there	c
two	i
days	c
enjoying	c
it	c
and	c
have	c
found	c
some	c
points	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
change	c
to	c
make	c
it	c
a	c
better	c
one	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

I	c
personally	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
idea	c
to	c
gather	c
all	c
different	c
types	c
of	c
arts	c
from	c
all	c
over	c
the	c
world	c
.	c

Well	c
,	c
here	c
are	c
some	c
of	c
my	c
opinion	i
and	c
suggestions	c
.	c

The	c
jazz	c
,	c
rock	c
and	c
classical	c
concerts	c
were	c
really	c
entertaining	c
except	c
that	c
there	c
were	c
some	c
concert	c
halls	c
to	i
small	c
for	c
the	c
audience	c
:	c
I	c
'm	c
sure	c
that	c
you	c
can	c
find	c
bigger	c
halls	c
for	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

By	c
the	c
way	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
also	c
wondering	c
if	c
it	c
was	c
possible	c
to	c
have	c
more	c
plays	c
and	c
films	c
for	c
the	c
coming	c
up	i
festival	c
as	c
the	c
reaction	c
of	c
the	c
people	c
was	c
excellent	c
.	c

Actually	c
,	c
the	c
price	c
of	c
the	c
weekend	c
ticket	c
was	c
excellent	c
!	c

Well	c
,	c
I	c
hope	c
you	c
found	c
my	c
suggestions	c
reasonable	c
as	c
I	c
deeply	c
congratulate	c
for	i
the	c
great	c
sucess	i
in	i
the	c
festival	c
.	c

Hello	c
!	c

Well	c
,	c
in	c
the	c
letter	c
you	c
wrote	c
me	c
,	c
you	c
asked	c
some	c
questions	c
about	c
school	c
and	c
house	c
rules	c
.	c

Even	c
though	c
,	i
I	c
do	c
have	c
less	c
than	c
you	c
,	c
I	i
'm	i
still	i
willing	i
to	c
change	c
many	c
things	c
.	c

You	c
must	c
have	c
a	i
permission	c
to	c
get	c
out	c
of	c
your	c
seat	c
or	c
leave	c
the	c
classroom	c
.	c

My	c
school	c
's	c
an	c
American	c
school	c
so	c
you	c
're	c
not	c
supposed	c
to	c
talk	c
in	c
Spanish	c
during	c
the	c
classes	c
either	c
.	c

My	c
parents	c
do	c
n't	c
really	c
like	c
putting	i
rules	c
in	c
the	c
house	c
.	c

But	c
it	c
existed	i
since	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
young	c
.	c

I	c
miss	c
you	c
and	c
let	c
's	c
keep	c
in	c
touch	c
.	c

Bye.	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
the	c
good	c
news	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
price	i
in	c
your	c
competition	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
delighted	c
and	c
already	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
spending	c
two	c
weeks	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
in	c
the	c
U.S.A.	c
.	i

As	c
regards	c
the	c
time	c
that	c
I	c
can	c
travel	c
I	i
must	c
tell	c
you	c
that	c
my	c
holidays	c
at	c
university	c
are	c
only	c
in	c
July	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
do	c
surfing	c
and	c
photography	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
a	c
total	c
beginner	c
in	c
both	c
activities	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
these	c
two	c
weeks	c
will	c
be	c
a	c
good	c
opportunity	c
to	c
learn	c
something	c
about	c
them	c
.	c

Finally	c
I	i
have	i
also	i
some	c
questions	c
to	i
you	c
.	c

Firstly	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
will	c
be	c
appropriate	c
for	c
the	c
camp	c
,	c
secondly	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
should	c
take	c
with	c
me	c
for	c
the	c
two	c
weeks	c
and	c
lastly	c
if	c
there	c
are	c
any	c
possibilies	i
for	c
cooking	c
.	c

But	c
there	i
occure	i
also	i
problems	i
if	c
there	c
are	c
products	c
left	c
:	c
either	c
you	c
ca	c
n't	c
decide	c
between	c
two	c
things	c
or	c
your	c
favourite	c
product	c
is	c
too	c
expensive	c
.	c

You	c
have	c
to	c
wait	c
at	i
a	c
long	c
queue	c
for	c
more	c
than	c
15	c
minutes	c
.	c

So	c
even	c
if	c
it	c
's	c
nice	c
to	c
have	c
food	c
or	c
new	c
clothes	c
at	c
home	c
,	c
without	c
patience	c
,	c
time	c
and	c
straingth	i
you	c
should	i
better	c
stay	c
at	c
home	c
or	c
try	c
to	c
find	c
the	c
most	c
convenient	c
time	c
for	c
shopping	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Clark	c
:	c

All	c
my	c
family	c
liked	c
the	c
films	c
and	c
the	c
plays	c
that	c
there	c
were	c
very	c
much	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
personaly	i
think	c
that	c
It	i
would	c
be	c
better	c
to	c
add	c
more	c
because	c
there	c
were	c
only	c
five	c
plays	c
and	c
seven	c
films	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
you	i
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerelly	i

2	c
Desember	i
2000	i

In	c
your	c
letter	c
you	c
told	i
me	c
something	c
about	c
rules	c
.	c

I	c
imagine	c
that	c
you	c
want	c
my	c
opinion	c
for	i
your	c
homework	c
?	c

Do	c
n't	c
you	c
?	c

You	c
know	c
that	c
I	c
'm	c
studing	i
in	c
a	c
hard	i
school	c
,	c
and	c
as	c
you	c
can	c
imagine	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
work	c
hard	c
and	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
do	c
homework	c
everyday	i
.	c

The	c
other	c
day	c
I	c
arrived	c
five	c
minutes	c
late	c
and	c
the	c
teacher	c
ordered	c
me	c
to	c
go	c
home	c
.	c

?	i

She	c
might	c
be	c
crazy	c

I	c
have	c
friends	c
that	c
are	c
studing	i
in	c
other	c
schools	c
and	c
they	c
are	c
very	c
happy	c
with	c
their	c
freedom	c
.	c

they	i
let	c
me	c
go	c
out	c
with	c
my	c
friends	c
every	c
day	c
,	c
but	c
they	c
make	c
me	c
do	c
homework	c
and	c
I	c
hate	c
this	i
!	c
!	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
;	i

However	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
as	i
well	i
,	i
that	i
the	i
class	i
would	i
like	i
to	i
visit	i
"	i
The	i
London	i
Fashion	i
and	i
Leisure	i
Show	i
"	i
,	c
is	i
on	c
Tuesday	c
from	c
10.00	c
AM	i
until	c
19.00	c
pm.	c
They	c
do	c
n't	c
need	c
to	c
pay	c
.	c

In	i
addition	i
,	i
I	c
think	c
is	i
a	c
good	c
a	c
idea	c
,	c
because	c
they	c
could	c
go	c
after	i
shopping	i
,	c
when	c
they	c
have	c
a	i
free	c
time	c
,	i
I	c
am	c
sure	c
about	c
that	c
,	c
they	c
will	c
like	i
to	c
visit	c
that	c
place	c
.	c

However	i
,	i
the	i
programme	c
could	c
be	c
changed	c
just	c
for	c
a	c
few	c
hours	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
for	c
everybody	c
.	c

Your	i
faithfully	i

My	c
personal	c
opinion	c
about	c
famous	c
people	c
,	c
is	c
good	i
in	c
one	c
way	c
and	c
bad	c
in	c
another	c
way	c
.	c

To	c
the	c
manager	c
of	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
.	c

You	c
wrote	c
that	c
discounts	c
available	i
but	c
they	c
are	i
not	c
available	c
.	c

but	c
the	c
reastaurant	i
was	c
closed	c
because	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
20:15	i
and	c
finissed	i
at	c
00.15	c
and	c
the	c
restaurant	c
was	c
opened	i
until	c
00.00	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

I	c
know	i
that	c
before	c
but	c
I	c
thought	c
that	c
he	c
may	i
change	i
.	c

I	c
trusted	c
him	c
and	c
told	c
about	i
the	c
reality	i
.	c

It	c
was	c
about	c
Marine	c
,	c
who	c
was	c
our	c
clase	i
friends	i
.	c

The	c
reality	c
was	c
Marine	i
's	c
parents	c
are	i
not	c
her	c
real	c
parents	c
,	c
they	c
found	c
her	c
in	c
their	c
houses	i
garden	c
.	c

They	c
try	i
so	c
many	c
things	c
to	c
find	c
her	c
family	i
for	i
one	i
year	c
they	c
did	c
everything	c
to	c
find	c
her	c
family	c
but	c
they	c
could	c
n't	c
find	c
.	i

and	c
he	c
added	c
that	c
he	c
leave	i
Marine	c
because	c
her	c
mother	c
was	i
dead	i
two	c
days	c
after	c
Marine	c
's	c
birth	c
.	i

The	i
Marine	c
's	c
real	c
father	c
want	i
her	c
back	c
but	c
the	c
other	c
cuples	i
did	c
n't	c
want	c
to	c
give	c
her	c
because	i
they	c
loved	c
Marine	c
so	c
much	c
.	c

After	c
I	c
told	c
the	i
reality	i

about	i
suggesting	i
which	c
lessons	c

and	c
why	c
are	i
suitable	c
to	c

EXPLAIN	c

Most	c
of	c
the	c

taking	c
a	c

for	c
3	c
hours	c

see	c
a	c
musical	c
show	c
"	i
Over	c

and	i
had	c
a	c
very	c
disappointing	c
evening	c

When	c
the	c
show	c
finished	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
too	c
late	c
to	c
catch	c
the	c
train	c
to	i
home	c

I	c
had	c
to	c
take	c
taxi	i

It	c
costed	i
me	c
£	c
30	c

One	c
more	c
thing	c
,	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
when	c
I	c
get	i
there	c
for	c
a	c
glass	i
of	i
drink	c
,	i
I	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
why	c
,	i
there	i
was	c
no	c
written	i
notes	i
or	c
information	c
about	c
that	c

Would	c
you	c
consider	c
to	i
give	i
my	i
money	c
back	c
?	c

I	c
would	i
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
as	c
soon	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Pat	c
is	c
one	c
of	c
my	c
colleges	i
in	i
the	c
office	c
.	c

She	c
works	c
with	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
still	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
how	c
it	c
really	c
happens	i
to	c
him	c
.	c

All	c
I	c
know	c
is	c
about	i
drug	c
smuggling	c
,	c
that	i
he	c
involved	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	i
private	c
person	c
.	c

Yesterday	c
morning	c
,	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
toilet	i
,	i
I	c
overherd	i
two	c
people	c
talking	c
about	c
my	c
son	c
I	i
felt	c
pity	i
on	i
myself	c
and	c
I	c
burst	c
into	c
tears	c
.	c

I	c
quickly	c
got	c
out	c
of	c
toilet	i
.	c

Nowadays	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
hard	c
to	c
trust	c
people	c
.	c

Everybody	c
make	i
mistakes	c
.	c

I	c
decided	c
to	c
forgive	c
my	c
friend	c
Pat	c

June	c
17th	c
2000	c

I	c
went	c
in	i
London	c
for	c
a	c
week	c
of	c
"	c
pure	c
holiday	c
"	c
thinking	i
to	i
have	i
some	c
fun	c
coming	i
to	c
see	c
your	c
musical	c
show	c
.	c

On	i
the	c
advertisement	c
it	c
had	i
been	i
written	c
that	c
there	i
would	i
have	i
been	i
Danny	i
Brook	i
too	c
.	c

(	c
I	c
like	c
him	c
very	c
much	c
and	c
,	c
truly	i
,	c
I	c
came	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
just	c
to	c
see	c
him	c
)	c

I	c
have	i
waited	i
for	c
the	c
show	c
beginning	i
until	c
20:15	c
!	c
!	c
!	c
!	c

BUT.	c
.	c

when	c
I	c
saw	c
that	c
the	c
actor	c
was	c
n't	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
but	c
a	c
different	c
one	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
disappointed	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	i
to	c
have	c
a	c
good	c
meal	c
in	c
the	c
"	c
famous	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
"	c
(	c
that	i
,	c
of	c
course	c
,	c
was	c
closed	c
for	c
a	c
free	i
night	i
!	c
!	c
!	c
!	c
)	c

At	i
the	c
end	c
,	c
I	c
asked	c
for	c
money	i
back	c
(	c
and	c
paiment	i
for	c
my	c
orrible	i
night	c
)	c
:	c
do	c
you	c
think	c
anybody	c
give	i
me	c
back	i
something	i
?	c
!	c

I	c
hope	c
,	c
that	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
,	c
you	c
will	c
understand	c
that	c
it	c
is	c
n't	c
right	c
to	c
write	c
false	c
things	c
on	i
an	c
advertisement	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
attention	c
.	c

Faithfully	c

Science	c
and	c
technology	c
characterize	c
our	c
moder	i
society	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
think	c
that	c
fifty	c
years	c
ago	c
,	c
when	c
there	c
were	c
n't	c
cars	c
or	c
any	c
sort	c
of	c
comfort	i
(	c
born	c
just	c
in	c
the	c
"	c
industrial	c
age	c
"	c
)	c
everything	c
had	c
to	c
be	c
done	c
by	c
hands	i
or	c
by	c
animal	c
work	i
:	c
I	c
think	c
in	i
that	c
time	c
life	c
was	c
really	c
harder	i
than	c
now	c
!	c

We	c
have	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
technological	c
searches	i
have	c
taken	i
in	i
our	c
society	c
"	c
their	c
good	c
fruits	c
"	c
but	c
,	c
at	c
the	c
same	c
time	c
,	c
negative	i
aspects	c
too	c
.	c

Walking	c
on	c
a	c
city	c
street	c
,	c
it	c
's	c
difficult	c
to	c
find	c
parks	c
or	c
"	c
green	c
"	c
places	c
with	c
trees	c
and	c
clean	c
air	c
:	c
actually	c
pollution	c
,	c
traffic	c
and	c
noize	i
are	c
the	c
main	c
problems	c
of	c
our	c
society	c
.	c

But	c
,	c
sometimes	c
I	c
ask	c
myself	c
if	c
the	c
"	c
ancient	c
world	c
"	c
,	c
without	c
science	c
,	c
technological	c
discoveries	i
and	c
industries	c
was	c
more	c
authentic	c
than	c
the	i
our	c
one	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
concerning	c
our	i
three	c
days	c
which	c
we	c
are	c
going	c
to	c
spend	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

It	c
sounds	c
very	c
promissing	i
.	c

We	c
have	c
seen	c
an	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
and	c
we	c
all	i
would	i
like	c
to	c
go	c
there	c
.	c

So	c
that	c
we	c
can	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
Fashion	c
Show	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
dangerous	c
but	c
I	c
knew	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
.	c

The	c
moment	c
I	c
saw	c
the	c
advertisement	c
about	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
seven	i
world	i
wonders	i
,	c
I	c
knew	c
,	i
I	c
had	c
to	c
see	c
it	c
.	c

But	c
this	c
was	c
also	c
the	c
moment	c
when	c
my	c
nightmare	c
started	c
to	c
come	c
alive	i
.	c

My	c
friend	c
and	c
I	c
had	c
just	c
arrived	c
at	c
a	c
small	c
airport	c
in	c
the	c
middle	c
of	c
the	c
Californian	c
desert	c
.	c

One	i
man	c
came	c
out	c
from	c
a	c
small	c
building	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
our	c
pilot	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
horrible	c
.	c

I	c
thought	c
we	c
would	c
die	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
amazing	c
.	c

So	c
in	i
Camp	c
California	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
keep	c
me	i
on	i
touching	i
to	i
these	c
areas	c
.	c

There	c
is	c
joy	c
in	c
shopping	c
when	c
it	c
is	c
made	i
by	c
ourselves	c
to	i
ourselves	c
.	c

It	i
means	c
buying	c
whatever	c
we	c
like	c
,	c
just	i
like	c
clothes	c
,	c
records	c
,	c
rings	c
,	c
and	c
books	c
.	c

What	c
we	c
like	c
is	c
based	c
in	i
our	c
relationship	i
to	i
another	i
people	c
,	c
in	i
the	i
work	c
or	c
in	c
the	c
family	c
.	c

A	c
death	c
in	c
the	c
family	c
is	c
not	i
also	i
an	c
enjoyable	c
shopping	c
experience	c
,	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
the	i
highest	i
point	i
of	i
the	i
sickness	i
.	c

Giving	i
examples	c
:	c
we	i
are	c
healthy	c
we	c
buy	c
clothes	c
and	c
Records	c
,	c
we	c
enjoy	c
ourselves	c
;	c
we	i
are	c
sick	c
,	c
or	c
our	c
relatives	c
,	i
we	c
buy	c
medicines	c
we	i
not	i
enjoy	c
ourselves	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
an	c
obligation	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
organising	c
this	c
event	c
was	c
a	c
great	c
idea	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
pleased	c
when	c
I	c
read	c
your	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
festival	c
.	c

One	c
reasonably-priced	c
weekend	c
ticket	c
for	c
all	c
events	c
was	c
also	c
an	c
excellent	c
idea	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
also	c
like	c
to	c
suggest	c
you	i
to	i
try	i
and	c
make	c
more	c
plays	c
and	c
films	c
available	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

I	c
'm	c
sorry	c
for	c
not	c
having	c
written	c
earlier	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
've	c
had	c
an	c
exhausting	c
exam	c
session	c
at	c
school	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
very	c
interesting	c
to	c
hear	c
about	c
rules	i
in	c
England	c
.	c

The	c
rules	c
in	c
Poland	c
are	c
quite	c
similar	c
to	c
those	c
discribed	i
in	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

We	c
are	c
not	c
allowed	c
to	c
talk	c
during	c
the	i
lesson	i
and	c
we	c
have	c
to	c
do	c
our	c
homework	c
every	c
day	c
.	c

All	c
the	c
things	c
we	c
're	c
not	c
allowed	c
to	c
do	c
depend	c
on	c
them	c
.	c

Has	c
your	c
dog	c
already	i
recovered	i
?	c

Lots	c
of	c
love	c
,	c

I	c
'm	c
a	c
student	c
from	c
St.	c
Petersburg	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
'm	c
studing	i
in	c
a	c
theatre	i
acodimy	i
.	c

Also	c
we	c
expected	c
to	c
get	i
a	i
discounts	i
as	c
a	c
students	c
,	c
but	c
international	c
students	c
cards	c
are	c
not	i
available	i
in	c
your	i
theater	i
(	c
that	c
is	c
very	c
strange	c
-	c
even	c
your	i
advertisment	i
has	i
an	c
information	c
about	c
discounts	c
)	c
.	c

Another	c
problem	c
-	c
we	c
were	c
very	c
hungry	c
that	c
evening	c
because	c
the	c
show	c
was	i
postpone	i
45	c
minutes	i
!	c
so	c
we	c
were	c
late	i
to	c
our	c
supper	c
in	c
the	c
hotel	c
and	i
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
also	c
closed	c
without	c
any	i
risons	i
.	c

In	c
the	c
advertisment	i
it	i
was	i
written	i
,,your	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
!	c
"	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
.	c

And	c
I	c
think	c
,	c
I	i
prooved	i
you	i
this	i
.	c

I	c
'm	c
waiting	c
for	c
your	c
anser	i
and	c
hope	c
I	c
can	c
get	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
!	c

It	c
is	c
very	c
intresting	i
for	c
me	c
how	i
new	i
works	i
,	c
there	i
possiblyties	i
.	c

My	c
job	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
is	c
a	c
good	c
way	c
to	c
become	i
a	c
profesion	i
in	c
the	c
future	c
.	c

More	c
and	c
more	c
people	c
buing	i
mobile	c
phones	c
,	c
because	c
it	i
is	i
very	c
usefull	i
,	c
you	i
get	i
a	i
lot	i
of	i
possiblyties	i
like	c
:	c
use	i
an	i
internet	i
,	c
buy	i
different	c
goods	c
,	c
book	i
tickets	c
,	c
control	i
your	i
home	i
technic	i
and	c
many	c
authers	i
.	c

Mobile	c
communication	c
is	c
a	c
key	c
to	c
sucsess	i
in	c
all	c
professions	c
that	c
we	c
have	c
!	c

And	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
I	c
made	c
a	i
right	c
choice	c
in	i
the	i
profession	c
-	c
it	c
is	c
perfect	i
combination	c
:	c
very	i
progressiv	i
way	i
of	c
a	i
modern	c
technology	c
,	c
and	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
thing	c
-	c
it	c
is	c
extremly	i
interesting	c
for	i
me	c
!	c

I	c
'm	c
very	c
happy	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
.	c

You	c
ask	c
me	c
when	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
?	c

I	c
can	c
travel	c
only	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
I	c
have	i
holidays	i
from	i
my	i
work	i
only	i
in	c
this	c
month	c
.	c

So	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
very	c
nice	c
,	i
if	c
it	i
's	i
possible	c
.	c

Then	c
the	c
activities	c
that	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
do	c
are	c
Singing	i
and	c
Swimming	i
.	c

Another	c
reason	c
for	c
swimming	i
is	c
that	c
I	c
'm	c
good	c
at	c
it	c
because	c
a	c
few	c
years	c
ago	c
I	c
had	c
lessons	c
,	c
where	c
I	c
learn	i
very	i
good	i
swimming	i
.	c

Finaly	i
I	c
've	c
got	c
a	c
question	c
:	c
What	c
clothes	c
must	c
I	c
bring	c
with	c
me	c
and	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
?	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
hearing	i
from	c
you	c
.	c

Sometimes	c
it	c
is	c
n't	c
so	c
easy	c
to	c
find	c
what	c
you	c
need	c
.	c

Now	c
you	c
will	i
by	i
it	c
but	c
it	c
's	c
nowhere	c
to	c
find	i
!	c

That	c
's	c
a	c
pity	c
!	c

Sometimes	c
it	c
's	c
very	i
awful	c
when	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
wait	c
very	i
long	c
until	i
it	c
's	c
your	c
turn	c
to	c
pay	c
or	c
to	c
try	c
some	c
clothes	c
on	c
.	c

Another	c
thing	c
that	c
makes	c
you	c
fourious	i
,	i
is	c
when	c
you	c
see	c
a	c
great	c
shirt	c
in	c
shop	i
and	c
somebody	c
else	c
take	i
it	c
away	c
or	c
buy	i
it	c
before	c
you	c
can	c
react	c
.	c

So	c
you	c
see	c
that	c
shopping	c
is	c
n't	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

The	c
name	c
of	c
the	c
event	c
,	c
International	c
Arts	c
Festival	c
,	c
is	c
great	i
idea	c
actually	c
,	c
but	c
there	c
were	c
stars	c
and	c
artists	c
only	i
from	i
six	c
countries	c
apart	i
from	i
your	i
advertisement	i
.	c

I	c
suppose	c
more	c
countries	c
are	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
informed	c
even	c
during	c
and	c
after	c
the	c
events	c
.	c

As	c
well	c
as	c
that	c
,	c
I	i
expect	i
you	i
plays	i
and	i
films	i
are	i
performed	i
more	i
.	c

It	c
is	c
a	i
excellent	c
price	c
because	c
when	c
I	c
am	c
tempt	i
to	c
watch	c
some	c
festivals	c
,	c
obviously	c
it	c
costs	c
much	c
more	c
money	c
.	c

I	c
expect	c
you	c
can	i
be	c
organised	i
even	i
better	i
next	c
year	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Becoming	c
more	c
strict	c
gradually	c
at	c
home	c
that	c
at	c
school	c
is	c
true	c
as	c
you	c
said	c
.	c

I	i
think	i
the	i
rule	i
of	i
school	i
has	i
many	i
thing	i
stoping	i
students	i
doing	i
.	i

But	c
most	c
teachers	c
consult	c
with	c
their	c
parents	c
,	c
so	c
it	i
they	c
behave	c
wrongly	c
it	c
is	c
true	c
teachers	i
call	c
their	c
parents	c
.	c

Looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

I	c
recentely	i
had	c
a	c
week	c
's	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
,	c
and	c
during	i
my	c
stay	c
,	c
I	c
went	c
in	i
your	c
theatre	c
to	c
see	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
because	c
I	c
have	i
seen	c
an	c
advertisement	c
about	i
this	c
show	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
really	c
interrested	i
to	i
see	i
it	c
for	c
many	c
reasons	c
,	c
one	c
of	c
this	i
reasons	c
it	i
is	c
that	c
I	c
love	c
the	c
starring	i
Danny	i
Brook	c
.	c

And	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
that	i
you	c
know	i
that	c
I	c
have	c
had	c
a	c
very	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
,	c
due	c
to	c
the	c
differences	c
between	c
the	c
advertisement	c
and	c
the	c
show	c
that	c
I	c
saw	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
the	c
actor	c
was	c
not	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
20	i
years	c
ago	c
,	c
people	c
who	c
were	c
affected	c
by	c
the	c
AIDS	c
Virus	c
could	c
n't	c
live	c
more	c
than	c
two	c
or	c
three	c
years	c
,	c
but	c
now	c
with	c
the	c
new	c
science	c
,	c
there	c
is	i
several	c
therapi	i
and	c
now	c
people	c
affected	c
by	c
this	c
virus	c
can	c
live	c
many	c
years	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
you	c
can	c
do	c
a	c
lot	c
of	i
think	i
now	c
than	c
before	c
with	c
the	i
techonology	i
.	c

You	c
can	c
travel	c
around	c
the	c
world	c
by	c
train	c
,	c
by	c
plane	c
or	c
by	c
ship	c
and	c
maybe	c
one	c
day	c
you	c
can	c
fly	c
by	c
car	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
that	c
you	c
will	c
find	c
this	c
composition	c
interesting	c

best	c

Organizer	c
of	c
International	i
Arts	c
Festival	c

Mine	i
name	c
is	c
John	c
and	c
I	c
have	i
been	i
in	i
the	c
latest	c
International	c
Arts	c
Festival	c
.	c

The	c
purpose	c
of	c
this	c
letter	c
is	c
just	c
to	c
let	c
you	c
know	c
my	c
opinion	c
of	c
the	c
event	c
.	c

The	c
artists	c
you	c
brought	c
were	c
only	c
from	c
six	c
different	c
countries	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
think	c
you	i
should	i
next	i
time	i
try	c
to	c
offer	i
us	i
people	c
from	c
more	c
different	i
nationalities	c
,	c
to	c
make	c
it	c
more	c
interesting	c
than	c
it	c
is	c
already	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
thinking	c
about	c
changing	c
the	c
location	c
because	c
,	c
as	c
you	c
probably	c
already	c
know	c
,	c
some	c
concert	c
halls	c
were	c
not	c
big	c
enough	c
to	c
let	c
everybody	c
who	c
wanted	c
go	i
in	c
.	c

Some	c
examples	c
could	c
be	c
delivering	c
pizzas	c
or	c
newspapers	c
,	c
working	c
as	c
a	c
bartender	c
throug	i
the	i
nights	i
,	c
cleaning	c
services	c
,	c
etc.	c
I	c
usually	c
call	c
these	c
jobs	c
non-	i
cualified	i
positions	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
,	c
as	i
a	i
consecuence	i
,	c
that	c
there	c
is	c
no	c
difficulty	c
in	c
finding	c
a	c
job	c
for	c
our	c
spare	c
time	c
.	c

What	c
it	i
really	c
makes	c
us	c
,	c
the	c
students	c
,	c
upset	c
,	c
is	c
to	i
find	i
the	c
perfect	c
job	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
know	c
that	c
that	c
point	c
is	c
not	c
easy	c
,	c
although	c
we	c
are	c
still	c
students	c
,	c
the	c
most	c
suitable	c
job	c
for	c
us	c
should	i
be	c
a	c
position	c
related	c
with	i
our	c
carreer	i
.	c

Next	c
year	c
I	c
expect	c
myself	i
finishing	i
my	c
studies	c
in	c
LAW	c
.	c

And	c
by	c
that	c
time	c
I	c
will	c
have	i
already	i
some	c
experience	c
,	c
so	c
that	c
I	c
will	c
more	i
easily	i
able	i
to	i
apply	i
for	c
a	c
really	c
good	c
job	c
.	c

With	c
reference	c
to	c
the	c
show	c
last	c
week	c
.	i

As	c
a	c
result	c
I	c
asked	c
my	c
acquintance	i
to	c
come	c
with	c
me	c
to	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

I	c
realised	c
that	c
the	c
actor	c
was	c
n't	c
DANNY	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
disappointed	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
quarter	i
of	c
an	c
hour	c
late	c
.	c

The	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
ended	c
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
it	i
was	c
n't	c
a	c
perfect	c
evening	c
,	i
I	c
did	c
n't	c
enjoy	c
it	c
at	c
all	c
due	c
to	c
the	c
failure	i
advertisement	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
he	c
had	c
to	c
serve	c
a	c
life	c
sentences	i
.	c

The	c
story	c
began	c
in	c
1989	c
in	c
New	c
York	c
.	c

Mallory	c
and	c
his	c
partner	c
,	c
Pat	c
had	i
planned	i
the	c
best	c
plan	c
in	c
the	c
world	c
,	c
which	c
was	c
to	c
steal	c
the	c
diamond	c
from	c
the	c
national	c
bank	c
.	c

As	i
a	i
result	i
the	c
only	c
way	c
to	c
get	c
into	c
the	c
building	c
was	c
at	c
the	c
top	c
of	c
the	c
build	i
.	c

The	c
alarm	c
was	c
situated	c
at	c
the	c
top	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
the	c
guard	c
saw	c
him	c
.	c

By	c
the	c
time	c
he	c
got	c
out	c
of	c
the	c
building	c
,	c
the	c
cops	c
was	i
ever	i
where	i
but	c
as	c
long	c
as	c
Mallory	c
is	c
alive	c
,	c
he	c
wo	c
n't	c
be	c
arrested	c
,	c
with	c
his	c
unpredicatable	i
mind	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
the	i
building	c
was	c
a	c
police	c
station	c
.	c

To	i
the	c
attention	c
of	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
Manager	c
:	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
your	c
show	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
"	c
and	c
the	c
conditions	c
in	c
which	c
it	c
is	c
held	i
.	c

Moreover	c
an	c
English	c
friend	c
of	c
mine	c
had	c
told	c
me	c
that	c
it	c
would	c
purely	i
be	c
a	c
good	c
show	c
as	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
was	c
a	c
very	c
good	c
actor	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
wait	c
until	c
8:00	c
pm	c
before	c
being	c
able	c
to	c
have	i
a	c
seat	c
and	c
the	c
show	c
finally	c
beginned	i
at	c
8:15	c
!	c

No	c
need	c
to	c
say	c
how	c
much	c
I	c
was	c
disappointed	c
to	c
see	c
that	c
another	c
actor	c
was	c
performing	c
instead	c
of	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
the	c
actor	c
did	c
n't	c
seem	c
to	c
have	c
rehearsed	c
the	c
role	c
very	c
much	c
.	c

At	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
have	c
dinner	c
in	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
and	c
I	c
went	c
there	c
.	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
the	c
"	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
!	c
"	c
you	c
advertised	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
that	c
you	c
will	c
understand	c
my	c
request	c
and	c
reply	c
to	c
me	c
in	c
a	c
positive	c
way	c
by	c
sending	c
me	c
a	c
cheque	c
to	c
my	c
address	c
in	c
France	c
(	c
see	c
the	c
letterhead	c
)	c
.	c

At	c
that	c
time	c
,	c
I	c
used	c
to	c
buy	c
a	c
lotery	i
ticket	c
once	c
a	c
week	c
and	c
I	c
sometimes	c
won	c
small	c
amounts	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
to	c
wait	c
ten	c
days	c
before	c
the	c
lotery	i
head	c
office	c
would	c
give	c
me	c
the	c
cheque	c
and	c
one	c
week	c
before	c
I	c
could	c
learn	c
how	c
much	c
I	c
had	c
won	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
Margherita	c
X	c
from	c
the	i
class	c
3C	c
,	c
which	i
is	i
going	c
to	c
spend	c
three	c
days	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

We	c
especially	c
like	c
the	i
National	c
Art	c
gallery	c
.	c

We	c
are	c
young	c
and	c
we	c
all	i
are	i
interested	c
in	c
fashion	c
.	c

For	i
the	i
students	i
it	i
is	i
free	i
.	c

I	c
really	c
hope	c
that	c
you	c
gona	i
consider	i
our	c
request	c
.	c

My	c
dear	c
brother	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
normal	c
Saturday	c
morning	c
.	c

My	c
mam	c
was	c
cooking	c
and	c
my	c
dad	c
was	c
sitting	c
in	c
his	c
chair	c
reading	c
a	c
book	c
.	c

I	c
knew	c
that	c
my	c
brother	c
was	c
at	c
home	c
,	c
althoug	i
I	c
did	c
n't	c
know	c
where	c
.	i

I	c
was	c
doing	c
my	c
homeworks	i
when	c
I	c
heard	c
an	c
explosion	c
.	c

I	c
came	c
out	c
of	c
my	c
room	c
and	c
I	c
saw	c
my	c
brother	c
n	i
fire	c
.	c

My	c
first	c
reaction	c
was	c
to	c
put	i
him	c
on	c
the	c
floor	c
so	c
that	c
the	c
fire	c
could	c
stop	i
.	c

We	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
hospital	c
and	c
they	c
cured	i
him	c
.	c

Since	c
that	c
bad	c
experience	c
he	c
never	i
playied	i
with	c
fire	c
again	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
,	c

However	c
,	c
we	c
do	c
all	c
have	c
a	c
request	c
to	c
ask	i
you	c
.	c

This	c
show	c
is	c
going	c
on	c
all	c
day	c
on	c
March	c
14th	c
.	c

What	c
we	c
are	c
suggesting	c
you	i
is	c
to	c
change	c
the	c
programme	c
on	c
the	c
afternoon	c
of	c
March	c
the	c
14th	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

Because	c
of	c
us	c
!	c

Last	c
Saturday	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
your	c
theatre	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
new	c
musical	c
show	c
;	i
"	c
Over	c
The	c
Rainbow	c
"	c

It	c
was	c
writing	i
on	i
the	c
advertisement	c
that	c
Danny	c
BROOK	c
was	c
going	c
to	c
play	i
with	c
Tina	c
TRUELOVE	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
him	c
who	c
played	i
.	c

That	c
disappointed	c
both	i
me	c
and	c
the	c
people	c
who	c
just	c
went	c
to	c
see	c
him	c
.	c

Therefore	c
,	c
people	c
there	c
had	c
to	c
wait	c
for	c
45	c
minutes	c
.	c

Also	c
,	c
there	i
was	c
said	c
to	i
be	i
discounts	c
for	i
the	c
ticket	i
but	c
I	c
saw	i
nothing	c
like	c
this	c
.	c

After	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
restaurant	c
in	c
the	c
theatre	c
to	c
eat	c
something	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
being	c
cleaned	c
that	c
day	c
.	c

Your	i
faithfully	c
,	c

It	c
all	c
started	c
two	c
years	c
ago	c
.	c

One	c
day	c
,	c
while	c
he	c
was	c
gardening	c
,	c
he	c
saw	c
an	c
old	c
lady	c
being	c
kidnapped	c
by	c
some	c
strange	c
man	i
,	c
who	c
he	c
ran	c
after	c
and	i
caught	i
one	i
of	i
whom	i
.	c

Rod	c
jumped	c
on	c
him	c
and	c
the	c
man	c
killed	c
himself	c
,by	i
his	c
own	c
gun	c
.	c

Rod	c
told	c
this	c
to	c
nobody	c
,	c
except	c
Pat	c
,	c
his	c
best	c
friend	c
.	c

And	c
everyone	c
was	c
surprised	c
.	c

Mrs/Miss	c
Helen	c
:	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
excellent	c
to	c
have	c
won	c
this	c
prize	c
.	c

To	c
be	c
honest	c
I	c
had	c
doubts	c
about	c
winning	c
the	c
competition	c
,	c
because	c
in	c
spite	c
of	c
I	i
think	i
I	c
did	c
well	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
play	c
against	c
a	i
very	c
strong	c
competence	i
.	c

The	c
idea	c
about	i
going	c
to	c
California	c
for	c
2	c
weeks	c
make	i
me	c
feel	c
very	c
excited	c
.	c

According	i
with	i
your	c
letter	c
,	c
July	c
is	c
the	c
period	i
of	i
time	c
suits	i
me	c
best	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
really	c
surprise	i
about	c
how	c
many	c
activities	c
can	c
be	c
practised	i
in	c
this	c
place	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
not	c
so	c
bad	c
at	c
tennis	c
but	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
improve	c
my	c
style	c
.	c

By	c
the	c
way	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
if	c
the	c
level	i
of	i
life	i
in	c
USA	i
is	c
similar	c
to	c
UK	i
.	c

Please	c
if	i
you	c
need	c
further	c
information	c
from	c
me	c
,	c
do	c
n't	c
hesitate	c
to	c
contact	c
me	c
again	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
.	c

And	c
really	c
,	c
it	c
works	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
in	i
this	c
moment	c
when	c
really	c
I	c
realiase	i
I	c
am	c
getting	c
fat	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
horrible	c
feeling	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
women	c
,	c
in	c
general	c
,	c
are	c
very	c
impulsive	c
purchasing	i
things	c
.	c

Many	c
times	c
we	c
buy	c
things	c
that	c
in	i
fact	i
,	c
we	c
do	c
n't	c
need	c
and	c
,	c
sometimes	c
you	c
surprise	i
when	c
you	c
check	c
the	c
balance	c
of	c
your	c
bank	c
account	c
and	c
then	c
you	c
need	c
to	c
cut	c
down	c
your	i
expenses	c
for	c
2	c
months	c
.	c

But	c
from	c
another	c
point	c
of	c
view	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
silly	c
to	c
be	c
earning	c
money	c
and	c
do	i
n't	i
spend	i
it	c
as	c
you	c
want	c
.	c

At	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
the	c
day	c
money	c
is	c
just	c
money	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Ryan	c
:	c

Thank	i
's	i
for	c
accept	i
me	c
in	c
the	c
competition	c
.	c

I	c
will	c
choose	c
for	c
activities	i
tennis	c
and	c
swimming	c
,	i
I	c
'm	c
good	c
on	i
tennis	c
because	c
I	c
play	i
since	c
1990	c
and	c
I	c
loved	i
it	c
and	c
swimming	i
because	c
I	c
like	c
to	c
swim	c
and	c
I	c
've	c
been	c
two	i
competition	i
and	c
I	c
won	c
both	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
for	c
money	c
and	c
clothes	c
because	c
my	c
parents	c
are	c
travelling	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
impossible	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
have	i
money	i
because	c
my	c
sister	c
does	c
n't	c
want	c
me	c
to	c
go	c
because	c
I	c
'm	c
only	c
14	c
,	c
but	c
when	c
I	c
get	c
there	c
I	c
promise	c
to	c
return	c
you	i
all	c

Well	c
I	c
think	i
the	c
opposite	c
like	i
a	c
year	c
before	i
but	c
recently	c
I	c
think	i
this	c
because	c
I	c
see	c
all	c
the	c
people	c
to	i
go	i
shopping	c
they	i
do	c
n't	c
realised	i
that	c
they	i
are	i
outside	c
in	c
the	c
real	c
world	c
poor	i
people	c
who	c
need	c
that	c
money	c
and	i
they	c
are	c
only	c
spent	i
on	c
material	c
things	c
,	i
you	i
would	i
put	c
you	i
money	c
in	c
the	c
bank	c
because	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
need	c
it	c
now	c
,	c
but	c
tomorrow	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
.	c

Bye	c
and	c
think	c
on	i
this	c
.	c

Lola	c
Villanueva	c
J	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
inform	c
some	i
further	c
information	c
as	i
follow	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
tents	c
to	c
long	i
cabins	c
because	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
more	c
interesting	c
and	c
exciting	c
than	i
live	i
in	c
long	i
cabins	c
.	c

Some	c
people	c
when	i
they	i
are	i
in	i
a	i
sadness	i
,	i
they	i
will	i
go	i
shopping	i
to	c
forget	c
every	i
thing	i
and	c
the	c
fact	c
is	c
that	c
every	i
body	i
knows	c
how	c
to	c
shopping	i
.	c

Anyway	c
,	c
even	i
in	c
families	c
they	c
usauly	i
have	c
this	c
problem	c
that	c
when	c
they	c
bought	i
a	c
new	c
one	i
,	c
suddenly	c
they	c
have	c
a	c
problem	c
that	i
where	c
the	c
old	c
one	c
is	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
and	c
that	c
is	c
the	c
begining	i
of	c
argument	i
between	c
mother	c
and	c
farther	i
or	c
parents	c
and	c
chilldren	i
.	c

Eventually	i
I	c
like	c
shopping	c
to	i
and	c
I	c
beleive	i
every	i
body	i
like	i
shopping	c
,	c
but	c
before	c
you	c
buy	c
something	c
think	c
before	i
you	i
will	c
not	c
have	c
any	c
problems	c
after	c
that	c
and	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
thing	c
is	c
make	c
sure	c
you	c
have	c
enough	c
meney	i
for	i
survive	i
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
this	c
complaining	i
is	c
not	c
only	c
about	c
the	c
actor	c
,	c
who	i
ever	i
,	i
the	c
problem	c
is	c
that	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
too	c
late	c
.	c

Technology	c
nowadays	c
is	c
something	c
everybody	c
has	c
on	c
your	i
own	i
mind	c
.	c

We	c
young	c
people	c
do	c
n't	c
remember	c
when	c
technology	c
was	c
n't	c
part	c
of	c
our	c
daily	c
life	c
,	c
but	c
our	c
parents	c
,	c
or	c
grand	i
parents	i
remember	c
exactly	i
when	i
they	c
were	c
young	c
,	c
and	c
everything	c
was	c
made	c
in	c
a	c
different	c
way	c
,	i
for	i
example	c
our	c
parents	c
did	c
n't	c
have	c
computers	c
at	c
home	c
when	c
they	c
were	c
teenagers	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
technology	c
is	c
a	c
word	c
that	c
will	i
never	c
get	c
out	c
of	c
our	c
minds	c
,	c
and	c
we	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
how	c
technology	i
,	c
and	i
in	i
which	i
speed	c
it	i
will	c
develop	c
to	i
the	c
future	c
.	c

Maybe	c
,	c
technology	c
will	c
never	c
stop	c
growing	i
and	c
our	c
life	c
will	c
never	c
work	c
without	c
computers	c
.	c

Manager	c
of	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c

I	c
am	c
waiting	i
this	c
letter	c
re	i
fearing	i
to	c
the	c
show	c
"	c
over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
you	c
presented	i
the	i
10	c
of	c
this	c
month	c
.	c

I	c
read	c
your	c
advertissement	i
five	c
days	c
before	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
realy	i
impressed	c
by	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
want	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
some	c
details	c
about	c
my	c
feelings	c
.	c

So	c
you	c
can	c
imagine	c
how	c
I	i
am	i
satisfied	i
by	c
your	c
pretending	i
"	i
Perfect	c
Evening	c
"	c
.	c

For	c
all	c
these	c
reasons	c
,	c
and	c
if	c
you	c
want	c
to	c
keep	c
me	c
a	i
costumer	i
,	c
I	c
would	c
be	c
gratfull	i
if	c
you	c
give	i
me	c
some	c
or	c
all	c
my	i
money	c
back	c
.	c

My	c
marks	c
was	i
n't	i
good	c
enought	i
to	c
obtain	c
my	c
degree	c
in	c
Computer	c
Science	c
,	c
and	c
the	c
exam	c
session	c
was	c
finished	c
.	c

There	c
was	c
no	c
solutions	i
to	c
finally	i
obtain	c
the	c
diploma	c
.	c

The	c
problem	c
is	c
that	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
keep	c
calm	c
during	c
an	c
exam	c
to	i
succeed	i
.	c

During	c
this	c
party	c
,	c
Pat	c
drank	c
too	c
much	c
.	c

And	c
when	c
he	c
was	c
totally	c
drunk	c
,	c
he	c
started	c
speaking	c
.	c

So	c
congratulation	i
everybody	c
.	c

And	c
I	c
think	c
I	c
will	c
still	c
be	c
there	i
next	c
year	c
.	c

Dear	c
M.	c
Smith	c
,	c

On	c
Thursday	c
,	c
the	c
3rd	c
of	c
May	c
2000	c
,	c
we	c
went	c
to	c
your	c
theatre	c
to	c
see	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
"	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
we	c
were	c
really	c
disappointed	c
about	c
everything	c
in	c
the	c
theatre	c
.	c

Surprisily	i
,	c
there	c
were	c
no	c
discounds	i
.	c

Thirdly	c
,	c
we	c
were	c
astonished	c
about	i
the	c
actors	c
whose	i
we	c
know	c
from	c
others	i
musical	i
.	c

Why	c
did	c
you	c
not	c
change	c
the	c
name	i
of	i
your	c
advertisement	c
?	c

We	c
really	c
like	c
London	c
,	c
the	c
people	c
,	c
the	c
night-life	c
but	c
this	c
evening	c
was	c
really	c
awful	c
.	c

Would	c
you	c
pleased	i
return	c
our	c
money	c
back	i
.	c

In	c
advance	c
,	c
thank	c
you	c
.	c

Sincerely	c
yours	c

When	c
her	c
best	c
friend	c
,	c
Scala	c
,	c
asked	c
her	c
an	i
idea	c
to	c
surprise	c
her	c
husband	c
because	i
she	i
's	i
pregnant	c
,	c
Pat	c
put	c
her	c
feets	i
in	i
the	i
plate	i
just	c
before	c
Scala	c
's	c
husband	c
got	i
the	c
surprise	c
.	c

The	c
problem	c
is	c
that	c
Pat	c
works	c
in	c
the	i
Neubathin	c
a	i
little	c
village	c
.	c

He	c
was	c
so	c
amazed	c
and	c
asked	c
to	i
repeat	c
.	i

She	c
just	c
thought	i
it	c
would	i
be	i
a	c
secret	c
,	c
she	i
came	i
really	c
embarassed	i
.	c

When	c
he	c
went	c
back	c
to	c
his	c
house	c
,	c
his	c
wife	c
gave	c
him	c
the	c
box	c
with	c
the	c
shoes	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
a	c
surprise	c
!	c

Many	c
thanks	c
for	c
the	c
programme	c
you	c
have	c
organised	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
really	c
interesting	c
and	c
diversity	i
at	c
the	c
same	c
time	c
.	c

That	i
is	c
in	c
the	c
central	i
Exhibition	c
Hall	c
,	c
near	c
the	c
hotel	c
,	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
only	i
about	c
fashion	c
:	c
latest	i
fashions	c
,	c
leisure	c
and	c
sports	c
wear	c
,	c
make	i
up	i
and	c
hairstyles	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
could	c
be	c
very	c
interesting	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
free	c
for	c
students	c
(	c
what	i
is	c
really	c
good	c
)	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
because	c
this	c
show	c
is	c
only	c
each	i
two	c
years	c
and	c
normaly	i
it	c
is	c
difficult	c
to	c
go	i
in	i
.	c

Or	c
,	i
going	c
to	c
the	c
show	c
on	c
wensday	i
morning	c
and	c
on	i
the	c
afternoon	c
,	c
we	c
can	c
choose	c
between	c
free	c
time	c
or	c
National	i
Art	c
Gallery	c
.	c

I	c
finally	c
realized	c
that	c
she	c
was	c
dead	c
.	c

The	c
police	c
arrived	c
twenty	c
minutes	c
later	c
,	c
took	c
my	c
mother	c
and	c
checked	c
to	c
see	c
what	c
could	c
be	c
interesting	i
to	c
find	c
the	c
murder	i
:	c
lucky	i
,	c
the	c
knife	c
which	c
he	c
used	c
to	c
kill	c
her	c
was	c
still	c
here	i
and	c
in	c
fact	c
they	c
could	i
arrested	i
him	c
.	c

Everything	c
was	c
going	c
on	i
,	c
when	c
one	c
day	c
,	c
I	c
came	i
in	i
the	c
house	c
and	c
found	c
my	c
mother	c
sitting	c
in	c
a	c
chair	c
reading	c
a	c
book	c
,	c
with	c
blood	c
all	c
around	c
her	c
.	c

I	c
write	i
a	i
letter	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
your	c
advertisement	c
about	i
the	c
musical	c
show	c
"	c
over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
"	c
,	c
wich	i
is	c
misleading	c
in	c
a	c
number	c
of	c
way	i
.	c

However	c
it	i
started	c
at	c
20.15	c
and	c
we	c
were	c
all	c
very	c
disappointed	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
and	c
we	c
could	c
n't	c
afford	c
bying	i
everyone	c
a	c
ticket	c
.	c

Your	i
sincerely	c
,	c

Mother	c
,	c
on	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
looked	c
at	c
me	c
and	c
seemed	c
both	c
disappointed	c
and	c
betrayed	c
.	c

During	c
the	c
trip	c
home	c
non	i
of	c
us	c
spoke	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
answer	i
to	c
your	c
letter	c
in	c
which	c
you	c
told	c
me	c
I	c
won	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
our	i
competetion	i
,	c
which	c
is	c
two	c
weeks	c
,	i
I	c
was	c
very	c
happy	c
with	c
this	c
result	c
since	c
I	c
did	c
not	c
think	c
I	c
could	c
win	c
.	c

Besides	c
this	c
,	c
in	c
connexion	i
with	c
the	c
activities	c
we	c
will	c
have	c
the	c
chance	c
to	c
do	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
inform	c
you	c
that	c
I	c
choose	c
swimming	c
and	c
tennis	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
quite	c
good	c
at	c
both	c
,	c
especially	c
at	c
tennis	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
to	c
this	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
which	i
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
and	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
it	i
is	c
necessary	c
to	c
have	c
,	c
since	c
I	c
am	c
undecided	c
about	c
it	c
not	i
knowing	c
the	c
cost	c
of	c
life	i
in	c
California	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
,	c

Yours	c
Sincerely	i
,	c

The	c
aim	c
of	c
this	c
report	c
is	c
to	c
suggest	c
which	c
activities	c
of	i
our	c
daily	c
life	c
at	c
school	c
shoud	i
be	c
filmed	c
to	c
give	c
the	c
other	c
students	c
the	i
idea	c
of	c
what	c
we	c
usually	c
do	c
not	i
only	c
during	c
the	c
lessons	c
but	c
also	c
the	c
rest	c
of	c
the	c
time	c
.	c

A	c
little	i
percentage	c
,	c
on	c
the	c
contrary	c
,	c
said	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
very	c
useful	c
to	c
film	c
the	c
teacher	c
when	c
she	c
is	c
explaining	i
us	i
something	i
important	i
,	c
to	c
give	c
the	i
idea	c
of	c
the	i
real	c
life	c
in	c
our	c
classroom	c
.	c

which	i
is	i
the	i
most	i
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
there	c
were	c
no	c
diccounts	i
avaible	i
as	i
it	i
said	i
on	i
the	c
anouncement	i
so	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
pay	c
the	c
original	c
price	c
wich	i
was	c
n't	c
cheap	c
at	c
all	c
.	c

Then	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
forced	c
to	c
wait	c
fourty	i
five	i
minutes	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
show	c
because	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
20:75	c
in	i
stead	i
of	c
19:30	c
and	c
when	i
it	c
finally	c
started	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
really	c
disapointed	i
to	c
see	c
that	c
the	c
actors	c
were	c
n't	c
Danny	c
and	c
Tina	c
as	c
it	c
said	i
on	i
the	c
anouncement	i
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
when	c
the	c
show	c
finished	c
,	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
visit	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
for	c
repairs	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
as	c
you	c
can	c
see	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
my	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
at	c
all	i
that	i
's	i
why	c
I	c
demand	c
you	c
to	i
send	i
me	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

Your	c
really	c
unsatisfied	i
costomer	i

That	c
is	c
not	c
difference	i
from	c
now	c
.	c

That	c
's	c
why	c
modern	c
technology	c
is	c
so	c
important	c
in	c
our	c
daily	c
life	i
,	c
because	c
it	c
helps	c
to	c
make	c
our	c
life	i
easiest	i
and	c
to	c
do	c
what	c
we	c
have	c
to	c
do	c
faster	c
so	c
then	c
we	c
can	c
use	c
better	i
our	i
time	i

As	c
far	c

I	c
think	c
I	c
told	c
you	c
about	c
my	c
plans	c
of	i
entering	i
a	c
group	c
that	c
helps	c
at	c
concerts	c
,	c
did	c
n't	c
I	c
?	c

Well	c
,	c
I	c
took	c
my	c
chance	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
chosen	c
to	c
help	c
at	c
Michael	c
Jackson	c
's	c
concert	c
.	c

Amazing	c
,	c
is	c
n't	c
it	c
?	c

There	c
was	i
about	c
100	c
000	c
people	c
.	c

Many	c
people	c
fainted	c
and	c
some	c
of	c
them	c
,	c
the	c
most	c
serious	c
cases	c
,	c
had	c
to	c
be	c
taken	c
to	c
hospital	c
.	c

The	c
biggest	c
problem	c
was	c
connected	c
with	c
some	c
foreigners	c
who	c
could	c
n't	c
speak	c
Polish	c
or	c
English	c
and	c
we	c
did	c
n't	c
know	c
how	c
to	c
help	c
them	c
.	c

Despite	c
this	c
fact	c
,	c
the	c
atmosphere	c
was	c
terrific	c
.	c

After	c
the	c
concert	c
many	c
people	c
lost	c
their	c
way	c
home	c
,	c
mostly	c
foreigners	c
who	c
did	c
n't	c
know	c
the	c
buses	c
'	c
schedule	c
.	c

You	c
should	c
also	c
try	c
.	i

At	c
first	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
a	c
problem	c
because	c
if	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
the	c
best	c
it	i
would	c
cost	i
what	c
they	c
said	i
.	c

So	c
you	c
can	c
imagine	c
how	c
I	c
felt	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
irritating	c
evening	c
out	c
I	c
had	c

I	c
think	c
technology	c
has	c
changed	c
my	c
life	c
and	c
the	c
way	i
of	i
living	i
of	c
almost	c
all	i
people	i
around	c
the	c
world	c
.	c

Something	c
that	c
I	c
note	c
about	c
technology	c
is	c
that	c
we	c
are	c
loosing	i
green	c
places	c
and	c
there	c
are	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
pollution	c
,	c
so	c
we	c
have	c
to	c
be	c
careful	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
a	c
musical	c
show	c
which	c
I	c
've	c
seen	c
recently	c
at	c
your	c
theatre	c
.	c

Despite	c
it	i
,	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
stared	i
in	c
the	c
performance	c
,	c
which	c
was	c
really	c
disappointing	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

People	c
wore	c
clothes	c
made	c
from	c
metal	c
,	c
which	c
were	c
rather	c
heavy	c
,	c
I	c
suppose	c
.	c

They	c
wore	c
enormous	c
luxurious	c
dresses	c
,	c
which	c
,	c
in	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
you	c
ca	c
n't	c
feel	c
very	c
comfortable	c
in	c
.	c

People	c
's	c
clothes	c
have	c
been	c
changing	c
from	c
metalwear	i
to	c
shorts	c
and	c
miniskirts	c
.	c

That	c
's	c
why	c
I	c
suppose	c
,	i
that	c
man	c
's	c
clothes	c
will	c
be	c
becoming	c
more	i
and	i
more	i
light	i
.	c

I	c
think	c
,	c
they	c
will	c
be	c
made	c
of	c
universal	c
materials	c
,	c
which	c
will	c
be	c
rather	c
light	c
and	c
thin	c
.	c

People	c
wo	c
n't	c
be	c
embarassed	i
to	c
show	c
the	c
beauty	c
of	c
their	c
bodies	c
.	c

Perhaps	c
,	c
clothes	c
will	c
be	c
rather	c
small	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
,	c
that	c
different	c
tops	c
and	c
mini-skirts	c
will	c
become	c
more	c
popular	c
.	c

Perhaps	c
,	c
metalwear	i
will	c
become	c
a	c
craze	c
again	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
happy	c
to	c
have	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
of	i
the	c
competition	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
going	c
to	i
clear	i
up	i
some	c
details	c
you	c
asked	c
me	c
in	i
your	c
letter	c
.	c

Moroever	i
,	c
I	c
have	c
chosen	c
this	c
month	c
because	c
I	c
think	c
the	c
weather	c
will	c
be	c
fine	c
.	c

At	c
Camp	c
California	c
,	c
I	c
hope	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
in	c
tents	i
because	c
I	c
like	c
very	c
much	c
this	c
kind	c
of	c
style	i
life	i
:	c
I	c
love	c
the	i
contact	c
with	c
the	i
nature	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
two	c
questions	c
more	c
:	c
I	c
wonder	c
if	c
I	c
can	c
change	c
my	c
french	i
money	c
in	c
the	c
Camp	i
and	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
buy	c
before	c
coming	c
?	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Dear	c
Kim	c

My	c
friends	c
have	c
seen	c
an	c
advertisement	c
which	c
is	c
the	i
London	c
fashion	i
and	i
leissure	i
show	i
.	c

We	c
have	c
decided	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
more	c
interesting	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
latest	c
fashions	c
,	c
make	i
up	i
,	c
hairstyles	i
instead	i
of	i
going	c
to	c
do	c
shopping	c
.	c

We	c
would	c
suggest	c
gong	i
to	c
this	c
fabolous	i
show	c
.	c

We	c
spend	c
most	c
of	c
our	c
life	c
in	c
our	c
houses	c
.	c

it	i
only	i
just	i
might	i
be	i
changed	i
the	i
design	i
of	i
things	i
such	c
as	c
a	c
triangular	c
talking	c
oven	c
.	c

to	c
live	c
.	c

it	i
would	c
be	c
enjoyable	c
to	c
have	c
virtual	c

in	c
my	c
house	c

Dear	c

I	c
'm	c

about	c
the	c
musical	c

which	c
I	c
've	c

at	c
your	c

In	c

to	c
this	c
,	c
the	c

was	c
closed	c
for	c

of	c

So	c

I	c
'm	c
sure	c
you	c

Introduction	c
:	c
It	c
seems	c
to	c
me	c
that	c
modern	c
technology	c
has	c
deeply	i
changed	c
our	c
daily	c
life	c
.	c

The	c
computer	c
is	c
everywhere	c
and	c
it	c
's	c
available	c
for	c
everyone	c
.	c

Have	i
a	i
good	i
feeling	i
with	i
it	i
!	c

On	i
one	i
side	i
,	c
the	i
modern	c
technology	c
is	c
extremely	c
important	c
,	c
on	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
you	c
should	c
n't	c
abuse	c
of	i
it	c

Although	c
the	c
world	c
of	c
computers	c
will	c
develop	c
day	c
by	c
day	c
,	c
I	c
lively	i
hope	c
we	c
(	c

could	i
mantain	i

DEAR	c
MRS	c
RYAN	c
,	c

I	c
HAVE	i
BEEN	i
IN	i
A	c
SPORT	i
CAMP	c
LAST	c
YEAR	c
AND	c
IT	c
WAS	c
FUNNY	i
TO	c
SLEEP	c
IN	c
TENTS	c
.	c

WE	i
NEED	c
SOME	c
SPECIAL	c
SPORT	i
CLOTHES	c
FOR	c
THIS	i
TWO	c
ACTIVITIES	c
?	c

HE	c
'S	c
A	c
SMAL	i
ONE	c
!	c

ONE	c
WEEK	c
LATER	c
THEY	c
INVITED	c
ME	c
TO	c
A	c
POP	c
CONCERT	c
WHICH	c
TOOK	c
PLACE	c
IN	c
ZURICH	c
LAST	c
MONTH	c
.	c

AFTER	c
THE	c
MEETING	c
WE	i
RECIEVED	i
ALL	i
THE	c
SAME	c
CLOTHES	c
.	c

ONE	c
TEAM	c
!	c

BEFORE	c
THE	c
CONCERT	c
WE	c
HAD	c
A	c
BREAK	c
TO	c
EAT	c
SOMETHING	c
AND	c
TO	c
TALK	c
TO	c
EACH	c
OTHER	c
.	c

IT	c
WAS	c
INTERESTING	c
TO	c
SEE	c
THAT	c
ALL	c
PEOPLE	c
HAVE	c
OTHER	i
HOBBIES	c
AND	c
WORK	i
.	c

AFTER	c
A	c
NICE	c
CONCERT	c
WE	c
HAD	c
TO	c
CLEAN	c
EVERYTHING	c
AND	c
I	c
WAS	c
HAPPY	c
WHEN	c
I	c
ARRIVED	c
AT	c
HOME	c
EARLY	c
IN	c
THE	c
MORNING..	c
!	c

It	c
was	c
advertised	c
as	c
London	c
's	c
Newest	c
and	c
best	c
musical	c
show	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
it	c
had	i
been	i
a	c
very	c
dissappointing	i
evening	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
mentioned	c
that	c
there	c
were	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
two	c
starrings	i
but	c
,	c
in	c
fact	c
,	c
only	c
an	i
actor	c
were	i
performing	c
on	i
the	c
show	c
.	c

This	c
really	c
upset	c
me	c
as	c
no	c
notice	c
were	i
given	c
before	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

Thirdly	c
,	c
the	c
advertisment	i
said	c
that	c
the	i
discounts	c
were	c
avaliable	i
but	c
,	i
the	c
ticket	c
seller	c
said	c
that	c
there	c
was	c
no	c
discount	c
allowing	i
or	i
avaliable	i
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
for	c
money	i
back	c
for	i
the	c
ticket	c
due	c
to	c
the	c
disapointing	i
evening	c
out	c
and	c
unreliable	i
advertisement	c
you	c
have	c
created	i
.	c

Cook	c
Phatosub	c
.	c

The	c
reasons	c
it	c
is	c
important	c
to	c
us	c
are	c
,	c
first	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
if	i
you	i
think	i
bout	i
life	i
without	c
computers	c
,	c
communication	c
machines	i
and	c
transportation	c
machines	i
.	c

We	c
would	c
n't	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
sort	i
out	i
informations	i
and	c
datas	i
this	i
quickly	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
no	c
one	c
could	c
communicate	c
on	c
the	c
phone	c
through	i
countries	i
or	i
even	i
through	i
houses	i
as	c
immediate	i
as	c
nowadays	c
.	c

Lastly	c
,	c
it	c
would	c
take	c
people	c
months	c
and	c
months	c
to	c
travel	c
to	c
the	c
other	c
side	c
of	c
the	c
world	c
and	c
also	c
the	c
journey	c
would	c
be	c
much	c
more	c
dangerous	c
than	c
travel	i
by	c
plane	c
.	c

Put	i
it	c
in	c
another	i
words	c
,	c
modern	c
technology	c
has	c
changed	c
our	c
life	c
to	c
became	c
more	c
advanced	c
in	c
every	c
ways	i
.	c

Therefore	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
important	c
to	c
get	c
it	c
exactly	c
right	c
.	c

We	c
have	c
just	c
known	i
the	c
programme	c
you	c
prepared	c
for	c
our	c
three-day	c
trip	c
to	c
London	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
many	i
interesting	c
positions	i
in	c
this	c
schedule	c
,	c
especially	c
the	c
river	c
trip	c
to	c
Greenwich	c
,	c
which	c
,	c
we	c
are	c
shure	i
,	c
will	c
be	c
very	c
exciting	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
inform	c
you	c
,	i
that	c
we	c
have	c
seen	c
an	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
"	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Laisure	i
Show	c
"	c
and	c
we	c
have	c
found	c
it	c
very	c
interesting	c
.	c

We	c
will	i
be	c
able	c
to	c
visit	c
the	c
Science	c
Museum	c
on	c
Wednesday	i
's	i
afternoon	c
.	c

We	c
have	c
checked	c
that	c
it	c
is	c
open	c
every	c
day	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
b	i
grateful	c
if	c
you	c
consider	i
our	c
suggestions	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
dangerous	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
knew	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
.	c

Suddenly	c
I	c
heard	c
a	c
noice	i
from	c
my	c
garden	c
and	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
know	c
what	c
it	c
was	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
impossible	c
to	c
do	i
it	i
.	c

The	c
outside	c
lights	c
were	c
broken	i
down	i
and	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
see	c
anything	c
.	c

I	c
stood	c
against	c
the	c
window	c
and	c
I	c
started	c
to	c
listen	c
.	c

The	c
things	c
that	c
really	c
dissapointed	i
me	c
were	c
that	c
you	c
said	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
were	c
suposed	i
to	i
be	i
the	c
actors	c
but	c
they	c
were	c
n't	c
,	c
different	c
actors	c
played	c
and	c
to	c
be	c
honest	c
they	c
made	c
the	c
hole	i
show	c
very	c
bad	c
.	c

Another	c
thing	c
was	c
that	c
you	c
said	c
discounts	c
are	c
available	c
which	i
is	c
very	c
important	c
for	c
students	c
,	c
but	c
no	c
their	i
were	c
n't	c
any	c
.	c

To	c
be	c
honest	c
that	c
was	c
not	c
a	c
great	c
expierence	i
and	c
I	c
hope	c
you	c
will	c
see	c
my	c
point	c
.	c

T.	c
Herschel	c

Noone	i
can	c
think	c
about	c
a	c
life	c
without	c
commuters	i
or	c
electricity	c
.	c

But	c
we	c
ca	c
n't	c
say	c
the	c
new	c
technology	c
has	c
done	i
just	i
bad	c
things	c
in	c
our	c
life	c
because	c
otherwise	c
we	c
could	c
n't	c
have	c
made	c
such	c
progress	c
in	c
all	c
the	c
sciences	c
and	c
other	c
subjects	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
express	c
my	c
annoyance	c
at	c
your	c
musical	c
show	c
which	i
happened	c
to	c
be	c
inaccurate	i
at	i
the	i
leaflet	i
given	i
.	c

Another	c
point	c
which	c
caused	c
some	c
inconveniences	i
was	c
the	c
timetable	i
of	i
the	i
show	i
.	c

It	c
began	c
45	c
minutes	c
later	c
than	c
it	c
should	c
have	c
been	i
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

Gens	c

It	c
was	c
far	c
too	c
heavy	i
to	c
keep	c
it	c
for	i
myself	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
made	c
a	c
mistake	c
and	c
I	c
told	c
her	c
.	c

The	c
day	c
after	c
,	c
at	c
school	c
,	c
I	c
noticed	c
that	c
everyone	c
was	c
looking	c
at	c
me	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
only	c
a	c
question	c
of	c
hours	c
before	c
my	c
life	c
would	c
collapse	c
.	c

I	c
read	c
the	c
hurt	c
in	c
her	c
eyes	c
.	c

She	c
knew	c
.	c

She	c
knew	c
that	c
I	c
had	c
bought	c
my	c
first	c
bra	c
without	c
having	c
asked	c
her	c
for	c
advice	c
before	i
it	i
.	c

Mr.	c
Smith	c
,	c

We	c
asked	c
for	c
it	c
and	c
we	c
were	c
told	c
that	c
there	c
was	c
not	i
discount	c
neither	i
for	c
her	c
not	i
for	i
anyone	c
else	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
pay	c
the	c
full	c
price	c
of	c
the	c
two	c
tickets	c
.	c

Very	c
soon	c
,	c
Lise	c
understood	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
useless	c
to	c
continue	c
pretending	c
that	c
she	c
knew	c
nothing	c
about	c
it	c
,	c
and	c
decided	c
to	c
make	c
a	c
deal	c
with	c
her	c
class	c
mates	c
.	c

She	c
would	c
give	c
them	c
the	c
exam	c
's	c
questions	c
and	c
they	c
would	c
make	i
all	c
her	c
homeworks	i
during	i
3	c
weeks	c
.	c

There	c
was	c
no	c
escape	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
the	c
teachers	c
asked	c
Lise	c
and	c
her	c
friends	c

Dear	c
Madam	c
,	c

I	c
found	i
it	c
was	c
a	c
very	c
good	c
idea	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
a	c
few	c
things	c
that	c
I	c
personally	c
think	c
can	i
be	c
improved	c
in	c
the	i
following	i
editions	i
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
although	c
the	c
music	c
concerts	c
were	c
good	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
some	c
concert	c
halls	c
were	c
too	c
small	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
shame	c
to	c
found	i
that	c
some	c
of	c
them	c
were	c
sold	c
out	c
because	c
the	i
short	i
number	c
of	c
seats	c
available	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
really	c
enjoyed	c
the	c
dance	c
shows	c
and	c
the	c
plays	c
and	c
films	c
.	c

I	c
suggest	c
it	c
can	i
be	c
a	c
good	c
idea	c
to	c
set	i
more	c
projections	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
in	c
my	c
opinion	c
two	c
days	c
is	c
a	c
short	c
time	c
for	c
this	c
kind	c
of	c
event	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
strongly	c
encourage	c
you	c
to	c
organise	c
a	c
full	c
week	i
festival	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
'll	c
attend	i
my	c
suggestions	c
.	c

Once	c
upon	c
a	c
time	c
,	c
in	c
a	c
small	c
Catalan	c
village	c
,	c
there	c
was	c
a	c
little	c
boy	c
who	c
loved	c
cheating	i
and	c
making	c
jokes	c
.	c

His	c
father	c
was	c
a	c
shelter	i
,	c
He	i
had	c
one	c
hundred	c
sheeps	i
and	c
one	c
dog	c
,	c
and	c
he	c
used	c
to	c
take	c
the	c
animals	c
to	c
the	c
mountain	c
to	c
feed	c
them	c
.	c

the	i
next	c
day	c
he	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
mountain	c
with	c
the	c
animals	c
.	c

"	c
Let	c
's	c
have	c
a	c
bit	c
of	c
fun	c
"	c
,	c
he	c
thought	c
.	c

And	c
then	c
he	c
started	c
shouting	c
:	c
"	c
the	i
fox	c
!	c

They	c
were	c
angry	c
.	c

Then	c
he	c
learned	c
to	i
say	i
always	i
the	c
truth	c
.	c

Dear	c
Clark	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
because	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
give	c
my	c
personal	c
opinion	c
about	c
the	c
'	c
international	c
arts	c
festival	c
.	c
'	c

My	c
suggestion	c
for	c
this	c
point	c
is	c
to	c
invite	c
more	c
people	c
from	c
different	c
countries	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
is	i
that	i
some	c
concert	c
halls	c
were	c
definitely	c
to	i
small	c
or	c
in	c
other	c
words	c
to	i
many	c
people	c
attended	c
those	c
concerts	c
.	c

To	c
finish	c
this	c
letter	c
with	i
I	i
would	c
like	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
a	c
good	c
idea	c
for	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

How	c
can	c
you	c
earn	c
money	c
in	c
your	c
spare	c
time	c
?	c

Anyway	c
the	c
people	c
where	i
asked	c
this	c
question	c
probably	c
found	c
out	c
that	c
it	c
is	c
n't	c
so	c
easy	c
to	c
earn	c
money	c
or	c
that	c
it	c
is	c
sometimes	c
to	i
much	c
work	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
when	c
it	c
is	c
rainy	c
,	c
because	c
then	c
everything	c
get	i
wet	c
.	c

Another	c
suggestion	c
is	c
that	c
you	c
go	c
to	c
your	c
cinema	c
and	c
ask	c
if	c
they	c
need	c
your	c
help	c
for	i
changing	c
the	c
film	c
rolls	c
,	c
for	i
cleaning	c
the	c
toilets	c
or	c
to	i
do	i
some	c
other	c
small	c
jobs	c
.	c

Okay	c
do	c
n't	c
wait	c
,	c
there	i
where	i
you	i
're	i
good	i
at	i
and	i
begin	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
you	i
because	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
answer	i
the	c
information	c
that	c
you	c
ask	c
for	c
.	c

I	c
choose	c
swimming	c
because	c
I	c
really	c
love	c
doing	c
it	c
,	i
I	c
used	c
to	c
swim	c
every	c
day	c
in	c
the	c
sea	c
a	c
few	c
years	c
ago	c
,	i
I	c
felt	c
really	c
healthy	c
.	c

It	c
should	c
be	c
a	c
dry	c
place	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
but	i
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
make	c
sure	c
my	i
guess	i
,	i
as	i
well	i
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
will	c
need	c
,	c
because	c
it	i
is	i
also	i
all	i
paid	i
I	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
if	c
there	c
will	c
be	c
some	i
gift	c
shops	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

This	c
is	c
the	c
thing	c
that	c
move	i
hundred	i
and	c
hundreds	c
of	c
people	c
in	c
the	c
world	c
and	c
we	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
Japan	c
we	i
have	c
the	c
evidences	i
here	c
in	c
England	c
.	c

But	c
other	c
people	c
do	c
n't	c
think	c
like	c
this	c
,	i
for	i
example	c
,	c
there	c
is	c
a	c
case	c
of	c
a	c
woman	c
who	c
was	c
shopping	c
with	c
her	c
little	c
daughter	c
and	c
without	c
inttetion	i
the	c
girl	c
get	i
lost	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
the	i
thing	c
that	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
do	c
in	c
my	c
free	c
time	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
I	c
have	i
only	c
the	i
possibility	i
to	i
travel	i
in	c
July	c
because	c
in	c
August	c
I	c
will	c
start	c
a	c
new	c
job	c
for	c
six	c
months	c
.	c

For	i
accommodations	i
at	c
this	c
camp	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
being	i
in	c
a	c
tent	c
to	c
being	i
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
.	c

It	c
will	c
allow	c
me	c
to	c
make	c
friends	c
more	c
quickly	c
.	c

Two	c
of	c
my	c
best	i
activities	c
are	c
swimming	c
and	c
photography	c
.	c

I	c
like	c
go	i
in	i
nature	i
and	c
make	i
photography	i
.	c

Could	c
you	c
tell	c
me	c
if	c
you	c
would	i
lend	c
me	c
some	c
material	i
for	i
photography	i
?	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
so	c
happy	c
with	i
the	c
experience	c
I	c
lived	i
last	c
month	c
.	c

I	i
was	c
really	c
great	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
starting	c
to	c
sell	c
the	c
tickets	c
when	c
a	i
person	i
who	i
organised	i
told	c
me	c
to	c
go	c
into	c
the	c
lodge	i
.	c

They	c
needed	c
one	c
person	c
for	i
putting	i
the	c
clothes	c
into	c
a	c
wardrobe	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
the	c
lodge	i
of	c
Mylene	c
Farmer	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
so	c
exciting	i
!	c

All	i
were	i
very	c
kindly	i
and	c
pleasant	c
.	c

Finally	i
these	i
people	c
are	c
like	c
us	c
,	c
they	c
have	i
just	i
a	c
special	c
job	c
with	c
special	i
times	i
.	c

They	c
will	c
organise	c
a	i
same	c
concert	i
pop	i
but	c
with	c
an	i
other	i
singer	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

Dear	c
MANANGER	i
of	c
the	c
theatre	c

He	c
worked	c
day	c
and	c
night	c
.	c

One	c
month	c
later	c
,	c
his	c
worked	i
was	c
complete	c
,	c
but	c
he	c
was	c
afraid	c
of	i
testing	i
his	c
machine	c
,	c
so	c
he	c
called	c
Pat	c
and	c
spoke	c
about	i
it	c
.	c

The	c
machine	c
worked	c
really	c
good	i
.	c

I	c
prefer	c
in	i
tents	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
go	c
to	i
camp	i
,	c
I	c
stay	c
in	c
a	i
log	c
cabins	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
so	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
try	c
different	i
way	c
to	c
stay	i
,	c
this	c
time	c
.	c

My	c
job	c
at	i
behind	c
the	c
stage	c
was	c
helping	c
make-up	i
,	c
hare	i
and	c
clothes	c
staylist	i
.	c

It	c
was	c
very	c
hard	c
.	c

There	c
was	c
no	c
time	c
to	c
rest	c
.	c

In	i
front	i
of	i
the	i
stage	i
was	i
so	i
many	i
people	i
and	c
they	c
could	c
n't	c
see	c
them	c
very	c
well	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
was	c
at	i
very	c
near	c
from	i
the	c
stage	c
and	c
I	c
could	c
see	c
them	c
just	c
there	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
do	c
n't	c
go	c
to	c
a	c
concert	c
!	c

Work	c
at	c
a	c
concert	c
!	c

We	c
have	c
n't	c
met	i
each	c
other	c
so	i
long	c
time	c
and	c
I	c
'll	c
tell	c
you	c
more	c
story	i
of	i
this	c
.	c

Write	c
soon	c
,	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
about	c
wich	i
sort	c
of	c
close	i
I	c
have	c
got	c
to	c
take	c
?	c

And	c
I	c
also	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
have	c
got	c
to	c
take	c

At	c
all	c

is	c
a	c
similar	c
daily	c
life	c
wich	i
must	c

,	i
this	i
is	c
a	i
important	c
part	c
of	c
our	c
life	c
,	c
wich	i
is	c
full	c
of	c
emotions	i
in	i
development	i
.	c

Can	c
you	c
imagine	c
how	c
disappointed	c
I	c
was	c
when	c
I	c
saw	c
the	i
different	c
actors	c
on	c
the	c
stage	c
?	c

According	c
to	c
the	c
advertisement	c
the	c
show	c
is	i
to	c
start	c
at	c
19:30	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
the	c
chef	c
was	c
sick	c
!	c

I	c
insist	c
you	c
should	i
refund	c
all	c
the	c
money	c
that	c
I	c
wasted	c
in	c
your	c
theatre	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
we	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
to	c
wash	c
our	c
face	c
with	c
cold	c
water	c
even	c
if	c
it	c
is	c
freezing	i
morning	c
.	c

We	c
can	c
live	c
in	c
a	c
clean	c
and	c
comfortably	c
air-conditioned	c
house	c
.	c

And	c
we	c
can	c
speak	c
to	c
anyone	c
at	c
anytime	c
on	c
a	c
phone	c
even	c
if	c
he	c
or	c
she	c
is	c
abroad	c

In	i
these	i
days	c
,	c
many	c
kinds	c
of	c
pollution	c
have	c
been	c
caused	c
by	c
our	c
modern	c
life	i
.	c

Air	c
pollution	c
by	i
cars	c
,	c
Soil	c
pollution	c
by	i
industrial	c
wastes	i
.	c

The	c
sea	c
is	c
also	c
polluted	c
by	c
oil	c
and	c
chemical	i
detergent	i
which	c
is	i
used	c
at	i
home	i
.	c

Even	c
food	c
is	c
polluted	c
.	c

All	c
of	c
us	c
must	c
notice	c
this	c
fact	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
fan	c
of	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
so	c
your	c
advert	c
attracted	c
me	c
but	c
when	c
I	c
went	c
there	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
was	c
in	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
instead	c
of	c
him	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
your	c
timetable	c
was	c
wrong	c
.	c

It	c
said	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
at	c
14.30	c
but	c
,	c
actually	c
,	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
20.15	c
so	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
wait	c
for	c
about	c
six	c
hours	c
.	c

Thirdly	c
,	c
I	c
saw	c
"	c
Discount	c
Available	c
"	c
on	c
your	c
advert	c
but	c
your	c
staffs	i
said	c
it	c
was	c
just	c
for	c
Mondays	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
we	c
visited	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

Your	c
advert	c
promised	c
me	c
"	i
Perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
"	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
terrible	i
evening	c
to	i
me	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
want	c
you	c
to	c
give	c
me	c
a	c
refund	c
.	c

How	c
has	c
mordern	i
technology	c
changed	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
?	c

I	c
know	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
excercise	c
but	c
it	c
is	c
difficult	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
start	c
.	c

Modern	c
technology	c
has	c
changed	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
from	c
physical	c
activity	c
to	c
mental	c
activity	c
(	c
?	c
?	c
)	c

I	c
recive	i
a	c
paper	i
where	i
I	c
was	c
told	c
about	c
a	c
play	c
you	c
are	c
presenting	i
and	c
of	c
the	c
advantages	c
I	c
would	c
recive	i
if	c
I	c
go	i
to	c
see	c
it	c
,	i
think	i
that	c
never	i
happend	i
.	c

Second	c
,	c
it	c
says	c
that	c
the	c
play	c
would	c
start	c
at	c
19:30	c
,	c
and	c
it	c
realy	i
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
.	c

thank	c
you	c

Shows	i
you	c
how	c
they	c
affront	i
it	c
and	c
what	c
is	i
life	i
,	c
real	c
life	c

Also	c
,	c
that	c
they	c
would	i
invite	c
psicologist	i

the	c
Autor	i
of	c
the	c

may	i

I	c
recommend	c
you	c

hear	i
it	c

I	c
would	c
rather	i
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
the	i
tent	c
than	c
to	i
stay	i
in	c
the	c
log	c
cabin	c
because	c
the	i
tent	c
is	c
more	c
enjoyable	c

Should	c
I	c
take	c
my	c
clothes	c
with	c
me	c
or	c
are	c
they	c
arranged	i
in	c
the	c
camp	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c

all	c
your	c

are	c
well	c
and	c
everything	c
is	c
ok	i

I	c
wish	c
you	c
were	i
there	c
and	c
saw	i
the	c
concert	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
really	c
brilliant	c

As	c
you	c
know	c
I	i
'd	c
never	c
been	c

After	c
that	c
I	c
applied	c
and	c
they	c
accepted	c
my	c
application	c
.	c

You	c
should	c
have	c
seen	c
,	i
there	c
was	c
really	i
terrible	c
rush	c
before	c
concert	i
and	c
everybody	c
was	c
runing	i
around	c
to	i
do	i
something	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Brown	c
,	c

Besides	c
this	c
,	c
we	c
have	c
invited	c
all	c
other	i
teachers	c
and	c
the	c
Principal	c
of	c
our	c
school	c
.	c

Of	c
course	c
all	c
the	c
class	c
will	c
take	c
party	i
to	i
this	c
party	c
.	c

So	c
we	c
would	c
appreciate	c
if	i
you	c
help	i
us	c
with	c
this	c
matter	c
.	c

If	c
he	c
needs	c
something	c
else	c
,	c
we	c
are	c
happy	c
to	c
buy	c
this	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
especially	c
as	c
I	c
am	c
concerned	c
about	c
this	c
matter	c
.	c

Nowadays	c
people	c
's	c
life	c
has	c
many	c
problems	c
which	c
need	c
some	c
solutions	c
.	c

Especially	i
younger	i
's	i
life	i
has	i
been	c
very	c
difficult	c
the	i
last	c
years	i
.	c

The	c
only	c
appropriate	c
to	i
solve	c
people	c
's	c
problems	c
is	c
the	c
family	c
.	c

Their	c
family	c
could	c
explain	c
them	i
how	c
they	c
avoid	c
things	c
.	c

Apart	c
from	c
this	c
,	c
parents	c
could	c
be	c
very	c
helpful	c
to	c
their	c
children	c
with	i
difficulties	c
of	i
school	c
.	c

They	c
help	c
their	c
children	c
with	c
lessons	c
and	c
give	c
them	c
some	c
useful	c
advice	c
with	c
their	c
relationships	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
friends	c
are	c
not	c
suitable	c
to	i
do	i
this	c
.	c

Definately	i
,	i
they	i
do	c
n't	c
give	c
real	c
solutions	c
and	c
advice	c
.	c

There	c
is	c
a	c
chance	c
not	i
to	i
be	i
so	i
good	c
friends	c
and	c
imitate	i
that	c
they	c
are	c
.	c

So	c
we	c
should	c
trust	c
only	c
our	c
family	c
when	c
we	c
need	c
help	c
or	c
solutions	c
of	i
our	c
problems	c
.	c

I	c
've	c
just	c
recived	i
your	c
leter	i
,	c
and	c
I	c
must	c
say	c
that	c
I	c
am	c
so	c
surprised	c
,	i
I	c
was	c
n't	c
expecting	c
to	c
win	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
still	i
studing	i
at	c
the	c
moment	c
I	c
will	c
finish	c
at	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
June	c
so	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
leave	c
at	c
the	c
begining	i
of	c
July	c
.	c

I	i
've	i
got	i
some	i
problem	c
to	i
sleep	i
and	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
will	c
be	c
more	c
peaceful	c
than	c
a	c
ten	i
.	c

But	c
in	i
the	i
other	i
hand	i
,	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
done	i
surfing	c
,	i
I	c
am	c
a	c
completely	i
Beginer	i
but	c
I	c
am	c
dieing	i
to	c
do	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
've	c
got	c
just	c
one	c
question	c
to	c
do	i
,	i
I	c
know	c
it	c
is	c
all	c
include	i
,	c
but	c
is	c
there	c
anything	c
I	c
will	c
have	c
to	c
pay	c
for	c
?	c

Yours	c
Faithfully	c
:	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
we	c
should	c
have	c
a	c
protagonist	c
for	c
it	c
.	c

A	c
good	c
idea	c
to	c
start	c
will	c
be	c
a	i
clock	i
alarm	i
ringing	c
close	c
to	c
his	c
bed	c
,	c
because	c
that	c
's	c
the	c
way	c
everyone	c
get	i
up	c
in	c
the	c
morning	c
,	i
(	c
unless	i
the	c
people	c
who	c
do	c
n't	c
do	c
anythink	i
)	c

After	c
that	c
,	c
we	c
should	c
have	c
a	c
morning	c
view	i
of	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
most	i
busiest	i
London	c
tube	c
station	i
in	c
order	c
to	c
show	c
stressed	c
people	c
going	c
in	c
and	c
out	c
,	c
Including	i
our	c
protagonist	c
going	i
out	i
peacefully	c
with	c
a	c
couple	c
of	c
books	c
on	i
his	c
hand	c
-	c
then	c
the	c
school	c
's	c
door	c
,	c
and	c
him	c
going	c
in	c
.	c

After	c
all	i
this	c
introduction	c
,	c
will	i
be	c
the	i
time	c
to	c
show	c
some	c
of	c
the	c
acitivities	i
every	i
one	i
can	c
join	i
in	i
the	c
school	c
,	c
such	i
as	i
lesons	i
or	i
others	i
like	i
the	i
library	i
,	i
our	i
protagonist	i
having	i
a	i
cofe	i
with	i
some	i
coleagues	i
in	i
the	i
cofe	i
bar	i
,	i
the	i
reception	i
service.	i
.	c

And	c
finally	c
a	c
view	i
of	c
all	c
the	c
students	c
leaving	c
the	c
school	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
nice	c
end	i
.	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
glad	c
to	c
hear	c
that	c
I	c
had	c
won	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
the	c
competition	c
.	c

Anyway	c
,	c
to	c
participate	c
in	c
two-weeks	c
Camp	i
California	c
in	c
the	c
U.S.A	c
I	c
readily	c
give	c
you	c
my	c
personal	c
details	c
and	c
information	c
.	c

Additionally	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
happy	c
to	c
be	c
given	c
the	c
chance	c
to	c
do	c
some	c
activities	c
during	c
the	c
stay	c
.	c

I	c
used	c
to	c
belong	c
to	c
a	c
swimming	c
club	c
and	c
practise	c
swimming	c
a	c
couple	c
of	c
times	c
a	c
week	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
painting	c
beautiful	c
landscapes	c
of	c
California	c
.	c

Last	c
but	c
not	c
at	c
least	c
,	c
what	c
sort	c
of	c
clothes	c
do	c
you	c
think	c
I	c
must	c
bring	c
with	c
me	c
,	c
and	c
is	c
there	c
any	c
laundry	c
system	c
there	c
?	c

Also	c
should	c
I	c
take	c
some	c
money	c
just	c
in	c
case	c
?	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
be	c
very	c
grateful	c
for	c
your	c
help	c
.	c

Lessons	c

According	c
to	c
statistics	c
based	c
on	c
the	c
questionnair	i
,	c
the	c
majority	c
of	c
students	c
feel	c
the	c
most	c
enthusiasm	c
for	c
an	c
English	c
class	c
.	c

This	c
may	c
be	c
thanks	c
to	c
native	i
speaker	i
teachers	c
who	c
came	c
to	c
the	c
school	c
last	c
year	c
.	c

Consequently	c
it	i
might	c
be	c
a	c
good	c
idea	c
to	c
film	c
the	c
English	c
class	c
so	c
that	c
the	c
vibrant	c
and	c
active	c
atomosphere	i
may	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
be	c
filmed	c
.	c

As	c
the	c
record	c
says	c
,	c
our	c
hockey	c
team	c
has	c
been	c
on	i
the	c
top	c
of	c
the	c
league	c
for	c
three	c
successive	c
years	c
.	c

The	c
whole	c
point	c
of	c
making	c
a	c
video	c
is	c
to	c
tell	c
people	c
that	c
we	c
are	c
not	c
only	c
bugs	i
of	i
books	i
but	c
also	c
enjoying	c
our	c
school	c
life	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
,	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

The	i
science	i
and	c
technology	c
have	c
changed	c
my	c
life	i
every	i
day	i
.	c

When	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
child	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
use	c
the	c
computer	c
because	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
know	c
what	c
is	i
that	i
.	c

The	c
new	c
invents	i
have	c
transformed	c
my	c
life	c
,	c
so	c
it	c
is	c
easier	c
with	c
the	i
modern	i
technologies	i
(	c
the	c
mobile	c
,	c
the	c
car	c
,	c
the	c
plane	c
,	c
the	c
coach	c
,	c
the	c
train	c
,	c
the	c
medical	c
advances	c
and	c
domestic	c
machines	i
)	c
,	c
they	c
have	c
done	i
more	c
confortable	i
and	c
pleasure	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
I	c
went	c
last	i
week	c
.	c

I	c
spent	c
a	c
week	c
's	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
and	c
I	c
had	c
been	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
watching	i
a	c
wonderful	c
show	c
in	c
your	c
theatre	c
.	c

It	i
would	c
never	c
happen	c
in	c
my	c
country	c
I	c
must	c
say	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
there	c
was	i
no	c
discounts	c
despite	c
you	i
showed	i
it	i
was	i
available	c
in	c
your	c
advertisement	c
.	c

The	c
actor	c
who	c
played	i
instead	c
of	c
him	c
was	c
terrible	c
.	c

In	c
fact	c
,	c
I	c
expect	c
a	c
full	c
refund	c
plus	c
compensation	c
for	c
the	c
dissatisfaction	i
suffured	i
.	c

When	c
we	c
think	c
about	c
clothes	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
,	c
we	c
should	c
think	c
about	c
the	c
enviroment	i
first	c
.	c

Of	c
course	c
,	c
technologies	i
will	c
have	c
developped	i
enough	c
to	i
invent	c
new	c
material	c
for	c
those	c
kind	i
of	c
clothes	c
.	c

So	c
we	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
to	c
worry	c
about	c
how	c
heavey	i
they	c
will	c
be	c
.	c

We	c
should	c
consider	c
wearing	i
as	i
in	i
more	i
practical	i
way	i
.	c

I	c
have	c
just	c
returned	c
from	c
my	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

During	c
my	c
stay	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
see	c
a	c
musical	c
show	c
in	i
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
and	c
I	c
have	i
very	i
disappointing	c
evening	c
.	c

What	c
is	c
more	c
you	i
advertize	i
there	c
were	c
discounts	c
available	c
but	c
it	i
were	c
not	c
.	c

You	c
said	c
that	c
the	c
musicial	i
show	c
started	c
at	c
19.30	c
but	c
recently	i
it	c
began	c
at	c
20.15	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
bored	c
because	c
I	c
did	c
not	c
have	c
anything	c
to	c
do	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
waiting	c
for	c
your	c
show	c
.	c

Additionally	c
I	c
felt	c
very	c
hungry	c
and	c
uncomfortable	c
because	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
and	c
you	c
did	c
not	c
give	c
us	c
any	c
reason	c
why	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
you	i
are	c
not	c
very	c
respectful	i
and	c
responsible	c
.	c

Your	i
faithfully	c
,	c

We	c
lived	c
in	c
the	c
same	c
street	c
and	c
the	i
weekends	i
we	i
spent	i
together	i
.	c

Paul	c
was	c
older	c
than	c
me	c
and	c
he	c
was	i
playing	i
basketball	c
.	c

Only	c
Pat	c
knew	c
about	c
my	c
lover	c
.	c

Everything	c
was	c
great	c
.	c

Everybody	c
started	c
to	c
laught	i
at	c
me	c
.	c

This	c
alien	i
was	c
so	c
intelligent	c
and	c
funny	c
that	c
I	c
forgot	c
about	c
my	c
troubles	c
.	c

We	c
met	c
again	c
and	c
again	c
and	c
now	c
Jon	c
is	c
my	c
husband	c
.	c

Dear	c
sir	c
,	c

And	c
you	c
have	i
written	c
in	c
your	c
advert	c
,	i
that	c
there	c
would	c
be	c
discounts	c
available	c
,	c
what	i
was	i
n't	i
possible	i
this	i
evening	c
.	c

Finally	c
we	c
had	i
no	i
perfect	i
evening	c
at	c
all	c
!	c

Yours	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
last	c
summer	c
,	c
we	c
were	c
on	c
a	c
short	c
trip	c
with	c
our	c
class	c
to	c
a	i
adventure-park	i
.	c

Until	c
we	c
came	c
to	c
a	c
big	c
cave	c
,	c
where	c
you	c
could	c
walk	c
through	c
.	c

I	c
walked	c
first	i
with	c
Pat	c
and	c
two	c
of	c
my	c
friends	c
.	c

We	c
lost	c
the	c
others	c
.	c

And	c
after	c
a	c
while	c
we	c
found	c
the	c
way	c
out	c
.	c

After	c
that	c
was	i
all	c
clear	c
,	c
Pat	c
and	c
secrets	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
this	c
letter	c
to	c
you	c
,	c
because	c
the	c
show	c
"	c
Over	c

which	i
is	c
the	i
London	c
's	c
newest	c
and	c
best	c
musical	c
show	c
,	c
was	c
not	c
...	c
for	c
me	c

Pleas	i
apologise	i
me	c
,	c
but	c
there	c
were	c
many	c
mistakes	c
and	c
problems	c
on	c
the	c
note	i
you	i
have	i
made	i
,	c
which	c
disappointed	c
me	c
very	c

Please	c
,	c
if	c
you	c
would	c
be	c
so	c
kind	c
and	i
mind	i
correct	c
this	c
mistake	c

I	c
would	c
be	c
gratefull	i
if	c
you	c
could	c
correct	c
too	c
that	i
show	i
start	i
at	i
20.15	i
not	i
on	i
19.30	i

I	c
would	c
be	c
very	c
grateful	c
if	c
I	c
could	c
get	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

It	c
started	c
a	c
week	c
before	c
that	c
day	c

I	c
made	c
a	i
beautifull	i

My	c

I	c
made	c
a	i
perfect	c
decoration	i
with	c

other	c
party	c

Everyone	c
told	c

Everything	c
was	c
set	c

the	c
day	c
and	c

Everyone	c
gathered	c
in	c

We	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

As	c
you	c
know	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
great	c
time	c
helping	c
at	c
a	c
PoP	i
Concert	i
.	c

As	c
you	c
known	i
I	i
can	c
do	c
a	c
little	c
of	c
everything	c
so	c
I	c
accepted	c
.	c

I	c
connected	c
wires	c
,	c
I	c
caried	i
loudspeakers	c
,	c
and	c
so	c
on	c
.	c

We	c
started	c
talking	c
about	c
music	c
and	c
I	c
asked	c
Him	i
many	c
things	c
about	c
His	i
texts	i
,	c
which	c
are	c
beautiful	c
but	c
sometimes	c
difficult	c
to	c
understand	c

looking	c

you	c

With	c
my	c
best	c
wishes	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
.	c

It	c
'd	c
be	c
great	c
if	c
I	c
could	c
be	i
accommodated	i
in	c
tents	i
,	c
because	c
I	c
've	c
never	c
slept	c
in	c
tents	i
before	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
an	c
interesting	c
experience	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
the	c
two	c
activities	c
wich	i
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
pratice	i
during	c
the	c
campsite	i
are	c
sailing	c
and	c
surfing	c
.	c

Although	c
I	c
know	c
how	c
surfing	i
,	c
I	c
have	c
no	c
idea	c
about	c
sailing	c
,	i
I	c
just	i
only	c
read	c
about	c
it	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
interested	c
to	i
practice	i
.	c

How	c
much	c
?	c

The	c
problem	c
is	c
find	i
a	c
shop	c
assistant	c
who	c
hear	i
your	i
problems	c
and	c
can	c
help	c
you	c
.	c

After	c
that	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
wait	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
in	c
the	c
qeue	i
to	c
pay	c
and	c
many	c
times	c
is	i
n't	c
possible	c
pay	i
with	c
your	c
credit	c
card	c
and	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
a	i
money	c
in	c
cash	c
.	c

Dear	c
Ms.	c
Ryan	c
,	c

At	c
the	c
moment	c
,	c
I	c
'm	c
worried	c
of	i
about	c
not	c
being	c
able	c
to	c
enjoy	c
it	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
recently	c
achieved	i
a	c
new	c
job	c
and	c
I	c
started	c
working	c
just	c
three	c
months	c
ago	c
.	c

As	c
far	c
as	c
I	c
am	c
concerned	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
an	i
accomodation	i
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
,	c
but	c
in	c
case	c
there	c
are	c
no	c
cabins	c
left	c
I	c
can	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
tend	i
as	c
well	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
already	c
know	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
trying	c
to	c
become	c
a	c
professional	c
photographer	c
,	c
consequently	c
I	c
would	c
choose	c
photograpy	i
as	c
the	c
first	c
activities	i
and	c
painting	c
as	c
the	c
second	c
.	c

In	c
this	c
case	c
I	c
would	c
rather	c
do	c
some	c
climbing	c
,	c
which	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
done	c
before	c
.	c

In	c
general	c
,	c
shopping	c
is	c
considered	c
a	c
pleasant	c
activity	c
.	c

Actualy	i
most	c
people	c
work	c
hard	c
to	c
earn	c
their	c
money	c
and	c
consequently	c
,	c
the	c
occasion	c
in	i
which	c
this	c
money	c
is	c
spent	c
to	c
buy	c
something	c
useful	c
,	c
or	c
simply	c
something	c
they	c
like	c
,	c
should	c
be	c
considered	c
a	c
very	c
pleasant	c
situation	i
.	c

Personally	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
like	c
dealing	c
with	c
shop	c
assistants	c
and	c
looking	c
around	c
the	c
shops	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
buy	c
all	c
what	i
I	c
can	c
using	c
"	c
on-line	c
"	c
services	c
.	c

I	c
must	c
say	c
that	c
International	i
Arts	c
Festival	c
is	c
really	c
great	i
idea	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
can	c
make	c
your	c
festival	c
more	c
popular	c
.	c

Your	c
dance	c
shows	c
are	c
very	c
beautiful	c
,	c
art	i
exhibitions	i
is	c
something	c
original	c
and	c
exciting	c
.	c

And	c
also	c
it	c
is	c
very	c
interesting	c
to	c
talk	c
with	c
writers	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
will	c
continue	c
to	i
making	i
your	c
festivals	c
.	c

Your	i
faithfully	c
,	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
last	c
letter	c
.	c

The	c
question	c
you	c
asked	c
me	c
in	c
it	c
is	c
very	c
original	c
too	c
.	c

Every	c
school	c
has	c
it	i
's	i
own	c
rules	c
.	c

We	c
are	c
all	c
very	c
friendly	c
in	c
our	c
class	c
and	c
we	c
help	c
to	i
each	c
other	c
when	c
we	c
have	c
a	c
problem	c
.	c

So	c
the	c
main	c
rule	c
in	c
our	c
school	c
is	c
regarding	i
theachers	i
.	c

I	c
'm	c
allowed	c
to	c
do	c
many	c
things	c
at	c
home	c
.	c

And	c
the	c
main	c
reason	c
Why	i
our	c
family	c
is	c
so	c
friendly	c
,	i
it	i
's	i
because	c
we	c
have	c
n't	c
go	i
many	c
rules	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
there	c
is	c
n't	c
something	i
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
change	c
.	c

Take	c
care	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
a	c
letter	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
I	c
saw	c
last	c
week	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

It	c
could	i
make	i
things	c
worse	c
that	c
the	i
visit	c
to	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
,	c
which	c
had	c
already	c
been	c
closed	c
because	c
of	c
lack	i
of	c
customers	c
,	c
was	c
canceled	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
be	c
grateful	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
give	c
the	i
money	c
back	c
.	c

If	c
I	c
cannot	c
get	c
your	i
satisfying	i
reply	c
within	c
a	c
month	c
I	c
shall	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
consumer	c
protection	c
organisation	c
to	c
sue	c
you	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Our	c
life	c
has	c
been	c
influenced	i
by	c
modern	c
technology	c
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
we	c
should	c
work	c
hard	c
to	c
learn	i
knowledges	i
,	i
making	i
the	c
future	c
better	c
and	c
better	c

I	c

your	c
letter	c
this	c
morning	c

I	c
would	c

staying	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
n't	c
done	c
it	c
before	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
give	c
it	c
a	c
go	c
.	c

I	c
also	i
would	i
like	c
to	c
chose	i
basketball	c
and	c
surfing	c
as	c
two	c
activities	c
to	c
do	c
while	c
I	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

How	c
are	c
you	c
?	c

I	c
am	c
fine	c
.	c

When	c
they	i
've	i
finished	i
singing	c
the	c
last	c
song	c
I	c
was	c
surprice	i
when	c
they	c
called	c
me	c
up	c
on	c
the	c
stage	c
and	c
said	c
thank	c
you	c
to	c
me	c
in	c
front	c
of	c
hundreds	c
of	c
people	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
sure	c
that	c
I	c
'll	c
never	c
forget	c
that	c
moment	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
and	c
reply	i
to	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
according	i
to	i
your	c
letter	c
you	c
asked	c
me	c
my	c
prefered	i
travel	c
dates	c
.	c

If	c
it	c
is	c
possible	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
only	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
going	c
to	c
go	i
on	c
my	i
holiday	c
in	c
July	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
be	c
in	c
tents	c
because	c
I	c
can	i
find	c
it	i
being	c
in	c
tents	c
more	c
comfortable	c
than	c
being	c
in	c
log	c
cabins	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
not	c
goot	i
at	c
both	i
of	c
them	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
also	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
whether	c
someone	c
will	c
be	c
at	c
the	c
airport	c
for	c
me	c
because	c
this	c
will	c
be	c
the	i
first	c
time	c
in	c
the	c
U.S.A	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

I	c
had	c
to	c
make	c
the	c
fan	i
to	i
keep	i
a	i
queue	c
.	c

I	c
also	c
make	i
them	c
find	c
their	c
seats	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
I	c
always	c
spoke	c
loudly	c
and	c
run	i
fast	c
.	c

I	c
saw	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
singers	c
and	c
entertainers	c
.	c

Best	c
whishes	i

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
to	c
give	c
some	c
opinion	i
about	c
the	c
International	c
Arts	c
Festival	c
that	c
you	c
have	i
organized	i
last	c
November	c
.	c

In	c
fact	c
they	i
came	c
from	c
six	c
countries	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
be	c
grateful	c
if	c
,	c
next	c
year	c
,	c
you	c
could	c
put	i
more	c
art	c
exhibitions	c
(	c
with	c
more	c
pictures	c
)	c
in	c
the	c
program	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
offer	c
you	c
one	c
suggestion	c
that	c
concers	i
the	c
classical	c
concerts	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
interesting	c
to	c
invite	c
young	c
compositors	i
to	c
hear	c
news	i
from	c
the	i
classical	c
music	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
country	c
there	c
are	c
some	c
rules	c
that	c
are	c
the	c
same	c
in	c
all	c
schools	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
we	c
have	c
to	c
wear	i
in	c
appropriate	i
way	c
,	c
not	c
talk	c
to	c
each	c
other	c
during	c
the	c
lessons	c
and	c
pay	c
attention	c
to	c
the	c
teachers	c
.	c

At	c
this	c
time	c
,	c
in	c
my	c
school	c
there	c
is	c
a	c
new	c
rule	c
.	c

We	c
are	c
n't	c
allowed	c
to	c
use	c
the	i
mobile	c
phone	c
in	c
class	c
.	c

For	c
me	c
,	c
it	c
's	c
very	c
stressfull	i
and	c
I	c
usually	c
run	c
a	c
lot	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
.	c

In	c
fact	c
(	c
you	c
know	c
)	c
I	c
like	c
cheat	i
with	c
my	c
class	i
mates	i
after	c
our	c
lessons	c
.	c

Neighbours	c
have	c
complained	c
about	c
loud	c
music	c
.	c

Love	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c
because	c
now	c
I	c
am	c
on	c
holiday	c
.	c

My	c
holidays	c
will	c
finish	c
in	i
the	c
begining	i
of	c
September	c
and	c
will	i
be	c
good	c
to	c
travel	c
during	c
this	c
time	i
.	c

(	c
August-September	c
)	c
.	c

The	c
accommodation	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
tents	i
because	c
I	c
like	c
adventures	c
and	c
also	c
I	c
will	c
have	c
more	c
contact	c
with	c
the	i
nature	c
.	c

For	c
the	c
time	c
that	c
I	c
will	c
spend	c
there	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
chose	i
more	c
the	i
two	c
activities	c
but	c
I	c
know	c
is	i
not	c
possible	c
so	c
I	c
chose	i
swimming	c
and	c
singing	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
quite	c
good	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
some	c
questions	c
like	c
which	i
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	i
have	c
to	c

Is	i
necessery	i

I	c

I	c
will	c
have	c
my	c

I	c

Dear	c

Do	c
you	c
enjoy	c
your	c
schoollife	i
?	c

At	c
that	c
time	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
so	c
nervous	c
because	c
I	c
did	c
not	c
know	c
what	c
to	c
do	c
.	c

There	c
were	c
five	c
other	c
students	c
,	c
like	c
me	c
,	c
who	c
were	c
waiting	c
to	c
help	c
.	c

We	c
were	c
told	c
that	c
we	c
were	c
responsible	c
for	c
decorating	c
the	c
hall	c
.	c

There	c
were	c
lots	c
of	c
decorations	c
and	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
put	c
the	c
decorations	c
to	i
the	c
right	c
place	c
.	c

She	c
smiled	c
at	c
me	c
and	c
said	c
thank	c
you	c
to	c
me	c

Could	c
you	c
tell	c
me	c
what	c
your	c

this	i
time	c
.	c

Although	c
,	i
the	c
accommodation	c
is	c
n't	c
so	c
important	c
for	c
me	c
.	i

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
the	c
log	c
cabin	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
comfort	c
and	c
the	c
better	c
bed	c
.	c

What	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
are	c
needed	c
?	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

I	c
had	i
once	i
this	c
problem	c
.	c

Sometimes	c
they	c
give	c
me	c
a	c
bad	c
feeling	c
as	i
,,customer	i
treat	i
with	i
order	i
"	i
.	c

Last	c
week	c
I	c
was	c
shopping	c
with	c
my	c
younger	c
brother	c
.	c

All	c
the	c
stuff	c
for	c
children	c
are	i
in	i
the	c
same	c
level	c
as	c
they	i
have	i
their	c
eyes	c
.	c

The	c
shops	c
have	c
bad	c
opening	c
times	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
feel	c
me	i
comfortable	i
for	c
shopping	c
everything	c
will	i
be	i
closed	c
or	c
you	i
have	c
n't	c
enough	c
time	c
to	c
look	c
around	c
.	c

My	c
conclusion	c
on	c
these	c
points	c
are	i
not	c
so	c
bad	c
.	c

I	c
like	c
shopping	c
at	i
all	i

Dear	c
Sir	c

Madam	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
my	c
unpleasant	c
experience	c
of	c
visiting	c
your	c
theatre	c
on	c
May	c
21st	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
all	c
my	c
expectations	c
failed	c
to	c
become	i
true	c
.	c

Next	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
instead	c
of	c
19:30	c
.	c

So	c
he	c
was	c
replaced	c
by	c
another	c
actor	c
.	c

As	i
a	i
whole	i
,	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
I	c
got	c
something	c
completely	c
different	c
from	c
what	c
I	c
had	c
expected	c
to	c
get	c
.	c

In	c
connection	c
with	c
that	c
I	c
ask	c
you	c
to	c
refund	c
the	c
money	c
I	c
paid	c
for	c
my	c
tickets	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

And	c
the	c
best	c
word	c
I	c
can	c
describe	i
all	c
the	c
changes	c
with	i
is	c
"	c
drastical	i
"	c
.	c

It	c
takes	c
me	c
less	c
than	c
a	c
minute	c
to	c
get	c
in	c
touch	c
with	c
my	c
friend	c
Nigel	c
living	c
in	c
Australia	c
-	c
thousand	i
kilometres	i
'	i
from	i
me	c
.	c

Computer	i
,	c
probably	c
the	c
must	c

to	c
get	c
an	i
access	c
to	c
huge	i
informatonal	i

through	c

,	c
to	c
make	i

more	c
effectively	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

The	c
show	c
should	c
have	c
started	c
t	i
19.30	c
.	c

We	c
kept	i
waiting	c
for	c
45	c
minutes	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
the	c
people	c
who	c
came	c
there	c
should	c
be	c
paid	i
back	i
.	c

People	c
used	c
to	c
wear	c
very	c
diffrent	i
things	c
from	c
the	c
clothes	c
we	c
wear	c
now	c
,	c
we	c
would	c
n't	c
even	c
say	c
that	c
they	c
are	c
'	c
clothes	c
'	c
.	c

We	c
regard	i
that	c
the	c
show	c
might	c
be	c
great	i
opportunity	c
for	c
the	i
most	c
of	c
us	c
who	c
are	c
interested	c
in	c
fashion	c
and	c
leisure	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
get	c
your	c
suggestion	c
how	i
programme	i
could	c
be	c
changed	c
on	c
the	c
second-day	i
of	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c

to	c
getting	c
your	c
reply	c

your	i
sincerely	c

In	c
the	c
middle	c
age	i

Nobody	i

which	c
have	i
been	i
helping	i
to	c
do	c

Dear	c
Mrs.	c
Ryan	c
:	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
so	c
glad	c
to	c
know	c
I	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
.	c

Regarding	c
your	c
questions	c
,	c
the	c
following	c
are	c
my	c
answers	c
.	c

I	c
need	c
to	c
insist	c
in	i
it	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
not	c
able	c
to	c
take	c
holidays	c
during	c
the	c
rest	c
of	c
the	c
year	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
not	c
easy	c
to	c
chose	i
from	c
the	c
list	c
of	c
activities	c
,	i
all	i
of	c
them	c
look	c
interesting	c
.	c

Although	c
this	c
is	c
a	c
new	c
experience	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
climbing	c
and	c
Photographe	i
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

During	c
the	c
day	c
I	c
helped	c
preparing	i
her	c
room	c
,	c
then	c
she	c
arrived	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
there	c
to	c
continue	c
helping	c
.	c

She	c
was	c
so	c
kind	c
with	i
all	c
of	c
us	c
,	i
of	i
course	i
I	c
asked	c
her	c
for	c
an	c
autograph	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
to	c
see	c
you	c
soon	c
,	i
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
wait	c
to	c
show	c
it	c
.	i

Each	c
time	c
,	i
when	i
she	c
comes	i
back	c
to	c
the	c
room	c
,	c
she	c
asked	c
for	c
something	c
to	c
drink	c
,	c
just	c
a	c
diet	c
coke	c
,	c
because	c
she	c
's	c
always	c
looking	c
after	c
her	c
weight	i
.	c

Then	c
she	c
eat	i
something	c
small	c
and	c
she	c
looks	i
full	c
of	c
energy	c
all	c
night	c
long	c
.	c

At	c
the	c
end	c
,	c
she	c
took	c
the	c
time	c
to	c
say	c
good	i
by	i
to	c
all	c
of	c
the	c
people	c
helping	c
her	c
.	c

But	c
now	c
,	c
tell	c
me	c
about	c
you	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
could	c
you	c
give	c
me	c
an	c
idea	c
about	c
the	c
pocket	c
money	c
I	c
need	c
?	c

Please	c
do	c
not	c
hesitate	c
to	c
contact	c
me	c
if	c
you	c
need	c
more	c
information	c
about	c
me	c
.	c

Looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c

The	c
purpose	c
of	c
this	c
report	c
is	c
to	c
identify	c
which	c
lessons	c
or	c
other	c
activities	c
should	c
be	c
filmed	c
.	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
suggest	c
to	i
film	i
our	c
library	c
because	i
it	c
is	c
a	c
pleasant	c
place	c
that	c
students	c
really	c
like	c
and	i
the	c
English	c
course	i
which	i
will	c
help	c
foreign	c
students	c
for	i
their	c
future	c
choice	i
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

Another	c
problem	c
is	c
,	i
I	c
realised	i
that	c
the	i
discounts	c
were	c
available	c
.	c

Additionally	c
,	c
the	c
advertisement	c
said	c
I	c
can	i
visit	c
the	c
threatre	i
restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
arrived	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

I	c
expected	i
to	c
receive	c
the	i
money	c
back	c
within	c
these	i
two	c
days	c
.	c

Silvie	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrects	i
.	c

I	c
told	c
Pat	c
everything	c
even	c
my	c
secrects	i
when	c
we	c
were	c
still	c
friendly	c
.	c

I	c
told	c
her	c
because	c
I	c
wanted	c
somebody	c
to	c
share	c
my	c
feeling	i
.	c

May	i
be	i
it	c
was	c
a	i
wrong	c
decision	c
to	c
tell	c
her	c
,	i
she	i
began	c
to	c
spread	i
that	c
secrect	i
to	i
everybody	c
including	i
the	c
teachers	c
.	c

My	c
parents	c
were	c
very	c
angry	c
when	c
they	c
realised	c
what	c
happened	i
.	c

Also	c
,	c
I	c
prefer	c
sleeping	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
than	i
in	i
a	c
long	i
cabin	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
easier	c
to	c
clean	c
.	c

practise	c
any	c

in	c
their	c

This	c
is	c
an	c
extra	i

Taking	c

in	i
your	c
theatre	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
'm	c
asking	c
you	c
for	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
,	c
because	c
,	i
it	c
was	c
a	c
very	c
bad	c
evening	c
.	c

Sincerely	c
,	c

The	c
class	c
had	c
organized	c
a	c
secret	c
party	c
for	c
our	c
friend	c
,	i
Nick	c
that	i
was	c
leaving	c
the	c
school	c
on	i
2	c
more	c
weeks	c
.	c

At	i
the	i
beginning	i
Nick	c
got	c
angree	i
but	c
then	c
he	c
forgive	i
him	c
because	c
they	c
were	c
friend	i
and	c
each	c
of	c
one	i
can	i
trust	c
on	i
the	c
other	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
also	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
some	c
more	c
details	c
about	c
what	c
sort	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
will	c
have	c
to	c
bring	c
with	c
me	c
and	c
about	c
the	c
amount	c
of	c
money	c
which	c
will	i
be	c
necessary	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
take	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
joining	c
you	c
in	c
July	c
and	c
hoping	c
for	i
this	c
trip	c
to	i
be	i
an	c
amazing	c
experience	c

As	c
a	c
child	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
be	c
taken	c
to	c
the	c
mall	c
and	c
be	c
forced	c
to	c
go	c
through	c
all	c
the	c
shops	c
and	c
establishments	c
just	c
to	c
please	c
my	c
mother	c
,	c
whose	c
desire	c
to	c
buy	c
,	c
without	c
any	c
sort	c
of	c
control	c
,	c
all	c
kinds	c
of	c
clothes	c
and	c
gadgets	c
was	c
something	c
unbelievable	c
.	c

But	c
situations	c
in	c
which	c
you	c
do	c
not	c
need	c
to	c
move	c
carefully	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
avoid	c
stepping	c
on	c
someone	c
's	c
feet	c
are	c
quite	c
rare	c
and	c
,	c
when	c
they	c
do	c
happen	c
,	c
time	c
passes	c
by	c
very	c
fast	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
if	c
you	c
are	c
another	c
fool	c
standing	c
amidst	c
the	c
crowd	c
,	c
waiting	c
for	c
the	c
queue	c
to	c
move	c
,	c
time	c
slowly	c
melts	c
.	c

Nonetheless	c
,	c
people	c
still	c
find	c
some	c
obscure	c
pleasure	c
in	c
putting	c
their	c
mental	c
health	c
at	c
stake	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
answer	c
the	c
questions	c
you	c
asked	c
me	c
in	c
the	c
last	c
letter	c
you	c
sent	c
me	c
.	c

About	c
the	c
activities	c
that	c
I	c
can	c
do	c
at	c
the	c
camp	c
,	c
I	c
chose	c
to	c
practise	i
Basketball	c
,	c
which	c
is	c
my	c
favourite	c
sport	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
do	c
some	c
excersise	i
while	c
I	c
am	c
on	c
vacation	c
.	c

I	c
also	c
chose	c
Fotography	i
because	c
it	c
is	c
one	c
of	c
my	c
hobbies	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
both	c
activities	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
practised	i
them	c
all	c
my	c
life	c
.	c

I	c
also	c
wanted	c
to	c
know	c
if	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
some	c
money	c
to	c
buy	c
souvenirs	c
and	c
food	c
or	c
that	i
will	i
be	c
paid	c
for	c
me	i
,	c
too	c
?	c

Please	c
write	c
me	i
soon	c

Dear	c
Mr	i
Jane	i
Clark	c
,	c

My	c
name	c
is	c
Rosa	c
Santor	c
.	c

I	c
study	c
architecture	c
at	c
the	c
Polytechnics	i
in	c
Krakow	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
very	c
interested	c
in	c
art	c
,	c
specially	i
in	c
paintings	c
and	c
goings	i
to	c
galleries	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
writting	i
you	c
a	c
letter	c
,	c
because	c
you	c
are	c
the	c
organiser	c
of	c
an	c
International	c
Arts	c
Festival	c
.	c

I	c
recently	c
spent	c
two	c
days	c
at	c
this	c
festival	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
very	c
good	c
that	c
you	c
organised	c
an	c
International	c
Arts	c
Festival	c
in	c
our	c
country	c
,	c
but	c
in	c
my	c
opinion	c
if	i
this	c
is	c
an	c
international	c
festival	c
,	c
it	c
would	i
has	i
more	c
stars	c
and	c
artists	c
from	c
around	c
the	c
world	c
,	c
not	c
from	c
only	c
six	c
countries	c
,	c
like	c
it	i
was	i
this	c
year	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
great	i
idea	c
for	i
doing	i
something	c
like	c
that	c
.	c

Also	c
a	i
great	i
idea	i
was	i
,	i
that	i
it	i
was	i
one	c
reasonably-priced	c
weekend	c
ticket	c
for	c
all	c
events	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
,	c
as	c
a	c
person	c
,	i
who	c
in	i
this	i
festival	i
took	i
place	i
in	i
,	c
that	c
this	i
is	i
excellent	c
,	c
because	c
we	c
can	i
spend	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
time	c
with	c
art	c
.	c

There	c
is	c
only	c
one	c
bad	c
fhing	i
,	c
that	c
this	c
festival	c
was	c
too	c
short	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
next	i
year	c
it	c
should	c
take	c
place	c
much	i
longer	i
than	c
two	c
days	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
not	c
looking	i
foward	i
to	c

received	i
letter	i
from	c
you	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
know	c
,	i
that	c
you	c
are	c
busy	c
,	c
but	c
please	c
look	c
at	c
my	c
suggestion	c
for	c
next	c
year	c
's	c
festival	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerly	i
,	c

So	c
now	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
you	i
write	i
something	c
about	c
school	i
rules	c
in	c
my	c
country	c
and	c
also	c
what	c
I	c
am	c
allowed	c
to	c
do	c
at	c
home	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
know	c
I	i
'm	c
not	c
a	c
secondary	c
school	i
's	i
student	c
,	c
I	c
'm	c
now	c
a	c
student	c
of	c
architecture	c
in	c
Krakow	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
lessons	c
from	c
Monday	c
till	c
Friday	c
.	c

At	c
my	c
school	c
there	c
are	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
drawings	i
,	i
paintings	i
and	i
some	c
other	c
subjects	c
doing	i
by	c
hands	i
.	c

We	c
also	c
learn	c
how	c
to	c
design	c
the	i
interiors	c
and	c
buildings	c
.	c

We	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
tests	c
during	c
the	c
whole	c
student	c
year	c
,	c
only	c
at	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
the	c
class	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
troubbles	i
with	c
my	c
education	c
,	i
my	i
friends	c
and	c
teachers	c
are	c
nice	c
and	c
friendly	c
,	c
but	c
there	c
is	c
one	c
thing	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
change	c
in	c
my	c
school	c
.	c

I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
have	c
more	c
tests	c
during	c
the	c
whole	c
study	i
,	c
not	c
only	c
at	c
the	c
end	c
,	c
because	c
it	i
causes	i
that	i
I	i
'm	i
getting	i
very	c
lasy	i
.	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
received	i
a	i
new	i
letter	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
,	i
that	c
you	c
do	i
n't	i
forget	c
,	c
&	c
will	c
write	i
me	c
soon	c
.	c

Therefore	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
be	c
very	c
grateful	c
if	c
you	c
-	c
the	c
manager	c
of	c
the	c
theatre	c
-	c
could	c
send	c
me	c
the	c
money	c
back	c
,	c
at	c
least	c
the	c
money	c
I	c
spent	c
on	c
the	c
ticket	c
.	c

LUCCA	c
CALZARI	c

He	c
was	c
one	c
of	c
my	c
best	c
friends	c
,	c
but	c
all	c
secrets	c
told	c
to	c
him	c
spreaded	i
throughout	c
the	c
school	c
in	c
a	c
matter	c
of	c
minutes	c
.	c

When	c
we	c
were	c
in	i
the	i
primary	c
school	c
,	c
my	c
teacher	c
wanted	c
to	c
surprise	c
Tom	c
(	c
a	c
school	c
mate	c
)	c
for	i
his	c
10th	c
birthday	c
by	c
preparing	i
a	c
fancy	c
dress	c
party	c
in	i
the	c
school	c
.	c

Later	c
,	c
I	c
realiced	i
it	c
was	c
the	c
worst	c
thing	c
it	i
could	c
happen	c
to	c
me	c
.	c

Both	c
Pat	c
and	c
Tim	c
were	c
very	c
disappointed	c
that	c
day	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c

It	c
is	c
great	i
to	c
hold	c
an	c
annual	c
international	c
arts	c
festival	c
in	c
the	i
place	c
.	c

I	c
enjoyed	c
it	c
very	c
much	c
.	c

Although	c
how	i
I	c
enjoyed	c
it	c
,	c
there	c
were	c
still	c
something	i
needed	i
to	c
be	c
improved	c
.	c

Thanks	c
for	c
reading	c
this	c
letter	c
,	c
I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
the	i
next	c
year	c
's	c
festival	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
lovely	c
to	c
get	c
your	c
letter	c
so	c
soon	c
.	c

You	c
mentioned	c
the	c
rules	c
at	c
home	c
and	c
at	c
school	c
in	c
the	c
letter	c
.	c

These	i
always	c
annoy	c
the	c
school	i
teacher	i
and	c
parents	i
.	c

In	i
a	c
result	c
of	c
these	i
the	i
teachers	c
make	c
very	c
strict	c
rules	c
at	c
school	c
,	c
such	c
as	c
students	c
are	c
n't	c
allowed	c
to	c
speak	c
each	i
other	c
in	c
the	i
class	c
.	c

They	c
cannot	c
oppose	i
to	i
the	c
teacher	c
,	c
girls	c
are	c
not	c
allowed	c
to	c
make	i
up	i
and	i
wear	c
any	c
accessories	i
.	c

At	c
home	c
,	c
in	c
my	c
experience	c
,	c
my	c
parents	c
did	c
n't	c
allow	c
me	c
to	c
go	c
out	c
in	c
the	c
evening	c
and	c
gave	c
me	c
much	i
amsh	i
homework	c
to	c
do	c
,	c
even	c
in	c
the	c
holiday	c
.	c

They	c
also	c
forbidden	i
me	c
to	c
make	i
a	c
boyfriend	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
not	c
just	c
what	c
happened	c
in	c
my	c
home	c
many	i
of	c
my	c
friend	i
had	c
the	c
same	c
experience	c
.	c

Now	c
I	c
'm	c
a	c
mother	c
of	c
two	c
children	c
.	c

They	c
are	c
all	i
in	c
the	i
school	c
.	c

Comparing	i
to	c
my	c
experience	c
,	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
give	c
them	c
more	i
open	c
attitude	c
about	c
everything	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
quite	c
sad	c
.	c

Best	c
wishes	c

The	c
class	c
is	c
very	c
exiting	i
about	c
that	c
because	c
the	c
Show	c
conteins	i
the	c
latest	c
Fashions	c
,	c
leisure	c
and	c
Sports	c
Wear	c
,	c
make	i
up	i
and	c
hair	i
styles	i
.	c

And	c
that	c
we	c
found	i
it	i
very	c
good	c
as	c
otherwise	c
we	c
could	c
not	c
afford	c
it	c
.	c

We	c
hope	c
we	c
do	c
not	c
cause	c
any	c
problems	c
to	i
your	c
programme	c
and	c
hope	c
that	c
you	c
will	c
except	i
our	c
request	c
.	c

From	c
all	c
your	c
class	c

Thank	c
you	c

What	c
a	c
word	c
!	c
!	c

I	c
'm	c
sure	c
that	c
the	c
people	c
that	c
had	i
decided	i
to	i
meet	i
this	i
word	i
they	i
did	c
not	c
realised	i
that	c
there	c
is	c
a	c
price	c
to	c
pay	c
.	c

I	c
believe	c
that	c
any	i
famous	c
people	c
such	i
as	c
politicians	c
and	c
film	c
stars	c
,	c
deserve	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
private	c
life	c
without	c
journalists	c
following	c
them	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
for	c
a	i
various	c
reasons	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
they	c
are	c
humans	c
like	c
everyone	c
else	c
,	c
so	c
yes	c
everyone	c
want	i
privacy	c
in	c
their	c
lifes	i
.	c

You	c
need	c
to	c
protect	c
your	c
life	c
of	i
any	c
danger	c
.	c

Becaue	i

I	c
have	i
spent	i
my	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
recently	c
and	c
it	i
is	c
like	c
a	c
tradition	c
,	c
we	c
went	c
to	c
a	c
musical	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

We	c
sometimes	c
tried	c
to	c
make	i
surprise	c
parties	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
never	c
worked	c
because	c
of	c
him	c
.	c

That	c
annoyed	c
us	c
so	c
much	c
,	i
that	c
we	c
started	c
making	c
something	c
up	c
.	c

But	c
half	c
an	c
hour	c
before	c
he	c
should	c
have	c
been	c
there	c
he	c
phoned	c
me	c
and	c
said	c
he	c
was	c
too	c
tired	c
to	c
come	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
n't	c
change	c
his	c
mind	c
although	c
I	i
've	i
tried	i
everything	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
know	c
now	c
,	i
that	c
it	c
is	c
always	c
better	c
not	c
to	c
lie	c
even	c
if	c
it	c
should	i
be	i
for	c
good	i
.	i

In	c
July	c
I	c
'll	c
be	c
on	c
my	c
vacation	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
it	c
's	c
the	c
best	c
way	c
of	c
joining	c
nature	c
and	c
fully	c
enjoying	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
also	c
used	c
to	c
join	i
the	c
school	c
choir	c
and	c
was	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
best	c
sopranos	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
'd	c
be	c
happy	c
to	c
do	c
the	c
activities	c
on	i
two	c
reasons	c
.	c

E.	c
Sidorov	c
.	c

Or	c
I	c
would	c
rather	c
say	c
he	c
or	c
she	c
might	i
be	i
or	i
might	c
happen	c
to	c
be	c
such	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
all	c
very	c
nice	c
to	c
be	c
met	c
by	c
a	c
helpful	c
assistant	c
with	c
a	c
radiant	c
smile	c
,	c
ready	c
to	c
help	c
you	c
.	c

But	c
sometimes	c
I	c
really	c
get	c
annoyed	c
at	c
his	c
or	c
her	c
,	c
persistent	c
in	c
nature	c
and	c
polite	c
in	c
structure	c
,	c
questions	c
or	c
suggestions	c
.	c

To	c
say	c
nothing	c
about	c
his	c
or	c
her	c
giving	c
advice	c
!	c

I	c
always	c
make	c
my	c
own	c
decisions	c
!	c

But	c
I	c
do	c
feel	c
ill	c
at	c
ease	c
when	c
I	c
see	c
dissappointed	i
or	c
angry	c
assistants	c
'	c
faces	c
on	c
leaving	c
the	c
magic	c
world	c
without	c

've	c
just	c
received	c
your	c
letter	c
saying	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
2	i
weeks	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
in	c
the	c
USA	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
glad	c
to	c
hear	c
that	c
and	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
all	c
the	c
informations	i
you	c
need	c
to	c
know	c
from	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
would	i
be	c
able	c
to	c
travel	c
only	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
my	c
summer	c
holiday	c
and	c
I	c
assumed	c
that	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
long	i
enough	c
time	c
to	c
fit	c
the	c
trip	c
in	c
.	c

That	i
are	c
the	c
reasons	c
why	c
I	c
cannot	c
go	c
on	c
your	c
trip	c
at	c
any	c
other	c
times	i
.	c

As	c
I	c
say	i
before	c
that	i
I	c
have	c
to	c
attend	i
tennis	i
competition	c
so	i
I	c
think	c
I	c
am	c
quite	c
good	c
at	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
started	c
playing	c
tennis	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
9	c
,	i
now	i
I	c
am	c
18	c
years	c
old	c
.	c

My	c
dad	c
influences	i
me	c
to	c
play	c
tennis	c
and	c
enjoy	i
it	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
a	c
few	c
questions	c
.	c

How	c
hot	c
is	c
it	c
in	c
California	c
in	c
July	c
?	c
so	i
I	c
know	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
need	c
.	c

What	c
kind	c
of	c
food	c
do	c
we	c
eat	c
?	c

Dear	c
Kim	c

Quess	i
what	c
I	c
've	c
done	c
!	c

I	c
will	c
tell	c
you	c
all	c
about	c
it	c
!	c

As	c
you	c
know	c
I	c
took	c
art	c
for	c
my	c
GCSE	c
and	c
fortunately	c
I	c
like	i
it	c
and	c
get	i
quite	c
good	c
marks	c
for	c
my	c
project	c
,	i
about	c
light	c
and	c
sound	c
.	c

So	c
my	c
art	c
teacher	c
came	c
to	c
me	c
and	c
my	c
best	c
friend	c
,	c
who	c
is	c
really	c
good	c
at	c
art	c
too	c
,	c
and	c
asked	c
whether	c
I	i
can	i
be	c
able	c
and	c
willing	c
to	c
help	c
for	i
the	c
concert	c
in	c
two	c
weeks	i
time	c
in	c
the	c
concert	c
hall	c
.	c

I	c
immediately	c
say	i
"	c
yes	c
"	c
and	c
also	i
my	c
friend	c
.	c

Actually	c
I	i
've	i
just	c
done	c
light	c
and	c
sound	c
in	i
drama	i
's	i
day	c
in	i
my	c
school	c
at	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
last	c
term	c
.	c

But	c
this	c
time	c
it	i
'll	i
be	c
different	c
,	c
I	c
thought	c
.	c

Do	c
you	c
know	c
that	c
this	c
concert	c
will	c
be	c
on	c
television	c
.	i

The	i
first	c
day	c
we	c
started	c
to	c
work	c
for	c
this	c
concert	c
,	c
the	c
real	c
professionals	c
came	c
.	c

Then	c
we	c
started	c
to	c
talk	c
about	c
what	c
we	c
have	i
to	c
do	c
for	c
this	c
concert	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
learnt	c
lots	c
of	c
things	c
about	c
preparing	c
stage	i
,	c
light	i
,	c
sound	c
,	i
background	c
.	c

All	c
of	c
them	c
were	c
very	c
nice	c
and	c
friendly	c
.	c

Another	c
exciting	c
part	c
was	c
,	i
I	c
had	c
to	c
climb	c
to	c
put	c
the	c
lights	c
up	c
.	c

Can	c
you	c
imagine	c
the	c
real	c
concert	c
,	c
and	c
how	c
high	c
the	c
lights	c
always	c
like	i
?	c

At	i
the	i
end	i
of	i
the	i
day	i
,	c
my	c
ambition	c
is	c
to	c
be	c
like	c
one	c
of	c
the	i
professionals	c
.	c

Do	c
you	c
know	c
,	c
my	c
ambition	c
make	i
me	c
to	i
try	i
to	c
work	c
very	c
hard	c
and	c
this	c
term	c
I	c
get	i
A	c
for	c
my	c
art	c
and	c
design	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
the	c
concert	c
has	c
changed	c
me	c
so	c
much	c
,	i
now	i
I	c
have	c
my	c
aim	c
about	i
what	c
I	c
should	c
do	c
in	c
my	c
life	c
.	c

I	c
feel	c
like	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
work	c
harder	c
.	c

Lots	c
of	c
love	c

However	c
,	c
there	c
is	c
something	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
.	c

Everyone	c
in	c
the	c
class	c
wishes	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
London	c
fashion	c
and	c
leisure	c
show	c
which	c
will	c
be	c
held	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
14th	c
March	c
from	c
10	c
a.m.	c
to	c
7	c
p.m.	c
In	i
the	c
show	c
,	c
we	c
will	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
latest	c
fashion	i
,	i
leisure	i
and	i
sports	i
wear	i
,	c
make	i
up	i
and	c
hairstyles	c
.	c

The	i
entrance	i
fee	i
is	c
free	c
for	c
students	c
so	c
the	c
show	c
is	c
well	c
worth	c
seeing	c
.	c

The	c
show	c
is	c
on	c
14th	c
and	c
takes	i
a	c
whole	c
day	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
if	c
we	c
could	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
Museum	c
by	c
using	c
the	c
free	c
time	c
on	c
15th	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
okay	c
although	c
we	c
could	c
not	c
go	c
shopping	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
horrible	c
day	c
,	c
the	c
day	c
I	c
had	i
left	i
my	c
key	c
at	c
home	c
!	c

What	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
do	c
was	c
getting	i
into	c
the	c
house	c
by	c
climbing	c
up	i
the	c
roof	c
because	c
I	c
knew	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
windows	c
was	c
unlocked	c
.	c

I	c
managed	c
to	c
do	c
that	c
although	c
I	c
cut	c
my	c
knee	c
!	c

I	c
walked	c
on	c
the	c
roof	c
carefully	c
,	c
not	i
to	c
slip	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
extremely	c
happy	c
when	c
I	c
got	c
into	c
the	c
house	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
scary	c
,	c
but	c
thrilling	c
and	c
exciting	c
incident	c
!	c

16.12.00	c

I	c
enjoyed	c
the	c
festival	c
pretty	i
much	c
.	c

However	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
it	c
could	c
be	c
better	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
rearrange	c
little	i
details	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
next	c
year	c
you	c
should	c
have	c
more	c
artists	c
from	c
different	c
countries	c
,	c
so	c
that	c
it	c
can	c
be	c
a	c
real	c
International	c
Festival	c
.	c

This	i
also	i
would	i
take	i
more	i
attraction	i
to	i
the	i
festival	i
.	c

I	c
hope	c
to	c
see	c
much	i
more	c
films	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

The	c
best	c
thing	c
about	c
the	c
festival	c
was	c
the	c
price	c
I	c
think	c
,	c
because	c
it	c
made	i
a	c
really	c
big	c
effect	c
on	c
the	c
attraction	i
,	c
that	i
of	c
course	c
made	c
the	c
festival	c
much	c
more	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

Dear	c
Andrew	c
,	c

I	c
'm	c
really	c
tired	c
of	c
the	c
rules	c
in	c
school	c
!	c

Actually	c
not	c
all	c
the	c
schools	c
in	c
Turkey	c
are	c
so	c
strict	c
but	c
unfortunatly	i
the	c
school	c
that	c
I	c
'm	c
going	c
is	i
like	c
a	c
military	c
camp	c
.	c

The	c
uniform	c
,	i
we	c
are	i
wearing	i
has	c
to	c
be	c
perfect	c
.	c

The	c
general	c
rules	c
which	c
are	c
used	c
in	c
all	c
schools	c
are	c
n't	c
so	c
strict	c
however	i
there	c
are	c
a	c
few	c
things	c
that	c
need	c
to	c
be	c
changed	c
.	c

My	c
family	c
allows	c
me	c
almost	c
every	i
thing	i
except	c
smoking	c
and	c
drinking	c
alchol	i
of	c
course	c
,	c
which	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
do	c
anyway	c
.	c

They	c
hate	c
it	c
when	c
I	c
listen	i
to	i
music	c
loudly	c
.	c

This	c
is	c
all	c
that	c
I	c
can	c
tell	c
you	c
about	c
my	c
school	c
and	c
family	c
.	c

Your	c
Best	i
Pen	i
friend	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
which	c
I	c
have	c
received	c
it	i
this	c
morning	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
Camp	c
California	c
in	c
the	c
U.S.A	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
I	c
still	c
have	c
got	c
an	c
examination	c
in	c
my	c
college	c
until	c
June	c
,	c
20th	c
.	c

And	c
also	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
the	c
log	c
cabins	c
to	c
the	c
tents	c
otherwise	i
I	c
have	c
never	c
slept	c
in	c
the	i
sleepin	i
bag	c
before	c
.	c

I	c
imagine	c
I	c
could'n	i
sleep	c
at	c
all	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
receiving	c
your	c
reply	c
soon	c
.	c

13th	c

How	c
are	c
you	c
?	c

The	c
pop	c
singer	c
called	i
Hikaru	c
Utada	c
,	c
she	c
is	c
only	c
seventeen	c
years	c
old	c
but	c
she	c
is	c
the	c
most	c
popular	c
singer	c
now	c
in	c
Japan	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
n't	c
see	c
'	c
Hikaru	c
'	c
but	c
I	c
still	c
could	c
hear	c
her	c
songs	c
.	c

13	c
June	c
2000	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
glad	c
I	c
won	c
the	c
Competition	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
Camp	c
California	c
.	c

Log	i
cabines	i
will	i
be	c
ideal	i
accomodation	i
,	i
presumably	i
they	c
are	c
more	c
spacious	c
than	c
tent	i
and	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
easier	c
to	c
keep	c
tidy	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
do	i
people	c
ussually	i
take	c
and	c
how	c
many	i
clothes	i
.	c

13	c
July	c

If	c
you	c
ever	c
know	c
of	c
a	c
concert	c
that	c
needs	c
volunteers	c
tell	c
me	c
,	c
I	c
'm	c
in	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

Indeed	c
,	c
I	c
recently	c
spent	c
a	c
week	c
's	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
and	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
to	c
see	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
.	c

Additionally	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
instead	c
of	c
19:30	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
pay	c
the	c
full	c
price	c
for	c
my	c
ticket	c
as	c
no	c
discount	c
was	c
available	c
.	c

Therefore	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
for	i
refunding	i
me	c
my	c
entrance	c
fee	c
,	c
as	c
this	c
evening	c
did	c
not	c
correspond	c
to	c
your	c
advertisement	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

To	c
take	c
my	c
personal	c
example	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
be	i
no	i
more	i
able	c
to	c
live	c
without	c
some	c
of	c
the	c
most	c
recent	c
discoveries	c
,	c
which	c
make	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
easier	c
.	c

This	c
latter	i
is	c
a	c
new	c
media	i
which	c
has	c
changed	c
my	c
life	c
,	c
as	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
marvellous	c
tool	c
to	i
communicate	i
,	c
learn	i
or	c
have	i
fun	c
.	c

Another	c
important	c
change	c
related	c
to	c
the	i
modern	c
technology	c
are	c
the	i
credit	c
cards	c
.	c

Until	c
I	c
have	i
had	i
one	c
,	c
I	c
was	i
often	c
run	c
out	c
of	c
cash	c
and	c
had	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
bank	c
.	c

At	c
the	c
present	c
time	c
,	c
thanks	c
to	c
my	c
credit	c
card	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
really	c
buy	c
what	c
I	c
want	c
,	c
when	c
I	c
want	c
and	c
where	c
I	c
want	c
!	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
many	c
other	c
discoveries	c
in	i
relation	i
with	i
the	i
modern	c
technology	c
which	c
affect	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c

Secondly	c

I	c
would	c

accomodationed	i
in	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c

you	c
if	c
I	c

,	c
or	c
everything	i

Yours	c

Sorry	c

not	c
writing	c
you	i
before	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
so	c
busy	c

because	c
last	c
weak	i
I	c
went	c
to	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
to	c
help	c
the	c
singers	c
.	c

What	c
I	c
really	c
liked	c
doing	c
was	c
to	i
helped	i
them	c
with	c
their	c
clothes	c
and	c
to	i
make-up	c
them	i
,	c
because	c
I	c
learnt	c
how	c
to	c
make-up	i
a	i
person	i
and	c
I	c
spend	i
a	c
few	c
minutes	c
with	c
the	c
most	c
popular	c
grup	i
of	i
the	c
world	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
,	c

Firstly	c
,	c
concerning	c
actors	i
,	c
in	c
your	c
advertisement	c
you	c
stated	c
that	c
DANNY	c
BROOK	c
AND	c
TINA	c
TRUELOVE	c
would	c
perform	c
in	c
the	c
musical	c
,	c
but	c
in	c
fact	c
different	c
actors	c
performed	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
really	c
angry	c
!	c

It	c
was	c
not	c
perfect	i
evening	c
for	c
me	c
and	c
my	c
child	c
at	c
all	c
!	c

I	c
'm	c
fine	c
.	c

Having	c
talked	c
with	c
you	c
a	c
couple	c
of	c
weeks	c
ago	c
,	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
some	c
information	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
sure	c
you	c
'll	c
be	c
pleased	c

You	c
are	c
supposed	c
to	c
listen	c
to	c
them	c

As	c
well	c
as	c
this	c

the	c
stories	c
are	c
going	c

It	c
's	c
good	i
chance	c
for	c
you	c

You	c

It	c
will	c
be	c
fantastic	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c

happy	c
to	c
receive	c
my	c

am	c
looking	c

Dear	c
Mrs.	c
Ryan	c
,	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
,	i
for	c
giving	c
me	c
the	c
chance	c
to	c
visit	c
Camp	c
California	c
.	c

The	c
best	c
season	c
for	c
holidays	c
.	c

About	i
the	c
accomodation	i
,	c
I	c
would	c
be	c
pleased	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
,	c
because	c
this	c
reminds	c
me	c
the	i
holidays	c
with	c
my	c
family	c
.	c

I	c
joined	c
my	c
choir	c
,	i
when	c
I	c
was	c
eight	c
years	c
old	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
sung	c
solo	c
in	c
two	c
concerts	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
be	c
grateful	c
to	i
tell	i
me	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
will	c
need	c
with	c
me	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	i
,	c

I	c
thought	c
that	c
you	c
did	c
n't	c
like	c
pop	c
music	c
and	c
things	i
have	i
to	i
deal	i
with	i
that	i
.	c

It	c
was	c
fantastic	c
.	c

That	c
's	c
the	c
advantage	c
of	c
being	c
a	c
volunteer	c
.	c

You	c
get	i
good	c
experiences	c
which	c
you	c
'll	c
never	c
forget	c
!	c

Dear	c
Manager	c
,	c

I	c
had	c
a	c
very	c
disapointing	i
evening	c
because	c
of	c
many	c
things	c
.	c

Well	c
they	c
did	c
n't	c
accepted	i
when	i
I	i
pay	i
with	i
my	c
£	c
20	c
discount	c
tiket	i
why	c
?	c

And	c
at	i
last	i
I	c
could	c
n't	c
visit	c
the	c
theater	i
restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
,	i
why	i
?	c

It	c
was	c
alwais	i
the	c
saim	i
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
,	c
because	c
after	c
I	c
told	c
her	c
that	c
I	c
have	i
a	c
new	c
girlfriend	c
,	c
all	c
the	c
school	c
knows	i
it	c
in	c
lees	i
than	c
2	c
hours	c
.	c

I	c
have	i
to	c
explain	c
to	c
every	i
body	i
that	c
,	i
I	c
formaly	i
dond't	i
have	c
a	c
girlfriend	c
,	i
I	c
explein	i
them	i
that	c
it	i
's	i
was	c
a	c
good	c
posibility	i
,	c
nothing	c
els	i
,	c
but	c
noone	i
belive	i
me	c
,	c
because	c
Pat	c
has	i
told	c
them	c
that	c
I	c
have	i
a	i
formal	i
girlfriend	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
really	c
happy	c
to	c
know	c
that	c
I	c
won	c
in	i
your	c
competition	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
is	i
the	c
best	c
period	i
to	c
take	c
a	c
break	c
from	c
my	c
work	c
.	c

For	i
the	c
accomodation	i
,	c
if	c
is	i
possible	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
camping	i
because	c
I	c
think	c
is	i
a	c
relaxing	c
place	c
where	i
to	c
stay	c
.	c

The	c
other	c
sport	c
that	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
do	c
is	c
swimming	c
.	c

How	c
much	c
money	c
I	i
need	c
to	i
do	i
this	c
travel	i
?	c

And	c
if	c
during	c
the	c
nights	c
there	c
are	c
entrotenements	i
?	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

For	c
me	c
,	c
the	i
best	i
moments	i
for	i
the	i
shopping	i
are	i
two	i
opposite	i
situations	i
.	c

For	i
the	i
first	i
situation	i
happen	i
to	i
me	i
,	i
when	c
I	c
'm	c
hungry	i
with	c
somebody	c
really	c
close	c
to	c
me	c
like	c
my	c
boyfriend	c
or	c
a	c
component	i
of	c
my	c
family	c
,	c
so	c
for	i
relaxing	i
my	i
mind	i
I	c
go	c
to	i
shopping	c
and	c
usually	c
I	c
enjoy	c
a	i
lot	c
.	c

I	i
,	i
actually	i
,	i
was	c
n't	c
disappointed	c
.	c

However	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
give	c
my	c
opinion	c
about	c
the	c
festival	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
such	c
a	c
good	i
success	c
that	c
some	c
people	c
were	c
n't	c
able	c
to	c
have	i
tickets	c
!	c

Therefore	i
,	c
you	c
could	c
invite	c
artists	c
from	c
around	c
the	c
world	c
not	i
only	c
from	c
six	c
countries	c
:	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
more	c
pleasant	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
wondering	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
improve	c
that	c
?	c

Besides	i
,	c
to	c
pay	i
one	c
reasonably-priced	c
weekend	c
ticket	c
for	c
all	c
events	c
is	c
excellent	c
because	c
we	c
could	c
see	c
all	c
that	c
we	c
wanted	c
without	c
paying	c
each	c
time	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
seeing	i
the	c
next	c
festival	c
!	c

Dear	c
Laurel	c
,	c

Firstly	c
,	c
when	c
you	c
arrive	c
late	c
at	i
your	c
lesson	c
,	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
apologize	c
you	i
to	c
your	c
teacher	c
.	c

What	c
's	c
more	c
,	c
you	c
had	c
better	c
have	i
done	i
them	i
if	i
you	c
would	i
have	i
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
blackboard	c
!	c

Although	c
our	c
library	c
is	c
very	c
large	c
,	c
we	c
must	c
n't	c
make	c
noise	i
in	c
order	c
not	c
to	c
disturb	c
the	c
students	c
,	i
who	c
work	i
.	c

I	c
consider	c
the	c
school	c
rules	c
are	c
good	c
:	c
we	c
should	c
respect	c
the	c
teachers	c
and	c
people	c
who	c
need	c
to	c
work	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
sometimes	c
allowed	c
to	c
watch	c
the	c
television	c
when	c
I	c
have	c
finished	c
my	c
homeworks	i
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
really	c
want	c
to	c
change	c
that	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
just	i
like	c
this	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
receiving	c
your	c
next	c
letter	c
!	c

Last	c
week	c
,	c
I	c
had	i
visited	i
your	c
theatre	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
disappointed	c
because	c
I	c
did	c
not	c
have	c
a	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
like	c
what	i
advertisement	i
said	c
.	c

Fist	i
thing	c
,	c
the	c
actor	c
is	c
very	i
horrible	c
so	c
I	c
recommend	c
you	c
to	i
change	i
the	c
actor	c
because	c
he	c
will	c
make	i
an	i
audience	i
who	i
visit	i
you	i
theatre	i
disappoint	i
.	c

After	c
the	c
show	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
hungry	c
so	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
restaurant	c
in	c
the	c
theatre	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
for	c
decorating	i
that	c
make	i
me	c
very	c
angry	c
and	c
disappoint	i
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

(	c
Chan	c
Suntavee	c
)	c

Nowadays	c
,	c
science	c
and	c
technology	c
are	c
very	c
important	c
to	c
our	c
life	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
young	c
,	c
I	c
used	c
to	c
walk	c
to	c
school	c
everyday	i
but	c
now	c
my	c
father	c
has	c
a	c
car	c
so	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
to	c
walk	c
anymore	c
,	c
because	c
my	c
father	c
gives	c
me	c
a	c
lift	c
everyday	i
.	c

Therefore	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
will	c
change	c
to	i
bad	c
ways	c
or	c
goods	c
ways	c
,	i
it	i
depends	c
on	c
how	c
I	c
use	c
the	c
technology	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
glad	c
about	c
three	i
days	i
trip	c
to	c
London	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
seen	c
your	c
organasation	i
for	c
the	c
trip	c
.	c

Me	i
and	i
my	i
class	i
friends	i
have	c
seen	c
ad	i
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
and	c
we	c
really	c
want	c
to	c
see	c
that	c
.	c

Your	c
afternoon	c
plan	c
is	c
shopping	i
but	c
we	c
can	c
do	c
our	c
shopping	c
on	c
Wednesday	c
afternoon	c
because	c
we	c
will	c
have	c
got	i
free	i
time	c
on	c
Wednesday	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
in	c
Central	i
Exhibition	c
Hall	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
free	c
to	i
students	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
great	i
opportunity	c
for	c
us	c
because	c
when	c
we	c
go	c
there	c
we	c
will	c
be	i
aware	i
of	i
about	c
latest	i
fashions	c
news	c
,	c
we	c
will	c
see	c
leisure	c
and	c
sports	c
wear	c
,	c
all	c
new	i
make	i
up	i
designers	c
(	c
especially	i
for	i
girls	i
)	c
and	c
different	c
hairstyles	c
.	c

Your	c
student	c

I	c
guess	c
there	c
will	c
be	c
more	c
gadget	i
to	c
do	i
some	i
housework	c
easier	c
.	c

Maybe	c
there	c
will	c
be	c
some	c
robots	c
to	c
do	c
our	c
ironings	i
,	c
washing	i
our	c
dishes	c
,	c
cleaning	i
everywhere	c
,	c
hoovering	i
,	c
etc.	c
Will	c
it	c
make	c
life	c
easier	c
?	c

We	c
can	c
get	c
everything	c
we	c
want	c
to	c
know	c
from	c
computers	c
.	c

We	c
'll	c
be	c
stuck	c
to	c
our	c
computers	c
at	c
home	c
.	c

Whatever	c
we	c
need	c
we	c
order	c
from	i
to	i
computer	i
and	c
someone	c
will	c
bring	c
.	i

It	c
means	c
we	c
'll	c
lose	c
our	c
social	c
lifes	i
.	c

They	c
should	c
seek	c
to	i
other	i
lifes	i
outside	c
their	c
homes	c
.	c

Our	c
homes	c
should	c
just	c
protect	c
us	c
dangeres	i
from	c
outside	c
.	c

Probably	i
our	i
homes	i
will	i
be	c
smaller	c
than	c
now	c
.	c

Because	c
human	i
population	c
is	c
growing	c
quickly	c
and	c
people	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
big	i
cities	c
(	c
like	c
London	c
,	c
New	c
York	c
,	c
Paris	c
)	c
.	c

Then	c
there	i
will	c
have	i
been	i
built	i
smaller	c
houses	c
,	c
flats	c
,	c
buildings	c
,	c
etc.	c
Outside	c
big	c
cities	c
there	c
wo	c
n't	c
be	c
any	c
people	c
at	c
all	c
.	c

We	c
'll	c
travel	c
around	c
to	i
space	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
just	c
an	c
imagination	i
.	c

Like	c
everything	c
our	c
homes	c
will	c
change	c
as	c
well	c
.	c

Dear	c

Dear	c
Kim	c

You	c
would	c
n't	c
believe	c
it	c
!	c

I	c
was	c
working	c
helping	c
to	c
mantle	i
and	c
dismantle	c
the	c
stage	c
,	i
sometimes	i
I	c
had	c
to	c
check	c
the	c
sound	c
by	c
saying	c
something	c
on	i
the	c
microphone	c
,	i
that	i
was	c
my	c
chance	c
and	c
I	c
always	c
pretended	c
to	c
be	c
a	c
singer	c
and	c
that	c
I	c
sand	i
in	c
duo	i
with	c
the	c
vocalist	c

week	c

in	c

USA	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
as	c
I	c
feel	c
that	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
more	c
exciting	c
than	c
staying	c
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
been	c
learning	c
swimming	i
for	c
the	c

Gorham	c
Drive	c

As	c
for	c
the	c
ticket	c
price	c
,	c
you	c
promised	c
to	c
provide	c
discount	c
tickets	c
,	c
but	c
they	c
were	c
not	c
available	c
.	c

Because	c
its	c
opening	c
time	c
was	c
from	c
10:00	c
to	c
17:00	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
not	c
need	c
to	c
tell	c
,	i
either	c
,	c
that	c
I	c
had	c
awful	i
evening	c
and	c
you	c
are	c
responsible	c
for	c
that	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
am	c
asking	c
to	i
refund	c
all	c
the	c
money	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

But	c
,	c
while	c
those	i
have	i
been	i
spread	i
all	c
over	c
the	c
world	c
,	c
I	c
and	c
all	c
the	c
other	c
people	c
who	c
I	c
have	c
known	c
became	i
to	c
use	c
them	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
to	c
these	c
,	i
I	c
can	c
contact	c
to	i
anyone	c
who	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
talk	c
at	i
any	c
convenient	c
time	c
in	c
case	c
I	c
need	c
him	c
or	c
her	c
,	c
or	c
I	c
am	c
needed	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
now	c
I	c
would	c
rather	c
send	c
the	i
e-mail	c
than	c
the	i
letter	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
prefer	c
to	c
surf	c
the	c
Internet	c
when	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
find	c
something	c
.	c

It	c
would	c
be	c
great	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
U.S.A	c
as	c
the	c
prize	c
and	c
to	c
stay	c
for	c
two	c
weeks	c
.	c

Also	c
if	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
choose	c
two	c
of	c
the	c
activities	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
play	c
tennis	c
and	c
to	c
go	c
surfing	c
because	c
playing	c
tennis	c
is	c
my	c
first	c
choice	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
it	c
.	c

So	c
you	c
would	i
spend	c
more	c
money	c
you	i
have	i
expected	c
.	c

Dear	c
Edouard	c
,	c

In	c
response	c
to	c
your	c
question	c
and	c
if	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
mind	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
I	c
've	c
already	c
chosen	i
my	c
holiday	c
and	c
my	c
boss	c
wo	c
n't	c
give	c
me	c
another	c
one	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
be	c
grateful	c
if	c
I	c
could	c
accommodate	i
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
no	i
more	i
a	i
young	i
girl	i
!	i
and	c
do	c
appreciate	c
a	c
little	c
bit	c
of	c
comfort	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
asked	c
me	c
,	c
my	c
favourite	c
activities	c
would	c
be	c
painting	c
and	c
climbing	c
.	c

I	c
like	c
very	i
much	i
the	i
moutains	i
and	c
would	c
particularly	c
enjoy	c
painting	c
them	c
after	c
a	c
walk	c
.	c

Would	c
you	c
be	c
so	c
kind	c
as	c
to	c
write	c
me	i
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c
because	c
I	c
need	c
the	c
accurate	i
date	c
of	c
the	c
journey	c
.	c

When	c
you	c
're	c
shopping	c
,	c
you	c
can	c
finally	c
relax	c
,	c
just	c
admiring	c
what	c
you	i
're	i
seeing	i
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
organising	c
the	c
programme	c
of	c
our	c
three	i
days	i
visit	c
to	c
London	c
.	c

We	c
have	c
seen	c
an	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
"	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
"	c
and	c
we	c
would	c
all	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

We	c
would	c
suggest	c
to	i
replace	i
the	c
shopping	c
part	i
on	c
Tuesday	c
afternoon	c
by	i
the	c
visit	c
of	i
the	c
show	c
.	c

We	c
are	c
sure	c
this	c
is	c
suitable	c
to	i
all	c
of	c
us	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

As	c
I	c
told	c
you	c
in	c
my	c
previous	c
letter	c
I	c
finally	c
had	c
the	c
opportunity	c
to	c
take	c
part	c
on	i
the	c
Sting	c
concert	c
here	c
in	c
Segovia	c
.	c

Not	c
yet	c
.	c

My	c
only	c
role	c
was	c
to	c
carry	c
things	c
from	c
one	c
place	c
to	c
another	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
the	c
one	c
who	c
put	c
it	c
there	c
in	c
Segovia	c
.	c

Any	i
way	i
,	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
great	c
experience	c
and	c
I	c
enjoy	i
it	c
very	c
much	c
.	c

The	c
part	c
I	c
enjoyed	c
most	c
was	c
the	c
one	c
when	c
they	c
paid	c
me	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
n't	c
much	c
but	c
that	c
means	c
nothing	c
when	c
you	c
have	c
the	c
chance	c
to	c
take	c
part	c
in	c
an	c
event	c
like	c
that	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
very	c
happy	c
that	c
I	c
won	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competion	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
answer	c
.	c

The	c
only	c
one	i
term	i
for	c
me	c
to	c
visit	c
you	c
is	c
July	c
.	c

We	c
are	c
building	c
a	c
new	c
house	c
for	c
our	c
family	c
.	c

What	c
about	c
accommodation	c
,	i
I	c
prefer	c
tents	c
to	c
log	c
cabins	c
.	c

on	i
July	c
are	c
hot	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
a	c
life	c
guard	c
and	c
I	c
could	c
work	c
in	c
your	c
camp	c
as	c
a	c
rescuer	c
next	c
summer	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
qustions	i
to	i

Yours	c
sincerely	c
K	c

Nowadays	c
we	c
have	c
capitalism	c
,	c
free	c
market	c
lots	i
of	c
privete	i
shops	c
,	c
markets	c
and	c
super-markets	i
.	c

We	c
can	c
buy	c
everything	c
what	i
about	i
we	c
imagine	c
.	c

On	c
Friedy	i
evening	c
and	c
at	i
on	c
the	c
weekdays	c
each	i
supermarkets	c
are	c
crowded	c

This	c
is	c
the	c
reason	c
why	c

2000	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Mam	i
,	c

Last	c
weak	i
,	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
London	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
musical	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
.	c

In	c
other	c
words	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
disaster	c
.	c

Maybe	c
you	c
could	c
explain	c
to	c
me	c
,	i
what	c
the	c
problems	c
were	c
.	c

But	c
these	c
are	c
only	c
little	c
problems	c
.	c

Some	c
people	c
might	c
be	c
silly	c
enough	c
to	c
pay	c
for	c
such	c
a	c
bad	c
show	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

How	c
has	c
modern	c
technology	c
changed	c
your	c
daily	c
life	c
?	c

Today	c
,	c
everyone	c
has	c
the	c
opertunity	i
to	c
just	c
get	c
into	c
a	c
car	c
and	c
drive	c
to	i
where	i
ever	i
they	c
want	c
to	c
.	c

Every	i
thing	i
is	c
controlled	c
and	c
produced	c
by	c
machines	c
.	c

This	c
also	i
is	i
a	c
very	c
big	c
disatvantage	i
because	c
many	c
people	c
are	c
losing	c
thier	i
jobs	c
.	c

The	c
only	c
and	c
simple	c
advantage	c
of	c
modern	c
technology	c
is	c
just	c
taking	c
the	c
work	c
from	c
us	c
so	c
we	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
to	c
do	c
anything	c
anymore	c
.	c

While	c
I	c
was	c
staying	c
in	c
London	c
,	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
see	c
one	c
of	c
your	c
musical	c
shows	c
,	c
"	c
Over	c
The	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
had	c
read	c
the	c
add	i
on	i
the	c
newspaper	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
thought	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
an	c
interesting	c
experience	c
.	c

Let	c
me	c
tell	c
you	c
now	c
how	c
everything	c
really	c
was	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
for	c
these	c
reasons	c
that	c
I	c
expect	c
a	c
full	c
refund	c
of	c
the	c
ticket	c
prize	i
,	i
it	i
is	c
my	c
right	c
as	c
a	c
paying	c
customer	c
to	c
get	c
what	c
I	c
have	c
paid	c
for	c
.	c

We	c
can	c
hardly	c
imagine	c
life	c
without	c
compures	i
,	c
T.V.	i
sets	c
,	c
microwaves	c
,	c
and	c
so	c
many	c
other	c
things	c
,	c
and	c
yet	c
,	i
none	c
of	c
these	c
things	c
existed	c
seventy	c
years	c
ago	c
.	c

Internet	i
,	c
I	c
think	c
,	c
is	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
inventions	c
in	c
the	c
history	c
of	c
humanity	c
.	c

But	c
technology	c
is	c
becoming	c
more	c
and	c
more	c
complicated	c
,	c
and	c
new	c
things	c
are	c
invented	c
every	c
day	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
our	c
life	i
will	c
be	c
completely	c
different	c
in	c
forty	c
years	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Ryan	c
,	c

For	c
one	c
night	c
it	c
would	c
not	c
disturb	i
me	c
to	c
sleep	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
,	c
but	c
for	c
a	c
period	c
of	c
two	c
weeks	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
too	c
uncomfortable	c
.	c

At	c
the	c
Camp	i
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
sailing	c
a	c
lot	c
.	c

Because	c
most	i
of	i
the	i
work	i
did	i
my	i
parents	i
,	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
exactly	c
how	c
to	c
handle	c
a	c
sailing	c
boat	c
.	c

I	i
'm	i
used	i
to	i
be	i
the	c
photographer	c
at	i
the	i
holidays	i
with	i
my	i
family	i
and	c
I	c
know	c
how	c
a	c
camera	c
works	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
want	c
to	c
buy	c
new	c
clothes	c
for	c
summer	c
the	c
biggest	c
difficulty	c
is	c
to	c
find	c
a	c
shop	c
,	i
which	c
sells	c
what	c
you	c
are	c
looking	c
for	c
.	c

After	c
trying	c
on	c
about	c
twenty	c
different	c
tops	c
,	c
dresses	c
or	c
jeans	c
your	c
legs	c
and	c
your	c
back	c
start	c
to	c
hurt	c
terribly	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
the	c
actor	c
was	c
not	c
Danny	c
Brook	c

you	c
wrote	c

According	c
to	c
the	c
advertisement	c
,	c
the	i
discounts	c
were	i
available	c

In	c
fact	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
pay	c
the	c
full	c
price	c
which	i
costed	i
me	c
£	c
15	c
.	c

As	i
I	i
have	i
informed	i
you	i
all	i
the	i
fact	i
,	c
I	c
think	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
not	c
worth	c
the	c
money	c
I	c
paid	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
want	c
the	i
refund	c
for	i
£	c
15	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

The	c
story	c
begins	c
when	c
Jan	c
,	c
who	c
was	c
Pat	c
's	c
best	c
friend	c
,	c
told	c
Pat	c
that	c
she	c
saw	c
Tim	c
when	c
he	c
was	c
cheating	c
the	i
exam	c
.	c

Tim	c
,	c
who	c
was	c
the	c
most	c
powerful	c
bully	c
,	c
was	c
punished	c
by	c
his	c
parents	c
and	c
of	c
course	c
by	c
the	c
teachers	c
.	c

He	c
was	c
furious	c
with	c
Jan	c
,	c
so	c
what	c
happened	c
was	c
Jan	c
was	c
bullied	c
but	c
not	c
because	c
of	c
her	c
fault	i
,	i
it	i
was	c
Pat	c
's	c
.	c

Actually	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
was	c
right	c
to	c
tell	c
the	c
teachers	c
but	c
not	c
in	c
Pat	c
's	c
way	c
.	c

Her	c
parents	c
have	c
been	c
so	c
upset	c
that	c
they	c
have	c
asked	c
the	c
school	c
to	c
help	c
thier	i
child	c
and	c
that	c
is	c
the	c
reason	c
why	c
I	c
'm	c
writing	c
this	c
story	c
.	c

Miss	i
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

So	c
I	c
will	c
answer	c
you	i
about	i
this	i
different	i
points	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
only	c
July	i
because	c
I	c
think	c
,	i
it	c
's	c
the	c
best	c
month	c
for	c
enjoy	i
my	c
holidays	c
.	c

Between	i
your	c
different	c
activities	c
,	c
I	c
will	i
like	c
to	c
practice	i
:	c

Surfing	c
because	c
I	c
never	c
do	c
it	c
and	c
I	c
will	i
like	c
to	c
learn	c
it	i
.	c

Can	c
I	c
change	c
some	c
moneys	i
in	i
the	c
Camp	i
or	c
near	c
it	c
?	c

Is	c
it	c
possible	c
to	c
come	c
with	c
another	c
person	c
?	c

And	c
know	i
the	i
different	c
prices	c
for	c
the	c
same	c
holidays	i
?	c

But	c
,	i
it	c
's	c
not	c
easy	c
for	c
workers	c
,	c
because	c
the	c
shops	c
close	c
their	c
doors	c
about	c
5.30	c
pm	c
(	c
half	c
past	c
five	c
)	c
.	c

So	c
you	c
just	i
can	i
go	c
to	i
do	i
a	i
shopping	c
during	c
your	c
lunch	c
break	c
.	c

You	c
ca	c
n't	c
walk	c
,	c
try	i
clothes	c
,	i
it	i
's	c
very	c
hot	c
.	c

The	c
salewomen	i
are	c
too	c
busy	c
and	c
have	c
n't	c
a	c
moment	c
for	i
give	i
you	i
a	i
counsil	i
service	i
.	c

It	c
will	c
be	i
a	c
good	c
service	c
for	c
their	c
costumer	i
and	c
more	i
cool	i
for	c
them	c
.	c

Dear	c
Ms.	c
Ryan	c
,	c

One	c
of	c
them	c
is	c
basketball	c
,	c
which	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
playing	c
for	c
over	c
seven	c
years	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
the	c
captain	c
of	c
my	c
university	c
basketball	c
team	c
.	c

The	c
other	c
one	c
is	c
tennis	c
,	c
which	c
is	c
also	c
my	c
favorite	i
sports	i
and	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
playing	c
for	c
several	c
years	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
therefore	c
writing	c
to	c
enquire	c
about	c
some	c
things	c
.	c

What	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
is	c
what	c
the	c
weather	c
is	c
like	c
so	c
that	c
I	c
can	c
bring	c
appropriate	c
clothes	c
and	c
also	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
should	c
bring	c
.	c

This	c
report	c
is	c
based	c
on	c
a	c
sample	c
of	c
over	c
80	c
students	c
of	c
my	c
school	c
.	c

Interestingly	c
,	c
over	c
half	c
of	c
the	c
students	c
who	c
were	c
asked	c
enjoy	c
attending	c
history	c
class	c
,	c
while	c
30	c
per	c
cent	c
are	c
keen	c
to	c
take	c
an	c
art	c
and	c
music	c
class	c
,	c
and	c
a	c
small	c
number	c
of	c
the	c
student	c
(	c
less	c
than	c
15	c
per	c
cent	c
)	c
like	c
to	c
take	c
social	c
studies	c
class	c
.	c

Amazingly	c
,	c
over	c
20	c
per	c
cent	c
of	c
the	c
students	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
take	c
up	c
handball	c
from	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr.	c
Robertson	c
,	c

I	c
would	c
also	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
the	c
good	i
programme	c
you	c
made	i
for	c
us	c
,	c
especially	i
the	c
river	c
trip	c
to	c
Greenwich	c
might	c
be	c
fascinating	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
about	c
the	c
show	c
which	c
we	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
see	c
:	c
It	c
is	c
"	c
The	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
"	c
,	c
which	c
is	c
going	c
to	c
take	c
place	c
at	c
the	c
"	i
Central	c
Exibition	i
Hall	c
in	c
London	c
,	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
the	c
14th	c
March	c
,	c
between	c
10.00	c
and	c
19.00	c
.	c

We	c
suggest	c
to	i
go	i
to	c
the	c
show	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
afternoon	c
instead	c
of	c
going	c
shopping	c
(	c
thing	i
that	c
we	c
can	c
do	c
on	c
Wednesday	c
afternoon	c
,	c
in	c
our	c
free	c
time	c
)	c
.	c

yours	c
sincerely	c

I	i
was	c
dangerous	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
knew	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
.	c

We	c
had	c
walked	c
for	c
three	c
hours	c
(	c
my	c
mother	c
,	c
my	c
two	c
brother	i
and	c
I	c
)	c
through	c
the	c
humid	c
and	c
noisy	c
jungle	c
,	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
reach	i
a	c
small	c
but	c
clean	c
house	c
where	c
a	c
nice	c
and	c
friendly	c
family	c
,	c
old	c
friends	c
of	c
us	i
,	c
used	c
to	c
live	c
.	c

There	c
were	i
nor	i
bridge	i
nor	c
a	c
canoe	c
,	i
the	i
only	c
way	c
to	c
cross	c
it	c
was	c
walking	i
on	c
an	i
old	i
big	i
trunk	i
which	c
was	c
lying	c
down	c
,	c
peacefully	c
,	c
making	c
the	c
only	c
connection	i
between	c
our	c
side	c
and	c
the	c
other	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
easier	c
than	c
I	c
had	c
thought	c
!	c
.	i

That	c
day	c
,	c
I	c
learnt	c
that	c
I	c
can	c
do	i
even	i
things	c
which	c
,	c
at	c
first	c
sight	c
,	c
seem	c
impossible	c
to	c
be	i
done	i
.	c

Dear	c
Ms	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
inform	i
you	c
the	c
information	c
you	c
asked	c
me	c
.	i

Since	c
I	c
have	c
studied	c
photography	c
for	c
several	c
years	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
take	c
some	c
picture	i
of	c
beautiful	c
scenaries	i
in	c
California	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

Although	c
shopping	c
is	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
most	c
popular	c
ways	c
to	c
reduce	c
your	c
stress	c
,	c
this	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
the	c
case	c
.	c

There	c
are	c
some	c
negative	c
points	c
that	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
make	c
about	c
shopping	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
if	c
you	c
want	c
to	c
buy	c
nice	c
dresses	c
,	c
the	c
first	c
thing	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
do	c
is	c
looking	i
around	c
all	c
shops	i
and	c
department	c
stores	c
in	c
a	c
city	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
are	c
lucky	c
enough	c
,	c
you	c
might	c
find	c
them	c
within	c
30	c
minutes	c
,	c
but	c
if	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
,	c
you	c
might	c
have	c
to	c
keep	c
walking	c
for	c
several	c
hours	c
and	c
still	c
could	i
n't	i
find	c
ones	i
!	c
!	c

After	c
that	c
what	c
is	c
waiting	c
for	c
you	c
is	c
the	c
struggle	c
with	c
ill-fitted	i
clothes	c
taking	i
off	c
and	c
putting	c
on	c
.	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
although	c
there	c
is	c
certainly	c
a	c
good	c
side	c
of	i
shopping	c
,	c
such	c
as	c
pleasures	i
of	c
getting	c
new	c
stuff	c
and	c
spending	c
money	c
on	c
something	c
you	c
really	c
wanted	c
for	c
long	i
time	c
,	c
you	c
also	c
have	c
some	c
unpleasant	c
moments	c
to	c
get	c
through	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
.	c

Other	c
worker	i
are	c
taking	i
on	i
other	c
month	i
so	c
there	c
is	c
only	c
July	c
that	c
is	c
availible	i
for	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
a	c
very	c
out	i
door	i
person	c
,	c
who	c
like	i
to	c
go	c
camping	c
and	c
hiking	c
,	c
so	c
staying	i
in	i
a	c
tents	i
is	c
like	c
a	c
second	c
home	c
to	c
me	c
.	c

Unforgivly	i
,	c
my	c
climbing	c
skill	c
is	c
no	i
where	i
like	c
my	c
tennis	c
skill	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
alway	i
love	c
climbing	c
.	c

Also	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
how	c
long	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
staying	c
at	c
this	c
camp	c
so	c
I	c
can	c
prepare	i
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
'm	c
going	c
to	c
need	c
and	c
how	c
many	c
clothes	c
I	c
'm	c
going	c
to	c
take	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
again	c
for	c
the	c
prize	c
that	c
you	c
give	i
me	c
.	c

(	c
I	c
'm	c
one	c
of	c
them	c
)	c
.	c

It	c
a	i
good	c
idea	c
to	c
have	c
that	c
in	c
.	c

There	c
are	c
lot	i
of	c
interest	i
activities	c
doing	c
on	i
such	c
as	c
,	i
painting	c
,	c
swimming	c
,	c
football	c
,	c
basketball	c
,	c
reading	c
,	c
drama	c
,	c
and	c
much	c
much	c
more	c
.	c

We	c
can	c
capture	c
bits	c
of	c
each	c
activities	i
and	c
used	i
it	i
as	c
a	i
finish	i
clips	i
for	c
our	c
film	c
.	c

I	c
went	c
in	c
for	c
your	c
competition	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
really	c
anxious	c
about	c
the	c
results	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
surprised	c
that	c
I	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
but	c
also	c
very	c
happy	c
about	c
it	c
!	c

Secondly	c
,	c
you	c
are	i
mentioning	i
"	c
tents	c
or	c
log	c
cabins	c
"	c
as	c
the	c
accommodation	c
provided	c
.	c

I	i
could	i
feel	i
the	i
environment	i
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
which	i
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
do	i
I	c
have	i
to	i
bring	i
with	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
also	c
wondering	c
if	c
I	c
will	c
need	c
any	c
money	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
appreciate	c
if	i
you	c
could	c
let	c
me	c
know	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
tried	c
to	c
be	c
as	c
helpful	c
as	c
possible	c
.	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

I	c
know	c
how	c
impatient	c
you	c
are	c
about	i
it	c
and	c
I	c
just	c
want	c
to	c
let	c
you	c
know	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
something	i
amazing	c
!	c

As	c
I	c
've	c
told	c
you	c
,	c
last	c
month	c
I	c
went	c
at	i
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
and	c
I	c
really	c
enjoy	i
helping	c
with	c
the	c
preparation	c
.	c

We	c
had	c
to	c
be	c
very	c
careful	c
.	c

Have	c
you	c
any	c
idea	c
how	c
much	c
does	i
this	c
stuff	c
worth	i
?	c

You	c
do	c
n't	c
even	c
want	c
to	c
know	c
.	c

Apart	c
from	c
these	i
we	i
were	c
mainly	c
helping	c
the	c
singers	c
to	c
be	i
prepared	i
for	c
the	c
concert	c
.	c

I	c
've	c
learned	c
the	c
meaning	c
of	c
the	c
words	c
"	c
reliability	c
"	c
and	c
"	c
responsibility	c
"	c
.	c

Looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

There	c
was	c
no	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
but	c
instead	c
of	c
him	c
was	i
a	c
different	c
actor	c
and	c
I	c
'm	c
very	c
dissapointed	i
about	c
it	i
because	c
I	c
'm	c
his	i
fan	i
.	c

The	c
show	c
started	c
much	c
later	c
,	c
on	i
45	c
minutes	c
later	c
than	c
it	c
should	c
be	i
so	c
I	c
was	c
late	c
for	c
the	c
bus	c
.	c

Yours	c
Faithfully	c

Vaisili	c
Solatov	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

I	c
saw	c
her	c
as	c
a	c
perfect	c
girl	c
with	c
who	i
I	c
fallen	i
in	c
love	c
with	i
.	c

I	c
had	c
decided	c
to	c
go	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
woke	c
up	c
at	c
2	c
o'clock	c
in	c
the	c
morning	c
and	c
climed	i
out	c
of	c
the	c
window	c
.	c

Next	c
day	c
my	c
best	c
friend	c
went	c
to	c
headmaster	i
and	c
told	c
him	c
about	c
me	c
so	c
he	c
gave	i
me	c
a	i
sespend	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
your	i
advertisement	c
about	i
the	c
"	c
London	c
Fashion	c
"	c
and	c
"	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
"	c
.	c

But	c
there	c
is	c
a	c
problem	c
which	c
I	c
hope	c
you	c
can	c
solve	c
.	c

The	c
point	c
is	c
,	c
The	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
show	c
will	c
be	c
fantastic	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
sure	c
we	c
will	c
enjoy	c
ourselves	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
we	c
had	i
better	i
go	i
to	c
show	i
instead	c
of	c
science	i
museum	c
and	c
shopping	i
,	i
also	i
we	c
can	c
go	c
to	c
Science	i
Museum	c
on	c
15th	c
March	c
,	c
which	i
instead	c
of	c
the	i
free	c
time	c
in	c
the	c
afternoon	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
sorry	c
to	c
make	i
your	i
inconveint	i
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
receiving	c
your	c
apply	i
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
dangerous	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
knew	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
.	c

My	c
mother	c
came	c
over	c
to	c
me	c
and	c
said	c
softly	c
,	c
;	i
my	i
dear	c
,	c
your	c
father	c
's	c
company	c
has	c
jut	i
gone	c
bankrupt	c
'	c
,	c
then	c
she	c
could	c
n't	c
help	c
crying	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
hear	i
this	c
bad	c
news	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
depressed	c
because	c
father	c
worked	c
quite	c
hard	c
for	c
his	c
company	c
.	c

One	c
day	c
,	c
I	c
suddenly	c
got	i
a	c
good	c
idea	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
with	i
mixed	c
mood	i
went	i
home	c
I	c
found	c
my	c
parents	c
were	c
stooding	i
at	c
the	c
door	c
looked	i
like	i
very	c
cheerful	c
.	c

I	c
said	c
to	c
myself	c
again	i
.	c

Much	c
to	c
my	c
surprise	c
,	c
they	c
told	c
me	c
in	c
high	c
voice	i
that	c
they	c
never	c
went	c
bankrupt	c
,	i
they	i
wanted	c
to	c
give	c
me	c
a	i
opportunity	c
to	c
do	c
something	c
impressive	c
by	c
myself	c
.	c

Now	c
,	c
they	c
are	c
both	c
prouding	i
of	c
me	c
!	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
on	i
our	i
class	i
behalf	i
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
organising	c
our	c
tour	i
in	i
London	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
the	c
students	c
in	c
our	c
class	c
have	c
seen	c
an	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
at	c
the	c
Central	c
Exhibition	c
Hall	c
of	c
London	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
from	c
10	c
am	c
to	c
7	c
p.m.	c
All	c
of	c
us	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
because	i
of	i
the	c
following	c
reasons	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
there	c
will	c
be	c
leisur	i
and	c
sports	c
wear	c
and	c
the	c
latest	c
fasions	i
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
the	i
entrance	c
for	c
students	c
is	c
free	c
.	c

We	c
suggest	c
changing	c
our	c
programme	c
a	c
little	c
bit	c
.	c

For	c
the	i
further	c
details	c
you	c
can	c
contact	c
me	c
my	i
phone	c
number	i
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

What	c
does	c
it	c
means	c
?	c

From	i
my	i
point	i
of	i
view	i
,	c
these	c
are	c
the	c
people	c
,	i
who	c
stay	c
all	i
time	i
in	i
our	i
sigh	i
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
each	c
human	c
being	c
has	c
rights	i
to	c
be	c
free	c
.	c

Why	c
everybody	i
must	i
know	c
and	c
tolk	i
about	c
their	c
private	c
life	c
?	c

The	c
most	c
important	c
thing	c
that	i
the	i
famous	c
people	c
are	c
also	c
normal	c
people	c
as	i
us	c
.	c

They	c
live	c
as	i
us	c
,	c
they	c
brief	i
and	c
eat	c
as	i
us	c
,	c
they	c
even	c
following	i
in	c
love	c
as	i
us	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
although	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
,	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
closed	c
at	c
the	c
usual	c
time	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
not	c
able	c
to	c
eat	c
dinner	c
.	c

Faithfully	c
yours	c
,	c

It	c
was	c
just	c
an	c
usual	i
day	c
.	c

I	c
did	c
n't	c
mind	c
telling	c
her	c
about	c
my	c
cousin	c
,	i
actually	i
he	c
is	c
n't	c
different	c
from	c
other	c
boys	c
at	c
all	c
,	i
he	i
just	i
has	i
sweet-looking	c
.	c

Next	i
day	c
,	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
school	c
as	c
usual	c
and	c
got	i
agog	c
at	c
a	i
large	c
number	c
of	c
girls	c
waiting	c
for	c
me	c
around	c
my	c
rocker	i
.	c

They	c
all	c
seemed	c
to	c
want	c
to	c
be	c
my	c
best	c
friend	c
,	c
and	c
only	c
Pat	c
seemed	c
to	c
be	c
happy	c
to	c
be	c
my	c
best	c
friend	c
.	c

Now	c
I	c
'm	c
asking	c
my	c
cousin	c
either	c
to	c
meet	c
my	c
friends	c
,	c
or	c
to	c
quit	c
being	c
a	c
singer	c
right	c
now	c
.	c

In	c
your	c
advertisement	c
I	c
read	c
the	c
times	c
,	i
it	i
was	i
14.30	c
and	c
10.30	c
,	c
however	c
it	i
started	c
20.15	i
!	c

So	c
I	i
've	i
been	i
doing	c
the	i
nothing	c
for	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
and	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
like	c
to	c
lose	i
my	c
time	c
,	c
and	c
what	c
about	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
?	c
,	i
where	i
were	c
they	c
the	i
last	c
weekend	c
?	c
the	i
last	i
weekend	c
in	i
the	c
theatre	c
was	i
a	c
different	c
actor	c
who	c
was	c
disappointing	c
.	c

To	c
make	c
the	c
evening	c
worse	c
the	i
tickets	i
were	i
not	i
discounts	i
available	i
,	c
and	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
so	c
late	c
when	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
over	c
.	c

I	c
want	c
the	i
money	c
back	c
,	i
if	i
you	c
do	c
n't	c
give	c
it	c
to	i
me	i
back	i
,	c
I	c
will	i
intend	c
to	c
write	c
to	c
the	c
press	c
and	c
explain	i
everything	c
,	c
and	c
of	c
course	c
I	c
wo	c
n't	c
be	c
the	c
only	c
one	c
.	c

Poor	c
Pat	c
,	c
he	c
was	c
so	c
happy	c
because	c
a	c
girl	c
loves	i
him	c
and	c
so	c
nervous	c
at	c
the	c
same	c
time	c
,	c
even	c
eating	i
his	c
nails	c
.	c

We	c
laughed	c
and	c
explained	c
him	i
that	c
we	c
were	c
who	i
wrote	c
that	i
letters	c
,	c
and	c
made	c
him	c
promises	i
that	c
when	c
he	c
gets	c
a	c
secret	c
lover	c
,	c
a	c
real	c
one	c
,	c
do	i
n't	i
tell	c
anyone	c
because	c
he	i
wo	c
n't	c
meet	c
her	c
.	c

How	c
could	c
you	c
change	c
the	c
actors	c
without	c
saying	c
something	c
to	c
the	c
visitors	i
.	c

The	c
show	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
start	c
at	c
half	c
past	c
seven	c
and	c
started	c
a	i
quarter	c
past	c
eight	c
.	c

It	c
mention	i
that	c
visitors	c
could	c
visit	c
the	c
restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
too	c
,	c
and	c
we	c
could	c
not	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
,	c
and	c
the	c
person	c
who	c
was	c
there	c
said	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
very	c
late	c
and	c
he	c
was	c
not	c
allowed	c
to	c
open	c
the	c
restaurant	c
for	c
us	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
that	c
the	c
next	c
time	c
you	c
will	c
do	i
a	c
better	c
show	c
than	c
the	c
last	c
one	c
.	c

For	i
me	i
technology	i
affects	c
me	c
a	c
lot	c
may	i
be	i
more	c
than	c
science	c
,	c
because	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
is	c
plenty	i
of	c
objects	c
with	i
technology	c
,	c
such	c
us	c
television	c
,	c
radio	c
,	c
transports	i
,	c
etc	c
.	c

But	c
it	c
has	c
advantatges	i
as	c
disadvantatges	i
.	c

On	c
the	c
positive	c
side	c
,	c
if	c
I	c
am	c
bored	c
,	c
the	c
first	c
thing	c
that	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
do	c
is	c
watching	i
television	c
or	c
listening	i
to	c
music	c
.	c

Or	i
if	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
go	c
shopping	c
or	c
to	c
another	c
city	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
necessary	c
to	c
use	c
the	c
car	c
or	c
the	i
public	c
transport	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
the	c
enviroment	i
is	c
polluted	c
because	c
of	c
technology	c
,	c
although	c
is	i
our	c
fault	c
.	c

Secondly	c
for	c
us	c
is	i
a	i
disadvantatge	i
because	c
the	i
pollution	c
affects	c
us	c
indirectly	c
,	c
and	c
because	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
do	c
anything	c
but	c
watching	i
television	c
,	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
all	c
.	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
technology	c
it	i
's	i
the	c
best	c
thing	c
around	i
the	c
world	c
,	c
apart	c
from	c
T.V	c

Danny	c

as	c
was	c
presented	i
in	c
an	c

in	c
July	c
because	c
I	c
will	c
have	c
my	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
more	c
comfortable	c
than	c
a	c
tent	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
about	c
the	i
money	c

Do	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
bring	c
money	c
for	c
anything	c

also	c
I	c

Who	c
does	c
n't	c
like	c
shopping	c
?	c

Everybody	c
likes	c
from	i
a	c
child	c
to	c
an	c
old	c
lady	c
in	c
sixties	i
but	i
it	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

You	c
can	c
order	c
everything	c
on	c

I	c
have	c
just	c
received	c
your	c

I	c
would	c

you	c
about	i
the	c
two	c
weeks	c

California	c
I	c
won	i
in	c
the	c
competition	c

California	c
has	c

I	c
have	c
always	c
wanted	c
to	c
spend	c
my	c

in	c

but	c
my	c
father	c
has	c
never	c
given	c
me	c
the	i
permission	c

would	c
be	c
an	c
ideal	c
opportunity	c
for	c
me	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
reading	i
from	c
you	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

I	c
do	c
not	c
agree	c
that	c
it	c
is	c
preferable	c
to	c
phone	c
at	i
the	c
shop	c
and	c
give	c
them	c
a	c
list	c
of	c
items	c
you	c
need	c
instead	c
of	c
going	c
to	c
the	c
shop	c
and	c
choose	i
whatever	c
you	c
want	c
.	c

Besides	i
I	c
've	c
chosen	c
two	c
activities	c
from	c
the	c
list	c
:	c
Tennis	i
as	i
I	c
practice	i
this	c
sport	c
regularly	c
and	c
I	c
'm	c
very	c
good	c
in	i
this	c
activity	c
and	i
Golf	i
because	c
I	c
ignore	i
all	i
about	c
this	c
sport	c
and	c
I	c
wish	c
I	i
will	i
discover	i
it	c
thanks	i
to	i
you	i
.	c

I	c
hope	c
quickly	i
hearing	i
from	i
you	i

As	c
you	c
have	i
already	i
know	i
,	c
your	c
English	c
class	c
is	c
going	c
to	c
make	c
a	c
short	c
video	c
about	c
daily	c
life	c
at	c
your	c
school	c
,	i
that	i
's	i
why	c
I	c
'm	c
writing	c
a	c
report	c
suggesting	c
which	c
,	i
lessons	c
and	c
other	c
activities	c
,	i
should	c
be	c
filmed	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
he	i
seems	c
obvious	c
that	c
we	c
should	c
,	c
at	c
least	c
once	c
,	c
film	c
a	c
lesson	c
with	c
our	c
English	c
teacher	c
who	c
have	i
had	i
the	c
idea	c
to	c
make	c
this	c
short	c
video	c
.	c

At	c
the	c
end	c
,	c
to	i
my	i
opinion	i
,	c
It	i
would	c
be	c
interesting	c
to	c
film	c
a	c
course	i
of	i
sport	i
in	c
order	c
that	c
our	c
parents	c
realise	c
that	c

but	c
you	c
are	c
not	c
interesting	i
of	i
that	c
,	i
romatic	i
,	c
no	c
!	c

I	c
think	c
you	c
will	c
feel	c
boring	i
.	c

If	c
you	c
go	c
out	c
with	c
your	c
same	i
sex	i
friend	c
that	c
should	c
be	c
fine	c
,	i
same	i
fashion	i
,	i
but	c
everytime	i
go	i
to	c
the	c
same	c
place	c
,	c
everyone	c
will	c
feel	c
boring	i
.	c

Then	c
,	c
the	c
time	c
marked	i
to	i
the	c
beginning	c
was	i
19:30	c
and	c
unfortunatly	i
he	i
began	c
at	c
20:15	c
.	c

Closing	i
this	i
facts	i
,	c
when	c
the	c
musical	c
finished	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
,	i
in	i
the	i
fact	i
of	i
the	i
wainting	i
for	c
the	c
start	c
of	c
the	c
musical	c
and	c
dissapointed	i
with	c
this	c
version	c
of	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
,	i
every	i
body	i
went	c
to	c
the	c
restaurant	c
wich	i
is	i
closed	c
without	c
any	c
explanation	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
dissapointed	i
with	c
this	c
evening	c
and	c
with	c
the	i
desorganized	i
way	c
of	c
deal	i
with	c
problems	c
so	c
I	c
am	c
asking	c
my	i
money	c
back	c
.	c

They	c
always	c
done	i
thing	i
together	c
,	c
and	c
they	c
were	c
the	c
most	c
popular	c
boys	c
in	c
school	c
,	i
both	i
were	c
very	c
hanson	i
,	c
played	c
football	c
they	i
were	c
the	i
example	c
for	c
everybody	c
.	c

Before	i
one	i
day	c
,	i
when	c
Pat	c
discovered	c
that	c
his	c
brother	c
was	c
gay	c
,	i
after	i
this	i
their	c
relationship	c
has	i
change	i
.	c

This	c
secret	c
was	c
an	c
opportunity	c
for	c
Pat	c
be	i
the	c
best	c
without	c
competition	i
but	c
it	c
is	i
a	c
secret	c
who	i
involved	c
his	c
best	c
friend	i
sexuality	c
,	c
and	c
if	c
Ted	c
was	i
a	c
normal	c
person	c
it	c
will	i
be	i
fine	c
but	c
he	c
was	c
the	i
example	c
for	c
all	c
school	i
.	c

Unable	c
to	c
keep	c
a	c
secret	c
he	c
told	c
for	i
everyone	c
,	c
ended	c
his	c
friendship	c
with	c
Ted	c
,	i
now	i
Ted	c
is	c
rejective	i
for	i
everyone	c
,	c
no	c
one	c
talks	c
to	c
him	c
and	c
Pat	c
is	c
the	c
example	c
,	c
but	c
without	c
his	c
best	c
friend	c
and	c
his	c
honestity	i
.	c

I	c
prefer	i
be	i
nothing	c
than	c
bun	i
like	c
Pat	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
pleased	c
with	c
the	c
prize	c
that	c
I	c
won	i
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
more	c
information	c
about	c
it	i
,	c
because	c
I	c
would	c
really	c
really	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
California	c
,	i
I	c
have	c
always	c
wanted	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
California	c
.	c

You	c
have	c
also	c
asked	c
me	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
two	c
activities	c
(	c
sports	c
)	c
which	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
do	c
while	c
I	c
am	c
at	c
the	c
camp	c
.	c

The	c
kind	c
of	c
activities	c
that	c
I	c
like	c
from	c
the	c
list	c
that	c
you	c
gave	c
me	c
are	c
Basketball	c
and	c
Swimming	c
.	c

May	c
I	c
ask	c
you	c
to	c
bring	i
me	c
some	c
more	c
information	c
about	c
the	c
question	i
that	c
I	c
have	c
asked	c
you	c
?	i

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Andersen	c

Well	c
,	c
in	i
my	i
point	i
of	i
view	i
the	c
most	c
interesting	c
lessons	c
that	c
we	c
do	i
at	c
school	c
but	i
in	i
real	i
life	i
are	i
useful	i
,	i
are	c
maths	c
because	c
everything	c
we	c
do	c
is	c
all	c
about	c
maths	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
geography	c
is	c
important	c
as	c
well	c
because	c
we	c
must	i
all	c
know	c
WHERE	c
we	c
live	c
,	c
what	c
are	i
the	i
problems	i
that	c
we	c
have	c
in	c
this	c
world	c
,	c
what	c
problem	c
does	i
every	c
different	c
country	c
have	i
and	c
where	c
does	i
the	c
petroleum	c
come	i
from	c
and	c
what	c
are	i
the	i
advantages	i
and	i
disadvantages	i
for	i
it	i
and	c
the	i
gold	c
as	c
well	c
,	i
there	i
are	c
loads	c
of	c
thinks	i
about	c
geography	c
that	c
we	c
MUST	i
KNOW	i
.	c

You	c
can	c
put	c
a	i
few	c
activities	c
(	c
sports	c
)	c
like	c
basketball	c
,	c
football	c
,	c
tennis	i
,	c
but	c
only	c
those	c
because	c
their	i
are	c
very	c
popular	c
and	c
people	c
will	c
have	i
interest	i
on	i
them	c
.	c

Dear	c
manager	c
,	c

There	c
are	i
some	c
problems	c
,	i
we	c
have	c
to	c
speak	c
about	c
.	c

At	i
first	i
,	c
the	c
actor	c
was	c
not	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
there	i
was	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
,	c
who	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
advertisement	c
of	i
the	c
show	c
was	i
written	c
that	c
the	c
musical	c
will	i
be	i
start	c
at	c
19:30	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
.	c

I	i
've	i
payed	i
£	c
160	c
for	c
eight	c
people	c
and	c
there	c
was	i
no	c
discounts	c
available	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
oppinion	i
you	c
have	c
to	c
give	c
some	c
money	c
back	c
to	c
me	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
give	i
no	i
money	c
back	c
,	c
I	c
will	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
newspaper	c
.	c

faithfully	c

With	c
the	c
help	c
of	c
some	c
modern	c
technology	c
our	c
daily	c
life	i
would	c
not	c
so	i
difficult	c
.	c

An	i
other	i
point	i
is	c
the	c
modern	c
technology	c
in	c
my	c
car	c
.	c

At	i
the	i
end	i
I	c
would	c
say	c
that	c
everybody	i
of	c
us	c
can	c
not	i
live	c
without	c
the	i
modern	c
technology	c
,	c
because	c
the	i
modern	c
technology	c
is	c
necessary	i
for	c
us	c
in	c
all	c
parts	c
of	c
our	c
life	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
glad	c
to	c
hear	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
.	c

Here	c
are	i
some	c
further	c
information	c
you	c
need	c
from	c
me	c
:	c

It	c
is	c
the	c
only	c
time	c
of	c
the	c
year	c
I	c
have	c
two	c
weeks	i
holiday	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
be	c
grateful	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
give	c
me	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
.	c

It	c
should	c
not	c
be	c
a	c
problem	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
played	c
tennis	c
in	c
my	c
life	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
watch	c
every	c
tournament	c
on	c
television	c

Charline	c
Cholmondeley	c

There	c
are	c
two	c
kinds	c
of	c
shopping	c
;	c
the	c
first	c
one	c
is	c
shopping	c
for	c
fun	c
.	c

This	i
is	c
very	c
nice	c
when	c
you	c
can	c
do	c
your	c
shopping	c
like	c
that	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
when	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
buy	c
what	c
is	c
necessary	c
for	c
you	c
:	c
bread	c
,	c
butter	c
,	c
milk	c
etc	c
...	c

After	c
that	c
,	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
carry	c
your	c
bag	c
(	c
of	c
course	c
far	c
too	c
heavy	c
for	c
you	c
)	c
to	c
your	c
car	c
.	c

Shopping	c
is	c
annoying	c
but	c
also	c
necessary	c
,	i
it	i
is	c
why	c
it	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
disappointed	c
.	c

About	c
the	c
discount	c
that	c
we	c
are	i
going	c
to	c
have	c
.	c

Why	c
it	i
does	i
not	i
make	i
to	i
us	i
?	c

as	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

Everyone	i
after	i
the	i
show	i
run	i
to	c
take	i
a	c
good	c
seat	c
at	i
the	c
restaurant	c
but	c
everyone	c
disappointed	i
when	c
they	c
see	i
the	c
sight	i
which	c
said	c
"	c
Close	i
for	c
today	c
"	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	i

Pat	c
is	c
a	c
friend	c
of	c
mine	c
and	c
we	c
are	i
friends	c
for	c
almost	c
a	c
year	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
Saturday	c
when	c
I	c
called	c
her	c
and	c
told	i
her	c
to	c
go	c
for	c
a	c
walk	c
at	i
the	c
park	c
,	c
which	c
was	c
not	c
very	c
far	c
away	c
from	c
our	c
houses	c
.	c

Pat	c
told	c
me	c
that	c
she	c
would	c
not	c
told	i
that	c
to	c
anyone	c
but	c
the	c
other	c
day	c
I	c
learnt	c
that	c
all	c
the	c
school	c
had	i
known	i
about	c
Maria	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
sure	c
that	c
was	i
Pat	c
who	c
told	c
it	i
to	i
everyone	c
.	c

On	i
June	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
some	c
English	c
lessons	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
live	i
in	c
log	c
cabins	c
because	c
I	c
think	c
they	c
are	c
more	c
comfortable	c
than	c
tents	c
.	c

I	c
love	c
to	c
play	c
basketball	c
.	c

Before	i
I	c
was	c
in	c
a	c
basketball	c
team	c
and	c
I	c
enjoyded	i
a	i
lot	c

Also	c
I	c
like	c
singing	c

In	c

and	c

We	c
have	c
very	c
interesting	c
English	c
lessons	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
not	c
true	c
.	c

Many	c
people	c
do	c
n't	c
like	c
Math	i
because	c
they	c
think	c
that	c
it	c
's	c
boreing	i

Our	c
Math	i

what	i
appeared	c
to	c
be	c
wrong	c
to	i

I	c
had	c
a	c
really	c
bad	c
evening	c
and	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
for	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

Pierre	c
Gaussier	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
modern	c
technology	c
has	c
changed	c
my	c
life	c
a	c
lot	c
.	c

First	c
off	i
all	c
,	c
if	c
computers	c
hade	i
n't	i
been	c
invented	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
n't	c
spend	c
half	c
of	c
the	c
day	c
in	c
front	c
of	c
it	i
!	c

Precision	c
industry	c
has	c
changed	c
my	c
life	c
a	c
lot	c
too	c
.	c

I	c
received	c
your	c
letter	c
this	c
morning	c
.	c

You	i
can	i
find	i
futher	i
information	i
from	i
me	i
about	i
Camp	i
California	i
in	i
the	i
USA	i
.	c

My	c
second	c
chose	i
is	c
painting	c
because	c
I	c
love	c
water	i
colour	i
painting	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
member	c
of	c
the	c
our	i
water	i
colour	i
painting	c
club	c
in	c
my	c
town	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
log	i
cabins	i
because	c
I	c
have	i
bad	c
experiens	i
about	i
tents	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
not	c
like	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
such	c
a	c
small	c
place	i
.	c

Lastly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
should	c
bring	c
with	c
me	c
and	i
could	c
you	c
give	c
me	c
clue	i
about	c
what	c
I	c
must	c
bring	c
as	i
a	i
clothes	c
and	c
what	c
I	c
do	c
not	c
need	c
it	i
.	c

Shopping	c
is	c
Not	c
Enjoy	i
Anymore	c

They	c
give	c
us	c
lots	c
of	c
chose	i
to	c
buy	c
what	c
we	c
need	c
it	i
and	c
what	c
we	c
can	c
try	i
for	i
.	c

But	c
when	c
we	c
thing	i
properly	i
shopping	i
is	c
not	c
enjoyable	c
for	i
example	c
if	i
you	c
forget	c
something	c
that	c
need	i
for	c
salat	i
.	c

You	c
have	c
to	c
go	c
back	c
this	i
supermarket	c
and	c
find	c
nearest	i
parking	c
space	c
then	i
before	c
someone	c
takes	c
the	c
their	i
last	c
fresh	c
lemon	c
for	c
your	c
salat	i
you	i
must	c
find	c
where	i
was	i
the	i
lemon	i
section	i
before	i
because	c
they	c
love	c
change	i
the	c
store	c
again	i
and	c
again	c
.	c

To	c
whom	c
it	c
may	c
concern	c
,	c

I	c
have	c
recently	c
received	c
a	c
letter	c
saying	c
I	c
am	c
a	i
first-prize	c
winner	c
for	i
your	c
competition	c
.	c

I	i
was	c
wonderful	c
news	c
and	c
as	c
you	c
have	c
requested	c
,	c
here	c
is	c
some	c
further	c
information	c
and	c
details	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
as	c
it	c
is	c
my	c
summer	c
holiday	c
and	c
is	c
the	c
most	c
convenient	c
time	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
they	c
are	c
a	c
good	c
contrast	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
not	c
done	c
sailing	c
for	c
quite	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
so	c
I	c
might	c
find	c
it	c
difficult	c
but	c
I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
never	c
done	c
Photography	c
before	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
all	c
new	c
for	c
me	c
as	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
been	c
to	c
the	c
USA	c
before	c
.	c

Yours	c
Sincerely	c
,	c

When	c
you	c
think	c
of	c
the	c
word	c
'	c
shopping	c
'	c
a	c
smile	c
always	c
comes	c
onto	c
your	c
face	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
say	c
window	c
shopping	c
is	c
the	c
reason	c
why	c
I	c
have	c
no	c
money	c
now	c
.	c

As	c
I	c
had	c
nothing	c
better	c
to	c
do	c
,	c
I	c
tried	c
it	c
on	c
.	c

I	c
fell	c
in	c
love	c
with	c
it	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
received	c
my	c
monthly	c
pay	c
,	c
I	c
rushed	c
down	c
to	c
the	c
shop	c
and	c
without	c
thinking	c
,	c
bought	c
that	c
dress	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
as	i
I	c
read	c
at	i
the	c
advertisment	i
,	i
the	i
actor	c
would	c
be	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	i
this	c
is	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
reasons	c
why	c
I	c
came	i
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
.	c

Another	c
reason	c
why	c
I	c
was	c
disappointed	c
was	c
that	c
you	c
said	c
there	c
would	c
be	c
discount	i
available	c
but	c
there	c
was	c
n't	c
.	c

At	i
last	i
I	i
was	c
waiting	i
to	c
visit	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
a	c
machine	c
was	c
broken	c
.	c

This	c
was	c
very	c
disappointing	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
can	c
see	c
there	i
were	c
many	c
problems	c
with	c
the	c
theatre	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
for	c
some	c
money	c
back	c
as	c
an	i
alternative	i

I	c
was	c
very	c
ungry	i
with	c
her	c
,	i
I	c
did	c
n't	c
know	c
what	c
to	c
do	c
I	i
was	c
afraid	c
that	c
I	c
would	i
have	i
lost	c
all	c
my	c
friends	c
.	c

After	c
a	c
few	c
seconds	c
of	c
thoughts	i
I	c
went	c
straigh	i
to	c
Pat	c
.	c

"	c
Why	c
,	c
why	c
did	c
you	c
do	c
that	c
?	c
"	c

I	c
said	i
she	i
looked	c
as	c
if	c
she	c
did	c
n't	c
want	c
to	c
talk	c
to	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
wondered	c
why	c
I	c
made	c
the	c
mistake	c
to	i
invite	i
Pat	c
.	c

I	c
guess	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
know	c
that	c
she	c
would	c
have	c
said	i
it	i
.	c

With	i
this	c
story	i
I	c
learnt	c
that	c
there	c
are	c
a	c
few	c
friends	c
who	c
are	c
real	c
friends	c
and	i
who	i
you	c
can	c
trust	c
.	c

As	c
a	c
result	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
totally	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
during	c
my	c
holiday	c
.	c

I	c
will	c
looking	i
forward	c
to	c
your	c
reply	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

It	c
is	c
certainly	c
true	c
that	c
the	i
modern	c
technology	c
has	c
been	c
changing	c
our	c
life	c
a	c
lot	c
in	i
these	c
days	c
.	c

I	c
get	c
up	c
in	c
the	c
morning	c
with	c
the	c
soft	c
sound	c
of	c
radio	i
program	i
not	i
the	c
sound	c
of	c
alarm	i
clock	c
and	c
eat	c
my	c
breakfast	c
watching	c
TV	c
news	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
write	c
a	c
letter	c
to	c
my	c
friend	c
who	c
is	c
abroad	c
in	c
such	c
a	c
short	c
time	c
.	c

After	c
comming	c
home	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
make	c
myself	c
relaxed	c
with	c
the	c
smooth	c
sound	c
of	c
classical	c
music	c
from	c
the	c
Hi-Fi	c
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
modern	c
technology	c
affects	c
a	i
lot	i
to	i
my	i
daily	i
life	i
as	c
well	c
as	c
the	c
whole	c
society	c

I	c

today	c
and	c
could	c

I	c
'd	c

in	c
July	c
and	c
this	c
is	c
the	c
only	c
time	c
I	c

because	c
I	c
am	c

with	c
a	c

until	c
the	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

As	c
you	c
asked	c
me	c
about	c
the	c
concert	c
,	c
I	c
'll	c
write	c
about	c
it	c
today	c
.	c

There	c
were	c
so	c
many	c
seats	c
that	c
it	c
took	c
long	i
to	i
finish	c
clearing	c
.	c

We	c
move	c
them	c
to	c
a	c
safe	c
place	c
so	c
that	c
they	c
wo	c
n't	c
be	c
kicked	c
or	c
stepped	c
on	c
by	c
other	c
mad	c
fans	c
.	c

Have	c
you	c
had	c
an	c
interesting	c
experience	c
?	c

Please	c
write	c
about	c
it	c
in	c
the	c
next	c
letter	c
.	c

I	c
've	c
gone	c
to	c
many	c
musical	i
shows	i
where	c
the	c
main	c
actor	c
was	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
I	c
can	c
say	c
that	c
he	c
is	c
really	c
good	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
my	c
last	c
night	c
in	c
London	c
and	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
this	c
musical	i
show	c
.	c

I	c
bought	c
the	c
ticket	c
for	c
the	c
second	c
session	i
and	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
at	c
seven	c
o'clock	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
been	c
waiting	c
half	c
an	c
hour	c
outside	c
the	c
theatre	c
and	i
finally	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
a	c
quarter	c
past	c
eight	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
angry	c
about	c
all	c
of	c
this	i
problems	c
but	c
I	c
was	c
disappointed	c
when	c
I	c
realised	c
the	c
advertisement	c
was	c
wrong	c
with	i
the	c
actor	c
's	c
name	c
.	c

We	c
have	c
been	c
using	c
personal	c
computers	c
for	c
nine	c
years	c
and	c
it	c
's	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
changes	c
.	c

The	c
subject	c
was	c
"	c
What	c
's	c
happening	c
in	c
Irak	c
?	c
"	c

I	c
started	c
my	c
research	c
in	c
the	c
town	c
's	c
library	c
and	c
all	c
the	c
information	c
I	c
collected	c
was	c
from	c
a	c
local	c
newspaper	c
.	c

After	c
two	c
hours	c
I	c
thought	c
that	c
all	c
of	c
this	c
information	c
was	c
writted	i
from	c
a	c
foreign	c
point	c
of	c
view	c
and	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
the	c
native	c
opinion	c
.	c

I	c
used	c
my	c
computer	c
for	i
collecting	i
reports	c
from	c
internet	i
and	c
I	c
can	c
promise	c
I	c
found	c
so	c
much	c
information	c
that	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
analize	i
it	c
in	c
two	c
weeks	c
.	c

Do	c
you	c
want	c
to	c
organize	c
a	c
different	c
holiday	c
in	i
a	c
strange	c
place	c
?	c

I	c
'm	c
not	c
interested	c
in	c
films	c
without	c
special	c
effects.	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
insisted	c
on	c
the	i
explanation	c
of	i
this	i
fact	i
,	c
I	c
was	c
told	c
that	c
the	c
chief	c
cook	c
was	c
on	c
holiday	c
!	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
will	c
note	i
this	i
and	c
I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

I	c
loved	c
and	c
respected	c
him	c
very	c
much	c
,	c
but	c
there	c
was	c
an	c
unpleasant	c
thing	c
about	c
him	c
-	c
he	c
talked	c
too	c
much	c
.	c

My	c
sister	c
's	c
birthday	c
was	c
coming	c
.	c

Her	c
friends	c
and	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
present	c
her	c
with	c
the	c
thing	c
she	c
had	c
been	c
dreaming	c
of	c
for	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
-	c
a	c
puppy	c
.	c

We	c
bought	c
a	c
beautiful	c
puppy	c
and	c
were	c
waiting	c
for	c
the	c
holiday	i
probably	c
even	c
more	c
impatiently	c
,	i
than	c
Susie	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
sure	c
he	c
did	c
it	c
not	c
because	c
he	c
wanted	c
to	c
spoil	c
everything	c
,	c
but	c
because	c
he	c
was	c
so	c
happy	c
and	c
excited	c
,	i
that	c
he	c
could	c
n't	c
act	c
in	c
a	c
different	c
way	c
.	c

Susie	c
liked	c
the	c
puppy	c
very	c
much	c
,	c
her	c
eyes	c
were	c
shining	c
,	c
but	c
friends	i
were	c
a	c
little	c
bit	c
sad	c
and	c
disappointed	c
,	c
because	c
they	c
were	c
expecting	c
a	c
completely	c
different	c
ending	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
been	c
very	c
disappointed	c
by	c
the	c
quality	c
of	c
the	c
show	c
and	c
the	c
lies	c
in	c
your	c
advertisement	c
.	c

So	c
when	c
he	c
heard	c
at	i
random	i
that	c
my	c
parents	c
were	c
planning	c
to	c
offer	i
me	c
a	c
trip	c
to	c
San	c
Fansisco	c
as	c
present	i
for	c
my	c
birthday	c
,	c
my	c
little	c
brother	c
ran	c
in	i
my	c
bedroom	c
wherever	i
I	c
was	c
studying	c
and	c
whispered	c
in	i
my	i
ear	i
the	i
wonderful	i
news	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
in	c
July	c
after	c
taking	c
my	c
examination	c
at	c
the	i
college	c
in	i
the	c
end	c
of	c
June	c
.	c

So	c
it	c
is	c
impossible	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
go	c
before	i
.	c

But	c
I	c
think	c
I	c
'd	c
rather	c
do	c
other	c
activities	c
what	i
you	c
show	i
me	i
in	c
your	c
letter	c
like	i
tennis	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
been	c
playing	c
this	c
game	c
with	c
my	c
friends	c
and	c
I	c
like	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
be	c
please	i
if	c
you	c
give	i
me	c
some	c
more	c
information	c
about	c
the	c
accommodation	c
,	c
and	c
some	c
advices	i
about	c
the	c
cloth	i
(	c
shal	i
)	c
I	c
should	c
wear	c
and	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
should	c
take	c
with	c
me	c
.	c

My	c
sister	c
loves	c
shopping	c
,	i
she	i
could	c
stay	c
trying	i
clothes	i
on	i
all	i
day	i
in	i
a	i
shop	i
.	c

I	c
am	i
agree	c
that	c
the	i
most	c
of	i
the	i
people	c
enjoy	c
buying	c
cloths	i
,	c
food	c
,	c
something	c
for	c
the	c
house	c
presents	i
.	i

Sometime	i
you	c
can	c
stay	c
all	i
day	i
out	i
just	c
to	c
buy	c
a	c
present	c
for	c
someone	c
,	i
it	i
stard	i
in	c
the	c
morning	c
,	c
and	c
of	c
course	c
you	c
have	c
the	i
breakfast	c
somewhere	c
,	c
and	c
it	c
get	i
later	c
and	c
you	c
still	i
looking	c
for	c
it	c
so	i
you	c
have	c
the	i
lunch	c
,	c
so	i
finaly	i
you	c
spent	i
more	c
money	c
than	c
you	c
thought	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
glad	c
.	c

I	c
can	c
tell	c
you	c
I	c
am	c
only	c
free	c
in	c
July	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
an	i
accomodation	i
in	c
log	i
cabins	i
because	c
I	c
am	c
not	c
keen	c
on	c
tents	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
is	c
more	c
comfortable	c
than	c
a	c
tent	c
.	c

Would	c
you	c
give	c
me	c
some	c
information	c
about	c
clothes	i
to	c
wear	c
there	c
?	c

I	c
would	c
like	i
also	i
to	c
know	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
can	c
bring	c
.	c

Looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c

There	c
is	c
somebody	c
who	c
says	c
that	c
'	c
Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
'	i
and	c
who	c
is	c
happy	c
only	c
when	c
can	i
go	c
shopping	c
.	c

In	i
the	i
first	i
I	c
do	c
not	c
think	c
that	c
shopping	c
is	c
enjoyable	c
when	c
you	c
must	c
do	c
so	i
in	c
a	c
hurry	c
or	c
for	i
duty	c
.	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
I	c
enjoy	c
wasting	c
money	c
and	i
buying	c
useful	c
things	c
or	c
not	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
with	c
reference	c
to	c
your	c
letter	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
give	c
some	i
information	c
which	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
asked	c

Because	c
my	c
course	c
finishes	c
at	c
the	c
end	c
of	c

I	c
am	c
going	c
to	c
work	c
for	c
a	c
Hotel	i
in	c
August	c
and	c
September	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
.	c

As	c
far	c
as	c
accommodation	c
is	c
concern	i
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
I	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
tents	c
.	c

I	c
like	c
staying	c
in	c
tents	c
because	c
when	c
we	c
go	c
on	c
holiday	c
with	c
my	c
friends	c
,	c
we	c
always	c
stay	c
in	c
tents	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
am	c
used	c
to	c
staying	c
in	c
tents	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
also	c
been	c
asked	c
to	c
choose	c
some	c
activities	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
choose	c
basketball	c
and	c
swimming	c
.	c

It	c
would	c
also	c
be	c
useful	c
to	c
know	c
that	i
how	c
much	c
money	c
will	i
be	i
enough	i
to	c
bring	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Ryan	c

I	c
have	c
no	c
particular	c

but	c
one	c
:	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
necessary	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
my	c
work	c
will	c
keep	c
me	c
very	c
busy	c
in	c
all	c
other	i
months	c
.	c

Most	c
women	c
and	c
girls	c
like	c
it	c
,	c
especially	c
when	c
they	c
want	c
to	c
buy	c
clothes	c
and	c
shoes	c

In	c
this	c
case	c

you	c
have	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c

queues	c
,	c
you	c
ca	c
n't	c
walk	c
without	c

you	c

to	i
buy	i
some	c
soap	c
or	c
a	c
packet	c
of	c
biscuits	c
.	c

Even	c
if	c
you	c
are	c
with	c
a	c
friend	c
,	c
you	c
ca	c
n't	c
talk	c
,	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
noise	c
and	c
the	c
confusion	c
,	c
and	c
you	c
may	c
find	c
it	c
difficult	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
express	c
how	c
I	i
was	i
dissatisfied	i
with	c
OVER	c
THE	c
RAINBOW	c
which	i
was	c
presented	i
by	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
.	c

Although	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
start	c
at	c
19=30	i
,	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
20=15	i
,	c
so	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
wait	c
for	c
an	c
hour	c
.	c

I	c
wonder	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
give	c
me	c
a	c
refund	c
for	i
that	i
,	c
because	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
extremely	i
different	c
which	i
I	c
was	i
expected	i
.	c

Yours	c
faithfuly	i

Our	c
daily	c
life	c
with	c
modern	c
technology	c

Last	c
week	c
I	c
attempted	i
the	c
musical	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
"	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
writting	i
in	c
order	c
to	c
complaint	i
about	c
things	c
that	c
really	c
disappointed	c
me	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
in	c
the	c
play	c
appeared	i
a	c
different	c
actor	c
despite	i
that	i
in	i
the	i
advertisement	i
appeared	i
the	i
name	i
of	i
Danny	i
Brook	i
,	i
that	c
actor	c
was	c
very	c
bad	c
.	c

During	c
this	c
time	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
keep	c
seating	i
in	c
the	c
theatre	c
and	c
it	c
was	c
boring	c
and	c
tiring	c
.	c

Thirdly	c
,	c
when	c
I	c
bought	c
the	c
tickets	c
,	c
I	c
asked	c
for	c
discounts	c
and	c
nobody	c
know	i
anything	c
about	c
them	c
,	c
so	c
it	c
is	c
false	c
there	i
are	c
discounts	c
available	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
we	c
enjoyed	c
the	c
musical	c
,	c
but	c
while	c
going	c
out	i
to	c
have	c
dinner	c
,	c
we	c
saw	c
the	c
restaurant	c
closed	i
and	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
take	i
the	c
car	c
and	c
come	c
back	c
home	c
very	c
hungry	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
waiting	c
for	c
your	c
answer	c
.	c

Hello	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
oppinion	i
,	c
in	c
a	c
hundred	c
of	i
years	c
,	i
we	c
'll	c
wear	c
the	c
same	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
that	c
we	c
wear	c
nowadays	c
.	c

What	c
will	c
change	c
in	i
clothes	c
,	i
will	c
be	c
the	i
comfortability	i
of	i
them	i
and	c
the	c
way	c
they	c
protect	c
us	c
and	c
our	c
body	i
from	c
temperature	c
and	c
physical	c
agressions	i
.	c

Wearing	c
them	c
we	c
'll	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
dive	c
underwater	c
with	i
a	i
high	c
pressure	c
,	c
and	c
we	c
'll	c
have	c
freedom	c
of	c
movement	c
.	c

Technology	c
will	c
take	i
part	i
in	c
clothes	i
development	c
,	c
scientists	c
will	c
search	i
the	i
way	c
to	c
reduce	c
the	c
weight	c
of	c
clothes	c
and	c
they	c
will	c
become	c
very	c
light	c
and	c
comfortable	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
be	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
to	c
enjoy	c
the	c
clothes	c
.	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

On	i
one	i
hand	i
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
I	c
'm	c
working	c
in	c
a	c
school	c
and	c
the	c
lessons	c
finish	c
at	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
June	c
so	c
if	c
I	c
could	c
go	i
to	i
this	c
extraordinary	c
opportunity	c
in	c
July	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
better	c
for	c
me	c
because	c
in	c
August	c
I	c
will	c
have	c
to	c
be	c
ready	c
to	c
begin	c
preparing	c
the	c
exams	c
of	i
september	i
.	c

On	i
the	i
other	i
hand	i
I	c
think	c
I	c
would	c
rather	c
not	c
sleep	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
because	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
bad	c
experience	c
once	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
try	c
log	c
cabins	c
.	c

although	i
it	c
would	c
n't	c
be	c
a	c
problem	c
if	c
I	c
finally	i
have	i
to	c
sleep	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
.	c

Another	c
point	c
is	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
already	c
chose	i
two	c
activities	c
that	i
you	i
asked	i
me	i
while	i
I	i
am	i
at	i
the	i
camp	i
and	c
are	i
basketball	c
and	c
golf	c
,	i
they	i
are	c
the	c
best	c
for	i
me	c
because	c
I	c
think	c
I	c
am	c
good	c
at	c
both	c
and	c
I	c
used	c
to	c
play	c
them	c
before	i
.	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

See	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

IT	c
IS	c
VERY	c
PLEASED	i
TO	c
KNOW	c
THAT	c
I	c
HAVE	c
A	c
CHANCE	c
TO	c
SPEND	c
TWO	c
WEEKS	c
AT	c
CAMP	c
CALIFORNIA	c
IN	c
THE	c
USA	c
,	c
WHERE	c
I	c
HAVE	c
NEVER	c
BEEN	c
BEFORE	c

ANSWERING	c
THE	c
FIRST	c
QUESTION	c
-	c
I	c
WOULD	c
LIKE	c
TO	c
TRAVEL	c
IN	c
JULY	c
.	c

I	c
JUST	c
STARTED	c
TO	c
PLAY	c
TENNIS	c
THAT	i
IS	c
WHY	c
I	c
THINK	c
IT	c
WOULD	c
BE	c
A	c
POSSIBILITY	c
TO	c
PRACTISE	c
AND	c
CHECK	c
MY	c
SKILLS	c
.	c

SHOPPING	c
IS	c
NOT	c
ALWAYS	c
ENJOYABLE	c
.	c

BUT	c
SOME	c
PEOPLE	c
DO	c
N'T	c
LIKE	c
DOING	c
SHOPPING	c
AT	c
ALL	c
.	c

THE	c
REASONS	c
ARE	c
;	c
DISTANCE	c
,	c
LACK	c
OF	c
CAR	c
,	c
CROWDED	c
STREETS	c
,	c
TRAFFIC	c
ON	c
THE	c
WAY	c
TO	c
THE	c
SHOP	c
.	c

THEY	c
ARE	c
TOO	c
LAZY	c
FOR	c
WALKING	c
AND	c
LOOKING	c
FOR	c
SOMETHING	c
NICE	c
FOR	c
BIRTHDAY	i
PRESENT	c
OR	c
FLOWERS	c
FOR	c
GIRL-FRIENDS	i
.	c

PEOPLE	c
,	i
WHO	c
DO	c
N'T	c
LIKE	c
SHOPPING	c
HAVE	c
THEIR	c
OWN	c
REASONS	c
OF	i
THIS	c
SITUATIONS	i
(	c
MAYBE	c
THEY	c
HAD	c
AN	c
ACCIDENT	c
WITH	c
A	c
RUDE	c
SHOP-ASSISTANCE	i
,	c
BOUGHT	c
NOT	c
FRESH	c
FOOD	c
ONE	c
DAY	c
AND	c
DO	c
NOT	c
WANT	c
TO	c
DO	c
THAT	c
ANY	c
MORE	c
,	c
HAD	c
BAD	i
EXPERIENCE	c
WITH	c
OTHER	c
PEOPLE	c
IN	c
SHOPS	c
)	c
.	c

BUT	c
EVERY	c
INDIVIDUAL	c
CAN	c
CHOOSE	c
THE	c
WAY	c
HOW	i
TO	c
DO	c
IT	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
I	c
'll	c
have	c
chance	i
to	c
draw	c
the	i
pictures	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
'll	c
show	c
my	i
friends	c
who	c
have	c
never	c
been	c
there	c
before	c
.	c

Another	i
activities	i
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
is	c
sailing	c
.	c

My	c
father	c
was	c
a	c
sailor	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
child	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Sometimes	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
park	c
your	c
car	c
in	c
a	c
futher	i
place	c
then	c
walk	c
to	c
the	c
supermarket	c
.	c

Futhermore	i
when	i
you	c
look	c
aroud	i
the	c
supermarket	c
,	c
you	c
ca	c
n't	c
easyly	i
find	c
the	c
goods	c
which	c
you	c
want	c
to	c
buy	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
very	c
confusing	c
without	c
right	i
singho	i
.	c

Otherwise	i
men	i
always	i
do	i
n't	i
like	i
shopping	c
,	i
while	i
their	c
wives	c
are	c
doing	c
shopping	i
they	c
sit	c
in	c
the	c
car	c
or	c
read	c
newspaper	i
.	c

I	c
will	c
give	c
you	c
the	c
information	c
which	c
you	c
asked	c
me	c
in	i
your	c
letter	c
and	c
also	c
will	i
ask	c
you	c
some	c
questions	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
rather	c
choose	c
July	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
only	i
one	i
month	c
when	c
I	c
have	c
got	c
holiday	c
,	i
long	c
enough	c
to	c
spend	c
it	c
by	i
travelling	c
abroad	c
.	c

If	c
it	c
is	c
possible	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
tent	i
.	c

Ansering	i
to	i
your	c
question	c
about	c
activities	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
going	c
to	c
choose	c
tennis	c
and	c
swimming	c
.	c

Could	c
I	c
ask	c
you	c
some	c
questions	c
about	c
clothes	c
and	c
money	c
.	i

The	c
last	c
question	c
-	c
could	c
you	c
tell	i
me	c
some	c
idea	c
about	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
could	i
I	i
need	c
.	c

Your	i
sincerely	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

Do	c
I	c
enjoy	c
it	c
?	c

Everybody	c
are	i
pushing	c
me	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
I	c
came	c
in	i
a	i
wrong	c
place	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
I	c
understand	c
very	c
well	c
that	c
it	c
is	c
really	c
nesseceraly	i
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
an	c
opportunity	c
to	c
meet	c
different	c
people	c
(	c
even	c
if	c
they	c
are	c
pushing	c
you	c
)	c
,	c
to	c
understand	c
what	c
they	c
like	c
and	c
what	c
they	c
do	c
n't	c
,	c
because	c
even	c
some	c
kind	i
of	c
food	c
could	i
be	c
in	c
fashing	i
.	c

He	c
is	c
my	c
favourite	c
actor	c
and	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
reason	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
your	c
theatre	c
.	c

Due	i
to	i
all	c
of	c
these	c
reasons	c
,	c
I	c
hope	c
you	c
could	i
give	c
my	i
money	c
back	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

MANUEL	c
ALMODAR	c

I	c
was	c
thinking	c
a	c
lot	c
about	c
this	c
problem	c
and	c
how	c
to	c
solve	c
it	c
so	c
I	c
needed	c
someone	c
to	c
talk	c
to	c
and	c
Pat	c
had	c
always	c
been	c
my	c
best	c
friend	c

Finally	c
,	c
my	c
parents	c
are	c
all	i
the	i
time	i
argueing	i
about	c
differents	i

to	c
my	c

Dear	c
Competition	c
Organiser	c
:	c

I	c
'm	c
so	c
happy	c
and	c
exciting	i
to	c
receive	c
this	c
letter	c
about	c
I	i
've	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
.	c

The	c
dream	c
happens	i
to	c
me	c
now	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
go	c
back	c
to	c
my	c
country	c
in	c
Auguest	i
.	c

Also	c
I	c
am	c
not	c
very	c
keen	c
on	c
sleeping	c
with	c
too	c
many	c
people	c
in	c
the	c
same	c
place	c
.	c

Basket	i
ball	i
is	c
my	c
favourite	c
sporting	i
.	c

And	c
I	c
was	c
school-team	c
player	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
in	c
High	c
school	c
.	c

The	c
other	c
thing	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
do	c
is	c
sailing	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
never	i
try	i
it	c
before	c
.	c

I	c
just	c
think	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
exciting	c
and	c
interesting	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

Also	c
I	c
got	i
two	c
questions	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
that	c
I	c
will	c
enjoy	c
my	c
journey	c
!	c

Yours	c
Sincerely	c

Sometimes	c
shopping	c
can	c
relax	c
people	c
and	c
increase	c
people	c
's	c
working	c
express	i
.	c

But	c
is	c
it	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
?	c

Of	c
course	c
not	c
.	c

So	c
you	c
like	c
them	c
but	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
want	c
them	c
any	c
more	c
.	c

Also	c
for	i
example	c
.	i

If	c
you	c
were	i
rich	i
man	c
it	c
does	c
n't	c
mater	c
,	c
but	c
if	c
you	c
were	i
poor	i
man	c
,	c
you	c
will	c
be	c
sad	c
!	c

How	c
can	c
shopping	c
be	c
enjoyable	c
at	i
thoese	i
situation	c
!	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
this	c
letter	c
to	c
you	c
to	c
make	c
a	c
complain	i
about	c
the	c
"	i
Over	i
the	i
rainbow	i
"	i
musical	i
show	i
which	c
I	c
saw	c
yesterday	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
I	c
'm	c
very	c
disappointed	c
with	c
what	c
I	c
saw	c
because	c
by	i
seing	i
your	c
advertisment	i
I	c
expected	c
more	c
That	i
show	c
was	c
entirely	c
different	c
to	c
what	c
it	c
says	c
on	i
the	c
advertisment	i
.	c

After	c
some	c
time	c
a	i
few	c
of	c
them	c
started	c
to	c
leave	c
the	c
theatre	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
why	c
I	c
payed	i
£	c
20	c
with	c
no	c
discounts	i
as	i
the	c
advertisements	c
said	c
it	i
woul	i
have	c
.	c

Then	c
I	c
thougt	i
that	c
I	c
should	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
drink	c
or	c
eat	c
something	c
so	c
that	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
say	c
that	c
I	c
wasted	i
my	c
time	c
by	c
coming	c
here	c
.	c

I	c
became	c
furious	c
when	c
I	c
saw	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
there	c
were	c
n't	c
any	c
employees	c
to	c
work	i
.	i

Most	c
houses	c
have	c
many	c
electric	c
devices	c
like	c
microwave	i
machine	i
,	c
an	c
oven	c
a	i
mixer	c
,	c
a	c
dish	i
washer	i
and	c
many	c
other	c
things	c
which	c
can	c
do	c
a	c
job	c
by	i
the	c
press	c
of	c
a	c
button	c
.	c

Competers	i
entirely	i
changed	i
people	i
lives	c
.	c

There	c
are	c
hundrets	i
of	c
prograns	i
which	c
help	c
you	c
communicate	c
with	c
your	c
cousin	c
in	c
Australia	c
or	c
with	c
a	c
complete	c
stranger	c
which	i
you	c
wanna	i
meet	c
.	c

The	c
general	c
conclusion	c
about	c
computers	c
is	c
that	c
they	c
help	c
people	c
to	c
have	c
easier	c
lives	c
by	c
doing	c
hard	c
work	c
and	c
helping	c
them	c
.	c

They	c
are	c
important	c
to	c
people	c
who	c
like	c
to	c
have	c
fun	c
with	c
games	c
and	c
they	c
are	c
,	i
maybe	c
the	c
best	c
way	c
to	c
communicate	c
with	c
someone	c
you	c
know	c
or	c
a	c
person	c
you	c
want	c
to	c
meet	c

During	c
this	c
time	c
,	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
drink	c
in	c
the	c
restaurant	c
but	c
,	c
as	c
well	c
as	c
being	c
closed	c
,	c
there	c
was	c
no	i
nobody	c
from	c
the	c
staff	c
that	c
could	c
help	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
n't	c
believe	c
it	c
!	c

I	c
would	c
never	c
have	c
imagined	c
this	c
could	c
happen	c
in	c
such	c
a	c
well-known	c
theatre	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
you	c
talk	c
about	c
discounts	c
in	c
your	c
leaflets	c
and	c
they	i
were	c
no	i
available	c
,	c
so	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
an	c
expensive	c
evening	c
!	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

However	c
,	c
she	c
was	c
a	c
close	c
friend	c
and	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
accuse	c
her	c
of	c
nothing	i
else	c
.	c

I	c
do	i
really	i
trusted	i
her	c
when	c
three	c
days	c
after	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
school	c
and	c
I	c
could	c
appreciate	i
I	c
was	c
catching	i
the	i
eyes	i
of	c
everybody	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
n't	c
stand	c
being	c
watched	c
and	c
my	c
furious	i
led	c
me	c
straight	c
to	c
Pat	c
.	c

Sure	c
!	c

Thanks	i
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
your	c
recent	c
letter	c
.	c

I	c
can	i
not	i
believe	c
that	c
I	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
(	c
It	i
's	i
great	c
!	c
)	c
and	c
of	i
course	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
happy	c
.	c

And	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
returned	i
to	c
my	c
university	c
by	c
August	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
please	c
could	c
you	c
give	c
me	c
an	c
idea	c
what	c
sort	c
of	c
clothes	c
to	c
bring	c

and	i
how	c
much	c
would	i

Dear	c
Helen	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
an	c
important	c
exam	c
in	c
September	c
.	c

Plus	c
,	c
it	c
may	c
be	c
lovely	c
weather	c
at	c
that	c
time	c
in	c
U.S.A	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
log	c
cabins	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
choose	c
singing	c
and	c
tennis	c
.	c

I	c
used	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
KARAOKE	c
with	c
my	c
meats	i
in	c
Japan	c
as	c
I	c
really	c
like	c
to	c
do	c
that	c
,	c
anytime	c
.	c

If	c
possible	c
,	c
could	c
you	c
please	c
let	c
me	c
know	c
information	c
about	c
the	c
way	c
of	c
getting	c
there	c
,	c
e.g.	c
airport	c
information	c
?	c
?	c

Dear	c
Kim	c

I	c
believe	c
it	c
went	c
well	c
!	c

Actually	c
I	i
helped	c
and	i
support	i
to	c
sell	c
tickets	c
at	c
the	c
reception	c
.	c

I	c
've	c
sold	c
tickets	c
before	c
but	c
not	c
in	c
that	c
kind	c
of	c
big	c
pop	c
concert	c
.	c

Before	c
it	c
was	c
packed	c
into	c
by	c
audience	i
,	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
clean	c
around	c
the	c
reception	c
,	c
but	c
totally	i
it	c
was	c
really	c
exciting	c
although	c
I	c
was	c
just	c
a	c
staff	i
in	c
the	c
small	c
reception	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
felt	c
great	c
excitement	c
(	c
especially	c
girls	c
!	c
)	c
from	c
people	c
queing	i
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
like	c
to	c
tidy	c
up	c
,	c
you	c
know	c
!	c
!	c

I	c
like	c
to	c
face	c
people	c
whom	c
even	i
I	i
do	i
n't	i
know	c
.	c

Foremost	c
,	c
after	c
finishing	c
my	c
work	c
,	c
I	c
could	c
meet	c
singers	c
by	c
chance	c
!	c
!	c

That	c
night	c
was	c
brilliant	c
and	c
class	c
!	c

Anyway	c
,	c
hope	c
to	c
hear	c
from	c
you	c
shortly	c
.	c

See	c
you	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
which	c
was	c
held	c
last	c
week	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
there	c
were	c
two	c
unknown	c
actors	c
in	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

I	c
feel	c
most	c
disappointed	c
about	c
this	c
.	c

The	c
show	c
was	i
started	i
at	c
20.15	c
but	c
actually	c
it	c
should	c
started	i
at	c
19.30	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
at	i
that	c
day	c
was	c
their	c
day-off	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
whole	c
,	c
I	c
feel	c
disappointed	c
about	c
the	c
event	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
have	i
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

I	c
say	c
this	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
experience	c
I	c
've	c
had	c
from	i
her	c
.	c

Actually	c
,	c
we	c
were	c
quite	c
good	c
friends	c
before	c
the	i
event	c
happened	c
.	c

Pat	c
has	c
been	c
studying	c
in	c
the	c
same	c
class	c
with	c
me	c
since	i
this	c
year	c
.	c

But	c
the	c
thing	c
which	c
I	i
've	i
never	c
expected	c
is	i
Pat	c
betrayed	c
me	c
.	c

She	c
told	c
everyone	c
that	c
I	c
fancy	c
him	c
and	c
everybody	c
always	c
make	i
joke	i
on	i
it	c
,	i
that	i
makes	c
me	c
feel	c
so	c
embarrised	i
:	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
angry	c
at	c
that	c
time	c
!	c

I	c
had	c
really	c
expected	i
the	c
show	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
the	c
first	c
time	c
I	c
had	c
seen	c
it	c
in	c
London	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
attracted	c
by	c
your	c
advertisement	c
which	c
looked	c
very	c
exciting	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
found	c
it	c
very	c
disappointing	c
.	c

Thirdly	c
,	c
you	c
state	c
that	c
there	c
are	c
discounts	c
available	c
but	c
I	c
could	c
not	c
get	c
any	c
reductions	c
at	c
all	c
.	c

You	c
mentioned	c
that	i
"	c
Your	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
!	c
"	c
in	c
your	c
advert	c
.	c

but	c
it	c
was	c
not	i
absolutely	i
true	c
!	c

So	c
I	c
must	c
insist	c
that	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
full	c
refund	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
receiving	c
your	c
cheque	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c
.	c

So	c
the	i
life	c
is	c
much	c
faster	c
and	c
more	c
convenient	c
than	c
before	c
.	c

I	c
used	c
to	c
write	c
letters	c
but	c
it	c
takes	c
time	c
to	c
arrive	c
there	c
or	c
sometimes	c
disappear	i
so	i
E-mail	c
is	c
brilliant	c
for	c
my	c
life	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
with	c
regard	c
to	c
the	c
letter	c
I	c
've	c
just	c
received	c
as	c
I	c
wish	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
some	c
further	c
information	c
about	c
myself	c
.	c

Regarding	c
the	c
activities	c
I	i
've	c
chosen	c
swimming	c
as	c
I	c
'm	c
very	c
keen	c
on	c
it	c
and	c
I	c
'm	c
fairly	c
good	c
at	c
it	c
,	c
but	i
I	c
expect	c
the	c
water	c
to	c
be	c
as	i
crystal	c
clear	c
.	c

I	c
've	c
also	c
chosen	c
singing	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
an	c
awful	c
singer	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
learn	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
for	c
vegetarian	c
food	c
for	c
me	c
as	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
very	c
extrict	i
vegan	c
,	c
and	c
to	c
suggest	c
me	i
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
to	c
bring	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
really	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
my	c
stay	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
and	c
to	c
your	c
response	i
in	i
this	i
regard	i
.	c

Valverde	c

Have	c
you	c
ever	c
asked	c
yourself	c
which	c
lessons	c
or	c
activities	c
should	c
be	c
filmed	c
in	c
the	c
school	c
video	c
?	c

Well	c

I	c
've	c
just	c
polled	c
some	c
students	c
and	c
here	c
are	c
their	c
responses	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
think	c
we	c
should	c
film	c
breaks	c
,	c
because	c
in	c
my	c
opinion	c
everyone	c
knows	c
how	i
breaks	c
are	c
and	i
what	c
students	c
do	c
during	c
them	c
.	c

Nuria	c
Valverde	c

Firsty	i
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
warmly	c
for	c
this	c
great	c
prize	c

Concerning	c
the	c
dates	c
of	c
the	c
stay	c
,	c
I	c
will	c
only	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
come	c
during	c
the	c
first	c
two	c
weeks	c
of	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c

My	c
name	c
is	c
Alida	c
Fanetti	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
'm	c
writing	c
you	i
about	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
which	c
I	c
saw	c
during	c
my	c
stay	c
in	c
London	c
recently	c
.	c

One	c
evening	c
,	c
while	c
I	c
was	c
walking	c
around	c
the	c
city	c
I	i
saw	c
a	c
very	c
interesting	c
advertisement	c
,	c
which	c
was	c
about	c
a	c
musical	c
show	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
a	c
fun	i
of	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
so	c
when	c
I	c
read	c
in	i
the	i
advertisement	i
his	i
name	i
I	c
immediately	c
decided	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

The	c
tickets	c
were	c
a	c
little	c
expensive	c
but	c
I	c
was	c
with	c
other	i
TEN	c
people	c
,	c
so	c
when	c
we	c
read	c
"	c
Discounts	c
Available	c
"	c
we	c
expected	c
that	c
the	c
theatre	c
had	c
organised	c
a	c
special	c
discount	c
for	c
group	i
of	c
numerous	i
people	c
.	c

The	c
show	c
started	c
at	c
20.15	c
and	c
not	c
at	c
19.30	c
so	c
we	c
waiting	i
for	c
long	i
time	c
.	c

After	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
which	c
was	c
n't	c
as	c
good	c
as	c
we	c
expected	c

we	c
decided	c
to	c
go	c

a	c

's	c
a	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
,	c

We	c
discussed	c
the	c
programme	c
.	c

We	c
all	c
would	c
love	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
.	c

It	c
will	c
be	c
held	c
at	c
Central	c
Exhibition	c
Hall	c
on	c
14th	c
March	c
at	c
10	c
a.m	c
to	c
7	c
p.m.	c
.	c

According	c
to	c
an	i
advertisement	c
,	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
events	c
will	c
take	c
place	c
during	c
the	c
show	c
such	c
as	c
make	i
up	i
,	c
hairstyles	c
,	c
latest	c
fashions	c
and	c
leisure	c
and	c
sports	c
wear	c
.	c

It	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
golden	c
opportunity	c
to	c
know	i
up-to-date	c
fashion	c
.	c

After	c
consideration	c
,	c
we	c
would	c
like	c
you	c
to	c
reorganise	c
the	c
2nd	c
day	i
programme	c
.	c

Hide	c
and	c
Seek	c
!	c

Undoubtedly	c
,	c
their	c
the	i
first	c
enemies	c
are	c
"	c
Journalists	c
"	c
.	c

Because	c
it	c
is	c
interesting	c
and	c
they	c
can	c
forget	c
about	c
their	c
own	c
problems	c
by	c
imagining	c
celebrities	c
'	c
luxurious	c
lives	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
they	c
think	c
that	c
celebrities	c
do	c
not	c
have	c
to	c
hide	c
from	c
publicity	c
because	c
it	c
means	c
that	c
they	c
are	c
extremely	c
popular	c
with	c
people	c
and	c
being	c
loved	c

They	c
claim	c
that	c
it	c
is	c
absolutely	c
intrusion	i
on	c
the	i
privacy	c

What	c
is	c

,	c
they	c
insist	c
that	c
before	i
celebrities	c

they	c
are	c
also	c
human-beings	i
who	c
want	c
to	c
live	c
without	c

watched	c

Taking	c
everything	c
account	i
,	c
the	c
drawbacks	c
far	c
outweigh	c
its	c
benefits	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
the	i
real	c
surprise	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
just	i
in	c
July	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
going	c
to	c
study	c
at	c
my	c
university	c
untill	i
the	c
end	c
of	c
June	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
live	i
in	c
the	i
tent	i
cabin	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
more	c
comfortable	c
.	c

I	c
see	c
people	c
who	c
run	c
the	c
camp	c
are	c
very	c
good	c
in	i
organize	i
a	i
social	c
life	c
of	c
their	c
guests	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
posibilities	i
for	c
spending	c
my	c
spare	c
time	c
.	c

The	c
climbing	c
and	c
the	c
painting	c
are	c
preferred	c
by	c
me	c
the	c
most	c
.	c

Generally	c
I	c
paint	c
some	c
landscapes	c
by	c
using	c
the	i
watercolours	c
,	c
but	c
sometimes	c
I	c
try	c
to	c
paint	c
like	c
during	c
the	c
impresionist	i
by	i
using	c
blobs	c
,	c
oil	c
paint	c
and	c
canvases	c

Report	c
on	c
making	c
a	i
interesting	c
video	c

The	c
aim	c
of	c
this	c
report	c
is	c
to	c
suggest	c
which	c
lessons	c
and	c
other	c
activities	c
should	c
be	c
place	i
at	i
video	i
film	c
about	c
daily	c
life	c
at	c
our	c
school	c
.	c

Some	c
of	c
the	c
teachers	c
are	c
very	c
good	c
just	i
profesionalists	i
.	c

On	c
the	c
whole	c
our	c
school	c
have	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
different	c
possibilities	c
for	c
the	c
students	c
what	i
we	c
can	c
show	c
on	i
our	c
film	c
.	c

I	c
recommend	c
to	i
show	i
our	c
teacher	i
of	i
history	i
.	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
at	c
the	c
wrong	c
time	c
.	c

It	c
started	c
fourty	i
five	i
minutes	c
later	c
.	c

Beside	i
this	c
,	c
we	c
where	i
invited	c
to	c
visit	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c

it	c
was	c
being	c
redecorated	c

Firstly	c
,	c
one	c
advantage	c
of	c
it	c
is	c
that	c
you	c
can	c
do	c
things	c
faster	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
,	c

Therefore	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
the	c
middle	c
of	c
July	c
.	c

I	c
also	c
would	c
like	i
to	i
prefer	c
log	c
cabins	c
for	c
accommodation	c
.	c

I	c
have	i
been	i
belonging	i
to	c
a	c
swimming	c
club	c
and	c
I	c
got	c
second	c
prize	c
in	c
a	c
competition	c
last	c
summer	c
.	c

What	c
short	i
of	c
clothes	c
should	c
I	c
prepare	i
?	c

According	c
to	c
your	c
letter	c
,	c
all	c
travel	c
costs	c
are	c
included	c
in	c
your	c
service	c
,	c

how	c
much	c

Most	c
people	c
like	c
shopping	c
.	c

Basically	c
,	c
shopping	c
is	c
fun	c
,	c
but	c
is	c
it	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
?	c

However	c
,	c
shopping	c
sometimes	c
make	i
them	c
stressfull	i
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
after	c
they	c
buy	c
something	c
,	c
they	c
find	c
a	c
better	c
one	c
.	c

I	c
also	c
recommend	c
a	i
window	c
shopping	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
the	c
best	c
way	c
to	c
enjoy	c
shopping	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
say	c
how	c
happy	c
I	c
am	c
to	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
take	c
part	c
of	i
"	c
Camp	c
California	c
in	c
the	c
USA	c
"	c
.	c

(	c
Do	c
I	c
need	c
any	c
special	c
garments	c
?	c
)	c
and	c
could	c
you	c
tell	c
me	c
please	c
,	c
if	c
I	c
need	c
some	c
extra	c
money	c
to	c
pay	c
for	c
anything	c
like	c
trips	c
or	c
photo-paper	c
.	c

I	c
like	c
going	c
between	c
colourful	c
shelfs	i
and	c
picking	c
some	c
nice	c
things	c
for	c
dinner	c
or	c
for	c
decorating	c
our	c
house	c
with	c
.	c

Then	c
,	c
all	c
shops	c
and	c
supermarkets	c
are	c
crowded	c
.	c

People	c
are	c
trying	c
to	c
buy	c
as	c
many	c
things	c
as	c
they	c
can	c
,	c
and	c
everyone	c
wants	c
to	c
be	c
first	c
to	c
the	c
check-out	c
-	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
wait	c
ages	c
to	c
get	c
there	c
!	c

I	c
always	c
become	c
very	c
angry	c
with	c
myself	c
afterwards	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
cannot	c
help	c
it	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
shopping	c
could	c
be	c
really	c
enjoyable	c
!	c

The	c
only	c
advice	c
would	c
be	c
:	c
"	c
Do	c
not	c
do	c
your	c
shopping	c
at	c
Christmast	i
or	c
Easter	c
time	c
"	c

but	c
it	c
will	c
not	c
make	c
any	c
sense	c
,	c
will	c
it	c
?	c

17th	c
June	c
2000	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

Let	c
's	c
have	c
a	c
look	c
at	c
different	c
points	c
.	c

From	c
the	c
past	c
until	c
now	c
,	c
we	c
have	c
wearing	i
several	c
different	c
fashionable	i
clothes	i
,	c
but	c
why	c
?	c

Anyway	c
,	c
do	c
n't	c
you	c
think	c
that	c
nowadays	i
,	c
fashionable	c
clothes	c
is	i
quite	c
similar	c
than	i
20	i
years	c
ago	c
?	c

It	c
's	c
evident	c
that	c
whatever	c
we	c
wear	c
look	i
like	c
clothes	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
we	c
should	c
stop	c
being	c
so	c
stupid	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
n't	c
get	c
any	c
discount	c
;	c
that	c
mean	i
,	i
that	c
the	c
advertisement	c
was	c
wrong	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
bought	c
the	c
ticket	c
anyway	c
.	c

In	i
that	c
moment	c
I	c
was	c
realy	i
angry	c
,	c
so	c
to	c
calm	c
down	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
,	c
because	c
of	c
its	c
bad	c
cleaning	i
and	c
food	c
.	c

That	c
was	c
too	c
much	c
.	c

"	c
Dear	c
"	c
manager	c
I	c
hope	c
you	c
to	i
understand	i
me	c
,	c
so	i
I	c
ask	c
for	c
money	c
back	c
and	c
I	c
hope	c
this	c
wont	i
happen	c
again	c
.	c

By	i

It	c
's	c
difficult	c
for	c
us	c
to	c
realize	i
the	c
changes	c
in	c
our	c
live	i
,	c
but	c
we	c
can	c
think	c
about	c
it	i
.	c

How	c
has	c
it	c
change	i
my	c
daily	c
life	c
?	c

Well	c
,	c
in	c
one	c
word	c
it	c
made	c
my	c
life	c
comfortabler	i
.	c

Now	c
I	c
only	c
used	i
to	c
push	c
a	c
button	c
,	c
and	c
things	c
or	c
mashines	i
work	c
on	c
their	c
own	c
.	c

Everything	c
is	c
faster	c
,	c
and	c
sometimes	c
technology	c
go	i
so	c
fast	c
that	c
I	c
'm	c
unable	c
to	c
follow	c
it	c
.	c

Maybe	c
,	c
I	c
wo	c
n't	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
understand	c
how	c
the	c
things	c
worked	i
and	c
that	c
scare	i
me	c
,	i
I	c
will	c
be	c
useless	c
,	c
because	c
a	c
mashine	i
will	c
do	c
all	c
the	c
work	c
.	c

Finaly	i
when	c
we	c
had	c
seen	c
the	c
Musical	c
,	c
we	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
restaurant	c
and	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
they	c
done	i
some	c
dekoreting	i
,	c
and	c
you	c
wrott	i
in	c
your	c
advertisement	c
"	i
Visit	c
our	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
"	c

At	i
first	i
I	c
think	c
that	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
we	c
are	c
going	c
to	c
wear	c
less	i
clothes	c
because	c
the	c
climet	i
are	i
being	i
warmer	c
and	c
warmer	c
.	c

Secondly	c
I	c
think	c
we	c
have	i
more	i
mixing	c
clothes	c
from	c
all	c
over	c
the	c
world	c
,	c
because	c
we	c
are	c
traveling	i
more	i
and	i
more	i
around	i
.	c

And	c
that	c
is	c
nice	c
if	c
you	c
can	c
pick	c
up	c
the	c
best	c
thing	i
from	c
all	c
over	c
the	c
world	c
,	c
but	c
on	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
it	c
is	c
not	c
so	c
nice	c
if	c
every	c
country	i
wear	i
some	i
type	c
of	c
clothes	c
.	c

In	c
fact	c
,	c
only	i
after	i
having	c
going	i
into	c
the	c
theatre	c
,	c
I	c
realized	c
that	c
the	c
advertisement	c
I	c
had	c
read	c
was	c
probably	c
about	c
another	c
show	c
.	c

But	c
that	c
would	c
be	c
nothing	c
if	c
I	i
thought	i
to	i
dinner	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
cancelled	i
because	c
your	c
show	c
started	c
at	c
20.15	c
,	c
although	c
it	c
should	c
have	c
been	c
at	c
19.30	c
!	c

Besides	c
,	c
when	c
we	c
decided	c
to	c
spend	c
the	c
evening	c
in	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
,	c
we	c
were	c
informed	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
the	c
chef	c
was	c
ill	c
.	c

At	c
that	c
point	c
,	c
even	c
if	c
there	i
had	i
been	i
Danny	i
Brook	i
as	c
the	c
advertisement	c
announced	c
,	c
it	c
would	i
n't	i
have	c
been	c
a	c
less	i
disappointing	c
evening	c
.	c

What	c
have	i
moved	c
me	c
to	c
this	i
discover	i
were	c
the	c
facts	i
that	c
happened	c
last	c
month	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
just	c
quarreled	i
with	c
Jon	c
,	c
who	c
is	c
my	c
fiance	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
when	c
Peter	c
,	c
who	c
has	c
been	c
a	c
friend	c
of	c
mine	c
since	c
we	c
were	c
children	c
invited	i
me	c
for	c
a	c
pizza	c
,	c
I	c
accepted	c
without	c
thinking	c
at	i
the	c
consequences	c
.	c

He	c
became	c
very	c
angry	c
no	c
matter	c
how	c
hard	c
I	c
tried	c
telling	i
him	c
the	c
truth	c
.	c

Then	c
with	c
my	i
disappointing	i
I	c
noticed	c
that	c
there	c
was	c
different	i
actor	c
instead	c
of	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
.	c

Nobody	c
informed	c
me	c
about	c
it	i
.	c

After	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
my	c
friends	c
and	c
me	i
decided	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
your	c
restaurant	c
,	c
but	c
we	c
were	c
amazed	c
to	c
find	c
it	c
close	i
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
I	c
ask	i
for	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
a	i
perfect	c
evening	c
like	i
your	c
advice	i
showed	i
.	c

I	c
hope	c
that	c
you	c
understand	c
me	c
.	c

Awaiting	c
your	c
reply	c
,	c

It	c
's	c
true	c
that	c
modern	c
technology	c
has	c
changed	c
our	c
daily	c
life	c
.	c

Certainly	c
it	i
will	i
be	i
easier	c
and	c
faster	c
than	c
write	i
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
nice	c
when	c
you	c
were	c
waiting	c
for	c
a	c
letter	c
.	c

It	c
could	i
n't	i
allow	i
us	c
to	i
think	i
and	c
to	i
do	i
freely	c
.	c

So	c
they	c
prefer	c
leave	i
their	c
sons	c
wecting	i
TV	c
.	c

Modern	c
technology	c
?	c

Yes	c
,	c
but	c
we	c
must	c
n't	c
loose	i
the	i
values	c
and	i
our	c
free	i
time	i
to	c
stay	i
with	c
our	c
family	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
really	c
glad	c
to	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
win	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
and	c
travel	c
to	c
the	c
U.S.A.	c
which	i
I	c
used	c
to	c
dream	c
.	i

Now	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
reply	c
some	i
questions	c
you	c
need	i
,	c
willingly	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
they	c
will	c
give	c
me	c
such	c
a	c
long	c
holiday	c
enough	i
to	c
travel	c
for	c
two	c
weeks	c
in	c
June	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
staying	c
tents	i
to	c
log	c
cabins	c
,	c
as	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
observe	c

and	c
stay	c
in	i
outdoor	i
as	c
much	c
time	c
as	c
I	c
can	c

How	c
are	c
you	c
going	i
these	c
days	c
?	c

In	c
my	c
view	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
extremely	c
interesting	c
and	c
satisfing	i
for	c
me	c
all	c
the	c
concert	c
long	c
.	c

Talking	c
of	c
my	c
work	c
,	c
I	c
had	i
to	i
mostly	i
make	i
the	c
concert	c
stage	c
with	c
some	c
fellows	i
.	c

If	c
you	c
choose	i
the	c
post	c
,	c
you	c
would	c
be	c
exhausted	i
throughlly	i
in	i
the	c
end	c
of	c
the	c
concert	c
.	c

As	c
I	c
could	c
take	c
a	c
rest	c
beside	c
the	c
concert	c
stage	c
while	c
someone	c
was	c
singing	c
a	c
song	c
,	c
I	c
saw	c
a	c
number	c
of	c
famous	c
musicians	c
nearby	c
.	c

Although	c
I	c
can	i
not	i
explain	c
any	c
more	c
about	c
the	c
thing	c
I	c
felt	c
during	c
the	c

'd	c
like	c
to	c

you	c
to	c
help	c
at	c
a	c

13th	c
June	c
2000	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
happy	c
to	c
spend	c
two	c
weeks	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
gone	i
to	c
U.S.A.	i
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
travel	c
only	c
in	c
July	c
,	c
because	c
I	i
have	i
not	i
to	i
work	i
and	c
because	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
have	i
accomodation	i
in	c
tent	i
and	c
so	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
july	i
is	c
the	c
best	c
period	i
to	c
spend	c
two	c
weeks	c
in	c
tent	i
.	c

I	c
have	c
just	c
been	c
in	i
tent	i
and	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
always	c
a	c
beautiful	c
and	c
interested	i
adventure	c
.	c

I	c
like	c
very	c
much	c
to	c
be	c
alone	c
with	c
nature	c
and	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
girl	c
,	c
I	c
had	i
gone	i
to	i
a	c
surfing-course	i
for	c
five	c
years	c
and	c
I	c
won	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
prizes	c
.	c

Your	i
sincerelly	i

Even	c
if	c
the	c
job	c
was	c
so	i
hard	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
an	c
amused	i
experience	c
.	c

I	c
woke	c
up	c
at	c
six	c
a.m.	c
and	c
I	c
worked	c
until	c
nine	c
p.m.	c
but	c
it	c
is	i
n't	i
a	c
problem	c
for	c
me	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
like	c
spending	c
my	c
time	c
with	c
other	c
people	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
wonderful	c
!	c

It	c
made	c
me	c
happy	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
than	i
you	c
for	c
the	c
opportunity	c
you	c
offer	i
me	c

In	c
addition	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
swim	c
in	c
a	c
sea	c
like	c
California	c
's	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
clean	c
and	c
beautiful	c
.	c

I	c
chose	c
climbing	c
because	c
I	c
'm	c
intrested	i
in	c
this	c
sport	c
even	i
if	i
I	c
'm	c
not	c

As	c
a	c
conclusion	c
I	c
would	c

to	c
ask	c
you	c
about	c
the	c
money	c
and	c
the	c
cloths	i
I	c

Dear	c
Kim	c

Yesterday	c
I	c
received	c
your	c
letter	c
and	c
it	c
made	c
me	c
happy	c
that	c
you	c
and	c
your	c
family	c
are	c
healthy	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
asked	c
me	c
I	c
will	c
write	c
you	i
about	c
the	c
experience	c
I	c
had	c
helping	c
at	c
the	c
pop	c
concert	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
I	c
had	c
the	c
opportunity	c
to	c
talk	c
to	c
the	c
singers	c
and	c
have	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
autogrammes	i
by	c
them	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
received	c
your	c
letter	c
and	c
I	c
so	i
happy	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
the	c
holiday	c
in	c
California	c
.	c

It	c
will	c
be	c
a	c
pleasure	c
for	c
me	c
give	i
you	c
the	c
information	c
that	c
you	c
need	c
.	c

With	c
reference	c
to	c
the	c
accommodation	c
I	i
would	c
prefer	c
log	i
cabins	i
to	c
tents	i
.	c

I	c
think	c
the	i
log	c
cabins	c
are	c
more	c
comfortable	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
slept	c
in	c
a	c
tents	i
.	c

When	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
child	c
I	c
used	c
to	c
play	c
daily	c
with	c
my	c
classmates	c
and	c
now	c
I	c
am	i
playing	i
at	c
least	c
at	i
the	i
weekend	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
taken	c
a	c
Photography	c
course	c
and	c
I	c
enjoy	c
taking	c
photos	c
to	i
animals	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
,	i
how	c
much	c
I	i
need	c
and	c
what	c
type	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
should	c
take	c
?	c

Could	c
you	c
tell	c
me	c
about	c
the	c
weather	c
,	c
please	c
?	c

In	c
addition	c
I	c
checked	c
the	c
e-mail	c
dialy	i
and	c
answered	c
the	c
phone	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
know	c
I	i
sold	c
tickets	c
in	c
some	c
schools	c
and	c
pubs	c
,	c
too	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
this	c
was	c
the	c
best	c
of	c
all	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
have	c
the	c
opportunity	c
of	c
involving	i
in	c
something	c
like	c
this	c
you	i
do	c
not	c
hesitate	c

17th	c
December	c
2000	c

Dear	c
Sirs	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
disappointed	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
first	i
,	c
very	c
excited	c
to	c
see	i
the	c
show	c
,	c
because	c
on	i
the	c
advertisement	c
it	c
said	c
that	c
it	c
is	c
the	c
best	c
musical	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

It	c
should	c
be	i
from	c
7,30	i
p.m	c
,	i
but	c
it	c
was	i
from	i
8.15	c
p.m.	c
!	c

I	c
want	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
ticket	c
.	c

After	c
the	c
show	c
I	c
went	c
the	i
'	c
THEATRE	c
RESTAURANT	c
'	c
to	c
have	c
dinner	c
,	c
but	c
the	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
because	c
they	c
closed	c
early	i
than	c
usual	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
they	c
should	c
keep	i
the	i
times	i
correctly	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
disappointed	c
with	c
everything	c
what	i
happened	c
last	c
week	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
a	c
refund	c
.	c

I	c
excpect	i
this	c
will	c
be	c
possible	c
.	c

My	c
article	c
is	c
about	c
fashion	c
in	c
.	i

future	i

Right	c
now	c
in	c
2000	c
many	c
people	c
are	c
wearing	c
modern	c
clothes	c
.	c

The	c
fashion	c
gradually	c
changed	c
from	c
the	i
old	i
days	i
and	c
it	c
is	c
still	c
changing	c
to	i
the	i
future	i
.	c

Maybe	c
in	c
100	c
years	c
from	c
now	c
,	c
fashion	c
will	c
be	c
totally	c
different	c
.	c

In	c
future	i
they	c
will	c
wear	c
balloon	c
clothes	c
,	c
because	c
to	i
make	i
people	i
fly	i
.	c

This	c
special	c
gas	c
will	c
be	i
not	i
dangerous	c
.	c

This	c
is	c
one	c
more	c
reason	c
to	c
wear	c
balloon	c
clothes	c
in	c
future	i
.	c

It	c
is	i
to	i
save	i
our	c
Earth	c
.	c

Would	c
you	c
like	c
to	c
wear	c
balloon	c
clothes	c
and	c
bounce	c
around	c
the	c
world	c
?	c

"	c
Um	i
very	c
unpleased	i
that	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
write	c
you	c
this	c
letter	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
to	c
do	c
this	c
because	c
things	c
happened	c
which	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
ignore	c
and	c
which	c
disappointed	c
me	c
very	c
much	c
.	c

We	c
had	c
a	c
great	c
time	c
together	c
until	c
we	c
decided	c
to	c
visit	c
the	c
musical	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
in	i
the	c
"	c
Circle	c
Theater	i
"	c
.	c

So	c
we	c
went	c
upstairs	c
to	c
find	c
the	c
restaurant	c
,	c
but	c
we	c
just	c
a	i
big	c
empty	c
hall	c
,	c
with	c
nothing	c
in	c
it	c
,	c
with	c
a	c
short	i
sign	c
on	c
a	c
door	c
:	c
"	c
Sorry	c
,	c
we	c
are	c
closed	c
because	i
of	i
renovations	c
"	c
!	c

Because	c
you	c
are	c
the	c
manager	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
you	c
are	c
the	c
only	c
person	c
who	c
can	c
change	c
something	i
.	c

Sincerely	c

We	c
,	c
that	c
were	i
Tim	c
,	c
Gudrun	c
,	c
Paul	c
and	c
me	c
Hedwiga	i
had	i
founded	c
our	c
own	c
mafia	c
,	c
we	c
were	c
the	c
kings	c
in	c
our	c
small	c
town	c
,	c
and	c
we	c
had	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
people	c
paying	c
us	c
money	c
,	c
so	c
that	c
we	c
wo	i
n't	i
attack	c
them	c
.	c

We	c
had	c
this	c
idea	c
first	c
,	i
when	c
we	c
watched	c
a	c
movie	c
about	c
the	c
Italian	c
mafia	c
in	c
an	c
English	c
lesson	c
in	c
school	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
love	i
of	i
first	i
slight	i
and	c
we	c
were	c
fascinated	c
by	c
the	c
thought	c
,	i
building	i
a	i
kind	i
of	i
the	i
same	i
organisation	c
in	c
our	c
town	c
.	c

His	c
thoughts	i
combined	i
and	c
ready	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
police	c
he	c
went	i
out	i
of	i
our	c
house	c
,	c
where	c
me	c
and	c
my	c
homies	i
were	c
just	c
hanging	c
aroud	i
.	c

He	c
saw	c
me	c
and	c
tolled	i
me	c
into	i
my	c
face	i
you	i
are	c
a	c
thief	c
and	c
a	c
burglar	c
and	c
I	c
will	c
go	i
now	i
to	c
the	c
police	c
,	i
I	c
did	c
n't	c
know	c
what	c
to	c
do	c
,but	c
then	c
I	c
had	c
an	c
idea	c
....	c

Yeah	c
fokes	i
,	c
that	c
was	c
the	c
point	c
I	c
got	c
interupted	i
by	c
my	c

Dear	c
Ms.	c
Ryan	c
,	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c

take	c
holiday	c
from	c
my	c
work	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
for	c
accomodation	i
,	c
I	c
prefer	c
to	c
say	c
in	c
log	c
cabins	c
,	c
as	c
I	c
have	c
no	c
experience	c
staying	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
,	c
I	c
hesitate	c
to	c
try	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
enjoy	c
singing	c
.	c

I	c
used	c
to	c
join	i
the	c
singing	c
club	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
high	c
school	c
student	c
and	c
once	c

won	c
the	c
contest	c
,	c
moreover	c
,	c
painting	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

Thanks	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

At	c
first	c
,	c
I	c
helped	c
stage	c
setting	c
,	c
as	c
you	c
know	c
they	c
use	c
lots	c
of	c
unique	c
tricks	c
in	c
their	c
concert	c
.	c

So	c
it	c
was	c
very	c
interesting	c
to	c
know	c
how	c
they	c
are	c
made	c
.	c

Then	c
,	c
I	c
helped	c
tuning	c
the	c
instruments	c
for	c
the	c
back	c
band	c
.	c

Actually	c
,	c
as	c
I	c
know	c
nothing	c
about	c
instruments	c
,	c
the	c
only	c
thing	c
I	c
could	c
do	c
was	c
just	c
turning	i
the	c
volume	c
up	c
and	c
down	c
following	c
to	i
the	c
musician	c
's	c
instruction	c
.	c

Can	c
you	c
imagine	c
how	c
much	c
I	c
appreciated	c
that	c
I	c
am	c
qualified	c
in	c
massage	c
?	c

Conclusion	c

Thank	c
you	c

much	c
for	c

We	c

,	c
when	c
you	i
'll	i

Also	c
,	c
we	c
will	c
see	c

We	c
know	c

that	c
you	c
wanted	i
to	c
have	c
another	c
and	i
did	i
n't	i
know	c

Maybe	c

So	c
,	c
we	c
think	c
,	i
that	c
it	c
is	c
very	c
good	c
as	i
for	c
you	c
as	i
for	c
us	c
.	c

Our	c
class	c
asks	c
you	c
to	c
think	c
about	c
this	c
programme	c
.	c

My	c
best	c
friend	c
told	c
me	c
,	i
she	c
met	i
one	i
boy	c
.	c

She	c
was	c
speaking	i
about	c
him	c
every	i
time	c
.	c

I	c
belived	i
everything	c
she	c
has	i
told	i
me	c
.	c

We	c
called	c
the	c
police	c
.	c

They	c
advised	c
us	c
to	c
wait	c
.	c

I	c
took	c
any	i
papers	i
,	c
put	c
them	i
to	i
one	i
bag	c
and	c
without	c
saying	c
anything	c
went	c
to	c
my	c
friend	c
to	c
take	i
something	c
like	i
gun	i
.	c

The	c
friend	c
gave	c
me	c
his	c
toy	c
and	i
I	c
gone	i
to	i
the	c
street	c
.	c

I	c
showed	c
the	c
man	c
,	i
that	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
gun	c
and	c
money	c
.	c

Do	c
n't	c
believe	c
everyone	c
!	c

It	c
would	c
be	c
meaningful	c
in	c
my	c
life	c
to	c
take	c
part	c
in	c
your	c
camp	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
I	c
used	c
to	c
play	c
golf	c
with	c
my	c
father	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
was	c
14	c
,	c
I	c
won	c
the	i
competition	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
about	c
Camp	c
California	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c

you	c
know	c
about	c
my	c

you	c
wanted	c

My	c
main	c

was	c
to	c

up	c
her	c

If	c

Hi	c
Kim	c
!	c

Last	c
month	c
I	c
was	c
helping	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
with	c
a	c
few	c
friends	c
of	c
mine	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
Tina	i
Turner	c
concert	c
!	c

To	i
this	c
moment	c
when	c
I	i
'm	i
thinking	i
of	c
it	c
I	c
want	c
shout	i
.	c

At	c
first	c
I	c
was	c
helping	c
to	c
seill	i
the	c
tickets	c
-	c
was	i
n't	c
difficult	c
.	c

We	c
had	c
to	c
check	c
evey	i
plug	c
,	c
switch	c
,	c
lights	i
.	c

I	c
could	c
n't	c
belive	i
how	c
big	c
the	i
lamp	c
can	c
be	c
.	c

That	c
's	c
why	c
singers	c
are	c
hot	c
.	c

fortunetly	i
nothing	c
had	c
happend	i
.	c

Every-thing	i
was	c
O.K	c

After	c
concert	i
we	c
were	c
invited	c
in	i
backstage	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
answer	i
the	c
informations	i
that	c
you	c
need	c
from	c
me	c
.	c

First	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
doing	i
this	c
competition	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
also	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
the	c
prize	c
.	c

Answering	c
your	c
questions	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
only	c
en	i
July	c
because	c
this	c
is	c
the	c
month	c
of	c
my	c
vacations	i
.	c

According	c
to	c
your	c
letter	c
I	i
have	c
two	c
options	c
of	i
accommodation	c
,	c
or	i
in	c
tents	c
or	c
log	c
cabins	c
.	c

The	c
reason	c
of	i
choosing	c
this	i
two	c
activities	c
is	c
that	c
they	c
contrast	c
itselves	i
,	i
I	c
want	c
one	c
more	i
exciting	c
and	c
that	c
asks	c
for	c
more	c
agility	c
and	c
another	c
more	i
calm	i
and	c
relaxing	c
,	c
that	c
asks	c
only	c
for	c
my	c
ability	c
to	c
paint	c
.	c

Please	c
answer	c
my	c
letter	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
is	i
possible	c
.	c

Your	i
faithfully	c
,	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

I	c
vish	i
you	c
were	i
here	c
with	c
me	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
I	c
went	c
with	c
my	c
friend	c
to	c
the	c
concert	c
with	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
fans	c
.	c

We	c
bought	c
tickets	c
to	c
the	c
show	c
and	c
also	c
to	c
the	c
fan	i
's	i
bus	c
.	c

Yes	c
,	c
there	c
is	c
a	c
bus	c
that	c
take	i
you	c
to	c
the	c
concert	c
and	c
bring	i
you	c
back	c
.	c

The	i
shouted	c
:	c
"	c
20:30	c
you	c
all	c
have	c
to	c
be	c
back	c
because	c
the	c
bus	c
will	c
leave.	c
"	c

Suddenly	c
a	c
man	c
came	c
and	c
started	c
to	c
tell	c
us	c
his	c
adventures	c
.	c

After	c
a	c
few	c
minutes	c
(	c
I	c
fought	i
were	i
few	i
)	c
I	c
realized	c
that	c
the	c
coffee	c
house	c
was	c
empty	c
.	c

You	c
can	i
not	i
imagine	c
how	c
dissapointed	i
I	c
were	i
with	c
my	i
ownself	i
.	c

When	c
we	c
arrived	c
the	c
concert	c
had	c
already	c
began	i
.	c

When	c
we	c
were	c
running	c
to	c
enter	c
a	c
man	c
called	c
us	c
.	c

He	c
was	c
helping	c
to	c
put	c
the	c
materials	i
of	i
the	i
concerts	i
(	c
microphone	c
...	c
)	c
on	c
the	c
stage	c
.	c

He	c
asked	c
if	c
we	c
could	c
help	c
.	c

We	c
answered	c
:	c
"	c
Yes	c
!	c
"	c

That	c
was	c
the	c
best	c
night	c
of	c
my	c
life	c
.	c

I	c
wish	i
that	c
you	c
liked	c
my	c
experience	c
.	c

I	c
will	c
give	c
you	c
some	c
information	c
which	c
helps	i
you	c
to	c
know	c
me	c
better	c
.	c

I	c
will	c
be	c
very	c
busy	c
in	c
June	c
so	c
let	c
me	c
tell	c
you	c
some	c
details	c
about	c
my	c
travel	i
.	c

Basketball	c
and	c
swimming	c
I	c
think	c
are	c
the	c
best	c
for	c
the	c
children	c
.	c

Basketball	c
will	c
help	c
children	i
to	c
build	c
team	c
character	i
and	c
leadership	c
.	i

And	c
swimming	c
is	c
very	c
good	c
for	c
health	i
.	c

I	c
count	i
on	i
my	c
experience	c
.	c

And	c
there	c
are	c
few	i
questions	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
our	c
meeting	c
.	c

Vasiliy	c
Alekseyev	c
.	c

Last	c
month	c
I	c
enjoyed	c
helping	c
at	c
concert	i
of	c
"	c
Modern	c
Talking	c
''	c
and	c
now	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
share	c
with	c
you	c
about	i
my	c
experience	c
.	c

And	c
what	c
do	c
you	c
think	c
I	c
answered	c
?	c

I	c
have	i
got	i
very	c
responsible	i
work	c
I	i
had	c
to	c
bring	c
food	c
for	c
Peter	c
Bolen	c
and	c
Tomas	c
Anders	c
.	c

Can	c
you	c
imagine	c
?	c

It	c
was	c
the	c
happiest	c
moment	c
of	c
my	c
life	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
nervous	c
talking	c
with	c
him	c
.	c

Yours	i
faithfully	i
,	c

I	c
have	c
got	c
a	c
few	c
things	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
your	i
theart	i
.	c

But	c
in	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
there	c
was	c
a	i
another	c
actor	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
so	c
disappointing	i
,	c
because	c
I	c
came	c
far	i
away	c
to	c
see	c
Danny	c
Broke	c
.	c

Note	i
says	c
that	c
tickets	i
has	i
discounts	i
available	i
,	c
but	c
I	c
bought	c
my	c
ticket	c
and	c
your	c
people	c
told	c
me	c
that	c
there	c
is	c
not	i
any	i
discount	c
for	i
thicket	i
.	c

I	c
deciced	i
to	c
go	c
and	c
visit	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
,	i
But	c
I	c
went	c
there	c
and	c
it	c
is	i
closed	c
for	c
some	c
reasons	i
.	c

The	i
note	i
says	i
that	i
your	i
perfect	i
evening	i
out	i
,	i
I	i
thought	i
I	i
could	i
get	i
my	i
money	i
back	i
,	i
with	i
your	i
poor	i
service	i
and	i
all	i
my	i
reasons	i
,	i
But	i
it	i
was	i
not	i
ask	i
for	i
money	i
back	i
.	c

We	c
also	i
can	i
produce	c
more	c
and	c
better	c
food	c
or	i
using	c
science	c
and	c
technology	c
.	i

Science	c
and	c
technology	c
can	c
also	c
used	i
for	i
some	c
material	i
e.g.	i
steel	c
or	c
iron	c
,	c
which	c
use	i
for	i
our	c
building	i
,	i
it	i
can	c
make	c
it	i
stronger	c
and	c
not	i
easy	i
to	c
destroy	c
.	c

Science	c
and	c
technology	c
can	c
give	c
us	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
good	c
thing	i
for	c
our	c
daily	c
life	c
,	c
make	i
us	i
easy	i
to	c
do	c
thing	i
or	c
work	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

After	c
your	c
show	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
visit	c
my	c
friends	c
,	c
and	c
because	c
of	c
it	c
,	c
I	c
did	i
n't	i
do	c
it	i
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
,	c
but	c
any	i
way	i
I	i
trusted	i
him	i
.	c

We	c
spoke	i
with	i
Pat	c
many	c
times	c
to	c
keep	c
this	c
secret	c
,	c
not	c
to	c
tell	c
anyone	c
.	c

He	c
promised	c
to	c
keep	c
secret	i
,	i
in	i
the	i
next	c
morning	c
we	c
had	c
arguiment	i
with	c
Pat	c
,	i
3	i
of	c
us	c
were	c
shouting	c
at	c
each	c
other	c
,	i
in	i
shorter	i
Pat	i
went	i
away	i
from	i
us	c
.	c

Two	c
days	c
later	c
in	i
the	c
morning	c
,	c
the	i
policeman	c
came	c
to	c
Peter	i
...	c

So	c
,	c
now	c
my	c
best	c
friend	c
is	c
prisoner	i
.	c

All	c
the	c
time	c
I	i
am	c
thinking	c
about	c
Peter	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
forget	c
him	c
.	c

But	c
it	c
's	c
life	c
,	c
destiny	c
,	c
very	c
cruel	c
destiny	c
...	c

Dear	c
Jane	c
,	c

I	c
have	c
read	c
the	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
festival	c
and	c
I	c
must	c
say	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
idea	c
.	c

Are	c
there	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
more	c
plays	c
and	c
films	c
next	c
year	c
?	c

I	c
find	c
the	c
reasonably-priced	c
ticket	c
excellent	c
,	c
because	c
there	c
is	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
people	c
who	c
went	i
to	c
see	c
only	c
one	c
or	c
two	c
events	c
,	c
and	c
by	c
paying	c
the	i
all	i
events	i
ticket	c
they	i
might	c
see	c
other	c
events	c
and	c
learn	c
about	c
something	c
they	c
did	c
n't	c
expected	i
to	c
find	c
interesting	c
.	c

Dear	c
John	c
,	c

Here	c
in	c
Brazil	c
the	c
rules	c
at	c
school	c
depends	i
on	c
the	c
school	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
nobody	c
said	c
anything	c
when	c
we	c
smoked	c
in	c
the	c
garden	c
or	c
in	c
the	c
bathroom	c
.	c

But	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
use	i
the	c
uniform	c
and	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
study	c
a	c
lot	c
to	c
pass	c
the	c
exams	c
.	c

the	i
rules	c
at	c
home	c
are	c
very	c
different	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
allowed	c
to	c
do	c
what	c
I	c
want	c
as	c
long	c
as	c
I	c
studie	i
enough	c
to	c
aprove	i
.	c

they	i
know	c
that	c
if	c
I	c
go	c
out	c
with	c
the	c
car	c
,	c
I	c
will	c
not	c
drink	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

I	c
have	i
come	i
to	c
watch	i
the	c
musical	c
show	c
called	c
'	c
Over	c
The	c
Rainbow	c
'	c
in	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
really	c
disappointed	c
because	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
things	c
were	c
not	c
done	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
written	i
that	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
were	c
starring	c
in	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

Danny	c
Brook	c
was	c
not	c
there	c
,	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
was	c
in	c
his	c
place	c
.	c

That	c
was	c
very	c
disappointing	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

The	c
musical	c
show	c
was	c
going	i
to	c
start	c
at	c
19.30	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
started	c
t	i
20:15	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
buy	c
tickets	c
,	c
they	c
did	c
n't	c
accept	i
the	i
discounts	c
.	c

Now	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
you	c
have	c
seen	c
it	i
was	c
not	c
a	c
perfect	c
evening	c
at	c
all	c
,	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
things	i
written	i
were	c
not	c
done	c
So	i
I	c
am	c
asking	c
to	c
get	c
some	c
of	c
my	c
money	c
back	c

MY	i
daily	c

I	c
go	c
shopping	c
,	c
watch	c
TV	c
,	c
walk	c
around	c
the	c

,	c
use	c
my	c

Modern	c

everywhere	c
in	c
my	c

For	c

,	c
I	c
get	c
up	c
whenever	c
I	c
want	c
using	c
my	c
watch	c
or	c
clock	c

Now	c
it	c

You	c

whichever	c

A	c
wonderful	c
example	c
for	i
modern	c
technology	c
:	c
Computer	i
!	c

It	c
is	c
not	c
a	c
living	c
thing	c
but	c
it	c

You	c
can	c
talk	c

wonderful	c
idea	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
only	c
for	c
few	i
days	c
but	c
not	c
over	c
3	c
days	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
not	c
good	c
at	c
swimming	c
but	c
I	c
would	c
very	c
much	c
like	c
to	c
learn	c
how	c
to	c
swim	c
this	c
year	c
.	c

Lastly	c
I	c
would	c
particularly	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
about	c
clothes	c
and	c
money	c
.	c

Is	c
n't	c
it	c
cold	c
at	c
night	c
in	c
the	c
Camp	c
California	c
?	c

I	c
like	c
ice	c
cram	i
,	c
sweets	c
and	c
beverage	i
very	c
much	c
especially	i
in	c
the	c
summer	c
.	c

Could	c
you	c
please	c
tell	c
me	c
about	c
these	c
?	c

Shin	c

You	c
can	c
also	c
see	c
more	c
graceful	c
and	c
fine	c
thing	i
.	c

You	c
usually	c
visit	c
many	c
shops	c
and	c
compare	c
the	c
quality	c
and	c
the	c
price	c
and	c
select	c
the	c
best	c
one	c
which	c
suits	c
to	i
you	c

London	c

17th	c

Then	c
,	c
I	c
not	c
only	c
had	c
to	c
wait	c
45	c
minutes	c
more	c
than	c
it	i
was	i
expected	c
for	c
the	c
beginning	c
of	c
the	c
show	c
but	c
I	c
realised	c
that	c
the	c
main	c
actor	c
had	c
been	c
replaced	c
by	c
another	c
one	i
(	i
very	i
bad	i
)	i
as	c
well	c
.	c

Those	c
were	i
the	c
reasons	c
for	c
my	c
asking	c
a	i
refund	c
of	c
the	c
£	c
20	c
I	c
paid	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c

faithfully	c

I	c
ca	c

Dear	c
Ms	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
regarding	c
the	c
letter	c
you	c
sent	c
me	c
,	i
about	c
the	c
two	c
weeks	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
that	c
I	c
won	c
.	c

Secondely	i
,	c
I	c
am	c
interested	c
in	c
discovering	i
something	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
done	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
do	c
sailing	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
to	c
relate	i
my	c
experience	c
in	i
helping	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
last	c
month	c
.	c

The	c
second	c
day	i
objective	c
was	c
to	c
install	c
the	c
scene	i
,	i
with	i
lights	i
,	i
loudspeakers	i
and	i
all	i
stuff	i
.	c

The	c
last	c
day	c
,	c
in	i
fact	i
the	i
concert	i
day	i
was	i
absolutely	c
fantastic	c
.	c

The	c
public	i
was	c
so	c
excited	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
concert	c
that	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
place	c
some	c
bouncer	i
front	i
of	c
the	c
scene	i
,	i
to	c
avoid	i
the	i
people	c
coming	i
on	i
the	i
concert	i
floor	i
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
the	c
concert	c
was	c
exactly	c
that	i
the	c
people	c
were	c
expected	i
.	c

See	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
in	i
the	i
name	i
of	i
the	c
whole	c
class	c
.	c

The	i
entrance	i
for	c
student	i
is	c
free	c
.	c

The	c
shopping	c
could	c
be	c
done	c
after	c
the	c
river	c
trip	c
to	c
Greenwich	c
but	c
only	c
if	c
we	c
have	c
enough	c
time	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

Will	c
the	c
home	c
of	c
the	c
future	c
really	c
look	c
different	c
?	c

The	c
place	c
to	c
spend	c
the	c
night	c
will	c
still	c
be	c
the	c
bed	c
.	c

In	c
general	c
we	c
can	c
say	i
the	c
huge	c
change	i
we	c
already	i
had	i
,	c
but	c
who	c
knows	c
exactly	c
what	c
the	c
future	c
will	c
bring	c
to	i
us	c
?	c

Anyway	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
that	i
how	c
many	c
people	c
are	c
joining	i
at	i
this	c
Camp	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c

Thanks	c
for	c
your	c
last	c
letter	c
.	c

How	c
are	c
you	c
doing	c
?	c

Anyway	c
,	c
I	c
enjoyed	c
helping	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
last	c
month	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
known	i
,	c
I	c
like	c
drawing	c
and	c
painting	c
when	c
I	c
have	c
a	i
free	c
time	c
so	c
that	c
why	i
I	c
chose	c
to	c
paint	c
the	c
scence	i
of	i
the	i
background	i
.	c

And	c
I	c
particularly	c
liked	c
the	c
experience	c
that	i
I	i
helped	i
to	c
screen	i
and	c
paint	c
a	c
picture	c
of	c
"	c
Bon	c
Jovi	c
"	c
on	c
every	c
T-shirts	i
which	c
are	i
given	c
to	c
the	c
audiences	i
.	c

If	c
you	c
are	c
,	c
I	c
'll	c
tell	c
you	c
in	i
advance	c
.	c

I	c
must	c
stop	c
writing	c
now	c
as	c
I	c
have	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
homework	c
to	c
do	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
be	c
starring	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
but	c
in	c
a	i
real	c
show	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
.	c

Because	c
I	c
'm	c
big	c
fan	c
of	c
them	c
,	c
if	i
was	c
pretty	c
much	i
boring	c
without	c
them	c
and	c
not	c
to	c
mention	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
disappointing	c
.	c

Discounts	c
were	c
n't	c
available	c
at	c
all	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
therefore	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
to	c
ask	c
for	c
the	c
money	c
back	c
as	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
get	c
any	c
advantages	c
or	c
services	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Nearly	i
almost	i
of	i
the	i
disease	i
have	i
been	i
found	i
the	i
way	i
to	i
cure	i
except	c
only	i
a	c
few	c
like	c
AIDS	c
.	c

Basically	c
modern	i
technology	c
has	c
changed	i
our	c
life	c
more	c
comfortably	i
but	c
there	c
are	c
some	c
disadvantages	c
such	c
as	c
lack	c
of	c
friendship	c
,	c
togetherness	c
because	c
of	c
people	c
staying	c
in	c
their	c
house	c
being	c
on	c
the	c
Internet	c
for	c
whole	i
day	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

As	c
I	c
am	c
doing	c
my	c
A-levels	i
exams	c
at	c
the	c
moment	c
and	c
they	c
continue	c
until	c
the	c
30th	c
of	c
June	c
and	c
my	c
further	c
studies	c
start	c
in	c
August	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
only	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
play	c
this	c
game	c
at	c
your	c
camp	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
never	c
tried	c
out	i
climbing	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
have	c
always	c
wished	i
to	c
do	c
it	c
one	c
day	c
.	c

Could	c
you	c
possibly	c
tell	c
me	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
might	c
spend	c
at	c
California	c
Camp	c
?	c

Thank	c
you	c
in	c
advance	c
for	c
your	c
help	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
receiving	c
your	c
prompt	c
reply	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

Hi	c
,	c
how	c
are	c
you	c
?	c

You	c
asked	c
me	c
to	c
wite	i
about	c
my	i
experience	c
which	c
I	c
made	i
by	i
helping	c
at	c
the	c
pop-concert	c
.	c

My	c
job	c
was	c
actually	c
to	c
listen	c
to	c
Tim	c
and	c
do	c
whatever	c
he	c
said	c
.	c

This	c
included	c
to	i
clean	i
up	c
the	c
rooms	c
which	c
were	c
used	c
by	c
the	c
singers	c
and	c
put	i
some	c
equipment	c
on	c
the	c
stage	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
never	c
been	c
behind	c
the	c
stage	c
before	c
and	c
you	c
know	c
the	c
rooms	c
,	c
in	c
which	c
singers	c
dress	c
and	c
make-up	i
,	c
are	c
actually	c
small	c
.	c

Can	c
you	c
imagine	c
,	c
I	c
could	c
stay	i
at	c
this	c
concert	c
without	c
paying	c
anything	c
!	c

I	c
think	c
this	c
was	c
my	c
best	c
job	c
as	c
a	c
student	c
in	c
Cambridge	c
.	c

Probably	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
so	c
nice	c
to	c
do	c
jobs	c
which	c
you	c
were	c
told	c
to	c
do	c
,	c
but	c
you	c
see	i
many	c
stars	c
out	i
of	i
stage	i
.	c

And	c
you	c
might	i
manage	i
to	c
speak	c
to	c
some	c
pop-stars	c
.	c

Beside	c
this	c
,	c
I	c
earned	c
some	c
money	c
,	i
not	c
a	c
lot	c
but	c
enough	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

Well	c
I	c
'll	c
have	c
to	c
close	c
now	c
.	c

Give	c
my	c
regards	c
to	c
your	c
parents	c
.	c

Looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sirs	c
,	c

When	c
we	c
arrived	c
at	c
the	c
theatre	c
we	c
had	i
to	i
realise	i
that	c
there	c
were	c
no	c
discountable	i
tickets	c
available	c
as	c
mentioned	i
in	c
your	c
advertisment	i
so	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
buy	c
the	c
most	c
expensive	c
ones	c
.	c

After	c
that	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
theatre	c
assistants	c
told	c
us	c
that	c
the	c
film	i
would	c
have	i
began	i
at	c
20:15	c
o'clock	i
instead	c
of	c
19:30	c
o'clock	i
as	c
indicated	i
.	c

You	c
can	c
imagine	c
how	c
disappointed	c
we	c
were	c
especially	i
the	i
acting	i
of	i
Danny	i
Brook	i
was	c
the	c
main	c
reason	c
for	i
us	i
to	i
see	c
the	c
musical	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
your	c
promt	i
reply	c
.	c

yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

Heine	c
Bitz	c

In	c
the	c
next	c
100	c
years	c
there	c
will	c
be	c
no	c
change	c
in	c
that	c
but	c
the	i
fashion	c
is	c
going	c
to	c
develop	c
in	c
a	c
special	c
imaginative	c
way	c
.	c

There	c
are	c
the	c
natural	c
material	i
on	c
one	c
side	c
whereas	c
on	c
the	c
other	c
side	c
the	c
fashion	c
industry	c
produce	i
more	c
and	c
more	c
syntetical	i
clothes	i
,	c
which	c
relay	i
on	i
the	c
production	c
cost	c
.	c

Beyond	c
colours	i
will	c
play	c
an	c
important	c
role	c
in	c
the	c
next	c
century	c
for	c
the	i
fashion	c
.	c

Especially	i
contrast	i
will	i
be	i
attractiv	i
.	c

The	c
fashion	c
industry	c
will	c
deliver	c
a	c
wide	c
range	i
of	i
vararity	i
in	i
style	i
,	c
material	i
and	c
colour	i
.	c

There	c
will	c
be	c
clothes	c
for	c
everyones	i
tast	i
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
you	c
to	c
know	c
that	c
the	c
whole	c
organization	c
was	c
nearly	i
excellent	c
.	c

I	c
spent	c
two	c
nice	c
days	c
at	c
the	c
festival	c
full	c
of	c
art	c
.	c

The	c
jazz	c
,	c
classical	c
and	c
rock	c
concerts	c
were	c
great	c
despite	c
some	c
of	c
the	c
concert	c
halls	c
were	i
too	c
small	c
.	c

Next	c
year	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
you	c
should	c
increase	c
the	c
number	c
of	c
shows	c
,	c
concerts	c
and	c
others	i
,	c
also	i
the	c
time	c
spent	c
at	c
the	c
festival	c
(	c
for	c
example	c
:	c
at	c
least	c
5	c
days	c
)	c
,	c
then	c
everything	c
would	c
be	c
perfect	c
.	c

I	c
've	c
got	c
too	i
many	i
exams	c
nowadays	i
,	c
but	c
that	c
's	c
all	c
.	c

Our	c
school	c
is	c
really	c
very	c
diciplined	i
,	c
especially	c
about	c
our	c
clothes	c
and	c
behaviours	i
.	c

Then	c
again	c
,	c
we	c
have	c
to	c
obey	c
all	c
these	c
rules	c
.	c

I	c
ca	c
n't	c
go	c
out	c
at	c
nights	c
easily	c
,	c
but	c
that	c
is	c
not	c
something	c
that	c
I	c
mind	c
about	c
.	c

There	c
are	c
three	c
main	c
things	c
that	c
are	c
very	c
important	c
for	c
my	c
family	c
:	c
respect	c
,	c
honesty	c
and	c
trust	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
can	c
travel	c
only	c
in	c
july	i
because	c
is	i
the	c
only	c
month	c
of	i
this	c
year	c
that	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
available	c
because	i
I	c
finish	c
school	c
in	c
june	i
so	i
I	c
will	c
be	c
very	c
busy	c
and	i
in	c
August	c
I	c
start	c
to	c
study	c
at	c
the	i
University	c
,	c
so	c
july	i
is	c
the	c
best	c
month	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
travel	c
.	c

-	c
Tennis	c
because	c
is	i
my	c
favourite	c
sport	c
and	c
I	c
enjoy	c
playing	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c

from	c
you	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c
.	c

Hello	c
Kim	c
:	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
letter	i
it	i
was	c
great	c
to	c
hear	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Sorry	c
but	i
I	c
have	c
n't	c
written	c
you	i
because	c
I	c
've	c
been	c
very	c
busy	c
.	c

My	c
job	c
was	c
very	c
easy	c
I	i
had	c
to	c
help	c
Sting	c
in	i
everything	c
,	c
for	c
example	c
if	i
he	c
wanted	c
water	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
give	c
to	i
him	c
water	c
,	i
it	i
was	c
marvellous	c
.	c

The	c
best	c
thing	c
was	c
I	c
spoke	c
in	c
English	c
because	i
I	i
was	i
forgetting	i
it	i
and	c
I	c
met	c
my	c
favourite	c
singer	c
.	c

Lots	c
of	c
Love	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

I	c
have	i
read	i
your	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
show	c
and	i
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
to	c
see	c
it	c
but	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
very	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
.	c

About	c
the	c
tickets	c
,	c
I	i
the	c
advertisement	c
said	c
that	c
discounts	c
would	c
be	c
available	c
but	c
it	i
would	i
not	c
.	c

Also	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
and	c
I	c
do	c
not	c
know	c
why	c
.	c

Lastly	c
,	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
that	c
I	c
had	i
not	c
a	i
perfect	c
evening	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
be	c
grateful	c
if	c
you	c
could	i
send	c
me	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

Then	c
I	c
realised	c
that	c
Pat	c
told	c
my	i
secret	c
and	c
I	c
felt	c
very	c
angry	c
,	c
that	c
's	c
why	c
I	c
said	c
at	c
the	c
beginning	c
that	c
Pat	c
was	c
not	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
been	c
asked	c
by	c
my	c
classmates	c
to	c
write	c
to	c
you	c
to	c
suggest	c
a	c
new	c
activity	c
which	c
you	c
could	c
include	c
in	c
the	c
London	c
programme	c
if	c
you	c
liked	i
it	c
.	c

We	c
are	c
very	c
grateful	c
to	c
you	c
for	c
these	c
three	c
days	c
that	c
we	c
are	c
going	c
to	c
spend	c
in	c
the	c
English	c
capital	c
,	c
especially	c
because	c
you	c
planned	i
very	c
interesting	c
and	c
different	c
kinds	c
of	c
things	c
to	i
do	i
for	i
all	i
us	i
.	c

It	c
is	c
a	c
very	c
good	c
chance	c
to	c
join	i
this	c
exhibition	c
to	c
see	c
all	c
the	c
new	c
fashion	i
tendences	i
,	c
the	c
latest	c
hairstyles	c
and	c
make	i
up	i
as	c
all	c
we	i
came	i
from	c
many	c
different	c
countries	c
and	c
have	i
not	i
the	c
same	c
customs	c
either	i
.	c

By	i
this	i
way	c
,	c
we	c
would	c
visit	c
the	c
museum	c
as	c
you	c
had	c
planned	c
and	c
n	i
Wednesday	c
afternoon	c
we	c
could	c
use	c
the	c
free	c
time	c
to	c
do	c
some	c
shopping	c
if	c
we	c
wished	c
it	i
.	c

We	c
do	c
hope	c
you	c
like	c
our	c
suggestion	c
and	c
we	c
can	c
have	i
an	i
agreement	i
to	c
join	i
the	c
fashion	c
exhibition	c
.	c

Do	c
famous	c
people	c
,	c
such	c
as	c
politicians	c
and	c
film	c
stars	c
,	c
deserve	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
private	c
life	c
without	c
journalists	c
following	c
them	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
?	c

Some	c
people	c
think	c
that	c
they	c
should	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
my	c
deceiveful	i
experience	c
at	c
your	c
theatre	c
last	c
Saturday	c
night	c
.	c

What	c
I	c
thought	c
it	i
was	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
a	c
wonderful	c
night	c
became	c
into	i
the	c
worst	c
night	c
at	c
the	c
theatre	c
I	c
've	c
ever	c
had	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
must	c
admit	c
that	c
when	c
we	c
realised	c
the	c
main	c
character	i
had	c
been	c
changed	c
we	c
felt	c
really	c
disappointed	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
despite	c
of	i
your	c
advertisement	i
of	i
the	c
possibility	c
of	c
discounts	c
,	c
when	c
I	c
showed	c
my	c
student	c
identity	c
card	c
to	c
one	c
of	c
your	c
employes	i
she	c
angrily	c
told	c
me	c
that	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
pay	c
the	c
whole	i
prize	i
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
not	c
only	c
had	c
the	c
actor	c
been	c
changed	c
but	c
also	c
the	c
musical	i
show	c
started	c
forty	i
five	i
minutes	c
late	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

Yet	c
,	c
one	c
extremly	i
hot	c
day	c
while	c
I	c
was	c
pacefully	i
walking	c
by	c
the	c
sea	c
and	c
thinking	c
about	c
my	c
own	c
problems	c
I	i
discovered	c
my	c
elder	c
brother	c
's	c
girlfriend	c
with	c
another	c
boy	c
.	c

At	c
first	c
I	c
felt	c
really	c
annoyed	c
and	c
disappointed	c
so	c
I	c
run	i
to	c
my	c
brother	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
explain	i
him	c
what	c
I	c
had	c
seen	c
.	c

But	c
the	c
thing	c
is	c
I	c
needed	c
to	c
speak	c
to	c
someone	c
about	c
the	i
fact	i
so	c
I	c
could	c
feel	c
more	c
relaxed	c
.	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
you	c
have	c
asked	c
me	c
when	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
attention	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c

With	c
the	c
increasing	i
of	i
violence	c
,	c
more	c
and	c
more	c
people	c
are	c
leaving	c
the	c
streets	c
to	c
spend	c
their	c
free	c
time	c
shopping	c
-	c
usually	c
in	c
shopping	c
centres	c
.	c

But	c
it	c
can	c
also	c
be	c
dangerous	c
.	c

First	c
,	c
most	c
part	i
of	i
shoping	i
centres	c
uses	i
artificial	c
illumination	c
and	c
refiguration	i
,	c
which	c
are	c
bad	c
for	c
our	c
health	c
.	c

Queues	c
and	c
lots	c
of	c
people	c
going	c
round	c
can	c
be	c
stressful	c
and	c
tiring	c
.	c

During	c
my	c
stay	c
in	c
that	c
beautiful	c
city	c
,	c
I	c
thought	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
good	c
idea	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
to	c
enjoy	c
a	c
Musical	c
show	i
,	c
so	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
your	c
theatre	c
to	c
see	c
"	c
over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

Last	c
summer	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
spending	c
my	c
holidays	c
in	c
a	c
little	c
village	c
in	i
the	c
southern	c
cost	i
of	c
Spain	c
with	c
my	c
friend	c
Pat	c
.	c

We	c
usually	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
beach	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
bath	i
and	c
to	c
enjoy	c
the	c
fantastic	c
whether	i
in	c
that	c
part	c
of	c
Spain	c
during	c
the	c
summer	c
.	c

At	i
it	c
was	c
so	c
beautiful	c
,	c
we	c
decided	c
to	c
come	i
back	c
to	c
the	c
beach	c
at	c
night	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
moon	c
,	c
the	c
see	i
and	c
the	c
stars	c
.	c

When	c
we	c
arrived	c
at	c
the	c
beach	c
,	c
we	c
saw	c
a	c
suspicious	c
light	c
and	c
two	c
persons	i
doing	c
something	c
we	c
could	c
n't	c
see	c
very	c
well	c
.	c

As	c
it	c
seemed	c
dangerous	c
we	c
agreed	c
that	c
we	c
should	c
n't	c
tell	i
it	i
to	i
anybody	i
.	c

It	c
was	c
our	c
secret	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
Pat	c
explained	i
the	c
story	c
to	c
a	c
friend	c
of	c
us	i
and	c
I	i
do	c
n't	c
know	c
how	c
,	c
but	c
the	c
robbers	c
knew	c
that	c
we	c
had	c
seen	c
all	c
they	c
had	c
been	c
doing	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
now	c
we	c
are	c
in	c
danger	c
because	c
of	c
that	c
.	c

Firstly	c
In	i
the	c
advertisement	c
you	c
said	c
that	c
the	c
actor	c
would	c
be	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
but	c
there	c
was	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
in	c
the	c
show	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
really	c
disappointed	c
,	i
because	c
I	c
was	c
really	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
seeing	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
which	i
I	c
personally	c
admire	c
.	c

Finally	c
there	c
were	c
no	c
discounts	c
available	c
in	i
the	c
tickets	c
.	c

All	c
the	c
above	c
made	c
my	c
night	c
terribly	c
disappointing	c
and	c
I	c
must	c
say	c
that	c
the	c
advertisement	c
is	c
nothing	c
but	c
a	c
business	c
fraud	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
'm	c
in	c
the	c
unpleasant	c
position	c
to	i
ask	i
my	i
money	c
back	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
your	c
reply	c

It	c
's	c
something	c
absoletuly	i
necessary	c
for	c
every	c
action	c
people	c
does	i
It	i
effects	i
us	c
both	c
positive	i
and	c
negative	i
.	c

My	c
relationship	c
with	c
my	c
family	c
and	c
friends	c
does	c
n't	c
even	c
exist	c
.	c

Also	c
the	c
need	c
of	i
doing	i
simple	c
things	c
as	c
a	c
family	c
is	c
no	c
longer	c
the	i
case	i
.	c

Air	i
conditions	i
,	c
watches	c
,	c
computers	c
,	c
and	c
many	c
other	c
things	c
have	c
made	c
my	c
life	c
easier	c
.	c

In	c
addition	i
technology	i
has	c
made	c
my	c
life	c
easier	c
but	c
it	c
's	c
also	c
an	c
intrude	i
in	c
my	c
life	c
crating	i
a	c
distance	c
between	c
myself	c
and	c
my	c
family	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr.	c
Robertson	c
:	i

So	c
we	c
suggest	c
to	i
put	i
it	i
this	c
way	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
14	c
,	i
in	c
the	c
morning	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
Science	c
Museum	c
and	c
instead	i
of	c
shopping	c
,	c
we	c
could	c
attend	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
show	i
,	c
because	c
will	i
be	c
the	c
latest	c
fashion	i
,	c
leisure	c
and	i
sports	i
wear	i
,	c
make	i
up	i
,	c
and	c
hair	c
styles	c
,	c
and	c
as	c
you	c
know	c
us	i
,	c
we	c
love	c
all	c
those	c
topics	c
,	c
and	c
it	c
's	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
while	c
we	c
are	c
London	i
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
time	c
,	i
and	i
We	c
're	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
your	i
opion	i
.	c

faithfully	i
yours	i

I	c
arrived	c
in	c
Paris	c
for	i
New	c
Years	i
Eve	c
2000	c
without	c
a	c
place	c
to	c
stay	c
,	c
not	c
speaking	c
any	c
French	c
,	c
alone	c
and	c
with	c
a	c
little	i
amount	c
of	c
money	c
.	c

But	c
eventhough	i
all	c
of	c
these	c
desadventages	i
above	i
,	c
I	c
was	c
folling	i
my	c
dreams	c
and	c
objectives	c
and	c
inspite	i
of	c
everything	c
I	c
was	c
going	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
.	c

So	c
suddenly	c
,	c
a	c
week	c
later	c
I	c
found	c
me	i
a	c
job	c
as	c
an	c
au	c
pair	c
,	c
taking	c
care	c
of	c
two	c
little	c
girls	c
that	c
only	c
spoke	c
french	i
at	c
that	c
moment	i
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
a	c
foreign	c
student	c
who	c
is	c
on	c
holidays	i
here	c
.	c

The	i
last	i
Monday	c
,	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
with	c
two	c
friends	c
.	c

We	c
arrived	c
on	c
time	c
but	c
the	c
musical	i
show	c
was	c
delayed	c
untill	i
half-pass	i
eight	c
.	c

On	i
the	i
other	i
hand	i
,	c
the	c
main	c
actor	c
was	c
changed	c
for	c
another	c
and	c
nobody	c
told	c
us	c
.	c

Well	c
I	c
believe	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
bad	c
day	c
but	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
you	c
to	c
give	c
my	i
money	c
back	c
because	c
on	i
the	c
advertisement	c
there	c
was	i
some	c
things	c
that	c
we	c
had	i
n't	i
in	i
the	c
theatre	c
.	c

Yous	i
sincerelly	i
,	c

Our	c
lives	c
are	c
changing	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
child	c
I	c
had	c
different	c
entertainments	i
that	i
the	i
actually	i
children	c
had	i
n't	i
.	c

The	c
technology	c
is	c
growing	c
and	c
growing	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
have	c
a	c
computer	c
you	c
will	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
have	c
all	c
the	c
information	c
that	c
you	c
want	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
very	c
important	c
but	c
some	i
times	i
it	c
is	c
a	c
wrong	i
thing	c
because	c
the	c
children	c
can	c
see	c
it	c
too	c
.	c

Moreover	c
you	c
can	c
change	c
the	c
TV	c
programme	c
without	c
getting	c
up	c
.	c

Actually	c
,	c
we	c
can	c
cure	c
illness	i
which	c
were	c
very	i
dangerous	i
before	i
.	c

I	c
was	c
one	c
of	c
your	c
customers	c
who	c
had	c
a	c
very	c
disappointing	c
about	i
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
show	i
at	c
your	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
yesterday	c
.	c

But	c
your	c
starrings	i
were	c
not	c
.	i

It	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
and	c
that	c
waisted	i
my	c
time	c
and	c
made	c
me	c
feel	c
bad	c
about	c
your	c
service	i
.	c

And	c
finally	c
,	c
your	c
restaurant	c
was	c
not	c
available	i
after	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

From	i
every	i
singular	i
things	i
I	i
have	i
complained	i
,	i
it	i
was	c
totally	c
different	c
from	c
what	c
your	c
advertisment	i
said	c
.	c

And	c
because	c
of	c
this	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
for	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
see	i
that	i
this	i
is	i
a	i
good	i
reason	i
,	c
please	c
telephone	c
me	c
.	c

Indeed	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
save	c
more	c
money	c
for	i
upgrading	i
my	c
personal	c
computer	c
.	c

Computer	c
technology	c
keeps	c
improving	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
and	c
consumes	i
like	c
me	i
and	i
you	i
definitely	c
have	c
to	c
pay	i
our	c
money	c
to	c
keep	c
our	c
personal	c
computer	c
up	c
to	c
date	c
and	c
able	i
to	i
work	i
with	c
new	i
computer	c
softwares	i
that	c
require	i
more	c
and	c
more	c
performance	i
of	i
computer	i
hardware	i
.	c

Using	c
the	c
internet	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
search	i
for	i
almost	c
all	c
information	i
I	c
want	c
to	c
know	i
.	c

And	c
I	c
can	c
send	c
e-mail	c
to	c
my	c
friends	c
via	c
the	c
Internet	c
fastly	i
and	c
cheaply	c
prepared	i
to	c
the	c
old-style	c
mail-services	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
modern	c
technology	c
makes	i
me	c
do	c
my	c
business	c
faster	c
,	c
smarter	i
with	i
much	c
more	c
efficiency	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
you	i
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
disappointing	c
expirience	i
I	c
had	c
with	c
your	c
theatre	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
have	i
a	c
discount	c
but	c
there	c
were	c
no	c
discounts	c
,	c
although	c
the	c
advertisement	c
said	c
there	c
are	c
.	c

Thirdly	c
,	c
the	c
disappointment	c
made	c
me	c
a	c
bit	c
hungry	c
but	c
the	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
without	c
any	c
sign	c
saying	c
why	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
not	c
good	c
at	c
all	c
and	c
my	c
evening	c
was	c
spoiled	c
in	c

Dear	c
Mr.	c
Robertson	c
,	c

It	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
to	c
visit	c
because	i
it	c
is	c
shown	i
only	c
twice	c
a	c
year	c
and	c
the	i
entrance	c
is	c
free	c
for	c
students	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
most	c
of	c
us	c
are	c
designers	c
so	c
this	c
might	c
help	c
to	c
up-dated	i
their	i
knowledge	c
as	c
well	c
.	c

Therefore	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
suggest	c
that	c
on	c
Monday	c
13	c
and	c
Wednesday	c
14	c
of	c
March	c
,	c
we	c
still	c
stick	c
with	c
your	c
plan	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
appreciate	c
if	i
the	c
matter	c
can	i
be	c
settled	c
down	i
easily	c
and	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

One	c
of	c
my	c
friend	i
came	c
up	c
with	c
the	c
idea	c
that	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
steal	c
them	c
.	c

The	c
question	c
was	c
who	c
would	c
be	c
the	c
person	c
do	i
this	c
action	c
so	c
we	c
tossed	c
a	c
coin	c
,	c
and	c
the	c
result	c
was	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
so	c
scare	i
and	c
frighten	i
because	c
if	c
I	c
was	c
caught	c
I	c
would	c
be	c
punished	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
otherwise	c
my	c
friend	i
would	c
call	c
me	c
a	c
chicken	c
and	c
they	c
dared	c
me	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
that	c
afternoon	c
in	i
lunch	i
time	i
,	c
I	c
went	c
into	c
the	c
teachers	c
'	c
room	c
and	c
opened	c
her	c
desk	c
and	c
took	c
the	c
paper	c
out	c
quitely	i
and	c
calmly	c
.	c

That	c
was	c
the	c
most	c
scarely	i
and	c
daring	c
thing	c
that	c
I	c
did	c
in	c
my	c
childhood	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr.	c
Smith	c
,	c

First	c
you	c
have	c
written	c
that	c
the	c
starring	i
were	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
,	c
but	c
the	c
real	i
actors	c
were	c
different	c
.	c

Over	i
these	i
the	i
tickets	i
were	i
not	i
discount	i
available	c
as	c
you	c
have	i
written	c
in	i
your	c
advertisement	c
.	c

Sencerely	i
.	c

One	c
day	c
she	c
had	c
to	c
make	i
the	c
shopping	c
for	c
her	c
mother	c
.	c

After	c
she	c
had	c
done	c
this	c
she	c
went	c
home	c
,	c
but	c
she	c
did	c
n't	c
buy	c
the	c
ticket	c
because	c
she	c
thought	c
there	c
are	i
n't	i
no	i
change	i
to	i
win	i
.	c

She	c
spent	c
this	i
only	i
for	i
a	c
magazin	i
.	c

Sara	c
was	c
out	c
of	c
breath	c
and	c
after	c
she	i
had	i
told	i
her	c
mother	c
,	i
she	c
had	c
n't	c
bought	c
the	c
ticket	c
.	c

Her	c
mother	c
get	i
angry	c
but	c
some	c
hours	c
later	c
she	c
was	c
friendly	c
again	c
.	c

Dear	c
Ms	c
J.	c
Clark	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
to	c
thank	c
for	i
so	i
good	c
organisation	c
of	c
International	i
Arts	c
Festival	c
,	c
where	c
I	i
'd	i
spent	i
two	c
exellent	i
days	c
recently	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
inform	c
you	c
whed	i
the	c
idea	c
was	c
great	c
and	c
I	c
hope	c
that	c
so	i
needful	i
for	i
people	i
events	i
would	i
become	i
a	c
good	c
tradition	c
in	c
our	c
country	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
hope	c
that	c
next	c
year	c
visitores	i
of	i
festival	i
would	i
be	i
able	c
to	c
introduce	i
with	i
more	c
art	c
groups	c
from	c
all	c
over	c
the	c
world	c
.	c

Finishing	i
my	c
letter	c
,	c
I	c
hope	c
what	i
my	c
notes	c
could	i
help	c
you	c
to	c
make	c
next-year	i
festival	c
more	c
intersting	i
and	c
comfortable	c
for	c
public	i

Earn	c
yourself	i
.	c

But	c
then	i
you	c
are	c
at	c
the	i
university	c
you	c
need	c
money	c
more	c
,	i
then	i
anybody	i
else	i
want	i
.	c

All	c
that	i
discos	c
,	c
concerts	c
,	c
touristic	i
trips	c
have	c
to	c
be	c
paid	c
by	i
a	i
different	c
sum	i
of	c
those	c
small	c
coloured	c
pieces	c
of	c
paper	c
,	i
called	c
money	c

I	c
think	c
the	c
festival	c
was	c
fine	c
but	c
in	c
my	c
opinion	c
there	c
must	i
be	c
some	c
improvements	c
to	c
make	c
this	c
festival	c
better	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
there	c
were	c
stars	c
and	c
artists	c
only	i
from	i
six	c
countries	c
.	c

Also	c
some	c
concerts	i
holls	i
were	c
too	c
small	c
for	c
this	c
much	i
people	c
.	c

In	c
contrast	c
with	c
the	c
halls	c
,	c
the	c
concerts	c
were	c
great	c
and	c
I	c
saw	c
everybody	c
enjoyed	c
then	c
.	c

I	c
must	c
admit	c
that	c
you	c
are	i
very	c
successful	c
about	i
finding	c
good	c
stars	c
.	c

Another	c
paht	i
is	c
the	c
tickets	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
was	c
disappointed	c
that	c
there	c
were	i
no	c
competition	c
between	c
the	c
films	c
performed	i
I	i
think	c
there	c
should	c
be	c
an	c
Oscar-like	c
competition	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
make	c
people	c
more	c
ambitious	c
to	c
make	c
better	c
films	c
.	c

I	c
promise	c
I	c
'll	c
write	c
more	c

How	c
poor	c
their	c
imagination	i
are	c
!	c
!	c

Nobody	c
likes	c
to	c
study	c
but	c
we	c
have	c
to	c

You	c
ca	c
n't	c
imagine	c
how	c
happy	c
I	c
am	c
and	c
I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c

I	c
want	c
to	c
have	c
at	c
least	c
half	c
of	c
my	c
money	c
back	c

How	c
has	c
modern	c
technology	c
Changed	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
?	c

The	c
advantages	i
with	i
internet	i
are	i
that	c
I	c
can	c
do	c
all	c
my	c
shopping	c
from	i
internet	i
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
to	c
stress	i
around	c
in	c
the	c
supermarket	c
a	i
friday	i
evening	c
,	c
when	c
I	c
'm	c
tired	c
from	c
school	c
,	c
I	c
just	c
get	c
all	c
the	c
groseries	i
I	c
need	c
delivered	c
to	c
my	c
door	c

I	c
buy	c
all	c
my	c
clothes	c
on	c
internet	i
as	c
well	c
and	c
it	c
works	c
brilliant	i
,	c
but	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
admit	c
that	c
there	c
are	c
some	c
disadvantages	c
with	c
internet	i
too	c
.	c

Nowdays	i
I	c
spend	c
2	c
hours	c
intent	i
of	c
the	c
computer	c
every	c
day	c
,	c
shopping	c
or	c
chatting	c
to	c
people	c

I	c
'll	c
go	c
to	c
Japan	c
next	c
month	c
to	c
visit	c
one	c
of	c
my	c
internetfriends	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
glad	c
that	c
all	c
accommodation	c
and	c
travel	c
costs	c
are	c
paid	c
,	c
but	c
even	i
though	i
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
do	i
I	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
with	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
be	i
glad	i
to	c
travel	c
only	c
in	c
July	c
because	i
of	i
family	c
reasons	c
.	c

Also	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
which	c
activities	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
chose	i
and	c
why	c
.	c

I	c
like	c
swimming	c
and	c
photography	c
because	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
very	c
interesting	c
to	c
improve	c
my	c
skills	c
at	c
both	c
activities	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c

Going	c
in	c

out	c
of	c
the	c
shops	c

buying	c
clothes	c

but	c
a	i
few	c
of	c
us	c
who	i
is	i
very	c
happy	c
to	c
spend	c
money	c

So	c

let	c
's	c
imagen	i
that	c
your	c

some	c

We	c
will	c
say	c
unlucky	i

no	c
one	c
will	c
help	c
you	c
in	c
that	c

Staying	c

I	c
am	c

to	c
you	c
so	c
as	c
to	c
express	c
my	c
great	c
disappointment	c
about	c

Musical	c

Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
,	c
"	c
I	i
attended	c
to	i
,	i
a	c
fortnight	c
ago	c
.	c

To	c
begin	c
with	c
,	c
never	c
have	c
I	c
been	c
so	c
upset	c
when	i
I	c
realized	c
that	c
the	i
expected	i
famous	i
actor	i
Danny	i
Brook	c
,	c
did	i
not	c
show	c
up	c
at	c
the	c
performance	c
and	c
that	c
he	c
had	c
been	c
shamefully	c
replaced	c
by	c
an	c
unknown	c
actor	c
whose	c
performance	c
was	c
,	i
quite	c
mediocre	c

A	c
Perfect	c

Not	c

all	c

I	c
had	c
made	i
my	c
own	c
experience	c
with	c

far	i

I	c
would	c

always	i
careful	c
not	c
to	c
tell	c
her	c
anything	c
important	c

on	i
the	c
letter	c
.	c

First	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
university	c
student	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
only	c
one	c
month	c
summer	i
vacation	c

For	c

years	c
old	c

My	c
second	c
choise	i

However	c

I	c
could	c
enjoy	c
it	c
,	c
even	c
though	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
biginner	i
,	c
so	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
practice	i
and	c
have	c
fun	c
at	c
the	c
camp	c
.	c

Lastly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c

whether	c
I	c

money	c
and	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
should	c

Dear	c

Thank	c
you	c

So	c
he	c
suggested	c
me	c
to	c
help	c
their	i
concert	c
so	c
that	c
I	c
could	c
know	c
behind	c
the	c
scenes	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
was	c
doing	c
it	c
,	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
staff	c
called	c
me	c
and	c
brought	i
me	c
to	c
a	c
room	c
.	c

He	c
explained	c
me	i
that	c
it	c
was	c
to	c
controll	i
the	c
light	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
fun	c
practicing	i
how	c
to	c
move	c
the	c
lights	c
and	c
change	c
the	c
lights	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
when	c
it	c
came	c
to	c
the	c
real	c
concert	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
very	c
hard	c
.	c

I	i
'll	i
write	i
you	i
back	i

I	c
'm	c
happy	c
I	c
can	c
join	c
you	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
in	c
the	c
U.S.A	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
sorry	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
I	c
can	c
attend	c
your	c
camp	c
only	c
on	i
July	c
because	c
I	c
just	c
started	c
my	c
new	c

and	c
I	c
got	i
one	c
month	c
of	c
my	i

I	c
'll	c
be	c
very	c
happy	c
when	i

can	c
give	c
me	c
a	c
chance	c
to	c
use	c
the	c
camp	c
's	c

studio	c
and	c
you	c
'll	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
prepare	c
some	c
paiting	i
's	i
materials	c
like	c
oil	c
paints	c
canvas	i
and	c
bruches	i
for	c
me	c
.	c

Could	c
you	c
write	c
to	c
me	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
need	c
and	c
what	c
type	c

Dear	c
Kim	c

I	c
had	c
the	c
chance	c
to	c

the	c
concert	c
.	c

You	c
ca	c
n't	c
imagine	c
how	c
happy	c
I	c
was	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
the	c
result	c
of	c
that	c
action	c
was	c
marvelous	i
.	c

In	c
front	c
of	c
the	c
stage	c
I	c
put	c
the	c
grass	c
and	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
flowers	c
.	c

After	c
that	c
I	c
prepared	c
the	c
group	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
happy	c
because	c
on	i
this	c
time	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
chance	c
talking	i
to	c
them	c
and	c
to	c
know	i
more	c
about	c
them	c
.	c

I	c
told	c
them	c
you	c
are	c
full	c
of	c
live	i
and	c
they	c
are	c
yours	i
favourite	c
polish	i
group	c

We	c
'll	c

when	c
I	c
come	c
to	c
see	c
you	c

A	c
lot	c
of	c
kisses	c

I	c
spent	c
two	c
days	c
there	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
was	c
the	c
best	c
Arts	c
Festival	c
I	c
have	c
ever	c
been	c
at	i

My	c
suggestion	c
for	c
next	c

Dear	c

your	c
last	c
letter	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
pleased	c

We	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
to	c
wear	c
any	c
special	c
uniforms	c
on	i
signs	i
of	c
our	c
school	c

We	c

At	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
many	c
rules	c
either	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
think	c
there	c
is	c
anything	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
change	c

Your	i

I	c
am	c
writing	c
with	c
reference	c
to	c
your	c
letter	c
,	c
which	c
I	c
have	c
just	c
received	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
happy	c
to	c
hear	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
.	c

As	c
I	c
only	c
have	c
holidays	c
on	i
July	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
on	i
this	c
month	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
have	i
accommodation	i
in	c
log	i
cabins	i
because	c
I	c
like	c
to	c
be	c
comfortable	c
and	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
like	c
to	c
be	i
lied	i
down	c
on	c
the	c
floor	c
inside	c
a	c
tent	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
I	c
am	c
very	i
fast	c
swimming	i
but	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
good	c
style	c
and	i
technic	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
be	c
grateful	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
send	c
me	c
more	c
information	c
about	c
what	c
clothes	c
and	c
money	c
I	c
must	c
take	c
.	c

On	c
my	c
first	c
day	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
work	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
next	c
day	c
I	c
helped	c
them	c
to	c
built	i
the	c
scenary	i
and	c
I	c
had	c
enough	c
time	c
to	c
visit	c
a	c
museum	c
in	c
Dublin	c
in	c
the	c
evening	c
.	c

On	c
my	c
third	c
day	c
I	c
helped	c
them	c
to	c
install	c
the	c
sound	c
system	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
speak	c
to	c
my	c
favourite	c
singer	c
'	c
Bono	c
'	c
,	i
I	c
could	c
meet	c
him	c
and	c
I	c
helped	c
him	c
to	c
repair	c
his	c
guitar	c
because	c
it	c
did	c
n't	c
sound	c
very	c
well	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
express	c
my	c
disappointment	c
about	i
your	c
musical	c
show	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
delayed	c
forty-five	c
minutes	c
and	c
the	c
worst	c
of	c
all	c
was	c
that	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
had	c
been	c
replaced	c
by	c
another	c
actor	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
some	c
kind	c
of	c
explanation	c
and	c
receive	i
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

There	c
was	c
only	c
a	i
person	c
who	c
used	c
to	c
call	c
her	c
by	c
this	c
name	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
long	c
time	c
ago	c
,	c
when	c
she	c
was	c
fourteen	c
and	c
Paul	c
sixteen	c
.	c

He	c
was	c
her	c
first	c
love	c
and	c
also	c
the	c
first	c
who	c
kissed	c
her	c
.	c

When	c
they	c
were	c
saying	c
goodbye	c
Paul	c
"	i
I	c
will	c
be	c
the	c
last	c
person	c
who	c
will	c
kiss	c
you	c
"	c
.	c

"	c
You	c
only	c
have	c
to	c
wait	c
"	i
he	c
said	c
.	c

But	c
she	c
did	c
n't	c
wait	c
.	c

She	c
got	c
married	c
and	c
had	c
two	c
children	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c

before	i

not	i

will	c
be	c
on	c

In	c
order	c
to	c
know	c
what	c
sort	c
of	c
the	i
clothes	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
,	c
please	c

especially	c
of	i
the	c

When	c

your	c

"	c
Evening	c

we	c
made	c
a	c

the	c
next	c
evening	c
,	c
one	c
hour	c
before	c
the	c
beginning	c
of	c
the	c

we	c
learnt	c
that	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

I	c
was	c
at	c
the	c
show	c
of	i
your	c
theatre	c
three	c
days	c
ago	c
.	c

No	c
discounts	c
were	c
given	c
and	c
,	c
what	c
is	c
more	c
,	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
all	i
the	i
time	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
whole	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
disappointed	c
having	i
left	i
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
.	c

All	i
the	i
impressions	i
were	i
destroyed	i
by	i
many	i
problems	i
.	c

I	c
ask	c
you	c
for	i
returning	i
my	c
money	c
back	i
.	c

Or	c
I	c
will	c
have	c
nothing	i
to	i
do	i
except	c
for	i
going	i
to	c
the	i
court	c
.	c

Faithfully	c
,	c

Three	c
hundred	c
years	c

one	i

in	i
each	i

One	c
hundred	c
years	c
ago	c
it	c
was	c
one	i
time	i
in	c
50-25	c
years	c
.	c

And	c
now	c
we	c
have	c
to	c
change	c
some	c
of	c
our	c
clothes	c
every	c
6	c
months	c
because	c
they	c
are	c
not	c
so	c
fashionable	c
any	c
more	c
.	c

With	c
no	c

,	c
the	c

be	c
great	c

Secondly	c
,	c
for	c
me	c
,	c
the	c
best	c
way	c
to	c
live	c
in	c
outdoor	i
is	c
in	c
tents	c
,	c
because	c
that	c
will	i
be	i
a	c
good	c
chance	c
to	c
learn	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
knowledge	c
about	c
planets	i
and	c
animals	i
as	c
well	c

Moreover	c
,	c
I	c
am	c

Dear	c
Kim	c

How	c
are	c
you	c
?	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
I	c
help	i
them	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
going	c
to	c
markets	c
to	i
schools	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
giving	c
information	i
when	i
and	c
where	c
the	c
group	c
was	c
going	c
to	c
appear	c
as	c
well	c
as	c
where	c
can	i
they	i
buy	c
or	c
book	c
a	c
ticket	c
for	c
this	c
concert	c
.	c

I	c
know	c
,	i
It	i
was	c
difficult	c
and	c
tired	i
but	c
I	c
enjoyed	c
a	i
lot	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
good	c
break	c
from	c
the	c
routine	i
.	c

Because	c
I	c
did	i
it	c
for	c
first	i
time	c
.	c

Because	c
I	c
believed	c
that	c
this	c
was	c
a	c
result	c
which	c
came	c
with	i
my	c
help	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
do	c
again	i
it	i
in	c
the	c
future	c
.	c

Best	c
wishes	c

I	c
will	c
be	c
having	c
my	c
exams	c
durind	i
this	c
month	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
travel	c
before	c
July	c
.	c

Also	c
I	c
'm	c
going	c
to	c
meet	c
a	c
director	c
of	c
Smith'th	c
Travel	c
Agency	c
for	c
interview	i
concerning	c
possible	c
work	c
with	c
English-speaking	c
tourists	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
just	c
wonderful	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
spare	c
time	c
I	c
like	c
to	c
play	c
basketball	c
for	c
a	c
local	c
team	c
of	c
which	c
I	c
have	c
recently	c
been	c
made	c
captain	c
.	c

Could	c
you	c
please	c
let	c
me	c
know	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
weather	c
will	i
be	i
there	i
in	c
July	c
,	c
what	c
sorts	c
of	c
clothing	c
I	c
'd	c
better	c
take	c
with	c
me	c
.	c

Is	c
there	c
an	c
extra	c
charge	c
for	c
some	c
trips	c

might	c

However	c

I	c
suggest	c
to	i
increase	i
the	c
number	c
of	c
them	c

because	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
more	c
exiting	i

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
have	c
just	c
received	c
your	c
letter	c
where	c
you	c
inform	c
me	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
the	c
competition	c
and	c
now	c
,	i
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
express	c
my	c
opinion	c
about	c
the	c
questions	c
you	c
have	c
written	c
on	i
it	c
.	c

The	c
other	c
one	c
I	c
have	c
choosen	i
is	c
swimming	c
;	c
for	c
the	c
same	c
reason	c
why	c
I	c
chose	c
Basketball	i
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
now	c
.	c

For	c
exemple	i
,	c
if	c
the	c
shop	c
is	c
full	c
of	c
people	c
,	c
is	i
not	c
enjoyable	c
,	c
because	c
they	c
will	c
create	c
too	c
confusion	i
,	c
too	c
noise	i
with	i
the	i
risk	i
of	i
leaving	i
time	c
.	c

I	c
saw	c
your	c
advertisement	c
and	c
I	c
expected	c
a	c
discounted	c
ticket	c
for	c
students	c
.	c

The	c
play	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
start	c
at	c
19.30	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
delayed	c
so	i
at	c
20.15	c
a	i
curtain	c
of	c
the	c
stage	c
was	c
pulled	i
up	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
a	c
big	c
fan	c
of	c
Danny	c
Book	c
and	c
it	i
was	c
why	c
I	c
chose	c
'	c
over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
'	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
saw	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
playing	c
his	c
role	c
I	c
was	c
really	c
disappointed	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
booked	c
the	c
ticket	c
I	c
really	c
expected	i
the	c
show	c
.	c

Unlike	c
my	c
expectation	c
it	c
was	c
so	c
disappointing	c
and	c
annoying	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

I	c
remember	c
some	c
sientific	i
cartoons	i
when	i
I	i
was	i
younger	i
I	i
watched	i
on	i
television	i
.	c

Modern	c
technology	c
has	c
been	c
changing	c
even	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
in	c
positive	c
and	c
negative	c
ways	c
at	c
the	c
same	c
time	c
.	c

If	c
there	c
was	c
no	c
public	c
transport	c
like	c
underground	i
in	c
a	c
big	c
city	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
imagine	c
travelling	c
on	c
time	c
.	c

Another	c
problem	c
is	c
pollution	c
.	c

The	c
more	c
cars	c
there	c
are	c
on	c
the	c
street	c
,	c
the	c
more	c
difficult	c
it	c
is	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
keep	c
myself	c
fit	c
.	c

Dear	c
Ms	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
was	c
so	c
surprised	c
and	c
delighted	c
as	c
well	c
receiving	i
from	c
you	c
such	c
wonderful	c
news	c
!	c

Thanks	i
the	i
God	i
,	c
you	c
did	i
me	c
really	c
happy	c
.	c

From	c
your	c
letter	c
I	c
was	c
pleased	c
to	c
know	i
that	c
all	c
accommodation	c
and	c
travel	c
costs	c
are	c
paid	c
for	c
.	c

But	c
could	c
you	c
,	c
please	c
,	c
let	c
me	c
have	c
more	c
details	c
about	c
my	c
award	i
.	c

What	c
kind	c
of	c
people	c
will	c
be	c
invited	c
at	i
your	c
Camp	c
in	i
this	c
summer	c
?	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
with	c
whome	i
I	c
'll	c
share	c
sach	i
a	i
wonderful	c
days	c
with	i
the	i
sport	i
activities	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
glad	c
to	c
swimming	i
and	c
sailing	c
for	c
some	i
weeks	c
.	c

And	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
nice	c
audience	c
for	c
my	c
poetry	c
as	c
well	c
,	i
I	c
'm	c
a	c
poet	c
,	c
yeas	i
.	c

What	i
about	i
another	i
camp	c
conditions	c
-	c
it	c
does	c
not	c
matter	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

I	c
hope	c
so	c
!	c

It	c
was	c
true	c
.	c

I	c
found	c
the	c
kind	c
of	c
activity	c
what	i
I	c
looking	i
for	c
four	i
ages	c
.	c

The	c
hall	c
was	c
crowded	c
.	c

His	c
one-week	c
concert	c
programme	c
was	c
so	c
succsessful	i
that	c
we	c
decided	c
to	c
invite	c
him	c
else	i
,	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
tickets	i
would	i
be	i
sold	i
.	c

Do	c
you	c
share	c
my	c
idea	i
,	c
Kim	c
?	c

Is	i
not	i
it	c
a	c
brilliant	c
idea	c
?	c

Good	c
luck	c
to	c
you	c
as	c
well	c
!	c

The	c
two	c
activities	c
that	c
I	c
prefer	c
will	i
be	i
Basketball	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
had	i
the	i
experience	i
to	i
play	i
in	c
my	c
school	c
's	c
big	i
for	c
almoust	i
a	c
year	c
,	c
and	c
Photography	c
,	c
which	c
is	c
a	c
hobby	c
that	c
I	c
am	c
good	c
at	c
and	c
I	c
practice	i
since	c
I	c
was	c
ten	c
.	c

On	c
top	c
of	c
everything	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
should	i
I	i
take	c
,	c
and	c
which	i
type	c
of	c
clothes	c
are	c
the	c
best	c
to	c
wear	c
in	c
the	c
competition	c
.	c

Elisa	c
F	c
.	c

People	c
are	c
used	c
to	c
go	i
to	c
the	c
shopping	i
because	c
it	c
is	c
easier	i
and	c
familiare	i
,	i
it	i
is	c
one	c
place	c
where	c
you	c
can	c
have	c
lunch	c
or	c
dinner	c
,	c
watch	c
some	i
movie	c
after	c
that	c
,	c
and	c
if	i
you	c
want	c
buy	i
something	c
at	c
the	c
shops	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
why	c
do	c
n't	c
we	c
try	c
to	c
change	c
our	c
customs	i
and	c
start	c
to	c
do	c
knew	i
things	c
to	c
enjoy	c
ourselves	c
.	c

There	c
were	c
many	c
things	c
that	c
were	c
wrong	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
I	c
saw	c
.	c

So	c
when	c
I	c
saw	c
the	c
show	c
I	c
felt	c
horrible	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
was	c
expecting	c
to	c
see	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
.	c

Please	c
be	c
comprehensive	i
and	c
realize	c
that	c
your	c
show	c
was	c
not	c
cheap	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
to	c
see	c
you	c
there	c
.	c

Everybody	c
knew	c
that	c
Caroline	c
and	c
her	c
boyfriend	c
John	c
,	i
loved	c
each	c
other	c
so	c
much	c
that	c
it	c
would	c
n't	c
be	c
rare	i
to	c
find	c
that	c
they	c
had	c
have	i
sex	c
together	i
.	c

The	c
point	c
here	c
is	c
,	i
that	c
Caroline	c
choosed	i
the	c
worst	c
friend	c
to	c
told	i
this	c
.	i

He	c
could	c
n't	c
belived	i
what	c
Pat	c
had	c
told	c
him	c
,	c
so	c
he	c
broke	c
Pat	c
's	c
nose	c
.	c

Pat	c
's	c
father	c
had	c
to	c
pay	c
a	i
very	c
expensive	c
operation	c
.	c

But	c
as	i
every	c
story	c
this	c
has	c
a	c
happy	c
final	i
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
,	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
the	c
programme	c
you	c
have	c
organised	c
.	c

The	c
students	c
in	c
my	c
class	c
have	c
seen	c
an	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
,	c
we	i
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
if	c
is	i
possible	c
to	c
make	c
some	c
changes	c
in	i
the	c
programme	c
?	i

Would	c
it	c
be	c
possible	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
Museum	c
and	c
then	c
for	i
the	i
shopping	c
in	c
our	c
free	c
time	c
which	i
is	c
on	c
Wednesday	c
?	c

your	i
sincerly	i

I	c
think	c
for	c
all	c
of	c
us	c
home	c
is	c
something	c
which	c
is	c
a	i
very	c
important	c
.	c

We	c
call	c
home	c
the	c
place	c
where	c
we	c
live	c
or	c
the	c
country	c
where	c
we	c
come	c
frome	i
.	c

I	c
think	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
home	c
might	c
be	c
just	c
the	c
place	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
sleep	c
.	c

We	c
even	i
do	i
n't	i
spend	c
time	c
with	c
families	i
.	c

Propably	i
in	c
the	c
future	c
we	c
might	i
be	c
to	i
busy	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
our	c
own	c
home	c
and	c
spend	c
some	c
time	c
there	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
glad	c
to	c
be	c
informed	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
now	c
writting	i
this	c
letter	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
further	c
information	c
about	c
myself	c
with	i
pleasure	i
.	c

Since	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
full-time	c
student	c
,	c
I	c
will	c
not	c
have	c
finished	c
my	c
lessons	c
until	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
June	c
.	c

Regarding	c
to	i
the	c
accomodation	i
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
tents	c
because	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
closer	c
to	c
the	i
nature	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
sure	c
I	c
will	c
have	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
fun	c
and	c
release	c
myself	c
from	c
the	i
busy	i
study	i
totally	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
I	c
started	c
to	c
play	c
tennis	c
at	c
the	c
age	c
of	c
six	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
choose	i
these	c
two	c
activities	c
while	c
I	c
am	c
at	c
the	c
Camp	c
.	c

Since	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
been	c
to	c
U.S.A	i
,	c
I	c
know	c
nothing	c
about	c
it	c
.	c

Would	c
you	c
like	c
to	c
tell	c
me	c
how	c
much	c
should	i
be	i
taken	i
with	c
me	c
as	c
pocket	c
money	c
and	c
what	c
shall	i
I	c
wear	c
at	c
that	c
time	c
?	i

In	c
some	c
peoples	i
'	i
opinion	c
,	c
shopping	c
and	c
spending	c
money	c
is	c
a	c
kind	c
of	c
fun	i
and	c
they	c
can	c
even	c
get	c
self-satisfaction	i
from	c
it	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
view	c
,	c
the	c
answer	c
is	c
,	c
NO	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
since	c
more	c
and	c
more	c
people	c
go	c
shopping	c
,	c
shops	c
are	c
always	c
so	c
crowded	c
,	c
especially	c
the	c
popular	c
ones	c
.	c

After	c
a	c
week	c
,	c
she	c
had	c
got	c
enough	c
money	c
and	c
rushed	c
to	c
that	c
shop	c
.	c

More	c
and	c
more	c
people	c
find	c
that	c
there	c
are	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
nicer	c
things	c
they	c
can	c
do	c
rather	c
than	c
shopping	c
.	c

Helen	c
Ryan	c

Competition	c
Organizer	c

I	c
entered	c
the	c
competition	c
you	c
organized	c
but	c
never	c
expected	c
to	c
be	c
the	c
lucky	c
winner	c
.	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c

Most	c
of	c
us	c
would	c
agree	c
on	c
that	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
who	c
has	c
the	c
freedom	c
to	c
buy	c
with	i
an	i
unlimited	i
budget	i
whatever	i
they	i
need	i
?	c

With	c
more	c
free	c
time	c
and	c
more	c
money	c
to	c
spend	c
than	c
ever	c
,	c
shopping	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
activity	c
,	c
but	c
when	c
this	c
creates	c
bad	c
habits	c
as	i
overspending	c
,	c
could	i
lead	c
to	c
serious	c
problems	c
.	c

But	c
even	c
without	c
money	c
to	c
spend	c
is	i
fun	c
to	c
rush	c
from	c
time	c
to	c
time	c
in	i
the	c
sales	c
that	c
seasonaly	i
appear	c
,	c
or	c
simply	c
look	c
at	c
the	c
superb	c
displays	c
that	c
shops	c
have	c
in	c
their	c
showrooms	c
.	c

Shopping	c
may	c
be	c
enjoyable	c
or	c
not	c
at	c
all	c
!	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

Secondly	c
,	c
from	c
the	c
list	c
of	c
activities	c
that	c
you	c
are	i
also	i
state	i
in	c
the	c
letter	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
swimming	c
because	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
child	c
I	c
practised	i
this	c
sport	c
for	c
8	c
years	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
it	i
would	c
be	c
grateful	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
clarify	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
must	c
be	i
taken	i
and	c
how	c
much	c
I	c
will	c
spend	c
during	c
the	c
stay	c
at	c
the	c
Camp	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

I	c
'm	c
sorry	c
I	c
have	c
n't	c
written	c
for	c
so	c
long	c
but	c
as	c
you	c
can	c
imagine	c
I	c
've	c
been	c
pretty	c
busy	c
with	c
my	c
studies	c
.	c

Jane	c
's	c
grandfather	c
was	c
the	c
organiser	c
of	c
the	c
pop	c
concert	c
and	c
Jane	c
had	c
invited	c
me	c
to	c
help	c
in	i
the	c
event	c
.	c

I	c
helped	c
with	c
the	c
lights	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
in	c
charge	c
of	c
the	c
food	c
and	c
drinks	i
.	c

You	c
know	c
he	c
is	c
my	c
love	c
!	c

I	c
enjoyed	c
very	i
much	c
.	c

I	c
only	c
have	c
two	c
months	c
of	c
vacation	c
that	i
are	i
July	c
and	c
August	c
and	c
since	c
I	c
must	c
visit	c
my	c
grandparents	c
in	c
August	c
,	c
the	c
only	c
time	c
possible	c
is	c
July	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
a	c
tent	c
rather	c
than	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
told	c
that	c
the	c
Californiai	i
summer	c
is	c
hot	c
and	c
dry	c
so	c
because	i
a	c
tent	c
's	c
wind	c
circulation	c
is	c
better	c
,	c
it	c
would	c
create	c
a	c
confortable	i
coolness	c
.	c

The	c
two	c
activities	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
do	c
are	c
basketball	c
and	c
surfing	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
played	c
basketball	c
during	i
5	c
years	c
in	c
an	c
amateur	c
franchise	i
and	c
still	c
play	c
on	c
a	c
playground	c
regularly	c
so	c
my	c
skills	c
are	c
good	c
.	c

Do	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
bring	c
particular	i
clothing	c
like	i
a	c
surfing	i
suit	i
,	c
for	c
instance	c
?	c

Best	c
Regards	c

You	c
often	c
enter	c
a	c
shop	c
and	c
see	c
people	c
everywhere	c
so	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
squeeze	c
yourself	c
through	c
the	c
alleys	i
to	c
take	c
a	c
look	c
at	c
a	c
product	c
.	c

There	c
,	c
you	c
find	c
an	c
enormous	c
queue	c
waiting	c
for	c
you	c
but	c
you	c
still	c
have	c
to	c
stay	i
up	c
even	c
though	c
your	c
tired	c
legs	c
demand	c
a	c
seat	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
not	c
really	c
good	c
at	c
basketball	c
but	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
a	i
good	c
fun	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
what	c
types	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
need	c
and	c
beside	c
this	c
,	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
need	c
during	c
my	c
vacation	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

It	c
's	c
ages	c
since	c
I	c
've	c
heard	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

They	c
had	c
a	c
concert	c
in	c
my	c
hometown	i
that	i
's	c
why	c
the	c
organizators	i
were	c
looking	c
for	c
young	c
people	c
who	c
can	i
speak	c
English	c
.	c

I	c
applied	c
and	c
They	i
took	c
me	c
on	c
.	c

They	c
treated	c
me	c
as	c
if	c
I	c
was	c
the	c
private	c
secretary	c
of	c
the	c
department	c
,	c
because	c
of	c
this	c
sometimes	c
I	c
felt	c
that	c
the	c
power	c
was	c
in	c
my	c
hands	c
.	c

By	c
the	c
way	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
already	c
been	c
invited	c
their	i
next	c
concernt	i
.	c

They	c
gave	c
me	c
two	c
free	c
tickets	c
.	c

Would	c
you	c
like	c
to	c
come	c
with	c
me	c
?	c

Looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
was	c
really	c
happy	c
when	c
your	c
letter	c
arrived	c
and	c
I	c
node	i
that	c
I	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
.	c

You	c
wrote	c
that	c
I	c
should	c
choose	c
two	c
activities	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
chosen	c
golf	c
because	c
I	c
playing	i
golf	c
sine	i
1998	c
and	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
improve	c
it	i
and	c
then	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
start	c
a	c
new	c
kind	c
of	c
sport	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
start	c
with	i
climbing	c
.	c

What	c
about	c
money	c
and	c
clothes	c
?	c

I	c
can	c
remember	c
one	c
shopping	c
tour	i
which	c
I	c
had	i
with	i
a	c
man	c
and	c
it	c
was	c
nightmare	i
.	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
fantastic	c
sunny	c
day	c
and	c
we	c
went	c
to	c
Frankfurt	c
and	c
I	c
really	c
needed	c
shows	i
and	c
it	c
is	c
not	c
easy	c
to	c
buy	c
shoes	c
you	i
have	c
to	c
choose	c
carefully	c
.	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

But	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
from	c
the	c
7	c
July	c
2000	c
to	c
the	c
21	c
July	c
2000	c
.	c

For	i
the	i
two	i
activites	i
that	i
I	i
chose	i
are	i
at	i
first	i
swimming	i
,	i
I	c
am	c
in	c
the	c
Swimming	i
Team	i
and	c
I	c
must	c
go	c
two	c
times	c
per	c
week	c
to	c
entretain	i
me	i
because	c
I	c
have	c
competition	i
every	c
weekend	c
.	c

My	c
second	c
choice	c
,	i
it	i
is	c
Basketball	i
.	c

For	c
these	c
two	c
weeks	c
,	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	i
must	i
take	c
?	c

Your	i
sincerely	c

How	c
are	c
you	c
?	c

You	c
know	c
last	c
month	c
I	c
helped	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
as	c
like	i
security	c
.	c

When	c
the	c
concert	c
started	c
I	c
had	c
to	i
look	i
round	i
if	c
anybody	c
threw	c
bottles	c
or	c
something	i
else	c
on	c
the	c
scene	i
.	c

I	c
saw	c
old	c
people	c
,	c
child	i
....	c
and	c
for	c
me	c
it	c
was	c
very	c
strange	c
and	c
it	c
was	c
very	c
interessting	i
,	c
because	c
I	c
met	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
people	c
and	c
the	c
best	c
thing	c
was	c
that	c
I	c
knew	c
the	c
pop	c
group	c
who	c
sang	c
,	i
it	i
was	c
fantastic	c
.	c

Write	c
me	i
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c
.	c

The	c
thing	c
that	c
I	c
liked	c
much	c
more	c
than	c
others	i
,	i
was	c
that	c
I	c
had	i
to	i
buy	i
only	i
one	c
ticket	c
for	c
all	c
events	i
,	c
and	c
it	c
was	c
no	i
pricey	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
clear	c
that	c
for	c
me	c
the	c
last	c
Festival	c
was	c
really	c
great	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
have	c
only	c
one	c
suggestion	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
,	i
I	c
think	c
you	c
should	c
do	i
a	c
baby-parking	i
,	i
in	i
fact	c
a	c
certain	c
number	c
of	c
women	c
could	c
n't	c
see	c
the	c
Festival	c
because	c
of	c
their	c
sons	i
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	i

I	c
like	c
read	i
very	c
much	c
,	c
because	c
every	c
book	c
that	c
I	c
read	c
shows	c
me	c
a	c
different	c
world	c
.	c

What	c
I	c
try	i
to	c
explain	c
is	c
that	c
in	c
every	c
book	c
there	c
are	c
characters	c
or	c
situations	c
really	i
different	c
.	c

So	c
we	c
can	c
read	c
realistic	c
stories	c
or	c
fantastic	c
,	i
it	i
depends	c
from	i
what	c
we	c
prefer	c
.	c

The	c
attention	c
of	c
the	c
is	i
focused	c
on	c
the	c
unfortunate	c
love	c
of	i
Heatcliff	c
and	c
Catherine	c
.	c

They	c
are	c
the	c
main	c
characters	c
of	c
that	c
book	c
,	c
and	c
what	c
caracterize	i
them	c
is	c
the	c
violence	c
of	c
their	c
passions	c
.	c

In	c
this	c
book	c
you	c
can	c
find	c
only	c
good	c
or	c
bad	c
characters	c
,	i
everything	c
is	c
good	c
or	c
bad	c
.	c

In	c
other	c
words	c
,	c
when	c
I	c
read	c
a	c
book	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
go	c
in	i
a	c
world	c
where	c
I	c
can	c
find	c
something	c
different	c
from	c
my	c
everyday	c
life	c
.	c

I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
show	c
,	i
"	c
OVER	c
THE	c
RAINBOW	c
"	c
a	c
few	c
days	c
ago	c
.	c

There	c
are	c
some	c
differences	c
between	c
the	c
advertisement	c
and	c
the	c
real	c
show	c
.	c

With	i
the	c
advertisement	c
,	c
you	c
mentioned	c
Mr.	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Ms.	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
were	c
going	c
to	c
play	i
but	c
actually	c
different	c
people	c
were	c
playing	i
,	c
whom	c
I	c
have	i
never	c
seen	c
before	c
.	c

And	c
also	c
it	c
said	c
it	c
was	c
going	c
to	c
start	c
at	c
19:30	c
but	c
it	c
was	i
not	i
started	i
until	c
20:15	c
.	c

As	i
I	i
am	i
writing	i
,	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
a	c
perfect	c
evening	c
at	c
all	c
but	c
horrible	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
for	c
money	i
back	c
and	c
compensate	i
for	c
my	c
special	c
20th	c
birthday	c
.	c

There	c
have	i
been	i
already	c
a	c
variety	c
of	c
fashion	c
style	i
nowadays	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
,	i
there	c
will	c
be	c
some	c
diffences	i
in	c
quality	i
and	c
materials	c
of	c
clothes	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
speaking	c
of	c
sports	c
,	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
remarkable	c
progress	c
has	c
been	c
made	c
in	i
especially	i
swimming	c
costumes	c
and	c
athletes	c
'	c
costumes	i
for	c
Olympic	i
.	c

In	c
addition	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
the	c
earth	c
will	c
be	c
warmer	c
and	c
warmer	i
than	c
now	c
and	c
100	c
year	i
from	c
now	c
will	i
be	i
an	i
Area	i
of	i
Space	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
further	c
information	c
about	c
the	c
two	c
weeks	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
happy	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
you	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
when	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
go	c
there	c
.	c

Actually	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
asked	c
my	c
boss	c
and	c
he	c
gave	i
me	c
two	c
weeks	c
in	i
July	c
.	c

Thirdly	c
,	c
I	c
prefer	c
staying	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
than	i
staying	c
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
.	c

Concerning	c
the	c
activities	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
choose	c
tennis	c
and	c
sailing	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
tennis	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
not	c
know	c
if	c
things	c
are	c
expensive	c
there	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

We	c
have	c
more	c
and	c
more	c
shops	c
everywhere	c
and	c
they	c
sale	i
everything	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
especially	i
when	c
there	c
is	i
too	c
many	c
people	c
in	c
there	i
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
visit	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
and	c
have	c
a	c
good	c
dinner	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
impossible	c
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
the	c
perfect	c
evening	c
that	c
I	c
expected	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
am	c
therefore	c
writing	c
to	c
ask	c
for	c
a	c
full	c
refund	c
of	i
the	c
tickets	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

But	c
she	c
was	c
very	c
sad	c
because	c
she	c
knew	c
that	c
it	c
will	i
be	c
very	c
difficult	c
to	i
see	c
eachother	i
in	c
the	c
future	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
n't	c
explain	c
all	c
my	c
problems	c
to	c
her	c
and	c
her	c
voice	c
had	c
changed	c
.	c

I	c
worked	c
hard	c
during	i
one	c
month	c
and	i
I	c
could	c
save	c
money	i
to	c
buy	c
a	c
ticket	i
for	i
the	i
plane	i
.	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
,	c

When	c
we	c
arrived	c
at	c
the	c
Circle	c
theatre	c
in	c
the	c
evening	c
,	c
we	c
were	i
waiting	i
during	i
a	c
long	c
time	c
,	c
because	c
that	i
you	i
advertisement	c
noticed	i
that	c
the	c
musical	i
show	c
would	c
begin	c
at	c
19:30	c
,	c
and	c
eventually	c
it	c
began	c
at	c
20:15	c
.	c

This	c
evening	c
was	c
the	c
worst	c
evening	c
of	c
all	i
my	c
life	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
.	c

PEDRO	c
REZ	c
SORAN	c

Because	c
of	c
this	c
,	c
Sally	c
's	c
parents	c
and	c
my	c
parents	c
went	c
to	c
Brazil	c
rapidly	i
.	c

Because	c
of	c
this	c
,	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
sell	c
the	c
house	c
and	c
left	c
our	c
jobs	c
.	c

I	c
went	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
evening	c
performance	c
of	c
your	c
production	c
of	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
on	c
saturday	i
the	c
2nd	c
of	c
June	c
.	c

I	c
bought	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
most	c
expensive	c
tickets	c
.	c

To	c
my	c
greatest	c
disappointement	i
Danny	c
Brooks	c
was	c
not	c
in	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
but	c
his	c
part	c
was	c
played	c
by	c
an	c
actor	c
whose	c
(	c
lack	c
of	c
)	c
singing	c
and	c
acting	c
skills	c
did	c
not	c
make	c
him	c
a	c
suitable	c
replacement	c
.	c

After	c
the	c
show	c
I	c
had	i
to	i
find	i
out	c
that	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
,	c
that	i
had	c
been	c
recommended	c
to	c
me	c
,	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
it	c
had	c
been	c
booked	c
by	c
a	c
private	c
party	c
.	c

Contrary	c
to	c
your	c
advertisement	c
I	c
had	i
no	i
"	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
"	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
you	c
should	c
return	c
to	c
me	c
at	c
least	c
half	c
of	c
the	c
20	c
£	c
I	c
paid	c
for	c
my	c
ticket	c

Dear	c
manager	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
that	c
I	c
stayed	i
very	c
disappointed	c
with	c
the	c
theatre	c
.	c

I	c
thought	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
the	c
best	c
musical	c
show	c
that	c
London	c
had	c
.	c

I	c
bought	c
my	c
tickets	c
fuee	i
days	c
before	c
the	c
theatre	i
thinking	c
I	c
will	i
have	i
discounts	i
.	c

But	c
it	i
happenned	i
the	i
opposite	i
.	c

I	c
payed	i
the	c
same	c
as	c
who	i
bought	c
the	c
tickets	c
ten	c
minutes	c
before	c
the	c
theatre	i
.	c

After	c
all	c
this	c
,	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
know	c
if	c
I	c
will	c
have	i
some	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
so	c

It	c

it	c

because	c

I	c

Also	c

travel	c

that	c
is	i
including	i
in	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c

it	c

very	c
good	c

In	c

Last	c
month	c
I	c
enjoyed	c
a	i
lot	i
to	i
help	i
at	i
a	i
pop	i
concert	i
,	i
really	i
it	c
was	c
a	c
very	c
intresting	i
experience	c
,	c
particularly	c
to	i
had	c
deal	i
with	c
a	c
young	c
group	c
of	c
children	c
from	c
Latin	c
America	c
.	c

Also	c
another	c
interesting	c
things	i
was	c
to	i
know	i
about	c
their	c
culture	c
,	c
because	c
all	c
of	c
them	c
come	c
from	c
Peru	c
,	c
Bolivia	c
,	c
Ecuador	c
,	c
Chile	c
and	i
Uruguay	c
.	c

Now	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
end	c
this	c
letter	c
,	c
so	c
please	c
call	c
me	c
if	c
you	c
want	c
to	c
see	c
me	c
next	c
week	c
.	c

Love	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
to	c
tell	c
that	i
I	c
saw	c
your	c
musical	c
show	c
,,Over	i
the	c
rainbow	i
"	c
and	c
there	c
were	c
too	c
many	c
disappointing	c
divergences	c
between	c
the	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
show	c
and	c
the	c
show	c
itself	c
.	c

The	c
main	c
problem	c
was	c
that	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
did	c
not	c
take	c
part	c
in	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
bought	c
a	c
£	c
20	c
ticket	c
mostly	c
because	c
I	c
saw	c
his	c
name	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
I	c
live	c
in	c
Kursk	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
can	c
get	c
a	c
letter	c
from	c
my	c
friend	c
after	i
some	i
hours	i
since	i
he	c
has	c
written	c
it	c
.	c

My	c
grandmother	c
lives	c
in	c
Orel	c
,	c
which	c
is	c
much	c
closer	c
to	c
Kursk	c
than	c
Kresnodar	c
.	c

That	c
is	c
because	c
my	c
friend	c
uses	c
e-mail	c
,	c
but	c
my	c
grandmother	c
uses	c
post	i
service	c
.	c

So	c
with	c
Internet	i
I	c
can	c
make	c
friends	c
all	c
over	c
the	c
world	c
and	c
it	c
does	c
not	c
take	c
lots	c
of	c
time	c
.	c

So	c
that	c
I	c
can	c
get	c
books	c
which	c
is	i
impossible	c
to	c
get	c
in	c
libraries	i
of	c
my	c
town	c
.	c

That	c
is	c
why	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
modern	c
techology	i
helps	c
me	c
in	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
is	i
very	c
cool	c
and	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
learn	c
.	c

Looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

Jason	c
Andre	c
.	c

You	c
have	c
to	c
be	c
all	i
the	i
time	i
walking	i
,	c
so	c
your	c
legs	c
will	c
feel	c
pain	i
,	i
hurted	i
at	c
the	c
final	i
of	i
the	i
day	i
,	i
you	i
will	c
be	c
very	c
tired	c
and	c
you	c
would	i
want	c
to	c
hang	i
around	i
for	c
two	c
months	c
.	c

If	c
I	c
go	c
alone	c
is	i
very	c
fast	c
and	c
I	c
enjoy	c
it	c
but	c
if	c
I	c
go	i
with	c
my	c
mother	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
horrible	c
,	c
I	c
will	i
have	c
to	c
do	i
a	c
sacrifice	c
.	c

She	c
will	i
see	c
if	c
it	c
is	c
pretty	c
or	c
not	c
,	c
if	c
it	c
is	c
in	i
discount	i
at	c
other	i
store	c
we	i
will	i
not	c
buy	c
the	c
dress	c
and	c
we	c
will	i
have	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
other	c
store	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
other	c
dress	c
,	c
but	c
at	i
the	i
final	i
of	i
seeing	c
all	c
the	c
stores	c
and	c
looking	c
all	i
the	c
dresses	c
she	c
will	i
decided	i
for	i
the	c
first	c
we	i
saw	c
.	c

It	c
is	i
horrible	c
.	c

Is	i
like	c
a	c
nightmare	c
.	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
pleased	c
to	c
hear	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
and	c
writing	i
to	c
you	c
to	c
offer	c
additional	c
information	c
,	c
as	c
requested	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
planning	c
to	c
visit	c
my	c
Mum	c
in	c
Korea	c
in	c
August	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
once	c
experienced	c
to	i
have	i
been	c
soaked	c
while	c
I	c
was	c
sleeping	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
dut	i
to	c
heavy	c
rain	c
several	c
years	c
ago	c
.	c

How	c
romantic	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
!	c

As	c
for	c
my	c
activities	c
,	c
as	c
I	c
took	c
up	c
playing	c
golf	c
since	i
I	c
was	c
a	c
child	c
and	c
now	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
single-handicapped	c
player	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
have	c
chance	i
to	c
play	c
golf	c
at	c
camp	c
.	c

Additionally	c
I	i
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
which	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
should	c
prepare	i
.	c

How	c
are	c
things	c
these	c
days	c
?	c

I	c
've	c
been	c
busy	c
preparing	c
English	i
exams	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
not	c
until	c
the	c
concert	c
that	c
I	c
became	c
a	c
pop	c
mania	i
.	c

It	c
was	c
really	c
great	c
to	c
have	c
talked	c
with	c
famous	c
pop	c
singers	c
,	c
bands	c
,	c
and	c
TV	c
stars	c
.	c

We	c
usually	c
are	c
apt	c
to	c
think	c
famous	c
stars	c
to	c
be	c
arrogant	c
and	c
nasty	c
,	c
but	c
they	c
were	c
n't	c
at	c
all	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
absolutely	c
our	c
prejudice	c
.	c

They	c
were	c
very	c
kind	c
,	c
soft	c
,	c
well-behaved	c
,	c
even	c
modest	c
.	c

Fortunately	c
there	c
were	c
few	c
emergency	c
accident	i
so	c
I	c
could	c
enjoy	c
the	c
concert	c
without	c
a	c
hurry	i
.	c

Longing	c
for	i
hearing	i
from	c
you	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Jones	c
:	c

To	c
begin	c
with	c
,	c
the	c
actor	c
you	c
publised	i
was	i
going	c
to	c
perform	c
,	c
did	c
n't	c
.	c

Considering	c
all	c
this	c
,	c
and	c
especially	c
the	c
fact	c
that	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
get	c
a	c
discount	c
on	c
my	c
ticket	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
the	c
least	c
you	c
can	c
do	c
is	c
give	c
me	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
to	c
make	c
it	c
up	c
to	c
me	c
,	c
and	c
so	c
I	c
can	c
go	c
an	i
spend	c
the	c
money	c
in	i
a	c
good	c
play	c
when	i
they	c
do	c
what	c
they	c
've	c
promised	c
.	c

Modern	c
technology	c
is	c
,	c
nowadays	c
,	c
not	c
only	c
a	c
"	c
tool	c
"	c
for	c
every	i
day	i
life	c
but	c
also	c
a	c
lifestyle	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
whenever	c
I	c
go	c
out	c
by	c
myself	c
,	c
my	c
father	c
gives	c
me	c
a	c
cell	c
phone	c
,	c
to	c
call	c
him	c
in	c
case	c
I	c
need	c
anything	c
.	c

Another	c
thing	c
I	c
depend	c
on	c
is	c
the	c
computer	c
.	c

Not	c
only	c
to	c
play	c
or	i
use	c
the	c
Internet	c
,	c
but	c
also	c
to	c
write	c
my	c
papers	c
for	c
school	c
.	c

After	i
,	c
you	c
say	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
to	i
visit	i
your	c
restaurant	c
,	c
however	c
it	i
was	c
close	i
,	i
how	i
can	c
you	c
explain	c
that	c
?	c

You	c
say	i
it	c
would	c
be	c
Danny	c
brook	c
the	i
man	i
who	c
was	i
going	i
to	i
sing	i
but	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
.	c

For	c
all	c
of	i
that	i
,	c
I	c
want	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
,	c
at	c
least	c
15	c
of	c
the	c
20	c
pounds	c
I	i
'd	i
paid	i
.	c

Your	i
faithfully	c
,	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
,	c
so	c
without	i
want	i
I	c
knew	c
that	c
it	i
was	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
a	c
concert	c
on	i
owr	i
city	c
of	i
,	c
from	c
my	c
point	c
of	c
view	c
,	c
the	c
best	c
group	c
of	i
the	c
world	c
,	c
Oasis	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
a	c
couple	c
of	c
minutes	c
later	c
,	c
I	c
calmed	c
down	c
and	c
asked	c
she	i
why	c
.	c

I	c
asked	c
her	c
to	c
look	i
photos	c
of	c
Oasis	c
for	c
me	c
and	c
she	c
accepted	i
.	c

If	c
Pat	c
had	c
been	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
n't	c
have	c
known	c
anything	c
about	c
the	c
concert	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
n't	c
have	c
got	c
angry	c
for	i
not	c
being	c
able	c
to	c
go	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
,	c

It	c
is	c
likely	c
to	c
enrich	c
our	c
vocabulary	c
and	c
our	c
knowledge	c
of	c
the	i
English	c
culture	c
...	c

However	c
,	c
we	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
suggest	c
you	i
something	c
:	c

Let	c
me	c
explain	c
you	i
what	c
it	c
is	c
:	c
It	c
must	i
be	i
an	c
exhibition	c
which	c
takes	c
place	c
in	c
the	c
"	c
Central	c
Exhibition	c
Hall	c
"	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
and	c
deals	c
with	c
the	c
latest	c
fashions	c
,	c
the	c
different	c
leisures	i
,	c
make	i
up	i
and	c
so	c
on	c
...	c

What	c
do	c
you	c
think	c
about	c
our	c
jobs	c
?	c

On	c
the	c
one	c
hand	c
,	c
those	c
people	c
are	c
equal	i
to	i
us	c
in	c
the	c
way	c
that	c
they	c
had	c
a	c
childhood	c
,	c
thy	i
got	c
married	c
and	c
built	i
a	c
family	c
...	c

And	c
here	c
comes	c
the	c
paradox	i
:	c
Do	c
we	c
have	c
to	c
reveal	i
someone	c
's	c
privacy	c
to	c
judge	c
his	c
work	c
and	c
appreciate	c
him	c
?	c

I	c
guess	c
this	c
is	c
an	c
unanswerable	c
question	c
...	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
add	c
that	c
journalists	c
-	c
being	c
aware	c
of	c
that	c
hard	i
topic	i
-	c
should	c
try	c
to	c
modorate	i
what	c
they	c
write	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
respect	c
altrui	i
's	i
privacy	c
;	c
since	c
they	c
would	c
probably	c
not	c
be	c
glad	i
to	c
have	c
their	c
own	c
private	c
life	c
revealed	i
!	c

Recently	c
I	c
spent	c
a	c
week	c
's	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

We	c
were	c
there	c
at	c
19:15	c
as	i
the	c
show	c
was	c
starting	c
at	c
19:30	c
for	i
getting	i
our	c
tickets	c
.	c

We	c
asked	c
for	c
the	c
discounts	c
you	c
were	i
refering	i
at	i
your	c
advertisement	c
but	c
the	i
counter	c
told	i
us	c
that	c
they	c
were	c
not	c
available	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
Sunday	c
.	c

We	c
got	c
really	c
bored	c
waiting	c
.	c

After	c
the	c
show	c
had	i
finished	i
we	c
went	c
for	c
dinner	c
at	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
the	c
owner	c
was	c
ill	c
.	c

From	i
all	c
these	c
reasons	c
you	c
can	c
understand	c
how	c
unpleasant	c
our	c
evening	c
.	i

From	c
the	c
time	c
she	c
was	c
a	c
child	c
she	c
could	c
n't	c
keep	c
anything	c
for	i
herself	c
,	c
she	c
always	c
shared	c
her	c
thoughts	c
with	c
other	c
people	c

Kim	c
was	c
terrified	i
because	c
everyone	c
was	c
making	c
fun	c
on	i
her	c
and	c
very	i
angry	c
with	c
Pat	c
.	c

She	c
had	c
to	c
find	c
a	c
way	c
to	c
make	c
Kim	c
forgive	c
her	c
.	c

She	c
stand	i
up	c
infront	i
of	c
the	c
whole	c
classroom	i
and	c
explained	c
that	c
Kim	c
's	c
father	i
actions	c
did	c
n't	c
influence	i
Kim	c
.	c

That	c
she	c
was	c
a	c
great	c
friend	c
to	c
her	c
and	c
if	c
someone	c
owed	i
to	c
be	c
punished	c
that	i
was	c
her	c
.	c

Kim	c
forgave	c
her	c
and	c
all	c
the	c
students	c
understand	i
how	c
wrong	c
they	c
were	i
and	c
were	c
very	c
sorry	c
.	c

Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
,	c
which	c
you	c
advertised	c
.	c

It	c
made	c
me	c
sad	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
staff	c
trainning	i
.	c

I	c
must	c
insist	c
that	c
you	c
refund	c
the	c
cost	c
of	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

It	c
is	c
believed	c
that	c
our	c
life	i
style	i
has	c
been	c
changed	c
by	c
mordern	i
technology	c
such	c
as	c
computers	c
and	c
washing	c
machine	i
etc.	i
Especially	i
for	c
families	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
found	c
very	i
expensive	c
to	c
buy	c
them	c
but	c
there	c
are	c
number	i
of	c
advantages	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
dishwashers	c
are	c
very	c
effecient	i
for	c
me	c
because	c
I	c
work	c
full	i
time	i
and	c
look	c
after	c
my	c
children	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
very	c
difficult	c
to	c
cook	c
and	c
wash	c
dishes	c
after	c
working	c
.	c

For	i
my	i
surprise	i
,	c
when	c
I	c
arrived	c
to	i
the	c
theatre	c
the	c
show	c
still	c
had	c
not	c
started	c
.	c

You	c
should	c
review	c
the	c
advertisements	c
you	c
do	c
because	c
you	c
give	c
wrong	i
information	c
.	c

When	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
over	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
have	c
dinner	c
to	i
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
but	c
I	c
found	c
it	c
closed	c
because	c
your	c
company	c
is	c
lacked	i
of	i
employees	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
if	c
I	c
could	c
have	c
some	c
money	c
back	c
for	c
these	c
problems	c
I	c
have	c
told	c
you	c
.	i

I	c
advise	c
you	c
to	c
pay	c
more	c
attention	c
in	i
your	c
shows	c
and	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c
.	c

I	c
wish	c
I	c
had	c
never	c
told	c
her	c
anything	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
alone	c
because	c
Pat	c
had	c
to	c
go	c
with	i
her	i
parents	i
to	i
the	i
cinema	i
.	c

Suddenly	c
,	c
I	c
heard	c
step	i
noises	i
that	c
were	c
getting	c
closer	c
to	c
me	c
.	c

Then	c
,	c
while	c
I	c
was	c
going	c
back	c
to	c
my	c
class	i
I	c
saw	c
he	c
had	c
n't	c
switched	c
off	c
the	c
light	c
of	i
his	c
room	c
.	c

I	c
went	c
to	c
switch	c
it	c
off	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
n't	c
believe	c
my	c
eyes	c
!	c

The	c
exams	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
next	i
day	c
were	c
there	c
.	c

Without	i
thinking	i
it	i
twice	i
,	c
I	c
took	c
one	c
of	c
them	c
and	c
went	i
quickly	i
home	c
.	c

Next	c
day	c
in	i
the	c
morning	c
,	c
before	c
the	c
exam	c
,	c
we	c
were	c
going	c
to	c
put	c
the	c
exam	c
back	c
with	c
the	c
other	c
exams	c
.	c

First	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
able	i
to	i
come	i
only	i
in	c
July	c
,	c
because	c
my	c
examination	c
session	c
is	c
due	c
from	c
the	c
24	c
June	c
till	c
26	c
June	c
.	c

I	c
won	c
third	c
prize	c
in	c
competition	i
organized	c
by	c
our	c
college	c

Could	c
you	c
,	c
pleas	i
send	c
me	c
some	c
extra	c
information	c
regarding	c
the	c
ammount	i
of	c
money	c
I	c
should	c
take	c
to	c
cover	c
any	c
other	c
expenses	c
,	c
and	c
also	c
,	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
should	c
take	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c

Is	c
shopping	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
?	c

I	c
like	c
shopping	c
very	c
much	c

You	c
can	c
always	c
ask	c
for	c
good	c
advice	c
from	c
the	c
experienced	c
shop	c
attendants	i

does	c
not	c

Dear	c
sir	i
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
express	c
my	c
dissatisfaction	c
with	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
which	c
the	c
Circle	c
Threatre	i
has	i
presented	i
.	c

I	c
recently	c
had	c
a	c
week	c
's	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
and	c
during	c
my	c
stay	c
I	c
came	i
to	c
your	c
threatre	i
to	c
see	c
the	i
"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
.	c

My	c
evening	c
was	c
very	c
disappointing	c
.	c

A	c
different	c
actor	c
was	c
playing	i
durring	i
the	c
musical	c
and	c
he	c
was	c
very	c
disappointing	c
.	c

After	c
the	c
show	c
had	c
finished	c
I	i
went	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurand	i
to	c
hav	i
something	c
to	c
drink	c
and	c
get	i
relaxed	i
but	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
the	c
stuff	i
was	c
on	c
holiday	c
.	c

Moreover	c
the	c
discounts	c
were	c
not	c
available	c
as	c
you	c
say	i
in	c
the	c
advertisment	i
and	c
I	c
paid	c
£	c
20	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
some	i
refand	i
because	c
It	i
was	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
worst	c
evenings	c
in	i
my	c
life	i
it	i
if	i
this	c
matter	c
does	i
not	c
solve	i
I	i
will	c
go	i
further	i
.	c

I	c
hope	c
that	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
solved	i
properly	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
not	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

He	c
and	c
his	c
friends	c
got	c
in	i
trouble	c
because	c
of	c
this	c
habit	c
,	i
last	c
week	c
.	c

As	c
they	c
were	c
watching	c
T.V	i
at	c
Nick	c
's	c
house	c
last	c
Sunday	c
,	c
Sally	c
noticed	c
that	c
their	c
cut	i
Curly	c
was	c
hurt	c
,	c
she	i
could	c
not	c
walk	c
.	c

The	c
children	c
were	c
very	c
unhappy	c
and	c
sorry	i
about	i
the	c
pet	c
.	c

"	c
Somebody	c
had	i
hurt	i
her	c
and	c
had	i
let	i
her	c
without	c
help	c
"	c
Mourk	i
said	c
angrily	c
.	c

Everybod	i
agreed	c
with	c
her	c
.	c

Suddenly	c
Pat	c
cried	c
:	c
"	c
Oh	c
my	c
Lord	c
,	c
Bad	c
Jon	c
had	i
done	i
this	c
.	c

"	c
Yes	c
,	c
Oh	i
Lord	c
he	c
did	c
it	c
because	c
we	c
won	i
his	c
team	c
at	c
football	c
"	c
Nick	i
said	c
.	c

"	c
He	c
is	c
so	c
bad	c
.	c

Hey	c
Listen	i
guys	c
we	i
will	c
take	c
his	c
dog	c
which	c
love	i
very	c
much	c
and	c
we	c
will	c
sell	c
it	c
to	c
Sally	c
who	c
wants	c
one	c
.	c

Next	c
morning	c
as	i
Pat	c
was	c
going	c
to	c
school	c
met	i
Bad	c
Jon	c
.	i

We	c
know	c
what	c
you	c
have	c
done	c
and	c
your	c
dog	c
will	c
be	c
sold	c
"	c

who	c
was	c
the	c

minister	i
about	c
the	c
children	i
'	i
plan	c
.	c

Of	c
course	c
they	c
were	c
punished	c
.	c

There	c
is	c
only	c
one	c
thing	c
we	c
do	c
n't	c
agree	c
with	c
you	c
,	i
it	c
is	c
the	c
Tuesday	i
14	c
March	c
.	c

It	c
would	c
be	c
very	c
special	c
for	c
us	c
because	c
we	c
have	c
n't	c
seen	c
something	i
like	c
that	c
before	c

The	c
Home	c
of	c
the	c
Future	c

Most	c
of	c
us	c
live	c
in	c
houses	c
or	c
flats	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
most	i
very	c
comfortable	c
.	c

But	c
in	c
which	i
kind	c
of	c
homes	c
will	c
people	c
stay	i
in	c
the	c
future	c
?	c

We	c
can	i
need	c
our	c
imagination	c
for	i
answering	i
these	c
questions	c
but	c
we	c
will	c
never	c
know	c
the	c
right	c
answer	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
further	i
ideas	c
:	i
In	c
the	c
futur	i
,	c
maybe	c
in	c
2113	c
,	c
there	c
will	c
are	i
houses	c
like	c
now	c
but	c
only	i
with	c
more	c
technical	c
things	c
.	c

These	c
things	c
and	c
a	c
lot	c
more	c
went	i
change	c
or	c
wont	i
be	c
forgotten	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
.	i

This	c
is	c
my	c
idea	c
and	c
we	c
will	c
see	c
!	c

In	c
the	c
advertisement	c
the	c
time	c
when	c
the	c
show	c
should	c
start	c
was	c
19.30	c
but	c
it	c
started	c
20:15	i
.	c

In	c
your	c
adv	i
.	i

Yours	c
faithfully	c

For	i
the	c
last	c
one	c
hundred	c
years	c
science	c
and	c
technology	c
did	i
big	i
step	c
if	i
we	c
looking	i
to	i
back	c
.	c

They	c
were	i
used	i
just	i
a	c
candle	c
.	c

New	c
techology	i
more	i
our	c
life	i
more	c
comfortable	c
and	c
esee	i
.	c

Evrything	i
what	i
we	c
do	c
now	c
we	c
do	c
with	c
:	i
it	c
help	i
,	i
looking	i
after	c
house	i
,	c
make	i
very	c
difficult	c
operation	i
,	c
becose	i
the	c
computer	c
can	c
think	c
much	c
faster	c
then	i
human	i
.	c

These	c
are	c
some	c
points	c
I	c
want	c
mention	i
about	c
the	c
differencies	i
between	c
the	i
advertisement	c
said	c
and	c
the	c
realities	c
.	c

First	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
great	c
expectation	c
to	c
see	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
plays	i
his	c
role	c
,	c
but	c
he	c
had	c
never	c
shown	c
up	c
that	c
night	c
.	c

The	c
main	c
actor	c
was	c
an	c
unknown	c
actor	c
.	c

Second	c
,	c
it	c
started	i
only	i
at	c
20:15	c
.	c

Forth	i
,	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

Finally	c
the	i
sentence	c
was	i
written	c
blow	i
down	i
on	c
the	c
advertisement	c
was	c
absolutely	c
not	c
true	c
.	c

I	c
wish	i
that	c
you	c
can	c
provide	c
a	c
better	c
service	c
next	c
time	c
,	c
and	c
this	c
time	c
you	c
need	c
give	i
back	c
the	c
money	c
we	c
paid	c
.	c

Sincerely	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

Secondly	c
the	c
language	c
ability	c
was	c
another	c
issue	c
.	c

I	c
really	c
wished	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
friend	c
can	i
share	c
everything	c
is	i
going	c
in	i
our	c
lives	c
.	c

She	c
was	c
a	i
such	i
wonderful	c
person	c
in	c
our	c
class	c
.	c

She	c
tried	c
to	c
help	c
others	c
when	c
they	c
have	i
difficult	i
time	c
at	c
school	c
.	c

One	c
day	c
she	c
realized	c
that	c
I	c
was	c
always	c
been	i
outside	c
of	c
circle	i
.	c

One	c
day	c
she	c
invited	c
me	c
to	c
her	c
flat	c
.	c

We	c
had	c
a	c
fantastic	c
time	c
together	c
for	c
three	c
monthes	i
.	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
nightmare	c
!	c

June	c

The	c
ones	c
I	c
consider	c
I	c
'm	c
good	c
at	c
are	c

specially	c
with	c

I	c
just	c
could	c
n't	c
believe	c
it	c

In	c
the	c
area	c
of	c
publicity	c
we	c
were	c
about	c
50	c

all	c
of	c
us	c
investigating	c

calling	c
to	i
radio	c

be	c
for	c
the	c
interview	c
that	c
took	c
place	c
afterwards	c
...	c

,	c
it	c
was	c
an	i
incredible	i
satisfation	i
when	c
everything	c
finished	i
just	c
fine	c

But	c
,	c
I	c
heard	c
you	c

You	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

Everyone	c
was	c
so	c
jealous	c
in	c
the	c
school	c
.	c

However	c
the	c
best	c
part	c
was	c
watching	c
and	c
listening	c
to	c
the	c
singers	c
and	c
bands	c
practicing	i
on	c
the	c
stage	c
.	c

At	c
the	c
end	c
we	c
were	c
given	c
free	c
concert	c
tickets	c
and	c
got	c
autobiographies	i
from	c
our	c
favourite	c
pop	c
singers	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
the	c
best	c
day	c
of	c
my	c
life	c
and	c
certainly	c
for	c
others	c
,	c
too	c
.	c

For	c
the	c
attention	c
to	i
the	c
manager	c
:	c
I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
organization	c
of	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
that	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
presented	c
.	c

The	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
show	c
announced	c
that	c
we	c
were	i
able	c
to	c
visit	c
the	c
Theatre	c
restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
due	i
to	i
the	c
Chef	c
who	c
leaded	i
the	c
Restaurant	c
did	c
not	c
remember	c
to	c
bring	c
the	c
keys	c
to	c
open	c
it	c

yours	c
sincerely	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
and	c
she	c
told	c
her	c
mother	c
what	c
had	c
happened	c
during	c
the	c
concert	c
.	c

Peter	c
had	c
a	c
terribly	i
problem	c
with	c
drugs	c
.	c

He	c
started	c
to	c
consum	i
the	c
stuff	c
at	c
the	c
age	c
of	c
twenty	c
.	c

He	c
had	c
problems	c
at	c
home	c
because	c
his	c
mother	c
wanted	c
to	c
settle	c
down	c
to	i
Australia	c
,	c
but	c
Peter	c
was	c
used	c
to	c
live	i
in	c
New	c
York	c
,	c
overcrowded	i
and	c
surronded	i
by	c
people	c
.	c

Australia	c
is	c
a	i
country	i
too	i
calm	i
for	c
him	c
.	c

We	c
invited	c
him	c
to	c
enjoy	i
the	c
concert	i
of	i
Texas	i
but	c
he	c
started	c
to	c
make	i
nonsenses	i
because	c
of	c
the	c
drugs	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
he	c
began	c
to	c
run	c
around	c
the	c
crowd	c
and	c
also	c
to	c
hit	c
the	c
advertisements	c
which	c
announced	c
the	c
concert	c
.	c

A	c
security	c
guard	c
saw	c
it	i
and	c
put	i
his	c
attention	c
on	i
him	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Ryan	c
.	i

I	c
will	c
give	c
you	c
all	c
information	i
you	c
need	c
and	c
ask	c
some	c
questions	c
.	c

Because	c
I	c
never	i
live	i
in	c
tents	i
before	c
.	c

I	c
like	c
doing	c
sports	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
play	c
basketball	c
and	c
golf	c
when	c
I	c
am	c
at	c
the	c
Camp	c
.	c

I	c
play	c
basketball	c
a	c
lot	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
member	c
of	c
our	c
college	c
term	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
your	i
reply	c
.	c

Computing	c
lesson	c
and	c
computer	c
room	c

Nowdays	i
internet	i
makes	i

You	c
ca	c
n't	c
forget	c
football	c
.	c

With	c
reference	c
to	c
the	c
accomodation	i
I	c
would	c
rather	c
stay	c
in	c
tent	i
because	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
the	c
best	c
way	c
to	c
socialize	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
know	c
whether	c
meals	c
are	c
included	c
or	c
not	c
in	i
the	c
accomodation	i
so	c
that	c
I	c
could	i
decide	c
how	c
much	c
I	c
must	c
have	c
with	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

I	c
bet	c
you	c
want	c
to	c
know	c
everything	c
about	c
my	c
great	c
experience	c
at	c
Luna	c
Pop	c
's	c
concert	c
last	c
month	c
.	c

When	c
we	c
arrived	c
she	c
persuaded	c
me	c
to	c
go	c
the	i
backstage	c
because	c
her	c
boyfriend	c
was	c
the	c
electrician	i
of	i
the	i
band	i
.	c

It	c
did	c
n't	c
sound	c
very	c
exciting	c
to	c
me	c
but	c
I	c
accepted	c
above	i
all	i
because	c
I	c
was	c
curious	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
what	c
I	c
found	c
was	c
n't	c
what	c
I	c
expected	c
.	c

Everyone	c
was	c
upset	c
,	c
worried	c
or	c
angry	c
and	c
Lucre	c
,	c
Ake	c
's	c
boyfriend	c
,	c
explained	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
because	c
their	c
pianist	c
had	c
broken	c
his	c
arm	c
and	c
could	c
n't	c
play	c
.	c

In	i
that	i
moment	i
Ake	c
exlaimed	i
that	c
I	c
could	c
play	c
the	c
piano	c
.	c

I	i
think	i
you	i
ca	i
n't	i
believe	i
in	i
what	c
I	c
've	c
told	c
you	c
but	c
I	c
wo	c
n't	c
forget	c
this	c
experience	c
.	c

I	c
wish	c
you	c
had	c
been	c
with	c
me	c
but	c
I	c
'm	c
sure	c
you	c
understand	c
what	c
I	c
felt	c
.	c

Bety	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
:	c

I	c
will	c
start	c
telling	i
you	c
how	c
crowded	c
it	c
was	c
,	c
the	i
people	c
was	i
so	c
excited	c
that	c
they	c
were	c
screaming	c
from	c
the	c
beginning	c
to	c
the	c
end	c
.	c

Anyway	c
,	c
I	c
also	c
laughed	c
a	c
lot	c
,	c
the	c
music	c
was	c
fantastic	c
,	c
and	c
the	c
stars	c
were	c
really	c
nice	c
to	c
every	i
one	i
.	c

I	c
tried	c
to	c
take	c
a	c
photo	c
of	c
everyone	c
,	c
but	c
sometimes	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
possible	c
.	c

I	c
will	c
send	c
you	c
a	c
copy	c
of	c
the	c
best	c
pictures	c
the	c
next	c
time	c
.	c

bye-bye	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
'	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
'	i
I	i
've	i
visited	i
it	c
last	i
evening	c
in	c
your	c
'	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
'	c
.	c

By	c
the	c
way	c
I	i
would	c
enquire	i
about	c
some	i
money	c
back	c
.	c

I	c
read	c
your	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
show	c
and	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
wonderful	c
evening	c
by	c
visiting	i
it	c
.	c

I	c
waited	c
and	c
it	c
becomes	i
8	c
o'clock	c
pm	c
-	c
nothing	c
happened	c
.	c

At	c
quarter	c
past	c
8	c
pm	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
looking	c
for	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
saw	c
some	c
foreign	c
actors	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
know	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
wrong	i
and	i
afraid	i
about	i
it	c
and	c
I	c
remember	i
that	c
this	c
was	c
the	c
third	c
problem	c
this	i
evening	c
.	c

The	c
restaurant	c
,	c
which	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
visit	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
for	i
eating	i
something	c
,	c
was	c
closed	c
without	c
any	c
explaination	i
and	c
the	c
perfect	c
evening	c
was	c
completely	c
unperfect	i
.	c

100	c
years	c
ago	c
the	i
people	c
wore	c
long	c
clothes	i
and	c
large	i
robes	i
.	c

Often	c
you	c
causes	i
very	c
litte	i
and	i
short	c
robes	i
and	c
tops	c
.	c

Often	c
you	c
show	c
your	c
skin	c
because	c
its	i
popular	c
and	i
everyone	c
do	i
it	c
.	c

So	c
it	i
's	i
possible	c
to	c
wear	c
nothing	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
.	c

But	c
this	c
problem	c
is	c
solving	c
by	i
itselfes	i
.	c

The	c
sommers	i
and	c
winters	c
get	c
warmer	c
.	c

But	c
by	i
some	c
situations	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
wear	c
something	c
.	c

The	c
clothes	c
you	c
'll	c
wear	c
will	c
be	c
very	c
extraordinary	c
because	c
of	c
their	c
special	c
kind	i
of	c
producing	i
.	c

Think	c
about	c
this	c
idea	c
and	c
perhaps	c
you	c
'll	c
understand	c
it	c
.	c

17th	c

Your	c
advertisement	c
was	i
featuring	i
"	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
"	c
as	c
the	c
main	c
characters	c
but	c
in	c
fact	c
some	c
other	c
people	c
replaced	c
them	c
that	c
evening	c
.	c

Well	c
I	c
tried	c
to	c
do	c
so	c
but	c
the	c
lady	c
at	c
the	c
desk	c
told	c
me	c
that	c
they	i
were	i
quotas	i
available	i
at	c
that	c
price	c
but	c
were	c
already	c
sold	c
out	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
disappointed	c
of	i
my	c
supposed	c
"	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
"	c
to	i
your	c

and	c
due	i
to	i
all	c
the	c
above-mentioned	c
reasons	c
I	c
am	c
asking	c
for	c
a	c
complete	c
refund	c

two	c

Technology	c

word	c
for	c

Egyptians	c
,	c
Mayas	c
,	c
Incas	c
,	c
etc.	c
were	i
civilisations	c
with	c
great	c

they	c
were	i
mastering	i
most	c
of	c
the	c
science	i
fields	i
we	c
deal	c
with	c
today	c

The	i
military	i
technology	c
has	c
affected	c
our	c
lives	c
more	c
than	c
what	i
we	c
think	c
because	c

Dear	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
this	c
letter	c
I	i
order	i
to	c
complain	c
my	i
unpleasant	c
experience	c
in	i
your	c
theatre	c
.	c

The	c
audience	c
were	c
anxious	c
and	c
bored	c
.	c

We	c
felt	c
totally	c
disappointed	c
and	c
cheated	c
.	c

After	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
hungry	c
and	c
tired	c

But	c
when	c
I	c
got	c
there	c
,	c
it	c
had	c
closed	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
can	c
pay	c
me	c
the	c
money	c
back	c
as	c
compensation	c
.	c

Modern	c
technology	c
has	c
changed	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
in	c
two	c
ways	c
.	c

When	c
we	c
look	c
around	c
in	i
the	c
house	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
easy	c
to	c
find	c
things	c
like	c
these	i
:	i
microwave	i
oven	c
,	c
TV	c
set	c
,	c
computer	c
,	i
etc.	c
All	c
these	c
equippments	i
are	c
the	i
applications	c
of	c
modern	c
science	c

With	c
the	c
spreading	c

of	c

people	c
living	c
in	c

of	c
the	c

through	i
the	c

The	c
development	c
of	c
information	c
technology	c
has	c
changed	c
the	c
world	c
into	c
"	c
an	i
earth	i
village	i
"	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
hoping	c
to	c
devote	c
myself	c
into	i
the	i
development	i
of	i
it	i
.	c

Answering	i
your	c
reguest	i
you	i
asked	i
me	i
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
only	c
July	i
because	c
,	i
in	i
fact	i
.	i

I	i
ll	i
be	c
on	c
vacation	c
until	c
August	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
this	i
is	c
the	c
best	c
month	c
to	c
travel	c
.	c

According	i
to	i
my	i
great	i
experience	i
on	i
climbing	i
,	c
I	c
prefer	c
accommodation	i
in	c
log	c
cabins	c
because	c
in	c
tents	c
we	c
ca	c
n't	c
sleep	c
or	c
being	i
well	c
with	c
such	i
cold	c
!	c

Never	c
the	c
less	c
in	i
summer	c
we	c
ca	c
n't	c
resist	c
such	c
hot	i
!	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
if	c
we	c
need	c
money	i
for	i
paying	i
or	i
baying	i
something	i
because	c
you	c
did	c
n't	c
specify	c
what	c
is	c
included	c
in	c
the	c
trip	c

such	c

The	c
truth	c
of	i
Shopping	c

Shopping	c
...	c
a	c
great	c
and	c
emotion	i
statement	c
,	c
do	c
n't	c
you	c
think	c
?	c

But	c
the	c
question	c
is	c
:	c
Why	i
shopping	i
is	i
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
?	c

Let	c
's	c
talk	c
about	c
women	c
;	c
nightmare	c
!	c
women	i
ca	c
n't	c
resist	c
the	c
fact	i
of	c
shopping	c
and	c
they	c
are	c
dissapointed	i
when	c
they	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
the	c
wants	i
to	c
shop	c

I	c
know	c
women	c
that	i
make	i
everything	c
they	c
can	c
to	c
buy	c
only	c
a	c
dress	c
,	c
or	c
even	c
worst	i
,	c
women	c
that	i
buy	c
things	c
that	i
was	i
nothing	i
to	i
do	i
with	i
them	i
,	c
for	c
example	c
,	c
snap	i
,	c
esculptures	i

kitchen	c
tissues	c

or	c
eveything	i
on	i
telemarketing	c
that	c
really	c
are	i
unuseful	i
,	c
but	c
the	i
fact	i
of	i
have	i
it	i
"	i
there	i
"	i
they	i
can	i
resist	i

I	c
am	c

to	c
you	c

very	c
disappointing	i
with	c

all	c
I	i
want	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
I	c
'm	c
very	c
keen	c
on	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
who	c
was	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
main	c
reasons	c
why	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
come	i
.	c

I	c
also	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
why	c
the	c
musical	i
show	c
started	c
at	c
a	c
quarter	c
past	c
eight	c
instead	c
of	c
half	c
past	c
seven	c
.	c

Of	c
course	c
discounts	c
were	c
not	c
available	c
either	c
,	c
and	c
the	c
restaurant	c
where	c
we	c
were	c
supposed	c
to	c
eat	c
afterwards	c
was	c
closed	c
without	c
any	c
explanation	c
at	c
all	c
.	c

I	c
guess	c
all	c
my	c
reasons	c
are	c
more	c
than	c
enough	c
to	c
get	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c

A	c
couple	c
of	c
years	c
ago	c
I	c
bought	c
a	c
new	c
computer	c
and	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
learn	c
all	c
about	c
them	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
impressed	c
by	c
communications	c
as	c
well	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
extremly	i
happy	c
because	c
not	c
only	c
do	c
I	c
earn	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
money	c
but	c
also	c
I	c
'm	c
learning	c
a	c
lot	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
as	c
you	c
can	c
see	c
,	c
modern	c
technology	c
has	c
had	c
influence	i
in	i
my	c
life	c
.	c

I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
travell	i
in	c
july	i
because	c
I	c
've	c
got	c
an	c
examination	c
at	c
USP	c
in	c
Roo	c
Cohelo	c
in	c
July	c
.	c

For	c
it	i
the	c
only	c
one	i
that	c
I	c
can	c
travel	c
is	c
July	c
.	c

And	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
log	i
cabins	i
because	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
bear	c
sleeping	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
,	i
I	c
hate	c
this	i
kind	c
of	c
accomodation	i
.	c

I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
play	c
Tennis	i
and	c
swimming	i
these	i
are	c
my	c
favourite	c
sports	c
.	c

I	c
can	c
play	c
tennis	c
better	c
I	i
can	c
swim	c
,	c
because	c
since	c
I	c
was	c
I	i
child	c
I	c
've	c
been	c
practising	i
it	c
.	c

I	c
've	c
already	c
Won	i
three	c
prizes	c
about	i
it	c
.	c

And	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
about	i
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
to	c
take	c
and	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
to	c
take	c
too	c

I	c
've	c
never	c
gone	i

USA	i
before	c

One	c
good	c
idea	c
to	i
go	c
to	i
shopping	c
is	i
when	c
you	c
got	i
plenty	c
of	c
money	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c
the	c
competition	c
Organiser	c
,	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
do	c
Tennis	c
and	c
Photography	c
.	c

Will	c
there	c
be	c
any	c
shops	c
?	c

Not	c
only	c
shops	i
are	i
crowded	c
with	c
people	c
,	c
the	c
changing	c
rooms	c
have	c
enormous	c
queue	i
.	c

I	c
do	c
agree	c
that	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
because	c
of	c
crowded	c
shops	c
and	c
the	c
price	c
of	c
clothes	c
but	c
I	c
am	c
sure	c
that	c
the	c
majority	c
of	c
people	c
do	c
like	c
shopping	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
sure	c
that	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
,	i
there	c
will	c
be	c
no	c
more	c
crowded	c
streets	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
'	c
internet	i
'	i
which	i
you	c
can	c
order	c

Danny	c
Brook	c
was	c
going	i
to	c
be	c
the	c
starring	c
actor	c
but	c
he	c
wasn	i
not	c
,	c
actor	i
took	c
his	c
place	c
.	c

That	c
was	c
very	c
disappointing	c
.	c

The	c
play	c
was	c
going	i
to	c
start	c
at	c
19.30	c
but	c
is	i
was	c
very	c
delay	i
It	i
start	i
at	c
20.15	c
.	c

And	c
this	c
is	c
not	c
all	c
there	i
is	c
more	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
the	c
next	c
time	c
you	c
write	i
an	c
advertiment	i
you	c
write	i
it	i
with	i
the	c
right	c
information	c

I	c
did	c
not	c
have	c
a	c
perfect	c
evening	c
with	c
so	c
many	c
proplems	i
.	c

So	c
I	c
am	c
asking	c
to	i
retern	i
me	c
some	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

Techology	i
is	i
a	c
bad	c
or	c
a	c
good	c
efection	i
?	c

What	c
does	c
it	c
offer	c
to	c
us	c
?	c

How	c
people	i
use	c
modern	c
technology	c
?	c

Let	i
see	c
if	c
we	c
use	c
the	i
modern	c
technology	c
we	i
may	i
have	c
good	c
and	i
bad	c
results	c

But	c

Shooping	i
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
if	i
we	c
go	c
to	c
a	c
big	c
mall	c
we	c
will	c
probably	c
never	c
find	c
what	c
we	c
were	i
looking	c
for	c
,	c
and	c
instead	c
of	c
buing	i
what	c
we	c
came	c
for	c
we	c
will	c
go	i
out	i
with	c
lots	c
of	c
things	c
that	c
we	c
liked	c
but	c
we	c
will	c
never	c
use	c
.	c

And	c
that	c
will	c
be	c
waste	i
of	c
time	c
.	c

Sometimes	c
we	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
our	c
little	c
brothers	c
with	c
us	c
,	c
because	c
our	c
mother	c
is	c
n't	c

then	i
is	c
where	i
the	c
problems	c
begin	c

Most	c
of	c

times	i

Dear	c
manager	c

After	c
the	c
show	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
with	c
my	c
friends	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
of	c
illness	i

Yours	c

For	c
me	c
modern	c
technology	c
are	i
things	c
like	c
personal	c
computers	c
,	c
mobile	c
phones	c
,	c
keyboards	c
,	c
video	c
recorders	c
,	c
Hifi	i
sound	c
systems	c

television	c
or	c
even	c
cars	c
.	c

If	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
training	c
I	c
need	c
not	c
wait	c
for	c
the	c
bus	c
,	c
and	c
so	c
I	c
need	c
not	c
start	c
one	c
and	c
a	c
half	c
hour	i
before	c
training	c
I	i
start	c
a	i
half	i
hour	c
before	c
.	c

The	i
same	c
problem	i
with	c
mobile	c
phones	c
,	c
if	c
I	c
got	i
one	c
I	c
need	c
n't	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
public	c
phones	c
,	c
I	c
save	c
time	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
I	c
can	c
save	c
time	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
think	c
every	i
body	i
should	c
use	c
his	i
saved	i
time	i
for	c
things	c
like	c
hiking	c
,	c
walking	c
,	c
swimming	c
,	c
for	c
a	c
"	c
natural	c
life	c
"	c
and	c
not	c
for	c
a	c
life	c
in	c
a	c
technical	c
world	c
with	c
stress	c
and	c
sorrows	c
because	c
we	c
are	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

I	c
recently	c
visited	c
your	c
theatre	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
"	c
over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
"	c
.	c

Instead	c
of	c
them	c
you	c
had	c
different	c
actors	c
.	c

But	c
in	c
your	c
advertisement	c
you	c
wrote	c
that	c
people	c
can	c
visit	c
the	c
resaurant	i
after	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

Please	c
call	c
me	c
back	c
soon	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

Modern	c
technology	c
has	c
changed	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
in	c
the	c
point	i
that	c
all	i
I	c
do	c
is	c
becoming	c
more	i
comfortable	i
.	c

For	c
example	c
when	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
write	c
a	c
letter	c
or	c
do	c
my	c
homework	c
,	c
I	c
always	c
write	c
it	c
on	c
the	c
computer	c
.	c

If	c
I	c
search	c
something	i
like	c
a	c
telefonnumber	i
or	c
an	c
adress	i
I	c
also	c
look	c
it	c
up	c
from	i
the	c
internet	i
.	c

I	c
use	i
also	i
the	c
internet	i
when	c
I	c
need	c
any	c
informations	i
for	i
example	c
I	i
need	c
them	i
for	c
school	c
or	c
private	i
for	i
myself	c
.	c

Most	i
that	i
took	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
the	c
advantage	c
of	c
modern	c
technology	c
is	c
that	c
all	i
I	c
do	c
goes	c
very	c
fast	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
more	c
time	c
for	c
my	c
hobbys	i
or	c
for	c
friends	c
.	c

Another	c
important	c
point	c
for	c
me	c
is	c
that	c
things	c
like	c
listening	c
music	i
or	c
watching	c
TV	c
sounds	i
better	c
and	c
the	c
pictures	c
on	c
TV	c
are	c
being	c
impoved	i
,	c
because	c
the	c
machines	c
become	c
more	i
better	i
.	c

This	c
event	i
was	c
not	c
the	c
only	c
one	c
because	c
another	c
problem	c
was	c
the	i
respect	i
of	i
the	c
time	c
.	c

Your	c
advertisement	c
said	c
that	c
the	c
show	c
will	i
start	c
at	c
19:30	c
PM	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
has	i
started	i
at	c
20:15	c
PM	c
.	c

The	c
third	c
problem	c
was	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
writting	i
that	c
the	i
discounts	c
were	c
available	c
,	c
but	c
when	c
I	c
get	i
there	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
true	c
.	c

How	c
has	c
modern	c
technology	c
changed	c
your	c
daily	c
life	c
?	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
a	c
car	c
,	c
which	c
is	c
used	c
from	i
everyone	c
everyday	i
,	c
changed	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
in	c
the	c
sens	i
that	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
need	c
my	c
dad	c
or	c
my	c
mum	c
to	c
go	c
to	i
ice-skating	c
or	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
work	c
.	c

This	c
is	c
a	c
good	c
one	c
because	c
you	c
can	c
see	c
what	c
is	c
happening	c
around	c
you	c
and	c
everywhere	c
else	c
on	c
Earth	c
.	c

Naturally	c
technology	c
is	c
everywhere	c
even	c
in	c
the	c
kitchen	c
,	c
for	c
example	c
a	c
special	c
plate	c
or	c
else	i
,	c
and	c
I	c
could	c
talk	c
a	c
lot	c
about	c
them	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
the	c
one	c
here	i
are	i
the	c
most	c
important	c
in	c
the	i
change	i
of	i
my	c
daily	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Ryan	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
information	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
if	c
it	c
is	c
possible	c
to	c
travel	c
to	c
this	c
Camp	i
on	i
July	c
because	c
for	c
me	c
it	c
is	c
the	c
best	c
time	c
and	c
I	c
can	i
not	i
travel	c
before	c
or	c
after	c
according	i
to	c
my	c
employer	c
.	c

I	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
camping	c
.	c

In	i
Basketball	i
I	i
am	i
very	i
good	i
,	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
played	c
in	c
a	c
Basketball-Team	i
for	c
ten	c
years	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
if	c
it	c
is	c
necessary	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
take	c
some	c
clothes	c
with	c
me	c
for	c
the	c
sport	i
activities	c
?	c

Also	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
should	c
take	c
with	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
enjoy	c
shopping	c
when	c
I	c
can	c
buy	c
some	c
clothes	c
.	c

Dear	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
so	c
marvellous	i
about	c
winning	c
the	c
competition	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
answering	i
what	i
you	i
would	i
like	i
to	i
know	i
some	i
information	i
from	i
me	i
.	c

Secondly	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
tent	i
as	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
natural	c
life	c
while	c
I	c
am	c
at	c
the	c
Camp	c
.	c

Thirdly	c
I	c
keen	i
on	c
playing	c
tennis	c
and	c
taking	c
some	c
photography	i
.	c

In	c
spite	c
of	c
the	c
fact	c
that	c
the	c
weathe	i
is	c
bad	c
,	c
I	c
play	c
tennis	c
.	c

Finally	c
I	i
am	c
wondering	c
that	i
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
need	c
for	c
myself	c
and	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
need	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

I	c
know	c
that	i
what	c
my	c
friends	c
think	c
and	c
like	c
.	c

It	i
is	i
real	i
life	i
who	i
we	i
are	i
.	c

During	c
speaking	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
lots	c
of	c
happening	i
such	c
as	c
,	c
some	c
students	c
ca	c
n't	c
understand	c
what	c
the	c
other	c
students	c
say	c
and	c
their	c
culture	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
speaking	c
activity	c
should	c
be	c
filmed	c
as	c
you	c

and	c
funny	i
as	c
well	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Helen	i
Ryan	c
,	c

If	c
it	c
is	c
possible	c
I	i
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
.	c

This	c
is	c
the	c
only	c
month	c
that	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
free	c
.	c

Because	c
I	c
am	c
studying	c
the	i
Management	c
and	c
Finance	c
at	c
university	c
and	c
it	c
will	c
finish	c
at	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
June	c
.	c

I	c
will	c
be	c
in	c
italy	i
in	c
August	c
.	c

I	c
really	c
like	c
staying	i
in	c
tents	c
.	c

It	i
is	i
also	c
written	i
in	c
your	c
letter	c
that	c
we	c
will	c
have	c
to	i
chance	i
to	c
do	c
two	c
activities	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
really	c
good	c
at	c
playing	c
tennis	c
and	c
singing	c
.	c

I	c
play	c
the	c
classicial	i
guitar	c
and	c
I	c
also	c
sing	c
songs	i
.	c

I	c
have	c
been	c
playing	c
the	c
classicial	i
guitar	c
for	c
three	c
years	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
also	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
need	c
.	c

RIGHT	i
TIME	c
FOR	c
SHOPPING	c

Why	c
do	c
people	c
like	c
shopping	c
?	c

Second	i
answer	c
is	c
that	c
the	i
shopping	c
makes	c
everyone	c
happy	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
very	c
relaxing	c
for	c
me	c
but	c
if	i
it	c
is	c
possible	c
to	c
do	c
shopping	i
.	c

I	c
went	c
shopping	c
last	c
week	c
with	c
my	c
friend	c
she	i
needed	c
to	c
buy	c
a	c
nightdress	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
incredibly	c
crowded	c
.	c

She	c
was	c
also	c
very	c
angry	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Ryan	c
,	c

Firstly	c
,	c
you	c
asked	c
me	c
about	i
the	i
period	i
I	c
'd	c
prefer	c
to	c
travel	c
:	i
For	c
me	c
,	c
the	c
only	c
solution	i
is	c
July	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
've	c
already	c
something	c
planned	c
in	c
August	c
.	c

Concerning	c
the	c
accommodation	c
,	c
I	c
'd	c
prefer	c
to	c
spend	c
my	c
nights	c
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
've	c
great	c
difficulty	c
sleeping	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
.	c

And	c
I	c
'm	c
even	c
worse	c
at	c
golf	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
've	c
never	c
been	i
playing	i
it	c
before	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
enjoy	c
discovering	i
new	i
activities	c
!	c

In	c
addition	c
to	c
this	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
be	c
grateful	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
send	c
me	c
information	i
on	c
these	c
few	c
details	i
:	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
is	i
required	c
?	c

And	c
should	c
I	c
take	c
some	c
money	c
with	c
me	c
?	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
will	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
answer	c
my	c
questions	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

"	c
Cry	c
Freedom	c
"	c
,	c
from	i
John	c
Briley	c
,	c
is	c
one	c
of	c
these	c
books	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
you	c
ca	c
n't	c
understand	c
all	c
the	c
links	c
between	c
the	c
events	c
whitout	i
reading	c
the	c
book	c
more	c
than	c
one	i
time	i
.	c

And	c
by	c
understanding	c
the	c
book	c
,	c
you	c
'll	c
also	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
better	c
understand	c
what	c
happens	c
nowadays	c
in	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
countries	c
.	c

Both	c
of	c
them	c
symbolize	c
courage	c
,	c
love	i
of	c
justice	c
,	c
fight	i
for	c
freedom	c
,	c
which	c
makes	c
them	c
look	c
like	c
heroes	c
.	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
's	c
worth	c
reading	c
this	c
book	c
twice	c
,	c
both	c
for	c
a	c
better	c
understanding	c
of	c
our	c
world	c
,	c
and	c
for	c
the	c
symbolical	c
meaning	c
of	c
the	c
story	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
I	i
would	c
like	c
to	c
say	c
something	c
about	c
the	c
starring	i
:	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
because	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
see	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
but	c
once	c
there	c
I	c
found	c
an	c
actor	c
who	c
I	c
had	c
never	c
heard	c
about	i
.	c

Another	c
point	c
is	c
the	c
time	c
when	c
it	c
started	c
,	c
exactly	c
45	c
minutes	c
later	i
.	c

A	c
serious	c
theatre	c
ca	c
n't	c
miss	i
such	i
an	c
important	c
thing	c
,	c
the	c
starting-time	i
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
once	c
I	c
was	c
going	i
to	i
pay	i
for	c
the	c
tickets	c
,	c
I	c
found	c
another	c
thing	c
:	i
there	c
were	c
no	c
discounts	c
avaible	i
.	c

But	c
there	c
is	c
still	c
another	c
point	c
:	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
where	c
I	c
had	c
decided	c
having	i
supper	c
was	c
closed	c
,	c
without	c
saying	i
the	c
reason	c
.	c

This	c
might	c
be	c
the	c
only	c
way	c
I	c
keep	c
on	c
relying	c
on	c
your	c
theatre	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
I	c
will	c
receive	c
an	c
answer	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
,	c
and	c
because	c
of	c
this	c
Pat	c
caused	c
a	c
big	c
,	c
but	c
stupid	c
problem	i
.	c

What	c
could	c
Pat	c
do	c
?	c

In	c
the	c
end	c
Pat	c
phoned	c
Marie	c
and	c
told	c
her	c
:	c
she	c
was	c
a	c
very	c
good	c
friend	c
.	c

Nick	c
was	c
there	c
because	c
the	c
following	c
Sunday	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
very	c
special	c
day	c
for	c
him	c
:	c
he	c
would	c
have	c
been	c
going	c
out	c
with	c
Marie	c
for	c
three	c
years	c
,	c
and	c
he	c
wanted	c
to	c
buy	c
a	c
present	c
for	c
her	c
.	c

She	c
was	c
his	c
cousin	c
!	c

She	c
works	c
as	c
a	c
model	c
,	c
and	c
she	c
was	c
advicing	i
him	c
about	c
which	i
clothes	c
,	c
etc	c
,	c
...	c
buy	i
for	c
her	c
.	c

London	c
,	c
1st	c
of	c
June	c
2000	c

I	c
'm	c
Omadar	c
,	c
a	c
spanish	i
male	c
of	c
eighteen	c
years	c
old	c
who	c
is	c
spending	c
in	i
this	i
town	i
a	i
week	i
holiday	i
.	c

I	c
decided	c
to	c
enjoy	i
a	c
play	c
at	c
the	c
theatre	c
wich	i
you	c
're	c
the	c
manager	c
to	c
see	c
the	i
"	c
London	c
's	c
newest	c
and	c
best	c
musical	c
show.	c
"	c

I	c
had	c
a	c
very	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
.	c

Second	c
,	c
my	c
wife	c
and	c
me	i
payed	i
£	c
20	c
for	c
the	c
tickets	c
and	c
we	c
asked	c
for	c
discounts	c
.	c

The	c
receptionist	c
who	c
gave	c
me	c
the	c
tickets	c
told	c
me	c
that	c
no	c
discounts	c
were	c
able	i
that	c
night	c
.	c

After	c
a	c
boring	c
play	c
,	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
go	c
an	i
theatre	c
restaurant	c
,	c
but	c
uncertainly	i
it	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

Your	i
sincerelly	i
,	c

It	c
's	c
a	c
good	c
question	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
never	i
had	i
asked	i
it	i
to	i
myself	i
.	c

Before	c
modern	c
technologies	c
arrived	c
,	c
you	c
ca	i
n't	i
comunicate	i
as	c
easy	i
as	c
today	i
we	i
can	i
do	i
.	c

An	c
example	c
could	c
be	c
the	c
Internet	c
.	c

It	c
changed	c
my	c
life	c
,	c
because	c
with	c
it	c
I	c
can	c
discover	i
more	c
information	c
than	c
a	i
newspaper	c
,	c
and	c
also	c
information	c
of	i
all	c
around	c
the	c
world	c
,	c
that	i
possibly	i
never	i
I	i
can	i
access	c
without	c
Internet	i
.	c

But	c
,	c
is	i
not	c
only	c
news	c
or	c
information	c
.	c

But	c
,	c
if	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
like	c
to	i
use	i
the	c
keyboard	c
to	c
tell	i
something	c
or	c
comunicate	i
,	c
you	c
can	c
use	c
video	c
conference	i
,	c
a	c
sistem	i
wich	i
you	i
can	i
talk	c
with	c
other	c
people	c
simply	c
with	c
a	c
microphone	c
and	c
speakers	c
.	c

Also	c
is	i
the	c
possibility	i
of	i
download	i
things	c
to	c
your	c
pc	i
like	c
software	c
,	c
pictures	c
and	c
also	i
,	c
music	c
.	c

Who	c
wants	c
to	c
return	c
to	c
the	i
ancient	c
times	c
?	c

I	c
'm	c
afraid	c
that	c
the	c
people	c
on	i
the	i
ancient	c
times	c
lived	c
although	c
they	c
do	i
n't	i
have	c
anything	i
of	c
these	c
things	c
,	c
but	c
me	c
and	c
everyone	c
of	i
this	i
times	c
,	c
I	c
'm	c
afraid	c
that	c
we	c
would	c
n't	c
like	c
return	i
to	c
this	c
life	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
if	c
the	c
price	c
goes	c
down	c
is	i
because	c
anything	i
new	c
is	c
at	c
the	i
moment	i
for	i
sell	i
.	c

Is	i
like	c
a	c
round	i
tour	i
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
'm	c
available	c
for	i
travel	i
only	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
in	c
August	c
I	c
'm	c
going	c
to	c
attend	c
a	c
language	c
course	c
in	c
France	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
based	c
on	c
interviews	c
taken	c
from	c
over	c
80	c
%	c
of	c
my	c
classmates	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
according	c
to	c
the	c
majority	c
of	c
them	c
,	c
latin	i
and	i
greek	i
lessons	c
should	c
be	c
filmed	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
,	c
which	c
I	c
have	c
seen	c
in	c
The	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
on	c
6th	c
June	c
.	c

Another	c
problem	c
was	c
that	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
forty-five	c
minutes	c
late	c
.	c

And	c
I	c
really	i
disappointed	c
from	i
the	c
different	c
actor	c
's	c
performance	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
therefore	c
writing	c
to	c
ask	c
for	c
a	c
full	c
refund	c
.	c

I	c
expect	c
to	c
receive	c
a	c
cheque	c
for	c
£	c
20.	c
look	i
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
soon	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

This	c
is	c
what	c
my	c
friend	c
said	c
the	c
other	c
day	c
when	c
she	c
went	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
show	c
with	c
me	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
It	i
does	c
n't	c
seem	c
to	c
take	c
long	c
for	c
most	c
of	i
young	c
people	c
to	c
get	c
used	c
to	c
it	c
,	c
so	c
we	c
can	c
imagine	c
what	c
clothes	c
will	c
be	c
like	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
.	c

We	c
never	c
know	c
whether	c
we	c
might	c
look	c
like	c
robots	c
because	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
the	c
electronic	c
age	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
expected	c
to	c
see	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
in	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
but	c
he	c
was	c
replaced	c
by	c
another	c
actor	c
.	c

There	c
was	i
also	c
the	c
discounts	c
wich	i
were	c
n't	c
available	c
.	c

And	c
to	c
finish	c
,	c
the	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
,	c
for	c
any	i
reasons	c
you	c
did	c
n't	c
take	i
to	i
us	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
eat	c
this	i
evening	c
.	c

Hoping	c
you	c
'll	c
satisfy	i
my	c
request	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

So	c
the	c
surprise	c
we	c
prepared	c
for	c
the	i
Leon	c
's	c
birthday	c
had	c
failed	c
.	c

But	c
he	c
wanted	c
to	c
stay	c
at	c
his	i
home	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
a	c
friend	c
who	c
had	c
just	c
received	i
a	c
little	c
dog	c
.	c

But	c
he	c
was	c
a	i
Pat	c
's	c
friend	c
too	c
,	c
and	c
Pat	c
explained	c
everything	c
to	c
Leon	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
.	i

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
I	c
am	c
surprise	i
to	c
received	i
the	i
letter	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
,	i
it	c
will	c
be	c
very	i
good	c
time	c
to	c
traveling	i
by	i
without	c
worries	c
.	c

How	i
is	i
about	c
an	i
accommodation	c
.	i

I	c
prefer	c
to	c
live	i
in	c
tents	c
because	c
I	c
feel	c
very	c
natural	c
.	c

Can	c
you	c
imagine	c
how	c
exsiting	i
when	i
we	c
stay	i
in	c
the	c
dark	c
and	c
very	c
quite	i
and	c
we	c
can	c
hear	c
a	i
sound	c
of	c
animal	i
.	c

How	i
's	i
amazing	i
that	c
?	c

How	c
are	c
you	c
?	c

It	c
was	i
very	i
long	c
time	c
as	i
I	c
did	i
n't	i
write	i
the	i
letter	c
to	c
you	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
,	i
you	c
will	c
feel	c
better	c
when	c
you	c
finished	i
my	c
letter	c
.	c

Firstly	c
it	i
is	i
about	c
the	c
hall	c
which	c
they	c
used	c
for	c
concert	i
.	c

It	c
was	c
brillian	i

and	c
put	i
lots	c
of	c
clothes	c
on	c
.	c

That	c
's	c
so	c
good	c
when	c
you	c
have	c
money	i
for	i
joy	i
it	c
but	c
,	c
appart	i
from	c
that	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
many	c
problems	c
.	c

On	i
the	i
one	i
hand	i
,	c
a	c
big	c
problem	c
are	i
the	c
children	c
.	c

When	c
they	c
go	c
to	i
shopping	c
with	c
their	c
mothers	c
,	c
they	c
want	c
to	c
buy	c
all	c
the	c
things	c
that	c
their	i
sight	i
reach	i
:	c
doors	c
,	c
little	c
cars	c
,	c
films	c
...	c
but	c
,	c
when	c
their	c
mothers	c
see	c
a	c
good	c
thing	c
that	c
they	c
want	c
to	c
buy	c
,	c
there	i
are	i
the	i
children	i
:	i
crying	c
because	c
they	c
are	c
tired	c
for	i
shopping	c
all	c
the	i
day	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
do	c
you	c
believe	c
that	c
a	c
shopping	c
bag	i

this	c
one	c
is	c
an	c

?	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
,	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
point	c
out	c
that	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
pleasure	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
take	c
part	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
assure	c
you	c
that	c
I	c
would	i
do	c
my	c
best	c
to	c
be	c
the	i
one	c
of	c
the	c
winners	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
.	c

Now	c
,	c
If	i
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
state	i
some	c
of	c
the	c
information	c
that	c
you	c
may	c
need	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
I	c
can	c
travel	i
only	i
in	c
July	c
this	c
year	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
those	c
kinds	c
of	c
sports	c
and	c
think	c
that	c
I	c
could	c
be	c
the	c
winner	c
.	c

But	c
,	c
is	c
n't	c
it	c
a	c
kind	c
of	c
entertaintment	i
?	c

A	c
lot	c
of	c
people	c
,	c
especially	c
women	c
,	c
go	c
to	c
do	c
their	c
shopping	c
only	c
for	c
fan	i
.	c

But	c
,	c
what	c
about	c
real	c
shopping	c
.	i

It	c
's	c
a	c
real	c
nightmare	c
when	c
you	c
try	c
to	c
match	c
everything	c
:	c
from	c
the	c
size	c
,	c
the	c
colour	c
to	c
the	c
sawings	i
of	c
the	c
suit	c
that	c
is	c
acceptable	c
for	c
everyone	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
really	c
wonderful	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
a	c
student	c
at	c
Portsmouth	c
College	c
and	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
this	c
term	c
is	c
23	c
June	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
can	c
only	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
.	c

And	c
for	i
my	c
accommodation	c
.	i

I	c
prefer	i
live	i
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
,	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
more	c
comfortable	c
.	c

I	c
like	i
to	c
relax	c
there	c
and	c
enjoy	c
the	c
atmosphere	c
when	i
I	c
live	i
in	i
.	c

Before	c
I	c
came	c
England	i
,	c
I	c
swam	c
every	c
weekend	c
in	c
my	c
country	c
even	i
in	c
winter	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
choose	c
to	c
do	c
some	c
swimming	c
and	c
sailing	c
while	c
I	c
am	c
at	c
the	c
camp	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
your	c

I	c
read	c

However	c
,	c
it	c

Firstly	c
,	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
did	c
not	c
act	i
as	c
you	c

said	i

A	c
different	c
actor	c
acted	i
in	i
stead	i
of	c
him	c
.	c

it	i
was	c
disappointing	c

It	c
should	c
have	c
started	c
at	c
19:30	c
as	c
you	c
said	c
at	i
advertisement	i
,	c
or	i
you	c
should	c

The	c

Dear	c
Kim	c

The	c
job	c
came	c
unexpectedly	c
as	c
my	c
friend	c
,	c
who	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
work	c
there	c
,	c
broke	c
her	c
leg	c
just	c
two	c
days	c
before	c
the	c
event	c
.	c

So	c
she	c
asked	c
me	c
to	c
fill	c
her	c
position	c
.	c

Even	c
I	i
had	c
planned	c
something	c
else	c
to	c
do	c
I	c
agreed	c
because	c
she	c
's	c
my	c
very	c
good	c
friend	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
very	c
hectic	c
there	c
as	c
everyone	c
was	c
a	c
bit	c
nervous	c
but	c
I	c
saw	c
the	c
main	c
stars	c
and	c
even	c
managed	c
to	c
talk	c
to	c
them	c
.	c

When	c
they	c
started	c
to	c
play	c
I	c
was	c
told	c
to	c
change	c
my	c
post	c
again	c
.	c

This	c
time	c
I	c
was	c
helping	c
the	c
medical	c
workers	c
who	c
had	c
full	i
hands	i
with	c
fainted	i
teenage	i
girls	i
.	c

First	c
,	c
it	c
seemed	c
to	c
me	c
odd	c
because	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
understand	c
why	c
they	c
faint	i
,	c
but	c
as	c
the	c
concert	c
went	c
on	c
,	c
the	c
heat	c
in	c
the	c
air	c
was	c
increasing	c
and	c
so	c
was	c
the	c
number	c
of	c
the	c
fainted	i
.	c

It	c
was	c
n't	c
funny	c
anymore	c
and	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
know	c
what	c
to	c
do	c
first	c
.	c

I	c
actually	c
injoyed	i
it	c
working	c
there	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
n't	c
hesitate	c
to	c
work	c
there	c
again	c
.	c

Dear	c
Ms	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
guess	c
you	c
can	c
imagine	c
how	c
happy	c
and	c
excited	c
I	c
am	c
at	i
this	i
time	i
.	c

Here	c
are	i
the	c
few	i
information	c
about	c
my	c
stay	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
,	i
that	c
you	c
asked	c
my	i
to	c
complete	i
:	c

Two	c
weeks	c
in	c
the	c
USA	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
great	c
occasion	i
for	c
me	c
to	c
relax	c
after	c
that	c
.	c

You	c
asked	c
my	i
to	c
chose	i
my	c
accommodation	c
between	i
tents	i
and	i
cabins	c
.	c

Could	c
you	c
please	c
tell	c
me	c
if	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
special	i
clothes	c
with	c
me	c
.	i

If	c
it	c
's	c
not	c
two	i
much	c
to	c
ask	c
,	c
could	c
you	c
also	c
tell	c
me	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
should	c
take	c
with	c
me	c
for	c
food	c
or	c
evening	c
activities	c
at	c
the	c
camp	c

Looking	i
for	i
you	i
to	i
receive	i
those	i
information	i
,	c

The	c
shoes	c
of	c
my	c
dreams	c
(	c
well	c
designed	c
and	c
not	c
too	c
expensive	c
)	c
So	i
I	c
went	c
back	c
to	c
the	c
station	c
,	c
very	c
proud	c
of	c
me	i
with	c
my	c
sneakers	c
in	c
a	c
white	c
plastic	c
bag	c
and	c
a	c
great	c
smile	c
on	c
my	c
face	c
.	c

As	c
I	c
jumped	c
off	c
the	c
train	c
,	c
I	c
met	c
a	c
friend	c
of	c
mine	c
.	c

Oh	c
my	c
god	c
!	c

There	c
was	c
no	c
more	c
plastic	c
bag	c
,	i
I	c
had	c
forgotten	i
it	c
in	i
the	c
train	c
!	c

It	c
seems	c
like	c
I	c
will	c
have	c
to	c
play	c
with	i
old	c
shoes	c
for	c
one	c
more	c
summer	c
...	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
I	c
had	i
another	c
trip	c
to	i
Spain	c
in	i
August	c
,	c
that	i
is	c
the	c
perfect	c
month	c
for	c
me	c
,	c
otherwise	c
I	c
would	c
not	c
travel	c
to	c
Spain	c
.	c

The	c
two	c
activities	c
which	c
I	c
find	i
better	i
for	c
me	c
are	c
swimming	c
and	c
sailing	c
.	c

Could	c
you	c
give	c
me	c
some	c
advice	c
about	c
the	c
weather	c
in	c
California	c
?	c

Yours	c

Dear	c
Kim	c

However	c
this	i
year	c
was	c
n't	c
like	c
last	c
year	c
.	c

My	c
job	c
was	c
as	i
simple	i
as	i
selling	c
ice-creams	c
.	c

You	c
might	c
say	c
that	c
it	c
is	i
quite	c
boring	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
so	i
funny	i
.	c

It	c
was	c
amazing	i
experience	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
held	c
at	c
the	c
'	c
Central	c
Exhibition	c
Hall	c
'	c
on	c
14	c
March.	c
,	c
from	c
10	c
A.M.	c
to	c
7	c
P.M.	c
Therefore	c
we	c
could	c
go	c
there	c
after	c
the	c
Science	c
Museum	c
.	c

Because	c
we	c
have	c
a	i
free	c
time	c
on	c
15	c
March	c
afternoon	i
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
will	c
consider	c
my	c
suggestion	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c

A	c
robot	c
wakes	c
me	c
up	c
at	c
7	c
A.M.	c
every	c
morning	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
served	c
breakfast	c
with	c
fresh	c
coffee	c
.	c

Washing	c
and	c
cleaning	c
have	c
been	i
already	i
done	c
by	c
my	c
robot	c
maid	c
!	c

They	c
can	c
clean	c
the	c
house	c
but	c
they	c
can	i
not	i
give	c
the	i
affection	c
to	c
the	c

But	c
these	c
robots	c
can	i
not	i
be	i
replaced	i
of	i

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
provide	c
you	c
with	c
the	c
information	c
that	c
you	c
require	c
to	c
arrange	c
my	c
two	i
week	i
holidays	i
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
in	c
the	c
U.S.A	c

It	c
is	c
said	c
that	c
shopping	c
is	c
becoming	c
a	c
new	c
way	c
of	c
life	c
for	c
more	c
and	c
more	c
people	c
in	c
the	c
developed	c
countries	c
.	c

Let	c
us	c
then	c
ask	c
:	c
'	c
Is	c
this	c
activitie	i
always	c
enjoyable	c
?	c
'	c

However	c
,	c
this	c
apparently	c
quite	i
and	c
relaxed	c
activitie	i
can	c
sometimes	c
turn	c
into	c
a	c
living	c
hell	c
;	c
you	c
may	c
only	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
go	c
shopping	c
at	c
the	c
weekend	c
and	c
then	c
,	c
if	c
you	c
do	c
go	c
,	c
you	c
will	c
find	c
yourself	c
in	c
the	c
middle	c
of	c
a	c
huge	c
crowd	c
of	c
people	c
,	c
unable	c
to	c
get	c
to	c
any	c
product	c
or	c
even	c
shop	c
and	c
feeling	c
dizzy	c
by	i
the	c
mixture	c
of	c
smells	c
that	c
come	c
from	c
the	c
people	c
.	c

First	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
come	c
there	c
only	c
July	i
because	c
of	c
my	c
examination	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
it	c
in	c
June	c
,	c
and	c
my	c

After	c
he	c

Dear	c
Manager	c
:	c
I	c
am	c
Angela	c
Ounis	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
writting	i
to	c
you	c
because	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
see	c
'	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
'	c
,	c
London	c
's	c
newest	c
and	c
best	c
musical	c
show	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
the	i
starring	i
that	c
was	i
supposed	c
to	c
be	c
(	i
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
)	c
were	c
n't	c
there	c
,	i
I	c
was	c
so	c
enthusiastic	c
about	c
your	c
starring	i
,	c
when	c
I	c
realized	c
was	i
a	i
failure	i
,	c
even	c
though	c
they	i
do	i
good	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
the	c
same	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
so	c
disappointed	c
with	c
this	c
,	i
that	c
I	c
am	c
in	i
all	i
my	i
right	i
to	c
ask	c
for	c
some	c
money	c
back	c
,	c
your	c
theatre	c
show	c
was	c
n't	c
expected	i
.	c

How	c
has	c
modern	c
technology	c
changed	c
your	c
daily	c
life	c
?	c

I	c
am	c
17	c
years	c
old	c
,	c
and	c
my	c
life	c
has	c
been	c
very	c
normal	c
.	c

Since	c
I	i
've	i
got	i
a	c
computer	c
with	c
Internet	i
,	c
my	c
social	c
life	c
has	c
changed	c
.	c

This	c
has	c
opened	c
another	c
world	c
to	c
me	c
,	c
distances	c
are	c
n't	c
so	c
sad	c
,	c
they	c
are	c
more	i
close	i
.	c

I	c
have	c
learned	c
a	c
lot	c
with	c
Internet	i
,	i
it	i
gaves	i
me	c
the	c
posibility	i
to	c
know	c
more	c
about	c
things	c
I	i
've	i
never	i
knew	i
.	i

Now	c
I	c
have	c
a	c
different	c
style	i
of	i
life	i
,	c
I	c
am	c
more	c
open	c
to	c
world	i
's	c
problems	c
and	c
progress	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
interesting	i
in	c
reading	c
articles	c
and	c
developing	c
myself	c
.	c

Technology	c
had	i
gave	i
me	c
another	c
life	c
,	c
has	i
helped	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
modern	c
technology	c
is	c
our	c
future	c
,	c
we	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
to	c
depend	c
on	c
it	c
,	c
but	c
we	c
have	c
to	c
work	c
for	c
a	i
biggest	c
improvement	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
my	i
cousin	c
,	c
who	c
lives	c
there	c
,	c
had	c
had	c
many	c
problems	c
with	c
the	c
tickets	c
.	c

The	c
starring	i
changed	i
and	c
this	i
was	c
the	c
worst	c
surprise	c
I	c
could	c
have	c
.	i

But	c
instead	c
of	c
him	c
there	c
was	c
a	i
unknown	c
young	c
actor	c
.	c

What	c
a	c
pity	c
,	c
I	c
thought	c
.	c

What	c
an	c
absurd	c
thing	c
,	c
do	c
n't	c
you	c
think	c
so	c
?	c

The	c
quality	c
of	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
n't	c
as	c
high	c
as	c
I	c
expected	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
n't	c
tought	i
for	i
a	c
restaurant	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
because	c
if	c
the	c
advertisement	c
had	c
been	c
right	c
,	c
there	c
should	c
had	i
to	i
be	i
a	c
luxury	c
restaurant	c
where	c
I	c
could	c
eat	c
.	c

To	c
apologise	c
and	c
give	c
the	c
impression	c
of	c
being	c
a	c
serious	c
theatre	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
that	c
my	c
wish	i
is	c
being	i
accepted	i
.	c

We	c
are	c
in	c
the	c
ages	i
of	c
the	i
technologic	i
development	c
it	i
's	i
out	i
of	i
doubt	i
.	c

Since	c
the	c
scientific	c
revolution	c
and	c
the	c
Industrial	c
Revolution	c
,	c
between	c
17th	i
and	c
18th	c
century	i
there	c
have	c
been	c
sudden	c
changes	c
in	c
our	c
daily	c
way	i
of	i
living	i
.	c

Nowadays	c
especially	i
in	c
the	c
west	i
area	c
of	c
the	c
world	c
science	i
and	c
technology	c
have	c
done	i
great	c
,	c
enormous	c
steps	c
in	c
directions	i
of	i
the	i
progress	c
.	c

Not	c
only	c
for	c
the	c
great	c
nations	c
,	c
but	c
also	c
for	c
every	i
their	i
inhabitants	c
.	c

I	c
can	c
buy	c
,	c
today	c
,	c
a	c
book	c
being	i
comfortable	c
at	c
home	c
,	c
can	c
communicate	c
with	c
other	c
friends	c
faster	c
than	c
before	c

I	c
can	i
have	i
my	i
homeworks	i
done	i
by	i
a	i
calculator	i
etc.	c
In	c
future	i
I	c
wish	i
I	c
could	c
fly	c
on	c
my	c
own	c
!	c

I	c
think	c
I	c
should	i
become	i
crazy	c
without	c
them	c
,	c
not	c
only	c
me	c
but	c
the	c
majority	c
of	c
us	c
.	c

Vico	c
says	c
that	c
progress	c
gives	i
up	i
when	c
Man	c
have	i
noticed	c
that	c
he	c
have	i
been	c
wasting	c
those	c
values	c

we	c
saw	c
last	c

in	c
the	c
Oxfor	c

one	i

about	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
,	c

The	c
reason	c
of	i
my	c
letter	c
,	i
is	c
that	c
our	c
class	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
suggest	c
a	c
few	c
changes	c
on	i
our	c
programme	c
of	i
London	c
,	c
because	c
we	c
have	c
seen	c
an	c
advertisement	c
about	c
an	c
interesting	c
activity	c
that	c
we	c
could	c
include	c
in	c
our	c
programme	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
we	c
want	c
to	c
say	c
thanks	c
to	c
you	c
because	c
we	c
know	c
the	c
effort	c
you	c
have	c
done	i
organising	c
our	i
good	i
programme	c
,	c
but	c
we	c
would	c
really	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
London	c
fashion	c
and	c
leisure	c
show	c
we	c
saw	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
.	c

We	c
think	c
that	c
perhaps	c
in	i
Tuesday	c
March	c
14	c
,	i
we	c
could	c
change	c
the	c
time	c
of	i
going	i
to	c
Science	i
Museum	c
,	c
and	c
(	i
we	i
)	i
go	c
earlier	i
to	i
the	i
Museum	i
,	c
such	i
as	i
half	c
past	c
eight	c
on	i
the	c
morning	c
,	c
so	c
we	c
could	c
go	c
after	i
,	c
at	c
ten	c
o'clock	c
to	i
the	c
show	c
,	c
and	c
we	c
could	c
also	c
delay	c
going	c
shopping	c
on	c
that	c
afternoon	c
,	c
because	c
the	c
show	c
lasts	c
til	i
seven	c
o'clock	c
on	i
the	c
evening	c
.	c

And	c
we	c
have	i
thought	i
that	c
we	c
could	c
go	c
shopping	c
the	c
next	c
day	c
,	c
because	c
we	c
do	i
not	i
have	i
nothing	i
to	c
do	c
on	c
that	c
afternoon	c
.	c

Please	c
,	c
let	c
us	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
for	i
students	c
are	c
free	i
.	c

I	c
Look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
the	c
home	c
of	c
the	c
Future	c
would	c
probably	c
be	c
better	c
than	c
it	i
is	c
now	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
future	c
,	c
our	c
homes	c
will	c
have	i
the	c
most	c
advanced	c
technologies	c
.	c

Books	c
will	c
gradually	c
disappear	c
,	c
and	c
instead	c
we	c
will	c
read	c
all	c
the	c
things	c
we	c
want	c
in	i
our	c
computer	c
.	c

I	c
received	c
your	c
letter	c
which	i
says	c
I	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
-	c
two	c
weeks	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
in	c
the	c
U.S.A.	c
I	c
apreicate	i
it	i
and	c
I	c
thank	c
you	c
a	i
lot	i
that	i
you	i
have	i
chosen	c
me	c
as	c
a	c
winner	c
.	c

Also	c
,	c
I	c
prefer	c
swimming	c
and	c
painting	c
.	c

What	c
about	c
the	c
clothes	c
,	i
you	i
do	c
n't	c
mention	c
anything	c
.	i

I	c
am	c
a	c
member	c
in	i
the	c
council	c
team	c
so	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
help	c
them	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
that	c
was	c
organized	c
in	i
the	i
last	c
month	c
.	c

I	c
helped	c
them	c
to	c
prepare	c
the	c
room	c
for	c
the	c
bads	i
and	c
I	c
decorated	c
the	c
place	c
for	c
the	c
singers	c
.	c

It	c
took	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
to	c
testifite	i
the	c
speakers	c
and	c
the	c
microphones	c
.	c

Unless	i
this	c
preparation	c
,	c
I	c
also	c
took	i
part	i
to	i
the	c
concert	c
.	c

I	c
understood	i
it	c
when	c
the	c
concert	c
had	c
finished	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
some	i
thing	i
that	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
expect	c
.	c

I	c
enjoyed	c
very	i
much	c
and	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
tranfere	i
my	c
enjoyment	i
to	c
you	c
though	i
this	c
letter	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
happy	c
to	c
visit	c
the	c
United	c
States	c
under	i
your	c
organisation	c
.	c

Actually	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
Camp	c
California	c
next	c
July	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
got	c
two	c
weeks	i
holiday	c
then	c
.	c

My	c
experience	c
in	i
camping	c
is	c
not	c
so	c
huge	c
to	i
stay	c
in	c
tents	i
for	c
2	c
weeks	c
.	c

Surfing	c
is	c
something	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
ever	i
wanted	c
to	c
try	c
.	c

As	i
you	i
can	i
see	i
,	i
I	c
have	c
abosolutly	i
no	c
experience	c
in	c
it	c
.	c

So	c
that	i
my	c
level	i
is	c
not	c
beginners	i
anymore	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
could	c
you	c
please	c
tell	c
me	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
should	c
take	c
with	c
me	c
?	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

Excuse	i
me	i
that	i
I	i
did	i
n't	i
write	i
you	c
sooner	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
know	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
fairly	c
busy	c
with	c
my	i
studying	c
for	c
my	c
First	c
Certificate	c
.	c

The	c
concert	c
was	c
absolute	i
marvellous	c
!	c

I	c
liked	c
to	i
see	i
their	c
way	c
of	c
life	c
.	c

To	c
.	c

Hi	c
.	c

And	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
inform	c
you	c
that	c
something	c
is	c
not	c
right	c
and	c
unfair	i
about	c
your	c
theatre	c
.	c

I	c
recently	c
had	c
a	c
week	c
's	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

Which	i
so	i
called	i
"	i
Rip	i
off	i
"	i
.	i

First	c
of	c
all	c
you	i
said	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
is	i
in	c
the	c
play	c
but	c
different	i
actor	c
was	c
in	c
the	c
roll	i
.	c

It	c
was	c
just	c
unbelievably	c
disappointing	c
because	c
the	c
reason	c
I	i
mean	c
main	i
reason	c
which	i
made	c
me	c
to	i
go	i
was	c
to	c
see	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
.	c

Secondly	c
about	i
the	c
time	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
freezing	c
out	i
side	i
and	c
I	c
got	c
horrible	i
cold	c
for	i
that	c
.	c

For	c
me	c
,	c
It	c
's	c
not	c
easy	c
to	c
have	i
holiday	i
and	c
your	c
play	c
just	c
blew	c
my	c
precious	c
time	c
away	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
thing	i
your	c
play	c
worth	c
£	c
20.00	c
.	c

Your	c
advertisment	i
was	c
un	i
fair	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
not	c
asking	c
for	c
full	c
payment	c
but	c
minimum	i
50	c
%	c
that	i
it	i
paid	c
for	c
nothing	c
but	c
the	c
disappoint	i
.	c

Yours	c

Fashion	c
of	c
the	c
future	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
say	c
fashion	c
is	c
Artistic	c
insperation	i
which	c
expressed	i
by	c
fabric	c
and	c
all	c
sort	i
of	c
material	c
.	c

Now	i
a	i
days	i
fashion	c
play	i
big	i
roll	i
in	c
our	c
daily	c
life	c
.	c

As	c
I	c
said	c
before	c
,	c
fashion	c
is	c
somehow	c
influenced	c
by	c
science	c
and	c
insperations	i
that	c
we	c
get	c
from	c
all	c
sort	i
of	c
enviroment	i
.	c

For	c
example	c
Castum	i
of	i
Astronuts	i
.	c

Frankly	c
we	c
ca	c
n't	c
because	c
we	c
think	c
it	c
's	c
too	c
odd	c
or	c
strange	c
.	c

But	c
what	c
about	c
100	c
year	i
later	c
?	c

I	c
think	c
people	i
'll	i
wear	c
those	c
spacy	i
and	c
Ciber	i
looking	i
cloth	i
after	c
a	c
centry	i
.	c

Can	c
you	c
imagin	i
you	c
and	c
your	c
friends	c
going	c
picnic	i
to	c
the	c
Moon	c
with	c
silvery	i
skirt	c
with	c
Astronut	i
boots	c
with	c
fire	c
coming	c
out	c
at	c
the	c
bottom	c
of	c
your	c
boots	c
?	c

It	c
could	c
be	c
more	c
facinating	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
let	c
you	c
know	c
that	c
I	c
can	c
only	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
that	c
is	c
the	c
only	c
time	c
I	c
can	c
take	c
leave	i
from	c
work	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
the	c
log	c
cabins	c
as	c
I	c
would	c
be	c
afraid	c
of	c
insects	c
or	c
any	c
crawling	c
animals	c
if	c
I	c
have	i
to	c
stay	c
in	c
the	c
tent	c
.	c

For	c
activities	c
choices	i
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
choose	c
Tennis	c
and	c
swimming	c
.	c

I	c
used	c
to	c
play	c
Tennis	c
at	c
tournament	c
level	c
and	c
now	c
I	c
play	c
it	c
for	c
enjoyment	c
instead	c
.	c

Swimming	c
is	c
my	c
best	i
way	c
of	c
excercise	i
and	c
keeping	c
fit	c
.	c

I	c
've	c
a	c
few	c
questions	c
to	c
ask	c
.	c

Since	c
all	c
accommodation	c
and	c
travel	c
costs	c
are	c
paid	c
for	c
,	c
Are	i
there	c
any	c
other	c
expenses	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
pay	i
?	c

How	c
much	c
money	c
I	i
should	i
have	c
with	c
me	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
cover	c
all	c
other	c
expenses	c
?	c

Thank	c
you	c
once	c
again	c
for	c
giving	c
me	c
good	i
news	c
!	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

I	c
find	c
shopping	c
is	c
the	i
most	i
time	c
consuming	c
.	c

If	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
buy	c
a	c
nice	c
pair	c
of	c
shoe	i
,	c
I	i
'll	i
have	i
to	c
go	c
into	c
a	c
city	c
centre	c
and	c
browse	c
around	c
from	c
shops	i
to	i
shops	i
until	c
I	c
find	c
the	c
shoes	c
I	c
like	c
.	c

At	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
the	c
day	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
not	c
only	c
be	c
carrying	c
pile	i
of	c
shopping	c
bags	c
but	c
also	c
trying	c
to	c
squeeze	c
in	c
between	c
other	c
passengers	c
on	c
the	c
train	c
on	c
my	c
way	c
home	c
.	c

DEAR	c
SIR	c

IT	c
WAS	c
COMPLETELY	c
WRONG	c
!	c

SECONDLY	c
,	c
AS	c
I	c
WROTE	c
BEFORE	c
,	c
THE	c
PLAY	c
STARTED	c
LATE	c
,	c
AND	c
FOR	c
ME	c
IT	c
WAS	c
TERRIBLE	c
TO	c
WAIT	c
FORTY	i
FIVE	i
MINUTES	c
.	c

FINALLY	c
I	c
COULD	c
N'T	c
EAT	c
TOO	i
.	c

IN	c
FACT	c
THE	c
RESTAURANT	c
WAS	c
CLOSED	c
,	c
VERY	i
FAR	i
FROM	i
MY	i
THOUGHTS	i
.	c

BECAUSE	c
FOR	c
ME	c
IT	c
WAS	c
NOT	c
A	c
"	c
PERFECT	c
EVENING	c
OUT	c
"	c
.	c

I	c
LOOK	c
FORWARD	c
TO	c
HEARING	c
FROM	c
YOU	c
.	c

THIS	c
WAS	c
LIKE	c
AN	c
ILLNESS	c
FOR	c
HIM	c
.	c

SO	c
MANY	c
TIME	i
HE	c
WAS	c
TOLD	c
:	c
"	c
PAT	c
I	i
SAY	i
THIS	c
SECRET	c
ONLY	c
TO	c
YOU	c
"	c
.	c

PAT	c
COULD	c
STAND	c
THIS	c
SECRET	c
ONLY	c
FEW	i
DAYS	c
,	c
AFTER	c
THE	i
SECRET	c
COME	i
FROM	c
THE	i
DEEP	c
INSIDE	c
,	c
AND	c
HAD	c
TO	c
BE	c
SAID	c
.	c

HE	c
WANTED	c
TO	c
DIE	c
FOR	i
THIS	c
.	c

ONE	c
DAY	c
THE	i
FORTUNE	c
HELPED	c
OUR	c
POOR	c
PAT	c
.	c

WHEN	c
THE	c
ROBBER	c
UNDERSTOOD	i
HE	c
COULD	c
BE	c
DISCOVERED	c
HE	i
SAID	c
"	i
IF	c
YOU	c
DO	c
N'T	c
KEEP	c
THE	i
SECRET	c
I	c
WILL	c
KILL	c
YOU	c
"	c
.	c

PAT	c
,	c
AS	c
HE	c
ALWAYS	c
DID	c
,	c
COULD	c
N'T	c
KEEP	c
THE	c
SECRET	c
,	c
EVEN	c
IF	c
HE	c
WAS	c
SCARED	c
.	c

EVENTUALLY	c
THE	c
ROBBER	c
WAS	c
CAUGHT	c
BY	c
THE	c
POLICE	c
,	c
AND	c
FOR	c
HIS	c
BRAVE	i
AND	c
HONESTY	c
HE	c
HAD	c
A	c
LOT	c
OF	c
FRIENDS	c
.	c

I	c
have	i
always	i
a	c
good	i
approach	c
with	c
all	c
of	c
the	c
most	c
recent	c
invenctions	i
or	c
any	c
other	c
kind	c
of	c
modern	c
applications	i
.	c

We	c
live	c
in	c
the	c
age	c
of	c
personal	c
computers	c
,	c
of	c
internet	i
,	c
of	c
the	c
mobile	c
phones	i
,	c
and	c
now	c
for	c
me	c
it	c
's	c
impossible	c
to	c
think	c
of	c
a	c
world	c
without	c
them	c
.	c

Then	c
,	c
surfing	c
in	i
internet	i
is	c
becoming	c
my	c
passion	c
:	c
it	c
's	c
incredible	c
how	c
many	c
unthinkable	c
activities	c
you	c
can	c
do	c
with	c
it	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
simply	c
fantastic	c
!	c

I	c
have	i
expected	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
to	c
perform	c
and	c
it	c
was	c
extremely	c
disappointing	c
.	c

Also	c
,	c
the	c
times	c
printed	c
on	i
your	c
advertisment	i
was	i
14.30	c
and	c
19:30	c
.	c

I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
19:30	c
show	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
did	c
not	c
start	c
until	c
it	c
was	c
20:15	c
.	c

On	i
your	c
advertisment	i
,	c
it	c
said	c
that	c
discounts	c
were	c
available	c
for	c
the	c
tickets	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
rather	c
thirsty	c
and	c
hungry	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
and	c
on	i
your	c
advertisment	i
,	i
it	i
made	c
a	c
cup	c
of	c
tea	c
and	c
some	c
cakes	c
in	c
your	c
restaurant	c
sound	c
rather	c
inviting	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

How	c
could	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
so	c
stupid	c
,	c
so	c
blind	c
not	i
to	c
see	c
her	c
disability	i
to	c
keep	c
the	c
biggest	c
secret	c
about	c
my	c
biggest	c
crush	c
ever	c
?	c

I	c
moved	c
away	c
that	c
year	c
,	c
away	i
to	c
a	c
whole	c
new	c
place	c
and	c
a	c
whole	c
new	c
school	c
.	c

My	c
dad	c
began	c
packing	c
his	c
things	c
the	c
very	c
next	c
day	c
,	c
to	i
his	c
new	c
apartment	c
where	c
he	c
would	c
live	c
while	c
waiting	c
for	c
the	c
divorce	c
papers	c
and	i
signing	i
them	i
.	c

That	c
period	c
of	c
my	c
life	c
was	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
worst	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
the	c
person	c
who	c
helped	c
me	c
through	c
this	c
hard	c
time	c
was	c
,	c
surprisingly	c
,	c
Pat	c
.	c

She	c
was	c
a	c
person	c
I	c
could	c
turn	c
to	c
,	c
I	c
could	c
trust	c
.	c

She	c
let	c
me	c
pour	c
out	c
my	c
feelings	c
,	c
a	c
thing	c
I	c
did	c
not	c
do	c
to	i
anyone	c
.	c

Ever	c
since	c
,	c
she	c
gained	i
my	c
trust	c
and	c
told	i
her	c
my	c
feelings	c
and	c
secrets	c
.	c

She	c
kept	c
every	c
single	c
one	c
of	c
my	c
secrets	c
well	c
,	c
and	c
not	i
surprisingly	c
,	c
she	c
became	c
my	c
best	c
friend	c
.	c

My	c
happiness	c
was	c
short	i
lived	i
.	c

The	c
news	c
shook	c
me	c
to	c
the	c
very	c
core	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
,	c

The	c
show	c
is	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
at	c
the	c
Central	c
Exhibition	c
Hall	c
the	i
14th	c
of	c
March	c
from	c
10.00	c
to	c
19.00	c
.	c

There	i
will	i
be	i
shown	i
the	c
latest	c
fashions	c
,	c
leisure	i
and	c
sportwear	i
,	c
some	c
make	i
up	i
and	c
also	c
different	c
hairstyles	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
a	c
natural	c
reaccion	i
to	c
be	c
angry	c
with	c
somebody	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
trust	c
for	c
gossiping	c
and	i
bothering	i
your	i
personal	i
thoughts	i
.	c

So	c
I	c
think	c
famous	c
people	c
,	c
no	c
matter	c
if	c
they	c
are	c
politicians	c
or	c
films	i
stars	c
do	i
n't	c
deserve	c
being	i
followed	c
by	c
journalists	c
every	c
time	c
they	c
are	c
trying	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
good	c
time	c
.	c

Sometimes	c
the	c
journalit	i
's	i
aim	c
is	c
n't	c
the	c
money	c
:	c
there	c
are	c
some	c
journalists	c
who	c
may	c
try	c
to	c
spoil	c
the	i
politician	c
's	c
or	c
film	c
star	c
's	c
career	c
only	c
because	c
they	c
are	c
jealous	c
.	c

First	c
the	c
musical	i
show	c
,	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
started	i
at	c
20:15	c
,	c
and	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
was	i
written	c
at	i
19:30	c
,	i
then	i
also	i
was	i
written	c
that	c
the	c
actor	c
was	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
but	c
in	c
the	c
show	c
appeared	i
a	i
different	i
actor	i
,	c
that	c
was	c
really	c
disappointing	c
.	c

And	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
time	c
that	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
went	i
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

Mr	i
,	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
disappointed	c
with	c
the	c
show	c
so	c
I	c
want	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
sure	c
you	c
will	c
understand	c
my	c
reasons	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
,	c
and	c
she	c
went	c
to	c
her	c
house	c
to	c
speak	i
about	c
the	c
things	c
I	c
had	c
told	c
her	c
.	c

First	c
she	c
said	c
to	c
her	c
father	c
,	c
then	c
to	c
her	c
mother	c
and	c
finally	c
to	c
her	c
brother	c
,	c
that	c
I	c
was	c
from	c
another	c
planet	c
called	c
Orion	c
,	c
that	c
was	c
a	c
billion	c
kilometer	i
distance	i
of	i
Earth	c
and	c
that	i
I	c
was	c
so	c
ashamed	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
his	i
boyfriend	c
since	c
I	c
have	i
came	i
to	c
Earth	c
.	c

The	c
police	c
caught	c
me	c
,	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
peacefully	c
in	c
my	c
room	c
,	c
and	c
put	c
me	c
covered	i
with	c
something	c
,	c
in	c
a	c
car	c
.	c

After	c
they	c
caught	c
me	c
I	c
think	c
they	c
brought	c
me	c
to	c
the	i
Area	c
57	c
,	c
were	i
the	c
police	c
do	c
experiments	c
.	c

Since	c
then	c
I	c
live	i
in	c
Area	c
57	c
,	c
and	c
this	c
is	c
my	c
diary	c
life	i
.	c

Dear	c
Jane	c
Clark	c
,	c

I	c
'm	c
writting	i
to	c
you	c
because	c
I	i
've	i
been	i
in	i
the	c
International	c
Arts	c
Festival	c
and	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
pleasure	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
I	c
must	c
tell	c
you	c
that	c
some	c
concert	c
halls	c
are	c
too	c
small	c
,	c
so	c
you	c
ca	c
n't	c
be	c
enough	i
confortable	i
to	c
apreciate	i
the	c
event	c
.	c

Other	i
thing	c
,	i
is	c
that	c
the	c
artists	c
come	c
only	c
from	c
six	c
countries	c
,	c
so	c
do	c
n't	c
cheat	i
the	i
people	c
by	c
saying	c
that	c
they	c
are	c
from	c
all	c
the	i
world	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
you	c
should	c
call	i
more	c
artist	i
from	c
other	c
countries	c
and	c
have	c
some	c
concert	i
halls	i
bigger	i
or	c
may	i
be	i
change	c
the	c
distribution	c
.	c

Well	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
everything	i
is	i
told	i
but	c
could	c
you	c
tell	c
me	c
,	c
if	c
it	i
's	i
possible	c
,	c
if	c
there	c
will	c
be	c
more	c
plays	c
and	c
films	c
next	c
year	c
?	c

As	c
you	c
want	i
me	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
how	i
about	i
the	i
rules	i
are	i
here	i
,	c
I	c
'll	c
start	c
.	c

You	c
must	c
pay	i
attention	i
always	i
because	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
if	c
the	c
teacher	c
will	c
ask	c
you	c
some	c
question	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
home	c
I	c
can	c
avoid	c
that	i
rules	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
go	c
dancing	c
whenever	c
I	c
want	c
but	c
telling	i
her	c
previously	i
.	c

My	c
mum	c
is	c
a	c
lovely	c
woman	c
and	c
she	c
does	c
n't	c
know	c
how	c
much	c
I	c
love	c
her	c
because	c
most	c
of	c
the	c
day	c
I	c
'm	c
outside	c
,	c
but	c
that	c
's	c
the	c
true	i
.	c

My	c
father	c
is	c
a	c
bit	c
jealous	c
but	c
agrees	c
with	c
what	c
my	c
mum	c
says	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
I	c
'm	c
free	c
when	c
I	c
'm	c
out	c
of	c
the	i
school	c
.	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
,	c

I	c
have	c
just	c
received	c
the	c
letter	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thanks	i
for	i
chossing	i
me	c
.	c

The	c
most	c
suitable	c
month	c
is	c
July	c
.	c

I	c
was	i
playing	i
Basketball	c
in	i
the	i
university	c
.	c

During	i
the	i
university	c
I	c
atend	i
for	i
two	i
years	i
tenis	i
lessons	i
.	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

I	c
went	c
with	c
Big	c
Brothers	c
the	i
name	c
of	c
the	c
band	c
.	c

I	c
went	c
for	c
interview	i
and	c
I	c
got	c
the	c
job	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
to	c
run	c
all	c
the	c
times	i
.	c

I	c
received	c
your	c
letter	c
congratulating	c
me	c
on	c
having	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
.	c

It	c
does	c
not	c
matter	c
to	c
me	c
whether	c
I	c
stay	c
in	c
tent	i
or	c
log	i
cabin	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
tent	i
to	i
be	c
much	i
more	i
in	i
contact	c
with	c
wild	i
life	i
and	c
nature	c
.	c

The	c
activities	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
do	c
most	c
are	c
playing	c
basketball	c
and	c
Climbing	c
.	c

The	c
first	c
one	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
played	i
basketball	c
since	c
the	c
age	c
of	c
twelve	c
and	c
the	c
second	c
one	c
because	c
there	c
are	c
not	c
many	c
places	c
where	i
to	c
go	c
climbing	c
in	c
my	c
city	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

Yours	c
Sincerely	c
,	c

It	c
was	c
terrible	c
!	c

We	c
have	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
problems	c
from	c
the	c
beggining	i
.	c

The	c
first	c
one	c
was	c
the	c
security	c
.	c

Another	c
problem	c
was	c
the	c
band	c
.	c

The	c
singer	c
and	c
the	c
guitarist	c
were	c
so	c
angry	c
that	c
they	c
went	i
out	i
immediately	c
leaving	i
the	c
public	c
without	c
the	c
last	c
part	c
of	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Jane	i
Clark	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
express	c
my	c
dissatisfaction	c
with	c
International	i
Arts	c
Festival	c
,	c
which	c
was	c
organised	c
by	c
you	c
last	c
year	c
.	c

Fourthly	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
admit	c
that	c
a	c
big	c
advantage	c
was	c
your	c
idea	c
about	i
giving	c
one	c
reasonably-priced	c
weekend	c
ticket	c
for	c
all	c
events	c
.	c

That	c
was	c
excelent	i
because	c
it	c
attracted	c
peoples	i
'	i
attention	c

I	c
suggest	c
you	c
invite	c
some	c
film	c
stars	c
,	c
because	c
they	c
are	c
very	c
famous	c
and	c
people	c
like	c
them	c

Nowadays	c
everybody	c
wants	c
to	c
earn	c
money	c
.	c

Young	c
people	c
know	c
that	c
money	c
make	i
the	c
world	c
go	c
round	c
,	c
so	c
they	c
always	c
look	c
for	c
a	c
job	c
with	c
big	i
salary	c
.	c

Some	c
people	c
say	c
that	c
the	c
young	c
should	c
n't	c
be	c
independent	c
and	c
earn	c
on	c
their	c
own	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
am	c
sure	c
that	c
it	c
's	c
better	c
to	c
work	c
in	c
your	c
free-time	i
than	c
waste	c
it	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
the	i
good	c
way	c
to	c
earn	c
money	c
is	c
,	i
to	c
help	c
the	c
old	c
.	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c

I	c
'm	c
pleased	c
to	i
that	c
I	c
've	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
at	i
camp	i
california	i
in	i
the	i
U.S.A	i
during	i
two	i
weeks	i
.	c

About	i
the	c
accomodation	i
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
,	i
I	c
think	c
that	c
will	c
be	c
more	i
safety	i
about	i
all	c
my	c
stuff	i
.	c

Finally	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
if	c
I	c
need	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
money	c
about	i
this	c
excursion	i
and	c
if	c
we	c
are	c
going	c
to	c
visit	c
some	c
building	i
.	c

yours	i
Sincerly	i

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

The	c
stage	c
was	c
gigantesque	i
the	c
crowed	i
could	i
be	i
all	i
around	i
.	c

I	c
keep	i
a	i
very	c
good	c
souvenir	i
about	i
this	c
experience	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
I	c
will	c
go	c
back	c
the	i
next	c
year	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

I	c
was	i
coming	i
to	c
see	c
him	c
but	c
there	c
was	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
.	c

Second	c
point	c
,	c
the	c
musical	i
show	c
had	i
to	c
begin	c
at	c
7:30	c
PM	c
but	c
we	c
have	i
waited	i
for	c
fourty	i
five	i
minutes	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
show	c
started	i
.	c

Third	c
point	c
,	c
your	c
advertisement	c
told	c
about	i
"	i
discount	c
available	c
"	c
about	i
the	c
ticket	i
's	i
price	i
but	c
it	i
was	c
n't	c
.	i

Yours	c
FAITHFULLY	c
,	c

We	c
live	c
in	c
a	c
society	c
where	c
the	i
technology	c
grows	i
up	i
everyday	i
.	c

We	c
can	c
find	c
some	c
everywhere	c
.	c

Then	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
's	c
interssant	i
to	c
answer	c
the	c
following	c
question	c
:	c

How	c
has	c
modern	c
technology	c
changed	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
?	c

My	c
plan	c
will	i
be	i
very	c
simple	c
:	c
a	c
description	c
in	i
a	i
first	c
time	i
and	c
an	c
analysis	c
in	i
a	i
second	c
time	i
.	c

When	c
I	c
go	c
to	c
school	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
see	c
in	i
many	i
stores	i
the	i
new	i
tools	i
they	i
've	i
just	i
received	i
.	c

Dear	c
Jane	c
Clark	c
,	c
the	c
organiser	c
of	c
International	i
Arts	c
Festival	c

Most	c
of	c
attractions	i
are	i
excellent	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
point	c
out	c
that	c
"	i
quality	i
is	i
high	i
,	i
but	i
quantity	i
is	i
not	i
enough	i
!	i
.	c

Second	c
,	c
some	c
concert	c
hall	i
were	c
too	c
small	c
,	c
so	c
some	c
audience	i
could	c
n't	c
concentrate	c
to	i
listen	i
to	c
the	c
music	c
.	c

And	c
others	c
could	c
n't	c
enter	c
the	c
hall	c
.	c

Because	c
it	i
's	i
easy	i
to	c
manage	c
the	c
artist	i
schedule	c
and	c
audience	i
can	c
enjoy	c
the	i
live	i
.	c

I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
Festival	c
again	c
!	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

And	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
answer	c
for	i
your	c
question	c
.	c

AT	i
first	i
,	c
in	c
Japan	c
,	c
generally	c
school	c
rules	c
are	c
more	c
strictly	i
than	c
home	i
's	i
.	c

In	c
addition	c
"	c
the	c
students	c
must	c
not	c
use	c
any	c
commercial	c
paper	c
bags	c
(	c
received	i
at	c
department	i
store	c
etc	c
)	c
"	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
have	c
please	c
tell	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
the	c
good	c
programme	c
,	c
especially	c
on	i
Wednesday	c
,	c
because	c
the	c
other	c
student	i
and	c
I	c
like	c
Art	i
Galleries	i
.	c

But	c
,	i
the	i
last	c
Friday	c
,	c
we	c
have	i
seen	i
an	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
"	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
.	i

Now	c
,	c
we	c
want	c
to	c
know	c
if	c
it	c
is	c
possible	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
watch	i
this	c
Show	c
.	c

We	c
suggest	c
you	c
to	i
change	i
the	c
programme	c
.	c

We	c
think	c
that	c
Monday	c
and	c
Wednesday	c
are	c
good	c
,	c
but	c
we	c
ask	c
you	c
to	c
change	c
the	c
programme	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
.	c

If	c
it	c
is	c
possible	c
,	c
we	c
want	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
"	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
"	c
and	c
do	i
n't	i
go	c
shopping	c
.	c

We	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c
.	c

yours	c
sincerely	c

We	c
lived	i
in	i
my	c
aunt	c
's	c
house	c
who	i
was	c
in	c
the	c
center	i
of	c
the	c
village	c
.	c

In	c
front	c
of	c
my	c
aunt	c
's	c
house	c
,	c
there	c
is	i
a	c
house	c
with	c
swimming	i
pool	c
,	c
garage	c
and	c
garden	c
.	c

One	c
night	c
,	c
I	c
heard	c
a	c
strange	c
sound	c
.	c

I	c
went	c
near	c
the	c
house	c
and	c
waited	c
to	c
look	i
what	c
it	i
would	c
happen	c
.	c

When	c
the	c
other	c
man	c
came	c
out	c
,	c
I	c
caught	c
him	c
and	c
fighted	i
him	c
.	c

The	c
policeman	c
came	c
to	c
take	c
the	c
bugglar	i
and	c
thanked	c
me	c
to	i
catch	i
him	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
show	c
,	i
that	c
I	c
have	i
recently	i
attended	i
to	i
at	c
your	c
theatre	c
.	c

Not	i
only	i
the	i
play	i
started	c
45	c
minutes	c
after	c
it	c
was	c
planned	c
,	c
but	c
as	i
the	c
actors	c
eventually	c
appeared	c
at	i
the	c
stage	c
,	c
have	i
I	i
also	i
seen	i
,	i
that	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
was	i
replaced	c
by	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
,	c
who	c
was	c
very	c
disappointing	c
in	c
his	c
role	c
.	c

To	c
make	c
matters	c
even	c
worse	c
,	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
without	c
any	c
information	c
given	i
about	c
the	c
reason	c
of	i
it	i
's	i
closure	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
see	c
,	c
my	c
evening	c
in	c
your	c
theatre	c
absolutely	i
was	c
n't	c
perfect	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
answer	c
"	c
yes	c
"	c
for	i
both	c
questions	c
.	c

Most	c
of	c
the	c
scientists	c
,	c
when	c
asked	c
about	c
the	c
Earth	c
in	c
a	c
hundred	c
years	c
claim	i
,	i
that	c
it	c
is	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
absolutely	c
scorching	c
here	c
then	c
.	c

Another	c
effect	c
of	c
the	c
scorching	c
weather	c
could	c
be	c
,	i
that	c
people	c
wo	c
n't	c
be	c
allowed	c
to	c
get	i
out	c
of	c
the	c
building	c
unless	c
they	c
wear	c
specially	c
designed	c
caps	c
or	c
hats	c
,	c
made	c
of	c
materials	c
,	i
that	c
are	c
n't	c
known	c
yet	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
whole	c
,	c
we	c
can	c
only	c
predict	i
what	c
clothes	c
will	c
be	c
like	c
in	c
year	i
2100	c
.	c

But	c
in	c
case	c
my	c
predictions	c
are	c
right	c
,	c
maybe	c
you	c
should	c
buy	c
a	c
new	c
pair	c
of	c
shorts	c
?	c

I	c
suggest	c
to	i
do	i
a	c
couple	c
more	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

Your	i
Sincerely	c

How	c
are	c
you	c
?	c

At	c
school	c
you	c
are	c
n't	c
allowed	c
to	c
bring	c
connected	i
movil	i
phones	c
although	c
there	c
are	i
more	c
than	c
one	c
student	c
that	c
does	c
it	i
.	c

Teachers	c
will	c
take	c
it	c
from	c
you	c
if	c
it	c
rangs	i
during	c
school	c
hours	c
.	c

As	i
well	i
you	i
are	i
n't	i
allowed	c
to	c
bring	c
drugs	c
or	c
arms	c
,	c
to	c
smoke	c
or	c
to	c
drink	c
alcohol	c
inside	c
the	c
school	c
.	c

love	i

I	c
do	c
n't	c
mind	c
if	c
I	c
travel	c
during	c
the	c
first	c
fortnight	c
or	c
during	c
the	c
second	c
one	c
,	c
although	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
travelling	c
during	c
the	c
second	c
fortnight	c
,	c
if	c
it	c
is	c
possible	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
never	c
liked	c
staying	c
in	c
tents	c
because	c
I	c
think	c
they	c
are	c
uncomfortable	c
,	c
especially	c
if	c
the	c
stay	c
is	c
going	c
to	c
last	c
more	c
than	c
two	c
or	c
three	c
days	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
never	c
been	c
good	c
at	c
team	c
sports	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
really	c
like	c
basketball	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
can	c
be	c
very	c
interesting	c
to	c
meet	c
other	c
people	c
by	c
means	c
of	c
this	c
team	c
sport	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
be	c
very	c
grateful	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
give	c
me	c
some	c
aditional	i
information	c
.	c

What	c
type	c
of	c
clothes	c
must	c
I	c
take	c
?	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

I	c
can	c
understand	c
why	c
you	c
are	c
impatient	c
to	c
hear	c
about	c
my	c
experience	c
at	c
the	c
concert	c
last	c
month	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
met	c
our	c
favourite	c
singer	c
,	c
Celine	c
Dion	c
!	c

She	c
is	c
wonderful	c
.	c

The	c
team	c
of	c
volunteers	c
was	c
a	c
great	c
one	c
,	c
and	c
all	c
of	c
us	c
were	c
willing	c
to	c
help	c
in	i
anything	c
they	c
needed	c
.	i

Firstly	c
,	c
we	c
were	c
asked	c
to	c
clear	i
the	c
stadium	c
,	c
especially	c
the	c
seats	c
and	c
surroundings	c
.	c

They	c
said	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
necessary	c
and	c
we	c
sat	c
down	c
on	c
the	c
grass	c
and	c
observed	c
how	c
the	c
scenary	i
was	c
being	c
prepared	c
for	c
the	c
concert	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
astonished	c
.	c

She	c
gave	c
it	c
to	c
me	c
with	c
a	c
great	c
smile	c
and	c
gave	c
permission	c
to	c
take	c
a	c
photograph	c
of	c
both	c
of	c
us	c
.	c

I	c
still	c
believe	c
it	c
has	c
only	c
been	c
a	c
dream	c
!	c

Please	c
,	c
make	c
sure	c
you	c
can	c
come	c
next	c
weekend	c
.	c

Let	c
me	c
know	c
if	c
you	c
are	c
going	c
to	c
come	c
so	c
that	c
I	c
prepare	i
the	c
bedroom	c
to	c
put	c
you	c
up	c

Best	c
wishes	c
,	c

During	c
my	c
stay	c
I	c
read	c
an	c
advertisement	c
of	i
a	c
musical	c
show	c
being	c
held	i
at	c
The	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
can	c
see	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
the	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
your	c
advertisement	c
talked	c
about	c
.	c

Then	i
,	c
I	c
would	c
be	c
glad	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
have	i
my	i
money	c
back	c
.	c

How	c
has	c
modern	c
technology	c
changed	c
your	c
daily	c
lief	i
.	i

That	c
is	c
exactly	c
what	c
happens	i
to	c
me	c
.	c

Today	c
I	c
can	c
connect	c
to	c
the	c
Internet	c
and	c
find	c
all	c
the	c
information	c
I	c
need	c
faster	c
than	c
you	c
can	c
imagine	c
.	c

But	c
technology	c
is	c
not	c
just	c
about	c
studying	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
entertainment	c
too	c
!	c

You	c
also	c
have	c
fast	c
food	c
,	c
or	c
food	c
made	c
in	c
the	c
microwave	c
within	c
a	c
few	c
minutes	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	i
good	i
programme	c
.	c

All	c
the	c
students	c
in	c
my	c
class	c
are	c
excited	c
about	c
one	c
more	c
thing	c
.	c

We	c
saw	c
an	c
advertisement	c
about	i
Fashion	i
And	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
.	c

This	c
show	c
is	c
about	c
latest	i
fashions	c
,	c
leisure	c
and	c
sports	c
wear	c
,	c
make	i
up	i
and	c
Hairstyles	i
.	c

One	c
more	c
thing	c
about	c
show	i
is	c
,	i
it	i
's	c
free	c
for	c
students	c
.	c

Is	c
n't	c
it	c
a	c
big	i
opportunity	c
for	c
us	c
?	c

As	c
you	c
know	c
,	c
there	c
is	c
a	i
free	c
time	c
in	c
your	c
programme	i
if	i
you	c
do	c
n't	c
mind	c
,	c
we	c
can	c
go	c
for	i
shopping	c
in	c
this	c
free	c
time	c
.	c

We	c
hope	c
you	c
an	i
accept	c
our	c
suggestion	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

A	c
PRIVATE	c
LIFE	c

All	c
people	c
have	c
some	c
difficulties	c
about	i
their	c
job	i
but	c
some	c
of	i
them	i
have	c
more	c
than	c
the	i
others	c
.	c

Reason	i
for	c
this	c
;	i
they	i
are	c
famous	c
and	c
everybody	c
wants	c
to	c
learn	i
about	c
them	c
.	c

Having	c
a	c
private	c
life	c
is	c
important	c
for	c
everybody	c
.	c

if	i
you	c
are	c
a	c
famous	c
person	c
,	c
for	c
example	c
singer	i
,	c
film	c
star	c
,	c
politician	c
or	c
well-know	i
footballer	c
,	c
you	c
have	c
n't	c
get	i
any	c
choice	c
.	c

so	i
journalists	c
are	i
following	i
you	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
.	c

I	c
know	c
,	i
they	c
are	c
not	c
like	c
us	c
.	c

We	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
to	c
learn	i
their	i
every	c
second	c
.	c

We	c
have	c
to	c
remember	c
that	c
,	i
they	c
need	c
a	c
private	c
life	c
like	c
us	c
.	c

We	c
can	c
love	c
them	c
without	c
disturbing	c
too	i
.	c

Unfortunately	c
the	i
one	c
I	c
saw	c
a	c
week	c
ago	c
in	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
was	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
worst	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
the	i
musical	c
should	c
have	c
started	c
at	c
19.30	c
but	c
unfortunately	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
wait	c
forty	i
five	i
minutes	c
.	c

It	c
is	i
a	c
wasting	i
of	c
time	c
.	c

In	c
fact	c
at	i
the	c
stage	c
appeared	c
compleatly	i
different	c
person	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

But	c
to	c
make	c
everything	c
clear	c
I	c
'll	c
start	c
from	c
the	c
beggining	i
.	c

The	i
school	i
finished	c
and	c
we	c
,	c
I	c
mean	c
Pat	c
,	c
Tim	c
and	c
me	c
,	c
did	c
n't	c
know	c
what	c
to	c
do	c
with	c
plenty	i
of	i
spare	c
time	c
.	c

I	c
did	c
n't	c
wanted	i
to	c
spend	c
that	c
holiday	c
with	c
my	c
parents	c
in	c
the	c
country	c
.	c

We	c
planned	c
to	c
tell	c
them	c
that	c
we	c
were	c
going	c
for	i
a	c
summer	c
camp	c
in	c
the	c
mountains	c
where	c
we	c
would	c
practise	c
French	c
.	c

We	c
promised	c
to	c
keep	c
it	c
in	i
secret	c
.	c

Pat	c
started	c
to	c
cry	c
and	c
told	c
about	i
everything	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
must	c
congratulate	c
the	c
people	c
responsible	c
of	i
this	c
good	c
idea	c
.	c

It	i
is	i
known	i
of	i
all	i
the	i
lack	i
of	i
art	i
festivals	i
and	i
cultural	i
activities	i
in	i
general	i
that	i
shows	i
our	i
city	i
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
there	c
were	c
some	c
problems	i
of	i
accommodation	i
in	c
the	c
classical	c
concerts	c
because	c
some	c
concert	c
halls	c
were	c
too	c
small	c
.	c

Another	c
important	c
thing	c
is	c
that	c
,	c
despite	c
the	c
number	c
and	c
quality	c
of	c
films	c
,	c
there	c
were	c
,	c
from	c
my	c
point	c
of	c
view	c
,	c
not	c
many	c
plays	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
suggest	c
that	c
,	c
in	c
next	c
year	c
's	c
festival	c
,	c
you	c
include	c
different	c
kinds	c
of	c
music	c
,	c
as	i
ska	c
or	c
ethnical	i
music	c
.	c

The	i
topic	i
says	c
that	c
young	c
people	c
have	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
problems	c
,	c
but	c
without	c
any	c
doubt	c
,	c
money	c
is	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
of	c
them	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
you	c
can	c
dance	i
folk	i
be	i
Hamlet	c
in	c
the	c
street	c
,	c
or	c
even	c
sing	c
with	i
some	i
of	i
your	i
friends	i
a	i
nice	i
song	i
from	i
you	i
country	i
.	c

But	c
maybe	c
you	c
are	c
too	c
shy	c
to	c
do	c
this	c
.	c

In	c
this	c
case	c
,	c
you	c
can	c
cook	c
some	c
cakes	c
and	c
sell	c
them	c
near	c
a	c
school	c
or	c
in	c
the	c
centre	c
of	c
the	c
city	c
,	c
as	c
well	c
as	c
other	c
traditional	c
products	c
:	c
cheese	c
,	c
honey	c
,chocolate	c
...	c

You	c
do	c
n't	c
need	c
to	c
be	c
a	c
Picasso	c
,	i
it	i
's	i
enough	i
with	i
a	i
bit	i
of	i
imagination	i
.	c

If	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
feel	c
like	c
doing	c
any	c
thing	i
of	i
this	i
,	c
you	c
have	c
alternative	c
solutions	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
to	i
inform	i
me	c
for	i
the	c
prise	i
I	c
had	c
won	c
.	c

I	c
prefer	c
to	c
staying	i
in	c
cabin	i
because	c
never	i
before	i
I	i
when	i
on	i
holidays	i
in	i
tent.	i
,	c
so	c
I	c
think	c
is	i
more	c
corfotabel	i
to	c
sleep	c
in	c
bet	i
instand	i
of	c
outside	c
in	c
tent	i
.	c

The	c
activities	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
do	c
durring	i
these	c
two	c
week	i
it	i
's	i
basketball	c
and	c
swimming	c
.	c

Swimming	c
it	i
's	i
not	c
my	c
favorite	i
sport	c
but	c
I	c
prefer	c
swimming	c
than	i
golf	c
or	c
tennis	c
.	c

I	c
look	i
forward	c
for	i
this	c
competition	i
.	c

Best	c
Regards	i

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
inform	i
you	c
about	c
my	c
experience	c
of	i
the	c
last	c
pop	c
concert	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
very	c
nice	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
help	c
because	c
I	c
have	i
seen	i
so	c
many	c
people	c
and	c
I	c
have	i
goten	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
experience	c
of	c
things	c
that	c
I	c
never	i
had	i
done	c
before	c

I	c
was	c
the	c
assistent	i

the	c
responsible	i
person	i
for	c
the	c
clothes	c
and	c
make-up	c
of	c
the	c
pop-group	i
,	i
realy	i
I	c
was	c
very	c
nervous	c
about	c
that	c
because	c
was	i
the	i
first	c
time	c
with	c
so	i
famous	c
people	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
happy	c
that	c
all	c
the	c
things	c
went	c
very	c
well	c
Kim	i
what	i
realy	i
particularly	c
liked	c
was	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
asked	c
to	c
do	c
the	c
make-up	c
on	c
my	c
on	i
realy	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
nervous	c
but	c
at	c
same	i
moment	i
very	c
happy	c
,	c
but	c
every	i
thing	i
when	i
well	c
and	c
everyboby	i
was	c
very	c
hapy	i
with	c
my	c

Dear	c
Ms	c
Clark	c
,	c

They	c
were	c
cold	c
and	c
moist	i
,	c
too	c
,	c
because	c
the	c
air-conditioning	c
system	c
was	c
insufficient	i
.	c

Thirdly	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
more	c
plays	c
and	c
films	c
should	c
be	c
shown	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
should	c
say	c
that	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
very	c
good	c
time	c
in	c
spite	c
of	c
the	c
flaws	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
wish	c
to	c
enjoy	c
an	c
even	c
better	c
festival	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

This	c
is	c
especially	c
bad	c
for	c
us	c
girls	c
,	c
as	c
we	c
are	c
obliged	c
to	c
wear	c
skirts	c
and	c
we	c
cannot	c
climb	c
the	c
stairs	c
or	c
run	c
like	c
the	c
boys	c
.	c

But	c
apart	c
from	c
this	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
most	c
rules	c
of	c
the	c
school	c
are	c
quite	c
reasonable	c
,	c
like	c
addressing	c
to	i
the	c
teacher	c
using	c
the	c
second	c
plural	i
person	i
(	c
it	c
is	c
different	c
in	c
Turkish	c
)	c
or	c
standing	c
up	c
when	c
s/he	c
enters	c
the	c
class	c
.	c

As	c
we	c
are	c
a	c
developing	c
country	c
,	c
teachers	c
are	c
quite	c
respected	c
.	c

Let	c
me	c
talk	c
about	c
the	c
rules	c
at	c
home	c
.	c

We	c
like	c
chatting	c
on	c
the	c
phone	c
so	c
much	c
that	c
most	c
of	c
us	i
'	i
parents	c
have	c
limited	c
the	c
talking	c
time	c
down	i
to	c
five	c
minutes	c
,	c
threatening	c
to	c
cut	c
off	c
the	c
wires	i
otherwise	c
.	c

Also	c
,	c
as	c
most	c
of	c
us	c
live	c
in	c
flats	c
,	c
we	c
're	c
not	c
allowed	c
to	c
listen	c
to	c
loud	c
music	c
or	c
run	c
or	c
play	c
ball	c
games	c
in	c
the	c
house	c
!	c

This	c
month	c
has	c
been	c
full	c
of	c
exams	c
and	c
there	c
are	c
still	c
ones	i
coming	c
up	c
next	c
week	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
must	c
be	c
a	c
swot	c
as	c
you	c
see	c
.	c

Anyway	c
,	c
I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
your	c
comments	c
about	c
our	c
rules	c
.	c

We	c
all	i
would	i
like	c
to	c
go	c
and	c
see	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
which	c
will	c
take	c
place	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
14th	c
March	c
,	c
from	c
10.00	c
to	c
19.00	c
,	c
in	c
the	i
London	c
's	c
Central	c
exhibition	i
Hall	c
.	c

Everybody	c
in	c
the	c
class	c
is	c
interested	c
in	c
this	c
show	c
,	c
and	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
for	c
us	c
to	c
see	c
it	c
,	c
especially	c
because	c
many	c
of	c
us	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
work	c
later	c
in	c
the	c
fashion	c
.	i

Yours	c
sincerely	c

"	c
Famous	c
people	c
,	c
such	c
as	c
politicians	c
and	c
film	c

deserve	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
private	c
life	c
without	c
journalists	c
following	c
them	c
all	c
the	c
time.	c
"	c

However	c
,	c
on	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
it	c
must	c
be	c
so	c
annoying	c
to	c
be	c
followed	c
by	c
journalists	c
or	c
photographs	i
all	c
the	c
time	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
sure	c
that	c
nobody	c
would	c
like	c
this	c

That	c
is	c
why	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
famous	c
people	c
deserve	c
a	c
private	c

that	c

takes	c

their	c

in	i
the	c
newspaper	i

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
,	c

Second	c
,	c
the	c
musical	c
started	c
forty-five	c
minutes	c
later	i
!	c
and	c
,	c
to	c
make	c
matters	c
worse	c
,	c
the	c
actor	c
was	c
not	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
as	c
the	c
advertisement	c
said	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
often	c
said	c
that	c
technology	c
has	c
changed	c
our	c
lives	c
in	c
many	c
ways	c
,	c
and	c
that	c
we	c
live	c
better	c
now	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
technology	c
has	c
also	c
brought	c
many	c
problems	c
to	c
Society	c
.	c

If	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
know	c
how	c
a	c
friend	c
is	c
,	c
I	c
just	c
have	c
to	c
phone	c
him	c
;	c
I	c
can	c

the	c

is	c
going	i

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
,	c

Last	c
week	c
I	c
was	c
on	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
and	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
for	c
entertaining	i
but	c
I	c
wish	c
I	c
'd	c
not	c
go	i
there	c
because	c
everythings	i
went	c
wrong	c
.	c

During	c
the	c
show	c
I	c
was	i
expected	i
to	c
meet	i
Danny	c
Brook	c
who	i
is	c
my	c
favourite	c
actor	c
and	i
Tina	c
Truelove	c
.	c

There	c
are	i
Robert	c
Alan	c
and	c
Jack	c
Ruby	c
instead	c
of	c
them	c
.	c

It	i
was	c
a	c
sign	c
in	c
front	c
of	c
the	c
restaurant	c
"	i
sorry	c
we	c
closed	i
because	i
special	c
reasons	c
"	i
and	i
I	c
was	c
wondering	c
what	c
was	i
the	i
reasons	i
for	c
that	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

It	c
happened	c
in	i
last	c
summer	i
we	i
planed	i
to	c
go	c
on	c
holiday	c
in	c
the	c
Southen	i
part	c
of	c
Thailand	c
by	c
motorbike	c
but	c
we	c
could	c
n't	c
tell	c
our	c
parents	c
because	c
they	c
would	c
n't	c
allow	c
us	c
to	c
go	c
.	c

Eventhrough	i
we	i
could	i
spend	i
our	i
holiday	i
there	i
but	i
with	i
my	i
mum	i
and	i
I	i
just	i
found	i
that	i
it	i
was	i
fantasy	i
time	i
which	i
I	i
had	i
never	i
though	i
about	i
it	i
.	c

From	c
now	c
on	c
I	i
do	c
n't	c
want	c
to	c
tell	i
something	i
secrets	i
to	i
Pat	i
because	c
she	c
always	c
tell	i
someone	c
else	c
but	c
she	c
still	i
my	c
best	c
friend	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writting	i
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
confirming	c
the	i
first	i
prize	i
that	i
I	i
won	i
in	c
your	c
competition	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	i
also	i
with	i
the	i
present	i
to	c
give	c
you	c
some	c
information	c
about	c
me	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
arrange	c
the	c
details	c
for	c
the	c
trip	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
inform	c
you	c
that	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
travel	c
only	c
during	c
July	c
because	c
in	c
June	c
I	c
am	c
going	c
to	c
give	i
examinations	c
for	c
the	c
First	c
Certificate	c
in	c
English	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
in	c
August	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
preparing	c
for	c
my	c
course	c
at	c
the	c
University	i
which	i
I	c
am	c
starting	c
next	c
September	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
inform	c
you	c
that	c
I	c
prefer	i
to	c
do	c
Surfing	c
and	c
Sailing	c
while	c
I	c
will	i
be	i
at	c
the	c
Camp	i
,	c
as	c
I	c
am	c
an	c
active	c
member	c
of	c
Sailing	i
and	c
Surfing	c
Club	c
of	c
Manchester	c
and	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
a	c
great	c
chance	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
practise	c
my	c
techniques	c
and	c
skills	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
be	i
also	i
grateful	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
send	c
me	c
information	c
about	c
the	c
average	c
living	i
cost	i
at	i
California	c
as	i
I	c
have	c
to	c
arrange	i
the	c
amount	c
of	c
money	c
that	c
I	c
am	c
going	c
to	c
spend	c
,	c
and	c
some	c
advice	c
about	c
the	c
clothes	c
that	c
I	c
need	c
.	c

As	c
requested	c
,	c
I	c
visited	c
some	c
classes	c
during	c
the	i
lesson	i
and	c
some	c
other	c
rooms	c
while	c
activities	c
were	c
taking	c
place	c
.	c

The	c
aim	c
of	c
this	c
report	c
is	c
make	i
a	c
series	c
of	c
suggestions	c
on	c
which	c
lessons	c
and	c
other	c
activities	c
should	c
be	c
filmed	c
.	c

It	i
's	i
seems	c
to	c
me	c
that	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
an	c
extremely	c
good	c
advertisement	c
for	c
our	c
school	c
if	c
you	c
take	i
plans	i
from	i
the	c
lesson	i
of	i
Chemistry	i
in	c
the	c
laboratory	c
,	c
because	c
our	c
laboratory	c
is	c
new	c
,	c
recognised	c
as	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
best	c
in	c
the	c
area	c
as	c
it	c
has	c
a	c
huge	c
amount	c
of	c
instruments	i
and	c
really	c
some	c
very	c
good	c
professors	i
,	c
and	c
also	c
many	c
experiments	c
are	c
taking	c
place	c
in	c
this	c
laboratory	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
declare	c
that	c
my	i
myself	i
and	c
my	c
fellow	c
students	c
will	c
be	c
available	c
to	c
help	c
to	i
this	c
short	c
video	c
by	i
all	i
means	i
.	c

I	c
cannot	c
believe	c
I	c
'm	c
the	c
winner	c
of	c
your	c
competition	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
on	i
July	c
;	c
that	c
is	c
for	c
me	c
the	c
only	c
possibility	c
because	c
I	c
will	c
finish	c
my	c
course	c
a	i
University	i
at	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
June	c
and	c
I	c
will	c
start	c
to	c
work	c
in	c
September	c
.	c

I	c
like	c
to	c
travel	i
with	i
light	i
logguage	i
and	c
I	c
have	c
no	c
idea	c
about	c
the	c
weather	c
;	c
could	c
you	c
suggest	c
me	i
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
have	i
to	i
bring	i
with	c
me	c
?	c

Yours	c
Sincerely	i

It	c
's	c
great	c
to	c
hearing	i
from	c
you	c
!	c

I	c
did	c
it	c
for	c
free	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
non-profit	c
concert	c
for	i
helping	i
the	c
poor	c
people	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
the	c
first	c
time	c
for	c
me	c
and	c
I	c
consider	c
this	c
experience	c
the	c
best	c
of	c
my	c
life	c
.	c

I	c
suggest	c
you	c
to	i
try	i
this	c
kind	c
of	c
experience	c
.	c

You	c
should	c
be	c
pride	i
of	c
you	i
helping	i
people	c
who	c
suffers	i
,	c
and	c
at	c
the	c
same	c
time	c
you	c
may	i
enjoy	c
yourself	c
!	c

Love	c

Concerning	c
the	c
accomodation	i
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
sleep	c
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
,	c
because	c
to	c
sleep	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
would	c
remind	c
me	c
of	c
the	c
bad	c
experience	c
I	c
had	c
in	c
Ireland	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
weather	c
...	c

Then	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
will	c
need	c
there	c
,	c
and	c
if	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
bring	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
money	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

I	c
apologize	c
for	c
not	c
having	c
written	c
this	c
letter	c
sooner	c
,	c
but	c
as	c
you	c
probably	c
now	i
,	c
I	c
was	c
actually	c
really	c
busy	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
pop	c
concert	c
.	c

When	c
they	c
are	c
on	c
stage	c
,	c
during	c
the	c
repetitions	i
,	c
they	c
are	c
able	c
to	c
play	c
a	c
music	c
that	c
completely	c
moves	c
me	c
.	c

In	c
a	c
few	c
months	c
,	c
when	c
they	c
are	c
famous	c
,	c
I	c
could	c
say	c
:	c
"	c
You	c
know	c
.	i

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
concerning	c
your	c
letter	c
about	c
my	c
win	i
in	i
your	i
competition	i
for	i
two	i
weeks	i
at	i
Camp	i
California	i
.	c

The	c
only	c
month	c
I	c
could	c
go	c
to	i
holidays	i
is	c
July	c
,	c
when	c
we	c
have	c
n't	c
got	c
a	c
lot	c
to	c
do	c
.	c

Additionally	c
I	c
'm	c
keen	c
on	c
taking	c
pictures	c
.	c

But	c
until	i
now	i
I	c
only	i
took	i
pictures	c
on	c
holidays	i
and	c
some	i
family	c
celabrations	i
.	c

Lastly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
if	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
money	c
with	c
me	c
,	c
for	i
example	i
for	i
the	i
food	i
.	c

And	c
also	c
if	c
the	c
weather	c
will	c
be	c
good	c
at	c
this	c
time	c
.	i

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
begin	c
this	c
composition	c
by	c
saying	c
that	c
,	i
not	i
for	i
everyone	i
is	i
shopping	i
the	i
same	i
.	c

As	c
long	c
as	c
I	c
am	c
not	c
searching	c
for	c
something	c
specific	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
must	c
buy	c
something	c
,	c
I	c
usually	c
ca	c
n't	c
find	c
it	c
and	c
then	c
the	i
shopping	c
become	i
a	c
nightmare	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
when	c
you	c
go	c
with	i
someone	i
else	i
shopping	i
,	c
and	c
you	c
both	c
want	c
to	c
see	c
and	c
buy	c
different	c
things	c
,	c
it	c
can	c
also	c
be	c
boring	i
and	i
uninteresting	i
.	c

Then	c
it	c
is	c
perhaps	c
better	c
,	i
when	c
you	c
make	c
an	c
appointment	c
in	c
one	c
hour	c
and	c
everybody	c
enjoys	i
the	i
shopping	c
alone	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
,	c

All	c
my	c
class	i
mates	i
are	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
go	i
to	c
London	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
you	i
about	c
changing	c
our	c
plan	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
14	c
March	c
.	c

The	c
students	c
in	c
my	c
class	c
have	c
seen	c
an	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
and	c
we	c
would	c
all	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

The	c
advertisement	c
saids	i
it	c
is	c
taking	c
place	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
14	c
March	c
from	c
10am	c
to	c
7pm	c
.	c

Since	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
is	i
not	c
taken	i
place	c
so	c
often	c
and	c
also	c
they	c
will	c
offer	i
the	i
students	i
for	i
free	i
entrance	i
fee	i
this	i
time	i
,	c
if	c
we	c
joined	i
in	i
this	c
show	c
,	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
great	i
opportunity	c
for	c
us	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
dangerous	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
knew	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
.	c

Otherwise	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
keep	c
walking	c
untill	i
the	c
train	c
start	i
.	c

Have	c
you	c
stayed	c
at	i
a	c
park	c
during	c
the	c
night	c
?	c

It	c
was	c
the	c
very	c
last	c
day	c
of	c
my	c
trip	c
and	c
at	c
that	c
time	c
I	c
was	c
in	c
Kyoto	c
.	c

Although	c
I	c
intended	c
to	c
stay	c
at	c
youth	i
hostel	c
,	c
I	c
could	c
not	c
find	c
any	c
place	c
to	c
stay	c
,	c
and	c
also	c
it	c
was	c
too	c
late	c
to	c
buy	c
a	c
train	c
ticket	c
to	c
go	c
back	c
home	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
like	c
a	c
dream	c
.	c

To	c
tell	c
the	c
truth	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
very	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
advertisement	c
,	c
it	c
was	i
written	i
that	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
London	c
's	c
newest	c
and	c
best	c
musical	c
show	c
.	c

I	c
thought	c
that	c
the	c
actor	c
of	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
but	c
he	c
was	c
not	c
playing	c
in	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

The	c
actor	c
was	c
somebody	c
else	c
and	c
this	c
was	c
something	i
disappointing	c
.	c

After	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
visit	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

People	c
had	c
completely	c
different	c
life-styles	i
.	c

And	c
of	c
course	c
,	c
they	c
were	c
black-and	i
white	c
.	c

You	c
can	c
communicate	c
with	c
other	c
people	c
any	c
time	c
you	c
want	c
.	c

Modern	c
technology	c
is	c
very	c
important	c
for	c
all	c
the	c
countries	c
.	c

It	c
has	c
a	c
very	c
big	c
role	c
in	c
developing	c
a	c
country	c
.	c

When	c
you	c
look	c
around	c
,	c
you	c
can	c
easily	c
understand	c
that	c
modern	c
technology	c
is	c
used	c
in	i
everything	c
.	c

Dear	c
Jane	c
Clark	c
,	c

I	c
had	c
a	c
wonderful	c
time	c
at	c
the	c
International	c
Arts	c
Festival	c
.	c

There	c
were	c
stars	c
and	c
artists	c
from	c
only	c
six	c
countries	c
.	c

The	c
performances	c
were	c
great	c
,	c
but	c
some	c
halls	c
were	c
too	c
small	c
to	c
accomodate	i
so	i
many	i
people	c
there	i
were	i
that	c
day	c
.	c

Overall	c
,	c
however	c
,	c
the	c
festival	c
was	c
definitely	c
a	c
great	c
success	c
.	c

The	c
special	c
tickets	c
were	c
excellent	c
because	c
we	c
could	c
enjoy	c
arts	i
without	c
worrying	c
about	c
money	c
.	c

So	c
all	c
you	c
need	c
to	c
improve	c
is	i
to	i
have	i
larger	c
concert	c
halls	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
no	c
doubt	c
that	c
you	c
will	c
succeed	c
in	i
next	c
year	c
's	c
festival	c
.	c

Sincerely	c
Yours	c
,	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
recommend	c
the	c
job	c
,	i
a	i
home	c
teacher	i
.	c

It	c
is	c
a	c
job	c
that	i
you	c
become	c
a	c
teacher	c
and	c
visit	c
your	c
student	c
at	c
his	c
or	c
her	c
house	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
very	c
good	c
considering	c
how	c
less	i
time	c
we	c
spend	c
on	c
it	c
.	c

Because	c
teaching	c
requires	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
knowledge	c
.	c

You	c
have	c
to	c
be	c
much	c
smarter	c
than	c
your	c
student	c
,	c
and	c
you	c
also	c
need	c
to	c
prepare	c
for	c
lessons	c
,	c
for	i
it	c
is	c
your	c
responsibility	c
to	c
provide	c
your	c
student	c
right	i
information	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
see	c
,	c
teaching	c
is	c
a	i
hard	c
work	c
in	c
some	c
respect	i
.	c

But	c
I	c
am	c
enjoying	c
it	c
and	c
getting	c
a	c
lot	c
out	c
of	c
it	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
,	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
first	c
,	c
in	i
the	i
name	i
of	i
my	c
whole	c
class	c
,	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
all	c
you	c
've	c
done	c
for	c
us	c
and	c
for	c
our	c
trip	c
to	c
London	c
.	c

This	c
will	c
be	c
very	c
enriching	c
for	c
us	c
!	c

We	c
thought	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
great	c
experience	c
for	c
us	c
since	c
we	c
quite	i
do	c
n't	c
have	c
such	c
opportunities	c
in	c
our	c
everyday	c
life	c
!	c

Anyway	c
,	c
we	c
were	c
to	i
go	i
shopping	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
afternoon	c
so	c
that	c
wo	c
n't	c
be	c
a	c
problem	c
to	c
my	c
mind	c
!	c

Yours	c
faithfully	i
,	c

It	c
was	c
dangerous	c
but	c
I	c
knew	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
.	c

George	c
was	c
leaning	i
on	c
the	c
floor	c
,	c
surrounded	c
by	c
his	c
own	c
lake	c
of	c
blood	c
.	c

He	c
had	c
just	c
been	c
beaten	c
by	c
a	c
ground	i
of	c
white	c
men	c
.	c

He	c
had	c
been	c
chained	c
and	c
no	c
way	c
could	c
he	c
escape	c
from	c
his	c
fate	c
without	c
some	c
help	c
!	c

The	c
place	c
where	c
I	c
was	c
hidden	c
was	c
overlooking	c
the	c
house	c
where	c
he	c
was	c
kept	c
prisonner	i
.	c

At	c
the	c
very	c
moment	c
when	c
he	c
say	i
me	c
,	c
his	c
eyes	c
began	c
to	c
shine	c
and	c
I	c
could	c
feel	c
that	c
he	c
had	c
recovered	c
some	c
hope	c
.	c

Dear	c
Ms	c
Jane	i
Clark	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
some	c
suggestion	i
about	i
next	c
year	i
festival	c
,	c
and	c
if	c
it	c
is	c
possible	c
I	c
can	i
give	i
you	c
some	c
opinions	c
about	c
this	c
year	i
festival	c
.	c

Another	c
thing	c
,	c
plays	i
and	c
films	c
.	c

This	c
is	c
excellent	i
idea	c
because	c
during	c
the	c
week	c
people	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
too	c
much	c
time	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
festival	c
.	c

Now	c
they	c
can	c
visit	c
it	c
by	i
whole	i
family	c
at	c
the	c
weekend	c
and	c
see	c
all	c
events	c
in	i
reasonaby-price	i

Yours	i
faithfully	i

Dear	c
Annabel	c

I	c
have	i
examinations	c
,	c
but	c
now	c
I	c
have	c
plenty	c
of	c
time	c
and	c
I	c
can	c
write	c
a	c
letter	c
to	c
you	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
they	c
are	c
the	c
same	c
as	c
yours	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
'm	c
not	c
sure	i
at	i
100	i
per	i
cent	i
so	c
I	c
vrite	i
:	i

If	c
someone	c
is	c
ill	c
must	i
bring	c
a	c
paper	i
from	c
a	c
doctor	c
.	c

I	c
like	c
clean	i
my	c
home	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
like	c
when	i
there	i
is	c
clean	c
and	c
fresh	c
.	c

There	c
is	c
one	c
thing	c
I	c
like	i
to	c
change	c
,	c
the	i
treatment	c
students	c
by	i
teachers	c
.	c

AT	i
seven	c
o'clock	c
on	c
the	c
dot	c
we	c
went	c

for	i
starting	i

At	c
first	c
we	c
both	c
thought	c
we	c
were	c

but	c
when	c
we	c
realised	c
it	c
was	c
true	c
we	c
went	c
there	c
and	c
ask	i
him	c
some	c
questions	c

It	c
was	c

to	c

As	c
requested	c
,	c
below	c
are	i
some	c
further	c
information	c
and	c
some	c
enquiries	i
.	c

As	c
far	c
as	c
accomodation	i
is	c
concerned	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
sleeping	i
in	c
a	c
tents	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
enjoy	i
a	i
lot	i
playing	c
tennis	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
sport	c
I	c
love	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
really	c
good	c
in	i
it	c
.	c

From	c
my	c
part	i
,	c
I	c
would	c
just	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
what	c
sort	c
of	c

I	i

I	c
've	c
done	c
so	c
many	c
thinks	i
and	i
between	i
them	i
I	c
went	c
to	c
Glastonbery	c
(	c
as	c
you	c
know	c
)	c
!	c

It	i
lasted	c
three	c
days	c
and	c
I	i
've	i
had	i
the	c
best	c
fun	c
of	c
my	c
life	c

The	c
accomodation	i
and	c
the	c
food	c
were	c
part	c
of	c

They	c
provided	c
us	c
tents	i
and	c
also	c
a	c
VIP	c
pass	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
get	c
food	c
.	c

It	c
has	i
been	i
the	c
best	c
experience	c
you	c
can	c
Imagine	i
.	c

I	c
met	c
lots	c
of	c
nice	c
and	i
cool	c
people	c
,	c
and	c
what	c
I	c
most	c
enjoyed	c
was	c
the	c
crazy	c
atmospher	i
of	c
the	c
hole	i
thing	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
I	c
'll	c
sign	c
off	c
now	c
and	c
I	c
hope	c
you	c
'll	c
write	c

Dear	c

I	c
would	c
be	c

of	i
them	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

What	c
I	c
really	c
want	c
to	c
say	i
is	c
about	c
my	c
recent	c
experience	c

Especially	i
,	c

is	c
a	c
member	c
of	c

told	c
me	c
I	c
had	i
got	c
a	c
talent	c
to	i
play	i
the	c
electric	c
guitar	c

It	c
is	c
impossible	c
to	c

"	c
Brilliant	c

Please	c
let	c

know	c
if	i
you	i
want	i
to	i
come	i
as	i
soon	i
as	i
possible	i

This	c
travel	i
enjoys	i

because	c
I	i
never	i
go	i
to	c
USA	i
.	c

I	c
can	c
travel	c
only	c
July	i
because	c
I	c

I	i
always	i
want	i
to	c
practise	i
but	c
in	c
France	c
it	c
is	c
to	i
expansive	i
.	c

So	c
if	c
I	c

this	c
opportunity	c
,	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
want	c
to	c
fail	i

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

I	c
have	c
visited	c
the	c
circle	i
theatre	i
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
there	c
were	c
any	i
different	c
actor	i
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
it	c
is	i
said	c
the	c
show	c
starts	i
at	c
19.30	c
but	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
.	c

It	c
is	i
false	i
,	i
I	c
have	i
paid	i
twenty	c
pounds	c
.	c

What	i
other	i
I	c
would	c
like	c
ask	i
is	c
that	i
why	c
it	c
is	c
said	c
this	c
is	c
the	i
London	c
's	c
newest	c
and	c
best	c
musical	c
show	c
.	c

But	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
there	c
were	i
not	c
anything	c
to	c
drink	c
or	c
to	c
eat	c
.	c

I	c
want	c
to	c
ask	c
if	c
it	c
is	c
possible	c
to	c
give	c
me	c
money	i
back	c
.	c

Modern	c
technology	c
has	c
changed	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
very	c
much	c
.	c

At	c
the	i
present	c
,	c
the	i
technology	c
develops	c
rapidly	c
.	c

Another	c
point	c
is	c
that	c
with	c
the	c
help	c
of	c
the	i
technology	c
we	c
can	c
communicate	c
with	c
the	c
whole	c
world	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
education	c
,	c
researching	i
of	i
the	c
Universe	i
and	c
others	i
.	c

Another	c
thing	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
say	c
is	c
that	c
modern	c
technology	c
help	i
us	c
to	c
go	i
anywhere	c
rapidly	i
.	c

The	c
most	c
suitable	i
examples	i
are	c
the	i
planes	c
.	c

We	c
research	i
our	c
plant	i
,	c
other	c
planets	c
and	c
many	c
other	c
things	c
with	c
the	i
help	i
of	i
it	i
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
no	c
one	c
can	c
do	c
without	c
modern	c
technology	c
.	c

It	c
go	i
on	i
to	c
develop	c
and	c
always	c
will	c
be	c
the	c
most	c
importand	i
think	i
in	c
our	c
life	c

Dear	i

Becouse	c
I	c
wanted	c

We	c
were	c
bored	c
and	c
we	c
wished	i
that	c

We	c
were	c
really	c
angry	c

Becouse	c

After	c

I	c
can	c
send	c
a	i
mail	i
to	c
my	c
friend	c
who	c
lives	c
in	c
Canada	c
.	c

When	c
the	c
important	c
day	c
is	c
coming	i
,	c
it	c
says	i
to	i
me	c
.	c

Life	c
is	c
really	c
easy	c
.	c

You	c
need	c
to	c
learn	c
how	c
you	c
can	c
use	c
the	i
technology	c
.	c

But	c
,	c
sometimes	c
I	i
miss	c
past	i
days	c
.	c

Sometimes	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
go	c
to	i
somewhere	c
without	c
technology	c
.	c

Dear	c
Manager	c
,	c

Instead	c
of	c
this	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
watch	c
the	c
performance	c
of	c
a	c
different	c
and	c
unknown	c
actor	c
who	c
was	c
n't	c
so	c
great	c
as	c
I	c
expected	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
to	c
this	c
,	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
we	c
looked	c
for	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
which	c
has	i
been	c
closed	c
for	c
repairing	i
since	i
one	c
month	c
ago	c
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
last	c
night	c
definitely	c
was	c
the	c
worst	c
experience	i
about	i
entertainment	i
I	c
've	c
ever	c
had	c
in	c
my	c
life	c
and	c
that	c
's	c
why	c
I	c
ask	i
you	c
my	i
money	c
back	c
as	c
a	i
compensation	c
.	c

With	c
the	c
introduction	c
of	c
the	c
computer	c
in	c
our	c
civilization	c
we	c
can	c
access	c
Internet	i
to	c
comunicate	i
with	c
our	c
relatives	c
and	c
friends	c
living	c
abroad	c
or	c
far	c
from	c
ourselves	i
.	c

Despite	c
of	i
the	c
distances	c
,	c
we	c
can	c
keep	c
our	c
friendship	c
closely	i
and	c
with	i
a	c
cheaply	i
way	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
we	c
can	c
feel	c
more	c
comfortable	c
with	c
them	c
providing	c
us	c
support	i
to	i
our	c
hard	c
tasks	c
and	c
letting	i
us	c
free	c
to	c
apply	c
our	c
attention	i
and	c
efforts	c
to	c
more	c
important	c
things	c
.	c

For	c
instance	c
,	c
we	c
can	c
research	c
new	c
manners	i
of	c
improving	c
our	c
quality	c
of	c
life	c
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
we	c
are	c
able	c
to	c
feel	c
or	c
to	c
recognize	c
the	c
benefits	c
of	c
the	c
modern	c
technologies	c
but	c
we	c
should	c
be	c
aware	c
about	i
how	c
they	c
are	c
introduced	c
in	i
our	c
lives	c
to	c
avoid	c
the	c
dangerous	c
side	c
of	c
the	i
TECHNOLOGY	c
.	c

Also	c
in	c
the	c
advertisment	i
you	c
wrote	c
that	c
discounts	c
were	c
available	c
,	c
but	c
they	c
were	c
n't	c
,	c
And	i
also	c
that	c
people	c
could	c
visit	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
,	i
to	c
eat	c
some	c
thing	c
or	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
drink	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
you	c
said	c
that	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
our	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
.	c

I	c
'd	c
like	c
you	c
to	c
return	c
them	i
to	c
me	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
the	c
next	c
day	c
Pat	c
went	c
and	c
told	c
to	i
his	c
sister	c
Sally	c
that	c
her	c
friends	c
were	c
organising	c
a	c
suprise	i
party	c
for	c
her	c
birthday	c
.	c

The	c
party	c
was	c
on	c
Saturday	c
at	c
Sally	c
's	c
house	c
.	c

All	c
her	c
friends	c
were	c
going	c
to	c
meet	c
there	c
,	i
while	c
she	c
was	c
at	c
her	c
swimming	c
lesson	c
.	c

When	c
that	c
day	c
arrived	c
they	c
all	c
went	c
there	c
as	c
they	c
planned	i
.	c

It	c
was	c
Sally	c
!	c

Suddenly	c
they	c
all	c
shouted	c
"	c
suprise	i
!	c
"	c
.	c

So	c
her	c
friends	c
did	c
n't	c
understand	i
that	c
she	c
knew	c
about	c
the	c
party	c
and	c
they	c
were	c
very	c
happy	c
because	c
they	c
believed	c
that	c
the	c
suprise	i
party	c
had	c
succeed	i
!	c

To	c
start	c
with	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
which	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
start	c
on	c
19:30	c
started	c
on	c
20:15	c
so	c
you	c
can	c
understand	c
that	c
we	c
were	c
45	c
minutes	c
late	c
getting	c
out	c
as	c
well	c
.	c

Then	c
,	c
they	i
were	c
not	c
any	c
discounts	c
available	c
for	c
the	c
tickets	c
as	c
it	i
was	c
written	c
on	c
the	c
advertisement	c
.	c

What	c
's	c
more	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
for	c
some	c
reasons	c
and	c
we	c
could	c
n't	c
get	c
anything	c
to	c
drink	c
or	c
eat	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
sorry	c
but	c
this	c
was	c
n't	c
my	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
two	c
possible	c
fashions	c
for	c
the	c
future	c
.	c

If	c
humans	c
turn	i
to	c
be	c
more	c
free	c
from	c
social	c
rules	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
their	c
dressing	i
will	c
also	c
be	c
very	c
extreme	c
and	c
unlimited	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
if	c
human	c
society	c
turns	i
to	c
be	i
stricher	i
and	c
more	c
limited	c
,	c
there	c
will	c
be	c
only	c
2	c
or	c
3	c
types	c
of	c
clothing	c
,	c
formed	c
by	c
the	c
needs	c
of	c
the	i
society	c
.	c

Perhaps	c
the	c
style	c
of	c
their	c
dressing	i
will	c
indicate	c
their	c
position	c
in	c
society	c
too	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

Then	c
when	c
the	c
show	c
finally	c
started	c
I	c
got	i
very	c
disappointed	c
because	c
,	i
I	c
really	c
wanted	c
to	c
see	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
but	c
instead	c
of	c
him	c
there	c
was	c
any	i
other	i
actor	c
.	c

Your	i
faithfully	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
,	c
every	c
time	c
I	c
tell	i
something	i
to	i
her	i
,	c
finally	i
everyone	c
knew	i
about	c
it	c
.	c

But	c
this	c
time	c
it	c
was	c
something	c
more	c
important	c
that	i
any	c
other	c
time	c
.	c

We	c
both	c
decided	c
to	c
finish	c
with	c
all	i
this	c
stupid	c
affair	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
difficult	c
,	c
but	c
I	i
was	c
the	c
best	c
for	c
everyone	c
.	c

Then	c
I	c
decide	c
to	c
talk	c
to	c
Katrin	c
,	i
I	c
was	c
very	c
sory	i
of	i
all	c
I	c
have	i
do	i
,	c
so	c
I	c
apologize	i
with	i
her	c
and	c
promise	i
her	c
that	c
this	c
will	i
never	i
would	i
happen	c
again	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
performance	c
,	i
Over	i
The	c
Rainbow	c
at	c
The	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
on	c
the	c
14th	c
of	c
June	c
.	c

Rescently	i
I	c
decided	c
to	c
watch	i
Over	c
The	c
Rainbow	c
,	c
a	c
very	c
famous	c
and	c
wellknown	i
show	c
.	c

He	c
was	c
n't	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
resons	i
for	c
my	c
choice	c
.	i

Finally	c
,	c
the	c
Theatre	c
Restaurant	c
was	c
under	i
reparation	i
so	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
find	c
another	c
one	c
for	c
the	i
evening	c
supper	i
.	c

This	c
was	c
n't	c
"	c
my	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
"	c
,	c
as	c
said	i
,	c
and	c
I	c
'll	c
make	c
a	c
claim	c
for	c
half	c
the	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
receiving	c
you	i
reply	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possibly	i
.	c

A	c
century	c
ago	c
,	c
when	c
a	c
farmer	c
took	c
the	c
horses	c
out	c
of	c
the	c
stable	c
and	c
put	c
the	c
plouge	i
behind	c
them	c
,	c
we	i
've	i
got	i
the	c
word	c
"	c
time	c
"	c
.	c

I	c
heard	c
the	c
different	c
phone	i
signals	i
,	c
and	c
what	i
a	c
miracle	c
you	i
can	c
change	c
them	c
on	c
the	c
train	c
when	c
you	c
are	c
restless	c
.	c

A	i
new	i
word	i
has	i
appeared	i
in	c
those	i
days	i
,	i
a	i
technical	i
proof	c
of	c
this	c
is	c
the	c
computer	c
.	c

I	c
can	c
send	c
and	c
save	c
information	c
and	c
the	c
possibilities	c
are	c
uncountless	i
.	c

Watch	c
out	i
highly	i
advanced	i
technologies	i
are	i
appropriate	i
and	c
helpful	c
for	c
me	c
and	c
others	c
if	i
we	c
only	c
remember	c
the	c
importance	c
of	c
time	i
to	c
be	c
together	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
differences	c
between	c
what	c
the	c
advertisement	c
of	i
The	i
Circle	c
theater	i
said	c
about	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
called	c
'	c
Over	c
The	c
Rainbow	c
'	c
and	c
the	c
things	c
I	c
noticed	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
there	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
as	c
I	c
had	c
read	c
the	c
advertisement	c
carefully	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
planned	c
to	c
invite	c
some	c
friends	c
to	c
have	c
dinner	c
at	c
the	c
theater	i
's	i
restaurant	c
.	c

But	c
for	i
our	c
surprise	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
out	i
of	i
order	i
.	c

At	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
all	c
these	c
circumstances	i
we	i
were	c
so	c
puzzled	c
and	c
disappointed	c
that	c
we	c
decided	c
to	c
make	c
a	c
complaint	c
.	c

Owing	c
to	c
the	c
great	c
speed	c
of	c
technological	c
development	c
,	c
people	c
need	c
to	c
lead	c
a	c
faster	c
life	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
say	c
that	c
the	c
worst	c
thing	c
of	i
this	c
development	c
for	c
me	c
is	c
that	c
more	i
and	i
more	i
I	i
experience	i
stress	c
in	c
almost	c
every	c
aspect	c
of	c
my	c
life	c
.	c

Dear	c
Manager	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
Musical	c
Show	i
,	c
OVER	c
THE	c
RAIN	c
,	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
see	c
to	i
the	c
theatre	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
may	c
undertand	i
it	c
was	c
not	c
a	c
perfect	c
night	c
and	c
I	c
am	i
not	c
pleased	c
with	c
the	c
show	c
on	i
eaven	i
with	c
your	i
services	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
look	i
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

And	c
when	c
we	c
understand	i
internet	i
,	c
we	c
thought	c
that	c
meeting	c
people	c
from	c
other	c
countrys	i
and	c
could	i
"	c
chat	i
"	c
with	c
them	c
,	i
was	c
the	c
top	i
of	c
the	i
tecnology	i
.	c

But	c
now	c
we	c
can	c
eaven	i
watch	i
his	i
face	c
,	i
Internet	i
is	c
amaizing	i
.	c

Definitly	i
we	c
should	c
try	c
to	c
understand	c
tecnology	i
,	i
if	i
we	c
know	c
how	c
to	c
use	c
it	c
,	c
tecnology	i
will	c
improve	c
our	c
way	c
of	c
life	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
make	c
a	c
suggestion	c
about	c
the	c
trip	c
on	c
behalf	c
of	c
all	c
the	c
students	c
in	c
my	c
class	c
.	c

Could	c
I	c
suggest	c
that	c
you	c
consider	c
changing	c
the	c
programme	c
?	c

It	c
might	c
be	c
a	c
good	c
idea	c
to	c
fit	c
this	c
visit	c
in	c
in	c
the	c
afternoon	c
on	c
14th	c
March	c
because	c
I	c
strongly	c
believe	c
that	c
it	c
would	c
stimulate	c
our	c
interests	c
in	c
London	c
so	c
that	c
we	c
could	c
study	c
English	c
with	c
strongest	i
motivation	c
.	c

I	c
sincerely	c
hope	c
this	c
letter	c
will	c
be	c
of	c
some	c
help	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
they	c
are	c
the	c
same	c
as	c
ordinary	c
people	c
even	c
if	c
they	c
are	c
treated	c
as	c
celebrity	i
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
noone	i
has	c
the	c
right	c
to	c
look	i
at	i
anyone	c
's	c
private	c
life	c
even	c
if	c
they	c
are	c
journalists	c
.	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
famous	c
people	c
are	c
the	c
same	c
as	c
we	c
are	c
,	c
and	c
we	c
all	c
have	c
the	c
right	c
to	c
lead	c
a	c
private	c
life	c
and	c
no	c
right	c
to	c
break	i
into	i
their	c
privacy	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
at	c
a	c
quarter	c
past	c
eight	c
,	c
forty-five	c
minutes	c
later	c
than	c
it	c
might	i
have	c
been	i
.	c

I	c
paid	c
twenty	c
pounds	c
for	c
my	c
ticket	c
because	c
,	c
as	c
you	c
may	c
know	c
,	c
there	c
were	c
not	c
discounts	i
available	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
for	c
this	c
reason	c
,	i
I	c
think	c
you	c
should	c
return	i
me	c
some	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
one	c
day	c
our	c
friendship	c
was	c
broken	c
down	i
.	c

I	c
told	c
her	c
I	c
was	c
falling	c
in	c
love	c
with	c
my	c
best	c
friend	c
and	c
she	c
decided	c
to	c
explain	i
it	i
everybody	c
in	c
our	c
group	i
,	c
despite	c
knowing	c
that	c
must	i
be	i
a	c
secret	c
.	c

Now	c
I	c
wish	c
all	c
of	c
this	c
had	c
never	c
happened	c
,	c
while	c
I	c
try	c
to	c
forget	c
it	c
laughing	i
with	c
Caballos	c
and	c
Pat	c
.	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
,	c

I	c
entered	c
in	i
this	c
competition	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
always	c
wanted	c
to	c
do	c
these	i
kind	c
of	c
things	i
.	c

If	c
it	c
is	c
no	i
problem	c
I	c
would	c
rather	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
lab	i
cabin	c
because	c
I	c
do	c
not	c
like	c
much	i
sleeping	i
on	i
the	i
floor	i
,	c
but	c
if	c
you	c
can	i
not	i
put	c
me	c
there	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
fine	c
anywhere	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
if	c
there	c
is	c
any	c
place	c
where	c
I	c
can	c
buy	c
some	c

I	c
would	c
be	c
very	c
grateful	c
if	c
you	c
could	c

Every	c
woman	c
in	c
the	c
world	c
likes	c
the	c
word	c
shopping	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
like	i
if	c
they	c
lose	c
their	c
concience	i
while	c
they	c
are	c
shopping	c
.	c

You	c
can	c
do	i
shopping	c
alone	c
,	c
with	c
friends	c
or	c
with	c
your	c
kids	c
,	c
but	c
the	c
best	c
thing	c
of	i
it	c
is	c
that	c
you	c
feel	c
that	c
you	c
have	c
all	i
the	i
power	i
while	c
you	c
are	c
buying	c
things	c
.	c

But	c
my	c
advise	i
for	c
people	c
,	i
who	c
like	c
it	c
so	c
much	c
that	c
can	i
not	i
help	c
doing	c
it	c
,	i
is	c
to	c
try	c
shopping	c
in	c
the	c
afternoon	c
,	i
at	i
this	c
hour	i
no-one	c
do	i
shopping	c
and	c
if	c
there	c
are	c
some	c
shops	c
that	c
are	c
closed	c
you	c
can	c
always	c
go	c
to	c
a	c
shopping	c
mall	c
.	c

You	c
need	c
to	c
do	c
everything	c
by	c
yourself	c
.	c

By	c
the	c
way	c
,	c
I	c
wonder	c
if	c
I	c
need	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
money	c
and	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
should	c
bring	c
.	c

Nowadays	c
in	i
a	c
family	c
shopping	i
is	c
n't	c
women	i
's	i
job	c
.	c

For	c
instance	c
,	c
you	c
want	i
to	c
buy	c
everything	c
which	c
you	c
saw	c
,	c
and	c
after	c
that	c
,	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
how	c
much	c
you	c
have	c
spent	c
.	c

It	c
will	i
be	c
very	i
awful	c
.	c

I	c
enjoy	c
shopping	c
very	c
much	c
,	i
it	i
can	c
let	i
me	c
know	c
what	c
's	c
going	c
on	c
in	c
the	c
world	c
.	c

But	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
good	c
idea	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
break	c
during	c
the	c
shopping	c
,	i
you	i
wo	c
n't	c
feel	c
so	c
tired	c
.	c

Here	c
are	i
the	c
information	c
you	c
required	i
.	c

Although	c
I	c
have	c
played	c
tennis	c
only	c
twice	c
,	c
I	c
really	c
enjoyed	c
it	c
.	c

With	i
contrast	i
to	i
this	c
,	c
I	c
can	i
swim	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
six	c
.	c

Lastly	c
,	c
could	c
you	c
please	c
tell	c
me	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
and	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
should	c
prepare	i
and	c
do	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
buy	c
insurance	c
myself	c
?	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

The	c
aim	c
of	c
this	c
report	c
is	c
to	c
suggest	c
lessons	c
and	c
some	c
activities	c
which	c
should	c
be	c
filmed	c
in	c
the	c
video	c
from	i
my	c
school	c
.	c

As	c
far	c
as	c
I	c
know	c
,	c
English	c
people	c
are	c
really	c
surprised	c
about	i
Chinese	i
students	c
'	c
advanced	c
level	c
in	c
Maths	c
,	c
as	c
well	c
as	c
the	i
knowledge	c
in	i
politics	c
.	c

You	c
can	c
find	c
students	c
use	i
traditional	c
chinese	i
ink	c
to	c
draw	c
and	c
write	c
.	c

Some	c
are	c
held	c
once	c
a	c
year	c
and	c
some	c
are	c
held	c
every	c
term	c
.	c

You	c
will	c
experience	c
a	c
different	c
life	c
in	c
them	c
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
besides	c
all	c
mentioned	i
,	c
I	c
highly	c
recommond	i
you	c
video	c
students	i
'	c
daily	c
life	c
and	c
interview	c
them	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
was	c
n't	c
the	c
leading	c
actor	c
,	c
though	c
his	c
name	c
was	c
printed	c
on	c
the	c
brochure	i
.	c

I	c
had	c
been	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
seeing	c
his	c
performance	c
for	c
ages	c
,	c
so	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
I	c
realized	c
there	c
was	c
a	c
substitute	c
on	c
the	c
stage	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
really	c
disappointed	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
angry	c
because	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
instead	c
of	c
19.30	c
,	c
too	c
.	c

Considering	c
that	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
buy	c
a	c
full-price	c
ticket	c
(	c
even	c
if	i
I	c
had	c
read	c
on	c
the	c
brochure	i
that	c
discounts	c
would	c
be	c
available	c
)	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
you	c
can	c
understand	c
my	c
anger	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
give	c
me	c
back	c
my	c
money	c
I	c
'll	c
never	c
go	c
to	c
your	c
theatre	c
again	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
people	c
do	c
n't	c
realize	c
how	c
much	c
technology	c
rules	c
their	c
life	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
Internet	i
has	c
changed	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
most	c
of	c
all	c
.	c

In	c
fact	c
,	c
now	c
I	c
can	c
write	c
to	c
friends	c
who	c
live	c
in	c
foreign	c
countries	c
,	c
for	c
exemple	i
in	i
the	c
morning	c
and	c
receive	c
back	i
their	c
answer	c
in	c
the	c
evening	c
or	c
even	c
just	c
a	c
minute	c
after	c
writing	c

I	c
am	c
really	c
glad	c
for	i
reciving	i
the	c
first	c
priec	i
in	c
your	c

I	i
will	c
be	c
very	c
plesant	i
joining	i

13th	c
JUNE	c
2000	c

I	c
had	i
only	i
to	c
stay	c
behind	c
the	c
drummer	c
suppling	i
them	c
with	c
water	c
whenever	c
they	c
wanted	c
.	c

When	c
the	c
band	c
had	c
just	c
started	c
to	c
play	c
,	c
lots	c
of	c
girls	c
started	c
to	c
jump	c
the	c
faints	i
getting	c
very	c
close	c
to	c
them	c
,	i
some	i
of	c
the	c
girls	c
started	c
to	c
take	c
their	c
clothes	c
of	i
,	c
which	c
was	c
the	c
best	c
part	c
for	c
me	c
,	c
but	c
some	c
of	c
securities	i
went	c
there	c
and	c
took	c
them	c
away	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

While	c
I	c
am	c
at	c
the	c
Camp	i
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
play	c
tennis	c
and	c
do	c
photography	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
a	c
few	c
questions	c
:	c

You	c
can	c
fall	i
on	i
a	c
very	c
disagreable	i
sellor	i
and	c
if	c
you	c
find	c
what	c
you	c
wanted	c
,	c
you	c
will	c
not	c
want	c
to	c
pay	c
him	c
or	c
her	c
for	c
it	c
.	c

Two	c
sellers	i
are	c
talking	c
and	c
although	i
they	c
saw	c
you	c
enter	c
,	c
they	c
continue	c
their	c
discussion	c
so	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
interrupt	c
them	c
.	c

Then	c
,	c
one	c
of	c
them	c
serves	c
you	c
but	c
half	c
listens	c
to	c
you	c
because	c
he	c
or	c
she	c
is	c
still	c
talking	c
to	c
the	c
other	c
sellor	i
.	c

Also	c
,	c
when	c
you	c
find	c
a	c
nice	c
sellor	i
and	c
he	c
shows	c
you	c
lots	c
of	c
objects	c
,	c
when	i
you	c
do	c
n't	c
find	c
what	c
you	c
want	c
,	c
you	c
feel	c
sad	c
for	c
him	c
or	c
her	c
because	c
you	c
made	c
him	c
or	c
her	c
lose	i
his	c
or	c
her	c
time	c
so	i
you	c
feel	c
obliged	c
to	c
buy	c
something	c
.	c

All	c
this	c
to	i
say	c
that	c
shopping	c
may	c
seem	c
enjoyable	c
but	c
often	c
is	c
not	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
,	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
when	c
we	c
arrived	c
we	c
went	c
to	c
pay	c
and	c
we	c
gave	c
a	i
discount	c
ticket	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

It	c
seemed	c
the	i
perfect	c
holiday	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
.	c

Pat	c
was	c
in	c
love	c
with	c
my	c
eldest	c
brother	c
whose	i
name	c
is	c
Jon	c
(	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
got	c
on	c
well	c
with	c
him	c
)	c
.	c

Pour	i
Pat	c
,	c
she	c
did	c
n't	c
know	c
my	c
brother	c
,	c
she	c
did	c
n't	c
know	c
how	c
he	c
was	c
.	c

From	c
activities	i
which	c
you	c
offer	c
to	i
me	c
I	c
choose	c
swimming	c
and	c
tennis	c
.	c

Also	c
I	c
find	c
that	c
it	i
sport	c
is	c
very	c
usefull	i
for	c
my	c
health	c
and	c
does	i
me	c
feel	c
better	c
.	c

At	i
first	i
,	c
which	i
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	i
need	c
take	i
with	c
me	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
anything	c
about	c
the	c
weather	c
in	c
California	c
,	c
and	c
at	i
tend	i
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	i
will	i
need	c
.	i

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

I	c
never	i
liked	i
shopping	c
.	c

It	c
always	i
was	i
trouble	i
for	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
the	c
people	c
who	c
are	i
enjoying	i
shopping	c
they	i
are	c
greede	i
for	c
materialistic	c
things	c
and	c
they	c
hav	i
n't	i
interests	i
for	i
spirit	i
(	c
?	c
)	c
,	c
intelect	i
life	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
we	c
must	c
spend	c
more	c
time	c
for	i
more	c
interesting	c
than	i
shopping	i
things	i
like	i
sport	c
,	c
reading	c
,	c
chating	i
about	c
ideas	c
which	c
make	c
our	c
lives	c
better	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
a	c
wonderful	c
surprise	c
.	c

I	c
can	c
go	c
to	c
the	i
Camp	c
California	c
only	c
in	c
July	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
school	c
in	c
June	c
and	c
I	c
must	c
work	c
in	c
my	c
father	c
's	c
bookshop	c
in	c
August	c
.	c

At	c
the	c
Camp	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
live	i
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
.	c

For	c
the	c
two	c
activities	c
I	c
can	c
choose	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
play	c
tennis	c
:	c
I	c
have	c
some	c
experience	c
in	i
this	c
sport	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
played	c
tennis	c
during	i
seven	c
years	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
still	c
my	c
favourite	c
activity	c
.	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

The	c
best	c
part	c
of	c
the	c
day	c
was	c
after	c
the	c
concert	c
,	c
when	c
I	c
met	c
the	c
group	c
"	c
U2	c
"	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
excited	c
,	c
because	c
this	c
is	c
my	c
favourite	c
group	c
:	c
I	c
'm	c
always	c
hearing	i
their	i
songs	c
.	c

I	c
took	c
some	c
photographies	i
and	c
I	c
'll	c
show	c
them	c
to	c
you	c
when	c
you	c
come	c
next	c
week	c

I	c
had	i
a	i
talk	i
with	c
Santana	c
,	c
the	c
best	c
guitarist	c
in	c
the	c
world	c
,	c
too	c
.	c

He	c
's	c
quite	c
old	c
,	c
but	c
very	c
attractive	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
playing	i
guitar	c
like	c
him	c
.	c

Odette	c

I	c
am	c
delightful	i
to	c
receive	c
your	c
letter	c
saying	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
a	c
two-week	c
holiday	c
in	c
your	c
recent	c
competition	c
and	c
it	c
will	c
all	c
paid	i
in	i
advance	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
be	c
grateful	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
arrange	c
a	c
date	c
after	c
the	c
20th	c
of	c
July	c
,	c
due	c
to	c
the	i
problems	c
beyond	c
my	c
control	c
.	c

Otherwise	c
I	c
will	c
not	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
travel	c
abroad	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
rather	c
stay	c
in	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
log	c
cabins	c
as	c
I	c
am	c
allergic	c
to	c
many	c
plants	c
and	c
insects	c
and	c
I	c
should	c
avoid	c
contacting	i
them	c
.	c

Could	c
you	c
please	c
let	c
me	c
know	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
you	c
receive	c
my	c
letter	c
.	i

Yours	c
faithfully	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

As	c
you	c
know	c
I	c
'm	c
on	c
half-term	c
school	c
holiday	c
and	c
have	c
plenty	c
of	c
time	c
to	c
do	c
much	i
more	c
different	i
things	c
apart	c
from	c
studying	c
my	c
A-level	c
history	c
,	c
such	c
as	c
meeting	c
up	c
my	i
friends	c
,	c
visiting	c
interesting	c
places	c
or	c
even	c
going	c
to	c
the	c
cinema	c
on	c
my	c
own	c
.	c

Couple	i
of	c
days	c
ago	c
I	c
bumped	c
into	c
my	c
best	c
friend	c
who	i
is	c
into	c
music	c
and	i
we	c
started	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
chat	c
about	c
what	c
we	c
had	c
both	c
been	c
doing	c
.	c

Can	c
you	c
believe	c
that	c
I	c
was	c
introduced	c
to	c
him	c
and	c
I	c
took	c
numerous	c
photographs	c
some	i
of	c
which	c
I	c
put	c
in	c
the	c
envelope	c

was	c
different	i
than	i
this	i
one	i
,	i
who	c
was	c
mentioned	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c

In	c
your	c
offer	i
I	c
noticed	c
an	i
information	c
about	c
discounts	c
which	c
were	c
supposed	c
to	c
be	c
available	c
-	c
no	c
,	c
they	c
were	c
not	c

Another	c
"	c
defect	c
"	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
was	c
an	c
"	c
invitation	c
"	c
to	c
the	c
restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c

Therefore	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
you	c
to	c
send	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
think	c
I	c
deserve	c
it	c
as	c
a	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
my	i
daily	c
life	c
is	c
full	c
of	c
modern	c
technology	c
.	c

It	c
also	c
changed	c
my	c
life-style	i
for	c
better	i
-	c
I	c
think	c
.	c

Recently	i
,	c
modern	c
technology	c
means	c
:	c
mobile	c
phones	c
,	c
computers	c
,	c
internet	i
,	c
super-fast	c
cars	c
etc.	c
These	c
improvements	c
helps	i
me	c
with	c
my	c
ordinary	c
dutes	i
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
I	i
think	c
that	c
modern	c
technology	c
makes	c
our	c
life	c
easier	c
,	i
nevertheless	i
,	c
we	c
should	c
avoid	c
any	c
possible	c
risks	c
connected	c
with	c
these	c
improvements	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
just	c
received	c
your	c
letter	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
glad	c
to	c
know	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
if	c
you	c
have	c
some	c
vacancies	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
the	c
only	c
month	c
where	c
I	c
am	c
in	i
holidays	i
.	c

About	i
the	c
accommodation	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
staying	c
in	c
tents	i
as	c
I	c
used	c
to	c
during	c
summer	c
holidays	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
child	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
you	c
asked	c
me	c
to	c
choise	i
two	c
activities	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
do	c
.	c

We	c
had	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
fun	c
during	c
our	c
last	c
holidays	i
and	c
we	c
took	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
pictures	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
,	i
I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

But	c
when	c
these	c
stores	c
are	c
full	c
of	c
people	c
,	c
crowded	c
,	c
like	c
the	i
sales	c
period	i
,	c
I	c
am	c
sure	c
that	c
the	c
same	c
people	c
who	c
like	c
doing	i
shopping	c
may	c
think	c
it	c
can	i
be	i
boring	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
with	c
regard	c
to	c
your	c
advertisment	i
.	c

secondly	i
there	c
was	c
delay	i
which	c
got	c
me	c
into	c
trouble	c
,	i
After	c
the	c
show	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
catch	c
my	c
train	c
.	c

But	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

The	c
worst	c
thing	c
is	c
that	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
watch	i
my	c
favorite	i
actor	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
n't	c
consentrate	i
on	c
the	c
play	c
any	c
more	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
waiting	c
for	c
a	c
satisfactory	c
answer	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
we	c
have	c
faced	c
some	c
problems	c
,	c
such	c
as	c
social	c
and	c
environmental	c
problems	c
.	c

Although	c
in	c
those	c
days	c
the	c
only	c
way	c
of	c
learning	c
was	c
reading	c
.	c

These	c
days	c
we	c
can	c
use	c
computer	i
,	c
television	c
and	c
some	c
sophisticated	c
equipment	c
.	i

Technology	c
has	c
a	c
huge	c
effect	c
on	c
our	c
spare	i
time	i
activities	c
as	c
well	c
.	c

Despite	c
the	c
huge	c
facilities	i
technology	i
has	c
affected	c
our	c
lives	c
negatively	c
.	c

While	c
we	c
are	c
using	c
technology	c
,	c
we	c
should	c
take	c
into	c
consideration	c
environment	i
.	c

We	c
should	c
n't	c
allow	c
to	i
be	i
exploited	i
the	i
world	i
.	c

If	c
we	c
want	c
to	c
leave	c
a	c
good	c
world	c
to	c
the	c
next	c
generations	c
,	c
we	c
should	c
behave	c
more	c
respectfully	c
againgst	i
the	i
nature	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
representing	c
an	c
English	c
class	c
,	c
which	c
is	c
going	c
on	c
a	c
three-day	c
London	c
tour	c
.	c

The	c
programme	c
you	c
suggest	c
is	c
versatile	c
and	c
full	c
of	c
interesting	c
activities	c
.	c

But	c
we	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
make	c
our	i
suggestion	c
,	c
if	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
mind	c
.	c

We	c
have	c
seen	c
an	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
and	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
this	c
exciting	c
show	c
.	c

What	c
's	c
more	c
,	c
new	c
hairstyles	c
and	c
leisure	c
and	c
sports	c
wear	c
are	c
presented	c
there	c
.	c

And	c
apart	c
from	c
it	i
,	c
this	c
activity	i
is	c
free	c
of	c
charge	c
.	c

We	c
would	c
be	c
very	c
grateful	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
change	c
our	c
programme	c
for	c
Tuesday	c
afternoon	c
.	c

We	c
are	c
thinking	c
here	c
particularly	c
of	c
the	c
fact	c
,	i
that	c
we	c
can	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
instead	c
of	c
shopping	c
.	c

Faithfully	i
yours	c
,	c

We	c
tend	c
to	c
think	c
that	c
famous	c
people	c
,	c
such	c
as	c
politicians	c
and	c
film	c
stars	c
are	i
very	c
happy	c
and	c
satisfied	c
with	c
their	c
life	c
.	c

But	c
such	c
an	c
attitude	c
is	c
wrong	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
common	c
knowledge	c
,	i
that	c
such	c
an	i
attention	c
inevitably	c
tells	c
on	c
relationships	c
in	c
the	c
family	c
.	c

Another	c
aspect	c
is	c
that	c
children	i
of	c
famous	c
people	c
suffer	c
a	c
lot	c
from	c
this	c
attention	c
.	c

And	c
last	c
,	c
but	c
not	c
least	c
is	i
the	c
fact	c
that	c
famous	c
people	c
ca	c
n't	c
express	c
their	c
emotions	c
,	c
show	i
their	c
real	c
feelings	c
to	c
public	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
sum	c
up	c
by	c
saying	c
that	c
every	c
person	c
,	c
either	i
famous	c
or	c
not	c
,	c
deserves	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
private	c
life	c
without	c
being	c
followed	c
or	c
disturbed	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
show	c
which	c
I	c
saw	c
last	c
Friday	c
at	c
your	c
theatre	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
I	c
went	c
was	i
the	c
evening	c
one	c
,	c
which	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
start	c
at	c
7:30	c
p.m.	c
but	i
it	i
had	i
a	c
41	i
minutes	i
delay	c
and	c
ended	i
up	c
starting	c
at	c
8.15	c
p.m	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
the	c
original	i
actor	c
was	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
but	c
it	i
changed	i
to	i
a	i
different	i
actor	i
which	i
acted	c
terribly	c
and	c
was	c
very	c
disappointing	c
.	c

Last	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
it	c
said	i
in	c
your	c
advertisement	c
that	c
there	c
is	c
a	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
after	i
the	c
show	c
but	c
it	c
turned	c
out	c
to	c
be	c
closed	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
redecorating	i
and	c
no	c
annocement	i
was	c
made	c
.	c

Therefore	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
are	i
refund	i
of	i
my	i
ticket	i
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
a	i
apolygists	i
.	c

Thank	i
you	i
from	i
you	i

Your	i
Sincelery	i
,	c

What	c
will	c
clothes	c
be	c
like	c
100	c
years	c
from	c
now	c
?	c

What	c
do	c
you	c
think	c
modles	i
will	c
wear	c
in	i
cat	i
walks	i
?	c

Will	c
they	c
wear	c
anything	c
?	c

Nowaday	i
,	c
people	c
look	c
at	c
fashion-magesins	i
or	c
get	c
opinions	c
from	c
their	c
friends	c
to	i
decide	c
what	c
to	c
wear	c
in	i
different	c
occasions	c

In	i
my	i
opinion	i
,	i
I	i
think	i
clothes	c
will	c
be	c
a	c
lot	c
differente	i
100	i
years	i
later	i
compare	i
to	i
now	i
.	c

If	c
you	c
walk	c
out	c
to	i
the	c
street	c
now	c
,	c
you	c
will	c
probably	c
see	c
more	c
than	c
half	c
the	c
people	c
wearing	c
clothes	c
that	c
are	c
made	c
with	i
jeans	i
which	i
is	c
incredibly	c
surprising	c
!	c

From	i
my	i
point	i
of	i
view	i
,	c
I	c
think	c
people	c
will	c
wear	c
more	c
clothes	c
that	c
are	c
see-through	c
in	c
particular	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
this	c
letter	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
my	i
good	c
experience	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
,	c
last	c
month	c
.	c

I	c
did	c
that	c
two	i
hours	c
,	i
this	i
first	c
job	c
was	c
sometimes	c
a	c
bit	c
boring	c
but	c
I	c
felt	c
like	c
someone	c
who	c
save	i
people	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
was	c
really	c
happy	c
!	c

The	i
next	i
weekend	c
I	c
have	c
an	i
appointment	i
with	c
one	c
them	i
,	c
but	c
I	c
do	i
n't	i
tell	c
you	c
the	c
name	c
because	c
you	c
'll	c
fell	i
jalous	i
!	c

Best	c
wishes	c

Before	c
and	c
after	c
this	c
period	c
is	c
impossible	c
for	c
me	c
:	c
I	c
have	c
classes	c
and	c
I	c
also	c
have	c
to	c
work	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
always	c
dreamed	c
about	c
going	c
camping	c
and	c
staying	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
this	c
way	c
is	c
better	c
to	c
keep	c
in	c
touch	c
with	c
the	i
nature	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
do	c
photografy	i
and	c
swimming	c
.	c

I	c
love	c
to	c
take	c
photos	c
but	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
techinique	i
.	c

How	c
much	c
money	c
do	c
you	c
think	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
to	c
buy	c
food	c
and	c
anything	c
else	c
I	c
will	c
need	c
?	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
from	i
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
,	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

Of	c
course	c
it	c
is	c
good	c
to	c
buy	c
things	c
for	c
ourselves	c
,	c
like	c
clothes	c
,	c
jewelery	i
,	c
anything	c
.	c

But	c
,	c
sometimes	c
,	c
go	i
shopping	c
can	c
have	c
other	c
effects	c
on	c
you	c
.	c

It	c
can	c
stress	c
you	c
.	c

When	c
you	c
buy	c
something	c
you	c
were	c
looking	c
for	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
and	c
,	c
when	c
you	c
arrive	c
at	c
home	c
,	c
you	c
discover	c
some	c
deffect	i
on	c
it	c
and	c
have	c
to	c
go	c
back	c
to	c
the	c
store	c
to	c
complain	c
.	c

And	c
,	c
a	c
really	c
bad	c
thing	c
is	c
,	c
after	c
buying	c
everything	c
you	c
wanted	c
and	c
feeling	c
very	c
happy	c
with	c
all	c
that	c
,	c
you	c
realize	c
that	c
you	c
spent	c
more	c
money	c
than	c
you	c
should	c
.	i

Remember	c
:	c
go	i
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
the	c
better	i
choice	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
choose	c
a	c
tent	c
for	c
accommodation	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
spent	c
time	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
,	c
that	c
's	c
why	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
good	c
oppotunity	i
for	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
choose	c
swimming	c
and	c
photography	c
for	i
activities	c
.	c

Lastly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
two	c
questions	c
.	c

Another	c
one	c
is	c
that	i
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
prepare	i
.	c

Your	i
sincerely	i

I	c
have	c
never	c
felt	c
such	c
as	i
satisfaction	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
have	c
time	c
,	c
drop	c
me	c
a	c
line	c
,	c
please	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
we	c
have	c
seen	c
an	c
advertisement	c
on	i
the	i
English	c
magazine	c
for	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
.	c

The	c
show	c
will	c
have	c
latest	i
fashions	c
from	c
top	i
fashion	c
designers	c
in	c
the	c
world	c
.	c

Leisure	i
show	c
will	c
have	c
leisure	i
and	c
sports	i
wear	i
,	c
new	c
make	i
up	i
style	i
and	c
new	c
hair	i
style	i
for	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

We	c
wo	c
n't	c
miss	c
any	c
programme	i
that	c
you	c
have	c
planned	c
and	c
we	c
could	c
also	c
have	c
great	i
opportunity	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

We	c
're	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
everybody	c
wants	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
happy	c
life	c
in	c
our	c
own	i
world	c
,	i
we	i
want	c
to	c
do	c
whatever	c
we	c
want	c
,	i
sometimes	i
we	c
do	c
the	c
right	c
things	c
and	c
sometimes	c
we	c
do	c
the	c
wrong	c
things	c
.	c

We	c
are	c
ordinary	c
people	c
,	i
we	i
work	c
and	c
come	i
home	c
to	c
have	i
activities	c
with	c
our	c
family	c
or	c
go	c
out	c
together	c
.	c

The	i
politicians	i
and	c
film	c
stars	c
also	c
want	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
normal	c
life	c
after	c
work	c
.	c

They	c
want	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
private	c
life	c
without	c
journalists	c
following	c
them	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
.	c

Although	i
,	c
their	c
news	c
on	c
the	c
front	c
page	c
of	c
a	c
magazine	c
can	c
catch	c
the	c
eyes	c
of	c
public	i
so	c
that	c
people	c
will	c
never	c
forget	c
them	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
,	i
if	c
the	c
journalist	i
want	c
to	c
publish	c
the	c
politicians	i
and	c
film	c
stars	i
private	c
life	i
,	c
they	c
should	c
have	i
asked	i
for	c
permission	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
this	c
letter	c
to	c
mention	c
all	c
the	c
disappointing	c
events	c
in	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
"	i
Over	c
The	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
.	c

The	c
last	c
disappointing	c
thing	c
is	c
that	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
so	c
we	c
could	c
not	c
visit	c
it	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

Therefore	c
,	c
if	c
avaliable	i
,	c
can	c
you	c
play	i
my	c
money	c
back	c
please	c
?	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

Pandora	c
had	c
done	c
something	c
very	c
bad	c
like	c
a	c
robbery	c
and	c
one	c
day	c
told	c
this	c
to	c
Pat	c
because	c
she	c
was	c
very	c
shy	i
and	c
regretful	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
she	c
did	c
n't	c
know	c
that	c
Pat	c
could	c
n't	c
keep	c
secrets	c
well	c
.	c

One	c
day	c
while	i
all	c
their	c
friends	c
were	c
there	c
and	c
talking	c
,	c
Pat	c
told	c
everyone	c
that	c
Pandora	c
had	c
done	c
a	c
robbery	c
.	c

After	c
a	c
week	c
of	i
holiday	c
,	c
when	c
Pandora	c
returned	c
she	c
learned	c
that	c
every	i
of	c
her	c
friends	c
knew	c
that	i
.	c

After	c
all	c
they	i
again	c
became	c
good	c
friends	c
but	c
Pat	c
learned	c
to	c
keep	c
secrets	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
;	i

I	c
want	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
that	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
dissapointed	i
about	c
the	c
play	c
.	c

And	c
also	c
it	c
should	c
be	i
started	c
at	c
19.30	c
,	c
as	c
I	c
saw	c
in	c
the	c
advirtisement	i
,	c
which	i
has	i
started	i
at	c
20.15	c
!	c

And	c
so	i
far	i
there	c
was	i
n't	i
any	c
discounts	c
available	c
which	c
is	i
written	i
to	c
be	c
"	c
available	c
"	c
in	c
the	c
advirtisement	i
.	c

I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
re-decoration	i
progress	i
inside	c
.	c

And	c
after	c
all	c
no	i
one	c
can	c
say	c
that	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
!	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
understand	c
me	i
and	c
correct	i
your	c
mistakes	c
in	c
the	c
next	c
advirtisement	i
and	c
send	c
me	c
my	c
money	c
soon	c
!	c

It	c
is	c
over	c
50	c
years	c
since	c
the	c
production	i
of	c
the	c
computer	c
and	c
television	c
.	c

Our	c
lifes	i
changed	i
since	c
then	c

And	c
almost	c
everybody	c
has	c
a	c
television	c
in	c
their	c
homes	c
.	c

These	c
2	c
devices	c
make	c
my	c
life	c
easier	c
.	c

I	c
ca	c
n't	c
go	c
out	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
or	c
be	c
with	c
my	c
friends	c
to	c
have	c
fun	c
.	c

Internet	i
brought	i
a	c
new	c
way	i
to	c
my	c
live	i
since	c
I	c
started	c
to	c
use	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
can	c
reach	i
any	i
knowledge	i
that	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
:	c

I	c
went	c
there	c
at	c
19.00	c
because	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
at	c
19.30	c
as	c
the	c
advertisement	c
said	c
but	c
I	c
queued	c
for	c
at	c
least	c
an	c
hour	c
because	c
the	c
ticket	c
machine	c
broke	c
down	c
.	c

However	c
I	i
bought	c
the	c
ticket	c
even	i
it	i
was	c
more	i
expensive	i
because	i
I	c
'd	c
been	c
queuing	c
for	c
ages	c
and	c
I	c
really	c
wanted	c
to	c
see	c
my	c
favourite	i
idol	c
,	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
.	c

But	c
when	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
,	c
they	c
said	c
Danny	c
was	c
n't	c
there	c
because	c
of	c
his	c
illness	c
and	c
I	c
felt	c
very	c
upset	c
and	c
dismayed	c
about	c
it	c
because	c
the	c
situation	i
I	c
had	c
was	c
unlike	c
what	c
the	c
advertisement	c
said	i
.	c

After	c
the	c
boring	c
show	c
finished	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
hungry	c
and	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
but	c
the	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
after	c
19.00	c
.	c

I	i
'd	i
a	c
very	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
and	c
my	c
anger	c
influenced	c
me	c
for	c
the	c
rest	c
of	c
my	c
holidays	c
.	c

I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
if	c
you	c
can	c
give	c
the	c
money	c
back	c
to	c
me	c
or	c
I	c
'll	c
write	c
letters	c
to	c
all	c
the	c
media	c
departments	c
to	c
show	c
how	c
tricky	i
you	c
were	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

He	c
went	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
headmaster	c
and	c
told	c
him	c
all	i
the	i
truth	c
.	c

The	c
headmaster	c
was	c
extremely	c
angry	c
about	c
it	c
and	c
he	c
gave	c
both	c
students	c
a	c
heavy	c
punishment	c
,	c
which	c
was	c
suspended	i
from	c
school	c
for	c
a	c
week	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
paper	c
planes	c
flew	c
out	c
of	c
the	c
window	c
and	c
hit	c
directly	i
to	i
the	c
headmaster	c
's	c
head	c
.	c

Everyone	c
was	c
laughing	c
and	c
the	c
headmaster	c
's	c
face	c
was	c
full	c
of	c
anger	c
.	c

Pat	c
heard	c
that	c
and	c
went	i
to	c
see	c
the	c
headmaster	c
straight	c
after	c
school	c
.	c

The	c
headmaster	c
went	c
to	c
see	c
Jon	c
and	c
Tim	c
and	c
punished	c
their	i
bad	c
behaviours	i
.	c

They	c
do	i
hate	c
him	c
so	c
much	c
.	c

Maybe	c
I	c
start	i
for	i
the	c
beginning	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
with	c
my	c
son	c
(	c
11	c
years	c
old	c
)	c
and	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
paid	i
a	i
full-prize	i
for	i
his	i
ticket	c
.	c

Hereby	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
ask	c
for	c
money	i
back	c
or	c
another	i
discounts	i
for	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
not	c
any	c
money	c
for	c
travelling	c
but	i
my	c
parents	c
were	c
able	i
to	c
give	c
me	c
them	i
if	i
I	i
only	i
had	c
a	i
concret	i
plans	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
really	i
a	i
good	c
plan	c
but	c
any	i
good	c
friends	c
.	c

Now	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
think	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
good	c
idea	c
.	c

Sometimes	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
sleep	c
on	c
a	i
railway-stations	i
or	c
under	c
a	i
bridges	c
.	c

Now	c
my	c
parents	i
'	i
do	c
n't	c
belive	i
my	c
words	i
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
will	c
not	c
feel	c
offensed	i
,	c
but	c
I	c
really	c
needed	i
to	c
contest	i
about	c
your	c
theater	i
.	c

I	c
was	c
present	c
at	c
your	c
musical	c
show	c
:	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
"	c
.	c

It	i
was	c
very	c
excited	c
thinking	c
about	c
being	c
at	c
the	c
theatre	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
though	i
with	c
certainty	c
I	c
was	c
going	c
to	c
enjoy	c
my	c
evening	c
.	c

We	c
could	c
n't	c
even	c
have	c
a	c
drink	c
,	c
because	c
,	c
obviously	c
,	c
the	c
restaurant	c
you	c
talked	c
about	c
was	c
closed	c
!	c

Really	c
,	c
what	c
a	c
mess	c
in	i
the	c
administration	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
sure	c
you	c
are	c
smart	c
enough	c
to	c
think	c
of	c
paying	c
me	c
back	c
,	c
so	c
you	c
do	c
not	c
lose	c
a	c
faithful	c
client	i
.	c

Sincerely	c
yours	c
,	c

If	c
more	c
and	c
more	c
ingenors	i
work	c
on	i
science	c
and	c
technology	c
,	c
it	c
must	c
be	c
that	i
it	c
is	c
really	c
usefull	i
:	c
but	c
in	c
what	c
particular	c
way	c
?	c

For	c
my	c
part	c
,	c
I	c
know	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
such	c
a	c
pain	i
in	i
my	i
neck	i
.	c

The	c
first	c
I	i
think	c
of	c
is	c
internet	i
.	c

What	c
a	c
great	c
invention	c
!	c

By	i
this	c
procedure	c
,	c
you	c
only	c
type	c
and	c
send	c
,	c
no	c
need	c
to	c
going	i
to	c
the	c
post-office	i
!	c

Of	c
course	c
this	c
is	c
just	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
lazy	c
,	c
I	c
actually	c
could	c
force	c
me	i
a	c
little	c
,	c
and	c
then	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
library	c
and	c
to	c
the	c
post-office	i
,	c
but	c
internet	i
just	c
makes	c
it	c
easier	c
!	c

These	c
are	c
also	c
such	i
a	c
relief	c
.	c

I	c
can	c
go	c
anywhere	c
without	c
being	c
nervous	i
about	c
the	c
fact	c
,	i
that	c
maybe	c
someone	c
is	c
trying	c
to	c
reach	c
me	c
!	c

Modern	c
technology	c
changed	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
by	c
making	c
it	c
easier	c
and	c
by	c
turning	c
me	c
into	c
a	c
lazy	c
woman	c
.	c

Really	c
,	c
this	i
prize	i
is	i
wonderful	i
to	i
have	i
a	i
healthy	i
life	i
.	c

I	c
want	c
to	c
do	c
two	c
activities	c
;	i
painting	c
and	c
tennis	c
.	c

the	i
second	c
one	c
is	c
just	c
because	c
I	c
'm	c
fanatic	i
of	c
that	c
sports	i
(	c
really	c
I	c
'm	c
not	c
martine	c
hingis	c
)	c
.	c

Eventually	i
,	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
request	c
to	i
have	i
special	i
food	c
,	c
because	c
and	i
vegetarian	c
person	i
,	c
besides	c
I	c
try	c
to	c
eat	c
just	c
organic	c
food	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
my	c
reply	c
has	c
been	c
suitable	i
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

How	c
are	c
you	c
doing	c
?	c

I	c
was	c
training	c
to	c
be	c
a	c
personal	c
assistance	i
to	c
Madonna	c
herself	c
.	c

My	c
work	i
is	c
to	c
help	c
her	c
during	c
each	c
concert	c
.	c

You	c
know	c
,	i
she	c
has	c
a	c
brilliant	c
performance	i
where	c
she	c
must	c
change	c
her	c
customs	i
,	c
make	i
up	i
,	c
scenery	i
,	c
everytime	i
;	c
so	c
she	c
needs	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
people	c
near	c
.	c

My	c
first	c
job	c
was	c
in	i
the	c
Hillsborough	i
's	i
concert	c
(	c
I	c
think	c
,	i
you	c
heard	c
about	c
it	c
)	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
n't	c
alone	c
,	i
I	c
worked	c
with	c
a	c
staff	c
of	c
ten	c
people	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
exhausted	c
when	c
the	c
concert	c
finished	c
,	i
anyway	i
it	c
has	c
been	c
one	c
of	c
my	c
best	c
experience	i
and	c
I	c
'll	c
remember	c
for	i
life	i
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
send	c
you	c
all	c
my	c
positive	c
energy	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
receiving	c
your	c
letter	i
back	i
.	c

all	c
the	c
best	c
.	c

I	c
spent	c
two	c
days	c
at	c
annual	i
international	c
arts	c
festival	c
from	c
21	c
to	c
22	c
of	c
November	c
.	c

There	c
were	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
activities	c
for	c
everyone	c
.	c

The	c
Band	i
"	c
Three	c
Kings	c
"	c
apresented	i
new	i
stily	i
of	c
music	c
.	c

From	c
my	c
point	c
of	c
view	c
I	c
can	c
complain	c
only	c
on	i
a	i
small	c
concert	c
hall	c
and	c
there	i
were	c
artist	i
from	c
only	c
six	c
countries	c
.	c

Nowadays	c
many	c
people	c
fond	i
of	c
classical	c
music	c
,	c
but	c
this	c
concert	c
was	c
too	c
small	i
that	i
's	i
why	c
many	c
people	c
had	i
to	i
miss	i
this	c
classical	c
concert	c
.	c

You	c
wrote	c
an	c
advertisment	i
that	i
people	c
from	c
more	c
than	c
15	c
deferent	i
countries	c
were	c
going	c
to	c
visit	c
this	c
concert	c
,	c
but	c
there	c
were	c
artists	c
only	i
from	i
6	c
countries	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
relly	i
pity	i
because	c
I	c
expected	c
to	c
see	c
artists	c
from	c
France	c
and	c
Italy	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
only	c
recomended	i
you	c
to	i
have	i
more	c
artists	c
and	c
a	i
classical	c
concert	c
should	c
be	c
in	c
bigger	i
hall	c
than	i
it	i
was	i
.	c

One	c
man	c
and	c
one	c
woman	c
lived	c
in	c
small	i
house	c
beside	c
the	c
sea	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
n't	c
usual	i
fish	c
,	i
it	i
was	c
Gold	i
Fish	c
and	c
it	c
asked	i
him	c
as	i
human	i
;	i
'	c
Please	c
,	c
let	c
me	c
go	c
and	c
I	c
can	c
do	c
for	i
you	i
anything	i
you	i
want	i
'	c
.	c

But	c
Ivan	c
was	c
so	i
kind	c
person	c
that	c
he	c
let	c
Gold	c
Fish	c
went	i
without	c
any	i
condition	i
.	c

She	c
persuide	i
him	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
sea	c
to	c
ask	c
a	i
lot	c
of	c
things	c
for	c
her	c
.	c

She	c
said	c
that	c
it	i
was	i
n't	i
enough	i
what	i
Gold	i
Fish	i
had	i
done	i
for	i
her	i
.	c

Ivan	c
had	c
to	c
beg	c
Gold	c
Fish	c
again	c
and	c
again	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
end	c
,	c
greedy	c
Maria	c
wanted	c
impossible	c
thing	i
.	c

She	c
said	c
that	c
Ivan	c
should	c
bring	c
Gold	c
Fish	c
to	i
home	c
and	c
Ivan	c
could	c
leave	c
this	i
house	c
because	c
she	c
did	c
n't	c
need	c
him	c
anymore	c
.	c

Maria	c
and	c
Ivan	c
were	c
again	i

Dear	c
SIR/MADAM	c
,	c
My	c
name	c
is	c
.	c

I	c
am	i
working	i
as	c
an	c
actor	c
for	c
The	c
Spanish	c
Royal	c
Theatre	c
.	c

Sunday	c
night	c
we	c
went	c
to	c
your	c
theatre	c
.	c

But	c
from	c
the	c
beginning	c
we	c
found	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
problems	c
.	c

You	c
can	c
imagine	c
how	i
were	i
our	i
faces	i
like	i
when	c
we	c
saw	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
Danny	c
,	c
but	c
Peter	c
Fox	c
,	c
who	c
was	c
on	c
the	c
stage	c
.	c

I	c
realize	c
that	c
managing	c
a	c
theatre	c
is	c
a	i
hard	c
work	c

I	c
have	c
to	c

you	c
the	i
money	c
of	i
the	c
tickets	c
back	c

Technology	c
makes	c
easier	i

I	c
ca	c
n't	c
imagine	c
how	c
my	c
life	c
would	c
be	c
without	c
a	c
washing	c
machine	c
,	c
a	c
drier	c
or	c
a	c
fridge	c
.	c

But	c
,	c
on	i
my	i
opinion	i
,	c
the	c
best	c
thing	c
is	c
that	c
I	c
can	c
stay	c
at	c
home	c
or	c
going	i
on	c
holidays	i
,	c
and	c
send	c
my	c
work	c
to	c
the	c
office	c
everyday	i

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Ryan	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
because	c
I	c
used	c
to	c
go	c
camping	c
and	c
stay	c
in	c
the	i
tent	c
.	c

However	c
I	i
would	c
like	c
to	c
attend	i
tennis	i
activity	i
.	c

While	c
I	c
was	c
studying	c
at	c
the	c
high	c
school	c
and	c
the	c
university	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
in	c
the	c
swimming	c
team	c
of	i
the	i
school	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
about	c
clothes	c
and	c
the	i
money	c
.	c

Could	c
you	c
tell	c
me	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
should	c
bring	c
?	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
your	c
answer	c
.	c

They	c
do	c
n't	c
think	c
about	c
other	c
kind	i
of	c
shopping	c
which	c
are	c
liked	i
by	i
themselves	i

The	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complaint	i
about	c
a	c
very	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
I	c
recently	c
had	c
during	c
a	c
week	c
's	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

When	c
we	c
asked	c
for	c
discounts	i
tickets	c
,	c
we	c
were	c
said	i
there	c
never	c
were	c
discount	c
offers	c
and	c
that	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
pay	c
the	i
highest	i
tickets	c
-	c
£	c
20	c
each	c
-	c
because	c
we	c
were	c
not	c
English	c
students	c
.	c

Your	c
children	i
clothes	c
in	c
100	c
years	c

But	c
let	c
's	c
see	c
my	c
point	c
of	c
view	c
.	c

In	c
a	c
hundred	c
years	c
,	c
clothes	i
would	i
certainly	c
be	c
totally	c
differents	i
than	i
ours	c
.	c

Materials	c
,	c
textures	c
and	c
colours	c
change	c
,	c
and	c
are	i
minds	c
too	c
.	c

And	c
I	c
hope	c
colours	c
wo	c
n't	c
be	c
dark	c
and	c
sad	c
but	c
very	c
bright	c
and	c
enjoyable	c
to	c
see	c
.	c

For	c
women	c
,	c
clothes	c
change	c
more	c
than	c
for	c
men	i
's	i
.	c

I	c
guess	c
they	c
will	c
wear	c
a	c
sort	c
of	c
tunique	i
upon	i
a	c
shirt	c
and	c
a	c
skirt	c
,	c
or	c
more	c
male	i
clothes	c
because	c
they	c
want	c
to	c
change	c
.	c

Finally	c
it	c
's	c
very	c
difficult	c
to	c
say	c
that	i
.	i

The	c
clothes	c
were	c
designed	c
by	c
the	c
famous	c
Jean-Paul	c
Gaultier	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr.	c
Clark	c
,	c

I	c
'm	c
a	i
italian	i
student	c
who	c
has	i
come	i
to	c
the	c
last	c
International	c
Arts	c
Festival	c
.	c

For	c
six	c
months	c
I	c
've	c
worked	c
in	c
a	c
McDonald	c
's	c
restaurant	c
in	c
Italy	c
and	c
I	c
've	c
got	c
lots	c
of	c
money	c
.	c

I	c
worked	c
eight	c
hours	c
every	c
day	c
but	i
in	c
every	c
fast-food	c
you	i
can	c
work	c
part-time	c
,	c
four	c
,	c
three	c
,	c
six	c
hours	c
every	c
day	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
work	c
in	c
a	c
fast-food	c
you	i
can	c
work	c
in	c
the	c
afternoon	c
,	c
or	c
during	c
the	c
night	c
and	i
so	c
you	c
have	c
time	c
for	c
yourself	c
.	c

In	i
the	c
staff	c
you	c
can	c
also	c
find	c
young	c
people	c
and	c
getting	i
fun	c
with	c
them	c
during	c
the	i
work	c
.	c

What	c
do	i
you	i
want	i
more	i
?	c

If	c
you	c
need	c
money	c
and	c
you	c
need	c
time	c
for	c
yourself	c
try	c
a	c
job	c
like	c
that	c
.	c

The	c
play	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
instead	c
of	c
19.30	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
I	c
could	c
not	c
get	c
a	c
discount	c
although	c
I	c
think	c
I	c
was	c
entitled	c
to	c
it	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
not	c
available	i
because	c
of	c
the	c
waiters	c
'	c
strike	c
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
not	c
only	c
my	i
evening	i
was	i
horrible	c
but	c
also	c
expensive	c
.	c

Faithfully	c
,	c

I	c
know	c
you	c
are	c
interested	c
in	c
the	c
author	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
you	c
'll	c
like	c
the	c
story	c
.	c

Firstly	c
the	c
main	c
character	c
is	c
Evans	c
,	c
a	c
retired	c
police	c
captain	c
.	c

He	c
is	c
not	c
as	c
well-known	c
as	c
Poirot	c
or	c
Miss	c
Marple	c
,	c
but	c
his	c
personality	c
it	i
quite	c
interesting	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
sure	c
you	c
'll	c
agree	c
with	c
me	c
.	c

Not	c
only	c
is	c
the	c
plot	c
interesting	c
but	c
also	c
it	c
catchs	i
your	c
attention	i
since	i
the	c
first	c
moment	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
will	c
spend	c
a	c
good	c
evening	c
listening	c
to	c
the	c
radio	c
.	c

The	c
story	c
is	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
read	c
next	c
Friday	c
at	c
8.00	c
p.m.	c
Have	c
a	c
good	c
time	c
and	c
write	c
soon	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
it	c
says	c
that	c
the	c
main	c
actor	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
be	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
.	c

An	c
actor	c
that	c
I	c
admire	c
and	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
see	c
him	i
performing	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
instead	i
of	c
Brook	c
I	c
saw	c
another	c
actor	c
,	c
totally	c
stranger	i
to	c
me	c
.	c

Secondly	c
in	i
the	c
advertisement	c
the	i
starting	c
time	c
of	c
the	c
musical	c
was	c
said	c
to	c
be	c
at	i
19:30	c
,	c
but	c
the	c
theatre	i
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
.	c

Another	c
thing	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
mention	c
is	c
the	c
discount	c
that	c
we	c
were	c
supposed	c
to	c
have	c
on	c
the	c
tickets	c
.	c

There	c
was	c
n't	c
any	c
discount	c
.	c

Lastly	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
inform	c
you	c
that	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
have	c
dinner	c
at	c
yor	i
restaurant	c
but	c
they	c
told	c
me	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
it	c
usually	c
closes	c
at	c
11:00	c
o'clock	c
.	i

and	c
the	c
musical	c
finished	c
at	c
11:30	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
closing	c
this	c
letter	c
by	c
saying	i
you	c
that	c
that	c
night	c
was	c
the	c
most	c
terrible	c
night	c
of	c
my	c
holidays	c
and	c
that	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
have	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
,	i
please	c

XX	c

How	c
has	c
modern	c
technology	c
changed	c
your	c
daily	c
life	c
.	i

The	c
first	c
thing	c
I	c
do	c
in	c
the	c
morning	c
is	c
start	c
up	c
my	c
computer	c
,	c
check	c
if	c
I	c
have	c
any	c
new	c
e-mails	c
,	c
check	c
my	c
electronic	c
calendar	c
and	c
then	c
go	c
to	c
work	c
,	c
where	c
I	c
always	c
work	c
with	c
a	c
computer	c
.	c

The	i
computer	c
has	c
become	c
my	i
second	c
nature	c
.	c

One	i
of	c
the	c
greatest	c
technological	c
achievements	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
afraid	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
I	c
cannot	c
live	c
without	c
my	c
mobile	c
phone	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
up	c
to	c
us	c
if	c
we	c
can	i
use	c
those	c
technological	c
achievements	c
in	c
the	c
right	c
way	c
,	c
and	c
make	c
our	c
lives	c
easier	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
is	i
going	c
to	c
destroy	c
you	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr.	c
Robertson	c
,	c

Your	c
programme	c
is	c
excellent	c
because	c
it	c
tries	c
to	c
offer	c
to	i
the	c
students	c
the	c
best	c
way	c
to	c
spend	c
our	i
time	c
without	c
wasting	c
time	c
in	i
silly	c
places	c
or	c
events	c
.	c

The	c
London	c
fashion	i
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
will	c
start	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
.	c

Our	c
suggestion	c
is	c
that	c
you	c
could	c
change	c
the	i
day	i
of	i
the	i
leisure	i
time	i
to	i
the	i
shopping	i
in	i
the	i
afternoon	i
.	c

It	c
's	c
important	c
to	c
respect	c
other	c
people	i
lives	c
because	c
it	i
can	c
cause	c
serious	c
problems	c
in	i
the	c
family	c
of	c
the	c
person	c
or	c
in	c
his	c
life	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
:	c

First	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
dissapointed	i
with	i
the	c
starring	i
.	c

I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
musical	c
to	c
see	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
acting	c
and	c
singing	c
,	c
but	c
he	c
did	c
n't	c
appear	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

That	c
's	c
why	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
want	c
to	c
tell	c
him	c
that	c
I	c
had	c
failed	c
my	c
natural	c
science	c
final	c
exam	c
.	c

The	c
next	c
day	c
,	c
all	c
the	c
class	c
knew	c
it	i
.	c

I	c
was	c
n't	c
too	c
worried	c
because	c
if	c
someones	i
is	i
going	c
to	c
see	c
my	c
parents	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
tell	c
them	c
before	c
not	c
talk	i
about	c
the	c
exams	c
.	c

But	c
,	c
when	i
my	c
mother	c
was	i
talking	i
with	i
Pat	c
's	c
mother	c
and	c
she	c
mentioned	c
it	c
,	c
my	i
mother	c
cancelled	c
the	c
trip	c
to	c
Africa	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
n't	c
Pat	i
fault	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
my	c
fault	c
because	c
I	c
was	c
the	c
one	c
who	c
failed	c
the	c
exam	c
and	c
also	i
,	c
I	c
knew	c
that	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

There	c
were	c
wonderful	c
plays	c
and	c
films	c
which	c
I	c
hope	c
that	i
there	c
would	i
have	i
been	i
more	c
.	i

They	c
treated	c
each	c
other	c
as	c
if	c
they	c
were	c
husband	c
and	c
wife	c
.	c

By	c
that	c
time	c
the	c
widow	c
could	c
not	c
walk	c
and	c
the	c
widower	c
could	c
not	c
see	c
.	c

The	c
widower	c
told	c
the	c
widow	c
leave	c
it	c
alone	c
as	c
they	c
could	c
n't	c
share	c
it	c
when	c
the	c
widow	c
told	c
him	c
.	c

They	c
kept	c
going	c
on	c
until	c
they	c
met	c
a	c
fat	c
,	c
small	c
man	c
.	c

He	c
came	c
and	c
said	c
to	c
the	c
widower	c
that	c
he	c
was	c
to	c
bring	i
him	c
on	c
his	c
back	c
.	c

The	c
widow	c
who	i
was	c
afaid	c
told	i
the	c
man	c
of	i
the	c
gold	c
.	c

The	c
widower	c
was	c
confused	c
and	c
they	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
lake	c
.	c

They	c
were	c
very	c
surprised	c
when	c
they	c
found	c
out	c
the	c
gold	c
was	c
cut	c
in	c
half	c
.	c

They	c
lived	c
happily	c
ever	c
after	c
.	c

This	c
story	c
happened	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
ago	c
.	c

Dear	c
Manager	c
of	c
The	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
.	c

YOUR	c
SHOW	c
STARTED	c
ALMOST	c
ONE	c
HOUR	c
LATER	i
AND	c
WITH	i
ANY	c
DISCOUNT	c
FOR	c
US	c
ON	c
THE	c
ENTRY	i
.	c

YOUR	c
ORGANISATION	c
WAS	c
A	c
GREAT	c
DISASTER	c
.	c

NOBODY	c
TELL	i
US	c
ANYTHING	c
ABOUT	c
THE	c
CHANGES	c
,	c
AND	c
WE	c
WANT	c
THAT	i
YOU	c
GIVE	i
US	c
BACK	c
THE	c
MONEY	c
.	i

Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
the	c
most	c
popular	c
boy	c
in	c
the	c
school	c
.	c

He	c
enjoyed	c
himself	c
reading	c
,	c
playing	i
piano	c
at	c
home	c
.	c

When	c
Pat	c
was	c
16	c
,	c
he	c
decided	c
to	c
change	c
his	c
way	c
of	c
live	i
,	c
spending	i
more	c
time	c
with	c
friends	c
,	c
but	c
what	c
he	i
could	i
do	c
to	c
have	i
some	c
friends	c
?	c

All	c
the	c
boys	c
of	i
the	c
class	c
went	c
to	c
Pat	c
to	c
know	i
what	c
Anna	c
was	c
doing	c
in	i
every	c
moment	c
,	c
and	c
Pat	c
was	c
becoming	c
'	c
friend	i
'	c
of	i
all	c
the	c
boys	c
.	c

He	c
was	c
very	c
happy	c
,	c
because	c
he	c
felt	c
that	c
everybody	c
loved	c
him	c
.	c

Everyone	c
,	i
less	i
Anna	c
.	c

At	i
least	i
,	c
Pat	c
did	c
n't	c
have	c
any	c
friend	i
,	c
because	c
he	c
did	c
n't	c
have	c
anything	c
to	i
sell	i
about	i
Anna	i
.	c

I	c
think	c
NO	i
!	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
.	i

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
very	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
.	c

And	i
I	c
'll	c
try	c
to	c
explain	c
why	c
.	c

It	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
said	c
that	c
it	c
starts	i
at	c
19:30	c
.	c

As	c
a	c
result	c
I	i
missed	c
my	c
train	c
.	c

The	c
third	c
problem	c
was	c
the	c
discounts	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
lack	c
of	c
stuth	i

With	c
the	i
best	c
wishes	c

We	c
know	c
that	c
everything	c
is	c
changing	c
.	c

Not	c
so	c
long	c
ago	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
many	c
things	c
by	c
our	i
hand	c
,	c
but	c
now	c
there	c
re	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
machines	c
to	c
do	c
the	c
same	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
organising	c
the	c
trip	c
to	c
London	c

This	c
is	c
great	i
opportunity	c
for	c
the	c
student	i
to	c
learn	c
the	i
changing	i
in	c
fashion	c
and	c
leisure	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
free	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
we	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
change	c
the	c
plans	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
and	c
Wednesday	c
in	c
the	c
morning	c
.	c

On	c
Tuesday	c
morning	c
,	c
we	c
will	c
visit	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
show	c
instead	c
of	c
visiting	c
Science	i
Museum	c
and	c
we	c
will	c
go	c
there	c
tomorrow	i
morning	c
.	c

Visiting	i
National	i
Art	c
Gallery	c
should	c
be	c
cancelled	c
because	c
it	c
has	i
a	i
similar	i
idea	i
comparing	i
to	i
the	i
programme	i
that	i
we	i
would	i
like	i
to	i
go	i
on	i
Tuesday	i
morning	i
.	c

That	c
all	i
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
recommend	c
you	c
.	i

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Obviously	c
,	c
they	c
have	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
fans	c
and	c
their	c
fans	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
what	c
happened	i
to	c
them	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
,	c
their	c
life	i
may	c
be	c
the	i
good	c
example	c
for	c
other	c
people	c
to	c
follow	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
there	c
is	i
other	i
disadvantages	c
that	c
we	c
should	c
consider	c
.	c

The	c
reason	c
that	i
they	c
know	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
that	i
famous	c
people	c
wear	c
is	c
these	c
people	c
have	c
a	c
public	c
life	c
.	c

Many	c
thanks	c
for	c
giving	c
me	c
a	c
chance	c
to	c
stay	c
at	c
the	c
Camp	c
California	c
in	c
the	c
U.S.A	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
I	c
could	c
leave	c
for	c
the	c
camp	c
in	c
July	c
.	c

Because	c
I	c
'm	c
supposed	c
to	c
attend	c
an	c
English	c
course	c
in	c
Weymouth	c
,	c
England	c
until	c
June	c
and	c
then	c
I	c
'm	c
going	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
Europe	c
with	c
my	c
sister	c
who	c
came	c
from	c
my	c
country	c
4	c
weeks	c
ago	c
for	c
this	c
trip	c
.	c

And	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
as	i
I	c
have	c
n't	c
stayed	c
in	c
a	c
cabin	c
,	c
I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
staying	c
in	c
a	c
cabin	c
.	c

Which	i
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	i
have	c
to	c
bring	c
and	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	i
will	i
need	c
?	c

I	i
'll	i
be	c
grateful	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
send	c
me	c
further	c
information	c
.	c

I	c
thought	c
going	c
shopping	c
was	c
suitable	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

Especially	c
when	c
I	c
visit	c
somewhere	c
for	c
the	c
first	c
time	c
or	c
I	c
have	c
nothing	c
to	c
do	c
,	c
but	c
lots	c
of	c
time	c
,	c
I	c
naturally	c
and	c
automatically	c
look	c
for	c
a	c
decent	c
shopping	c
centre	c
.	c

I	c
ca	c
n't	c
make	c
enough	c
money	c
for	c
my	c
living	c
expense	i
.	c

I	c
really	c
wanted	c
to	c
buy	c
it	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
afford	c
to	c
buy	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
realised	c
that	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

I	c
refer	c
to	c
your	c
letter	c
in	c
which	c
you	c
informed	c
me	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
prise	i
in	c
the	c
competition	c
.	c

You	c
asked	c
me	c
for	c
some	c
further	c
information	c
and	c
hear	i
are	c
my	c
"	c
desirs	i
"	c
:	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
only	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
in	c
August	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
study	c
for	c
an	c
exam	c
.	c

Further	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
live	i
in	c
a	c
tent	c
at	c
the	c
Camp	i
,	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
already	c
used	c
to	c
that	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
often	c
spent	i
my	c
holidays	c
in	c
tents	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
do	c
painting	c
,	c
because	c
one	c
of	c
my	c
greatest	c
hobbies	c
is	c
silk-painting	i
and	c
so	c
I	c
think	c
I	c
can	c
improve	c
my	c
abilities	c
.	c

The	c
second	c
activity	c
,	i
which	c
I	c
choose	c
is	c
playing	c
basketball	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
love	c
this	c
wonderful	c
sport	c
.	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

You	c
know	c
,	c
last	c
month	c
I	c
helped	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
sure	c
you	c
want	c
to	c
know	c
some	c
details	c
.	c

My	c
first	c
task	c
was	c
to	c
open	c
the	c
doors	c
to	c
let	c
in	c
all	c
the	c
fans	i
of	i
Britney	i
Spears	i
.	c

Two	c
girls	c
came	c
together	c
and	c
they	c
wanted	c
to	c
go	c
in	c
with	c
only	c
one	c
ticket	c
for	c
both	c
!	i

She	c
started	c
crying	c
.	c

Such	c
a	c
poor	c
girl	c
.	i

This	c
part	c
of	c
my	c
work	c
was	c
really	c
funny	c
and	c
I	c
enjoyed	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
,	c
on	i
the	i
name	i
of	i
all	c
my	c
English	c
class	c
,	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
the	c
opportunity	c
you	c
give	i
us	c
to	c
spend	c
three	c
days	c
in	c
London	c
,	c
but	c
also	c
to	c
suggest	c
some	c
modifications	c
in	i
the	c
programme	c
.	c

The	c
programme	c
you	c
has	i
already	c
organised	c
is	c
very	c
interesting	c
,	c
especially	c
because	c
it	c
provides	c
a	c
good	c
combination	c
between	i
cultural	c
visits	c
and	c
more	c
relaxed	c
activities	c
.	c

The	c
only	c
day	c
we	c
can	c
attend	c
to	i
this	c
show	c
is	c
the	i
Tuesday	c
14th	c
March	c
from	c
10	c
am	c
to	c
7	c
pm	c
in	c
the	c
Central	c
Exhibition	c
Hall	c
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
I	c
suggest	c
that	c
we	c
go	c
directly	c
after	i
the	i
Science	i
Museum	i
to	i
the	i
show	i
.	c

We	c
all	c
agree	c
that	c
we	c
have	c
enough	c
time	c
in	i
Wednesday	c
for	c
shopping	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
that	c
you	c
will	c
agree	c
with	i
this	c
suggestion	c
.	c

Famous	c
people	c
,	c
such	c
as	c
politicians	c
and	c
film	c
stars	c
,	c
deserve	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
private	c
life	c
without	c
journalists	c
fellowing	i
them	c
all	c
the	c
time	c

But	c
do	c
we	c
think	c
enough	c
about	c
the	c
right	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
private	c
life	c
?	c

We	c
can	c
watch	i
this	c
problem	c
from	c
two	c
different	c
points	c
of	c
view	c
.	c

If	c
we	c
do	c
n't	c
want	c
to	c
be	c
in	c
the	c
newspapers	c
,	c
we	c
do	c
n't	c
do	i
politics	c
or	c
movies	i
!	c

As	c
public	c
people	c
,	c
stars	c
and	c
politicians	c
have	c
to	c
accord	i
some	c
time	c
to	c
their	c
public	c
but	c
fans	c
and	c
press	c
people	c
have	c
to	c
respect	c
their	c
private	c
life	c
and	c
to	c
stay	c
polite	c
and	c
respectful	c
.	c

Especially	i
,	c
sightseeing	c
by	c
bus	c
in	c
the	c
morning	c
and	c
river	i
trip	c
to	c
Greenwich	c
in	c
the	c
afternoon	c
are	c
exciting	c
activities	c
.	c

On	i
your	i
program	i
of	i
Tuesday	c
is	c
very	c
interesting	c
.	c

Fortunately	c
,	c
there	c
is	c
the	c
London	c
fashion	c
and	c
leisure	c
show	c
which	i
is	c
held	c
once	c
a	c
year	c
.	c

The	c
admission	c
is	c
free	c
for	c
students	c
.	c

The	c
show	c
starts	c
at	c
10.00	c
and	c
finishes	c
at	c
19.00	c
so	c
we	c
can	c
change	c
our	c
afternoon	c
program	i
to	i
go	c
to	c
the	c
show	c
at	c
Central	i
Exhibition	c
Hall	c
instead	c
.	c

Home	c
is	c
institution	i
that	c
create	i
human	i
and	c
make	i
them	c
as	i
a	i
person	i
and	c
a	i
good	c
member	i
in	i
their	c
communities	c
.	c

The	i
door	c
it	i
is	c
broken	c
,	c
we	c
can	c
replace	c
it	c
rapidly	i
and	c
it	c
is	c
not	c
expensive	c
when	c
it	c
is	c
plastic	c
.	c

We	c
have	c
more	c
time	c
for	c
the	c
family	c
who	i
need	i
mostly	i
care	c
and	c
love	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
in	c
response	c
to	c
your	c
advertisement	c
about	c
the	c
annual	c
international	c
arts	c
festival	c
.	c

I	c
really	c
think	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
great	c
idea	c
to	c
organize	c
such	c
a	c
festival	c
in	c
our	c
city	c
as	c
there	c
are	c
lots	c
of	c
people	c
fond	c
of	c
art	c
over	c
here	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
sure	c
they	c
are	c
all	c
very	c
grateful	c
to	c
you	c
now	c
.	c

I	c
've	c
already	c
been	c
to	c
the	c
festival	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
's	c
really	c
important	c
to	c
let	c
people	c
see	c
artists	c
from	c
all	c
over	c
the	c
world	c
.	c

But	c
your	c
idea	c
about	c
the	c
weekend	c
ticket	c
is	c
just	c
excellent	c
,	c
people	c
from	c
the	c
whole	c
country	c
get	c
the	c
opportunity	c
to	c
visit	c
your	c
festival	c
and	c
see	c
all	c
the	c
events	c
you	c
are	c
offering	c
.	c

I	c
've	c
got	c
just	c
one	c
more	c
suggestion	c
for	c
next	c
year	c
's	c
festival	c
.	c

You	c
could	c
probably	c
show	c
a	c
little	i
bit	i
more	c
films	c
and	c
interviews	c
with	c
the	c
most	c
interesting	c
artists	c
.	c

Howe	i
are	c
things	c
going	c
over	c
there	c
?	c

It	c
's	c
quite	c
difficult	c
to	c
talk	c
bout	i
our	c
school	c
rules	c
actually	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
'll	c
try	c
to	c
help	c
you	c
somehow	c
.	c

Hope	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
interesting	c
for	c
you	c
.	c

Our	c
teaches	i
do	c
n't	c
let	c
us	c
smoke	c
of	i
course	c
,	c
but	c
you	c
can	c
always	c
see	c
some	c
students	c
smoking	c
outside	c
,	c
so	c
it	c
's	c
not	c
that	c
strict	c
to	c
be	c
honest	c
.	c

When	i
you	i
mentioned	i
the	i
period	i
of	i
my	i
travelling	i
I	c
'm	c
afraid	c
I	c
only	i
free	c
in	c
July	c
.	c

Because	c
I	c
go	c
on	c
holiday	c
in	c
July	c
naturally	i
,	c
and	c
I	c
have	i
two	i
terms	i
in	i
June	c
and	c
August	c
.	c

Therefore	c
,	c
I	c
hope	c
that	c
you	c
could	i
make	i
suitable	i
arguement	i
between	c
you	c
and	c
me	c
.	c

If	c
I	c
get	c
two	c
choices	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
swimming	c
and	c
take	c
photographs	c
.	c

Esepically	i
,	c
it	c
is	i
really	c
good	c
for	c
my	c
healthy	i
during	i
the	i
growth	i
period	i
.	c

Therefore	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
do	c
those	c
two	c
activities	c
.	c

Do	c
I	c
need	c
take	i
too	i
much	i
clothes	c
?	c

Could	c
you	c
tell	c
me	c
that	i
the	c
amount	c
of	c
money	c
I	c
can	i
bring	i
during	c
the	c
holiday	c
?	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
!	c

Your	i
sincerely	c

There	c
are	c
more	c
and	c
more	c
retailors	i
are	i
opening	c
to	i
customer	i
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
women	c
are	i
really	i
enjoying	i
shopping	c
.	c

It	i
seems	i
a	i
human	i
activity	i
during	i
their	i
spare	i
time	i
.	c

I	c
think	c
most	c
of	i
gentlemen	i
dislike	c
shopping	c
.	c

I	c
believed	i
that	c
most	c
of	i
busy	c
people	c
want	c
go	i
shopping	c
by	i
the	c
easy	i
and	i
quick	i
way	c
.	c

Therefore	c
,	c
they	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
use	c
"	c
e-shopping	c
"	c
which	i
is	c
getting	i
better	i
for	i
their	i
time	i
.	c

The	c
life	i
style	i
has	c
change	i
already	c
from	c
past	i
.	c

Shopping	c
is	c
common	i
activity	c
in	c
their	c
life	c
.	c

We	c
must	c
focus	c
on	c
the	c
specific	c
life	i
style	i
,	c
which	c
will	c
make	c
us	c
enjoyable	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
because	c
there	c
were	c
deviations	c
from	c
the	c
advertisement	c
which	c
is	i
published	c
on	i
the	c
newspaper	c
.	c

As	c
a	c
result	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
pay	c
the	c
full	c
price	c
of	c
£	c
15	c
.	c

I	c
am	i
not	c
really	c
satisfied	c
about	i
the	c
show	c
and	c
I	c
certainly	c
believe	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
a	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
.	c

but	i
this	i
idea	i
was	i
soon	i
be	i
put	i
off	i
since	c
I	c
noticed	c
on	i
the	c
newspaper	c
that	c
I	c
had	c
won	c
the	c
writing	c
competition	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
n't	c
believe	c
my	c
luck	c
,	i
I	c
was	i
really	i
sure	i
that	i
I	i
won	i
a	c
return	c
ticket	c
to	c
the	c
Meditarenian	i
Sea	c
.	c

The	i
last	c
few	c
days	c
,	c
we	c
spent	c
our	c
time	c
on	i
sightseeing	c
and	c
shopping	c
.	c

I	c
must	c
admit	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
the	c
greatest	c
time	c
I	c
have	c
ever	c
had	c
in	c
my	c
life	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
last	c
day	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
packing	c
and	c
getting	c
ready	c
to	c
leave	c
,	c
I	c
realised	c
I	c
had	c
lost	c
my	c
passport	c
and	c
tickets	c
.	c

A	c
horrible	c
thought	c
suddenly	c
came	c
into	c
my	c
mind	c
.	c

Thirdly	c
,	c
someone	i
on	c
stage	c
was	c
very	c
strenge	i
for	i
me	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
expected	c
to	c
see	c
"	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
"	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

Have	c
you	c
ever	c
been	c
in	i
the	c
Countryside	c
?	c

How	i
much	c
the	i
technology	c
gives	c
to	c
you	c
,	c
it	c
take	i
from	i
you	i
more	i

These	i
all	i
happen	i
from	i
human	i

with	i
science	i
and	i
technology	i
,	i
not	i
the	i
natural	i
which	i
the	i
world	i
gives	i
it	i
to	i
us	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
never	c
expected	i
that	c
I	c
could	c
be	c
so	c
decepted	i

This	c
is	c
not	c
the	c
firt	i
time	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
in	i
your	c
theatre	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
I	c
have	c
enjoyed	c
many	c
other	c
plays	c
,	c
but	c
be	c
sure	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
"	c
will	c
be	c
the	c
last	c
one	c
.	c

As	c
I	c
am	c
specially	c
fond	c
of	c
musicals	c
,	c
I	c
even	c
travel	c
abroad	c
to	c
see	c
what	c
's	c
new	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
probably	c
one	c
of	c
the	i
most	c
devoted	c
customers	c
.	c

There	c
was	c
no	c
reason	c
either	c
for	c
the	c
delay	c
.	c

Almost	c
an	c
hour	c
!	c

None	i
an	i
announcement	c
,	c
not	i
an	i
invitation	i
...	c
oh	c
,	c
yes	c
,	c
I	c
forgot	c
.	c

The	c
bar	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

That	c
terrible	c
place	c
definitively	i
needed	c
a	i
renewal	i
.	c

Well	c
,	c
this	c
is	c
not	c
my	c
idea	c
of	c
a	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
,	c
as	c
you	c
can	c
realise	i
.	c

How	c
can	c
we	c
define	c
this	c
crazy	c
and	c
continuous	c
change	c
of	c
colours	c
,	c
shapes	c
,	c
patterns	c
,	c
and	c
uses	c
?	c

All	i
in	i
fashion	c
pass	i
away	c
in	c
a	c
couple	c
of	c
months	c
and	c
has	c
to	c
be	c
created	c
again	c
.	c

Have	c
you	c
notice	i
that	c
all	c
the	c
classic	c
gentlemen	c
wear	c
same	i
tipe	i
of	c
suit	c
?	c

And	c
what	c
about	c
this	i
kind	i
of	c
intellectual	c
and	c
progressive	c
people	c
,	c
do	c
n't	c
they	c
wear	i
all	i
the	c
same	c
model	i
of	c
ugly	c
but	c
confortable	i
shoes	c
?	c

I	c
am	c
sure	c
that	c
fashion	c
will	c
survive	c
for	c
ages	c
,	c
even	i
it	i
will	i
change	c
to	c
become	c
easier	c
to	c
use	c
and	c
clean	i
,	c
because	c
we	c
all	c
need	c
to	c
feel	c
a	c
part	c
of	c
our	c
society	c
,	c
comunicate	i
our	c
way	c
of	c
living	c
and	c
thinking	c
,	c
be	c
part	c
of	c
a	c
group	c
and	c
,	c
at	c
the	c
same	c
time	c
be	i
different	c
.	c

The	c
future	c
will	c
bring	c
to	c
us	c
new	c
concepts	c
,	c
adapted	c
to	c
our	c
lives	c

Dear	c
Mr/Mss	i

I	c
had	c
a	c
week	i
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
spend	c
my	c
last	c
evening	c
with	i
great	i
pleasure	i
,	c
however	c
it	c
was	c
the	c
worse	i
evening	c
in	c
my	c
life	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
my	c
dream	c
to	c
see	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
,	c
so	c
it	c
is	c
still	c
my	c
dream	c
because	c
of	c
your	c
show	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
'll	c
understand	c
my	c
situation	c
and	c
if	c
you	c
want	c
other	c
people	c
to	c
visit	c
your	c
show	c
,	c
you	c
should	c
return	c
my	c
money	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfuly	i

When	c
Thomas	c
Adison	c
invented	c
an	i
electric	c
light	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
the	c
greatest	c
invention	c
for	c
people	c
of	c
that	c
centure	i
.	c

And	c
nowadays	c
modern	c
technology	c
can	c
change	c
all	c
our	c
life	i
.	c

I	c
mean	c
,	c
almost	c
everyone	c
has	i
now	i
a	c
car	c
,	c
a	c
computer	c
,	c
a	c
mobil	i
phone	c
and	c
even	c
an	c
airplane	c
.	c

My	c
life	c
is	c
changing	c
too	c
.	c

Second	c
modern	i
technology	c
helps	c
me	c
in	c
the	c
kitchen	c
.	c

Further	i
more	i
,	c
yesterday	c
I	i
've	i
heard	i
that	c
every	c
man	c
could	c
fly	c
to	i
the	i
space	c
without	c
any	c
experience	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
great	c
,	c
from	c
my	c
point	c
of	c
view	c
in	i
2050	i
year	i
everybody	c
will	c
fly	c
to	i
the	i
space	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
people	i
can	c
atrophided	i
of	c
all	c
this	i
inventions	c
.	c

He	i
become	c
lazy	c
because	c
they	c
know	c
that	c
they	c
can	c
seat	i
on	c
the	c
sofa	c
and	c
turn	i
the	c
chances	i
on	c
the	c
TV	c
by	c
pressing	c
a	c
boton	i

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
:	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
show	c
that	c
I	c
saw	c
the	c
other	c
day	c
in	i
your	c
theatre	c
.	c

-	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
and	c
not	c
at	c
19.30	c
.	c

Please	c
check	c
your	c
times	c
because	c
many	c
people	c
had	c
to	c
leave	c
at	i
the	c
middle	c
of	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
that	i
evening	c
was	c
not	c
"	c
my	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
"	c
so	c
I	c
want	c
you	c
to	c
refund	c
me	i
the	i
money	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
your	c
reply	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
the	c
car	c
was	c
developed	c
by	i
the	i
modern	c
technology	c
,	i
it	i
makes	c
your	c
life	c
easier	c
but	c
also	c
"	i
dangerous	c
"	c
.	c

And	c
all	i
people	i
know	i
that	c
CO2	c
is	c
a	c
very	c
dangerous	c
gas	c
for	c
all	c
kind	i
of	c
animals	c
.	c

Dear	c
Manager	c
,	c

In	c
addition	c
,	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
the	c
reason	c
why	c
the	c
actor	c
was	c
changed	i
.	c

The	c
Ad	i
.	i

As	c
above	i
mentioned	i
,	c
it	c
can	i
not	i
be	c
a	c
"	c
perfect	c
evening	c
"	c
.	c

She	c
told	i
about	i
our	i
plan	i
,	i
indeed	i
our	i
"	i
secret	i
plan	i
"	i
,	i
to	i
Sally	i
!	c

How	c
foolish	c
!	c

But	c
,	c
Mark	c
,	c
Pat	c
and	c
I	c
were	c
planning	c
a	c
birthday-party	i
for	c
Sally	c
on	c
June	c
2	c
at	c
her	c
own	c
home	c
.	c

Sally	c
's	c
husband	c
is	c
now	c
in	c
Singapore	c
on	c
business	c
,	c
so	c
she	c
had	c
to	c
spend	c
her	c
birthday	c
without	c
him	c
.	c

In	c
spite	c
of	c
such	c
difficulties	c
,	c
she	c
always	c
shows	i
a	c
pretty	c
charming	i
smile	c
to	i
us	c

Suddenly	c

the	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

The	i
last	i
week	c
I	c
have	i
been	i
to	c
London	c
for	c
a	c
holiday	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
advertisement	c
you	c
told	c
me	c
I	c
would	c
have	i
discounts	i
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
when	c
the	c
main	c
actor	c
can	i
not	i
do	c
the	c
show	c
it	c
is	c
better	c
not	c
do	i
the	c
show	c
than	c
do	i
it	c
with	c
a	c
horrible	c
actor	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
also	c
told	c
Sally	c
my	c
secret	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
terrible	c
!	c
!	c

Paul	c
ask	i
Pat	c
what	c
had	c
happened	c
and	c
she	c
told	c
him	c
my	c
secret	c
.	c

One	c
friend	c
of	c
mine	c
told	c
me	c
that	c
Pat	c
had	c
told	c
Paul	c
my	c
secret	c
and	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
speak	c
with	c
her	c
.	c

Now	c
we	c
are	c
friends	c
but	c
I	c
know	c
that	c
I	c
can	i
not	i
tell	c
her	c
any	c
secret	i
.	c

Personally	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
can	i
be	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
something	c
we	c
all	c
want	c
to	c
attent	i
to	i
,	c
and	c
we	c
are	c
all	c
fond	i
of	i
the	c
latest	c
fashion	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
n't	c
sure	c
of	c
what	c
to	c
do	c
,	c
and	c
the	c
pressure	c
of	c
everyone	c
watching	c
me	c
,	i
was	c
driving	c
me	c
mad	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
listen	i
the	c
crowd	c
shouting	c
'	c
Go	c
,	c
Go	i
'	c
.	c

That	c
was	c
my	c
only	c
chance.	c
.	i

I	c
was	c
already	c
paralysed	c
,	c
and	c
that	c
would	c
n't	c
help	c
me	c
at	c
all	c
.	c

Then	c
,	c
by	c
some	c
'	c
strange	c
power	c
'	c
my	i
left	c
foot	c
was	c
moving	c
and	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
stop	c
it	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
too	c
difficult	c
.	c

This	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
because	i
we	c
are	c
all	c
intrested	i
in	c
clothes	c
,	c
sports	c
and	c
fashion	c
.	c

Please	c
think	c
about	c
this	c
and	c
give	c
us	c
an	c
answer	c
.	c

Thanks	c
a	c
lot	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

Therefore	c
I	c
read	c
Agatha	c
Christie	c
's	c
,,Best	i
Detective	c
Stories	c
of	c
Agatha	c
Christie	c
"	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
also	c
a	c
suitable	c
present	c
for	c
your	c
cousin	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
.	c

One	c
story	c
is	c
about	c
ten	c
persons	i
who	c
stay	c
together	c
in	c
a	c
hotel	c
on	c
a	c
lonely	c
island	c
.	c

Believe	c
me	c
,	c
you	c
would	c
never	c
guess	c
who	c
the	c
killer	c
is	c
!	c

But	c
I	c
will	c
not	c
tell	c
you	c
more	i
.	c

And	c
if	c
your	c
cousin	c
likes	c
crime	c
stories	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
perfect	c
book	c
!	c

But	c
do	c
not	c
worry	c
about	c
the	c
price	c
because	c
your	c
cousin	c
will	c
love	c
it	c
!	c

Nevertheless	c
,	c
the	c
students	c
in	c
my	c
class	c
have	c
some	c
suggestions	c
for	c
you	c
how	i
to	c
make	c
it	c
even	c
more	c
interesting	c
.	c

It	c
will	c
be	c
held	c
in	c
Central	i
Exhibition	c
Hall	c
in	c
London	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
,	c
14th	c
of	c
March	c
,	c
from	c
10.00	c
to	c
19.00	c
.	c

Naturally	c
,	c
all	c
the	c
students	c
are	c
interested	c
in	c
it	c
because	c
the	c
latest	c
fashions	c
,	c
leisure	c
and	c
sports	c
wear	c
,	c
make	i
up	i
and	c
hairstyles	c
will	c
be	c
shown	c
there	c
.	c

Futhermore	i
,	c
students	c
can	c
enter	c
free	c
!	c

Probably	c
,	c
you	c
will	c
agree	c
just	i
to	c
put	i
London	i
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
instead	c
of	c
Science	i
Museum	c
and	c
shopping	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Perhaps	c
,	c
there	c
will	c
be	c
personal	c
computers	c
,	i
which	c
will	c
control	c
every	i
thing	i
,	c
every	c
item	c
of	c
furiture	i
,	c
light	c
,	c
temperature	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
they	c
will	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
create	c
a	c
special	c
climate	c
for	c
each	c
room	c
.	c

All	c
the	c
rubbish	c
,	c
dust	c
,	c
dirty	c
dishes	c
,	c
plates	c
,	c
caps	i
will	c
be	c
washed	i
and	i
cleaned	i
automaticly	i
.	c

This	c
is	c
my	c
opinion	i
of	c
the	c
Home	c
of	c
the	c
Future	c
and	c
I	c
wish	c
I	c
could	c
live	c
in	c
it	c
.	c

TO	i
MAKE	i
MATTER	i
WORSE	i
,	c
THE	c
SHOW	c
DELAYED	i
STARTING	i
AT	c
20:15	c
.	c

I	c
AM	c
VERY	c
DISAPPOINTED	c
,	c
BECAUSE	c
THAT	c
EVENING	c
OUT	c
WAS	c
NOT	c
PERFECT	i
AS	c
I	c
HAD	c
PLANNED	c
.	c

SO	c
,	c
I	c
WOULD	c
BE	c
GRATEFUL	c
IF	c
YOU	c
COULD	c
REFUND	c
OF	i
ALL	c
OR	c
PART	c
OF	c
MY	i
MONEY	c
WHICH	c
I	c
PAID	c

A	c

OF	c
THIS	c

'S	c
DAILY	c
LIFE	i
HAS	i
BEEN	c
CHANGING	c
AS	c
WELL	c

AS	c
FAR	c
AS	c
I	c
'M	c
CONCERNED	c
,	c
I	c
FIRMLY	c
BELIEVE	c
THAT	c
,	i
IT	c
'S	c
WORTH	c
TO	i
POINTING	i
OUT	c
THE	c
FOLLOWING	c
:	c

FIRST	c
AND	c
FOREMOST	c
,	c
IT	c
'S	c
IMPORTANT	c
TO	c
REMEMBER	c
THAT	c
TODAY	c
IT	c
IS	c
EASIER	c
TO	c
TRAVEL	c
AROUND	c
THE	c
WORLD	c
BECAUSE	c
NOWADAYS	c
THERE	c
ARE	c
LOTS	c
OF	c
GOOD	c
AND	c
FAST	c
WAYS	i
OF	c
TRANSPORT	c
.	c

SECONDLY	c
,	c
WE	c
CA	c
N'T	c
FORGET	c
EITHER	c
THAT	c
ALL	c
OF	c
US	c
HAVE	c
CONDITIONS	i
TO	c
COMMUNICATE	c
WITH	c
PEOPLE	c
BY	c
MOBILE	c
PHONES	i
,	c
BY	c
INTERNET	i
,	c
WHO	c
LIVE	c
NOT	c
ONLY	c
IN	c
THIS	c
COUNTRY	c
,	c
BUT	c
ALSO	c
ABROAD	c
.	c

During	c
my	c
visit	c
to	c
London	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
the	c
opportunity	c
to	c
visit	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
and	c
to	c
see	c
'	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
'	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
advertisement	c
,	c
it	c
said	c
that	c
discounts	c
were	c
available	c
.	c

However	c
by	i
the	c
time	c
the	c
show	c
had	c
ended	c
the	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
further	c
humiliated	c
by	c
the	c
irony	c
of	c
the	c
advertisement	c
stating	i
that	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
my	c
'	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
'	c
,	c
when	c
it	c
was	c
totally	i
the	c
opposite	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
understand	c
my	c
disappointment	c
.	c

The	c
invention	c
of	c
cars	c
planes	i
,	c
trains	c
and	c
other	c
similar	c
forms	c
of	c
transportation	c
have	i
enabled	c
us	c
to	c
go	c
from	c
one	c
place	c
to	c
another	c
with	i
no	i
time	i
.	c

This	c
has	c
made	c
my	c
life	c
easier	c
.	c

There	c
are	c
many	c
indispensable	c
electrical	c
appliances	c
such	i
as	c
television	c
,	c
radio	c
,	c
fax	c
machines	c
,	c
and	c
microwaves	c
.	c

They	c
are	c
particularly	c
useful	c
for	c
someone	c
like	c
me	c
who	c
travels	i
often	i
.	c

Before	c
I	c
used	c
computers	c
generally	i
,	c
It	i
took	c
so	c
much	c
time	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
looking	i
up	c
words	c
in	c
a	c
dictionary	c
and	c
looking	i
up	c
for	i
information	c
.	c

The	i
modern	i
technology	c
helps	c
people	c
in	c
many	c
ways	c
and	c
is	c
indespensible	i
.	c

However	c
if	i
we	c
rely	c
on	c
it	c
too	c
much	c
,	c
we	c
could	c
become	c
lazy	c
and	c
apathetic	c
and	c
as	i
a	c
result	c
,	c
would	i
not	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
live	c
without	c
them	i
once	c
they	i
are	i
gone	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
telling	c
me	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
and	c
now	c
I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
tell	i
you	c
the	c
information	c
you	c
have	c
requested	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
,	c
which	c
will	c
be	c
the	c
only	c
month	c
for	i
me	i
to	c
go	c
.	c

Because	c
my	c
course	c
wo	c
n't	c
finish	c
until	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
June	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
will	c
have	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
the	c
college	c
to	c
get	c
ready	c
for	c
the	c
new	c
term	c
.	c

Then	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
choose	c
the	c
tents	c
for	c
my	c
accommodation	c
when	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
sleeping	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
is	c
funnier	i
than	c
others	i
.	i

However	i
,	c
during	c
my	c
stay	c
at	c
Camp	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
two	c
activities	c
I	c
can	c
choose	c
,	i
one	c
of	c
them	c
I	c
will	c
choose	c
Basketball	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
the	c
sport	c
I	c
play	c
most	c
,	i
I	c
and	c
my	c
friend	c
used	c
to	c
win	c
the	c
first	c
place	i
in	c
school-wide	i
match	c
when	c
we	c
was	i
in	i
school	c
.	c

And	c
another	c
question	c
is	c
what	c
is	i
the	c
prices	c
of	c
things	c
like	c
in	i
there	c
,	c
so	i
that	c
I	c
can	c
make	c
a	c
better	c
buget	i
of	i
my	c
trip	c
.	c

Look	i
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
:	c

Thanks	c
for	c
your	c
last	c
letter	c
;	c
I	c
knew	c
you	c
would	c
interested	i
at	i
my	c
experience	c
of	c
helping	c
the	i
pop	c
concert	c
last	i
time	i
,	i
now	i
I	c
tell	i
you	c
about	c
it	c
.	c

In	c
fact	c
,	c
there	c
is	i
nothing	c
very	c
important	c
I	c
did	c
,	c
because	c
we	c
are	i
not	c
the	c
right	c
people	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
only	c
put	c
the	c
speakers	c
in	c
the	c
right	c
places	c
,	c
or	c
helping	i
engieners	i
tested	i
the	c
lights	c
.	c

The	c
fourth	c
day	c
,	c
the	c
singers	c
and	c
the	c
players	i
have	i
been	i
to	i
there	c
to	c
test	i
.	c

Then	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
chance	c
to	c
speak	c
with	c
them	c
.	c

After	c
the	c
concer	i
finished	c
successfully	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
happier	c
than	c
ever	c
because	c
the	c
succeed	i
inclueded	i
my	c
work	c
and	c
that	c
was	c
the	c
most	c
enjoyable	c
moment	c
in	c
my	c
life	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
receiving	c
your	c
letter	c
again	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
expecting	c
a	c
lovely	c
and	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
the	c
most	c
disapointed	i
experience	c
I	c
have	c
ever	c
passed	i
.	c

So	c
because	c
of	c
this	c
horrible	c
evening	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
ask	c
for	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

Modern	c
technology	c
have	i
been	c
changing	c
the	i
human	c
life	c
since	c
the	c
first	c
many	i
was	c
born	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
replying	c
in	i
response	i
of	i
the	i
competition	i
I	i
won	i
.	c

I	c
have	c
been	c
thinking	c
and	c
I	c
decided	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
tents	i
,	c
simply	c
because	c
it	c
's	c
a	c
new	c
experience	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
try	c
everything	c
new	c
.	c

Also	c
,	c
it	c
seems	c
more	c
dangerous	c
.	c

For	i
the	c
two	c
activities	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
choose	c
,	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
choose	c
a	c
new	c
activitie	i
that	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
done	c
before	c
,	c
which	c
is	c
Sailing	c
,	i
so	i
I	c
am	c
a	c
totally	i
begginer	i
at	c
this	c
.	c

I	c
also	c
needed	i
some	c
information	c
on	i
the	c
money	c
I	c
will	i
take	c
.	c

Your	i
sincerely	c
,	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

But	c
now	c
I	c
found	i
some	c
time	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
everything	c
about	c
the	c
pop	c
concert	c
I	c
helped	c
.	i

There	c
were	c
about	c
a	c
hundred	c
people	c
that	c
wanted	c
to	c
help	c
,	c
but	c
only	c
two	c
would	c
be	c
chosen	c
.	c

All	c
I	c
could	c
think	c
was	c
"	c
Oh	c
my	c
god	c
,	c
I	c
'm	c
gonna	c
be	c
talking	c
and	i
helping	c
the	c
most	c
famous	c
pop	c
bands	c
!	c
"	c

When	c
I	c
arrived	c
to	c
help	c
them	c
,	c
they	c
welcomed	c
me	c
and	c
were	c
so	c
nice	c
with	i
me	c
that	c
it	c
seemed	c
we	c
had	c
known	c
each	c
others	i
in	i
ages	c
!	c

That	c
was	c
so	c
great	c
!	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
exactly	c
how	c
I	c
felt	c
,	i
sometimes	i
I	c
wake	c
up	c
and	c
think	c
it	c
was	c
nothing	c
but	c
a	c
dream	c
.	c

Sara	c

My	c
name	c
is	c

Looking	i
for	c
your	c
repley	i

Yours	c
Faithfully	c
.	c

Her	c
mother	c
gave	c
a	i
book	c
about	i
how	i
to	i
become	i
a	i
spy	i
for	i
her	i
birthday	i
.	c

At	c
first	c
she	c
walked	c
around	c
the	c
bayside	i
market	c
looking	i
for	i
all	c
the	c
people	c
who	c
were	c
there	c
.	c

Obviously	c
the	c
man	c
realised	c
that	c
she	c
was	c
looking	c
for	c
him	c
and	c
said	c
that	c
she	c
was	c
really	c
crazy	c
!	c

Dear	c
Ms	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
pleased	c
about	c
the	c
prize	c
I	c
just	c
won	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
choosing	c
me	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
sorry	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
I	c
could	i
only	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
live	i
in	c
log	c
cabins	c
while	c
I	c
am	c
staying	c
at	c
the	c
camp	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
bad	i
experience	c
last	c
time	c
I	c
lived	i
in	c
a	c
tent	c
.	c

Surfing	c
was	c
a	c
fresh	i
sport	c
to	c
me	c
which	c
I	c
took	c
up	c
recently	c
.	c

I	c
wish	c
I	c
could	c
learn	c
more	i
so	c
that	c
I	c
could	c
enjoy	c
it	c
more	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
.	c

That	i
was	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
of	i
Steps	c
in	c
M.E.N	i
Arena	c
.	c

A	c
few	c
minutes	c
after	c
the	c
concert	c
began	c
,	c
a	c
backstage	c
assistant	c
called	c
in	c
sick	c
who	c
was	c
responsible	c
for	c
checking	c
wether	i
everything	c
is	i
going	c
well	c
according	c
to	c
the	c
timetable	c
,	i
if	i
something	c
comes	c
up	c
,	c
she	c
should	c
inform	c
other	i
staff	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
n't	c
find	c
my	c
feet	c
at	c
first	c
as	c
I	c
was	c
so	c
nervous	c
.	c

I	c
did	c
manage	c
to	c
"	c
study	c
"	c
them	c
though	c
,	c
thanks	c
to	c
other	i
staff	c
.	c

They	c
were	c
very	c
helpful	c
and	c
nice	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
lucky	c
to	c
have	c
this	c
chance	c
and	c
able	c
to	c
know	i
how	c
they	c
work	c
behind	c
the	c
scene	i
.	c

All	c
in	c
all	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
once-a-lifetime	i
experience	c

Dear	c
Sir	c

Madam	c

Regarding	i
your	c

it	c
is	c
the	i
LONDON	c
'S	c
NEWEST	c
AND	c
BEST	c
MUSICAL	c
SHOW	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
was	c
deeply	c
disappointed	c
at	i
it	c
.	c

According	c
to	c
your	c
advertisement	c
,	c
the	c
starrings	i
were	c
DANNY	c
BROOK	c
AND	c
TINA	c
TRUELOVE	c
.	c

I	c
decided	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
see	c
this	c
show	c
because	c
of	c
its	c
starrings	i
,	c
but	c
at	i
the	c
day	c
I	c
saw	c
it	c
,	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
played	i
.	c

You	c
should	c
have	c
said	c
they	i
were	c
very	c
few	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
to	c
buy	c
a	c
£	c
20	c
ticket	c
.	c

It	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c

Could	c
you	c

Modern	c
technology	c
has	c
changed	c
my	c

Especially	i
,	c
a	i
computer	c
has	c
made	i
my	i
daily	i
life	i
change	i
dramatically	c

It	c
is	c
only	c
two	c
or	c
three	c
years	c
since	c
I	c
have	i
used	i
a	c
computer	c
at	c
home	c
,	c
but	c
now	c
I	c
wonder	c
how	c
I	c
can	i
live	c
without	c
it	i
.	c

I	c
open	c
my	c
e-mail	i
box	i
every	c
night	c

When	c
I	c
find	c
a	c
new	c

I	c
'm	c
very	c
happy	c

However	c
I	i
've	c
found	c
e-mail	c
is	c
better	c
than	c
them	i
.	c

In	i
the	i
other	i
word	i
,	c
I	c
can	c
also	c
receive	c
their	c

I	c
would	c

As	c
for	c

because	c
I	c
belive	i

more	c

The	c
other	c
question	c
is	c
about	c
money	c

The	c
computer	c
class	c
can	i

it	c

THE	c
OLD	c
MAN	c
AND	c
THE	c
SEA	c
-	c
Ernest	c
Hemingway	c

As	c
I	c
see	c
it	c
,	c
the	c
Old	c
Man	c
and	c
the	c
Sea	c
is	c
a	c
really	c
exiting	i
book	c
.	c

It	c
describes	c
a	c
challenge	c
,	c
the	c
challenge	c
of	c
life	c
.	c

It	c
could	c
be	c
his	c
last	c
adventure	c
.	c

This	c
old	c
man	c
with	c
his	c
old	c
boat	c
goes	c
too	c
far	c
away	c
from	c
the	c
coast	c
to	c
try	c
to	c
fish	c
something	i
good	c
.	c

The	c
man	c
keeps	c
immediatly	i
in	c
contact	c
with	c
it	c
.	c

They	c
are	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
one	c
thing	c
linked	c
together	c
.	c

They	c
're	c
fighting	c
for	c
the	c
same	c
reason	c
with	c
the	c
same	c
strenght	i
,	c
the	c
man	c
has	c
to	c
kill	c
a	c
brother	c
,	c
as	c
he	c
calls	c
the	c
fish	c
.	c

If	c
the	c
marlin	c
could	c
speak	c
it	c
would	c
have	c
told	c
the	c
old	c
man	i
's	i
same	i
thing	c
.	c

When	c
the	c
old	c
man	c
won	c
the	c
fight	c
he	c
felt	c
sorry	c
but	c
pleased	c
.	c

He	c
respected	c
and	c
still	c
loves	i
it	c
.	c

But	c
,	c
afterwards	c
,	c
the	i
life	c
's	c
rule	c
is	c
MORS	c
TUA	c
VITA	c
MEA	c
and	c
that	c
's	c
the	c
most	c
difficulty	i
to	i
face	c
to	i
.	c

Thus	c
I	c
have	c
not	c
got	c
long	i
holiday	c
.	c

Although	c
the	i
photography	c
is	c
not	c
as	c
good	c
as	c
the	i
singing	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
interested	c
in	c
it	c
.	c

Futermore	i
,	c
I	c
am	c
going	c
to	c
have	i
competition	i
next	c
year	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
,	i
sometimes	i
have	i
a	c
long	c
quare	i
or	c
a	c
mechine	i
was	i
broken	c
.	c

I	c
have	i
unpleased	i
experience	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
in	i
lunch	i
time	i
.	c

I	c
was	c
quare	i
in	i
the	i
middle	i
of	i
row	i
.	c

I	c
choose	i
this	c
row	i
because	c
I	c
though	i
it	c
was	c
quicker	c
than	c
other	i
.	c

Although	i
there	i
were	i
finished	i
two	i
people	i
,	i
next	i
was	i
me	i
,	i
something	i
was	i
happened	i
.	c

Shopping	c
would	i
be	i
enjoyable	c
,	c
if	c
you	c
were	i
good	i
luck	i
.	c

That	c
is	c
why	c
I	i
write	i
to	c
you	c
,	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
some	c
suggestions	c
that	c
you	c
can	c
take	c
into	c
consideration	c
or	c
not	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
the	c
reasonably	i
price	c
of	c
the	c
tickets	c
for	c
the	c
weekend	c
was	c
a	c
good	c
point	c
,	c
because	c
all	c
kind	i
of	c
people	c
an	i
afford	c
to	c
buy	c
it	i
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
will	c
not	c
take	c
this	c
letter	c
as	c
a	c
complaint	c
and	c
I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
going	c
to	c
the	c
next	c
festival	c
.	c

As	i
expected	i
,	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
talk	c
at	i
first	i
about	c
my	c
school	c
and	c
then	c
about	c
my	c
home	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
know	c
,	c
I	c
finished	c
school	c
two	c
years	c
ago	c
.	c

So	c
the	c
rules	c
are	c
clear	c
,	c
you	c
need	c
to	c
participate	c
to	i
the	c
lessons	c
and	c
also	c
be	i
successful	i
at	i
the	c
exam	c
of	i
June	c
2000	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
sweet	i
home	c
,	c
my	c
parents	c
let	c
me	c
do	c
what	c
I	c
want	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
an	c
adult	c
now	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
these	c
few	c
information	i
can	c
help	c
you	c
and	c
I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
with	c
reference	c
to	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
musical	i
show	c
which	i
I	c
went	c
to	c
see	c
at	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
last	c
night	c
.	c

Being	c
a	c
theatre	c
lover	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
always	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
seeing	c
new	c
musicals	c
,	c
but	c
unfortunately	c
,	c
this	c
particular	c
one	c
was	c
very	c
disappointing	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
wait	c
for	c
forty	i
five	i
minutes	c
for	c
the	c
show	c
to	c
start	c
,	c
and	c
it	c
was	c
20:15	c
(	c
not	c
19:30	c
)	c
when	c
the	c
curtain	c
went	c
up	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
therefore	c
to	c
have	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
,	c
so	c
please	c
send	c
me	c
a	c
cheque	c
for	c
£	c
20	c
to	c
pay	i
the	c
address	c
above	c

There	c
will	c
be	c
mixture	i
of	c
styles	c
from	c

times	c
of	i

you	c

it	c

I	c

You	c
ask	c
me	c
in	c
your	c
letter	c
when	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c

The	c
answer	c
is	c
the	c
following	c
one	c
:	c
I	c
only	i
can	i
travel	c
July	i
because	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
work	c
all	c
August	c
.	c

I	c
prefer	c
the	c
tents	c
because	c
I	c
never	c
use	c
such	i
kind	c
of	c
accommodation	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
choosen	i
the	c
two	c
following	c
activities	c

I	c
have	c
even	c
done	i
competitions	c
.	c

I	c
like	c
a	i
lot	i
this	i
game	i
.	c

I	c
have	c
choosen	i
sailing	c
because	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
try	c
a	c
new	c
sport	c
.	c

I	c
love	c
water	c
but	c
I	c
never	i
try	i
this	c
sport	c
before	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
two	c
questions	c

How	c
much	c
money	c
do	c
I	c
have	c
to	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
because	c
of	c
different	c
problems	c
.	c

The	c
first	c
thing	c
is	c
the	c
place	i
of	c
shopping	i
.	c

Sometimes	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
go	c
far	c
away	c
from	c
home	c
to	c
do	c
your	c
shopping	c
and	c
it	c
takes	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
time	c
.	c

The	c
third	c
thing	c
is	c
the	c
trouble	i
of	i
full	i
shops	i
.	c

People	c
are	c
often	c
nervous	i
and	c
agressive	i
.	c

There	c
is	c
one	c
more	c
thing	c
.	c

When	c
you	c
are	c
a	c
man	c
and	c
your	c
wife	c
asks	c
you	c
to	c
come	i
for	i
shopping	c
,	c
be	c
patient	c
!	c

Because	c
women	c
loves	i
shopping	c
and	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
follow	c
them	c
everywhere	c
and	c
always	c
giving	i
your	c
opinion	c
about	c
clothes	c
,	c
music	c
,	c
parfums	i
...	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
the	c
information	c
it	i
was	c
ask	i
in	c
the	c
letter	c
you	c
had	i
sent	i
me	c
.	c

Secondly	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
sleeping	c
in	c
log	i
cabins	i
because	c
I	c
fell	i
much	c
more	c
comfortable	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
the	c
two	c
activities	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
do	c
while	c
I	c
am	c
camping	c
are	c
Singing	c
and	c
Basketball	c
.	c

The	c
last	c
one	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
tried	c
it	i
but	c
I	c
think	c
I	c
can	i
do	i
it	c
well	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
tall	c
and	c
that	c
could	c
make	c
things	c
easier	c
.	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
:	c

I	c
'm	c
very	c
sorry	c
I	c
have	c
n't	c
written	c
you	i
for	c
such	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
but	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
make	c
a	c
travel	i
to	c
my	c
parents	i
house	c
because	c
my	c
mother	c
was	i
operated	i
on	i
;	c
do	c
n't	c
worry	c
she	i
is	c
all	c
right	c
now	c
.	c

Last	c
month	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
help	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
where	c
Rolling	c
Stones	c
were	c
playing	c
.	c

The	c
most	c
exciting	c
thing	c
was	c
talking	c
with	c
the	c
band	c
,	c
asking	i
questions	i
to	i
them	i
and	c
of	c
course	c
listening	c
the	i
music	c
and	c
enjoying	c
the	c
incredible	c
show	c
.	c

Best	c
wishes	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
as	c
a	c
reply	c
for	i
your	c
letter	c
,	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
say	c
,	c
that	c
I	c
can	c
only	c
go	c
on	c
this	c
camp	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
a	c
full-time	c
job	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
essential	c
not	c
to	c
leave	c
it	c
for	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
.	c

In	c
July	c
I	c
can	c
make	c
an	c
exception	c
.	c

According	i
to	i
accomodation	i
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
log	c
cabins	c
,	c
as	c
they	c
are	c
more	c
comfortable	c
and	c
I	c
like	c
convenience	c
.	c

As	c
to	i
the	c
list	c
of	c
activities	c
I	i
choose	c
climbing	c
and	c
surfing	c
.	c

How	c
much	c
money	c
would	c
you	c
recommend	c
me	c
to	c
take	c
?	c

,,Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
"	c
.	c

From	c
my	c
point	c
of	c
view	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
very	c
controversial	c
issue	c
,	c
and	c
we	c
ca	c
n't	c
just	c
easily	c
claim	c
whether	c
it	c
is	c
enjoyable	c
or	c
not	c
.	c

Some	c
people	c
do	c
n't	c
like	c
doing	c
shopping	c
at	c
all	c
and	c
they	c
can	c
well	c
explain	c
to	c
everyone	c
why	c
it	c
is	c
n't	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
shopping	c
is	c
a	c
waste	c
of	c
time	c
.	c

I	c
just	c
ca	c
n't	c
understand	c
people	c
who	c
with	i
smile	i
on	c
their	c
faces	c
spend	i
their	c
last	c
money	c
on	c
unnecessary	c
but	c
expensive	c
things	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
as	c
a	c
conlusion	i
,	c
I	c
might	c
say	c
that	c
shopping	c
is	c
n't	c
enjoyable	c
at	c
all	c
and	c
I	c
'd	c
rather	c
stay	c
at	c
home	c
instead	c
.	c

Here	c
are	c
the	c
problems	c
of	i
your	c
show	c
.	c

The	c
price	c
of	c
ticket	i
was	c
another	c
problem	c
.	c

I	c
really	c
do	c
think	c
you	c
need	c
to	c
organise	c
your	c
show	c
a	c
bit	c
more	c
carefully	c
so	c
you	c
do	c
not	c
make	c
these	c
mistakes	c
in	c
future	c
and	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
kind	c
of	c
you	c
if	c
you	c
give	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

I	c
believe	c
that	c
modern	c
technology	c
has	c
changed	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
people	c
's	c
daily	c
life	c
.	c

Nowadays	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
too	c
easy	c
to	c
get	c
lazy	c
because	c
of	c
modern	c
technology	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
to	c
spend	c
my	c
time	c
doing	c
some	c
exercises	c
or	c
I	c
will	c
get	c
really	c
lazy	c
and	c
unfit	c
.	c

I	c
sometimes	c
think	c
that	c
it	c
might	c
not	c
be	c
a	c
good	c
idea	c
to	c
use	c
modern	c
technology	c
a	c
lot	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
modern	c
techonology	c
has	c
changed	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
a	c
lot	c
and	c
I	c
hope	c
it	c
will	c
develop	c
even	c
more	c
to	c
change	c
my	c
life	c
even	c
more	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
advertisement	c
was	i
written	c
that	c
the	c
show	c
will	i
start	c
at	c
19.30	c
but	c
it	c
started	c
45	c
minutes	c
later	c
,	c
at	c
20.15	c
!	c

So	c
you	c
can	c
see	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
a	c
so	c
perfect	c
evening	i
for	c
me	c
then	i
I	c
thought	i
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secretes	i
.	c

This	c
was	c
the	c
only	c
reason	c
why	c
that	i
she	c
had	c
not	c
a	i
lot	c
of	c
friends	c
.	c

When	c
Pat	c
came	i
new	i
into	c
a	c
class	c
or	c
a	c
groupe	i
of	c
teenagers	c
there	c
were	c
no	c
problems	c
.	c

This	c
made	c
Pat	c
sad	c
and	c
she	c
became	c
very	c
quiet	c
.	c

So	c
they	c
found	i
both	i
the	c
person	c
they	c
dreamed	c
from	i
.	c

In	c
the	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
which	c
I	c
have	i
picked	c
up	c
in	c
the	c
hall	c
of	c
the	c
theatre	c
,	c
are	i
there	i
about	c
five	c
points	c
which	c
were	c
not	c
respected	i
.	c

To	c
begin	c
with	c
,	c
as	c
far	c
as	c
the	c
starring	i
is	c
concerned	c
,	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
should	c
have	c
performed	c
the	i
main	c
character	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
saw	c
at	c
the	c
very	c
beginning	c
of	c
the	c
show	c
that	c
he	c
did	c
not	c
.	c

Insofar	c
as	c
I	c
came	c
here	c
especially	c
to	c
see	c
him	c
play	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
very	c
deceived	i
,	c
and	c
this	c
could	c
be	c
the	c
understatement	c
of	c
the	c
year	c
,	c
inasmuch	i
as	c
he	c
is	c
my	c
favorite	i
actor	c
.	c

Personnaly	i
speaking	c
,	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
saw	i
it	i
and	c
even	i
did	i
n't	i
heard	i
of	c
it	i
:	c
I	c
have	i
asked	i
about	c
it	c
,	c
but	c
nobody	c
seemed	c
to	c
know	c
anything	c
concerning	c
discounts	c
.	c

How	c
can	c
you	c
dare	c
putting	i
an	c
advertisement	c
for	c
a	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
if	c
you	c
obviously	c
know	c
that	i
is	c
closed	c
?	c

If	c
only	c
Paul	c
had	c
knew	i
it	i
before	c
...	c

Everything	i
had	i
begun	i
when	c
Paul	c
went	c
downstairs	c
of	i
the	c
Heavy	c
Sleep	c
.	c

All	c
of	c
a	c
sudden	c
,	c
a	c
weird	c
creature	c
popped	c
into	c
his	c
dream	c
.	c

The	c
boy	c
could	c
not	c
beleive	i
to	i
what	c
he	c
was	c
hearing	c
.	c

How	c
did	c
the	c
beast	c
knew	i
his	c
name	c
?	c

At	c
these	c
words	c
,	c
Paul	c
suddently	i
awoke	c
.	c

He	c
jumped	c
out	c
of	c
his	c
room	c
,	c
locked	c
the	c
door	c
and	c
found	c
his	c
brother	c
,	c
Pat	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
which	i
I	c
saw	c
in	c
your	c
theatre	c
last	c
week	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
really	c
disappointed	c
because	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
far	c
from	c
what	c
I	c
expected	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
waste	c
of	c
time	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
to	c
go	c
home	c
without	c
eating	c
a	i
dinner	c
,	c
though	c
I	c
was	c
really	c
hungry	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
the	c
evening	c
was	c
terrible	c
.	c

If	c
I	c
had	c
known	c
all	i
of	i
them	i
,	c
I	c
would	c
have	c
changed	c
my	c
plan	c
and	c
could	c
have	i
a	c
better	c
time	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
compare	c
the	c
fashion	c
now	c
with	c
that	c
of	c
100	c
years	c
ago	c
,	c
you	c
'll	c
notice	c
that	c
there	c
are	c
incredably	i
big	c
difference	i
between	c
them	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
people	c
might	c
think	c
more	c
about	c
the	c
function	c
of	c
clothes	c
than	c
the	c
design	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
they	c
'll	c
wear	c
a	i
cloth	i
which	c
protect	i
themselves	i
from	c
air	c
pollution	c
,	c
sunshine	c
etc	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
like	c
a	c
joke	c
,	c
but	c
a	c
bit	c
scarely	i
.	c

It	c
's	c
funny	c
.	c

Dear	c
Madam	c
or	c
Sir	c
,	c

During	c
my	c
recent	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
I	c
visited	c
one	c
of	c
your	c
shows	c
in	i
the	c
"	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
"	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
disappointed	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
pleased	c
that	c
the	c
main	c
actors	c
listed	c
on	c
the	c
advertisment	i
were	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
.	c

Even	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
for	c
repairs	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

friends	c
for	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
.	c

Two	c
days	c
later	c
my	c
father	c
asked	c
me	c
whether	c
I	c
had	c
thought	i
at	i
any	i
time	i
to	i
drive	i
a	c
car	c
without	c
a	c
drivers	i
license	i
because	c
he	c
had	c
heard	c
that	i
from	c
some	c
parents	c
of	c
my	c
friends	c
at	c
school	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
surprised	c
because	c
Pat	c
and	c
I	c
were	c
along	i
when	c
we	c
decided	c
to	c
do	c
that	i
.	c

Pat	c
and	c
I	c
have	i
still	i
been	i
good	c
friends	c
but	c
we	c
have	c
never	c
had	i
an	i
other	i
secret	c
together	i
.	c

I	c
have	i
been	i
very	c
disappointed	c
when	c
I	c
had	i
read	i
your	c
advertisement	c
,	i
I	c
was	c
keen	c
on	c
your	c
show	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
have	c
not	c
seen	c
the	c
same	c
show	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
seen	c
one	c
which	c
it	i
looked	i
like	i
,	c
but	c
not	i
be	i
.	i

First	c
of	c
all	c
I	i
have	i
been	i
attracted	c
by	c
the	c
actors	c
-	c
Danny	c
Brooks	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
-	c
and	c
not	c
by	c
the	c
actors	c
who	c
played	i
effectly	i
that	c
evening	c
.	c

You	c
have	c
the	c
choice	c
,	c
either	c
you	c
make	i
what	c
I	c
want	c
,	c
or	c
I	c
attack	c
you	c
in	c
justice	i
.	c

"	c
The	c
old	c
man	c
and	c
the	c
sea	c
"	c
E.H	c
.	c

This	c
will	i
is	c
so	c
amazing	c
,	c
he	c
has	c
all	c
the	c
elements	c
against	c
him	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
think	c
he	c
would	c
want	c
to	c
.	c

He	c
doe	i
n't	i
want	c
because	i
he	c
wants	c
to	c
prove	c
the	i
little	c
and	i
himself	c
that	c
he	c
is	c
not	c
really	c
old	c
,	c
even	c
if	c
he	c
has	c
a	i
big	i
age	i
.	c

To	c
conclude	c
I	c
think	c
the	c
difficults	i
situations	c
allow	c
us	c
to	c
discover	c
ourself	i
getting	i
out	i
of	i
ourself	i
.	c

As	c
regards	c
accomodation	i
,	c
I	c
would	c
rather	i
choose	c
staying	i
in	c
tents	c
.	c

Actually	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
take	c
up	c
photography	c
as	c
a	c
hobby	c
and	c
if	c
you	c
can	c
provide	c
me	c
with	c
an	c
opportunity	c
to	c
study	c
in	c
this	c
area	c
,	c
I	c
will	c
accept	c
it	c
with	c
pleasure	c
.	c

In	i
the	i
conclusion	i
I	i
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
send	c
me	c
some	c
additional	c
information	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
much	c
about	c
the	c
weather	c
down	c
there	c
,	c
in	c
California	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
am	c
rather	c
puzzeled	i
about	c
what	c
to	c
wear	c
there	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

The	c
aim	c
of	c
this	c

is	c
to	c
find	c
out	c
what	c
are	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
things	c
people	c
should	c
see	c

Around	c

:	c

Personally	c
I	c
agree	c
with	c
their	c
statement	i
and	c
think	c
that	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
interesting	c
for	c
viewers	c
to	c
learn	c
about	c
the	c
surroundings	c
of	c
the	c
school	c

We	c
should	c

around	c

a	i

with	c

at	c
the	c
back	c
of	c
the	c

Here	c
I	c
should	c
also	c
mention	c
the	c

of	c

them	c

Outdoor	c
Activities	c

And	c
the	c
last	c
but	c
not	c
least	c
thing	c
we	c
should	c
include	c
in	c
the	c
film	c
are	c
the	c
outdoor	c
activities	c
,	c
which	c
our	c
student	i
are	c
provided	c

Conclusion	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
,	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
the	i
chance	c
to	c
do	i
such	c
a	c
gorgeous	c
trip	c
.	c

We	c
truly	c
believe	i
you	c
will	c
consider	c
our	c
change	c
.	c

Please	c
contact	c
us	c
if	c
you	c
have	c
any	c
question	c
.	c

Almost	c
everyone	c
relation	i
famous	c
people	c
with	c
photographers	c
,	c
articles	c
,	c
money	c
,	c
fans	c
,	i
.	c

.	c
.	c

Nowadays	c
,	c
there	c
is	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
people	c
that	i
life	i
only	c
with	i
the	c
money	c
they	c
get	c
in	i
advertisments	i
,	c
reports	c
about	c
their	c
last	c
romance	c
,	i
.	c

.	c
.	c

but	c
not	c
everyone	c
does	c
the	c
same	c
.	i

On	c
the	c
one	c
hand	c
you	c
find	c
the	c
ones	c
that	c
are	c
well-known	i
and	c
never	c
talk	c
about	c
their	c
privacy	i
.	c

I	c
mean	c
,	c
they	c
enjoin	i
being	c
the	c
point	i
of	i
view	i
or	c
the	c
center	i
of	i
everyone	c
,	c
even	c
though	c
it	c
means	c
to	i
see	i
their	c
lifes	i
.	c

Nevertheless	c
,	c
sometimes	c
communications	i
disturb	i
their	c
lifes	i
in	c
a	c
wrong	c
way	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
safely	c
received	c
your	c
letter	c
bringing	c
the	c
good	c
news	c
.	c

I	c
wish	c
that	c
I	c
could	c
describe	c
how	c
ecstatic	c
I	c
felt	c
when	c
I	c
found	c
that	i
I	c
won	c
the	c
competition	c
.	c

This	c
is	c
because	c
it	c
falls	c
on	c
my	c
semester	i
holidays	c
and	c
that	i
it	c
is	c
also	c
summer	c
in	c
America	c
.	c

As	c
for	c
tennis	c
,	c
I	c
find	c
it	c
very	c
enjoyable	c
and	c
have	c
gone	c
for	c
proper	c
lessons	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
this	c
exciting	c
news	c
.	c

I	c
ca	c
n't	c
wait	c
to	c
go	c
on	c
this	c
adventure	c
of	c
a	c
lifetime	c
!	c

Guess	c
what	c
?	c

Last	c
month	c
,	c
I	c
got	c
to	c
help	c
out	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
.	c

The	c
concert	c
was	c
held	c
at	i
our	c
school	c
hall	c
.	c

All	c
the	c
students	c
had	c
to	c
help	c
to	c
brighten	c
up	c
the	c
place	c
,	c
and	c
boy	c
did	c
we	c
work	c
.	c

I	c
helped	c
to	c
decorate	c
the	c
walls	c
.	c

My	c
friends	c
and	c
I	c
managed	c
to	c
paint	c
a	c
smart	c
navy	c
blue	c
on	c
the	c
old	c
,	c
faded	c
green	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
hard	c
work	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
saw	c
wood	c
and	c
paint	c
all	c
day	c
long	c
.	c

I	c
also	c
helped	c
in	i
the	c
lighting	c
and	c
studio	c
equipment	c
.	c

I	c
fixed	c
the	c
lighting	c
on	c
the	c
ceiling	c
and	c
attached	c
several	c
spotlights	c
to	c
the	c
walls	c
.	c

This	c
produced	c
a	c
stunning	c
effect	c
during	c
the	c
concert	c
.	c

I	c
also	c
got	c
to	c
fix	i
new	c
speakers	c
so	c
that	c
the	c
music	c
could	c
be	c
heard	c
clearly	c
throughout	c
the	c
hall	c
.	c

I	c
really	c
enjoyed	c
myself	c
and	c
I	c
hope	c
that	c
you	c
can	c
have	c
the	c
chance	c
to	c
experience	c
this	c
too	c
.	c

Yours	i
faithfully	i
,	i

I	c
will	c
have	c
graduated	c
from	c
university	c
by	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
June	c
and	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
available	c
for	c
this	c
travel	i
only	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
I	c
will	c
have	c
to	c
start	c
working	c
with	c
my	c
parents	c
in	c
August	c
.	c

According	i
to	i
your	c
activities	c
at	c
the	c
Camp	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
choose	c
singing	c
and	c
painting	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
a	i
lead	c
singer	c
in	c
the	c
university	c
band	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
good	c
at	c
this	c
activity	c
.	c

Also	c
painting	c
is	c
my	c
hobby	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
always	c
been	i
painting	i
when	c
I	c
have	c
a	i
spare	c
time	c
.	c

Once	c
again	c
,	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
giving	c
me	c
a	c
good	c
opportunity	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
going	c
with	i
your	c
camp	c
in	c
the	c
near	c
future	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

To	c
make	c
matters	c
worse	c
,	c
you	c
forget	i
to	c
buy	c
something	c
when	c
you	c
get	c
back	c
home	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
very	c
frustrating	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
if	c
you	c
go	c
with	c
your	c
children	c
,	c
you	c
will	c
have	c
to	c
control	c
them	c
and	c
remember	c
things	c
on	c
your	c
list	c
at	c
the	c
same	c
time	c
and	c
sometimes	c
they	c
cry	c
when	c
they	c
want	c
something	c
in	c
the	c
supermarket	c
.	c

Sometimes	c
when	i
you	c
meet	i
a	c
nice	c
dress	c
and	c
you	c
think	c
you	c
are	c
going	c
to	c
buy	c
it	c
tomorrow	c
but	c
when	c
you	c
come	c
back	c
it	c
is	c
sold	c
out	i
or	c
there	c
is	i
no	i
your	i
size	i
left	i
.	c

The	c
other	c
disadvantage	c
is	c
that	c
you	c
enjoy	c
going	c
shopping	c
too	c
much	c
and	c
pay	c
everything	i
buy	i
credit	i
card	c
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
I	c
believe	c
that	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
if	c
you	c
accidently	i
meet	i
a	c
bad	c
situation	c
or	c
you	c
can	i
not	i
control	c
your	c
expenditure	c
carefully	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
from	c
Paris	c
where	c
I	c
live	c
.	c

We	c
were	c
really	c
pleased	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
our	c
first	c
time	c
in	c
England	c
.	c

We	c
asked	c
our	c
travel	c
agent	c
to	c
organise	c
our	c
trip	c
.	c

Of	c
course	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
did	c
n't	c
start	c
on	c
time	c
.	c

No	c
reasons	c
or	c
excuses	c
were	c
given	c
.	c

But	c
,	c
instead	c
of	c
him	c
,	c
we	c
saw	c
an	c
unknown	c
actor	c
(	c
who	c
really	c
need	i
singing	c
lessons	c
)	c
.	c

But	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

And	c
now	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
wondering	c
if	c
I	c
had	c
not	c
made	c
a	c
mistake	c
.	c

Two	c
days	c
before	c
,	c
I	c
told	c
him	c
that	c
our	c
father	c
was	c
about	c
to	c
buy	c
a	c
brand	c
new	c
car	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
be	c
a	c
gift	c
for	c
twenty	c
years	c
of	c
marriage	c
.	c

A	c
car	c
only	c
for	c
her	c
.	c

The	c
first	c
thing	c
Pat	c
did	c
was	c
to	c
tell	c
our	c
young	c
sister	c
the	c
secret	c
.	c

Apparently	i
she	c
was	c
not	c
surprised	c
,	c
but	c
she	c
was	c
surely	i
angry	c
.	c

Really	c
angry	c
!	c
!	c

According	c
to	c
her	c
,	c
this	c
car	c
would	c
have	c
been	c
useless	c
.	c

Then	c
,	c
we	c
decided	c
to	c
offer	i
her	c
a	c
red	c
bicycle	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
the	c
colour	c
my	c
father	c
had	c
chosen	c
for	c
the	c
car	c
!	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
that	i
I	c
received	c
yesterday	c
.	c

Also	c
I	c
am	c
pleased	c
,	i
that	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
to	c
pay	c
any	c
expenses	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
end	i
of	c
July	c
.	c

In	c
June	c
I	c
have	c
other	c
arrangements	c
,	c
such	c
as	c
my	c
school	c
exams	c
and	c
my	c
birthday	c
.	c

In	c
your	c
letter	c
you	c
are	i
asking	i
me	c
to	c
chose	i
which	c
accomodation	i
I	c
prefer	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
very	c
much	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
tents	i
.	c

Last	c
year	c
I	c
stay	i
in	c
tents	i
with	c
some	c
friends	c
in	c
England	c
and	c
I	c
really	c
enjoyed	c
it	c
.	c

Summer	i
time	i
the	c
weather	c
is	c
good	c
and	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
see	c
any	i
problem	c
anywhere	i
I	c
will	i
stay	i
.	c

During	c
my	c
time	c
in	c
California	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
love	c
to	c
have	c
the	c
chance	c
of	i
some	c
leisure	c
activities	c
such	c
as	c
swimming	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
my	c
favourite	c
sport	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
good	c
and	i
fast	i
at	i
swimming	i
.	c

Another	c
sport	c
I	c
love	c
is	c
basket	i
ball	i
.	c

My	c
final	c
question	c
is	c
this	c
.	c

Can	c
you	c
let	c
me	c
know	c
if	c
there	c
is	i
any	c
facilities	c
for	c
washing	c
my	c
clothes	c
If	i
not	c
I	c
will	c
bring	c
with	c
me	c
enough	c
to	c
last	c
for	c
two	c
weeks	c
.	c

Please	c
give	c
me	c
a	c
rough	c
idea	c
how	c
much	c
spending	c
money	c
I	c
will	c
need	c
.	c

Yours	c
Sincerely	c

Shoping	i
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c

Sometimes	c
I	c
go	c
two	i
days	i
We	i
all	c
have	c
to	c
do	c
our	c
shopping	c

It	c
is	c
unavoidable	c
Sometimes	i
it	c
is	c
pleasant	c
,	c
and	c
sometimes	c
it	c
's	c
not	c

Shopping	c
is	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
return	c
to	c
my	c
University	c
in	c
the	c
middle	c
of	c
August	c
.	c

Your	i
another	i
consideration	c
was	c
accommodation	c
.	c

Please	c
could	c
you	c
also	c
let	c
me	c
know	c
if	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
take	c
special	c
clothes	c
with	c
me	c
?	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
the	c
camp	c
in	c

The	c
main	c
characters	c
of	c
this	c
book	c
are	c
Stephen	c
Biko	c
,	c
a	c
black	c
leader	c
,	c
and	c
Donald	c
Woods	c
who	c
is	c
a	c
white	c
newspaper	c
editor	c
.	c

In	c
some	c
ways	c
,	c
he	c
did	c
not	c
agree	c
with	c
"	c
Black	c
Consciousness	c
"	c
which	c
is	c
Biko	c
's	c
organization	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
too	c
much	c
against	c
the	c
whites	c
.	c

Although	c
Biko	c
was	c
killed	c
and	c
Woods	c
himself	c
was	c
declared	c
a	c
banned	c
person	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
dare	c
to	c
say	c
their	c
sacrifices	c
were	c
worthwhile	c
because	c
Woods	c
succeeded	c
in	c
escaping	c
from	c
South	c
Africa	c
which	c
would	c
enable	c
him	c
to	c
publish	c
his	c
book	c
revealing	c
the	c
truth	c
about	c
South	c
Africa	c
to	c
the	c
world	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
,	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
summer	c
season	i
,	c
and	c
it	i
is	i
nice	c
weather	c
to	c
enjoy	c
in	c
California	c
.	c

In	i
regard	i
to	i
the	c
activities	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	i
tennis	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
some	c
experience	c
playing	c
,	c
and	c
my	c
spin	c
and	c
volley	c
are	c
very	c
good	c
,	c
and	c
painting	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
some	i
techniques	c
,	i
that	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
put	i
on	i
practise	i
.	c

Lastly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
if	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
bring	c
any	c
special	c
clothes	c
,	c
and	c
where	c
can	i
I	i
change	c
my	c
money	c
to	c
American	c
dollars	c
cheaper	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
ask	i
for	c
your	c
prompt	c
reply	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
can	c
start	c
organizing	c
myself	c
.	c

Thanking	c
you	c

Yours	c

What	c
I	c
personally	c
liked	c
the	c
most	c
was	c
all	c
our	c
teamwork	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writting	i
this	c
letter	c
because	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
week	c
in	c
London	c
last	c
month	c
and	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
see	c
your	c
show	c
called	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
"	c
with	c
my	c
wife	c
and	c
children	c
.	c

We	c
were	c
disappointed	c
because	c
your	c
advertisement	c
was	c
a	c
misleading	c
one	c
.	c

However	c
the	i
man	c
who	c
took	c
his	c
place	c
made	i
a	c
good	c
performance	c
,	c
we	c
enjoy	i
listening	c
to	c
him	c
because	c
his	c
voice	c
was	c
amazing	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
you	c
did	c
not	c
apologise	c
as	i
if	c
it	c
was	c
usual	c
!	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
the	c
tickets	c
were	c
a	c
little	c
bit	c
expensive	c
and	c
not	c
many	c
people	c
could	c
afford	c
the	c
price	c
.	c

We	c
did	c
not	c
see	c
any	c
discounts	c
!	c

I	c
understand	c
them	c
.	c

After	c
such	c
a	c
bad	c
show	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
want	c
to	c
eat	c
in	c
the	c
same	c
place	c
.	c

For	c
these	c
reasons	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
have	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
a	c
"	c
perfect	c
evening	c
"	c
as	c
you	c
said	c
.	c

Yours	c
Faithfully	c

The	c
ways	c
of	i
transport	i
are	c
improving	c
a	c
lot	c
this	i
times	i

But	c
it	c
is	c
also	c
the	i
technology	c
which	c
try	i
to	c
resolve	c
this	c
problem	c
with	c
new	c
way	i
of	c

so	c
as	c
to	c

Dear	c
Mr.	c
Smith	c
,	c

I	c
read	c
on	i
your	c
advertisment	i
in	c
Friday	c
's	c
edition	c
of	c
the	c
Times	c
that	c
the	c
show	c
should	c
start	c
at	c
19.30	c
but	c
the	c
representation	i
started	c
at	c
20.15	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
waitting	i
45	c
minutes	c
for	c
anything	i
!	c

Your	i
sincerely	c

The	c
day	c
after	c
I	c
get	c
everything	c
at	c
home	c
by	c
post	c
.	c

You	c
have	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
things	c
to	c
do	c
,	c
to	c
see	c
,	c
to	c
learn	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
too	c
big	c
to	c
tell	c
everybody	c
about	c
what	c
you	c
can	c
do	c
!	c

I	c
hope	c
I	c
will	c
help	c
them	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
sure	c
I	c
will	c
!	c

You	c
see	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
the	c
"	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
"	c
,	c
as	c
you	c
had	c
promised	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
.	c

And	c
the	i
girlfriend	i
of	i
Nick	i
happened	c
to	c
be	c
in	c
Pat	c
's	c
class	c
.	c

She	c
was	c
quite	c
clever	c
and	c
had	c
known	c
everything	c
about	c
this	c
,	c
so	c
she	c
had	c
taken	i
copies	c
for	c
her	c
classmates	c
and	c
everybody	c
was	c
prepared	c
.	c

.	c
.	c

When	c
musical	i
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
(	c
not	c
at	c
19:30	c
as	c
showed	i
)	c
I	c
was	c
realy	i
shokked	i
when	c
I	c
realised	c
that	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
was	c
playing	c
.	i

Otherwise	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
contact	c
my	c
lower	i
.	c

Therefore	c
it	c
make	i
sense	c
to	c
use	c
the	c
inovation	i
which	c
are	c
standing	i
for	i
environmental	c
destructions	i

Dear	c
Helen	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
answer	c
your	c
letter	c
,	c
which	c
I	c
have	i
recieved	i
yesterday	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
accepting	c
me	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
appreciate	i
that	c
all	c
costs	i
are	c
paid	c
for	i
.	c

I	c
could	i
travel	c
only	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
my	c
exam	i
will	c
be	c
finished	c
in	i
the	c
beginning	c
of	c
that	c
month	c
and	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
great	c
if	c
I	c
could	c
set	c
off	c
my	i
journey	c
on	c
15th	c
July	c
.	c

Therefore	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
chosen	c
golf	c
and	c
tennis	c
from	c
the	c
list	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
been	c
playing	c
them	c
for	c
more	c
than	c
3	c
years	c
in	i
which	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
trained	c
,	c
3	c
years	c
for	c
tennis	c
,	c
1	c
year	c
for	c
golf	c
by	i
the	i
professional	c
coaches	c
.	c

I	i
'm	i
enjoy	c
playing	c
both	c
of	c
them	c
regularly	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
,	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
nice	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
send	c
me	c
an	i
address	c
which	i
I	c
am	c
going	c
to	c
stay	c
,	c
so	c
that	c
I	c
can	c
keep	c
in	c
touch	c
with	c
my	c
friends	c
and	c
family	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
thank	c
you	c
again	c
for	c
everything	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
accompanying	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

Yours	c
Sincerely	c

"	c
Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
"	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
this	c
statement	c
is	c
true	c
.	c

I	i
'm	i
not	c
dare	c
to	c
culculate	i
how	c
much	c
I	c
have	c
spent	c
for	i
those	c
things	c
without	c
thinking	c
.	c

Therefore	c
,	c
people	c
who	c
is	i
over	c
18	c
can	c
think	c
of	c
more	c
reasons	c
than	c
young	c
children	c
for	i
shopping	c
and	c
buying	c
such	c
tempting	c
objects	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Clark	c
,	c

I	c
hope	c
so	c
!	c

May	c
I	c
suggest	c
you	c
to	i
think	i
about	c
doing	c
the	c
festival	c
over	c
one	i
week	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

Dear	c
Magda	c
,	c

As	c
you	c
asked	c
me	c
in	c
it	c
,	c
here	c
are	c
some	c
school	i
and	c
home	c
rules	c
in	c
my	c
country	c
,	c
France	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
's	c
a	i
big	i
difference	i
with	i
England	c
,	c
children	c
do	c
n't	c
wear	c
uniforms	c
at	c
school	c
.	c

Of	c
course	c
when	c
you	c
're	c
in	c
class	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
behave	c
yourself	c
,	i
be	c
polite	c
with	c
the	c
teacher	c
and	c
the	c
other	c
school	i
children	i
.	c

As	i
I	i
am	i
concerned	i
,	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
child	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
not	c
allowed	c
to	c
stay	c
very	i
late	c
with	c
my	c
parents	c
and	c
sometimes	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
because	c
I	c
was	c
not	c
tired	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
wise	i
child	c
,	i
so	i
!	c

There	c
are	c
some	c
rules	c
like	i
"	c
do	c
n't	c
speak	c
with	c
a	c
full	c
mouth	c
"	c
;	c
"	c
do	c
n't	c
put	c
your	c
finger	c
in	c
your	c
noise	i
"	c
;	c
"	c
say	c
please	c
and	c
thank	c
you	c
"	c
;	c
"	c
do	c
n't	c
fight	c
with	c
your	c
brother	c
"	c
;	c
and	c
so	c
on	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
's	c
the	c
same	c
everywhere	c
.	c

Another	c
thing	c
is	c
that	c
I	c
took	c
a	c
particular	c
amount	c
of	c
money	c
to	c
buy	c
a	i
tickets	c
and	c
when	c
I	c
apeared	i
infrant	i
of	c
casses	i
I	c
found	c
out	c
that	c
the	c
cost	c
of	c
tickets	i
on	i
your	c
advertisement	c
and	c
real	i
price	c
was	i
n't	i
the	c
same	c
,	c
real	i
price	c
was	c
much	c
higher	c
.	c

Also	c
show	i
started	c
very	c
late	c
compere	i
to	c
what	c
was	c
writen	i
on	i
the	c
advertisement	c
.	c

And	c
I	c
think	c
you	c
know	c
how	c
it	c
is	c
just	c
sit	i
and	c
wait	i
for	c
45min	i
.	i

So	c
,	c
after	c
all	c
of	c
that	c
,	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
nice	c
relaxing	c
diner	i
in	c
your	c
restaurant	c
,	i
I	c
was	c
very	c
angry	c
when	c
I	c
apeared	i
infrant	i
of	c
closed	c
doors	c
and	c
there	c
was	c
a	c
notice	c
,	i
that	c
the	c
restaurant	c
was	c
n't	c
working	i
.	c

In	c
fact	c
writing	i
to	c
you	c
just	i
with	i
one	c
main	c
reason	i
.	c

I	c
'll	c
be	c
really	c
delightful	i
to	c
resive	i
back	i
the	i
money	i
for	c
my	c
ticket	c
.	c

Begin	c
at	c
the	c
begining	i
.	c

Today	c
we	c
ca	c
n't	c
even	c
think	c
how	c
we	c
could	c
possibly	c
leave	i
without	c
computers	c
or	c
without	c
airplanes	i
.	c

Computer	i
it	i
is	c
our	c
way	c
of	c
with	i
outside	i
world	i
comunicat	i
,	c
wheres	i
with	c
airplanes	i
we	c
can	c
rich	i
our	c
parents	c
,	i
friends	c
easily	c
and	c
much	c
faster	c
,	i
then	i
if	i
we	i
would	i
use	i
bouts	i
or	c
trains	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
in	c
reply	c
to	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
excited	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
won	c
a	c
prize	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
will	i
like	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
that	c
I	c
can	c
only	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
in	c
June	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
my	c
final	c
exams	c
at	c
school	c
.	c

In	c
August	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
be	c
in	c
Madrid	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
going	c
to	c
work	c
as	c
a	c
trainee	c
in	c
a	c
travel	c
agency	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
because	c
I	c
like	c
very	i
much	i
the	i
nature	i
and	i
camping	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
better	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
than	c
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
.	c

Although	c
all	c
the	c
activities	c
that	c
you	c
mention	c
are	c
very	c
interesting	c
,	c
I	c
prefer	c
swimming	c
and	c
tennis	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
good	c
in	i
swimming	c
.	c

I	c
won	c
a	c
local	c
competition	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
seventeen	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
how	c
the	c
weather	c
will	c
be	c
in	c
July	c
and	c
which	i
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
wear	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
the	i
money	i
that	i
I	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
and	c
which	i
amount	c
of	c
money	c
is	c
normally	c
spent	c
in	c
the	c
camp	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
foward	i
to	c
receiving	c
your	c
reply	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
the	c
statement	c
'	c
Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
'	c
is	c
totally	c
true	c
.	c

You	c
can	c
be	c
walking	c
for	c
hours	c
and	c
finally	c
you	c
ca	c
n't	c
find	c
anything	c
that	c
you	c
like	c
.	c

Despite	c
shopping	c
is	i
boring	c
I	i
think	c
that	c
it	c
is	c
necessary	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
important	c
for	c
people	c
to	c
have	c
several	c
clothes	i
and	c
also	c
suitable	c
clothes	c
for	c
a	c
very	c
important	c
meeting	c
or	c
appointment	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
enjoyable	c
,	c
but	c
necessary	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
very	c
various	i
and	c
interesting	c
.	c

This	c
presentation	c
will	c
show	c
the	c
latest	c
fashions	c
and	c
the	i
leisure	c
and	c
sports	c
wear	c
.	c

For	c
pratical	i
informations	i
,	c
this	c
show	c
start	i
at	c
10.00	c
and	c
close	i
at	c
19.00	c
.	c

About	c
the	c
programme	c
,	c
we	c
suggest	c
to	i
see	i
the	c
show	c
on	c
the	c
Tuesday	c
morning	c
and	c
after	i
to	i
do	i
shopping	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
wo	c
n't	c
be	c
too	c
angry	c
for	i
this	c
changing	i
but	c
we	c
would	c
all	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
show	c

Waiting	c
for	c
your	c
answer	c
,	c
receive	i
our	i
greetings	i
.	i

For	i
the	c
class	c

General	i
speaking	c
,	c
homes	c
will	c
change	c
considerably	c
.	c

They	c
will	c
become	c
less	c
dark	c
and	c
more	c
confortable	i
than	c
today	c
.	c

This	i
improvments	i
will	c
be	c
involved	i
by	c
the	c
lack	c
of	c
petrol	c
and	c
unrecycling	i
energies	i
.	c

About	c
the	c
size	c
of	c
hous	i
,	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
in	c
cities	c
houses	c
will	c
be	c
more	c
and	c
more	c
little	i
because	c
of	c
the	i
over	i
population	i
.	c

In	i
opposite	i
,	c
in	c
the	c
suburb	i
or	c
in	c
the	c
land	i
,	c
more	c
and	c
more	c
rich	c
people	c
will	c
build	c
big	c
houses	c
.	c

New	c
technologies	c
and	c
facilities	c
wo	c
n't	c
improve	c
the	c
relationship	c
between	c
people	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
people	c
will	c
be	c
as	c
alone	c
and	c
julous	i
as	c
today	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
really	c
disappointed	c
when	c
I	c
realised	c
that	c
the	c
actor	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
was	c
not	c
performing	c
due	i
to	i
personal	c
reasons	c
,	i
I	c
like	c
this	c
actor	c
very	c
much	c
and	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
the	c
same	c
without	c
him	c
.	c

To	c
make	c
matters	c
worse	c
,	c
there	c
were	c
not	i
ticket	i
discounts	i
as	i
you	c
advertised	c
.	c

Because	c
of	c
this	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
buy	c
the	i
cheapest	c
and	c
worst	c
seat	c
available	c
.	c

How	c
has	c
modern	c
technology	c
changed	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
?	c

The	c
years	c
went	c
by	c
and	c
after	c
buying	c
a	c
newer	c
,	c
faster	c
and	c
better	c
PC	c
I	c
found	c
myself	c
writing	c
letters	c
,	c
doing	c
School	i
homework	c
and	c
evening	i
learning	c
with	c
my	c
Computer	c
.	c

Nowadays	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
fact	c
that	c
my	c
life	c
would	c
n't	c
be	c
the	c
same	c
without	c
my	c
PC	c
.	c

After	c
reading	c
the	c
hole	i
organized	i
programme	c
,	c
we	c
all	c
agreed	c
about	c
the	c
sightseeing	c
by	i
bus	c
around	c
London	c
wich	i
will	c
give	c
us	c
the	c
knowledge	c
about	i
this	c
fantastic	c
city	c
we	c
all	i
want	i
to	c
meet	i
since	c
time	i
ago	c
.	c

Latest	c
Fashions	c

Make	i
up	i
.	c

After	c
being	i
discussing	c
,	i
we	c
want	c
to	c
suggest	c
how	c
we	c
think	c
the	c
programme	c
should	c
be	c
re-arranged	c
.	c

Agatha	c

A	c
good	c
book	c
should	c
interest	c
,	c
amuse	c
or	c
teach	c
the	c
reader	c
something	c
.	c

Agatha	c
Christie	c
always	i
was	i
my	c
favourite	c
writer	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
a	c
detective	c
story	c
,	c
like	c
all	c
the	c
stories	c
written	c
by	c
her	c
.	c

In	i
our	i
words	i
the	c
story	c
is	c
settled	i
on	c
a	c
train	c
wich	i
tooks	i
a	i
trip	i
along	i
the	c
orient	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
train	c
,	c
all	c
the	c
passangers	i
seem	c
to	c
be	c
involved	c
in	c
a	c
crime	c
.	c

I	c
read	c
it	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
really	c
enjoyed	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
like	c
very	i
much	i
Danny	i
Brook	i
,	c
and	c
his	c
unaspected	i
absence	c
caused	c
on	i
me	c
a	i
big	i
sadness	c
.	c

Then	c
,	c
musical	i
show	c
had	c
to	c
start	c
at	c
19,30..why	c
at	i
20:15	i
there	i
was	i
also	i
the	i
light	i
on	i
?	c

You	c
'll	c
be	i
agree	c
with	c
me	c
that	c
45	c
minutes	c
to	i
waiting	i
for	c
the	c
starting	i
of	c
the	c
show	c
is	c
a	i
too	i
long	i
time	c
.	c

The	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
show	c
indicated	c
discounts	c
available	c
and	c
open	i
restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
in	i
this	i
way	i

The	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
'	i
cause	i
of	c
illness.	c
.	c

of	i
who	i
?	c

For	c
those	c
reasons	c
I	c
ask	c
you	c
for	c
some	c
money	c
back	c
,	c
sure	c
of	c
my	c
good	c
reasons	c

It	c
's	c
for	c
this	c
reason	c
that	c
now	i
I	i
'm	i
in	c
this	c
terrible	c
situation	c
.	c

I	c
was	i
agree	i
to	c
buy	c
another	c
one	c

of	c
the	c
same	c

but	c
now	c
he	c
's	c
angry	c
with	c
me	c
,	c
'	i
cause	i
I	c
did	c
n't	c

He	c
's	c
my	c

so	c
he	c
wanted	c
from	i
me	i
all	i
the	i

your	c
competition	c
and	c
want	c
to	c

for	c
that	c
very	c
interesting	c
competition	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
only	c
available	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
studying	c
in	i
an	c
engineering	c
school	c
and	c
I	c
'll	c
work	c
until	c

Now	c
let	c
's	c
speak	c
about	c

In	c

I	c

tennis	c
and	c
I	c
am	c

good	c
at	c

and	c
it	c
will	c
the	i
occasion	i
to	c
train	c
myself	i
surfing	c
is	c
completely	c
unknown	i
for	i
me	c
and	c
I	c
hope	c
that	c
I	c
will	c
like	c
it	c
.	c

But	c
if	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
try	c
it	c
I	c
will	c
never	c
know	c
if	c
I	c
like	c
it	c
or	c
not	c
!	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
wanted	i
to	c
know	c
if	c
I	c
need	c
money	i
and	c
how	c
many	i
,	c
and	c
if	c
there	c
is	c

You	c
think	c
that	c

You	c
do	c
n't	c
like	c
shopping	c
but	c
you	c
must	c
go	c
shopping	c
to	c
eat	c
!	c

But	c
sometimes	c
you	c
go	c
shopping	c
for	c
pleasure	c
and	c
you	c
have	c
all	i
your	i
time	i
(	c
the	i
girls	i
know	i
what	i
it	i
is	i
)	c
.	c

To	c
conclude	c
,	c
if	c

asking	c
for	c
my	c
preferences	c
about	c

Camp	c

Once	c
there	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
staying	c
in	c
tents	i

because	c
that	c
is	c
a	c
way	c
to	c
remember	c
my	c
childhood	c
as	c
a	c
boyscout	i
and	c
go	i
against	i
the	c
routine	c

From	c

list	c
of	c
activities	c
you	c
sent	c

it	c

my	c
reward	c
when	c
the	c

After	c

the	c
basic	c
fact	c
that	c
I	i
must	c
go	c
shopping	c
for	c
food	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
have	c
enough	c
money	c
the	c
price	c
is	c
n't	c
important	c
,	c
then	c
I	c
can	c
buy	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
goods	i
whitout	i
take	i
care	i
on	i
my	c
money	c
.	c

Also	c
I	c
will	c
buy	c
goods	i
which	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
need	c
.	c

This	i
is	c
the	i
fact	c
that	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
enjoyable	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
,	c

I	c
recently	c
had	c
a	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
and	c
had	i
been	i
to	c
your	c
musical	c
show	c
'	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
'	c
but	c
found	c
it	c
very	c
disappointing	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
there	c
was	c
a	c
different	c
unknown	i
actor	c
in	c
that	c
.	c

The	c
show	c
started	c
later	i
at	i
20:15	c
which	i
was	c
very	c
different	c
in	i
'	c
19.30	c
'	c
as	i
shown	i
.	c

There	c
was	c
no	c
discount	c
at	c
all	c
which	i
is	i
in	c
contrast	c
with	c
'	c
Discounts	c
Availabe	i
'	c
.	c

The	c
real	c
show	c
on	i
it	i
owns	i
is	c
really	c
very	c
different	c
to	c
what	c
are	i
mentioned	i
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
unsatisfied	c
and	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
for	c
some	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

Please	c
would	c
you	c
also	c
change	c
the	c
advertisement	c
to	i
the	i
level	i
of	i
the	c
actual	c
facts	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
attention	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

What	c
will	c
clothes	c
be	c
like	c
100	c
years	c
from	c
now	c
?	c

It	c
is	c
a	c
very	c
hard	c
thing	c
to	c
predict	c
.	c

The	c
fashion	c
of	i
nowaday	i
clothings	i
is	i
just	c
keep	i
on	c
changing	c
.	c

For	i
the	c
fashion	c
of	c
the	c
future	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
depends	c
on	c
the	i
people	c
's	c
own	i
personalities	c
and	c
develope	i
their	c
own	c
styles	c
which	c
suits	i
them	c
the	c
most	c
.	c

For	i
the	c
colours	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
the	i
metalic	i
colours	c
,	c
especially	c
silver	c
,	c
will	c
be	c
the	c
most	c
popular	c
.	c

As	c
different	c
kinds	c
of	c
farbics	i
will	i
be	i
invented	i
&	i
the	i
clothings	i
will	i
never	i
be	i
just	i
cotton	i
as	i
always	i
been	i
seen	i
.	c

Maybe	c
paper	c
can	c
also	c
be	i
a	i
farbic	i
use	i
for	i
make	i
clothings	c
and	c
for	c
those	c
who	c
like	c
to	c
wear	c
new	c
clothes	i
everyday	i
.	c

They	c
can	c
be	c
thrown	c
away	c
after	c
wearing	i
it	c
and	i
light	c
enough	c
to	c
be	c
carried	c
around	c
whenever	c
you	c
want	c
to	c
change	i
your	c
wearing	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
fan	c
of	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
but	c
he	c
was	c
absent	c
because	c
of	i
sick	c
.	c

It	c
made	i
me	i
disappointed	i
very	c
much	c
.	c

The	c
show	c
supposed	i
to	c
start	c
at	c
19:30	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
.	c

Because	c
of	c
that	c
,	c
we	c
missed	c
the	c
train	c
and	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
stay	c
one	c
more	c
night	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

We	c
would	c
like	c
you	c
to	c
pay	i
back	i
the	c
fee	i
of	c
the	c
show	i
and	c
pay	c
us	c
that	i
hotel	i
's	i
fee	i
as	c
well	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

Fashion	c
of	c
the	c
Future	c

From	i
my	i
point	i
of	i
view	i
,	c
young	c
people	c
tend	c
to	c
wear	c
the	i
clothes	c
which	c
they	i
can	c
show	c
their	c
skin	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
short	c
skirts	c
and	c
tops	c
like	c
an	i
under-wear	i
.	c

I	c
think	c
young	c
people	c
would	i
wear	i
smaller	i
clothes	i
which	c
they	i
look	c
like	c
almost	i
naked	c
even	c
in	c
winter	c
.	c

I	c
suppose	c
that	c
a	c
scientist	c
could	c
invent	c
new	c
kinds	c
of	c
materials	c
which	c
are	c
warm	c
and	c
thick	c
.	c

It	c
could	c
be	c
happened	i
that	c
people	c
wear	i
the	c
clothes	c
which	c
ancient	c
people	c
used	c
to	c
wear	c
,	c
like	c
skirts	c
made	c
of	c
leaves	c
.	c

Next	c
,	c
I	c
predict	c
about	i
patterns	i
of	i
clothes	i
.	c

It	c
might	c
be	c
possible	c
that	c
the	c
fish-pattern	i
come	i
up	i
in	c
100	c
years	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
fashion	c
changes	c
too	c
fast	c
to	c
predict	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
fashion	c
changes	c
very	c
quickly	c
so	c
that	c
people	c
are	c
interested	c
in	c
those	c
changes	c
.	c

All	c
our	i
class	i
and	i
me	i
would	c
like	c
to	c
see	c
this	c
show	c
.	c

You	c
know	c
what	c
else	c
?	c

It	c
's	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
because	c
in	c
our	c
fast	i
developing	i
world	c
we	c
have	c
to	c
look	c
fashionable	c
and	c
this	c
kind	c
of	c
show	c
happens	c
quite	c
rare	i
.	c

I	c
'm	c
going	c
to	c
write	c
about	c
"	c
The	c
Home	c
of	c
the	c
Future	c
"	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
the	i
houses	c
will	c
grow	c
up	i
on	i
twenty	c
floors	c
up	c
to	c
the	c
sky	c
as	c
more	c
and	c
more	c
people	c
will	c
occupy	c
it	i
.	c

I	c
think	c
more	c
and	c
more	c
people	c
will	c
have	c
at	c
least	c
one	c
flat	c
,	i
does	i
n't	i
matter	c
if	c
you	c
are	c
rich	c
or	c
not	c
.	c

The	c
rooms	c
will	c
be	c
much	c
bigger	c
and	c
wider	c
than	c
now	c
,	c
and	c
you	c
can	i
have	c
up	c
to	c
twenty	c
rooms	c
in	c
your	c
own	c
flat	c
,	c
and	c
even	c
swiching	i
on	c
the	c
light	c
by	c
saying	c
only	i
;	i
"	c
light	i
"	c
.	c

The	i
same	i
problem	i
will	i
be	i
with	i
homeless	i
people	i
who	i
does	i
n't	i
have	i
money	i
at	i
all	i
,	i
even	i
to	i
buy	i
a	i
food	i
for	i
themselves	i

The	c
Manager	c
of	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

There	i
problems	c
were	c
;	i
Firstly	i
,	c
the	c
famous	c
actors	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
were	c
n't	c
there	c
for	i
your	c
musical	i
show	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
unhappy	c
to	c
constat	i
that	c
it	i
was	i
different	c
actors	c
this	i
evening	c
.	c

Fourthly	i
,	c
the	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
for	c
renovations	i
and	c
you	c
do	i
n't	i
have	c
to	i
propose	i
us	i
to	i
go	i
.	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

For	c
instance	c
,	c
internet	i
.	c

All	i
the	i
world	c
is	c
now	c
connected	c
on	i
it	c
.	c

It	i
is	i
now	i
ten	i
years	i
that	i
Internet	i
exists	i
,	c
but	c
we	c
only	c
used	i
it	c
for	c
army	c
and	c
government	c
.	i

Now	c
,	c
everybody	c
who	c
work	i
in	c
commercial	i
companies	i
use	i
every	i
day	i
Internet	i
.	c

The	i
technology	i
means	i
too	i
,	i
every	i
electrical	c
machines	c
,	c
which	c
do	c
n't	c
stop	c
to	i
be	i
developped	i
.	c

The	i
modern	i
technology	c
has	c
changed	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
in	i
every	c
day	c
.	c

For	c
instance	c
,	c
the	i
meats	i
,	i
we	c
do	c
n't	c
cook	c
our	c
meals	c
,	c
everything	c
is	c
already	c
done	c
.	c

Five	c
minutes	c
in	c
the	c
micro-waves	i
and	c
it	c
's	c
ready	c
.	c

The	i
machines	i
have	c
replaced	c
the	c
work	c
of	c
the	i
humains	i
.	c

All	i
our	i
life	c
is	c
symplifying	i
by	c
the	i
machines	c
for	i
not	i
waste	i
the	i
time	i
to	i
work	i
on	i
their	i
developpment	i
.	c

Dear	c
Ms	c
Clark	c
,	c

I	c
have	i
spent	i
two	c
days	c
at	c
the	c
"	c
International	c
Arts	c
Festival	c
"	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
good	c
event	c
but	c
I	c
think	c
some	c
details	i
could	c
be	c
better	c
the	c
next	c
time	c
.	c

That	c
was	c
disappointing	c
!	c

I	c
think	c
there	c
are	c
some	c
possibilities	i
for	c
earning	c
money	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
say	c
the	c
simplest	c
way	c
is	c
to	c
give	c
lessons	c
to	c
pupils	c
,	c
for	c
example	c
,	c
maths	i
or	c
english	i
.	c

There	c
are	c
also	c
some	c
schools	c
which	c
offer	c
such	c
a	c
job	c
.	c

To	i
teach	i
pupils	c
is	c
not	c
easy	c
,	c
of	c
course	c
.	c

So	c
it	c
would	i
be	c
easier	c
for	c
the	c
teacher	c
!	i

It	i
is	i
also	i
not	c
a	i
dirty	c
work	c
,	i
I	c
mean	c
you	c
do	c
not	c
have	c
to	c
clean	c
rooms	c
or	c
toilets	i
of	i
other	i
people	i
!	c

And	c
you	c
do	c
not	c
need	c
to	c
carry	c
heavy	c
things	c
or	c
have	i
stress	i
with	i
customers	c
if	i
you	c
are	i
working	c
in	c
a	c
shop	c
.	c

To	c
be	c
a	c
good	c
teacher	c
you	c
especially	i
need	c
patient	i
and	c
good	c
nerves	c
!	c

And	c
the	c
money	c
you	c
get	c
is	c
not	c
less	i

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
:	c
Thank	c
you	c
for	c
letting	c
me	c
know	c
about	c
my	c
prize	c
to	i
Camp	c
California	c
in	c
the	c
USA	c
.	c

What	c
kind	c
of	c
cloth	i
we	i
have	c
take	c
?	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
your	c
colaboration	i
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs.	c
Ryan	c
.	i

I	c
'm	c
glad	c
to	c
receive	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

It	c
will	c
be	c
great	c
to	c
spend	c
two	c
weeks	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
.	c

About	c
accommodation	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
the	c
log	c
cabins	c
because	c
I	c
think	c
they	c
are	c
more	i
cleaner	i
than	c
the	c
tents	c
.	c

You	c
cannot	c
lose	i
the	i
time	c
because	c
all	c
the	c
other	c
shops	c
could	c
be	c
closed	c
when	c
you	c
arrive	c
.	c

And	c
that	c
is	c
allways	i
what	c
we	c
want	c
.	c

That	c
's	c
men	c
's	c
intention	c
.	c

Another	c
point	c
is	c
to	c
go	c
a	i
big	c
area	c
.	c

Someone	c
could	c
be	c
injured	c
.	c

A	c
huge	c
que	i
that	c
lasts	c
half	c
an	c
hour	c
or	c
more	c
and	c
finishes	c
with	c
you	c
completely	c
freaked	c
out	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

According	c
to	c
the	c
advertisement	c
you	c
gave	i
,	c
there	c
have	i
been	c
some	c
important	c
differents	i
.	i

Secondly	c
,	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
the	i
discounts	c
are	i
available	c
but	c
in	i
the	i
tickets	i
I	i
bought	i
they	i
were	i
no	i
discount	i
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
that	c
it	c
is	c
not	c
useful	c
for	c
you	c
and	c
your	c
theather	i
to	c
cheat	c
to	i
your	c
customers	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
fordwad	i
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c

Your	i
sincerely	c
,	c

Nowadays	c
,	c
technology	c
is	c
the	c
most	c
useful	c
tool	c
that	c
human	c
beings	c
have	c
.	c

It	c
affects	c
everyone	c
who	c
live	i
in	i
this	c
planet	c
and	c
every	c
activity	c
made	i
in	i
it	c
.	c

In	c
this	c
case	i
we	c
are	c
going	c
to	c
focus	c
on	c
me	c
.	i

Emilio	c
Almodar	c
,	c
18	c
years	c
old	c
,	c
University	c
Student	c
,	c
and	c
the	c
career	c
I	c
have	c
choosen	i
is	c
Internacional	i
Commerce	c
or	c
Market	i
.	c

We	c
also	c
have	c
five	c
computer	i
,	c
the	c
latest	c
versions	i
of	i
them	i
,	c
because	c
they	c
are	c
useful	c
for	c
my	c
father	c
to	c
work	c
and	i
for	c
me	c
to	c
do	c
some	c
special	c
works	i
for	c
University	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
to	c
this	c
we	c
use	c
the	c
net	c
to	c
comunicate	i
with	c
some	c
friends	c
we	c
have	c
in	c
U.S.A.	i
It	c
's	c
really	c
amazing	c
.	c

To	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
's	c
manager	c

I	c
recently	c
had	c
the	c
opportunity	c
to	c
see	c
"	c
over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
"	c
which	i
was	c
played	i
last	c
week	c
in	c
the	c
Circle	c
theatre	c
.	c

Actually	c
,	c
I	c
read	c
the	c
advertisment	i
for	c
the	c
show	c
and	c
there	c
were	c
a	c
few	c
mistakes	c
on	i
it	c
.	c

In	c
fact	c
,	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
did	c
n't	c
play	i
or	c
appear	c
on	c
stage	c
last	c
Tuesday	c
,	c
the	i
role	c
was	c
played	c
by	c
another	c
-	c
a	c
quite	c
bad	c
-	c
actor	c
,	c
less	c
famous	c
than	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
.	c

I	c
ca	c
n't	c
accept	c
waiting	c
so	c
long	c
for	c
the	c
result	c
I	c
had	c
.	c

After	c
the	c
piece	i
,	c
we	c
waned	i
to	c
eat	c
at	c
the	c
theater	i
restaurant	c
but	c
we	c
could	c
n't	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
apparently	c
closed	c
and	c
I	c
'm	c
asking	c
you	c
why	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
can	c
see	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
some	c
(	c
volontary	i
?	c
)	c
mistakes	c
on	i
the	c
advertisment	i
you	c
made	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
,	c
and	c
half	c
a	c
week	c
later	c
,	c
all	c
the	c
school	c
knew	c
about	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
started	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
new	c
friends	c
,	c
they	c
all	c
wanted	c
to	c
be	c
my	c
best	c
friend	c
.	c

Actually	c
,	c
my	i
best	i
friend	i
would	i
still	i
remain	i
Pat	i
,	c
even	c
if	c
he	c
failed	c
me	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
not	c
easy	c
to	c
keep	c
such	c
an	c
enormous	c
secret	c
and	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
keep	c
it	c
inside	c
of	i
me	c
.	c

I	c
became	i
quickly	i
bored	c
by	c
this	c
hypocrital	i
attention	c
they	c
had	i
for	i
me	c
.	c

I	c
always	c
has	i
been	c
involved	c
in	c
many	c
differents	i
associations	c
,	c
which	c
are	c
fighting	c
against	c
AIDS	c
or	c
cancer	c
.	c

Second	c
,	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
exactly	i
seven	c
thirty	c
in	c
the	c
evening	c
.	c

However	c
the	i
show	c
started	c
45	c
minutes	c
later	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
not	c
good	c
to	i
me	c
,	c
cause	i
I	c
had	c
only	c
one	c
week	i
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

Moreover	c
the	i
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
with	c
the	c
word	c
"	c
Stuff	i
vacation	c
"	c
on	c
the	c
front	c
door	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

Could	c
you	c
do	i
me	c
my	i
half	i
of	i
money	c
back	c
.	i

Have	c
you	c
ever	c
seen	c
the	c
film	c
star	c
wars	c
?	c

Because	c
the	c
people	c
will	c
stay	c
at	c
home	c
more	c
than	c
now	c
with	c
their	c
computer	c
.	c

Some	c
of	c
that	c
will	c
be	c
very	c
strange	c
to	c
our	c
eyes	c
,	c
but	c
some	c
of	c
others	i
will	c
be	c
familiar	c
to	c
us	c
.	c

It	c
will	c
be	c
very	c
interesting	c
...	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
say	c
thanks	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
and	c
your	c
care	i
about	c
your	c
customers	c
.	c

I	c
old	i
rather	c
prefer	i
stay	c
in	c
log	c
cabins	c
than	c
live	c
in	c
tents	c
.	c

I	c
so	i
glad	c
,	i
that	c
I	c
will	c
get	c
chance	i
to	c
do	c
activities	c
in	c
the	c
camp	c
.	c

I	c
play	c
basketball	c
and	c
at	i
tennis	c
.	c

What	i
about	i
basketball	i
is	i
.	c

I	c
played	c
in	c
school	i
team	c
,	c
and	c
was	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
best	c
players	c
by	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
this	c
season	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
clothes	i
and	c
money	c
.	c

Should	c
I	c
have	c
any	c
special	c
,	i
if	i
yes	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
wear	i
it	i
is	i
.	c

And	c
of	c
course	c
there	c
will	c
be	c
expenses	c
.	c

Can	c
you	c
inform	c
me	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
should	i
I	i
have	c
and	c
can	c
I	c
have	c
some	c
information	c
about	c
prices	c
to	i
visit	i
local	c
places	c
of	c
interests	i
.	c

At	i
the	i
end	i
I	c
would	c
like	c
ones	i
more	c
to	c
say	c
thanks	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
and	c
I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
by	c
post	c
with	c
all	c
detailes	i
about	c
holiday	i

Yours	c
faithfyly	i

I	c
hate	c
shopping	c
but	c
in	i
the	i
other	i
hand	i
sometimes	c
you	c
can	c
have	c
fun	c
at	i
it	c
.	c

Usualy	i
people	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
time	c
for	c
shopping	c

You	c
've	c
just	c
finished	c
your	c
long	c
hours	c
at	c
work	c
,	c
you	c
tide	i
,	c
you	c
had	c
row	i
with	c
your	c
boss	c
but	c
you	c
are	c
still	c
going	c
to	c
do	i
shopping	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
a	i
lot	c
of	c
people	c
do	c
not	c
like	c
to	c
do	i
shopping	c
in	c
big	c
stores	c
.	c

Yes	c
,	c
there	c
is	c
big	i
plus	c
for	i
big	i
store	c
of	c
course	c

You	c
can	c
find	c
everything	c
in	c
one	c
place	c
,	c
instead	i
of	i
small	c
shops	c
which	c
is	i

Dear	c
Ryan	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
inform	c
you	c
my	i
preferences	c
and	c
ask	c
a	c
few	c
questions	c
about	c
the	c
camping	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
discussed	c
it	c
with	c
my	c
boss	c
but	c
he	c
allowed	c
me	c
to	c
go	c
on	c
a	c
holiday	c
only	c
in	c
July	c
.	c

I	c
know	c
that	c
staying	c
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
is	c
more	c
convinient	i
but	c
I	c
just	c
want	c
to	c
feel	i
wilder	i
experience	c
.	c

While	c
I	c
am	c
at	c
the	c
camp	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
enjoy	i
swimming	c
and	c
photography	c
.	c

Photography	c
is	c
one	c
of	c
my	c
hobbies	c
so	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
take	c
nice	i
photos	i
in	i
the	i
camp	i
area	i
as	i
many	i
as	i
I	i
can	i
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
kindness	c
and	c
I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
your	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
,	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
travel	c
only	c
July	i
because	c
my	c
son	c
's	c
school	c
is	c
going	c
to	c
finish	c
at	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
June	c
,	c
so	c
it	c
is	c
impossible	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
travel	c
during	c
on	i
June	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
rather	c
stay	c
in	c
tents	i
because	c
I	c
used	c
to	c
go	c
camping	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
teenager	c
with	c
my	c
family	c
.	c

My	c
favourite	c
hobby	c
is	c
photography	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
been	c
taking	c
photographs	c
since	c
I	c
was	c
17	c
.	c

Beside	i
this	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
playing	c
basketball	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
so	c
sorry	c
that	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
write	c
you	i
last	c
week	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
know	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
busy	c
and	c
excited	c
about	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
which	c
I	c
worked	c
as	i
a	c
director	c
's	c
assistant	c
during	c
the	c
last	c
week	c
.	c

As	c
a	c
director	c
's	c
assistant	c
my	i
job	c
was	c
arrangement	i
of	c
the	c
audience	c
's	c
seats	c
and	c
tickets	c
.	c

All	i
seats	i
were	i
brought	i
from	i
a	i
sponsor	i
company	i
.	c

Everyday	i
I	c
worked	c
for	c
two	c
hours	c
in	c
a	c
shop	c
to	i
sale	i
tickets	c
.	c

I	c
also	c
helped	c
the	i
singer	i
's	i
some	i
special	i
demands	i
which	c
were	c
n't	c
so	c
difficult	c
to	c
do	i
.	c

After	c
the	c
concert	c
I	i
was	c
absolutely	c
exhausted	c
but	c
the	c
thing	c
is	c
I	c
will	c
never	c
forget	c
this	c
experience	c
.	c

We	c
promised	c
each	c
other	c
to	c
keep	c
in	c
touch	c
and	c
she	c
has	c
invited	c
me	c
her	i
next	c
concert	c
!	c

So	c
,	c
my	i
news	i
are	i
finished	i
.	c

Write	c
me	i
back	c
soon	c
.	c

Dear	c
Helen	c

I	c
never	i
been	c
in	i
the	c
USA	c
and	c
I	c
should	c
be	c
glad	c
to	c
spend	c
two	c
weeks	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
.	c

For	c
the	c
accommodation	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
have	c
tents	i
because	c
I	c
used	i
to	i
travel	i
in	i
Campsites	i
and	c
I	c
love	c
it	c
during	c
summer	c
,	c
just	i
to	i
change	i
the	i
customs	i
!	c
!	c

That	c
's	c
why	c
it	c
should	c
be	c
a	c
great	c
day	c
!	c

Singapoor	c
and	c
many	c
places	c
in	c
Asia	c
are	c
famous	c
for	c
the	c
shopping	c
,	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
really	c
nice	c
to	c
go	c
there	c
with	c
money	i
to	c
buy	c
that	i
you	c
always	c
wanted	c
to	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
have	c
no	c
money	c
and	c
a	c
friend	c
ask	i
you	c
to	c
come	i
for	i
shopping	c
,	c
it	c
should	c
be	c
boring	c
!	c
and	i
you	c
become	i
jealous	c
against	i
him	c
and	c
want	c
him	c
to	c
do	c
that	i
quickly	c
!	c
or	i
you	c
are	i
going	i
to	i
get	c
nervous	i
!	c

Dear	c
Madam	c
and	c
Mister	i

It	c
played	i
an	i
other	i
one	i
who	c
played	c
very	c
bad	i
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
the	c
musical	c
should	c
start	c
on	i
19.30	c
,	c
but	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
wait	c
until	c
20.15	c
!	c

It	c
was	c
boring	c
that	c
nothing	c
happend	i
such	i
a	c
long	c
time	c
on	c
the	c
stage	c
.	c

Did	c
you	c
know	c
that	c
you	c
have	c
no	c
discounts	c
on	c
your	c
tickets	c
?	c

Why	c
do	c
you	c
write	c
things	c
on	c
your	c
advertisement	c
when	i
nothing	i
is	i
true	c
?	c

But	c
how	c
can	i
it	i
be	i
,	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
!	c

This	i
are	c
too	c
many	c
negatives	i
points	c
for	c
one	c
evening	c
.	c

Your	i
faithfully	c

Pica	c
Landen	c

This	c
is	c
not	c
a	c
tabu	i
by	i
me	c
and	c
my	c
friends	c
.	c

We	c
have	c
discussed	c
about	i
it	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
times	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
very	c
difficult	c
to	c
change	c
the	i
clothes	c
and	c
the	i
fashion	c
so	c
much	c
again	c
.	c

They	c
just	c
look	c
funny	c
!	c

It	c
is	c
a	c
pleasure	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

Because	c
of	c
it	i
I	c
believe	c
it	i
is	c
the	c
best	c
date	i
for	c
travel	i
You	c
asked	c
me	c
about	c
accommodations	i
or	i
Camp	c
California	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
tents	i
because	c
I	c
suppose	c
I	c
will	c
have	c
more	c
contact	c
with	c
natural	c
things	c
than	c
in	c
log	i
cabins	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
something	c
about	c
money	c
and	c
clothes	c
.	c

How	c
much	c
money	c
I	i
can	i
spent	i
during	c
this	c
time	c
?	c

I	c
am	c
look	i
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c

Rui	c
Veloso	c

I	c
'm	c
too	i
excited	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
about	c
a	c
fantastic	c
experience	c
that	c
I	c
had	c
last	c
month	c
.	c

I	c
met	c
Madonna	c
and	c
could	c
talk	c
with	c
her	c
for	c
ten	c
minutes	c
.	c

Of	c
course	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
tired	c
at	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
five	c
days	c
because	c
of	c
some	c
stressed	i
situations	c
.	c

Hope	c
to	c
hearing	i
from	c
you	c
soon	c

With	c
best	c
wishes	c
,	c

I	c
have	c
just	c
received	c
your	c
letter	c
in	c
which	c
you	c
inform	c
that	i
I	c
won	c
first	i
prize	c
of	c
two	c
weeks	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
excited	c
about	c
it	c
!	c

I	c
would	c
love	c
to	c
participate	c
in	c
the	c
singing	c
and	c
photography	c
activities	c
.	c

Singing	c
is	c
something	c
I	c
have	c
enjoyed	c
since	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
little	c
child	c
.	c

In	c
fact	c
,	c
I	c
took	c
some	c
singing	c
lessons	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
not	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
photography	c
but	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
make	c
an	c
album	c
to	c
share	c
it	c
with	c
my	c
family	c
when	c
I	c
come	c
home	c
.	c

Could	c
you	c
please	c
tell	c
me	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
do	i
you	c
recommend	c
for	c
the	i
camping	c
?	c

How	c
much	c
money	c
will	c
I	c
need	c
?	c

Cordially	i
yours	i
,	i

If	c
people	c
would	c
think	c
about	c
it	c
BEFORE	c
going	c
shopping	c
,	c
they	c
would	c
not	c
have	c
a	c
headache	c
when	c
they	c
go	c
home	c
and	c
realize	c
they	c
did	c
not	c
want	c
what	c
they	c
bought	c
.	c

Shopping	c
can	c
be	c
an	c
awful	c
adventure	c
when	c
people	c
want	c
to	c
buy	c
all	c
their	c
presents	c
the	c
day	c
before	c
Christmas	c
,	c
for	c
example	c
.	c

There	c
is	c
no	c
way	c
to	c
find	c
good	c
prices	c
!	c

Shops	c
are	c
crowded	c
,	c
items	c
are	c
of	c
bad	c
quality	c
and	c
people	c
are	c
buying	c
without	c
thinking	c
.	c

It	c
may	c
seem	c
relaxing	c
at	c
the	c
beginning	c
,	c
but	c
if	c
they	c
take	c
their	c
credit	c
cards	c
with	c
them	c
,	c
the	c
stress	c
will	c
increase	c
when	c
they	c
have	c
to	c
pay	c
for	i
the	c
bills	c

concert	c
and	c
they	c
was	i
going	c
to	c
pay	c
us	c
five	c
pounds	c
an	c
hour	c
.	c

The	c
concert	c
was	c
on	c
a	c
sunday	i
and	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
work	c
on	i
the	c
back	c
of	c
the	c
stadge	i
,	c
doing	c
all	c
sorts	c
of	c
things	c
like	c
colecting	i
rubish	i
and	c
helping	c
other	c
people	c
that	i
was	i
working	c
there	c
.	c

lots	c
of	c
love	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
the	c
actors	c
that	c
were	c
announced	c
to	i
take	i
part	c
in	c
the	c
show	c
were	c
not	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
,	c
the	c
discounts	c
were	c
not	c
available	c
and	c
the	i
principal	c
point	c
:	c
it	c
started	c
forty	i
five	i
minutes	c
later	i
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

Without	c
leaving	c
my	c
bedroom	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
go	c
anywhere	c
using	c
the	c
Internet	c
.	c

Another	i
bad	c
points	c
can	c
be	c
mentioned	c
,	c
like	c
the	i
polution	i
for	c
example	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
,	c

Tina	c
Truelove	c
performed	c
marvellous	i
,	c
but	c
him	c
I	i
think	c
he	c
is	c
a	c
"	c
street	c
actor	c
"	c
from	c
Covent	c
Garden	c
.	c

Even	c
worse	c
it	i
was	c
the	c
delay	c
,	i
the	i
Show	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
instead	c
of	c
19:30	c
,	c
that	i
drove	c
me	c
mad	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
a	c
student	c
visiting	c
London	c
for	c
one	c
week	c
only	c
and	c
I	c
asked	c
for	c
discount	i
ticket	c
,	i
I	c
could	c
not	c
get	c
it	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
really	c
unfair	c
,	i
I	c
paid	c
normal	i
price	c
.	c

Also	c
there	c
was	c
another	c
problem	c
,	i
I	c
planned	c
to	c
visit	c
the	c
Theatre	c
restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
I	c
could	c
not	c
,	c
was	i
closed	c
because	c
it	c
has	i
been	i
refurbished	c
and	c
redecorated	c
.	c

The	c
only	c
thing	c
to	c
do	c
is	c
:	c
to	c
compensate	c
me	c
,	c
send	c
my	i
money	c
back	c
,	i
I	c
am	c
sending	c
my	c
ticket	c
for	c
that	c
:	i
Hope	c
you	c
'll	c
be	c
fair	c
with	c
me	c
otherwise	c
I	c
am	c
going	c

Modern	c
life	c

Thanks	c

that	c
I	c
have	c

the	c

About	c
the	c
time	c
when	c
I	c
like	i
to	c
travel	c
is	i
only	i
July	c
,	c
because	c
in	c
the	c
summer	c
is	i
it	i
very	c
busy	c
at	c
work	c

I	c
working	i
with	c

going	c
on	c

like	c

and	c
I	c
do	i
n't	i

it	i

so	c
I	c
prefer	c
log	c
cabins	c

In	c
the	c
summer	c
I	c
'm	c

almost	c

We	c
have	i
worked	i
the	c
whole	c
day	c
and	c
luckily	c
at	c
least	c
we	c
had	c
some	c
food	c
.	c

The	c
most	i
beautiful	i
things	c
were	c
that	c
we	c
saw	c
famous	c
singers	c
and	c
I	c
spoke	c
with	c
Robbie	c
Williams	c

Another	c
thing	c
I	c
have	i
done	i
was	c
the	c
make	i
up	i
only	i
for	c
about	c
fifteen	c
minutes	c
.	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c

At	i
first	i
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
go	i
travel	c
on	i
July	c
,	c
because	c
before	c
them	i
I	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
time	c
to	c
travel	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
log	i
cabin	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
more	c
convenient	c
than	c
in	c
tents	c
.	c

And	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
chance	c
about	i
painting	i
and	c
photography	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
not	c
so	c
fit	c
and	c
well	i
condition	i
,	c
so	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
like	c
to	c
do	c
activitily	i
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
invitation	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Do	c
you	c
like	c
the	i
shopping	c
?	c

You	c
could	c
go	c
shopping	c
for	c
some	c
rest	c
to	c
the	c
high	c
street	c
or	c
a	c
department	c
store	c
.	c

Moreover	c
you	i
bought	c
something	c
then	c
you	c
could	c
find	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
little	c
bit	c
expensive	i
than	c
the	c
other	c
shop	c
.	c

Both	c
cases	c
are	i
often	i
happened	i
in	i
shopping	c
.	c

Then	c
you	c
should	c
check	c
the	c
price	c
and	c
the	c
quality	c
of	c
the	c
good	i
.	c

To	c
the	c
manger	c

Circle	c
Theatre	c

Smith	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
I	c
've	c
been	c
really	c
disappointed	c
.	c

Moreover	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
expected	c
to	c
begin	c
at	c
19.30	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
delayed	c
of	i
forty-five	c
minutes	c
.	c

You	c
had	c
promised	c
a	c
perfect	c
evening	c
but	c
I	c
spend	i
an	i
horrible	c
one	c
and	i
you	c
ruined	c
my	c
holiday	c
!	c

What	i
are	i
you	i
mistaken	i
us	i
for	i
,	c
Mr	c
Smith	c
?	c

That	c
's	c
why	c
I	c
want	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
!	c

Otherweise	i
I	c
'll	c
have	c
to	c
put	c
some	c
others	i
ads	c
in	i
London	c
saying	c
that	c
your	c
show	c
is	c
just	c
a	c
fake	i

Dear	i
Sir	i
and	i
Madam	i

I	c
am	i
recently	i
spending	i
a	c
week	c
's	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
just	c
visited	c
your	c
theatre	c
to	c
see	c
a	c
musical	c
show	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
complain	c
with	i
couple	i
of	c
things	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
the	c
discount	c
for	c
the	c
tickets	c
were	i
not	c
available	c
,	c
and	c
especially	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
people	c
were	c
disappointed	c
that	c
they	c
can	i
not	i
visit	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
,	c
due	c
to	c
the	c
cleaner	c
forgotten	i
to	c
clean	c
up	c
the	c
mess	c
from	c
the	c
previous	c
party	c
.	c

Lastly	c
,	c
I	c
think	i
I	i
could	i
not	i
call	i
this	c
as	i
my	c
perfect	c
evening	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
for	c
a	c
refund	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
hope	c
as	c
a	i
Manager	c
of	c
London	c
's	c
newest	c
theatre	c
,	c
you	c
would	i
handle	c
the	c
situation	c
favourbly	i
.	c

Although	c
,	c
we	c
are	c
great	c
friends	c
,	c
but	i
sometimes	c
people	c
can	c
make	c
such	c
a	i
stupid	c
mistake	i
,	c
and	c
so	c
there	c
was	c
one	c
time	c
when	c
Pat	c
and	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
fight	c
,	i
it	i
all	c
started	c
when	c
once	c
I	c
accidently	i
,	i
took	c
the	c
wrong	c
bag	c
back	c
to	c
my	c
house	c
,	c
and	c
there	c
was	i
lady	c
's	c
knickers	c
inside	c
,	i
I	c
was	c
so	c
nervous	c
and	c
embarassing	i
,	c
so	c
I	c
tell	i
Pat	c
and	c
there	i
he	i
goes	i
,	i
he	c
tell	i
every	c
single	c
students	i
in	c
the	c
school	c
that	c
I	i
've	i
stolen	c
girl	i
knickers	c
,	c
and	c
everyone	c
started	c
to	c
call	c
me	c
a	c
pervert	c
.	c

Anyway	c
Pat	i
eventually	c
apologized	c
to	c
me	c
and	c
we	c
still	i
being	i
best	c
mates	c
as	c
ever	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
expected	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
fantastic	c
musical	c
show	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
everything	c
was	c
not	c
performed	c
as	c
you	c
had	c
advertised	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
the	c
musical	c
was	c
not	c
started	c
on	c
time	c
.	c

Afterall	i
,	c
I	c
lost	i
my	c
find	i
return	c
train	c
after	c
show	i
.	c

When	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
yong	i
child	c
,	c
I	c
used	c
to	c
be	c
interested	c
in	c
reading	c
a	i
scientific	i
fiction	i
.	c

Interestingly	c
,	c
nowadays	c
,	c
I	c
live	c
in	c
the	c
scientific	c
world	c
which	c
I	c
read	c
in	i
the	c
book	i
.	c

Probably	c
,	c
I	c
started	c
useing	i
mobile-phone	i
5	c
years	c
ago	c
.	c

It	c
takes	c
just	c
a	c
few	c
minutes	c
to	c
send	c
e-mail	c
to	c
some	i
one	i
.	c

When	c
I	c
received	c
your	c
letter	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
surprised	c
and	c
happy	c

First	c

With	c
my	c

we	i
looked	c
for	c
a	i

a	c
guy	c
who	c
wanted	c
to	c
buy	i
some	i
drinks	c
in	i
the	c
pop	c
concert	c
and	c
so	c
we	c
told	c

that	c
we	c
were	i

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writting	i
to	c
complain	c
about	c
a	c
musical	c
show	c
last	i
weekend	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

But	c
the	c
worst	c
thing	c
is	c
the	c
actors	c
were	c
not	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove.	c
,	i
It	c
was	c
really	c
let	i
me	i
down	i
!	c
!	c

To	c
be	c
honestly	i
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
you	c
could	i
return	i
the	c
money	c
back	i
to	c
me	c
.	c

Thank	c
for	i
you	i
patience	i
.	c

Your	i
faithfully	c
,	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

Although	i
,	i
Pat	c
is	c
very	c
smart	c
and	c
intelligent	c
.	c

Lily	c
was	c
one	c
of	c
her	c
best	c
friend	i
before	i
three	c
year	i
.	c

Nick	c
was	c
Lily	i
husband	c
.	c

Lily	c
felt	c
very	c
nervous	c
about	c
their	c
financial	c
problem	i
and	c
their	c
future	c
.	c

As	c
they	c
went	i
to	c
getting	i
a	c
baby	c
.	c

She	c
told	c
to	i
Pat	c
about	c
what	c
had	c
happened	c
in	c
her	c
family	c
.	c

She	c
told	c
to	i
Pat	c
that	c
she	c
did	c
n't	c
want	c
other	i
people	c
know	i
it	i
except	c
her	c
.	c

Pat	c
also	c
promised	c
not	c
to	c
tell	c
other	c
people	c
.	c

But	c
in	i
one	i
gathering	i
party	c
,	c
their	c
friend	i
want	i
to	c
show	c
their	c
concern	c
,	c
they	i
went	c
to	c
ask	c
about	c
Nick	c
and	c
send	i
him	c
sympathy	i
.	c

But	c
Lily	c
never	c
tell	i
her	c
what	c
she	c
really	c
want	i
and	i
what	c
her	i
really	c
thought	i
the	i
thing	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
to	c
be	c
sure	c
it	c
would	c
not	c
rain	c
during	c
the	c
trip	c
which	i
is	i
boring	i
?	c
!	c

And	c
when	c
the	c
sun	c
is	c
shining	c
you	c
are	c
relax	i
and	c
you	c
feel	c
good	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
tents	i
to	c
sleep	c
at	i
Camp	c
California	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
fun	c
to	c
sleep	c
in	c
tents	c
to	i
compare	c
in	i
a	c
house	c
.	c

You	c
are	c
in	c
communication	c
with	c
the	i
nature	c
and	c
you	c
can	c
hear	c
the	c
insects	c

Tennis	c
because	c
I	c
play	c
Tennis	i
and	c
I	c
am	c
classed	c
15-5	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
nice	c
to	c
play	c
tennis	c
outside	c
in	i
the	c
court	c
when	c
the	c
weather	c
is	c
hot	c
.	c

You	c
can	c
do	c
it	c
alone	c
.	c

you	i
need	c
technics	i
to	c
move	i
the	c
windsurf	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
questions	c
:	c
Must	i
I	c
take	c
with	i
me	i
my	i
clothes	i
?	c

You	c
do	c
n't	c
find	c
your	i
size	i
or	i
the	i
good	i
color	i
in	i
the	i
article	i
.	c

Your	i
must	c
test	i
several	c
shops	c
and	c
compare	c
the	c
price	c
,	i
the	c
quality	c
of	c
the	c
articles	i

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
if	c
there	c
is	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
people	c
in	c
the	c
shops	c
because	c
you	c
ca	c
n't	c

the	c

I	c

I	c

therefore	i
I	c
only	c
have	c
holidays	c
in	c
this	c

The	c

that	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
do	c
in	i
the	c
camp	c
are	c
Basketball	c
and	c
Surfing	c
.	c

Basketball	c
is	c
the	c
sport	c
that	c
I	c
really	c
like	c

I	c
am	c

There	c
are	c
people	c
that	c
loves	i
going	c
to	i
the	i
shopping	c
.	c

They	c
are	c
addicted	c
in	i
buying	c
things	c
.	c

Some	c
doctors	c
say	c
that	c
buy	i
without	c
control	c
is	c
a	c
disease	c
and	c
I	c
agree	c
with	c
them	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
a	c
friend	c
who	c
is	c
a	c
compulsory	i
buyer	i
.	c

He	c
ca	c
n't	c
stop	c
buying	c
things	c
,	i
he	i
spend	i
all	c
his	c
money	c
buying	c
things	c
that	c
he	c
sometimes	c
do	i
n't	i
use	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
this	c
one	i
bad	c
side	c
of	c
shopping	c
and	c
many	c
people	c
have	c
this	c
problem	c
.	c

Sometimes	c
,	c
shopping	c
can	c
be	c
really	c
bore	i
especially	i
in	i
important	c
dates	c
when	c
the	c
shop	i
are	c
absolutaly	i
crowded	c
and	c
you	c
ca	c

Mrs	c
Helen	c
RYAN	c

I	c
received	c
your	c
letter	c
in	i
this	c
morning	i
and	i
thank	i
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
your	c
kind	c
letter	c
and	c
chosing	i
me	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
tents	i
because	i
I	c
had	c
much	i
great	c
times	c
in	c
tents	c
during	c
my	c
previous	c
holidays	c
,	c
if	c
it	c
is	i
suitable	i
for	i
you	i
.	c

I	c
used	c
to	c
work	c
for	c
a	c
sailing	c
company	c
in	c
Turkey	c
.	c

My	c
other	c
passion	c
is	c
photography	c
,	c
especially	i
I	i
like	c
black	c
and	c
white	c
photography	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
a	c
camera	c
which	i
is	c
a	c
called	i
Minolta	c
X300	c

That	i
is	c
a	c
manual	c
camera	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

I	c
like	c
shopping	c
but	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
bad	c
experience	c
about	i
my	i
recent	c
shopping	c
.	i

First	c
of	c
all	c
I	i
went	c
to	c
a	c
local	c
shop	c
but	c
I	i
could	i
n't	i
find	i
enough	c
selection	c
of	c
products	c
.	c

Then	c
I	c
visited	c
another	c
one	c
,	c
in	c
Cambridge	c
Street	c
.	c

I	c
decided	c
to	c
by	i
a	c
CD	i
room	i
driver	i
for	c
my	c
old	c
computer	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
approached	c
to	i
the	c
cashier	c
I	c
suddenly	c
noticed	c
my	c
wallet	c
had	c
gone	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
nightmare	c
there	i
were	c
pickpokets	i
in	c
the	c
shop	c
.	c

it	i
costs	i
me	c
about	c
£	c
500	c
.	c

This	c
experience	c
has	c
changed	c
my	c
shopping	c
habit	i
,	c
now	c
I	c
do	c
all	c
my	c
shopping	c
on	c
the	c
internet	i
.	c

But	c
I	c
'm	c
not	c
sure	c
how	i
it	c
is	c
safe	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
attempt	i
your	c
invite	i
in	c
July	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
good	i
talent	i
and	i
skill	i
about	i
them	i
.	c

Do	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
bring	c
some	c
cash	c
on	i
me	c
?	c

I	c
also	i
would	i
like	c
to	c
get	c
some	c
information	c
about	c
weather	i
.	c

Shopping	c
is	c
part	c
of	c
our	c
life	c
.	c

Most	c
of	i
the	i
people	c
get	c
pay	i
on	c
friday	i
night	c
then	c
they	c
go	c
to	i
shopping	c
.	c

All	i
day	i
you	i
had	i
worked	i
hard	i
,	i
on	i
the	c
way	c
home	c
you	c
want	c
to	c
pick	c
up	c
some	c
milk	c
from	c
shop	i
you	i
have	c
to	c
waite	i
on	i
avarage	i
ten	i
minute	i
.	c

I	c
ca	c
n't	c
cope	c
with	c
that	c
.	c

I	c
prefer	c
go	i
home	c
without	c
milk	i
.	c

There	c
are	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
option	i
and	c
item	i
make	i
our	c
chose	i
difficut	i
.	c

it	i
is	c
hard	c
to	i
make	i
decide	i
which	c
suitable	i
for	c
you	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
really	c
surprised	c
and	c
very	c
happy	c
when	c
I	c
read	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
.	c

For	c
my	c
stay	c
in	c
California	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
the	i
accommodation	i
in	i
tents	i
because	c
this	c
gives	c
me	c
a	c
feeling	c
of	c
freedom	c
and	c
adventure	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
quite	c
different	c
to	c
my	c
live	i
here	c
in	c
Greece	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
free	c
time	c
I	c
have	c
climbed	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
mountains	c
in	c
the	c
surrounding	c
area	c
so	c
I	c
can	c
say	c
,	i
that	c
I	c
am	c
quite	c
good	c
in	i
climbing	c
.	c

Is	c
it	c
very	c
hot	c
?	c

And	c
my	c
last	c
question	c
:	c
how	c
many	c
persons	i
are	c
going	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
each	c
tent	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Many	c
people	c
,	c
especially	c
women	c
,	c
love	c
shopping	c
.	c

But	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
big	i
variety	c
in	c
the	c
store	c
.	c

And	c
very	c
often	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
pay	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
money	c
for	c
the	c
product	c
you	c
want	c
.	c

And	c
many	c
people	c
are	c
in	c
a	c
hurry	c
,	c
so	c
do	c
n't	c
wonder	i
if	c
other	c
people	c
have	i
not	i
tolerance	i
and	c
patience	c
to	c
wait	c
and	c
hit	c
you	c
with	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
Brown	c
,	c
I	c
'm	c
writing	c
this	c
letter	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
that	c
I	c
saw	c
.	c

There	c
was	c
an	i
other	i
actor	c
,	c
James	c
Kee	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
like	c
him	c
!	c

In	c
addition	c
to	c
,	i
the	c
show	c
did	c
n't	c
start	c
at	c
20.15	c
;	c
so	c
it	c
ended	c
at	c
23.45	c
and	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
go	c
to	c
a	c
meeting	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
very	c
disappointed	c
for	i
all	c
these	c
problems	c
!	c

The	c
ticket	c
's	c
price	c
was	c
£	c
20	c
and	c
there	c
was	i
n't	i
any	c
discount	i
!	c

I	c
had	i
n't	i
a	i
great	c
fun	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
ask	c
for	c
money	i
back	c
.	c

Your	i
faithfully	c

Pat	c
was	c
astonished	c
,	c
and	c
did	c
n't	c
know	c
what	c
(	c
she	c
)	c
had	i
to	i
tell	i
Karla	c
.	c

This	c
age	i
's	i
difference	c
was	c
too	c
big	c
!	c

Besides	c
,	c
Karla	c
was	c
a	c
shy	c
,	c
polite	c
girl	c
that	c
Pat	c
wanted	c
to	c
help	c
.	c

So	c
she	c
decided	c
to	c
tell	c
Hill	c
all	i
the	i
story	i
.	c

They	c
agreed	c
that	c
Karla	c
's	c
love	c
was	c
only	c
a	c
dream	c
.	c

So	c
they	c
went	c
to	c
talk	c
with	c
her	c
about	c
the	c
situation	c
,	c
but	c
when	c
she	c
knew	c
that	c
they	c
had	i
know	i
her	c
feelings	c
to	i
Mr.	c
Beek	c
,	c
she	c
decided	c
not	c
to	c
tell	c
Pat	c
anything	c
forever	i
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

I	c
write	i
to	c
you	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
dreadful	c
evening	c
I	c
had	c
when	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
see	c
your	c
show	c
at	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
the	i
9th	c
june	i
.	c

But	c
to	c
add	c
to	c
this	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
make	i
a	c
long	c
queue	c
to	c
get	c
a	c
full	i
price	i
ticket	c
when	c
instead	i
I	c
had	c
brought	c
my	c
student	c
card	c
on	i
the	c
purpose	c
of	c
getting	c
a	i
discount	c
which	c
had	c
been	c
advertised	c
but	c
did	c
n't	c
in	c
fact	c
exist	c
.	c

The	c
show	c
which	c
was	c
to	c
start	c
at	c
19.30	c
only	c
began	c
at	c
20.15	c
and	c
therefore	c
me	i
and	c
my	c
friends	c
were	c
n't	c
able	c
to	c
find	c
a	c
restaurant	c
when	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
because	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
on	i
sanitary	c
reasons	c
.	c

This	c
feature	i
did	c
n't	c
allow	c
you	c
to	c
tell	c
him	c
much	c
about	c
yourself	c
.	c

He	c
was	c
n't	c
really	c
wicked	c
,	c
he	c
merely	c
did	c
n't	c
understand	c
to	i
keep	c
his	c
mouth	c
shut	c
,	c
especially	c
at	c
school	c
where	c
every	c
little	c
unimportant	c
thing	c
about	c
your	c
so	i
called	i
"	c
private	c
life	c
"	c
runs	c
three	c
laps	c
around	c
the	c
schoolyard	c
before	c
you	c
learn	c
it	c
although	c
you	c
are	c
the	c
most	c
concerned	c
about	c
it	c
and	c
did	c
n't	c
even	c
know	c
.	c

Well	c
,	c
some	c
people	c
just	c
do	c
n't	c
care	c
,	c
some	c
are	c
bothered	c
and	c
feel	c
ill	c
at	c
ease	c
.	c

But	c
small	i
drama	c
can	c
grow	c
up	i
as	c
children	c
are	c
very	c
sensitive	c
.	c

There	c
is	c
one	c
point	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
make	c
clear	c
,	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
begrudge	c
Pat	c
anything	c
.	c

We	c
all	c
speak	c
or	c
have	c
spoken	c
of	c
our	c
neighbours	c
,	c
family	c
,	c
classmates	c
,	c
workmates	c
,	c
friends	c
in	c
bad	c
terms	c
.	c

According	i
to	i
me	i
what	c
is	c
more	c
to	i
regret	i
is	c
when	c
now	i
we	c
full-growns	i
continue	c
to	i
act	i
with	i
this	c
bad	c
habit	c
.	c

The	c
criticism	i
spirit	c
has	c
to	c
be	c
preserved	c
but	c
we	c
must	c
keep	c
our	c
secrets	c
.	c

What	c
allows	c
us	c
to	c
reveal	c
parts	c
of	c
someone	c
others	i
privacy	i
,	i
nothing	i
.	c

Both	c
of	c
them	c
are	c
my	c
hobbies	c
,	i
I	c
have	c
won	c
some	c
prizes	c
in	c
my	c
school	c
competition	i
of	i
them	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

The	c
performer	c
,	c
Paul	c
,	c
is	c
a	c
big	c
music	i
name	c
at	c
the	c
present	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
'd	c
never	c
met	i
him	c
before	c
.	c

I	c
told	c
him	c
I	c
loved	c
his	c
songs	c
,	i
he	i
was	c
very	c
happy	c
.	c

Afterwards	c
,	c
he	c
gave	c
his	i
pen	c
for	c
my	c
enthusiasm	c
.	c

Write	c
soon	c
,	i
tell	i
me	c
how	c
you	c
're	c
getting	c
on	c
in	c
your	c
new	c
job	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
terrible	c
evening	c
.	c

At	c
first	c
I	c
became	c
worried	c
because	c
there	c
was	i
n't	i
any	c
discounts	c
available	c
,	c
like	i
your	c
advertisement	c
say	i
.	i

It	c
is	c
n't	c
fair	c
not	c
returning	c
the	c
money	c
for	i
a	c
person	c
who	c
bought	c
tickets	c
to	c
watch	c
a	c
show	c
that	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
be	c
great	c
,	c
but	c
actually	c
was	c
a	c
shame	i
.	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
your	c
answer	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
big	c
quarrel	c
,	c
people	c
that	c
were	c
many	c
meters	i
distant	i
could	c
hear	c
it	c
.	c

Pat	c
entered	c
the	c
fight	c
,	c
and	c
it	c
became	c
more	c
loud	c
and	c
agressive	i
.	c

And	c
Nick	c
told	c
her	c
that	c
his	c
real	c
love	c
was	c
his	c
girlfriend	c
Caroline	c
,	c
and	c
that	c
they	c
were	c
n't	c
going	c
to	c
break	c
up	c
.	c

Poor	c
Ali.	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
this	c
letter	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
a	c
musical	c
show	c
which	c
I	i
've	i
seen	i
on	i
last	c
Saturday	c
.	c

I	c
went	c
to	c
London	c
to	c
see	c
this	c
musical	c
but	c
I	c
was	c
absolutely	c
dissapointed	i
about	i
the	c
show	c
.	c

The	c
show	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
start	c
at	c
19:30	c
but	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
about	c
fourty	c
five	c
minutes	c
later	c
than	c
original	i
starting	c
time	c
.	c

The	c
thing	c
which	c
made	c
me	c
really	c
upset	c
was	c
the	c
actor	c
.	c

I	c
liked	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
so	c
much	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
expecting	c
to	c
see	c
him	c
but	c
you	c
did	c
n't	c
even	c
mention	c
about	i
that	i
actor	c
was	c
going	c
to	c
change	i
to	c
another	c
guy	i
.	c

After	c
finished	i
watching	c
the	c
show	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
restaurant	c
which	c
you	c
advertised	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
about	c
21:00	c
,	c
I	c
thought	c
it	c
was	c
bit	i
later	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
my	c
falt	i
anyway	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
so	i
upset	c
to	c
say	c
anything	c
anymore	c
and	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
get	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
which	c
I	c
paid	c
for	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

Your	i
faithfully	c

Fashion	c
became	i
a	c
part	c
of	c
our	c
life	c
and	c
some	c
people	c
think	c
that	c
what	c
clothes	c
you	c
wear	c
is	c
most	i
important	c
thing	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
very	c
formal	c
fashion	c
,	c
but	c
now	c
people	c
wear	c
more	c
sexy	c
clothes	c
than	c
100	c
years	c
ago	c
.	c

Fashion	c
keeps	c
changing	c
.	c

Therefore	c
,	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
fashion	c
might	c
be	c
changed	c
a	c
lot	c
.	c

The	c
enviroment	i
will	c
be	c
very	c
polluted	c
and	c
finally	c
we	c
'll	c
get	c
desease	i
.	c

May	i
be	i
,	c
science	c
will	c
be	c
developed	c
and	c
make	c
our	c
enviroment	i
clean	c
,	c
we	i
will	c
not	c
wear	c
anything	c
at	c
all	c
!	c
!	c
!	c
(	c
except	c
under	i
wear	i
)	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
that	c
the	c
enviroment	i
will	c
be	c
better	c
than	c
now	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
and	c
our	c
fashion	c
will	c
be	c
changed	c
but	c
nobody	c
knows	c
how	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
may	c
I	c
give	c
you	c
my	c
suggestions	c
and	c
opinions	c
?	c

I	c
think	c
the	c
International	c
Arts	c
Festival	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
idea	c
!	c

Because	c
it	c
does	i
not	c
complex	c
,	c
also	i
we	i
do	i
n't	i
confuse	i
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	i

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

Anyway	c
,	c
you	c
want	c
to	c
know	c
about	c
rules	c
at	c
home	c
and	c
school	c
in	c
my	c
country	c
,	c
do	c
n't	c
you	c
?	c

My	c
school	c
's	c
rules	c
are	c
n't	c
strict	c
.	c

Of	c
course	c
we	c
can	c
go	c
out	c
the	i
classroom	c
in	i
any	c
time	c
.	c

But	c
some	c
schools	c
in	c
my	c
country	c
do	c
n't	c
allow	c
many	i
things	c
.	c

One	c
of	c
the	c
rules	c
of	i
my	c
friend	c
's	c
school	c
is	c
not	i
to	c
drink	c
and	i
eat	c
something	i
during	c
a	c
class	c
.	c

Also	c
,	c
there	c
is	c
one	c
strict	c
rule	c
at	c
my	c
home	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
's	c
a	c
stupid	c
rule	c
!	c

Many	c
of	c
my	c
friends	c
have	c
this	c
rule	c
.	c

How	c
about	c
in	c
your	c
country	c
?	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
with	c
reference	c
to	c
a	c
musical	c
show	c
I	c
saw	c
recently	c
in	c
your	c
theatre	c
.	c

More	i
over	i
,	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
buying	c
our	c
tickets	c
,	c
there	c
were	c
n't	c
any	c
discounts	c
in	c
spite	c
of	c
the	c
fact	c
that	c
my	c
wife	c
and	c
me	i
are	c
both	c
on	c
pension	i
.	c

As	c
a	c
result	c
our	i
evening	c
was	c
completely	c
spoiled	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
in	c
the	c
very	c
near	c
future	c
to	c
offer	c
me	c
a	c
partly	i
refund	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

One	c
day	c
Maria	c
and	c
her	c
mother	c
returned	c
home	c
and	c
found	c
a	c
letter	c
.	c

They	c
read	c
the	c
letter	c
and	c
slowly	c
went	c
onto	i
the	c
kitchen	c
.	c

Maria	c
bought	i
his	c
favorite	i
food	c
and	c
she	c
throw	i
it	c
away	i
into	c
the	c
bin	c
.	c

They	c
had	c
gone	c
everywhere	c
together	c
and	c
laughed	c
a	c
lot	c
.	c

So	c
she	c
decided	c
to	c
tell	c
Pat	c
,	c
her	c
lovely	c
Pat	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
without	c
any	c
announcement	c
,	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
was	c
playing	c
his	c
role	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
not	c
satisfied	c
with	c
your	c
show	c
at	c
all	c
.	c

Therefore	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
you	c
should	c
pay	i
some	i
money	i
back	i
for	i
me	i
.	c

Please	c
let	c
me	c
know	c
how	i
you	c
think	c
of	c
my	c
complain	i
and	c
request	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
modern	c
technology	c

But	c
now	c
I	c
can	c
communicate	c
with	c
her	c
every	c
day	c
by	c
e-mail	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
we	c
can	c
talk	c
on	c
the	c
phone	c
.	c

in	i
addittion	i
,	c
I	c
could	i
go	c
tot	i
Britain	c
to	i
see	i
her	i
by	i
plane	i
.	c

Before	c
the	c
plane	c
was	c
invested	i
,	c
I	c
suppose	c
it	c
might	c
take	i
several	c
months	c
to	c
visit	c
Britain	c
by	c
ship	c
.	c

Thanks	c
to	c
such	c
modern	c
technology	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
improve	c
the	i
relationship	c
with	c
my	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

Here	c
I	c
am	c
,	c
writting	i
you	i
to	c
tell	c
everything	i
about	c
my	c
wonderful	c
experience	c
at	c
the	c
concert	c
.	c

And	c
I	c
was	i
helping	i
them	c
fixing	i
the	c
last	c
details	c
.	c

When	c
the	c
concert	c
started	c
I	i
was	c
preparing	c
some	c
drinks	c
for	c
the	c
band	c
because	c
when	i
the	i
concert	i
finished	i
they	c
were	i
very	c
tired	c
and	c
tersty	i
.	c

After	c
the	c
concert	c
I	c
only	c
help	i
with	i
tidy	c
up	c
the	c
place	c
and	c
made	c
sure	c
that	c
everything	c
was	c
under	c
control	c
and	c
clean	c
.	c

but	i
also	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
the	c
very	c
nice	c
prize	c
.	c

Here	c
are	i
some	c
of	c
the	c
information	c
:	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
then	i
the	i
school	i
year	i
ends	i
and	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
go	c
on	c
vacation	c
.	c

I	c
know	c
how	c
to	c
swim	c
and	c
dive	c
from	c
high	c
places	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
about	c
my	c
experience	c
last	c
month	c
.	c

You	c
know	c
that	c
last	c
month	c
I	c
helped	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
and	c
I	i
've	i
enjoyed	i
it	c
very	c
much	c
.	c

I	c
did	c
many	c
different	c
kinds	c
of	c
things	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
amazing	c
!	c
(	i
the	i
show	i
)	i

I	c
had	c
a	c
really	c
great	c
time	c
working	c
with	c
all	c
the	c
pop	c
singers	c
and	c
dancers	c
and	c
decorators	i
I	i
even	c
met	c
some	c
very	c
interesting	c
people	c
with	c
who	i
made	i
really	c
good	c
friends	c
.	c

What	c
I	c
liked	c
the	c
most	c
was	c
working	c
with	c
the	c
singers	c
,	c
teaching	c
them	c
how	c
to	c
dance	c
and	c
follow	c
some	c
footsteps	i
.	c

This	c
is	i
an	c
experience	c
,	i
I	c
'll	c
never	c
forget	c
.	c

March	c
,	c
2000	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
suggest	c
a	c
special	c
activity	c
while	c
we	c
are	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

The	c
students	c
in	c
my	c
class	c
have	c
just	c
seen	c
the	c
advertisement	c
for	c
a	c
show	c
in	c
today	c
's	c
edition	c
of	c
The	c
Times	c
.	c

There	c
will	c
be	c
The	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
in	c
Central	c
Exhibition	c
Hall	c
on	c
the	c
14th	c
of	c
March	c
.	c

It	c
starts	c
10:00	i
am	c
and	c
finishes	c
9:00	i
p.m	c
.	c

All	c
of	c
my	c
classmates	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
there	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
chance	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
latest	c
fashions	c
,	c
leisure	c
and	c
sports	c
wear	c
,	c
make	i
up	i
and	c
hairstyles	c
.	c

Besides	c
,	c
students	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
to	c
pay	c
entrance	i
fee	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
free	c
for	c
students	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
in	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
famous	c
people	c
,	c
such	c
as	c
politicians	c
and	c
film	c
actors	c
,	c
deserve	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
private	c
life	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
too	c
cruel	c
for	c
them	c
to	c
be	i
monitored	i
their	i
feelings	i
at	c
that	c
time	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr.	c
Robertson	c
,	c

Moreover	c
,	c
we	c
could	c
n't	c
go	c
there	c
without	c
visiting	c
the	c
Science	c
Museum	c
and	c
the	c
National	c
Art	c
Gallery	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
could	c
we	c
make	c
a	c
suggestion	c
?	c

Besides	c
,	c
as	c
there	c
are	c
more	c
girls	c
than	c
boys	c
in	c
the	c
class	c
,	c
they	c
would	c
certainly	c
enjoy	c
attending	c
on	i
live	i
make-up	i
and	i
hairstyles	i
.	c

On	c
the	c
one	c
hand	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
some	c
famous	c
people	c
are	c
looking	c
for	c
the	i
media	c
attention	c
.	c

Indeed	c
,	c
it	c
can	c
be	c
useful	c
for	c
their	c
career	c
.	c

The	c
more	c
they	c
are	c
in	c
the	c
media	c
,	c
the	c
more	c
they	i
will	i
be	i
famous	i
.	c

However	c
,	c
some	c
others	c
only	c
use	c
the	c
media	c
to	c
come	c
back	c
,	c
because	c
they	c
cannot	c
find	c
a	c
job	c
anymore	c
.	c

They	c
need	c
to	c
be	c
famous	c
again	c
.	c

Famous	c
people	c
are	c
so	c
often	c
asked	c
to	c
give	c
interview	i
that	c
the	c
outcome	c
is	c
that	c
they	c
want	c
to	c
be	c
paid	c
for	c
it	c
,	c
either	c
in	c
the	c
newspapers	c
or	c
on	c
television	c
.	c

They	c
cannot	c
go	c
to	c
public	c
places	c
,	c
unless	c
they	c
make-up	i
themselves	c
and	c
they	c
are	c
ready	c
to	c
sign	c
autographs	c
.	c

They	c
would	c
really	c
like	c
a	c
normal	c
life	c
,	c
either	c
because	c
it	i
is	i
their	c
temper	c
,	i
a	i
regarding	i
to	i
their	c
children	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	i
Jane	i
Clark	c

If	c
we	c
will	c
make	i
one	c
reasonably-priced	c
weekend	c
ticket	c
for	c
all	c
events	c
we	c
can	c
make	c
intrestede	i
more	i
people	i
.	c

Afterward	i
we	c
could	c
let	c
people	c
talk	c
with	c
artists	i
so	c
they	c
can	i
get	c
knoe	i
theyr	i
privacy	i
.	c

The	i
first	i
of	c
all	c
it	i
dipends	i
what	c
kind	c
of	c
school	c
it	c
is	c
?	i

Primary	c
,	c
highschool	i
or	c
university	c
!	i

Polish	c
students	c
have	c
to	c
study	c
a	c
lot	c
with	c
books	c
and	c
they	c
have	c
less	i
pracite	i
lessons	c
,	c
sometimes	i
it	c
's	c
hard	c
to	c
get	c
a	i
books	c
or	c
other	c
neaded	i
things	i
to	i
study	i
.	c

Conneat	i
between	c
students	c
and	c
their	c
teachers	c
or	c
principals	c
is	c
very	c
poor	c
!	c

You	c
asking	i
me	c
what	c
would	c
I	c
change	c
?	c

I	c
know	c
that	c
that	i
letter	c
will	c
not	c
change	c
anything	c
but	c
you	c
can	c
see	c
how	c
compliated	i
is	i
Polish	i
studen	i
's	i
life	i

Dear	c
,	i
Helen	c

For	c
accommodation	c
I	c
would	c
rather	i
prefer	c
log	c
cabins	c
because	c
it	i
's	i
more	c
comfortable	c
than	c
tents	c
.	c

And	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
to	c
worry	c
about	c
the	c
weather	c
.	c

Because	c
I	c
'm	c
very	c
good	c
with	i
tennis	c
.	c

I	c
used	c
to	c
play	c
a	c
lot	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
student	c
.	c

Because	c
this	i
's	i
my	c
hobby	c
.	c

So	c
this	i
's	i
will	c
be	c
my	c
first	c
chance	c
that	i
I	i
can	i
use	i
it	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
not	c
sure	c
about	c
the	c
weather	c
in	c
California	c
in	c
the	c
daytime	c
and	c
in	c
the	c
nightime	i
.	c

I	c
hope	c
to	c
hear	c
back	i
from	c
you	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

I	c
'm	c
glad	c
I	c
went	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
feel	c
sad	c
if	c
I	c
did	i
n't	i
go	i
there	c
.	c

And	c
next	i
concert	c
we	c
were	c
promised	c
we	c
'll	c
be	c
there	c
again	c
.	c

Because	c
sometimes	c
you	c
would	i
n't	i
have	i
known	i
the	i
experience	i
until	i
you	i
had	i
done	i
it	i
.	c

Take	c
care	c
and	c
do	c
n't	c
work	c
too	c
hard	c
.	c

Please	c
send	i
my	c
love	c
to	c
your	c
family	c
.	c

Last	c
week	c
I	c
was	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
sorry	c
but	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
have	c
a	c
good	c
remark	i
of	c
your	c
activity	i
when	c
I	c
left	c
.	c

First	i
time	c
,	c
when	c
I	c
saw	c
the	c
advertisement	c
on	i
the	c
newspaper	c
,	c
I	c
really	c
appreciated	i
.	c

But	c
it	c
did	c
n't	c
.	c

Anyway	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
important	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

But	c
it	i
was	c
n't	c
all	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
unpleasent	i
for	c
me	c
to	c
see	c
different	c
actors	c
on	c
the	c
stage	c
.	c

That	c
's	c
why	c
she	c
came	i
across	i
with	i
so	c
many	c
problems	c
.	c

They	c
were	c
best	c
friends	c
.	c

When	c
she	c
came	c
to	c
school	c
,	c
first	i
,	c
we	c
wanted	c
to	c
warn	c
her	c
.	c

I	c
knew	c
her	c
family	c
better	c
than	c
everyone	c
else	c
.	c

Her	c
father	c
never	c
let	c
her	c
to	i
have	i
a	c
boyfriend	c
.	c

Yes	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
a	i
strange	c
behaviour	c
.	c

Days	c
passed	c
.	c

Pat	c
had	c
a	c
boyfriend	c
.	c

She	c
was	c
crying	c
.	c

Because	c
I	c
got	i
used	c
to	c
seeing	c
her	c
every	i
time	i
cheerful	c
and	c
laughing	c
.	c

She	c
asked	c
if	c
we	c
spoke	i
a	c
little	c
bit	c
.	c

We	c
went	c
out	c
and	c
she	c
told	c
me	c
all	c
her	c
story	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
shocked	c
.	c

She	c
had	c
told	c
Pat	c
that	c
her	c
father	c
had	i
n't	i
let	c
them	c
to	i
be	i
friends	c
anymore	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
this	c
letter	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
express	c
my	c
disappointment	c
about	i
your	c
theatre	c
.	c

On	i
the	c
advertisement	c
,	i
that	c
I	c
have	i
received	i
,	c
it	c
was	c
written	c
that	c
the	c
show	c
would	c
start	c
at	c
19:30	c
but	c
I	c
kept	c
wainting	i
for	c
it	c
to	c
start	c
for	c
half	c
an	c
hour	c
.	c

Another	c
disappointing	c
point	c
was	c
that	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
watch	i
Danny	c
Brook	c
so	c
much	c
and	c
it	c
was	c
written	c
that	c
he	c
was	c
acting	c
in	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
but	c
unfortunately	c
the	c
man	c
on	c
the	c
stage	c
was	c
not	c
him	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

On	i
one	i
side	i
it	c
was	c
her	c
best	c
friend	c
who	c
wanted	c
her	c
to	c
keep	c
this	c
secret	c
.	c

But	c
on	i
the	i
other	i
side	i
it	c
was	c
her	c
best	c
friend	c
's	c
family	c
,	i
that	c
she	c
must	c
lie	c
to	c
.	c

She	c
did	c
not	c
trust	c
the	c
boy	c
,	c
and	c
it	c
was	c
very	c
hard	c
for	c
her	c
to	c
lie	c
to	c
people	c
,	i
that	c
she	c
liked	c
so	c
much	c
.	c

She	c
knew	c
she	c
would	c
be	c
very	c
sorry	c
too	c
.	c

So	c
she	c
decided	c
to	c
call	c
the	c
parents	c
of	c
her	c
best	c
friend	c
and	c
tell	c
them	c
what	c
was	c
going	c
on	c
.	c

Of	c
course	c
,	c
her	c
best	c
friend	c
would	c
never	c
trust	c
her	c
again	c
and	c
never	c
share	c
any	c
secrets	c
,	c
but	c
she	c
was	c
doing	c
this	c
for	c
her	c
best	c
friends	i
sake	c
,	c
was	c
n't	c
she	c
?	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
about	c
my	c
complaints	c
of	i
mine	i
about	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
of	i
your	c
theater	i
,	i
that	c
I	c
have	i
watched	i
a	c
week	c
ago	c
,	c
during	c
my	c
stay	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
has	i
started	i
with	i
a	c
delay	c
of	c
45	c
minutes	c
,	c
and	c
because	c
of	c
this	c
all	c
my	c
arrangements	c
for	c
that	c
night	c
were	c
delayed	c
.	c

Another	c
problem	c
was	c
the	c
starring	i
male	i
actor	i
:	c
the	c
well	i
known	i
and	c
talented	c
actor	c
,	i
mentioned	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
was	c
replaced	c
with	i
another	c
one	c
,	c
who	c
was	c
really	c
very	c
disappointing	c
and	c
after	c
the	c
performance	c
,	c
I	c
visited	c
the	c
theater	i
restaurant	c
,	c
which	c
was	c
said	i
to	c
be	c
open	c
and	c
available	c
for	c
meals	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
;	i
but	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
you	c
owe	c
me	c
an	c
excuse	i
and	c
a	c
full	c
refund	c
.	c

Clothes	c
of	c
the	c
Future	c

Have	i
we	i
ever	i
seen	i
a	c
naked	c
person	c
in	c
the	c
streets	c
?	c

Except	c
some	i
very	c
extraordinary	c
cases	c
,	c
no.	c
Tell	c
me	c
,	c
why	c
people	i
care	c
so	c
much	c
about	c
what	c
they	c
wear	c
and	c
what	c
others	c
wear	c
?	c

Because	c
,	i
the	i
clothes	c
have	i
a	c
crucial	c
part	c
in	c
our	c
everyday	c
lives	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
the	c
clothes	c
of	c
the	c
world	c
,	c
after	i
a	c
century	i
,	i
will	c
be	c
styled	c
in	c
the	i
Japanese	c
way	c
:	c
minimalist	c
and	c
naturalist	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
it	c
seems	c
to	c
me	c
that	c
,	i
the	c
clothes	c
of	c
tomorrow	c
will	c
be	c
quite	c
naturalist	i
and	c
minimalist	c
and	c
also	c
,	c
the	c
fabrics	c
that	c
are	c
used	c
will	c
change	c
too	c
.	c

In	c
fact	c
,	c
we	c
can	i
not	i
know	c
,	i
what	c
will	i
the	i
time	i
give	c
and	c
take	c
away	c
,	c
so	c
let	c
's	c
wait	c
and	c
see	c
:	i
the	c
clothes	c
of	c
the	c
future	c
.	c

I	c
appriciated	i
to	i
this	c
big	c
news	c
.	c

First	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
during	c
July	c
.	c

Because	i
my	c
college	c
will	c
finish	c
in	i
the	c
end	c
of	c
June	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
going	c
to	c
go	c
back	c
to	c
Japan	c
in	c
August	c
.	c

Second	c
,	c
I	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
a	i
log	c
cabin	c
.	c

Actually	c
,	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
like	c
tent	i
so	c
much	c
.	c

Therefore	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
interested	c
in	c
staying	c
a	i
log	c
cabin	c
.	c

Also	c
,	c
I	c
belonged	c
to	c
golf	i
club	c
when	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
university	c
in	c
Japan	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

I	c
never	c
feel	c
tired	c
during	c
shopping	c
.	c

I	c
can	c
spend	c
in	i
there	i
all	i
day	i
.	c

To	c
be	c
honest	c
,	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
always	c
buy	c
these	c
products	c
but	i
I	c
can	c
be	c
satisfied	c
with	c
just	c
looking	c
them	i
.	c

Some	c
people	c
does	i
n't	i
like	c
to	c
go	c
shopping	c
with	c
a	c
friend	c
who	c
takes	c
long	i
time	c
to	c
decide	c
.	c

Even	c
in	c
this	c
case	c
,	c
shopping	c
is	c
fun	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
believe	c
there	c
are	c
lot	i
of	c
why	i
to	c
enjoy	c
shopping	c
.	c

But	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
things	i
to	c
enjoy	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
to	c
use	i
every	i
money	i
which	c
you	c
have	c
.	c

It	c
really	c
took	c
me	c
by	c
surprise	c
this	i
prize	c
,	i
I	c
did	c
n't	c
think	c
I	c
would	c
be	c
so	c
lucky	c
to	i
win	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
about	c
your	c
enquires	i
,	c
the	c
only	c
time	c
suitable	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
travel	c
is	c
in	c
July	c
.	c

The	c
reason	c
is	c
that	c
my	c
academic	c
year	c
starts	c
in	c
August	c
therefor	i
I	c
need	c
to	c
be	c
here	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
rather	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
,	i
there	i
's	i
no	c
further	c
reason	c
is	i
just	i
that	c
would	i
be	c
a	c
new	c
experience	c
for	c
me	c
and	c
I	c
'm	c
very	c
excited	c
about	c
it	c
.	c

Finally	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
some	c
questions	c
,	c
there	i
are	c
mainly	c
small	i
details	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
not	c
sure	c
whether	c
I	c
will	c
need	c
some	c
special	c
clothes	c
,	i
if	i
not	c
what	c
sort	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	i
should	i
bring	c
,	c
and	c
also	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
roughly	c
I	i
will	i
need	c
for	c
my	c
daily	c
expenses	c
.	c

Thanks	c
for	c
the	c
wonderful	c
news	c
.	c

My	c
dear	c
friend	c
I	i
hope	c
you	c
are	c
very	c
well	c
and	c
just	c
as	c
happy	c
as	c
I	c
am	c
.	c

The	c
concert	c
was	c
a	c
huge	c
success	c
,	i
lots	i
of	c
people	c
came	c
and	c
enjoyed	c
the	c
music	c
.	c

Especially	c
when	c
the	c
musicians	c
arrived	c
,	i
they	i
can	c
be	c
very	c
demanding	c
people	c
and	c
sometimes	c
they	c
came	i
up	c
with	c
very	c
odd	c
requests	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
once	c
they	c
wanted	c
mineral	c
water	c
of	c
a	c
certain	c
French	c
label	c
,	i
which	c
was	c
impossible	c
to	c
get	c
.	c

My	c
tasks	c
were	c
very	c
especifics	i
.	c

I	c
really	c
enjoyed	c
working	c
with	c
those	c
people	c
,	i
they	i
are	c
all	c
very	c
professional	c
although	c
they	c
may	c
look	c
a	c
bit	c
eccentric	c
sometimes	c
.	c

Another	i
thing	i
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
choose	c
from	c
the	c
activity	c
list	c
is	i
singing	c
(	c
because	c
I	c
take	i
part	i
in	i
a	c
chorus	i
at	c
school	c
)	c
and	c
photography	c
.	c

I	c
wonder	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
send	c
me	c
more	c
information	c
about	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
have	i
we	i
bring	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
be	c
grateful	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
send	c
me	c
a	c
brochure	c
and	c
a	c
map	c
showing	c
where	c
the	c
camp	c
is	c
.	c

thanking	c
you	c
in	c
anticipation	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

In	c
order	c
to	c
celebrate	c
the	c
125	i
aniversary	i
of	c
the	c
city	c
,	c
the	c
Coun	i
Council	c
organised	c
an	c
open	c
air	c
concert	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
summer	c
night	c
and	c
all	c
the	c
citizens	c
,	c
as	c
well	c
as	c
tourists	c
,	c
had	c
the	c
opportunity	c
to	c
attend	c
.	c

K.	c
if	i
you	c
want	c
to	c
help	c
,	c
here	c
is	c
a	c
list	c
of	c
what	c
you	c
can	c
do.	c
"	c

My	c
job	c
was	c
to	c
leave	c
some	c
leaflets	c
on	i
shops	c
,	c
restaurants	c
and	c
streets	i
.	c

Working	c
with	c
this	c
band	c
was	c
an	c
experience	c
I	c
will	c
never	c
forget	c
.	c

What	c
I	c
really	c
enjoyed	c
was	c
been	i
part	c
of	c
the	c
staff	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
arrangements	c
for	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
spending	c
some	c
days	c
in	c
London	c
and	c
enjoyed	i
a	i
lot	i
the	i
idea	i
of	i
seeing	i
this	i
show	i
.	c

We	c
got	c
really	c
upset	c
when	c
we	c
realized	c
he	c
was	i
being	i
substituted	c
.	c

Besides	c
the	c
boredom	c
of	c
having	c
waited	i
for	c
forty-five	c
minutes	c
,	c
we	c
were	c
not	c
allowed	c
to	c
visit	c
the	c
restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
since	c
it	c
was	c
already	c
closed	c
by	c
the	c
time	c
the	c
show	c
finished	c
.	c

As	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
our	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
,	c
as	c
you	c
suggested	i
in	c
your	c
advertisement	c
,	c
we	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
if	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
possible	c
for	c
us	c
to	c
get	c
a	c
refund	c
.	c

Its	c
name	c
is	c
"	c
Best	c
Detective	c
Stories	c
of	c
Agatha	c
Christie	c
"	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
really	c
got	i
impressioned	i
with	c
the	c
coherence	c
of	c
the	c
stories	c
.	c

I	c
thought	c
about	c
you	c
while	c
reading	c
the	c
book	c
because	c
I	c
remembered	c
you	c
have	c
booked	c
a	c
place	c
in	i
a	c
Detective	c
course	c
.	c

Agatha	c
Christies	i
stories	c
are	c
simple	c
,	c
but	c
very	c
well	c
written	c
,	c
and	c
,	c
as	c
I	c
told	c
you	c
,	c
very	c
coherent	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
estimulating	i
to	c
read	c
them	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
sure	c
that	c
if	c
you	c
listen	c
to	c
it	c
you	c
will	c
start	c
reading	c
the	c
book	c
immediately	c
,	c
and	c
find	c
out	c
there	c
many	i
challenges	c
for	i
your	c
new	c
carreer	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
congratulate	c
you	c
for	i
the	c
excellent	c
programme	c
that	c
you	c
have	c
prepared	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
is	i
such	c
a	c
good	c
programme	c
especially	i
because	c
the	c
places	c
that	c
we	c
visit	c
,	c
like	c
the	c
Science	c
Museum	c
,	c
are	c
very	c
interesting	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
the	c
rest	c
of	c
the	c
students	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
heard	c
about	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
show	c
that	c
will	c
be	c
celebrated	c
at	c
the	c
Central	c
Exhibition	c
Hall	c
in	c
London	c
where	i
the	c
latest	c
fashions	c
will	c
be	c
shown	c
.	c

And	c
it	c
has	c
free-entrance	i
for	c
the	i
students	c
.	c

We	c
think	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
because	c
it	c
will	c
take	c
place	c
while	i
our	c
visit	c
to	c
London	c
,	c
the	i
14th	c
of	c
March	c
.	c

We	c
think	c
that	c
,	c
if	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
any	c
problem	c
,	c
we	c
could	c
visit	c
the	c
Science	c
Museum	c
on	c
Wednesday	c
after	c
visiting	c
the	c
National	c
Art	c
Gallery	c
so	c
that	c
we	c
can	i
go	c
to	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
show	c
.	c

We	c
are	c
wating	i
for	c
your	c
decision	c
and	c
we	c
will	c
accept	c
it	c
whatever	c
it	c
be	i
.	c

From	i
any	i
point	i
of	i
view	i
,	c
the	c
home	c
of	c
the	c
future	c
will	c
be	c
very	c
similar	c
to	c
the	c
homes	c
that	c
we	c
have	c
today	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
it	c
will	c
has	i
a	c
similar	c
structure	c
but	c
it	c
will	c
include	c
some	c
new	c
technological	c
advantages	c
like	c
having	c
all	c
the	c
house	c
controlled	c
by	c
a	c
computer	c
so	c
that	c
,	c
for	c
example	c
,	c
we	c
can	c
turn	c
on	c
the	c
lights	c
of	i
the	c
bedroom	c
just	c
pressing	i
a	c
button	c
while	c
we	c
are	c
watching	c
the	c
TV	c
sitting	c
on	c
the	c
sofa	c
.	c

Although	c
many	c
people	c
think	c
that	c
the	c
home	c
of	c
the	c
future	c
will	c
be	c
something	c
like	c
an	i
UFO	c
,	c
in	c
my	c
opinion	c
the	c
changes	c
wo	c
n't	c
be	c
very	c
important	i
,	c
they	c
will	c
probably	c
consist	c
on	i
making	c
the	c
houseworks	i
easier	c
.	c

The	c
cleanest	i
example	c
is	c
to	c
compare	c
a	c
house	c
from	c
the	c
beginings	i
of	c
the	c
20th	c
century	c
with	c
our	c
house	i
Both	i
are	c
very	c
similar	c
but	c
now	c
we	c
have	c
new	c
technologies	c
.	c

In	i
balance	c
then	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
the	c
houses	c
that	c
we	c
can	i
see	c
on	i
films	c
wo	c
n't	c
really	c
exist	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
the	c
prize	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
to	i
the	c
trip	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
my	c
school	c
,	c
which	c
is	c
Berkeley	c
International	c
School	c
,	c
is	c
going	c
to	c
arrange	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
term	c
break	c
both	c
for	c
staff	c
and	c
students	c
.	c

Other	i
reason	c
is	c
I	i
think	c
in	c
July	c
the	c
weather	c
is	c
not	c
so	c
cold	c
.	c

I	c
prefer	c
to	c
live	i
in	c
tents	c
to	i
log	c
cabin	c
because	c
sleeping	c
in	c
the	i
tent	c
makes	c
me	c
more	c
comfortable	c
and	c
I	c
can	c
get	c
closer	c
to	c
the	i
nature	c
.	c

Every	c
night	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
come	i
out	c
of	c
the	c
small	c
tent	c
to	i
the	c
nice	c
enviroment	i
outside	c
the	c
tent	c
.	c

I	c
'll	c
have	c
to	c
be	c
aware	i
about	c
insects	c
so	c
I	c
've	c
bought	c
so	c
many	c
insects	i
repellant	i
.	c

I	c
can	c
choose	c
to	c
do	c
2	c
activities	c
so	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
play	c
tennis	c
and	c
swimming	i
.	c

It	c
will	i
be	c
very	c
kind	c
of	c
you	c
,	i
if	c
you	c
can	i
answer	c
my	c
questions	c
.	c

Your	i
sincerely	c
,	c

I	c
've	c
been	c
asked	c
to	c
help	i
by	i
the	c
well	i
known	i
band	c
called	i
Westlife	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
to	c
keep	c
things	c
in	c
place	c
and	c
cheakd	i
that	c
the	c
microphones	c
was	i
working	c
properly	c
.	c

I	c
really	c
want	c
to	c
have	c
that	c
experience	c
again	c
.	c

That	c
is	c
my	c
story	c
.	c

Tell	c
me	c
yoors	i
.	c

I	c
want	c
to	c
know	c
what	c
experience	i
you	i
've	i
had	i
when	c
you	c
were	c
in	c
England	c
.	c

Best	c
wishes	c
,	c

Most	c
of	c
the	c
shows	c
are	c
about	c
fashinable	i
things	c
for	c
the	i
students	c
in	i
my	c
age	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
good	c
programme	i
and	c
suitable	c
for	c
all	c
of	c
us	c
because	c
there	c
are	c
many	c
different	c
kinds	c
of	c
the	i
shows	i
for	i
instance	c
latest	i
fashions	c
,	c
leisure	c
and	c
sports	c
wear	c
,	c
how	c
to	c
make	i
up	i
and	c
how	c
to	c
have	i
propiate	i
hairstyles	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opionion	i
,	c
I	c
think	c
you	c
should	c
organised	i
this	c
programme	i
in	c
the	c
afternoon	c
instead	c
of	c
going	c
for	i
shopping	c
and	c
move	c
the	c
shoping	i
time	i
in	i
the	c
afternoon	c
on	c
Wednesday	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
this	c
information	c
will	c
help	c
you	i
to	i
understand	i
and	c
put	i
it	c
in	c
your	c
programme	c
.	c

I	c
trust	c
you	c
to	c
pay	c
immidiate	i
attention	c
to	c
my	c
suggestions	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
given	c
the	c
lists	i
for	i
doing	i
the	i
activities	c
while	c
I	c
was	c
going	i
to	i
the	c
adventurous	i
school	c
schems	i
at	c
the	c
solder	i
camps	c
in	c
the	c
north	c
of	c
Thailand	c
.	c

There	c
were	c
many	c
tasks	c
that	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
complete	c
for	i
instance	c
,	c
clime	i
up	i
to	i
the	c
mountain	c
,	c
how	i
to	c
used	i
some	i
kind	i
of	c
guns	i
,	c
and	c
how	c
to	c
survive	c
when	i
I	c
got	c
lost	c
in	c
the	i

The	c
last	c
task	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
was	c
jume	i
out	c
of	c
the	c
hight	i
tower	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
just	c
received	c
your	c
letter	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
happy	c
about	c
this	c
.	c

Thanks	c
very	c
much	c
!	c

It	c
will	c
be	c
very	c
nice	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
interested	c
in	c
both	c
places	i
but	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
just	c
choose	c
one	c
place	i
,	i
I	c
think	c
I	c
will	c
choose	c
log	c
cabins	c
,	i
it	i
's	i
sounds	i
good	c
and	c
if	c
I	c
have	c
time	c
,	c
maybe	c
I	c
can	c
go	i
to	i
tents	c
next	c
time	c
(	c
maybe	c
next	c
year	c
.	i
)	i

Maybe	c
TITANIC	c
.	c

My	c
mum	i
liked	i
me	c
singing	c
this	c
song	c
.	c

Another	c
thing	c
is	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
some	c
questions	c
about	c
journey	i
,	i
What	c
's	c
the	c
weather	c
like	c
?	c

What	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
shall	c
I	c
take	c
?	c
and	i
how	c
much	c
does	c
it	c
cost	c
per	c
night	c
live	i
in	c
a	c
Hotel	c
?	c

Thanks	c
for	c
your	c
help	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c

A	c
lot	c
of	c
people	c
enjoy	c
shopping	c
very	c
much	c
,	i
me	i
too	c
.	c

And	i
then	i
,	i
you	i
may	i
save	i
money	i
for	i
the	i
things	i
you	i
like	i
,	i
nothing	i
to	i
do	i
,	i
just	i
for	i
the	i
poor	i
things	i
what	i
you	i
like	i
so	i
funny	c
is	i
n't	c
it	c
?	c

Another	c
thing	c
is	c
when	c
you	c
shopping	i
in	i
a	c
busy	c
street	c
,	c
seem	i
like	c
oxford	i
st	i
in	c
London	c
.	i

a	c
lot	c
of	c
thief	i
there	i
,	i
they	i
will	c
steal	c
you	i
money	c
,	i
that	i
's	i
so	c
dangerous	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
in	c
my	c
opinion	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
really	c
enjoyable	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

But	c
now	c
I	c
am	c
thinking	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
waste	c
of	c
time	c
.	c

Suprisingly	i
the	c
show	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
,	i
all	c
of	c
these	c
disappointments	c
are	c
too	c
much	c
for	c
one	c
evening	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
why	c
I	c
told	i
this	i
to	i
Pat	i
.	c

Yesterday	c
Larry	c
suggested	c
going	c
to	c
cinema	i
after	c
school	c
.	c

Going	c
to	c
cinema	i
with	c
the	c
boy	c
I	c
love	c
.	c

Of	c
course	c
I	c
accepted	c
immidiately	i
.	c

I	c
suddenly	c
remembered	c
that	c
I	c
promised	i
Pat	c
to	i
help	i
her	c
with	c
her	c
history	c
homework	c
.	c

Do	c
n't	c
forget	c
bringing	i
your	c
history	c
books.	c
"	c

Then	c
I	c
explained	c
what	c
has	i
happened	c
that	c
morning	c
.	c

She	c
was	i
about	i
to	i
cry	c
.	c

After	c
hearing	c
this	c
,	c
I	c
told	c
her	c
that	c
I	c
am	c
deeply	c
in	c
love	c
with	c
Larry	c
.	c

I	c
told	c
her	c
not	c
to	c
tell	c
this	i
anyone	i
.	c

She	c
said	c
OK	c
angrily	c
.	c

When	c
they	c
asked	c
me	c
the	c
reason	c
I	c
told	c
that	i
I	c
promised	c
my	c
Mom	c
to	c
be	i
with	c
her	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
closed	c
my	c
bedroom	i
's	i
door	c
I	c
burst	c
into	c
tears	c
.	c

Next	c
morning	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
school	c
again	c
.	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
'm	c
very	c
surprise	i
,	i
to	c
won	i
this	c
prize	c
.	c

About	c
the	c
accommodation	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
I	i
will	i
prefer	c
tents	c
because	c
I	c
like	c
the	c
nature	i
and	c
I	c
like	c
to	c
listen	c
the	i
birds	c
.	c

My	c
level	c
in	c
this	i
two	c
activities	c
is	c
medium	c
,	i
I	c
never	c
practise	i
them	c
all	i
.	c

How	c
many	i
money	c
take	i
us	i
?	c
or	i
is	i
necessary	c
?	c

It	i
's	i
necessary	c
for	i
the	i
activities	i
to	i
wear	i
special	i
clothes	i
?	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

When	c
we	c
arrived	c
to	i
the	c
shopping	c
center	i
,	c
I	c
saw	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
people	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
understand	c
why	c
they	i
was	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
people	c
.	c

We	c
asked	c
them	c
if	c
someone	i
of	c
them	c
help	i
us	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
a	c
girl	i
very	i
friendly	i
came	c
with	c
us	c
.	c

But	c
not	i
always	i
it	i
's	i
the	c
same	c
history	i
because	c
I	c
like	c
shopping	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
I	c
'm	c
enjoy	i
.	c

Dear	c
Mr.	c
Robertson	c
,	c

Based	c
on	c
this	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
suggest	c
minor	c
changes	c
in	i
the	c
fabulous	c
Programme	c
you	c
have	c
offered	c
.	c

These	c
changes	c
will	c
not	c
affect	c
the	c
contacts	i
of	c
the	c
programme	c
itself	c
.	c

Nowadays	c
I	c
remember	c
those	c
exciting	c
days	c
in	c
which	c
danger	c
is	i
knocking	c
at	c
your	c
door	c
every	c
day	c
.	c

Of	c
course	c
we	c
had	c
n't	c
got	c
enough	c
points	c
in	c
the	c
test	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
so	i
.	c

This	c
way	c
we	c
could	c
obtain	c
seldom	i
places	c
at	c
NASA	c
university	c
.	c

The	c
task	c
was	c
not	c
easy	c
,	c
with	i
18	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
too	c
much	c
about	c
cryptographic	c
algoritms	i
and	c
databases	c
but	c
anyway	c
we	c
decided	c
to	c
do	c
it	i
there	i
was	c
nothing	c
to	c
lose	c
.	c

It	c
took	c
us	c
two	c
weeks	c
to	c
modify	c
the	c
results	c
in	c
a	c
very	c
complex	c
operation	c
in	c
which	c
we	c
should	c
take	c
care	c
of	c
hiding	i
all	c
our	c
fingerprints	c
.	c

The	c
operation	i
was	c
successful	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
confirm	c
that	c
we	c
have	c
received	c
your	c
programme	c
for	c
our	c
class	c
for	c
the	c
three	c
days	c
,	i
during	i
our	c
stay	c
in	c
London	c
,	i
and	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
.	c

As	i
we	i
have	c
been	c
told	c
,	i
there	c
are	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
interesting	c
paintings	c
and	c
ancient	c
sculptures	c
in	i
which	c
we	c
all	i
are	i
keen	c
to	c
see	c
it	i
.	c

At	c
the	c
same	c
time	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
for	c
most	c
of	c
us	c
because	c
we	c
are	c
going	c
to	c
study	c
"	c
Art	c
and	c
Design	c
"	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

We	c
would	c
be	c
grateful	c
,	i
if	c
you	c
could	c
consider	c
our	c
suggestion	c
and	c
hope	c
to	c
hearing	i
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

Well	c
,	c
first	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
's	c
quite	c
difficult	c
to	c
be	c
a	c
musician	c
,	c
film	c
star	c
or	c
a	c
politician	c
without	c
being	c
followed	c
by	c
journalists	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
Lady	i
Diana	c
.	c

Do	c
you	c
think	c
she	c
would	i
have	i
been	i
still	i
alive	c
if	c
she	c
and	c
her	c
boyfriend	c
had	c
n't	c
been	c
followed	c
by	c
these	i
nosy	c
paparazzis	i
?	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
go	i
to	c
Camp	c
California	c
in	c
the	c
USA	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
further	c
information	c
.	c

About	c
accommodation	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
tents	i
because	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
a	c
new	c
experience	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
like	c
to	c
get	i
new	c
experiences	c
specially	i
when	c
I	c
am	c
on	c
holiday	c
.	c

Will	c
the	i
Camp	c
California	c
provide	c
the	c
clothes	c
for	c
swimming	c
and	c
play	i
tennis	c
?	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
understand	c
why	c
men	c
do	c
n't	c
like	c
shopping	c
at	i
least	c
they	c
say	c
that	c
.	i

Sometimes	c
you	c
go	c
out	c
and	c
you	c
ca	c
n't	c
find	c
something	c
special	c
or	c
there	c
are	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
people	c
there	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
boring	i
.	c

You	c
should	c
n't	c
go	c
shopping	c
when	c
the	c
shopps	i
are	c
so	c
busy	c
because	c
its	i
so	c
boring	i
.	c

You	c
can	c
buy	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
products	c
by	i
Internet	i
.	c

Two	c
weeks	c
ago	c
,	c
I	c
came	c
to	c
London	c
for	c
a	c
week	c
's	c
holiday	c
.	c

The	c
problems	c
started	c
when	c
we	c
arrived	c
at	c
the	c
Theatre	c
:	c
my	c
6	i
year	i
old	i
son	c
had	c
to	c
pay	c
full	i
price	c
.	c

And	c
last	c
,	c
at	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
the	c
program	i
,	c
we	c
would	c
like	i
to	c
have	c
a	c
drink	c
in	c
the	c
theatre	c
Restaurant	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
already	c
closed	c
due	c
to	c
the	c
poor	c
attendance	c
.	c

As	c
this	c
evening	c
was	c
for	c
my	c
family	c
and	c
I	i
a	c
wasted	c
one	c
,	c
I	c
permit	c
myself	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
for	c
refund	i
.	c

There	i
is	i
no	i
need	i
to	i
be	i
a	i
genious	i
to	c
notice	c
that	c
technology	c
has	c
evoluated	i
so	c
considerably	c
during	c
the	c
last	c
decades	i
that	c
our	c
everyday	c
life	c
has	c
changed	c
.	c

From	c
my	c
point	c
of	c
view	c
,	c
modern	c
technology	c
has	c
first	i
permit	i
to	i
me	c
to	c
find	c
a	c
job	c
as	c
I	c
work	c
as	c
a	c
computer	c
engineer	c
.	c

In	c
this	c
domain	c
,	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
afford	i
everyday	i
the	i
development	c
of	c
new	c
technology	c
.	c

And	c
as	c
new	c
discoveries	c
bring	c
new	c
discoveries	c
,	c
progress	c
is	c
going	c
faster	c
and	c
faster	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
new	c
technology	c
have	i
a	c
great	c
influence	c
on	c
my	c
life	c
as	c
it	c
permits	c
me	c
to	c
live	c
on	c
.	c

But	c
,	c
who	c
knows	c
,	c
may	c
be	c
one	c
day	c
I	c
will	c
develop	c
technology	i
that	c
will	c
send	c
me	c
right	i
to	c
the	c
unemployment	c
office	c

Dear	c
Mrs.	c
Ryan	c
,	c

The	c
former	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
an	c
excellent	c
basketball-player	i
and	c
the	c
latter	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
interested	c
in	c
taking	c
up	c
a	c
new	c
sport	c
as	i
I	c
am	c
a	c
complete	c
beginner	c
at	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

After	c
our	c
English	c
class	i
'	i
decision	c
to	c
make	c
a	c
short	c
film	c
about	c
daily	c
life	c
in	c
my	c
school	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
asked	c
to	c
write	c
a	c
report	c
about	c
interesting	c
lessons	c
and	c
activities	c
that	c
should	c
be	c
filmed	c
.	c

Here	c
are	c
my	c
findings	c
.	c

Best	c
lessons	c
to	c
film	c

As	c
all	c
the	c
students	c
are	c
different	c
from	c
each	c
other	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
essential	c
to	c
show	c
many	c
aspects	c
of	c
the	c
school	c
.	c

Therefore	c
,	c
to	c
show	c
the	c
good	c
aspects	c
,	c
I	c
suggest	c
to	i
film	i
Mr.	c
Clark	c
's	c
English	c
classes	c
,	c
because	c
they	c
are	c
highly	c
educative	i
and	c
because	c
the	c
students	c
participate	c
a	c
lot	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
to	c
show	c
less	c
pleasing	c
aspects	c
,	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
adequate	i
to	c
film	c
Mrs.	c
Morrison	c
's	c
French	c
classes	c
,	c
as	c
they	c
are	c
extremely	c
boring	c
and	c
sub-standard	c
.	c

Another	c
event	c
that	c
should	c
absolutely	i
be	c
captured	c
on	c
film	c
is	c
the	c
preparation	c
of	c
the	c
meals	c
in	c
the	c
canteen	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
just	c
seen	c
the	c
letter	c
this	c
morning	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
happy	c
for	i
win	i
the	c
competition	c
.	c

I	c
believe	c
I	c
have	c
the	c
appropriate	c
qualification	i
to	c
stay	c
two	c
weeks	c
at	c
camp	c
California	c
.	c

Althoug	i
I	i
wich	i
that	i
my	i
accommodation	i
at	i
Camp	i
California	i
it	i
must	i
be	i
in	c
tents	i
.	c

I	c
get	i
experience	c
in	i
the	i
last	c
summer	c
.	c

Because	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
prepare	c
all	c
my	c
staf	i
and	c
I	c
am	c
sure	c
it	c
would	i
be	c
a	c
great	c
experience	c
despite	c
the	i
cost	i
of	i
living	i
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

Sorry	c
about	c
my	c
last	c
mail	i
but	c
I	c
've	c
been	c
traveled	i
.	c

Anyway	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
fantastic	i
you	i
ca	c
n't	c
imagine	c
how	i
was	i
the	i
concert	i
like	c
?	c

So	c
keep	c
in	c
touch	c
.	c

I	c
liked	c
the	c
plays	c
and	c
the	c
films	c
most	c
.	c

And	c
the	c
concerts	c
were	c
also	c
excellent	c
.	c

Especially	i
,	c
I	c
enjoyed	c
the	c
jazz	c
concerts	c
and	c
could	c
see	c
some	c
famous	c
jazz	c
musicians	c
I	c
adore	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
found	i
some	c
things	c
which	c
I	c
think	c
I	c
should	c
point	c
out	c
.	c

To	c
make	c
it	c
more	c
enjoyable	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
be	c
grateful	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
welcome	i
my	c
comments	c
on	i
it	c

A	c
Japanese	c
folk	c
story	c
"	i
a	i
bamboo	i
princess	i
"	c

There	c
was	c
an	c
old	c
married	c
couple	c
.	c

One	c
day	c
,	c
the	c
lady	c
went	c
to	c
a	c
river	c
to	c
wash	c
clothes	i
and	c
the	c
man	c
went	c
to	c
a	c
mountain	c
to	c
cut	c
trees	c
.	c

In	c
a	c
bamboo	c
forest	c
,	c
he	c
found	c
a	c
shining	c
bamboo	i

She	c
was	c
named	c
bamboo	i
princess	c
.	c

The	c
princess	c
grew	c
up	c
beautifully	i
.	c

When	c
they	c
asked	c
her	c
,	i
she	c
said	c
"	i
I	c
am	c
from	c
the	c
moon	c
and	c
I	c
will	c
have	c
to	c
go	c

Dear	c
Mrs.	c
Ryan	c
,	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
the	c
letter	c
which	c
brought	c
me	c
such	c
good	c
news	c
.	c

I	c
enjoyed	c
a	c
lot	c
participating	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
and	c
hope	c
to	c
apreciate	i
the	c
travel	i
I	c
won	i
.	c

To	c
be	c
honest	c
,	c
the	c
only	c
suitable	c
time	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
travel	c
is	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
my	c
session	c
at	c
the	c
University	c
will	c
have	c
finished	c
only	c
in	i
the	c
end	c
of	c
June	c
.	c

As	i
an	i
accommodation	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
I	c
prefer	c
a	c
tent	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
doing	i
camping	c
for	c
years	c
and	c
enjoy	c
it	c
very	c
much	c
.	c

Lena	c
Kazanova	c

Eternal	c
crowds	c
,	c
high	c
prices	c
,	c
long	c
hours	c
of	c
choosing	c
a	c
suitable	c
thing	c
,	c
that	c
is	c
what	c
shopping	c
means	c
to	c
me	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
am	c
on	c
my	c
own	c
,	c
everything	c
is	c
fine	c
:	c
I	c
do	c
my	c
shopping	c
quickly	c
because	c
I	c
never	c
have	c
to	c
spend	c
hours	c
to	i
choose	i
what	c
I	c
really	c
want	c
either	c
for	c
myself	c
or	c
someone	c
else	c
.	c

Some	c
go	c
just	c
to	c
kill	i
the	i
time	i
others	i
-	i
to	c
look	c
at	c
something	c
new	c
,	i
I	c
am	c
in	c
the	c
third	c
group	c
-	c
previously	i
I	c
think	c
of	c
what	c
I	c
will	c
buy	c
and	c
go	c
straight	c
to	c
the	c
department	c
I	c
need	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
you	c
should	c
invite	c
from	i
ten	c
countries	c
because	c
there	c
are	c
more	c
and	c
more	c
stars	c
and	c
artists	c
in	c
the	c
world	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
invite	i
from	i
more	i
countries	i
to	i
stars	i
and	i
artist	i
,	c
your	c
festival	c
will	c
be	c
unbelieved	i
.	c

Because	c
of	c
these	i
,	c
people	c
are	c
bored	c
quickly	c
.	c

You	c
show	c
plays	c
and	c
films	c
.	c

That	c
's	c
the	i
real	c
knowledge	c
for	c
us	c
,	c
art	c
exhibition	i
and	c
talks	c
by	c
writers	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
we	c
know	i
a	c
writer	i
life	c
or	c
how	c
is	i
he	i
writing	c
it	i
?	i
it	i
's	i
very	i
significant	c
thing	c
.	c

Lastly	c
,	c
you	c
said	c
'	c
one	c
reasonable-priced	i
weekend	c
ticket	c
for	c
all	c
events	c
'	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
excellent	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
can	c
pay	c
attention	c
to	c
my	c
small	c
suggestion	c
,	c
next	c
year	c
I	c
hope	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
unbelievable	i
festival	c
.	c

Dear	c
Edmond	c

I	c
miss	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
and	c
sorry	c
about	i
did	i
n't	i
write	i
you	c
some	i
letters	c
.	c

However	c
;	i
today	c
I	c
used	i
to	c
my	c
school	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
got	i
two	c
sweet	c
girls	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
very	c
boring	c
.	c

For	c
instance	c
;	i
you	c
must	c
not	c
argue	c
with	c
your	c
friend	c
or	c
you	c
must	c
not	c
argue	c
with	c
workers	c
.	c

The	c
most	c
significant	c
rule	c
is	c
you	c
must	c
not	c
smoke	c
in	c
public	c
places	c
,	c
or	c
in	c
the	c
toilet	c
.	c

Are	i
you	c
understand	c
me	c
?	c

Please	c
you	i
will	i
write	c
me	c
a	c
letter	c
quickly	c
.	c

Lovers	i
!	c

I	c
looked	c
forward	c
a	i
perfect	c
evening	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
the	c
most	c
disappointing	c
one	c
I	c
have	c
ever	c
had	c
.	c

The	c
advertisement	c
of	i
the	c
musical	c
said	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	i
unfortunately	i
there	c
was	c
someone	c
else	c
-	c
an	c
actor	c
which	i
I	c
do	c
not	c
like	c
and	c
if	c
I	c
have	i
known	c
that	c
he	c
was	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
I	i
woud	i
not	c
have	c
come	i
to	c
see	c
him	c
.	c

Forty	i
five	i
minutes	c
later	c
!	c

Keeping	c
in	c
mind	c
all	c
these	c
arguments	i
,	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
for	c
some	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

It	c
affects	c
our	c
lifes	i
,	i
my	i
too	c
.	c

In	c
fact	c
modern	i
technology	c
was	c
already	c
very	c
popular	c
and	c
comonly	i
used	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
born	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
cannot	c
say	c
that	c
it	c
changed	c
my	c
life	c
rapidly	i
.	c

All	c
these	c
products	c
of	c
science	c
are	c
with	c
me	c
since	i
the	c
very	c
beging	i
of	c
my	c
day	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
I	i
am	c
woken	c
up	c
by	c
my	c
electronic	c
alarm-clock	c
,	c
then	c
I	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
bathroom	c
and	c
there	c
is	c
hot	c
and	c
cold	c
water	c
,	i
next	i
I	c
eat	c
my	c
breakfast	c
and	c
listen	c
to	c
the	c
radio	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
aware	c
of	c
all	c
these	i
disadvantages	c
of	c
the	i
modern	c
technology	c
;	c
pollution	c
and	c
dangarous	i
it	c
brings	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
we	c
cannot	c
talk	c
only	c
about	c
changes	i
which	c
the	i
modern	c
technology	c
has	c
brought	c
to	c
our	c
lives	c
.	c

That	c
's	c
because	c
that	i
I	c
think	c
that	c
we	c
are	c
the	c
one	i
who	c
change	c
the	c
technology	c
as	c
well	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
our	c
lives	c
are	c
lives	c
with	c
technology	c
,	i
they	i
sometimes	c
mean	i
the	i
same	i
as	i
science	i
and	i
affects	i
not	i
on	i
at	i
each	i
other	i
but	i
together	i
.	c

So	c
how	c
has	c
the	i
modern	c
technology	c
changed	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
?	c

This	c
would	c
be	c
an	c
ideal	c
opportunity	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
visit	c
the	c
United	c
States	c
to	c
learn	c
the	i
American	c
way	c
of	c
life	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
'd	c
like	i
to	i
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
tents	c
,	i
that	i
would	c
be	c
the	c
first	c
chance	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
sleep	c
on	c
the	c
outskirts	c
of	c
California	c
.	c

It	c
could	c
be	c
very	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

And	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
choose	c
my	i
activities	c
Golf	c
and	c
painting	c
.	c

I	c
used	c
to	c
play	c
Golf	c
several	c
years	c
and	i
I	c
like	c
to	c
paint	c
the	i
composition	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
the	c
annual	c
international	c
arts	c
festival	c
which	c
was	c
organized	c
on	c
21st-22nd	c
November	c
.	c

I	c
had	i
spent	i
at	i
this	i
festival	i
for	i
two	i
days	i
.	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
great	c
idea	c
to	c
organize	c
such	c
festival	i
.	c

I	c
enjoyed	c
dance	i
shows	c
,	c
jazz	i
and	c
rock	c
concerts	c
.	c

There	c
were	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
nice	c
pictures	c
,	c
sculptures	c
and	c
other	c
creative	c
works	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
your	c
answer	c

There	c
are	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
folk	c
stories	c
in	i
the	c
world	c
and	c
there	c
are	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
folk	c
stories	c
in	c
Estonia	c
,	i
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
one	c
of	c
them	c
.	c

This	c
story	c
is	c
about	c
a	c
man	c
and	c
his	c
three	c
sons	c
.	c

This	c
story	c
happened	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
ago	c
.	c

The	c
man	c
was	c
old	c
and	c
his	c
sons	c
were	c
young	c
.	c

They	c
decided	c
to	c
return	c
to	c
his	i
father	c
because	c
he	c
was	c
old	c
and	c
he	c
needed	c
help	c

When	c
the	c
sons	c
were	c
old	c
they	c
began	c
to	c

about	c
their	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
on	i
July	c
because	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
on	c
winter	i
holidays	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
will	c
not	c
miss	c
classes	c
at	c
school	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
really	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
tents	i
because	c
I	c
love	c
sleeping	c
outdoors	c
and	c
listening	c
noises	i
from	c
outside	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
wondering	c
the	i
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
that	c
I	c
will	c
have	c
to	c
wear	c
and	c
finally	c
could	c
you	c
tell	c
me	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
will	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
?	c

I	c
was	c
promised	c
that	c
the	c
starring	i
was	c
Danny	c
Brock	c
but	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
there	c
I	c
saw	c
just	i
other	i
starring	i
that	c
was	c
completely	c
difference	i
from	c
your	i
brochar	i
.	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
hungry	c
and	c
tired	c
.	c

You	c
said	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
like	c
that	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
you	c
to	c
give	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
as	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c

Personally	c

About	c

I	c
would	c

I	c
enjoy	c
the	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c

Sometimes	c
shopping	c
can	c
be	c
a	c
stressing	i
experience	c
though	c
people	c
think	c
of	c
it	c
as	c
an	c
enjoyable	c
part	c
of	c
their	c
lives	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
shopping	c
can	c
be	c
a	c
good	c
thing	c
if	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
possibility	i
to	c
forget	c
about	c
all	c
the	c
problems	c
you	c
have	c
,	c
even	c
if	c
it	c
is	c
just	c
for	c
a	c
moment	c
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
like	c
all	c
things	c
in	c
life	c
,	c
shopping	c
can	c
be	c
pleasent	i
or	c
irritating	c
depending	c
on	c
your	c
patience	c
and	c
on	c
your	c
mood	c
that	c
day	c
.	c

I	c
recived	i
your	c
letter	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
excited	c
about	c
the	c
camp	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
in	c
July	c
I	i
do	c
n't	c
mind	c
wich	i
two	c
weeks	c
but	i
it	c
has	c
to	c
be	c
that	c
month	c
because	c
in	c
June	c
I	c
still	i
in	c
school	c
and	c
in	c
August	c
I'am	i
going	c
on	c
holiday	c
with	c
my	c
family	c
.	c

One	c
of	c
the	c
activities	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
do	c
is	c
Climbing	c
,	i
I	c
have	c
n't	c
done	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
it	c
but	c
I	c
've	c
always	c
found	c
it	c
interesting	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
this	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
good	c
opportunity	c
to	c
become	c
better	c
in	i
it	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
what	c
type	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
should	c
take	c
and	c
also	c
if	c
I	c
need	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

Well	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
go	c
now	c
.	c

Hope	c
to	c
hear	c
from	c
you	c
later	c
on	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
on	i
July	c
because	c
this	c
is	c
the	c
only	c
month	c
given	i
to	c
me	c
by	c
my	c
employer	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
because	c
I	c
can	i
not	i
sleep	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
(	c
it	c
is	c
too	c
hot	c
and	c
the	c
floor	c
is	c
too	c
hard	c
for	c
my	c
back	c
)	c
.	c

Concerning	c
the	c
two	c
activities	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
choose	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
swim	c
and	c
play	c
tennis	c
(	c
I	c
have	c
a	c
good	c
level	c
in	i
each	c
sports	i
)	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

Besides	c
it	c
gives	i
all	c
the	c
areas	c
covered	c
by	c
a	c
mecanic	i
ingenier	i
and	c
it	c
is	c
very	c
important	c
in	c
a	c
school	c
where	c
you	c
will	c
probably	c
become	c
a	c
mecanic	i
ingenier	i
It	i
lets	c
us	c
specify	i
our	c
abilities	c
in	i
the	c
part	c
of	c
mecanics	i
that	c
we	c
prefer	c
.	c

Third	c
,	c
you	c
need	c
to	c
know	c
which	c
sport	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
to	i
practise	i
.	c

In	c
photography	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
just	c
a	c
novice	c
,	c
nevertheless	c
I	c
have	c
got	c
a	c
suitable	c
camera	c
...	c

Joachim	c
Delerm	c

Our	c
engineer	i
school	c
is	c
specealized	i
in	c
mecanics	i
and	c
thermodynamics	c
.	c

Needless	i
to	i
said	i
that	i
we	c
must	c
faces	i
our	c
attention	c
to	c
these	c
fields	c
.	c

I	c
wonder	c
if	c
we	c
could	c
not	c
feet	i
between	i
some	i
short	i
view	i
of	c
the	c
laboratories	c
,	c
in	c
which	c
we	c
could	c
show	c
student	i
making	i
experimentations	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
do	c
the	c
same	c
for	c
thermodynamics	c
.	c

Nevertheless	c
,	c
we	c
should	c
not	c
forget	c
the	c
extra-life	i
school	c
.	c

We	c
have	c
to	c
show	c
sports	c
at	c
school	c
and	c
all	c
activities	i
that	c
we	c
are	c
offered	c
.	c

There	i
are	i
not	c
only	c
the	c
brain	c
which	c
should	c
be	c
trained	c
.	c

If	c
possible	c
,	c
the	c
accomodation	i
I	c
prefer	c
is	c
in	i
tent	c
.	c

there	i
are	c
two	c
main	c
reasons	c
for	c
the	i
choice	c
:	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
keen	c
on	c
camping	c
in	c
high	c
mountains	c
and	c
hills	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
skilled	c
in	c
all	c
the	c
relative	i
activities	c
:	c
building-up	i
the	c
tent	c
,	c
cooking	c
on	i
camp	i
and	c
so	c
on	c
.	c

Among	c
the	c
proposed	c
activities	c
,	c
I	c
prefer	c
swimming	c
and	c
singing	c
.	c

I	c
will	c
be	c
very	c
glad	c
to	c
partecipate	i
to	i
your	c
camp	c
!	c

Our	c
school	c
,	c
as	c
it	i
is	c
well	c
known	c
,	c
is	c
a	c
technical	c
school	c
and	c
consequently	c
the	i
daily	c
life	c
contains	i
different	c
activities	c
performed	c
in	c
the	c
classrooms	c
or	c
in	c
the	c
laboratories	c
.	c

Here	c
we	c
can	c
describe	c
some	c
lessons	c
or	c
other	c
activities	c
which	c
can	c
be	c
filmed	c
to	i
create	i
the	c
video	c
.	c

Two	c
particular	c
activities	c
are	c
performed	c
in	c
the	i
laboratory	i
of	i
physics	i
and	i
in	i
the	i
laboratory	i
of	i
chemistry	i
.	c

In	c
the	c
former	c
some	c
of	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
physical	c
laws	c
are	c
experimentally	c
verified	c
by	c
the	c
students	c
with	c
the	c
help	c
of	c
an	c
assistant	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
latter	c
many	c
chemical	c
reactions	c
may	c
be	c
reproduced	c
to	c
show	c
to	c
the	c
students	c
the	c
resulting	c
effects	c
and	c
the	c
final	c
compounds	c
generated	c
.	c

Especially	c
the	c
boat	c
trip	c
on	c
river	i
is	i
a	c
good	c
idea	c
because	c
we	c
all	c
want	c
to	c
see	c
Greenwich	c
.	c

It	c
seems	c
it	c
's	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
a	i
great	c
fun	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
know	c
,	c
we	c
all	c
come	c
from	c
different	c
countries	c
and	c
we	c
are	c
keen	c
on	i
learning	i
some	c
other	c
things	c
about	c
English	c
culture	c
besides	c
the	c
language	c
itself	c
.	c

Briefly	c
,	c
we	c
would	c
be	c
happy	c
if	c
we	c
could	c
see	c
this	c
show	c
instead	c
of	c
the	c
Science	c
Museum	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
,	i
it	c
would	i
n't	i
cause	c
a	c
trouble	i
to	c
change	c
the	c
programme	c
.	c

In	c
fact	c
,	c
what	c
is	c
a	c
need	c
for	c
ordinary	c
people	c
is	c
a	c
more	c
important	c
need	c
for	c
famous	c
people	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
quiet	i
sure	c
,	i
even	i
the	c
ones	c
,	i
who	c
have	c
chosen	c
their	c
occupies	i
just	c
to	c
be	c
famous	c
,	c
do	c
n't	c
like	c
to	c
be	c
pictured	i
when	c
they	c
believe	c
they	c
are	c
alone	c
.	c

Obviously	c
,	c
there	c
is	c
no	c
point	c
in	c
saying	c
"	c
famous	c
people	c
have	c
a	c
right	c
to	c
their	c
own	c
live.	i
"	c

Although	c
this	c
statement	c
is	c
absuletely	i
true	c
,	c
it	c
seems	c
there	c
is	c
no	c
way	c
to	c
stop	c
public	c
attention	c
,	c
so	c
they	c
will	c
keep	i
living	c
with	c
journalists	c
.	c

My	c
name	c
is	c
Marcia	c
Fomalar	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
writting	i
to	c
make	i
you	c
know	c
how	c
disappointed	c
I	c
felt	c
when	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
musical	c
show	i
of	i
the	c
London	c
theatre	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
to	c
wait	c
more	c
that	c
an	c
hour	c
outside	c
the	c
theatre	c
because	c
to	c
make	c
matters	c
worse	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
spend	c
the	c
time	c
in	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

I	i
would	c
be	i
the	c
best	c
party	c
of	c
the	c
year	c
.	c

Now	c
she	c
is	c
85	c
years	c
old	c
so	c
she	c
ca	c
n't	c
do	c
that	c
but	c
,	i
I	c
can	c
.	c

It	c
seems	i
to	i
be	c
the	c
bigger	i
party	c
of	c
her	c
life	c
.	c

But	c
after	i
all	i
the	i
party	i
was	i
great	i

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
know	c
if	c
it	c
is	c
possible	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
during	c
that	c
month	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
free	c
from	c
the	c
school	c
's	c
activities	c
so	i
my	c
parents	c
just	i
let	c
me	c
go	c
if	c
I	c
do	c
not	c
have	c
to	c
miss	c
any	c
of	c
my	c
classes	c
.	c

About	c
the	c
activities	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
choose	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
it	c
is	c
quite	c
difficult	c
for	c
me	c
because	c
I	c
really	c
like	c
sports	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
think	c
the	c
best	c
option	c
is	c
swimming	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
practicing	i
it	c
during	i
5	c
years	c
so	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
keep	i
on	i
it	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
sure	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
thrilling	c
to	c
stay	c
near	i
the	i
nature	i
and	c
at	i
the	c
same	c
time	c
,	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
new	c
experience	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

To	c
:	c
John	c
Weller	c
.	c

To	c
make	c
easier	i
and	i
faster	i
this	i
report	i
,	c
it	c
was	c
necessary	c
to	c
make	c
a	c
questionarie	i
which	c
was	c
gave	i
out	c
in	c
the	c
school	c
.	c

After	c
collecting	c
the	c
answers	c
,	c
I	c
obtained	c
the	c
following	c
results	c
:	c

1-	c
It	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
good	c
idea	c
to	c
film	c
the	c
computer	c
centre	c
,	c
the	c
listening	i
room	i
room	c
and	c
the	c
library	c
because	c
as	i
everybody	c
knows	c
,	c
they	c
have	c
very	c
good	c
equipment	c
and	c
also	c
they	c
are	c
comfortable	c
places	c
helping	i
them	i
to	c
improve	c
their	c
English	c
on	c
their	c
own	c
.	c

3	c
-	c
The	i
least	i
but	i
not	i
the	i
last	i
,	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
students	c
(	c
almost	c
85	c
%	c
)	c
think	c
that	c
the	c
extra-activities	i
organised	c
by	c
the	c
social	c
programme	c
,	i
has	i
became	i
really	c
exciting	c
,	i
so	i
they	c
suggest	c
filming	c
these	c
activites	c
during	c
the	c
weekend	c
,	c
for	c
example	c
"	c
the	c
full	c
day	c
in	c
Oxford	c
"	c
because	c
for	i
those	c
that	i
did	c
not	c
have	c
the	c
opportunity	c
to	c
go	c
there	c
,	i
could	c
see	c
how	c
great	c
it	c
was	c
and	c
then	c
they	c
can	c
attend	c
the	c
next	c
time	c
.	c

Conclusion	c

Despite	c
of	i
being	c
almost	c
300	c
students	c
,	c
the	c
answers	c
were	c
quite	c
similar	c
.	c

Few	i
weeks	c
ago	c
,	c
me	i
and	i
my	i
farmily	i
had	c
a	c
hoilday	i
in	c
London	c
,	i
the	i
hoilday	i
was	c
n't	c
too	c
good	c
!	c

Because	c
...	c

so	i
we	c
did	c
,	c
but	c
unforturnily	i
it	c
was	c
close	i
and	c
I	c
was	c
so	c
dissapointed	i
about	c
it	c
,	c
nor	i
only	c
that	i
we	c
have	i
expected	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
to	c
be	i
the	i
actor	i
of	i
starring	i
.	c

Also	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
really	c
mind	c
that	c
the	c
show	c
start	i
late	c
but	c
the	c
rute	i
of	i
that	i
evening	i
was	i
rucented	i
.	c

We	c
do	c
n't	c
expect	c
much	i
bad	i
to	c
happened	i
in	i
our	c
hoilday	i
,	c
but	c
this	c
was	i
perfectic	i
show	i
as	i
well	i
,	c
it	c
was	c
the	c
worstest	i
show	c
and	c
theatre	c
I	c
have	c
never	i
been	c
in	i
my	c
life	c

sincinerly	i
from	i
Ki	c

In	i
order	i
to	c
live	c
happily	c
the	i
sciencetist	i
can	c
easily	c
perdict	i
the	i
changes	i
on	i

so	c
than	i
we	c
can	c
have	c
time	c
to	c
perpare	i
or	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c

I	c
have	c
just	c
received	c
your	c
letter	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
really	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
going	c
to	i
this	c
trip	c
.	c

Here	c
is	c
some	c
information	c
you	c
asked	c
for	c
and	c
also	c
a	c
few	c
questions	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
wondering	c
if	c
there	c
will	c
be	c
anywhere	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
wash	c
my	c
clothes	c
,	c
or	c
if	c
I	c
will	c
have	c
them	c
washed	c
.	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c

As	c
if	c
these	i
were	c
not	c
enough	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
always	c
impolite	c
assistants	c
,	c
who	c
make	c
your	c
day	c
even	c
worse	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
this	c
letter	c
to	c
express	i
the	c
reasons	c
of	i
our	c
disappointment	c
about	i
that	c
evening	c
.	c

Then	c
,	c
when	c
we	c
got	c
in	c
,	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
wait	c
because	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
forty-five	c
minutes	c
late	c
.	c

By	c
then	c
our	c
children	c
were	c
very	c
bored	c
.	c

My	c
husband	c
was	c
looking	c
for	i
to	c
seeing	c
his	c
favourite	c
actor	c
,	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
and	c
when	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
he	c
found	c
out	c
that	c
Brook	c
had	c
been	c
changed	i
by	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
and	c
this	c
was	c
the	c
reason	c
why	c
the	c
party	c
was	c
n't	c
as	c
succesful	i
as	c
we	c
thought	c
.	c

We	c
decided	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
his	c
place	c
(	c
I	c
've	c
got	c
a	c
copy	c
of	c
the	c
key	c
)	c
the	c
evening	c
before	c
his	c
birthday	c
while	c
he	c
was	c
at	c
work	c
and	c
decorate	c
the	c
lounch	i
,	c
then	c
turn	c
off	c
the	c
lights	c
and	c
wait	c
for	c
him	c
in	c
silence	c
until	c
he	c
arrived	c
.	c

Everybody	c
was	c
excited	c
about	c
the	c
idea	c
and	c
we	c
were	c
keeping	c
it	c
in	i
secret	c
in	c
front	c
of	c
Sam	c
.	c

Two	c
days	c
before	c
the	c
event	c
Carol	c
,	c
Albert	c
,	c
Sam	c
and	c
me	c
went	c
to	c
visit	c
Pat	c
in	c
her	c
house	c
and	c
she	c
invited	c
us	c
to	c
stay	c
for	c
dinner	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
her	c
aunt	c
inviting	i
her	c
for	i
the	c
weekend	c
so	c
Pat	c
said	c
very	c
loudly	c
:	c
"	c
I	c
'm	c
sorry	c
but	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
Sam	c
's	c
flat	c
and	c
decorate	c
it	c
,	i
it	c
's	c
a	c
surprise	c
,	c
do	c
n't	c
tell	c
anybody	c
"	c

With	c
reference	c
to	c
our	c
trip	c
in	i
London	c
,	c
in	i
name	i
of	i
all	c
of	c
us	c
,	c
English	i
class	c
in	c
this	c
college	c
,	c
we	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
special	c
atention	i
in	c
have	i
organised	i
a	c
good	c
programme	c
to	c
know	i
interesting	i
and	c
cultural	c
points	i
in	c
London	c
.	c

We	c
have	c
been	c
very	c
excited	c
about	c
this	c
and	c
coincidentely	i
we	c
have	c
found	c
another	c
option	c
to	c
add	c
in	i
our	c
programme	c
,	c
certainly	c
if	c
your	i
agree	c
with	c
.	i

We	c
have	i
thought	i
that	c
The	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
to	c
give	c
us	c
more	c
information	c
about	c
the	c
main	c
transformation	i
in	i
nowdays	i
in	c
England	c
about	i
fashions	i
,	c
Leisure	i
,	c
sports	c
and	c
style	i
of	i
life	i
.	c

I	c
knew	c
,	c
I	c
could	c
die	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
dangerous	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
kew	i
I	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
I	c
've	c
got	c
a	c
brother	c
who	c
likes	c
to	c
live	c
in	c
dangerous	i
and	c
poor	i
way	c
and	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
how	c
,	c
but	c
he	c
could	i
persuade	c
me	c
to	c
go	c
with	c
him	c
to	c
get	c
some	c
drugs	c
,	c
in	i
my	c
25th	c
birthday	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
at	c
home	c
making	i
me	i
up	i
before	c
to	i
go	i
to	c
a	c
restaurant	c
with	c
my	c
friends	c
and	c
,	c
sudenlly	i
,	c
he	c
rang	c
the	c
bell	c
,	i
he	i
was	c
so	c
nervous	i
with	c
a	c
gun	c
in	c
his	c
hands	c
and	c
no	i
longer	i
I	i
could	i
speak	i
he	c
took	c
me	c
out	c
with	c
him	c
.	c

The	c
dangerous	c
man	c
who	c
we	c
'd	c
gone	c
to	c
buy	c
drugs	c
was	i
upset	c
with	c
my	c
brother	c
and	c
had	c
decided	c
to	c
kill	c
him	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
had	c
killed	c
him	c
first	c
.	c

If	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
do	c
it	c
,	c
I	c
knew	c
I	c
would	c
die	c
,	i
my	i
option	c
was	c
my	c
life	c
,	c
but	c
now	c
I	c
have	c
n't	c
any	i
chance	c
to	c
live	c
because	c
I	c
'm	c
in	c
the	i
prison	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
,	c

Although	c
it	c
was	c
written	c
in	c
the	c
show	c
's	c
addvertisement	i
that	c
the	c
main	c
actor	c
was	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
it	c
,	c
unfortunately	c
,	c
was	c
not	c
him	c
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
the	c
addvertisement	i
promised	c
this	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
for	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

I	i
all	c
happened	c
a	c
year	c
ago	c
,	c
when	c
Pat	c
and	c
I	c
were	c
still	c
best	c
friends	c
and	c
used	c
to	c
tell	c
each	c
other	c
everything	c
.	c

I	c
asked	c
Pat	c
not	c
to	c
tell	c
anyone	c
,	c
and	c
she	c
promised	c
me	c
she	c
would	c
n't	c
.	c

I	c
went	c
home	c
that	c
day	c
after	c
having	c
told	c
Pat	c
my	c
deepest	c
secret	c
with	c
a	c
weird	c
feeling	c
in	c
my	c
heart	c
.	c

Something	c
was	c
telling	c
me	c
that	c
I	c
was	c
going	c
to	c
lose	c
a	c
friend	c
and	c
a	c
love	i
.	c

Suddenly	c
,	c
an	c
enourmous	i
saddness	i
caught	c
me	c
,	c
because	c
Philip	c
had	c
begged	c
me	c
not	c
to	c
tell	c
anyone	c
,	c
so	c
he	c
would	c
definately	i
brake	i
up	c
with	c
me	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
knew	c
I	c
was	c
going	c
to	c
stop	c
talking	c
to	c
Pat	c
,	c
because	c
she	c
had	c
just	c
ruined	c
my	c
happiness	c
and	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
trust	c
her	c
anymore	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
very	c
disappointing	c
for	c
me	c
that	c
the	c
starring	i
was	c
not	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
as	c
your	c
company	c
had	c
published	i
.	c

As	c
the	c
show	c
finished	c
later	i
,	c
we	c
decided	c
to	c
eat	c
something	c
at	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
but	c
to	i
our	c
surprise	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

An	i
other	i
thing	c
is	c
that	c
there	c
was	c
any	i
discount	c
available	c
so	c
we	c
spend	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
money	c
in	i
such	i
a	c
bad	c
show	c
.	c

Before	c
this	c
week	c
ends	c
,	c
I	c
want	c
your	c
company	c
to	c
give	c
me	c
the	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

Your	i
faithfully	c
,	c

Manuela	c
T.	c
Miracola	c

We	c
asked	c
each	c
other	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
questions	c
but	c
then	c
we	c
started	c
talking	c
about	c
things	c
that	c
had	c
never	c
been	c
talked	c
about	c
with	c
anybody	c
.	c

Such	c
as	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
thing	c
that	c
had	c
happened	c
to	c
us	c
in	c
our	c
life	i
and	c
that	i
kind	i
of	c
secrets	c
...	c

In	c
spite	c
of	c
the	c
fact	c
that	c
I	c
told	c
her	c
to	c
keep	c
it	c
as	i
a	c
secret	c
,	c
she	c
went	c
to	c
my	c
cousin	c
's	c
house	c
and	c
made	i
the	i
retelling	i
of	i
what	i
I	i
had	i
exactly	i
told	c
her	c
.	c

As	c
I	c
solved	i
the	c
trouble	i
with	c
my	c
cousin	c
,	c
I	c
understood	c
why	c
my	c
mother	c
had	c
told	c
me	c
that	c
'	c
friends	c
'	c
sometimes	c
were	c
n't	c
as	i
you	c
expected	c
them	c
to	c
be	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
your	c
product	i
.	c

I	c
was	c
planning	c
to	c
spend	c
my	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
when	c
I	c
found	c
your	c
advertisement	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
advertisement	c
,	c
you	c
mentioned	c
actors	c
,	c
time	c
,	c
price	i
discount	c
and	c
equipment	i
.	c

DANNY	c
BROOK	c
is	c
one	c
of	c
my	c
favorite	i
actor	i
so	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
buy	c
a	c
ticket	c
even	i
if	i
I	c
cancel	i
my	c
apointment	i
on	c
that	c
day	c
at	c
18=30	i
and	c
aslo	i
notice	i
of	i
price	i
discount	i
impressed	i
me	i
.	c

However	c
,	c
when	c
I	c
went	i
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
,	c
you	c
did	i
n't	i
anything	i
not	i
only	i
discount	i
but	c
also	c
apporogize	i
us	i
for	c
dalay	i
of	i
starting	c
musical	i
.	c

You	c
should	c
back	i
my	c
money	c
immedeastry	i
because	c
that	c
night	c
was	c
far	c
from	c
parfect	i
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

He	c
always	c
tried	c
to	c
say	c
nothing	c
and	c
did	c
.	c

But	c
everyone	c
always	c
noticed	i
he	i
had	i
secrets	i
from	i
his	i
face	i
.	c

Bank	i
robbers	c
said	i
him	c
if	c
Pat	c
told	c
the	i
fact	i
somebody	i
they	c
killed	i
him	c
.	c

Although	c
bank	i
robbers	c
complained	c
to	c
Pat	c
,	c
he	c
said	i
nothing	i
to	i
anybody	i
.	c

Thanks	c
to	c
his	c
habit	c
,	c
he	c
is	c
still	c
alive	c
and	c
all	c
money	i
were	i
backed	i
to	c
the	c
bank	c
.	c

Last	c
weekend	c
I	c
was	c
in	c
London	c
on	c
holiday	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
looked	c
forward	c
to	c
go	i
and	c
see	i
"	c
London	c
's	c
newest	c
and	c
best	c
musical	c
show	c
"	c
-Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
.	c

I	c
must	c
say	c
I	c
was	c
rather	c
disappointed	c
by	c
the	c
experience	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
a	c
great	c
admirer	c
of	c
the	c
actor	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
who	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
be	c
starring	c
in	c
the	c
musical	c
.	c

Very	c
disappointing	c
!	c

According	c
to	c
your	c
advertisement	c
the	c
musical	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
start	c
at	c
19:30	c
.	c

For	c
some	c
unknown	c
reason	c
it	c
did	c
not	c
start	c
until	c
20:15	c
.	c

After	c
the	c
show	c
I	c
had	c
planned	c
to	c
have	c
dinner	c
at	c
the	c
Theatre	c
Restaurant	c
.	c

I	c
bought	c
a	c
ticket	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
"	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
"	c
during	c
my	c
holiday	c
.	c

Therefore	c
I	c
think	c
the	c
least	c
I	c
can	c
ask	c
from	c
you	c
is	c
to	c
give	c
me	c
the	c
money	c
back	c
for	c
the	c
ticket	c
.	c

Best	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
disappointed	c
with	c
the	c
performance	c
and	c
apart	c
from	c
that	c
there	c
were	c
many	c
problems	i
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
the	c
well-known	c
star	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
was	c
n't	c
there	c
,	c
but	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
I	i
had	c
never	c
heard	c
from	i
him	c
.	c

From	c
my	c
point	c
of	c
view	c
I	c
think	c
he	c
was	c
such	c
a	c
very	c
bad	c
actor	c
that	c
was	i
impossible	c
to	c
fine	i
another	c
with	c
the	c
same	c
features	i
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

MARIA	c
GARDENT	c

I	c
considered	c
her	c
my	c
best	c
friend	c
and	c
I	c
thought	c
we	c
would	c
never	c
drift	c
apart	c
but	c
now	c
my	i
mind	i
have	i
changed	i
,	c
because	c
she	c
has	c
done	c
something	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
approve	i
.	c

My	c
mother	c
was	c
so	c
hungry	i
and	c
she	c
told	c
off	i
me	i
so	c
hard	i
that	c
I	c
will	c
remember	c
it	c
the	i
rest	c
of	c
my	c
life	c
.	c

Since	c
then	c
I	c
have	c
n't	c
seen	c
Pat	c
anymore	c
and	c
she	c
seems	i
not	i
regret	i
that	i
happened	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
'll	c
try	c
to	c
forget	c
her	c
and	c
carry	c
on	c
my	i
life	c
that	i
's	c
all	c

black	c
skin	i
,	c
the	c
trouses	i
was	i
quite	c
short	c
and	c
the	c
jackets	c
was	i
elegant	c
with	c
blazzend	i
materiell	i
.	c

The	c
colours	c
will	c
be	c
very	i
good	c
quality	c
and	c
the	c
fashion	i
will	c
be	i
changed	i
very	c
quickly	c
like	c
now	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
,	c

However	c
,	c
the	c
students	c
in	c
my	c
class	c
have	c
seen	c
an	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
,	c
which	c
is	c
going	c
to	c
take	c
place	c
on	c
14th	i
of	c
March	c
at	c
Central	i
Exhibition	c
Hall	c
.	c

Visitors	c
will	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
latest	c
fashions	c
,	c
leisure	c
and	c
sports	c
wear	c
and	c
also	c
get	c
some	c
help	c
with	c
make	i
up	i
or	c
hairstyle	i
.	c

It	c
would	c
be	c
great	i
opportunity	c
to	c
see	c
this	c
show	c
,	c
because	c
we	c
are	c
all	c
very	c
interested	c
in	c
fashion	i
subject	i
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Famous	c
people	c
,	c
such	c
as	c
politicians	c
and	c
film	c
stars	c
,	c
deserve	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
private	c
life	c
without	c
journalists	c
following	c
them	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
.	c

In	i
these	i
days	c
,	c
when	c
we	c
can	c
see	c
picture	i
of	c
famous	i
person	c
almost	i
on	i
every	i
first	i
page	i
of	i
the	i
newspaper	c
,	c
it	c
's	c
a	i
quite	i
common	c
topic	c
.	i

Journalists	c
should	c
not	c
follow	c
them	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
,	c
trying	c
to	c
make	i
an	c
interview	c
or	c
taking	i
an	c
'	c
interesting	c
'	c
picture	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
really	c
understand	c
how	c
annoying	c
or	c
depressing	c
it	c
can	c
be	c
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
it	c
is	c
very	c
hard	c
to	c
find	c
an	c
answer	c
to	c
this	c
question	c
.	c

Our	c
request	c
is	c
to	c
change	c
the	c
programme	c
,	c
either	c
you	c
can	c
cancel	c
all	i
the	i
Tuesday	i
and	c
we	c
can	c
enjoy	c
all	c
the	c
exhibition	c
or	c
if	c
you	c
cannot	c
cancel	c
the	c
Museum	c
,	c
we	c
can	c
go	c
there	c
right	c
after	c
because	c
we	c
will	c
have	c
full	i
of	c
time	c
to	c
shopping	i
during	c
our	c
free	c
time	c
on	c
Wednesday	c
.	c

According	i
to	i
me	i
,	c
you	c
ca	i
n't	i
deserve	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
private	c
life	c
when	c
you	c
're	c
famous	c
because	c
when	c
to	i
start	i
you	i
career	c
you	c
know	c
that	c
medias	i
will	c
be	c
hunting	c
you	c
everywhere	c
and	c
more	i
famous	c
you	c
get	c
worst	i
it	c
is	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
because	c
that	c
the	i
life	i
style	i
people	c
wants	i
to	c
know	c
everything	c
,	i
for	c
instance	c
,	c
about	c
their	c
favourite	c
actor	c
or	c
about	c
their	c
president.	c
.	i

And	c
if	c
Medias	i
are	c
too	c
awful	c
they	c
have	c
got	c
law	i
to	c
protect	c
themself	i
.	c

Now	c
I	c
'm	c
going	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
some	c
information	c
,	i
you	c
asted	i
about	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
sory	i
to	c
tell	i
that	i
,	c
but	c
the	c
only	c
time	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
take	c
this	c
trip	c
in	i
July	c
,	c
according	c
to	c
our	c
team	c
's	c
shudule	i
.	c

-	i
I	c
like	c
to	c
wake	c
up	c
with	c
a	c
view	c
to	i
mountains	c
,	c
wich	i
remind	i
me	c
about	i
my	c
5	c
years	i
experience	c
in	i
climbing	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
is	c
it	c
posible	i
,	i
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
continue	c
doing	c
my	c
favorite	i
hobbies	c
in	c
the	c
Camp	c
.	c

And	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
should	c
I	c
take	c
?	c

Elina	c

Do	c
you	c
think	c
it	c
's	c
enjoyable	i
spending	i
of	i
time	c
?	c

If	c
you	c
would	i
ask	i
me	c
,	c
I	c
prefer	c
my	c
friends	c
to	c
do	c
all	c
shoping	i
for	c
me	c
.	c

And	c
of'course	i
not	c
all	c
shops	c
have	c
good	c
conditionering	i
.	c

It	c
can	c
be	c
boring	c
,	c
it	c
can	c
be	c
not	i
.	c

To	c
Manager	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
inform	c
you	c
that	c
your	c
advertisement	c
mentions	c
so	c
many	c
different	c
things	c
,	c
so	c
it	c
spoilt	c
a	c
part	c
of	c
my	c
journey	c
.	c

Then	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
receive	c
my	c
money	c
for	c
the	c
ticket	c
.	c

After	c
reading	c
your	c
advertisement	c
.	c

I	c
went	c
to	c
your	c
theatre	c
to	c
see	c
'	c
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
'	c
last	c
night	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
wanted	c
to	c
see	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
in	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

You	c
wrote	c
'	c
discouts	i
available	c
'	c
but	c
they	c
did	c
n't	c
discount	i
.	c

The	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
of	c
being	c
repaired	c
.	c

You	c
advertised	c
for	i
my	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
.	c

(	c
Hotel	c
number	c
)	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
I	c
can	c
have	c
my	c
spare	c
time	c
owing	i
to	c
these	c
thing	i
.	c

Also	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
imagine	c
my	c
life	c
without	c
car	i
.	c

These	c
things	c
provide	c
me	c
all	i
convenience	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
because	c
I	c
receive	i
your	c
letter	c
concerning	c
the	c
prize	c
of	c
two	c
weeks	c
in	c
California	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
the	i
first	c
two	c
weeks	c
of	c
July	c
because	c
in	c
June	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
working	c
and	c
at	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
July	c
I	c
am	c
planing	i
to	c
go	c
to	c
Paris	c
to	c
attend	c
a	c
course	i
of	i
French	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
also	c
to	c
have	c
more	c
information	c
about	c
the	c
cost	c
and	c
which	i
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
you	c
suggest	c
to	i
bring	i
with	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
your	i
reply	c

Your	i
faithfully	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
important	c
to	i
concentrate	i
this	i
video	i
in	i
few	i
but	i
interesting	c
part	i
of	c
our	c
daily	c
life	c
at	c
school	c

We	c
should	c
speak	c
about	c
our	c
library	c
that	i
it	c
is	c
well	c
furnished	c
of	i
several	i
books	c
,	c
tape	i
and	c
video	i
.	c

In	c
addition	c
I	c
think	c
should	i
be	i
reported	i
in	i
this	i
video	i
some	i
personal	i
opinion	i
about	i
the	i
school	i
asking	i
students	c
and	c
teachers	c
.	c

thank	i
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

As	c
request	i
following	i
you	c
will	c
find	c
the	c
information	c
you	c
need	c
.	i

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
two	c
questions	c
.	c

Please	c
let	c
me	c
know	c
which	i
clothes	c
do	i
I	c
need	c
then	i
and	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
in	c
cash	c
and	c
as	i
travellers	c
cheque	i
shall	i
I	c
take	c
with	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

Sometimes	c
the	c
bad	c
charachters	i
in	c
a	c
story	c
are	c
more	c
interesting	c
than	c
the	c
good	c
ones	c
.	c

Recently	c
I	c
have	c
red	i
a	c
short	c
story	c
written	c
by	c
Agatha	c
Christie	c
.	c

The	c
charachter	i
which	i
I	c
liked	c
most	c
was	c
that	c
of	c
Mrs.	c
Havering	c
,	c
the	c
mistress	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
her	c
husband	c
only	c
followed	c
what	i
she	i
ordered	i
him	i
.	c

As	c
far	c
as	c
I	c
am	c
concerned	c
I	c
would	c
appreciate	c
to	i
have	i
myself	i
some	i
of	i
her	i
characteristics	i
,	c
like	i
take	i
a	i
decision	i
and	i
handle	i
.	c

Another	c
disappointing	c
thing	c
was	c
that	c
that	i
discounts	c
were	c
not	c
available	c
,	c
which	c
made	c
me	c
a	c
bit	c
angry	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
the	c
most	c
disappointing	c
think	i
was	c
that	c
theatre	i
's	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
to	i
add	i
that	c
I	c
was	c
hungry	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
not	c
such	c
a	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerlly	i
,	c

Every	c
day	c
when	c
I	c
get	c
up	c
I	c
am	i
checking	i
if	c
there	c
are	c
any	c
messages	c
left	c
for	c
me	c
like	c
e-mail	c
or	c
SMS	c
in	i
my	c
mobile	c
phone	c
.	c

They	c
are	c
very	c
usefull	i
things	c
which	c
sometimes	c
are	c
nessecary	i
to	c
survive	c
.	c

Modern	c
technology	c
has	c
got	i
a	c
big	c
influence	c
on	c
our	c
life	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
easier	c
.	c

We	c
can	c
communicate	c
with	c
people	c
by	c
using	c
mobile	c
phones	c
or	c
telephones	c
which	i
are	c
the	c
best	c
things	c
ever	c
made	c
.	c

I	c
use	c
them	c
very	c
often	c
in	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
.	c

I	c
watch	c
about	c
four	c
hourers	i
TV	i
a	c
day	c
,	i
I	c
even	c
eat	c
my	c
meals	c
in	c
front	c
of	c
the	c
TV	c
.	c

Also	c
Iternet	i
has	c
influence	i
on	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
,	c
beause	i
I	c
can	c
find	c
there	c
many	c
interesting	c
things	c
,	c
or	c
I	c
can	c
meet	c
with	c
people	c
from	c
all	c
over	c
the	c
world	c
which	i
is	c
exciting	c
for	c
me	c

Madam	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
travel	c
on	i
July	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
manager	c
so	c
I	c
can	i
not	i

another	c
time	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

I	i
've	i
asked	i
my	c
mom	c
and	c
my	c
friends	c
and	c
everybody	i
did	i
n't	i
know	i
where	c
it	c

My	c
mom	c
said	c
:	c

Now	c
I	c
was	c
without	c
my	c
money	c
and	c
my	c
wallet	c

Suddenly	c
the	c
door	c
bell	c
rang	c

I	c
went	c

who	c
was	c
there	c

'	c
It	i
's	i

I	c
said	c

You	c
may	c
be	c
surprised	c
to	c
receive	c
a	c
letter	c
from	c
us	c
.	c

All	c
the	c
students	c
are	c
happy	c
that	c
we	c
will	c
have	c
othe	i
oppurtinatey	i
,	i
to	c
visit	c
London	c
for	c
three	c
days	c
.	c

We	c
all	c
agree	i
to	i
the	c
daily	c
programme	c
during	i
the	c
three	c
days	c
.	c

The	c
show	c
includes	c
the	c
latest	c
fashions	c
in	c
the	i
sports	c
clothing	c
and	c
the	c
most	c
fashionable	c
make	i
up	i

The	c
student	c

Ourdays	i
,	c
with	c
the	c
help	c
of	c
the	c
media	c
famous	i
people	c
,	c
like	c
a	i
politician	i
or	c
filmstars	c
,	c
plays	i
an	c
important	c
rule	i
in	c
our	c
community	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
also	c
normally	c
,	i
that	i
the	c
journalists	c
are	c
after	c
them	c
.	c

They	c
want	c
to	c
get	c
from	c
them	c
all	c
the	c
details	c
of	c
their	c
life	c
,	c
especially	c
from	i
their	c
private	c
.	i

That	c
fact	c
should	c
be	c
respected	c
by	c
the	c
journalists	c
.	c

Is	i
it	i
normally	i
when	c
you	c
are	c
a	c
star	c
,	i
that	c
everybody	c
wants	c
to	c
know	c
all	c
about	c
you	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
nobody	c
have	i
forgotten	c
,	i
where	c
curiosity	i
from	i
the	c
journalists	c
end	i
.	c

I	c
hope	c
that	c
they	c
will	c
punished	i
for	c
what	c
they	c
done	i
!	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
a	c
musical	c
show	c
called	c
'	c
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	i
,	i
that	c
took	i
place	i
in	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
.	c

The	c
first	c
problem	c
was	c
about	c
the	c
actors	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
waiting	c
for	c
the	c
show	c
for	c
a	i
half-an-hour	i
!	c

The	c
third	c
problem	c
were	i
the	c
discounts	c
.	c

There	c
are	c
many	c
different	c
creatures	c
on	c
Earth	c
:	c
animals	c
,	c
insects	c
,	c
plants	c
.	c

But	c
the	c
most	c
developed	c
creature	c
is	c
a	i
human	c
.	c

He	c
lived	i
nearly	i
10	c
000	c
years	c
.	c

Now	c
,	c
modern	c
technology	c
has	c
changed	c
our	c
life	c
.	c

We	i
use	i
different	i
electric	i
kettle	i
.	c

We	c
use	c
different	c
transport	c
that	c
makes	c
our	c
moving	i
faster	c
,	c
it	c
fastens	i
our	c
life	c
.	c

We	c
communicate	c
with	c
other	c
people	c
by	c
telephone	c
,	i
mail	i
,	c
we	c
read	c
newspapers	c
,	c
we	c
watch	c
television	c
,	c
get	i
different	c
information	c
from	c
internet	i
.	c

Factories	c
polluted	i
the	c
air	c
we	c
breath	c
,	c
shops	i
polluted	i
the	c
water	c
we	c
drink	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
:	i
cancer	c
occured	i
in	c
Africa	c
after	c
American	c
nuclear	c
tests	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
as	c
it	c
is	c
the	c
only	c
month	c
in	i
this	c
year	c
when	c
I	c
do	c
not	c
have	c
any	c
exams	c
.	c

I	c
know	c
very	c
little	c
about	c
surfing	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
almost	c
something	c
new	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

But	c
,	c
on	i
the	i
other	i
side	i
,	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
good	c
basketball	c
player	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
practise	i
it	i
three	c
or	c
four	c
times	c
a	c
week	c
as	c
I	c
play	c
in	c
the	c
University	c
team	c

Well	i

but	i
I	c
do	c
n't	c
regret	c
going	c
to	c
that	c
concert	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
marvellous	c
experience	c
,	i
I	c
really	c
enjoyed	c
working	c
with	c
such	c
a	c
nice	c
team	c
,	c
they	c
were	c
really	c
kind	c
with	i
me	c

Please	c

know	c
if	c
you	c

Write	c

love	c

I	c
always	c
dreamed	c
about	c
going	c
to	c
the	i
California	c
and	c
now	c
my	c
dreams	c
are	c
coming	c
truth	i
.	c

If	c
it	c
's	c
possible	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	i
to	i
travel	i
only	i
July	i
,	c
because	c
my	c
school	c
wo	c
n't	c
be	c
finished	c
earlier	c
.	c

If	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
choice	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
live	i
in	c
tent	i
then	c
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
things	c
for	c
me	c
,	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
chance	c
to	c
forget	c
about	c
all	c
my	c
present	c
,	c
luxurious	c
life	c
and	c
try	c
doing	c
something	c
different	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
be	c
very	c
grateful	c
,	c
if	c
you	c
gave	c
me	c
a	i
possibility	c
of	c
singing	c
.	c

I	c
've	c
always	c
wanted	c
to	c
learn	c
singing	i
professionaly	i
,	c
but	c
I	c
've	c
never	c
had	c
an	c
occasion	i
.	c

I	c
'm	c
very	c
keen	c
on	c
swimming	c
,	c
too	c
.	c

My	c
mother	c
told	c
me	c
,	c
that	c
when	c
she	c
had	i
been	i
there	c
two	c
years	c
ago	c
it	c
was	c
really	c
hot	c
.	c

Should	c
I	c
take	c
with	c
me	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
money	c
?	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

We	i
lived	i
here	i
in	i
rush	i
,	i
but	c
there	c
was	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
fun	c
,	c
too	c
.	c

Trully	i
,	c
my	c
work	c
here	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
important	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
relly	i
enjoyed	c
it	c
.	c

Sometimes	i
somebody	i
should	i
on	i
me	i
,	i
but	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
say	c
they	c
are	c
often	c
right	c
.	c

But	c
,	c
for	i
luck	i
,	c
it	i
was	i
n't	i
achieved	i
with	i
succes	i
of	i
our	i
concert	i
.	c

You	c
have	c
to	c
admit	c
,	c
that	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
magnificent	c
.	c

O.K.	c
That	c
's	c
all	c
for	c
today	c
.	c

I	c
'll	c
write	c
you	i
again	c
tomorrow	c

because	c
now	c
my	c
Mom	c
is	c
angry	c
,	c
the	c
I'am	i
not	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
,	c

So	c
I	c
'm	c
writting	i
this	c
letter	c
,	c
asking	c
,	i
if	c
you	c
can	c
change	c
the	c
programme	c
.	c

There	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
to	c
go	c
there	c
because	c
the	i
students	c
need	c
not	c
pay	c
anyting	i

The	c
Dangerous	c
Mission	c
.	c

That	c
was	c
my	c
situation	c
at	c
the	c
moment	i
.	c

The	c
story	c
had	c
began	i
two	c
days	c
before	c
...	c

It	c
prove	i
our	c
bravura	i
to	c
be	c
a	c
man	c
.	c

Our	c
first	c
chalenge	i
was	c
stealing	c
Dick	c
's	c
girlfriend	c
's	c
pantie	i
,	c
but	c
it	i
failed	c
.	c

And	c
she	c
broke	c
up	c
the	c
relationship	c
with	c
Dick	c
and	c
we	c
had	i
a	i
conclusion	c
that	c
stealing	c
panties	c
from	c
young	c
girls	c
was	c
very	c
difficult	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
the	c
only	c
one	c
that	c
could	c
n't	c
stole	i
any	c
panties	c
.	c

But	c
she	c
was	c
a	c
very	c
angry	c
woman	c
.	c

"	c
It	c
was	c
dangerous	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
knew	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
"	c
,	c
to	c
prove	c
my	c
bravure	i
to	c
all	i
.	c

I	c
had	c
quickly	c
,	i
entered	c
in	i
my	c
grandmother	c
's	c
room	c
and	c
started	c
to	c
get	c
some	c
panties	c
.	c

Next	c
day	c
my	c
Grand	i
mother	i
come	i
and	c
she	c
gave	c
my	c
shoes	c
to	c
my	c
mother	c
.	c

That	c
was	c
the	c
most	c
dangerous	c
mission	c
of	c
my	c
life	c
.	c

I	c
WOULD	c
PROBABLY	c

I	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

It	c
was	c
very	c
important	c
for	c
us	c
because	c
we	c
really	c
wanted	c
people	c
to	c
enjoy	c
it	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
very	c
enjoyable	c
I	i
met	i
lots	c
of	c
friends	c
We	i
'd	i
been	i
together	c
all	c
day	c
,	c
painting	c
the	c
walls	c
,	c
cleaning	c
putting	i
some	i
baloons	i
and	c
other	c
staff	i
everywhere	c
.	c

And	c
at	c
the	c
time	c
of	c
concert	i
we	c
wore	c
a	i
big	c
funny	c
costume	i
,	c
and	c
danced	c
with	c
people	c
.	c

Guess	c
what	c
the	c
name	c
of	c
the	c
band	c
is	c
;	c
Back	c
Street	c
Boys	c
.	c

Oh	c
,	c
my	c
God	c
they	i
're	c
so	i
nice	c
,	c
talkative	c
,	c
funny	c
,	c
people	c
.	c

Bye	c
for	c
now	c
,	c
write	c
to	c
me	c
soon	c

Dear	c
Mr.	c
Robertson	c
,	c

There	c
will	c
be	c
the	c
latest	c
fashions	c
and	c
leisure	c
and	c
sports	c
wear	c
.	i

We	c
think	c
that	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
for	c
us	c
to	c
see	c
this	c
show	c
because	c
we	c
are	c
all	c
interested	c
in	c
fashion	c
.	c

You	c
can	c
give	c
the	c
possibility	i
to	c
the	c
students	c
too	i
choose	c
between	c
go	i
shopping	c
or	c
go	i
to	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

The	c
show	c
will	c
be	c
at	c
the	c
Central	c
Exhibition	c
Hall	c
and	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
opened	i
until	c
7.	c
pm	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
even	c
free	c
for	c
students	c
!	c
!	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
famous	c
people	c
deserve	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
private	c
life	c
like	c
all	c
the	c
normal	c
people	c
,	c
without	c
journalists	c
following	c
them	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
.	c

A	c
famous	c
person	c
should	c
have	c
the	c
chance	c
to	c
go	c
on	c
his	c
own	c
for	c
a	c
walk	c
without	c
having	c
the	c
annoying	c
impression	c
of	c
being	c
followed	c
.	c

They	c
should	c
understand	c
when	c
it	c
is	c
too	c
much	c
,	c
when	c
they	c
are	c
going	c
too	c
far	c
.	c

For	c
instance	c
,	c
the	c
tragic	c
death	c
of	c
Princess	c
Diana	c
is	c
an	c
example	c
of	c
what	c
a	c
journalist	c
must	c
not	c
do	c
.	c

In	c
this	c
occasion	i
we	c
can	c
say	c
that	c
the	c
journalists	c
have	c
,	c
of	c
course	c
indirectly	c
,	c
caused	c
her	c
death	c
.	c

If	c
one	c
is	c
famous	c
it	i
has	c
to	c
accept	c
also	c
the	c
disadvantages	c
of	c
be	i
famous	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
view	c
Prince	c
Charles	c
is	c
a	c
good	c
example	c
of	c
how	c
famous	c
people	c
have	c
to	c
deal	c
with	c
the	c
media	c
.	c

When	c
he	c
goes	c
skiing	c
in	c
Switzerland	c
he	c
always	c
stops	c
for	c
a	c
while	c
to	c
talk	c
with	c
the	c
journalists	c
and	c
to	c
give	c
the	c
photographers	c
the	c
chance	c
to	c
take	c
pictures	c
.	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c

It	c
is	c
the	c
thing	c
I	c
really	c
want	c
.	c

I	c
've	c
got	c
three-month	i
holiday	c
from	c
June	c
to	c
August	c
but	c
I	c
've	c
already	c
promised	c
my	c
aunt	c
,	c
who	c
runs	c
a	c
small	c
nursing	c
home	c
in	c
Andover	c
,	c
to	c
help	c
her	c
during	c
June	c
and	c
in	c
August	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
to	c
work	c
to	c
get	c
my	c
next-term	c
tuition	c
fee	c
.	c

So	c
July	c
is	c
the	c
only	c
month	c
I	c
can	c
take	c
part	c
in	c
your	c
activities	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
sensitive	c
to	c
noise	c
especially	c
at	c
night	c
and	c
tend	c
to	c
catch	c
a	c
cold	c
even	c
in	c
summer	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
quite	c
good	c
at	c
swimming	c
but	c
I	c
never	c
tried	c
to	i
do	i
surfing	c
.	c

I	c
expect	c
you	c
have	c
lovely	c
nature	i
in	c
California	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
draw	c
on	c
my	c
canvas	c
.	c

Let	c
me	c
ask	c
a	c
question	c
about	c
clothes	c
and	c
money	c
.	c

What	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
do	c
I	c
need	c
and	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
do	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
.	i

I	c
am	c
really	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
going	c
there	c
and	c
your	i
reply	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

I	c
love	c
shopping	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
help	c
accepting	c
it	c
is	c
true	c
that	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

Sometimes	c
customers	c
'	c
trolleys	c
run	c
into	c
each	c
other	c
and	c
they	c
have	c
to	c
wait	c
ages	c
to	c
go	c
through	c
check-ins	c
.	c

What	c
's	c
worse	c
,	c
there	c
is	c
usually	c
traffic	i
jam	c
around	c
or	c
along	c
roads	c
to	c
a	c
big	c
supermarket	c
and	c
a	c
shopping	c
mall	c
.	c

Shopping	c
gets	c
them	c
tired	c
as	c
they	c
have	c
to	c
walk	c
for	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
to	c
find	c
the	c
things	c
they	c
want	c
to	c
get	c
.	c

Otherwise	c
they	c
can	c
have	c
lots	c
of	c
problem	i
and	c
difficult	i
to	c
live	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	i
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

Secondly	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
one	c
hour	c
fifteen	i
past	i
after	i
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
when	c
I	c
asked	c
about	c
the	c
discounts	c
,	c
an	c
agressive	i
employee	c
refused	c
to	c
answer	c
me	c
.	c

He	c
stayed	c
looking	c
at	c
me	c
and	c
laughing	c
.	c

The	c
evening	c
was	c
a	c
horrible	c
surprise	c
,	c
completely	c
different	c
from	c
the	i
promise	i
written	i
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
.	c

Defineteley	i
,	c
I	c
want	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c
.	c

"	c
Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets.	c
"	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
admit	c
that	c
I	c
told	c
her	c
my	c
own	c
opinion	c
.	c

Well	c
,	c
it	i
was	c
the	c
beginning	c
of	c
my	c
tragedy	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
shut	c
my	c
mouth	c
,	i
I	c
continued	c
:	c
"	c
You	c
ca	c
n't	c
believe	c
it	c
Pat	i
,	c
she	c
wears	c
trousers	c
like	c
men	i
and	c
green	c
flowery	c
blouses	c
"	i
Of	c
course	c
,	c
my	c
friend	c
and	c
I	c
were	c
laughing	c
during	i
half	c
an	c
hour	c
.	c

Two	c
days	c
after	i
,	c
when	c
Pat	c
came	c
back	c
to	c
my	c
school	c
and	i
she	c
met	c
Mr	c
Harter	c
,	c
our	c
head	c
teacher	c
,	c
she	c
told	c
everything	i
about	c
Ann1	c
.	c

But	c
,	c
well	c
,	c
unhappiness	i
started	c
with	c
Pat	c
and	c
my	c
reveilled	i
secrets	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
Very	i
happy	c
in	i
winning	i
this	c
prize	c
and	c
I	c
hope	c
my	c
stay	c
there	c
will	c
be	c
great	c
!	c

And	c
I	c
Will	i
like	c
to	c
be	i
accommodated	i
in	c
a	c
log	c
Cabin	i
,	c
because	c
I	c
do	c
not	c
like	c
sleeping	c
in	c
tents	c
,	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
bugs	c
and	c
insects	c
.	c

I	c
also	c
Want	i
to	i
Know	i
if	c
I	c
should	c
take	c
any	c
Money	i
,	c
or	c
if	c
all	c
the	c
expences	i
are	c
payed	i
by	c
You	i
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

But	c
of	c
course	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
some	c
exceptions	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
when	c
you	c
buy	c
something	c
,	c
you	c
might	c
lose	c
it	c
and	c
never	c
again	i
see	i
it	i
,	c
or	c
you	c
could	c
be	c
robbed	c
,	c
or	c
even	i
if	c
the	c
product	c
has	c
something	c
wrong	c
with	c
it	c
,	c
then	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
swap	c
it	c
and	c
that	c
takes	c
time	c
.	c

And	c
sometimes	c
the	c
credit	i
card	i
machines	c
do	c
n't	c
work	c
,	c
or	c
they	c
do	c
n't	c
accept	c
your	c
card	c
or	c
even	i
if	i
you	c
have	c
exceeded	c
the	c
limit	c
of	i
your	c
credit	c
card	c
.	c

That	c
makes	c
those	c
people	c
frustrated	c
and	c
they	c
do	c
n't	c
enjoy	c
theirselves	i
.	c

I	c
'd	c
prefer	c
to	c
sleep	c
in	c
tents	c
rather	c
than	c
log	c
cabins	c
:	c
sleeping	c
in	c
tents	c
seems	c
to	c
correspond	c
to	c
a	c
"	c
spirit	c
of	c
adventure	c
"	c
to	c
me	c
,	c
what	i
I	c
particularly	c
like	c
;	c
in	i
the	i
opposite	i
,	c
log	c
cabins	c
are	c
more	c
"	c
traditional	c
"	c
and	c
a	c
less	c
interesting	c
experience	c
.	c

But	c
this	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
the	c
case	c
:	c
at	c
first	c
,	c
you	c
see	c
a	c
very	c
pretty	c
item	c
which	c
you	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
try	c
.	i

When	c
you	c
ask	c
to	c
,	c
the	c
seller	i
offen	i
answers	c
that	c
your	c
size	c
is	c
missing	i
.	c

There	c
is	c
only	c
one	c
minute	c
left	c
!	c

Now	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
request	c
some	c
information	c
about	c
clothes	c
and	c
money	c
.	c

What	c
type	c
of	c
clothes	c
and	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
should	c
I	c
take	c
with	c
me	c
?	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
receiving	c
your	c
reply	c
and	c
hope	c
the	c
information	c
above	c
will	c
helpful	i
towards	c
the	c
preparation	c
for	c
the	c
weeks	c
in	c
subject	i
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Right	c
size	c
,	c
right	c
colour	c

However	c
that	i
impression	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
true	c
.	c

Everyone	c
enjoys	c
wearing	c
nice	c
new	c
clothes	c
,	i
however	i
do	i
we	c
really	c
like	c
the	c
process	c
of	c
chosing	i
them	c
?	c

What	c
is	c
more	c
,	c
we	c
can	c
say	c
that	c
price	c
is	c
often	c
very	c
off-putting	c
as	c
well	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
you	i
always	i
talk	i
yourself	i
into	i
some	i
piece	i
of	i
clothing	i
but	i
that	i
ended	i
up	i
being	i
a	i
tiring	i
day	i
of	c
going	c
in	c
and	c
out	c
of	c
fitting	c
rooms	c
and	c
figuring	c
out	c
discounts	c
.	c

I	c
want	c
you	c
to	c
know	c
how	i
extraordinary	i
moments	i
I	c
passed	i
with	c
my	c
friends	c
in	i
the	c
festival	c
.	c

On	i
my	i
point	i
of	i
view	i
the	c
hall	c
of	i
the	c
rock	c
concets	i
was	c
too	c
small	c
,	i
you	i
've	i
to	c
consider	c
make	i
a	c
big	i
one	c
for	c
the	i
next	c
year	c
because	c
these	c
kind	i
of	c
events	c
are	c
concurred	i
by	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
young	c
people	c
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
say	c
thanks	c
for	c
such	c
an	i
special	c
weekend	c
.	c

Dear	c
Miguel	c

I	c
'm	c
going	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
what	c
I	c
feel	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
house	c
rules	c
practically	c
do	c
n't	c
exist	c
because	c
I	c
have	i
18	c
years	c
old	c
now	c
so	c
my	c
parents	i
only	c
wish	c
is	c
that	c
I	c
study	c
a	i
carrear	i
and	c
be	c
a	c
good	c
man	c
.	c

At	c
school	c
is	i
complete	i
different	c
because	c
the	c
teachers	c
do	c
n't	c
foregive	i
you	c
nothing	i
.	c

You	c
have	c
to	c
be	c
quiet	c
an	i
attention	i
in	c
class	c
if	c
you	c
would	i
n't	i
to	i
be	c
punished	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
happy	c
because	c
my	c
parents	c
allow	c
me	c
to	c
do	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
things	c
.	c

Love	c
,	c

At	c
first	c
my	c
favourite	c
actor	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
did	c
n't	c
perform	c
without	i
any	c
explictions	i
,	i
and	c
the	c
show	c
should	c
started	i
at	c
19:30	c
instead	c
of	c
20:15	c
!	c
!	c

What	c
a	c
terrible	c
evening	c
!	c

Yours	c
Faithfully	c

Then	c
he	c
waited	c
for	c
the	c
next	c
train	c
to	c
London	c
and	c
he	c
caught	c
it	c
.	c

He	c
was	c
so	c
happy	c
!	c

She	c
was	c
so	c
angry	c
and	c
confused	c
because	c
Jim	c
have	i
n't	i
told	c
her	c
the	c
truth	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
really	c
dissapointed	i
bout	i
"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
which	c
I	c
saw	c
the	c
other	c
day	c
in	i
my	c
stay	c
in	c
London	c
which	c
your	c
company	c
organized	c
.	c

After	c
all	c
this	c
I	i
wanted	c
to	c
make	c
my	c
evening	c
pleasant	c
however	i
for	i
my	c
surprise	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
some	i
problems	i
of	i
sanitary	i
.	c

I	c
explained	c
to	c
you	c
every	c
detail	c
about	c
what	c
happened	c
in	i
the	c
musical	c
show	c
and	c
I	c
want	c
you	c
refund	i
my	c
money	c
and	c
send	c
to	i
me	c
an	c
apology	c
for	c
what	c
happenned	i
there	c
.	c

Modern	c
technology	c
changed	c
our	c
lifes	i
in	c
many	c
ways	c
,	i
when	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
wake	c
up	c
earlier	c
I	c
use	c
my	c
alarm	c
clock	c
,	c
if	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
wash	c
my	c
teeth	c
I	c
use	c
my	c
toothbrush	c
with	c
a	c
little	c
of	i
toothpaste	c
.	c

I	c
use	c
my	c
desk	c
to	c
study	c
which	c
was	c
made	c
with	c
trees	c
cut	c
down	c
and	c
emsamblish	i
by	c
machines	c
more	c
powerful	c
than	c
handwork	i
.	c

Even	c
though	i
,	c
this	c
is	c
not	c
enough	c
the	i
technology	c
created	c
a	c
better	c
way	i
of	c
communication	c
,	c
first	c
there	c
were	c
letters	c
,	c
after	i
telephones	c
and	c
now	c
we	c
can	c
write	c
letters	c
and	c
receive	c
them	c
through	c
internet	i
.	c

If	c
I	c
am	c
hungry	c
I	c
open	c
the	c
refrigerator	c
and	c
take	c
foods	i
and	c
cook	c
it	c
with	c
a	c
microwave	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
have	c
a	c
headache	c
I	c
ate	i
pills	c
,	c
made	c
by	c
technology	c
.	c

Everything	c
has	c
advantages	c
and	c
disadvantages	c
but	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
thing	c
is	c
how	c
we	c
use	c
it	c
.	c

If	c
we	c
creates	i
guns	c
to	c
protect	c
our	c
homes	c
,	c
others	c
will	c
use	c
it	i
to	c
steal	i
our	c
homes	c
,	c
take	i
advantage	c
from	i
the	c
indefense	i
people	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
the	c
technology	c
never	c
stops	c
,	c
we	c
always	c
search	c
new	i
things	c
because	c
we	c
are	c
made	c
to	c
compete	c
,	c
discover	c
,	c
think	c
things	i
which	c
we	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
.	c

Dear	c
Ms	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
was	c
glad	c
to	c
win	c
your	c
competition	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
.	c

Because	c
it	c
is	c
the	c
only	c
free	i
time	i
I	i
will	i
have	i
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
chance	i
to	c
do	c
two	c
activities	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
tennis	c
is	c
the	c
best	c
sport	c
I	c
have	c
ever	c
plaed	i
.	c

Another	c
activity	c
what	i
I	c
have	c
chosen	c
is	c
photography	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
very	c
interesting	c
and	c
enjoing	i
.	c

For	c
example	c
:	c
Maraya	c
Kary	c
,	c
Tom	c
Jone	c
;	c
Madonna	c
.	c

I	c
saw	c
the	c
"	c
Boys	c
on	c
"	c
.	c

Look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

Love	c
,	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
.	c

Not	c
that	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
disappointed	c
not	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
good	c
actors	c
!	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
this	c
evening	c
was	c
very	c
far	c
to	i
be	i
perfect	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
ask	c
you	c
for	c
my	c
money	c
,	c
I	i
spent	c
for	i
this	c
horrible	c
evening	c
in	c
your	c
theatre	c
,	c
back	c
.	c

Internet	i
is	c
a	c
good	c
way	c
of	c
meeting	c
people	c
that	c
are	c
far	c
from	c
us	c
,	c
we	c
can	c
also	c
inform	c
ourselves	c
on	i
what	c
happens	i
in	c
live	i
,	c
or	c
search	c
for	c
special	i
leisure	i
with	i
a	c
quick	c
result	c
.	c

But	c
firstly	c
I	i
want	c
to	c
congratulate	c
you	c
for	i
organizing	c
such	c
a	c
huge	c
festival	c
,	c
people	c
need	c
this	c
kind	c
of	c
events	i
.	c

Plays	i
and	c
Films	i
were	c
good	c
and	c
I	c
liked	c
them	c
,	c
but	c
there	c
were	c
only	c
a	c
few	c
,	c
I	c
hope	c
there	c
will	c
be	c
many	c
more	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

Anyway	c
,	c
I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
coming	c
to	c
your	c
festival	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Some	c
can	c
find	c
it	c
boring	c
but	c
it	c
is	c
well-paid	c
and	c
not	c
too	c
tiring	c
.	c

Another	c
solution	c
could	c
be	c
working	c
as	c
a	c
barman	c
,	c
the	c
problem	c
is	c
that	c
you	c
go	c
to	c
bed	c
very	c
late	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
's	c
very	c
exciting	c
because	c
you	c
meet	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
people	c
and	c
enjoy	c
your	c
night	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
the	c
well	i
organised	i
programme	c
you	c
have	c
done	i
.	c

The	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
show	i
is	c
an	c
amaizing	i
show	c
because	c
there	c
are	c
parades	i
with	c
the	c
latest	c
fashions	c
,	i
we	i
could	c
know	i
some	c
famous	c
top	c
models	c
Besides	i
there	c
are	i
a	c
variety	c
of	c
clothes	c
either	i
sport	i
wear	i
as	i
elegant	i
desings	i
.	c

Not	i
only	i
we	c
could	c
see	c
the	c
latest	c
trend	c
in	c
make-up	c
but	i
hairstyles	i
performed	i
by	i
important	i
coiffeurs	i
.	c

Many	c
thanks	c
again	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	i
,	c

I	c
joined	c
with	i
an	c
expedition	c
team	i
in	c
order	c
to	c
explore	c
the	c
Rocky	c
Mountains	c
.	c

We	c
arrived	c
to	i
the	c
place	i
in	c
the	c
morning	c
and	c
started	c
to	c
walk	c
.	c

The	c
weather	c
was	c
delightful	c
,	c
except	c
this	i
afternoon	c
when	c
started	i
to	c
rain	c
and	c
we	c
decide	i
to	c
stay	c
during	i
the	c
night	c
inside	c
a	c
hole	c
in	c
the	c
wall	i
of	c
the	c
mountain	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
terrified	c
,	c
I	c
knew	c
that	c
the	c
only	c
solution	c
was	c
to	c
ask	c
for	c
helping	i
.	c

and	i
my	c
partners	i
were	c
successfully	c
rescued	c
.	c

Although	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
was	c
there	c
,	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
to	c
see	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
.	c

I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
explain	c
too	c
that	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
see	c
that	i
you	c
made	i
discounts	i
to	c
no	i
one	i
.	c

I	c
was	c
queuing	c
for	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
and	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
see	c
it	c
.	i

And	c
we	c
were	c
very	c
hungry	c
after	c
being	c
three	c
hours	c
in	c
the	c
theatre	c
.	c

And	c
that	i
are	c
all	c
problems	i
I	c
found	i
.	c

Yours	c
,	c

We	c
went	c
at	i
the	c
same	c
school	c
and	c
at	i
the	c
same	c
class	c
.	c

I	c
liked	c
a	c
boy	c
who	c
was	c
in	c
the	c
same	c
class	c
.	c

I	c
told	c
her	c
that	c
and	c
she	c
assured	c
me	c
that	c
she	c
would	c
n't	c
say	c
it	i
to	c
him	c
.	c

When	c
we	c
finished	c
our	i
primary	c
school	c
we	c
went	c
at	i
the	c
same	c
secundary	i
school	c
too	c
,	c
but	c
we	c
were	c
in	c
different	c
classes	c
.	c

I	c
spend	i
five	c
years	c
there	c
,	c
although	c
I	c
came	c
all	i
summers	i
and	c
we	c
continued	c
going	c
out	c
as	c
we	c
did	i
before	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
finished	c
I	c
return	i
to	c
my	c
city	c
to	c
find	c
a	c
job	c
.	c

A	i
day	c
,	c
Pat	c
told	c
me	c
that	c
we	i
was	c
talking	c
with	c
this	c
boy	c
and	c
that	c
he	c
told	c
her	c
that	c
I	i
like	i
him	i
and	c
immediately	c
she	c
told	c
him	c
that	c
he	i
liked	c
me	i
too	c
.	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
a	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
.	c

And	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
appreciate	c
if	i
you	c
give	i
me	c
a	c
refund	c
.	c

What	c
will	c
clothes	c
be	c
like	c
100	c
years	c
from	c
now	c
?	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
the	c
clothes	c
will	c
be	c
more	c
colourful	c
,	c
funny	i
and	c
confortable	i
.	c

People	c
will	c
prefer	c
to	c
use	i
confortable	i
clothes	c
,	c
even	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
office	c
.	c

The	c
clothes	c
will	c
be	c
more	c
colourful	c
and	c
consequently	c
more	c
funny	i
.	c

We	c
will	c
not	c
use	i
black	c
clothes	c
as	c
we	c
are	i
used	c
to	c
do	i
.	c

This	c
way	c
,	c
people	c
tend	c
to	c
be	c
happier	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
the	c
clothes	c
will	c
not	c
be	c
as	i
teenagers	i
use	i
to	i
wear	i
nowadays	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
"	c
raves	c
"	c
.	c

Mainly	c
,	c
people	c
will	c
not	c
be	c
so	c
fashionable	c
as	c
they	c
are	c
nowadays	c
.	c

Now	c
all	c
the	c
town	c
knew	i
my	c
secret	c
.	c

This	c
is	c
a	c
very	c
embarrassed	i
situation	c
.	c

My	c
god	c
,	c
I	c
never	c
should	c
have	c
told	c
my	c
sister	c
this	c
secret	c
.	c

We	c
come	i
here	c
to	c
build	c
our	c
own	c
house	c
because	c
my	c
father	c
had	c
been	c
fired	c
and	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
sell	c
our	c
house	c
in	c
Buenos	c
Aires	c
.	c

My	c
mother	c
suggested	c
to	i
come	i
here	c
because	c
one	c
of	c
her	c
brothers	c
was	c
established	c
here	c
and	c
he	c
could	c
help	c
us	c
.	c

I	c
never	i
had	c
a	c
boyfriend	c
and	c
I	c
felt	i
in	c
love	c
with	c
him	c
.	c

One	c
day	c
in	c
the	c
,	i
he	c
kissed	c
me	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
wonderful	c
.	c

We	c
made	c
love	c
...	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
express	c
my	c
pleasure	c
about	c
the	c
successful	i
programme	c
that	c
you	c
have	c
prepared	c
for	c
our	c
school	c
,	c
especially	c
the	c
excellent	c
idea	c
to	c
visit	c
the	c
National	c
Art	c
Gallery	c
.	c

We	c
are	c
really	c
interested	c
in	c
latest	i
fashions	c
and	c
new	c
hairstyles	c
,	c
but	i
also	c
we	c
are	c
keen	c
on	c
knowing	c
about	c
leisure	c
and	c
sports	c
clothes	c
and	c
especially	i
girls	i
enjoy	c
seeing	c
the	c
different	c
kinds	c
of	c
making	i
up	i
.	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
we	c
have	c
been	c
informed	c
that	c
students	c
are	c
allowed	c
to	c
see	i
this	c
exhibition	c
without	i
paying	i
money	i
.	c

If	c
you	c
agree	c
to	c
visit	i
this	i
exhibition	c
,	c
we	c
will	c
spend	c
our	i
day	c
there	c
,	c
thus	c
we	c
should	c
cancel	c
the	c
shopping	c
,	c
but	c
we	c
will	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
purchase	c
some	c
presents	c
next	i
day	c
,	c
as	c
you	c
have	c
not	c
organised	c
a	c
specific	c
plan	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
your	c
answer	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

I	c
decided	c
to	c
stay	c
at	c
home	c
and	c
listen	c
to	c
music	c
.	c

While	c
I	c
was	c
listening	c
to	c
my	c
favourite	c
cassette	c
,	c
I	c
heard	c
a	c
strange	c
noise	c
.	c

Immediately	c
I	c
opened	c
my	c
door	c
and	c
...	c

A	c
short	c
man	c
stood	i
in	c
front	c
of	c
me	c
!	c

I	c
shouted	c
as	c
I	i
pained	i
.	c

I	c
realised	c
that	c
he	c
was	c
very	c
strong	c
.	c

I	c
ran	c
quickly	c
and	c
I	c
managed	c
to	c
escape	c
from	c
him	c
,	c
I	c
found	c
one	i
hidden	c
wooden	c
spoon	c
and	c
while	c
he	c
was	c
passing	c
in	c
front	c
of	c
me	c
I	c
hit	c
him	c
.	c

To	c
my	c
relief	c
I	c
managed	c
to	c
survive	c
!	c

The	c
reasons	c
why	c
I	c
was	c
disappointed	c
were	i
:	i

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
was	c
not	c
there	c
,	i
I	c
was	c
very	c
upset	c
because	c
he	c
is	c
my	c
favorite	i
singer	c
and	c
it	i
was	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
reasons	c
why	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
see	c
this	c
show	c
.	c

My	c
Euro	c
Star	c
was	c
at	c
22	i
pm.	i
As	c
you	c
can	c
see	c
,	c
I	c
missed	c
my	c
train	c
to	c
go	c
back	c
to	c
Paris	c
.	c

On	i
the	i
developpement	i
,	c
they	c
also	c
said	c
that	c
they	i
will	i
be	c
a	c
discount	c
for	c
students	c
who	c
are	c
between	c
eighteen	c
and	c
twenty-five	c
years	c
old	c
but	c
it	i
was	c
totally	c
wrong	c
because	c
I	c
paid	c
the	c
full	c
price	c
which	i
was	c
£	c
20	c
.	c

The	i
modern	i
technology	c
has	c
changed	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
a	c
lot	c
.	c

Some	c
of	c
my	c
friends	c
live	c
in	i
overseas	c
,	i
we	i
keep	c
in	c
touch	c
by	i
e-mails	c
,	i
it	i
is	c
a	c
very	c
good	c
way	c
for	i
communicating	i
because	c
it	c
is	c
much	c
cheaper	c
than	c
a	c
phone	c
call	c
and	c
we	c
can	c
re-read	c
mails	i
and	c
keep	c
them	c
forever	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
one	c
too	c
!	c

It	c
is	c
very	c
useful	c
for	c
several	c
reasons	c
:	c

when	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
call	c
someone	c
,	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
need	c
to	c
look	c
after	i
a	c
phone	c
box	c
.	i

people	c
can	c
phone	c
me	c
at	c
anytime	i
they	c
want	c
from	c
everywhere	i

We	c
can	c
watch	c
TV	c
,	i
there	i
is	c
also	c
a	c
map	c
so	c
when	c
we	c
get	c
lost	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
very	c
east	i
to	c
find	i
out	i
the	i
place	i
.	c

As	i
a	i
conclusion	i
,	c
I	c
agree	c
that	c
modern	c
technology	c
has	c
changed	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
but	c
I	c
am	c
sure	c
that	c
in	i
the	c
future	c
,	c
my	c
life	c
will	c
not	c
be	c
the	c
same	c
as	c
now	c
because	c
more	c
modern	c
technology	c
will	c
appear	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writting	i
in	c
order	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
"	c
.	c

At	i
first	i
,	c
the	c
advertisement	c
said	c
that	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
starring	c
by	i
Tina	c
Truelove	c
and	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	i
that	i
was	c
not	c
true	c
,	i
Danny	c
Brook	c
did	c
not	c
act	c
in	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
it	i
was	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
and	c
I	c
got	i
disappointed	c
with	c
him	c
.	c

The	c
advertisement	c
said	c
that	c
there	c
were	c
discounts	c
available	c
,	i
that	i
was	c
false	c
,	c
there	c
were	i
not	c
any	c
kind	c
of	c
discounts	i
.	c

They	c
had	c
closed	c
it	c
because	c
they	c
had	c
found	c
the	c
food	c
in	c
bad	i
conditions	i
.	c

Just	c
to	c
finish	c
,	c
the	c
advertisement	c
said	c
that	c
the	c
show	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
,	c
let	c
me	c
tell	c
that	i
it	c
was	i
n't	i
not	c
.	c

I	c
paid	c
a	i
full	i
ticket	c
without	c
discounts	i
to	c
wait	c
45	c
minutes	c
,	c
to	c
see	c
a	c
musical	c
show	c
with	c
a	c
bad	c
actor	c
and	c
after	c
all	c
could	i
not	c
have	c
a	c
sandwich	c
because	c
the	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
.	c

Technology	c
.	c

The	i
technology	i
has	c
changed	c
,	c
is	c
changing	c
and	c
it	c
will	c
change	c
our	c
daily	c
lifes	i
.	c

More	c
and	c
more	c
people	c
are	c
connecting	c
through	i
the	c
net	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
so	c
disappointed	c
.	c

The	c
most	c
important	c
development	c
is	c
the	c
internet	i
system	i
which	i
is	c
connected	c
to	c
the	c
whole	c
world	c
's	c
computers	c
by	c
some	i
telephone	c
liens	i
.	c

How	c
convenience	i
it	c
is	c
!	c

There	c
are	c
also	c
much	i
more	c
advantages	c
,	i
you	i
can	c
buy	c
somethings	i
in	c
a	c
supermarket	c
by	i
only	i
a	i
mail	i
order	i
,	i
you	i
do	c
n't	c
need	c
to	c
go	i
out	i
of	i
your	c
home	c
.	c

Some	c
modern	c
technology	c
is	c
also	c
put	i
into	i
the	i
transport	i
system	i
.	c

The	i
modern	i
technology	c
has	c
changed	c
our	c
daily	c
life	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
think	c
the	c
changes	c
are	c
good	c
.	c

Then	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
late	c
,	i
we	c
had	c
been	c
waiting	c
for	c
a	c
long	c
long	c
time	c
before	c
it	c
started	c
.	c

Danny	c
Brook	c
was	c
n't	c
on	c
the	c
stage	c
!	c

I	c
would	c
weep	c
if	c
I	c
was	c
n't	c
so	c
angry	c
.	c

To	c
summarize	c
I	i
want	c
that	i
you	c
hang	i
me	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
and	c
very	c
quickly	c
.	c

How	c
has	c
modern	c
technology	c
changed	c
your	c
daily	c
life	c
?	c

Let	c
's	c
take	c
the	c
mobil	i
phone	c
.	c

Nowadays	c
everybody	c
has	c
got	c
a	c
phone	c
which	c
is	c
"	c
mobil	i
"	c
.	c

And	c
I	c
'm	c
not	i
different	c
I	i
've	c
got	c
one	c
and	c
it	c
has	c
changed	c
my	c
everyday	c
life	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
writting	i
this	c
letter	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
your	c
fake	i
advertisement	c
.	c

You	c
are	c
the	c
theatre	c
's	c
manager	c
so	c
I	c
suppose	c
you	c
are	c
the	c
right	c
person	c
to	c
complain	c
.	i

But	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
has	i
started	i
and	c
that	c
was	c
very	c
disappointing	c
not	i
only	c
for	c
me	c
but	c
for	c
all	c
people	i
there	c
.	c

The	c
show	c
has	i
begun	i
later	i
,	c
much	c
more	i
later	i
than	c
your	c
advertisement	c
writes	i
,	c
at	c
about	c
20:15	c
.	c

The	c
show	c
started	c
45	c
minutes	c
later	i
.	c

This	c
made	c
me	c
get	i
bored	c
.	c

At	c
the	c
end	c
you	c
have	i
written	i
that	c
there	i
is	i
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
after	i
the	c
show	c
but	c
there	i
was	c
n't	c
.	c

It	c
had	i
closed	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
late	c
start	c
of	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

Usually	c
When	i
I	c
return	c
from	c
school	c
the	c
food	c
is	c
a	c
lit	i
of	i
bit	c
cold	c
so	c
I	c
put	c
it	c
in	c
the	c
microwave	c
to	c
become	i
hotter	i
.	c

When	c
I	c
go	c
to	c
sleep	c
after	c
I	c
eat	c
my	c
lunch	c
in	i
my	c
country	c
especially	i
in	c
summer	c
is	i
too	c
hot	c
.	i

At	i
the	c
evenings	c
before	c
I	c
got	i
to	c
bed	c
I	c
sit	c
in	c
the	c
living	c
room	c
and	c
watch	c
TV	c
through	i
the	i
sattelite	i
.	c

I	c
belive	i
that	c
modern	c
technology	c
has	c
effected	i
possitive	i
our	c
lives	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
really	c
pleased	c
hearing	i
from	c
you	c
,	i
I	c
won	c
the	c
prize	c
.	c

It	c
must	c
be	c
great	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
very	i
enjoying	c
playing	c
tennis	c
.	c

I	c
wonder	c
which	c
clothes	c
are	c
suitable	c
for	c
your	c
camping	c
.	c

And	c
How	c
about	c
the	c
money	c
?	c

We	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
this	c
London	c
trip	c
and	c
your	c
programme	c
related	i
to	i
it	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
really	i
good	c
programme	c
,	c
especially	i
visiting	c
Science	i
Museum	c
and	c
National	i
Art	c
Gallery	c
would	c
be	c
great	i
opportunity	c
to	c
learn	c
about	c
art	c
and	c
latest	i
improvements	i
in	c
science	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
my	c
classmates	c
and	c
I	c
saw	c
the	c
advertisement	c
with	i
regarding	c
the	c
London	c
fashion	c
and	c
leisure	c
show	c
,	c
which	c
is	c
enclosed	c
,	c
and	c
want	c
to	c
take	c
this	c
opportunity	c
to	c
visit	c
it	c
,	c
if	c
you	c
allow	c
us	c
.	c

It	c
will	c
be	c
great	i
opportunity	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
free	c
for	c
students	c
and	c
we	c
will	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
latest	c
fashions	c
in	c
leisure	c
and	c
sports	c
wear	c
,	c
new	c
hairstyles	c
and	c
make	i
up	i
industry	i
.	c

Would	c
it	c
be	c
possible	c
to	c
visit	c
Science	i
Museum	c
and	c
go	c
shopping	c
in	c
our	c
free	c
time	c
on	c
Wednesday	c
in	c
the	c
afternoon	c
,	c
instead	i
of	c
it	i
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
London	c
fashion	c
and	c
leisure	c
show	c
,	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
between	c
10.00	c
and	c
19.00	c
hours	c
.	c

We	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
relating	i
to	i
this	c
matter	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

In	c
order	c
to	c
fullfill	i
their	c
readers	c
'	c
requirements	c
they	c
always	i
follow	c
them	c
.	c

This	c
kind	c
of	c
people	c
are	c
known	c
as	c
paparazzi	c
.	c

Do	c
they	c
have	c
to	c
ask	c
for	c
their	c
permission	c
or	c
not	c
.	i

However	c
,	c
if	c
they	c
would	i
ask	i
,	c
obviously	c
they	c
can	i
not	i
take	c
the	c
kind	c
of	c
pictures	c
,	i
which	c
show	c
them	c
naked	c
or	c
when	c
they	c
are	c
having	c

Because	c

althoug	i

Dear	c
Sirs	c
,	c

I	c
cannot	c
express	c
how	c
happy	c
I	c
was	c
reading	c
your	c
letter	c
about	c
the	c
prize	c
I	c
won	c
and	c
about	c
2	c
wonderful	c
weeks	c
I	c
am	c
going	c
to	c
spend	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
in	c
the	c
USA	c
.	c

If	c
possible	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
avoid	c
tents	c
if	c
possible	c
.	c

You	c
offered	c
me	c
a	c
really	c
wide	c
range	c
of	c
activities	c
to	c
choose	c
from	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
would	c
have	c
to	c
go	c
for	c
basketball	c
and	c
tennis	c
.	c

I	c
can	c
say	c
it	c
with	c
confidence	c
that	c
I	c
am	c
quite	c
good	c
at	c
basketball	c
-	c
I	c
play	c
it	c
for	c
my	c
school	c
's	c
team	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
going	c
to	c
train	c
it	i
in	c
August	c
as	c
well	c
-	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
want	c
to	c
loose	i
touch	c
with	c
it	c
.	c

Does	c
it	c
rain	c
a	c
lot	c
there	c
?	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
and	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
wait	c
going	i
to	c
USA	i

Yours	c

"	c
Shopping	c

enjoyable	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
like	c
and	c
do	c
n't	c
enjoy	c
spending	c
endless	c
hours	c
pushing	c
my	c
trolley	c
(	c
which	c
,	c
by	c
the	c

has	c
it	i

own	c
idea	c
of	c
where	c
it	c
want	i
's	i
to	c
go	c

between	c

desperate	c
people	i

just	c
to	c
find	c
that	c
perfect	c

a	i

Secondly	c
,	c
if	c
you	c
happen	c
to	c
forget	c
something	c
,	c
you	c
will	c
have	c
to	c
force	c
your	c
way	c
back	c
through	c

of	c
other	c
shoppers	c

and	c
that	c
can	c

up	c

time	c

the	c

Dear	c
Mr.	c
Robertson	c
,	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
your	c
programme	c
but	i
we	c
have	c
another	c
plan	c
to	i
go	c
to	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
which	i
unluckily	i
on	i
the	c
same	c
day	c
as	c
the	c
day	c
we	c
would	c
visit	c
the	c
Science	c
Museum	i
so	i
we	c
would	c
like	c
you	c
to	c
change	c
the	c
plan	c
a	c
little	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
dangerous	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
knew	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
climed	i
up	c
the	c
tree	c
.	c

My	c
friend	c
was	c
looking	c
at	c
me	c
from	c
below	c
.	c

No	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
the	c
time	c
to	c
regret	c
,	i
just	c
get	c
it	c
and	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
all	c
over	c
.	c

I	c
stressed	i
my	c
arm	c
,	c
the	c
branch	c
I	c
was	c
standing	c
on	c
broke	c
and	c
I	c
fell	c
down	c
on	c
my	c
leg	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
very	i
hurt	c
,	i
my	i
friend	c
rushed	c
to	c
me	c
than	i
ran	c
back	c
to	c
my	c
house	c
and	c
called	c
Mom	i
.	c

Mom	i
came	c
in	c
,	c
looking	c
very	c
angry	c
,	i
I	c
prayed	c
for	c
a	c
short	c
conversation	c
.	c

Svetlana	c

I	c
should	c
n't	c
have	c
told	c
her	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
was	c
so	c
sure	c
she	c
would	c
n't	c
tell	c
anyone	c
.	c

People	c
started	c
to	c
whrite	i
things	c
on	c
the	c
board	c
and	c
pointing	i
at	c
me	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

Firstly	c
,	c
the	c
play	c
started	c
nearly	c
an	c
hour	c
later	c
as	i
I	c
expected	c
!	c

Finished	i
the	c
show	c
,	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
and	c
this	c
has	i
n't	i
been	c
said	c
before	c
.	c

A	c
suggestion	c
?	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

Technology	c
is	c
a	c
wide	c
field	c
which	c
increases	i
very	c
quickly	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
creating	c
an	c
artificial	c
world	c
,	c
where	c
everything	c
is	c
electronic	c
and	c
fast	c
.	c

Certainly	c
,	c
thanks	c
to	c
it	c
,	c
we	c
can	c
do	c
things	c
today	c
that	c
were	c
impossible	c
a	c
few	c
centuries	c
ago	c
.	c

Nowadays	c
,	c
we	c
make	i
a	c
phone	c
call	c
with	c
an	c
astonish	i
rapidity	c
,	c
instead	i
at	i
my	c
grandparents	c
'	c
time	c
it	c
took	c
one	c
month	c
or	c
more	c
to	c
have	i
contact	i
with	c
people	c
abroad	c
,	c
because	c
the	c
only	c
means	c
of	c
communication	c
was	c
the	c
post	c
and	c
its	c
service	c
was	c
very	c
slow	c
!	c

Before	c
that	c
,	c
people	c
travelled	c
by	c
horse	c
or	c
worse	c
.	c

Fortunately	c
today	c
everyone	c
can	c
take	c
an	c
aeroplane	c
and	c
go	c
to	c
America	c
,	c
Australia	c
or	c
wherever	c
else	c
he	i
wants	i
!	c

It	c
allows	c
us	c
to	c
keep	i
connections	c
with	c
the	c
other	c
states	c
of	c
the	c
world	c
,	c
improves	c
our	c
knowledge	c
,	c
offers	c
us	c
news	c
,	c
advises	c
us	c
about	c
events	c
which	c
happened	i
or	c
will	c
happen	c
.	c

In	c
the	i
not	c
very	c
far	i
1914	i
,	c
parent	i
sent	c
their	c
sons	c
in	i
war	c
and	c
it	c
was	c
very	c
difficult	c
to	c
know	c
if	c
they	c
were	c
still	c
alive	c
or	c
dead	c
!	c

It	c
's	c
terrible	c
!	c

Finally	c
,	c
everyone	c
should	c
decrease	i
his	c
own	c
life	c
's	c
rythm	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
this	c
letter	c
to	c
complaint	i
about	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
that	c
Circle	i
Theatre	c
company	c
played	i
few	i
days	c
ago	c
.	c

Anything	i
the	c
advertisement	c
said	c
was	c
correctly	i
done	i
.	c

It	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
fault	i
of	c
responsability	i
for	c
a	c
theatre	c
like	c
yours	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
delay	c
like	c
this	c
one	c
.	c

He	c
was	c
not	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
and	c
the	c
main	c
reason	c
that	c
I	c
came	i
to	c
see	c
this	c
show	c
was	c
the	c
possibility	i
to	c
see	c
him	c
acting	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
a	c
fan	c
of	c
him	i
.	c

When	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
get	c
the	c
ticket	c
,	c
and	c
the	c
women	i
said	i
me	c
that	c
the	c
discounts	c
were	c
not	c
available	c
I	c
knew	c
that	c
it	c
would	c
n't	c
be	c
a	c
good	c
night	c
.	c

Nobody	c
told	c
us	c
about	i
the	c
reasons	i
of	i
the	i
problems	c
.	c

These	c
are	c
the	c
reasons	c
why	c
I	c
am	c
complaining	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
if	c
there	c
will	c
be	c
some	i
money	i
back	i
.	c

Perhaps	c
,	c
modern	c
technology	c
has	c
changed	c
my	c
life	i
style	i
but	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
think	c
so	c
because	c
I	c
was	c
born	c
in	c
the	c
period	c
of	c
modern	c
developments	c
.	c

All	c
kind	i
of	c
industrial	c
machines	c
are	c
created	c
to	c
solve	c
problems	c
,	c
improve	c
other	c
machines	c
or	c
to	c
do	i
n't	i
waste	i
so	i
many	i
time	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
school	i
holliday	i
here	c
in	c
Portugal	c
and	c
I	c
will	c
have	c
the	c
entire	c
month	c
to	c
travel	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
have	c
no	c
preference	c
for	c
the	i
weeks	c
.	c

Daniela	c
.	c

The	c
cities	c
are	c
the	c
main	c
commercial	c
centre	i
,	c
our	c
streets	c
are	c
full	c
of	c
billboard	i
advertising	c
many	c
things	i
and	i
.	c

The	c
solution	c
can	i
be	c
in	i
a	i
alternative	i
way	i
of	i
making	i
shops	i
like	i
Internet	i

17th	c
June	c
2000	c

Dear	c
sir	i
or	i
madam	i
,	c

Firstly	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
actor	i
of	i
the	c
show	c
.	c

On	i
your	c
advertisement	c
you	c
say	c
that	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
are	c
starring	c
in	c
the	c
play	c
but	c
I	c
am	c
sure	c
that	c
they	c
never	c
appear	i
on	c
the	c
stage	c
that	c
night	c
.	c

Secondly	c
another	i
ploblem	i
was	c
about	i
the	c
starting	c
time	c
,	i
according	i
to	c
your	c
advertisement	c
the	i
play	c
starts	c
at	c
19.30	c
and	i
instead	c
it	c
started	c
on	i
20:15	c
,	c
this	c
is	c
about	i
almost	c
an	c
hour	i
delay	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
there	i
were	i
several	i
prices	i
about	i
the	i
tickets	i
and	i
an	i
available	i
discount	i
,	c
Something	i
that	c
was	c
n't	c
true	c
.	c

We	c
did	c
n't	c
get	c
any	c
discount	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
disappointed	c
about	i
the	c
whole	c
situation	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
not	c
happy	c
to	i
ask	c
for	c
a	c
money	c
refund	c
.	c

Looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Many	c
thinks	i
have	c
changed	c
within	c
the	c
last	c
100	c
years	c
.	c

Technology	c
-	c
along	c
with	c
science	c
-	c
has	c
made	c
huge	c
steps	c
and	c
has	c
turned	c
into	c
a	i
growing	i
monster	i
which	i
does	i
n't	i
have	i
an	i
ending	i
.	c

All	c
thease	i
play	c
a	i
serious	i
role	c
in	c
our	c
daily	c
life	c
with	i
out	i
ever	i
understanding	c
it	i
.	c

All	i
of	i
us	i
have	i
turned	c
into	c
pathetic	c
,	c
technological	c
,	i
robots	c
.	c

Those	c
things	c
can	c
and	c
do	c
make	c
our	c
lifes	i
easier	c
and	c
more	c
comfortable	c
,	c
but	c
the	i
call	i
us	c
away	c
from	c
our	c
friends	c
,	c
our	c
families	c
and	c
more	i
over	i
they	c
lead	c
us	c
to	c
madness	c
and	c
cut	c
any	i
relantionship	i
with	c
everything	c
that	c
suround	i
us	c
and	c
keep	i
us	c
in	i
life	i
.	c

Helen	c
Ryan	c

I	c
think	c
is	i
going	c
to	c
be	c
more	c
confortable	i
for	c
me	c
due	c
that	i
I'am	i
very	c
sensitive	c
to	c
changes	c
of	c
temperature	c
and	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
take	c
the	c
risk	c
to	i
catch	i
a	c
cold	c
as	i
you	c
know	c
I	i
'm	c
going	c
to	c
start	c
to	c
work	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
fine	c
and	c
I	c
writting	i
you	i
because	c
I	c
know	c
that	c
you	c
want	c
to	c
know	c
my	i
experience	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
;	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
that	c
I	c
did	c
to	i
help	i
there	c
and	c
was	i
a	i
very	c
hard	c
work	i
you	i
ca	c
n't	c
imagin	i
all	c
the	c
work	c
that	c
mean	i
to	i
prepare	i
a	c
concert	c
.	c

I	c
really	c
enjoyed	c
the	c
opportunity	c
to	c
talk	c
with	c
well	i
known	i
starts	i
and	c
to	c
learn	c
how	c
to	c
set	c
up	c
everything	c
for	c
a	c
concert	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
45	c
minutes	c
late	c
.	c

Everything	c
was	c
completely	c
different	c
from	c
what	c
you	c
had	c
announced	c
on	i
the	c
advertisement	c

I	c
am	c
sure	c
you	c
understand	c
why	c
I	c
am	c
so	c
upset	c
and	c
you	c
will	c
do	c
your	c
best	c
to	c
give	c
me	c
satisfaction	c
,	c
I	c
mean	c
,	c
refunding	c
me	c
exactly	c
what	c
I	c
had	i
paid	i
for	c
this	c
terrible	c
evening	c
.	c

Modern	c
technology	c
has	c
changed	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
,	c
making	c
it	c
easy	c
,	c
with	c
less	c
effort	c
and	c
time	c
spent	c
.	i

A	c
simple	c
example	c
,	c
we	c
can	c
at	i
the	c
same	c
time	c
wash	i
our	c
clothes	c
with	i
a	c
washing	c
machine	c
,	c
record	c
a	c
tv	i
program	i
and	c
talk	c
to	c
someone	c
on	c
the	c
other	c
side	c
of	c
the	c
world	c
.	c

We	c
can	c
take	c
care	c
of	c
whom	i
we	c
love	c
and	c
give	c
them	c
more	c
attention	c
,	i
time	c
is	c
not	c
a	i
really	i
problem	c
.	c

We	c
will	c
be	c
more	c
comprehensible	i
with	c
others	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
the	c
first	c
step	c
for	i
a	c
true	c
fraternity	c
.	c

All	c
this	c
modern	c
technology	c
increase	i
the	c
level	c
of	c
polluted	i
products	c
that	c
can	i
not	i
be	c
easily	c
destructed	i
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
modern	c
technology	c
allows	c
me	c
to	c
live	c
better	c
and	c
to	c
have	c
more	c
time	c
to	c
do	c
what	c
I	c
really	c
like	c
,	c
although	c
I	i
know	c
,	c
all	c
this	c
has	c
a	c
price	c
.	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
:	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
sending	c
me	c
this	c
wonderful	c
news	c
.	c

I	c
will	c
take	c
my	c
exams	c
in	c
June	c
and	c
have	c
the	c
result	i
in	c
August	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
prefer	c
staying	c
in	c
log	c
cabins	c
so	c
that	c
I	c
can	c
have	c
more	c
chance	i
to	c
be	c
with	c
other	c
people	c
,	c
then	c
I	c
can	c
make	c
more	c
friends	c
.	c

I	c
enjoy	c
singing	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
and	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
share	c
my	c
music	c
with	c
the	i
others	c
.	c

I	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
the	c
perfect	c
time	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
go	c
on	c
holiday	c
because	c
the	c
12th	c
July	i
is	c
my	c
birthday	c
.	c

You	c
also	c
asked	c
me	c
about	c
the	c
two	c
things	c
I	c
'm	c
good	c
at	c
,	i
well	i
,	c
the	c
first	c
one	c
is	c
basketball	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
been	c
playing	c
basketball	c
for	c
roughly	i
about	i
4	c
years	c
.	c

I	c
love	c
basketball	c
because	c
I	c
'm	c
good	c
at	c
it	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
my	c
favourite	c
sport	c
.	c

Last	c
of	c
all	c
I	c
have	c
questions	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
.	c

Looking	c
forward	c
to	c
see	i
you	c
soon	c
.	c

This	c
composition	c
is	c
about	c
shopping	c
.	c

This	c
statement	c
is	c
due	i
to	i
the	c
great	c
amount	c
of	c
rubbish	c
we	c
are	c
providing	i
for	i
the	c
world	c
.	c

The	c
more	c
stuff	c
we	c
buy	c
the	i
more	c
we	c
throw	c
away	c
.	c

Shopping	c
with	c
some	c
friends	c
may	c
be	c
fun	c
but	c
you	c
must	c
also	c
remember	c
that	c
you	c
are	c
spending	c
money	c
.	c

Therefor	i
you	c
should	c
think	c
more	c
carefully	c
about	c
what	c
you	c
are	c
about	c
to	c
buy	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
this	c
is	c
all	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
say	c
to	c
make	c
you	c
think	c
that	c
shopping	c
is	c
n't	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
and	c
change	c
your	c
view	i
in	i
looking	i
at	i
shopping	c
.	c

Firstly	c
I	c
would	c
lice	i
to	c
say	c
that	c
I	c
am	i
very	c
dissappointed	i
with	c
the	c
show	c
and	c
that	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
have	c
the	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
,	c
as	c
you	i
had	i
advertised	c
.	c

I	i
have	i
no	i
idea	i
from	i
where	i
to	i
start	i
.	c

His	c
act	i
was	c
not	c
good	c
and	c
he	c
did	c
n't	c
seem	c
like	i
acting	c
Even	i
my	c
son	c
could	c
act	c
better	c
.	c

After	c
the	c
horrible	i
act	i
of	c
your	c
star	c
,	c
it	i
comes	c
the	c
starting	c
ours	i
.	c

I	c
was	c
sitting	c
and	i
waiting	c
for	c
forty	i
five	i
minutes	c
until	c
the	c
play	c
started	c
.	c

You	c
advertise	c
that	c
the	c
show	c
begins	c
at	c
19.30	c
and	c
not	c
at	c
20:15	c
as	i
it	c
did	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
suppose	i
to	c
be	c
my	c
perfect	c
everning	i
out	c
.	c

In	c
Conclusion	i
I	i
'd	c
like	c
to	c
recoment	i
that	c
you	c
should	c
,	i
first	c
,	i
know	c
what	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
offer	c
and	c
the	i
advertising	i
it	c
.	c

Yours	c
sensirly	i

I	c
should	c
n't	c
have	c
told	c
her	c
that	c
my	c
dad	c
had	c
physcological	i
problems	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
hurt	c
inside	c
and	c
cried	c
till	c
my	c
tears	c
run	i
dry	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
n't	c
accept	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
leaving	i
in	i
a	c
lie	c
.	c

Now	c
in	i
the	c
age	c
of	c
seventeen	c
I	c
made	c
the	c
huge	c
mistake	c
to	i
say	i
,	i
this	c
problem	c
to	c
my	c
"	c
friend	c
"	c
Pat	c
.	c

Pat	c
started	c
shouting	c
and	c
screaming	c
,	c
saying	c
what	c
was	c
realy	i
going	c
on	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
realised	c
it	i
,	c
it	c
was	c
too	c
late	c
.	c

The	c
secret	c
was	i
revilied	i
.	c

And	c
now	c
I	c
try	c
to	c
help	c
my	c
brother	c
beaus	i
I	c
've	c
been	c
there	c
,	c
in	c
his	c
place	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
know	c
how	c
it	c
feels	c
.	c

13th	c
June	c

Is	c
there	i
the	c
time	c
I	c
request	c
available	c
?	c

Finally	c
,	c
can	c
you	c
tell	c
me	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
should	c
bring	c
with	c
,	i
and	c
how	c
much	c
spending	c
money	c
will	c
be	c
need	i
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Sometime	i
when	c
I	c
'm	c
boring	i
and	c
ca	c
n't	c
find	c
something	c
else	c
to	c
do	c
.	i

Hang	c
them	c
every	i
where	i
after	c
they	c
tried	i
and	i
that	i
was	i
not	c
suit	c
them	c
.	c

You	c
do	i
ca	c
n't	c
find	c
some	i
where	i
to	c
sit	c
down	c
comfortaly	i
to	c
have	c
a	c
cup	c
of	c
tea	c
.	c

Donnals	c
,	c
K.F.C	c
,	c
the	i
all	c
full	c
of	c
people	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
shopping	c
is	c
nice	i
to	c
spend	c
you	i
leisure	c
time	c
and	c
give	c
yourself	c
to	i
relax	c
sometimes	c
,	c
but	c
suggest	i
that	c
never	i
in	i
the	c
weekend	c
.	c

According	c
to	c
your	c
advertisement	c
,	c
it	c
stars	c
DANNY	c
BROOK	c
AND	i
TINA	c
TRUELOVE	c
,	c
but	c
surprisinggly	i
,	c
it	i
was	i
proformed	i
by	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
who	i
I	c
even	i
did	i
n't	i
know	c
the	c
name	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	i
be	i
started	i
at	c
19:30	c
but	c
it	c
was	i
half	c
hour	i
later	c
,	c
until	i
20:15	c
.	c

You	c
can	c
imagine	c
how	c
disappointed	c
I	c
am	i
when	i
spending	c
money	c
on	c
such	c
a	c
terrible	c
evening	c
.	c

The	c
first	c
and	c
most	c
important	c
thing	c
is	c
that	c
modern	c
technology	c
have	i
made	c
our	c
life	c
easier	c
,	c
for	c
instance	c
ricer	i
cooker	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
invention	c
,	c
all	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
do	c
is	c
putting	i
rice	c
on	i
it	c
and	c
switch	c
on	i
,	c
it	c
makes	c
cooking	c
more	c
effeciently	i
.	c

Mr	c
Smith	c
,	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
really	c
disappointed	i
evening	c
!	c

Then	c
,	c
the	c
actors	c
(	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
)	c
who	c
were	c
mentioned	c
and	i
supposed	i
to	c
play	i
were	c
n't	c
present	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
on	i
the	c
advertisement	c
I	c
got	c
,	c
was	i
written	c
that	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
opened	i
.	c

As	c
you	c
can	c
notice	i
,	c
my	i
perfect	c
evening	c
I	c
had	c
supposed	i
,	i
was	c
a	c
nightmare	c
;	c
that	c
's	c
why	c
I	c
would	c
please	i
you	i
to	i
give	i
my	i
money	c
back	c
because	c
I	c
cannot	c
tolerate	c
such	c
a	c
thing	c
!	c

From	c
the	c
begining	i
of	c
the	c
century	c
to	c
now	c
,	c
modern	c
technology	c
has	c
changed	c
and	c
has	c
made	c
our	c
daily	c
life	c
easier	c
.	c

Indeed	c
,	c
the	i
modernism	i
helps	c
us	c
to	c
lead	c
a	c
confortable	i
and	c
better	c
life	c
than	c
before	c
.	c

A	c
few	c
centuries	c
ago	c
,	c
it	c
took	c
many	c
hours	c
(	c
even	c
several	c
days	c
)	c
to	c
go	c
to	i
a	i
city	c
to	c
an	i
other	i
one	i
or	c
to	c
travel	c
abroad	c
.	c

The	i
communication	i
has	c
made	c
many	c
progresses	i
too	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
a	c
revolution	c
,	c
something	c
which	c
was	c
unbelievable	c
a	c
few	c
centuries	c
ago	c
.	c

Although	c
there	c
are	c
new	c
machines	c

the	i

Hi	c
Kim	c
,	c

I	c
could	c
n't	c
write	c
you	i
because	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
busy	c
.	c

Last	c
month	c
I	c
enjoyed	c
helping	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
in	c
my	c
town	c
.	c

You	c
know	c
everybody	c
has	c
to	c
cross	c
this	c
spot	c
!	c

You	c
can	c
imagine	c
how	c
disappointed	c
I	c
was	c
.	c

But	c
it	c
turned	c
out	c
as	i
a	c
funny	i
and	c
interesting	c
job	c
.	c

It	i
means	i
I	c
had	c
to	c
read	c
the	c
recipies	i
very	c
carefully	c
.	c

On	i
the	i
other	i
hand	i
I	c
had	c
a	c
lot	c
to	c
do	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
never	c
bored	c
.	c

The	c
people	c
were	c
all	c
really	c
funny	c
and	c
we	c
were	c
a	c
good	c
team	c
.	c

The	c
time	c
was	i
quickly	c
over	i
and	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
great	c
experience	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
interested	c
to	c
hear	c
about	c
your	c
new	c
dog	c
?	c

Your	c
friend	c
,	c

Artemis	c

I	i
've	i
attened	i
your	c
shown	i
on	i
one	c
of	i
the	i
evening	c
,	c
during	c
my	c
stay	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

In	c
your	c
advertisement	c
you	c
've	c
mention	c
"	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
"	c
would	c
be	c
starring	c
and	c
as	c
it	c
turned	c
out	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
different	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
.	c

For	c
Example	c
there	c
were	c
no	c
discounts	c
available	c
and	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
were	i
closed	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
when	c
it	c
was	c
mean	i
to	c
be	c
open	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
acording	i
to	c
the	c
advertisement	c
but	c
was	i
closed	c
dure	i
to	c
the	c
delay	c
of	i
the	c
preformane	i
.	c

Lastly	c
your	i
advertisement	c
mention	i
clearly	c
that	c
this	c
would	c
be	c
"	c
Your	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
!	c
"	c
but	c
sadly	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
real	c
waste	c
of	c
time	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

And	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
a	c
refun	i
,	i
You	c
have	c
wasted	c
my	c
evening	c
and	c
money	c
.	c

Synethetic	i

by	c
scientis	i

Clothes	c
are	c
now	c
mass	i
producted	i
and	c
desing	i
by	c
desingers	i
.	c

It	c
is	c
hard	c
to	c
imageine	i
what	c
people	c
would	i
were	i
in	c
100	c
years	i
time	c
,	c
because	c
since	c
the	c
1900's	i
clothes	c
have	c
reduce	i
into	i
smaller	i
item	i
and	i
more	i
preticle	i
.	c

May	i
be	i
it	i
would	i
contine	i
reduceing	i
in	i
100	i
years	i
to	i
come	i
.	c

You	c
ask	c
me	c
for	c
some	c
informations	i
-	c
here	c
they	i
are	i
.	c

First	c
I	c
can	c
do	i
the	i
travel	c
only	c
in	c
July	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
get	c
freetime	i
in	c
any	c
other	c
month	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
want	c
to	c
sleep	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
'm	c
afraid	c
of	c
snakes	c
and	c
similar	c
animals	c
.	c

Another	c
thing	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
try	c
,	c
if	c
possible	c
,	c
is	c
to	c
play	c
Golf	i
.	c

I	c
'm	c
a	c
beginner	c
in	i
Golf	i
you	c
have	c
to	c
know	c
.	c

Now	c
a	c
question	c
from	c
me	c
to	c
you	c
:	c
Is	i
it	c
possible	c
to	c
pay	c
the	i
different	c
things	c
with	i
credit-card	i
?	c

Another	c
question	c
-	c
what	c
sorts	i
of	c
clothes	c
shall	c
I	c
bring	c
with	c
me	c
?	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hear	i
from	c
you	c
,	c

yours	c
sincerely	i

I	c
was	c
so	c
happy	c
when	c
they	c
told	i
me	c
to	c
help	c
them	c
with	c
the	c
organisation	c
.	c

We	c
arrived	c
at	c
home	c
early	c
in	c
the	c
morning	c
-	c
it	c
was	c
great	c
.	c

Now	c
Kim	c
,	c
I	c
will	c
finish	c
my	c
letter	c
but	c
I	c
promise	c
you	i
to	c
write	c
again	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c
,	i
maybe	i
if	c
I	c
've	c
developed	c
the	c
photos	c
of	c
the	c
concert	c
and	c
the	c
stars	c
and	c
the	c
.	c

A	c
good	c
idea	c
at	i
least	i
-	c
you	c
come	c
here	c
and	c
I	c
tell	i
you	c
some	c
other	c
story	i

The	c
advertisement	c
provided	c
false	c
information	c
,	c
e.g.	c
the	c
names	c
of	c
the	c

were	c
incorrect	c
-	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
was	c
not	c
performing	c

I	c
have	c
to	c
say	c
,	c
this	c
fact	c
disappointed	c
me	c
very	c
much	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
started	c

This	c
made	i
my	c
life	c
easier	c

and	c
at	c
the	c

time	c
saved	i
some	c

When	c
I	c
am	c
too	c
tied	i
to	c
go	c
out	c

want	c
to	c
meet	c
some	c
new	c
people	c
,	c
computer	c
technology	c
provides	c
me	c
with	c
this	i
opportunity	c
.	c

This	c
leaves	c
me	c
wondering	c
how	c
beneficial	c
its	c
influence	c
is	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
request	c
your	c
permission	c
for	c
us	c
to	c
visit	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
on	c
14th	c
March	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
say	c
thank	c
to	i
you	c
for	c
this	c
good	c
programme	c
,	c
especially	c
the	i
decision	c
of	i
going	i
to	c
visit	c
in	i
London	c
.	c

All	c
of	c
us	c
is	i
appreciated	i
that	i
we	i
could	i
have	i
this	c
opportunity	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
we	c
would	c
be	c
grateful	c
if	c
you	c
would	c
arrange	c
a	c
time	c
to	c
visit	c
the	c
show	c
additionally	i
.	c

In	i
this	c
show	c
,	c
not	c
only	c
can	c
we	c
see	c
latest	i
fashions	c
,	c
leisure	c
and	c
sports	c
wear	c
,	c
make	i
up	i
and	c
hairstyles	c
,	c
but	c
we	c
also	i
can	i
enter	c
for	c
free	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Nowadays	c
,	c
quite	c
a	c
few	c
famous	c
people	c
suffer	c
their	i
private	c
life	c
from	c
disturbers	c
such	c
as	c
journalists	c
or	c
reporters	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
think	i
how	c
media	i
effect	i
to	i
famous	c
people	c
.	c

She	c
was	c
always	c
been	i
aftering	i
by	c
media	i
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
after	c
chasing	i
for	c
long	i
time	c
,	c
she	c
was	c
dead	i
because	i
of	i
car	i
accident	c
.	c

It	c
must	c
be	c
a	c
good	c
example	c
of	c
media	i
disaster	c
.	c

I	c
understand	c
she	c
had	c
a	c
good	c
reason	c
to	c
be	c
chased	c
by	c
it	c
.	c

However	c
she	i
definetely	i
deserve	i
to	c
have	c
a	c
private	c
life	c
as	c
one	i
of	i
citizen	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
few	i
famous	c
people	c
desire	i
to	c
be	c
watched	c
by	c
media	i
.	c

Dear	c
Ms.	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
:	c

Refering	i
about	i
sports	c
I	i
would	c
choose	c
swimming	c
and	c
basketball	c
,	c
because	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
child	c
I	c
used	c
to	c
swim	c
a	c
lot	c
,	c
I	c
won	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
prizes	c
and	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
competitions	c
.	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

I	c
remember	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
younger	c
I	c
used	c
to	c
go	c
with	c
my	c
mom	c
shopping	i
to	i
the	i
stores	i
but	c
I	c
did	c
not	c
like	c
it	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
found	c
boring	i
to	c
buy	c
clothes	c
spending	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
hours	c
in	c
a	c
commercial	i
centre	i
.	c

Another	c
bad	c
thing	c
could	i
be	i
the	c
enormous	c
queues	c
in	c
the	c
supermarkets	c
,	i
it	i
is	c
incredible	c
how	c
many	i
time	c
you	c
can	c
spend	c
in	c
there	c
.	c

The	i
last	i
month	c
was	i
a	c
robbery	c
in	c
a	c
commercial	i
centre	i
next	c
to	c
my	c
house	c
,	i
somebody	i
stole	c
a	c
lady	c
's	c
purse	c
with	c
all	c
her	c
identifications	i
,	c
credit	c
cards	c
and	c
cash	c
,	c
even	c
more	i
her	c
flight	i
ticket	c
.	c

Therefore	c
she	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
tramits	i
to	c
cancell	i
their	i
credit	c
cards	c
and	c
to	c
change	c
her	c
flight	i
ticket	c
.	c

Unlucky	c
lady	c
.	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
I	c
would	c
say	c
that	c
even	c
when	i
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	i
enjoyable	c
we	c
have	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
because	c
we	c
do	c
not	c
have	c
another	c
option	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

While	c
in	c
California	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
sleep	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
can	c
live	i
closer	c
to	c
the	i
nature	c
.	c

Anyway	c
the	c
accommodation	c
is	c
not	c
a	c
big	c
problem	c
for	c
me	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
away	c
most	c
of	c
the	c
time	c
.	c

Before	c
ending	c
my	c
letter	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
and	i
be	i
told	i
specialy	i
in	i
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
should	i
I	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
with	c
me	c
and	c
also	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
change	c
some	c
money	c
of	c
mine	c
in	i
Dollars	i
.	c

As	c
you	c
know	c
last	c
month	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
help	c
at	c
a	c
concert	c
,	c
the	c
one	c
that	c
I	c
told	c
you	c
in	i
my	c
last	c
letter	c
.	c

From	c
the	c
first	c
time	i
that	c
went	i
there	c
I	c
understood	c
that	c
I	c
was	c
going	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
great	c
night	c
.	c

So	c
the	c
party	c
started	c
...	c

Do	c
n't	c
ask	c
the	c
time	c
in	i
which	i
I	c
come	i
home	c
because	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
remember	c
!	c

Some	c
of	c
my	c
friends	c
who	c
were	c
also	c
helping	c
told	c
me	c
that	c
we	c
returned	c
at	c
six	c
o'clock	c
in	c
the	c
morning	c
!	c

YOUR	c
THEATRE	c
RESTAURANT	c
,	c
OF	c
COURSE	c
,	c
I	c
COULD	c
N'T	c
DO	c
IT	c
BECAUSE	c
IT	c
WAS	c
CLOSE	i
.	c

AS	c
YOU	c
CAN	c
SEE	c
,	c
THAT	i
WAS	c
N'T	c
MY	c
PERFECT	c
EVENING	c
OUT	c
(	c
AS	c
YOU	c
PROMISE	i
IN	c
THE	c
ADVERTISEMENT	c
)	c
,	c
SO	c
I	c
WANT	c
YOU	c
TO	c
GIVE	c
ME	c
MY	c
MONEY	c
BACK	c
.	c

SHE	c
TOLD	c
ME	c
THAT	c
I	c
WAS	c
SPENDING	c
TOO	c
MUCH	c
TIME	c
WITH	c
MY	c
FRIENDS	c
,	c
SO	c
MY	c
QUALIFICATIONS	i
WERE	c
GOING	c
TO	c
BE	c
VERY	c
BAD	c
.	c

I	c
REALLY	c
WANTED	c
TO	c
GO	c
,	c
AND	c
I	c
KNEW	c
THAT	c
MY	c
EXAM	c
WAS	i
NO	i
GOOD	i
,	c
SO	c
I	c
TOLD	c
MY	c
MOTHER	c
THAT	c
I	c
WOULD	c
GET	c
MY	c
QUALIFICATIONS	i
THE	c
NEXT	c
MONDAY	c
,	c
SO	c
MY	c
MOTHER	c
ALLOWED	c
ME	c
TO	c
GO	c
.	c

OF	c
COURSE	c
,	c
I	c
DID	c
N'T	c
THINK	c
ABOUT	c
TELLING	c
THAT	c
TO	c
MY	c
MOTHER	c
,	c
BUT	c
PAT	c
CAME	c
TO	c
MY	c
HOUSE	c
AND	c
TOLD	c
IT	i
TO	i
MY	c
MOTHER	c
,	c
WITHOUT	c
ANY	c
INTENTION	c
.	i

AS	c
A	c
RESULT	c
,	c
I	c
WAS	c
N'T	c
ALLOWED	c
TO	c
GO	c
TO	c
THE	c
CONCERT	c
,	c
BUT	c
PAT	c
TOLD	c
ME	c
THAT	c
IT	c
WAS	c
GREAT	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
very	c
disappointed	c
with	c
the	c
hour	i
that	c
the	c
act	i
started	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
my	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
sorry	c
if	c
I	c
make	i
any	i
problem	i
to	i
you	i
,	c
but	c
I	c
'm	c
very	c
angry	c
and	c
it	c
was	c
your	c
fault	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

All	c
our	c
mates	c
wanted	c
to	c
enjoy	c
our	c
fantastic	c
and	i
secret	c
path	c
to	c
look	c
for	c
exams	c
.	c

Then	c
somebody	c
told	c
to	i
a	c
teacher	c
and	c
the	c
teachers	c
went	c
to	c
talk	c
to	c
our	c
parents	c
.	c

They	c
were	c
very	c
angry	c
and	c
disappointed	c
with	c
us	c
.	c

Nowadays	c
,	c
I	c
remember	c
this	c
story	c
like	i
a	c
bad	c
experience	c
.	c

Jaro	c
Santoquez	c

We	c
have	c
hardly	c
assimilated	c
a	i
new	c
technology	c
when	c
it	c
is	c
replaced	c
or	c
modified	c
by	c
another	c
.	c

Electronic	c
devices	c
and	c
'	c
gadgets	c
'	c
make	c
our	c
daily	c
life	i
more	c
comfortable	c
and	c
easier	c
,	c
but	c
does	c
it	i
means	i
that	c
we	c
live	c
better	c
than	c
ever	c
?	c

Of	c
course	c
,	c
they	c
have	c
liberated	c
us	c
from	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
tough	c
routines	c
,	c
giving	c
us	c
the	c
chance	c
to	c
have	c
more	c
free-time	i
.	c

People	c
spend	c
more	c
and	c
more	c
time	c
working	c
,	c
searching	c
for	c
new	c
inventions	c
that	c
will	c
make	c
life	c
easier	c
,	c
but	c
then	c
fail	c
to	c
profit	c
all	i
the	c
obtained	i
benefits	i
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
taking	i
us	c
to	c
London	c
.	c

This	c
is	c
going	c
to	c
take	c
place	c
on	c
tuesday	i
march	i
14	c
at	i
10.00	c
to	c
19.00	c
.	c

Could	c
you	c
,	c
if	c
we	c
may	c
ask	i
so	i
,	c
re-organise	i
our	c
visit	c
to	c
the	c
museum	c
and	c
also	c
to	c
the	c
shopping	c
center	i
.	c

However	c
,	c
none	c
of	c
us	c
wishes	c
to	c
miss	c
all	c
the	c
attractions	c
planned	c
in	c
forecast	i
.	c

Perhaps	c
,	i
we	c
could	c
spend	c
our	c
free	c
time	c
at	c
the	c
museum	c
before	c
going	c
to	c
the	c
shop	i
center	i
.	c

I	c
apologise	c
for	c
any	c
inconvenience	c
it	c
could	i
make	i
.	c

Yours	c
truly	c
.	i

What	c
do	c
famous	c
people	c
wish	i
?	c

Do	c
they	c
want	c
to	c
be	c
famous	c
and	c
ignored	c
?	c

Or	c
do	c
they	c
want	c
to	c
be	c
persecuted	c
buy	i
the	c
media	c
?	c

You	c
do	c
not	c
have	c
a	c
precarious	c
life	c
.	c

You	c
are	c
rich	c
and	c
be-loved	i
.	c

Of	c
course	c
,	c
it	c
does	c
not	c
mean	c
you	c
deserve	c
to	c
be	c
persecuted	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
.	c

It	i
is	i
the	i
way	i
you	i
may	i
consider	i
magnificent	i
wages	i
as	i
it	i
should	i
fit	i
your	i
fame	i
.	c

I	c
might	c
also	c
miss	i
the	c
point	c
.	c

You	c
might	c
be	c
a	c
Princess	i
,	c
a	c
politician	c
or	c
a	c
footballer	c
;	i
but	c
are	c
not	c
doing	c
it	c
for	c
any	c
fame	c
.	c

You	c
never	c
wished	c
to	c
be	c
famous	i
that	i
much	i
.	c

Whateaver	i
you	c
do	c
,	c
the	i
journalist	i
should	c
not	c
follow	c
you	c
every	c
second	c
.	c

Every	i
one	i
deserves	c
to	c
be	c
given	c
the	c
right	c
of	i
a	c
private	c
life	c
.	c

Despite	i
of	i
this	i
fact	c
,	c
that	i
I	c
did	c
not	c
care	c
about	c
it	i
at	c
the	i
beginning	i
,	c
when	c
the	c
play	c
started	c
I	c
did	c
not	c
see	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
who	c
is	c
my	c
favourite	c
actor	c
,	i
I	c
saw	c
another	c
actor	c
who	c
was	c
not	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
.	c

But	c
the	c
main	c
reason	c
of	i
my	c
complaint	c
,	c
is	c
that	c
in	c
the	c
advertistment	i
said	i
it	c
would	c
be	c
my	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
,	c
and	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
.	c

Therefore	c
for	i
all	c
things	i
I	i
would	c
be	c
happy	c
to	c
get	c
some	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

If	c
I	c
had	i
not	i
it	c
,	c
I	c
could	c
not	c
do	c
most	c
part	i
of	c
the	c
things	c
that	c
I	c
do	c
today	c
.	c

But	c
we	c
have	c
it	c
,	c
and	c
the	c
thing	c
that	c
have	i
changed	c
more	i
my	i
life	i
has	i
been	i
the	c
internet	i
.	c

For	c
example	c
if	c
someday	i
I	c
forgot	c
the	i
book	c
,	c
with	i
the	i
internet	i
I	i
can	i
find	i
the	i
book	i
inside	i
it	i
,	c
and	c
more	c
information	c
.	i

Another	c
thing	c
apart	c
from	c
the	c
internet	i
and	c
the	c
car	c
that	c
has	c
changed	c
my	c
life	c
is	c
the	c
TV	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
given	c
a	c
questionnaire	c
to	c
other	c
students	c
of	i
my	c
class	c
to	c
know	c
their	c
preferences	c
about	i
this	c
choise	i
and	c
we	c
all	c
believe	c
that	c
the	c
first	c
lesson	c
that	c
should	c
be	c
filmed	c
is	c
Philosophy	i
.	c

The	c
reason	c
is	c
that	c
all	c
students	c
are	c
interested	c
in	c
it	c
and	c
the	c
teacher	c
is	c
so	c
good	c
in	i
explaing	i
problems	c
that	c

June	c

The	c
manager	c

The	c
reason	c
is	c
that	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
that	c
I	c
had	c
seen	c
with	c
my	c
wife	c
,	c
first	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
started	c
late	c
.	c

We	c
were	c
interested	c
on	i
see	i
the	c
actors	c
that	c
appeard	i
on	c
the	c
tickets	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
disappointed	c
when	c
,	c
in	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
we	c
saw	c
another	i
actors	c
.	c

So	c
it	c
was	c
the	c
most	i
badly	i
evening	c
that	c
I	c
had	c
ever	c
spend	i
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

You	c
have	i
a	c
really	c
great	c
idea	c
to	c
create	c
this	c
sort	c
of	c
Festival	i
.	c

I	c
had	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
fun	c
to	i
go	i
there	c
.	c

I	c
would	i
like	i
to	i
come	i
next	c
year	c
with	c
a	i
great	c
pleasure	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
will	c
not	c
angry	i
if	c
I	c
give	c
you	c
some	c
advice	c
?	i

From	c
my	c
point	c
of	c
view	c
,	c
it	c
will	c
better	c
if	c
you	c
have	c
some	c
"	c
Stars	c
and	c
Artists	c
"	c
from	c
only	c
six	c
countries	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
a	c
good	c
idea	c
to	c
have	c
reasonably-priced	c
for	i
weekends	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
do	i
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
,	i

Yours	c
faithfully	i
,	c

I	c
'm	c
fine	c
but	c
I	c
have	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
work	c
to	c
do	c
for	c
my	c
school	c
.	c

At	i
first	i
;	c
.	c

You	c
must	c
to	i
be	i
outside	c
during	c
the	c
break	c
.	c

You	c
must	c
sign	i
your	c
notebook	c
to	c
your	c
parents	c
every	c
week	c
.	c

You	c
must	c
to	i
be	i
on	c
time	c
at	c
school	c
or	c
you	c
have	i
a	c
punishment	c
.	c

I	c
Hope	i
these	i
information	c
will	c
help	c
you	c
,	c

Love	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
I	i
want	c
you	c
to	c
know	c
I	c
am	c
really	c
happy	c
about	c
the	c
prize	c
.	c

The	c
only	c
problem	c
is	c
that	c
like	i
I	c
am	c
a	c
student	c
I	c
can	c
travel	c
only	c
during	c
holidays	i
,	c
in	c
July	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
not	c
really	c
keen	c
on	c
art	i
that	i
is	c
why	c
I	c
prefer	i
doing	c
some	c
sports	c
like	c
surfing	c
and	c
sailing	c
.	c

If	c
I	c
have	i
to	c
be	c
honest	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
say	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
practised	i
none	i
of	c
them	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
fordward	i
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Please	c
do	c
n't	c
be	c
angry	c
.	c

Not	c
only	c
because	c
I	c
learnt	c
a	c
lot	c
about	c
concerts	c
and	c
music	c
,	c
but	c
also	c
because	c
I	c
practised	c
my	c
English	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
fordward	i
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
could	c
to	i
pass	i
this	i
two	c
weeks	c
during	c
next	c
July	c
only	c
,	c
because	c
,	c
before	c
and	c
after	c
it	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
working	i
as	c
a	c
waiter	c
here	c
in	c
my	c
town	c
.	c

All	c
the	c
activities	c
indicated	c
in	c
your	c
letter	c
are	c
great	c
for	c
me	c
but	c
I	c
prefer	c
tennis	c
and	c
surfing	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
'm	c
used	c
to	c
playing	c
tennis	c
during	i
every	c
weekends	i
and	c
I	c
'm	c
very	c
keen	c
to	i
surfing	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
very	c
happy	c
and	c
lazy	c
at	c
the	c
same	c
time	c
.	c

Last	c
month	c
I	c
visited	c
Tom	c
,	c
another	c
old	c
friend	c
,	c
and	c
he	c
told	c
me	c
if	i
I	i
had	i
worked	i
with	c
him	c
like	i
musician	i
at	c
the	c
XZY	c
pop	c
concert	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
embaracing	i
during	c
the	c
concert	c
,	c
but	c
all	c
the	c
staff	c
were	c
very	c
kindly	i
with	i
me	c
and	c
Tom	c
too	c
.	c

This	c
is	i
the	c
most	c
important	c
experience	c
in	c
my	c
life	c
,	c
I	c
knew	c
all	c
the	c
people	c
,	c
in	c
a	i
particular	c
the	c
famous	c
singer	c
"	c
Kos	c
"	c
.	c

WE	c
ASKED	c
ABOUT	c
"	c
THE	c
DISCOUNTS	c
"	c
THAT	c
WERE	c
OFFERED	c
IN	c
THE	c
ADVERTISEMENT	c
AND	c
THE	c
ONLY	c
THING	c
THAT	c
THE	c
LADY	c
WHO	c
WAS	c
SELLING	c
COULD	i
SAY	c
WAS	c
:	c
WHAT	c
DISCOUNTS	c
?	c

TODAY	c
,	c
I	c
CAN	c
TAKE	i
MOST	c
OF	c
MY	c
SCHOOL	i
'S	i
HOMEWORKS	i
FROM	i
THE	c
COMPUTER	c
ENCYCLOPAEDIA	c
AND	c
IT	c
DOES	c
N'T	c
WEIGHT	i
MORE	c
THAN	c
AN	c
APPLE	c
!	c

I	c
CAN	c
READ	c
ALL	c
THE	c
NEWS	c
AS	c
SOON	c
AS	c
THEY	i
HAPPEN	i
AT	i
THE	c
VIRTUAL	c
NEWSPAPERS	c
AND	c
I	c
CAN	c
TALK	c
WITH	c
MY	c
FOREIGN	c
FRIENDS	c
THANKS	c
TO	c
THE	c
ICQ	c
PROGRAM	c
,	i
I	c
HAD	c
NEVER	c
USED	c
INTERNET	i
BEFORE	c
,	c
BUT	c
IT	c
HAS	c
CHANGED	c
MY	c
ENTIRE	c
LIFE	c
,	c
AND	c
IT	c
IS	c
MUCH	c
BETTER	c
THAN	c
IT	c
USED	c
TO	c
BE	c
.	c

I	c
must	c
tell	c
you	c
that	c
this	c
show	c
was	c
the	c
worst	c
one	c
I	c
had	c
ever	c
been	c
to	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
at	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
this	c
very	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
,	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
-	c
which	c
was	c
also	c
mentioned	c
in	c
your	c
ad	c
-	c
but	c
I	c
was	c
told	c
that	c
this	c
latter	i
was	c
closed	c
because	i
of	i
a	c
private	c
party	c
!	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

When	c
you	c
told	c
her	c
something	c
important	c
,	c
she	c
could	c
not	c
help	c
telling	c
it	c
to	c
someone	c
else	c
so	c
as	c
not	c
to	c
be	c
the	c
only	c
one	c
to	c
know	c
it	c
.	c

In	c
fact	c
,	c
she	c
knew	c
that	c
even	c
if	c
Sally	c
was	c
her	c
best	c
friend	c
,	c
she	c
would	c
not	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
keep	c
such	c
a	c
secret	c
.	c

It	c
might	c
seem	c
a	c
bit	c
strange	c
but	c
if	c
Pat	c
had	c
been	c
able	c
to	c
choose	c
whether	c
she	c
wanted	c
to	c
know	c
a	c
secret	c
or	c
not	c
,	c
she	c
would	c
have	c
prefered	i
not	c
to	c
know	c
it	c
.	c

But	c
when	c
she	c
saw	c
the	c
phone	c
that	c
she	c
used	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
call	c
her	c
friends	c
,	c
she	c
started	c
to	c
cry	c
since	c
she	c
knew	c
that	c
she	c
would	c
use	c
it	c
.	c

Mr	c
John	c
Smythe	c
,	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
excited	c
with	i
the	c
idea	c
of	c
going	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
did	c
n't	c
work	c
out	c
as	c
I	c
thought	c
it	c
will	i
.	c

Second	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
the	c
play	c
was	c
suposed	i
to	c
start	c
at	c
19:30	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
.	c

As	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
have	c
a	c
"	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
"	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
I	c
have	c
the	c
right	c
to	c
ask	c
for	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
understand	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

Two	c
years	c
ago	c
in	c
this	c
school	c
,	c
Pat	c
and	c
I	c
used	c
to	c
be	c
best	c
friends	c
.	c

Pat	c
could	c
n't	c
stand	c
the	c
pressure	c
of	c
the	c
"	c
crime	c
"	c
so	c
she	c
told	c
the	c
school	c
directors	c
that	c
I	c
stole	c
the	c
tests	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
punished	c
,	c
nearly	c
expelt	i
,	c
but	c
Pat	c
did	c
n't	c
receive	c
any	c
punishment	c
.	c

I	c
never	c
accused	c
her	c
of	c
lying	c
,	c
and	c
I	i
you	c
ask	c
me	c
why	c
,	c
I	c
really	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
.	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
have	c
just	c
received	c
your	c
letter	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
so	c
pleased	c
with	c
the	c
news	c
.	c

I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
that	c
the	c
best	c
month	c
to	i
travel	c
to	c
the	c
U.S.A	c
is	i
on	i
july	i
because	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
on	c
hollidays	i
in	c
this	i
month	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
really	c
worry	c
about	c
the	c
accommodation	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
,	c
but	c
if	c
I	c
can	c
tell	i
you	i
wich	i
one	i
I	i
prefer	i
I	c
'll	c
choose	c
in	i
tent	i
.	c

This	c
is	c
because	c
is	i
more	c
exciting	c
and	c
fun	c
than	c
not	i
in	c
log	c
cabins	c
.	c

From	c
the	c
list	c
of	c
activities	c
to	i
do	i
at	c
the	c
Camp	c
I	c
will	c
enjoy	c
singing	c
and	c
swimming	c
.	c

I	c
used	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
a	c
swimming	c
pool	c
twice	c
every	c
week	c
and	c
also	c
I	c
love	c
music	c
and	c
sing	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
.	c

Sincerely	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
so	c
glad	c
to	c
know	c
that	c
you	c
and	c
your	c
family	c
still	i
well	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
to	c
explain	c
what	c
I	c
did	c
last	c
month	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
so	c
easy	c
,	i
a	i
mean	c
we	c
just	c
carried	c
all	c
the	c
instruments	c
from	i
the	c
musicians	c
to	c
the	c
Club	c
and	c
we	c
put	c
it	i
on	c
the	c
stage	c

Love	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
,	c

Unfortunately	c
last	i
evening	c
there	c
was	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
and	c
that	c
was	c
very	c
disappointing	c
.	c

Apart	c
from	c
that	c
the	i
show	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
not	i
at	c
19:30	c
,	c
as	c
it	c
is	i
written	i
in	c
the	c
advertisment	i
and	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
when	c
the	c
show	c
finished	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
receive	i
your	c
reply	c
with	c
my	c
money	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

Pat	c
and	c
I	c
had	c
been	c
friends	c
for	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
and	c
as	c
my	c
best	c
friend	c
he	c
knew	c
all	c
my	c
secrets	c
.	c

Yesterday	c
afternoon	c
,	c
when	c
I	c
went	c
home	c
,	c
my	c
mother	c
want	i
to	c
talk	c
me	i
for	i
something	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
went	c
in	i
her	c
bedroom	c
to	c
speak	c
with	i
her	c
.	c

She	c
told	c
me	c
that	c
she	c
knew	c
that	c
last	c
Saturday	c
I	c
went	c
in	i
a	c
party	c
without	c
asked	i
her	c
and	c
that	c
she	c
had	c
to	c
punish	c
me	c
for	c
that	c
.	c

She	c
told	c
me	c
that	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
stay	c
at	c
home	c
for	i
that	i
weekend	c
and	c
not	c
to	i
go	i
out	i
with	c
my	c
friends	c
.	c

I	c
called	c
him	c
and	c
we	c
had	c
a	c
big	c
argument	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

I	c
like	c
very	i
much	i
this	i
musical	i
and	c
while	c
I	c
was	c
spending	c
some	c
days	c
in	c
London	c
I	c
could	i
see	i
you	i
advertisement	c
so	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
see	c
it	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
entered	c
to	i
the	c
theatre	c
to	c
enjoy	c
the	c
musical	c
but	c
I	c
do	c
not	c
know	c
the	c
reason	c
why	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
a	c
quarter	c
past	c
eight	c
(	c
three	c
quarters	c
delayed	i
)	c
.	c

In	c
your	c
advertisement	c
his	c
name	c
was	c
in	c
main	i
letters	c
and	c
in	c
the	c
musical	c
the	i
actor	i
was	i
different	i
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

My	c
computer	c
is	c
faster	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
able	c
to	c
do	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
things	c
on	i
that	i
I	i
wasted	i
a	i
lot	i
of	i
time	i
before	c
.	c

Not	c
only	c
are	c
the	i
computers	c
useful	c
for	c
keep	i
information	c
but	c
also	c
computers	c
can	c
give	c
you	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
information	c
due	i
to	c
Internet	i
.	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
modern	c
technology	c
is	c
changing	c
my	c
work	c
,	c
my	c
life	c
,	c
and	c
my	c
friends	c
.	c

Maybe	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
nice	c
idea	c
to	c
analize	i
these	c
changes	c
and	c
to	c
put	c
limits	c
to	i
technology	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
is	i
our	i
life	c
and	c
no	i
the	c
ways	c
we	c
improve	i
it	c
.	c

That	c
was	c
why	c
I	c
was	c
really	c
shocked	c
recognizing	i
that	c
there	c
was	c
another	c
actor	c
playing	c
.	i

This	c
actor	c
was	c
not	c
almost	i
as	c
brilliant	c
as	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
not	c
have	c
paied	i
so	c
many	i
money	c
if	c
I	c
had	c
known	c
this	c
before	c
.	c

Like	c
everything	c
had	i
gone	c
wrong	c
that	c
evening	c
,	c
the	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
the	c
cook	c
had	c
fallen	c
ill	c
!	c

I	c
am	c
convinced	c
to	i
have	i
the	c
right	c
to	i
get	i
some	c
money	c
back	c
from	c
you	c
because	c
none	c
of	c
your	c
promises	c
was	c
a	i
carried	c
out	c
.	c

"	c
The	c
Old	c
Man	c
and	c
the	c
Sea	c
"	c

I	c
heard	c
somebody	c
say	c
"	i
Exciting	c
books	c
always	c
describe	c
people	c
in	c
difficult	c
situations	c
"	c
.	c

Well	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
not	c
agree	c
that	c
this	c
statement	c
is	c
always	c
true	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
is	c
true	c
in	c
the	c
case	c
of	c
the	c
book	c
"	c
The	c
Old	c
Man	c
and	c
the	c
Sea	c
"	c
by	c
Ernest	c
Hemingway	c
.	c

What	c
makes	c
the	c
situation	c
difficult	c
is	c
that	c
none	i
of	c
the	c
two	c
characters	c
wants	c
to	c
give	c
up	c
.	c

The	c
excitement	c
is	c
not	c
created	c
by	c
bloody	c
fights	c
but	c
by	c
the	c
strength	c
of	c
the	c
protagonist	c
.	c

He	c
is	c
old	c
and	c
he	c
wants	c
to	c
win	c
this	c
last	c
competition	c
between	c
him	c
and	c
the	i
nature	c
.	c

The	c
reader	c
feels	c
with	i
him	c
,	c
wants	c
to	c
know	c
if	c
he	c
will	c
win	c
or	c
wonders	c
why	c
he	c
will	c
not	c
give	c
up	c
.	c

I	c
was	i
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
called	c
'	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
'	c
.	c

There	c
I	c
was	i
many	i
problems	c
.	c

first	i
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
bought	c
four	c
tickets	c
for	c
£	c
20	c
each	c
and	c
discounts	c
were	c
not	c
available	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
arrived	c
at	c
the	c
theatre	c
at	c
9:15	c
because	c
the	c
start	i
time	i
was	c
at	i
9:30	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
fed	c
up	c
to	i
wait	i
.	c

The	c
worst	c
thing	c
of	c
all	c
was	c
that	c
at	c
the	c
beggining	i
of	c
the	c
show	c
I	c
realized	c
that	c
the	c
actors	c
were	c
totally	c
different	c
.	i

We	c
decided	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
to	c
eat	c
something	c
and	c
to	c
relax	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
absolutely	i
annoyed	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
going	c
to	c
write	c
about	c
what	c
clothes	c
will	c
be	c
worn	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
gone	c
out	c
to	i
the	c
street	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
asked	c
to	i
people	c
for	i
this	c
question	c
.	c

Most	c
of	i
people	c
think	c
that	c
character	c
people	i
and	c
clothes	c
are	c
together	i
.	c

And	c
people	c
will	c
wear	c
cibernetic	i
clothes	c
but	c
in	i
the	c
same	c
time	c
comfortable	c
clothes	c
.	c

I	c
believe	c
that	c
they	c
will	c
wear	c
colourful	c
jeans	c
,	c
T-shirts	c
,	c
mountain	c
boots	c
,	c
etc.	c
And	c
all	c
of	c
this	c
with	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
colour	c
.	c

From	c
my	c
point	c
of	c
view	c
,	c
they	c
will	c
be	i
more	i
enjoyable	i
than	c
people	c
now	i
because	c
they	c
will	c
have	c
many	c
things	c
to	c
do	c
.	c

At	i
the	c
end	c
all	i
people	i
will	c
be	c
short-sight	i
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
living	i
in	c
the	c
future	c
to	c
check	i
which	i
clothes	i
exactly	i
they	c
will	c
wear	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
a	c
point	i
very	i
interesting	i
.	c

I	c
received	c
your	c
letter	c
the	c
other	c
day	c
,	c
I	i
was	c
very	c
happy	c
to	c
find	c
out	c
that	c
I	c
won	i
two	c
weeks	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
.	c

Well	c
,	c
to	c
answer	c
to	i
your	c
questions	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
attend	c
at	i
this	c
camp	c
during	c
the	c
month	c
of	c
July	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
the	c
only	c
time	c
when	c
I	c
can	c
get	i
vacations	i
.	c

It	i
is	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
an	c
apprentice	c
,	c
so	c
they	c
let	i
me	i
have	i
my	i
vacations	i
only	i
in	i
July	i
!	c
!	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
more	c
fun	c
sleeping	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
than	c
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
more	c
like	c
adventure	i
being	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
,	c
and	c
you	c
are	c
closer	c
to	c
the	i
nature	c
,	c
and	c
the	c
animals	c
!	c

For	c
the	i
activities	c
I	c
think	c
I	c
will	c
choose	c
swimming	c
because	c
I	c
love	c
swimming	c
and	c
being	c
in	c
the	c
water	c
.	c

Since	c
I	c
'm	c
coming	c
during	i
the	c
month	c
of	c
July	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
should	c
I	c
take	c
with	c
me	c
,	i
and	i
I	c
have	c
another	c
question	c
,	i
it	i
's	i
about	c
money	c
.	c

Best	c
Regards	i

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c

Well	c
this	c
is	c
abosolutly	i
true	c
,	c
espacially	i
when	c
you	c
go	c
shopping	c
on	c
Saturday	c
.	c

And	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
wait	c
after	c
to	i
buy	c
it	c
,	c
so	c
finally	c
you	c
waited	i
so	c
long	c
that	c
you	c
are	i
getting	i
late	c
,	c
so	c
you	c
get	c
stressed	c
to	i
.	c

You	c
get	c
headaches	c
,	c
you	c
get	c
stressed	c
,	c
and	c
finally	c
you	c
get	c
bruses	i
because	c
of	c
the	c
woman	c
that	i
pushed	c
you	c
to	c
get	c
the	c
pretty	c
skirt	c
before	c
you	c
!	c
!	c
!	c

I	c
recived	i
your	c
letter	c
recently	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
really	c
happy	c
learning	i
that	c
I	c
won	i
the	c
first	c
prize	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
to	c
answer	c
your	c
questions	c
.	c

Your	c
next	c
question	c
is	c
about	c
the	c
activities	c
that	c
I	c
could	c
do	c
at	c
the	c
camp	c
,	i
after	i
browse	i
through	c
the	c
list	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
take	c
part	c
in	c
climbing	c
and	c
photography	i
activities	c
,	c
as	c
these	c
are	c
my	c
favourite	c
hobbies	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
could	c
you	c
tell	c
me	c
how	c
far	c
is	c
the	c
nearest	c
town	c
or	c
village	c
?	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
,	c
but	c
do	c
n't	c
worry	c
,	c
the	c
shooping	i
center	i
still	i
there	c
waiting	c
for	c
you	c
!	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
log	i
cabin	c
because	c
it	c
must	c
be	c
cold	c
to	i
stay	i
in	c
a	c
tent	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
some	c
problems	c
with	c
my	c

so	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
stay	c
in	c
on	i
of	c
the	c
tents	c
,	c
and	c
it	i
also	i
must	c
be	c
very	c
comfortable	c
to	i
stay	i
a	i
log	c
cabin	c

The	c
particularly	i

What	c
I	c
realised	c
was	c
they	c
were	c
not	c
different	c
from	c
any	c
of	c
us	c
but	c
they	c
were	c
called	c
celebreties	i

To	c
the	c

Dear	c

I	c
write	c

but	c
it	c
started	i
also	i
45	c
late	i
-	c
This	i
should	c
n't	c
happen	c
!	c

This	c
show	c
might	c
be	c
the	c
newest	c
in	c
London	c
,	c
but	c
not	i
the	i
best	i
at	i
all	i

He	c

Everyone	c

I	c

I	c

Firstly	c

I	c

July	c
as	c
I	c

plans	c
for	c
June	c
which	i
is	i
to	c
visit	c
France	c
for	c
3	c

Thank	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

Hi	c
Kim	c
.	c

How	c
are	c
you	c
?	c

I	c
am	c
fine	c
and	c
so	c
is	c
my	c
family	c
.	c

At	c
first	c
,	c
they	c
asked	c
me	c
to	c
decorate	c
the	c
stage	c
since	c
I	c
like	c
drawing	c
,	c
but	c
as	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
get	c
more	c
involved	c
,	c
they	c
said	c
that	c
I	c
could	c
also	c
help	c
them	c
set	c
up	c
the	c
lights	c
,	c
the	c
microphones	c
and	c
the	c
instruments	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
to	c
admit	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
always	c
easy	c
,	c
but	c
my	c
effort	c
was	c
worth	c
every	c
penny	c
.	c

I	c
thought	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
to	c
see	c
how	c
things	c
turn	c
out	c
so	c
well	c
when	c
you	c
put	c
everybody	c
's	c
different	c
talents	c
together	c
.	c

Dear	c
sir	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
draw	c
your	c
attention	c
to	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
that	c
was	i
place	c
last	i
evening	c
.	c

None	c
of	c
conditions	i
was	i
fulfilled	c
:	c
firstly	c
,	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
who	c
was	c
going	c
to	c
perform	c
in	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
was	c
changed	c
by	i
another	c
actor	c

On	i
the	i
other	i
hand	i
,	c
it	i
there	c
was	i
n't	i
any	c
discounts	c
in	i
the	c

I	c
imagine	c
it	i
will	c
be	c
very	c
different	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
these	c
new	c
material	i
wo	i
n't	i
weight	i
hardly	c
anything	c
.	c

As	i
well	i
,	c
people	c
wo	c
n't	c
be	c
as	c
worried	c
about	c
fashion	c
as	c
nowaday	i
,	c
however	c
it	i
will	c
be	c
very	c
important	c
that	c
clothes	c
are	c
comfortable	c
and	c
suitable	c
for	c
your	c
work	c
and	c
daily	c
duties	c
as	c
well	c
as	c
sport	c
or	i
everything	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
do	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
so	c
disappointed	c
that	c
I	c
was	c
thinking	c
of	c
leaving	c
your	c
theatre	c
.	c

Nevertheless	c
,	c
I	c
stayed	c
since	c
I	c
had	c
paid	c
.	c

In	c
fact	c
,	c
if	c
I	c
had	c
knowned	i
,	c
I	c
would	c
have	c
probably	c
stayed	c
at	c
home	c
.	c

And	c
,	c
we	c
were	c
not	c
allowed	c
to	c
visit	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
in	i
so	i
far	i
as	i
it	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

Indeed	c
,	c
there	c
was	c
a	c
little	c
paper	i
on	c
the	c
door	c
which	c
informed	c
us	c
that	c
the	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
due	c
to	c
illness	c
.	c

Consequently	c
I	c
ask	c
you	c
for	c
some	c
money	c
back	c
seeing	i
that	c
I	c
think	c
:	c
it	i
's	i
not	i
worth	i
the	i
bother	i
to	c
loose	i
money	c
for	c
such	c
a	c
show.	c
,	c

Thank	c
you	c
.	c

Indeed	c
,	c
daily	c
life	c
is	c
easier	c
thanks	c
to	c
technology	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
if	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
buy	c
something	c
,	c
I	c
have	i
to	i
go	i
on	c
my	c
computer	c
and	c
buy	c
it	c
.	c

But	c
it	c
will	c
make	c
me	c
lazy	c
.	c

In	c
fact	c
,	c
I	c
like	c
technology	c
but	c
sometimes	c
I	c
wish	c
it	c
had	i
n't	i
existed	c
since	c
there	c
are	c
too	c
many	c
things	c
on	c
market	i
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
:	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
this	c
letter	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
some	c
aspects	c
of	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
"	c
that	i
was	c
held	i
in	c
your	c
theatre	c
.	c

The	c
first	c
problem	c
we	c
had	c
was	c
that	c
the	c
discounts	c
announced	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
were	c
not	c
available	c
and	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
pay	c
the	c
full	c
ticket	i
.	c

We	c
read	c
that	c
we	c
could	c
visit	c
it	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
the	c
waiters	c
were	c
on	c
strike	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
all	c
these	c
problems	c
could	c
have	c
been	c
avoided	c
and	c
that	c
asking	c
my	i
money	c
back	c
is	c
the	c
best	c
way	c
of	c
forgetting	c
that	c
evening	c
.	c

We	c
want	c
to	c
know	c
what	c
we	c
will	c
have	c
to	c
wear	c
next	c
year	c
but	c
we	c
want	c
to	c
know	c
it	c
now	c
.	c

People	c
have	c
always	c
looked	c
for	c
the	c
most	c
comfortable	c
clothes	c
for	c
they	i
daily	c
life	i
.	c

We	c
tend	c
to	c
a	i
society	c
that	c
wants	c
more	c
free	c
time	c
so	c
people	c
will	c
need	c
more	c
comfortable	c
clothes	c
to	c
enjoy	c
it	c
.	c

Another	c
important	c
thing	c
will	c
be	c
the	c
use	c
of	c
technology	c
.	c

Scientists	c
are	c
looking	c
for	c
new	c
materials	c
that	c
will	c
made	i
our	c
clothes	c
more	c
comfortable	c
stronger	i
.	c

The	c
International	c
Arts	c
Festival	c
is	c
a	c
beautiful	i
idea	c
.	c

I	c
enjoyed	c
most	c
of	c
the	c
events	c
and	c
I	c
found	c
your	c
prices	c
excellent	c
considering	i
that	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
student	c
and	c
that	c
I	c
do	c
not	c
have	c
much	c
money	c
.	c

In	c
your	c
advertisment	i
you	c
mentionned	i
that	c
there	c
is	i
artists	c
and	c
stars	c
from	i
all	i
around	i
the	i
world	i
coming	i
,	c
unfortunately	c
I	c
found	c
out	c
only	c
six	c
countries	c
were	c
represented	c
.	c

The	c
night	c
he	c
came	c
into	c
this	c
world	c
,	i
was	c
one	c
of	c
grater	i
even	i
if	i
for	c
the	c
habitants	i
of	c
the	c
country	c
or	i
even	i
of	c
the	c
town	c
where	c
he	c
was	c
born	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
a	i
casual	i
night	c
.	c

The	c
mother	c
was	c
pride	i
because	c
she	c
knew	c
he	c
was	c
sent	c
from	c
above	c
and	c
he	c
was	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
the	c
one	c
to	c
set	c
people	c
free	c
from	c
their	c
sins	c
.	c

His	c
message	c
is	c
still	c
as	c
impacting	i
today	c
and	c
will	c
always	c
be	c
even	i
if	c
this	c
story	c
happened	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
ago	c
.	c

There	c
were	c
some	c
unfortunate	c
incidents	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
could	c
not	c
get	c
them	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
to	c
this	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
start	c
at	c
19.30	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
20.15	c
.	c

As	c
a	c
result	c
,	c
I	c
could	c
not	c
visit	c
the	c
restaurant	c
since	c
it	c
had	c
already	c
closed	c
when	c
the	c
show	c
finished	c
.	c

Can	c
you	c
imagine	c
how	c
upset	c
I	c
was	c
?	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
to	c
give	i
some	i
money	i
back	i
to	i
me	i
.	c

To	c
begin	c
with	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
the	c
mobile	c
phone	c
is	c
very	c
useful	c
because	c
I	c
can	c
make	c
a	c
phone	c
call	c
wherever	c
I	c
am	c
,	c
without	c
looking	c
for	c
a	c
telephone	c
box	c
.	c

With	c
internet	i
and	c
E-mail	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
get	c
lots	c
of	c
information	c
from	c
everywhere	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
can	c
get	c
in	c
touch	c
with	c
my	c
friends	c
who	c
live	c
in	i
abroad	c
.	c

Since	c
I	c
bought	c
a	c
computer	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
checking	c
E-mails	i
from	c
my	c
friend	c
almost	c
every	c
day	c
.	c

Last	c
week	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
on	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
,	c
and	c
reading	i
the	c
advertisement	c
for	c
your	c
musical	c
show	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
planned	c
(	c
like	i
it	c
is	i
said	c
)	c
"	c
a	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
"	c
.	c

But	c
it	i
turned	c
out	c
,	c
it	c
really	c
was	c
n't	c
a	c
pleasant	c
evening	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
enjoy	c
myself	c
.	c

According	c
to	c
the	c
advertisement	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
should	c
have	c
started	c
at	c
19.30	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
did	c
n't	c
begin	c
before	c
20.15	c
.	c

They	c
had	c
never	c
heard	c
of	c
such	c
a	c
thing	c
!	c

I	c
was	c
a	c
little	c
hungry	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
but	i
then	i
again	i
,	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
find	c
another	c
restaurant	c
since	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
with	c
no	c
further	c
information	c
.	i

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
n't	c
at	c
all	c
satisfied	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
since	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
n't	c
worth	c
it	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets.	c
.	c

There	c
was	c
only	c
one	c
thing	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
like	c
with	i
her	c
:	c
she	c
could	i
do	c
anything	c
to	c
have	c
friends	c
,	c
even	c
betray	c
me	c
.	c

Since	c
everyone	c
knew	c
the	c
truth	c
,	c
things	c
were	c
n't	c
the	c
same	c
.	c

Everyone	c
,	c
even	c
my	c
friends	c
,	c
looked	c
at	c
me	c
in	c
a	c
strange	c
kind	c
of	c
way	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
n't	c
the	c
one	c
who	c
had	c
killed	c
the	c
man	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
seemed	c
people	c
did	c
n't	c
want	c
to	c
talk	c
to	c
me	c
anymore	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
very	c
happy	c
to	c
have	c
won	c
in	i
your	c
competition	c
.	c

I	i
'm	i
never	i
going	i
in	i
the	c
U.S.A	c
than	i
I	c
'm	c
very	c
exciting	i
to	c
travel	i
at	i
Camp	c
California	c
.	c

I	c
can	c
to	i
come	i
only	c
July	i
because	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
work	c
the	c
other	c
months	c
of	c
Summer	i
.	c

I	c
used	c
to	c
climb	c
and	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
try	c
still	i
because	c
climbing	c
is	c
good	i
for	i
the	i
fit	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
one	c
question	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

Anton	c
Chevalier	c

I	c
purpose	i
that	c
we	c
should	c
be	i
filmed	i
five	c
topics	i
:	c

A	i
math	i
lesson	c
,	c
an	c
english	i
lesson	c
,	c
a	c
swimingpool	i
lesson	c
,	c
the	c
break	c
and	c
the	c
staff	c
room	c
.	c

-	c
At	i
the	c
math	i
lesson	c
and	c
the	c
English	c
lesson	c
we	c
could	c
show	c
how	c
the	c
teacher	c
learn	i
at	i
his	c
students	c
.	c

for	i
exemple	i
students	i
who	c
play	c
football	c
or	c
volleyball	c
.	c

In	i
the	c
end	c
we	c
could	c
show	i
a	c
comment	c
of	i
each	c
student	c
of	i
our	c
class	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
really	c
pleased	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
at	i
Camp	c
California	c
in	c
U.S.A	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
this	c
year	c
because	c
I	c
think	c
the	c
weather	c
will	c
be	c
nice	c
and	c
I	c
can	c
take	c
a	c
holiday	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
more	c
interesting	c
than	c
log	i
cabins	i
.	c

I	c
really	c
like	c
swimming	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
child	c
,	c
I	c
used	c
to	c
go	c
swimming	c
with	c
my	c
family	c
at	c
the	c
weekend	c
having	i
a	c
chat	c
,	c
making	c
a	c
barbecue	c
,	c
playing	c
games	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
such	c
a	c
good	c
time	c
.	c

I	c
enjoy	c
painting	c
as	c
well	c
.	c

My	c
parents	c
were	c
very	c
pround	i
of	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
which	i
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
should	c
bring	c
to	c
the	c
camp	c
.	c

How	c
much	c
money	c
should	c
I	c
bring	c
there	i
and	c
can	c
I	c
use	c
my	c
credit	c
card	c
at	c
the	c
camp	c
?	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

I	c
'm	c
taking	c
the	c
final	c
exam	c
next	c
month	c
.	c

I	c
've	c
got	c
some	c
great	c
news	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
.	c

Last	c
month	c
,	c
I	c
worked	i
as	i
a	c
part-time	c
job	c
.	c

Before	c
the	c
concert	c
I	c
was	c
really	c
exciting	i
.	c

I	c
could	c
n't	c
sleep	c
well	c
and	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
know	c
what	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
in	i
the	c
concert	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
such	c
a	c
big	c
concert	c
.	c

There	c
were	c
lots	c
of	c
singers	c
and	c
band	i
.	c

First	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
in	c
front	c
of	c
the	c
entrance	c
door	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
really	c
exciting	i
.	c

After	c
that	c
,	c
I	c
went	c
to	i
the	i
back	c
stage	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
see	c
lots	c
of	c
pop	c
stars	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
really	c
busy	c
but	c
I	c
really	c
enjoyed	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
learnt	c
lots	c
of	c
thing	c
from	i
here	i
that	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
learn	c
from	c
school	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
to	c
be	c
more	c
patient	c
.	c

I	c
knew	i
lots	c
of	c
people	c
from	i
different	c
job	i
.	c

I	c
've	c
got	c
lots	c
of	c
homework	c
to	c
do	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
after	c
visiting	c
your	c
theatre	c
.	c

Frankly	c
speaking	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
disappointed	c
after	c
my	c
visit	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
displeased	c
from	c
the	c
very	c
beginning	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
expected	c
to	c
get	c
a	c
discount	c
as	c
I	c
'm	c
a	c
student	c
.	c

But	c
nevertheless	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
your	c
show	c
.	c

The	c
show	c
started	c
t	i
20.15	c
instead	c
of	c
19.30	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
to	c
wait	c
in	c
overcrowded	i
hall	c
.	c

When	c
finally	i
the	i
show	i
had	i
started	i
I	c
found	c
out	c
that	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
was	i
replaced	i
by	c
another	c
actor	c
.	c

To	c
make	c
matters	c
worse	c
the	i
restaurant	c
which	c
was	c
mentioned	c
in	c
your	c
advertisment	i
was	c
closed	c
.	c

In	c
fact	c
there	c
were	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
mistakes	c
in	c
your	c
advertisment	i
and	c
I	c
would	c
be	c
gratefull	i
if	c
you	c
could	c
give	c
me	c
back	c
a	c
part	c
of	c
my	c
money	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

How	c
has	c
modern	c
technology	c
changed	c
your	c
daily	c
life	c
?	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
modern	c
technologies	c
play	c
the	i
important	c
role	c
in	c
people	c
's	c
life	i
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
at	c
present	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
technologies	c
are	c
computer	c
and	c
Internet	i
technologies	c
.	c

Firs	i
of	c
all	c
Internet	i
gives	c
you	c
an	i
access	c
to	c
a	c
great	c
number	c
of	c
different	c
information	i
.	c

On	c
the	c
one	c
hand	c
Internet	i
is	c
often	c
used	c
for	c
entertaiment	i
,	c
but	c
on	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
it	c
's	c
also	c
used	c
in	c
different	c
business	c
and	c
education	c
process	i
!	i

From	i
my	i
point	i
of	i
view	i
,	c
Internet	i
can	c
be	c
used	c
in	c
education	c
,	c
because	c
it	c
gives	c
an	c
opportunity	c
to	c
have	c
distant	i
relations	i
between	c
pupils	c
and	c
teachers	c
.	c

Though	c
Internet	i
has	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
positive	c
aspects	c
I	i
think	c
you	c
should	c
be	c
careful	c
with	c
it	c
and	c
not	c
to	i
be	i
depended	i
on	c
it	c
.	c

Dear	c
Jane	c
Clark	c

My	c
name	c
is	c
Yuna	c
Kimber	c
who	c
attended	c
this	c
annual	c
International	c
Arts	c
Festival	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
appreicate	i
you	c
for	c
organizing	c
such	c
an	c
exciting	c
festival	c
.	c

By	c
the	c
way	c
,	c
according	c
to	c
the	c
advertisement	c
,	c
lots	c
of	c
stars	c
and	c
artists	c
from	c
around	c
the	c
world	c
were	c
supposed	c
to	c
be	c
invited	c
for	c
the	c
festival	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
was	c
able	c
to	c
meet	c
them	c
just	i
from	c
only	c
six	c
countries	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
mention	c
reasonably-priced	i
weekend	c
ticket	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
brillient	c
,	c
because	c
if	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
pay	c
all	i
things	c
each	i
I	c
would	c
n't	c
have	c
attended	c
it	c
,	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
very	c
expensive	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

Bye	c
for	c
now	c

Long	i
time	c
ago	c
,	c
there	c
were	c
two	c
brothers	c
,	c
whose	c
parents	c
were	c
dead	c
.	c

By	c
the	c
way	c
,	c
the	c
elder	c
brother	c
,	c
Nolbu	c
was	c
a	c
so	i
greedy	c
man	c
.	c

But	c
,	c
even	c
if	c
he	c
was	c
so	i
poor	c
,	c
he	c
was	c
so	i
good	c
and	c
had	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
affection	c
about	i
the	c
people	c
who	c
were	c
much	c
poorer	c
than	c
his	c
family	c
,	c
so	c
he	c
looked	c
after	c
them	c
.	c

He	c
cured	c
the	c
bird	c
to	i
fly	i
with	c
love	c
,	c
and	c
the	c
bird	c
was	c
able	c
to	c
fly	c
.	c

The	c
following	c
year	c
,	c
when	c
the	c
bird	c
returned	c
his	i
house	c
,	c
he	c
gave	c
him	c
a	c
message	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
kind	c
of	c
map	c
that	c
showed	c
the	c
place	i
for	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
money	c
which	c
robbers	c
hid	c
.	c

Therefore	c
,	c
Hungbu	c
became	c
much	c
richer	c
than	c
Nolbu	c
,	c
and	c
he	c
lived	c
happily	c
with	c
the	c
money	c
helping	c
the	c
poor	c
.	c

People	c
belive	i
that	c
the	c
bird	c
was	c
sent	c
by	i
heaven	c
.	c

This	c
story	c
happened	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
ago	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
seen	c
your	c
new	c
musical	c
,	c
'	c
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
'	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
sorry	c
but	c
I	c
must	c
admit	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
bit	c
disappointing	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
n't	c
see	c
anyone	c
inside	c
either	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
pleasant	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
am	c
going	c
to	c
ask	c
for	c
a	c
refund	c
...	c

I	c
hope	c
this	c
is	c
n't	c
affending	i
you	c
too	c
much	c
...	c

When	c
it	c
comes	c
down	c
to	c
color	i
,	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
'll	c
be	c
much	c
brighter	c
and	c
maybe	c
glittery	c
.	c

Maybe	c
silver	c
and	c
gold	c
,	c
glittery	c
red	c
,	c
purple	c
and	c
blue	c
.	c

Still	c
,	c
comfortable	c
.	c

Al	c
the	c
spacy	c
theme	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
I	c
'll	c
be	c
fine	c
in	c
the	c
clothes	c
we	c
have	c
now	c
...	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Ryan	c
,	c

In	c
fact	c
I	c
will	c
finish	c
my	c
university	i
's	i
exams	c
only	c
on	c
the	c
first	c
July	i
and	c
after	c
the	c
20th	c
is	i
impossible	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
going	c
to	c
do	c
four	c
weeks	i
volontary	i
in	i
India	c
for	c
UNICEF	c
.	c

So	c
stay	i
in	c
a	c
log	i
cabins	i
will	c
probably	c
evite	i
me	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
problems	c
.	c

Choose	i
two	c
activities	c
from	c
the	c
list	c
has	c
been	c
very	c
difficult	c
but	c
I	c
think	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
do	c
climbing	c
,	c
sport	i
in	c
which	c
I	c
have	c
many	c
years	c
of	c
experience	c
,	c
and	c
surfing	c
despite	i
I	i
really	i
have	i
any	i
experience	i
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
your	c
attencion	i
on	i
my	i
regard	i

The	c
verb	c
"	c
have	c
"	c
is	c
probably	c
the	c
most	c
used	c
and	c
loved	c
by	c
the	c
human	c
species	c
.	c

If	c
there	c
had	c
been	c
a	c
problem	c
,	c
it	i
would	i
have	i
been	i
told	i
us	i
.	c

I	c
wanted	c
to	c
see	c
him	c
but	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
see	c
.	i

But	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
without	c
any	c
reason	c
.	c

TECHNOLOGICAL	c
ADVANTAGES	c

Technology	c
is	c
the	c
thing	c
that	c
makes	c
our	c
life	c
easy	c
.	c

But	c
if	c
they	c
were	c
n't	c
made	c
,	c
we	c
would	c
have	c
to	c
walk	c
or	c
go	c
by	c
a	i
horse	c
or	c
donkey	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
;	i
in	c
the	c
past	c
people	i
used	c
horses	c
to	c
go	c
another	i
place	c
.	c

And	c
their	c
life	c
passed	c
in	i
the	i
ways	i
.	c

It	c
takes	c
less	c
time	c
than	c
going	c
by	c
horse	c
.	c

And	c
computers	c
,	i
the	i
most	c
important	c
product	c
of	c
technology	c
.	c

Not	c
only	c
as	c
a	c
hobby	c
.	c

They	c
use	c
computers	c
for	c
their	c
works	i
.	c

Sometimes	c
they	c
do	c
n't	c
go	c
to	c
their	c
offices	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
;	i
wars	c
.	c

As	c
I	c
was	c
spending	c
a	c
week-end	i
in	c
London	c
I	i
took	c
a	i
chance	i
too	i
see	c
the	c
performance	c
of	c
one	c
of	c
my	c
favourite	c
actors	c
,	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
have	c
the	c
two	c
tickets	c
refunded	c
considering	i
also	c
that	c
there	c
were	c
no	c
discounts	c
available	c
,	c
as	i
instead	i
it	i
was	c
stated	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

In	c
fact	c
this	c
was	c
the	c
main	c
cause	i
of	i
Mr	c
White	c
's	c
resignation	c
and	c
suicide	c

2000	c

However	c
there	c
are	c
some	c
problems	c
that	c
I	c
hope	c
to	c
solve	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
the	c
only	c
time	c
when	c
I	c
am	c
free	c
from	c
my	c
duties	c
-	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
doctor	c
so	c
you	c
see	c
that	c
I	c
can	i
not	i
let	c
my	c
patients	c
down	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
not	c
telling	i
about	c
some	c
kind	c
of	c
achivements	i
in	c
those	c
discipines	i
but	c
It	i
is	i
my	c
big	c
pasion	i

There	c
is	c
also	c
one	c
thing	c
that	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
You	i
about	c
.	c

Unconected	i
part	i
of	i
every	i
people	i
lifes	i
is	i
shopping	i
.	i

We	c
buy	c
everything	c
from	c
clothes	c
to	c
food	c
and	c
the	c
only	c
thing	c
that	c
could	c
stop	c
us	c
from	c
this	c
are	i
money	c
.	c

It	c
all	c
comes	c
from	c
my	c
parents	c
.	c

All	c
I	c
ought	i
to	c
do	c
is	c
buy	c
and	c
choose	c
.	c

Another	c
situation	c
is	c
when	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
buy	c
somebody	c
a	c
present	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
the	c
prize	c
I	c
won	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
love	c
to	c
do	c
climbing	c
and	c
surfing	c
just	c
because	c
those	c
are	c
sports	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
praticed	i
before	c
,	i
that	i
means	c
I	c
do	c
not	c
have	c
any	c
experience	c
on	i
the	i
subject	i
.	c

It	c
is	c
important	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
know	c
if	c
we	c
need	c
money	i
and	c
in	i
that	i
case	i
,	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
would	c
you	c
recommend	c
me	c
to	i
take	i
?	c

I	c
have	c
heard	c
that	c
the	i
Camp	c
California	c

I	c
hope	c
that	c
I	c
will	c
enjoy	c

for	c
the	c
first	c
time	c

Besides	c
,	c
I	c
will	c

the	c

it	c
'll	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
how	i
I	c
got	c
the	c
position	c
and	c
what	c
I	c
did	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
applied	c
to	c
a	c
concert	c
agency	c
to	c
help	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
had	c
the	c
experience	c
before	c
and	c
I	c
knew	c
how	c
to	c
organize	c
and	c
what	c
to	c
do	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
somewhat	c
hard	c
to	i
me	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
have	c
some	c
questions	c
,	c
let	c
me	c
know	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c

I	c
have	c
just	c
received	c
your	c
letter	c
and	c
feel	c
happy	c
about	c
winning	c

.	c

I	c
am	c
now	c
writing	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
all	c

Also	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
rather	c
than	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c

Also	c
I	c
think	c
I	c
am	c
good	c
at	c
singing	c
and	c
at	c
dancing	c

How	c

Introduction:-	c

The	c
report	c
is	c
based	c
on	c
opinion	i
of	c
more	c
than	c
300	c
pupils	c
.	c

According	c
to	c
the	c
answer	i
there	i
are	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
activities	c
pupils	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
film	c
(	c
80	c
per	c
cent	c
of	c
those	c
questioned	c
)	i

-	c
pupils	i
'	c
travel	i
to	c
London	c
,	c
during	c
the	c
last	c
holiday	c
,	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
great	c
!	c

Furthermore	c
I	c
am	c
really	c
keen	c
on	c
swimming	c
and	c
can	c
therefore	c
hardly	c
await	i
having	i
the	c
possibility	i
to	c
learn	c
the	c
butterfly	c
as	c
a	c
new	c
style	c
since	c
I	c
am	c
already	c
perfect	c
in	i
crawl	i
.	c

I	c
know	c
I	c
have	c
already	c
asked	c
a	c
lot	c
but	c
there	c
is	c
one	c
more	c
thing	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
know	i
which	i
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
will	c
be	c
appropriate	c
and	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
will	c
I	c
approximately	i
need	i
?	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

how	i
are	c
you	c
doing	c
?	c

I	c
helped	c
at	c
a	c
pop	i
concert	i
of	i
a	i
newcomer	i
group	i
and	c
you	c
ca	c
n't	c
imagine	c
how	c
exciting	c
it	c
was	c
!	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
helped	c
selling	c
tickets	c
and	c
drinks	c
and	c
there	c
I	c
realized	c
how	c
bad	c
my	c
maths	c
is	c
-	c
I	c
took	c
such	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
to	c
give	c
back	c
the	c
change	c
!	c

I	c
really	c
had	c
butterflies	c
in	c
my	c
stomach	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
responsible	c
for	c
the	c
lightening	i
!	c

But	c
the	c
cherry	c
on	c
the	c
cake	c
was	c
that	c
I	c
met	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
handsome	c
singers	c
back	i
stage	i
!	c

He	c
asked	c
me	c
what	c
I	c
was	c
doing	c
and	c
so	c
on	c
and	c
finally	c
invited	c
me	c
for	i
his	c
next	c
concert	c
!	c

Of	c
course	c
I	c
agreed	c
-	c
I	c
would	c
n't	c
want	c
to	c
miss	c
the	c
chance	c
to	c
gain	c
experience	c
while	c
having	c
fun	c
!	c

Perhaps	c
I	c
could	c
help	c
regularly	c
in	c
the	c
lightening	i
area	c
-	c
it	c
would	c
help	c
me	c
for	i
my	c
studies	i
of	i
photography	i
.	c

What	c
do	c
you	c
reckon	c
?	c

I	c
can	c
hardly	c
await	i
your	c
reply	c
!	c

Lot	i

I	c

it	i
is	c
everyting	i

you	i

The	c
next	c
point	c
is	c
the	c
accommodation	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
interested	c
in	c
tennis	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
am	c
also	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
photography	c
.	c

It	c
has	c
been	c
my	c
hobby	c
since	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
child	c
.	c

That	c
is	c
why	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
continue	c
doing	c
this	c
at	c
the	c
camp	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

As	c
well	c
as	c
that	c
,	c
some	c
shop-assistance	i
can	c
give	c
you	c
a	c
lower	c
price	c
,	c
because	c
you	c
always	c
do	c
shopping	c
at	c
their	c
shop	c
.	c

What	c
is	c
more	c
,	c
most	c
people	c
cannot	c
live	c
without	c
shopping	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
some	c
minuses	c
.	c

On	i
top	i
of	i
that	i
,	c
shopping	c
is	c
very	c
tiring	c
and	c
exhausting	c
.	c

Walking	c
from	c
shop	c
to	c
shop	c
carrying	c
heavy	c
bags	c
,	c
takes	c
much	c
of	c
your	c
time	c
.	c

Instead	c
of	c
that	c
you	c
could	c
do	c
more	c
interesting	c
things	c
.	i

Besides	c
that	c
,	c
shopping	c
steal	i
you	i
from	i
money	i
.	c

From	c
my	c
point	c
of	c
view	c
it	c
depands	i
on	c
us	c
if	i
shopping	c
will	c
be	c
enjoyable	c
or	c
not	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Ryan	c
,	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
some	c
questions	c
.	c

How	c
much	c
money	c
should	c
I	c
take	c
with	c
me	c
?	c

Marlene	c
Berg	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

How	c
are	c
you	c
?	c

I	c
hope	c
fine	i
.	c

Me	i
,	i
fine	c
,	c
because	c
of	i
helping	c
at	c
the	c
concert	c
'	i
The	c
Dome	c
'	c
.	c

I	c
can	c
say	c
that	c
this	c
was	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
best	c
experiences	c
of	c
my	c
life	c
.	c

First	c
I	c
have	i
help	i
to	c
cook	i
coffee	c
and	c
make	i
food	c
for	c
popular	i
people	i
like	c
Mariah	c
Carey	c
,	c
Elton	c
John	c
,	c
Backstreet	c
Boys	c
,	c
Echt	i
ect	i
...	c

Kim	c
,	c
check	i
it	i
in	i
your	i
mind	i
,	c
I	c
have	c
had	c
near	i
contact	c
with	c
Mariah	c
Carey	c
!	c

It	c
was	c
just	c
great	c
and	c
after	c
this	c
event	c
I	c
can	c
say	c
that	c
popular	i
people	i
are	c
normal	c
humans	c
like	c
everyone	c
!	i

Love	c
,	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
is	c
far	c
away	c
from	c
being	c
the	c
best	c
musical	c
show	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

After	c
that	c
,	c
I	c
became	c
even	c
more	c
angry	c
because	c
,	c
as	c
far	c
as	c
I	c
concerne	i
,	c
the	c
show	c
must	c
begin	c
on	c
time	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
started	c
forty	i
five	i
minutes	c
late	c
.	c

Yours	c
Sincerelly	i
,	c

It	c
is	c
such	c
an	c
evolution	c
for	c
human	i
race	c
,	c
however	c
we	i
can	i
not	i
forget	c
that	c
it	c
can	c
cause	c
some	c
problems	c
too	c
.	c

In	i
the	i
other	i
hand	i
,	c
technology	c
has	c
made	i
the	c
differences	c
between	c
-	i
poor	c
and	c
rich	c
people	c
to	c
grow	i
at	i
a	i
high	i
level	i
,	c
and	c
this	c
is	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
biggest	c
causes	c
of	c
violence	c
in	c
all	c
countries	c
.	c

I	i
addition	c
to	c
that	c
,	c
people	c
will	c
always	c
be	c
affraid	i
of	c
the	i
technological	c
war	c
.	c

And	c
I	c
prefer	c
tents	c
to	c
log	c
cabins	c
,	c
as	c
I	c
know	c
tents	c
better	c
than	c
log	c
cabins	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
very	c
kind	c
for	i
you	c
to	c
give	c
me	c
the	c
chance	c
to	c
do	c
two	c
activities	c
while	c
I	c
am	c
at	c
the	c
Camp	c
.	c

I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
have	i
climbing	c
and	c
sailing	c
.	c

I	c
often	c
go	c
climbing	c
in	c
my	c
town	c
.	c

For	i
sailing	c
,	c
well	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
n't	c
try	i
it	c
before	c
,	i
that	i
is	c
why	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
try	i
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
must	c
be	c
fun	c
.	c

By	c
the	c
way	c
what	i
kinds	c
of	c
clothes	c
do	c
you	c
think	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
get	i
with	c
me	c
?	c

And	c
is	c
there	c
anything	c
eles	i
I	c
have	c
to	c
get	i
with	c
me	c
?	c

Because	c
so	c
far	c
as	c
I	c
know	c
nothing	c
is	c
enjoyable	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
.	c

Yes	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
true	c
,	i
this	i
is	c
only	c
because	c
nowadays	c
people	c
have	c
more	c
money	c
than	c
even	i
before	c
,	c
and	c
some	c
women	c
do	c
n't	c
earn	c
money	c
,	i
they	i
have	c
no	c
idea	c
how	c
diffcult	i
to	i
earn	c
the	i
money	c
.	c

Just	c
imagine	c
if	c
one	c
day	c
their	c
husbands	c
lost	c
their	c
jobs	c
,	i
will	i
those	c
women	c
still	c
thinking	i
shopping	c
is	c
enjoyable	c
!	c

I	c
even	c
hate	c
shopping	c
.	c

How	c
can	c
you	c
face	i
the	i
same	c
goods	c
at	c
the	c
same	c
shop	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
eyes	c
they	c
are	c
wasting	c
their	c
lifes	i
,	c
they	c
are	c
hopeless	c
.	c

Dear	c
Jane	c
Clark	c
,	c

Stars	i
and	c
artists	c
wee	i
only	i
from	i
six	c
countries	c

Some	c
concert	c
halls	c
were	c
too	c
small	c
.	c

So	c
it	c
was	c
impossible	c
to	c
get	c
tickets	c
there	c
.	c

3	c
.	c

It	c
would	c
be	c
wonderful	c
to	c
buy	c
some	c
books	c
or	c
programms	i
with	c
signatures	i
of	c
all	c
the	c
stars	c
and	c
artists	c
taking	c
part	c
in	c
the	c
festival	c
.	c

Hello	c
Philip	c
,	c

I	c
have	c
just	c
got	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
a	c
pleasure	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
communicate	i
with	c
such	c
a	c
friend	c
as	c
you	c
are	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
.	c

In	c
our	c
school	c
we	c
have	c
the	c
following	c
rules	c
:	c
1	c
.	c

One	c
should	c
have	c
such	c
marks	c
as	c
,,3	c
"	c
,	c
,,4	c
"	c
,	c
,,5	c
"	c
not	i
,,2	c
"	c
which	i
is	c
eaqual	i
to	i
fail	i
.	c

3	c
.	c

These	c
rules	c
are	c
strict	c
and	c
certainly	c
we	c
have	c
endless	i
number	c
of	c
just-so-called	i
rules	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
think	c
you	c
will	c
be	c
interested	c
in	c
them	c
.	c

Love	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Helen	c
,	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
is	i
would	c
be	c
better	c
to	c
stay	c
tents	i
,	c
so	c
than	i
we	c
can	c
have	c
a	c
nice	c
time	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
and	c
find	c
many	c
interesting	c
games	c
to	c
play	c
in	i
.	c

Despite	c
the	i
small	i
expereance	i
in	c
climbing	c
I	c
do	c
want	c
to	c
try	c
this	c
type	c
of	c
sport	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
enterwed	i
each	c
student	c
from	c
my	c
English	c
class	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
express	c
my	c
profound	c
gratitude	c
for	c
an	i
excellent	c
organisation	c
of	c
an	i
annual	c
international	c
arts	c
festival	c
,	c
where	c
I	c
spent	c
two	c
days	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
the	c
festival	c
could	c
be	c
even	c
better	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

Besides	i
,	c
I	c
was	c
fascinated	c
by	c
the	c
plays	c
and	c
films	c
and	c
you	c
could	c
probably	c
organize	c
some	c
more	c
.	c

Wuthering	c
Heights	c
-	c
Emily	c
Brontë	c

However	c
,	c
reading	c
an	c
unusual	c
,	c
sometimes	c
fantastic	i
story	c
we	c
could	c
dream	c
about	c
fairy	c
lands	c
and	c
observe	c
our	c
world	c
from	c
another	c
point	c
of	c
view	c
.	c

I	c
consider	c
"	c
Wuthering	c
Heights	c
"	c
by	c
Emily	c
Brontë	c
to	c
be	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
books	c
that	c
wash	c
away	c
from	c
the	c
soul	c
the	c
dust	c
of	c
everyday	i
's	i
routine	c
.	c

It	c
contributes	c
to	c
the	c
world	i
treasurehouse	i
of	c
literature	c
and	c
arouses	c
irresistable	i
fascination	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
abut	i
this	c
big	c
opportunity	c
you	c
give	i
me	c
to	c
visit	c
this	i
wonderful	c
place	c
like	i
California	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
only	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
my	c
boss	c
can	i
not	i
give	c
me	c
a	i
leaving	i
for	c
the	c
other	c
months	c
of	i
Summer	i
.	c

Also	c
,	c
I	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
tents	i
because	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
good	c
chance	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
live	c
with	c
the	i
nature	c
and	c
to	c
wake	c
up	c
listening	i
birds	c
which	c
singing	i
.	c

Also	c
I	c
like	c
a	i
lot	i
music	i
and	c
everybody	c
tells	c
me	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
a	c
good	c
voice	c
.	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

how	c
are	c
you	c
?	c

The	c
concert	c
lasted	c
four	i
hours	c
and	c
in	i
the	c
end	c
they	c
wanted	c
to	c
pay	c
me	c
.	c

OK	c
!	c

I	c
'm	c
waiting	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

Margaret	c

Thuesday	i
13th	c
June	c
2000	c

I	c
'd	c
rather	c
have	c
accommodation	c
in	c
tents	c
,	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
good	c
experience	c
for	c
me	c
especially	i
because	c
I	c
have	c
n't	c
lived	i
it	i
as	i
well	i
as	i
it	i
is	i
more	i
romantic	i
.	c

As	c
you	c
have	c
informed	c
me	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
activities	c
that	c
we	c
can	c
do	c
.	c

The	i
swimming	i
is	c
my	c
best	i
sport	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
I	c
will	c
have	c
the	c
opportunity	c
to	c
play	c
basketball	c
,	c
despite	c
the	c
fact	c
that	c
I	c
am	c
not	c
too	i
tall	c
for	c
this	c
kind	c
of	c
sport	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
would	c
you	c
mind	c
to	i
send	i
me	c
more	c
information	c
about	c
the	c
amount	c
of	c
money	c
that	c
I	c
should	c
have	i
.	c

It	c
considers	c
two	c
points	i
:	c
the	c
lessons	c
and	c
activities	i
which	c
should	c
be	c
filmed	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
of	c
the	c
opinion	c
that	c
the	c
morning	c
English	c
lessons	c
with	c
our	c
teacher	c
George	i
are	i
worth	c
filming	c
and	c
showing	c
for	c
many	c
reasons	c
.	c

All	c
of	c
us	c
participate	c
effectively	i
.	c

Nobody	c
is	c
yawning	c
or	c
feeling	c
bored	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
we	c
are	c
lucky	c
with	c
our	c
competent	c
teachers	c
.	c

There	c
are	c
many	c
activities	c
that	c
they	i
could	c
be	c
filmed	c
.	c

To	c
Whom	c
It	c
May	c
Concern	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
extremely	c
excited	c
about	c
the	c
camp	c
!	c

For	c
the	c
camp	c
,	c
you	c
need	c
some	c
information	c
from	c
me	c
,	c
do	c
n't	c
you	c
?	c

First	c
,	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
on	i
July	c
because	c
my	c
friend	c
,	c
who	c
is	c
French	c
,	c
is	c
coming	c
to	c
Toronto	c
on	i
August	c
.	c

Second	c
,	c
I	c
prefer	c
log	c
cabins	c
than	i
tents	c
.	c

Third	c
,	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
choose	c
painting	c
and	c
surfing	c
for	c
the	c
activities	c
.	c

Also	c
,	c
painting	c
is	c
one	c
of	c
my	c
favorite	i
things	c
!	c

And	c
I	c
always	c
wanted	c
to	c
learn	c
how	c
to	c
paint	c
.	c

And	c
if	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
bring	c
some	c
money	c
could	c
you	c
suggest	c
me	i
the	c
amount	c
?	c

I	c
really	c
appreciate	c
your	c
choosing	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
really	c
looking	c
forward	c
this	i
camp	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c

Dear	c
Kim	c

Anyway	c
,	c
I	c
really	c
enjoyed	c
helpying	i
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
last	c
month	c
so	c
that	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
write	c
them	i
down	i
!	c

Then	c
,	c
the	c
day	c
of	c
the	c
concert	c
came	c

While	c
we	c
were	c
organizing	c
the	c
concert	c
,	c
she	c
was	c
singing	c
on	c
a	c
stage	c
.	c

I	c
just	c
imagined	c
what	c
it	c
was	c
like	c
to	c
be	c
a	c
singer	c
.	c

If	c
only	c
I	c
could	c
sing	c
beautifully	c
!	c

Everybody	c
looked	c
very	c
excited	c
about	c
the	c
concert	c
.	c

We	c
saw	c
some	c
very	c
strange	c
fans	c
but	c
most	c
of	c
them	c
were	c
quite	c
nice	c
.	c

Also	c
,	c
we	c
got	c
some	c
posteres	i
as	c
well	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
great	c
experience	c
for	c
me	c
and	c
my	c
friend	c
.	c

By	c
the	c
way	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
I	c
should	c
go	c
.	c

Please	c
take	c
care	c
and	c
please	c
write	c
to	c
me	c
,	c
right	c

is	c
the	c
miserable	c
situation	c
the	c
other	c
character	i
have	c
put	c
him	c
in	c
.	c

This	c
revenge	c
links	c
the	c
story	c
so	i
without	c
it	c
we	c
would	c
not	c
have	c
such	c
"	c
Wuthering	c
Heights	c
"	c
.	c

I	c
sympathize	c
with	c
Heathcliff	c
because	c
I	c
think	c
every	c
bad	c
character	c
is	c
a	c
very	c
important	c
point	i
of	c
every	c
book	c
,	c
film	c
or	c
play	c
and	c
if	c
they	c
were	c
missing	c
we	c
would	c
not	c
love	c
those	c
stories	c
we	c
enjoyed	c
while	c
we	c
were	c
reading	c
them	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
of	c
13	c
June	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
happy	c
to	c
have	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
sleep	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
think	c
is	i
a	i
great	c
fun	c
and	c
a	c
bit	c
more	c
adventurous	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
be	c
grateful	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
tell	c
me	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
with	c
and	i
how	c
many	i
money	c
,	c
more	c
or	c
less	c
,	c
do	i
you	c
think	c
I	c
should	c
take	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
to	i
ask	i
me	c
my	i
taste	i
and	c
to	i
be	i
preoccupated	i
about	i
it	i
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c
.	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

Then	c
I	c
put	c
some	i
blue	c
lights	c
.	c

The	c
most	c
exiting	i
part	c
was	c
when	c
I	c
had	c
to	i
make	i
up	i
the	c
pop	i
stars	i
!	i

I	c
never	c
had	c
met	c
pop	c
stars	c
before	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
impresed	i
,	c
but	c
I	c
was	c
too	c
happy	c
to	c
show	c
my	c
shyness	c
.	c

Do	c
you	c
believe	c
that	c
I	c
spoke	c
with	c
Micheal	c
Jackson	c
,	c
my	c
favourite	c
singer	c
?	c

I	c
ca	c
n't	c
believe	c
it	c
yet	c
!	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
wonderful	c
experience	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
like	i
a	i
dream	i
who	i
becomes	i
tru	i
.	c

I	c
wish	c
you	c
had	c
been	c
there	c
with	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
ca	c
n't	c
explain	c
how	c
supper	i
it	c
was	c
.	c

I	c
stayed	c
with	c
him	c
until	c
the	c
concert	c
begun	i
and	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
I	c
had	c
the	c
opportunity	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
his	c
private	c
room	c
with	c
him	c
and	c
the	c
other	c
dansers	i
.	c

Audrey	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
the	c
play	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
start	c
at	c
7:30	c
P.M.	c
but	c
it	c
actually	c
started	c
only	i
at	c
8:15	c
P.M.	c
so	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
wait	c
forty-five	c
minutes	c
.	c

When	c
the	c
play	c
finally	c
started	c
,	c
and	c
the	c
two	c
actors	c
entered	c
the	c
stage	c
,	c
I	c
could	c
see	c
that	c
the	c
male	c
one	c
was	c
not	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
differently	i
from	i
what	c
the	c
advertisement	c
sign	i
says	c
,	c
what	i
really	c
disappointed	c
me	c
since	c
he	c
was	c
the	c
only	c
reason	c
that	c
I	c
came	c
to	c
this	c
play	c
.	c

After	c
the	c
disappointing	c
performance	c
the	i
actor	c
who	c
replaced	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
,	c
and	c
,	c
also	c
differing	i
from	i
the	c
advertisement	c
sign	i
,	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

There	c
was	c
only	c
a	c
small	c
sign	c
stamped	i
on	c
the	c
door	c
,	c
saying	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
"	c
closed	c
for	c
repairs	c
"	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
unfortunately	c
,	c
I	c
must	c
say	c
that	c
last	c
night	c
was	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
worst	c
nights	c
I	c
ever	c
had	c
,	c
and	c
given	i
the	c
reasons	c
,	c
I	c
expect	c
to	i
count	c
with	i
your	c
sense	c
of	c
responsability	i
,	c
so	c
,	c
I	c
feel	c
that	c
I	c
must	c
ask	c
for	c
my	c
20	c
pounds	c
spent	i
on	c
that	c
terrible	c
night	c
.	c

How	c
has	c
modern	c
technology	c
changed	c
your	c
daily	c
life	c
?	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

After	c
having	c
read	c
your	c
letter	c
,	c
I	c
write	i
to	c
you	c
to	c
inform	c
you	c
that	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
.	c

Last	c
but	c
not	c
least	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
sailing	c
and	c
climbing	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
sailed	c
some	i
in	c
my	c
youth	c
but	c
have	c
never	c
went	i
climbing	c
.	c

It	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
fun	c
experiance	i
!	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Neville	c

P.S	c
.	c

Does	c
any	c
medication	c
have	i
to	c
be	c
declared	c
to	c
them	c
?	c

In	i
case	i
of	i
any	i
accidents	i
,	c
will	c
the	c
transport	c
back	c
home	c
be	c
paid	c
for	c
?	c

Why	c
can	i
shopping	i
be	i
unenjoyable	i
?	c

Some	c
people	c
are	c
boring	c
to	c
shop	c
with	c
,	c
they	c
do	c
n't	c
talk	c
or	c
comment	c
anything	i
they	c
see	c
.	c

Women	c
,	c
in	c
perticular	i
,	c
have	c
the	c
annoying	c
habit	c
of	c
always	c
having	c
to	c
touch	c
everything	c
they	c
see	c
.	c

We	c
all	c
know	c
how	c
it	c
is	c
when	c
a	c
woman	c
tried	i
on	c
some	c
clothes	c
(	c
usually	c
several	c
)	i
but	c
it	i
's	i
still	c
better	c
than	c
when	c
we	c
're	c
talking	c
about	c
shoes	c
!	c

Seeing	c
or	c
imagining	c
a	c
woman	c
in	c
the	c
cloths	i
she	c
chooses	c
can	c
at	c
least	c
help	c
when	c
being	i
bored	c
,	c
but	c
shoes	c
are	c
just	c
shoes	c
.	c

It	c
seems	c
to	c
last	c
forever	c
and	c
just	c
when	c
you	c
think	c
she	c
's	c
done	c
,	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
"	c
over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
"	c
.	c

I	c
recently	c
booked	c
a	c
week	c
's	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
to	i
see	c
the	c
musical	c
"	c
over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
"	c
the	i
date	c
was	c
the	c
9th	c
of	c
June	c
2000.	i
from	i
your	c
firm	c
.	c

The	c
theatre	c
Restaurant	c
that	c
should	c
be	c
open	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
the	c
chief	i
was	c
ill	c
and	c
there	c
was	c
no	c
food	c
in	c
the	c
fridge	c
.	c

How	c
should	i
she	c
manage	c
to	c
keep	c
quiet	c
about	c
this	c
.	i

This	c
was	c
the	c
best	c
thing	c
that	c
ever	i
had	i
happend	i
in	i
years	i
for	i
the	i
Fennall	i
family	i
.	c

Maria	c
was	c
still	c
a	c
little	c
bit	c
chocked	i
over	i
the	c
naus	i
of	i
having	c
a	c
baby	c
.	c

She	c
and	c
her	c
husband	c
Peter	c
had	c
been	c
trying	c
for	c
so	c
long	c
and	c
now	c
they	c
had	c
succeeded	c
.	c

Many	c
weeks	c
went	c
by	c
and	c
Maria	c
and	c
Pat	c
did	c
n't	c
say	c
a	c
word	c
about	c
it	c
.	c

The	c
rest	c
of	c
the	c
family	c
understood	c
that	c
something	c
was	c
wrong	c
because	c
Pat	c
started	c
to	c
buy	c
baby	c
clothes	c
.	c

One	c
day	c
when	c
they	c
all	c
sat	c
down	c
at	c
the	c
kitchen	c
table	c
for	i
having	i
their	c
lunch	c
Pat	c
said	c
,	c

-	c
"	c
Maria	c
and	c
Peter	c
are	c
going	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
baby	c
"	c

However	c
,	c
the	c
most	c

XXXX	c

Also	c
,	c
I	c
'm	c
unhappy	c
about	c
the	c
bad	i
informations	i
of	i
your	c
advertisement	c
,	c
which	c
clearly	c
says	c
,	i
the	c
play	c
begins	c
at	c
19.30	c
instead	i
of	c
20.15	c
as	i
my	c
evening	i
'	i
show	c
.	c

At	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
show	c
,	c
unfortunately	c
for	c
me	c
and	c
the	c
others	i
spectators	c
,	c
the	c
worst	c
thing	c
happened	c
:	c
the	c
theatre	c
's	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
without	c
any	c
reasons	c
and	i
nobody	c
went	i
to	c
us	c
to	c
apologise	c
or	c
advice	i
us	c
for	i
an	i
other	i
restaurant	c
opened	i
late	c
in	i
the	i
night	c
.	c

That	c
's	c
why	c
all	c
his	c
friends	c
were	c
angry	c
against	i
him	c
and	c
let	i
him	c
alone	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
clear	c
that	c
Pat	c
had	c
to	c
change	c
and	c
show	c
to	i
his	c
friend	i
that	c
they	c
can	i
believe	c
in	c
him	c
thrutly	i
.	c

To	i
beginning	i
,	c
every	c
morning	c
Pat	c
says	i
a	c
pleasant	c
"	c
hello	c
"	c
in	i
adding	i
to	c
that	c
a	c
big	c
smail	i
.	c

As	c
Pat	c
does	i
always	i
what	c
his	c
mother	c
says	c
his	c
friends	c
began	c
to	c
play	c
again	i
with	i
him	i
,	c
but	c
not	c
just	c
his	c
old	c
friends	c
,	c
every	i
body	i
wanted	c
to	c
play	c
with	c
me	i
.	c

The	c
morality	i
of	c
the	c
story	c
is	i
here	i
very	c
clear	c
:	c
be	c
nice	c
with	i
the	i
people	c
and	c
the	i
people	c
will	c
respect	c
you	c
and	c
will	c
appreciate	c
you	c
as	c
a	c
friend	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
the	c
information	i
,	i
that	c
I	c
won	c
the	c
competition	c

My	c
favourite	c
sports	c
are	c
climbing	c
and	c
surfing	c
,	i
I	c
'm	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
climbing	c
but	c
for	c
surfing	c
I	c
need	c
some	c
practise	i

Yes	c

I	c
have	c
some	c
questions	c
on	i

what	i
should	c
I	c
take	c
with	c
me	c
and	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
will	c
I	c
need	c
?	c

I	c
hope	c

I	c
was	c
able	c
to	c

your	c
questions	c

you	c

because	c
maybe	c
is	i
more	c
interesting	c
to	c
share	c
with	c
other	c

In	i

you	c
ask	i
me	c
I	c
have	c
the	c
chance	c
for	i
to	c
choose	c
two	c
activities	c
while	c
I	c
am	c
at	c

for	c
these	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

I	c
think	c
this	c
topic	c
is	c
so	c
exciting	c
in	i
the	c
antropological	i
and	c
psicological	i
point	c
of	c
view	c
,	c
because	c
we	c
can	c
studie	i
the	c
reaction	i
before	c
,	c
during	c
and	c
after	c
to	i
shopping	c
.	c

For	c
the	i
men	c
and	c
women	c
is	i
important	i
the	i
appearance	i
and	c
they	c
spent	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
money	c
in	i
buy	i
clothes	c
,	c
cosmetic	i
,	c
accesories	i
,	c
jewels	i
etc.	c
And	c
the	i
other	c
they	i
choose	i
sometimes	i
just	c
for	c
the	c
label	c

In	i
the	i
other	i
hand	i
the	c
facilities	c
for	c
access	c
to	c
mall	i
center	i
is	i
not	c
good	c

Otherwise	c
shopping	c
will	i
be	c
more	c
enjoyable	c

Mr	c

I	c
was	c
expecting	c
to	c
have	c
fun	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
play	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
,	c
thats	i
now	c
presenting	i
in	c
your	c
theatre	c
.	c

I	c
read	c
the	c
advertisement	c
and	c
I	c
thought	c
it	c
was	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
a	c
plesent	i
evening	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
buy	c
the	c
ticket	c
I	c
tried	c
to	c
get	c
a	c
discount	c
with	c
my	c
student	c
card	c
,	c
but	c
that	c
was	c
not	c
posible	i
.	c

I	c
let	c
this	c
pass	c
and	c
I	c
bought	c
it	c
anyway	c
,	c
thinking	c
that	c
was	i
posible	i
that	c
it	i
was	c
only	c
a	c
mistake	c
in	c
your	c
advertisement	c
.	c

All	c
the	c
thing	i
that	c
were	c
promised	c
in	c
your	c
advertisement	c
were	c
not	i
true	i
,	c
and	c
it	c
was	c
definitly	i
NOT	c
the	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
.	c

Specting	i
that	c
you	c
will	c
solve	i
this	c
misunderstanding	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
some	c
of	c
the	c
changes	c
had	i
been	c
very	c
good	c
,	c
like	c
the	c
impruvement	i
to	i
the	i
medical	c
science	c
,	c
that	i
now	c
can	c
saved	i
millions	c
of	c
persons	i
that	c
one	c
hundred	c
years	c
ago	c
were	c
doomed	c
to	c
die	c
or	c
to	c
live	c
miserable	c
lives	c
.	c

The	i
weapons	i
and	c
the	i
factories	c
are	c
destroing	i
our	c
planet	c
and	c
we	c
need	c
to	c
realized	i
that	c
we	c
have	c
to	c
use	c
tecnology	i
to	c
impruve	i
our	c
lives	c
,	c
but	i
always	c
triying	i
to	c
respect	c
nature	c
.	c

Because	c
my	c
summer	c
holidays	c
break	i
is	i
start	c
at	c
end	i
of	c
June	c
.	c

Regarding	c
to	i
the	c
accommodation	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
tents	c
more	i
than	c
log	c
carbins	i
because	c
I	c
have	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
experiences	i
of	c
built	i
up	c
my	c
own	c
tents	c
.	c

Some	c
of	c
the	i
them	c
I	c
really	i
interested	c
in	c
it	i
,	c
especially	c
painting	c
.	c

Since	c
I	c
was	c
young	c
,	c
my	c
dad	c
he	i
alway	i
took	i
me	c
out	i
to	i
have	i
live	i
drawings	i
,	c
so	c
now	c
it	c
became	i
my	i
hobbies	c
.	c

And	c
I	c
think	c
,	i
it	c
is	i
nice	c
to	c
draw	c
the	i
beautiful	c
landscapes	c
of	c
the	c
place	c
.	c

Beside	c
drawings	i
,	c
swimming	c
is	c
my	c
favourite	c
as	c
well	c
.	c

Although	c
I	c
'm	c
not	c
the	c
best	c
,	c
but	i
I	c
have	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
confident	i
in	i
it	c
.	c

Sometimes	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

Because	c
of	c
the	c
crowd	i
.	c

For	c
me	c
I	c
think	c
,	i
it	c
is	c
not	c
shopping	c
that	i
is	i
kind	c
of	c
suffering	c

Dear	c
Mrs.	c
Ryan	c
,	c

You	c
have	i
had	i
some	c
questions	c
which	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
answer	c
now	c
:	c

On	i
the	i
other	i
side	i
I	c
have	c
no	c
experience	c
in	i
surfing	c
,	i
-	c
I	c
am	c
an	c
absolute	c
beginner	c
with	c
high	c
motivation	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Before	c
we	c
can	c
give	c
our	c
opinions	c
on	c
this	c
statemant	i
we	c
have	c
to	c
make	c
sure	c
that	c
everyone	c
knows	c
what	c
we	c
are	c
discussing	c
about	i
.	c

We	c
do	c
not	c
speak	c
here	c
about	c
luxuary	i
goods	c
.	c

But	c
if	c
you	c
realize	c
how	c
important	c
it	i
is	i
for	i
your	i
health	i
what	i
you	i
buy	i
you	c
will	c
go	c
shopping	c
with	c
much	i
more	i
consiousness	i
and	c
joy	i
than	c
before	c
.	c

Reorganize	c
your	c
behaviour	i
of	i
shopping	c
and	c
plan	c
to	c
keep	c
food	c
in	c
stock	c
!	c

This	c
is	c
even	c
an	i
appropriate	i
way	c
to	c
get	c
around	c
unfriendly	i
service	c
you	c
get	c
to	c
know	c
if	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
buy	c
something	c
in	c
a	c
shop	c
right	c
before	c
closing	c
time	c
.	c

You	c
have	c
been	c
presented	c
some	i
causes	i
why	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

There	c
are	c
ways	c
of	c
behaviour	i
to	i
make	i
more	i
fun	i
of	i
it	i
.	c

It	c
depends	c
on	c
every	c
individual	c
to	c
change	c
your	c
mind	c
and	c
act	i
as	i
a	c
'	c
smart	c
'	c
shopper	c
.	c

Recently	c
I	c
am	i
interested	c
in	c
musical	c
shows	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
seen	c
it	i
in	c
my	c
country	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
there	c
were	c
no	c
student	c
discounts	c
!	c

So	c
,	c
I	c
could	c
not	c
concentrate	c
on	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
really	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
!	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

It	c
could	c
be	c
difficult	c
to	c
feel	c
how	c
many	c
things	c
has	i
been	c
changed	c
in	c
our	c
daily	c
life	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
we	i
can	c
be	i
connected	i
other	c
people	c
with	c
a	c
mobile	c
phone	c
no	c
matter	c
where	c
you	c
are	c
and	c
you	c
can	c
correspond	c
to	i
other	i
contry	i
people	i
in	c
real	c
time	c
by	c
using	c
internet	i
.	c

How	c
incredable	i
it	c
is	c
!	c

However	c
not	i
only	c
this	c
advantage	c
but	c
also	i
there	i
are	i
lots	c
of	c
disadvantages	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
I	c
'll	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
travel	c
on	i
July	c
.	c

Then	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
join	c
the	c
activities	c
,	c
swimming	c
and	c
Singing	c
.	c

I	c
used	c
to	c
enjoy	c
floting	i
on	c
the	c
water	c
whenever	c
I	c
was	c
on	c
holiday	c
.	c

We	c
often	c
go	c
out	c
to	c
sing	c
in	c
Karaoke	i

My	c
son	c
experienced	c
winning	c
the	c

I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
that	i
how	c
much	c
monery	i
,	c
how	i
many	c

we	c
need	c

I	c
look	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
your	c
advertisement	c
concerning	c
the	c
Musical	c
show	c
:	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c

"	c
.	c

Your	c
advertisement	c
also	c
failed	c
to	c
mention	c
the	c
fact	c
that	c
there	c
was	i
no	c
discounts	c
what	i
so	i
ever	i
and	c
finally	i
,	c
because	c
of	c
a	c
shortage	c
of	c
staf	i
,	c
your	c
restaurant	c
was	c
not	c
available	i
for	i
us	i
.	c

Carolina	c
Patharius	c

I	c
asked	c
myself	c
how	c
I	c
could	c
be	c
so	c
stupied	i
,	c
telling	c
her	c
my	c
secret	c
after	c
all	c
I	c
been	i
going	c
through	c
to	c
keep	c
it	c
to	c
myself	c
.	c

All	c
of	c
a	c
sudden	c
I	c
started	c
to	c
believe	c
that	c
this	c
was	c
the	c
best	c
solution	c
of	c
all	c
.	c

Now	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
need	c
to	c
go	c
around	c
and	i
worring	i
about	c
it	c
anymore	c
.	c

I	c
pretended	c
to	c
be	c
totaly	i
miserable	c
.	c

Also	i
it	i
made	c
me	c
very	c
disappoint	i
.	c

The	c
first	c
one	c
I	c
am	c
going	c
to	c
complaint	i
about	c
is	c
the	c
actor	c
.	c

There	c
was	c
an	i
different	c
actor	c
instead	c
of	c
him	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
the	c
times	c
,	c
it	c
's	c
available	i
14.30	i
and	c
19.30	c
so	c
I	c
choose	i
19.30	c
.	c

However	c
it	i
was	c
deleied	i
it	i
started	c
20.15	i
.	c

Another	c
example	c
,	c
the	c
internet	i
.	c

I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
circle	c
theatre	c
to	c
see	c
a	c
musical	c
show	c
,	c
OVER	c
THE	c
RAINBOW	c
.	c

Even	c
if	c
one	c
of	c
your	c
woman	c
officer	c
annoyed	c
my	c
question	c
,	c
I	c
asked	c
that	c
why	c
they	c
did	c
n't	c
prepare	c
restaurant	c
,	c
as	c
if	c
they	c
advertised	c
like	c
that	c
.	c

Unfortunely	i
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

Pat	c
talks	i
others	i
secrets	c
to	c
everyone	c
easily	c
.	c

His	c
girl	i
friend	i
talked	c
to	c
him	c
everything	i
.	c

It	c
was	c
about	c
his	c
private	c
problem	c
,	c
related	c
his	i
friendship	i
in	c
whole	i
school	c
.	c

But	c
sometimes	c
,	c
Pat	c
mistakes	i
to	i
speak	i
someone	c
's	c
secrets	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
like	c
his	i
one	i
of	i
bad	c
habbits	i
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c

It	c
began	c
at	c
20:15	c
and	c
not	c
at	c
19:30	c

I	c
had	c
read	c
that	c
there	c
would	c
be	c
available	i
some	i

,	c
but	c
I	c
became	i
none	c
of	c
them	c

It	c
was	c
n't	c
a	c

In	i

nobody	c

My	c
day	c
,	c
for	c

begins	c
with	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
noise	c

The	c

me	c
up	c
at	c
half	c

After	c
breakfeast	i
I	c
have	c
to	c
use	c
my	c

At	c
school	c
the	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
:	c

I	c
have	c
decided	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
visit	c
Camp	c
California	c
only	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
already	c
organized	c
an	i
other	i
trip	c
for	c
the	c
month	c
of	c
august	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
rather	i
prefer	c
sleeping	c
in	c
log	i
cabins	i
if	c
its	i
possible	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
back	c
problems	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
not	c
allowed	c
to	c
sleep	c
on	c
the	c
ground	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
also	c
chosen	c
as	c
activities	c
the	c
ones	i
of	c
Golf	c
and	c
tennis	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
and	c
what	c
type	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
need	c
.	c

Do	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
with	i
me	i
my	i
tennis	i
raquet	i
and	i
my	i
golf	i
bag	i
?	c

I	c
'm	c
fine	c
.	c

Boy	c
,	c
He	i
's	i
really	c
really	c
handsom	i
!	c

I	c
was	c
in	c
charge	c
of	c
the	c
lights	i
of	i
the	i
stage	i
,	c
you	c
know	c
,	c
all	c
those	c
colourful	c
lights	c
that	c
go	c
all	c
around	c
the	c
stage	c
.	c

Even	c
though	c
I	c
ended	c
terribly	i
tired	c
I	c
really	c
enjoyed	c
myself	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
strange	c
experience	c
because	c
its	i
something	c
new	c
for	i
me	c
.	c

Write	c
to	c
me	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c
,	c
please	c
!	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

Secondly	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
had	i
to	c
begin	c
at	c
19.30	c
pm	c
,	c
in	i
fact	i
he	i
began	c
at	c
20.15	c
pm	c
and	c
that	c
without	i
any	c
explainations	i
!	c

After	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
visit	c
your	c
restaurant	c
and	c
once	i
again	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
disappointed	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

I	c
can	c
assure	c
you	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
a	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
and	c
I	c
got	c
very	c
annoyed	c
about	c
this	c
evening	c
which	c
could	c
have	c
been	c
wonderful	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
to	c
work	c
out	c
all	c
my	c
figures	c
two	c
times	c
to	c
make	c
sure	c
that	c
my	c
accounts	c
were	c
accurate	c
.	c

If	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
find	c
out	i
timetables	i
,	c
it	c
is	c
very	c
useful	c
to	c
have	c
the	c
possibility	i
to	c
see	c
on	i
the	c
Internet	c
,	c
besides	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
the	c
quickest	c
way	c
!	c

Dear	c
Mrs.	c
Ryan	c
,	c

That	c
's	c
why	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
great	c
if	c
I	c
could	c
make	c
that	c
journey	c
to	c
the	c
U.S.	c
in	c
July	c
.	c

Swimming	c
is	c
an	c
activity	c
I	c
do	i
since	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
boy	c
,	i
I	c
still	c
enjoy	c
swimming	c
especially	i
when	c
it	c
's	c
in	c
the	c
sea	c
,	c
although	c
I	c
never	c
took	c
part	c
in	c
competition	i
,	c
that	i
means	c
I	c
do	i
swimming	c
just	c
for	c
fun	c
.	c

Usually	c
I	c
take	i
just	i
holiday	c
pictures	c
to	c
look	c
at	c
when	c
I	c
'm	c
back	c
home	c
but	c
when	c
I	c
have	c
enough	c
time	c
-	c
sometimes	c
-	c
I	c
like	c
to	c
take	c
pictures	c
that	c
have	c
a	c
slight	c
touch	c
of	c
art	c
....	c

Yours	c

The	c
children	c
are	c
seven	c
to	c
eight	c
years	c
old	c
.	c

The	c
video	c
that	c
will	c
be	c
made	c
should	c
demonstrate	c
how	i
day	i
in	c
school	c
is	c
like	c
.	c

-	c
The	c
first	c
lesson	c
will	c
deal	c
with	c
animals	c
on	c
a	c
farm	c
.	c

I	c
will	c
show	c
pictures	c
of	c
animals	c
and	c
the	c
children	c
will	c
tell	c
me	c
the	c
name	i
of	c
that	i
animal	i
.	c

-	c
Later	c
on	c
we	c
'll	c
go	i
to	i
sing	i
the	c
song	c
of	i
"	c
Old	c
McDonald	c
had	c
a	c
farm	c
"	c
.	c

-	c
The	c
third	c
part	c
of	c
the	c
film	c
will	c
show	c
the	c
children	c
's	c
painting	c
work	c
"	c
Animals	c
on	c
a	c
farm	c
"	c
.	c

-	c
Some	c
sequences	c
of	i
the	c
gym-lesson	i
should	c
conclude	c
the	c
part	c
of	c
the	c
film	c
showing	c
the	c
children	c
at	c
work	c
,	c
but	c
there	c
should	c
follow	c
another	c
short	c
part	c
that	c
presents	i
how	c
children	i
have	c
their	c
lunch	c
and	c
spend	c
their	c
free-time	i
,	c
what	c
games	c
they	c
play	c
in	c
the	c
school-yard	i
and	c
how	c
they	c
have	i
contact	i
with	c
each	c
other	c
.	c

Each	c
part	c
of	c
the	c
film	c
mentioned	c
above	c
should	c
not	c
be	c
longer	c
than	c
5	c
to	c
10	c
minutes	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

Firstly	c
,	c
the	c
actor	c
suppossed	i
to	c
be	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
but	c
he	c
was	c
not	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
another	c
actor	c
,	c
who	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
seen	c
before	c
,	c
so	c
,	c
as	c
you	c
can	c
imagen	i
,	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
disappointed	c
.	c

Another	c
complain	i
is	c
about	c
the	c
time	c
that	c
the	c
musical	i
show	c
started	c
,	i
the	i
advertisement	c
said	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
19:30	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
did	c
not	c
,	i
we	i
had	c
to	c
wait	c
45	c
minutes	c
.	c

Now	c
,	c
about	c
the	c
tickets	c
,	c
the	i
were	c
different	c
prices	c
but	c
there	c
were	c
not	i
discounts	c
,	c
and	c
because	c
of	c
this	c
,	c
many	c
people	c
could	c
not	c
see	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
especially	c
students	c
.	c

Looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
,	c
so	c
Maria	c
was	c
very	c
disappointed	c
when	c
she	c
realised	c
that	c
Manuel	c
knew	c
the	c
truth	c
about	c
the	c
feelings	c
that	c
Maria	c
had	c
for	c
him	c
,	c
in	c
fact	c
,	c
she	c
was	c
so	c
angry	c
she	c
almost	i
kill	c
but	i
,	c
she	c
could	c
n't	c
because	c
Pat	c
was	c
her	c
best	c
friend	c
.	c

Maria	c
talked	c
to	c
Pat	c
about	c
the	c
stupid	c
thing	c
that	c
she	c
did	i
,	c
but	c
Pat	c
refused	c
to	c
apologaising	i
to	c
her	c
,	c
because	c
she	c
felt	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
a	c
mistake	c
and	c
she	c
did	c
it	c
for	c
only	c
one	c
reason	c
:	c
help	i
Maria	c
to	c
get	c
the	c
man	c
that	c
she	c
loved	c
.	c

Maria	c
was	c
speechless	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
the	c
first	c
time	c
that	c
she	c
did	c
n't	c
know	c
what	c
to	c
do	c
,	c
so	c
she	c
decided	c
to	c
stop	c
talking	c
to	c
Pat	c
.	c

Some	i
friends	i
phoned	c
her	c
everyday	i
,	c
except	c
Pat	c
,	c
the	c
only	c
friend	c
that	c
Maria	c
really	c
loved	c
,	i
despite	i
that	c
,	c
she	c
was	c
not	c
sad	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
during	c
the	c
camp	c
,	c
as	c
I	c
find	c
tents	c
a	c
lot	c
more	c
exciting	c
than	c
log	c
cabins	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
a	c
very	c
good	c
swimmer	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
choose	c
swimming	c
from	c
the	c
activities	c
you	c
listed	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
also	c
very	c
keen	c
on	c
climbing	c
,	c
although	c
I	c
am	c
not	c
extremely	c
good	c
at	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Most	c
people	c
enjoy	c
shopping	c
.	c

The	c
most	c
annoying	c
thing	c
about	c
shopping	c
is	c
that	c
in	c
most	c
cases	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
search	c
for	c
a	c
particular	c
stuff	i
for	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
and	c
visit	c
several	c
shops	c
before	c
you	c
find	c
something	c
that	c
suits	c
you	c
.	c

You	c
get	c
really	c
angry	c
trying	c
to	c
find	c
a	c
bigger	c
one	c
but	c
unfortunately	c
this	c
is	c
the	c
last	c
one	c
.	c

And	c
suddenly	c
you	c
notice	c
the	c
identical	c
but	c
cheaper	c
one	c
in	c
the	c
next	c
shop	c
.	c

Dear	c
Madam	c
,	c

With	c
regard	c
to	c
your	c
letter	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c

you	c
for	c
making	c
possible	c
such	i
a	i
wonderful	i
event	i
as	i
your	i
competition	i
is	i
.	c

If	c
it	c
was	i
possible	c
id	i
prefer	c
to	c
pass	i
the	c
two	c
weeks	c
mentioned	c
in	c
your	c
letter	c
during	c
July	c
.	c

My	c
two	c
activities	c
chosen	c
from	c
the	c

Nowadays	c
shopping	c
is	c
considered	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
most	c
usual	c
and	c
enjoyable	c
activities	c
,	c
especially	c
if	c
you	c
are	c
a	c
woman	c
and	c
you	c
are	c
out	c
to	c
buy	c
clothes	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
who	c
is	c
your	c
companion	c
?	c

If	c
you	c
take	c
mum	i
shopping	c
the	c
right	i
day	c
she	i
has	c
been	c
all	i
day	i
doing	i
housework	i
,	c
that	c
will	c
probably	c
end	c
in	c
discussion	i
.	c

You	c
are	c
feeling	c
sick	c
,	c
angry	i
with	c
your	c
boyfriend	c

How	c
do	i
you	c

to	c

that	c
anything	c

Sir	i
manager	c

Yesterday	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
"	c
The	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
"	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
"	c
OVER	c
THE	c
RAINBOW	c
"	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
very	c
disappointed	c
of	i
this	c
evening	c
.	c

There	c
was	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
and	c
he	c
was	c
really	c
bad	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
advertisement	c
you	c
wrote	c
that	c
discounts	c
are	c
available	c
but	c
they	c
were	c
n't	c
.	c

After	c
the	c
show	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
drink	c
somthing	i
in	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
but	c
when	c
I	c
arrived	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
to	i
late	c
!	c

So	c
I	c
ask	c
you	c
sincearly	i
for	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
becaus	i
it	c
was	c
n't	c
a	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

We	c
wanted	c
to	c
study	c
biology	c
here	c
in	c
Los	c
Angeles	c
with	c
some	c
other	c
friends	c
but	c
now	c
my	c
plans	c
have	c
changed	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
leave	c
them	c
.	c

One	c
day	c
,	c
Pat	c
and	c
I	c
were	c
going	c
home	c
,	c
when	c
she	c
asked	c
me	c
,	i
if	c
I	c
will	i
give	c
a	c
party	c
befor	i
I	i
'll	i
go	c

She	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
surprised	c
and	c
soon	c
I	i
've	i
forgotten	c
her	c
question	c

The	c
year	c
was	c
getting	i
to	c
the	i
end	c
.	c

But	c
when	c
we	c
get	i
into	c
the	c
hous	i
ther	i
were	c
all	c
my	c
friends	c
!	c

We	c
are	c
all	c
extremely	c
excited	c
especially	i
because	c
of	c
the	c
trip	c
to	c
Greenwich	c
,	c
the	c
town	c
we	c
were	i
always	i
interested	c
in	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
in	i
the	c
time	c
of	c
our	c
visit	c
there	c
is	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
"	c
The	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
"	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
a	c
coinsidence	i
which	c
we	c
would	c
be	c
extremely	c
happy	c
to	c
take	c
advantage	c
on	i
.	c

This	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
for	c
us	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
latest	c
fashions	c
and	c
famous	c
fashion	c
models	c
who	c
we	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
have	c
authograps	i
from	c
.	c

We	c
hope	c
changing	c
the	c
excursion	c
program	i
a	c
little	c
will	c
not	c
cause	c
any	c
problems	c
.	c

Because	c
the	c
fashion	c
show	c
lasts	c
a	c
whole	c
day	c
long	i
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	i

Nobody	c
likes	c
to	c
be	c
observed	c
constantly	c
or	c
touched	c
by	c
strangers	c
and	c
pointed	c
out	c
in	c
the	c
streets	c
with	c
no	c
right	c
even	c
or	i
just	c
a	c
little	c
privacy	c
.	c

I	c
personally	c
think	c
the	c
best	c
would	i
be	c
to	c
put	c
the	c
celebrities	c
in	c
cages	c
and	c
let	c
people	c
touch	c
them	c
,	c
point	c
and	c
ask	c
for	c
authopraps	i
.	c

The	c
biggest	c
commercial	c
gain	i
in	c
history	c
I	i
believe	c
,	c
but	c
celebrities	c
are	c
not	c
animals	c
although	c
they	c
may	c
be	c
sometimes	c
treated	c
the	c
same	c
way	c
.	c

It	c
may	c
in	i
many	c
cases	c
,	c
not	c
be	c
true	c
but	c
we	c
can	c
suspect	c
that	c
most	c
of	c
them	c
wanted	c
to	c
become	c
a	c
celebrity	c
and	c
they	c
had	c
to	c
know	c
there	i
is	i
no	i
private	i
life	i
unseparately	i
contected	i
to	i
it	i
.	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
I	c
believe	c
that	c
everyone	c
has	c
the	c
right	c
to	c
keep	i
privacy	i
of	c
their	c
own	c
homes	c
and	c
even	c
someone	c
extremely	c
famous	c
deserve	i
to	c
have	c
a	c
private	c
life	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writting	i
to	c
give	c
the	c
information	c
you	c
asked	c
me	c
and	i
also	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
required	i
some	c
information	c
about	c
the	c
prize	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
choose	c
for	i
accomodation	i
tents	i
instead	c
of	c
cabins	i
because	c
I	c
think	c
could	i
be	c
more	c
exciting	c
and	c
more	i
contact	c
with	c
the	c
enveiroment	i
.	c

Also	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
response	i
for	i
the	c
activities	c
I	c
had	i
to	c
choose	c
from	c
your	c
list	c
:	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
painting	c
and	c
photography	c
because	c
for	i
the	i
others	i
sports	i
I	i
am	i
not	i
healthy	i
at	c
the	c
moment	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
consider	i
I	c
used	c
to	c
do	c
painting	c
and	c
photography	c
very	c
good	i
at	c
the	i
school	c
.	c

Finally	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
if	c
I	c
need	c
a	i
special	c
clothes	c
and	c
Do	i
I	c
need	c
money	i
?	c

How	c
much	c
?	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
:	c
I	c
am	c
sorry	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
n't	c
written	c
you	i
soon	i
but	c
I	c
still	i
excited	c
for	i
the	c
experience	c
I	c
had	c
helping	c
Will	c
Smith	c
on	c
the	c
freeway	c
the	i
last	c
month	c
.	c

Anyway	c
now	i
I	c
am	c
going	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
everything	c
about	c
it	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
know	c
I	i
have	c
always	c
taken	c
the	c
freeway	c
on	c
Sundays	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
my	c
grandparents	c
'	c
house	c
,	c
but	c
that	c
Sunday	c
I	c
was	c
driving	c
when	c
suddenly	c
I	c
saw	c
in	c
the	c
lay-by	c
one	c
excellent	c
car	c
.	c

All	c
right	c
that	c
's	c
about	c
all	c
my	c
news	c
,	c
then	i
writte	i
soon	c
and	c
tell	c
me	c
about	c
you	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
that	c
it	c
is	c
only	c
possible	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
going	c
to	c
move	c
to	c
Spain	c
in	c
August	c
.	c

Everytime	i
I	c
travel	c
around	c
,	c
I	c
sleep	c
in	c
nice	c
rooms	c
with	c
nice	c
beds	c
;	c
that	c
is	c
why	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
good	c
option	i
to	c
sleep	c
in	c
sleep-bags	i
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
funny	i
to	c
play	c
basketball	c
after	c
five	i
years	c
;	c
and	c
since	c
I	c
go	c
out	c
to	c
the	c
mountains	c
once	c
a	c
month	c
,	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
think	c
I	c
would	c
have	c
any	c
problem	c
with	c
climbing	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
some	c
questions	c
:	c
Could	c
you	c
tell	c
me	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
would	c
be	c
addecuate	i
for	c
these	c
two	c
weeks	c
?	c

Thank	c
you	c
once	c

during	c
those	c
three	c
days	c
(	c
I	c
worked	c
with	c
10	c
other	c
young	c
people	c
)	c

checking	c
the	c
lights	c
and	c
microphones	c

That	c
was	c
fantactic	i

I	c
must	c
say	c
that	c
our	i
perfect	i
evening	i
was	i
n't	i
out	c
!	c

In	c
your	c
ad	i
was	i
said	i
that	c
in	c
main	i
roles	c
would	i
be	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
.	c

The	c
show	c
had	i
to	c
begin	c
at	c
19.30	c
,	c
but	c
indeed	i
it	c
started	c
at	c
20.15	c
and	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
wait	c
for	c
45	c
minutes	c
in	i
a	i
great	i
noise	i
.	c

Some	c
words	i
about	c
tickets	i
:	c
you	i
ad	i
noticed	i
that	c
discounts	c
were	c
available	c
so	c
we	c
did	c
n't	c
have	c
money	i
with	c
us	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
May	c
,	i
15	c
-	c
our	c
english	i
teacher	c
's	c
birthday	c
.	c

We	c
have	i
been	i
discussing	i
for	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
what	c
to	c
present	i
her	c
.	c

But	c
we	c
decided	c
to	c
buy	c
a	c
picture	c
,	c
because	c
she	c
has	i
always	i
told	i
us	c
about	c
art	c
galleries	c
with	c
a	i
great	c
exitement	i
.	c

That	c
's	c
why	c
he	c
disappointed	c
Marion	c
and	c
us	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
advertisement	c
you	c
said	c
"	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
"	c
is	c
the	c
actor	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
.	i

The	c
show	c
supposted	i
to	c
start	c
at	c
19.30	c
pm	c
but	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
20.15	c
pm.	c
It	c
was	c
very	c
late	c
.	c

We	c
had	c
to	c
wait	c
nearly	c
an	c
hour	c
.	c

Staff	c
did	c
not	c
tell	c
us	c
why	c
it	c
started	c
late	c
.	c

They	c
ignored	c
me	c
.	c

We	c
bought	c
tickets	c
without	c
discount	i
.	c

She	c
is	c
one	c
of	c
my	c
friend	i
at	c
school	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
have	c
any	c
problems	c
,	c
she	c
can	c
give	c
you	c
some	c
suggestion	i
.	c

This	c
is	c
her	c
bad	c
point	c
.	c

She	c
always	c
tells	c
someone	c
else	c
about	c
it	c
.	c

Last	c
week	c
,	c
Tim	c
told	c
Pat	c
about	c
his	c
serious	c
problem	c
.	c

He	c
wanted	c
Pat	c
to	c
keep	c
it	c
between	c
them	c
but	c
Pat	c
did	c
not	c
keep	c
his	i
promise	c
.	c

We	c
so	i
worry	i
about	c
her	c
in	i
the	i
future	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
dangerous	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
knew	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
it	c

You	c
had	i
never	c
made	c
on	i
your	i
own	i
decision	i
,	c
you	c
always	c
had	c
to	c
ask	c
your	c
family	c
's	c
opinion	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
seen	c
her	c
every	c
morning	c
while	i
I	c
was	c
going	c
to	c
school	c
.	c

Despite	c
of	i
going	i
to	c
school	c
by	c
bus	c
easier	i
than	c
riding	i
bycyle	i
I	i
had	c
prefered	i
to	i
going	c
to	c
school	c
by	c
bycyle	i
to	c
by	i
bus	c
.	c

The	c
more	c
seeing	i
her	i
I	i
could	i
,	c
the	c
more	c
ambitious	i
I	c
became	c
.	c

At	c
last	c
I	c
met	c
wit	i
her	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
went	c
to	i
her	i
play	i
to	i
see	i
,	c
I	c
realy	i
would	c
love	c
to	c
be	c
a	i
actress	c
.	c

She	c
was	c
the	c
only	c
person	c
who	c
encourage	i
me	c
to	c
be	c
a	i
actress	c
.	c

Otherwise	c
my	c
father	c
could	i
kill	i
me	c
and	c
not	c
let	c
me	c
to	i
go	i
to	c
school	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
never	c
ever	c
go	c
to	c
school	c
again	c
.	c

Now	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
theatre	c
actress	c

It	c
was	c
my	c
dream	c
I	i
wish	c

dady	i

I	c
am	c
shocked	c
that	c

I	c
hope	c
that	c
it	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
you	c
to	c
know	c
that	c
I	c
prefer	c
a	c
tent	c

Since	c
secondary	c
school	c
I	c
am	i
very	c
interested	c
in	c
taking	c
pictures	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
a	i
big	i
experience	c
in	i

Dear	c
Kim	c

It	c
was	c
really	c
very	c
nice	c
.	c

Here	c
it	c
comes	c
...	c

Our	c
job	c
was	c
to	c
prepare	c
the	c
scene	i
.	c

It	c
was	c
really	c
big	c
and	c
impressive	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
working	c
with	c
a	c
specialist	c
who	c
had	c
to	c
connect	c
all	c
lights	i
together	c
to	c
one	c
computer	c
and	c
prepare	c
a	c
colorful	i
show	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
hard	c
and	c
complicated	c
job	c
but	c
we	c
all	c
had	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
satisfaction	c
during	c
the	c
concert	c
.	c

Rafael	c

I	c
think	c
International	i
Arts	c
Festival	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
idea	c
.	c

I	c
prefere	i
them	c
to	c
others	c
.	c

Maybe	c
next	c
year	c
?	c

You	c
should	c
invite	c
artists	c
from	c
more	c
countries	c
.	c

I	c
like	c
listening	c
to	c
the	i
classical	c
music	c
in	c
the	c
big	c
halls	c
,	c
too	c
.	c

I	c
suggest	c
to	i
organize	i
next	i
IAF	c
in	c
the	c
summer	c
.	c

We	c
are	c
both	c
students	c
so	c
we	c
have	c
our	c
holiday	c
from	c
July	c
to	c
September	c
.	c

We	i
're	i
going	i
to	i
attend	c
IAF	i
any	c
time	c

as	c
well	c

Yours	c

Dear	c
Monte	c

There	c
are	c
many	c
things	c
we	c
are	c
n't	c
allowed	c
to	c
do	c
at	c
school	c
.	c

Our	c
lessons	c
start	c
at	c
8	c
a.m	i
and	c
we	c
are	c
n't	c
allowed	c
to	c
be	c
late	c
.	c

On	c
Sundays	c
we	c
have	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
bed	c
early	c
because	c
on	c
Monday	c
our	c
school	c
starts	c
at	c
8	c
in	c
the	c
morning	c
.	c

I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
change	c
it	i

Student	i
's	i
life	c
is	c
hard	c
but	c
sometimes	c
funny	c

Dear	c
:	i
Jane	c
Clark	c

I	c
had	i
been	i
your	i
annual	c
international	c
art	c
festival	c
.	c

Most	c
of	c
the	c
events	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
were	c
good	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
feel	c
that	c
the	c
festival	c
could	c
be	c
even	c
better	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
I	c
write	i
some	i
of	i
my	i
opionions	i
and	i
suggestions	i
to	i
you	i
.	c

I	c
hope	c
it	i
's	i
may	i
help	c
for	i
next	c
year	c
's	c
festival	c
.	c

The	c
idea	c
of	c
"	i
International	c
Art	c
Festival	c
"	c
was	c
great	c
.	c

Because	c
the	i
price	i
was	i
cheaper	i
than	i
buy	i
it	i
sperate	i
and	i
more	i
convience	i
.	c

Look	i
forward	c
for	i
next	c
year	c
's	c
festival	c
.	c

look	c
down	c
to	c
the	c
river.	c
"	c

Then	c
Sara	c
looked	c
down	i
the	c
river	c
.	c

After	c
a	c
few	c
second	i
,	c
Sara	c
felt	c
that	c
golden	i
fish	c
was	c
lovely	c
.	c

She	c
never	i
seen	i
any	c
fish	c
had	i
that	c
wonderful	c
colour	c
and	c
can	i
talk	c
with	c
her	c
.	c

They	c
were	c
very	c
close	c
friend	i
.	c

After	c
half	c
year	i
,	c
golden	i
fish	c
suddenly	c
disappear	i
.	c

She	c
sat	c
and	c
cry	i
on	i
the	c
river	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
stand	i
on	c
your	c
left	i
hand	i
side	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
a	c
great	c
time	c
there	c
because	c
taking	i
a	i
place	i
the	i
kind	i
of	i
festival	i
in	i
my	i
town	i
is	c
very	c
unusual	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
there	c
was	i
a	c
few	c
stars	c
and	c
artists	c
from	c
only	c
six	c
countries	c
although	c
the	c
advertisement	c
mention	i
that	c
stars	c
and	c
artists	c
would	c
come	c
from	c
around	c
the	c
world	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
some	c
concerts	c
took	c
a	i
place	c
in	c
really	c
small	c
halls	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
food	i
shops	i
should	c
be	c
added	c
in	i
this	c
festival	c
in	i
next	c
year	c
because	c
only	i
plays	i
and	i
films	i
were	i
not	i
atrractive	i
enought	i
to	i
get	i
audiences	i
.	c

How	c
are	c
you	c
doing	c
?	c

At	c
home	c
I	c
'm	c
not	c
allowed	c
to	c
talk	c
on	c
the	c
phone	c
more	c
than	c
ten	c
minutes	c
,	c
which	c
annoys	c
me	c
very	c
much	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
we	c
're	c
allowed	c
to	c
drive	c
a	c
car	c
to	c
school	c
,	c
which	c
is	c
quite	c
unusual	i
rule	c
in	c
Japanese	i
school	c
because	c
students	c
might	c
crash	c
a	c
car	c
on	c
the	c
way	c
to	c
school	c
or	c
home	c
.	c

I	c
actually	c
love	c
this	c
rule	c
because	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
to	c
get	c
up	c
early	c
if	c
I	c
have	c
a	c
car	c
.	c

I	c
want	c
to	c
at	c
least	c
put	c
lip	i
coluor	i
on	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
in	c
response	c
to	c
the	c
letter	c
,	c
which	c
I	c
had	i
yesterday	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
you	c
asked	c
about	c
when	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
.	c

Because	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
work	c
all	c
year	c
except	c
one	c
month	i
holiday	c
on	i
July	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
try	c
both	c
of	c
them	c
.	c

Lastly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
be	c
grateful	c
if	c
I	c
could	c
have	c
following	i
informations	i
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
time	i
and	c
attention	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c

It	c
was	c
thought	c
that	c
a	c
normal	c
,	c
regular	c
lesson	c
,	c
3	c
optional	c
lessons	c
and	c
a	c
great	c
deal	c
of	c
activities	c
should	c
be	c
filmed	c
.	c

Refering	i
to	c
optional	c
lessons	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
recommended	c
that	c
Speaking	c
and	c
listening	c
,	c
Computer	c
and	c
Business	c
English	c
are	c
suitable	c
for	c
filming	c
.	c

There	c
seems	c
to	c
be	c
a	c
general	c
opinion	c
that	c
sports	c
,	c
art	c
and	c
music	c
activities	c
such	c
as	c
tennis	c
,	c
football	c
,	c
orchestra	c
,	c
painting	c
,	c
photography	i
should	c
be	c
included	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
students	c
can	c
learn	c
English	c
from	c
wide	c
activities	c
as	c
well	c
as	c
lessons	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
give	c
my	c
opinions	c
about	c
the	c
annual	c
International	c
Arts	c
Festival	c
I	c
have	c
visited	i
.	c

It	c
gives	c
an	c
opportunity	c
to	c
get	c
acquainted	c
with	c
the	c
cultures	i
'	i
variety	c
of	c
the	c
whole	c
world	c
.	c

Despite	c
that	c
,	c
all	c
the	c
jazz	c
,	c
rock	c
and	c
classical	c
concerts	c
were	c
extremely	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

Another	c
disadvatage	i
of	c
the	c
festival	c
's	c
programme	c
was	c
lack	i
of	c
plays	c
and	c
films	c
which	c
are	c
the	c
best	c
to	i
display	c
the	i
modern	c
county	i
's	i
culture	c
.	i

All	c
the	c
guests	c
were	c
offered	c
a	c
weekend	c
ticket	c
for	c
all	c
events	c
.	c

In	c
conclusuon	i
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
in	c
spite	c
of	c
the	c
success	c
of	c
the	c
festival	c
some	c
improvements	c
still	c
can	c
be	c
done	i
.	c

Especially	c
young	c
people	c
who	c
are	c
always	c
out	i
of	i
their	c
small	c
budget	c
.	c

Fortunatelly	i
,	c
there	c
are	c
many	c
ways	c
to	c
earn	c
some	c
money	c
nowadays	c
.	c

Of	c
course	c
,	c
young	c
people	c
can	c
work	c
only	c
in	c
their	c
spare	c
time	c
.	c

It	c
mean	i
that	c
a	c
job	c
should	c
be	c
part-time	c
.	c

But	c
you	c
can	c
earn	c
more	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
you	c
can	c
help	c
them	c
and	c
earn	c
quiete	i
enough	i
.	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
there	c
is	c
no	c
problem	c
without	c
a	c
solution	c
and	c
if	c
you	c
are	c
an	c
active	c
and	c
broad-minded	c
person	c
,	c
you	c
will	c
surely	c
find	c
a	c
way	c
to	c
earn	c
money	c
even	c
in	c
Arctic	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
happy	c
to	c
have	c
won	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
interested	c
in	c
going	i
to	i
two	c
weeks	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
in	c
the	c
USA	c
.	c

I	c
like	c
to	c
do	c
sports	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
do	c
sailing	c
and	c
surfing	c
for	c
speed	i
sensations	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
good	c
in	i
those	c
two	c
activities	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
sea	c
every	c
weekend	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
men	c
prefer	c
to	c
do	c
sports	c
,	c
because	c
the	i
shopping	c
loses	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
time	c
controry	i
to	i
women	i
,	c
because	c
if	c
they	c
have	c
a	i
free	c
time	c
,	c
they	c
will	c
go	c
to	i
do	i
shopping	c
.	c

He	i
goes	i
to	i
do	i
shopping	c
only	c
if	c
he	i
has	i
not	i
clothes	i
.	c

To	c
conclude	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
"	c
Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
"	c
is	c
a	c
true	c
statement	c
,	c
but	c
not	c
always	c
for	c
all	c
people	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
this	c
festival	c
is	c
really	c
good	c
and	c
I	c
hope	c
it	c
will	c
have	i
every	c
year	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
disappointed	c
by	c
the	c
number	c
of	c
that	i
.	c

It	c
will	i
be	c
great	c
if	c
there	c
were	c
would	i
have	i
more	c
choice	c
the	i
next	c
year	c
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
an	c
unforgetable	i
time	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
eat	c
some	c
different	c
kind	c
of	c
foods	i
,	c
if	c
it	i
is	c
possible	c
.	c

So	i
,	c
we	c
are	c
n't	c
allowed	c
to	c
smoke	c
inside	c
-	c
and	i
eat	c
in	c
the	c
classroom	c
.	c

Of	c
course	c
,	c
we	c
must	c
respect	c
the	c
teacher	c
and	c
do	c
what	c
he	c
says	c
.	c

I	c
ca	c
n't	c
remember	c
,	c
because	c
now	c
I	c
'm	c
19	c
,	c
then	i
I	c
can	c
do	c
what	c
I	c
want	c
.	c

I	c
know	c
that	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
ask	c
at	i
my	c
Mum	c
or	c
Dad	c
for	i
going	c
by	i
my	c
friend	c
after	c
the	i
lessons	i
.	c

They	c
wanted	c
that	i
I	i
did	i
my	c
homework	c
before	c
to	i
play	c
.	c

I	c
want	i
to	i
change	i
nothing	i
,	i
I	c
was	c
happy	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
on	c
week	i
's	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
and	c
I	c
went	c
there	i
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
to	c
see	c
"	c
Over	c
The	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
.	c

This	c
is	c
fourty-five	i
minutes	i
delay	c
.	c

Moreover	c
there	i
was	i
not	c
any	c
discounts	c
and	c
all	c
of	c
the	c
tickets	c
had	i
the	c
same	c
prizes	i
.	c

Out	i
the	c
end	c
your	i
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
from	i
unknown	c
reasons	c
,	c
but	c
on	i
an	i
advertisement	c
was	i
clearly	c
sign	i
:	c

I	c
will	c
be	c
very	c
pleased	c
if	c
so	i
.	c

Yours	c
faithfuly	i

Twentieth	i
century	c
was	c
a	c
century	c
of	c
inventions	c
.	c

Technology	c
maked	i
our	c
life	c
different	c
than	c
life	i
of	c
people	c
for	i
example	c
living	i
in	c
nineteenth	i
century	c
.	c

Often	c
people	c
do	c
not	c
see	c
how	c
it	c
effects	i
our	c
life	i
style	i
.	c

We	c
know	c
our	c
world	c
from	c
TV	c
screens	c
and	c
computer	c
monitors	c
.	c

On	i
the	i
end	i
we	i
must	c
mention	c
modern	c
medicine	c
.	c

I	c
think	i
that	i
I	i
could	i
not	i
live	c
normal	i
life	c
without	c
these	c
inventions	c
.	c

They	c
are	c
like	c
air	i
I	c
breath	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	i
some	c
informations	i
about	c
the	c
advertisement	c
of	i
the	c
show	c
.	c

I	c
waited	c
quite	i
one	c
hour	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
and	c
what	c
happened	c
with	c
the	c
actor	c
?	c

There	c
is	c
more	c
!	c

As	c
we	c
see	c
the	i
clothes	i
are	c
changing	c
every	c
hour	c

Dear	c
misses	i
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

So	c
I	c
would	i
travel	c
on	i
July	c
because	c
I	c
've	c
got	i
only	i
there	i
free	i
time	i
.	c

And	c
so	c
I	c
can	c
I	i
be	c
better	i
in	i
touch	i
with	i
the	i
nature	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
happy	c
to	c
read	c
that	c
I	c
will	c
have	c
the	c
chance	c
to	c
do	c
two	c
activities	c
there	c
.	c

I	c
take	c
very	c
good	c
photos	c
!	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
hearing	i
news	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

What	c
are	i
we	i
doing	i
then	c
?	c

They	c
go	c
out	c
with	c
friends	c
or	c
alone	c
.	c

But	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

In	i
the	i
time	i
we	c
want	i
to	c
go	c
out	c
of	c
a	c
shop	c
a	c
man	c
stopped	c
us	c
and	c
hold	i
a	c
pistol	c
in	c
his	c
hand	c
.	c

We	c
were	i
lucky	c
that	c
we	c
are	c
in	i
life	i
now	c
.	c

But	c
you	c
can	c
be	c
carefull	i
when	c
you	c
speak	c
with	c
him	i
or	c
her	i
that	i
will	i
stolen	i
your	c
thinks	i
.	c

Dear	c
Ms.	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
'll	c
have	c
to	c
pass	i
several	c
exams	c
in	c
June	c
,	i
in	i
August	c
my	c
family	c
going	i
to	c
visit	c
our	c
relatives	c
in	c
Austria	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
not	c
so	c
keen	c
about	c
accomotation	i
but	c
would	c
rather	c
stay	c
in	c
tents	c
than	c
cabins	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
much	c
more	c
fun	c
and	c
you	c
can	c
really	c
enjoy	c
nature	c
and	c
a	i
company	c
of	c
your	c
friends	c
.	c

I	c
am	i
really	i
enjoying	i
swimming	c
.	c

Far	i
the	c
best	c
swimmer	c
in	c
my	c
school	c
.	c

The	c
other	c
subject	c
is	c
photography	c
.	c

I	c
like	c
taking	c
pictures	c
and	c
want	c
to	c
share	c
my	c
interest	c
with	c
the	i
others	c
.	c

What	c
will	c
be	c
better	i
to	c
take	c
with	c
me	c
,	c
what	c
I	i
'll	i
need	c
at	c
Camp	c
?	c

Hope	c
to	c
hear	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

She	c
will	i
prefer	i
shopping	c
to	c
everything	c
else	c
.	c

Somitimes	i
I	c
feel	c
very	c
sorry	c
for	c
her	c
.	c

Not	c
so	c
many	c
people	c
thinking	i
about	c
going	c
fishing	c
or	c
playing	c
sport	i
games	c
with	c
their	c
families	c
any	c
more	c
.	c

People	c
are	c
normally	c
angry	c
after	c
shopping	c
-	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
so	c
easy	c
to	c
get	c
tied	i
.	c

People	c
are	i
not	i
smiling	i
to	i
each	c
other	c
,	c
not	i
talking	i
to	c
each	c
other	c
at	c
the	c
shops	c
.	c

Try	c
to	c
give	c
up	c
shopping	c
one	c
day	c
and	c
try	c
to	c
spend	c
your	c
day	c
with	c
friends	c
going	i
to	c
play	i
something	c
together	c
.	c

It	c
feels	c
much	c
more	i
better	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
so	c
happy	c
to	c
received	i
your	c
letter	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
tell	i
you	c
the	c
information	c
you	c
need	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
the	c
travel	i
start	i
only	i
july	i
if	c
possible	c
,	i
because	i
this	c
is	c
my	c
Hoilday	i
start	i
,	i
at	c
the	c
Camp	c
California	c
I	i
would	c
like	c
my	c
accommodation	i
in	c
tents	i
,	c
because	c
I	c
work	c
in	c
Army	i
and	c
in	i
the	c
camp	c
I	c
usually	c
stay	c
in	c
tent	i
at	c
night	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
will	c
feel	c
more	c
comfortable	c
.	c

And	c
I	c
have	c
a	c
question	c
to	c
ask	c
?	c

Yours	c
Sincerely	c

To	c
make	c
a	c
daily	i
life	i
video	c
in	c
school	c
,	c
we	c
should	c
concentrat	i
on	c
the	c
most	i
things	i
we	i
do	i
in	c
a	c
school	c
,	i
the	i
most	i
thing	i
we	i
do	i
in	c
a	c
school	c
is	c
haveing	i
lesson	i
,	i
it	i
is	i
a	c
very	c
useful	c
parts	i
of	c
this	c
video	c
and	c
is	i
the	c
main	c
subject	c
.	c

The	c
lessons	c
we	c
take	i
in	c
the	c
video	c
,	i
should	c
be	c
the	c
main	c
subject	c
we	c
study	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
video	c
I	c
think	c
we	c
should	c
take	c
part	i
to	c
talk	c
about	c
,	i
what	c
we	c
doing	i
in	c
feel	i
time	c
and	c
study	c
period	i
.	c

This	c
is	c
another	c
important	c
part	c
of	c
our	c
school	c
life	c
,	c
and	c
we	c
should	c
make	i
a	c
section	c
to	i
talk	i
about	c
lunch	c
and	c
where	i
are	i
the	i
people	i
go	i
to	i
eat	i
their	i
lunch	i
or	i
what	i
they	i
do	i
?	i

I	c
enjoyed	c
it	c
so	c
much	c
.	c

But	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
three	c
things	c
which	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
.	c

I	c
supposed	i
to	c
see	c
quite	i
various	i
nationality	i
.	c

However	c
,	c
some	c
concert	c
halls	c
were	c
too	c
small	c
for	c
the	c
many	i
people	c
so	c
we	c
could	c
n't	c
have	c
a	c
enough	c
space	c
.	c

thirdly	i
.	i

And	c
if	c
there	c
was	c
musical	c
event	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
the	c
next	c
one	c
will	c
be	c
better	c
.	c

And	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
about	i
making	i
this	c
festival	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
next	i
festival	c
very	c
much	c

Dear	c
Lula	c

Hello	c
.	c

How	c
are	c
you	c
doing	c
?	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
're	c
well	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
quite	c
interesting	c
.	c

We	c
have	c
quite	c
strict	c
rules	c
.	c

Only	i
It	i
was	i
like	i
a	i
formal	i
clothes	i
.	i

But	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
it	i
.	c

I	c
'm	c
pursuading	i
my	c
mum	c
,	c
perhaps	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
glad	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
more	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
getting	c
your	c
letter	c
soon	c
.	c

Take	c
care	c
of	c
yourself	c
.	c

I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
try	c
golf	c
because	c
I	c
'm	c
not	c
good	c
at	c
any	c
other	c
sports	c
.	c

I	c
know	c
you	c
have	c
been	c
waiting	c
for	c
my	c
letter	c
.	c

But	c
as	c
you	c
know	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
so	c
busy	c
that	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
write	c
earlier	c
.	c

We	c
delivered	c
so	c
many	c
fantastic	c
and	c
gorgeous	c
costumes	c
which	c
had	c
been	c
designed	c
exclusively	c
by	c
top	c
designers	c
.	c

But	c
the	c
rest	c
of	c
the	c
preparation	c
was	c
so	c
good	c
.	c

I	c
've	c
realised	c
pop	c
stars	c
are	c
just	c
like	c
us	c
,	c
down	c
to	c
earth	c
.	c

Do	c
you	c
know	c
what	c
I	c
liked	c
most	c
from	i
this	c
experience	c
?	c

Of	c
course	c
,	c
I	c
've	c
enjoyed	c
being	c
around	c
famous	c
singers	c
,	c
too	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
really	i
a	i
good	c
idea	c
to	c
organize	c
a	c
festival	c
containing	c
such	c
different	c
shows	c
.	c

I	c
went	c
to	c
see	c
a	c
classical	c
concert	c
and	c
,	c
although	c
the	c
music	c
played	c
was	c
excellent	c
,	c
he	i
concert	c
hall	c
was	c
too	c
small	c
.	c

He	c
told	c
me	c
how	c
great	c
it	i
was	i
and	c
I	c
was	c
thinking	c
that	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
a	i
good	c
to	c
have	c
more	c
plays	c
and	c
films	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

Two	c
sisters	c
,	c
Alex	c
and	c
Daniela	c
were	i
sitting	c
in	c
front	c
of	c
the	c
fireplace	c
thinking	c
of	i
what	c
they	c
could	c
do	c
.	c

Offering	i
Christmas	c
presents	c
was	c
a	c
tradition	c
not	c
be	i
forgotten	c
and	c
only	i
four	c
days	c
left	c
.	c

Alex	c
suggested	c
that	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
good	c
idea	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
city	c
to	c
buy	c
that	c
present	c
.	c

Anyway	c
,	c
Alex	c
was	c
too	c
stubborn	c
to	c
give	c
up	c
and	c
it	c
was	c
like	c
talking	c
to	c
a	c
brick	c
wall	c
:	c
she	c
did	c
n't	c
listen	c
to	c
her	c
sister	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
such	c
a	c
pain	c
to	c
walk	c
in	c
the	c
snow	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
Alex	c
was	c
not	c
worried	c
at	c
all	c
despite	c
the	c
fact	c
that	c
her	c
sister	c
was	c
tired	c
and	c
cold	c
.	c

She	c
was	c
so	c
cold	c
that	c
she	c
could	c
n't	c
move	c
her	c
legs	c
.	c

Dear	c
,	i
Helen	c
Ryan	c

For	i
the	c
time	c
that	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
must	i
be	c
on	i
July	c
only	c
.	c

This	c
is	c
because	c
my	c
A-levels	i
exams	c
is	i
coming	c
up	c
so	c
I	c
really	c
need	c
times	i
to	c
revise	c
,	c
and	c
July	c
is	c
the	c
only	c
month	i
and	i
time	i
that	c
I	c
am	c
free	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
never	c
ever	c
stayed	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
before	c
but	c
some	c
of	c
the	c
people	c
I	c
know	c
said	c
that	c
it	c
is	c
fun	c
and	c
much	c
more	c
exiting	i
.	c

As	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
person	c
who	c
is	i
love	i
and	i
doing	c
activities	c
,	c
so	i
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
choose	c
to	c
do	c
sailing	c
and	c
photography	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
about	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
do	i
I	c
need	c
to	c
bring	c
?	i
and	i
the	i
money	c
,	c
do	c
I	c
need	c
much	c
of	c
them	i
?	c

How	c
are	c
you	c
?	c

I	c
could	c
n't	c
believed	i
how	c
close	c
I	c
was	c
to	c
the	c
band	c
.	c

Later	c
on	c
the	c
band	c
took	c
a	c
break	c
for	c
ten	c
or	c
fifteen	c
minutes	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
served	c
them	c
with	c
glasses	c
of	c
fizzy	c
drink	c
and	c
chocolate	c
bars	c
,	c
biscuits	c
and	c
sandwiches	c
.	c

People	c
at	i
the	i
backstage	c
including	i
me	c
were	i
helping	c
to	c
clean	c
up	c
all	c
the	c
stuff	c
and	c
ready	i
for	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
the	c
concert	c
.	c

The	i
time	i
has	i
come	i
,	i
when	i
the	c
band	c
finished	c
the	c
concert	c
,	c
we	c
have	i
to	c
served	i
them	c
drinks	c
again	c
and	c
helped	i
to	c
clear	i
up	i
the	c
stage	c
.	c

Afterwards	c
,	c
I	c
have	i
a	c
chance	c
to	c
took	i
photos	i
with	c
them	c
and	c
have	i
their	c
autographs	c
etc	c
.	c

From	i
this	c
letter	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
sure	c
that	c
you	c
should	i
be	c
able	c
to	c
share	c
this	c
experience	c
with	c
me	c
.	c

Lots	c
of	c
Love	c

My	c
name	c
is	c
Anne	c
Singler	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
already	i
watched	c
the	c
musical	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
"	c
in	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
quite	c
bored	c
,	c
sitting	c
in	c
my	c
chair	c
and	c
waiting	c
for	c
the	c
beginning	c
of	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

My	c
husband	c
was	c
also	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
seeing	c
Mr.	c
Brook	c
as	c
an	c
actor	c
of	i
your	c
musical	c
because	c
he	c
is	c
one	c
of	c
his	c
greatest	c
fans	c
.	c

The	c
actor	c
which	i
acted	c
instead	c
of	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
was	c
n't	c
as	c
good	c
as	c
Mr.	c
Brook	c
.	c

After	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
which	c
was	c
n't	c
really	c
the	c
best	c
I	c
have	c
ever	c
seen	c
,	c
my	c
family	c
and	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
get	c
some	c
snacks	c
in	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
.	c

When	c
we	c
arrived	c
at	c
the	c
restaurant	c
we	c
had	i
to	i
realize	i
that	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
the	c
cook	c
was	c
ill	c
.	c

Yours	c
,	c

The	c
secret	c

One	c
day	c
her	c
best	c
friend	c
Sally	c
told	c
her	c
that	c
she	c
had	c
betrayed	c
her	c
boyfriend	c
.	c

Pat	c
really	c
liked	c
chatting	c
about	c
others	c
and	c
so	c
she	c
was	c
n't	c
able	c
to	c
keep	c
quiet	c
about	c
Sally	c
's	c
secret	c
.	c

After	c
that	c
Paul	c
got	i
white	c
in	c
his	i
face	c
,	c
he	c
was	c
pale	c
like	c
a	c
wall	c
and	c
it	c
seemed	c
as	i
he	c
would	i
be	i
very	c
nervous	c
.	c

Now	c
Pat	c
realized	c
what	c
was	c
going	c
on	c
and	c
could	c
undstand	i
why	c
her	c
boyfriend	c
got	c
so	c
nervous	c
about	c
the	c
secret	c
.	c

In	c
this	c
moment	c
Pat	c
wished	c
that	c
she	c
never	i
would	i
have	i
been	c
keen	c
on	c
knowing	c
secrets	c
!	c

Dear	c
Mr.	c
Clark	c
,	c

I	c
also	c
read	c
an	c
advertisement	c
in	c
"	c
The	c
Times	c
"	c
.	c

I	c
thought	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
interesting	c
and	c
exciting	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
impressed	c
of	i
the	c
idea	c
of	c
the	c
festival	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
enjoy	c
different	c
culture	i
and	c
also	c
I	c
could	c
expand	c
my	c
knowledge	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
the	c
weekend	c
ticket	c
was	c
fantastic	c
because	c
I	c
spent	c
two	c
days	c
the	i
festival	c
-	c
Saturday	c
and	c
Sunday	c
.	c

But	c
there	c
were	c
only	c
six	c
countries	c
'	c
candidates	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
exaggerated	c
.	c

Besides	c
,	c
some	c
concert	c
halls	c
were	c
too	c
small	c
.	c

Jazz	c
and	c
classical	c
concerts	i
'	i
halls	c
were	c
especially	c
small	c
.	c

Except	c
these	i
two	c
things	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
quite	c
good	c
.	c

Plays	c
and	c
films	c
qualities	i
were	c
good	c
,	c
but	i
quantities	i
were	i
bad	i
.	c

In	c
addition	c
,	c
most	c
of	c
the	c
people	c
in	c
the	c
festival	c
liked	c
that	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
run	c
more	c
plays	c
and	c
films	c
in	c
next	c
year	c
's	c
festival	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
your	c
answer	c
.	c

I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
about	c
my	c
experiences	c
.	c

Before	c
that	c
you	i
have	c
to	c
think	c
why	i
you	c
need	c
to	c
earn	c
money	c
and	c
how	c
you	c
do	c
that	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
did	c
newspaper	c
delivery	c
.	c

I	c
earned	c
easily	c
and	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
control	c
myself	c
at	c
that	c
time	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
made	c
brochure	i
for	c
a	c
company	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
in	c
high	c
school	c
.	c

Despite	c
the	c
fact	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
part-time	i
job	c
,	c
I	c
worked	c
very	c
hard	c
because	c
I	c
liked	c
computer	c
works	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
with	c
reference	c
to	c
the	c
International	c
Arts	c
Festival	c
I	i
have	c
recently	c
been	c
to	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
my	c
opinions	c
about	c
it	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
to	c
this	c
some	i
concert	c
halls	c
were	c
too	c
small	c
to	c
host	c
all	c
the	c
people	c
who	c
were	c
there	c
fro	i
the	c
occasion	c
and	c
,	c
personally	c
speaking	c
the	i
show	c
could	c
be	c
done	c
at	i
the	c
open	c
air	c
next	c
year	c
,	c
so	c
that	c
music	i
would	c
also	c
create	c
a	c
fantastic	c
atmosphere	c
all	c
around	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
the	c
weekend	c
ticket	c
was	c
reasonably-priced	c
and	c
this	c
was	c
excellent	i
decision	c
because	c
it	c
gave	c
the	c
opportunity	c
to	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
people	c
,	c
adults	c
but	c
also	c
students	c
,	c
to	c
take	c
part	c
to	i
the	c
Festival	c
.	c

I	c
help	c
doing	c
cleaning	i
or	c
the	c
washing	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
do	c
it	c
because	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
,	c
not	c
because	c
my	c
parents	c
make	c
me	c
do	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
can	c
go	c
out	c
and	c
stay	c
out	c
late	c
,	c
I	c
've	c
got	c
my	c
car	c
and	c
my	c
mobile	c
,	c
so	c
that	c
they	c
can	c
call	c
me	c
whenever	c
they	c
need	c
to	c
hear	i
me	c
;	c
but	c
above	c
all	c
I	c
know	c
they	c
trust	c
me	c
and	c
consider	c
my	i
an	c
adult	c
.	c

Therefor	i
I	c
would	c
n't	c
change	c
anything	c
in	c
my	c
home	c
life	c
and	i
neither	i
in	c
my	c
school	c
life	c
.	c

Best	c
wishes	c
.	i

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
got	c
summer	i
holidays	c
from	c
July	c
to	c
August	c
and	c
I	c
work	c
as	c
a	c
bank	c
clerk	c
in	c
August	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
a	c
tent	c
would	c
suit	c
my	c
personal	c
life-style	i
better	c
than	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
because	c
I	c
love	c
the	i
nature	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
play	c
basketball	c
during	c
my	c
holidays	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
because	c
I	c
love	c
this	c
game	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
been	c
playing	c
basketball	c
for	c
8	c
years	c
and	c
today	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
member	c
of	c
an	c
Austrian	c
basketball-team	i
.	c

I	c
also	i
would	i
like	c
to	c
know	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
will	c
get	c
from	c
you	c
for	c
those	i
two	c
weeks	c
because	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
spend	c
some	c
money	c
for	i
clothes	c
.	c

Dear	c
Kim	c

Last	c
month	c
I	c
enjoyed	c
helping	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
you	c
want	c
to	c
hear	c
some	c
funny	c
stories	c
about	c
the	c
experience	i
I	c
made	i
.	c

At	c
first	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
clean	c
the	c
three	c
private	c
rooms	c
of	c
the	c
stars	c
.	c

This	c
was	c
very	c
boring	c
but	c
after	c
I	c
left	c
the	c
third	c
room	c
I	c
met	c
Brunner	c
and	c
Brunner	c
.	c

These	c
two	c
people	c
are	c
stars	c
in	c
our	c
country	c
...	c

O.K.	c
I	c
am	c
just	c
kiding	i
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
like	c
the	i
songs	i
of	i
Brunner	i
and	i
Brunner	i
because	c
this	c
kind	c
of	c
music	c
is	c
very	c
boring	c
.	c

I	c
also	c
had	c
to	c
clean	c
the	c
washing	i
rooms	i
.	c

I	c
think	c
you	c
know	c
his	c
popular	c
songs	c
like	c
"	c
My	c
Name	c
Is	c
"	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
to	c
bring	i
him	c
something	c
to	c
eat	c
.	c

You	c
should	c
try	c
to	c
called	i
some	c
experience	c
during	i
such	c
a	c
concert	i
you	i
would	c
not	c
regret	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
a	c
nineteen	i
year	i
old	i
gild	i
who	c
is	c
still	c
attending	c
classes	c
at	c
Saint	c
John	c
's	c
School	c
.	c

I	c
believe	c
it	c
is	c
better	c
than	c
a	c
tent	c
because	c
this	i
one	i
would	i
not	i
shelter	i
enough	i

I	c
consider	c
myself	c
to	c
be	c
good	c
at	c
this	c
sport	c
.	c

As	c
regarding	i
painting	c
,	c
I	c
know	c
a	c
lot	c
since	i
my	c
grandmother	c
taugh	i
me	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
five	c
years	c

It	c
would	c
be	c
very	c
kind	c
of	c
you	c
to	c
let	c
me	c
know	c
about	c
the	c
clothes	c
you	c
think	c
it	c
would	i
be	c
necessary	c
for	c
me	c
to	c

how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
will	c

Dear	c
kim	c
,	c

Well	c
,	c
my	c
dream	c
come	i
true	c
.	c

I	c
will	c
never	c
forget	c
that	c
wonderful	c
experience	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
so	c
exciting	c
to	c
see	c
the	i
Mano	i
'	i
group	i
singer	c
that	c
I	c
felt	c
as	c
if	c
I	c
were	c
in	c
heaven	c
!	c
!	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
inform	c
that	i
I	c
prefer	c
travelling	c
in	c
July	c
to	c
travelling	c
in	c
another	i
month	c
.	c

Next	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
stay	i
in	c
tents	i
rather	c
than	c
stay	c
in	c
log	i
cabins	i
because	c
I	c
appreciate	c
having	c
straight	i
contact	c
with	c
nature	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
an	i
answer	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
just	c
writing	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
about	c
my	c
experience	c
about	i
helping	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
.	c

Wonderful	c
,	c
Breathtaking	c
,	c
Fabulous	c
,	c
these	c
are	c
some	c
adjectives	c
to	c
describe	c
just	c
a	c
little	c
bit	c
how	c
my	c
experience	c
was	c
.	c

Starting	c
with	c
good	c
points	c
,	c
I	c
could	c
say	c
that	c
you	c
can	i
talk	c
face	i
to	i
face	i
with	c
the	c
pop	c
stars	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
you	c
have	i
the	c
unique	c
opportunity	c
to	c
take	i
pictures	i
with	i
them	c
,	c
to	c
have	c
their	c
names	c
written	c
,	i
on	c
your	c
notebook	c
by	c
themselves	i
.	c

Despite	c
of	i
being	c
tiring	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
rewarding	c
because	c
I	c
noticed	c
that	c
all	c
the	c
singers	c
are	c
ordinary	c
people	c
who	c
want	c
to	c
see	c
their	c
fans	c
happy	c
and	c
satisfied	c
and	c
that	i
is	c
true	c
I	c
experienced	c
that	c
.	c

Kim	c
,	c
summing	c
up	c
it	i
was	c
the	c
most	c
interesting	c
experience	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
ever	c
had	c
.	c

Lots	c
of	c
Love	c

Adriana	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
about	c
my	c
preference	c
.	c

To	c
start	c
with	c
I	i
would	c
rather	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
because	c
two	c
weeks	c
might	c
be	c
too	c
long	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
and	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
would	c
be	c
more	c
convenient	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

When	c
it	c
comes	c
to	c
activities	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
try	c
climbing	c
and	c
surfing	c
.	c

I	c
started	c
surfing	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
12	c
.	c

However	c
some	i
people	c
might	c
be	c
opposed	c
to	c
this	c
general	c
understanding	c
because	c
they	c
believe	c
that	c
they	c
can	c
find	c
shopping	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

And	c
shopping	c
is	c
also	c
a	c
difficult	c
hobby	c
to	c
go	c
along	c
with	c
your	c
friends	c
or	c
your	c
pertners	i
.	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
you	i
because	c
I	c
had	i
been	i
asked	i
to	c
make	c
a	c
little	c
suggestion	c
about	c
the	c
programme	c
your	i
have	c
organised	c
to	i
our	c
English	c
class	c
travel	i
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
we	c
have	c
seen	c
an	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
show	i
and	c
we	c
would	c
all	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

We	c
think	c
we	c
could	c
change	i
shooping	i
for	i
going	i
to	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

The	c
media	i
's	i
are	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
create	i
great	c
expectations	c
about	c
famous	c
people	c
.	c

They	c
are	c
not	c
trying	c
to	c
give	c
information	c
,	c
they	c
are	c
only	c
looking	c
to	c
get	c
money	c
,	c
and	c
to	c
entertain	c
the	c
public	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
you	c
this	c
letter	c
to	c
complain	i
about	c
you	i
have	c
organized	c
us	i
for	c
our	c
trip	c
to	c
London	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
activity	c
programme	c
.	c

All	c
the	c
clan	i
would	c
enjoy	c
going	c
the	i
show	c
,	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
oportunity	i
to	c
see	c
an	c
exhibition	c
as	i
the	c
latest	c
fashions	c
.	c

But	c
we	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
suggest	c
you	c
to	i
move	i
our	c
visit	c
to	c
the	c
Science	c
Museum	c
to	c
Wednesday	c
afternoon	c
,	i
so	c
that	c
,	i
we	c
can	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
show	i
on	i
Tuesday	i
,	i
which	i
lasts	i
from	i
10	i
am	i
to	i
7	i
pm	i
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
considering	c
our	c
petition	i

Dear	c
Ms	c
clark	i
:	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
give	c
suggestion	i
for	i
the	c
international	c
art	c
festival	c
,	c
which	c
I	c
have	i
been	i
to	c
one	c
weeks	i
before	i
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
say	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
idea	c
to	c
have	c
this	c
international	c
arts	c
festival	c
,	i
it	i
is	c
very	c
interesting	c
,	c
especially	c
for	c
the	i
young	c
people	c
.	c

Although	c
the	c
jazz	c
,	c
rock	c
and	c
classical	c
music	c
was	c
great	c
,	c
some	c
concerts	i
and	c
halls	c
are	i
too	c
small	c
,	i
could	i
you	c
consider	c
making	c
them	c
bigger	c
next	c
year	c
.	i

Dear	c
Jacob	c
:	c

I	c
'm	c
very	c
glad	c
to	c
hear	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

We	c
should	c
keep	c
in	c
touch	c
with	c
each	c
other	c
,	c
because	c
you	c
know	c
I	c
'm	c
very	c
happy	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
friend	c
like	c
you	c
.	c

In	c
your	c
last	c
letter	c
you	c
asked	c
me	c
something	c
about	c
our	c
rules	c
,	c
both	c
at	c
home	c
and	c
at	c
school	c
in	c
my	c
country	c
.	c

I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
that	c
.	c

In	c
school	c
,	c
we	c
have	c
lots	c
of	c
rules	c
,	c
especially	c
in	c
the	i
class	c
and	c
some	c
of	c
them	c
are	c
quite	c
strange	c
.	c

And	c
we	c
ca	c
n't	c
eat	c
food	c
or	c
do	c
any	c
sports	c
in	c
our	c
classroom	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
too	c
strickt	i
,	i
I	c
do	c
n't	c
like	c
it	c
.	c

yours	c
:	c

Dear	c
Jane	c
Clark	c
,	c

Secondly	c
I	i
belive	i
you	c
should	c
know	c
that	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
people	c
,	c
including	c
me	c
,	c
were	c
not	c
able	c
to	c
enjoy	c
concerts	i
because	c
some	c
concert	c
halls	c
were	c
too	c
small	c
.	c

Once	c
again	c
congratulations	i
on	c
the	c
Festival	c
.	c

tips	i
to	i
earn	i
money	c

there	i
are	c
several	c
ways	c
to	c
earn	c
a	c
bit	c
of	c
money	c
in	c
your	c
spare	c
time	c
.	c

One	c
of	c
the	c
most	c
common	c
examples	c
is	c
baby-	i
sitting	i
taking	c
care	c
of	c
little	c
children	c
is	c
easy	c
and	c
it	c
does	c
n't	c
require	c
special	c
skills	c
,	i
all	c
you	c
need	c
is	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
patience	c
.	c

If	c
looking	c
after	c
children	c
does	c
n't	c
fit	i
you	c
,	c
you	c
can	c
try	c
with	i
pets	c
.	c

Lots	c
of	c
people	c
would	c
pay	c
you	c
to	c
take	c
their	c
dog	c
for	c
a	c
walk	c
.	c

So	c
if	c
you	c
like	c
animals	c
this	c
is	c
your	c
chance	c
to	c
earn	c
money	i
and	c
have	c
fun	c
at	c
the	c
same	c
time	c
.	c

Another	c
option	c
is	c
to	c
wash	c
your	c
neighbour	c
's	c
car	c
.	c

Dear	c
Ms	c
Ryan	c

So	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
choose	c
climbing	c
and	c
photography	c
.	c

Last	c
year	c
I	c
took	c
part	c
in	c
photograher	i
's	i
contest	c
and	c
I	c
won	c
a	c
second	c
prize	c
in	c
Poland	c
in	c
cathegory	i
of	c
,,beautiful	c
scenery	c
''	c
.	c

Climbing	c
,	c
in	c
contrast	c
,	c
is	c
something	c
I	c
started	c
few	i
months	c
ago	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
have	c
not	c
gained	c
any	c
success	c
in	c
this	c
sport	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	i
also	i
to	c
know	c
what	c
the	c
cost	c
of	c
spending	c
two	c
weeks	c
in	c
the	c
U.S.A.	c
is	c
.	c

I	c
want	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
ones	i
more	c
for	c
taking	i
me	i
into	i
consideration	i
in	c
your	c
competition	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

What	c
did	c
you	c
feel	c
?	c

There	c
is	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
situations	c
which	c
could	c
make	c
you	c
feel	c
similar	c
while	c
you	c
do	c
shopping	c
.	c

You	c
might	c
spend	c
too	c
much	c
money	c
and	c
buy	c
something	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
really	c
need	c
.	c

You	c
could	c
also	c
buy	c
something	c
which	c
later	c
turns	c
out	c
to	c
be	c
out	i
of	i
order	i
.	c

So	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
it	c
.	c

Very	c
often	c
a	c
shop	c
assistant	c
is	c
not	c
helpful	c
so	c
you	c
lose	c
your	c
money	c
and	c
your	c
time	c
.	c

And	c
you	c
could	c
n't	c
of	c
course	c
give	i
it	c
back	c
because	c
the	c
price	c
was	c
lowered	c
and	c
your	c
dress	c
is	c
not	c
under	c
guarantee	c
.	c

You	c
could	c
also	c
face	c
an	c
unpleasant	c
situation	c
connected	c
with	c
money	c
.	c

Deceived	c
?	c

So	c
if	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
want	c
to	c
feel	c
deceived	c
or	c
offended	c
,	c
think	c
twice	c
before	c
you	c
decide	c
to	c
go	c
shopping	c
.	c

(	c
A	c
very	c
depressing	c
point	c
of	c
view	c
,	c
is	c
n't	c
it	c
?	c
)	c

I	c
have	c
several	c
precisions	i
to	c
tell	c
you	c
and	c
some	c
questions	c
about	c
the	c
camp	c
.	c

Then	c
,	c
about	c
accommodation	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
a	c
tent	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
used	c
to	c
.	i

I	c
have	c
already	c
been	c
in	i
different	i
summer	c
camps	c
and	c
I	c
always	c
choose	c
this	c
accommodation	c
,	i
I	c
find	c
it	c
more	c
friendly	i
than	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
.	c

I	c
also	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
practice	i
climbing	c
but	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
done	c
it	c
before	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
what	c
sort	c
of	c
clothes	c
do	c
advise	i
me	c
to	c
bring	c
to	c
be	c
at	i
ease	i
during	c
my	c
activities	c
and	c
as	i
nearly	c
everything	c
is	c
already	c
paid	c
,	i
do	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
take	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
money	c
with	c
me	c
?	c

I	c
tried	c
to	c
play	c
the	c
drums	c
but	c
I	c
was	c
expelled	i
from	i
the	c
stage	c
by	c
a	c
member	c
of	c
the	c
group	c
who	c
was	c
in	c
a	c
bad	c
mood	c
.	c

Brenda	c

My	c
name	c
is	c
Sandre	c
Atos	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
writting	i
to	c
you	c
because	c
this	i
last	c
weekend	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
,	i
you	c
manage	c
,	c
to	c
see	c
what	c
was	c
called	c
"	c
London	c
's	c
newest	c
and	c
best	c
musical	c
show	c
"	c
.	c

Besides	c
the	i
spectacle	c
was	c
setted	i
up	i
to	c
19:30	i
,	c
but	c
ended	c
up	c
starting	c
at	c
20:15	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
after	c
the	c
play	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
still	c
closed	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
since	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
child	c
I	c
have	c
noticed	c
that	c
except	i
for	c
the	c
medical	c
facilities	c
and	c
achievements	c
,	c
it	c
has	c
brought	c
to	i
me	c
more	c
disadvantages	c
than	c
advantages	c
.	c

Unfortunatly	i
my	c
parents	c
did	c
not	c
realize	c
how	c
TV	c
was	c
creating	i
a	i
role	i
among	c
us	c
.	c

Before	c
TV	c
,	c
we	c
used	c
to	c
spend	c
our	c
nights	c
,	i
playing	c
cards	c
,	c
telling	c
jokes	c
,	c
talking	c
to	c
each	c
other	c
.	c

Despite	c
all	c
these	c
advantages	c
,	c
I	c
deeply	c
miss	c
the	c
times	c
I	c
had	c
almost	c
no	c
technological	c
facilities	i
,	c
but	c
a	c
very	c
happy	c
and	c
united	c
family	c
.	c

Dear	c
Jane	c
C	c

I	c
have	i
spent	i
two	i
days	i
at	i
the	i
International	i
Arts	i
Festival	i
recently	i
and	c
I	c
am	c
writing	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
give	c
my	c
opinions	c
about	c
it	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
knew	i
it	i
was	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
an	c
international	c
festival	c
,	c
I	c
got	c
really	c
excited	c
because	c
I	c
would	c
finally	c
have	c
the	c
opportunity	c
to	c
meet	c
stars	c
and	c
artists	c
from	c
around	c
the	c
world	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
felt	c
rather	c
disappointed	c
when	c
I	c
found	c
out	c
that	c
was	c
not	c
at	c
all	c
true	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
the	c
one-reasonably-priced	i
weekend	c
ticket	c
for	c
all	c
events	i
was	c
marvellous	c
because	c
I	c
was	c
able	c
to	c
attend	c
as	c
many	c
concerts	c
as	c
I	c
wished	c
without	c
spending	c
much	c
money	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
really	i
appreciate	i
it	c
if	c
you	c
would	i
take	i
into	c
consideration	c
the	c
problem	c
with	c
the	c
lack	c
of	c
space	c
in	c
the	c
concert	c
halls	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c

these	c
pieces	i

suggestions	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Personally	c
,	c
I	c
can	i
not	i
imagine	c
human	c
life	c
without	c
rules	c
,	c
especially	c
those	c
that	c
have	c
to	c
do	c
with	c
respecting	c
other	c
people	c
.	c

As	c
a	c
consequence	c
,	c
most	c
mates	i
used	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
those	c
rules	c
but	c
all	c
of	c
us	c
tried	c
to	c
put	c
up	c
with	c
them	c
.	c

Fortunately	c
,	c
rules	c
are	c
made	c
by	c
every	c
member	c
of	c
the	c
family	c
so	c
that	c
no	c
one	c
complains	c
about	c
them	c

17/6/00	c

I	c
had	c
a	c
vary	i
dissappointing	i
evining	i
last	c
saturday	i
.	c

So	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
over	c
we	c
walked	c
out	c
and	c
followed	c
all	c
the	c
signs	c
for	c
about	c
5	c
minutes	c
desparately	i
searching	c
for	c
your	c
restaurants	i
our	i
stomaches	i
rumbling	c
for	c
food	c
.	c

they	i
even	c
gave	c
us	c
a	c
table	c
number	c
.	c

What	c
kind	c
of	c
an	c
organasation	i
do	c
you	c
call	c
this	c
,	c
sir/madam	c
?	c

You	c
do	c
n't	c
understand	c
how	c
dissappointed	i
and	c
angry	c
I	c
was	c
that	c
night	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
expecting	c
a	c
perfect	c
night	c
out	c
but	c
I	c
came	c
face	c
to	c
face	c
with	c
a	c
total	c
nightmare	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

In	c
fact	c
he	c
was	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
main	i
busybodies	c
of	c
his	c
neighborhood	i
and	c
his	c
school	c
so	c
not	c
alot	i
of	c
people	c
in	c
his	c
school	c
liked	c
him	c
.	c

this	i
was	c
a	i
vary	i
bad	i
thing	i
about	i
Pat	i
's	i
school	i
and	i
also	i
for	i
Pat	i
.	c

No	c
one	c
could	c
do	c
anything	c
about	c
it	c
.	i

Everyone	c
was	c
enjoying	c
themselves	c
exept	i
Pat	c
who	i
had	c
heard	c
about	c
the	c
raid	c
.	c

So	c
he	c
was	c
thinking	c
up	c
an	c
excuse	c
to	c
go	c
home	c
early	c
.	c

They	c
had	c
water	c
bombs	c
and	c
water	c
pistols	c
at	c
the	c
ready	c
.	c

they	i
started	c
charging	c
down	c
the	c
field	c
towards	c
the	c
fire	c
and	c
once	c
in	c
range	c
everyone	c
thew	i
their	c
balloon	i
as	c
far	c
as	c
they	c
could	c
.	c

But	c
he	c
felt	c
awfull	i
because	c
he	c
new	i
that	c
all	c
this	c
had	c
happened	c
because	c
of	c
him	c
.	c

It	c
was	i
very	i
good	c
programme	c
,	c
especially	c
the	c
river	c
trip	c
to	c
Greenwich	c
,	c
which	c
I	c
am	c
sure	c
the	c
whole	c
class	c
would	i
enjoy	c
.	c

It	c
will	c
be	c
held	c
at	c
the	c
Central	c
Exhibition	c
Hall	c
in	c
London	c
on	c
the	c
14th	c
March	c
.	c

The	c
whole	c
class	c
is	c
also	c
very	c
excited	c
about	c
this	c
fashion	c
show	c
and	c
would	c
really	c
appreciate	c
your	c
giving	c
them	c
a	c
change	i
to	c
go	c
.	c

We	c
would	c
have	c
to	c
forgo	c
the	c
shopping	c
as	c
we	c
might	c
not	c
have	c
enough	c
time	c
and	c
the	c
exchange	c
rate	c
might	c
be	c
too	c
high	c
for	c
us	c
to	c
do	c
much	c
shopping	c
.	c

Lastly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
be	c
very	c
grateful	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
give	c
us	c
your	c
permission	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

Everyday	i
,	c
something	c
changes	c
and	c
we	c
become	c
more	c
modern	i
companies	i
use	c
computers	c
instead	c
of	c
books	c
,	c
dentist	i
use	c
modernized	c
electrical	i
item	i
instead	c
of	c
just	c
a	c
plier	i
,	i
even	i
homes	c
are	c
effected	i
.	c

We	c
might	c
even	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
open	c
the	c
door	c
without	c
getting	i
out	i
from	i
the	c
living	c
room	c
.	c

The	c
furniture	c
should	c
not	c
change	c
that	c
much	c
on	c
the	c
outside	c
and	c
the	c
amount	i
of	c
rooms	c
should	c
not	c
change	c
too	i
.	c

In	c
the	c
future	c
,	c
every	c
child	c
might	c
have	c
a	c
laptop	c
.	c

And	c
instead	c
of	c
going	c
to	c
school	c
,	c
why	c
not	c
let	c
school	c
come	c
to	c
you	c
?	c

We	c
will	c
be	c
learning	c
at	c
home	c
using	c
computers	c
and	c
disc	i
.	c

Another	c
way	c
our	c
home	c
could	c
be	c
different	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
is	c
probably	c
the	c
utilitles	i
we	c
are	i
using	c
.	c

Our	c
homes	c
will	c
still	c
be	c
the	c
same	c
in	c
terms	c
of	c
the	c
kitchen	i
,	i
it	i
will	c
still	c
be	c
filled	c
with	c
vegetables	c
and	c
meat	c
.	c

This	c
is	c
because	c
people	c
wo	c
n't	c
miss	i
the	c
great	c
taste	c
of	c
food	i
although	i
it	c
could	c
be	c
subsituted	i
to	i
a	c
vitamin	c
pill	c
or	c
two	c
.	c

I	c
especially	c
appreciate	i
the	c
weekend	c
tickets	c
which	c
almost	c
everybody	c
could	c
afford	c
,	c
also	i
students	c
like	c
me	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
some	c
concert	c
halls	c
were	c
too	c
small	c
for	c
the	c
musical	c
performances	c
.	c

You	c
probably	c
did	c
not	c
expect	c
such	c
a	c
big	c
audience	c
!	c

I	c
hope	c
that	c
you	c
will	c
appreciate	c
my	c
opinions	c
and	c
suggestions	c
,	c
which	c
I	c
have	c
shared	c
with	c
my	c
friends	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

You	c
could	c
move	c
from	c
children	c
to	c
pets	c
and	c
become	c
a	c
dog-sitter	c
,	c
spending	c
your	c
afternoons	c
walking	c
round	c
the	c
park	c
and	c
chatting	c
with	c
a	c
friend	c
.	c

You	c
could	c
sell	c
them	c
to	c
a	c
specialised	c
shop	c
and	c
finally	c
tidy	c
up	c
your	c
room	c
!	c

So	c
,	c
what	c
are	c
waiting	i
for	c
?	c

It	c
was	c
n't	c
complicated	i
to	c
find	c
the	c
right	c
hall	c
to	i
the	c
shows	c
,	c
I	c
should	i
say	c
it	c
was	c
very	c
well	c
organised	c
.	c

But	c
one	c
thing	c
,	i
I	c
have	c
to	c
mention	c
is	c
that	c
some	c
of	c
the	c
concert	c
halls	c
was	i
too	c
small	c
and	c
it	i
was	i
n't	i
comfortable	c
as	i
well	i
as	i
to	i
fell	i
the	c
great	c
atmosphere	c
.	c

What	c
a	c
pitty	i
!	c

By	c
the	c
way	c
how	i
is	c
your	c
new	c
school	c
?	c

Privat	i
schools	c
have	c
more	i
relaxed	c
atmosphere	c
that	i
the	c
state	c
school	i
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
in	c
the	c
state	c
schools	c
as	c
I	c
said	c
,	c
we	c
are	c
more	c
respectful	c
to	c
the	c
teacher	c
and	c
bad	c
behaviours	i
are	i
punished	c
.	c

My	c
Father	i
does	c
the	c
cooking	c
,	c
my	c
mother	c
does	c
the	c
cleaning	c
and	c
I	c
do	i
tidying	i
up	c
!	c

But	c
in	c
many	c
Families	i
women	i
are	i
doing	i
more	c
than	c
men	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
to	c
hearing	i
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c

As	c
you	c
mentioned	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
the	c
competition	c
-	c
two	c
weeks	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
in	c
the	c
U.S.A.	c
therefore	i
here	c
is	c
the	c
information	c
that	c
you	c
require	c
.	c

I	c
can	c
travel	c
only	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
during	c
this	c
month	c
I	c
am	c
free	c
to	c
go	c
anywhere	c
,	i
actually	i
it	c
is	c
my	c
summer	c
holiday	c
.	c

Apart	c
from	c
that	c
I	c
would	c
n't	c
mind	c
at	c
all	c
whether	c
to	i
stay	i
in	c
tents	c
or	c
log	c
cabins	c
but	c
if	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
choose	c
between	c
these	c
two	c
I	c
'd	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
tents	c
because	c
it	i
gives	i
me	c
a	c
nice	c
feeling	c
and	i
relaxation	c
,	i
it	i
is	c
very	c
unusal	i
for	i
me	i
to	c
stay	c
in	c
log	c
cabins	c
while	c
you	c
are	c
camping	c
.	c

Finally	c
I	c
have	c
something	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
about	c
how	c
many	c
people	c
can	c
stay	c
in	c
one	c
tents	i
?	i

Do	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
bring	c
swimming	c
suit	i
if	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
swim	c
in	i
the	c
camp	c
?	c

This	c
information	c
should	c
enough	i
for	c
you	c
but	c
if	c
you	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
more	c
about	c
anything	c
please	c
ask	c
me	c
and	c
do	c
not	c
hesitate	c
.	c

Your	i
sincerely	c
,	c

Sometime	i
when	c
you	c
ask	c
your	c
friend	c
especially	i
girls	c
.	i

However	c
,	c
for	c
me	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

Why	c
?	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
it	i
's	i
wasting	i
my	c
time	c
especially	i
when	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
find	c
the	c
thing	c
I	c
want	c
,	i
this	i
is	c
very	c
frustrating	c
.	c

Once	c
you	c
've	c
got	c
all	i
your	i
shopping	c
list	c
,	c
you	c
also	c
have	c
to	c
carry	c
all	c
the	c
bags	c
that	c
you	c
just	c
bought	c
which	i
is	i
very	c
heavy	c
sometime	i
.	c

However	c
shopping	i
is	c
not	c
a	c
bad	c
thing	c
,	i
only	i
if	c
you	c
plan	c
it	i
carefully	c
what	c
to	c
buy	c
,	c
where	c
to	c
go	c
,	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
you	c
will	c
spend	c
on	i
?	c

Dear	c
the	i
competition	c
organiser	c
(	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
)	c

I	c
think	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
the	i
accommodation	i
at	i
Camp	i
California	i
is	i
in	i
tents	i
.	c

The	c
activities	c
are	c
quite	c
hard	c
to	c
choose	c
really	c
,	c
because	c
you	c
have	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
chose	i
which	c
is	i
I	c
like	c
.	c

Photography	c
is	c
a	c
very	c
interesting	c
activitie	i
,	c
and	c
is	c
not	c
too	c
hard	c
to	c
do	c
too	i
.	c

Here	c
have	i
some	c
questions	c
which	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
,	i
what	i
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
sould	i
I	c
need	c
?	c

How	c
much	c
did	i
I	c
need	c
for	c
the	c
Camp	c
?	c

Yours	c
Sincerely	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c

So	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
thing	c
you	c
will	c
enjoy	c
most	c
of	c
the	c
time	c
,	c
but	c
still	c
have	i
something	i
you	i
will	i
not	i
enjoy	i
it	i
.	c

It	c
depends	c
on	c
what	i
is	i
the	i
place	i
and	i
the	i
aim	i
you	i
are	i
shopping	i
.	c

For	c
example	c
in	i
HK	c
all	i
the	i
areas	i
have	i
lots	i
of	i
people	i
it	i
wo	i
n't	i
let	i
you	i
feel	i
good	i
of	i
the	i
noise	i
and	i
times	i
when	i
you	i
are	i
shopping	i
.	c

After	i
I	c
've	c
written	c
this	c
composition	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
you	c
will	c
enjoy	c
shopping	c
most	c
of	c
the	c
time	c
,	c
but	c
still	c
have	i
sometimes	c
you	c
wo	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
,	c

Besides	i
of	c
all	c
,	c
at	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
the	c
Musical	c
,	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	i
your	c
Theatre	c
Restaurant	c
,	c
in	c
order	c
of	i
taking	i
a	i
dinner	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
have	i
leaft	i
home	c
without	c
eating	c
and	c
so	c
I	c
was	c
hungry	c
at	c
that	c
time	c
.	c

Thus	i
,	c
you	c
can	i
n't	i
believe	c
what	i
was	i
my	i
disappointment	i
when	c
I	c
noted	i
that	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
,	c
without	i
no	i
explanation	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
say	i
you	c
that	c
I	c
am	c
asking	c
for	c
money	i
back	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
had	c
an	i
evening	i
totally	i
despleased	i
,	c
completely	c
different	c
that	i
you	c
have	i
anouced	i
in	c
your	c
advertisement	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

From	i
that	c
time	c
,	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
buy	c
my	c
own	c
computer	c
and	c
every	c
day	c
I	c
was	c
improving	c
my	c
knowledge	c
.	c

Nowadays	c
,	c
I	c
can	i
n't	i
stay	i
one	c
day	c
without	c
consulting	c
computers	i
communications	c
throught	i
e-mail	c
or	c
internet	i
.	c

My	c
life	c
would	c
n't	c
be	c
the	c
same	c
another	i
time	i
without	c
these	i
progress	c

Even	c
if	c
my	c
parents	c
do	c
n't	c
look	i
after	i
me	i
for	i
all	i
the	i
matters	i
like	c
going	c
out	c
on	i
nights	i
or	c
studying	c
you	c
do	i
n't	i
have	i
to	i
think	i
that	c
living	c
in	c
my	c
house	c
is	c
like	c
living	c
in	c
heaven	c
because	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
play	c
the	c

listen	c
to	c

a	c

a	c

I	c
am	c
afraid	c
that	c
the	c
only	c
possible	c
time	c
for	c
me	c
to	c

is	c
in	c

it	c

I	c
am	c
able	c
to	c

I	c
need	c
to	c
know	c
how	c
much	c

you	c
would	c
advise	c
me	c
to	c
bring	c

what	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
,	c

Your	i
sincerely	c
,	c

We	c
have	c
been	c
talking	c
for	c
hours	c
in	c
our	c
class	c
about	c
the	i
treatment	i
of	i
the	i
media	i
regarding	i
famous	i
people	i
.	c

Of	c
course	c
I	c
must	c
agree	c
with	c
the	c
opinion	c
of	c
my	c
class	i
-	i
mates	i
:	c
famous	c
people	c
,	c
such	c
as	c
actors	c
,	c
singers	c
or	c
politicians	c
,	c
deserve	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
private	c
life	c
,	c
but	c
of	c
course	c
it	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
like	i
this	i
!	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
say	c
that	c
this	c
is	c
not	c
the	c
bigger	i
problem	c
that	c
the	c
world	c
has	c
and	c
--	c
it	c
is	c
not	c
my	c
problem	c
becouse	i
I	c
am	c
not	c
famous	c
!	c

Dear	c
Mr.	c
Robertson	c
,	c

It	c
is	c
a	c
good	c
programme	c
,	i
especially	i
National	i
Art	c
Gallery	c
is	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
most	i
places	i
we	i
would	i
like	c
to	c
visit	c
.	c

In	c
fact	c
,	c
some	c
of	c
our	i
classmates	c
have	c
seen	c
an	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
'	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
'	c
.	c

Of	c
course	c
,	c
leisure	i
as	c
well	c
.	c

Therefore	c
,	c
if	c
it	c
is	c
possible	c
,	c
we	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
show	c
in	c
the	c
afternoon	c
on	c
14	c
March	c
instead	c
of	c
going	c
shopping	c
.	c

It	c
would	c
be	c
very	c
much	c
appreciated	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
arrange	c
the	i
programme	c
to	c
be	c
changed	c
.	c

We	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
a	i
good	c
news	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
as	c
human	c
beings	c
,	c
almost	c
all	c
of	c
us	c
are	c
curious	c
.	c

This	c
is	c
why	c
gossip	c
magazines	c
are	c
so	c
popular	c
.	c

There	i
,	c
it	c
is	c
impossible	c
for	c
journalists	c
to	c
stop	c
chasing	c
them	c
.	c

Of	c
course	c
,	c
it	i
everyone	c
pays	i
less	c
attention	c
or	c
interest	i
,	c
the	c
situations	i
should	i
be	c
better	c
.	c

Although	c
we	c
can	i
not	i
deny	c
it	c
is	c
our	c
nature	c
-	c
curious	i
,	i
we	c
can	c
improve	c
our	c
sence	i
of	c
morality	c
and	c
try	c
to	c
think	c
about	c
the	c
importance	c
of	c
privacy	c
for	c
them	c
.	c

Actually	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
happy	c
to	c
hear	c
that	c
journalists	c
have	c
learned	c
their	c
lesson	c
from	c
the	c
death	c
of	c
Princess	c
Diana	c
and	c
try	c
to	c
let	c
her	c
children	c
and	c
Royal	i
family	c
have	c
more	c
privacy	c
.	c

Lets	i
all	c
leave	c
them	c
more	c
freedom	c
to	c
enjoy	c
their	c
private	c
lives	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
my	c
pleasure	c
to	c
write	c
my	c
suggestion	c
for	c
you	c
now	c
!	c

Because	c
he	c
especially	i
concentrates	c
on	c
history	i
,	c
social	i
life	i
and	c
politic	i
situation	c
in	i
the	c
time	c
the	c
story	c
is	c
played	i
.	c

That	c
might	i
be	c
quiet	i
complicated	i
to	c
understand	c
,	c
especially	c
for	c
young	c
people	c
.	c

For	c
me	c
,	c
his	c
books	c
are	c
great	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
written	c
by	c
Agatha	c
Christie	c
.	c

She	c
's	c
an	c
American	c
and	c
her	c
books	c
concentrate	c
on	c
crime	c
and	c
detective	c
stories	c
.	c

Her	c
books	c
are	c
n't	c
difficult	c
to	c
understand	c
.	c

She	c
especially	i
write	i
books	i
for	c
young	c
people	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
this	c
is	c
the	c
best	c
choice	c
for	c
him	c
!	c

I	c
've	c
send	i
you	c
a	c
copy	c
of	c
the	c
summary	c
from	c
the	c
book	c
and	c
an	c
interesting	c
article	c
about	c
the	c
author	c
and	c
the	c
book	c

See	c
you	c

Love	c

Dear	c

Indeed	i
it	i

As	c

are	c
in	c
England	c
to	c
learn	c
your	c
language	c
and	c
also	c
your	i
lifestyle	c
,	c
and	c
we	c
thought	c
this	c
show	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
good	c
opportunity	c
for	c
us	c
to	c
discorve	i
this	c
way	i
of	c
your	c
country	c
!	c

I	c
hope	c
that	c
my	c
idea	c
sweet	i
you	c
and	c
you	c
'll	c
agree	c

Sincerely	c

The	c
last	c
book	c
I	c
read	c
was	c
Wuthering	c
Heights	c
by	c
Emilie	c
Brontë	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
a	c
fantastique	i
book	c
,	c
which	c
I	c
recommend	c
to	c
everybody	c
keen	c
on	c
lovestories	i
.	c

It	c
'll	c
be	c
a	c
good	c
point	c
for	c
her	c
general	c
culture	i
,	i
Wuthering	c
Heights	c
it	i
's	i
a	c
classic	c
,	c
which	c
everybody	c
knows	c
about	c
it	i
,	c
even	c
if	c
they	c
did	i
n't	i
have	i
read	c
it	c
,	c
they	c
,	i
at	c
liest	i
,	i
know	c
the	c
story	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

The	c
show	c
should	c
start	c
at	c
19.30	c
,	i
however	i
,	c
the	c
audience	c
have	i
been	i
waiting	i
for	c
fourty	i
five	i
minutes	c
.	c

Based	c
on	c
everything	c
listed	c
above	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
recieve	i
£	i
10	c
,	i
which	c
I	c
have	i
paid	i
,	i
back	c
.	c

How	c
has	c
morden	i
technology	c
changed	c
my	c
life	c
.	i

There	c
are	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
arguments	c
about	c
the	i
weather	i
this	c
influence	c
is	c
negative	c
or	c
positive	c
.	c

And	c
,	c
of	c
course	c
,	c
I	c
can	i
not	i
forget	c
about	c
cars	c
and	c
planes	c
that	c
deliver	i
us	c
to	c
all	c
parts	c
of	c
the	c
Earth	c
.	c

Counting	c
pros	i
and	c
cons	c
,	c
I	c
tend	c
to	c
think	c
that	c
there	c
are	c
more	c
positive	c
points	c
in	i
working	i
out	i
and	c
manufacturing	c
new	c
technologies	c
than	c
negative	c
ones	c
anyway	c
.	c

Modern	i
girl	c
or	c
boy	c
already	i
would	i
not	i
be	i
able	i
to	c
imagine	c
life	c
without	c
them	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
,	c

I	c
would	c
be	c
very	c
greatful	i
if	c
you	c
could	c
let	c
us	c
to	i
go	i
the	i
show	c
.	c

I	c
've	c
heard	c
that	c
Leisure	i
and	c
sports	c
wear	c
,	c
make	i
up	i
and	c
hairstyles	c
are	c
really	c
wonderful	c
.	c

We	c
can	c
also	c
do	c
shopping	i
quickly	c
after	c
sightseeing	c
of	i
London	c
.	c

I	c
also	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
say	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
organising	c
the	i
good	i
program	i
for	c
us	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

That	c
day	c
,	c
I	c
got	c
up	c
early	c
because	c
I	c
had	c
n't	c
slept	c
very	c
well	c
.	c

I	c
checked	c
everything	c
again	c
and	c
again	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
afraid	c
of	i
doing	i
it	c
but	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
promised	c
her	c
to	i
find	i
a	i
money	c
for	c
her	c
operation	c
.	c

She	c
was	c
at	c
the	c
hospital	c
and	c
she	c
was	c
really	c
bad	c
.	c

I	c
did	c
n't	c
want	c
anybody	c
to	c
recognise	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
told	c
everybody	c
to	c
lie	c
down	c
.	c

They	c
did	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
quickly	c
left	c
bank	i
.	c

The	c
worst	c
thing	c
was	c
my	c
friend	c
died	c
after	i
10	i
days	i
I	c
was	c
arrested	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
appreciate	c
you	i
well-organised	c
programme	c
,	c
especially	c
,	i
"	i
River	c
Trip	c
to	c
Greenwich	c
"	c
which	c
we	c
requested	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
suggest	c
you	c
to	i
change	i
the	i
part	c
of	c
programme	i
for	i
visiting	i
this	c
show	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
"	c
shopping	c
on	c
14	c
,	i
March	c
'	c
can	c
be	c
changed	c
to	c
15	c
,	i
March	c
instead	c
of	c
"	c
Free	c
time	c
"	c
.	c

So	c
we	c
will	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
use	c
the	c
time	c
at	i
the	c
afternoon	c
on	c
14	c
,	i
March	c
for	c
visiting	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
that	c
you	c
would	i
give	c
us	c
an	c
opportunity	c
to	c
visit	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

But	c
on	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
ordinary	c
people	c
,	c
including	c
me	c
,	c
are	c
keen	c
on	c
watching	c
film	c
stars	c
or	c
super	c
models	c
fashion	i
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
people	c
are	c
interested	c
in	c
their	c
life	i
style	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
glad	c
to	c
write	c
to	c
you	c
.	c

Here	c
are	c
some	c
opinions	c
and	c
suggestions	c
:	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
there	c
were	i
a	c
lot	c
that	c
impressed	c
me	c
very	c
much	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
there	c
was	c
one	c
reasonably-priced	i
weekend	c
ticket	c
for	c
all	c
events	c
.	c

I	c
enjoyed	c
it	c
very	c
much	c
.	c

Sincerely	c
yours	c
,	c

Long	c
long	c
ago	c
,	c
there	c
lived	c
in	c
a	i
province	c
of	c
Bizen	c
in	c
Japan	c
an	c
old	c
woman	c
and	c
an	c
old	c
man	c
.	c

They	c
were	c
eagar	i
to	c
have	c
a	c
child	c
,	c
but	c
they	c
had	c
never	c
been	c
able	c
to	c
.	c

They	c
named	c
him	c
Momotaro	c
,	c
and	c
looked	c
after	c
him	c
.	c

The	c
boy	c
had	c
grown	c
and	c
had	c
become	c
very	c
strong	c
when	c
he	c
heard	c
that	c
there	c
were	c
lots	c
of	c
devils	c
on	c
Onigashima	c
Island	c
who	c
robbed	c
many	c
people	c
in	c
Bizen	c
of	c
much	i
money	c
and	c
many	i
treasures	i
.	c

He	c
made	c
up	c
his	c
mind	c
to	c
defeat	c
them	c
,	c
and	c
asked	c
his	c
stepmother	c
for	c
some	c
kibidango	c
,	c
one	c
of	c
traditional	c
snacks	c
in	c
Japan	c
.	c

After	c
that	c
,	c
they	c
went	c
home	c
.	c

All	c
the	c
people	c
in	c
Bizen	c
including	c
his	c
stepparents	c
met	i
Momotaro	c
and	c
his	c
friends	c
with	c
a	i
great	c
joy	c
.	c

Ryan	c

I	c
have	c
received	c
your	i
good	c

With	c
regard	c
to	c
the	c
activities	c

the	c
Camp	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
choose	c
basketball	c
and	c
photography	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
basketball	c
is	c
very	i
complete	i
sport	c
for	c
training	c
your	c
muscles	c
and	c
I	c
used	c
to	c
play	c
in	c
a	c
league	c
in	c
my	c
country	c
,	i
it	i
's	i
hard	c
but	c
at	c
the	c
same	c
time	c
lovely	c
.	c

Another	c
thing	c
is	i
if	c
the	c
meals	c

I	i

It	c
will	c
take	c
place	c
in	c
Central	i
Exhibition	c
Hall	c
,	c
in	c
London	c
,	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
14th	i
of	c
March	c
and	c
the	i
suitable	i
time	i
will	c
be	c
10.00	c
-	c
19.00	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
more	c
details	c
about	c
the	c
show	c
and	c
particularly	c
what	i
does	i
it	c
include	i
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
your	c
reply	c
,	c

If	c
somebody	c
is	c
a	c
film	c
star	c
this	c
mean	i
that	c
has	i
got	c
a	c
different	c
kind	c
of	c
life	c
,	c
more	i
comfortable	c
,	c
more	c
interesting	c
but	i
it	c
does	c
n't	c
mean	c
that	c
he	c
or	c
she	c
ca	c
n't	c
be	c
like	c
normal	c
people	c
even	c
if	c
he	c
or	c
she	c
is	c
a	c
star	c
.	c

If	c
somebody	c
wants	c
to	c
be	c
famous	c
of	c
cource	i
must	i
be	c
on	i
the	i
top	i
and	c
the	c
mass	c
media	c
will	c
be	c
following	c
him	c
or	c
her	c
.	c

You	c
must	c
control	c
your	c
behaviour	c
and	c
try	c
not	c
implove	i
so	c
much	c
yourself	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
International	i
Arts	c
Festival	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
idea	c
,	c
because	c
you	c
can	c
see	c
how	c
other	c
country	i
's	i
art	c
is	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
think	c
in	c
this	c
festival	c
,	c
there	c
were	c
too	i
many	i
country	i

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
the	c
tickets	c
for	c
all	c
events	c
is	c
a	c
wonderful	c
idea	c
,	c
because	c
everybody	c
has	c
a	c
chance	c
to	c
see	c
everything	c
and	c
the	c
people	c
would	c
think	c
this	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
festival	c
.	c

Generally	c
it	c
was	c
very	c
good	c
and	c
I	c
wish	i
more	c
people	c
would	i
come	c
next	c

Dear	c
Tim	c
,	c
I	c
'm	c
glad	c
to	c
have	c
your	c
letter	c
back	c
soon	i
.	c

Do	c
you	c
want	c
to	c
know	c
about	c
our	c
country	c
's	c
rules	c
?	c

I	c
think	c
your	c
country	c
and	c
our	c
country	c
's	c
rules	c
are	c
the	c
same	c
.	c

First	c
,	c
In	i
school	c
,	c
we	c
are	c
not	c
allowed	c
to	c
run	c
.	c

This	c
is	c
very	c
important	c
,	c
because	c
many	c
accidents	c
happen	c
because	c
of	c
running	c
.	c

You	c
have	c
to	c
do	c
your	c
homework	c
and	c
do	c
your	c
best	c
what	i
you	c
're	c
asked	c
to	c
do	c
.	c

Tell	c
me	c
about	c
English	c
rules	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
curious	c
about	c
it	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
being	i
organised	i
the	c
programme	c
for	c
our	c
class	c
,	i
I	c
think	c
you	c
may	i
think	i
about	i
a	i
long	i
time	i
that	i
how	c
shall	i
we	i
study	c
during	c
three	i
days	c
.	c

In	c
other	c
words	c
,	c
what	c
they	c
will	c
introduce	i
,	i
is	c
most	i
interested	i
in	i
us	c
,	i
I	i
mean	i
it	i
's	i
conflict	i
with	c
your	c
plan	c
,	i
what	i
a	c
pity	c
!	c

All	c
of	c
us	c
want	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
show	c
,	i
the	i
generation	c
who	c
are	c
the	c
same	c
ago	i
with	i
us	c
all	c
like	c
make	i
up	i
,	c
become	i
beautiful	i
,	c
and	c
it	c
's	c
important	c
that	c
it	c
will	c
free	i
for	c
students	c
and	c
just	c
be	c
showed	i
one	i
day	c
.	c

Best	c
Wishes	c

It	c
was	c
dangerous	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
knew	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
.	c

This	c
story	c
happed	i
two	c
years	c
ago	c
.	c

That	c
was	c
a	c
very	c
hot	c
summer	c
,	i
every	i
people	c
in	c
our	c
city	c
like	i
to	c
swim	c
in	c
the	c
river	c
,	i
perhaps	i
they	c
did	c
n't	c
think	c
it	c
was	c
interesting	c
if	c
they	c
swimed	i
in	c
the	c
pool	c
.	c

Not	c
only	c
I	i
was	i
a	c
member	c
of	c
swimming	i
team	c
in	c
our	c
school	c
,	c
but	c
also	c
I	c
was	i
tought	i
by	c
my	c
father	c
since	c
I	c
was	c
five	c
years	c
old	c
,	i
So	c
I	c
would	i
understood	i
some	c
skills	c
and	c
how	i
to	c
protect	c
yourself	i
from	c
my	c
Dad	c
,	c
if	i
you	i
had	i
a	i
accident	i
.	c

Suddenly	c
,	c
I	c
heard	c
of	i
"	c
help	i
,	c
help	c
"	c
in	c
my	i
distance	c
.	c

Thank	c
goodness	c
,	c
I	c
succeed	i
,	i
save	i
that	c
struggled	i
child	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
went	i
the	c
river-side	i
bank	c
,	c
I	c
saw	c
some	c
red-faced	i
.	c

I	c
enjoyed	c
it	c
and	c
found	c
worthy	i
to	i
visit	i
.	c

The	c
Annual	c
International	c
Arts	c
Festival	c
,	c
which	c
was	c
held	c
on	c
the	c
21st	c
and	c
22nd	c
of	c
November	c
,	c
was	c
colourful	c
with	c
the	i
stars	c
and	c
artist	i
coming	c
from	c
around	c
the	c
world	c
.	c

Although	c
this	c
was	c
true	c
,	c
they	c
were	c
from	c
only	c
six	c
countries	c
.	c

The	c
concert	c
halls	c
were	c
not	c
big	c
enough	c
to	c
let	c
all	c
the	c
guests	c
in	c
.	c

The	c
organisation	c
was	c
very	c
good	c
I	i
found	c
chances	c
to	c
see	c
dance	c
shows	c
,	c
art	c
exhibitions	c
and	c
to	c
listen	c
to	c
writers	c
,	c
but	c
there	c
could	c
be	c
more	c
plays	c
and	c
films	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
really	c
a	c
reasonably-priced	i
weekend	c
for	c
me	c
,	c
but	c
you	c
should	c
also	c
recognise	i
new	c
activities	c
like	c
competitions	c
on	i
singing	c
songs	c
,	i
drawing	i
a	c
portrate	i
next	c
year	c
.	c

Thanks	c
for	c
everything	c
.	c

Yours	c
Sincerely	i
,	c

It	c
is	c
nice	c
to	c
hear	c
from	c
you	c
again	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
these	c
are	c
international	c
rules	c
which	c
help	c
things	c
to	c
go	i
in	c
order	c
.	c

Contrary	i
there	c
are	c
other	c
rules	c
which	c
annoy	c
us	c
like	c
the	c
clothing	i
ones	i
.	c

It	c
makes	c
us	c
like	c
robots	c
and	c
feel	i
bad	c
psychologically	c
,	c
because	c
we	c
want	c
to	c
be	c
different	c
and	c
free	c
in	c
wearing	i
.	c

They	c
do	c
n't	c
care	c
if	c
we	c
have	c
problems	c
,	c
exams	c
to	c
study	c
or	i
if	c
we	c
are	c
ill	c
.	c

At	c
homes	i
we	c
have	i
again	i
rules	c
,	c
but	c
more	c
flexible	c
ones	c
.	c

They	c
are	c
against	c
democracy	c
I	c
think	c
.	c

This	c
was	c
the	c
worst	c
night	c
that	c
I	c
had	c
during	c
my	c
stay	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

The	c
event	c
was	c
going	c
to	c
take	c
place	c
in	c
the	c
garden	c
of	i
Paula	c
's	c
house	c
.	c

Some	c
of	c
them	c
were	c
in	c
charge	c
of	c
bringing	c
music	c
.	c

Some	c
time	c
later	c
all	i
the	i
things	i
were	i
finally	c
prepared	c
.	c

The	c
garden	c
was	c
wonderful	c
.	c

The	c
children	c
were	c
very	c
enthusiastic	c
because	c
they	c
thought	c
that	c
Maria	c
was	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
very	c
happy	c
with	c
this	c
surprise	c
.	c

But	c
things	c
did	c
n't	c
happen	c
as	c
they	c
had	i
been	i
planned	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
happy	c
to	c
know	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
you	i
competition	c
.	c

If	c
the	c
answer	c
is	c
yes	c
,	c
could	c
you	c
tell	c
me	c
which	i
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
will	c
need	c
.	c

One	c
other	c
thing	c
,	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
useful	c
to	c
know	c
if	c
I	c
will	c
need	c
to	c
take	c
with	c
me	c
some	c
extra	c
money	c
.	c

programme	c
such	i
as	c
international	c
evenings	c
,	c

along	i
parties	c
and	c
indoor	c
games	c
.	c

By	c
filming	c
...	c

Ordinary	c
lessons	c
,	i
it	i
is	i
a	c
good	c
way	c
of	c
showing	c
the	c
relationship	c
between	c
students	c
and	c
teachers	c
.	c

Conclusion	c

I	c
would	c
recommend	c
the	c
lessons	c
and	c
activities	c
mentioned	c
above	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
make	c
the	c
video	c
in	c
question	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
this	c
programme	c
has	i
a	i
good	i
organisation	i
,	c
as	c
you	c
know	c
,	c
due	i
to	i
we	c
have	c
enough	c
time	c
to	c
visit	c
plenty	c
of	c
local	c
interest	c
points	c
.	c

.	c
.	c

we	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
.	c

In	c
this	c
way	c
,	c
we	c
can	c
go	c
to	c
visit	c
the	c
Science	c
Museum	c
earlier	c
in	c
the	c
morning	c
and	c
the	i
,	i
we	c
can	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

I	c
strongly	c
believe	c
that	c
we	c
will	c
be	c
at	i
the	i
right	i
time	i
and	i
best	i
city	i
to	c
appreciate	c
it	c
.	c

Oh	c
I	c
forgot	c
about	c
it	i
!	c

Besides	i
,	c
this	c
show	c
is	c
gree	i
(	c

Looking	c

to	c

FANCY	c
GETTING	c
TO	c
KNOW	c
THE	c
FUTURE	c
?	c

Do	c
you	c
think	c
you	c
've	c
the	i
future	c
in	c
your	c
hands	c
?	c

Would	c
you	c
like	c
living	i
in	c
a	c
modern	c
way	c
?	c

Well	c
,	c
you	c
can	c
look	c
at	c
your	c
house	c
.	c

Nowadays	c
,	c
we	c
have	c
all	c
kind	i
of	c
instruments	c
to	i
washing	c
up	c
the	c
dishes	c
,	c
to	i
cook	i
to	c
be	c
more	c
comfortable	i
,	c
for	c
example	c
the	i
TV	c
,	c
the	c
video	c
recorder	c
,	c
etc	c
.	c

Maybe	c
,	c
in	c
a	c
few	c
years	i
later	i
we	c
'll	c
have	c
a	c
bigger	c
TV	c
,	c
a	c
more	c
suitable	c
radio	c
but	c
,	c
from	i
my	i
point	i
of	i
view	i
,	c
I	c
think	c
these	c
facts	c
will	c
not	c
change	c
the	i
way	c
of	c
our	i
lifes	i
.	c

In	i
this	i
way	i
,	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
be	c
calm	c
because	c
as	i
you	c
know	c
the	i
things	c
are	c
developing	c
in	i
the	c
same	c
way	c
you'r	i
changing	c
,	c
too	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
we	c
have	c
the	c
future	c
in	c
our	c
hands	c
!	c

Think	c
about	c
it	c
.	c

It	c
contains	c
a	c
wide	c
range	c
of	c
activities	c
for	i
example	c
,	c
sightseeing	c
,	c
river	i
trip	c
,	c
visiting	c
science	i
museum	c
and	c
gallery	c
,	c
shopping	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
we	c
have	c
found	c
an	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
show	c
,	c
which	c
will	c
be	c
held	c
at	c
Central	c
Exhibition	c
Hall	c
on	c
14th	c
of	c
March	c
.	c

It	c
would	c
be	c
grateful	i
if	c
you	c
give	i
a	c
little	c
change	c
in	c
programme	i
so	c
that	c
we	c
are	c
able	c
to	c
attend	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c

Technical	c

's	c
way	c
of	c
life	c
has	c
considerably	i
been	i
changed	i
by	c
rapdily	i
developing	c
mordern	i
technology	c
.	c

To	c
begin	c
with	c
,	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
good	c
to	c
look	c
back	c
on	c
how	c
our	c
parents	c
have	c
lived	c
in	c
a	c
house	c
.	c

50	c
years	c
ago	c
,	c
Korean	c
mothers	c
should	c
have	c
made	c
a	c
fire	c
by	c
burning	c
woods	i
to	c
warm	c
a	c
room	c
up	c
and	c
make	c
food	c
.	c

Since	c
the	c
eletric	i
fire	c
and	c
microwave	c
oven	c
had	c
been	c
invented	c
,	c
their	c
life	i
have	c
been	c
far	c
easier	c
than	c
before	c

From	i
my	i
point	i
of	i
view	i
,	c
people	c
's	c
home	i
in	c
the	c
future	c
will	c
be	c
controlled	c
by	c
a	c
computer	c
which	c
is	c
devised	i
in	i
every	c
machine	c

TV	c

and	c
the	c
light	c

connecting	i

the	c

is	c
far	c
from	c
the	c
house	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
people	c
will	c
still	c
be	c
living	c
in	c
a	c
building	c
which	c
is	c
constructed	c
for	c
a	c
"	c
family	c
"	c

In	c
spite	c
of	c
the	c
computer	c
,	c
children	c
will	c
need	c

their	c

make	c

expressed	c
not	c

by	c

Computer	i
might	c
know	c
better	i

there	c

and	c
will	c
not	c
have	c

I	c
must	c
keep	c

How	c
have	c
you	c

OK	c

Here	c
we	c
go	c

I	c
enjoyed	c
helping	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
last	c
month	c

There	c
are	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c

I	c
conveyed	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
chairs	c
and	c
looked	c
after	c
the	c
que	i
or	c
people	c
who	c
lost	c
their	c
way	c
.	c

It	c
sounds	c
really	c
bad	c
but	c
I	c
enjoyed	c
this	c
pop	c
concert	c
to	c
my	c

I	c
know	c

Do	c
you	c
envy	c
me	c

The	c
concert	c
was	c
enthusiastic	i
and	c
even	c
made	c
me	c
ecstatic	c

His	c
voice	c
is	c
also	c
soulful	c
and	c
sometimes	c
even	c
gave	c

Sounds	c
good	c

does	c
n't	c
it	c

Bye	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c

We	c
think	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
a	c
very	c
interesting	c
trip	c
,	c
especially	c
the	c
sightseeing	c
by	c
bus	c
.	c

As	c
we	c
are	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
in	c
London	c
on	c
this	c
date	c
,	c
we	c
think	c
,	i
it	c
could	c
be	c
a	c
great	c
oppurtunity	i
for	c
us	c
to	c
go	c
there	c
because	c
we	c
are	c
very	c
interested	c
in	c
the	c

An	i
especiall	i
invitation	c

I	c
was	c
having	c
holidays	i
with	c
my	c
parents	c
and	c
some	c
friends	c
in	c
India	c
and	c
we	c
were	c
enjoying	c
talking	c
to	c
people	c
and	c
eating	c
the	c
local	c
food	c
.	c

One	c
day	c
we	c
were	c
invited	c
from	i
locals	i
to	c
visit	c
a	c
little	c
town	c
five	c
hours	c
away	c
from	c
New	c
Dehli	c
.	c

We	c
spent	c
2	c
weeks	c
with	c
the	c
family	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
was	c
the	c
water	c
.	c

My	c
mother	c
tried	c
to	c
get	c
a	c
doctor	c
,	c
but	c
they	c
said	c
there	c
was	c
no	c
one	c
.	c

Some	c
days	c
later	c
we	c
went	c
back	c
to	c
Dehli	c
and	c
having	i
being	i
to	c
the	c
doctor	c
and	c
having	c
again	c
bottled	i
water	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
feeling	c
healthy	c
again	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Ryan	c

Now	c
I	c
can	c
realize	c
one	c
of	c
my	c
dream	i
.	c

For	c
the	c
accommodation	c
I	c
prefer	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
some	c
problems	c
with	c
my	c
back	c
and	c
I	c
need	c
a	c
bed	c
to	c
sleep	c
in	c
.	c

I	c
can	c
do	c
two	c
activities	c
during	c
my	c
stay	c
at	c
the	c
camp	c
.	c

The	c
first	c
one	c
I	c
choose	i
is	c
swimming	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
a	c
good	c
level	c
in	i
swimming	c
and	c
I	c
have	i
done	i
some	c
competitions	c
last	c
year	c
which	c
I	c
have	i
won	i
.	c

For	c
the	c
second	c
activity	c
I	c
choose	i
photography	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
take	i
a	c
photography	c
course	c
the	i
last	c
two	c
years	c
so	c
I	c
am	c
able	c
to	c
do	i
some	c
beautiful	c
pictures	c
.	c

One	c
question	c
,	c
I	c
just	c
want	c
to	c
know	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
do	c
I	c
take	c
with	c
me	c
?	c

You	c
ca	c
n't	c
imagine	c
how	c
funny	i
it	c
was	c
!	c

I	c
really	c
enjoyed	c
to	i
serve	i
the	c
drinks	c
to	c
the	c
pop-stars	c
.	c

After	c
the	c
concert	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
clean	c
the	c
area	c
and	c
it	c
took	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
because	c
people	c
were	i
like	c
pigs	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
was	c
chatting	c
and	c
laughing	c
with	c
other	c
workers	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
can	i
have	c
the	c
chance	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
too	c
,	c
do	c
it	c
!	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
very	c
positive	c
experience	c
.	c

Write	c
me	i
soon	c
.	c

Love	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
providing	i
International	i
Arts	c
Festival	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
absolutely	i
great	c
idea	c
.	c

Thirdly	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
expecting	c
to	c
watch	c
more	c
films	c
and	c
plays	c
which	i
were	c
impressive	c
.	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
I	c
hope	c
the	c
festival	c
is	c
developed	i
next	c
year	c
with	c
excellent	c
reasonably-priced	c
ticket	i
like	c
this	c
year	c
's	c
.	c

Do	c
you	c
need	c
money	c
?	c

I	c
am	c
recommending	c
you	c
to	i
check	i
your	c
possible	c
time	c
to	c
work	c
-	c
weekdays	c
or	c
weekend	c
?	c
-	c
before	c
you	c
request	i
a	c
job	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
just	c
decide	c
to	c
work	c
,	c
you	c
'd	c
better	c
to	i
find	i
a	c
job	c
in	i
your	c
place	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
case	c
,	c
I	i
could	i
get	i
a	i
telephone	i
researcher	i
part	i
by	i
my	i
friend	i
's	i
reference	i
.	i

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
do	c
n't	c
forget	c
that	c
a	c
job	c
is	c
just	c
spent	i
in	c
your	c
"	c
spare	c
"	c
time	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
,	c

As	i
it	c
is	i
said	i
in	c
your	c
advertisement	c
,	i
the	c
show	c
is	i
starring	i
Danny	c
Brook	c
but	i
there	c
was	c
different	i
actor	c
.	i

The	c
show	c
had	i
to	c
start	c
at	c
19:30	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
.	c

You	c
promised	c
that	c
there	c
will	i
be	c
discounts	c
,	c
but	c
when	c
I	c
came	i
,	c
I	c
found	c
out	c
,	i
that	c
they	c
were	c
not	c
available	c
.	c

I	c
wanted	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
your	c
restaurant	c
.	c

Your	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

You	c
promised	c
that	c
if	c
we	c
go	i
to	c
your	c
show	c
we	c
will	i
have	c
a	c
perfect	c
evening	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

I	c
had	c
such	c
a	c
desire	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
disco	c
,	i
that	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
go	c
even	c
without	c
parent	i
's	i
permission	c
.	c

But	c
she	c
told	c
it	c
to	c
very	i
kid	c
in	c
school	c
,	c
even	c
the	c
teachers	c
heard	c
it	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
the	c
concert	c
hall	c
is	c
too	c
small	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
great	c
concert	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
should	i
be	c
bigger	c
for	c
jazz	c
,	c
rock	c
or	c
still	i
classical	c
concerts	c
.	c

-	c
Dance	c
shows	c
after	c
dinner	c
to	c
have	i
something	c
interesting	c
to	c
do	c
in	c
the	c
night	c
,	i

You	c
must	c
to	i
be	i
organise	i
,	c
clean	c
and	c
respect	c
the	c
right	i
of	c
other	c
people.	c
.	i

That	c
made	c
me	c
feel	c
disappointed	c
.	c

It	c
should	c
be	c
on	c
time	c
at	c
19:30	c
.	c

Lastly	c
,	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
think	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
my	c
perfect	c
evening	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

She	c
has	i
just	i
learnt	i
with	c
us	c
for	c
three	c
weeks	c
.	c

As	c
far	c
as	c
we	c
knew	c
,	c
she	i
's	i
good	c
at	c
cooking	c
.	c

While	c
she	c
was	c
choosing	c
vegetables	c
in	i
a	c
market	c
,	c
she	c
came	c
across	c
him	c
.	c

When	c
he	c
asked	c
her	c
'	i
why	i
do	c
you	c
choose	c
deliberately	i
?	c
'	c
,	c
she	c
answered	c
without	c
thinking	c
.	c

We	c
did	c
n't	c
blame	c
her	c
,	c
because	c
we	c
knew	c
that	c
she	c
did	c
n't	c
intend	c
to	c
do	i
like	c
that	c
.	c

Secondly	c
I	i
really	c
enjoyed	c
the	c
jazz	c
and	c
classical	c
concerts	c
in	c
spite	c
of	c
the	c
fact	c
that	c
some	c
of	c
them	c
were	i
taken	i
place	c
in	c
too	c
small	c
concert	c
halls	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
hearing	i
from	c
you	c
.	c

Sorry	c
it	c
's	c
been	c
too	c
long	c
since	c
I	c
last	c
wrote	c
but	c
I	c
've	c
been	c
so	c
busy	c
at	c
school	c
that	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
answer	c
you	c
before	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
tell	i
me	c
in	c
your	c
last	c
letter	c
you	i
were	c
talking	c
about	c
rules	c
in	c
your	c
class	c
and	c
you	c
want	i
to	c
know	c
about	c
school	c
rules	c
in	c
my	c
country	c
and	c
also	c
what	c
I	c
am	c
allowed	c
to	c
do	c
at	c
home	c
.	c

We	c
are	c
n't	c
allowed	c
to	c
eat	c
in	c
the	c
classrooms	c
and	c
in	c
addition	c
to	c
this	c
we	c
must	c
sit	c
down	c
in	i
individual	c
desks	c
.	c

How	c
boring	c
!	c

Granny	c
is	c
the	c
problem	c
she	i
's	c
a	c
bit	c
bossy	c
!	c

I	c
really	c
must	c
get	c
down	c
to	c
some	c
homework	c
now	c
so	c
I	c
'll	c
stop	c
here	c
.	c

Give	c
my	c
love	c
to	c
your	c
parents	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
as	c
a	c
representative	c
of	c
the	c
class	c
about	c
the	c
3-day	c
school	c
trip	c
which	c
has	c
been	c
organized	c
for	c
next	c
week	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
the	c
excellent	c
organization	c
of	c
this	c
trip	c
which	c
seems	c
to	c
be	c
very	c
interesting	c
and	c
useful	c
for	c
the	c
students	c
.	c

All	c
the	c
students	c
are	c
enthusiastic	c
about	c
it	c
.	c

Under	i
the	i
circumstances	i
,	c
I	c
was	c
asked	c
by	c
the	c
class	c
to	c
inform	c
you	c
about	c
the	c
show	c
and	c
to	c
ask	c
if	c
it	c
could	i
be	c
possible	c
to	c
make	c
some	c
changes	c
in	i
the	c
programme	c
if	c
it	c
could	i
to	i
visit	i
the	c
Exhibition	i
.	c

It	c
will	c
take	c
place	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
from	c
10.00am	c
to	c
19.00pm	i
,	c
so	c
we	c
could	c
give	c
up	c
the	i
shopping	c
and	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
show	c
in	c
the	c
afternoon	c
.	c

Being	c
famous	i
and	i
risk	i
is	c
something	c
all	c
of	c
us	c
have	c
dreamt	c
of	c
sometimes	i
.	c

Competition	c
Organiser	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
student	c
and	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
.	c

Because	i
I	c
intend	c
to	c
take	c
examination	i
in	c
Septenber	i
.	c

So	c
I	c
can	c
afford	c
to	c
go	c
on	c
holiday	c
only	c
in	c
July	c
.	c

It	c
will	c
be	c
my	c
first	c
time	c
to	i
experience	i
to	i
stay	i
there	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
interested	c
in	c
trying	c
new	c
things	c
which	c
I	c
have	c
not	c
tried	c
.	c

Actually	c
,	c
I	c
used	c
to	c
play	c
basketball	c
for	c
6	c
years	c
and	c
am	c
quite	c
confident	c
of	i
it	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

You	c
might	c
not	c
believe	c
but	i
actually	c
I	c
helped	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
last	c
month	c
and	c
I	c
really	c
enjoyed	c
it	c
so	c
much	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
'm	c
now	c
writing	c
to	c
let	c
you	c
know	c
how	c
grateful	i
it	c
was	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
asked	c
if	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
sit	c
down	c
in	c
front	c
of	c
stage	i
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
suggest	c
you	c
should	c
try	c
as	c
I	c
did	c
if	c
you	c
have	c
any	c
opportunity	c
.	c

You	c
must	i
like	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
seeing	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

Latest	i
fashions	c
,	c
leisure	c
and	c
sports	c
wear	c
,	c
make	i
up	i
and	c
hairstyles	c
are	c
expected	c
to	c
be	c
displayed	c
and	c
studied	c
.	c

We	c
hope	c
that	c
you	c
consider	c
our	c
suggestion	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerily	i
,	c

People	c
always	c
need	c
their	c
parents	c
,	c
children	c
and	c
so	c
on	c
.	c

New	c
materials	c
will	c
surly	i
change	c
the	c
home	c
of	c
the	c
future	c
in	c
any	i
ways	c
.	c

It	i
is	i
just	i
staff	i
's	i
around	i
us	i
improving	i
and	i
turning	i
into	i
new	i
one	i
.	i

Hopefully	c
,	c
the	c
minds	c
of	c
people	c
will	c
stay	c
peaceful	c
and	c
tender	i
in	c
the	c
future	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
surprised	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
because	c
I	c
like	c
camping	c
very	c
much	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
's	c
more	c
exciting	c
to	c
be	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
than	c
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
surprised	c
that	c
you	c
offer	c
such	c
a	c
great	c
variety	c
of	c
sports	c
and	c
courses	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
do	c
Basketball	c
and	c
Painting	c
.	c

I	c
paint	c
a	c
lot	c
in	c
my	c
free	c
time	c
.	c

I	c
prefer	c
painting	c
landscapes	c
and	c
fantasy-pictures	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
,	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
will	c
we	c
need	c
?	c

I	c
hope	c
to	c
hear	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
first	c
of	c
all	c
we	c
should	c
film	c
an	c
english	i
lesson	c
,	c
where	c
pupils	c
could	c
prepare	c
some	c
group	c
work	c
or	c
information-boards	i
.	c

It	c
would	c
be	c
also	c
very	c
interesting	c
to	c
film	c
the	c
situation	c
during	c
the	c
brake	i
.	c

The	c
smokers	c
in	c
the	c
school	c
yard	c
,	c
the	c
buffett	i
and	c
the	c
other	c
pupils	c
,	c
who	c
are	c
sitting	c
in	i
front	i
of	i
their	c
tables	c
writing	i
their	c
homework	c
.	c

It	c
would	c
be	c
funny	c
to	c
present	i
the	c
computers	c
,	c
which	c
are	c
often	c
overcharged	i
,	c
or	i
often	c
the	c
netserver	i
is	i
spinning	i
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
would	c
be	c
all	c
for	c
our	c
video	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
this	i
are	c
the	c
most	c
interesting	c
things	c
in	c
our	c
school	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
your	c
entertainment	i
which	c
was	c
advertised	c
in	c
the	c
last	c
edition	c
of	c
"	c
Plays	c
"	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
afraid	c
that	c
reality	c
had	c
nothing	c
common	c
with	c
the	c
things	c
I	c
suspected	i
to	c
meet	i
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
the	c
prices	c
were	c
n't	c
lower	i
in	i
any	i
cases	i
although	i
you	i
advertised	i
the	i
information	i
like	i
that	i

Yours	c

to	c
buy	c
something	c
extraordinary	c
,	c
feel	c
comfortable	c
and	c
stand	c
out	c
.	c

People	c
look	c
for	c
something	c
new	c
but	c
it	c
is	c
not	c
so	c
easy	c
to	c
be	c
creative	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
.	c

That	c
's	c
why	c
I	c
believe	c
in	c
the	c
solution	c
which	c
is	c
the	c
closest	c
to	c
human	c
nature	c
and	c
can	c
help	c
us	c
to	c
omit	i
the	i
boredome	i
I	i
am	c
sure	c
that	c
at	i
last	i
we	c
will	c
take	c
off	c
our	c
clothes	c
and	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
we	c
will	c
be	c
undressed	c
and	c
free	i
there	i
wo	c
n't	c
be	c
any	c
problem	c
with	c
being	c
up-do-date	c
.	c

As	c
it	i
was	c
previously	c
stated	c
I	i
am	c
convinced	c
that	c
the	c
reality	c
will	c
turn	c
out	c
to	c
be	c
a	c
paradise	c
where	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
will	i
be	c
body	i
and	c
purity	i
of	c
our	c
soul	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
in	c
connection	c
with	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
I	c
saw	c
in	c
your	c
theatre	c
a	c
week	c
ago	c
.	c

Although	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
be	c
the	i
London	c
's	c
newest	c
and	c
best	c
musical	c
show	c
,	c
I	c
am	i
rather	c
disappointed	c
with	c
it	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
you	c
changed	c
actors	c
without	c
informing	c
viewers	i
.	c

As	c
if	c
this	c
were	c
not	c
enough	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
forty	i
five	i
minutes	c
late	c
.	c

Your	c
leaflet	c
was	c
rather	c
misleading	c
on	c
this	c
subject	c
.	c

According	c
to	c
your	c
leaflet	c
,	c
tickets	c
were	c
supposed	c
to	c
be	c
a	c
bit	c
cheaper	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
was	c
refused	c
being	i
given	i
a	c
discount	c
.	c

On	c
top	c
of	c
everything	c
,	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

Thanks	c
to	c
computers	c
,	c
phones	c
,	c
mobile	c
phones	c
,	c
internet	i
I	c
can	c
communicate	c
with	c
other	c
people	c
faster	c
than	c
I	c
was	c
able	c
to	c
do	i
before	c
.	c

But	c
thanks	c
to	c
mobile	c
phone	i
I	c
can	c
contact	c
him	c
even	c
if	c
he	c
is	c
sailing	c
in	c
the	c
Atlantic	c
Ocean	c
.	c

I	c
also	c
enjoy	c
shopping	c
through	i
internet	i
.	c

This	c
way	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
to	c
do	i
be	c
queuing	c
in	c
shops	c
and	c
supermarkets	c
and	c
I	c
can	c
choose	c
fashionable	c
clothes	c
.	c

Nowadays	c
,	c
modern	c
technology	c
is	c
used	c
in	c
medicine	c
more	c
often	c
and	c
it	c
can	c
minimise	c
the	c
risk	c
of	c
the	c
death	c
of	c
the	c
patients	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
spend	c
too	c
much	c
time	c
indoors	c
playing	c
computer	i
or	c
watching	c
TV	c
.	c

Although	c
modern	c
progress	c
has	c
made	c
our	c
life	c
easier	c
,	c
it	c
may	c
be	i
also	i
harmful	c
.	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
answer	c
all	c
the	c
questions	c
that	c
you	c
made	i
me	c
in	c
your	c
last	c
letter	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
giving	c
me	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
travel	c
only	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
the	c
only	c
month	c
when	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
school	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
because	c
as	i
I	c
had	i
never	c
slept	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
,	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
new	c
experience	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

The	c
two	c
activities	c
that	c
I	c
choose	c
are	c
:	c
basketball	c
and	c
climbing	c
.	c

By	i
the	i
other	i
side	i
,	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
climbed	c
a	c
mountain	c
but	c
I	c
always	c
wanted	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
very	c
good	c
experience	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
going	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
all	c
about	c
it	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
sell	c
tickets	c
for	c
the	c
concert	c
in	c
the	c
street	c
.	c

As	c
I	c
sold	c
all	c
the	c
tickets	c
that	c
the	c
organisers	c
gave	c
me	c
,	c
I	c
won	c
a	c
prize	c
of	c
ten	c
pounds	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
angry	c
because	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
watch	c
the	c
artists	c
performing	c
their	c
songs	c
.	c

Looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c

My	c
name	c
is	c
.	c

and	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
student	c
representative	c
.	c

I	c
read	c
it	c
and	c
found	c
it	c
very	c
good	c
,	c
specially	i
,	i
Science	i
Museum	c
and	c
National	c
Art	c
Gallery	c
as	c
I	c
am	c
interested	c
in	c
arts	c
.	c

I	c
thing	i
it	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
for	c
us	c
,	c
as	c
it	c
is	c
at	c
the	c
time	c
of	c
our	c
being	c
in	c
London	c
and	c
is	c
free	c
of	c
charge	c
for	c
students	c
.	c

Home	c
is	c
an	c
important	c
element	c
in	c
everybody	c
's	c
life	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
not	c
know	c
people	c
who	c
would	c
not	c
want	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
home	c
.	c

We	c
like	c
our	c
houses	c
that	i
is	c
why	c
are	i
always	c
trying	c
to	c
make	c
it	i
more	c
comfortable	c
and	c
useful	i
.	c

More	c
houses	c
will	c
have	c
gardens	c
what	i
will	c
make	c
us	c
feel	c
closer	c
to	c
the	i
nature	c
.	c

Because	c
of	c
computers	c
we	i
will	c
have	c
the	c
possibility	c
of	c
working	c
at	c
home	c
,	c
therefore	c
,	c
home	c
will	c
be	c
very	i
important	c
place	c
worth	c
paying	c
attention	c
.	i

Finally	c
what	i
kind	c
of	c
wheather	i
is	c
waiting	c
for	c
us	c
?	c

Secondly	c
,	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
it	c
was	i
written	i
that	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
to	c
start	c
at	c
19:30	c
.	c

Thirdly	c
,	c
it	c
was	i
written	i
that	c
discounts	c
were	c
available	c
but	c
we	c
were	c
again	c
frustrated	c
,	c
seing	i
they	c
were	c
not	c
available	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
can	c
see	c
,	c
most	c
of	c
the	c
offered	i
activities	i
in	c
the	c
advertisements	c
were	c
not	c
provided	c
.	c

We	c
did	c
not	c
have	c
"	c
a	c
perfect	c
evening	c
"	c
as	c
it	c
was	i
written	i
,	c
actually	c
we	c
had	c
an	c
evening	c
full	c
of	c
the	c
theatre	c
's	c
mistakes	c
and	c
were	c
extremely	c
disappointed	c
.	c

We	c
live	c
in	c
a	c
technologically	c
well-developed	c
world	c
,	c
having	c
every	c
opportunity	c
for	c
communication	c
,	c
education	c
and	c
entertainment	c
.	c

Almost	c
everyone	c
has	c
televisions	c
,	c
computers	c
and	c
electronic	c
devices	c
.	c

But	c
how	c
has	c
modern	c
technology	c
changed	c
our	c
lives	c
?	c

I	c
go	c
to	c
school	c
by	c
underground	c
.	c

There	c
is	c
no	c
sentence	c
without	c
electronic	c
devices	c
.	c

I	c
wonder	c
what	c
I	c
could	c
do	c
without	c
them	c
...	c

Modern	c
technology	c
has	c
changed	c
my	c
life	c
completely	c
.	c

Dear	c
Ms.	c
Jane	c
Clark	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
give	c
my	c
opinion	c
about	c
the	c
International	c
Arts	c
Festival	c
which	c
was	c
held	c
21st	i
and	c
22nd	c
November	c
.	c

I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
rock	c
concert	c
by	c
U2	c
and	c
the	i
Chinese	c
film	c
"	c
Chung	c
King	c
Express	c
"	c
.	c

Both	c
of	c
them	c
were	c
not	c
only	c
really	c
enjoyable	c
,	c
but	c
also	c
reasonably-priced	i
.	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
feel	c
that	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
even	c
better	c
if	c
there	c
were	c
some	c
improvement	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
greater	i
if	c
there	c
were	c
more	c
famous	c
people	c
who	i
have	i
various	c
nationalities	c
.	c

Because	c
most	c
of	c
them	c
were	c
from	c
English	i
speaking	i
country	i
this	c
year	c
.	c

Money	c
-	c
has	c
n't	c
it	c
always	c
been	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
problem	i
for	c
students	c
?	c

How	c
about	c
working	c
as	c
a	c
waiter	c
or	c
waitress	c
?	c

It	c
would	c
be	c
great	c
fan	i
to	c
make	c
friends	c
outside	c
your	c
class	c
or	c
club	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
say	c
that	c
the	c
wage	c
is	c
far	c
from	c
satisfaction	i
,	c
why	c
do	c
n't	c
you	c
teach	c
younger	c
students	c
as	c
a	c
private	c
teacher	c
.	c

Stop	c
complaining	c
about	c
lack	i
of	c
money	c
and	c
let	c
's	c
start	c
working	c
to	c
have	i
a	c
new	c
world	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
really	c
suprised	i
when	c
I	c
opened	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
only	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
my	c
family	c
is	c
going	c
to	c
visit	c
me	c
on	i
August	c
and	c
I	c
will	c
have	c
to	c
look	c
after	c
them	c
.	c

I	c
prefer	c
staying	c
in	c
tens	i
to	c
staying	c
in	c
log	c
cabins	c
.	c

I	c
used	c
to	c
going	i
with	c
my	c
friends	c
to	c
the	i
camp	c
,	c
wich	i
was	c
situeded	i
on	i
a	i
seaside	c
.	c

Never	c
had	c
I	c
got	i
such	c
a	c
great	c
time	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
taken	c
part	c
in	c
any	c
competitions	c
connected	c
with	c
this	c
sport	c
.	c

For	c
me	c
it	c
is	c
only	c
a	c
hobby	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
what	c
kinds	c
of	c
clothes	c
should	i
I	i
take	c
with	c
me	c
.	i

and	c
I	c
wonder	c
if	c
prizes	i
are	c
high	c
there	c
.	c

Most	c
people	c
think	c
that	c
if	c
they	c
have	c
got	c
money	c
they	c
will	c
buy	c
everything	c
what	i
they	c
want	c
.	c

Nowdays	i
we	c
have	c
many	c
big	c
shopping	c
centers	i
.	c

The	c
most	c
suitable	c
time	c
for	c
shopping	c
is	c
weekand	i
when	c
parents	c
do	c
n't	c
work	c
and	c
children	c
have	c
n't	c
got	c
a	i
school	c
.	c

You	c
ca	c
n't	c
buy	c
something	c
in	c
peacful	i
and	c
calm	c
athmospher	i
.	c

In	c
addition	c
in	i
such	i
kind	c
of	c
shops	c
prizes	i
are	c
very	c
high	c
,	c
of	c
course	c
not	c
all	c
of	c
them	c
.	c

However	c
such	c
centers	i
are	c
very	c
useful	c
and	c
necessary	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
really	c
exhausting	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
in	i
the	i
name	i
of	i
the	c
class	c
for	c
your	c
good	i
organisation	i
and	c
programme	c
,	c
Especially	i
for	c
the	c
fact	c
that	c
you	c
are	c
giving	c
us	c
some	c
free	c
time	c
.	c

The	c
show	c
is	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
the	c
14th	c
of	c
March	c
,	c
from	c
10	i
oo	i
to	i
19	i
oo	i
o'clock	i
in	c
the	c
Central	c
Exhibition	c
Hall	c
.	c

Instead	c
of	c
visiting	c
the	c
Science	c
Museum	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
we	c
could	c
go	c
there	c
on	c
Wednesday	c
afternoon	c
and	c
instead	c
of	c
going	c
shopping	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
afternoon	c
we	c
could	c
maybe	c
stop	c
at	c
some	c
places	c
during	c
the	c
sightseeing	c
tour	c
and	c
buy	c
there	i
something	i
.	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
this	c
is	c
a	c
really	c
great	c
opportunity	c
for	c
us	c
and	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
think	c
that	c
the	c
changes	c
are	c
so	c
big	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

As	c
well	c
as	c
this	c
he	c
needs	c
his	c
own	c
free	c
space	c
and	c
privacy	c
.	c

This	c
is	c
also	c
important	i
to	c
him	c
as	c
friendship	c
and	c
family	c

The	c
newspapers	c
print	c
everything	c
about	c
them	c
.	c

The	c
photographers	c
are	c
chasing	c
these	c
people	c
,	i
just	c
to	c
take	c
a	c
picture	c
of	c
them	c
on	i
how	c
they	c
eat	c
or	c
with	c
who	i
the	i
meat	i
.	c

Everything	c
in	c
life	c
has	c
a	c
price	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
give	c
up	c
something	c
for	i
getting	i
something	c
else	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
the	c
press	c
should	c
n't	c
create	c
rumours	c
and	c
hunt	c
those	c
people	c
like	c
animals	c
.	c

They	c
wanted	c
to	c
be	c
famous	c
and	c
the	i
had	i
known	i
the	c
price	c
before	i
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
!	c

I	c
could	c
n't	c
go	c
to	c
have	i
a	i
refreshment	c
because	i
of	i
two	c
reasons	c
,	c
the	c
first	c
one	c
is	c
that	c
there	c
was	c
no	c
information	c
how	i
much	i
time	i
the	c
start	c
of	c
the	c
show	c
is	i
going	c
to	c
be	c
late	c
.	i

The	c
second	c
reason	c
is	c
that	c
the	c
restaurant	i
of	i
the	i
theatre	i
was	c
closed	c
because	i
of	i
building	i
plans	i
for	i
the	i
next	i
two	i
month	i
.	c

On	c
your	c
ticket	i
information	c
is	c
written	c
out	i
that	c
discounts	c
are	c
available	c
,	c
when	c
I	c
ask	i
at	c
the	c
ticket	c
reception	i
I	c
could	c
n't	c
get	c
any	c
discount	c
for	c
beeng	i
student	i
.	c

To	c
make	i
an	i
result	i
the	c
evening	c
in	c
your	c
theatre	c
and	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
very	c
disappointing	c
and	c
not	c
like	c
promised	i
.	c

Miss.	c
Winkler	c

"	c
Sarah	c
has	c
won	c
in	c
a	c
quiz	c
show	c
?	c
"	c

But	c
Pat	c
made	c
a	c
promise	c
not	c
to	c
tell	c

Dear	c
Mrs.	c
Ryan	c
,	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
I	c
will	c
try	c
to	c
answer	c
your	c
questions	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
long	i
cabins	i
and	c
I	c
hope	c
that	c
then	c
I	c
will	c
have	c
enough	c
place	i
for	c
all	c
the	c
things	c
I	c
will	c
carry	i
with	c
me	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
nice	c
to	c
hear	c
from	c
you	c
recently	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
about	c
my	c
work	c
at	c
the	c
pop	c
concert	c
.	c

I	c
went	c
there	c
a	i
10	c
o'clock	c
in	c
the	c
morning	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
really	c
hard	c
work	c
.	c

At	c
this	c
time	i
I	c
promised	c
that	i
I	c
would	c
never	c
do	c
this	c
awful	c
job	c
again	c
.	c

Give	c
my	c
regards	c
to	c
your	c
family	c
.	c

Best	c
wishes	c
,	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Clark	c
,	c

Most	c
of	c
the	c
events	c
were	c
wonderful	c
and	c
well-organised	i
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
the	c
stars	c
and	c
artists	c
were	c
only	i
from	i
six	c
countries	c
,	i
In	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
if	c
you	c
can	c
invite	c
more	c
stars	c
and	c
artists	c
from	c
more	c
countries	c
,	c
it	c
will	c
make	c
the	c
festival	c
more	c
exciting	c
,	c
more	c
intesting	i
,	c
and	c
from	i
my	i
point	i
of	i
view	i
,	c
some	c
concert	i
halls	c
were	c
too	c
small	c
,	i
the	i
people	c
in	c
there	c
could	c
n't	c
even	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
loo	c
!	i
because	c
it	c
was	c
too	c
crowed	i
.	c

If	c
you	c
can	c
show	i
more	c
play	i
and	c
films	c
It	i
will	c
achieve	i
a	c
good	c
effect	c

Dear	c
Yasmin	c
,	c

It	i
was	c
really	c
pleased	c
to	c
receive	c
your	c
letter	c
yesterday	c
,	i
you	i
asked	c
me	c
about	c
rules	c
;	i
both	c
at	i
my	c
home	c
and	c
at	c
my	c
school	c
,	i
I	c
am	c
very	c
happy	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
about	c
this	c
.	c

At	c
my	c
home	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
many	c
rules	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
'm	c
careless	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
am	i
n't	i
allowed	c
to	c
smoke	c
at	c
home	c
as	i
well	i
:	c
and	c
I	c
'm	c
not	c
allowed	c
to	c
use	c
telephone	i
,	c
because	c
last	c
year	c
I	c
made	i
£	i
1000	c
bill	c
for	c
one	c
month	c
,	i
my	i
parents	c
were	c
very	c
angry	c
with	c
it	i
,	c
so	c
they	c
told	c
me	c
I	c
am	c
not	c
to	c
use	c
telephone	i
any	c
more	c
,	i
oh	i
,	c
How	i
poor	i
!	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
make	c
a	c
complain	i
about	c
your	c
theatre	c
and	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
,,Over	i
the	c
rainbow	i
"	c
.	c

According	c
to	c
the	c
advertisement	c
,	c
discounts	c
should	c
be	i
available	c
,	i
but	c
,	c
in	c
fact	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
refused	c
to	i
take	i
the	i
payment	i
for	i
tickets	i
in	i
this	i
way	i
.	c

It	c
was	c
very	c
uncamfortable	i
for	c
me	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
to	c
this	c
,	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
too	c
late	c
(	c
the	c
show	c
did	c
not	c
start	c
on	c
time	c
)	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
have	c
understood	i
this	c
if	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
had	c
been	c
marvellous	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
even	c
quite	c
interesting	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
you	c
to	c
return	c
my	c
money	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

She	c
was	c
25-years-old	i
secretary	c
in	c
one	i
big	c
company	c
.	c

Her	c
boss	c
was	c
rich	i
man	c
,	c
really	c
rich	c
.	c

He	c
was	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
most	c
famous	c
person	i
in	c
his	i
city	c
,	c
but	c
he	c
was	c
n't	c
honest	c
with	c
his	c
clients	c
.	c

Pat	c
had	c
worked	c
for	c
him	c
for	c
two	c
years	c
.	c

Certainly	c
she	c
knew	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
secrets	c
.	c

Timson	c
was	c
really	c
shocked	c
!	c

He	c
even	i
could	i
n't	i
say	c
a	c
word	c
.	c

Of	c
course	c
,	c
only	c
one	c
person	c
had	i
known	i
this	c
except	i
his	c
best	c
friends	c
.	c

Timson	c
had	c
a	c
row	c
at	c
home	c
and	c
also	c
needed	c
new	i
secretary	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
the	c
worst	c
weekends	i
in	i
a	i
last	c
few	c
years	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
/	c
Madame	i
,	c

Because	c
this	i
situation	c
I	c
be	i
very	c
busy	c
on	i
the	c
first	c
week	c
of	c
july	i
,	c
and	c
I	c
apreciate	i
if	i
you	c
can	i
give	c
me	c
the	c
choice	i
to	c
start	i
my	c
"	c
Camp	c
California	c
"	c
from	i
July	c
10th	c
.	c

About	c
the	c
Accomodation	i
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
sleep	c
on	i
the	i
tents	i
,	c
because	c
I	c
never	i
been	i
in	c
one	c
,	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
lot	c
more	c
fun	c
than	c
log	c
cabins	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
child	c
I	c
never	c
like	i
to	c
go	c
shopping	c
because	c
my	c
Mum	c
spend	i
so	c
much	c
time	c
on	i
the	c
shops	c
that	c
I	c
remember	c
going	i
shopping	c
with	c
her	c
,	i
was	c
a	c
nigthmare	i
.	c

It	c
is	c
ameaising	i
how	c
people	c
change	c
during	i
the	i
years	i
,	i
for	i
example	i
now	c
shopping	c
for	c
me	c
is	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
most	c
entertaining	c
things	c
,	c
and	c
every	c
week	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
buy	c
something	c
.	c

I	c
enjoy	c
so	i
much	i
fashion	i
that	c
my	c
life	c
change	i
completely	c
since	c
I	c
start	i
to	c
study	c
clothes	i
designer	i
and	c
I	c
discover	i
that	c
fabrics	c
,	c
colors	i
,	c
are	c
really	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
tents	i
rather	c
than	c
in	c
log	i
cabins	i
,	c
because	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
new	c
experience	c
for	c
me	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
try	c
something	c
different	c
.	c

Moreover	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
are	c
the	c
best	c
for	c
living	c
in	c
the	c
camp	c
and	c
if	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
bring	c
with	c
me	c
a	c
large	c
amount	c
of	c
money	c
.	c

I	c
want	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
this	c
prize	c
,	i
let	i
me	c
know	c
if	c
you	c
need	c
further	c
information	c

Last	c
week	c
I	c
was	c
in	c
London	c
with	c
my	c
friends	c
and	c
we	c
decided	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
to	c
see	c
how	i
the	c
famous	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
act	c
.	c

No	i
only	c
:	i
we	c
had	c
the	c
bad	c
surprise	c
that	c
Brook	c
had	c
been	c
substituded	i
by	c
another	c
actor	c
!	c

I	c
ask	c
you	c
if	c
is	i
it	i
possible	c
to	c
have	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
,	c
please	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
want	c

expense	c

of	c
the	c
airplane	i

of	c
the	c

of	c
the	c
car	c
,	c
have	c
reduced	c
the	c
distances	c
of	c
the	c

,	c
so	c
we	c
can	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
other	c
side	c
of	c
the	c
world	c
in	c
half	c
a	c
day	c
.	c

It	c
means	c
that	c
daily	c
life	c
is	c
faster	c
and	c
busier	c
because	c
I	c
'm	c
able	c
to	c
go	c
to	c

in	c
the	c
morning	c
and	c
then	c
to	c
play	c
soccer	c
in	c

and	c
after	i

I	c
can	c
stay	i
in	i

side	c
of	c
Lecce	c
to	c
play	c
piano	c
with	c
my	c
musical	i

then	c
I	c
can	c

Dear	c
Manager	c
,	c

She	i
is	c
my	c
famous	i
artist	c
and	c
I	c
was	i
coming	i
there	c
mainly	c
because	c
of	c
him	c
.	c

If	i
this	i
made	c
me	c
really	c
disappointed	c
-	c
he	c
was	c
n't	c
playing	i
there	c
.	c

Another	c
point	c
,	i
I	c
want	c
you	c
to	c
consider	c
,	i
is	c
restaurant	i
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
you	c
have	i
advertised	i
,	i
I	c
would	c
have	c
perfect	i
evening	c
out	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

It	c
's	c
a	c
REALITY	c
,	c
its	i
the	c
FASHION	c
OF	c
THE	c
FUTURE	c
...	c

Their	c
clothes	c
were	c
always	c
strictly	c
connected	c
with	c
their	c
lifestyle	c
,	c
climate	c
and	c
money	c
.	c

I	c
say	i
it	i
to	i
you	c
-	c
black	c
and	c
grey	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
,	i
there	c
will	c
be	c
times	c
,	i
when	c
women	c
would	i
like	c
to	i
be	i
again	i
thought	c
as	i
delicate	c
and	c
sensible	i
human	c
beings	c
.	c

Showing	c
their	c
figure	c
,	c
they	c
would	c
have	c
possibility	i
to	c
show	c
their	c
sexuality	c
.	c

But	c
,	c
do	c
n't	c
forget	c
,	c
any	i
exhibitionism	c
!	c

And	c
it	i
will	c
be	c
the	i
past	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
are	c
you	c
interested	c
in	c
that	c
style	c
?	c

Do	c
you	c
agree	c
with	c
me	c
?	c

Recently	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
week	c
's	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
and	c
during	c
my	c
stay	c
,	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
your	c
theatre	c
to	c
see	c
"	c
Over	c
The	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
really	c
disillusioned	i
.	c

In	c
the	c
advertisement	c
,	c
it	c
was	i
told	i
that	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
was	c
starring	c
,	c
but	c
in	c
place	c
of	c
him	c
there	c
was	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
and	c
he	c
was	c
really	c
dissapointing	i
.	c

I	c
could	c
not	c
see	c
any	c
portion	c
of	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
's	c
performance	c
at	i
him	c
.	c

Also	c
,	c
in	c
the	c
schedule	i
,	c
the	c
time	c
of	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
written	c
as	c
19:30	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
20;15	i
and	c
,	i
I	c
missed	c
the	c
dinner	c
I	c
was	c
going	c
to	c
have	c
with	c
my	c
best	c
friend	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

Since	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
student	c
and	c
not	c
as	c
rich	c
as	c
Bill	c
gates	i
,	c
I	c
was	c
short	c
of	c
money	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
pleased	c
to	c
hear	c
that	c
there	c
were	c
discounts	c
available	c
for	c
the	c
tickets	c
;	c
but	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
give	c
the	c
exact	i
price	c
of	c
the	c
ticket	c
,	c
which	c
I	c
consider	c
as	i
a	i
fault	c
of	c
your	c
theatre	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
can	c
understand	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
dreadful	c
time	c
and	c
I	c
went	i
my	c
money	c
back	c
as	c
a	c
solace	i
for	c
the	c
dissapointment	i
I	c
had	c
.	c

MY	c
DAILY	c
LIFE	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
go	c
far	c
away	c
from	c
my	c
family	c
and	c
other	c
people	c
and	c
have	c
virtual	c
relationships	c
.	c

Until	c
1996	c
,	c
I	c
used	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
school	c
on	c
foot	c
or	c
by	c
public	c
bus	c
;	c
but	c
since	c
1996	c
;	c
I	c
take	c
the	c
underground	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
school	c
.	c

on	i
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
because	c
of	c
dealing	i
with	i
computers	c
so	c
much	c
,	c
I	c
can	i
not	i
see	c
my	c
family	c
and	c
friends	c
very	c
much	c
,	c
even	c
when	c
we	c
are	c
at	i
the	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
some	c
proposals	c
about	i
its	c
improving	i
next	c
year	c
.	c

The	i
second	i
my	i
proposition	c
is	c
about	c
classic	i
concerts	c
.	c

This	c
year	c
I	c
noticed	c
that	c
there	c
were	c
only	c
few	i
plays	c
and	c
films	c
.	c

I	c
support	c
this	c
idea	c
which	c
is	c
convinient	i
both	c
for	c
people	i
and	c
organisators	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
for	i
this	i
festival	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

Dear	c
Ana	c
,	c

I	c
'm	c
really	c
fed	c
up	c
with	c
our	c
school	c
forne	i
!	c

It	c
is	c
awfull	i
!	c

That	c
's	c
why	c
our	c
headmaster	c
is	c
really	c
angry	c
.	c

Off	i
course	c
,	c
if	c
we	c
had	c
such	i
pretty	c
forne	i
like	c
yours	c
,	c
we	c
would	c
wear	c
it	c
with	c
pleasure	c
.	c

What	c
should	c
I	c
say	c
you	i
about	c
home	c
...	c

Kisses	c
to	c
your	c
family	c
,	c

During	c
my	c
stay	c
in	c
London	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
see	c
a	c
musical	c
show	c
called	c
"	c
OVER	c
THE	c
RAINBOW	c
"	c
but	c
,	c
unfortunately	c
I	i
was	c
very	c
disappointed	c
.	c

At	i
first	i
,	c
as	c
I	c
have	c
read	c
in	c
your	c
advertisement	c
,	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
should	c
have	c
stared	i
in	c
this	c
show	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
you	c
have	c
written	c
that	c
the	c
musical	c
starts	c
at	c
19:30	c
.	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
I	c
must	c
say	c
that	c
this	c
evening	c
out	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
be	c
perfect	c
.	c

Your	i
faithfully	c
,	c

At	i
first	i
,	c
there	c
are	c
now	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
things	c
that	c
most	c
people	c
use	c
at	c
home	c
.	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
as	c
far	c
as	c
I	c
am	c
concidered	i
,	c
modern	c
technology	c
has	c
changed	c
my	c
life	c
completely	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

For	c
the	c
accommodation	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
because	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
probably	c
more	c
comfortable	c
.	c

I	c
choose	c
singing	c
because	c
I	c
love	c
singing	c
and	c
I	c
am	i
in	c
a	c
choir	c
for	c
7	c
years	c
now	c
.	c

I	c
also	c
choose	c
climbing	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
I	c
am	c
not	c
so	c
good	c
in	i
it	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
would	c
take	c
the	c
opportunity	c
to	c
improve	c
myself	i
.	c

In	c
addition	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
some	c
questions	c
.	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c

Everybody	c
is	c
stressed	c
,	i
you	i
have	c
to	c
make	i
the	c
queue	c
.	c

You	c
have	c
to	c
find	c
which	c
shop	c
offers	c
you	c
good	c
quality	c
products	c
for	c
a	c
good	c
price	c
.	c

But	i
sometimes	i
some	c
goods	c
are	c
expensive	c
but	c
of	c
a	c
very	c
bad	c
quality	c
.	c

And	c
it	c
is	c
not	c
an	c
easy	c
task	c
if	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
quality	c
.	c

Most	c
of	c
the	c
time	c
the	c
shop	c
assistant	c
does	c
n't	c
believe	c
you	c
.	c

Dear	c
Manager	c
,	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
the	c
tickets	c
were	c
too	c
expensive	c
.	c

Instead	i
,	c
due	c
to	c
some	c
technical	c
problems	c
,	c
it	c
began	c
at	c
20:15	c
.	c

Second	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
really	c
disappointed	c
when	c
I	c
found	c
out	c
that	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
the	c
best	c
actor	c
I	c
have	c
never	i
known	c
and	c
the	c
reason	c
for	c
which	i
I	i
decided	i
to	c
see	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
was	c
not	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
performing	c
.	c

Third	c
,	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
the	c
cheff	i
did	c
not	c
show	c
up	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
really	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
eating	c
at	c
that	c
place	c
.	c

Sally	c
,	c
her	c
best	c
friend	c
,	c
had	c
told	c
her	c
what	c
had	c
been	c
happening	c
at	c
her	c
house	c
for	c
the	c
last	c
two	c
months	c
.	c

So	c
Sally	c
started	c
to	c
talk	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
great	c
and	c
I	c
will	i
say	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
the	c
two	c
weeks	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
already	i
.	c

I	c
have	c
never	c
been	c
in	i
California	c
yet	i
.	c

I	c
decided	c
to	i
have	i
the	i
accommodation	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
in	i
a	c
tent	c
,	c
because	c
there	c
you	c
will	c
have	c
lots	c
of	c
fun	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
pleased	c
to	c
choose	c
two	c
activities	c
,	c
because	c
now	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
learn	c
SINGING	c
and	c
SURFING	c
!	c

I	c
am	c
not	i
well	i
in	i
both	i
activities	i
,	c
but	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
a	c
pleasure	c
to	c
try	c
it	i
espacially	i
surfing	c
,	i
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
feel	c
the	c
air	i
in	c
my	c
hair	c
,	c
and	c
enjoy	c
how	c
quick	i
the	c
board	c
goes	c
over	c
the	c
sea	c
.	c

Another	i
question	i
I	i
have	i
;	c
the	c
live	i
there	c
,	c
is	c
it	c
as	c
expensive	c
as	c
I	c
think	c
?	c

The	c
main	c
reason	c
I	c
hate	c
,	i
there	c
are	c
too	c
many	c
people	c
who	c
are	c
always	c
standing	c
in	c
my	c
way	c
(	c
or	c
maybe	c
I	c
think	i
in	i
that	i
way	i
)	c
and	c
I	c
begin	c
to	c
be	i
angry	c
,	i
normally	i
I	i
am	i
looking	i
those	i
people	i
with	i
evil	i
eyes	i
!	c

I	c
mean	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
too	c
crowdy	i
,	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
wait	c
such	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
before	c
you	c
can	c
pay	c
,	c
and	c
mostly	i
all	i
the	c
things	c
are	c
too	c
expensive	c
!	c

Even	c
before	c
you	c
will	i
find	i
a	c
color	c
you	c
like	c
or	c
the	c
right	c
size	c
of	c
the	i
trousers	c
,	c
you	c
were	i
looking	c
for	c
it	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
,	c
has	i
gone	c
!	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
:	c

In	c
spite	c
of	c
liking	c
all	c
the	c
sports	c
you	c
wrote	c
in	i
your	c
letter	c
I	i
am	c
only	c
good	c
at	c
climbing	c
and	c
sailing	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
am	i
used	i
to	i
practise	i
them	c
with	c
my	c
father	c
since	i
I	c
was	c
a	c
child	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
the	c
majority	c
of	c
the	i
people	c
that	i
go	c
shopping	c
are	c
women	c
who	c
must	c
buy	c
food	c
and	c
other	c
kind	i
of	c
things	c
for	c
her	i
family	i
,	c
so	c
for	i
them	c
,	c
shopping	c
is	c
a	c
very	c
boring	c
activity	c
that	c
is	c
repeated	c
everyday	i
and	c
that	c
drive	i
them	c
crazy	c
when	c
they	c
have	c
to	c
choose	c
the	c
best	c
product	c
and	c
the	c
cheapest	c
price	c
to	c
save	c
some	c
money	c
.	c

While	c
there	c
I	c
saw	c
your	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
show	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
"	c
and	c
decided	c
to	c
go	c
.	c

After	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
over	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
possible	c
to	c
visit	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
,	c
as	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
that	c
day	c
.	c

You	c
will	c
find	c
the	c
receipt	c
enclosed	c
.	c

Modern	c
technology	c
is	c
affecting	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
a	c
lot	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
even	c
say	c
changed	i
it	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
write	c
letters	c
to	c
my	c
friends	c
anymore	c
,	c
and	c
wait	c
weeks	c
before	c
receiving	c
answers	c
,	c
I	c
just	c
send	c
an	c
electronic	c
mail	c
through	i
the	c
internet	i
and	c
the	c
person	c
received	i
it	c
within	c
seconds	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
also	c
possible	c
to	c
read	c
the	c
news	c
or	c
play	c
games	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
says	i
that	c
the	c
starring	i
were	c
different	i
actors	i
,	i
and	i
there	i
were	i
n't	i
different	i
one	i
,	i
so	i
that	i
can	i
not	i
be	i
.	c

Also	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
says	i
,	i
that	c
the	c
show	c
will	i
begin	c
at	c
19.30	c
and	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
20.15	c
;	c
that	c
mean	i
that	c
I	c
have	i
to	c
cancelled	i
a	c
date	c
that	c
I	c
had	c
at	c
21:00	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
coud	i
n't	i
make	c
it	c
.	c

Another	c
thing	c
that	c
happened	i
was	c
that	c
the	i
tickets	i
did	i
not	i
have	i
discount	i
and	c
the	c
advertisement	c
says	i
the	i
will	i
have	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
really	c
made	i
and	c
I	c
want	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
,	i
please	i
call	c
me	c
to	i
the	c
number	c
23456789	c
,	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
waiting	c
your	i
call	c
.	c

Thank	c
for	i
your	c
time	c

Modern	c
technology	c
have	i
change	i
my	c
daily	c
life	c
in	c
many	c
aspects	i
.	c

In	c
the	c
early	i
day	i
,	c
on	c
a	c
raining	i
day	c
you	c
could	c
n't	c
play	c
because	c
most	c
of	i
game	i
were	c
outside	i
the	c
house	c
but	c
now	c
with	c
the	i
technology	c
you	c
can	c
make	i
many	c
things	c
in	c
your	c
house	c
.	c

Another	c
aspect	c
is	c
,	i
on	i
the	i
house	i
artefacts	i
,	i
microwaves	c
,	c
laundrymachine	i
,	i
make	c
life	c
easily	i
.	c

When	c
I	c
saw	c
the	c
advertisement	c
about	i
the	c
show	c
I	c
got	c
very	c
excited	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
always	c
wanted	c
to	c
see	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
had	c
some	c
problems	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
want	c
you	c
to	c
know	c
about	c
that	i
.	c

There	c
were	c
unknown	c
actors	c
,	c
and	c
they	c
were	c
not	c
as	c
good	c
as	c
the	c
other	c
ones	c
.	c

I	c
had	i
had	i
not	i
a	c
perfect	c
night	c
at	c
all	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
if	c
I	c
can	c
have	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

Please	c
give	c
me	c
an	c
answer	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

We	c
cannot	c
deny	c
that	c
technology	c
has	c
changed	c
our	c
lives	c
.	c

We	c
can	c
communicate	c
with	c
people	c
in	c
distant	c
countries	c
in	c
real	c
time	c
,	c
using	c
the	c
internet	i
.	c

There	c
is	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
other	c
examples	c
of	c
how	c
technology	c
has	c
changed	c
people	c
's	c
lives	c
.	c

I	c
would	i
not	c
do	c
my	c
school	c
projects	c
without	c
using	c
a	c
computer	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
do	c
some	c
statistical	c
analysis	c
that	c
I	c
would	i
not	c
do	c
with	c
a	c
calculator	c
.	c

An	i
other	i
thing	c
which	c
is	c
very	c
useful	c
for	c
me	c
is	c
my	c
mobile	c
phone	c
,	c
because	c
people	c
can	c
talk	c
to	c
me	c
whenever	c
they	c
need	c
,	i
but	c
on	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
it	c
is	c
very	c
unpleasant	c
to	c
be	c
interrupted	c
by	c
the	c
phone	c
when	c
I	c
am	c
in	c
an	c
important	c
meeting	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Ryan	c
,	c

Besides	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
preffer	i
to	c
stay	c
in	c
tents	i
,	c
because	c
I	c
got	c
used	c
to	c
being	c
in	c
tents	c
since	c
each	i
summer	i
I	i
spent	i
my	i
holidays	i
with	c
my	c
friends	c
at	i
the	c
hills	c
.	c

In	c
adittion	i
,	c
I	c
would	c
rather	i
playing	c
tennis	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
was	c
younger	c
I	c
won	c
the	c
National	c
Tennis	c
Championship	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

Moreover	i
in	c
the	c
shops	c
that	c
sales	i
fashionable	c
clothes	c
.	c

To	c
summarize	c
,	c
I	c
could	i
say	c
that	c
if	c
you	c
want	c
to	c
buy	c
something	c
,	c
first	c
make	c
sure	c
what	c
sort	c
of	c
product	c
you	c
need	c
and	c
then	c
,	i
go	c
shopping	c
.	c

If	c
not	i
shopping	c
never	i
be	c
enjoyable	c
,	c
but	c
also	i
tiring	c
and	c
boring	c
.	c

MANAGER	c

YOUR	c
ADVERTISING	c
LEAFLET	c
WAS	c
COMPLETELY	c
WRONG	i
,	i
IT	c
SAID	c
THAT	c
DANNY	c

WAS	c
ACTING	c
BUT	c
,	c
WHEN	c
I	c
GOT	c

THERE	c
WAS	c
ANOTHER	c
GUY	c
ON	c
STAGE	c

IT	c
WAS	c
DISAPPOINTING	c
,	c
SPECIALLY	c
FOR	c
ME	c
WHO	c
IS	c
A	c
GREAT	c
FAN	c
OF	c
DENNY	c

MOST	i
OF	i
MY	i
DAY	i
I	i
SPEND	i
IN	c

OF	c
ONE	c
OF	c
THOSE	c
MACHINES	c

STUDYING	c

RESEARCHING	c
,	c
PLAYING	c
AND	c
TALKING	c
TO	c
FRIENDS	c
ALL	c
AROUND	c
THE	c
WORLD	c

THIS	c
TECHNOLOGY	c
HAS	i
ALSO	i
IT	c
'S	c
BAD	c
ASPECT	c
,	i
IT	c
MAKES	i
YOU	c
MORE	i
FAR	i
FROM	c
PEOPLE	c

ISOLATED	i
FROM	c
TRUE	c
RELATIONSHIPS	c
BUT	c
YOU	c

IT	c
WHEN	c

Dear	c

prefer	c
staying	c
in	c
log	c
cabins	c
.	c

I	c
've	c
got	c
some	c
skin	c
trouble	c
and	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
sleep	c
very	c
well	c
in	c
tents	c
.	c

That	c
time	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
sleep	i
in	c
tent	c
.	c

Whole	c
night	c
,	c
I	c
felt	c
backache	i
ands	i
shoulder	c
ache	c
so	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
sleep	c
very	c
well	c
.	c

And	c
I	c
've	c
never	c
stayed	c
in	c
log	c
cabins	c
.	c

It	c
sounds	c
wonderful	c
!	c

Actually	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	i
swimming	i
at	c
all	c
.	c

You	c
pay	c
for	c
all	c
costs	c
.	c

And	c
please	c
let	c
me	c
know	c
How	c
the	c
weather	c
is	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
must	c
know	c
if	c
it	c
is	c
cold	c
or	c
hot	c
.	c

Whenever	c
I	c
walk	c
in	c
the	c
street	c
,	c
I	c
always	c
want	c
to	c
go	c
into	c
the	i
every	c
shops	i
.	c

I	c
always	c
want	c
to	c
buy	c
T-shirts	c
,	c
Jeans	c
,	c
Skirts	c
,	c
cosmetic	i
,	c
hairband	i
,	c
accessories	c
,	c
ring	i
,	c
earings	i
,	c

,	c
shoes	c
,	c
hats	c
,	c
bags	c
,	c
fancy	c
stationeries	i
,	c
interior	c
stuffs	i
and	c
CD	i
.	c

Before	c
I	c
go	c
out	c
home	i
,	c
I	c
make	c
a	c
plan	c
.	c

But	c
when	c
I	c
stand	c
at	i
every	c
shops	i
,	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
stand	i
my	c
desire	c
.	c

If	c
I	c
have	c
got	c
enough	c
money	c
to	c
buy	c
something	c
what	i
I	c
want	c
to	c
buy	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
buy	c
them	c
and	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
no	c
problem	c
.	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
enjoyable	c
any	c
more	c
.	c

I	c
'll	c
think	c
why	i
I	c
'm	c
so	c
poor	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
can	c
get	c
over	c
.	i

I	c
go	c
window	c
shopping	c
.	c

They	c
make	c
me	c
happy	c
and	c
rich	c

Dear	c
Ms.	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
pleased	c
to	c
be	c
the	c
winer	i
in	c
your	c
competition	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
working	c
as	c
a	c
Mechanical	c
Engineer	c
for	c
a	c
well-known	c
car	c
company	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
this	c
the	c
only	c
month	c
I	c
can	c
use	c
my	c
annual	c
leave	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
was	c
at	c
the	c
Univercity	i
I	c
was	c
very	c
keen	c
on	c
basket	i
ball	i
and	c
I	c
was	i
playing	i
in	i
Univercity	i
's	i
team	c
.	c

In	c
1998	c
we	c
were	c
the	c
champion	c
of	c
the	c
First	c
National	c
Leque	i
.	c

So	c
I	c
would	c
love	c
to	c
join	i
Basketball	i
and	c
Swimming	i
activities	c
while	c
I	c
am	c
at	c
the	c
Camp	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
your	c
reply	c
!	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Novadays	i
our	c
shopping	c
habits	c
seem	c
to	c
be	i
changed	c
.	c

I	c
can	c
clearly	c
remember	c
my	c
childhood	c
and	c
our	c
only	c
local	c
shop	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
really	c
astonished	c
by	c
all	c
these	c
shopping	c
centers	i
like	i
ASDA	c
,	c
HOMEBASE	c
,	c
ex	i
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
could	c
not	c
find	c
the	c
entrance	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
holding	c
a	c
peace	i
of	c
paper	c
which	c
my	c
mum	c
gave	c
to	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
started	c
looking	c
for	c
the	c
food	c
products	c
written	i
on	c
the	c
paper	i
but	c
I	c
found	c
only	c
the	c
eggs	c
,	c
milk	c
and	c
bread	c
.	c

Dear	c
sir	c
,	c

It	c
was	c
announced	c
that	c
there	c
would	c
be	c
discount	c
tickets	c
available	c
,	c
but	c
there	c
were	c
not	c
.	c

Last	c
,	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
there	c
was	c
a	c
serious	c
leak	c
in	c
a	c
tube	i
and	c
the	c
kitchen	c
was	c
flooded	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
there	c
are	c
sufficient	c
reasons	c
for	c
money	i
back	c
.	c

I	c
really	c
expect	c
that	c
you	c
consider	i
my	c
arguments	c
and	c
cash	i
me	c
back	c
the	c
value	c
of	c
the	c
ticket	c
,	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c
.	c

Nowadays	c
,	c
I	c
feel	c
myself	i
entirely	c
linked	c
to	c
these	c
innovations	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
find	c
it	c
hard	c
to	c
live	c
without	c
them	c
.	c

Information	c
is	c
spread	c
quickly	c
and	c
you	c
can	c
access	c
in	c
minutes	c
a	c
wide	c
range	c
of	c
data	c
,	c
that	i
would	c
take	c
a	c
much	c
longer	c
time	c
to	i
be	c
found	c
by	c
traditional	c
means	c
.	c

For	c
a	c
shy	c
person	c
,	c
like	c
me	c
,	c
Internet	i
has	c
another	c
attractive	i
:	c
the	c
possibility	i
of	c
knowing	c
people	c
and	c
making	c
friends	c
worldwide	c
.	c

Celular	i
phone	c
can	c
be	c
inconvenient	c
sometimes	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
can	c
be	c
very	c
useful	c
in	c
certain	c
situations	c
:	c
when	c
your	c
car	c
is	i
broken	c
on	i
the	c
road	c
,	c
when	c
you	c
need	c
to	c
be	c
found	c
anywhere	c
and	c
at	c
any	c
time	c
(	c
if	c
you	c
are	c
a	c
doctor	c
,	c
a	c
lawyer	c
or	c
a	c
journalist	c
,	c
for	c
instance	c
)	c
,	c
and	c
so	c
forth	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
so	c
happy	c
to	c
hear	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
a	c
two	i
weeks	i
holiday	c
in	c
the	c
U.S.A	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
living	i
in	c
tents	c
to	c
log	c
cabins	c
.	c

I	c
love	c
swimming	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
am	c
not	c
any	c
good	c
at	c
swimming	c
.	c

Also	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
join	c
basketball	i
team	c
,	i
I	c
used	c
to	c
play	c
basketball	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
in	c
high	c
school	c
,	c
and	c
our	c
high	c
school	c
basketball	c
team	c
have	i
won	c
many	c
competitions	c
during	c
last	i
ten	c
years	c
in	c
our	c
city	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
glad	c
I	c
had	i
taken	c
a	i
part	c
in	c
a	c
few	c
competitions	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
so	c
proud	c
of	c
our	c
basketball	c
team	c
.	c

Would	c
you	c
tell	c
me	c
that	i
how	c
much	c
money	c
you	c
would	i
give	c
it	i
to	c
me	c
and	c
how	i
is	i
the	i
weather	i
like	c
in	c
U.S.A.	i
Thank	c
you	c
for	c
every	i
thing	i
!	c

You	c
wanted	c
to	c
hear	c
about	c
my	c
experience	c
at	c
the	c
pop	c
concert	c
which	c
I	c
enjoyed	c
helping	c
last	i
month	c
?	c

I	c
must	c
say	c
that	c
was	c
a	i
great	c
fun	c
,	i
I	i
've	i
never	c
had	c
this	c
kind	c
of	c
experience	c
before	c
.	c

Before	c
the	c
concert	c
actually	c
started	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
give	c
out	c
lots	c
of	c
leaflets	c
,	i
they	i
are	i
list	i
of	c
pop	c
band	i
and	c
group	i
which	c
will	i
appear	c
in	c
the	c
concert	c
in	c
order	c
,	c
and	c
some	c
information	c
about	c
their	c
performance	c
and	c
backgrounds	c
.	c

After	c
that	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
help	c
people	c
who	c
had	c
a	c
ticket	c
but	c
ca	i
n't	i
find	c
their	c
seat	c
.	c

During	c
the	c
concert	c
,	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
have	c
a	c
lot	c
to	c
do	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
had	c
chance	i
to	c
see	c
most	c
of	c
the	c
performance	c
,	i
that	i
was	c
excellent	c
.	c

During	c
break	i
time	c
I	c
did	c
give	c
a	c
lots	i
of	c
direction	i
to	c
people	c
who	c
ca	i
n't	i
find	c
toilet	i
,	c
and	c
information	i
such	c
as	c
where	c
they	c
could	c
have	c
a	c
cup	c
of	c
coffee	c
.	c

Write	i
to	i
you	i
next	i
time	i
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
&	c
Madam	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
work	c
except	i
that	c
month	c
.	c

I	c
prefer	c
staying	c
in	c
tents	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
unusual	i
experience	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
I	c
'm	c
much	c
better	c
than	c
a	c
beginner	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
never	c
had	c
a	c
chance	c
to	c
enjoy	c
sailing	c
.	c

Now	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
two	c
questions	c
about	c
camping	c
.	c

First	c
,	c
what	c
clothes	c
should	c
I	c
bring	c
?	c

Is	c
it	c
hot	c
enough	c
?	c

I	c
've	c
never	c
been	c
to	c
California	c
,	c
therefore	c
please	c
let	c
me	c
know	c
about	c
the	c
weather	c
there	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
n't	c
a	c
clue	c
about	c
it	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

It	c
was	c
so	c
nice	c
to	c
hear	c
from	c
you	c
last	c
time	c
.	c

As	c
I	c
mentioned	c
before	c
,	c
I	c
really	c
enjoyed	c
helping	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
last	c
month	c
,	i
the	i
artist	c
's	c
name	c
was	c
"	c
Bonny	c
Pink	c
"	c
who	i
is	c
famous	c
in	c
my	c
country	c
.	c

My	c
job	c
was	c
looking	c
after	c
her	c
when	c
she	c
had	c
a	c
break	c
time	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
impressed	c
when	c
I	c
heard	c
that	c
she	c
liked	c
playing	i
puzzle	i
alone	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
very	i
interesting	c
experience	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
wish	c
you	c
were	i
there	c
.	c

Anyway	c
it	c
's	c
the	i
time	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
bed	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
teaching	c
children	c
to	c
play	c
tennis	c
for	c
three	c
years	c
.	c

The	c
name	c
of	c
the	c
band	c
was	c
'	c
Dream	c
Comes	c
True	c
'	c
.	c

First	c
,	c
I	c
helped	c
to	c
prepare	c
the	c
stage	c
before	c
the	c
band	c
arrived	c
.	c

After	c
that	c
I	c
helped	c
to	c
test	c
lights	c
and	c
microphones	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
a	c
fan	c
of	c
this	c
band	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
seen	c
them	c
in	c
flesh	i
.	c

The	c
most	c
exciting	c
thing	c
about	c
my	c
experience	c
was	c
that	c
the	c
band	c
spoke	c
to	c
me	c
after	c
the	c
concert	c
.	c

The	c
band	c
was	c
very	c
satisfied	c
with	c
the	c
stage	c
and	c
appreciated	c
our	c
work	c
.	c

I	c
want	c
to	c
help	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
again	c
!	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Best	c
wishes	c
,	c

According	c
to	c
your	c
brochure	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
be	c
the	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
;	c
instead	c
of	c
that	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
very	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
the	c
actors	c
were	c
n't	c
those	c
announced	c
.	c

To	c
end	c
,	c
in	i
spite	i
of	i
being	c
opened	i
,	c
the	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
for	c
reparations	i
.	c

Because	c
of	c
all	c
those	i
inconvenients	i
,	c
I	c
ask	c
you	c
a	i
total	c
refund	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
sure	c
you	c
will	c
accept	c
my	c
request	c
;	c
if	c
not	c
I	c
intend	c
to	c
take	c
legal	c
actions	i
against	c
your	c
company	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

When	c
poor	c
Caroline	c
arrived	c
at	c
school	c
on	c
Wednesday	c
morning	c
all	c
the	c
students	c
of	i
her	c
class	c
knew	c
about	c
what	c
she	c
had	c
just	i
said	i
the	c
day	c
before	c
to	c
Pat	c
.	c

So	c
immediatly	i
she	c
went	c
towards	i
Pat	c
,	c
angry	c
,	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
argue	c
with	c
him	c
,	c
saying	c
that	c
she	c
was	c
annoyed	c
by	c
the	c
way	c
he	c
behaved	c
,	c
and	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
the	c
first	c
time	c
that	c
he	c
was	c
n't	c
capable	c
of	c
keeping	c
a	c
secret	c
.	c

After	c
a	c
long	c
conversation	c
they	c
eventually	c
decided	c
to	c
split	c
up	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c

So	c
we	c
can	c
walk	c
around	c
and	c
see	c
how	i
it	i
looks	i
like	i
in	i
Greenwich	i
.	c

It	c
is	c
from	c
10	c
am	c
to	c
7	c
p.m.	c
,	i
it	i
is	i
about	i
the	c
latest	c
fashion	c
,	c
leisure	c
and	c
sports	c
wear	c
,	c
make	i
up	i
and	c
hairstyles	c
,	i
all	i
of	c
us	c
are	c
really	c
interesting	i
,	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
free	c
for	c
student	i
to	c
get	c
in	c
as	c
well	c
.	c

The	c
first	c
days	c
was	i
going	i
fine	c
,	i
we	i
just	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
some	c
teamwork	c
things	c
.	c

I	c
did	c
not	c
want	c
to	c
climb	c
up	c
but	c
I	c
did	c
not	c
have	c
any	c
choice	c
.	c

17-6-00	c

I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
to	c
buy	c
the	c
ticket	c
and	c
expected	c
to	c
have	i
a	c
discount	c
as	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
student	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
not	c
understand	c
why	c
but	c
still	i
bought	c
the	c
ticket	c
because	c
I	c
was	c
crazy	c
about	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
.	c

Then	c
,	c
I	c
went	c
into	c
the	c
theatre	c
on	c
time	c
but	c
became	c
a	c
little	c
bit	c
angry	c
for	i
waiting	c
until	c
20:15	c
,	c
forty-five	c
minutes	c
after	c
the	c
expected	c
starting	c
time	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

She	c
told	c
us	c
there	c
were	c
numerous	c
types	c
of	c
job	c
in	c
the	c
world	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

Being	c
on	c
a	i
holiday	c
trip	i
in	c
London	c
,	c
I	c
dreamed	c
to	i
go	i
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
for	i
a	c
musical	c
show	c
.	c

There	c
were	c
no	c
discount	c
places	i
because	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
planed	i
like	i
this	i
by	i
the	i
theatre	i
.	c

I	c
was	c
terribly	c
ennoyed	i

"	c
How	c
has	c
modern	c
technology	c
changed	c
your	c
daily	c
life	c
?	c
"	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
"	c
daily	c
life	c
"	c
concerns	c
(	c
as	c
far	c
as	c
I	c
am	c
concerned	c
)	c
my	c
life	c
everywhere	c
,	c
and	c
more	c
precisely	c
at	c
home	c
,	c
at	c
the	c
university	c
and	c
at	c
work	c
.	c

Being	c
in	i
an	c
apprenticeship	c
,	c
I	c
go	c
both	i
work	c
and	c
university	c
.	c

I	c
often	c
go	c
on	c
Internet	i
to	c
find	c
informations	i
for	i
studying	c
a	c
precise	i
subject	c
more	c
accutely	i
(	c
university	c
technology	c
sites	c
)	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
buy	c
a	c
normal	c
ticket	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
bought	c
a	c
second	c
musical	c
show	c
ticket	c
which	c
start	i
at	c
19:30	c
but	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
.	c

As	c
a	c
result	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
wait	c
over	c
one	c
hour	c
as	c
I	c
arrived	c
there	c
at	c
19:00	c
.	c

Thirdly	c
,	c
your	c
advertisement	c
misled	i
I	c
could	c
see	c
Danny	c
Brook	i
in	i
the	i
show	i
who	i
I	i
adore	i
.	c

When	c
I	c
turned	c
up	c
the	i
show	c
,	c
there	c
was	c
another	c
actor	c
instead	c
of	c
him	c
.	c

Fourthly	c
,	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
of	c
it	i
's	i
problems	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
this	c
matter	c
will	c
recieve	i
your	c
prompt	c
attention	c

yours	c

Nowadays	i

I	c

pleased	c

you	c
the	c

Firstly	c
,	c
the	c
most	c

I	c

now	c
,	c
and	c
my	c

In	c
this	c
book	c
,	c
Heathcliff	c
as	c
a	c
child	c
had	i
n't	i
a	c
bad	c
character	c
but	i
the	c
situations	c
lived	i
with	i
the	c
family	i
Earnshaw	i
,	c
where	c
the	i
grown	i
up	c
,	c
made	c
him	c
rude	c
,	c
agresive	i
and	c
noisy	c
.	c

Heathcliff	c
used	c
to	c
play	c
with	c
Catherine	c
.	c

Heanley	c
could	c
n't	c
accept	c
the	c
good	c
relationship	c
and	c
love	c
between	c
Catherine	c
and	c
Heathcliff	c
and	c
,	c
for	c
that	c
reason	c
he	i
sent	c
Heathcliff	c
to	c
work	c
in	i
the	c
farm	c
.	c

Before	c
Heathcliff	c
died	c
he	c
riched	i
what	c
he	c
wanted	c
.	c

The	c
houses	c
and	c
money	c
of	c
the	c
families	i
Earnshaw	i
and	i
Linton	i
,	i
all	c
belonged	c
to	c
him	c

and	c
he	c
was	c
buried	c
near	c

great	c

only	c

Thank	c
you	c
a	i
lot	i
for	c
your	c
kind	c
letter	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
surprised	c
on	i
the	c
result	c
of	c
the	c
competition	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
better	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
travel	c
on	i
July	c
.	c

In	c
your	c
letter	c
you	c
ask	c
me	c
to	c
choose	c
beetween	i
tents	c
or	c
log	c
cabins	c
,	i
well	i
I	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
more	c
confortable	i
and	c
I	c
am	c
afraid	c
about	i
wild	c
animals	c
.	c

I	c
saw	c
,	i
you	c
offer	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
activities	c
,	i
that'is	i
fantastic	c
!	c

It	c
is	c
very	c
difficult	c
to	c
decide	c
which	c
two	c
of	c
these	c
activities	c
I	c
like	c
and	i
I	c
can	c
also	c
do	c
the	i
best	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
I	c
choose	i
singing	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
sung	c
for	c
five	c
years	c
in	c
a	c
church	c
chorus	i
and	c
I	c
do	c
it	c
very	c
well	c
.	c

Now	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
if	c
wee	i
need	c
some	c
money	c
and	c
if	c
it	c
is	c
necessary	c
to	c
take	c
with	c
me	c
special	c
clothes	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
I	c
have	c
give	i
to	c
you	c
all	c
the	c
information	c
you	c
needed	i
and	c
I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c

B.	c
Müller	c

I	c
had	c
to	c
start	c
very	c
early	c
in	c
the	c
morning	c
,	c
at	c
7.30	c
.	c

We	i
first	i
had	c
to	c
prapare	i
the	c
stands	c
with	c
food	c
and	c
drinks	i
and	c
buy	c
something	c
which	c
had	c
been	c
forgotten	c
.	c

I	c
logically	i
accepted	c
.	c

The	i
interview	i
I	i
liked	i
particularly	i
Before	i
the	c
concert	c
started	c
,	c
we	c
had	c
to	i
verify	i
all	c
music	i
instruments	c
.	c

The	c
microphones	c
all	c
had	c
to	c
be	c
controlled	i
.	c

The	c
concert	c
was	c
a	c
success	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
proude	i
of	c
me	i
and	c
the	c
work	c
I	c
had	c
done	c
.	c

After	c
concert	i
I	c
left	c
with	c
Ricky	c
Martin	c
.	c

Now	c
you	c
can	c
guess	c
how	c
disappointed	c
I	c
was	c
when	c
I	c
saw	c
that	c
there	c
were	c
different	c
(	c
and	c
worse	c
)	c
actors	c
!	c

Moreover	c
,	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
really	c
hungry	c
because	c
I	c
had	c
n't	c
had	c
my	c
dinner	c
that	c
evening	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
be	c
on	c
time	c
for	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

And	c
I	c
am	c
really	c
sorry	c
,	c
but	c
consequently	c
I	c
would	c
ask	c
you	c
for	c
some	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
considering	c
my	c
request	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
,	c

We	c
especially	c
look	c
for	i
make	i
the	c
River	i
trip	c
to	c
Greenwich	c
.	c

However	c
we	i
have	c
send	i
an	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
"	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
"	c
,	c
which	c
will	c
take	c
place	c
on	c
the	i
Tuesday	c
14th	c
March	c
from	c
10.00	c
am	c
to	c
19.00	c
pm	c
during	c
our	c
trip	c
in	i
London	c
and	c
in	c
which	c
the	c
follow	i
topics	c
will	c
be	c
showed	i
:	c

.	c

.	c

Leisure	c
and	c
sports	c
wear	c

.	c

Make	i
up	i

.	c

We	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
request	i
if	c
we	c
could	c
go	c
to	c
this	c
show	c
on	c
the	c
15th	c
March	c
instide	i
off	i
the	i
visit	c
in	i
the	c
Science	c
Museum	c
.	c

Who	c
have	i
never	c
dreamed	c
to	i
be	i
a	c
famous	c
singer	c
,	c
sportman	i
,	c
actor	c
or	c
a	c
politician	c
?	c

The	c
success	c
of	c
these	c
people	c
is	c
so	c
big	i
that	c
they	c
are	c
known	c
all	c
over	c
the	c
World	i
.	c

They	c
have	i
always	i
to	c
be	c
careful	c
about	c
what	c
they	c
say	c
and	c
what	c
they	c
do	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
because	i
they	c
have	c
admiration	i
for	c
them	c
and	c
lastly	c
because	c
they	c
want	c
dreams	i
and	c
see	c
what	c
a	c
"	c
star	i
life	c
"	c
look	i
like	c
.	c

And	c
for	c
the	c
third	c
point	c
,	c
I	c
would	i
hope	i
to	c
offer	i
a	c
good	c
diner	i
to	c
my	c
friend	c
because	c
I	c
knew	c
your	c
restaurant	c
as	i
a	c
famous	c
place	c
but	c
I	c
was	c
still	i
disappointed	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
closed	c
for	c
some	i
improvements	i
!	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
!	c

Poor	i
of	i
I	i
,	c
I	c
thought	c
it	c
was	c
nice	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
friend	c
and	c
to	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
share	c
lots	c
of	c
things	c
!	c

I	c
was	c
just	c
thirteen	c
years	c
old	c
!	c

I	c
had	c
read	c
a	c
very	c
good	c
book	c
about	c
pirates	c
and	c
I	c
know	c
I	c
got	i
a	c
very	c
creative	c
imagination	c
.	c

Like	c
my	c
heros	i
I	i
would	c
like	i
to	c
live	c
in	c
a	c
ship	c
and	c
decided	c
to	c
build	c
something	c
in	c
a	c
tree	c
.	c

The	c
highest	c
tree	c
near	c
a	c
river	c
I	c
have	c
ever	c
seen	c
.	c

Peaceful	i
place	c
and	i
wonderful	c
view	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
our	c
fortress	c
and	c
every	c
day	c
we	c
could	c
improve	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
prefered	i
it	c
.	c

But	c
Pat	c
could	c
not	c
keep	c
it	c
too	i
long	c
.	c

Our	c
quietness	i
disappeared	c
and	c
very	c
fast	i
everybody	c
wanted	c
to	c
command	c
my	c
ship	c
.	c

A	c
desaster	i
!	c

There	c
was	i
lots	c
of	c
fights	c
between	c
us	c
and	c
we	c
were	c
naughty	c
like	c
child	i
could	i
be	c
with	c
other	c
child	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
be	c
really	c
happy	c
if	c
I	c
could	c
apply	i
Singing	i
and	c
Photography	i
as	i
the	i
activities	c
you	c
have	c
written	i
about	i
.	c

However	i
,	c
I	c
used	c
to	c
assist	c
my	c
brother	c
,	c
who	c
is	c
a	c
profecional	i
photographer	c
.	c

So	c
that	i
,	i
I	c
consider	c
myself	c
expirienced	i
enough	i
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

I	c
'm	c
sorry	c
I	c
have	c
n't	c
written	c
for	c
so	c
long	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
help	c
my	c
friend	c
with	c
the	c
lights	c
,	c
so	c
that	i
I	c
could	c
see	c
all	c
that	i
screaming	i
like	i
made	i
crowd	i
.	c

I	c
even	c
saw	c
crying	c
girls	c
,	i
who	c
were	c
trying	c
to	c
reach	c
the	c
pop-singer	i
.	c

Do	c
you	c
know	c
what	c
Kim	c
,	c
I	c
've	c
never	c
thought	c
before	c
,	i
that	c
enjoying	c
yourself	c
like	c
this	c
,	i
could	c
be	c
weirdly	c
.	i

I	c
mean	c
,	c
all	c
that	i
flashing	c
lights	c
,	c
the	i
changing	i
colours	i
of	i
them	i
,	c
I	c
believe	c
they	c
helped	c
much	i
.	c

Even	c
though	c
I	c
was	c
just	c
telling	c
my	c
friend	c
what	c
the	c
next	c
composition	c
of	c
colours	c
was	c
,	c
I	c
consider	c
myself	c
being	i
very	c
successful	i
.	c

This	c
was	c
maybe	c
the	c
best	c
part	c
of	c
being	c
there	c
.	c

Lots	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

Last	c
week	c
I	c
spent	c
my	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
and	c
I	i
've	i
seen	i
your	c
musical	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
'	c
in	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
really	c
disappointed	c
.	c

The	c
advertisment	i
says	c
that	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
would	c
play	c
but	c
in	c
this	c
show	c
there	c
were	c
totally	c
different	c
actors	c
and	c
that	c
was	c
really	c
disappointing	c
because	c
I	c
was	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
them	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
the	i
modern	c
technology	c
has	c
changed	i
my	i
daily	i
life	i
not	i
really	i
a	c
lot	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
just	c
20	c
years	c
old	c
and	c
I	c
used	c
to	c
play	c
computer	i
when	c
I	c
was	c
young	c
or	c
wash	c
my	c
clothes	c
in	c
the	c
washing	c
machine	c
.	c

It	c
becomes	c
more	i
and	i
more	i
easier	i
to	c
use	c
the	c
computer	c
for	c
everything	c
.	c

You	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
shop	c
to	c
buy	c
clothes	c
or	c
to	c
the	c
restaurant	c
to	c
order	c
some	c
food	c
.	c

I	c
can	c
just	c
switch	c
on	c
my	c
computer	c
and	c
order	c
everything	c
.	c

I	i
also	i
do	c
n't	c
write	c
letters	c
anymore	c
because	c
I	c
write	c
e-mails	c
to	c
my	c
friends	c
.	c

That	i
goes	i
quicker	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
easier	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

In	c
comparison	c
to	c
my	c
grandparents	c
they	i
have	c
really	i
problems	c
to	i
accept	i
these	c
changes	c
in	c
modern	c
technology	c
.	c

Because	c
the	c
biggest	c
developments	c
were	c
in	c
the	c
last	c
50	c
years	c
.	c

The	c
second	c
reason	c
is	c
the	c
weather	c
.	c

I	c
love	c
travelling	c
when	c
the	c
weather	c
is	c
warm	c
.	c

May	c
I	c
have	c
a	c
babysitter	c
?	c

I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
have	c
more	c
free	c
time	c
for	c
myself	c
and	c
my	c
health	c
.	c

Let	c
me	c
say	c
still	i
thank	i
you	i
.	c

Best	c
regards	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

How	c
are	c
you	c
?	c

I	c
'm	c
fine	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
what	c
happened	c
last	c
month	c
.	c

Do	c
you	c
remember	c
which	c
is	c
my	c
favourite	c
group	c
?	c

I	i
was	c
a	c
great	c
and	c
wonderful	c
experience	c
.	c

Of	c
course	c
you	c
know	c
,	i
I	c
'm	c
a	c
singer	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
came	c
back	c
quigky	i
to	c
my	c
home	c
,	c
I	c
picked	c
my	i
microphone	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
handed	c
it	c
to	c
the	c
singer	c
.	c

The	c
concert	c
was	c
absolutely	c
fantastic	c
.	c

Can	c
you	c
immagine	i
?	c

Yours	c
Irene	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

whose	c
name	c
was	c
stated	i
on	i
the	c
advertisement	c
.	c

.	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
completely	i
disappointed	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
told	c
that	c
there	c
were	c
not	c
any	c
discounts	c
for	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

3	c
.	c

I	c
also	c
found	c
out	c
that	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
not	c
opened	i
after	c
the	c
show	c
due	c
to	c
the	i
shortage	i
of	i
food	i
sold	i
.	c

I	c
was	c
really	c
hungry	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
and	c
was	c
pissed	i
off	i
.	c

Your	i
faithfully	c
,	c

I	c
will	i
imagine	i
that	c
,	i
people	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
,	c
for	c
example	c
100	c
years	c
from	c
now	c
,	c
will	c
wear	c
clothes	c
for	c
protection	c
like	c
people	c
did	c
in	c
the	c
past	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
the	i
people	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
will	c
propably	i
wear	c
clothes	c
to	c
protect	c
themselves	c
from	c
the	c
polluted	c
air	c
and	c
water	c
,	c
the	c
harmful	c
ultra-violet	c
rays	c
from	c
the	c
sun	c
and	c
all	c
the	c
dangerous	c
and	c
poisonous	c
gases	c
or	c
chemicals	c
which	c
is	i
result	i
of	c
a	c
developed	c
and	c
full-grown	i
country	c
.	c

They	c
will	c
also	c
wear	c
water-proof	c
,	c
ultra-violet	i
proof	i
and	c
other	c
dangerous	i
liquid-proof	i
clothes	c
to	c
protect	c
themselves	c
These	i
clothes	c
have	c
to	c
be	c
made	c
of	c
something	c
light	c
,	c
suitable	i
to	c
wear	c
and	c
protective	c
.	c

Therefore	c
,	c
I	c
will	c
suggest	c
that	c
we	c
all	c
nov	i
to	c
keep	c
the	c
enviroment	i
clean	c
and	c
healthy	c
for	c
the	c
next	c
generation	c
.	c

14th	c
June	c
2000	c

I	c
am	c
really	c
pleased	c
to	c
be	c
the	c
winner	c
of	c
your	c
competition	c
and	c
I	c
cannot	c
help	c
thinking	c
about	c
the	c
two	c
weeks	c
in	c
the	c
USA	c
.	c

Concerning	c
accommodation	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
,	c
would	c
it	c
be	c
possible	c
to	c
live	i
in	c
log	i
cabins	i
?	c

Moreover	i
,	i
I	c
practice	i
Basketball	i
in	c
a	c
famous	c
French	c
Club	i
:	i
That	i
is	c
the	c
reason	c
why	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
choose	c
the	c
Basketball	i
.	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
what	c
sort	c
of	c
clothes	c
must	c
we	c
have	c
for	c
the	c
different	c
activities	c
?	c

I	c
hope	c
my	c
answers	c
will	c
satisfy	c
you	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Tom	c
Turner	c

After	c
having	c
thought	c
about	c
this	c
video	c
and	c
asked	c
different	i
people	c
so	c
as	c
to	c
know	c
what	c
they	c
suggested	c
,	c
I	c
reached	c
the	c
following	c
conclusions	c
:	c
we	c
must	c
film	c
the	c
lessons	c
which	c
are	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
and	c
the	c
activities	c
which	c
take	c
a	i
great	c
part	c
in	i
a	c
day	c
at	c
school	c
;	c
this	c
being	c
in	c
three	c
parts	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
as	c
Mathematics	i
are	i
the	c
main	c
lesson	c
in	c
the	c
morning	c
,	c
we	c
ought	c
to	c
film	c
a	i
time	c
where	i
we	c
are	c
in	c
MathClass	i

the	c
lunch	c

the	c
afternoon	c

We	c
could	c
begin	c
the	c
afternoon	c
with	c
the	i
sport	c
,	c
showing	c
the	c
different	c
places	i
with	c
surroundings	i
(	c
near	i
the	i
wild	i
)	c
:	c
it	c
would	c
give	c
a	c
good	c
impression	c
.	c

Before	c
that	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
have	c
showed	i
the	c
break	c
at	c
3	c
o'clock	c
which	i
is	c
important	c
for	c
us	c
.	c

First	c
,	c
the	c
actors	c
that	c
the	c
Circle	c
theatre	c
publis	i
in	i
their	c
tickets	c
for	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
were	c
not	c
,	i
which	c
was	c
very	c
disappointing	c
because	c
,	i
the	c
actors	c
were	i
starring	c
the	i
musical	c
,	i
was	i
one	c
of	c
it	i
mayor	i
attractions	c
.	c

Another	c
point	c
that	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
comply	i
about	c
,	i
is	c
the	c
time	c
that	c
the	c
musical	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
start	c
(	c
19:30	c
)	c
but	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
,	c
so	c
there	c
was	c
a	i
mayor	i
unsatisfaction	i
about	i
it	i
,	c
but	c
the	c
last	c
and	c
worst	c
thing	c
was	c
that	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
the	c
British	c
health	c
institute	c
considered	c
that	i
your	c
food	c
was	i
unhealthy	c
,	c
and	c
not	i
considering	i
many	c
other	c
points	c
like	c
unsatisfactory	c
service	c
,	c
and	c
uncomfortable	c
seats	c
.	c

Answering	i
the	c
question	c
:	c
"	c
How	c
has	c
modern	c
technology	c
changed	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
?	c
,	i
I	c
can	c
confirm	c
,	i
that	c
it	c
has	c
been	c
in	c
many	c
ways	c
,	c
and	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
one	c
that	c
I	c
can	c
remember	c
was	c
the	c
invention	c
of	c
computers	c
and	c
later	c
the	c
internet	i
,	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
easiest	i
to	i
me	c
,	c
and	c
to	i
every	i
one	i
,	c
to	c
make	i
your	c
home	i
works	i
,	c
school	i
works	i
,	c
and	c
in	i
fact	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
easier	c
to	i
me	c
to	c
search	c
for	c
information	c
that	c
in	c
the	c
past	c
I	c
would	c
have	c
to	c
look	c
at	i
in	c
a	c
library	c
.	c

But	c
not	c
all	i
about	c
technology	c
and	c
computers	c
is	c
good	c
,	c
because	c
many	c
people	c
,	c
and	c
me	c
in	c
a	c
control	i
way	c
,	c
had	i
become	c
computer	i
's	i
an	i
thechnologic	i
's	i
slaves	c
,	c
and	c
we	c
can	i
not	i
do	c
anything	c
without	c
a	c
machine	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
not	c
saying	c
that	c
it	c
's	c
wrong	c
or	c
bad	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
accept	c
that	c
they	c
make	c
easier	i
our	i
daily	i
tasks	i
,	c
but	c
we	c
have	c
to	c
mantain	i
our	c
independence	c
as	c
humans	c
.	c

Technology	c
,	c
in	c
fact	c
it	i
has	c
made	i
an	c
improvement	c
on	i
daily	c
tasks	c
,	c
but	c
we	c
have	c
to	c
think	c
and	c
work	c
by	c
ourselves	c
because	c
if	c
not	c
our	c
brain	i
will	c
become	c
atrophied	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
a	c
summer	c
holiday	c
from	c
at	i
the	c
end	c
of	c
June	c
to	c
at	i
the	c
begging	i
of	c
September	c
as	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
student	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
am	c
planing	i
to	c
work	c
in	c
August	c
as	i
a	c
part-time	c
job	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
great	c
to	c
have	c
a	i
fun	c
and	c
also	c
it	i
was	i
very	i
good	i
memorise	i
.	c

As	c
you	c
said	c
I	c
will	c
have	c
the	c
opportunity	c
to	c
do	c
two	c
activities	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
I	c
am	c
keen	c
on	c
swimming	c
but	c
actually	c
I	c
am	c
not	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
swimming	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
just	c
started	c
to	c
learn	c
swimming	i
but	c
I	c
have	c
really	c
been	c
enjoying	c
it	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
good	i
chance	c
to	c
improve	c
my	c
swimming	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
attention	c

The	c
customer	c
can	c
never	c
know	c
what	c
price	c
is	c
the	c
normal	c
unless	i
they	c
have	c
a	i
same	c
shop	c
or	c
same	i
thing	c
.	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
shopping	c
is	c
very	i
important	c
part	c
of	c
our	c
life	c
and	c
we	c
can	c
have	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
fun	c
,	c
however	c
it	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
which	c
means	c
we	c
can	i
not	i
find	c
only	c
advantages	c
from	i
it	c
.	c

About	c
accommodation	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
log	i
cabins	i
,	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
a	c
problem	c
in	i
my	c
back	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
,	c
could	c
you	c
advice	i
me	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
need	c
for	c
the	c
trip	c
?	c
and	c
is	c
there	c
anything	c
else	c
do	i
I	c
have	c
to	c
know	c
?	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Yours	c
Sincerely	c

I	c
looked	c
at	c
him	c
and	c
I	c
realised	c
that	c
this	c
person	c
was	c
David	c
Bowie	c
.	c

Yes	c
!	c
!	c
!	c

I	c
could	c
n't	c
believe	c
it	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
I	c
started	c
to	c
speak	c
in	c
English	c
with	c
him	c
.	c

I	c
explained	c
to	c
him	c
where	c
was	i
the	i
street	i
that	c
he	c
was	c
looking	c
for	c
and	c
we	c
carried	c
out	i
with	c
the	c
conversation	c
for	c
a	c
while	c
.	c

I	c
thought	c
he	c
was	c
very	c
rude	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
was	c
wrong	c
,	c
he	c
is	c
n't	c
arrogant	c
at	c
all	c
and	c
he	c
looks	c
very	c
simply	i
.	c

I	c
liked	c
my	c
experience	c
with	c
him	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
the	c
best	c
part	c
was	c
when	c
he	c
gave	c
me	c
his	c
e-mail	c
address	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
not	c
joking	c
,	c
I	c
got	c
his	c
e-mail	c
.	c

I	c
'll	c
give	c
you	c
nessesserly	i
information	c
about	c
me	c
.	c

The	c
most	c
suitable	c
time	c
for	c
me	c
is	c
Jule	i
because	c
in	c
August	c
I	c
intend	c
to	c
go	c
in	i
the	c
countryside	c
,	c
where	c
I	c
have	c
a	c
small	c
farm	c
.	c

In	c
September	c
my	c
school	c
starts	c
a	c
new	c
study	c
year	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
because	c
of	c
that	c
I	c
can	c
only	c
then	i
.	c

I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
the	c
log	c
cabins	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
like	c
wet	c
places	c
like	c
tends	i
after	c
rain	c
.	c

I	c
play	c
basketball	c
and	c
tennis	c
very	c
well	c
.	c

I	c
've	c
got	i
also	i
two	c
questions	c
.	c

Please	c
let	c
me	c
know	c
!	c

I	c
'm	c
glad	c
you	c
're	c
doing	c
well	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
absolutlly	i
great	c
!	c

I	c
was	c
responsible	c
about	i
a	i
security	c
of	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
sectors	c
.	c

I	c
gave	c
information	c
about	c
correct	c
ways	c
to	c
another	i
places	c
like	c
tooletes	i
and	c
medical	c
points	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
also	c
asked	c
about	c
a	i
timetable	c
of	c
the	c
concert	c
and	c
I	c
looked	c
for	c
drugs	c
,	c
knifes	i
and	c
so	c
on	c
in	c
bags	c
.	c

Although	c
I	c
worked	c
I	c
watched	c
the	c
concert	c
.	c

OK	c
.	c

I	c
'd	c
better	c
stop	c
now	c
because	c
I	c
'm	c
going	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
a	i
library	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
so	c
suprise	i
to	c
hear	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
a	c
very	c
good	c
swimmer	c
but	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
anything	c
about	c
climbing	i
that	i
's	i
why	c
I	c
choose	i
it	c
because	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
try	c
something	c
knew	i
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
making	c
my	c
dream	c
come	c
true	c

Everyone	c
has	c
likes	c
and	c
dislikes	c
.	c

But	c
noone	i
is	i
doing	i
what	c
he	c
likes	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
.	c

Nothing	c
in	c
life	c
is	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
even	i
the	c
things	c
we	c
enjoy	c
to	i
do	i
,	c
and	c
that	c
's	c
how	c
life	c
is	c
.	c

You	c
say	c
you	c
enjoy	c
shopping	c
I	i
understand	c
but	c
life	c
goes	c
on	i
you	i
ca	c
n't	c
do	c
the	c
same	c
things	c
every	c
day	c

live	i
your	c
life	c
and	c
try	c
to	c
do	c
different	c
things	c
and	c
you	c
will	c
see	c
that	c
to	i
do	i
different	c
things	c
is	c
exciting	c
and	c
more	c
fun	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
make	c
this	c
trip	c
the	c
first	c
week	c
or	c
the	c
last	c
week	c
of	c
July	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
!	c

Yours	c
sincerly	i
,	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
where	c
to	c
start	c
but	c
I	c
can	c
say	c
it	c
was	c
the	c
greatest	i
time	c
I	c
have	c
ever	c
had	c
.	c

I	c
told	c
her	c
if	c
she	c
need	i
help	c
I	i
would	c
be	c
happy	c
to	c
help	c
her	c
.	c

It	c
took	c
us	c
almost	c
a	c
month	c
to	c
prepare	c
for	c
this	c
concert	c
.	c

You	c
would	c
n't	c
believe	c
how	c
hard	c
it	c
was	c
.	c

I	c
wish	c
you	c
were	c
there	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
the	c
title	c
'	c
International	c
Arts	c
Festival	c
'	c
is	c
very	c
suitable	c
for	c
the	c
festival	c
,	c
because	c
there	c
were	i
some	c
variety	c
of	c
features	i
in	i
it	i
.	c

While	c
you	c
stated	c
that	c
there	c
were	c
stars	c
and	c
artists	c
from	c
around	c
the	c
world	c
,	c
they	c
were	c
from	i
only	i
six	i
countries	i
in	i
fact	i
.	c

In	c
addition	c
to	c
that	c
some	c
concert	c
halls	c
were	c
too	c
small	c
to	i
enjoy	c
the	c
concerts	c
.	c

On	c
balance	c
,	c
I	c
feel	c
that	c
this	c
annual	c
festival	c
can	c
be	c
even	c
better	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

I	c
also	c
suggest	c
that	c
more	c
plays	c
and	c
films	c
should	c
be	i
taken	i
place	i
.	c

I	c
know	c
you	c
're	c
fine	i
,	c
but	c
I	c
've	c
been	c
very	c
busy	c
studying	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
exam	i
next	c
month	c
.	c

I	c
really	c
hate	c
it	c
,	c
because	c
we	c
're	c
not	c
allowed	c
to	c
wear	c
casual	c
and	c
fashonable	i
clothes	c
,	c
colourful	c
shoes	c
and	i
colourful	c
socks	c
.	c

Next	c
,	c
we	c
're	c
not	c
allowed	c
to	c
get	c
driver	i
licences	c
which	c
are	c
for	c
a	c
motorbike	c
and	c
car	c
as	c
long	c
as	c
we	i
've	i
students	c
.	c

If	c
possible	c
,	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
change	c
all	c
of	c
them	c
.	c

These	c
are	i
not	c
so	c
strict	c
that	c
I	c
can	i
stand	c
them	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
think	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
change	c
them	c
.	c

Anyway	c
,	c
that	c
's	c
all	c
about	i
my	i
information	i
which	c
you	c
want	c
.	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
I	c
must	c
tell	c
you	c
that	c
I	c
only	c
have	c
freetime	i
in	c
July	c
at	i
any	c
day	c
,	c
any	c
week	c
,	i
because	c
I	c
am	c
still	c
having	c
my	c
lesson	i
at	c
college	c
and	c
it	i
will	c
be	c
finished	c
at	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
June	c
and	i
also	c
in	c
August	c
I	c
have	c
a	c
training	c
course	c
for	c
my	c
studies	c
.	c

I	c
first	c
started	c
playing	c
basketball	c
and	c
swimming	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
aged	c
9	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
doing	c
it	i
up	c
till	c
now	c
.	c

Introduction	c

Lessons	c

It	c
seemed	c
to	c
be	c
the	c
most	c
interesting	c
lesson	c
,	c
because	c
student	i
always	c
make	c
some	c
mistake	i
while	c
they	c
are	c
practising	c
with	c
thier	i
partner	c
,	c
in	c
spite	c
of	c
having	i
told	i
from	i
teacher	i
ten	c
times	c
.	c

Spending	c
time	c
together	c
out	c
of	c
the	c
class	c
is	c
the	i
nice	c
experiance	i
.	c

Lesson	i
and	c
activities	c
,	i
which	c
most	c
student	i
suggested	c
are	c
very	c
interesting	c
and	c
it	i
is	i
not	c
seem	c
to	c
be	c
boring	c
for	c
the	c
student	i
.	c

I	c
felt	i
how	i
luck	i
I	i
was	i
.	c

I	c
understood	i
you	c
want	c
to	c
know	c
when	c
am	i
I	i
available	c
to	c
set	c
off	c
and	c
where	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
stay	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
go	c
U.S.A	i
in	i
July	c
because	c
of	c
my	c
university	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
studying	c
Economics	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
busy	c
nowadays	c
.	c

My	c
exams	c
will	c
have	c
finished	c
at	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
June	c
.	c

This	c
holiday	c
will	c
help	c
me	c
to	c
think	c
and	i
prepare	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
used	c
to	c
climb	c
mountains	c
and	c
am	c
good	c
at	c
climbing	c
.	c

Will	c
you	c
provide	c
me	c
an	i
instructor	c
when	c
I	c
climb	c
and	c
swim	c
?	c

I	c
have	c
n't	c
written	c
you	i
for	c
ages	c
.	c

How	c
is	c
your	c
new	c
school	c
and	c
parents	i
?	c

I	c
hope	c
we	c
can	c
catch	c
up	c
with	c
each	c
other	c
's	c
news	c
.	c

Last	c
month	c
I	c
helped	c
the	c
service	c
crew	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
.	c

Being	c
a	c
security	c
guard	c
was	c
the	c
hardest	c
task	c
.	c

Carrying	c
big	c
speakers	c
place	i
to	c
place	c
was	c
extremely	c
tiring	c
but	c
we	c
had	c
loads	c
of	c
laugh	i
.	c

Believe	c
it	c
or	c
not	c
I	i
put	c
make	i
up	i
on	c
one	c
famous	c
singer	c
's	c
face	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
just	c
walking	c
down	c
by	c
dressing	i
room	c
manager	i
said	i
that	i
if	c
I	c
could	c
help	c
them	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
in	c
her	c
room	c
and	i
helping	c
her	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c

I	c
like	i
to	c
answer	c
the	c
questions	c
you	c
request	i
from	i
me	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
should	c
say	c
that	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
of	i
this	i
is	c
the	c
month	c
wich	i
I	c
could	c
more	i
likely	c
have	c
off	c
at	i
work	c
for	i
going	i
on	c
holiday	c
.	c

On	i
the	i
other	i
hand	i
,	i
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
some	c
imformation	i
wich	i
could	c
be	c
useful	c
in	i
my	c
holiday	c
like	c
:	c
which	i
type	c
of	c
clothes	c
could	i
be	c
more	c
suitable	c
for	c
me	c
in	c
the	c
Camp	c
?	c

Do	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
bring	c
something	i
else	c
?	c

That	i
was	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
with	c
lots	c
of	c
famous	c
singers	c
like	c
Madona	c
,	c
Julio	c
Iglesias	c
,	c
and	c
people	c
like	c
them	c

That	i
was	c
a	c
charity	c
concert	c
to	c
save	i
money	c
to	i
poor	c
people	c
of	i
AFRICA	c
.	c

My	c
job	c
it	i
was	c
to	c
accomodate	i
to	i
the	i
people	i
of	i
the	i
main	i
sit	i
of	i
the	i
theathre	i
.	c

I	c
really	c
enjoyed	c
it	c
and	c
also	c
I	c
did	c
not	c
miss	c
the	c
opportunity	c
to	c
ask	c
the	c
artist	c
to	c
take	i
a	i
photho	i
with	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
,	i
it	c
was	c
very	c
cleaver	i
of	c
me	c
to	c
record	c
that	c
moment	c
wich	i
I	c
will	c
never	c
ever	c
forget	c
,	c
and	c
that	c
was	c
the	c
think	i
that	c
I	c
more	i
liked	i
of	i
that	c
experience	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
think	i
it	i
's	i
not	i
professional	c
to	c
change	c
the	c
principal	c
actor	c
in	i
the	c
last	c
minute	c
,	c
the	c
play	c
should	c
be	i
with	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
to	c
this	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
instead	c
19:30	i
,	c
more	c
45	i
minutes	c
in	i
late	c
...	c

It	c
should	c
be	i
a	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
the	c
opposite	c
.	c

It	i
's	i
why	c
,	c
it	i
would	c
be	c
grateful	c
,	i
if	c
you	c
could	c
give	c
me	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
in	c
the	c
very	c
near	c
future	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

How	c
has	c
modern	c
technology	c
changed	c
your	c
daily	c
life	c
?	c

Nowadays	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
could	i
be	c
impossible	c
for	c
us	c
to	c
live	c
like	c
our	c
grand-parents	i
or	c
great	i
grand-parents	i
lived	c
...	c
we	c
are	c
too	c
lazy	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
's	c
not	c
our	c
mistake	i
,	c
this	c
revolution	c
is	c
called	c
"	c
progress	c
"	c
!	c

we	c
do	c
n't	c
think	c
that	c
there	i
is	i
less	c
of	i
a	c
hundred	c
years	c
,	i
nothing	i
of	c
that	c
existed	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
to	c
this	c
,	c
thinking	i
also	i
,	i
to	i
the	i
medicine	i
,	i
science	i
or	i
astronomy	i
progress	i
...	c

Dear	c
Miss	c
,	c

I	c
have	c
just	c
been	c
there	c
and	c
noticed	i
some	c
points	i
which	c
could	c
make	c
the	c
festival	c
better	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
the	c
festival	c
was	c
a	c
great	c
idea	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
they	c
held	c
some	c
concerts	c
,	c
but	c
some	c
concert	i
halls	c
were	c
so	c
small	c
that	c
there	c
was	c
not	c
enough	c
space	c
for	c
the	i
people	c
.	c

We	c
would	c
be	c
pleased	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
have	c
more	c
.	c

I	c
suggest	c
you	c
have	c
a	c
oneday	i
ticket	c
or	c
a	c
reasonable	i
ticket	c
for	c
every	c
event	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
be	c
grateful	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
think	c
about	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
very	c
happy	c
to	c
know	c
you	c
're	c
pretty	i
well	c
.	c

Speaking	c
of	c
rules	c
,	c
most	c
of	c
them	c
are	c
annoying	c
!	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
girls	c
must	c
keep	c
the	c
length	c
of	c
the	i
skirt	i
by	i
5	c
cm	c
under	i
their	c
knees	c
.	c

And	c
also	c
we	c
're	c
not	c
allowed	c
to	c
bring	c
any	c
sweets	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
house	c
,	c
I	c
'm	c
allowed	c
to	c
do	c
anything	c
unless	c
it	c
bothers	c
somebody	c
.	c

But	c
there	c
's	c
one	c
thing	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
stand	c
up	i
.	c

I	c
'm	c
not	c
allowed	c
to	c
go	c
out	c
late	c
at	c
night	c
.	c

You	c
're	c
allowed	c
to	c
do	c
that	c
,	c
are	c
n't	c
you	c
?	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

Concerning	c
to	i
the	c
activities	c
which	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
choose	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
inform	c
you	c
that	c
I	c
am	c
fond	c
of	c
photography	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
quite	c
good	c
in	i
it	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
attended	c
a	c
relevant	c
course	c
for	c
three	c
months	c
.	c

specific	c
equipment	c
or	c
anything	c
else	c
)	c
.	c

Is	c
it	c
true	c
or	c
not	c
?	c

Some	c
people	c
agree	c
with	c
it	c
,	c
some	c
people	c
not	i
.	c

Shopping	c
is	c
a	c
good	c
way	c
to	c
kill	c
your	i
time	c
and	c
some	i
times	i
you	c
can	i
not	c
realize	c
how	c
fast	c
the	c
time	c
goes	c
.	c

Otherwise	c
If	i
you	c
are	c
in	c
a	c
good	c
mood	c
it	c
will	c
turn	c
into	c
a	c
bad	c
mood	c
.	c

You	c
should	c
avoid	c
the	c
peak	c
times	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
really	c
surprise	i
to	c
hear	c
that	c
.	c

The	c
accommodation	c
I	c
prefer	c
is	c
tent	i
.	c

I	c
love	c
it	c
very	c
much	c
.	c

What	c
kinds	c
of	c
clothes	c
shall	i
I	c
take	c
?	c
how	i
about	c
the	c
weather	c
there	c
?	c

From	c
:	c
Jia	c
Lo	c

2	c
.	c

Let	i
you	c
do	i
more	c
pratices	i
.	c

3	c
.	c

4	c
.	c

Students	c
are	i
talking	i
to	c
each	c
other	c
when	c
they	c
are	c
having	c
break	i
.	c

Teacher	i
are	i
helping	i
students	c
with	c
their	c
problems	c
.	c

In	c
Conclusion	c
,	c
the	c
short	c
video	c
is	c
only	c
60	c
minutes	c
.	c

It	c
should	c
include	c
all	c
those	c
points	c
lists	c
above	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
as	c
regards	c
the	c
letter	c
you	c
've	c
sent	c
me	c
about	c
the	c
competition	c
I	c
've	c
won	c
.	c

I	c
've	c
never	c
been	c
to	c
the	c
U.S.A.	c
before	c
so	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
'll	c
be	c
an	c
exciting	c
trip	c
.	c

With	c
regard	c
to	c
the	c
date	c
of	c
the	c
trip	c
,	c
July	c
would	c
be	c
best	c
because	c
in	c
June	c
I	c
'm	c
going	c
to	c
visit	c
my	c
family	c
in	c
Mexico	c
and	c
in	c
August	c
school	c
begins	c
.	c

I	c
've	c
never	c
been	c
camping	c
before	c
,	c
I	c
guess	c
I	c
'm	c
not	c
an	c
outdoor	c
girl	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
give	c
it	c
a	c
try	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
'd	c
rather	c
tents	c
than	c
cabins	c
.	c

I	c
've	c
practised	i
sailing	c
since	c
an	c
early	c
age	c
and	c
I	c
perfectly	i
manage	i
the	i
rigging	i
and	i
sail	i
.	c

I	c
'm	c
also	c
fond	c
of	c
tennis	c
,	c
I	c
've	c
just	c
started	c
my	c
lessons	c
and	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
continue	c
practising	i
during	c
the	c
summer	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
I	c
'll	c
do	c
sailing	c
and	c
tennis	c
.	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c

For	c
instance	c
,	c
I	c
spent	c
my	c
Spring	c
Break	c
with	c
my	c
friends	c
in	c
Italy	c
,	i
we	i
went	c
there	c
to	c
buy	c
our	c
dresses	c
for	c
our	c
boyfriends	c
'	c
graduation	c
(	c
besides	c
other	c
reasons	c
)	c
.	c

While	c
we	c
were	c
in	c
Florence	c
my	c
wallet	c
was	c
stolen	c
,	c
probably	c
by	c
a	c
gypsie	i
.	c

I	c
was	c
so	c
annoyed	c
!	c

My	c
friends	c
lent	c
me	c
some	c
money	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
more	c
than	c
120	c
pounds	c
.	c

I	c
felt	c
really	c
bad	c
seeing	c
my	c
friends	c
buy	c
the	c
latest	c
fashion	c
while	c
the	c
only	c
thing	c
I	c
could	c
do	c
was	c
tell	c
them	c
how	c
great	c
their	c
clothes	c
were	c
and	c
of	c
course	c
window-shop	c
.	c

For	c
the	c
trip	c
to	c
California	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
only	c
go	c
in	c
July	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
afraid	c
,	c
because	c
my	c
English	c
course	c
finishes	c
in	c
June	c
and	c
it	c
starts	c
again	c
in	c
August	c
.	c

Although	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
done	c
surfing	c
before	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
quite	c
advanced	c
swimmer	c
.	c

Finally	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
some	c
questions	c
.	c

What	c
is	c
the	c
weather	c
like	c
over	c
there	c
and	c
what	c
should	c
I	c
wear	c
?	c

How	c
much	c
money	c
would	c
I	c
need	c
?	c

How	c
big	c
is	c
the	c
camp	c
?	c

Shopping	c
is	c
very	c
important	c
because	c
it	c
's	c
the	c
only	c
way	c
to	c
get	c
things	c
.	c

But	c
buying	c
things	c
that	c
do	i
not	c
need	c
or	c
you	c
have	c
not	c
planned	c
to	c
might	c
make	c
you	c
feel	c
good	c
at	c
the	c
time	c
,	c
but	c
days	c
or	c
weeks	c
later	c
when	c
you	c
realise	c
you	c
did	c
not	c
need	c
to	c
spend	c
money	c
on	c
them	c
,	c
you	c
might	c
regret	c
buying	c
them	c
.	c

But	c
after	i
you	c
never	c
eat	c
them	c
and	c
just	c
bin	c
them	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
buying	c
things	c
needed	c
and	c
planned	c
could	c
be	c
enjoyable	c
but	c
buying	c
things	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
need	c
or	c
unplanned	c
,	c
might	c
make	c
you	c
feel	c
sad	c
after	c
sometime	i
.	c

It	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
pleasure	c
to	c
us	c
and	c
to	c
your	c
husband	c
to	c
come	c
at	i
the	c
party	c
.	c

We	c
think	c
the	i
suitable	c
time	c
will	c
be	c
3-6	c
p.m.	c
You	c
can	c
come	c
earlier	c
,	c
if	c
you	c
want	c
.	c

Can	c
you	c
help	c
us	c
?	c

We	c
want	c
something	c
that	c
it	i
would	i
like	i
him	i
or	c
would	i
be	c
necessary	c
.	c

Please	c
try	c
to	c
come	c
and	c
help	c
us	c
to	i
this	c
problem	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

Suddenly	c
the	c
bell	c
rings	i
.	c

The	c
first	c
good	c
new	i
was	c
that	c
we	c
both	c
had	c
passed	c
the	c
exams	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
a	i
wonderful	c
new	i
.	c

The	c
second	c
new	i
was	c
that	c
he	c
had	c
found	c
a	c
job	c
for	c
the	c
summer	c
.	c

As	c
a	c
result	c
I	c
had	c
a	i
work	c
too	c
.	c

We	c
imagine	c
that	c
would	i
be	c
the	c
best	c
holidays	i
in	i
our	c
life	c
.	c

13/6/2000-11-07	c

We	c
prefer	i
the	c
last	c
two	c
weeks	c
on	i
July	c
.	c

Is	c
there	c
a	c
possibility	i
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
.	c

Im	i
not	c
so	c
good	c
as	c
her	c
,	c
but	c
I	i
'm	i
going	i
every	i
week	i
once	i
to	c
her	c
training	c
.	i

In	i
Golf	i
,	c
we	c
are	c
both	c
total	c
beginners	c
.	c

Are	i
there	c
some	i
possibility	c
to	i
rent	i
the	i
golfshoes	i
?	c

Finally	c
,	c
we	c
like	i
to	c
know	c
,	i
when	c
you	c
will	c
send	c
us	c
the	c
airline-tickets	i
and	c
the	c

You	c
are	c
interessted	i
on	i
my	c
last	c
job	c
!	c

I	c
really	c
like	i
to	c
tell	c
you	c
all	c
my	i
experience	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
'm	c
happy	c
that	c
we	c
finished	i
this	c
hard	c
work	c
.	c

For	c
me	c
was	i
this	i
aventure	i
one	i
of	i
the	i
Best	i
.	c

Leon	c

As	c
you	c
asked	c
me	c
some	c
questions	c
,	c
here	c
are	c
the	c
answers	c
.	c

It	c
would	c
be	c
very	c
convenient	c
if	c
I	c
could	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
,	c
because	c
by	c
that	c
time	c
I	c
'll	c
be	c
on	c
my	c
school	c
holidays	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
agree	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
tent	c
as	i
accommodation	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
stayed	c
in	c
one	c
and	c
I	c
wonder	c
this	i
might	c
be	c
a	c
great	c
feeling	c
and	c
that	i
this	c
way	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
in	c
a	i
deeper	i
contact	c
with	c
the	c
animals	c
that	c
live	c
in	c
the	c
area	c
.	c

It	c
would	c
be	c
very	c
pleasant	c
if	c
I	c
could	c
join	c
your	c
basketball	c
team	c
,	c
since	c
I	c
used	c
to	c
play	c
it	i
in	c
my	c
school	c
's	c
team	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
I	c
'm	c
pretty	c
good	c
at	c
it	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

Some	c
people	c
usually	c
spend	c
more	c
money	c
than	c
they	c
have	c
and	c
end	c
up	c
broken	i
,	c
with	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
bills	c
to	c
pay	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
if	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
those	c
spending	c
sprees	c
very	c
often	c
,	c
shopping	c
can	c
be	c
a	c
pleasant	c
experience	c
and	c
a	c
chance	c
to	c
spend	c
some	c
quality	c
time	c
with	c
your	c
family	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
answered	c
no	c
,	c
congratulations	c
.	c

But	c
if	c
you	c
took	c
a	c
deep	c
breath	c
after	c
reading	c
the	c
question	c
,	c
do	c
n't	c
worry	c
.	c

But	c
do	c
n't	c
be	c
afraid	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
are	c
a	c
good	c
observer	c
,	c
it	c
's	c
a	c
great	c
chance	c
to	c
know	i
what	c
your	c
son	c
or	c
daughter	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
have	c
for	c
her	i
birthday	c
or	c
for	c
any	c
other	c
special	c
date	i
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
if	c
you	c
think	c
that	c
you	c
'll	c
be	i
on	i
the	i
red	i
,	c
I	i
'd	i
better	c
stay	c
at	c
home	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

Furthermore	c
the	c
show	c
should	c
have	c
started	c
at	c
19.30	c
but	c
instead	c
it	c
began	c
at	c
20:15	c
which	i
was	c
really	c
unpleasant	c
.	c

At	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
the	c
show	c
I	c
was	c
so	c
tired	c
that	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
eat	c
something	c
at	c
your	c
restaurant	c
,	c
but	c
surprisingly	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
due	c
to	c
some	c
unreasonable	i
technical	c
problems	c
!	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
:	c
he	c
always	c
wanted	c
to	c
know	c
everything	c
about	c
everybody	c
and	c
after	i
,	c
of	c
course	c
,	c
he	c
would	c
give	c
away	c
all	c
he	c
knew	c
,	c
but	c
one	c
day	c
he	c
had	c
some	c
problems	c
...	c

His	c
best	c
friend	c
Paul	c
could	c
n't	c
put	c
up	c
anymore	c
with	c
Pat	c
always	c
revealing	c
his	c
secrets	c
,	c
so	c
decided	i
to	c
play	c
a	c
trick	c
on	c
him	c
.	c

Paul	c
told	c
Pat	c
not	c
to	c
tell	c
anyone	c
about	c
Madonna	c
and	c
especially	c
to	i
the	c
press	c
.	c

Pat	c
obviously	c
could	c
n't	c
help	i
being	i
silent	c
about	c
this	c
so	c
,	c
since	c
he	c
also	c
needed	c
some	c
money	c
,	c
he	c
decided	c
to	c
reveal	c
everything	c
to	c
the	c
scandalistic	i
press	c
,	c
not	c
knowing	c
that	c
Paul	c
had	c
made	c
up	c
all	i
the	i
story	c
!	c

Paul	c
finally	c
had	c
his	c
revenge	c
!	c
!	c

Dear	c
Mr.	c
Smith	c

Everything	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
wrong	i
.	c

There	c
were	c
not	i
discounts	c
available	c
for	c
the	c
tickets	c
and	c
the	c
theatre	c
's	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
too	c
late	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
want	c
you	c
to	c
send	c
me	c
some	c
money	c
back	c
for	c
that	c
unpleasent	i
night	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
can	c
understand	c
me	c
.	c

The	c
headmaster	c
wanted	c
to	c
tell	c
the	c
police	c
what	c
we	c
had	c
done	c
so	c
we	c
decided	c
to	c
close	i
him	c
in	c
a	c
little	c
house	c
,	i
we	c
had	c
twenty	c
kilometers	i
far	i
from	c
the	c
village	c
until	c
we	c
could	c
change	c
his	c
opinion	i
.	c

Marc	c
,	c
one	c
of	c
my	c
friends	c
,	c
hit	c
Mr.	c
Heyman	c
with	c
a	c
bottle	c
and	c
he	c
lost	c
his	i
conscience	i
.	c

We	c
took	c
some	c
photos	c
of	c
him	c
naked	c
and	c
told	c
him	c
not	c
to	c
tell	i
this	i
anybody	i
because	c
if	c
he	c
does	c
we	c
will	c
hang	c
the	c
photos	c
all	c
arround	i
the	c
village	c
.	c

He	c
accepted	c
and	i
we	c
left	i
him	c
free	i
.	c

Everything	i
began	c
because	c
he	c
is	c
a	c
nasty	c
person	c
and	c
he	c
forced	c
us	c
to	c
clean	c
the	c
college	c
every	c
day	c
,	c
for	i
not	i
paying	i
a	c
cleaning	i
assistant	i
.	c

We	c
need	i
to	c
do	c
something	c
like	c
that	c
to	c
make	c
him	c
change	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
glad	i
I	c
have	c
won	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
the	c
competition	c
-	c
two	c
weeks	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
in	c
the	c
U.S.A	c
.	c

Tents	c
are	c
very	c
easy	c
to	c
take	i
and	c
go	i
everywhere	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
good	c
at	c
singing	c
and	c
photography	c
.	c

I	c
like	c
taking	c
photograph	i
,	c
in	i
my	i
only	i
room	i

There	c
are	c
all	c
kinds	c
of	c
photos	c
,	c
for	c
example	c
,	c
beach	i
,	c
sea	c
trees	i
and	c
so	c
on	c
.	c

In	i
the	i
end	i
,	c
I	c
wonder	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
should	c
take	c
and	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
should	c
bring	c
with	c
me	c

I	c

In	c

I	c
interviewed	c
about	c
one	c
hundred	c
students	c
who	c
are	c
studying	c
in	c
our	c
English	c
class	c
.	c

The	c

a	c

something	c
about	c

Two	c

we	c

Conclusion	c

It	c
is	c
recommended	c
that	c
should	i
be	c

about	c
Maths	c

English	c

up	i
and	c
a	i

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
introduce	c
myself	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
Francesco	c
Schein	c
,	c
I	c
'm	c
18	c
years	c
old	c
and	c
I	c
went	c
last	c
week	c
to	c
see	c
your	c
musical	c
show	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
.	c

First	c
the	c
actor	c
was	c
changed	c
and	c
his	c
performance	i
was	c
very	c
poor	c
and	c
disappointing	c
.	c

Then	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
began	c
45	c
minutes	c
later	i
,	c
so	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
wait	c
very	i
long	c
.	i

I	c
hope	c
you	c
understand	c
your	c
faults	i
and	c
I	c
'm	c
asking	c
you	c
for	c
the	i
money	c
back	c
.	c

There	c
are	c
some	c
machines	c
which	c
have	c
helped	c
in	c
my	c
development	c
,	c
and	c
others	c
which	c
help	c
me	c
to	c
make	c
my	c
life	c
easier	c
.	c

Many	c
industries	c
throw	c
their	c
contaminated	c
air	c
away	c
,	c
without	c
cleaning	c
it	c
before	i
.	c

In	c
reference	c
about	i
the	c
date	c
of	c
the	i
travel	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
at	c
the	c
moment	c
I	c
am	c
working	c
at	c
the	i
University	c
and	c
I	c
only	c
have	c
July	c
to	c
take	c
my	c
holidays	c
.	c

As	c
state	i
in	c
your	c
letter	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
choose	c
the	c
accommodation	i
type	i
.	i

I	c
have	c
choosen	i
these	c
activities	c
because	c
actually	i
I	c
am	c
playing	c
with	i
university	i
team	c
,	c
and	c
photography	c
is	c
my	c
favoorate	i
hobby	c
.	c

Finally	c
let	c
me	c
know	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
will	c
be	c
the	c
most	c
suitable	c
at	c
camp	c

Is	c
necesarilly	i

the	c
concert	c
,	i
obviously	i
I	c
accepted	c
.	c

Now	c
I	c
can	c
tell	c
you	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
an	c
amaizing	i
challange	i
for	c
me	c
because	c
I	c
never	i
did	i
anything	c
like	c
that	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
see	c
last	c
Wednesday	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
told	c
I	c
would	c
have	c
the	c
most	c
perfect	c
evening	c
in	c
London	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
.	c

My	c
surprise	c
was	c
when	c
,	c
instead	c
of	c
Mr.	c
Brook	c
,	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
appeared	c
on	c
stage	c
.	c

At	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
the	c
show	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
but	c
when	c
I	c
arrived	c
I	c
realized	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
the	c
musical	i
show	c
had	c
finished	c
too	c
late	c
!	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Some	c
days	c
ago	c
Pat	c
met	c
her	c
friend	c
Paul	c
,	c
the	c
editor	c
of	c
the	c
school	c
's	c
newspaper	c
.	c

But	c
,	c
suddenly	c
,	c
she	c
started	c
to	c
talk	c
about	c
Marion	c
's	c
toys	c
.	c

Two	c
weeks	c
later	c
everybody	c
forbade	i
about	c
Marion	c
's	c
secret	c
and	c
she	c
took	i
into	i
account	i
her	c
relationship	c
with	c
Pat	c
.	c

.	c

Now	c
I	c
am	c
planning	c
to	c
be	c
a	c
good	c
photographer	c
.	c

last	c
year	c
.	c

The	c
students	c
at	c
school	c
shoud	c
n't	c
be	c
shy	c
,	c
because	c
they	i
have	i
estercotipie	i
inside	i
in	i
some	i
issues	i
,	i
that	i
confuses	i
them	i
the	i
means	i
of	i
things	i
.	c

But	c
the	c
best	c
thing	c
that	c
we	c
do	c
,	c
when	c
we	c
make	i
shopp	i
is	c
spend	c
the	i
time	c
having	c
lunch	c
at	c
snack	i
bar	c
,	c
watching	c
cinema	i
and	c
play	i
games	i

Hello	c
Kim	c
,	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
happy	c
to	c
know	i
that	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
and	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
a	c
good	c
opportunity	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
U.S.A	c
.	c

If	c
it	c
is	c
possible	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
.	c

I	c
will	c
be	c
working	c
until	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
June	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
going	c
to	c
start	c
university	c
in	c
August	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
sleep	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
,	c
because	c
,	c
in	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
easier	c
to	c
make	c
friends	c
and	c
I	c
like	c
camping	c
as	c
well	c
.	c

Can	c
you	c
tell	c
me	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
,	c
if	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
winter	c
clothes	c
and	c
if	c
it	c
is	c
possible	c
to	c
rent	c
a	c
car	c
there	c
.	i

Some	c
people	c
when	c
they	c
are	c
tired	c
relax	c
spleeping	i
,	c
reading	c
a	c
book	c
or	c
watching	c
television	c
but	i
not	c
me	c
.	c

Walking	c
along	c
the	c
crowded	c
streets	c
of	c
my	c
city	c
is	c
my	c
way	c
of	c
relaxing	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
to	c
explain	c
how	i
was	i
my	i
experience	i
in	i
the	c
theatre	c
last	c
Friday	c
.	c

Thirdly	c
,	c
I	c
did	c
not	c
receive	i
any	c
kind	c
of	c
discounts	i
when	c
I	c
payed	i
although	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
it	c
was	c
written	c
.	i

I	c
think	c
that	c
if	c
the	c
musical	i
show	c
will	i
begin	i
later	c
the	c
restaurant	c
should	c
close	c
later	c
,	c
too	c
!	c

Finally	c
,	c
from	i
my	i
point	i
of	i
view	i
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
receive	i
the	c
money	c
that	c
I	c
payed	i
because	c
it	i
was	c
not	c
the	i
same	i
as	i
you	c
offered	i
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
when	c
you	c
explain	i
a	c
secret	c
you	c
must	c
be	c
sure	c
that	c
you	c
have	c
chose	i
the	c
best	c
person	c
to	c
keep	c
it	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
was	c
fourteen	c
years	c
old	c
some	c
things	c
changed	c
.	c

But	c
,	c
instead	c
there	c
was	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
,	c
who	c
I	c
never	i
heard	i
about	i
before	c
!	c

While	c
we	c
were	c
waiting	c
for	c
the	c
show	c
to	c
start	c
,	c
we	c
were	c
thinking	c
of	c
going	c
to	c
the	c
restaurant	c
.	c

In	i
fact	i
,	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
the	c
whole	c
evening	c
,	c
because	c
of	c
some	c
work	c
.	i

I	c
'm	c
really	c
upset	c
and	c
disappointed	c
after	c
all	c
this	c
and	c
at	i
least	i
I	i
want	i
my	c
money	c
back	c
!	c

I	c
belong	c
to	c
this	i
generation	c
who	c
had	i
grown	c
up	c
with	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
different	i
technolgy	i
.	c

For	c
example	c
TV	i
,	c
telephone	c
,	c
micrown	i
etc.	c
But	c
the	i
last	c
few	c
years	c
,	c
it	i
has	c
change	i
and	c
so	c
many	c
new	c
important	c
things	c
had	i
been	c
discovered	i
.	c

What	c
I	c
'm	c
talking	c
about	c
are	c
the	c
computer	i
,	c
which	c
now	c
can	c
be	c
found	c
in	c
almost	c
every	c
home	c
and	i
of	i
course	c
,	c
the	c
mobile	c
phone	c
!	c

I	c
tought	i
I	c
would	c
never	c
need	c
a	c
mobile	c
phone	c
,	c
but	c
my	c
mum	c
and	c
dad	c
gave	c
me	c
one	c
for	c
Christmas	c
last	c
year	c
and	c
now	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
live	c
without	c
it	c
!	c

It	c
's	c
so	c
quick	c
and	c
not	c
too	c
expensive	c
either	c
.	c

I	c
usually	c
use	c
it	c
for	c
sending	c
SMS	c
Messages	c
to	c
my	c
friends	c

Karol	c
Johannes	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

Last	c
month	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
with	c
my	c
husband	c
to	c
see	c
OVER	c
THE	c
RAINBOW	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
sorry	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
very	c
unpleasant	c
evening	c
.	c

I	c
felt	c
so	c
angry	c
about	c
that	c
.	c

He	c
is	c
a	c
good	c
actor	c
but	c
I	c
saw	c
a	c
very	c
bad	c
one	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

And	c
Lorca	c
knew	c
it	c
.	c

But	c
Pat	c
was	c
in	c
the	i
wrong	i
place	i
in	i
the	i
incorrect	i
hour	i
.	c

Her	c
family	c
was	c
very	c
rich	c
and	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
men	c
wanted	c
to	c
marry	c
to	c
her	c
.	c

And	c
Pat	c
,	c
the	c
maid	c
,	c
saw	c
them	c
in	c
the	c
river	c
.	c

She	c
could	c
n't	c
keep	c
the	c
secret	c
and	c
told	c
everything	c
to	c
another	c
maid	c
.	c

In	c
few	i
hours	c
everyone	c
knew	c
it	c
.	c

Pour	i
lovers	c
!	c

Then	c
,	c
she	c
cried	c
and	c
cried	c
holding	i
him	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
shock	c
for	c
Lorca	c
.	c

How	c
could	c
they	c
forget	c
it	c
?	c

Dear	c
Mrs.	c
Ryan	c
:	c

Second	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
rather	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
tend	c
to	c
get	c
very	c
nervous	c
in	c
small	c
closed	c
places	c
,	c
so	c
a	c
tent	c
would	c
be	c
unapropriate	i
for	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
n't	c
played	c
golf	c
for	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
,	c
so	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
pleasent	i
to	c
do	c
so	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
been	c
surfing	c
for	c
five	c
years	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
competed	c
in	c
two	c
championships	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
would	c
you	c
recommend	c
me	i
to	i
take	i
.	c

I	c
have	c
never	c
been	c
to	c
California	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
have	c
no	c
idea	c
about	c
the	c
weather	c
there	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
start	c
at	c
ten	c
,	c
but	c
when	c
the	c
band	c
was	c
going	c
on	c
stage	c
,	c
the	c
leader	i
of	i
it	i
fell	c
down	c
on	c
some	c
wires	c
that	c
gave	c
the	c
power	c
to	c
all	c
the	c
instruments	c
and	c
all	c
the	c
lights	c
!	c

Suddenly	c
,	c
everything	c
got	c
very	c
dark	c
.	c

He	c
asked	c
me	c
to	c
help	c
Bono	c
,	c
the	c
leader	i
,	c
get	c
up	c
and	c
to	c
get	c
him	c
some	c
water	c
.	c

What	c
I	c
liked	c
was	c
that	c
I	c
had	c
the	c
chance	c
to	c
help	c
my	c
idol	c
and	c
to	c
talk	c
to	c
him	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
was	c
not	c
acting	c
,	c
there	c
was	c
another	c
unknown	i
actor	c
and	c
he	c
was	c
not	c
good	c
.	c

Above	i
these	i
the	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
of	c
water	i
leakage	i
.	c

I	c
had	c
thought	c
about	c
it	c
for	c
many	c
years	c
but	c
never	c
been	c
able	c
to	c
fulfill	i
my	c
dreams	c
.	c

However	c
I	i
was	c
n't	c
sure	c
if	c
my	c
decision	c
was	c
right	c
and	c
therefore	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
discuss	c
it	c
with	c
Pat	c
.	c

It	i
is	c
now	c
twenty	c
years	c
ago	c
.	c

She	c
really	c
listen	i
to	c
me	c
and	c
told	c
me	c
that	c
I	c
did	i
the	c
right	c
thing	c
and	c
persuaded	c
me	c
to	c
send	c
in	c
my	c
application	c
for	i
an	i
language	c
course	c
in	c
England	c
.	c

But	c
it	c
is	c
ok	i
,	c
I	c
still	c
like	c
Pat	c
,	c
even	c
though	c
she	c
ca	c
n't	c
keep	c
a	c
secret	c
.	c

Hello	i
Helen	c
,	c

I	c
will	c
answer	c
your	c
questions	c
in	c
this	c
letter	c
begining	i
with	c

for	c
the	i
Camp	i
.	c

Because	c
of	c
my	c
study	i
I	c
will	c
not	c
be	c
free	c

july	i
and	c
schools	c
goes	i
on	i
in	c
August	c
again	i
so	c
I	c
hope	c
July	c
will	c
be	c
fine	c
.	c

Choosing	c
only	c
two	c
activities	c
in	i
such	c
a	c
bunch	i
of	c
interesting	c
ones	c
was	c
quite	c
hard	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
take	i
the	c
two	c
I	c
've	c
never	c
tried	c
,	c
Climbing	i
and	i
Surfing	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
should	i
I	i
bring	c
and	c
wether	i
I	c
can	c
wash	c
it	i
or	c
not	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
will	i
I	i
need	c
for	c
extras	c

Andre	c
Michel	c

Hello	c
Kim	c
,	c

I	c
wrote	c
you	i
last	c
time	c
that	c
I	c
was	c
going	c
to	c
give	i
a	i
hand	i
for	i
the	c
installation	c
and	c
preparation	c
of	c
"	c
Garbage	c
's	c
"	c
concert	c
and	c
you	c
asked	c
me	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
how	c
it	c
has	i
been	i
.	c

So	c
one	c
week	c
befor	i
the	c
concert	c
I	c
went	c
at	i
"	c
L'Arena	c
"	c
to	c
meet	c
the	c
other	c
worker	c
and	c
receive	c
the	c
instructions	c
.	c

That	c
's	c
a	c
great	c
experienc	i
!	c

Now	c
Kim	c
,	c
tell	c
me	c
about	c
your	i
side	i
of	i
the	i
show	i

Yours	c
Andre	i

I	c
am	c
writing	c
in	c
reply	c
to	c
your	c
letter	c
,	c
which	c
I	c
have	i
received	i
last	c
week	c
,	c
and	c
in	c
fact	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
surprised	c
and	c
please	i
for	i
the	c
prize	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
is	i
my	c
free	i
month	c
since	i
I	c
am	c
student	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
busy	c
during	i
all	c
year	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
according	i
to	i
accommodation	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
long	i
cabin	c
,	c
due	i
to	i
I	c
used	c
to	c
use	c
the	i
tent	c
on	c
holiday	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
n't	c
got	i
very	i
good	i
experiences	i
.	c

Thirdly	c
I	c
chose	c
photography	c
and	c
swimming	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
previous	c
experience	c
in	c
these	c
activities	c
and	c
of	c
course	c
I	c
have	c
some	c
diplomas	c
which	c
I	c
will	c
send	c
you	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
if	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
bring	c
only	c
light	c
clothes	c
or	c
both	c
.	i

On	i
the	i
other	i
hand	i
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
request	c
all	i
details	i
of	i
accommodation	c
and	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
specifie	i
what	c
this	c
trip	c
includes	c
,	c
since	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
know	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

I	c
found	c
this	c
opportunity	c
through	c
the	c
Radio	c
in	c
an	c
advertisement	c
.	c

But	c
later	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
call	c
them	c
and	c
ask	c
them	c
for	c
further	c
information	c
about	c
this	c
job	c
.	c

After	c
a	i
interview	c
I	c
was	c
chosen	c
for	c
it	i
,	i
I	c
could	c
n't	c
believe	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
feel	c
that	c
this	c
was	c
a	c
good	c
oportunity	i
for	c
me	c
,	c
not	c
only	c
for	c
my	c
professional	c
but	c
also	c
for	c
my	c
personal	c
life	c
.	c

According	i
to	i
my	i
job	i
,	i
I	c
had	c
to	c
help	c
the	c
teams	c
with	c
the	c
outlights	c
and	c
of	i
course	c
it	i
had	i
been	i
my	c
first	c
proffesional	i
experience	c
:	c
at	i
the	i
end	i
I	c
felt	c
a	i
member	i
of	c
them	c
,	c
because	c
they	c
were	c
so	c
kind	c
to	c
me	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
could	c
colaborated	i
a	c
lot	c
of	i
and	c
I	c
learnt	c
a	c
lot	c
with	c
this	c
project	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
to	c
hear	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

Dear	c
manager	c

My	c
name	c
is	c
Lisa	c
and	c
I	c
'm	c
21	c
years	c
old	c
.	c

Then	c
I	c
was	c
sitted	i
with	c
my	c
friend	c
just	c
waiting	c
for	c
the	c
start	c
that	i
lasted	c
forever	c
and	c
was	i
supposed	c
to	c
start	c
at	c
19:30	c
.	c

Despite	c
the	c
fact	c
that	c
she	c
was	c
my	c
best	c
friend	c
I	c
could	c
never	c
count	c
on	c
her	c
or	c
she	c
would	c
tell	c
everybody	c
in	c
high	c
school	c
all	c
my	c
secrets	c
.	c

Once	c
,	c
when	c
we	c
first	c
met	c
I	i
was	c
about	c
15	c
and	c
she	c
was	c
the	c
same	c
age	c
,	c
we	c
started	c
talking	c
and	c
by	c
the	c
time	c
we	i
found	c
out	c
a	i
very	c
good	c
friendship	c
on	i
our	c
conversation	c
.	c

People	c
would	i
be	i
starring	i
at	c
me	c
and	c
laughing	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
tell	c
her	c
my	c
secrets	c
anymore	c
.	c

On	i
June	c
and	c
August	c
,	c
so	c
that	c
's	c
the	c
only	c
time	c
when	c
I	c
can	c
travel	c
there	c
.	c

I	c
prefer	c
that	c
kind	c
of	c
accomodation	i
because	c
I	c
can	c
have	c
a	c
kitchen	c
or	c
even	c
a	c
bathroom	c
there	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
have	c
it	c
in	c
tent	i
.	c

At	i
the	i
end	i
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
is	c
needed	c
and	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
are	c
the	c
best	c
for	c
this	c
camp	c
.	c

Please	c
answer	c
me	c
soon	c
.	c

I	c
agree	c
with	c
this	c
statement	c
especially	c
when	c
we	c
talk	c
about	c
small	c
shop	i
in	c
the	c
center	i
of	c
a	c
big	c
town	c
.	c

In	c
such	c
a	i
shops	c
there	c
is	c
usually	c
one	c
or	c
one	c
or	c
two	c
sellers	i
,	c
what	i
is	c
not	c
enough	c
when	c
a	c
shop	c
is	c
full	c
of	c
people	c
.	c

That	c
's	c
a	c
place	c
where	c
you	c
lose	c
too	c
much	c
of	i
time	c
and	c
health	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
replying	c
to	c
your	c
letter	c
for	i
the	c
first	c
prize	c
of	i
the	c
competition	c
,	i
that	c
I	c
won	c
and	c
there	c
are	c
a	c
number	c
of	c
thinks	i
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
make	c
clear	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
the	c
best	c
time	c
is	c
the	c
first	c
two	c
weeks	c
of	c
July	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
free	c
then	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
not	c
used	c
to	c
sleeping	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
,	c
so	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
very	c
difficult	c
for	c
me	c
.	i

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
basketball	c
and	c
swimming	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
was	c
younger	c
I	c
attend	i
I	i
local	c
basketball	c
team	c
and	c
we	c
became	c
local	c
champions	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
am	c
good	c
at	c
basketball	c
and	c
have	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
experience	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

Many	c
thanks	c
for	c
your	c
last	c
letter	c
.	c

Let	c
's	c
start	c
from	c
the	c
beginning	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
to	c
iron	c
them	c
,	c
put	i
them	c
in	c
order	c
,	c
so	c
that	c
the	c
pop	c
stars	c
,	c
who	c
will	i
sing	i
at	c
the	c
concert	c
,	c
look	i
impressive	c
.	i

The	c
most	c
exciting	c
things	c
happened	c
later	c
.	c

I	c
must	c
say	c
that	c
being	c
in	i
a	c
concert	c
is	c
very	c
nice	c
.	c

Pantelis	c

This	c
trip	c
will	c
,	c
undoubtedly	c
be	i
a	c
wonderful	c
experience	c
.	c

I	c
really	c
did	c
n't	c
expect	c
to	c
win	c
the	c
trip	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
therefore	c
be	c
very	c
thankful	i
if	c
you	c
could	c
book	c
the	c
tickets	c
for	c
then	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
nice	c
to	c
try	c
it	c
at	c
least	c
once	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

October	c
2000	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

The	c
only	c
thing	c
I	c
was	c
asked	c
to	c
do	c
was	c
to	c
help	c
carry	c
the	c
lunches	c
of	c
the	c
singers	c
and	c
to	c
help	c
with	c
light	c
and	c
sound	c
management	c
,	c
when	c
the	c
guy	c
there	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
something	c
else	c
.	c

Oh	c
yes	c
,	c
I	c
also	c
had	c
to	c
check	c
the	c
tickets	c
for	c
five	c
minutes	c
.	c

The	c
woman	c
had	c
to	c
deliver	c
something	c
.	c

The	c
problem	c
about	i
this	c
job	c
is	c
that	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
deal	c
with	c
huge	c
amounts	i
of	c
people	c
.	c

You	c
must	c
show	c
a	c
great	c
sence	i
of	c
responsibility	c
.	c

Do	c
n't	c
worry	c
they	c
still	c
organise	c
these	c
"	c
youth	c
work	c
"	c
programs	i
.	c

I	c
was	c
surprised	c
because	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
expect	c
that	c
I	c
could	c
win	c
.	c

Now	c
I	c
study	i
and	c
I	c
'll	c
continue	c
my	c
study	i
untill	i
the	c
end	c
of	c
June	c
.	c

Then	c
I	c
'll	c
have	c
holiday	i
which	c
finish	i
in	c
August	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
's	c
very	i
usefull	i
and	c
helpful	c
thing	c
for	c
my	c
health	c
especially	i
when	c
I	c
do	c
it	c
with	c
pleasure	c
.	c

How	c
much	c
money	c
I	i
need	c
and	c
if	i
I	c
have	c
to	c
have	c
them	i
in	c
cash	c
or	c
I	i
can	i
use	c
a	c
credit	c
card	c
.	i

Thank	c
you	c

Katerina	c
Petrov	c

How	c
are	c
you	c
?	c

Now	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
about	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	i
as	i
you	c
have	i
already	i
knowen	i
I	c
helped	c
my	c
father	c
to	c
organize	c
this	c
concert	c
.	c

The	c
most	c
enjoable	i
thing	c
was	c
to	c
smart	i
people	c
.	c

These	c
days	c
were	c
so	c
busy	c
.	c

But	c
when	c
we	c
saw	c
our	c
show	c
and	c
heard	c
how	c
loud	i
audience	i
claped	i
them	c
we	c
were	c
proud	c
and	c
understood	c
that	c
we	c
spent	i
a	i
good	i
time	i
.	c

Katerina	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
writting	i
to	c
you	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
musical	c
show	i
that	c
I	c
saw	c
when	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c

Future	c
will	c

.	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

From	i
August	c
,	c
in	i
fact	i
,	c
I	c
will	c
start	c
with	i
a	c
new	c
job	c
and	c
I	c
will	c
not	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
live	i
Rome	c
for	c
a	c
long	c
period	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
also	c
pleased	c
to	c
have	c
the	c
chance	c
to	c
do	c
some	c
activities	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
choose	c
something	c
I	c
am	c
not	c
able	c
to	c
do	c
so	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

Being	c
a	c
woman	c
,	c
I	c
naturally	c
love	c
shopping	c
.	c

The	c
first	c
one	c
is	c
the	c
Christmas	c
period	c
.	c

You	c
cannot	c
try	c
on	c
a	c
dress	c
and	c
decide	c
to	c
buy	c
it	c
or	i
not	c
in	c
peace	c
,	c
because	c
outside	c
there	c
is	c
a	c
queue	c
of	c
people	c
waiting	c
for	c
their	c
turn	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
during	c
this	c
period	c
,	c
prices	c
are	c
usually	c
much	c
higher	c
than	c
in	c
the	c
other	c
month	i
's	i
.	c

Another	c
situation	c
in	c
which	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
enjoyable	c
,	i
is	c
when	c
you	c
go	c
shopping	c
with	c
a	c
man	c
.	c

Anyway	c
,	c
apart	c
from	c
these	c
two	c
cases	c
,	c
shopping	c
is	c
always	c
very	c
amusing	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
disappointed	c
because	c
the	c
things	c
that	c
were	c
writen	i
on	i
the	c
advertisment	i
were	c
not	c
really	c
true	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
say	c
in	c
your	c
advertisment	i
it	i
was	c
not	c
my	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
and	c
therefore	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
have	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

Modern	c
technology	c
has	c
changed	c
a	i
lot	i
our	i
daily	i
life	i
.	c

With	c
internet	i
you	c
can	c
do	c
whatever	c
you	c
want	c
without	c
going	c
out	c
home	i
(	c
shoping	i
,	c
speaking	c
with	c
a	c
friend	c
,	c
working	c
,	c
putting	c
your	c
money	c
aside	c
....	c
)	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
modern	i
technology	c
has	c
change	i
a	i
lot	i
our	i
daily	i
life	i
and	c
this	c
is	c
going	c
to	c
increase	i
.	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
back	i
to	c
tell	c
you	c
that	c
I	c
am	c
happy	c
to	c
accept	c
this	c
prize	c
and	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
some	c
further	c
information	c
that	c
you	c
need	c
from	c
me	c
.	c

If	c
it	c
's	c
possible	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
on	i
July	c
because	c
of	c
my	c
job	c
.	c

As	c
I	c
see	c
I	c
have	c
the	c
chance	c
to	c
choose	c
what	i
accommodation	c
I	c
prefer	c
.	i

I	c
have	c
never	c
done	i
noon	i
of	c
them	c
before	c
and	c
as	c
a	c
result	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
be	c
good	c
but	i
I	c
've	c
always	c
wanted	c
to	c
sail	c
because	c
I	c
love	c
the	c
sea	c
and	c
now	c
I	c
have	c
the	c
opportunitie	i
.	c

If	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
mind	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
are	c
apropriate	i
for	c
the	c
camp	c
and	c
for	c
the	c
weather	i
of	i
California	i
.	c

I	c
completely	c
agree	c
with	c
the	c
following	c
statement	c
:	c

From	i
my	i
point	i
of	i
view	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
people	c
believe	c
that	c
it	c
's	c
very	i
fun	c
to	c
go	c
shopping	c
and	c
it	c
's	c
a	c
great	c
way	c
to	c
spend	c
Saturday	c
afternoons	c
and	c
that	c
's	c
true	c
but	i
in	c
my	c
opinion	c
go	i
shopping	c
can	c
be	c
stressing	i
and	c
disgusting	c
.	c

I	c
mean	c
that	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
wait	c
until	c
the	c
seller	i
came	i
to	c
know	c
if	c
he	c
or	c
she	c
is	c
going	c
to	c
drive	c
you	c
crazy	c
.	c

Thirdly	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
pray	c
to	i
find	i
the	c
right	c
size	c
and	c
once	c
you	c
've	c
got	c
it	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
think	i
Does	i
it	i
fits	i
me	i
?	i

At	i
last	i
but	i
not	i
at	i
least	i
let	c
me	c
give	c
you	c
some	c
advice	c
try	i
not	c
to	c
go	c
with	c
that	c
friend	c
of	c
yours	c
that	i
is	c
crazy	c
about	c
clothes	c
and	c
shoes	c
because	c
she	c
wants	c
you	c
to	c
be	c
like	c
her	c
and	c
that	c
will	i
be	c
awful	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

I	c
have	i
just	i
received	i
it	c
yesterday	c

About	i
the	c
accommodation	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
,	c
I	c
prefer	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
.	c

The	c
activities	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
choose	c
the	i
swimming	c
and	c
sailing	c
.	c

Lastly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
about	c
the	c
money	c
and	c
clothes	c
.	c

Then	i
I	i
can	i
prepare	i
my	c
clothes	c
,	c
or	c
can	c
we	c
buy	c
some	c
clothes	c
there	c
?	c

I	c
would	c
be	c
greatful	i
if	c
you	c
could	c
send	c
me	c
the	c
full	c
details	c
.	c

Many	c
thanks	c
.	c

We	c
need	c
food	c
,	c
clothes	c
,	c
book	i
etc.	c
There	c
are	c
many	c
kinds	c
of	c
thing	i
for	i
shopping	c
and	c
they	c
are	c
different	c
for	i
example	c
the	c
price	c
,	c
the	c
quality	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
easy	c
.	c

Sometime	i
,	c
it	i
's	i
so	c
many	c
people	c
and	c
they	c
are	c
not	c
friendly	c
at	c
all	c
or	c
you	c
are	c
hurry	i
while	c
you	c
are	c
in	c
the	i
long	c
queu	i
.	c

Most	c
people	c
enjoy	c
shopping	c
because	c
it	c
more	i
convenien	i
for	i
today	c
but	c
if	c
you	c
found	c
the	i
busy	c
place	c
for	c
shopping	c
or	c
it	c
is	i
not	c
as	c
good	c
as	c
you	c
expect	i
.	c

We	c
were	c
disappointed	c
to	c
realize	c
that	c
not	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
but	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
played	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
main	c
characters	c
.	c

Honestly	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
less	c
impressive	c
performance	c
than	c
we	c
had	c
expected	c
.	c

According	c
to	c
your	c
advertisment	i
the	c
play	c
should	c
have	c
started	c
at	c
19:30	c
.	c

What	c
made	c
the	c
situation	c
worse	c
is	c
that	c
no	c
explanation	c
for	c
the	c
delay	c
was	c
given	c
;	c
not	c
even	c
an	c
apologation	i
.	c

We	c
had	c
been	c
told	c
that	c
discounts	c
to	i
the	c
ticket-prices	i
were	c
possible	i
but	c
at	i
the	c
evening	c
of	c
the	c
show	c
no	c
discounts	c
or	c
special	c
offers	c
whatsoever	c
were	c
offered	c
.	c

After	c
the	c
show	c
we	c
had	c
intended	c
to	c
visit	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
which	i
was	c
-	c
to	c
our	c
surprise	c
-	c
closed	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
time	i
delay	c
!	c

Honestly	c
for	c
us	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
that	c
"	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
"	c
.	c

We	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
if	c
there	c
is	c
any	c
chance	c
to	i
get	i
our	c
money	c
back	c
of	i
or	c
if	c
you	c
can	c
offer	c
any	c
other	c
alternative	c
for	i
our	i
convenience	i
?	c

Dear	c
Tim	c
,	c

I	c
recommend	c
you	c
listen	c
to	c
it	c
!	c

I	c
suppose	c
you	c
still	c
wonder	c
what	c
the	c
great	c
authors	c
can	c
do	c
for	c
us	c
?	c

Therefore	c
Hemingway	c
is	c
a	c
very	c
good	c
example	c
.	c

One	c
of	c
the	c
most	c
interesting	c
ones	c
is	c
"	c
The	c
old	c
man	c
and	c
the	c
Sea	c
"	c
.	c

The	c
story	c
describes	c
his	c
feelings	c
,	c
thoughts	c
,	c
fears	c
and	c
emotions	c
during	c
a	c
struggle	c
with	c
a	c
giant	c
deep-sea	c
fish	c
.	c

An	c
interesting	c
story	c
-	c
demanding	c
in	c
a	c
way	c
-	c
which	c
can	c
give	c
you	c
an	c
impression	c
of	c
Hemingway	c
's	c
work	c
and	c
what	c
he	c
meant	c
by	c
"	c
pace	c
under	c
pressure	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
,	c

It	c
was	c
so	c
kind	c
of	c
you	c
to	c
have	c
organised	c
the	c
programme	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
enjoy	c
to	i
see	i
the	i
show	c
,	c
especially	c
a	c
fashion	c
show	c
.	c

This	c
show	c
starts	c
on	c

Exhibition	c
of	c
London	c
from	c
10:00	c

a	c
nice	c
experience	c
and	c
worthy	i
.	c

If	c
it	c
rains	c
,	c
we	c
will	c

Dear	c
friend	c

Thank	c
you	c
a	c
lot	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
and	c
I	c
hope	c
you	c
and	c
your	c
family	c
are	c
well	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
a	c
good	c
idea	c
to	c
give	c
a	c
book	c
for	c
your	c
cousin	c
's	c
birthday	c
present	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
such	c
a	c
wonderful	c
story	c
that	c
I	c
remember	c
the	c
old	c
man	c
speaking	c
about	c
human	c
's	c
life	c
between	c
the	c
sea	c
and	c
the	c
man	c
.	c

It	c
may	c
make	c
him	c
think	c
of	c
his	c
future	c
and	c
this	c
book	c
could	c
be	c
very	c
suitable	c
for	c
him	c
.	c

Let	c
me	c
know	c
if	c
he	c
likes	c
it	c
or	c
not	c
and	c
I	c
hope	c
we	c
'll	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
get	c
together	c
before	c
too	c
long	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c

Love	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
your	c
musical	c
show	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
the	c
advertisement	c
says	c
that	c
discounts	c
will	c
be	c
available	c
with	i
the	c
price	c
of	c
the	c
ticket	c
,	c
but	c
when	c
I	c
asked	c
for	c
one	c
they	c
told	c
me	c
that	c
there	c
was	i
not	i
any	c
.	c

Last	c
but	c
not	c
least	c
,	c
the	c
advertisement	c
says	c
to	c
visit	c
your	c
restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
but	c
when	c
we	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
restaurant	c
we	c
realised	i
that	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
the	c
cook	c
was	c
ill	c
.	c

it	i
was	c
a	c
complete	c
waste	c
of	c
time	c
and	c
money	c
.	c

That	c
is	c
why	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
request	c
full	i
refund	c
of	c
my	c
money	c
.	c

The	c
two	c
days	c
passed	c
really	c
fast	c
and	c
Anna	c
was	c
happy	c
because	c
Pat	c
had	c
n't	c
told	c
anything	i
to	i
her	i
brother	i
,	c
or	c
so	c
she	c
thought	c
!	c

Pat	c
went	c
to	c
Anna	c
's	c
and	c
she	c
seemed	c
really	c
unhappy	c
.	c

-	c
"	c
Anna	c
I	c
have	c
a	c
confession	c
to	c
make	c
"	c
Pat	i
told	i
her	i
and	c
she	c
started	c
crying	c

-	c
"	c
What	c
is	c
it	c
Pat	c
?	c
"	c

Anna	c
asked	c
and	c
she	c
started	c
to	c
worry	c
.	c

Pat	c
left	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
really	c
surprise	i
to	c
heared	i
I	c
have	i
won	c
in	i
your	c
competition	c
.	c

With	i
pleasure	i
I	i
'll	i
give	i
all	c
information	i
wich	i
you	c
need	c
.	c

The	c
3rd	c
of	c
July	c
will	c
suit	c
to	i
me	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
more	c
convinient	i
for	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
glad	c
I	c
can	c
chose	i
two	c
activities	c
while	c
I	c
will	i
at	c
the	c
Camp	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
keen	c
on	c
basketball	c
,	i
I	c
played	c
in	c
my	c
country	c
for	c
7	c
years	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
good	i
diffender	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
choose	c
surfing	c
like	i
my	c
second	c
activities	i
.	c

We	c
ca	c
n't	c
say	c
that	c
is	i
always	c
enjoyable	c
or	c
is	i
not	c
.	c

If	c
we	c
decided	i
to	c
by	i
somthing	i
special	c
and	c
we	c
have	c
enough	c
money	c
for	c
it	c
we	c
have	c
to	c
go	c
and	c
buy	c
it	c
.	c

They	c
will	c
hate	c
this	c
new	c
thing	c
because	c
they	c
will	c
miss	c
a	c
party	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
wish	c
you	c
have	i
a	i
good	i
enjoyable	c
shopping	c
all	i
your	i
way	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
express	c
my	c
extreme	c
dissatisfaction	c
with	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
'	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
'	c
that	c
recently	c
took	c
place	c
in	c
The	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
dissappointed	i
to	c
find	c
out	c
that	c
there	c
were	c
no	c
discounts	c
available	c
!	c

In	c
addition	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
annoyed	c
by	c
the	c
fact	c
that	c
the	c
event	c
had	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
-	c
not	c
19:30	c
as	c
mentioned	i
in	c
the	c
advertisment	i
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

Everyone	c
was	c
aware	c
that	c
telling	i
aloud	c
about	c
'	i
Secret	c
Society	c
'	c
could	c
get	c
you	c
in	c
trouble	c
,	c
serious	c
trouble	c
.	c

There	c
had	c
been	c
cases	c
when	c
somebody	c
entered	c
the	c
club	c
but	c
never	c
came	c
back	c
afterwards	c
.	c

I	c
guess	c
it	c
was	c
that	c
thrill	c
that	c
actually	c
made	c
me	c
anxious	c
to	c
know	c
what	c
really	c
was	c
going	c
on	c
inside	c
the	c
dodgy-looking	c
old	c
house	c
guarded	c
by	c
a	c
man	c
with	c
an	c
unfriendly	c
hound	c
.	c

But	c
knowing	c
what	c
these	c
people	c
are	c
capable	c
of	c
makes	c
me	c
doubt	i
wether	i
to	c
use	c
it	c
or	c
not	c
.	c

Especially	c
now	c
,	c
when	c
'	c
big-mouth	c
'	c
Pat	c
spread	i
the	c
news	c
to	c
litterally	i
everyone	c
.	c

I	c
want	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
one	c
more	c
thing	c
I	i
do	c
not	c
have	c
any	c
idea	c
about	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
and	c
clothes	i
I	c
have	c
to	c
bring	i
would	i
you	c
give	c
me	c
an	i
advice	c
to	i
know	i
how	c
much	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
bring	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

another	i
good	c
thing	c
was	c
that	c
all	c
the	c
people	c
wants	i
to	c
be	c
in	c
your	c
place	c
and	c
they	c
were	c
very	c
jealous	c
about	i
me	c
.	c

any	i
way	i
,	c
this	c
was	c
my	c
own	i
experience	c
working	c
at	c
the	c
concert	c
,	i
if	i
you	c
have	c
any	i
oportunity	i
to	c
help	c
at	c
any	c
concert	c
you	c
should	c
help	c
because	c
you	c
have	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
fun	c
as	c
well	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c

from	c
you	c

Best	c
wishes	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
in	i
replay	i
to	c
the	c
letter	c
I	c
have	c
recently	c
recived	i
,	c
to	c
inform	c
you	c
about	c
some	c
details	c
that	c
I	c
am	c
concerned	c
about	c
.	c

In	c
your	c
letter	c
you	c
settled	i
the	c
possibility	c
to	i
choose	i
two	c
activities	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
let	c
you	c
know	c
that	c
I	c
would	c
be	c
pleased	c
if	c
I	c
could	c
join	c
to	i
basketball	c
and	c
climbing	c
,	c
as	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
both	c
of	c
them	c
due	i
to	i
I	i
've	i
played	i
in	i
my	c
secondary	c
scholl	i
as	c
leader	i
of	c
my	i
team	c
and	c
due	c
to	c
my	c
long	c
training	c
periods	i
in	i
lifting	c
weights	c
.	c

Lastly	c
,	c
do	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
take	c
with	c
me	c
any	c
special	c
staff	i
of	c
clothes	c
?	c

Do	c
I	c
need	c
some	c
money	c
?	c
and	c
if	c
it	i
is	i
so	c
,	c
how	c
much	c
?	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

There	c
is	c
as	i
well	c
the	i
struggle	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
endure	c
when	c
you	c
find	c
yourself	c
into	i
the	c
crowds	c
crambled	i
in	c
the	c
small	c
shops	c
during	c
the	c
unique	i
day-off	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
buy	c
somthing	i
you	c
like	c
.	c

If	c
this	c
was	c
n't	c
enough	c
you	i
strength	c
and	c
mental	c
health	c
can	c
be	c
completely	c
destroyed	c
when	c
despite	i
having	c
been	c
stolen	i
,	c
having	c
spent	c
hours	c
walking	c
around	c
and	c
being	c
tired	c
and	c
hungry	c
you	i
finally	c
buy	c
something	c
you	c
really	c
liked	i
with	c
your	c
credit	c
card	c
and	c
after	i
having	c
walked	c
a	c
few	c
blocks	c
you	i
see	c
the	c
same	c
item	c
at	c
half	c
price	i
in	c
another	c
shop	c
.	c

Your	c
first	c
question	c

Everyone	i

I	c
suppose	c
it	i
's	i
everything	c
that	c
you	c
need	c
from	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
,	c
again	c

I	c
can	c
say	c
that	c
nowadays	c
is	i
growing	i
up	i
very	c
quickly	c
in	c
our	c
society	c
like	i
a	c
kind	c
of	c
sport	c
or	c
hobby	c
to	i
waste	c
or	c
spend	c
the	i
free	c
time	c
.	c

And	c
it	c
's	c
creating	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
adict	i
people	c
,	c
call	i
"	c
shopalcoholics	i
"	c
.	c

After	c
that	c
,	c
the	i
unfriendly	c
and	c
sometime	i
's	i
unpolite	i
shop	c
assistance	i
who	c
breaks	i
your	c
nerves	c
down	i

Or	c
to	i
whom	i
it	i
main	i
concern	i
:	c

Really	c
it	c
was	i
.	c

Most	c
people	c
could	c
n't	c
afford	c
them	c

As	i
a	i
matter	i
of	i
fact	i
,	c
when	c
the	c
musical	i
show	c
was	c
over	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
really	c
hungry	c

So	c
I	c
went	c
there	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
have	c
something	c
to	c
eat	c

I	c
was	c
both	c
hungry	c
and	c

Looking	c

Faithfully	c

Unfortunately	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
very	c
excited	i
experience	c
and	c
I	c
really	c
enjoyed	c
very	i
much	c
.	c

They	c
have	c
a	c
very	c
simple	c
life	c
and	c
behavior	i
when	c
they	c
were	i
n't	i
on	c
the	c
scene	i

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
problems	c
were	i
exist	i
on	i
the	i
musical	c
show	c
.	c

After	i
that	i
,	c
the	c
time	c
that	c
the	c
show	c
should	i
start	i
was	c
19:30	c
but	c
it	c
started	c
fortyfive	i
minutes	c
later	c
.	c

They	c
were	i
not	c
exist	c
.	c

This	c
is	c
not	c
an	c
excuse	c
.	c

You	c
have	c
to	c
excuse	c
me	c
but	i
this	c
was	c
a	c
very	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
waiting	c
your	i
answer	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

One	c
day	c
Brian	c
,	c
the	i
best	i
friend	i
of	i
Pat	i
told	i
him	c
a	c
secret	c
.	c

An	i
important	c
secret	c
for	c
Brian	c
.	c

Jane	c
was	c
a	c
very	c
good	c
girl	c
and	c
she	c
liked	c
Brian	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
Beth	c
,	i
asked	c
Jane	c
if	c
she	c
is	i
in	c
love	c
with	c
Brian	c
and	c
she	c
said	c
that	c
she	c
was	c
.	c

Jane	c
and	c
Brian	c
were	c
very	c
happy	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
also	c
expecting	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
actor	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
performing	c
,	c
but	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
did	c
,	c
who	c
did	c
not	c
perform	c
as	c
well	c
as	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
does	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

As	c
soon	c
as	c
she	c
arrived	c
home	c
,	c
she	c
phoned	c
her	c
best	c
friend	c
Sue	c
and	c
told	c
her	c
everything	c
,	c
all	c
details	c
included	c
.	c

She	c
also	c
told	c
her	c
not	c
to	c
tell	c
anybody	c
about	c
it	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
secret	c
.	c

I	c
did	c
n't	c
know	c
it	c
was	c
published	c
as	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
read	c
the	c
paper	c
and	c
no	c
one	c
told	c
me	c
anything	c

either	c

Yours	c
Sincerely	c

I	c
agree	c
with	i
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
first	c
place	c
,	c
when	c
the	i
people	c
think	c
only	c
in	i
go	i
to	i
the	i
shopping	c
forgot	i
others	i
things	c
:	c
play	i
with	c
their	c
children	c
,	c
talk	i
with	c
than	i
parents	c
,	c
friends	c
.	c

In	i
the	i
other	i
hands	i
,	c
when	c
the	i
people	c
go	c
to	i
shopping	c
spend	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
money	c
.	c

Last	c
week	c
my	c
son	c
and	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
see	c
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
at	c
the	c
Circle	c
theatre	c
.	c

We	c
paid	c
to	c
see	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
my	c
son	c
's	c
favorite	i
actor	c
,	c
but	c
we	c
seems	i
quite	c
disappointing	i
,	i
my	i
son	c
was	c
very	c
happy	c
because	c
he	c
would	c
see	c
for	i
the	i
first	i
time	i
his	i
favorite	i
actor	i
.	c

However	c
it	i
's	i
just	c
the	c
begining	i
of	c
the	c
problems	c
we	c
had	c
.	c

In	i
spite	i
of	i
this	c
,	c
less	i
you	c
can	c
do	c
for	c
us	c
is	c
to	c
give	c
my	i
money	c
back	c
and	c
work	c
hard	c
so	c
that	c
this	c
theater	i
that	i
is	c
famouis	i
about	i
its	c
beauty	c
and	c
pontuality	i
do	i
n't	i
become	c
famous	c
about	i
it	i
desorganized	i
shows	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
a	c
revolution	c
in	c
the	i
fashion	c
that	c
is	c
starting	c
now	c
.	c

Nowadays	c
we	c
have	c
drifit	i
a	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
that	c
keep	c
the	c
temperature	c
of	c
our	c
body	i
,	i
clothes	i
that	c
do	c
n't	c
get	c
wet	c
or	c
even	c
dirty	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
future	c
we	c
wo	c
n't	c
by	i
clothes	c
by	i
size	c
or	c
even	c
color	i
,	i
our	i
clothes	c
will	c
adapt	c
to	c
our	c
body	i
,	c
the	c
weather	c
,	c
our	c
fit	i
so	i
,	c
our	i
necessities	i
.	c

It	c
already	i
started	i
and	c
do	i
n't	i
have	i
limites	i
to	i
go	i
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
my	c
boss	c
wo	c
n't	c
let	c
me	c
free	i
in	c
August	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
a	c
good	c
swimmer	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
in	c
the	c
Californian	c
See	i
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
think	c
I	c
'll	c
have	c
the	c
chance	c
of	i
doing	i
it	c
again	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
.	c

Should	c
I	c
bring	c
cash	c
or	c
a	i
credit	i
card	i
is	i
all	c
I	c
will	c
need	c
?	c

And	c
what	c
about	c
sanitary	c
precautions	c
?	c

I	c
ca	c
n't	c
?look	i
forward	i
to	c
start	c
this	c
adventure	c
.	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c

In	c
fact	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
buy	c
whatever	c
I	c
like	c
and	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
follow	c
fashions	c
just	i
like	c
the	c
other	c
women	c
do	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
go	c
shopping	c
I	c
always	c
have	c
to	c
ask	c
for	c
the	c
extra-large	c
size	c
and	c
harder	i
to	c
find	c
it	c
.	c

It	c
looks	c
like	c
a	c
sort	c
of	c
racism	c
and	c
unfortunately	c
our	c
society	c
looks	c
for	c
beauty	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Brown	c
,	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
about	c
our	c
present	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
Friday	c
morning	c
when	c
I	c
saw	c
John	c
and	c
said	i
me	i
he	c
had	c
some	c
good	c
news	c
to	c
tell	c
me	c
.	c

And	c
it	c
was	c
real	i
good	c
news	c
.	c

He	c
also	c
tell	i
that	c
I	c
must	c
be	c
the	i
next	i
day	i
at	i
7:00	i
p.m.	i
in	i
the	i
company	i
.	c

When	c
I	c
complete	i
a	c
month	c
to	i
this	c
job	c
my	c
executive	c
he	i
tell	i
to	i
John	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
office	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
surpised	i
because	c
I	c
did	c
not	c
know	c
what	c
he	c
wanted	c
.	c

I	c
cannot	i
believe	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
recently	c
had	c
a	c
week	c
's	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
and	c
went	c
to	c
see	c
a	c
musical	c
show	c
in	i
your	c
theatre	c
.	c

With	c
a	c
friend	i
we	i
had	c
seen	c
your	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
witch	i
was	i
very	c
attractive	c
.	c

The	c
starring	i
had	c
been	c
changed	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
had	c
started	c
only	i
at	c
20:15	c
,	c
and	c
there	c
were	c
no	c
discounts	c
available	c
.	c

And	c
your	c
last	c
phrasal	i
of	i
the	c
advertisement	c
"	i
Your	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
"	c
!	c
it	i
was	c
n't	c
at	i
all	c
,	c
like	i
I	c
have	c
explain	i
you	i
above	c
in	c
this	c
letter	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
so	c
practical	c
,	c
in	c
five	c
minuts	i
my	c
friend	c
can	c
read	c
my	c
letter	c
.	c

And	c
he	c
can	c
ansewer	i
me	c
very	c
quickly	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
,	i
it	c
is	c
now	c
the	c
futur	i
for	i
the	i
big	c
company	i
for	i
work	i
with	c
the	c
Internet	c
.	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
.	i

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
,	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
the	c
only	c
month	c
that	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
take	c
off	i
days	i
.	c

Also	c
my	c
kids	c
have	c
school	c
holidays	c
during	c
this	c
month	c
therefore	c
I	c
hope	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
mid	c
of	i
July	c
.	c

I	c
'd	c
prefer	c
to	c
say	c
in	c
log	c
cabins	c
.	c

Because	c
our	c
family	c
had	c
some	c
bad	c
experiences	c
with	c
using	c
tents	c
.	c

But	c
Golf	c
is	c
an	c
absolute	i
new	c
trial	c
.	c

I	c
can	c
imagine	c
myself	c
playing	c
Golf	c
in	i
those	c
beautiful	c
Californian	c
golf-courses	c
.	c

Even	c
though	c
I	c
'm	c
poorly	c
skilled	c
.	c

Especially	i
I	c
wonder	c
what	c
else	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
pack	c
to	c
go	c
there	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

How	c
are	c
you	c
?	c

I	c
'm	c
fine	c
either	i
but	c
I	c
'm	c
quite	c
busy	c
to	i
find	i
another	c
part	c
time	c
job	c
after	c
the	c
one	c
,	c
which	c
was	c
the	i
concert	i
supporting	i
one	i
.	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
pity	c
that	c
I	c
had	c
no	c
chance	c
to	c
learn	c
how	c
the	c
sound	c
system	c
works	c
,	c
which	c
I	c
was	c
mostly	c
interested	c
.	i

What	c
I	c
really	c
liked	c
was	c
that	c
every	c
single	c
person	c
had	c
to	c
be	c
responsible	c
for	c
his	c
role	c
,	c
till	c
we	c
left	c
the	c
stadium	c
.	c

I	c
wish	i
this	c
is	c
enough	c
to	c
express	c
my	c
feeling	c
and	c
I	c
hope	c
someday	c
we	c
can	c
share	c
such	c
things	c
together	c
.	c

Stay	c
pretty	c
and	c
lovely	c
!	c

I	c
am	c
writting	i
to	c
inform	c
some	i
problems	c
we	c
had	c
.	c

I	c
thought	c
we	c
can	i
buy	c
discounts	c
tickets	c
according	i
to	i
the	c
advertisement	c
.	c

After	i
we	c
arrive	i
at	c
the	c
theatre	c
,	c
We	i
were	c
very	c
disappointed	c
.	c

We	c
had	c
to	c
wait	c
over	c
40	c
minitues	i
.	i

and	c
we	c
could	c
n't	c
enjoy	c
dinner	c
at	c
theatre	i
restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

Would	c
it	c
be	c
possible	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
back	i
money	i
for	c
tickets	i
.	i

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
you	i
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
ship	c
!	c
!	c

There	c
was	c
beach	i
our	i
town	c
.	c

We	c
always	c
played	c
there	c
and	c
it	c
was	c
adventure	i
for	c
us	c
.	c

We	c
worried	c
about	c
it	c
and	c
we	c
tryed	i
to	c
pull	i
it	c
.	c

Our	c
ship	c
left	i
on	c
the	c
beach	c
.	c

Of	c
course	c
we	c
could	c
n't	c
play	c
there	c
after	c
that	c
.	c

But	c
now	c
,	i
I	c
am	c
thinking	c
about	c
new	i
secret	i
our	i
place	i
.	c

During	c
my	c
stay	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
musical	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
.	c

Secondly	c
I	c
also	i
would	i
like	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
the	c
musical	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
start	c
at	c
19.30	c
but	c
it	c
did	c
not	c
start	c
until	c
20.15	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
certainly	c
not	c
a	c
perfect	c
night	c
out	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
be	c
very	c
pleased	c
if	c
I	c
could	c
have	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

In	c
what	c
way	c
will	c
they	c
change	c
?	c

Maybe	c
everybody	c
will	c
end	c
up	c
wearing	c
shorts	c
and	c
skirts	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

Last	c
weekend	c
,	c
I	c
have	i
been	i
in	c
London	c
with	c
my	c

I	c
saw	c
your	c
musical	c
show	c
"	c
over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
.	c

On	i
the	c
paper	c
it	c
was	c
writting	i
the	i
principal	c
actor	c
is	c
"	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
"	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
him	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
that	i
we	c
have	i
never	c
seen	c
,	c
and	i
heard	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
's	c
really	c
not	c
correct	i

They	c
have	i
n't	i
respect	c
the	c
timetable	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
had	i
to	c
begun	i
at	c
19:30	c
and	c
he	i
started	c
at	c
20:15	i
how	i
can	c
you	c
explain	c
this	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
's	c
the	c

If	c

I	c
would	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
ask	c
for	c
some	c
queries	c
about	c
your	c
letter	c
which	c
I	c
have	c
received	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
could	c
you	c
make	c
an	c
arrangement	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
,	c
because	c
it	c
seems	c
that	c
living	c
in	c
log	c
cabins	c
is	c
more	c
exciting	c
than	c
in	c
tents	c
.	c

Also	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
go	c
swimming	c
and	c
surfing	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
used	c
to	c
be	c
an	c
assistant	c
in	c
a	c
Korean	c
national	c
pool	c
so	i
that	i
I	c
am	c
good	c
at	c
swimming	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
tried	c
to	i
go	i
surfing	c
.	c

That	c
is	c
why	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
do	c
that	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
could	c
you	c
tell	c
me	c
if	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
bring	c
some	c
clothes	c
,	c
towels	c
and	c
extra	c
money	c
?	c

I	c
would	c
be	i
appreciated	i
it	c
if	c
you	c
supply	i
some	c
towers	i
,	c
if	c
possible	c
.	c

Thanks	c
for	c
your	c
attention	c
.	c

It	c
seems	c
ages	c
since	c
I	c
wrote	c
to	c
you	c
.	c

How	c
have	c
you	c
been	c
?	c

That	c
's	c
why	c
I	c
could	c
attend	c
to	i
that	c
concert	c
as	c
a	c
volunteer	c
,	c
because	c
they	c
needed	c
people	c
who	c
could	c
speak	c
English	c
very	c
well	c
.	c

I	c
really	c
hope	c
to	c
see	c
you	c
soon	c

I	c
would	c
be	c
pleased	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
give	c
me	c
details	c
about	c
this	c
question	c
.	c

I	c
can	c
see	c
in	i
the	c
list	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
interesting	c
sports	c
!	c

Are	c
some	i
party	i
organized	c
during	c
the	c

?	c

Is	c
there	c
only	c
one	c
teatcher	i
for	c
each	c
sport	c
,	c
and	c
how	c
many	c
are	c
we	i
in	c
each	c
group	c
of	i
activities	i
?	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
all	c
informations	i
you	c
could	i
give	c
me	c
.	c

Finally	c
we	c
should	c
film	c
the	c
lunch	c
,	c
which	c
is	c
also	c
a	c
moment	c
to	i
relax	i
for	i
the	i
students	i
,	i
and	i
for	i
the	i
teatchers	i
,	i
we	i
must	c
n't	c
forget	c
to	c
film	c
the	c
teatcher	i
room	c
because	c
if	c
a	c
school	c
is	c
made	c
of	c
students	c
,	c
it	c
's	c
also	c
made	c
of	c
teatchers	i
.	c

I	c
hope	c
I	c
gave	i
you	c
all	c
informations	i
you	c
need	c
.	c

Last	c
saturday	i
evening	c
I	c
spent	i
a	c
wonderful	c
time	c
.	c

A	c
girlfriend	c
of	c
a	c
member	c
of	c
the	c
club	c
asked	c
me	c
if	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
help	c
at	c
the	c
information	c
desk	c
.	c

I	c
did	c
not	c
hesitate	c
one	c
moment	c
.	c

That	i
I	i
reached	i
a	i
lot	i
of	i
money	i
for	i
doing	i
something	i
I	i
like	i
very	i
much	i
was	i
very	i
nice	i
but	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
thing	c
for	c
me	c
was	c
meeting	c
people	c
,	c
having	c
fun	c
and	c
using	c
the	c
English	c
language	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sirs	c
!	i

I	c
have	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
that	c
for	i
me	i
it	i
is	i
only	i
possible	i
to	c
go	c
on	c
holiday	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
my	c
father	c
is	c
very	c
ill	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
only	c
possible	c
for	c
my	c
sister	c
to	c
take	c
care	c
of	c
him	c
in	c
July	c
(	c
because	c
her	c
small	c
children	c
are	c
in	c
summer	c
school	c
at	c
this	i
time	c
.	c

Another	c
question	c
was	c
about	c
the	c
accommodation	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
that	c
I	c
'd	c
prefer	c
tents	i
.	c

Singing	c
is	c
one	c
of	c
my	c
favourite	c
activities	c
and	c
I	c
know	c
that	c
I	c
do	c
it	c
very	c
well	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
also	c
good	c
at	c
swimming	c
but	c
I	c
do	c
not	c
do	c
it	c
professional	i
.	c

There	c
are	c
two	c
further	c
questions	c
which	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	i

My	c
price	i
was	c
the	c
chance	c
to	c
meet	c
a	c
pop	c
group	c
and	c
to	c
help	c
at	c
the	i
concert	c
.	c

I	i
started	c
at	c
8	c
pm	c
but	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
be	c
there	c
at	c
11	c
am	c
.	c

First	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
help	c
with	c
the	c
catering	c
which	i
lasted	c
until	c
2	c
pm.	c
After	c
this	c
I	c
met	c
the	c
band	c
members	c
and	c
got	c
to	c
know	c
them	c
while	c
we	c
were	c
having	c
a	c
good	c
meal	c
.	c

At	c
5	c
pm	c
the	c
band	c
members	c
disappeared	c
again	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
responsible	c
for	c
some	c
kind	c
of	c
guiding	i
tour	c
for	c
the	c
journalists	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
to	c
show	c
them	c
the	c
way	c
to	c
the	c
interviewing	c
room	c
.	c

At	c
8	c
pm	c
Metallica	c
started	c
and	c
I	i
have	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
,	c
they	c
did	i
a	c
great	c
performance	c
.	c

Questions	c
like	c
you	c
and	c
I	c
usually	c
ask	c
each	c
other	c
.	c

They	c
were	c
like	c
any	i
other	c
person	i
and	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
admit	c
that	c
I	c
like	c
them	c
very	c
much	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
just	c
received	c
your	c
letter	c
,	c
and	c
thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
your	c
reply	c
.	c

Although	c
it	c
is	c
not	c
very	c
comfortable	c
,	c
I	c
like	c
camping	c
very	c
much	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

In	c
fact	c
,	c
to	i
do	i
shopping	c
can	c
be	i
some	c
disavantages	i
for	c
different	c
reasons	c
:	c

Secondly	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
easy	c
to	c
spend	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
money	c
in	c
few	i
minutes	c
and	c
as	i
soon	i
as	i
you	i
can	i
regret	i
to	i
buy	i
all	c
these	i
clothes	c
,	i
which	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
really	c
need	c
.	c

Thirdly	c
,	c
some	c
clothes	c
can	c
have	c
some	c
stains	c
on	c
and	c
you	c
have	c
n't	c
noticed	c
this	c
before	c
buying	c
,	i
so	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
go	c
back	c
to	c
the	c
shop	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
reply	c
and	c
ask	c
you	c
some	c
questions	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
for	i
the	c
accomodation	i
,	c
I	c
would	c
say	c
I	c
prefer	c
living	c
in	c
tent	i
rather	c
than	c
in	c
log	i
cabin	c
because	c
I	c
used	c
to	c
sleep	c
in	c
tent	i
while	i
I	c
was	c
joining	i
a	i
local	c
scout	c
camp	c
in	c
my	c
country	c
.	c

Thirdly	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
choosen	i
Sailing	c
and	c
Photography	c
from	c
the	c
list	c
you	c
gave	c
me	c
because	c
both	c
of	c
them	c
are	c
my	c
favorite	i
hobbies	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
enjoying	c
Sailing	c
and	c
Photography	c
for	c
several	c
years	c
so	c
I	c
am	c
quite	c
good	c
at	c
both	c
of	c
them	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
receiving	c
the	c
details	c
of	i
travelling	i
soon	c
and	c
joining	i
your	c
camp	c
in	c
July	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

One	c
of	c
the	c
most	c
unforgettable	c
habit	i
of	c
city	c
life	c
is	c
going	c
out	c
for	i
shopping	c
.	c

A	c
group	c
of	c
girls	c
can	c
spend	i
their	i
time	i
in	c
a	c
shopping	c
center	i
forever	c
.	c

It	c
seems	c
to	c
me	c
that	c
more	c
people	c
in	c
my	c
hometown	c
tend	c
to	c
go	c
shopping	c
in	c
their	c
free	c
time	c
because	c
the	c
shopping	c
complexs	i
nowadays	c
are	c
more	c
attractive	c
and	c
combine	c
every	c
facilities	i
inside	c
.	c

From	c
my	c
point	c
of	c
view	c
,	c
someone	c
goes	c
shopping	c
just	c
because	c
he/she	c
wants	c
to	c
show	c
off	c
that	c
he/she	c
is	c
wealthy	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

I	c
think	c
you	c
should	c
check	c
the	c
information	c
before	c
print	i
it	c
!	c

And	c
nobody	c
told	c
me	c
why	c
!	c

I	c
could	c
n't	c
visit	c
the	c
theatre	c
after	c
the	c
performance	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
for	c
reparations	i
.	c

Why	c
did	c
n't	c
you	c
say	c
something	c
about	c
it	c
?	c

In	i
that	c
time	c
I	c
used	c
the	c
computer	c
only	c
to	c
play	c
with	i
its	i
video	c
games	c
.	c

It	c
became	c
scencial	i
to	c
do	i
my	c
homework	c
.	c

She	c
had	c
to	c
be	c
operated	c
on	c
and	c
my	c
family	c
and	c
I	c
were	c
very	c
scared	c
.	c

But	c
when	c
we	c
talked	c
to	c
the	c
doctor	c
we	c
felt	c
more	c
relaxed	c
because	c
he	c
answered	i
us	c
that	c
the	c
operation	c
was	c
a	c
very	c
simple	c
one	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
if	c
my	c
mother	c
had	c
got	c
ill	c
ten	c
years	c
before	c
,	c
she	c
would	c
n't	c
survive	i
.	c

I	c

A	i
number	c
of	c
forigen	i
students	c
have	i
recently	c
been	c
increasing	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
also	c
thought	c
that	c
school	c
trips	c
are	c
to	c
be	c

because	c
it	i

a	c
wide	c

First	c

all	c
I	c
would	c

you	c
for	c
giving	c
me	c
the	c
oportunity	i
to	c

You	c
asked	c

some	c
questions	c
about	c

the	c
best	c
to	c

Travelling	c
in	c

I	c
have	c
to	c

,	c
would	c
be	c
perfect	c
for	c
me	c
because	c
I	i
have	i
got	i
my	i
birtday	i
the	c
24th	c
of	c
this	i
month	c
and	c
I	c
wish	c
I	i
could	i
spend	i
my	c
birtday	i
as	i
well	i
as	i
possible	c
,	c
so	c
it	i
means	c
there	c
.	c

The	c
activities	c
I	c
have	c
choosen	i
both	c
represent	c
a	c
pation	i
for	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
may	i
have	c
a	c
question	c
for	c
you	c
to	c
answer	c
,	i
please	c
could	c
you	c
tell	c
my	i
how	c
much	c
money	c
do	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
bring	c
with	c
me	c
?	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

However	i
it	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
,	c
people	c
are	c
shopping	c
more	c
and	c
more	c
,	i
it	i
is	c
very	c
fashionable	c
those	i
times	i
.	c

They	c
do	c
not	c
always	c
buy	c
lots	c
of	c
things	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
think	c
most	c
of	c
them	c
do	c
.	c

Even	c
people	c
who	c
have	c
n't	c
got	c
lots	c
of	c
money	c
go	c
shopping	c
anyway	i
.	c

Is	c
it	c
enjoyable	c
to	c
walk	c
around	c
shops	c
,	c
looking	c
at	c
nice	c
stuff	i
,	c
without	c
having	c
enough	c
money	c
to	c
spend	i
on	i
it	i
?	c

Enjoying	c
shopping	c
is	c
n't	c
the	i
reason	c
for	c
doing	c
that	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
.	c

We	c
felt	c
very	c
disappointed	c
when	c
we	c
discovered	c
that	c
Danny	c
had	c
been	c
replaced	c
by	c
an	c
unknown	c
and	c
really	c
bad	c
actor	c
.	c

Despite	c
the	c
terrible	c
evening	c
we	c
decided	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
to	c
relax	c
and	c
have	c
dinner	c
,	c
but	c
we	c
found	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
its	c
floor	c
was	c
being	c
repaired	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
can	c
see	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
a	c
perfect	c
evening	c
at	c
all	c
!	c

I	c
want	c
you	c
to	c
give	c
our	i
money	c
back	c
because	c
the	c
things	c

It	c
will	c
be	c
the	i
following	i
Sunday	c
on	c
the	c
local	c
station	c
at	c
five	c
o'clock	c
in	c
the	c
evening	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
a	c
story	c
titled	i
Accident	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
you	c
'll	c
enjoy	c
it	c
.	c

The	c
story	c
is	c
about	c
the	i
life	c
in	c
a	c
small	c
village	c
.	c

The	c
main	c
character	c
is	c
a	c
retired	c
police	c
inspector	c
who	c
recognises	c
a	c
woman	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
she	c
's	c
a	c
very	c
clever	c
woman	c
and	c
she	c
does	c
n't	c
look	c
worried	c
.	c

There	c
will	c
be	c
a	c
horrible	c
accident	c
in	c
a	c
few	c
seconds	c
.	c

Listen	c
to	c
the	c
radio	c
if	c
you	c
want	c
to	c
know	c
how	c
it	c
ends	c
.	c

We	c
are	c
writting	i
to	c
you	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
,	c
we	i
saw	c
last	c
week	c
in	c
your	c
Theatre	c
.	c

We	c
read	c
an	c
advertisement	c
about	c
your	c
musical	i
show	c
,	c
starred	i
by	i
the	c
well-known	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
in	i
a	c
local	c
newspaper	c

We	c
were	c
also	c
surprised	c
to	c
discover	c
that	c
the	c
student	c
discounts	c
was	i
n't	i
available	c
for	c
us	c
,	c
because	c
they	c
did	c
n't	c
accept	c
our	c
student	c
indentity	i
card	i
from	c
Switzerland	c
.	c

This	c
evening	c
was	c
a	c
waste	c
of	c
time	c
.	c

What	c
is	c
the	c
effect	c
of	i
it	c
in	i
your	c
environement	i
?	c

Were	c
the	i
people	c
happier	c
in	c
a	i
past	c
than	c
to	i
day	i
?	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
all	c
the	c
improvements	c
have	i
a	i
price	i
to	i
pay	i
;	i
The	i
condition	c
of	c
the	c
environement	i

Dear	c
Sir	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
if	c
you	c
go	c
to	c
a	c
play	c
and	c
you	c
are	c
watching	c
to	c
see	c
your	c
favourite	c
actor	c
playing	c
a	c
good	c
play	i
and	c
then	c
appears	i
a	c
silly	c
one	c
,	c
who	c
does	c
n't	c
know	c
what	c
to	c
do	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
disappoint	i
at	i
all	i
.	c

Another	c
thing	c
that	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
know	c
is	c
why	c
you	c
did	c
n't	c
do	i
any	c
discount	c
if	i
it	i
was	c
showed	i
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
.	c

When	c
the	c
play	c
was	c
finished	c
I	c
was	c
looking	c
for	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
like	i
on	i
the	i
paper	i
that	i
was	i
on	i
the	i
door	i
was	i
writen	i
,	c
it	c
was	c
too	c
late	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

All	i
started	c
when	c
she	c
was	c
fifteen	c
,	c
when	c
started	i
a	c
new	c
course	c
on	i
the	c
institute	c
and	c
met	c
some	c
girls	c
that	c
passed	i
the	i
time	c
they	i
would	c
became	i
her	c
friends	c
.	c

When	c
it	c
was	c
time	c
to	c
do	i
the	c
final	c
exam	c
,	c
she	c
became	c
ill	c
and	c
she	c
could	c
n't	c
do	c
it	c
so	c
teachers	i
decided	c
to	c
allow	c
her	c
to	c
pass	c
the	c
course	c
because	c
she	c
had	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
good	c
marks	c
but	i
on	i
the	i
other	i
hand	i
the	c
principal	c
desagreeded	i
with	i
it	i
and	c
did	c
n't	c
give	c
the	i
permision	i
to	c
pass	c
her	c
.	c

Pat	c
,	c
to	c
win	c
her	c
new	c
classemates	i
'	i
friendship	c
tell	i
all	i
what	i
she	c
knew	c
about	c
her	c
friends	c
and	c
owing	i
to	i
what	c
Pat	c
said	c
,	c
her	c
friends	c
broke	i
they	i
friendship	c
with	c
Pat	c
because	c
their	c
popularity	c
was	c
damaged	c
.	c

Pat	c
's	c
classmates	c
made	i
the	c
same	c
and	c
Pat	c
finished	i
alone	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
,	c

I	c
'm	c
expecting	c
for	i
your	c
reply	c
soon	c
.	c

If	i
it	i
came	i
true	i
,	i
imagination	i
to	i
make	i
cloth	i
would	i
bigger	i
and	i
could	i
think	i
various	i
design	i
and	i
format	i
.	c

By	i
one	c
country	c
's	c
traditional	c
cloth	i
taking	i
in	i
those	i
of	c
another	c
country	c
,	c
it	i
can	i
born	i
different	i
type	i
and	i
new	i
kind	i
of	i
fashion	i
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
there	i
might	i
vanish	i
personality	i
(	i
character	i
)	i
of	i
each	i
country	i
.	c

However	c
,	c
thinking	i
way	i
that	i
simple	i
is	i
the	i
best	i
will	i
not	i
change	i
.	c

I	c
guess	c
the	c
good	c
things	c
will	c
not	c
change	c
forever	c
.	c

Never	c
before	c
had	c
I	c
such	i
a	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
.	c

And	c
on	i
the	i
top	i
of	i
everything	i
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
waiters	c
'	c
strike	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
look	c
for	c
another	c
place	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
snack	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
n't	c
a	c
"	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
"	c
at	c
all	c
!	c

That	c
is	c
why	c
I	c
expect	c
at	c
least	c
half	c
the	c
ticket	c
price	c
back	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
will	c
give	c
this	c
matter	c
your	c
immediate	c
consideration	c
.	c

Otherwise	c
I	c
'll	c
have	c
to	c
apply	c
to	c
court	i
for	c
aid	c
.	c

Fashion	c
of	c
the	c
Future	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
one	c
hand	c
,	c
science	c
and	c
technology	c
have	c
been	c
developing	c
rapidly	c
,	c
and	c
God	c
knows	c
what	c
new	c
materials	c
will	c
be	c
invented	c
in	c
future	i
.	c

We	c
probably	c
will	c
be	c
wearing	c
dresses	c
made	c
of	c
synthetic	c
artificial	i
cloth	c
in	c
2100	c
.	c

Of	c
course	c
,	c
those	i
new	c
material	i
wo	c
n't	c
be	c
so	c
harmful	c
for	i
our	c
health	c
as	c
today	c
's	c
nylon	c
and	c
other	c
things	c
like	c
that	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
people	c
tend	c
to	c
wear	c
natural	c
clothes	c
today	c
,	c
made	c
of	c
cotton	c
,	c
wool	c
.	i

This	c
tendency	c
may	c
result	c
in	c
turning	i
down	i
synthetics	c
at	i
all	i
.	c

And	c
it	c
is	c
even	c
more	c
difficul	i
to	c
predict	c
how	i
the	i
clothes	c
of	i
the	c
future	c
will	c
look	c
like	c
.	c

Anyway	c
,	c
we	c
'll	c
give	c
up	c
wearing	c
fur	c
coats	c
as	c
it	c
is	c
cruel	c
and	c
uncivilised	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
of	c
Madam	c
,	c

That	c
was	c
very	c
disappointing	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
20.15	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
thinking	c
to	i
have	i
dinner	c
in	c
the	c
threatre	i
restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
due	c
to	c
some	c
problems	c
with	c
the	c
employees	c
.	c

What	c
was	c
suposed	i
to	c
be	c
a	c
perfect	c
and	c
enjoyable	c
evening	c
,	c
resulted	c
in	c
a	c
very	c
disappointing	c
time	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
would	c
be	c
greatful	i
if	c
you	c
payed	i
for	c
a	c
full	c
refund	c
of	c
the	c
money	c
I	c
spent	c
in	i
the	c
tickets	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

Modern	c
technology	c
affects	c
the	c
way	c
things	c
are	c
done	c
and	c
many	c
aspects	c
in	i
my	c
life	c
,	c
and	c
it	c
has	c
some	c
advantages	c
as	c
some	i
disadvantages	c
.	c

What	c
I	c
mean	c
is	c
that	c
computers	c
are	c
very	c
useful	c
to	i
do	i
my	c
homework	c
(	c
like	c
some	c
monographies	i
or	c
researching	i
)	c
.	c

The	c
best	c
example	c
is	c
the	c
homework	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
do	c
for	c
school	c
,	i
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
manage	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
when	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
my	c
computer	c
to	c
help	c
.	c

My	c
mother	c
says	c
that	c
I	c
'm	c
always	c
playing	c
with	c
my	c
computer	c
or	c
watching	c
T.V.	c
instead	c
of	c
reading	c
or	c
doing	c
some	c
more	c
interesting	c
activities	c
.	c

To	c
sump	i
up	c
,	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
think	c
about	i
how	i
my	c
life	c
would	c
be	c
without	i
technology	c
.	c

June	c
,	c
the	c
13th	c
2000	c

You	c
can	c
guess	c
how	c
an	i
enjoyable	i
surprise	i
receiving	c
your	c
letter	c
was	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
have	c
no	c
doubt	c
about	c
my	c
taste	c
for	c
camping	c
,	c
however	c
I	i
admit	c
I	c
will	c
appreciate	c
a	c
bit	c
of	c
comfort	c
two	i
weeks	i
long	i
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
I	c
must	c
recognize	i
that	c
the	c
activities	c
offered	c
are	c
really	c
attractive	c
so	c
it	c
's	c
hard	c
to	c
make	c
up	c
my	c
mind	c
.	c

Then	c
,	c
as	c
low	c
my	i
level	c
of	c
basketball	i
is	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
enjoyed	c
playing	c
this	c
sport	c
for	c
fun	c
for	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
.	c

So	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
pleasant	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
practice	i
this	c
activity	c
.	c

Nevertheless	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
you	c
to	c
precise	i
what	c
I	c
eventually	i
need	c
for	c
this	c
travel	i
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	i

What	c
obviously	i
appears	i
about	c
our	c
daily	c
life	c
at	c
school	c
is	c
that	c
it	c
is	c
hard	c
to	c
sum	c
up	c
all	c
the	c
different	c
aspects	c
it	c
includes	c
.	c

It	c
evoques	i
the	c
reason	c
of	i
our	c
presence	c
here	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
cliché	i
;	c
that	i
can	i
not	i
lack	i
.	c

Students	c
chatting	c
,	c
laughing	c
,	c
eating	c
and	c
even	c
smoking	c
must	c
remain	c
in	c
the	c
video	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
the	c
arrive	i
of	c
every	c
students	i
,	c
namely	i
the	i
picture	i
of	i
the	i
school	i
without	i
anybody	i
at	i
first	i
,	i
and	i
then	i
with	i
the	i
crowd	i
of	i
students	i
increasing	i
gradually	i
is	i
typical	i
of	i
its	i
life	i
.	c

Then	c
,	c
the	c
opposite	c
situation	c
,	c
that	c
is	c
to	c
say	c
the	c
scene	i
of	c
this	c
crowd	c
disappearing	c
at	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
the	c
day	c
can	c
make	i
a	c
parallel	i
.	c

I	c
have	c
recently	c
had	c
a	c
week	c
's	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
and	c
,	c
during	c
my	c
stay	c
,	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
'	c
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
'	c
,	c
which	c
was	c
shown	c
at	c
your	c
theatre	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
modern	c
technology	c
has	c
n't	c
changed	c
my	c
life	c
a	c
lot	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
has	c
in	c
some	c
things	c
:	c
I	c
work	c
with	c
music	c
and	c
with	c
graphic	c
design	c
too	c
,	c
and	c
computers	c
help	c
me	c
a	c
lot	c
in	i
this	i
things	c
.	c

In	c
graphic	c
design	c
,	c
before	c
having	i
a	c
computer	c
I	c
just	i
could	i
draw	c
,	c
but	c
now	c
I	c
can	c
create	c
pictures	c
pixel	c
by	c
pixel	c
,	c
develop	c
ideas	c
more	c
easily	c
,	c
or	c
take	i
photographs	c
into	c
my	c
computer	c
and	c
transform	c
them	c
or	c
mix	c
them	c
.	c

But	c
,	c
in	c
other	c
things	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
modern	c
technology	c
has	c
n't	c
changed	c
my	c
way	i
of	i
living	i
too	c
much	c
:	c
I	c
do	c
more	c
or	c
less	c
the	c
same	c
as	c
I	c
did	c
some	c
years	c
ago	c
:	c
I	c
get	c
up	c
in	c
the	c
morning	c
,	c
go	c
to	c
school	c
,	c
have	c
lunch	c
,	c
study	c
and	c
go	c
out	c
with	c
my	c
friends	c
without	c
being	c
afected	i
by	c
microchips	c
or	c
nuclear	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
because	c
I	c
think	c
you	c
should	c
give	i
me	c
a	i
good	c
accommodation	c
and	c
not	c
just	c
a	c
tent	c
to	c
sleep	c
in	c
,	c
with	c
no	c
electricity	c
and	i
entertainment	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
play	c
basketball	c
and	c
tennis	c
for	i
you	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
what	c
type	c
of	c
clothes	c
should	i
I	i
bring	c
?	c

Would	c
$	c
200	c
be	c
enough	c

The	c
concert	c
began	c
at	c
8:00	c
p.m	c
but	c
my	c
friends	c
and	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
be	c
there	c
by	c
2:00	c
pm	c
to	c
help	c
set	c
up	c
the	c
stage	c
.	c

We	c
started	c
by	c
putting	c
up	c
the	c
lights	c
.	c

We	c
had	c
to	c
climb	c
up	c
to	c
15m	c
to	c
put	c
up	c
those	c
lights	c
and	c
afterwards	c
the	c
band	c
did	c
n't	c
even	c
use	c
them	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Redford	c
,	c

I	c
have	c
also	c
read	c
that	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
start	c
at	c
19:30	c
but	c
it	c
did	c
n't	c
.	c

It	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
leaving	c
us	c
writing	i
for	c
fourty	i
five	c
minutes	c
.	c

I	c
also	c
ask	c
to	i
return	c
me	i
some	c
of	c
my	c
money	c
for	c
the	c
unpleasant	c
evening	c
I	c
passed	i
at	c
your	c
show	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
future	c
people	c
will	c
wear	c
clothes	c
made	c
of	c
polyseer	i
and	c
nylon	c
because	c
cotton	c
and	c
wool	c
will	c
be	c
rare	c
and	c
expensive	c
.	c

Clothes	c
will	c
be	c
bright	c
coloured	c
and	c
loose	c
.	c

Also	c
I	c
think	c
clothes	c
will	c
have	c
many	c
gadgets	c
on	c
them	c
like	c
a	c

oxygen	c
mask	c
in	c
case	c
someone	c
goes	c
in	c
a	c
place	c
with	c
extended	i
pollution	c
-	c
I	c
think	c
there	c
will	c
be	c
many	c
such	c
places	c
in	c
a	c
hundred	c
years	c
-	c
and	c
a	c

to	c
protect	c
people	c
from	c
the	c
strong	c
sunrays	i
of	c
the	c
sun	c
at	c
midday	c
because	c
the	c
ozone	c
layer	c
will	c
be	c
destroyed	c
in	c
a	c
hundred	c
years	c
and	c
the	c
sunrays	c
will	c
make	i
damage	c
to	c
the	c
human	c
skin	c
.	c

Also	c
the	c
clothes	c
in	c
a	c
hundred	c
years	c
will	c
have	c
the	c
ability	c
to	c
cool	c
down	c
the	c
people	c
who	c
wear	c
them	c
in	c
the	c
summer	c
and	c
the	c
same	c
clothes	c
will	c
keep	c
them	c
warm	c
in	i
cold	c
winters	c

days	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
you	i
in	c
response	c
to	c
your	c
letter	c
,	i
I	c
was	c
delighted	c
to	c
know	c
that	c
I	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
price	i
.	c

With	c
reference	c
to	c
the	c
date	c
,	c
I	c
only	i
can	i
go	c
on	i
July	c
,	c
as	c
I	c
'm	c
going	c
off	c
on	c
holiday	c
on	i
August	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
start	c
university	c
on	i
September	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
very	c
nice	c
of	c
you	c
to	c
let	c
me	c
choose	c
my	c
favourite	c
activities	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
I	c
'm	c
not	c
bad	c
at	c
painting	c
either	c
,	i
at	c
least	c
everyone	c
in	c
my	c
family	c
likes	c
my	c
work	c
,	c
includying	i
myself	c
.	c

Anyway	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
some	c
questions	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
:	c
What	i
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
would	c
be	c
the	c
most	c
suitable	c
for	c
California	c
weather	c
in	c
summer	c
,	c
and	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
do	c
you	c
think	c
I	c
'll	c
need	c
?	c

As	c
I	c
told	c
you	c
in	c
my	c
last	c
letter	c
,	c
last	c
month	c
I	c
worked	c
for	c
a	c
pop	c
band	c
,	c
and	c
helped	c
them	c
at	c
a	c
concert	c
in	c
Barcelona	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
such	c
a	c
great	c
experience	c
!	c

Basically	c
my	c
work	c
was	c
carrying	c
the	c
instruments	c
,	c
the	c
speakers	c
and	c
the	c
lights	c
from	c
the	c
vans	c
to	c
the	c
stage	c
,	c
which	c
is	c
not	c
an	i
easy	c
work	c
because	c
,	c
as	c
you	c
can	c
imagine	c
,	c
it	c
's	c
not	c
exactly	c
light	c
stuff	c
.	c

I	c
'd	c
better	c
leave	i
now	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
write	c
again	c
soon	c

I	c
will	c
be	c
pleased	c
to	c
swim	c
and	c
paint	c
when	c
I	c
am	c
at	c
the	c
camp	c

How	c
many	c
times	c
have	c
we	c
heard	c
people	c
complaining	c
about	c
shopping	c
?	c

Sometimes	c
,	c
they	c
are	c
happy	c
to	c
do	i
shopping	c
.	i

Shopping	c
is	c
enjoyable	c
when	c
you	c
want	c
to	c
offer	i
some	i
thing	i
to	c
someone	c
.	c

In	i
fact	i
you	c
try	c
to	c
get	c
a	c
present	c
to	c
make	c
receive	i
happy	c
.	c

Shopping	c
is	c
also	c
good	c
,	i
when	c
you	c
know	c
what	c
you	c
want	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
if	c
you	c
want	c
a	c
new	c
track	c
suit	c
you	c
know	c
that	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
a	c
sport	i
shop	c
but	c
if	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
what	c
you	c
want	c
you	c
are	c
going	c
to	c
waste	c
your	c
time	c
in	c
the	c
shops	c
.	c

That	c
is	c
to	c
say	c
,	c
they	c
are	c
never	c
happy	c
with	c
what	c
they	c
get	c
and	i
see	c
.	c

They	c
always	c
find	c
a	c
problem	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
stupid	c
,	i
they	i
do	c
not	c
have	c
any	c
goal	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
you	i
in	i
relation	i
to	i
our	c
next	c
programme	c
in	c
London	c
from	c
13th	c
March	c
to	c
14th	c
March	c
.	c

We	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
if	c
it	c
could	i
be	c
possible	c
to	c
introduce	c
a	c
little	c
change	c
in	c
our	c
programme	c
.	c

Our	c
question	c
is	c
:	c
instead	c
of	c
going	c
to	i
the	i
shopping	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
,	c
in	c
the	c
afternoon	c
,	c
could	c
we	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
?	c

Classroom	c
5	c

Believe	c
it	c
or	c
not	c
,	c
our	c
lives	c
are	c
changing	c
and	c
becoming	c
more	c
complicated	c
every	c
day	c
.	c

The	c
reason	c
of	i
all	c
of	c
this	c
things	i
is	c
the	c
impressionable	i
introduction	c
of	c
the	c
"	c
new	c
technologies	c
"	c
,	c
such	c
as	c
Computers	i
,	c
Internet	i
or	c
WAP	c
technologies	c
.	c

Of	c
course	c
,	c
this	i
new	c
facilities	i
will	c
be	c
introduced	c
at	c
home	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
we	c
will	c
have	c
got	i
computerizated	i
ovens	c
,	c
microwaves	c
and	c
freezers	c
,	c
or	c
we	c
will	c
probably	c
have	c
got	i
central	c
heating	c
controled	i
through	c
Internet	i
from	c
our	c
office	c
.	c

Despite	c
all	c
of	c
this	i
facilities	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
some	c
home	c
activities	c
that	c
will	c
remain	c
the	c
same	c
,	c
fortunately	c
.	c

We	c
are	c
human	c
beings	c
at	i
least	i
,	c
not	c
"	c
new	c
technological	c
"	c
machines	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
,	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
pleased	c
to	c
receive	c
your	c
letter	c
which	c
informed	c
me	c
of	c
my	c
winning	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
,	c
namely	c
two	c
weeks	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
in	c
the	c
USA	c
.	c

To	c
begin	c
with	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
log	c
cabins	c
are	c
more	c
comportable	i
than	c
tents	c
.	c

As	c
I	c
had	i
been	c
asked	c
to	c
choose	c
two	c
activities	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
during	i
my	c
stay	c
at	c
the	c
camp	c
,	c
I	c
chose	c
Golf	c
and	c
singing	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
never	c
played	c
Golf	c
actually	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
would	c
love	c
to	c
try	c
something	c
new	c
.	c

As	c
for	c
singing	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
keen	c
on	c
singing	c
as	c
I	c
get	i
lessons	c
in	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
just	c
love	c
singing	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
whether	c
there	c
is	i
some	c
facilities	c
for	c
washing	c
the	i
Clothes	c
.	c

Lastly	c
,	c
does	c
the	c
prize	c
include	c
pocket	c
money	c
?	c

Is	c
there	c
a	c
possibility	c
of	c
exchanging	c
different	c
currancies	i
to	c
US	c
dollar	i
?	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
at	c
your	c
earliest	c
convenience	c
.	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

It	c
sounds	c
nice	c
and	c
shopping	c
is	c
great	c
fun	c
-	c
or	c
it	c
should	c
be	c
.	c

Nowadays	c
shopping	c
can	c
be	c
very	c
stressful	c
.	c

It	c
all	c
starts	c
with	c
the	c
search	c
of	i
an	c
appropriate	c
parking-space	c
which	c
can	c
last	c
annoyingly	c
long	c
,	c
especially	c
at	c
weekends	c
.	c

Nevertheless	c
,	c
the	c
nightmare	c
starts	c
when	c
you	c
enter	c
the	c
shopping	c
mall	c
or	c
the	c
passage	c
,	c
which	c
is	c
terribly	c
crowded	c
.	c

It	c
gets	c
enormously	c
unbearable	c
in	i
hot	c
summer	c
days	c
,	c
when	c
the	c
temperature	c
increases	c
.	c

I	c
insisted	c
on	c
going	c
to	c
your	c
theatre	c
,	c
to	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
heard	c
that	c
it	c
is	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
best	c
theatres	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

And	c
he	c
played	i
awful	i
,	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
hear	c
him	c
.	c

What	c
is	c
more	c
you	i
wrote	c
that	c
discounts	c
available	i
,	c
but	c
it	i
was	c
also	c
lie	i
.	c

He	c
suggested	c
to	i
have	i
a	i
supper	c
in	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
.	c

But	c
when	c
we	c
came	i
to	c
it	c
,	c
we	c
saw	c
that	c
the	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
,	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
reconstructed	i
.	c

So	c
this	c
evening	c
was	c
terriable	i
.	c

The	c
first	c
change	c
is	c
that	c
they	c
very	i
simplify	c
the	c
life	c
of	c
people	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
now	c
women	c
do	c
n't	c
spend	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
time	c
at	i
the	c
kitchen	c
,	c
preparing	c
the	c
meal	c
or	c
washing	c
up	i
dishes	c
.	c

They	c
can	c
only	i
push	i
on	c
their	c
dish	i
mashiens	i
and	c
go	c
to	c
do	c
something	c
what	i
they	c
think	c
more	c
pleasant	c
.	c

Some	c
years	c
ago	c
people	c
especially	i
students	c
had	i
to	c
run	c
to	c
lubraries	i
in	c
order	c
to	c
find	c
a	c
book	c
about	c
something	c
.	c

Very	i
often	i
I	i
use	i
Internet	i
,	c
and	c
I	c
must	c
say	c
it	c
is	c
very	c
convienient	i
.	c

The	i
another	i
modern	i
technology	c
that	c
I	c
use	c
is	c
a	c
mobile	c
telephone	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

I	c
have	c
to	c
say	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
the	c
best	c
musical	c
show	c
.	c

Another	c
thing	c
was	c
the	c
hours	i
.	c

When	c
I	c
got	c
to	c
the	c
tickets	i
desk	i
before	c
the	c
show	c
to	c
buy	c
my	c
ticket	c
I	c
asked	c
for	c
a	c
senior	c
discount	c
,	c
and	c
the	c
woman	c
told	c
me	c
there	c
were	c
no	c
discounts	c
available	c
as	i
I	c
read	i
on	c
the	c
advertising	i
.	c

For	c
all	c
these	c
reasons	c
I	c
am	c
asking	c
you	c
to	c
give	c
my	i
money	c
back	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
,	c
in	c
fact	c
she	c
was	c
so	c
bad	c
at	c
that	c
she	c
put	i
me	c
in	c
such	i
trouble	c
.	c

Once	c
I	c
was	c
on	c
vacation	c
with	c
her	c
in	c
America	c
,	c
in	c
Chicago	c
to	c
be	c
exact	c
.	c

We	c
went	c
at	i
the	c
bar	c
and	c
ask	i
for	c
drink	i
with	i
alcohol	i
.	c

The	c
barman	c
asked	c
me	c
my	c
age	c
and	c
Pat	c
told	c
him	c
without	c
thinking	c
any	i
time	i
19	c
years	c
old	c
!	c

Then	c
she	c
realized	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
too	c
late	c
.	c

I	c
've	c
just	c
seen	c
your	c
letter	c
and	c
I	c
'm	c
really	c
delighted	c
to	c
have	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
be	c
in	c
log	i
cabins	i
because	c
I	c
feel	c
insecure	i
staying	c
in	c
tent	i
.	c

I	c
've	c
done	c
it	i
for	c
many	c
years	c
and	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
do	c
both	c
once	c
a	c
day	c
.	c

If	c
possible	c
,	c
could	c
you	c
let	c
me	c
know	c
what	c
I	c
'll	c
need	c
for	i
example	c
which	i
clothes	c
I	c
must	c
take	c
and	c
how	c
much	c
I	c
can	c
expect	c
to	c
spend	c
.	i

They	i
were	c
so	c
many	c
pieces	c
that	c
we	c
had	i
spent	i
a	c
whole	c
day	c
to	i
prepare	i
the	c
scene	i
.	c

At	c
the	c
end	c
,	c
we	c
have	i
had	i
a	c
beer	c
and	c
we	c
talked	c
together	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
astonished	c
to	c
see	c
so	i
friendly	c
and	c
funny	c
they	c
were	c
and	c
we	c
got	i
good	c
friends	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
difficult	c
to	c
explain	c
what	c
I	i
'd	i
particularly	i
liked	i
about	c
my	c
experience	c
because	c
the	i
most	i
memories	i
are	i
in	i
my	i
heart	i
and	c
I	c
'd	c
never	c
thought	c
that	c
I	c
could	c
get	c
on	c
so	c
well	c
with	c
a	c
group	c
of	c
people	c
which	i
I	c
'd	c
known	c
only	c
for	c
few	i
days	c
.	c

If	c
possible	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
introduce	i
you	c
to	c
them	c
,	i
they	i
are	c
very	c
nice	c
guys	c
.	c

I	c
wanted	c
to	c
spend	c
my	c
leisure	i
time	c
well	c
by	c
taking	c
in	c
that	c
cultural	c
event	c
.	c

How	c
stupid	c
of	c
me	c
!	c

I	c
felt	c
really	c
disappointed	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
in	i
the	c
advertisement	c
was	i
written	c
,	c
as	c
I	c
had	c
read	c
that	i
before	c
,	c
that	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
would	c
be	c
starring	c
in	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
the	i
different	c
actor	c
stood	c
in	c
for	c
in	i
it	i
.	c

The	i
time	i
of	i
the	i
beginning	i
of	i
the	i
show	i
was	c
written	c
at	i
half	c
past	c
two	c
p.m.	c
and	c
at	i
half	c
past	c
seven	c
that	c
evening	c
,	c
again	c
.	c

At	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
the	c
advertisement	c
as	i
I	c
noticed	c
it	c
was	i
said	i
something	c
of	i
perfect	i
evening	c
out	c
.	c

That	c
's	c
why	c
I	c
write	i
my	c
letter	c
to	c
you	c
and	c
I	c
ask	i
for	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
expecting	c
something	c
really	i
better	c
.	c

People	c
living	c
in	c
the	c
past	c
could	c
n't	c
travel	c
so	c
far	i
as	c
we	c
could	i
now	c
and	c
could	c
n't	c
express	i
the	c
news	c
around	c
the	c
world	c
as	c
we	c
do	c
it	i
now	c
,	c
at	i
present	i
days	i
.	c

So	c
,	c
we	c
are	c
in	c
better	i
situation	c
now	c
.	c

And	c
the	c
modern	c
technology	c
that	c
we	c
use	c
in	c
our	c
everyday	c
life	c
might	c
not	c
only	c
help	c
us	c
,	c
but	c
determinly	i
might	c
destroy	c

Dear	c
Mr.	c
Robertson	c

That	i
show	c
is	c
free	c
for	c
students	c
,	c
so	i
it	i
's	i
also	c
a	c
big	c
advantage	c
.	c

On	c
Monday	c
we	c
could	c
first	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
Sience	i
Museum	c
and	c
in	c
the	c
afternoon	c
to	c
Greenwich	c
.	c

Then	c
we	c
could	c
go	c
sightseeing	c
by	c
bus	c
on	c
Wednesday	c
after	c
lunchtime	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Your	i
sincerely	c

Who	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
be	c
famous	c
?	c

Are	i
you	i
dreaming	i
of	c
being	c
a	c
Star	i
?	c

It	c
must	c
be	c
wonderful	c
when	c
you	c
have	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
money	c
and	c
everybody	c
seems	c
to	c
know	c
you	c
.	c

Really	i
?	c

I	c
think	c
the	c
main	c
problem	c
is	c
that	c
you	c
would	c
lose	c
your	c
private	c
life	c
.	c

That	c
's	c
the	c
price	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
pay	c
nowadays	c
.	c

But	c
then	c
everyone	c
will	c
recognise	c
you	c
when	c
you	c
are	c
walking	c
on	i
the	c
street	c
.	c

There	c
's	c
no	c
other	c
way	c
.	c

Everone	i
knows	c
you	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
journalists	c
so	i
ca	i
n't	c
just	c
ignore	c
them	c
,	c
can	c
you	c
?	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
,	c

Besides	c
,	i
we	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
And	i
Leisure	c
Show	c
,	c
which	c
was	c
advertised	c
in	c
the	c
newspaper	i
"	i
Metro	i
"	i
yesterday	c
.	c

We	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
suggest	c
you	c
change	c
shopping	i
date	i
to	c
Wednesday	c
afternoon	c
,	c
because	c
we	c
have	c
free	i
time	c
on	c
Wednesday	c
afternoon	c
.	c

Private	i
Life	c
For	c
Everyone	c
.	c

Everyone	c
deserve	i
private	i
life	c
.	c

However	c
most	i
famous	c
people	c
,	c
for	c
example	c
football	c
player	i
and	c
film	c
stars	c
,	c
have	c
not	c
got	c
any	i
privet	i
life	c
.	c

They	c
feel	c
exhausted	c
to	i
be	i
followed	c
by	c
journalists	c

Ealyer	i
I	c
had	c
seen	c
an	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
show	c
but	c
the	c
informationes	i
on	c
it	c
caused	i
fals	i
.	c

The	c
second	c
think	i
is	c
that	c
the	c
play	c
did	c
not	c
start	c
at	c
19:30	c
but	c
at	c
20:15	c
!	c

I	c
could	c
not	c
get	c
a	c
discount	c
.	c

The	c
last	c
think	i
is	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
unpossible	i
to	c
get	i
the	i
theatre	c
restaurant	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
told	c
that	c
it	c
had	c
been	c
painted	c
but	c
nobody	c
had	c
written	c
it	i
on	c
an	i
advertisement	c
.	c

Modern	c
technology	c
is	c
changing	c
world	i
every	c
day	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
write	c
how	i
it	c
has	c
influented	i
my	c
daily	c
life	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
neaded	i
some	c
informationes	i
I	c
had	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
liblary	i
to	c
find	c
it	c
in	c
books	c
or	c
newspapers	c
.	c

Now	c
the	c
only	c
think	i
I	c
have	c
to	c
do	c
is	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
computer	i
room	c
and	c
turn	c
on	c
the	c
computer	c
.	c

The	c
computer	c
is	c
helpfull	i
when	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
contact	c
somebody	c
very	c
fast	c
.	c

I	c
just	c
send	c
an	c
e-mail	c
and	c
that	c
is	c
all	c
!	c

It	c
is	c
obvious	c
that	c
modern	c
technology	c
has	c
changed	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
in	i
behalf	c
of	c
my	c
class-	i
maid	i
about	c
the	c
programme	c
you	c
had	i
organised	c
for	c
us	c
.	c

We	c
all	c
want	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
having	c
choose	i
such	c
good	c
places	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

We	c
are	c
especially	c
excited	c
about	c
the	c
river	c
trip	c
to	c
greenwich	i
which	c
will	c
be	c
in	i
the	c
first	c
day	c
.	c

We	c
hope	c
you	c
accept	c
this	c
change	c
for	i
good	i
.	c

Last	c
summer	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
amazon	i
on	c
an	c
expedition	c
with	c
other	i
10	i
people	c
,	i
such	i
as	i
a	c
guide	c
,	c
a	c
doctor	c
,	c
a	c
scientist	c
&	c
all	c
the	c
rest	i
as	c
me	c
were	c
just	c
curious	c
.	c

But	c
for	c
me	c
it	c
was	c
the	c
most	c
exciting	c
moment	c
.	c

The	c
view	c
took	i
my	c
breath	c
of	i
when	c
suddenly	c
something	c
took	c
my	c
breath	c
.	i

I	c
knew	c
I	c
could	c
not	c
do	i
any	c
moviment	i
for	c
my	c
safety	c
but	c
I	c
did	c
and	c
for	i
my	c
surprise	c
It	i
run	i
away	c
.	c

With	c
reference	c
to	c
your	c
letter	c
of	c
13th	i
of	c
June	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
the	c
prize	c
your	c
organisation	c
is	c
offering	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
be	c
grateful	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
book	c
a	c
tent	c
for	c
me	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
nature	c
lover	c
and	c
the	c
idea	c
of	c
outdoor-sleeping	i
really	c
makes	c
me	c
happy	c
.	c

Concerning	c
the	c
activities	c
,	c
as	i
a	i
matter	i
of	i
fact	i
tennis	c
is	c
my	c
favorit	i
sport	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
keen	c
on	c
it	c
,	i
for	i
the	c
second	c
activity	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
enroll	i
surfing	i
,	c
because	c
my	c
husband	c
,	c
who	c
is	c
already	c
a	c
proficient	c
,	i
keeps	c
telling	c
me	c
about	c
the	c
excitement	c
of	c
this	c
sport	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
worthwile	i
trying	c
,	c
therefore	c
I	c
'd	c
love	c
to	c
be	c
in	c
the	c
beginners	i
group	c
.	c

Once	c
students	c
have	c
taken	c
a	c
shower	c
after	c
a	i
hard	c
physical	c
training	c
they	c
come	i
to	i
real	c
life	c
,	i
depending	i
on	c
their	c
levels	c
they	i
have	c
to	c
study	c
for	i
instance	i
languages	c
wich	i
I	c
personally	c
find	c
very	c
important	c
for	c
a	c
person	c
working	c
in	c
the	c
tourism	c
field	i
because	c
these	i
enables	i
stuff	i
to	c
communicate	c
with	c
clients	c
in	c
a	c
proper	c
way	c
,	i
students	i
have	c
to	c
manage	c
to	c
speak	c
at	c
least	c
three	c
languages	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
will	c
not	c
have	c
finished	c
my	c
university	c
course	c
until	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
the	i
June	c
so	c
I	c
can	c
only	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
tents	i
than	i
log	i
cabins	i
.	c

I	c
have	c
been	c
swimming	c
for	i
8	i
years	i
for	i
a	i
club	i
and	c
enjoying	i
a	i
lot	c
.	c

I	c
need	c
some	c
more	c
information	c
about	c
the	i
camp	c
life	c
and	c
also	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
what	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
take	c
with	c
me	c

For	c
exemple	i
,	c
how	c
much	c
pocket	c
money	c
will	c
be	c
enough	c
and	c
which	i
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
should	c
wear.	i

I	c
am	c

To	c
whome	i
it	c
may	c
concern	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
tell	c
that	i
I	c
had	c
a	c
very	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
regarding	i
a	c
musical	c
show	c
at	c
your	c
theatre	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
the	c
advertisement	c
told	i
that	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
was	c
going	c
to	c
starr	i
in	c
a	i
musical	c
but	c
it	c
turned	c
out	c
a	i
completely	c
different	c
person	c
which	i
was	c
very	c
disappointing	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
that	c
you	c
will	c
consider	c
this	c
letter	c
seriously	i
and	c
try	c
to	c
improve	c
your	c
service	i
.	c

Pat	c
,	c
too	c
,	c
are	i
friend	i
of	c
them	i
and	c
has	c
seen	c
them	c
time	i
to	c
time	c
.	c

As	c
Molly	c
did	c
n't	c
know	c
this	c
,	c
she	c
was	c
so	c
surprised	c
and	c
tried	c
to	c
ask	c
more	c
about	c
it	c
.	c

She	c
did	c
n't	c
mean	c
to	c
do	c
so	i
,	c
but	c
this	c
kind	c
of	c
thing	c
happens	c
a	c
lot	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
on	i
july	i
because	c
my	c
school	c
will	c
have	c
finished	c
that	c
month	c
so	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
go	c
on	c
holiday	c
.	c

And	c
if	c
it	c
is	c
possible	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
rather	c
be	c
accommadated	i
in	c
log	c
cabins	c
because	c
I	c
would	c
not	c
like	c
to	c
share	c
the	c
bathroom	c
facilities	c
someone	i
who	c
I	c
do	c
not	c
know	c
well	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
asking	c
me	c
to	c
choose	c
the	i
list	c
of	c
the	i
activities	c
.	c

I	c
feel	c
,	i
it	c
will	c
be	c
the	c
best	c
holiday	c
,	i
I	c
have	c
ever	c
had	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

it	i
causes	i
over	i
crowded	i
shops	c
,	c
high-pitch	i
noise	c
,	c
lack	i
of	c
parking	c
place	i
and	c
if	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
go	c
shopping	c
with	c
a	c
child	c
,	c
the	c
whole	c
matters	i
just	c
enough	i
to	c

you	c
crazy	c
.	c

According	c
to	c
the	c
advertisement	c
,	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
actor	i
who	c
had	i
to	i
show	i
was	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
but	c
for	c
some	c
unknown	c
reasons	c
,	c
there	c
was	c
another	c
disappointing	i
actor	c
instead	c
of	c
him	c
.	c

By	c
the	c
way	c
,	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
,	c
when	c
it	c
had	i
to	c
start	c
at	c
19:30	c
:	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
in	i
late	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
to	i
much	i
in	i
late	c
.	c

Well	c
,	c
it	c
seems	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
my	c
perfect	c
evening	c
and	c
for	c
all	c
these	c
reasons	c
I	c
pretend	i
to	c
have	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
,	c
I	c
waisted	i
£	c
20	c
to	c
see	c
a	c
show	c
which	c
does	c
n't	c
respect	c
the	c
programm	i
I	c
payed	i
for	c

Science	c
and	c
technology	c
have	c
changed	c
man	c
's	c
life	c
:	c
that	c
's	c
true	c
,	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
need	c
to	c
look	c
how	i
they	c
affect	c
the	c
lives	c
of	c
the	i
others	c
,	c
I	c
have	i
only	i
to	c
see	c
how	c
they	c
have	c
changed	c
my	c
life	c
.	c

Science	c
and	c
technology	c
can	c
be	c
useful	c
:	c
see	c
for	c
example	c
the	c
use	c
of	c
tv	i
in	c
the	c
school	c
or	c
the	c
use	c
of	c
the	c
radio	c
to	c
learn	c
a	c
foreign	c
language	c
or	c
the	c
use	c
of	c
the	c
computer	c
to	c
have	i
further	c
information	c
about	c
something	c
intersts	i
you	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
incredible	c
but	c
if	c
I	c
think	c
of	c
the	c
key-word	c
of	c
mind	i
,	c
the	c
only	c
one	c
I	c
can	c
think	c
of	c
is	c
ORDER	c
.	c

Yesterday	c
my	c
grandmother	c
asked	c
me	c
what	c
will	i
I	i
do	c
without	c
the	c
computer	c
.	c

All	c
of	c
us	c
in	c
English	i
class	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
visiting	c
these	c
places	c
.	c

We	c
would	c
appreciate	c
it	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
give	c
us	c
a	c
chance	c
to	c
go	c
there	c
while	c
we	c
are	c
visiting	c
in	i
London	c
.	c

Most	c
of	i
students	c
in	c
our	c
class	c
are	c
studying	c
Fashion	c
as	i
full-time	c
.	c

But	c
the	c
only	c
problem	c
for	i
the	c
show	c
is	c
the	c
date	c
which	c
is	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
14	c
March	c
from	c
10.00	c
to	c
19.00	c
.	c

But	c
Mr.	c
Robertson	c
,	c
these	c
our	i
suggestions	c
are	i
depended	i
on	c
your	c
programme	c
,	c
we	c
're	c
just	c
suggesting	c
.	c

Have	c
you	c
ever	c
thought	c
about	c
our	c
future	c
home	c
?	c

The	c
prises	i
for	c
lands	i
are	c
getting	i
increasing	c
it	i
's	i
because	c
of	c
this	c
reason	i
.	c

So	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
the	c
future	c
home	c
could	i
be	i
considered	i
this	i
points	i
.	c

I	c
mean	c
most	c
of	i
home	i
are	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
in	c
a	c
building	c
like	c
a	c
flat	c
.	c

I	c
believe	c
there	c
are	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
high	c
buildings	c
now	c
in	c
Japan	c
.	c

But	c
what	c
my	i
imagination	i
is	c
that	c
these	c

'll	c
have	c
many	c
functions	c
such	c
as	c
offices	c
,	c
leisure	c
centre	c
,	c
shopping	c
centre	c
even	c
school	c
.	c

But	c
one	c
more	c
thing	c
,	c
I	c
believe	c
these	c
flats	c
'll	c
have	c
a	c
park	c
for	c
people	c
who	c
'll	c
be	c
living	c
in	c
there	i
.	c

And	c
because	c
it	c
'll	c
be	c
a	c
big	c
building	c
we	c
'll	c
able	i
to	c
see	c
a	c
whole	i
view	c
through	c
the	c
window	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
will	c
consider	c
our	c
suggestion	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Much	c
safer	c
but	c
still	c
at	c
home	c

Our	c
homes	c
will	c
be	c
different	c
in	c
the	i
way	i
to	c
protect	c
our	c
family	c
from	c
theives	c
.	c

That	c
is	i
,	c
our	c
security	c
system	c
will	c
be	c
much	c
stronger	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
what	c
migh	i
still	c
be	c
the	c
same	c
is	c
to	c
have	c
good	c
places	c
to	c
take	c
a	c
rest	c
at	c
home	c
,	c
such	c
as	c
a	c
beautiful	c

Dear	c
manager	c
,	c

Last	c
week	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
Circle	c
theatre	c
,	c
of	i
which	c
you	c
are	c
responsable	i
,	c
to	c
se	i
the	c
musical	c
show	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
.	c

Everything	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
has	c
been	c
done	c
in	c
the	c
Wrong	c
Way	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
joined	i
the	c
show	c
because	c
I	c
like	c
DANNY	c
BROOK	c
a	c
lot	c
,	c
but	c
you	c
have	i
changed	c
the	c
program	i
.	c

Because	c
of	c
my	c
"	c
isolation	c
"	c
telephone	i
is	c
very	c
important	c
and	c
I	c
need	c
a	c
good	c
personal	c
computer	c
with	c
a	c
modem	c
and	c
internet	i
so	i
study	i
or	c
do	c
researches	i
,	c
because	c
there	c
are	c
not	c
book	i
shops	c
to	c
buy	c
or	c
borrow	c
books	c
in	c
my	c
little	c
town	c
.	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
can	c
play	c
basketball	c
very	c
well	c
I	i
would	c
be	c
grateful	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
teach	c
me	c
to	c
play	c
golf	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
you	c
suggest	c
to	i
bring	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
be	c
grateful	c
to	c
receive	c
some	c
information	c
about	c
the	c
meals	c
at	c
the	c
camp	c
and	c
I	c
hope	c
that	c
it	c
will	c
not	c
be	c
a	c
problem	c
for	c
you	c
if	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
vegan	c
.	c

It	c
would	c
be	c
nice	c
to	c
film	c
an	c
Ancient	c
Greek	c
Poetry	i
lesson	c
because	c
Ancient	i
Greek	c
teacher	c
is	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
explaining	c
;	c
she	c
is	c
excellent	c
at	c
catching	c
our	c
attention	c
and	c
she	c
wants	c
everyone	c
to	c
tell	c
the	c

Saturday	c
17th	c
June	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
your	c
musical	c
show	c
.	c

Some	c
problems	c
of	c
organisation	c
seem	c
to	c
be	i
appeared	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
hoped	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
relaxing	c
entertainment	i
with	i
your	c
musical	i
show	c
but	c
it	i
was	i
not	i
the	i
case	i
.	c

In	c
your	c
advertisement	c
you	c
announced	c
the	c
actors	c
were	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
.	c

They	c
were	c
replaced	c
by	c
less	c
famous	c
actors	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
terribly	c
disappointed	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
to	c
wait	c
for	c
45	c
minutes	c
without	i
nothing	i
doing	i
.	c

Your	c
assistant	c
prevented	c
us	c
from	c
visiting	c
it	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
too	c
late	c
and	c
he	c
was	c
so	c
busy	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
science	c
and	c
technology	c
will	c
have	c
consequences	c
on	c
my	c
behaviours	i
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
without	c
using	c
internet	i
I	c
could	c
not	c
put	i
me	i
through	c
to	c
foreign	c
people	c
.	c

This	c
interactive	c
way	i
of	c
communication	c
allows	c
me	c
to	c
reach	c
everybody	c
everywhere	c
without	c
restrictions	c
.	c

Be	c
carefull	i
,	c
my	c
own	c
technology	c
can	c
kill	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
can	c
use	c
it	c
but	c
with	i
some	i
limits	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

I	c
have	c
received	c
your	c
letter	c
about	c
the	c
prize	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
can	c
arrange	c
this	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
to	c
avoid	c
these	c
this	c
time	c
.	c

Swimming	c
is	c
another	c
sport	c
I	c
learned	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
six	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
a	c
few	c
questions	c
about	c
the	c
camp	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
vegetarian	c
and	c
ca	c
n't	c
eat	c
any	c
milk	c
products	c
.	c

Are	c
there	c
any	c
special	c
clothes	c
you	c
suggest	c
?	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

It	c
was	c
absolutely	c
amazing	c
.	c

We	c
started	c
at	c
7	c
am	i
.	i

to	c
let	c
them	c
in	i
the	c
concert	c
area	c
.	c

Fans	c
were	c
n't	c
allowed	c
to	c
take	c
any	c
sharp	c
things	c
with	i
them	c
,	c
like	c
knifes	i
or	c
scissors	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
great	c
experience	c
.	c

I	c
met	c
new	c
people	c
which	i
I	c
still	c
see	c
.	c

Love	c

Hello	c
,	c

I	c
'm	c
so	c
glad	c
I	c
won	c
this	c
prize	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
have	c
some	c
questions	c
for	c
you	c
,	c
and	c
of	c
course	c
,	c
the	c
answers	i
you	c
asked	c
me	c
.	i

And	c
for	c
me	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
tents	i
would	c
be	c
better	c
,	i
I	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
why	c
but	c
,	i
I	c
feel	c
more	c
comfortable	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
's	c
because	c
the	c
last	c
time	c
I	c
travelled	c
(	c
with	c
my	c
friends	c
)	c
,	c
we	c
stayed	c
at	i
log	c
cabins	c
,	c
and	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
sleeping	c
felt	i
some	i
thing	i
moving	c
in	i
my	c
skin	c
,	c
then	c
I	c
work	i
up	c
frightened	c
and	c
when	c
I	c
openned	i
my	c
eyes	c
,	c
I	c
saw	c
lots	c
of	c
big	c
ants	c
!	c

After	c
that	c
day	c
,	c
I	c
've	c
never	c
stayed	c
at	i
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
.	c

Yeah	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
's	c
why	c
!	c

And	c
the	c
other	c
activity	c
is	c
singing	c
.	c

Everybody	c
says	c
I	c
have	c
an	c
excellent	c
voice	c
,	i
I	c
like	c
to	c
sing	c
when	c
I	c
painting	i
too	c
,	i
it	i
's	i
so	c
relaxing	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothe	i
I	c
probably	i
will	i
use	i
there	c
?	c

And	c
how	c
much	c
clothe	i
?	c

(	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
buy	c
something	c
for	c
a	c
friend	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
his	c
birthday	c
)	c
when	i
I	c
found	c
a	c
beautiful	c
store	c
,	i
I	c
stopped	c
in	c
front	c
of	c
it	c
and	c
start	i
looking	c
at	c
the	c
window	c
(	i
outside	c
)	c
,	c
then	c
I	c
thought	c
interesting	i
and	c
came	i
in	c

Suddenly	c
,	c
I	c
saw	c
a	c
man	c
with	c
a	c
cap	c

his	c

I	c
did	c
n't	c

what	c
to	c
do	c

I	c
was	c
sure	c
he	c
was	c

even	c
a	c
murther	i

And	c
his	c

was	c
sick	c

he	c
and	c
his	c
producers	c
were	c
looking	c
for	c
one	c

I	c
met	c
all	c
the	c
staff	c

and	c
Ricky	c
took	c
lots	c
of	c
fotographs	i
with	c
me	c

Tennis	c
I	c
only	c
started	c
four	c
years	c
ago	c
,	c
but	c
have	c
found	c
that	c
I	c
am	c
quite	c
talented	c
at	c
it	c
,	c
having	c
won	c
several	c
competitions	c
during	c
the	c
last	c
two	c
years	c
or	c
so	c

The	c
book	c
Cry	c
Freedom	c
by	c
John	c
Briley	c
is	c
certainly	c
one	c
which	c
will	c
take	c
its	c
place	c
in	c
South	c
African	c
history	c
.	c

Generations	c
of	c
young	c
South	c
Africans	c
black	i
,	c
white	c
or	c
brown	c
will	i
be	c
reminded	c
of	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
worst	c
times	c
their	c
country	c
went	c
through	c
.	c

Steve	c
Biko	c
for	c
becoming	c
a	c
martyr	c
to	c
the	c
black	c
freedom	c
movement	c
of	c
these	i
dark	c
years	c

A	c
peaceful	c
man	c
who	c
was	c
caught	c
up	c
in	c
the	c
wills	i
of	c

regime	c
,	c
dying	c
such	c
a	c
violent	c
death	c

I	c
spent	c
two	c
days	c
at	c
the	c
last	c
annual	c
international	c
arts	c
festival	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
congratulate	c
on	i
the	c
organization	c
.	c

An	c
internation	i
arts	c
festival	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
idea	c
,	c
but	c
at	c
the	c
last	c
die	i
there	c
were	c
starts	i
and	c
artists	c
from	c
only	c
six	c
countries	c
,	c
and	c
it	c
could	c
be	c
more	c
interesting	c
to	c
have	c
the	c
possibility	i
to	c
meet	c
artists	c
and	c
stars	c
from	c
more	c
than	c
six	c
cultures	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
not	c
listen	c
to	c
one	c
of	c
my	c
favorite	i
classic	i
concert	i
,	c
"	c
La	c
Moldava	c
"	c
by	c
Smetana	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
glad	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
that	c
one	c
reasonably-priced	i
weekend	c
ticket	c
for	c
all	c
events	c
is	c
an	c
excellent	c
idea	c
because	c
also	i
people	c
who	c
do	c
not	c
have	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
money	c
can	c
enjoy	c
the	c
festival	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
read	c
your	c
letter	c
I	c
was	c
surprised	c
because	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
know	c
that	c
you	c
have	i
so	c
many	c
rules	c
both	c
at	c
school	c
and	c
at	c
home	c

Write	c
soon	c

Love	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
,	c

It	c
seems	c
so	c
exciting	c
.	c

And	c
I	c
have	c
a	c
plan	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
visit	c
my	c
parents	c
in	c
Bangkok	c
,	c
Thailand	c
,	c
in	c
the	c
middle	c
of	c
August	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
July	c
is	c
the	c
best	c
time	c
to	c
go	c
for	i
the	c
Camp	c
.	c

For	c
accommodation	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
tents	c
because	c
I	c
get	i
used	c
to	c
it	i
.	c

Because	c
I	c
'm	c
not	c
good	c
at	c
sporting	i
,	c
so	i
I	c
will	c
choose	c
singing	c
and	c
photography	c
as	c
my	c
activities	c
.	c

What	c
type	c
of	c
clothes	c
and	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
do	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
prepare	i
?	c

I	c
strongly	c
agree	c
with	c
this	c
sentence	c
.	c

I	c
bought	c
lots	c
of	c
new	c
fashion	i
clothes	c
,	c
bags	c
and	c
shoes	c
.	c

Four	i
years	c
in	i
the	i
university	c
I	c
never	c
had	c
saving	i
money	i
.	c

Little	i
grandson	c
tried	c
to	c
help	c
his	c
grandfather	c
who	i
was	c
70	c
years	c
old	i
by	c
hiring	i
himself	i
out	i
as	c
a	c
gardener	c
after	c
school	c
,	c
though	c
he	c
was	c
only	c
10	c
years	c
old	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr.	c
Smith	c
,	c

And	c
the	c
biggest	c
disappointment	c
for	c
me	c
was	c
that	c
the	c
grateful	i
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
the	c
best	c
singer	c
in	c
London	c
,	c
was	c
n't	c
present	c
and	c
it	i
was	i
singing	i
a	i
mother	i
unknown	i
person	i
.	c

And	c
last	c
but	c
not	c
least	c
I	i
recognised	i
after	c
the	c
show	c
that	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
waiters	c
did	c
n't	c
come	c
...	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
it	i
is	c
a	c
typical	c
situation	c
in	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatrer	i
that	c
is	i
promised	i
much	c
more	c
then	c
the	c
people	c
can	c
get	c
for	c
their	c
money	c
,	c
or	c
it	i
was	c
on	c
June	c
7	c
(	c
my	c
visit	c
)	c
only	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
am	i
not	c
agree	i
with	i
such	c
situation	i
and	c
would	i
ask	c
you	c
for	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
-	c
my	c
bank	c
account	c
number	c
is	c
enclosed	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
for	i
you	i
answering	i
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
modern	i
technology	c
changed	i
our	c
daily	c
life	c
tremendously	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
it	c
changed	c
our	c
life-style	i
.	c

People	c
today	c
are	c
more	c
open	i
for	c
the	c

The	i
ordered	i
goods	c

be	c
deliver	i
in	c
shorter	i
time	c
by	c
train	i
,	c
trucks	c
and	c
modern	c
ships	c
.	c

If	c
we	c
are	c
more	c
efficient	c
we	c
can	c
earn	c
more	c
money	c
and	c
spend	c
it	c
more	c

Sir/Madam	c

During	c
my	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
.	c

I	c
found	c
your	c
advertisement	c
in	c
the	c
tourism	i
officis	i
and	c
how	i
the	c
musical	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
"	c
seemed	c
to	c
be	c
a	c
good	c
option	c
I	c
choose	i
it	c
.	c

Another	c
problem	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
in	i
the	i
place	i
of	c
19:30	c
and	c
when	c
it	c
finished	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
have	c
a	i
dinner	c
because	c
the	c
theatre	c
's	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
(	c
it	c
closes	c
at	c
22:00	c
)	c
.	c

yours	c
faithfully	c

We	i
'll	i
understand	c
why	c
I	c
'm	c
writing	c
in	i
the	c
past	c
.	c

Last	c
weekend	c
we	c
diced	i
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
bach	i
with	c
Pat	c
and	c
Nick	c
(	c
her	c
boyfriend	c
)	c
.	c

Lyter	i
a	c
long	c
time	c
walking	c
we	c
decided	c
to	c
return	c
and	c
how	i
the	c
weather	c
was	c
so	c
hot	c
we	c
found	i
a	c
place	c
to	c
drink	c
something	c
.	c

I	c
called	c
Nick	c
to	c
go	c
search	c
the	i
girls	c
(	c
he	c
was	c
in	c
the	c
WC	c
)	c
and	c
said	c
goodbye	c
to	c
she	i
.	c

When	c
we	c
met	c
the	c
girls	c
Eingrid	c
was	c
furious	c
,	c
she	c
said	c
me	i
that	c
Pat	c
had	c
saw	i
me	c
kissing	c
another	c
girl	c
and	c
our	c
relationship	c
was	c
over	c
!	c

I	c
'm	c
really	c
very	c
unlucked	i
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
you	c
might	c
not	c
know	c
what	c
this	c
show	c
is	c
.	i

In	i
fact	i
,	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
big	c
exhibition	c
of	c
the	c
latest	c
fashions	c
,	c
leisure	c
and	c
sports	c
wear	c
,	c
make	i
up	i
and	c
hairstyles	c
.	c

It	c
would	c
be	c
interesting	c
for	c
us	c
to	c
see	c
all	c
that	c
"	c
live	c
"	c
,	c
rather	c
than	c
on	c
TV	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
for	c
us	c
because	c
the	i
entry	c
is	c
free	c
for	c
students	c
so	c
it	c
will	c
not	c
affect	c
the	c
budget	c
.	c

We	c
all	c
think	c
that	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
most	c
enjoyable	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
Science	i
museum	c
until	c
about	c
11	c
o'clock	c
and	c
then	c
move	c
to	i
the	c
show	c
.	c

We	c
all	c
hope	c
you	c
will	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
find	c
a	c
good	c
solution	c
without	c
causing	c
too	c
much	c
trouble	c
.	c

Terror	c
in	c
the	c
Alps	c

It	c
was	c
dangerous	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
knew	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
.	c

We	c
were	c
there	c
,	c
alone	c
,	c
my	c
friend	c
with	c
his	c
broken	c
leg	c
and	c
myself	c
.	c

He	c
could	c
n't	c
move	c
any	c
more	c
and	c
my	c
mobilephone	i
was	c
not	c
able	c
to	c
find	c
a	c
proper	c
network	c
.	c

We	c
were	c
trapped	c
!	c

I	c
finally	c
decided	c
to	c
carry	c
him	c
on	c
my	c
back	c
on	i
the	i
way	i
back	c
to	c
the	c
rescue	c
chalet	c
.	c

The	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
was	c
so	i
far	i
the	c
best	c
theatre	c
in	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
but	c
now	c
,	c
I	c
must	c
change	c
my	c
opinion	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	i
to	c
see	c
the	c
best	c
musical	c
show	c
with	c
the	c
best	c
artists	c
.	c

In	i
accordance	i
with	i
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
to	c
return	c
me	c
my	c
money	c
.	c

"	c
Fashion	c
of	c
the	c
Future	c
"	c
-	c
it	c
is	c
good	i
question	c
.	c

Of	c
course	c
,	c
it	i
will	i
be	i
smart	i
clothes	i
.	c

Young	c
people	c
will	c
wear	c
jeans	c
and	c
T-shirt	i
.	c

Such	c
clothes	c
is	i
comfortable	c
and	c
easy	c
in	i
using	i
.	c

Teenagers	c
have	c
not	i
free	c
time	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
a	i
washing-cleaner	i
.	c

Men	c
will	c
wear	c
as	c
usualy	i
-	c
a	c
suit	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
,	i
we	c
will	c
observe	c
a	c
little	i
and	i
slow	c
changes	c
in	c
fashion	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
hope	c
that	c
new	c
clothes	c
will	c
be	i
always	i
pleasent	i
for	c
people	c
.	c

The	c
river	c
trip	c
to	c
Greenwich	c
is	c
certainly	c
something	c
we	c
are	c
all	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
,	c
but	c
due	i
to	i
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
show	c
,	c
my	c
class	c
asked	i
me	c
to	c
propose	i
a	c
change	c
in	c
our	c
schedule	c
.	c

The	c
event	c
will	c
take	c
place	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
,	c
14th	c
of	c
March	c
,	c
so	c
instead	c
of	c
going	c
to	c
the	c
Science	c
Museum	c
and	c
then	c
going	c
shopping	c
,	c
we	c
could	c
spend	c
the	c
day	c
visiting	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sarah	c
,	c

Best	c
Detective	c
Stories	c
of	i
Agatha	c
Christie	c
would	c
be	c
or	i
not	i
a	i
good	i
present	i
for	c
your	c
cousin	c
.	c

Well	c
,	c
having	c
read	c
the	c
book	c
before	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
say	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
great	c
idea	c
!	c

You	c
told	c
me	c
your	c
cousin	c
likes	c
suspense	c
books	c
and	c
stories	c
,	c
the	c
ones	c
you	i
keep	c
trying	c
to	c
figure	c
it	i
out	c
who	c
is	c
the	c
killer	c
.	c

Specially	i
because	c
there	c
is	c
n't	c
just	c
one	c
story	c
,	c
but	c
a	c
whole	c
lot	c
of	c
them	c
.	c

Now	c
,	c
tell	c
me	c
more	c
about	c
you	c
.	c

My	c
school	c
has	c
finished	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
'll	c
need	c
to	c
sit	c
a	c
big	c
exam	c
at	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
this	c
month	c
so	c
that	c
I	c
can	c
go	c
into	i
College	i
.	c

My	c
parents	c
and	c
I	c
will	c
spend	c
our	c
holidays	c
in	c
Australia	c
and	c
I	c
just	c
could	c
n't	c
be	c
happier	c
!	c

Love	c

We	c
all	c
agree	c
that	c
we	c
are	c
going	c
to	i
join	i
the	c
school	c
trip	c
to	c
Science	i
Museum	c
,	c
which	c
is	c
the	c
most	c
interesting	c
trip	c
for	c
us	c
.	c

Anyway	c
,	c
intstead	i
of	c
go	i
shopping	c
in	c
the	c
afternoon	c
session	c
,	c
we	c
will	c
attend	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

This	c
is	c
the	c
solution	c
that	c
we	c
all	c
think	c
it	i
will	c
be	c
the	c
less	i
effected	i
to	c
the	c
other	c
students	c
,	c
as	c
the	c
school	c
do	c
not	c
need	c
to	c
re-arrange	c
all	i
the	i
trip	c
just	c
because	c
of	c
our	c
special	c
interesting	i
.	c

It	c
was	c
dangerous	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
know	i
I	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
.	c

If	i
you	i
imagine	i
how	i
dangerous	i
you	i
were	i
while	i
you	i
had	i
to	i
stop	i
your	i
car	i
and	i
got	i
off	i
the	i
car	c
on	c
the	c
highway	c
where	c
there	i
were	i
only	i
car	i
at	i
least	i
120	i
km/hr	i
running	i
along	i
your	i
side	i
.	c

It	c
was	c
true	c
that	c
small	c
dog	c
were	i
in	c
danger	c
,	c
but	c
your	c
life	c
was	i
in	c
that	c
situation	c
as	c
well	c
once	c
you	c
decide	i
to	c
do	c
that	c
brave	c
thing	c
.	c

I	c
feel	i
like	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
hero	c
at	c
that	c
moment	c
,	c
even	c
though	c
I	c
'd	c
never	c
though	i
of	c
it	c
before	c
.	c

We	c
all	c
believe	c
that	c
is	i
a	c
great	c
programme	c
which	i
concludes	i
both	c
education	i
and	c
free	c
time	c
.	c

This	c
show	c
is	c
going	c
to	c
take	c
place	c
in	c
the	c
Central	c
Exhibition	c
Hall	c
of	c
London	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
,	c
March	c
14	c
between	i
the	c
hours	c
10.00-19.00	c
,	c
and	c
we	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
if	c
it	c
is	c
possible	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
that	c
show	c
.	c

The	c
show	c
is	c
absolutly	i
free	c
for	c
students	c
.	c

As	c
a	c
class	c
we	c
suggest	c
to	i
go	i
to	c
this	c
show	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
,	c
March	c
14	c
morning	i
and	i
to	i
visit	i
the	c
Science	c
Museum	c
on	c
Wednesday	c
afternoon	c
during	c
our	c
free	c
time	c
.	c

If	c
that	c
of	i
course	i
is	c
possible	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
year	c
2000	c
media	i
is	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
most	c
powerful	c
things	c
on	c
the	c
planet	c
.	c

They	c
do	c
n't	c
inform	i
people	i
about	i
news	c
,	c
education	c
or	c
documentaries	c
.	c

I	c
believe	c
all	c
the	i
people	c
famous	i
or	c
not	c
,	c
deserve	c
to	c
have	c
private	i
life	c
without	c
journalists	c
to	i
following	c
them	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
.	c

They	c
are	c
humans	c
like	c
all	c
of	c
us	c
with	i
their	c
problems	c
,	c
their	c
good	c
and	c
bad	c
times	c
and	i
of	c
course	c
they	c
do	c
n't	c
want	c
to	i
be	i
publish	i
them	c
in	c
front	c
of	c
millions	c
of	c
people	c
because	c
a	c
journalist	c
thought	c
that	c
this	c
is	i
right	c
.	c

And	c
good	c
for	c
his	c
pocket	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
the	c
only	c
way	c
of	c
change	i
that	c
is	c
,	i
the	i
people	i
,	i
If	i
the	c
people	c
shows	i
no	c
interest	c
the	i
journalist	c
would	c
have	c
no	c
goal	i
of	i
publish	i
any	c
gossips	i
because	c
is	i
not	i
going	i
to	i
be	i
watch	i
or	c
read	c
by	c
anyone	c
.	c

So	c
the	c
power	c
is	c
to	i
the	c
people	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr.	c
Robertson	c
.	i

I	c
and	c
all	c
of	c
my	c
college	i
have	c
read	c
your	c
programme	c
,	c
which	c
you	c
organised	c
for	c
us	c
,	c
for	c
our	c
three	i
days	i
trip	c
to	c
London	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
's	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
because	i
,	i
we	c
will	c
have	c
a	c
chance	c
to	c
se	i
the	c
latest	c
fashion	c
,	c
leisure	c
and	c
sport	i
wear	c
,	c
and	c
as	i
well	i
the	i
way	i
to	i
do	i
the	i
perfect	i
make	i
up	i
and	i
hairstyl	i
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
we	c
can	c
have	c
a	c
great	c
time	c
there	c
,	c
and	c
entrence	i
is	c
free	c
of	c
charge	c
for	c
students	c
,	c
what	i
is	c
very	c
important	c
as	c
well	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
wondering	c
if	c
there	c
is	c
any	c
possibility	c
to	c
go	c
on	i
that	c
show	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
afternoon	c
,	c
and	c
move	c
our	c
shopping	c
to	c
next	i
day	c
.	c

Your	i
faithfully	i

'	c
My	c
perfect	c
holiday	c
'	c

We	c
thought	c
with	i
that	c
beutiful	i
weather	c
the	c
seeside	i
is	i
just	c
perfect	c
for	c
relax	i
,	c
sunbathing	c
and	c
joy	i
.	c

However	c
the	i
truth	c
was	c
a	c
little	c
bit	c
diffrent	i
.	c

Despide	i
of	i
that	c
we	c
were	c
still	c
thinking	c
optimisticly	i
.	c

Then	c
again	i
in	c
a	c
few	c
minutes	c
the	c
weather	c
changed	c
and	c
strong	i
storm	c
begun	i
.	c

I	c
did	c
n't	c
think	c
just	i
went	c
to	i
save	c
my	c
friend	c
.	c

That	c
was	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
our	c
holiday	c
,	c
and	c
next	c
year	c
for	i
sure	i
we	i
wo	c
n't	c
be	c
going	c
to	c
the	c
see	i
side	i
.	c

What	c
is	c
more	c
,	c
there	c
were	c
no	c
discounts	c
available	c
for	i
the	c
ticket	c
fees	i
nor	c
we	i
had	i
the	c
opportunity	c
to	c
visit	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
,	c
as	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
for	c
mourning	c
reasons	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
not	c
satisfied	c
with	c
the	c
service	c
we	c
received	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
therefore	c
writing	c
for	i
a	c
full	c
refund	c
and	c
I	c
expect	c
to	c
receive	c
by	i
post	i
a	i
cheque	i
for	c
£	c
20	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

We	c
'll	c
get	c
out	i
in	c
the	c
morning	c
and	c
find	c
out	i
that	c
our	c
neighbour	c
wears	c
our	i
same	c
jacket	c
and	c
he	c
's	c
boasting	c
about	c
a	c
pair	c
of	c
shoes	c
which	c
are	c
too	c
similar	c
to	c
ours	c
.	c

The	c
thing	c
is	c
we	c
are	c
too	c
fashion	c
conscious	c
,	c
too	c
fussy	c
about	c
our	c
appearance	c
and	c
we	c
'll	c
end	c
up	c
forking	i
out	i
for	i
smart	c
clothes	c
only	c
because	c
the	c
people	c
next	c
door	c
are	c
doing	c
so	c
!	c
!	c

The	c
reason	c
why	c
we	c
'll	c
do	c
this	c
is	c
that	c
we	c
need	c
to	c
be	c
accepted	c
by	c
the	c
elite	c
group	c
that	c
decide	c
who	c
you	c
must	c
be	c
and	c
how	c
you	c
must	c
behave	c
.	c

As	c
for	c
me	c
the	c
only	c
thing	c
I	c
care	c
for	i
in	c
the	c
morning	c
is	c
that	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
my	i
socks	i
mismatched	i
!	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	i
am	i
being	i
the	i
representative	i
of	i
my	i
class	i
to	c
thanks	i
for	i
organising	c
a	c
good	c
programme	c
in	c
London	c
,	c
especially	c
the	c
visiting	i
of	i
Science	i
Museum	c
and	c
National	c
Art	c
Gallery	c
.	c

So	c
we	c
decide	i
to	c
choose	c
the	i
other	i
programme	i
which	i
have	i
seen	i
as	i
an	i
entertainment	i
.	c

It	c
is	c
the	c
LONDON	c
FASHION	c
AND	c
LEISURE	c
SHOW	c
.	c

The	c
date	c
is	c
on	i
Tuesday	c
March	c
14	c
,	c
from	c
10.00-19.00	c
.	c

It	c
shows	c
the	c
latest	c
fashions	c
including	i
leisure	c
and	c
sports	c
wear	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
worth	c
visiting	c
.	c

We	c
can	c
join	i
the	c
programme	c
that	c
you	c
planned	c
as	c
usual	c
and	c
we	i
go	c
to	c
that	c
fashion	c
show	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
the	c
above	c
information	c
is	c
my	c
opinion	c
and	c
I	c
hope	c
you	c
can	c
accept	c
it	c
.	c

Remain	i
the	c
same	c
,	c
as	i
usual	i
or	c
have	c
a	c
great	c
difference	i
?	c

For	c
me	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
people	c
's	c
home	i
may	c
not	c
be	c
built	c
on	c
the	c
ground	c
.	c

The	c
home	i
will	c
be	c
built	c
on	i
the	c
sky	c
-	c
so	c
as	c
to	c
save	c
more	c
land	c
to	c
build	c
the	c
other	c
buildings	c
.	c

And	c
,	i
there	c
should	c
be	c
a	i
electrical	i
servant	c
in	c
everyone	c
's	c
home	c
.	c

There	c
should	i
be	c
no	c
beds	c
at	c
home	c
because	c
some	c
pills	c
are	i
invented	c
to	c
make	i
people	i
not	i
sleepy	c
.	c

As	c
the	c
computer	c
is	c
being	i
as	i
a	c
multi-functional	c
products	i
.	c

on	i
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
there	c
're	c
some	c
ways	i
that	c
remain	c
the	c
same	c
.	c

These	c
are	c
my	c
imagination	i
.	c

I	c
came	c
to	c
London	c
for	c
a	c
short	c
journey	i
to	c
meet	c
new	c
poeple	i
and	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
meeting	i
with	i
an	i
English	c
culture	c
.	c

I	i
've	i
seen	c
your	c
advertisment	i
which	c
had	i
recommended	i
the	c
play	c
'	c
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
'	c
and	c
I	c
enjoyed	i
it	c
very	c
much	c
.	c

I	c
decided	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
with	c
hope	i
that	c
your	c
show	c
will	i
provide	c
me	c
all	i
these	c
emotions	c
that	c
I	c
have	i
been	c
looking	c
for	c
in	c
Great	c
Britain	c
.	c

There	c
was	c
a	c
change	c
of	i
the	c
leader-actor	i
what	i
annoyed	c
me	c
indeed	i
.	c

Further	i
more	i
the	i
show	c
was	c
to	c
begin	c
at	c
about	c
19.30	c
but	c
it	c
didi	i
n't	i
.	c

On	i
the	c
advertisment	i
was	i
written	i
'	i
DISCOUNTS	i
AVAILABLE	i
'	i
shall	c
I	c
ask	c
you	c
one	c
question	c
?	c
-	c
Why	c
they	i
were	i
n't	i
available	c
?	c

I	c
didi	i
n't	i
expect	c
more	c
surprises	c
at	c
your	c
Theatre	c
.	c

Nevertheless	c
after	i
the	c
show	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
hungry	c
so	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
restarrant	i
and	c
what	c
I	i
've	i
seen	i
?	c

A	c
poster	c
:	c
"	c
Closed	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
illness	c
of	c
the	c
chef.	c
"	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
recieve	i
back	c
my	c
money	c
.	c

How	c
has	c
modern	c
technology	c
changed	c
your	c
daily	c
life	c
?	c

The	c
entrance	c
in	i
to	c
the	c
new	c
millennium	c
brought	c
us	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
changes	c
.	c

Many	c
things	c
have	c
been	c
replaced	c
by	c
the	i
others	c
which	c
are	c
more	c
helpful	c
and	c
useful	c
.	c

The	c
most	c
important	c
thing	c
for	c
me	c
is	c
using	c
a	c
computer	c
.	c

Searching	c
in	c
the	c
computer	c
's	c
memory	c
takes	c
about	c
1	c
minute	c
so	c
it	c
is	c
very	c
fast	c
.	c

Playing	c
the	c
games	c
takes	c
me	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
time	c
and	c
it	c
became	i
a	c
bad	c
habit	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
no	c
time	c
for	c
learning	c
and	c
for	c
domestic	c
works	i
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
playing	i
games	c
and	c
using	c
a	c
computer	c
wide	i
my	c
brain	c
so	c
as	i
you	c
can	c
see	c
this	i
modern	c
staft	i
has	c
got	c
many	c
advantages	c
and	c
disadvantages	c
.	c

The	c
next	c
thing	c
that	c
has	c
changed	c
my	c
life	c
is	c
a	c
mobile	c
telephone	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
very	c
useful	c
either	i
.	c

I	c
have	c
no	c
problems	c
with	c
changing	c
the	c
time	c
of	c
meeting	i
because	c
I	c
can	c
always	c
phone	c
.	c

But	c
actually	c
it	c
is	c
boring	c
when	c
you	c
're	c
almost	c
always	c
under	c
observation	c
.	c

The	c
modern	c
technologies	c
brought	i
to	c
my	c
life	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
changes	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
even	c
seen	c
in	c
the	i
domestic	c
works	i
.	c

For	c
example	c
I	i
've	c
got	c
at	c
home	c
a	c
very	c
modern	c
and	c
special	c
machine	c
which	c
irons	c
hardly	i
itself	c
.	c

These	c
are	c
the	c
main	c
reasons	c
why	c
I	c
admit	c
that	c
technology	c
has	c
changed	c
my	c
life	c
and	c
other	c
people	c
's	c
life	c
.	c

I	c
saw	c
the	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
International	c
Arts	c
Festival	c
wich	i
is	c
a	c
great	c
idea	c
.	c

I	c
noticed	c
that	c
some	c
concert	c
halls	c
were	c
too	c
small	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
the	c
idea	c
of	c
a	c
reasonably-priced	c
weekend	c
ticket	c
for	c
all	c
events	c
is	c
excellent	c
because	c
we	c
pay	c
only	c
once	c
and	c
we	c
can	c
see	c
all	c
the	c
events	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
which	c
I	c
've	c
just	c
received	c
.	c

You	c
ask	c
me	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
about	c
school	c
rules	c
and	c
what	c
we	c
are	c
allowed	c
to	c
do	c
at	c
home	c
in	c
France	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
think	c
the	c
rules	c
are	c
so	c
different	c
between	c
England	c
and	c
France	c
but	c
I	c
'm	c
going	c
to	c
try	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
examples	c
.	c

And	c
if	c
we	c
are	c
interested	c
,	c
we	c
can	c
spend	c
six	c
months	c
abroad	c
but	c
we	c
must	c
pass	c
the	c
FCE	c
.	c

At	c
home	c
,	c
we	c
must	c
wash	c
our	c
hands	c
before	c
the	i
lunch	c
.	c

l	i
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

You	c
said	c
that	c
stars	c
and	c
artists	c
would	c
come	c
from	c
around	c
the	c
world	c
but	c
there	c
was	i
only	c
starts	i
from	c
six	c
major	c
countries	c
.	c

It	i
was	c
very	i
good	c
idea	c
.	c

This	c
will	c
make	c
the	c
festival	c
better	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
we	c
will	c
meet	c
next	c
year	c
in	i
the	c
festival	c
.	c

Dear	c
Emily	c
,	c

I	c
'm	c
fine	c
thanks	c
and	c
my	c
parents	c
are	c
also	c
good	i
.	c

I	i
'	i
hope	c
they	c
are	c
both	c
well	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
a	c
suprise	i
for	c
you	c
.	c

I	c
will	i
go	i
to	c
this	i
summer	c
.	c

These	c
are	c
the	c
rules	c
in	c
school	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
not	c
allowed	c
to	c
listen	c
high	i
volume	i
music	c
at	c
home	c
.	c

Other	c
things	c
are	c
allowed	c
to	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
waiting	c
for	c
your	c
next	c
letter	c
.	c

Your	c
friend	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
,	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
the	c
worst	c
performance	c
I	c
had	c
ever	c
seen	c
and	c
it	c
disappointed	c
me	c
very	c
much	c
.	c

Although	c
your	c
advertisement	c
stated	c
that	c
the	c
main	c
actor	c
would	c
be	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
him	c
and	c
a	c
different	c
man	c
was	i
not	c
prepared	c
for	c
the	c
role	c
.	c

It	i
was	c
not	c
true	c
because	c
the	c
audience	c
had	c
to	c
wait	c
until	c
20:15	c
.	c

"	c
Oh	c
,	c
that	c
girl	c
will	c
cause	c
some	c
problems	c
"	c
-	c
he	c
thought	c
when	c
Miss	c
Colston	c
entered	c
the	c
classroom	c
.	c

She	c
approached	c
the	c
desk	c
and	c
wanted	c
to	c
open	c
it	c
,	c
but	c
suddenly	c
Pat	c
shouted	c
-	c
"	c
Miss	c
Colston	c
,	c
please	c
,	c
do	c
n't	c
do	c
that	c
.	c

There	c
's	c
a	c
frog	c
"	c
.	c

The	c
teacher	c
stared	c
at	c
the	c
whole	c
class	c
and	c
calmly	c
whispered	c
-	c
"	c
Who	c
did	c
it	c
?	c
"	c

"	c
Oh	c
,	c
God	c
"	c
-	c
thought	c
Paul	c
-	c
"	c
the	c
next	c
time	c
I	c
will	c
throw	c
a	c
frog	c
inside	i
Pat	c
's	c
rucksack.	c
"	c

This	c
was	c
the	c
first	c
competition	c
which	c
I	c
took	c
part	c
and	i
I	c
have	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
on	c
19th	i
of	c
July	c
and	c
come	c
back	c
on	c
2nd	i
of	c
August	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
work	c
until	c
19th	c
of	c
July	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
been	i
at	i
log	c
cabins	c
before	c
and	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
enjoy	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
like	c
painting	c
and	c
climbing	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
actually	c
not	c
so	c
good	c
at	c
climbing	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
like	c
the	c
fear	c
of	c
risks	c
and	c
dangers	i
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
if	c
I	c
should	c
take	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
clothes	c
with	c
me	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
do	c
not	c
know	c
what	i
's	i
the	i
weather	i
like	c
there	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
,	i
I	c
have	c
answered	c
all	c
questions	i
.	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjeyable	i
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
you	i
need	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
time	c
,	c
because	c
the	c
market	i
is	c
so	c
big	c
.	c

You	c
buy	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
items	c
without	c
thinking	c
where	c
should	i
go	i
so	i
much	i
rubbish	i
.	c

For	i
instance	i
,	i
I	c
think	c
a	c
lot	c
about	c
this	c
issue	c
,	c
and	c
sometimes	c
I	c
do	c
not	c
even	c
want	c
to	c
spend	i
water	c
,	c
although	c
I	c
should	c
do	i
it	i
.	c

I	c
think	c
I	c
am	c
too	c
sensible	c
.	c

I	c
am	i
confusing	i
because	c
of	i
playing	i
different	c
actor	c
in	c
place	c
Danny	i
Brook	c
.	c

Secendly	i
,	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
at	c
20.15	c
.	c

This	c
is	c
why	c
I	c
was	c
feeling	i
invited	i
to	c
your	c
restaurant	c
after	c
show	i
.	c

Neither	i
without	i
any	c
reason	c
it	i
was	i
not	c
available	c
.	c

Your	i
faithfull	i
,	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

This	c
was	c
the	c
reason	c
whe	i
we	c
were	c
horrible	i
troubles	i
with	c
police	i
.	c

Let	c
's	c
back	i
to	c
the	c
beginig	i
of	c
this	c
story	c
.	c

We	c
called	c
this	c
place	c
like	i
this	c
,	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
land	i
in	c
the	c
middle	c
of	c
our	c
lake	c
.	c

There	c
was	c
a	c
secret	c
place	c
when	i
robber	i
keept	i
stolen	i
gold	i
from	c
bank	i
.	c

We	c
found	c
the	c
solution	c
of	i
this	c
deceperous	i
situation	c
-	c
to	c
say	c
nothing	c
to	c
anybody	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
,	c

Our	c
class	c
really	c
appreciate	c
for	i
preparing	c
this	c
programme	c
,	c
especially	c
for	i
Monday	c
's	c
atraction	i
.	c

We	c
are	c
extremaly	i
interested	c
in	c
wisiting	i
London	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
it	c
recommends	i
also	c
'	i
Leisure	c
and	c
Sports	c
Wear	c
'	c
.	c

We	c
strongly	c
recommend	c
it	c
,	c
because	c
students	c
'	c
admission	c
is	c
free	c
.	c

To	c
begin	c
with	c
,	c
we	c
enjoy	c
reading	c
gossips	i
about	c
famous	c
stars	c
and	c
politicians	c
,	c
although	c
they	c
sometimes	c
are	c
n't	c
truly	i
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
their	c
life	c
has	c
no	c
privaty	i
.	c

In	c
spite	c
of	c
being	c
incredibly	c
famous	c
,	c
they	c
might	c
feel	c
very	c
anxiously	i
and	c
lonely	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
it	c
.	c

There	c
is	c
only	c
one	c
thing	c
that	c
we	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
change	c
,	c
if	c
you	c
would	c
n't	c
mind	c
.	c

We	c
've	c
read	c
an	c
advertisement	c
about	c
London	i
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
which	c
will	c
take	c
place	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
,	c
March	c
14	c
from	c
10	i
oo	i
to	c
19	i
oo	i
.	c

So	c
we	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
a	c
disco	c
and	c
this	c
fashion	c
show	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
for	c
us	c
to	c
learn	c
something	c
about	c
styling	c
.	c

We	c
suggest	c
to	i
visit	i
the	c
Science	c
Museum	c
on	c
Monday	c
after	c
the	c
sightseeing	c
tour	c
by	c
bus	c
.	c

We	c
think	c
we	c
'll	c
find	i
one	c
free	c
hour	c
befor	i
the	c
River	c
trip	c
.	c

We	c
hope	c
you	c
are	i
agree	c
with	c
us	c
.	c

They	c
are	c
always	c
expected	c
to	c
be	c
beautiful	c
,	c
intelligent	c
,	c
good-looking	c
.	c

That	c
's	c
why	c
it	c
's	c
very	c
important	c
for	c
these	c
people	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
private	c
life	c
without	c
journalists	c
where	c
they	c
can	c
relax	c
and	c
where	c
they	c
do	c
n't	c
need	c
to	c
be	c
superstars	c
.	c

To	c
have	c
a	c
private	c
life	c
is	c
the	c
natural	c
desire	c
of	c
everyone	c
and	c
the	c
famous	c
film	c
stars	c
or	i
politicians	c
have	c
a	c
right	c
for	i
it	i
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
it	c
must	c
be	c
awful	c
to	c
know	c
that	c
you	c
are	c
observed	c
by	c
journalists	c
or	c
other	c
people	c
,	c
your	c
fans	c
for	c
example	c
all	i
24	c
hours	c
in	i
a	c
day	c
,	c
and	c
the	i
all	i
things	c
you	c
do	c
in	c
your	c
life	c
are	c
published	c
and	c
the	c
whole	c
world	c
knows	c
who	c
is	i
your	i
friend	i
,	c
where	c
you	c
go	c
shopping	c
,	c
who	c
you	c
love	c
in	i
and	c
who	c
you	c
sleep	c
with	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
we	c
should	c
have	c
a	c
little	c
bit	c
respect	i
for	c
the	i
famous	c
people	c
and	c
let	i
them	c
some	c
time	c

Mrs	c
Ryan	c

I	c
start	c
my	c
first	c
job	c
on	c
August	c
1st	c
,	c
that	c
's	c
why	c
I	c
must	c
travel	c
on	i
July	c
.	c

I	c
ca	c
n't	c
change	c
anymore	i
the	c
date	c
of	i
umployment	i
because	c
I	c
signed	c
the	c
contract	c
a	c
month	c
ago	c
:	i
I	c
hope	c
it	i
will	c
not	c
make	i
problems	i
to	i
you	i
.	c

When	c
I	c
saw	c
you	i
propose	i
this	c
sport	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
really	c
excited	c
.	c

I	c
've	c
done	i
sailing	c
for	c
more	c
than	c
ten	c
years	c
and	c
I	c
really	c
enjoy	c
it	c
.	c

Does	c
Camp	c
California	c
provide	c
all	c
clothes	i
for	c
sailing	c
?	c

Do	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
bring	c
money	i
from	c

first	i
,	c
lessons	c
are	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
part	c
of	c
what	c
school	c
wants	c
to	c
provide	c
us	c
.	i

But	c
there	c
are	c
also	c
a	c
lots	i
of	c
clubs	c
and	c
activities	c
that	c
take	i
part	i
in	i
the	c
daily	c
life	c
of	c
pupils	c
.	c

The	c
most	c
interesting	c
lessons	c
for	c
pupils	c
are	c
lessons	c
in	c
which	c
we	i
can	c
do	c
something	c
real	c
,	c
concrete	c
.	c

And	c
especially	c
the	c
practical	c
work	c
.	c

For	i
other	c
activities	c
,	c
we	c
could	c
probably	c
show	c
a	i
training	i
one	i
of	i
our	i
sport	i
team	i

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
with	c
reference	c
to	c
the	c
trip	c
to	c
London	c
on	c
the	c
13th	c
,	c
14th	c
and	c
15th	c
March	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
the	c
good	i
programme	c
you	c
have	c
organised	c
for	c
my	c
class	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
seen	c
an	c
advertisement	c
in	c
the	c
times	i
about	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
.	c

It	c
will	c
be	c
great	i
opportunity	c
for	c
all	c
of	c
us	c
because	c
they	c
will	c
show	i
the	c
latest	c
fashion	c
,	c
the	i
leisure	c
and	c
sports	c
wear	c
,	c
the	i
make	i
up	i
and	c
the	i
different	c
hairstyles	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
will	c
take	c
my	c
proposal	c
in	i
favoreable	i
consideration	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

What	c
was	c
so	c
dangerous	c
and	c
why	i
I	i
had	i
to	i
do	i
it	i
?	c

Now	c
I	c
will	c
tell	c
you	c
in	c
brief	c
what	i
exactly	i
happened	c
to	c
me	c
.	c

There	c
were	c
just	c
four	c
of	c
us	c
.	c

We	c
all	c
decided	c
to	i
go	i
to	c
have	c
a	c
day	c
by	c
the	c
seaside	c
not	c
far	c
away	c
from	c
Portsmouth	c
.	c

When	c
we	c
got	c
there	c
we	c
were	c
wearing	c
our	c
costumes	c
.	c

We	c
lied	i
on	c
the	c
sand	c
under	c
the	c
sun	c
,	c
we	c
had	c
funny	c
beach	c
volley	i
matches	c
,	c
interesting	c
chats	c
,	c
but	c
after	c
two	c
hours	c
there	c
,	c
my	c
friends	c
decided	c
to	c
go	c
swimming	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
end	c
fortunately	c
everything	c
went	c
well	c
as	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
sink	c
in	c
the	c
sea	c
.	c

To	c
the	c
manager	c
of	c
The	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
!	c

I	c
have	c
been	i
recently	i
in	i
London	c
and	c
I	i
've	i
seen	i
the	c
art	i
"	c
Over	c
The	i
Rainbow	c
"	c
at	c
The	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
.	c

But	c
the	c
worst	c
thing	c
in	i
"	c
London	c
's	c
newest	c
and	c
best	c
musical	c
show	c
"	c
,	c
as	c
you	c
called	c
it	c
,	c
was	c
the	c
abscentness	i
of	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
.	c

He	c
had	i
been	i
mistakeing	i
all	c
the	c
time	c
.	c

I	c
told	c
him	c
my	c
worst	c
love	c
story	c
.	c

I	c
looked	c
up	c
and	c
I	c
saw	c
her	c
,	c
standing	c
next	c
to	c
me	c
with	c
her	c
friend	c
.	c

That	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
be	c
a	c
joke	c
from	c
my	c
"	c
coleagues	i
"	c
!	c

The	c
worst	c
thing	c
in	c
this	c
story	c
is	c
,	i
that	c
Pat	c
told	c
this	c
to	c
everyone	c
at	c
school	c
.	c

From	c
that	c
moment	c
I	c
live	i
alone	c
.	c

Each	c
one	c
was	c
fantastic	c
and	i
fill	i
in	i
with	i
euration	i
,	c
but	c
I	c
'd	c
appreciate	c
more	c
place	i
,	c
because	c
unfortunately	c
some	c
concert	c
halls	c
were	c
too	c
small	c
!	c

It	c
could	c
be	c
an	c
advantage	i
!	c

An	i
other	i
excellent	c
thing	c
was	c
your	c
choice	c
for	c
the	c
entry	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
sure	c
you	c
'll	c
pay	c
attention	c
to	c
my	c
suggestions	c
and	c
advice	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
seeing	c
you	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

So	c
,	c
her	i
father	c
prepared	c
the	c
car	c
and	c
her	i
mother	c
took	c
some	c
food	c
for	c
the	c
journey	c
.	c

Suddenly	c
,	c
the	c
father	c
stopped	c
and	c
said	c
:	c
"	c
Here	c
we	c
are	c
!	c
"	c

They	c
were	c
near	c
a	c
little	c
house	c
,	i
built	c
in	i
wood	c
and	c
began	c
walking	c
.	c

They	c
ate	c
with	c
the	c
owner	c
of	c
the	c
little	c
house	c
,	c
whose	c
name	c
was	c
John	c
.	c

He	c
was	c
able	c
to	c
make	c
different	c
objects	c
in	i
wood	c
.	c

Mark	c
was	c
such	i
happy	c
but	c
very	c
exhausted	c
to	c
recognize	i
this	c
story	i
nevertheless	i
this	c
story	c
happened	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
ago	c
.	c

Dear	c
Ms	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

Firstly	c
I	i
can	c
travel	c
only	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
I	c
'm	c
studying	c
at	c
college	c
until	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
June	c
and	c
in	c
August	c
I	c
'm	c
travelling	c
Greece	i
for	c
one	c
months	i
.	c

Secondly	c
I	i
would	c
like	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
log	c
cabins	c
because	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
more	c
spacious	c
and	c
comfortable	c
than	c
tents	c
.	c

I	c
'll	c
tell	c
you	c
two	i
activities	c
I	c
chose	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
play	c
tennis	c
and	c
swim	c
.	c

I	i
'm	i
belonging	i
to	c
a	c
tennis	c
club	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
the	i
most	i
favourite	c
sports	i
.	c

I	c
sometimes	c
have	c
a	c
match	c
with	c
friends	c
.	c

I	c
go	c
swimming	c
once	c
a	c
week	c
.	c

Lastly	c
,	c
could	c
I	c
ask	c
you	c
something	c
?	c

How	i
is	c
the	c
weather	c
like	c
in	c
California	c
?	c

Can	c
I	c
change	c
money	c
for	i
US	c
dollars	c
there	c
?	c

The	c
most	c
interesting	c
thing	c
is	c
that	c
many	c
men	c
are	c
waiting	c
for	c
their	c
wives	c
or	c
girlfriends	c
outside	c
the	c
shop	c
during	c
shopping	c
.	c

Shopping	c
is	c
enjoyable	c
when	c
you	c
find	c
exactly	c
what	c
you	c
want	c
in	c
a	c
calm	c
shop	c
but	c
not	c
always	c
.	c

Answering	i
another	c
of	c
your	c
questions	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
more	c
likely	c
to	i
stay	c
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
considering	i
that	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
to	i
weeks	c
in	c
the	c
camp	c
.	c

While	c
I	c
am	c
at	c
the	c
camp	c
I	c
would	c
love	c
sailing	c
and	c
climbing	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
be	c
very	c
glad	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
let	c
me	c
know	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
should	i
I	i
take	c
,	c
and	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
do	i
you	c
think	c
I	c
will	c
need	c
to	c
bring	c
with	c
me	c
.	c

I	i
's	i
been	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
since	c
I	c
last	c
wrote	c
to	c
you	c
.	c

Well	c
,	c
I	c
'm	c
going	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
about	c
that	c
awesome	c
experience	c
.	c

The	c
band	c
played	c
at	c
my	c
school	c
so	c
we	c
could	c
raise	c
money	c
for	c
our	c
graduation	c
trip	c
.	c

"	c
The	c
Moicznos	c
"	c
are	c
so	c
popular	c
that	c
we	c
sold	c
our	i
every	c
ticket	c
and	c
end	i
up	c
wining	i
2000	c
pounds	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
liked	c
reading	c
my	c
story	c
.	c

Hope	c
to	c
hear	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

17/6/2000	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
inform	c
you	c
about	c
my	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
I	i
spent	c
at	c
the	c
play	c
"	c
Over	c
The	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
presented	c
by	c
The	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
.	c

The	c
problems	c
started	c
at	c
the	c
beginning	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
,	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
was	c
starring	c
instead	c
of	c
Danny	c
Brooks	c
and	c
this	c
was	c
the	c
most	c
disappointing	c
thing	c
that	c
evening	c
for	c
me	c
and	c
my	c
friends	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
told	c
to	i
be	i
able	c
to	c
get	c
discounts	c
,	c
however	c
,	c
I	c
could	c
not	c
get	c
any	c
.	c

As	c
a	c
result	c
,	c
I	c
could	c
not	c
have	c
my	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c

SECRETS	c
'	c
DAMAGE	c

She	c
was	c
telling	c
secrets	i
of	c
her	c
friends	c
to	c
the	c
others	c
.	c

One	c
day	c
,	c
she	c
again	c
told	c
the	c
secret	c
formula	c
or	i
a	c
production	i
to	c
a	c
friend	c
of	c
hers	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
this	c
friend	c
told	c
this	c
to	c
some	c
other	c
people	c
and	c
when	c
it	c
was	c
understood	c
that	c
Pam	c
was	c
guilty	c
,	c
she	c
was	c
fired	c
.	c

Life	c
and	i
harder	c
than	c
anytime	i
for	c
Pam	c
then	c
.	c

She	c
had	c
no	c
friends	c
.	c

One	c
day	c
,	c
she	c
moved	c
to	c
a	c
farm	c
and	c
nobody	c
has	c
heard	c
from	c
her	c
since	c
then	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
evening	c
Pat	c
and	c
Kim	c
used	c
to	c
walk	c
along	c
the	c
beach	c
and	c
they	c
used	c
to	c
stop	c
and	c
turn	c
at	c
the	c
Main	c
Rock	c
,	c
a	c
very	c
big	c
rock	c
.	c

But	c
Kim	i
,	i
and	i
no	i
one	i
else	c
found	c
Pat	c

Circle	c
Theatre	c
in	c
London	c

I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
at	c
19.30	c
o'clock	i
but	c
,	c
with	i
my	i
surprise	i
,	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
and	c
so	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
remain	c
here	i
until	c
the	c
end	c
because	c
I	c
left	i
London	c
,	c
with	c
my	c
group	c
before	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
n't	c
have	c
all	c
the	c
things	c
I	c
expected	c
.	c

Pat	c
was	c
very	c
excited	c
about	c
this	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
afternoon	c
she	c
had	c
phoned	c
at	i
a	i
Francis	c
's	c
mother	c
and	c
she	c
explained	i
her	c
the	c
secret	c
,	c
then	c
she	c
phoned	c
at	i
her	c
best	c
friend	c
and	c
she	c
speak	i
about	c
that	c
too	i
;	c
she	c
phoned	c
at	i
many	c
people	c
all	c
the	i
day	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
night	c
Francis	c
was	c
invited	c
to	c
the	c
party	c
,	c
at	c
Pat	c
's	c
home	c
.	c

When	c
he	c
was	c
out	c
he	c
needed	c
to	c
buy	c
some	c
cigarettes	c
so	c
he	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
shop	c
where	c
the	c
owner	c
,	c
a	i
his	c
friend	c
,	c
ask	i
him	c
if	c
he	c
was	c
very	c
happy	c
about	c
his	c
present	c
,	c
the	c
new	c
gold	c
watch	c
,	c
he	c
was	c
very	c
lucky	c
to	c
have	c
best	c
friends	c
like	c
Pat	c
and	c
her	c
friends	c
.	c

The	i
Francis	i
's	i
secret	i
was	i
discovered	i
!	c

Now	c
all	i
the	i
Pat	i
's	i
friend	i
do	i
n't	i
tell	c
her	c
about	c
their	c
secrets	c
because	c
Pat	c
is	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
that	c
has	c
recently	c
taken	c
place	c
at	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
.	c

The	c
performance	c
started	c
fourty	i
five	i
minutes	c
later	i
.	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
not	c
have	i
complained	i
if	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
had	c
been	c
open	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c

Modern	c
technology	c
has	c
variety	i
of	c
uses	c
and	c
its	c
possibilities	c
are	c
being	c
widened	c
more	c
and	c
more	c
.	c

Personally	c
I	c
feel	c
the	c
greatest	c
influence	c
from	i
the	i
side	i
of	i
personal	c
computers	c
.	c

Their	c
popularity	c
could	i
be	c
explained	c
by	c
their	c
comfort	i
and	c
easy	i
use	c
.	c

With	c
the	c
help	c
of	c
"	i
Internet	c
"	c
it	c
is	c
possible	c
to	c
get	c
much	i
objective	c
and	c
useful	c
information	c
you	c
are	c
interested	c
in	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
completely	c
satisfied	c
with	c
the	c
way	c
I	c
spend	c
my	c
freetime	i
,	c
but	c
they	c
have	c
another	c
opinion	c
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
modern	c
technology	c
affects	c
everybody	c
,	c
but	c
in	c
different	c
ways	c
.	c

As	c
I	c
have	c
already	c
planned	c
my	c
holiday	c
for	c
August	c
,	c
I	c
will	c
only	c
be	c
available	c
in	c
July	c
,	c
after	c
my	c
exams	c
.	c

It	c
would	c
be	c
nice	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
tent	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
been	c
camping	c
and	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
try	c
it	c
,	c
at	c
least	c
once	c
.	c

My	c
second	c
choice	c
is	c
climbing	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
climbed	c
and	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
go	c
at	c
it	c
.	c

What	c
you	c
expect	c
when	c
you	c
go	c
shopping	c
,	c
generally	c
with	c
a	c
friend	c
or	c
two	c
,	c
is	c
wandering	i
around	c
and	c
looking	i
at	c
everything	c
.	c

Having	c
money	c
and	c
be	i
able	c
to	c
spend	c
it	c
in	i
anything	c
you	c
want	c
is	c
brilliant	c
therefore	c
you	c
try	c
to	c
turn	c
it	c
in	i
an	c
enjoyable	c
moment	i
.	c

You	c
are	c
hot	c
in	c
the	c
shops	c
,	c
feel	c
annoyed	c
and	c
most	c
of	c
the	c
time	c
cannot	c
find	c
anything	c
you	c
wanted	i
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
that	c
the	c
students	c
of	c
my	c
class	c
have	c
seen	c
an	c
advertisment	i
about	i
The	i
London	c
Fashion	c
And	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
making	c
such	c
a	c
good	c
plan	c
,	i
for	c
us	c
,	c
so	c
we	c
could	i
have	c
a	c
good	c
time	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
to	c
these	i
we	c
will	c
not	c
have	c
to	c
pay	c
anything	c
since	c
it	c
is	c
free	c
for	c
students	c
.	c

I	c
suggest	c
that	c
we	c
should	c
transfer	i
our	c
visit	c
to	c
the	c
Science	c
Museum	c
on	i
Wednesday	c
afternoon	c
in	i
our	i
free	i
time	i
that	i
we	i
have	i
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
dangerous	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
.	c

As	c
I	c
knew	c
the	c
teknics	i
to	c
break	c
in	i
a	c
place	c
without	c
being	c
noticed	c
,	c
I	c
should	c
not	c
be	i
afraid	c
but	c
tonight	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
steal	c
the	c
most	c
precious	c
diamond	c
in	c
the	c
country	c
which	i
was	c
very	c
well	c
secured	i
.	c

However	c
,	c
my	c
adventure	c
was	c
not	c
over	c
yet	c
.	c

There	c
were	c
laisers	i
all	c
over	c
the	c
place	c
,	c
with	i
which	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
be	c
careful	c
with	i
.	c

Suddenly	c
something	c
went	c
wrong	c
,	i
the	i
alarm	c
was	c
making	c
noise	i
.	c

I	c
ran	c
towards	c
the	c
diamond	c
grabed	i
it	c
got	i
out	c
quickly	c
,	c
ran	i
out	c
of	c
the	c
back	c
door	c
.	c

By	c
surprise	i
I	c
saw	c
a	c
car	c
waiting	c
for	c
me	c
outside	c
.	c

We	c
really	c
like	c
the	c
variety	c
of	c
our	c
trip	c
to	c
London	c
.	c

The	c
programme	c
contains	i
enjoyment	c
and	c
education	c
,	c
what	i
is	c
very	i
esencial	i
for	c
young	c
people	c
.	c

In	c
our	c
opinion	c
,	c
we	c
should	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
because	c
we	c
are	c
keen	c
on	c
fashion	c
.	c

Secondaly	i
,	c
because	c
we	c
do	c
not	c
have	c
to	c
pay	c
for	c
the	c
tickets	c
.	c

The	c
show	c
is	c
on	c
tuesday	i
and	c
we	c
could	c
go	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
show	c
in	c
the	c
afternoon	c
,	c
instead	c
of	c
shopping	i
.	c

We	c
think	c
,	i
that	c
we	c
may	i
shopping	i
next	i
day	c
,	c
on	c
wednesday	i
,	c
in	c
our	c
free	c
time	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Students	i

The	c
future	c
is	c
unexpectable	i
and	c
human	c
beings	c
are	c
afriad	i
of	c
dangers	c
,	c
such	c
as	c
tornado	i
or	c
earthquake	i
.	c

Thinking	c
about	c
home	c
like	i
a	c
place	c
to	c
live	c
,	i
is	i
not	i
already	i
worth	i
.	c

We	c
need	c
to	c
make	c
our	c
home	c
a	c
place	c
where	c
we	c
want	c
to	c
come	c
back	c
after	i
the	i
work	c
or	c
school	c
.	c

It	c
has	c
to	c
be	c
pleasure	i
to	c
be	c
there	c
for	c
us	c
.	c

What	c
we	c
really	c
need	c
in	c
the	c
next	c
millenium	i
is	c
love	c
,	c
that	c
is	c
what	c
will	c
keep	c
all	c
family	i
together	c
and	i
forever	c
.	c

Do	c
we	c
care	c
about	c
a	c
new	c
carpet	c
or	c
a	i
fashionable	c
furniture	c
?	c

Live	i
is	c
too	c
short	c
to	c
think	c
about	c
the	i
poscesives	i
.	c

We	c
cannot	i
aware	i
future	c
technologe	i
,	c
but	c
we	c
might	c
still	c
have	c
some	c
feelings	c
to	i
eachothers	i
.	c

I	c
can	c
gladly	c
give	c
you	c
some	c
information	c
which	c
you	c
need	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
interested	c
in	c
sports	c
.	c

Would	c
you	c
mind	c
giving	c
some	c
answer	i
whether	i
I	c
need	c
some	c
clothes	c
and	c
money	c
at	c
the	c
Camp	c
?	c

I	c
'm	c
sorry	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
n't	c
written	c
to	c
you	c
for	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
nice	c
you	c
wanted	c
to	c
hear	c
about	c
my	c
experience	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
know	c
you	c
're	c
looking	c
for	c
a	c
job	c
which	i
I	i
did	i
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
cleaned	c
the	c
stage	c
again	c
.	c

Do	c
you	c
know	c
"	c
Radio	c
Head	c
"	c
?	c

It	c
is	c
my	c
favourite	c
group	c
.	c

Especially	i
,	c
I	c
liked	c
cleaning	c
the	c
stage	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
could	c
stand	c
a	i
famouse	i
singer	c
's	c
stage	c
and	c
I	c
could	c
feel	c
his	c
enthusiasm	c
,	c
even	c
though	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
clean	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
