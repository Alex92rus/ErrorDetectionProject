I	c
saw	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
were	c
written	c
on	c
the	c
advertisement	c
paper	c
and	c
was	c
very	c
excited	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
did	c
not	c
appear	c
on	c
the	c
stage	c
until	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
musical	c
showing	c
time	c
.	c

Despite	c
of	i
the	c
fact	c
that	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
student	c
,	c
I	c
could	c
not	c
get	c
any	c
discounts	c

People	c
will	c
wear	c
this	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c

For	c

T-shirts	c
for	c

are	i

:	c
easy	c
to	c
take	c
it	c
out	c
when	c
you	c
wash	c
it	c
,	c
is	i
very	c
simple	c
and	c
comfortable	c

What	c
about	c
short	c
pants	c
?	c

I	c
WOULD	c
LIKE	c
TO	c
KNOW	c
IF	c
THERE	c
IS	c
ANY	c
CHANCE	c
OF	c
CHANGING	c
THE	c
PROGRAMME	c
BECAUSE	c
WE	c
HAVE	c
FOUND	c
A	c
VERY	c
INTERESTING	c
ACTIVITY	c
TO	c
DO	c
ON	c
TUESDAY	c
14	c
MARCH	c
.	c

IT	c
CONSISTS	i
ON	i
VISITING	c
THE	c
LONDON	c
FASHION	c
AND	c
LEISURE	c
SHOW	c
IN	i
THE	c
CENTRAL	c
EXHIBITION	c
HALL	c
.	c

YOURS	c
FAITHFULLY	c

THIS	c
SITUATION	c
AFFECTS	c
FAMOUS	c
PERSONAL	i
LIVES	i
BECAUSE	c
THEY	c
ARE	c
NOT	c
ALLOWED	c
TO	c
HAVE	c
PRIVACY	i

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
something	c
about	c
the	c
three-day	c
trip	c
to	c
London	c
.	c

Personally	c
,	c
I	c
enjoy	c
looking	c
and	i
learning	c
about	c
new	c
inventions	c
and	c
all	c
the	c
science	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
on	c
14th	c
March	c
,	c
which	c
is	c
the	c
day	c
we	c
will	c
be	c
visiting	c
the	c
science	c
museum	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
in	c
the	c
Central	c
Exhibition	c
Hall	c
and	c
will	c
start	c
and	i
ten	c
o'clock	c
and	c
finish	c
at	c
five	c
o'clock	c
in	c
the	c
evening	c
.	c

Apparently	c
,	c
this	c
show	c
is	c
free	c
to	c
all	c
students	c
,	c
which	c
means	c
if	c
we	c
went	c
,	c
the	c
cost	c
of	c
the	c
trip	c
will	i
be	c
cut	i
down	i
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
based	c
on	c
fashion	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
a	c
suggestion	c
on	c
how	c
the	c
programme	c
could	c
be	c
changed	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

We	c
take	c
our	c
homes	c
for	c
granted	c
.	c

Think	c
about	c
the	c
people	c
in	c
the	c
poor	c
countries	c
!	c

They	c
struggle	c
to	c
survive	c
.	c

There	c
will	c
be	c
lots	c
of	c
differences	c
in	c
our	c
homes	c
of	c
the	c
future	c
from	c
our	c
homes	c
now	c
,	c
but	c
there	c
may	c
also	c
be	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
similarities	c
.	c

Non-breakable	c
glass	c
.	c

The	c
future	c
homes	c
will	c
also	c
have	c
many	c
similarities	c
,	c
such	c
as	c
having	c
a	c
separate	c
bathroom	c
,	c
and	c
not	c
having	c
one	c
in	c
a	c
bedroom	c
,	c
or	c
having	c
two	c
floors	c
or	c
having	c
garages	c
.	c

I	c
extremely	i
liked	c
all	c
concerts	i
,	c
shows	c
,	c
exhibitions	i
,	c
but	c
why	c
there	i
were	i
n't	i
any	c
photograph	i
exhibitions	c
?	c

I	c
think	c
,	i
you	c
should	c
make	i
some	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
know	c
,	c
I	c
'm	c
studying	c
at	c
the	i
private	c
Academy	c
,	c
so	c
the	c
rules	c
in	c
my	c
institute	c
are	c
different	c
from	c
the	c
rules	c
in	c
state	c
institutes	c
.	c

I	c
'll	c
give	c
you	c
an	c
example	c
.	c

So	c
nobody	c
smokes	c
there	c
.	c

I	c
was	i
to	c
Circle	i
Theatre	c
to	c
watch	c
'	i
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
'	c
musical	c
show	c
,	c
recently	c
.	c

The	c
substitute	c
was	c
far	c
worse	c
.	c

I	c
paid	c
for	c
something	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
get	c
so	c
it	c
is	c
obvious	c
that	c
I	c
want	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	i
,	c

He	c
ran	c
out	c
quickly	c
,	c
leaving	c
everyone	c
behind	c
.	c

He	c
felt	c
very	c
ashamed	c
and	c
did	c
n't	c
know	c
what	c
to	c
do	c
.	c

'	c
How	c
could	c
he	c
,	c
'	c
Paul	c
thought	c
'	c
Now	c
the	c
whole	c

The	c
same	c
question	c
for	c
clothes	c
and	c
money	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
has	i
had	i
your	i
questions	i
out	i
of	i
your	i
mind	i
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Last	c
month	c
,	c
I	c
enjoyed	c
to	i
help	i
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
in	c
Portugal	c
.	c

I	c
just	c
did	c
not	c
enjoyed	i
when	i
they	c
were	c
making	i
the	i
instruments	i
work	c
for	c
the	c
big	c
day	c
.	c

The	c
festival	c
was	c
excenent	i
in	c
many	c
ways	c
,	c
and	c
especially	i
it	c
being	c
an	c
international	c
festival	c
was	c
a	c
challenging	c
,	c
but	c
brilliant	c
idea	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
to	c
that	c
,	c
organising	c
one	c
weekend	c
with	c
special	c
price	c
tickets	c
was	c
particularly	c
good	c
.	c

Thus	c
,	c
I	c
recommend	c
that	c
stars	c
and	c
artists	c
of	c
various	c
nationalities	c
should	c
be	c
invited	c
.	c

Also	c
,	c
some	c
of	c
the	c
concert	c
halls	c
where	c
the	c
musicians	c
performed	c
were	c
not	c
big	c
enough	c
for	c
the	c
vast	c
number	c
of	c
audiences	i
.	c

I	c
hope	c
that	c
next	c
year	c
's	c
festival	c
will	c
be	c
much	c
more	c
successful	c
that	i
this	c
year	c
's	c
one	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

But	c
I	c
prefer	c
realistic	c
stories	c
such	c
as	c
Ernest	c
Hemingway	c
's	c
"	c
The	c
Old	c
Man	c
and	c
the	c
Sea	c
'	c
.	c

Here	c
,	c
the	c
fishman	c
is	c
very	c
old	c
,	c
but	c
he	c
is	c
still	c
challenging	c
to	i
everything	c
he	c
faces	c
.	c

Ernest	c
Hemingway	c
's	c
sentences	c
are	c
precise	c
,	c
but	c
still	c
very	c
powerful	c
and	c
alive	c
.	c

After	c
the	c
show	c
I	c
decide	i
to	c
had	i
dinner	c
in	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
because	c
it	c
closed	i
.	c

This	c
was	c
not	c
perfect	i
evening	c
for	c
me	c
,	c
so	c
if	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
give	c
my	i
money	c
back	c
,	c
I	c
will	c
tell	c
to	i
the	c
newspaper	c
about	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hear	i
a	i
good	c
new	i
.	c

I	c
think	c
in	c
the	c
next	c
100	c
years	c
people	c
will	c
wear	c
the	i
space	i
clothes	i
with	c
small	i
engine	c
in	c
the	c
back	c
.	i

The	c
atmosphere	c
in	i
the	c
earth	c
now	i
starting	i
badly	c
every	c
years	i
.	c

The	c
carbon	i
dioxide	c
are	i
growing	c
very	c
fast	c
and	c
people	c
cut	c
more	i
trees	c
,	c
therefore	c
not	i
enough	c
trees	c
to	c
such	i
carbon	c
dioxide	c
and	c
produce	c
oxygen	c
.	c

I	i
think	i
if	i
we	i
wear	i
this	i
clothes	i
we	i
will	i
travel	i
to	i
every	i
where	i
easier	i
than	i
we	i
use	i
cars	i
,	i
ships	i
,	i
planes	i
and	i
space	i
ships	i
.	c

I	c
think	c
I	c
can	c
win	c
this	c
price	i
,	c
because	c
this	i
clothe	i
will	c
produce	i
in	c
the	i
future	i
soon	i

MY	c

JAMES	i
CAMIREZ	c
AND	c
I'AM	i
WRITING	c
THIS	c
LETTER	c
TO	c
YOU	c
BECAUSE	c
I	c
HAVE	c
SOME	c
COMPLEINTS	i
FOR	i
THE	c
DISAPPOINTING	c
EVENING	c
I	c
HAD	c
LAST	c
NIGHT	c
.	c

FIRST	c
OF	c
ALL	c
ON	i
THE	c
ADVERTISEMENT	c
FOR	c
THE	c
SHOW	c
IT	c
SAYS	i
THAT	c
THE	c
ACTOR	c
WAS	c
GOING	c
TO	c
BE	c
DANNY	c
BROOK	c
AND	c
INSTEAD	c
OF	c
HIM	c
WAS	i
A	c
TOTALLY	c
UNKNOWN	c
CLOWN	c
THAT	c
HAD	c
NO	c
IDEA	c
OF	c
HOW	c
TO	c
ACT	c
,	i
IT	c
WAS	c
HORRIBLY	c
DISAPPOINTING	c
!	c

SECOND	c
I	c
GOT	c
TO	c
THE	c
THEATRE	c
AT	c
19.20	c
BECAUSE	c
IN	c
THE	c
ADVERTISEMENT	c
IT	c
CLEARLY	c
APPEARS	i
THAT	c
THE	c
SHOW	c
STARTS	c
AT	c
19.30	c
,	c
AND	c
I	c
GOT	c
HEAVILY	i
MAD	c
WHEN	c
I	c
LOOK	i
MY	i
WATCH	c
AND	c
NOTICE	i
THAT	c
I	c
HAD	c
BEEN	c
WAITING	c
FOR	c
40	c
(	c
FORTY	c
)	c
MINUTES	c
AND	c
THE	c
SHOW	c
DID	i
N'T	i
START	i
YET	c
...	c

I	c
MEAN	c
I	i
WAS	c
AMAIZING	i
!	c

AFTER	c
THE	c
SHOW	c
I	c
GOT	c
OUT	c
THE	i
SHOW	i
ROOM	i
DEEPLY	c
DISAPPOINTED	c
AND	c
WENT	c
TO	c
THE	c
RESTAURANT	c
TO	c
DRINK	c
SOMETHING	c
TO	c
RELAX	c
,	c
AND	c
DO	c
YOU	c
KNOW	c
WHAT	c
?	c
.	c
.	c

NOW	c
WITH	c
MODERN	c
MACHINES	c
I	c
CAN	c
MAKE	c
A	i
BETTER	c
USE	c
OF	c
MY	c
TIME	c
,	i
IF	c
I'AM	i
LATE	c
TO	c
GO	c
TO	c
TRAINING	c
AND	c
I	c
HAD	i
N'T	i
IT	i
YET	c
I	c
JUST	c
TAKE	c
MY	c
FOOD	c
AND	c
PUT	c
IT	c
IN	c
THE	c
MICROWAVEOVEN	i
.	c

BUT	c
I	c
THINK	c
ALSO	c
THAT	c
WITH	c
MODERN	c
TECHNOLOGY	c
WE	c
GET	c
MORE	c
COMFORTABLE	c
SO	c
THAT	c
MAKES	c
ME	c
A	c
PACIVE	i
PERSON	c
AND	c
NOT	c
SO	c
ACTIVE	c
,	i
THIS	c
CAN	c
BE	c
BAD	c
TO	i
BECAUSE	c
IF	c
I	c
GET	c
USED	c
TO	c
BE	i
CONFORTABLE	i
WHEN	i
I	c
NEED	c
TO	c
DO	c
HARD	c
WORKS	i
I	c
WO	c
N'T	c
BE	c
ABLE	c
TO	c
DO	i
THEM	i

I	c
am	c
a	c
full-time	c
student	c
,	c
my	c
summer	c
holidays	c
begin	c
at	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
June	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
planned	c
to	c
work	c
on	c
my	c
grandfather	c
's	c
farm	c
in	c
August	c
.	c

Besides	c
camping	c
,	c
I	c
also	c
like	c
painting	c
.	c

Our	c
lives	c
are	c
getting	c
better	c
and	c
better	c
,	c
so	c
people	c
began	i
to	c
go	c
shopping	c
more	c
frequently	c
.	c

Also	c
supermarket	c
owners	c
have	c
put	i
in	i
a	c
vast	c
amount	c
of	c
money	c
to	c
find	c
out	c
the	c
best	c
way	c
to	c
place	c
goods	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
get	c
the	c
most	c
profit	c
.	c

Shopping	c
does	c
not	c
just	c
effect	i
us	c
mentally	c
,	c
but	c
also	c
physically	c
.	c

Think	c
of	c
the	c
awful	c
crowds	c
,	c
the	c
busy	c
car	c
parks	c
,	c
polluted	c
air	c
in	c
the	c
city	c
centres	c
and	c
mile-long	c
queues	c
in	c
front	c
of	c
the	c
cash	c
desks	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
think	c
anyone	c
would	i
really	i
like	i
to	c
face	c
them	c
.	c

But	c
once	c
you	c
get	c
there	c
,	c
they	c
're	c
just	c
inevitable	c

are	c
n't	c
they	c

The	c

I	c
read	c

The	c

about	i

to	c

in	c

is	c
private	i
life	i

Sometimes	c

everywhere	i

majority	c
of	c
the	c
population	c
wish	c
they	c
were	c
rich	c
and	c
famous	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
"	c
which	i
was	c
performed	c
in	c
your	c
theatre	c
two	c
weeks	c
ago	c
.	c

I	c
went	c
to	c
see	c
it	c
on	c
5th	c
June	c
2000	c
.	c

Then	c
at	c
the	c
tickets-office	i
I	c
was	c
said	i
that	c
no	c
discounts	c
were	c
available	c
so	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
pay	c
the	c
full	c
prize	i
despite	c
I	i
am	c
a	c
student	c
.	c

Finally	c
I	c
would	c
have	c
had	c
dinner	c
at	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
if	c
it	c
had	c
not	c
been	i
already	i
closed	c
because	c
the	c
show	c
finished	c
,	c
obviously	c
,	c
late	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secret	i
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
it	c
will	c
introduce	c
latest	i
fashions	c
connecting	i
Millenium	i
.	c

We	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
if	c
it	c
is	c
possible	c
to	c
change	c
your	c
programme	c
.	c

We	c
would	c
be	c
grateful	c
if	c
we	c
could	c
go	c
there	c
in	c
the	c
afternoon	c
on	c
14	c
March	c
because	c
we	c
are	c
able	c
to	c
go	c
shopping	c
.	c

We	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
was	c
twenty	c
years	c
old	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
go	c
to	i
Army	i
.	c

So	c
,	c
another	c
policeman	c
and	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
arrive	c
at	c
the	c
accident	c
place	c
quickly	c
.	c

Then	c
,	c
he	c
tried	c
to	c
go	c
over	c
the	c
wall	c
,	c
I	c
held	c
his	c
leg	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
said	i
to	i
my	c
mother	c
,	c
she	c
asked	c
me	c
not	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
again	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
I	c
'm	c
very	c
glad	c
to	c
have	c
been	c
choosen	i
and	c
I	c
will	c
do	c
my	c
best	c
for	c
this	c
competition	c
.	c

I	c
examined	c
all	c
the	c
activities	c
that	c
you	c
listed	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
disappointed	c
to	c
have	c
to	c
chose	i
just	c
two	c
of	c
them	c
because	c
in	c
my	c
opinion	c
I	c
'm	c
good	c
in	i
almost	c
of	i
this	i
activities	c
.	c

Finally	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
are	i
we	i
supposed	c
to	c
wear	c
there	c
,	c
and	c
about	c
the	c
money	c
we	c
are	c
supposed	c
to	i
pay	c
for	c
food	c
and	c
things	c
like	c
that	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
receiving	c
your	c
prompt	c
replay	i
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
'm	c
going	c
to	c
tell	c
the	c
good	c
news	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
unbelivebly	i
!	c
!	c
!	c

I	c
have	i
contributed	i
to	c
the	c
concert	c
selling	i
some	c
tickets	c
to	c
my	c
friends	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
depressing	c
...	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
some	c
news	c
about	c
you	c
,	i
What	c
have	c
you	c
done	c
?	c

Be	i
you	c
studing	i
a	c
lot	c
?	c

Love	c
from	c

Clara	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
just	c
received	c
your	c
letter	c
which	c
is	i
made	c
me	c
so	c
hapy	i
.	c

I	c
can	i
not	i
belive	i
that	c
I	c
won	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
always	i
belived	i
I	c
am	c
an	c
unluky	i
man	c
and	c
now	c
I	c
think	c
somethings	i
are	c
changing	c
in	c
my	c
life	c
.	c

I	c
will	i
definitly	i
chose	i
Basketball	i
and	c
Swimming	i
wich	i
are	c
the	i
my	c
dream	c
sport	i
.	c

They	c
are	c
just	c
like	c
alcholics	i
and	c
this	i
people	c
are	i
every	i
day	i
doing	i
shopping	i
because	c
they	c
can	i
not	i
stop	c
themself	i
unless	c
they	c
have	c
not	c
got	c
money	c
for	i
spend	i
.	c

Because	c
nowdays	i
whereever	i
you	c
go	c
there	c
is	c
big	i
queue	c
and	c
I	c
hate	c
being	i
waited	i
.	c

The	c
queue	i
is	i
not	c
only	i
the	i
problem	i
if	i
you	c
go	c
by	c
car	c
there	c
is	c
parking	i
problem	i
,	c
if	c
you	c
go	c
by	c
bus	c
there	c
is	i
again	i
queue	i
and	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
carry	c
many	i
carry	i
bag	i
carrier	i
bags	i
during	c
the	i
your	c
journey	c
and	c
you	c
wo	c
n't	c
be	i
alway	i
luky	i
to	i
find	c
a	c
seat	c
to	i
seat	i
.	c

If	c
you	c
go	c
shopping	c
for	c
(	i
buy	i
)	i
clothes	c
that	c
is	c
the	c
worse	i
kind	c
of	c
shopping	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
with	c
reference	c
to	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
I	c
saw	c
last	c
week	c
in	c
your	c
theatre	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
when	c
I	c
had	i
bought	i
the	c
ticets	i
it	c
appeared	c
that	c
there	c
is	i
no	c
discount	c
available	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
must	c
complain	c
that	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
started	c
almost	c
an	c
hour	c
later	i
and	c
in	c
addition	c
to	c
this	c
anyone	i
did	i
n't	i
excuse	i
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

I	c
thought	c
that	c
if	c
I	c
said	c
something	c
specific	c
about	c
her	c
he	c
would	c
look	c
at	c
her	c
in	c
a	c
different	c
way	c
.	c

Mr.	i
Manager	c
:	i

I	c
could	c
n't	c
go	c
out	c
of	c
the	c
house	c
for	c
a	c
month	c
so	c
now	c
I	c
know	c
how	c
Pat	c
is	c
and	c
ca	i
n't	c
keep	c
any	c
secrets	c
.	c

Anyway	c
we	c
had	c
a	c
very	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
.	c

Last	c
but	c
not	c
least	c
,	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
was	c
replaced	c
by	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
,	c
whose	c
name	c
I	c
probably	c
forgot	c
because	c
of	c
his	c
poor	c
performance	c
.	c

The	c
following	c
story	c
will	c
prove	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
left	c
the	c
office	c
at	c
six	c
o'clock	c
.	c

The	c
kids	c
were	c
by	i
their	c
grandmother	c
,	c
who	c
take	i
care	c
of	c
them	c
.	c

I	c
drove	c
to	c
Ouchy	c
where	c
I	c
took	i
a	c
drink	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
so	c
hot	c
,	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
go	c
for	c
a	c
swim	c
in	c
tutry	c
,	c
although	c
I	c
had	c
n't	c
any	i
swimming-clothes	i
.	c

I	c
took	c
my	c
clothes	c
of	i
and	c
swam	c
twenty	i
minutes	c
in	c
the	c
lake	c
.	c

They	c
drove	c
me	c
to	c
their	c
office	c
after	c
having	c
given	c
me	c
use	i
of	i
their	i
shirt	c
.	c

Of	c
course	c
she	c
told	c
everything	c
to	c
my	c
husband	c
.	c

In	i
the	i
name	i
of	i
the	c
class	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
the	c
excellent	c
programme	c
you	c
have	c
organised	c
,	c
especially	c
the	c
idea	c
of	c
visiting	c
a	c
galery	i
.	c

However	c
,	c
we	c
have	c
seen	c
an	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
It	i
would	i
be	i
on	c
the	c
13th	c
of	c
March	c
from	c
10.00	c
to	c
19.00	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
also	c
unusual	c
to	c
have	c
such	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
in	c
our	c
country	c
.	c

I'am	i
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
dangerous	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
knew	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
lived	c
in	c
a	c
small	c
village	c
on	c
the	c
ocean	c
.	c

My	c
father	c
was	c
a	c
captain	c
on	c
a	c
huge	c
boat	c
.	c

I	c
got	c
the	c
strange	c
feeling	c
I	c
could	c
jump	c
and	c
follow	c
them	c
.	c

One	c
Saturday	c
I	c
got	c
on	i
my	c
motorboat	c
and	c
rode	c
far	c
away	c
from	c
the	c
reef	c
.	c

Now	c
I	c
can	c
die	c
in	c
freedom	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
boring	c
for	c
everybody	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
in	c
your	c
advert	c
you	c
spoke	i
about	i
discounts	c
available	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
the	c
case	c
.	c

No	c
discounts	c
were	c
available	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
.	c

The	c
nightmare	c
started	c
at	i
this	i
time	i
.	c

I	c
though	i
she	c
was	c
a	c
really	c
good	c
friend	c
but	c
I	c
made	c
a	c
mistake	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
ready	c
to	c
fight	c
but	c
somebody	c
stopped	c
me	c
.	c

At	i
this	i
time	i
all	c
the	c
girls	c
became	c
jealous	c
and	c
stopped	c
to	i
laugh	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
now	c
writing	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
the	c
information	c
you	c
have	c
asked	c
about	i
me	c
:	c

Although	c
I	c
do	c
not	c
play	c
perfectly	c
,	c
I	c
play	c
quite	c
well	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
would	c
still	c
like	c
to	c
practice	i
.	c

There	c
are	c
some	c
things	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
:	i
the	c
tipe	i
(	c
and	c
quantity	c
)	c
of	c
Clothes	c
I	c
will	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
,	c
if	i
it	c
is	c
necessary	c
to	c
take	c
some	c
money	c
and	i
any	c
additional	c
stuff	c
(	c
like	c
raincoates	i
)	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
receiving	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

On	i
the	c
tale	c
"	c
It	c
's	c
a	c
good	c
life	c
"	c
,	c
the	c
author	c
gives	c
much	c
more	c
emphasis	c
to	c
the	i
Witte	c
Anthony	c
than	c
to	c
anyone	c
else	c
in	c
the	c
story	c
.	c

He	c
controls	c
the	c
other	c
people	c
using	c
the	c
power	c
of	c
his	c
mind	c
.	c

But	c
a	c
clerk	c
said	c
that	c
time	i
for	c
discounts	c
had	c
been	i
finished	i
.	c

I	c
did	c
not	c
care	c
about	c
money	i
and	c
I	c
rushed	c
into	c
and	i
then	c
took	c
a	c
seat	c
with	c
some	c
food	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
waiting	c
for	c
the	c
show	c
that	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
start	c
at	c
7.30	c
p.m.	c
But	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
8.15	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
upset	c
and	c
disappointed	c
.	c

-	c
How	c
has	c
modern	c
technology	c
changed	c
your	c
daily	c
life	c
?	c

I	c
could	c
not	c
get	c
them	i
.	c

Now	c
I	c
am	c
in	c
England	c
.	c

It	c
saves	c
time	c
.	c

But	c
it	c
might	c
be	c
a	c
problem	c
,	c
making	c
me	c
lazy	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
recently	c
been	c
at	i
your	c
musical	c
show	c
at	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
but	c
I	c
'm	c
sorry	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
very	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
.	c

Every	c
aspect	c
of	c
our	c
daily	c
life	c
is	c
influenced	c
by	c
technology	c
.	c

Sometime	i
I	c
stay	i
alone	c
all	c
the	i
day	c
but	c
I	c
have	c
contacts	i
with	c
many	c
people	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
concerning	c
the	c
London	c
trip	c
that	c
my	c
English	c
class	c
is	c
going	c
to	c
do	i
in	c
March	c
.	c

In	c
what	c
ways	c
do	c
you	c
think	c
people	c
's	c
homes	c
will	c
be	c
different	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
?	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
the	c
advertisement	c
I	c
got	c
layed	i
emphasis	c
on	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
's	c
starring	c
,	i
but	c
eventually	i
,	c
a	c
disappoint	i
unknown	i
actor	c
played	c
his	c
part	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
wonder	c
whether	c
he	c
had	c
real	c
skills	c
to	i
.	c

Yours	c

Bobby	c
did	c
n't	c
use	c
to	c
commit	c
such	c
acts	c
and	c
the	c
story	c
looked	i
very	c
strange	c
.	c

Despite	c
Katie	c
's	c
warning	c
,	c
Pat	c
reached	i
her	c
purpose	c
by	c
questioning	i
carefully	i
her	c
friends	c
,	c
and	c
realized	c
Bobby	c
had	c
been	c
forced	c
to	c
rob	i
this	c
camera	c
unless	i
he	c
wanted	i
to	i
be	i
hurt	c
.	c

Pat	c
knew	c
there	c
was	c
no	c
solving	c
the	c
problem	c
without	c

Dear	c
Mr.	c
Robertson	c
!	i

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
giving	c
us	c
the	c
chance	c
to	c
visit	c
London	c
.	c

We	c
all	i
are	i
exited	i
about	c
the	c
programm	i
you	c
've	c
prepared	c
for	c
us	c
,	c
especially	c
about	c
the	i
visiting	c
the	c
National	c
Art	c
gallery	c
.	c

We	c
have	c
seen	c
an	c
advertisment	i
for	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
in	c
a	c
newspaper	c
.	c

Instead	c
of	c
shopping	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
afternoon	c
we	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
this	c
show	c
,	c
which	c
will	c
continue	c
till	c
7	c
o'clock	c
in	c
the	c
evening	c
.	c

The	c
Home	c
of	c
the	c
Future	c

Future	i
is	c
almost	i
unpredictable	c
.	c

The	i
scintist	i
could	c
invent	i
the	c
4'th	i
dimention	i
and	c
we	i
'll	i
get	c
unlimited	c
space	c
inside	c
the	c
house	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
.	i

This	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
to	c
learn	c
something	c
else	i
because	c
most	c
of	c
us	c
have	c
not	c
been	c
to	c
this	c
kind	c
of	c
show	c
And	i
it	c
is	c
free	c
for	c
students	c
.	c

Then	c
,	c
we	c
can	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
show	c
during	c
that	c
period	c

faithful	i

I	c
was	c
thinking	c
'	c
what	c

Saturday	c
,	c
17th	c
June	c
,	c
2000	c

I	c
live	c
in	c
France	c
and	c
I	c
recently	c
spent	c
a	c
week	c
's	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

It	c
seemed	c
to	c
be	c
very	c
attractive	i
.	c

But	c
in	c
fact	c
it	c
is	c
not	c
!	c

Secondly	c
the	c
show	c
had	i
go	i
on	i
19.30	c
pm.	c
In	c
fact	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
20.15	c
pm	c
without	c
any	c
explanations	i
.	c

This	c
is	c
not	c
the	c
truth	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
clothes	c
will	c
not	c
change	c
so	c
much	c
,	c
because	c
fashion	c
is	c
an	c
eternal	c
cycle	c
.	c

We	c
will	c
find	c
the	c
same	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
with	c
gadgets	c
included	c
.	c

Or	c
special	c
flying	c
shoes	c
,	c
and	c
maybe	c
on	i
your	i
watch	i
you	i
would	i
have	i
a	i
screen	i
to	c
watch	c
your	c
favorite	i
soap	c
operas	c
.	c

Everything	c
is	c
possible	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
fun	c
to	c
see	c
this	c
type	c
of	c
gadgets	i
with	i
old	c
clothes	c
,	c
like	c
a	c
dress	c
of	i
the	c
middle-Age	i
.	c

Fashion	c
is	c
always	c
the	c
same	c

Dear	c
Ms	c
Ryan	c
,	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
which	i
informed	c
me	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
for	i
two	c
weeks	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
in	c
the	c
U.S.A.	c
Here	c
are	i
some	c
information	c
as	c
requested	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hear	i
from	c
you	c
and	c
if	c
you	c
need	c
more	c
information	c
,	c
please	c
do	c
not	c
hesitate	c
to	c
contact	c
me	c

We	c
always	c
need	c
fresh	c
food	c
such	c
as	c
vegetables	c
,	c
fruits	i
,	c
milk	c
and	i
etc.	c
At	i
least	i
most	c
people	c
will	c
do	c
their	c
shopping	c
twice	c
a	c
week	c
for	c
a	i
fresh	c
food	c
.	c

But	c
there	c
was	c
a	c
little	c
problem	c
and	c
it	c
was	c
that	c
my	c
parent	i
's	i
did	c
n't	c
let	c
me	c
go	c
alone	i
to	i
disco	i
's	i
,	c
so	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
go	c
illegaly	i
,	c
and	c
I	c
decided	c
I	c
would	c
do	c
it	c
.	c

All	c
the	c
truth	c
was	c
then	c
told	c
,	c
and	c
now	c
I	c
am	c
grownded	i
for	c
life	c
.	c

Just	c
to	c
remind	c
you	c
of	c
which	c
show	c
I	c
am	c
talking	c
about	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
called	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
.	c

One	c
of	c
the	c
reasons	c
that	c
I	c
chose	c
to	c
see	c
this	c
show	c
was	c
to	c
see	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
live	c
.	c

But	c
there	c
was	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
instead	c
of	c
him	c
.	c

The	c
evening	c
that	c
I	c
spent	c
there	c
was	c
terrible	c
so	c
please	c
may	c
I	c
have	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

Raulet	c
.	c

But	c
people	c
in	i
nowadays	c
like	c
me	c
ca	c
n't	c
even	c
walk	c
1	c
km.	c
And	c
also	c
what	c
is	c
the	c
point	c
of	c
walking	c
when	c
you	c
have	c
cars	c
and	c
buses	c
or	c
even	c
bikes	c
.	c

Computers	c
changed	c
my	c
daily	c
routine	c
because	c
when	i
I	c
was	c
younger	c
,	c
I	c
was	i
spending	i
most	c
of	c
my	c
days	c
outside	c
playing	c
basketball	c
but	c
now	c
,	i
I	c
just	c
play	c
on	c
the	c
computers	c
all	c
day	c
.	c

When	c
e-mails	c
did	c
n't	c
exist	c
,	c
I	c
was	i
writing	i
letters	c
and	c
it	c
took	c
longer	c
to	c
get	c
to	c
the	c
person	c
I	c
am	i
writing	c
to	c
but	c
with	c
e-mails	c
,	i
the	c
person	c
could	c
receive	c
my	c
message	c
within	c
few	i
seconds	c
and	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
to	c
count	c
in	i
how	c
many	c
days	c
he	i
will	c
receive	c
it	c
.	c

Helen	c
Ryan	c

I	c
will	c
do	i
F.C.E	i
in	i
University	i
of	c
Cambridge	c
and	c
other	c
tests	i
in	c
several	c
subjects	c
in	i
my	c
high	c
school	c
.	c

But	i
the	i
way	i
,	c
I	c
do	c
not	c
like	c
to	c
stay	i
alone	c
.	c

Among	c
those	c
activities	c
that	i
you	c
told	c
me	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
choose	c
I	c
prefer	c
singing	c
and	c
painting	c
.	c

I	c
want	c
to	c
know	c
if	c
I	c
can	c
take	c
my	c
celular	i
phone	c
,	c
too	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
a	c
woman	c
then	i
I	c
love	c
it	c
a	c
lot	c
.	c

All	i
weekends	i
I	c
and	c
my	c
boyfriend	c
go	c
to	c
B.H	i
Shopping	c
Center	c
.	c

I	c
live	c
in	c
Site	c
Belo	c
and	c
he	c
lives	c
near	c
B.H.	i
Shopping	c
Center	c
.	c

I	c
know	c
in	i
deep	i
of	i
my	i
heart	i
sometimes	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	i
enjoyable	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
woman	c
.	c

We	c
need	c
different	c
things	c
than	i
men	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
that	c
he	c
forgets	c
my	i
shopping	c

Dear	c
Miss	c
Ryan	c
,	c

About	c
the	c
activities	c
,	c
I	c
chose	c
swimming	c
and	c
climbing	c
.	c

Although	c
I	c
'm	c
not	c
good	c
at	c
climbing	c
,	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
experienced	i
myself	i
.	c

At	i
last	i
thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
answering	c
my	c
questions	c
.	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

It	c
was	c
lovely	c
to	c
hear	c
that	c
you	c
want	c
to	c
hear	c
about	c
my	c
experience	c
.	c

But	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
good	c
experience	c
for	c
me	c
because	c
I	c
learnt	c
how	c
to	c
claim	i
down	c
and	c
play	c
well	c
in	c
front	c
of	c
the	c
audience	c
the	i
concert	c
.	c

When	c
the	c
concert	c
finished	c
my	c
favour	i
singer	c
talked	c
to	c
me	c
&	c
they	c
invited	c
me	c
to	c
play	c
the	c
piano	c
in	c
their	c
next	c
concert	c
and	c
they	c
said	c
that	c
because	c
I	c
performed	i
will	i
in	c
that	c
concert	c
.	c

They	c
taught	c
me	c
a	c
lot	c
about	c
playing	c
piano	c
as	c
well	c
.	c

Best	c
wishes	c

We	c
had	c
preparred	i
quiet	i
a	c
long	c
time	c
ago	c
,	c
this	c
travel	i
to	c
the	c
capital	c
and	c
spared	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
money	c
as	c
well	c
.	c

When	c
we	c
saw	c
your	c
leaflet	c
mentionned	i
"	c
London	c
's	c
newest	c
and	c
best	c
musical	c
show	c
"	c
,	c
we	c
were	c
so	c
enthusiastic	c
and	c
curious	c
that	c
we	c
bought	i
immediately	i
the	c
tickets	c
.	c

One	c
thing	c
that	c
you	c
promised	c
on	c
your	c
leaflet	c
.	c

In	c
100	c
years	c
,	c
it	c
's	c
possible	c
that	c
each	i
people	i
will	c
developp	i
his	c
own	c
style	c
using	c
all	c
the	c
new	c
materials	c
like	c
plastic	c
,	c
latex	c
everything	i
possible	c
,	c
in	i
a	c
way	c
to	c
create	c
own	i
clothes	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
people	c
will	c
wear	i
no	i
clothes	c
anymore	c
,	c
just	c
being	i
natural	c
,	c
nude	i
and	c
feeling	c
free	c
,	c
like	c
many	c
many	c
years	c
before	c
.	c

I	c
wish	i
that	c
my	c
article	c
comes	i
in	c
your	c
magazine	c
.	c

With	c
Best	c
regards	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
about	c
plays	i
and	c
films	c
it	i
will	i
be	i
good	c
if	c
you	c
make	i
more	c
because	c
the	c
children	c
like	c
it	i
.	c

It	c
will	i
be	i
better	c
,	i
if	c
we	c
can	i
make	i
this	c
festival	c
at	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
summer	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	i
,	c

We	c
were	i
going	i
to	c
the	c
toilet	c
and	c
ate	c
something	c
to	i
the	c
snack	c
bar	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
the	i
worse	i
holiday	c
in	c
my	c
life	c
but	c
we	c
continued	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
the	i
life	c
in	c
France	c
are	i
crasy	i
,	c
this	c
is	c
the	c
tradition	c
.	c

This	c
story	c
happened	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
ago	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c

Finally	c
,	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
after	c
show	i
,	c
it	i
is	i
because	i
I	i
saw	i
it	i
was	i
opened	i
at	i
break	i
time	i
for	i
musical	i
,	i
but	i
afterwards	i
,	i
the	i
people	i
of	i
staff	i
for	i
restaurant	i
were	i
closing	i
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
thought	i
more	c
than	c
half	c
population	i
of	c
British	i
has	c
"	i
mobile	c
phone	c
"	c
,	i
it	i
is	i
small	c
and	c
compact	c
,	c
much	c
lighter	c
than	c
home	i
telephone	c
,	c
and	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
biggest	c
advantage	i
is	c
you	c
can	c
carry	c
it	c
,	c
so	c
that	c
easy	i
to	c
contact	c
your	c
friend	c
or	c
someone	c
who	i
other	i
,	i
even	i
they	c
can	c
easy	i
to	i
contact	i
you	c
as	c
well	c

so	c
you	c
can	c

that	i
,	i
these	i
modern	i
technology	i
changed	i
our	i
daily	i
life	i
so	i
diffarent	i
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
been	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
that	c
show	c
since	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
was	c
to	c
be	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
main	c
actors	c
;	c
however	c
,	c
there	c
was	c
other	i
actor	c
instead	c
of	c
him	c
,	c
which	c
came	i
to	i
me	i
as	i
a	i
great	i
disappointment	i
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
as	c
for	c
the	c
times	c
,	i
instead	c
of	c
19.30	c
it	c
all	i
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
,	c
which	c
involved	i
being	c
stranded	c
in	i
the	c
theatre	c
for	c
such	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
.	c

Added	i
to	i
this	i
,	c
I	c
had	c
brought	c
very	c
little	c
money	c
in	c
the	c
hope	c
that	c
I	c
would	c
get	c
a	c
discount	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

Of	i
course	i
,	c
I	c
became	c
aware	c
of	c
her	c
feelings	c
since	c
a	c
friend	c
of	c
mine	c
overheard	c
a	c
conversation	c
between	c
Pat	c
and	c
other	i
girl	c
.	c

Hoping	c
to	c
hear	c
soon	i
from	i
you	i

Nowadays	c
in	i
the	c
year	c
2000	c
we	c
still	c
practice	i
this	c
ancient	c
art	c
but	c
in	c
a	c
diferent	i
way	c
,	c
we	c
do	c
n't	c
use	c
weapons	c
for	c
hunting	c
animal	i
in	c
the	c
jungle	c
,	c
we	c
use	c
the	c
remote	c
to	c
hunt	c
TV	c
shows	c
,	c
and	c
we	c
do	c
not	c
collect	c
vegetables	c
any	c
more	c
we	i
go	c
shopping	c
.	c

This	c
activity	c
of	c
shopping	c
has	c
become	c
one	c
of	c
our	c
most	c
important	c
,	c
after	c
all	c
,	c
we	c
go	c
shopping	c
for	c
any	c
reason	c
,	c
we	c
have	c
develop	i
such	c
an	c
instinc	i
for	c
shopping	c
that	c
we	c
can	c
proudly	c
say	c
,	i
that	c
we	c
are	c
some	c
sort	c
of	c
kings	c
in	i
the	c
urban	c
jungle	c
.	c

If	c
an	c
activity	c
has	c
stay	i
with	c
us	c
,	c
the	i
mankind	c
,	c
for	c
so	c
long	c
,	c
it	c
must	c
give	c
us	c
some	c
pleasure	c
and	c
maybe	c
that	c
's	c
why	c
shopping	c
has	c
become	c
such	c
an	c
important	c
thing	c
in	c
our	c
lives	c
because	c
it	c
gives	c
you	c
pleasure	c
when	c
you	c
find	c
what	c
you	c
have	c
been	c
looking	c
for	c
and	c
if	c
you	c
can	c
get	c
it	c
for	c
less	c
than	c
the	c
price	c
mark	i
on	c
it	c
,	c
that	c
is	c
the	c
greatest	c
extasis	i
.	c

But	c
where	c
is	c
the	c
bad	c
poet	i
of	c
it	c
,	i
well	i
shopping	c
can	c
became	c
horrible	c
in	i
christmast	i
for	c
example	c
when	i
houndred	i
of	c
people	c
goes	i
to	c
the	c
shopping	c
center	i
and	c
it	c
also	c
can	c
take	i
many	c
problems	c
when	c
you	c
become	c
an	c
impulsive	c
buyer	c
.	c

Any	i
ways	i
shopping	c
is	c
with	c
us	c
and	c
it	c
will	c
stay	c
with	c
us	c
for	c
a	c
long	c
time	c

About	c
accomodation	i
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
rather	c
be	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
than	c
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
because	c
in	c
July	c
the	c
weather	c
is	c
really	c
good	c
and	c
when	c
I	c
am	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
I	c
feel	c
closer	c
of	i
nature	c
.	c

Although	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
climb	i
(	c
so	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
complete	c
beginner	c
)	c
.	i

Finally	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
what	c
sort	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
should	c
bring	c
and	c
also	c
if	c
I	c
should	c
bring	c
some	c
money	c
.	c

You	c
can	c

further	c
information	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

The	c
most	c
exciting	c
thing	c
when	c
you	c
help	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
is	c
that	c
you	c
can	c
meet	c
popstars	c
,	c
and	c
,	c
indeed	c
,	c
I	c
met	c
OUR	c
favourite	c
popstar	c
!	c

I	c
talked	c
to	c
him	c
and	c
we	c
ate	c
a	c
sandwich	c
together	c
talking	c
about	c
his	c
album	c
.	c

But	c
do	c
n't	c
worry	c
,	c
I	c
thought	c
about	c
you	c
and	c
he	c
signed	c
an	c
autograph	c
for	c
you	c
,	i
you	i
will	c
find	c
it	c
with	c
this	c
letter	c
.	c

Looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

The	c
second	c
show	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
start	c
at	c
19:30	c
,	c
but	c
to	i
make	i
the	i
matters	i
worse	i
,	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
20.15	c
,	c
so	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
got	i
to	c
the	c
cinema	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

One	c
of	c
the	c
best	c
examples	c
is	c
the	c
car	c
:	c
in	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
cities	c
around	c
the	c
world	c
,	c
cars	c
can	c
be	c
seen	c
in	c
the	c
streets	c
all	c
day	c
long	c
.	c

But	c
technology	c
can	c
also	c
help	c
you	c
at	c
home	c
if	c
you	c
use	c
modern	c
machines	c
for	i
cleaning	i
your	c
house	c
,	c
clothes	c
or	c
dishes	c
.	c

Every	i
time	i
more	i
machines	c
help	i
doctors	c
and	c
nurses	c
with	c
their	c
difficult	c
tascs	i
.	c

For	i
the	c
first	c
activity	c
,	c
I	c
must	c
tell	c
you	c
that	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
keen	c
on	c
singing	c
but	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
very	c
few	i
experience	c
in	c
it	c
.	c

Concerning	c
swimming	c
,	c
I	c
practise	i
this	c
sport	c
once	c
a	c
week	c
on	i
myself	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
am	c
just	c
an	c
amateur	c
,	c
not	c
a	c
great	c
swimmer	c
!	c

Should	c
I	c
take	c
trainers	c
?	c

Or	c
is	c
it	c
better	c
to	c
take	c
only	c
an	c
international	c
credit	c
card	c
?	c

Especially	c
If	c
you	c
go	c
shopping	c
on	c
a	c
Saturday	c
,	c
when	c
people	c
are	c
on	i
week-end	i
.	c

Streets	i
are	c
crowded	c
and	c
you	c
ca	c
n't	c
walk	c
easily	c
.	c

You	c
are	c
embarrassed	i
with	i
the	c
people	c
who	c
are	c
so	c
close	c
to	c
you	c
that	c
you	c
ca	c
n't	c
walk	c
as	c
fast	c
as	c
you	c
want	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
shopping	c
is	c
entertaining	c
if	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
what	c
to	i
do	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
should	c
began	i
at	c
half	c
past	c
seven	c
.	c

despite	i
these	i
fact	c
the	c
show	c
began	c
at	c
a	c
quarter	c
to	c
eight	c
.	c

I	c
do	i
n't	i
.	c

Also	c
,	c
if	c
I	c
use	c
the	c
car	c
,	i
in	i
small	c
distances	c
when	c
I	c
can	i
go	c
on	c
foot	c
,	c
I	c
destroy	i
my	c
physical	i
situation	i
.	c

SOLES	c

CI	c
HACIA	c
DE	c
LOREDES	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
you	i
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
which	c
took	c
place	c
the	i
last	c
1st	c
of	c
May	c
in	i
"	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
"	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

Although	c
we	c
had	c
problems	c
at	c
the	c
entrance	c
with	c
the	c
tickets	c
,	c
we	c
looked	c
forward	c
for	i
that	i
marvellous	c
night	c
.	c

The	c
prices	c
that	c
our	c
travel	c
agency	c
confirmed	c
us	i
were	c
not	c
the	c
same	c
as	c
the	c
theatre	i
,	i
we	i
asked	c
for	c
our	c
special	c
discount	c
for	c
be	i
students	c
with	i
less	c
than	c
eighteen	c
years	c
but	c
we	c
only	c
obtained	c
a	c
rudely	i
answer	c
of	i
the	c
woman	c
who	c
sold	c
the	c
tickets	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
to	c
this	c
,	c
we	c
realized	c
when	c
the	c
show	c
began	c
that	c
the	c
main	c
character	c
was	c
not	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
.	c

At	i
top	i
of	i
everything	i
the	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
and	c
we	c
could	c
not	c
eat	c
on	i
the	c
theatre	c
.	c

You	c
can	c
imagine	c
how	c
upset	c
we	c
were	c
and	c
we	c
asked	i
you	c
for	c
our	i
reward	i
for	c
the	c
night	c
that	c
we	c
spent	c
.	i

Yours	c
Faithful	i

But	c
however	c
it	i
is	c
a	c
good	c
idea	c
to	c
spend	c
out	i
money	c
in	i
make	i
new	c
enterprises	c
which	c
pay	c
the	i
researchers	c
and	i
they	i
could	c
investigate	c
how	c
to	i
improve	i
ourselves	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
to	i
start	c
at	c
19:30	c
a	i
I	c
bought	c
my	c
ticket	c
for	c
the	c
evening	c
session	i
.	c

I	c
asked	c
for	i
the	c
discounts	c
available	c
as	c
we	c
were	c
a	c
group	c
of	c
15	c
people	c
,	c
but	c
the	c
answer	c
I	c
was	c
given	c
was	c
that	c
nobody	c
had	c
ever	c
heard	c
of	c
them	c
.	c

That	c
's	c
why	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
give	c
me	c
some	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
receiving	c
your	c
decision	c
.	c

My	c
daily	c
life	c
has	c
changed	c
quite	c
a	c
lot	c
with	c
modern	c
technology	c
.	c

Then	c
,	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
younger	c
I	c
would	c
have	c
to	c
put	c
the	c
milk	c
on	c
the	c
fire	i
and	c
wait	c
until	c
it	c
was	c
warm	c
enough	c
to	c
drink	c
.	c

Nowadays	c
,	c
almost	c
everybody	c
have	i
a	c
microwaves	i
oven	c
,	c
where	c
you	c
put	c
your	c
milk	c
less	i
than	c
two	c
minuts	i
and	c
it	c
is	c
ready	c
to	c
delight	c
your	c
mouth	c
.	c

Thanks	c
to	c
my	c
mobile	c
phone	c
I	c
can	c
go	c
out	c
until	i
later	c
at	c
night	c
,	c
as	c
my	c
parents	c
can	c
know	c
where	c
I	c
am	c
whenever	c
they	c
want	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
not	c
very	c
experienced	c
but	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
I	c
will	c
find	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
beautiful	c
motives	i
in	c
the	c
USA	c
.	c

I	i
would	c
be	c
very	c
kind	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
inform	c
me	c
about	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
with	c
me	c
and	c
which	i
clothes	c
I	c
will	c
need	c
.	c

Edi	c
Vedder	c
even	c
talked	c
to	c
me	c
about	c
their	c
programms	i
!	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
reply	c
to	c
your	c
questions	c
about	c
Camp	c
California	c
.	c

Currently	c
I	c
'm	c
studying	c
in	c
England	c
and	c
the	c
school	c
finishes	c
at	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
June	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
not	c
a	i
kind	c
of	c
person	c
who	c
can	c
easily	c
fall	c
a	i
sleep	i
and	c
it	c
gets	c
worse	c
when	c
I	c
am	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
.	c

I	c
belonged	c
to	c
a	c
climbing	c
club	c
at	c
my	c
highschool	i
and	c
I	c
've	c
got	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
knowledge	c
from	c
my	c
experienced	c
teacher	c
.	c

I	c
often	c
climbed	c
mountains	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
in	c
high	c
school	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
we	c
should	c
follow	c
our	c
time	c
table	c
if	c
we	c
make	c
a	c
video	c
about	c
daily	c
school	c
life	c
,	c
but	c
we	c
cannot	c
film	c
every	c
lessons	i
so	c
I	c
picked	c
up	i
some	c
interesting	c
ones	c
.	c

Firstly	c
we	i
should	c
defnitely	i
put	c
the	c
news	c
review	c
lesson	c
,	i
because	c
we	c
start	c
every	c
morning	c
with	c
that	c
class	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
where	c
we	c
have	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
discussion	c
.	c

Most	c
of	c
us	c
(	c
students	c
)	c
came	c
to	c
our	c
school	c
because	c
they	c
wanted	c
to	c
study	c
English	c
,	c
so	c
it	c
should	c
be	c
the	c
important	c
part	c
.	c

Then	c
why	c
do	c
n't	c
we	c
film	c
our	c
lunch	c
time	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
also	c
important	c
,	c
is	c
n't	c
it	c
?	c

During	c
my	c
stay	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
your	c
theatre	c
to	c
see	c
a	c
musical	c
show	c
which	i
was	c
OVER	c
THE	c
RAINBOW	c
,	i
however	i
,	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
very	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
.	c

There	c
are	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
differences	c
between	c
the	c
details	c
of	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
on	i
the	c
advertisement	c
and	c
the	i
ones	i
it	i
actually	i
was	i
.	c

I	c
look	c
forwards	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

He	c
was	c
so	c
kind	c
that	c
the	i
could	c
n't	c
stop	i
telling	c
Janet	c
that	c
she	c
was	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
killed	c
by	c
Mr	c
Brown	c
After	i
finishing	i
that	c
Pat	i
left	c
this	i
room	c
.	c

Everything	c
in	c
the	c
room	c
is	i
quiet	c
except	c
the	c
sound	c
of	c
the	c
clock	c
as	i
if	c
everything	c
is	i
going	c
to	c
die	c
.	c

Dear	c
,	i
Sir/Madam	c

Also	c
the	c
musical	c
did	c
not	c
start	c
on	c
time	c
,	i
it	i
was	c
late	i
thirty	i
minuts	i
.	c

We	c
just	c
sat	c
on	c
the	i
seat	i
and	i
nothing	c
to	c
do	c
.	c

If	c
the	c
musical	c
had	c
started	c
on	c
time	c
,	c
we	c
could	c
have	c
eaten	c
in	c
the	c
restaurant	c
.	c

Fathermore	i
,	c
discounts	i
was	i
unavailable	i
.	c

In	c
the	c
advertisement	c
they	c
said	c
that	c
tickets	i
discounts	c
available	i
.	c

Anyway	c
I	c
was	c
so	c
unpleasement	i
.	c

You	c
have	c
responsoiblity	i
for	i
the	c
audiences	c
.	c

My	c
life	c
have	i
been	c
changed	c
by	c
technological	c
improving	i
.	c

I	c
think	c
I	c
should	c
cut	c
down	c
watching	i
TV	c
.	c

And	c
I	c
can	c
send	c
e-mail	c
anytime	c
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
.	i

We	c
must	c
be	c
good	c
at	c
using	c
computers	c
.	c

About	c
when	c
would	c
I	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
?	c

And	c
I	c
think	c
I	c
love	i
togo	i
on	i
July	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
will	c
choose	c
two	c
activities	c
that	c
I	c
good	i
at	c
and	c
not	c
good	c
at	c
.	c

I	c
love	i
to	c
try	c
surfing	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
very	c
interessting	i
sport	c
and	c
use	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
power	c
and	c
enigy	i
so	c
now	c
is	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
the	c
letter	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
every	i
things	i

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c

And	c
about	c
the	c
traffic	c
some	i
times	i
it	c
makes	c
you	c
feel	c
do	i
n't	c
want	c
to	c
go	c
out	c
because	c
of	c
the	c

My	c
favourite	c
season	c
of	c
the	c
year	c
is	c
summer	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

When	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
London	c
,	c
during	c
my	c
holiday	c
,	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
to	c
see	c
a	c
musical	c
show	i
,	c
OVER	c
THE	c
RAINBOW	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
who	c
acted	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
someone	c
else	c
.	c

In	c
fact	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
20:15	i

Thirdly	c
,	c
I	c
also	c
read	c
"	c
Visit	c
our	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
"	c
,	c
but	c
the	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
of	i
painting	i
.	c

Last	c
but	c
not	c
least	c
,	c
it	c
also	c
says	i
"	c
discounts	c
available	c
"	c
,	c
but	c
there	c
was	i
not	c
any	c
staff	c
there	c
who	c
could	c
do	i
it	i
.	c

I	c
looked	c
out	c
through	c
the	c
window	c
and	c
saw	c
a	c
big	c
strange	c
"	c
thing	c
"	c
.	c

It	c
looked	c
like	c
a	c
floating	c
potato	c
,	c
a	c
brown	c
potato	c
.	c

After	c
that	c
a	c
being	c
climed	i
out	c
from	i
the	c
potato	c

I	c
went	c
back	c
to	c
my	c
chair	c
and	c
when	c
I	c
looked	c
up	c
I	c
saw	c
my	c
main-teacher	i
walking	c
through	c
the	c
door	c
with	c
the	c
being	c
after	i
him	c

Immediantely	i
after	c
I	c
heard	c
"	i
And	c
do	c
n't	c
forget	c
your	c
homework	c
"	c

Dear	c

Moreover	c
there	c

"	c
It	c
was	c
dangerous	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
knew	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
"	i
Peter	c
whispered	c
smiling	i
at	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
hear	c
a	i
owl	c
hooting	c
in	c
the	c
tree	c
nearby	c
.	c

As	c
a	c
postman	c
,	c
Peter	c
,	i
had	c
to	c
deliver	c
letters	c
aroud	i
our	c
little	c
village	c
.	c

She	c
stared	c
suspiciously	c
at	c
me	c
through	c
her	i
glasses	c
on	c
the	c
tip	c
of	c
her	c
nose	c
.	c

It	c
started	c
when	c
I	c
received	c
the	c
advertisement	c
on	c
the	c
street	c
.	c

According	i
to	i
that	c
,	c
I	c
thought	c
I	c
'd	c
have	c
a	c
wonderful	c
night	c

I	i
'd	i
like	i
so	i
,	i
to	c
reiceve	i
my	c
money	c
back	c

Yours	c
Faithfully	c

I	c
also	c
got	i
recently	i
a	c
celular	i
phone	c
and	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
now	i
I	i
lived	c
so	c
long	c
without	c
one	c
-	c
because	c
it	c
help	i
to	c
solve	c
the	i
problems	c
so	c
quickly	c
,	c
it	c
's	c
really	c
amazing	c
.	c

There	c
are	c
some	c
of	c
the	c
modern	i
techonologys	i
that	c
most	c
help	c
me	c
but	c
there	c
are	c
some	c
others	c
which	c
are	c
also	c
very	c
important	c
for	c
me	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
the	c
kind	c
letter	c
you	c
have	c
sent	c
me	c

At	c
present	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
taking	c
my	c
exams	c
and	c
am	c
fully	c
occupied	c
with	c
studying	c
.	c

It	c
would	c
also	c
be	c
a	c
chance	c
to	c
try	c
it	c
out	c
for	c
the	c
first	c
time	c
in	c
my	c
life	c
.	c

Would	c
the	c
weather	c
be	c
quite	c
hot	c
?	c

Would	c
you	c
recommend	c
me	c
to	c
take	c
an	c
extra	c
bottle	c
of	c
sun	c
block	c

Would	c
there	c
be	c
a	c

How	c
are	c

You	c

Okay	c

There	c

have	c
been	c
hundreds	c
out	c
there	c
-	c
dancing	c
,	c
laughing	c
,	c
shouting.	c
.	c

We	c
shook	c
hands	c
and	c
they	c
even	c
wrote	c

)	c
their	c
signatures	c
on	c

Really	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
with	c
regards	c
to	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
'	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
'	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
going	c
to	c
complaining	i
about	c
it	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
to	c
this	c
,	c
I	c
could	c
not	c
get	c
a	c
cheaper	c
ticket	c
so	c
I	c
wonder	c
why	c
the	c
advertisement	c
mentioned	c
about	i
the	c
reduction	i
tickets	i
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
despite	c
there	c
were	i
some	c
restaurants	c
in	c
the	c
theatre	c
,	c
they	i
had	i
already	i
closed	i
because	i
it	i
was	i
too	i
late	i
,	i
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
coffee	c
but	c
I	c
could	c
not	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
understand	c
me	c
and	c
the	c
show	c
is	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
succeeded	i
.	c

I	c
was	c
happy	c
at	c
that	c
time	c
and	c
I	c
met	c
with	i
him	c
almost	c
every	c
day	c
.	c

I	c
believed	c
that	c
I	c
get	i
married	c
to	c
him	c
although	i
my	c
happiness	c
did	c
n't	c
last	c
.	c

One	c
day	c
,	c
Pat	c
gave	c
me	c
a	c
ring	c
and	c
she	c
told	c
me	c
that	c
my	c
best	c
friend	c
was	c
going	c
out	c
with	c
my	c
boyfriend	c
in	c
secret	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
too	c
shocked	c
to	c
eat	c
anything	c
.	c

If	c
I	c
did	i
n't	i
hear	i
from	i
Pat	i
anything	i
,	c
I	c
could	c
have	c
got	c
married	c
him	i
.	c

I	c
could	c
n't	c
do	c
anything	c
and	c
two	c
month	i
later	c
,	c
my	c
boyfriend	c
got	c
married	c
to	c
my	c
best	c
friend	c
.	c

I	c
felt	c
sad	c
and	c
miserable	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
,	i
I	c
will	c
be	c
working	c
for	c
the	c
rest	c
of	c
the	c
summer	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
,	c
since	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
sleep	c
in	c
tiny	c
,	c
narrow	c
areas	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
the	i
sort	c
of	c
the	i
clothes	c
I	c
am	c
supposed	c
bring	c
.	c

What	c
's	c
my	c
fund	i
limit	i
?	c

I	c
would	c
really	c
appreciate	c
if	i
you	c
could	c
write	c
me	i
back	c
.	c

The	c
oppurnity	i
of	c
being	c
able	c
to	c
help	c
in	c
the	c
concert	c
knocked	c
on	c
my	c
door	c
by	c
chance	c
.	c

The	c
idea	c
of	c
meeting	c
a	c
worldwide	i
known	i
pop	i
singer	i
;	i
just	c
made	c
my	c
heart	c
punch	c
my	c
ribcage	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
you	i
because	c
my	c
class	c
want	c
to	c
give	c
a	c
surprise	c
birthday	c
party	c
for	c
your	c
husband	c
Mr	c
Brown	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
could	i
you	c
let	c
us	c
know	c
if	c
the	c
date	c
of	c
June	c
16th	c
is	c
all	c
right	c
with	c
his	c
timetable	c
program	i
.	i

We	c
have	c
organised	c
to	i
do	i
the	c
party	c
between	c
three	c
to	i
six	c
o'clock	c
in	c
afternoon	i
in	c
College	i
Canteen	i
,	c
about	c
food	i
we	i
organised	i
a	c
buffet	c
,	c
but	c
could	c
you	c
also	c
help	c
us	c
with	c
the	c
music	c
which	c
he	c
prefer	i
,	c
if	c
prefer	i
something	c
especialy	i
.	c

We	c
have	c
invite	i
the	c
student	i
,	c
the	c
teachers	c
and	c
the	c
Principal	c
of	c
school	i
but	c
we	c
appreciate	i
if	i
you	c
are	i
coming	i
.	c

Family	c
life	c
in	i
our	i
days	i
is	c
very	c
important	c
because	c
both	c
of	i
parents	c
work	c
and	c
they	c
have	c
n't	c
any	c
time	c
for	c
children	i
.	c

So	c
we	c
also	c
try	c
to	c
make	c
our	c
time	c
creative	c
when	c
we	c
are	c
with	c
our	c
children	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs.	c
Ryan	c
:	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
because	c
I	c
received	c
your	c
letter	c
saying	c
that	c
I	c
won	c
first	c
prize	c
,	c
a	c
two	c
week	c
holiday	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
in	c
U.S.A	i
,	c
and	c
that	c
you	c
need	c
further	c
information	c
from	c
me	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
because	c
I	c
think	c
they	c
're	c
more	c
comfortable	c
than	c
the	i
tents	c
,	c
also	c
because	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
like	c
to	c
sleep	c
in	c
tents	c
very	c
much	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
they	c
're	c
very	c
cold	c
during	c
the	c
night	c

Another	c
factor	c
could	c
be	c
when	c
you	c
are	c
in	c
a	c
shop	c
and	c
you	c
are	c
not	c
well	i
attended	c
,	i
the	i
people	c
that	c
work	c
in	c
the	c
shop	c
are	c
doing	c
other	c
things	c
,	i
and	c
cannot	c
help	c
you	c
,	c
so	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
look	c
for	c
the	c
things	c
you	c
want	c
to	c
buy	c
by	i
your	i
own	i
.	c

I	c
think	c
this	c
is	c
a	c
common	c
problem	c
in	c
shops	c
,	c
and	c
that	c
's	c
why	c
sometimes	c
people	c
leave	c
the	c
shop	c
without	c
buying	c
anything	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
thing	i
the	c
solution	c
would	c
be	c
to	c
hire	c
more	c
workers	c
.	c

AND	c
FOR	i
SEEING	c
IT	c
MY	c
FAMILY	c
HAD	c
A	c
VERY	c
DISAPPOINTING	c
EVENING	c
AND	c
SO	c
DID	c
I	c
FOR	i
IT	i
YOU	i
CAN	c
READ	c
BELOW	c
MY	c
POINT	c
OF	c
VIEW	c
ABOUT	i
IT	i
.	c

I	c
THINK	c
THAT	c
ONLY	i
FOR	i
IT	i
THE	i
MUSICAL	i
SHOW	i
HAD	i
TO	i
HAVE	i
BEING	i
CANCELED	i
.	c

NOWDAYS	i
THE	c
MAJORITY	c
OF	c
PEOPLE	c
HAVE	c
A	c
COMPUTER	c
IN	c
THEIR	c
HOME	c
AND	c
SOMETIMES	c
WE	c
WONDER	i
OURSELVES	c
HOW	i
WILL	i
MODERN	i
TECHNOLOGY	i
CHANGE	c
OUR	c
DAILY	c
LIFE	c
.	c

FROM	c
OUR	c
HOME	c
WE	c
CAN	c
USE	c
IT	c
FOR	c
DOING	c
A	c
LOT	c
OF	c
THINGS	c
LIKE	c
TO	i
BUY	i
FOOD	c
;	c
TO	i
WORK	i
,	c
TO	i
READ	i
NEWSPAPERS	c
AND	c
MANY	c
MORE	c
THINGS	c
.	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c

Im	i
very	c
greatful	i
to	c

's	c
wonderful	c
that	c
you	c

You	c
asked	c
me	c

my	c
experience	c
to	i
help	i
in	i
the	c
concencert	i

I	c
was	c
asked	c
to	c
put	c
in	i
order	i
all	i
the	i
chair	i
for	c
the	c
singer	c
,	i
this	i
was	c
only	c
in	c
the	c
begining	i
,	i
after	i
that	c
I	c
need	i
to	c

Write	c
to	c

and	c
tell	c
me	c

With	c
Love	c

Last	c
night	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
your	c
theatre	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	i
"	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
what	c
I	c
expected	c
to	c
see	c
.	c

Actually	c
this	c
happened	i
because	c
the	i
most	c
things	c
I	c
saw	i
were	c
differend	i
from	c
what	c
the	c
advertisement	c
had	i
been	i
written	i
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
it	c
had	i
been	i
written	i
that	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
were	c
starring	c
,	c
but	c
Danny	c
was	c
n't	c
there	c
and	c
somebody	c
else	c
took	c
his	c
place	c
.	c

Yours	c
senciarly	i

After	c
we	c
had	c
had	c
an	c
argument	c
she	c
told	c
all	c
the	c
school	c
my	c
secrets	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
really	c
big	c
surprise	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

Felicia	c
Zajac	c

I	c
saw	c
a	c
beautiful	c
,	c
long	c
dress	c
.	c

Those	c
shoes	c
must	c
be	c
mine	c
!	c
-	c
I	c
thought	c
.	c

I	c
went	c
in	c
and	c
I	c
asked	c
the	c
shop	c
assistant	c
if	c
I	c
could	c
try	c
it	i
on	c
.	c

-	c
Yes	c
,	c
of	c
course-	c
she	c
replied-	c
but	c
what	c
is	c
your	c
size	c
?	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
angry	c
.	c

I	c
started	c
playing	c
very	c
young	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
've	c
never	c
stopped	c
playing	c
it	c
since	c
then	c
.	c

I	c
will	c
be	c
waiting	c
to	c
hear	c
from	c
you	c

His	c
name	c
is	c
Jimme	c
,	c
he	c
is	c
a	c
really	c
nice	c
guy	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
it	c
turned	c
out	c
that	c
Jimme	c
was	c
organizing	c
the	c
concert	c
and	c
he	c
asked	c
me	c
and	c
three	c
of	c
my	c
friends	c
if	c
we	c
wanted	c
to	c
help	c
at	c
the	c
concert	c
.	c

Our	c
job	c
was	c
to	c
make	c
the	c
band	c
feel	c
comfortable	c
and	c
to	c
give	c
them	c
anything	c
they	c
pleased	i
.	c

The	c
guys	c
from	c
Korn	c
were	c
really	c
nice	c
to	c
us	c
and	c
we	c
had	c
a	c
great	c
time	c
with	c
them	c

Dear	c
Sir	c

For	c
weeks	c
I	i
've	i
been	c
planing	i
to	c
go	c
to	c
this	i
threatre	i
with	c
some	c
close	c
relatives	c
and	c
friends	c
but	c
the	c
problems	c
that	c
we	c
had	c
made	c
this	c
perfect	c
night	c
a	c
disaster	c
has	i
all	c
of	c
us	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
expect	c
nothing	c
less	c
than	c
a	c
full	c
refund	c
of	c
the	c
money	c
I	c
paid	c
to	c
see	c

so	i

What	c
are	c
going	i
to	i
look	i
the	i
clothes	i
in	i
a	c
century	c

The	c

of	c
new	c
fabrics	c

colours	i
and	c
quality	c
,	c
make	i
new	c
fashions	i
statements	c
every	c

In	c
the	c
early	c
90s	c
it	c
was	c
in	c
fashing	i
the	i
women	c
to	c
wear	c
only	c
skirts	c

Nowdays	i
women	c
were	i
really	c
short	c

and	c
cut	c
their	c
hair	c

just	c
like	c
men	c

If	c
this	c
continues	c
the	i
two	i
lives	i
will	i
turn	i
the	i
one	i
to	i
the	i
other	i
and	c
soon	c
men	c
will	c

Clothes	c

Lanky	i

The	c
title	c
of	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
was	c
OVER	c
THE	c
RAINBOW	c
The	i
actors	c
was	i
2	c
actors	c
that	c
I	c
can	i
say	i
they	i
play	i
very	i
well	i
.	c

The	c
first	c
was	c
very	c
early	c
at	i
2:30	c
and	i
the	c
ather	i
at	c
7:30	c
.	c

We	c
wate	i
one	c
hour	c
.	c

When	c
the	c
show	c
finished	c
we	i
went	c
to	c
the	c
restaurant	c
and	c
was	i
closed	c
because	c
the	c
people	c
who	c
whork	i
ther	i
they	i
do	c
n't	c
wark	i
if	c
they	c
do	c
n't	c
pay	i
first	c

I	c
would	i
expected	i
your	c
answer	c

We	c
are	c
in	c
the	c
2000	i
year	i
.	c

About	c
the	c
T.V.	i
I	c
ingoing	i
spend	c
many	c
ours	i
in	c
T.V.	i
It	c
makes	i
me	c
to	c
relaxe	i
and	c
stay	i
same	i
hours	c
along	i
.	c

Exactly	i
happend	i
and	i
with	i
telephone	i
.	c

Now	c
if	i
we	i
made	i
a	i
conclution	i
we	c
can	c
see	c
or	i
I	c
can	c
see	c
that	i
mapy	i
I	c
do	i
n't	i
be	i
so	i
sociaple	i
person	c
bad	i
I	c
can	c
do	c
what	i
ever	i
I	c
want	c
and	c
take	c
what	i
ever	i
I	c
want	c
only	c
throu	i
the	i
technology	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
,	c

Then	c
,	c
another	c
thing	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
mention	c
is	c
that	c
the	c
time	c
advertised	c
was	c
wrong	c
,	c
because	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
why	c
would	i
have	c
a	c
perfect	c
evening	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
did	c
not	c
have	c
one	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
have	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
in	c
the	c
very	c
near	c
future	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

When	c
they	c
saw	i
the	c
film	c
,	c
Katy	c
and	c
John	c
approached	c
to	i
Peter	c
and	c
told	c
him	c
that	c
they	c
will	i
continue	c
being	c
his	c
friends	c
.	c

1	c
The	c
advertisement	c
says	c
the	c
show	c
starts	c
at	c
19:30	c
.	c

And	c
I	c
think	c
I	c
could	c
find	c
something	c
worth	i
to	c
do	c
than	c
just	c
writing	i
,	c
doing	c
nothing	c
during	c
this	c
spare	c
time	c
.	c

This	c
is	c
because	c
they	c
are	c
rebuilding	c
it	c
again	c
.	c

4	c
I	c
have	i
also	i
thought	i
in	c
the	c
show	c
there	c
was	c
no	i
different	c
actor	c
.	c

It	c
would	c
be	c
greatful	i
if	c
you	c
consider	i
to	i
return	i
my	c
money	c
for	i
the	i
tickets	i
back	i
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

These	c
3	c
F	i
could	i
tell	c
you	c
whether	c
you	c
are	c
up-to-date	c
.	c

This	c
is	c
not	c
nomally	i
what	c
people	c
wear	c
everyday	i
.	c

For	c
example	c
long	c
baggy	c
troossers	i
,	c
which	c
cover	c
your	c
bright	c
brick	i
shoes	c
.	c

3rd	i
"	c
F	c
"	c
could	c
not	c
be	c
anything	c
else	c
apart	c
from	c
something	c
that	c
could	c
make	c
you	c
look	c
"	c
fool	i
"	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
the	c
theatre	i
's	i
play	c
was	c
expected	c
to	c
start	c
at	c
half	c
past	c
seven	c
in	c
the	c
afternoon	i
,	c
however	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
quarter	c
past	c
eight	c
!	c

After	c
all	c
I	c
've	c
been	c
through	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
a	c
refund	c
of	c
my	c
money	c
.	c

Therefore	c
,	c
our	i
life	c
has	c
changed	c
a	c
lot	c
since	c
a	c
hundred	c
years	c
ago	c
,	c
as	i
well	i
as	i
mine	i
did	i
.	c

This	c
achievement	c
is	c
the	c
personal	c
computer	c
,	c
which	c
has	c
grown	c
very	c
fast	c
,	i
because	c
of	c
the	c
help	c
it	c
can	c
provide	c
.	c

With	c
the	c
Internet	c
,	c
I	c
got	i
more	c
socialised	i
using	c
the	c
Relay	c
Chat	c
clients	c
,	c
but	c
also	c
got	i
a	c
kind	c
of	c
boredom	c
,	c
which	c
is	c
known	c
as	c
"	c
Internet	c
Freak	c
Disease	c
"	c
!	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
my	c
life	c
is	c
surrounded	i
by	i
modern	c
gadgets	c
.	c

It	c
only	i
depends	c
of	i
your	c
judgement	c
and	c
the	c
way	c
you	i
're	i
about	i
to	c
use	c
technology	c
.	c

If	c
I	c
can	c
choose	c
my	c
accomodation	i
,	c
I	c
prefer	c
living	i
in	c
tent	i
.	c

Could	c
you	c
tell	c
me	c
what	c
sort	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
will	c
have	c
to	c
wear	c
to	c
play	c
tennis	c
?	c

Could	c
you	c
tell	c
me	c
if	c
I	c
will	c
need	c
money	c
for	c
paid	i
my	c
dinners	c
?	c

I	c
think	c
the	c
best	c
choice	c
is	c
to	c
show	c
many	c
types	c
of	c
activities	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
could	c
be	c
interested	i
to	c
show	c
how	c
students	c
work	c
to	c
write	c
the	c
new	i
paper	i
of	i
school	i
.	c

We	c
should	c
filmed	i
our	c
pub	c
and	c
room	i
of	c
students	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
theatre	c
show	c
you	c
did	i
last	c
week	c
because	c
there	c
were	c
too	c
many	c
irregularities	c
during	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
45	c
minutes	c
late	c
when	c
it	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
start	c
at	c
19:30	c
and	c
anyone	i
explained	c
to	c
us	c
,	c
the	c
public	i
,	c
what	c
was	c
happening	c
.	c

Your	i

Pat	c
's	c
boyfriend	c
could	c
n't	c
believe	c
that	c
story	c
but	c
Pat	c
trusted	c

and	c
she	c
thinked	i
that	c

was	c

About	c

the	c
first	c
one	c
I	c

to	c

Dear	c

How	c
is	c
everything	c

Is	c
your	c
dog	c
better	c
?	c

Well	c
here	c
I	c
'm	c
very	c
fine	c

There	c
I	c
helped	c
with	c
the	c
special	c
effects	c
and	c
the	c
sound	c
.	c

I	c
told	c
then	i
that	c
I	c
will	c
think	c
about	c
it	c
but	c
I	c
belive	i
I	c
will	c
accept	c
the	c
job	c
.	c

The	c
most	c
increible	i
part	c
was	c
the	c
laser	c
show	c

They	c
were	c
drowing	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
things	c
in	c

during	c
the	c

Hi	c
Helen	c
,	c

About	c
my	c
acommodations	i
in	i
the	c
camp	c
I	i
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
because	c
it	c
's	c
safer	c
than	c
being	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
and	c
because	c
you	c
sleep	c
more	c
confortable	i
.	c

The	c
activities	c
that	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
do	c
are	c
signing	i
because	i
my	c
friend	c
told	c
me	c
that	c
im	i
good	c
at	c
it	c
.	i

and	c
the	c
other	c
activitie	i
that	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
do	c
is	c
climbing	c
because	c
I	c
thing	i
it	c
very	i
exciting	c
although	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
tried	c
climbing	c

Your	c

Dear	c
manager	i
of	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c

We	c
thought	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
good	c
chance	c
for	c
us	c
to	c
watch	c
it	c
.	c

"	c
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	i
"	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
start	c
at	c
seven	c
thirty	c
.	c

Then	c
we	c
expected	c
to	c
,	i
see	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
.	c

We	c
did	c
see	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
but	c
we	c
did	c
not	c
see	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
.	c

Fortunately	c
the	c
show	c
finished	c
.	c

That	c
was	c
bad	i
organized	c
evening	c
we	i
thought	c
.	c

What	c
a	c
fool	c
was	i
I	i
.	c

Last	c
Wednesday	c
my	c
sister	c
told	c
me	c
that	c
our	c
grandmother	c
had	c
a	c
serious	c
illness	c
and	c
she	c
was	c
going	c
to	c
die	c
.	c

She	c
told	c
me	c
to	c
tell	c
none	i
.	c

I	c
knew	c
Pat	c
,	c
my	c
cousin	c
,	c
loved	c
our	c
grandmother	c
very	c
much	c
.	c

Despite	c
the	c
fact	c
that	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
tell	i
nothing	c
I	i
thought	c
it	c
was	c
right	c
to	c
tell	c
Pat	c
the	c
truth	c
.	c

After	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
thought	c
I	c
told	c
it	i
to	i
him	c
.	c

Pat	c
started	c
screaming	c
and	c
shouting	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
was	c
sure	c
he	c
would	c
tell	i
nothing	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
wrong	c
.	c

He	c
told	c
me	c
that	c
he	c
had	c
to	c
tell	c
it	i
to	i
my	c
grandmother	c
.	c

Just	i
as	i
Pat	c
left	c
my	c
house	c
he	c
went	c
right	c
away	c
to	c
the	c
hospital	c
.	c

After	c
two	c
days	c
she	c
died	c
.	c

We	c
knew	c
we	c
had	c
lost	c
her	c
for	c
ever	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Brown	c
,	c

My	c
fellow	c
students	c
and	c
I	c
know	c
that	c
your	c
husband	c
has	c
his	c
birthday	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
the	c
16th	c
of	c
June	c
and	c
we	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
organise	c
a	c
party	c
for	c
him	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
suggested	i
you	i
to	i
come	i
to	c
our	c
party	c
and	c
we	c
would	c
like	c
not	i
to	c
tell	i
anything	i
to	i
your	i
husband	i
because	c
the	c
party	c
is	c
a	c
surprise	c
.	c

At	i
the	i
party	i
will	i
come	i
his	i
students	i
,	i
the	i
teachers	i
and	i
the	i
principal	i
.	c

My	c
last	c
question	c
is	c
about	c
present	i
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

I	c
stopped	c
talking	c
to	c
my	c
friends	c
and	c
I	c
followed	c
him	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
ask	c
him	c
.	c

At	c
that	c
moment	c
we	c
saw	c
the	c
bus	c
to	i
come	i
,	c
it	c
stopped	c
and	c
one	c
man	c
come	i
and	c
sit	i
near	c
of	i
us	c
.	c

I	c
could	i
recognise	i
him	c
.	c

He	c
was	c
my	c
father	c
.	c

I	c
though	i
that	c
I	c
was	c
dreaming	c
but	c
I	c
was	c
n't	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
some	c
further	c
information	c
that	c
you	c
enquired	i
for	c
the	i
Camp	c
California	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
know	c
if	c
I	c
need	c
any	c
particular	c
clothes	c
or	c
if	c
there	c
could	c
be	c
any	c
extra	c
expenses	c
for	c
the	c
camp	c
.	c

I	c
helped	c
people	c
setting	c
and	i
decorating	c
the	c
concert	c
hall	c
which	c
was	c
great	c
help	c
for	c
my	c
major	c
subject	c
-	c
You	c
know	c
that	c
my	c
subject	c
is	c
design	c
.	c

I	c
also	c
had	c
to	c
distribute	c
the	c
flyers	c
.	c

How	c
are	c
you	c
?	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
and	i
the	c
most	c
important	c
for	c
me	c
is	i
that	c
you	c
lie	c
to	c
your	c
audience	c
.	c

Unfortunatly	i
your	c
advertisment	i
said	c
that	c
the	c
show	c
starts	c
at	c
19:30	c
but	c
it	c
started	c
45	c
minutes	c
later	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
that	c
's	c
why	c
I	c
'm	c
asking	c
you	c
to	c
give	c
me	c
,	i
some	c
of	c
money	i
back	c
.	c

That	c
's	c
a	c
good	c
question	c
!	c

You	c
might	c
not	c
know	c
your	c
neighbour	c
because	c
all	i
the	i
time	i
your	i
in	i
the	i
house	i
.	c

Children	c
are	c
not	c
studying	c
as	c
much	c
they	i
have	i
to	c
,	c
because	c
they	c
are	c
watching	c
T.V	i
,	c
speacing	i
on	c
the	c
phone	c
or	c
even	c
playing	c
computer	c
games	c
.	c

And	c
ofcourse	i
my	c
parents	c
were	c
very	c
angry	c
with	c
me	c
.	c

This	c
is	c
also	c
another	c
reason	i
of	c
heard	i
attacts	i
.	c

Dear	c
Ms	c
Ryan	c

I	c
'm	c
very	c
much	c
surprised	c
to	c
receive	c
your	c
letter	c
announcing	c
the	c
first	i
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
and	c
I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
spend	i
the	i
two	c
weeks	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
rather	c
sleep	c
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
.	c

I	c
find	i
it	c
will	c
be	c
much	c
more	c
comfortable	c
than	c
a	c
tent	c
.	c

The	c
leisure	c
activities	c
sound	c
fantastic	c
especially	i
climbing	c
and	c
photography	c
.	c

The	c
other	c
activity	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
try	c
is	c
photography	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
no	c
previous	c
experience	c
on	i
it	c
but	c
I	c
wish	i
I	i
'd	i
learn	i
a	c
lot	c
.	c

Do	c
I	c
need	c
passport	i
to	c
travel	c
?	c

What	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
would	c
be	c
appropriate	c
,	c
winter	c
or	c
summer	c
?	c

Are	c
there	c
any	c
food	i
service	i
at	c
the	c
camp	c
?	c

This	c
is	c
a	c
report	c
to	c
plan	c
and	c
suggest	c
ideas	c
for	c
the	c
daily	i
life	i
video	c
at	c
school	c
.	c

The	c
activities	c
suggested	c
are	c
write	i
below	c
.	c

It	c
would	c
reflect	c
the	c
atmosphere	c
when	c
they	c
meet	c
early	c
in	c
the	c
morning	c
.	c

Why	c
do	c
n't	c
include	i
some	c
sports	c
,	c
for	c
example	c
,	c
voleyball	i
?	c

And	c
they	c
'll	c
certainly	c
feel	c
very	c
proud	c
of	c
being	c
at	i
the	c
video	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

Your	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
musical	c
show	i
,	i
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
,	i
said	c
it	c
was	c
London	c
's	c
newest	c
and	c
best	c
musical	c
show	c
,	i
I	c
agree	c
with	c
that	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
wonderfull	i
show	c
but	c
,	i
it	c
said	c
that	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
would	c
be	c
starring	c
in	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
really	c
excited	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
turned	c
out	c
to	c
be	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
and	c
I	c
thought	c
that	c
was	c
quite	c
disappointing	c
.	c

As	c
we	c
know	c
,	c
Carla	c
and	c
Pat	c
were	c
good	c
friends	c
so	c
Carlotta	c
would	c
tell	c
Pat	c
anything	c
.	c

This	c
time	c
she	c
told	c
Pat	c
that	c
she	c
thought	c
her	c
dog	c
,	c
Churls	c
,	c
was	c
going	c
to	c
die	c
.	c

Pat	c
could	c
n't	c
resist	c
herself	i
and	c
told	c
her	c
brother	c
Jacob	c
,	i
he	i
was	c
quite	c
shocked	c
about	c
the	c
news	c
because	c
,	i
he	c
missunderstood	i
.	c

Jacob	c
runs	c
as	c
fast	c
as	c
sound	c
to	c
get	c
to	c
Charles	c
's	c
house	c
.	c

"	c
She	c
said	c
she	c
was	c
going	c
to	c
kill	c
you	c
!	c
"	c

Jacob	c
shouts	c
.	c

Charles	c
exclaims	c
.	c

They	c
managed	c
to	c
sort	c
everything	c
out	c
and	c
Carlotta	c
never	c
had	c
anymore	c
secrets	c
.	c

Hello	i
!	i

A	c
log	c
cabin	c
does	c
n't	c
sound	c
like	c
a	c
camp	i
holiday	c
.	c

Both	i
activities	i
I	i
've	i
never	i
done	i
in	i
my	i
life	i
,	c
so	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
complete	c
beginner	c
in	i
playing	c
Golf	i
and	i
in	i
Surfing	i
.	c

But	c
the	c
reason	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
try	c
these	c
two	c
activities	c
are	i
their	c
image	c
.	c

Golf	c
play	i
the	i
wealthy	c
people	c
,	c
the	i
upper	i
class	i
of	i
a	i
town	i
,	c
and	c
surfing	c
sounds	c
like	c
freedom	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
see	c
this	c
musical	c
'	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
'	c
because	c
the	c
actor	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
was	c
acting	c
in	c
it	c
.	c

It	c
supposed	i
to	c
start	c
at	c
19.30	c
pm	c
in	c
the	c
evening	c
but	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
wait	c
for	c
more	c
than	c
half	c
an	c
hour	c
.	c

Also	c
I	c
bought	c
a	c
£	c
20	c
ticket	c
because	c
in	i
the	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
show	c
was	i
put	i
that	c
discounts	c
were	c
available	c
for	c
£	c
10	c
£	c
15	c
,	c
£	c
20	c
tickets	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
have	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
in	c
ten	c
days	c
,	c
in	i
the	i
other	i
case	i
,	c
I	c
would	i
have	c
to	c
sue	c
you	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

I	c
'm	c
telling	c
you	c
this	c
because	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
big	c
trouble	i
a	c
few	c
days	c
ago	c
because	c
of	c
her	c
.	c

At	c
first	c
,	c
I	c
thought	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
bit	c
strange	c
but	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
care	c
too	c
much	c
about	c
that	c
and	c
I	c
easily	c
forgot	c
it	c
.	c

My	c
new	c
friends	c
sometimes	c
talked	c
to	c
me	c
about	c
Pat	c
and	c
they	c
asked	c
me	c
once	c
if	c
we	c
were	c
close	c
friends	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
they	c
had	c
already	c
knew	i
all	c
my	c
secrets	c
for	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
!	c

At	c
first	c
,	c
Pat	c
denied	c
all	c
the	c
things	c
my	c
friends	c
told	c
me	c
about	c
herself	i
but	c
she	c
finally	c
agreed	c
with	c
that	c
.	c

I	c
thanked	c
my	c
new	c
friends	c
for	c
not	c
to	i
tell	i
anybody	c
my	c
secrets	c
though	i
before	c
the	c
trouble	c
they	i
and	i
me	i
were	c
n't	c
very	c
friends	i
.	c

First	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

Your	c
letter	c
also	c
mentioned	c
some	c
kind	c
of	c
activities	c
in	c
which	c
we	c
can	c
involve	i
through	i
the	c
camping	i
.	c

On	i
the	i
other	i
hand	i
,	i
I	c
would	c
also	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
some	i
about	i
further	c
details	c
like	c
wether	i
we	c
need	c
to	c
bring	c
we	i
us	i
some	i
clothes	i
or	c
it	i
will	c
be	c
provided	c
to	i
us	c
and	c
if	c
we	c
need	c
some	c
money	c
in	c
case	c
we	c
have	c
to	c
afford	i
something	c
.	c

The	c
first	c
day	c
we	c
have	i
to	c
move	i
to	c
the	c
airport	c
to	c
bring	c
all	c
the	c
equipment	c
by	c
lorries	i
to	c
the	c
camp	c
.	c

Putting	c
the	c
instrument	i
in	c
the	c
right	c
place	c
,	c
testing	c
all	c
the	c
microphone	i
as	c
well	c
as	c
the	c
sound	c
was	c
the	c
rest	c
of	c
the	c
job	c
.	c

At	c
first	c
I	c
though	i
I	c
would	c
just	c
make	i
a	c
bit	c
of	c
sight-seeking	i
all	c
around	c
the	c
city	c
.	c

No	c
sooner	c
had	c
I	c
seen	c
the	i
starring	c
actor	c
than	i
I	c
could	c
n't	c
believe	c
it	c
.	c

But	c
as	c
the	c
show	c
began	c
,	c
I	c
realised	c
that	c
the	c
actor	c
was	c
someone	c
different	c
,	c
his	c
name	c
was	c
Tim	c
Paradise	c
.	c

Although	c
I	c
found	c
the	c
tickets	i
's	i
prize	i
too	i
much	i
expensive	c
I	c
though	i
that	c
there	c
would	c
be	c
some	c
discounts	c
available	c
,	c
but	c
there	c
were	c
not	c
.	c

As	c
a	c
conclution	i
of	i
that	c
horrible	c
evening	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
visit	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
once	c
the	c
show	c
had	c
finished	c
,	c
but	c
what	c
a	c
surprise	c
when	c
I	c
found	c
it	c
closed	c
.	c

Sincerely	c
:	c

All	i
began	c
when	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
take	c
part	c
in	c
that	c
school	c
project	c
.	c

Although	c
this	c
project	c
could	c
seem	c
a	i
very	c
though	i
work	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
try	c
it	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
rise	i
my	c
low	c
global	i
mark	c
.	c

When	c
night	c
came	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
believe	c
what	c
was	c
happening	c
.	c

And	c
after	c
having	c
corrected	c
all	c
of	c
them	c
,	c
our	c
teacher	c
told	c
us	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
repeat	c
the	c
exam	c
because	c
he	c
realised	c
we	c
knew	c
what	c
the	c
answers	c
were	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c

Secondly	c
,	c
people	c
have	c
to	c
look	c
after	c
their	c
money	c
in	c
the	c
shops	c
,	c
and	c
do	i
n't	i
spend	c
it	c
in	i
the	i
thing	i
that	c
they	c
do	c
n't	c
need	c
because	i
by	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
the	c
month	c
they	c
wo	c
n't	c
have	c
money	i
.	c

Unfortunately	c
your	c
advertisement	c
about	i
it	c
was	c
n't	c
true	c
!	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
disappointed	c
when	c
I	c
saw	c
someone	c
I	c
've	c
never	c
heard	c
about	i
it	i
.	c

Again	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
true	c
.	c

At	i
least	i
,	c
after	c
all	c
my	c
disappointments	c
when	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
visit	c
your	c
restaurant	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
too	c
late	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

For	c
instance	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
organizing	c
a	c
party	c
for	c
my	c
sister	c
's	c
birthday	c
asking	i
all	c
.	i

I	c
was	c
wondering	c
how	c
to	c
tell	c
my	c
parents	c
and	c
I	c
asked	c
Pat	c
if	c
she	c
could	c
keep	c
it	c
secret	c
till	c
I	c
found	c
the	c
way	c
to	c
tell	c
them	c
.	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c

As	c
the	c
letter	c
said	c
that	c
all	i
questions	i
you	i
would	i
like	i
to	i
know	i
,	i
I	i
'm	i
going	i
to	i
give	i
you	i
in	i
the	c
following	c
:	c

In	c
August	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
work	c
so	i
.	c

Secondly	c
I	i
prefer	c
the	c
tents	c
because	c
I	c
've	c
never	c
been	c
in	c
that	i
tent	c
so	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
try	c
.	c

And	c
what	c
is	c
the	c
weather	c
like	c
?	c
which	i
I	i
could	i
bring	i
them	i
to	i
be	i
match	i
the	c
weather	c
.	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c

I	c
think	c
if	c
you	c
have	c
lots	c
of	c
money	c
and	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
what	c
to	c
do	c
with	c
it	c
,	c
do	c
not	c
go	c
shopping	c
give	c
the	c
money	c
to	c
charity	c
,	i
that	i
is	c
better	c
than	c
shopping	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
interested	c
in	c
your	c
advertisement	c
and	c
I	c
booked	c
the	c
friday	i
show	c
while	c
I	c
had	i
been	i
on	c
holiday	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
this	c
theatre	c
made	c
me	c
disappointing	i
from	c
starting	i
the	c
show	c
until	c
finishing	i
.	c

Also	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
delaying	i
for	i
more	i
45	i
minutes	i
than	i
the	i
advertise	i
mentioned	i
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
disappointed	c
in	c
a	i
whole	c
of	c
the	c
show	c
,	i
furthermore	i
,	c
I	c
could	c
not	c
enjoy	c
my	c
holiday	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

Return	c
to	c
the	i
Nature	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
people	c
want	c
to	c
wear	c
special	c
and	c
original	c
clothes	c
to	c
show	c
their	c
own	c
characters	c
.	c

Also	c
countless	c
fashion	i
will	c
be	c
shown	i
.	c

People	c
will	c
prefer	c
to	c
use	c
more	c
natural	c
than	c
chemical	c
things	c
and	c
wear	c
more	c
beautiful	c
and	c
attractive	c
clothes	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
showing	c
their	c
beauty	c
is	c
one	c
of	c
animal	i
's	i
basic	c
instincts	c
.	c

I	c
ca	i
n't	i
stand	c
wearing	c
a	c
suit	c
or	c
kit	c
like	c
which	i
has	c
been	c
showed	i
in	c
Starwars	c

I	c
went	c
to	c
London	c
on	c
holiday	c
and	c
to	c
The	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
to	c
see	c
Over	c
The	c
Rainbow	c
.	c

Although	i
,	c
this	c
musical	c
show	i
was	c
not	c
as	c
good	c
as	c
I	c
expected	c
.	c

On	c
top	c
of	c
everything	c
,	c
you	c
recommended	c
to	i
visit	i
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

however	i
this	i
was	c
closed	c
due	c
to	c
lack	c
of	c
personall	i
.	c

Nowadays	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
more	c
and	c
more	c
people	c
who	c
wants	i
to	c
become	c
designers	c
and	c
the	c
competion	i
is	c
increasing	c
.	c

Due	c
to	c
this	c
the	c
quality	c
of	c
clothes	c
is	c
getting	c
better	c
and	c
in	c
100	c
years	c
we	c
will	c
be	c
asking	c
for	c
a	c
bigger	i
variety	c
of	c
clothes	c
.	c

Although	c
,	c
the	c
price	c
of	c
clothes	c
is	c
increasing	c
,	c
people	c
still	c
buy	c
them	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
the	c
prize	c
two	i
weeks	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
in	c
the	c
USA	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
only	c
in	c
July	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
so	c
many	c
assignments	c
to	c
finish	c
before	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
June	c
.	c

In	i
fact	i
,	c
I	c
really	c
do	c
not	c
mind	c
to	i
stay	i
in	c
log	c
cabins	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
stayed	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
before	c
.	c

I	c
used	c
to	c
be	c
a	c
tennis	c
player	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
fifteen	c
.	c

13th	c
July	c
2000	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
that	i
I	c
just	c
got	c
last	c
week	c
.	c

And	c
then	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
help	c
the	c
singer	c
to	c
do	i
some	c
make	i
up	i
.	c

I	c
was	c
running	c
around	c
to	c
find	c
something	c
I	c
could	c
do	c
,	c
like	c
serving	c
some	c
drinks	c
for	c
staffs	i
or	c
the	c
singers	c
.	c

I	c
really	c
like	c
to	c
help	c
people	c
without	c
something	i
back	c
.	c

This	i
experience	i
I	i
was	i
so	i
prond	i
and	c
very	c
enjoyed	i
.	c

I	i
think	i
I	i
did	i
n't	i
waste	i
my	c
time	c
at	c
all	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
I	c
have	c
learnt	c
a	c
lot	c
from	c
this	c
experience	c
.	c

Well	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
I	c
must	c
stop	c
writing	c
now	c
.	c

I	c
love	i
to	c
come	c
the	i
camp	c
California	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
answer	c
your	c
questions	c
about	c
this	c
trip	c
.	c

Before	i
everything	i
,	c
I	c
'm	c
living	c
in	c
Leeds	c
and	c
also	c
studying	c
English	c
in	i
a	c
college	c
.	c

Such	i
being	i
the	i
case	i
,	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
wait	c
until	c
my	c
college	c
's	c
lessons	c
finishes	i
.	c

On	i
the	i
other	i
hand	i
,	c
I	c
've	c
just	c
learnt	c
from	c
your	c
letter	c
that	c
I	c
can	c
have	i
some	c
sport	i
activities	c
during	c
the	c
camp	c
.	c

But	c
,	c
after	c
staring	i
to	c
work	c
,	c
I	c
had	i
n't	i
any	c
chance	i
for	i
playing	i
basketball	c
.	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

I	c
learnt	c
how	c
to	c
be	i
ready	c
for	c
a	c
big	c
concert	c
!	c

Lots	c
of	c
people	c
came	c
this	i
area	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
also	c
learnt	c
how	c
to	c
arrange	c
something	c
.	c

Then	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
tired	c
but	c
I	c
enjoyed	c
with	i
the	c
music	c
very	c
much	c
.	c

Take	c
care	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Ryan	c

First	c

all	c
,	c
you	c
've	c
asked	c
me	c

I	c
wanted	i

In	i
contrary	i
,	c
I	c
've	c
never	c
sailed	c
in	c
my	c
life	c
and	c
would	c
enjoy	c
to	i
start	i
with	i
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
.	c

To	c
end	c
with	i
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
we	c
will	c
need	c
for	c
the	c
free	c
time	c
and	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
and	c
materials	i
do	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
practise	i
the	c
activities	c
I	c
've	c
choosed	i

Victoire	c
Bouchard	c

First	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
to	i
control	i
the	c
tickets	c
at	c
the	c
entry	i
.	c

Then	c
,	c
during	c
the	c
concert	c
I	i
've	i
helped	i
to	c
serve	c
the	c
beers	c
at	c
the	c
bar	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
make	c
announcements	c
at	i
the	c
loudspeaker	c
for	c
the	c
children	c
who	c
where	i
lost	c
.	c

I	i
've	i
met	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
different	c
people	c
and	c
they	c
all	c
have	i
learned	i
me	c
something	c
new	c
about	c
behaviour	c
or	c
compation	i
.	c

I	c
refer	c
to	c
your	c
letter	c
regarding	c
the	c
prize	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
really	c
pleased	c
to	c
find	c
out	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
an	c
opportunity	c
to	c
spend	c
two	c
weeks	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
in	c
the	c
U.S.A	c
.	c

From	c
the	c
list	c
of	c
activities	c
,	c
which	c
was	c
provided	c
by	c
you	c
,	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
choose	c
photography	c
and	c
swimming	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
swimming	c
as	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
a	c
member	c
of	c
different	i
swimming	c
clubs	c
since	c
I	c
was	c
6	c
and	c
I	c
chose	c
photograthy	i
because	c
I	c
have	c
a	c
new	c
camera	c
and	c
want	c
somebody	c
to	c
teach	c

how	c
to	c

Report	c

Introduction	c
:	c
To	i
support	i
an	i
idea	i
to	i
make	i
a	c
short	c
video	c
about	c
daily	c
life	c
at	c
our	c
school	c
I	c
have	c
spend	i
some	c
time	c
discussing	c
it	c
with	c
other	c
students	c
,	c
observing	i
and	c
analaising	i
an	c
avrege	i
day	c
in	c
our	c
scholl	i
and	c
came	i
up	c
with	c
some	c
suggestions	c
.	c

Places	c
to	c
video	c
:	c
We	c
should	c
try	c
to	c
video	c
not	c
only	c
class	i
rooms	i
but	c
also	c
our	c
playground	c
,	c
cafe	c
,	c
sport	i
hall	c
,	c
art	c
club	c
&	c
library	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
good	c
idea	c
to	c
include	c
a	c
record	c
of	c
one	c
of	c
our	c
big	c
events	c
such	c
as	c
anual	i
sport	i
turnament	i
or	c
wellcoming	i
evening	c
for	c
new	c
students	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
just	c
received	c
the	c
excellent	c
news	c
about	c
the	c
prize	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
all	c
the	c
details	c
you	c
need	c
.	c

About	c
the	c
activities	c
I	c
can	c
choose	c
from	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
be	c
delighted	c
if	c
I	c
could	c
sing	c
,	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
something	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
always	c
loved	c
and	c
,	c
although	c
perhaps	c
I	c
should	c
not	c
say	c
that	i
myself	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
I	c
have	c
a	c
nice	c
voice	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

Because	c
I	c
could	c
see	c
how	c
anxious	c
you	c
are	c
to	c
know	c
about	c
my	c
experience	c
at	c
the	c
Radiohead	c
concert	c
last	c
month	c
,	c
I	c
'll	c
tell	c
you	c
something	c
:	c
it	c
was	c
fantastic	c
.	c

He	c
asked	c
to	i
me	c
to	c
go	c
and	c
when	c
he	c
told	c
me	c
the	c
group	c
was	c
Radiohead	c
I	c
felt	c
the	i
luckiest	c
person	c
in	c
the	c
world	c
(	c
you	c
know	c
I	c
've	c
always	c
been	c
an	c
enthusiastic	c
fan	c
of	c
them	c
,	c
so	c
you	c
can	c
imagine	c
how	c
excited	c
I	c
was	c
)	c
.	c

But	c
the	c
most	c
amazing	c
thing	c
happened	c
later	c
,	c
when	c
ten	i
minutes	c
before	c
the	c
concert	c
began	c
,	c
my	c
friend	c
told	c
me	c
we	c
could	c
see	c
it	c
from	c
the	i
backside	i
of	i
the	i
stage	i
.	c

The	c
playing	i
was	c
excellent	c
,	c
the	c
public	i
enjoyed	c
it	c
very	c
much	c
but	c
,	c
above	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
there	c
,	c
at	i
ten	c
metres	c
from	c
my	c
favourite	c
group	c
.	c

I	c
even	c
got	c
a	c
few	c
friendly	c
words	c
from	c
the	c
singer	c
in	i
a	c
piece	c
of	c
paper	c
:	c
I	c
hope	c
you	c
've	c
enjoyed	c
it	c
.	c

Love	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
let	c
you	c
know	c
the	i
disappointed	i
evening	c
I	c
had	c
seen	i
your	c
show	c
with	c
the	c
worst	c
services	c
I	c
have	c
ever	c
seen	i
.	c

The	c
last	c
thing	c
is	c
that	c
you	c
invited	c
us	c
to	c
visit	c
your	c
restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
the	c
food	c
was	c
not	c
already	i
done	c
.	c

I	c
thought	c
you	c
were	c
a	c
good	c
theatre	c
,	c
were	i
people	c
can	c
go	c
and	c
have	c
a	c
good	c
evening	c
alone	c
or	c
with	c
somebody	c
else	c
,	c
but	c
realy	i
I	c
am	c
very	c
disappointed	c
and	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
ask	c
for	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

Seen	i
my	c
hole	i
life	c
I	c
can	c
say	c
the	i
moden	i
technology	c
has	c
changed	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
in	c
many	c
ways	c
.	c

The	c
first	c
way	i
is	c
that	c
it	c
has	c
changed	c
my	c
family	i
's	i
relationship	c
.	c

It	c
has	c
,	c
in	c
some	c
way	c
,	c
separated	c
the	c
family	i
's	i
life	i
,	c
making	c
all	c
of	c
us	c
be	i
worried	c
about	c
ower	i
own	c
things	c
.	c

The	c
second	c
way	i
is	c
that	c
it	c
has	c
make	i
easy	i
my	i
life	i
.	c

To	c
finish	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
say	c
technology	c
has	c
changed	c
my	c
life	c
in	c
good	c
and	c
bad	c
ways	c
,	c
helping	c
the	i
things	c
be	i
easier	c
but	c
making	c
me	c
develop	i
a	i
big	i
independence	i
.	c

I	c
have	c
just	c
received	c
the	c
letter	c
with	c
the	c
result	c
of	c
your	c
competition	c
.	c

Eventually	i
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
where	c
the	c
camp	c
is	c
located	c
.	c

Will	c
I	c
have	c
the	c
opportunity	c
to	c
visit	c
San	c
Franscico	c
or	c
Los	c
Angles	c
?	c

Moreover	c
,	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
will	c
I	c
need	c
if	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
go	c
out	c
at	c
night	c
?	c

These	c
are	c
some	c
further	c
details	c
I	c
keep	c
wondering	c
about	c
.	c

Yours	c
Sincerely	i

Therefore	c
it	c
must	c
be	c
objective	c
.	c

It	c
would	c
be	c
interesting	c
to	c
film	c
a	c
math	c
lesson	c
.	c

Eventually	i
,	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
nice	c
to	c
make	i
a	c
sequence	c
with	c
lots	c
of	c
sports	c
activities	c
.	c

Moreover	c
it	c
will	c
show	i
of	i
healthy	i
the	c
students	c
are	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
your	c
musical	i
show	c
.	c

We	c
had	c
a	c
very	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
yesterday	c
.	c

We	c
thought	c
that	c
we	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
let	c
you	c
know	c
all	c
details	i
which	i
it	i
did	i
n't	i
make	i
us	i
happy	i
.	c

We	c
were	c
thinking	c
to	i
get	i
some	i
discount	c
on	c
our	c
tickets	c
,	c
because	c
we	c
had	c
already	i
read	c
from	i
the	c
advertisement	c
but	c
they	c
did	c
n't	c
discount	c
the	c
prices	c
so	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
pay	c
complete	i
money	i
for	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

I	c
realised	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
different	i
actor	c
playing	c
instead	c
of	c
Danny	c
brook	i
.	c

This	c
would	c
be	c
the	c
first	c
good	c
memory	i
for	c
us	c
from	i
your	c
show	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
twenty	i
first	i
century	c
things	i
are	c
changing	c
very	c
fast	c
.	c

They	c
have	c
typical	i
this	i
time	i
life	i
style	i
.	c

Fire	c
alarm	c
,	c
burglar	c
alarm	c
,	c
house	c
temperature	c
checker	i
,	c
automatic	c
garage	c
door	c
many	i
of	i
them	i
.	c

In	i
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
thy	i
use	c
all	c
this	c
too	c
much	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
a	i
mobile	c
phone	c
;	i
People	i
talk	c
with	i
it	c
on	c
the	c
street	c
,	c
in	c
the	c
car	c
almost	i
everywhere	c
.	c

They	c
do	c
n't	c
even	c
think	c
how	c
they	c
take	i
the	c
communication	c
lines	c
are	i
busy	c
,	i
how	i
many	c
people	c
on	i
the	c
phone	c
at	c
same	i
time	c
.	i

It	c
developes	i
day	c
by	c
day	c
.	c

Dear	c
manager	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
this	c
letter	c
to	c
inform	c
you	c
that	c
the	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
was	i
with	c
wrong	c
information	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
the	c
actors	c
were	c
different	c
from	c
the	c
ones	c
written	i
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
which	i
was	c
very	c
disappointing	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
according	c
to	c
the	c
advertisement	c
I	i
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
begin	c
at	c
14.30	c
and	c
19.30	c
but	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
20.15	c
.	c

When	c
the	c
show	c
ended	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
visit	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
I	i
could	c
not	c
get	c
in	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
as	c
the	c
chef	i
of	i
the	i
restaurant	i
was	c
not	c
there	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c

Technology	c
has	c
changed	c
our	c
life	c
forever	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
we	c
can	c
cook	c
our	c
meals	c
an	i
electrical	c
stove	c
or	c
in	c
a	c
microwave	c
and	c
it	c
takes	c
just	c
a	c
few	c
minutes	c
to	c
get	c
ready	c
.	c

For	i
those	i
who	c
need	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
make	i
business	c
with	c
other	c
people	c
abroad	c
can	c
fly	c
by	c
plane	c
and	c
arrive	c
in	i
their	c
destination	c
safely	c
or	c
have	c
their	c
problems	c
solved	c
through	i
telephone	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
technology	c
has	c
been	c
a	c
great	c
help	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c

According	c
to	c
your	c
letter	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
10	c
main	c
activities	c
which	c
I	c
can	c
choose	c
2	c
and	c
play	c
while	c
I	c
am	c
on	c
the	c
holiday	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
play	c
Basketball	c
and	c
Golf	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
some	c
question	i
such	c
as	c
clothes	i
and	c
money	c
.	c

What	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
are	c
much	i
to	i
the	i
camp	i
?	c

yours	c
sincerely	c

Dear	c
kim	c

I	c
want	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
how	c
much	c
I	c
enjoyed	c
helping	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
.	c

Howeve	i
,	c
we	c
decided	c
to	c
have	c
the	c
job	c
,	c
because	c
of	c
good	c
money	c
.	c

My	c
job	c
just	c
prepear	i
drink	i
for	c
them	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
disapointed	i
to	c
find	c
out	c
that	c
most	c
of	c
the	c
things	c
said	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
show	c
were	c
not	c
true	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
to	c
wait	c
for	c
forty	i
five	i
minutes	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
for	c
cleaning	c
.	c

By	c
the	c
way	c
,	c
why	c
were	c
n't	c
any	c
discounts	c
available	c
for	c
the	c
tickets	c
,	c
as	c
it	i
was	c
said	i
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
?	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

The	i
easy	i
access	c
to	c
information	c
and	c
the	c
new	c
ways	c
of	c
communicating	c
with	c
other	c
people	c
help	c
me	c
save	c
time	c
that	c
I	c
can	c
spend	c
doing	c
whatever	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
.	c

This	c
can	c
be	c
very	c
useful	c
when	c
you	c
have	c
a	c
problem	c
that	c
needs	c
an	c
immediate	c
solution	c
.	c

All	c
these	c
things	c
save	c
me	c
lots	c
of	c
time	c
.	c

For	c
the	c
next	c
years	i
,	c
we	c
can	c
expect	c
many	c
more	c
technologies	i
that	c
will	c
continue	c
making	c
our	c
lives	c
easier	c
.	c

Dear	c
Helen	c

I	c
'd	c
also	c
like	c
to	c
choose	c
photography	c
and	c
painting	c
from	c
the	c
list	c
of	c
activities	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
've	c
studied	c
Arts	i
for	c
three	c
years	c
,	c
and	c
these	c
two	c
are	c
my	c
favourite	c
hobbies	c
.	c

I	c
'd	c
also	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
'll	c
need	c
for	c
these	c
two	c
weeks	c
,	c
and	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
should	i
I	i
take	c
with	c
me	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
've	c
never	c
been	c
to	c
the	c
States	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
how	i
the	c
weather	c
is	c
in	i
California	c
during	c
the	c
summer	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
hearing	i
from	c
you	c
.	c

Especially	c
if	c
you	c
are	i
going	i
with	c
women	c
or	c
children	c
to	c
the	c
shops	c
.	c

That	c
is	c
my	c
worst	c
nightmare	c
.	c

I	c
never	c
go	c
shopping	c
with	c
women	c
and	i
especially	c
with	c
my	c
mother	c
or	c
my	c
sisters	c
.	c

And	c
that	c
's	c
because	c
they	c
spend	c
hours	c
trying	c
on	c
any	i
kind	i
of	c
clothes	c
,	c
everything	c
you	c
can	c
imagine	c
,	c
and	c
at	c
the	c
end	c
they	c
are	i
not	c
buying	i
anything	c
.	c

Also	c
,	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
be	c
careful	c
when	c
you	c
go	c
for	i
shopping	c
with	c
children	c
.	c

About	c
accomodation	i
,	c
I	c
prefer	c
in	i
tents	c
to	c
log	c
cabins	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
very	c
keen	c
on	c
photography	c
,	c
especially	c
while	c
I	c
'm	c
staying	c
in	c
Sates	i
.	c

So	c
I	c
'm	c
longing	c
to	c
take	c
part	c
in	c
that	c
activity	c
,	c
photography	c
.	c

At	c
that	c
time	c
,	c
I	c
took	c
the	c
course	c
which	c
covered	c
all	c
the	c
4	c
kinds	c
of	c
strocks	i
.	c

And	c
please	c
tell	c
me	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
am	c
supposed	c
to	c
need	c
excluding	c
transport	c
and	c
accomodation	i
.	c

All	c
the	c
students	c
in	c
my	c
class	c
are	c
excited	c
about	c
that	c
work	c
and	c
now	c
we	c
're	c
in	c
the	c
process	c
of	c
discussion	c
about	c
what	c
will	c
be	c
filmed	c
.	c

Every	i
students	i
keep	c
talking	c
about	c
he	i
theme	c
and	c
give	i
their	c
opinions	c
.	c

After	c
the	c
class	c
is	c
also	c
very	i
essential	c
part	c
of	c
school	c
life	c
.	c

Because	c
we	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
pub	c
which	c
is	c
situated	c
near	c
to	c
the	c
school	c
quite	c
often	c
and	c
we	c
talk	c
more	c
about	c
personal	c
stories	c
that	c
make	c
us	c
closer	c
,	i
the	i
pub	c
after	c
the	c
lessons	c
will	c
be	c
interesting	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
allow	c
us	c
to	c
film	c
those	c
things	c
,	c
we	c
'll	c
be	c
very	c
happy	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
choose	c
singing	c
and	c
basketball	c
because	c
my	c
friends	c
say	c
I	c
'm	c
good	c
at	c
both	c
.	c

Singing	c
relaxes	c
me	c
when	c
I	c
am	c
stressed	c
before	c
exams	c
or	c
competitions	c
.	c

Marthe	c
Ouellet	c

Everything	c
was	c
just	c
perfect	c
.	c

The	c
first	c
disappointment	c
confronted	c
us	c
on	i
the	c
main	c
entrance	c
,	i
there	c
was	c
no	c
discount	c
for	c
our	c
ticket	i
available	c
.	c

Your	i
state	i
in	c
your	c
advertisment	i
that	c
he	c
would	c
come	c
on	c
stage	c
,	c
but	c
instead	c
of	c
him	c
someone	c
else	c
turned	c
up	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

I	c
really	c
do	c
regret	c
that	c
I	c
told	c
Pat	c
about	c
my	c
feelings	c
for	c
the	c
new	c
girl	c
in	c
class	c
,	c
but	c
who	c
else	c
can	c
I	i
talk	c
to	c
,	i
if	c
it	c
is	c
not	c
your	c
best	c
friend	c
?	c
.	c

Her	c
name	c
is	c
Carla	c
and	c
she	c
just	c
changed	c
school	c
,	i
she	i
is	c
so	c
beautiful	c
,	c
with	c
long	c
legs	c
,	c
blond	c
hair	c
and	c
a	c
voice	c
which	c
makes	c
me	c
melt	c
.	c

Pat	c
,	c
he	c
was	c
my	c
friend	c
,	c
and	c
he	c
knew	c
girls	c
.	c

I	c
thought	c
he	c
would	c
keep	c
everything	c
like	i
a	i
thing	i
between	c
him	c
and	c
me	c
,	c
but	c
he	c
disappointed	c
me	c
.	c

He	c
actually	c
went	c
to	c
Carla	c
and	c
told	c
her	c
every	i
thing	i
.	c

But	c
she	c
did	c
,	c
she	c
asked	c
me	c
out	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
received	c
your	c
letter	c
bout	i
the	c
competition	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
glad	c
about	c
it	c
.	c

About	c
the	c
activities	c
listed	c
on	i
your	c
letter	c
,	c
I	c
choose	c
basketball	c
and	c
singing	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
played	c
basketball	c
for	c
six	c
years	c

and	c
I	c

in	i
competitions	c
for	c

The	c
advertisement	c
looked	c
pretty	c
interesting	c
and	c
I	c
dicided	i
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
to	c
watch	c
this	c
musical	c
show	c
.	c

The	c
'	c
theatre	c
'	c
even	i
did	i
not	i
appologize	i
for	c
this	c
range	i
.	c

Unfortunately	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
,	c
which	c
made	c
me	c
even	c
angier	i
.	c

The	c
advertisement	c
say	i
'	c
your	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
'	c
,	i
however	i
it	i
was	c
the	c
worst	c
evening	c
I	c
have	c
had	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
you	c
give	i
me	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

Saturday	c
morning	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
driving	c
center	i
for	c
my	c
first	c
lesson	c
.	c

I	c
hope	i
that	c
nobody	c
would	i
watching	c
me	c
.	c

The	c
instractur	i
opened	c
the	c
car	c
and	i
asked	c
me	c
to	c
sit	c
on	i
the	c
drivers	i
sit	i
.	c

It	c
was	c
the	c
worst	c
time	c
I	c
ever	c
had	c
.	c

Then	c
I	c
drove	c
very	c
slowly	c
very	c
ofen	i
crossing	c
the	c
white	c
line	c
on	c
the	c
road	c
.	c

It	c
made	c
my	i
crazy	c
.	c

Next	i
day	c
,	c
I	c
decided	c
that	c
I	c
do	i
n't	i
want	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
school	c
any	c
more	c
.	c

Eventually	i
the	i
things	c
were	c
n't	c
so	c
bad	c
.	c

At	c
the	c
begining	i
I	c
was	c
very	c
angry	c
but	c
in	c
the	c
end	c
I	c
said	c
that	c
everything	c
is	i
O.K	c

Dear	c
Jane	c
Clark	c
,	c

I	c
went	c
to	c
all	c
the	c
events	c
,	c
they	c
were	c
really	c
good	c
.	c

But	c
,	c
can	c
I	c
give	c
you	c
a	c
suggestion	c
for	c
next	c
year	c
?	c

I	c
also	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
dance	c
shows	c
,	c
the	c
art	c
exhibition	c
and	c
the	c
talks	c
by	c
writers	c
,	c
they	c
were	c
really	c
very	c
nice	c
and	c
interesting	c
.	c

In	c
fact	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
really	c
a	c
reasonably-priced	c
ticket	c
,	c
excellent	c
because	c
you	c
could	c
go	c
to	c
all	c
the	c
events	c
only	i
with	c
it	i
.	c

And	c
that	c
's	c
the	c
reason	c
because	i
lots	c
of	c
people	c
came	c
.	c

You	c
have	c
a	c
break	c
of	c
ten	c
minutes	c
,	c
that	i
you	i
would	i
have	i
to	i
do	i
in	i
class	i
.	c

I	c
have	c
some	c
rules	c
also	c
at	c
home	c
,	c
but	c
they	c
are	c
few	c
.	c

My	c
parents	c
are	c
afraid	c
of	c
it	c
because	c
I	c
took	i
my	i
licence	i
only	i
in	c
September	c
.	c

My	c
parents	c
also	c
like	c
eating	c
all	c
together	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
is	c
n't	c
a	c
rule	c
,	c
only	c
an	i
habitude	i
!	c

I	c
like	c
my	c
life	c
,	c
both	c
at	c
school	c
and	c
at	c
home	c
!	c

Write	c
to	c
me	c
soon	c

Dear	c
Madam	c
:	c

For	i
the	c
accommodation	c
I	i
would	c
like	c
to	c
have	c
log	i
cabins	i
rather	c
than	c
tents	i
because	c
two	c
weeks	c
is	c
quite	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
they	c
are	c
more	c
comfortable	c
and	c
give	c
you	c
more	c
privacy	c
.	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
everything	c
looks	c
different	c
if	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
make	i
a	c
present	c
for	c
someone	c
in	c
my	c
family	c
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
most	c
of	c
the	c
time	c
that	c
you	c
spend	c
shopping	c
you	c
put	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
effort	c
choosing	i
things	c
and	c
making	c
decissions	i
and	c
they	c
are	c
more	c
or	c
less	c
important	c
,	c
or	c
more	c
or	c
less	c
enjoyable	c
depends	i
on	c
what	c
,	c
why	c
,	c
where	c
and	c
who	c
is	c
the	c
person	c
that	c
you	c
are	c
interested	c
to	i
please	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
also	c
expecting	c
to	c
get	c
some	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
45	c
minutes	c
late	c
.	c

We	c
all	c
had	c
to	c
sit	c
and	c
wait	c
because	c
there	c
was	c
nobody	c
to	c
explain	c
the	c
reason	c
of	i
the	c
delay	c
and	c
excuse	i
about	c
it	c
.	c

We	c
were	c
also	c
disappointed	c
because	c
there	c
were	c
no	c
discounts	c
!	c

PAT	c
AND	c
SECRETS	c

Knowing	c
that	c
he	i
decided	c
to	i
not	c
to	c
see	c
Alison	c
until	c
the	c
birthday	c
party	c
.	c

Everybody	c
was	c
given	c
a	c
job	c
,	c
and	c
Pat	c
's	c
job	c
was	c
buying	c
the	c
cake	c
and	c
the	c
candles	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
tell	c
your	i
some	i
things	i
that	c
happened	c
to	c
me	c
at	c
the	c
theatre	c
,	i
at	i
that	i
moment	i
I	c
felt	c
astonish	i
thinking	i
about	i
:	c
"	c
How	c
an	i
important	c
theatre	c
have	c
problems	c
like	c
this.	i
"	c

But	c
,	c
Yes	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
It	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
start	c
at	c
19:30	c
and	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
.	c

Yes	c
,	c
45	c
minutes	c
,	i
I	c
want	c
to	c
see	c
you	c
in	c
that	c
case	i
.	c

What	c
would	c
you	c
do	c
?	c

I	c
felt	c
like	c
a	c
dumb	i
,	c
and	c
all	c
the	c
people	i
felt	c
like	i
me	i
.	c

And	c
well	c
,	c
do	c
n't	c
talk	c
about	c
the	c
discounts	c
,	c
because	c
they	c
did	c
n't	c
exist	c
.	c

At	i
end	i
,	c
I	c
could	c
see	c
that	c
the	c
advertisement	c
said	c
"	i
Your	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
"	c
,	i
it	i
was	c
n't	c
the	c
perfect	c
evening	c
,	i
now	i
I	c
'm	c
looking	c
for	c
a	c
layer	i
,	c
because	c
I	c
want	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
,	c
if	i
do	i
n't	i
well	i
you	i
know	i
the	i
end	i
of	i
this	i
story	i
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
,	c
because	c
one	c
day	c
when	c
Maria	c
,	c
her	c
sister	c
,	c
was	c
walking	c
to	c
the	i
school	c
,	c
a	c
car	c
stopped	c
at	i
her	c
and	c
a	c
man	c
said	c
"	i
I	c
know	c
who	c
is	c
your	c
love	i
,	c
it	c
's	c
Peter	c
"	c
.	c

Maria	c
passed	i
all	c
the	i
day	c
thinking	c
about	c
who	c
told	c
them	c
that	c
,	i
there	i
were	c
two	c
posibilities	i
:	c
one	c
her	i
best	c
friend	c
Becca	c
or	i
his	i
sister	c
Pat	c
.	c

But	c
the	c
problem	c
began	c
to	c
increase	i
because	c
all	c
her	c
friends	c
knew	c
her	c
secret	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
like	c
a	c
"	c
chain	c
reaction	c
"	c
,	c
until	c
Maria	c
did	c
n't	c
want	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
school	c
any	i
more	i
,	i
her	i
mother	c
talked	c
to	c
her	c
,	c
but	c
there	c
was	c
no	c
case	i
,	i
she	i
was	c
very	c
angry	c
and	c
hurt	c
.	c

Obviously	c
,	c
Pat	c
first	c
refused	i
,	i
but	c
then	c
she	c
accepted	c
that	c
she	c
was	c
wrong	c
,	c
and	c
apologyse	i
Maria	i
,	i
after	i
then	i
Pat	c
never	c
again	c
talked	c
about	c
someone	i
within	i
his	c
or	c
her	c
permission	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

All	c
this	c
will	c
happen	c
in	c
the	c
next	c
50	c
years	c
,	c
how	c
can	c
we	c
be	c
prepared	c
to	c
receive	c
all	c
these	c
things	c
in	c
our	c
homes	c
?	c

The	c
next	c
50	c
years	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
life	c
will	c
be	c
boring	c
,	c
a	c
large	c
amount	c
of	c
workers	c
will	c
be	c
have	i
redundant	c
and	c
housewives	c
will	c
not	c
have	c
anything	c
to	c
do	c
which	i
will	c
be	c
extremely	c
boring	c
and	c
tedious	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
really	c
surprised	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
.	c

I	c
can	c
only	c
come	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
working	c
in	c
the	c
office	c
and	c
I	c
cannot	c
take	c
two	c
weeks	c
off	c
in	c
other	i
month	c
.	c

I	c
used	c
to	c
be	c
a	c
scout	c
.	c

I	c
need	c
relax	i
after	c
year	i
in	c
the	c
office	c
thats	i
why	c
I	c
choose	c
photography	c
and	c
painting	c
which	c
are	c
not	c
very	c
active	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	i
shy	c
person	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
small	c
group	c
of	c
people	c
,	c
if	c
its	i
possible	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
onc	i
again	c
for	c
this	c
great	c
opportiunity	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
writting	i
to	c
you	c
to	c
give	c
your	i
my	c

If	c
there	c
are	c
more	c
stars	c
and	c
artists	c
from	c
around	c
the	c
world	c
,	c
there	i
are	i
more	i
plays	i
and	i
films	i
and	i
it	c
is	i
better	c
.	c

To	c
conclude	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
happy	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
ticket	c
for	c
all	c
events	c
at	c
one	i
reasonally	i
price	c
,	c
because	c
for	c
someone	c
who	c
do	i
not	c
like	i
especially	i
art	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
very	c
attractive	c

There	c
are	i

anything	c
that	c
I	c

as	c
you	c

Dear	c
Ms	c
Clark	c
,	c

I	c
believe	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
great	c
idea	c
to	c
organise	c
such	c
a	c
festivel	i
,	c
connected	c
with	c
art	c
and	c
culture	c
.	c

However	c
I	c
was	c
really	c
suprised	i
that	c
the	c
entrence	i
fee	c
was	c
so	c
low	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Dear	c
Tom	c
,	c

Just	i
I	i
got	i
your	c
letter	c
and	c
sat	c
straight	i
away	c
to	c
write	i
you	i
a	i
few	i
sentences	i
that	c
will	c
illustrate	c
my	c
opinion	c
.	c

Although	c
we	c
have	c
to	c
change	c
our	c
boots	i
,	c
we	c
do	c
n't	c
need	c
to	c
wear	c
special	c
uniforms	c
.	c

When	c
it	c
goes	i
to	c
my	c
home	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
I	c
have	c
usual	i
duties	c
I	i
have	c
to	c
clean	c
my	c
room	c
,	c
wash	c
the	c
dishes	c
or	c
vacuum	c
the	c
carpets	c
,	c
but	c
they	c
're	c
not	c
exhausting	c
things	c
,	c
as	c
I	c
share	c
them	c
with	c
my	c
sister	c
and	c
brother	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
foreward	i
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c

CHANGE	i
SOME	c
OF	c
THE	c
ACTIVITIES	c
THAT	c
WE	i
WILL	i

?	c

WE	c
THINK	c
IS	i
A	c
GRATE	i
OPORTUNITY	i
,	c
BECAUSE	c
AS	c
YOU	c

WE	c
DO	c
N'T	c

KIND	c

AT	i

I	c
ASKED	c
A	c
BOY	c
AND	c
HE	c
SAID	c

AND	c
I	c
WAS	c

MORE	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Clark	c
,	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
express	c
my	c
opinion	c
about	c
it	c
and	c
give	c
you	c
some	c
suggestions	c
that	c
may	c
prove	c
to	c
be	c
useful	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
from	c
my	c
point	c
of	c
view	c
the	c
festival	c
itself	c
is	c
a	c
wonderful	c
idea	c
.	c

That	c
also	c
refers	i
to	i
the	c
weekend	c
ticket	c
you	c
offer	c
;	c
in	c
addition	c
to	c
being	c
rather	c
cheap	c
,	c
it	c
allowed	c
me	c
to	c
see	c
so	c
many	c
interesting	c
events	c
in	c
such	c
a	c
short	c
time	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
notice	i
that	c
the	c
festival	c
would	i
be	i
able	i
to	i
appeal	c
to	c
more	c
people	c
if	c
a	c
few	c
improvements	c
were	c
made	c
.	c

Actually	c
,	c
they	c
came	c
from	c
only	c
six	c
countries	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
really	c
happy	c
to	c
hear	c
from	c
you	c
again	c
.	c

We	c
are	c
supposed	c
not	c
to	c
be	c
late	c
for	c
the	i
lessons	c
and	c
,	c
of	c
course	c
,	c
students	c
must	c
n't	c
smoke	c
at	c
school	c
.	c

What	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
change	c
at	c
school	c
is	c
that	c
the	c
breaks	c
are	c
too	c
short	c
!	c

Santiago	c
,	c
June	c
17th	c
,	c
200	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

When	c
we	c
entrance	i
the	c
place	c
our	c
problems	c
begun	i
.	c

Then	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
had	c
a	c
great	c
delay	c
,	c
almost	c
an	c
hour	c
,	i
we	c
deal	i
with	c
that	c
too	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
so	c
impressed	c
the	i
exhibitions	c
of	i
the	c
festival	c
that	c
you	c
had	i
organized	i
.	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
it	c
's	c
worthful	i
experience	c
for	c
people	c
to	i
know	c
the	i
other	c
countries	c
'	c
arts	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
it	c
is	i
better	c
to	c
invite	c
more	c
artists	c
not	i
only	i
from	i
six	i
countries	i
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
some	c
concert	c
halls	c
were	c
too	c
small	c
to	c
enter	i
all	c
of	c
the	c
audience	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
plays	c
and	c
films	c
were	c
shown	c
only	c
twice	c
a	c
day	c
so	c
that	c
people	c
had	i
gathered	i
one	i
time	i
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
regards	i
to	i
tickets	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
very	i
wonderful	c
idea	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
more	c
combinient	i
to	c
enjoy	c
the	c
festival	c
for	c
one	c
day	c
among	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
people	c
.	c

Then	i
there	i
was	c
a	c
lovely	c
baby	c
in	c
it	c
.	c

She	c
grew	c
very	c
quick	i
and	c
was	c
so	c
beautiful	c
.	c

The	c
old	c
man	c
and	c
woman	c
tried	c
to	c
keep	i
her	c
staying	i
their	i
house	c
,	c
but	c
they	c
could	c
n't	c
.	c

Dear	c
Manager	c

In	c
addition	c
,	c
when	c
I	c
entered	c
into	i
the	c
theatre	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
have	c
discount	i
in	c
spite	c
of	c
student	i
and	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
use	c
in	i
your	c
restaurant	c
either	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

Anyway	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
"	c
My	c
perfect	c
Evening	c
out	c
"	c
but	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
kind	c
of	c
"	c
contract	c
infringement	c
"	c
so	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
for	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

How	c
has	c
modern	c
technology	c
changed	c
our	c
daily	c
life	c
?	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
the	c
developed	c
technology	c
and	c
science	c
will	c
make	c
our	c
life	c
more	c
convenient	c
than	c
now	c
.	c

All	c
your	c
stuffs	i
will	c
be	c
performed	c
by	c
the	i
computers	c
.	c

If	c
all	c
your	c
staffs	i
are	c
fulfilled	c
by	c
the	i
computers	c
,	c
we	c
might	c
be	c
idler	c
than	c
now	c
.	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
future	c
civilization	c
is	c
important	c
for	c
us	c
.	c

If	c
there	c
is	c
no	i
our	i
good	i
nature	i
,	i
our	c
daily	c
life	c
will	c
be	c
unhappy	c
.	c

I	c
went	c
to	c
see	c
'	c
over	i
the	i
rainbow	i
'	c
presented	i
by	c
the	c
circle	i
theater	i
.	c

It	c
said	c
it	c
will	i
start	c
at	c
19:30	c
.	c

Thirdly	c
the	c
ticket	c
was	c
no	i
discount	i
and	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
I	c
visited	c
theater	i
restaurant	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
close	i
because	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
too	i
late	c
.	c

(	i
Therefore	i
)	i
I	c
want	c
to	c
have	c
money	i
back	c
and	c
I	c
hope	c
you	c
will	c
think	c
about	c
these	c
problems	c
.	c

Your	i
faithfully	c

For	c
example	c
our	c
fashion	i
style	c
at	c
the	c
moment	c
is	i
comes	c
from	c
70's	c
fashion	c
.	c

in	c
future	i
.	c

Firstly	c
I	i
must	c
say	c
that	c
I	c
'll	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
have	c
two	c
weeks	c
free	c
only	c
in	c
July	c
,	c
since	c
I	c
started	i
work	c
and	c
intitled	i
to	c
have	c
a	c
holiday	c
only	c
in	c
July	c
.	c

As	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
champion	c
of	i
swimming	i
competition	c
in	c
Russia	c
in	c
1997	c
,	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
continue	c
to	c
practice	i
my	c
skills	c
.	c

Also	c
I	c
like	c
to	c
play	c
tennis	c
,	c
which	c
is	c
beautiful	i
"	c
game	c
"	c
itself	c
and	c
good	c
for	c
figure	i
.	c

Hope	c
to	c
hear	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

Sincerely	c
,	c
I	c
must	c
admit	c
,	i
that	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
like	c
shopping	c
in	c
supermarkets	c
and	c
big	c
stores	c
.	c

As	c
I	c
'm	c
not	c
keen	c
of	i
being	c
a	c
part	c
of	c
the	c
crowd	c
,	c
I	c
prefer	c
a	c
calm	c
atmosphere	c
in	c
more	c
isolated	c
small	c
shops	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
it	c
takes	c
too	c
long	c
to	c
find	c
something	c
you	c
need	c
in	c
unfamiliar	c
stores	c
.	c

Despite	c
I	i
like	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
nice	c
clothes	c
shops	c
I	c
usually	c
return	c
home	c
with	c
nothing	c
in	c
my	c
hands	c
,	c
as	c
prices	c
are	c
usually	c
to	i
high	c
,	c
unfortunately	c
not	i
affordable	i
for	i
me	i
.	c

Otherwise	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c

About	c
accomodation	i
,	c
I	c
prefer	c
stay	i
log	i
cabins	c
because	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
like	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
tents	c
which	c
are	c
unconfortable	i
for	c
me	c
.	c

This	i
prize	i
,	i
I	i
can	i
choose	i
two	i
activities	i
,	i
ca	i
n't	i
you	i
.	i

In	c
Japan	c
,	c
I	c
often	c
play	c
Golf	c
but	c
as	c
you	c
know	c
Japanese	c
weather	c
condition	i
is	i
not	c
enough	i
enjoying	i
play	i
Golf	c
but	i
California	c
has	c
good	c
weather	c
which	i
are	i
every	i
day	i
sunshuin	i
,	c
hopefuly	i
.	c

Finaly	i
,	c
I	c
have	c
some	c
question	i
.	c

I	c
have	c
a	i
big	c
news	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
know	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
big	i
fun	i
with	i
"	c
The	c
Max	c
"	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
so	c
happy	c
.	c

They	c
teached	i
me	c
paticulaly	i
.	c

Now	c
,	c
I	c
able	i
to	c
use	c
sound	i
effect	c
system	c
.	c

Of	c
course	c
,	c
I	c
could	c
enjoy	c
this	c
concert	c
,	c
as	c
well	c

Hellow	i
!	c

Of	c
course	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
joke	c
,	c
but	c
as	c
I	c
have	c
chosen	c
swimming	c
and	c
surfing	c
I	c
will	c
tell	c
you	c
why	c
.	c

And	c
only	i
out	i
of	i
that	i
reason	i
,	c
but	c
also	c
because	c
I	c
like	c
water	c
very	c
much	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
is	c
more	c
convinient	i
than	c
seven	c
lessons	c
every	c
day	c
and	c
each	c
of	c
the	c
lessons	c
lasts	c
fourty	i
five	i
minutes	c
.	c

As	c
a	c
student	c
of	i
economical	i
form	c
I	c
think	c
I	c
should	c
tell	c
you	c
about	c
one	c
day	c
in	c
time	i
table	i
of	c
our	c
form	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
Tuesday	c
.	c

Not	c
only	c
these	c
subjects	c
are	c
studied	c
by	c
us	c
,	c
but	c
also	c
Latin	c
,	c
Russian	c
,	c
Ukrainian	c
,	c
Biology	c
and	c
Phisical	i
training	c
,	c
but	c
as	c
we	c
study	c
them	c
we	c
understand	c
that	c
they	c
are	c
not	c
so	c
important	c
as	c
our	c
main	c
subjects	c
.	c

I	c
have	i
spent	i
two	c
days	c
at	c
the	c
International	c
Arts	c
Festival	c
with	c
some	c
of	c
my	c
friend	i
and	c
I	c
must	c
say	c
we	c
realy	i
delighted	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
great	i
idea	c
to	c
do	c
that	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

We	c
all	c
liked	c
Jazz	i
,	c
rock	c
and	c
classical	c
concerts	c
.	c

One	c
reasonably	i
priced	i
weeker	i
ticket	c
for	c
all	c
events	c
was	c
excellent	c
because	c
its	i
alway	i
busy	c
for	i
the	c
weekend	c
and	c
people	c
prefer	c
to	c
go	c
any	c
week	i
day	i
.	c

It	c
was	c
very	c
nice	c
to	c
hearing	i
from	c
you	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
countries	i
school	i
we	c
are	c
not	c
allowed	c
to	c
have	c
an	c
argument	c
with	c
class-mates	i
and	c
not	i
allowed	c
to	c
eat	c
at	i
class	c
.	c

Firstly	c
I	i
've	i
to	c
keep	c
clean	i
my	i
room	i
and	c
hoover	c
once	c
a	c
week	c
.	c

I	i
've	i
to	c
cook	c
myself	i
and	c
worst	i
thing	c
is	c
I	c
'm	c
not	c
allowed	c
to	c
listen	c
loud	i
music	c
in	i
everywhere	i
at	c
home	c
.	c

Love	i
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

This	c
year	c
,	c
our	c
English	c
class	c
has	c
decided	c
to	c
make	c
a	c
short	c
video	c
about	c
daily	c
life	c
at	c
our	c
school	c
.	c

(	c
It	c
is	c
a	c
graduate	c
engineer	i
school	c
where	c
we	c
are	c
studying	c
mecanics	i
and	c
energetics	i
.	c
)	c

On	i
one	i
hand	i
,	c
we	c
should	c
be	c
interested	c
in	c
the	c
lessons	c
.	c

That	c
seems	c
to	c
be	c
quite	c
surprising	c
,	c
yet	c
this	c
teacher	c
manages	c
to	c
convey	c
his	c
knowledge	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
absolutely	i
not	c
like	i
you	c
described	c
!	c

First	c
,	c
there	c
was	c
a	c
big	c
late	i
about	i
the	c
time	i
.	c

To	i
make	i
matter	i
worse	i
,	c
we	c
have	c
never	c
had	c
the	c
oppurtunity	i
to	c
see	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
because	c
,	c
instead	c
,	c
there	c
was	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
!	c

How	c
can	c
you	c
explain	c
that	c
big	c
mistake	c
?	c

At	i
the	i
top	i
of	i
everything	i
,	c
you	c
proposed	i
us	c
to	c
visit	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

How	c
could	c
we	c
visit	c
this	c
place	c
,	i
if	c
it	c
is	c
not	c
open	c
?	c
!	c

I	c
spent	c
£	c
20	c
-	c
and	c
not	i
as	c
you	c
wrote	c
"	i
discount	c
available	c
"	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
,	i
you	c
will	c
agree	c
and	c
share	c
my	c
disappointement	i
.	c

Fashion	c
of	c
the	c
Future	c

What	i
's	i
about	c

years	c

Another	i
very	c
important	c
point	c

So	c
small	c
that	c
I	c
can	c
imagine	i
,	c
they	c
will	c
be	c
introduce	i
(	c
maybe	c
like	c
chips	c
)	c
in	i
our	c
clothes	c

I	c
think	c
at	i

"	c
Internet	i

I	c
'm	c
shure	i
that	c
is	c
not	c
impossible	c
!	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
with	c
a	c
request	c
for	c
a	c
change	c
in	c
the	c
scedule	i
of	c
our	c
trip	c
to	c
London	c
.	c

Everything	c
seams	c
very	c
interesting	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
sure	c
that	c
we	c
will	c
all	c
have	c
a	c
very	c
good	c
time	c
.	c

That	c
's	c
because	c
the	c
"	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
"	c
takes	c
place	c
that	c
date	i
in	c
London	c
.	c

This	c
is	c
my	c
nature	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
to	c
see	c
how	c
far	c
I	c
could	c
go	c
this	c
time	c
or	c
,	c
to	c
be	c
more	c
specific	c
,	c
how	c
high	c
!	c

I	c
did	c
n't	c
hesitate	c
much	c
.	c

When	c
the	c
time	c
for	c
the	c
jump	c
came	c
I	c
had	c
some	c
second	c
thoughts	c
.	c

It	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
because	c
for	i
students	i
it	i
's	i
free	i
.	c

Thank	c
you	c

Think	i
people	c
's	c
homes	c
will	c
be	c
different	c
in	c
the	c
future	i
about	i
the	i
new	i
materials	i
of	i
structures	i
,	c
they	c
will	c
have	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
computers	c
for	c
doing	i
recipes	i
and	c
making	i
shopping	i
while	c
you	c
are	c
staying	i
at	c
home	c
.	c

The	c
home	c
of	c
the	c
future	c
will	c
be	c
very	c
impersonally	i
and	c
the	c
atmosfear	i
will	c
be	c
cold	c
and	c
very	c
essencial	i
.	c

We	c
feel	c
ca	i
n't	c
wait	c
until	c
that	c
time	c
.	c

I	c
believe	c
that	c
everyone	c
in	c
this	c
world	c
have	i
curiosity	c
.	c

Famous	c
people	c
are	c
also	c
the	i
normal	c
people	c
like	c
us	i
just	i
because	c
their	c
jobs	i
are	i
known	i
by	c
every	i
people	i
,	c
it	c
does	c
n't	c
mean	c
that	c
we	c
can	c
invade	c
their	c
privacy	c
.	c

They	c
also	c
want	c
to	c
have	c
special	i
time	c
with	c
their	c
family	c
or	c
their	c
friends	c
.	c

But	c
it	c
does	c
n't	c
mean	c
that	c
they	c
have	c
to	c
follow	c
these	c
stars	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
,	i
they	i
should	c
give	c
them	c
some	c
privacy	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
these	c
stars	c
should	c
accept	c
that	c
they	c
are	c
famous	c
people	c
so	c
everyone	c
wants	c
to	c
know	c
about	c
their	c
life	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sirs	c
,	c

According	c
to	c
your	c
advertisement	c
,	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
stars	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
be	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
.	c

I	c
expect	c
a	c
full	c
refund	c
plus	c
compensation	c
for	c
my	c
dissatisfaction	c
and	c
discomfort	i
which	c
I	c
suffered	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
receiving	c
your	c
response	c
within	c
the	c
next	c
seven	c
days	c
.	c

In	i
these	i
days	c
,	c
young	c
people	c
prefer	c
wearing	c
shabby	c
and	c
scruffy	c
clothes	c
to	c
wearing	c
neat	c
and	c
tidy	c
clothes	c
.	c

In	c
general	c
,	c
their	c
parents	c
do	c
n't	c
like	c
their	c
fashion	c
.	c

They	c
want	c
their	c
children	c
to	c
wear	c
clothes	i
neatly	i
.	c

When	c
they	c
were	c
young	c
,	c
they	c
judged	c
the	i
other	i
person	c
by	c
his	c
appearance	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
people	c
noticed	i
that	c
what	c
is	c
important	c
is	c
not	c
their	c
clothes	c
but	c
their	c
mind	c
.	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
people	c
can	i
wear	c
clothes	c
more	c
freely	i
,	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
.	c

What	c
is	c
important	c
is	c
not	c
their	c
fashion	c
but	c
their	i
knowledge	i
,	i
attitude	i
to	i
everthing	i
including	i
fashion	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
express	c
the	c
deserve	i
of	c
all	c
students	i
in	c
my	c
class	c
to	c
visit	c
the	c
LONDON	c
FASHION	c
AND	c
LEISURE	c
SHOW	c
at	c
Central	i
Exhibition	c
Hall	c
,	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
14	c
March	c
.	c

especially	c
the	c
part	c
of	i
the	c
Latest	c
Fashions	c
,	c
because	c
is	i
something	c
which	c
affect	i
the	i
people	c
of	c
all	c
ages	c
today	c
.	c

Leisure	c
and	c
Sports	c
Wear	c
is	c
very	c
interesting	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
young	c
people	c
are	c
affected	c
from	i
that	c
in	c
the	c
way	c
they	c
dressed	i
.	c

The	c
girls	c
are	c
interesting	i
more	i
than	c
boys	c
,	i
For	i
make	i
up	i
and	c
hairstyle	i
.	i

I	c
know	c
that	c
for	c
Tuesday	c
14	c
March	c
you	c
have	c
already	c
organise	i
the	c
programme	c
which	i
including	i
for	c
morning	i
a	c
visit	c
to	c
Science	i
Museum	c
and	c
For	c
afternoon	i
shopping	c
but	c
we	c
can	c
change	c
that	c
as	c
Follows	c
:	c

I	c
am	i
apologise	c
For	c
any	c
incovenience	i
.	i

and	c
I	c
am	c
waiting	c
for	c
your	c
reply	c
.	c

To	c
conclude	c
journalists	c
should	c
doing	i
their	c
work	c
but	c
without	c
annoyance	i
to	i
the	i
other	c
people	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
be	c
in	c
tents	i
,	c
because	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
funnier	i
and	c
you	c
can	c
be	i
in	i
more	c
contact	c
with	c
nature	c
,	i
but	i
if	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
like	c
the	c
tents	c
can	c
I	c
change	c
my	c
mind	c
?	c

You	c
told	c
me	c
to	c
choose	c
2	c
activities	c
and	c
I	c
chose	c
surfing	c
and	c
singing	c
.	c

I	c
did	c
a	c
surf	i
course	c
last	c
summer	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
gone	c
to	c
singing	c
lessons	c
almost	c
all	c
my	c
life	c
.	c

Looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c

ENGLISH	c
:	c
the	c
classroom	c
is	c
beautifull	i
,	c
and	c
in	i
the	c
same	c
day	c
we	c
do	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
diferents	i
activities	c
,	c
so	c
it	c
wo	c
n't	c
be	c
boring	c
watching	c
it	c
because	c
we	c
can	c
have	c
a	c
great	c
time	c
there	c
.	c

We	c
could	c
film	c
it	c
and	c
produce	c
it	c
,	i
instead	i
of	c
uniform	i
we	c
could	c
wear	c
costumes	c
,	i
the	i
ones	c
that	i
are	c
animals	c
could	c
pain	i
their	c
faces	c
.	c

Those	c
three	c
classes	c
are	c
my	c
choises	i
,	i
I	c
hope	c
we	c
could	i
do	c
them	c
and	c
make	c
a	c
very	c
good	c
video	c
about	c
our	c
school	c
.	c

I	c
also	c
wanted	c
to	c
visit	c
the	c
Theatre	c
Restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
but	c
it	i
was	c
impossible	c
because	c
it	c
closed	c
at	c
20:30	c
and	c
the	c
show	c
finished	c
at	c
21:00	c

I	c
would	c
not	c
like	c
to	c
take	c
legal	c
action	c
,	c
as	c
it	c
would	c
not	c
be	c
convenient	c
for	c
both	i
of	c
us	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
will	c
if	c
I	c
consider	c
it	c
necessary	c
.	c

We	c
were	c
at	c
school	c
when	c
she	c
told	c
me	c
this	c
and	c
Mr	c
Smythe	c
went	c
to	c
our	c
class	c
and	c
said	c
to	c
me	c
"	i
May	c
I	c
talk	c
to	c
you	c
?	c
"	c

Dear	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
I	c

made	i
an	c
arrangement	c
with	c
my	c
boss	c
about	c
my	c
free	c
days	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
sleep	c
in	c
an	i
log	c
cabin	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
not	c
just	i
to	c
sleeping	c
in	c
an	i
tent	c

I	c
think	c
it	c

The	c
two	c
activities	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
choose	c
are	c
:	i

Photography	i
I	i
never	i
realy	i

would	c
have	c
liked	c
very	i
much	c
.	c

Every	c
artist	c
could	c
scream	c
at	c
me	c
whenever	c
they	c
wanted	c
.	c

What	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
they	c
shoot	i
wear	c
.	c

And	c
of	c
course	c
I	c
immediately	c
said	c
Yes	i
!	c
!	c

Mabey	i
next	c
time	c
you	c
can	c
come	c
with	c
me	i
that	i
would	c
be	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
fun	c
.	c

Indeed	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
surprise	i
to	c
ear	i
when	c
I	c
asked	c
for	c
a	c
discount	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
possible	c
to	c
have	i
one	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
,	c

Especially	i
,	c
sightseeing	i
by	c
bus	c
must	i
be	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
,	c
students	c
can	c
go	c
without	c
paying	c
any	c
fees	c
.	c

We	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
show	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
afternoon	c
,	c
instead	c
of	c
shopping	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
be	c
grateful	c
,	i
if	c
you	c
could	c
understand	i
our	c
concern	c
and	c
change	c
the	c
programme	c
on	c
14th	c
of	c
March	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	i
,	c

Do	c
they	c
have	c
to	c
give	c
up	c
their	c
private	c
lives	c
?	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
also	c
said	c
that	c
their	c
private	c
lives	c
must	c
not	c
be	c
intruded	c
,	i
as	c
they	c
are	c
the	c
same	c
as	c
us	c
,	c
human	c
beings	c
.	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
although	c
I	c
think	c
they	c
ought	c
to	c
abondone	i
their	c
lives	c
partly	c
when	c
they	c
entre	i
the	c
world	c
of	c
fame	c
,	c
they	c
should	c
take	c
some	c
actions	i
against	c
journalists	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
protect	c
their	c
human	c
rights	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

Then	i
,	i
I	c
read	c
the	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
show	c
of	i
your	c
theatre	c
and	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
see	c
it	c
.	c

At	c
the	c
bottom	c
of	c
the	c
advertisement	c
was	c
wrote	i
:	c

Your	i

I	c
also	c
think	c
I	c
am	c
lucky	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
live	c
in	c
a	c
period	c
of	c
tecnologic	i
boom	c
.	c

At	i
the	c
present	c
day	c
,	c
for	c
ecsample	i
,	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
people	c
have	c
a	c
personal	c
computer	c
at	c
home	c
,	c
and	c
a	c
very	c
big	i
part	i
of	c
that	i
have	i
also	i
internet	i
,	c
the	c
new	c
frontier	c
of	c
computers	i
evolution	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
in	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
new	c
tecnology	i
has	c
changed	c
,	c
is	c
changeing	i
and	c
will	c
change	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c

I	c
hope	c
that	c

WELL	c

12th	c
December	c
2000	c

Dear	c
Mister	i
Robertson	c
,	c

The	c
whole	c
class	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
the	c
good	c
programm	i
,	i
which	c
you	c
have	c
organised	c
for	c
our	c
trip	c
to	c
London	c
.	c

The	c
reason	c
why	c
I	c
'm	c
writting	i
to	c
you	c
is	c
the	c
class	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
seen	c
an	c
advertisment	i
for	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
March	i
14	c
from	c
10.00	c
am	c
-	c
19.00	i
p.m.	c
It	c
is	c
a	c
show	c
about	c
latest	i
fashions	c
,	c
leisure	c
and	c
sports	i
wear	i
,	c
make	i
up	i
and	c
hairstyles	c
.	c

Instead	c
of	c
a	c
shopping	c
tour	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
afternoon	c
we	i
could	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
show	c
and	c
do	c
the	c
shopping	c
on	c
Wedensday	i
afternoon	c
in	c
our	c
free	c
time	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
next	c
few	c
years	c
the	i
people	c
's	c
home	i
will	c
be	c
changes	i
a	c
lot	c
.	c

First	i
point	c
we	i
will	c
use	c
more	c
often	c
new	c
technologies	c
like	c
telecommunication	i
or	c
internet	i
.	c

You	c
can	c
open	c
and	c
close	c
the	c
windows	c
and	c
switch	c
the	c
light	c
on	c
and	c
off	c
.	c

Or	c
never	i
living	i
the	c
office	c
you	i
are	c
able	c
to	c
heat	c
the	c
wather	i
for	c
a	c
hot	c
bath	c
.	c

But	c
the	c
form	c
and	c
the	c
rooms	c
of	c
a	c
building	c
will	c
still	c
be	c
the	c
same	c
.	c

The	c
show	c
started	c
forty-five	c
minutes	c
later	i
and	c
this	c
really	c
disappointed	c
me	c
.	c

Besides	c
,	c
when	c
I	c
bought	c
the	c
ticket	c
,	c
I	c
found	c
out	c
there	c
was	i
not	c
discounts	i
for	c
ticket	i
,	c
while	c
you	c
wrote	c
the	c
contrary	c
.	c

Definetely	i
,	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
very	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
appreciate	c
your	i
if	c
it	c
was	i
possible	c
to	c
have	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

All	c
her	c
friends	c
were	c
amazed	c
at	c
her	i
change	i
and	c
started	c
trusting	c
her	c
at	c
once	c
.	c

My	c
name	c
is	c
Gabriel	c
and	c
I	c
represented	i
our	c
class	c
.	c

We	c
have	c
seen	c
an	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
and	c
we	c
would	c
particularly	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

The	i
Monday	c
13	c
March	c
would	i
be	i
fine	i
.	c

The	c
morning	c
visiting	i
interesting	c
places	c
in	c
the	c
City	c
and	c
on	i
the	c
afternoon	c
make	i
a	c
trip	c
to	c
Greenwich	c
,	c
which	c
is	c
excellent	c
.	c

There	c
is	c
a	c
very	c
interesting	c
programme	c
for	c
young	c
people	c
like	c
we	i
.	c

It	c
will	i
be	i
beutiful	i
if	c
you	c
would	c
agree	c
to	c
change	c
your	c
plan	c
.	c

It	c
happened	c
on	c
a	c
very	c
lovly	i
day	c
in	c
summer	c
.	c

Suddenly	c
I	c
heart	i
somebody	c
crying	c
for	c
the	i
help	c
.	c

I	c
knew	c
,	i
I	c
ca	i
n't	i
swimm	i
then	i
I	c
realized	c
it	c
might	c
be	c
dangerous	c
for	c
me	c
as	c
well	c
.	c

But	c
in	i
this	c
particular	c
moment	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
important	c
for	i
me	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
travel	c
only	c
in	c
july	i
because	c
that	c
is	c
the	c
only	c
time	c
when	c
I	c
am	c
free	c
from	c
my	c
examinations	c
.	c

I	c
prefer	c
staying	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
as	c
I	c
am	c
used	c
to	c
it	c
and	c
find	c
it	c
more	c
comfortable	c
.	c

The	c
two	c
activities	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
do	c
in	c
the	c
camp	c
are	c
swimming	c
and	c
photography	c
.	c

How	c
much	c
money	c
and	c
clothes	i
should	c
I	c
take	c
with	c
me	c
?	c

The	c
main	c
job	c
of	c
the	c
head	c
of	c
the	c
computing	c
department	c
is	c
not	c
to	c
teach	c
but	c
to	c
keep	c
the	c
computers	c
working	c
properly	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
chemistry	c
lab	c
experiments	c
are	c
often	c
set	c
up	c
.	c

The	c
teacher	c
looks	c
after	c
the	c
pupil	i
while	c
they	c
are	c
investigating	c
the	c
topic	c
of	c
the	c
lesson	c
.	c

Meals	c
are	c
very	c
important	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
this	c
letter	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
make	c
some	c
suggestions	c
for	c
the	c
International	c
Arts	c
Festival	c
that	c
took	c
place	c
a	c
while	c
ago	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
there	c
should	c
more	i
stars	c
and	c
artists	c
from	c
more	c
countries	c
because	c
this	c
year	c
,	c
I	c
believe	c
there	c
were	c
artists	c
only	i
from	i
six	c
countries	c
which	c
,	c
in	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
is	c
not	c
quite	c
from	c
all	c
over	c
the	c
world	c
.	c

I	c
,	c
myself	c
,	c
was	c
expecting	c
a	c
more	c
expensive	c
ticket	c
as	c
there	c
were	c
so	c
many	c
magnificient	i
events	c
.	c

Well	c
,	c
I	c
hope	c
you	c
found	c
my	c
suggestions	c
reasonable	c
as	c
I	c
deeply	c
congratulate	c
for	i
the	c
great	c
sucess	i
in	i
the	c
festival	c
.	c

yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

Dear	c
Emily	c
,	c

You	c
must	c
have	c
a	i
permission	c
to	c
get	c
out	c
of	c
your	c
seat	c
or	c
leave	c
the	c
classroom	c
.	c

I	c
miss	c
you	c
and	c
let	c
's	c
keep	c
in	c
touch	c
.	c

Bye.	c

June	c
13th	c
,	c
2000	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
delighted	c
and	c
already	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
spending	c
two	c
weeks	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
in	c
the	c
U.S.A.	c
.	i

As	c
regards	c
the	c
time	c
that	c
I	c
can	c
travel	c
I	i
must	c
tell	c
you	c
that	c
my	c
holidays	c
at	c
university	c
are	c
only	c
in	c
July	c
.	c

Then	i
you	c
asked	c
to	i
chose	i
two	c
activities	c
from	c
the	c
list	c
you	c
sent	c
to	c
me	c
.	c

Firstly	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
will	c
be	c
appropriate	c
for	c
the	c
camp	c
,	c
secondly	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
should	c
take	c
with	c
me	c
for	c
the	c
two	c
weeks	c
and	c
lastly	c
if	c
there	c
are	c
any	c
possibilies	i
for	c
cooking	c
.	c

yours	i
sincerely	c
,	c

The	c
next	c
stressful	c
factor	c
begins	c
in	c
the	c
shop	c
:	i
Everywhere	c
people	c
who	c
are	c
in	c
a	c
hurry	c
and	i
push	c
you	c
from	c
one	c
side	c
to	c
the	c
other	c
.	c

And	c
if	c
you	c
are	c
not	c
quick	c
enough	c
they	c
wo	c
n't	c
leave	c
anything	i
left	i
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Clark	c
:	c

I	c
spent	i
a	c
good	c
time	c
in	i
the	c
jazz	c
,	c
rock	c
and	c
classical	c
concerts	c
in	c
spite	c
of	c
the	c
fact	c
that	c
some	c
concert	c
halls	c
were	c
too	c
small	c
.	c

The	c
rest	c
of	c
the	c
activities	c
were	c
very	c
interesting	c
for	c
us	c
,	c
we	c
learnt	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
things	c
and	c
we	c
met	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
interesting	c
people	c
,	c
and	c
all	c
of	c
this	c
without	c
being	c
expensive	c
,	i
I	c
think	c
that	c
ticket	i
was	c
exellent	i
for	c
us	c
because	c
of	c
its	c
price	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerelly	i

Dear	c
Andy	c
:	c

I	c
'm	c
sorry	c
I	c
have	c
n't	c
written	c
for	c
so	c
long	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
very	c
busy	c
with	c
my	c
exams	c
.	c

In	c
your	c
letter	c
you	c
told	i
me	c
something	c
about	c
rules	c
.	c

I	c
imagine	c
that	c
you	c
want	c
my	c
opinion	c
for	i
your	c
homework	c
?	c

The	c
other	c
day	c
I	c
arrived	c
five	c
minutes	c
late	c
and	c
the	c
teacher	c
ordered	c
me	c
to	c
go	c
home	c
.	c

She	c
might	c
be	c
crazy	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
seeing	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
already	c
read	c
the	c
programme	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
agree	i
with	i
that	i
,	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
the	c
class	c
will	c
like	c
going	c
to	i
Sightseeing	i
by	c
bus	c
and	c
in	c
the	c
afternoon	c
going	c
to	i
River	i
trip	c
to	c
Greenwich	c
,	i
Also	c
,	c
they	c
can	c
visit	c
Science	i
Museum	c
,	c
and	c
they	c
can	c
going	i
to	i
the	i
shopping	c
,	i
on	i
Wednesday	c
15	c
March	c
they	c
going	i

Finally	c

I	c
hope	c
that	c
you	c

my	c

opinion	c
about	c
the	c
programme	c

I	c
will	c
understand	c
accept	i
you	i

opinion	c
as	c
well	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c

from	c
you	c

sometimes	i
,	i
they	c
can	c
make	c
theirs	i
life	c
easier	c
than	c
they	i
normally	i
do	i

It	c
is	c
true	c
,	c
they	c

One	c
week	c
ago	c
I	c
watched	c
your	c
show	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
would	i
give	c
me	c
some	c
of	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
that	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
great	c
excuse	i
for	c
the	c
loss	i
of	c
time	c
and	c
my	c
dissopointness	i

When	c
Marine	c
was	c
three	c
years	c
old	c
a	c
man	c
came	c
to	c
their	c
house	c
and	c
sad	i
that	c
he	c
is	i
Marine	c
's	c
father	c
and	c
wont	i
to	c
take	c
her	c
.	i

and	c
he	c
added	c
that	c
he	c
leave	i
Marine	c
because	c
her	c
mother	c
was	i
dead	i
two	c
days	c
after	c
Marine	c
's	c
birth	c
.	i

and	c
the	c
police	c
thought	c
Marine	c
's	c
father	c
did	c
this	c
so	c
they	c
put	c
him	c
on	i
prison	i
he	i
had	c
nobody	c
that	c
he	c
can	i
give	c
marry	i
so	i
he	c
leave	i
her	c
on	i
their	c
garden	c

Marine	c
said	c
to	c
Pat	c
that	i
"	c
I	c
had	i
knowed	i
that	c
because	c
I	c
talked	i
with	i
my	c
real	c
father	c
every	c
month	c
but	c
my	c
parents	c
does	i
n't	i

for	c

you	c
which	i
are	i
some	i

I	c
would	c

from	c
my	c
company	c
from	c
1th	c
July	c
to	c
28th	c
July	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
tents	c

What	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
about	c
what	i

are	i
suit	c
the	c
season	c

U.S.A	c

Some	c
suggestion	i
to	c
make	c
a	c
video	c
about	c
daily	c
life	c
at	c
our	c
school	c
.	c

INTRODUCTION	c

According	c
to	c
reactions	i
of	c
students	c
.	c

They	i
are	i
joined	i
with	i
different	i
countries	i
and	i
with	i
good	i
teacher	i
.	i

The	c
point	c
of	c
"	c
upper	c
intermidiate	i
class	c
"	c
.	c

They	c
are	c
having	c
special	i
time	c
.	c

They	i
must	i
be	i
shown	i
the	i
most	i
well-class	i
in	i
our	i
school	i
.	i

My	c
ticket	c
was	c
for	c
19.30	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
started	c
very	c
late	c
,	i
it	i
started	c
20:15	i
.	c

When	c
the	c
show	c
finished	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
too	c
late	c
to	c
catch	c
the	c
train	c
to	i
home	c
.	c

"	c
What	c
a	c
waste	c
!	c
,	c
,	c
By	c
the	c
way	c
,	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
see	c
any	c
discounts	c
for	i
buying	i
tickets	c
.	c

Would	c
you	c
consider	c
to	i
give	i
my	i
money	c
back	c
?	c

If	c
the	i
refund	c
is	c
available	c
,	c
it	i
would	c
be	c
grateful	i
.	c

We	c
get	c
on	c
very	c
well	c
.	c

I	c
told	c
her	c
the	c
reason	c
that	i
I	c
had	c
to	c
miss	c
the	i
work	c
.	c

I	c
still	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
how	c
it	c
really	c
happens	i
to	c
him	c
.	c

All	c
I	c
know	c
is	c
about	i
drug	c
smuggling	c
,	c
that	i
he	c
involved	i
.	c

I	c
quickly	c
got	c
out	c
of	c
toilet	i
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
remember	c
how	c
I	c
finished	c
work	c
that	c
day	c
.	c

Everybody	c
make	i
mistakes	c
.	c

On	i
the	c
advertisement	c
it	c
had	i
been	i
written	c
that	c
there	i
would	i
have	i
been	i
Danny	i
Brook	i
too	c
.	c

I	c
have	i
waited	i
for	c
the	c
show	c
beginning	i
until	c
20:15	c
!	c
!	c
!	c
!	c

Is	i
it	i
a	i
correct	i
thing	i
?	c

So	c
,	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	i
to	c
have	c
a	c
good	c
meal	c
in	c
the	c
"	c
famous	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
"	c
(	c
that	i
,	c
of	c
course	c
,	c
was	c
closed	c
for	c
a	c
free	i
night	i
!	c
!	c
!	c
!	c
)	c

At	i
the	c
end	c
,	c
I	c
asked	c
for	c
money	i
back	c
(	c
and	c
paiment	i
for	c
my	c
orrible	i
night	c
)	c
:	c
do	c
you	c
think	c
anybody	c
give	i
me	c
back	i
something	i
?	c
!	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
attention	c
.	c

Science	c
and	c
technology	c
characterize	c
our	c
moder	i
society	c
.	c

We	c
have	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
technological	c
searches	i
have	c
taken	i
in	i
our	c
society	c
"	c
their	c
good	c
fruits	c
"	c
but	c
,	c
at	c
the	c
same	c
time	c
,	c
negative	i
aspects	c
too	c
.	c

I	c
know	c
I	c
'm	c
"	i
daughter	c
of	c
this	c
techological	i
world	c
"	c
and	c
unluckly	i
I	c
think	c
I	c
could'n	i
stay	i
without	c
it	c
:	c
it	c
's	c
rather	c
strange	c
that	c
today	c
there	c
's	c
already	i
somebody	c
without	c
phone	i
,	c
dishwasher	c
,	c
TV	c
...	c

But	c
,	c
sometimes	c
I	c
ask	c
myself	c
if	c
the	c
"	c
ancient	c
world	c
"	c
,	c
without	c
science	c
,	c
technological	c
discoveries	i
and	c
industries	c
was	c
more	c
authentic	c
than	c
the	i
our	c
one	c
.	c

It	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
for	c
us	c
,	c
because	c
we	c
are	c
all	c
interested	c
in	c
fashion	c
particularly	i
in	c
sports	i
wear	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
suggest	c
to	i
visit	i
the	c
Science	c
Museum	c
,	c
which	c
was	i
planned	i
for	i
Tuesday	c
,	c
on	c
Wednesday	c
afternoon	c
.	c

So	c
that	c
we	c
can	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
Fashion	c
Show	c
.	c

We	c
are	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
dangerous	c
but	c
I	c
knew	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
.	c

For	c
just	c
one	c
day	c
in	c
my	c
summer	c
holidays	c
I	c
planned	c
to	c
do	c
something	c
adventurous	c
.	c

The	c
moment	c
I	c
saw	c
the	c
advertisement	c
about	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
seven	i
world	i
wonders	i
,	c
I	c
knew	c
,	i
I	c
had	c
to	c
see	c
it	c
.	c

But	c
this	c
was	c
also	c
the	c
moment	c
when	c
my	c
nightmare	c
started	c
to	c
come	c
alive	i
.	c

One	i
man	c
came	c
out	c
from	c
a	c
small	c
building	c
.	c

He	c
introduced	c
himself	c
and	c
we	c
walked	c
towards	c
a	c
small	c
plane	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
horrible	c
.	c

I	c
'd	c
like	c
log	i
cabins	i
as	i
my	c
accomodation	i
,	c
because	c
it	c
's	c
safer	c
and	c
cleaner	c
than	c
tents	i
and	c
I	c
would	c
n't	c
share	c
it	c
to	i
anyone	c
.	c

They	c
fit	i
to	i
myself	i
because	c
my	c
art	c
work	c
develops	c
itself	i
in	c
these	c
areas	c
.	c

With	c
this	c
amount	c
I	c
could	c
buy	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
art	c
books	c
,	c
and	c
records	c
.	c

There	c
is	c
joy	c
in	c
shopping	c
when	c
it	c
is	c
made	i
by	c
ourselves	c
to	i
ourselves	c
.	c

What	c
we	c
like	c
is	c
based	c
in	i
our	c
relationship	i
to	i
another	i
people	c
,	c
in	i
the	i
work	c
or	c
in	c
the	c
family	c
.	c

So	c
we	c
have	c
enjoyable	i
when	c
we	c
buy	c
what	c
we	c
like	c
following	i
another	i
people	c
's	c
views	c
.	c

A	c
death	c
in	c
the	c
family	c
is	c
not	i
also	i
an	c
enjoyable	c
shopping	c
experience	c
,	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
the	i
highest	i
point	i
of	i
the	i
sickness	i
.	c

Buying	c
coffins	c
and	c
graveyards	i
to	c
bury	c
relatieves	i
is	c
not	c
as	c
enjoyable	c
as	c
buying	c
clothes	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
organising	c
the	c
International	c
Arts	c
Festival	c
,	c
in	c
which	c
I	c
participated	c
this	c
year	c
,	c
and	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
my	c
opinion	c
about	c
it	c
.	c

One	c
reasonably-priced	c
weekend	c
ticket	c
for	c
all	c
events	c
was	c
also	c
an	c
excellent	c
idea	c
.	c

All	c
the	c
concerts	c
were	c
great	c
,	c
but	c
some	c
concert	c
halls	c
were	c
too	c
small	c
.	c

There	c
was	c
a	c
terrible	c
lack	c
of	c
room	c
and	c
fresh	c
air	c
inside	c
them	c
.	c

I	c
trust	c
you	c
will	c
give	c
this	c
matter	c
your	c
great	i
attention	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
visiting	c
International	i
Arts	c
Festival	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mary	c
,	c

I	c
'm	c
sorry	c
for	c
not	c
having	c
written	c
earlier	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
've	c
had	c
an	c
exhausting	c
exam	c
session	c
at	c
school	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
!	c

We	c
were	c
lucky	c
to	c
get	c
tickets	c
to	c
the	c
,,Over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
"	c
show	c
in	c
your	c
theatre	c
.	c

Another	c
problem	c
-	c
we	c
were	c
very	c
hungry	c
that	c
evening	c
because	c
the	c
show	c
was	i
postpone	i
45	c
minutes	i
!	c
so	c
we	c
were	c
late	i
to	c
our	c
supper	c
in	c
the	c
hotel	c
and	i
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
also	c
closed	c
without	c
any	i
risons	i
.	c

In	c
the	c
advertisment	i
it	i
was	i
written	i
,,your	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
!	c
"	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
.	c

Industrial	i
weel	i
going	i
faster	i
and	i
faster	i
.	i

It	c
is	c
very	c
intresting	i
for	c
me	c
how	i
new	i
works	i
,	c
there	i
possiblyties	i
.	c

Communication	i
business	c
is	c
a	i
very	c
progressive	c
.	c

Mobile	c
communication	c
is	c
a	c
key	c
to	c
sucsess	i
in	c
all	c
professions	c
that	c
we	c
have	c
!	c

And	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
I	c
made	c
a	i
right	c
choice	c
in	i
the	i
profession	c
-	c
it	c
is	c
perfect	i
combination	c
:	c
very	i
progressiv	i
way	i
of	c
a	i
modern	c
technology	c
,	c
and	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
thing	c
-	c
it	c
is	c
extremly	i
interesting	c
for	i
me	c
!	c

You	c
ask	c
me	c
when	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
?	c

I	c
can	c
travel	c
only	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
I	c
have	i
holidays	i
from	i
my	i
work	i
only	i
in	c
this	c
month	c
.	c

So	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
very	c
nice	c
,	i
if	c
it	i
's	i
possible	c
.	c

Then	c
the	c
activities	c
that	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
do	c
are	c
Singing	i
and	c
Swimming	i
.	c

yours	c
faithfuly	i
,	c

But	c
shopping	c
is	c
n't	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
:	c
you	c
have	i
in	i
your	i
memory	i
a	c
great	c
pair	c
of	c
shoes	c
that	c
you	c
have	i
seen	i
last	c
week	c
in	c
a	c
shop	c
.	c

So	c
you	c
see	c
that	c
shopping	c
is	c
n't	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
about	c
an	c
annual	c
international	c
arts	c
festival	c
with	c
a	c
good	c
impression	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
spent	c
two	c
days	c
on	c
it	c
which	c
was	c
exciting	c
.	c

The	c
name	c
of	c
the	c
event	c
,	c
International	c
Arts	c
Festival	c
,	c
is	c
great	i
idea	c
actually	c
,	c
but	c
there	c
were	c
stars	c
and	c
artists	c
only	i
from	i
six	c
countries	c
apart	i
from	i
your	i
advertisement	i
.	c

I	c
suppose	c
more	c
countries	c
are	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
informed	c
even	c
during	c
and	c
after	c
the	c
events	c
.	c

The	c
second	c
point	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
make	c
is	c
about	c
the	c
concerts	c
which	c
showed	c
people	c
Jazz	c
,	c
rock	c
and	c
classic	i
,	i
which	c
were	c
fantastic	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
be	c
interested	c
in	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

But	c
it	c
is	c
quite	c
different	c
rather	c
than	c
you	c
.	c

I	i
think	i
the	i
rule	i
of	i
school	i
has	i
many	i
thing	i
stoping	i
students	i
doing	i
.	i

I	c
'm	c
writting	i
to	c
you	c
to	c
explain	c
my	i
problem	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
had	c
in	c
your	c
theatre	c
.	c

I	c
recentely	i
had	c
a	c
week	c
's	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
,	c
and	c
during	i
my	c
stay	c
,	c
I	c
went	c
in	i
your	c
theatre	c
to	c
see	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
because	c
I	c
have	i
seen	c
an	c
advertisement	c
about	i
this	c
show	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
really	c
interrested	i
to	i
see	i
it	c
for	c
many	c
reasons	c
,	c
one	c
of	c
this	i
reasons	c
it	i
is	c
that	c
I	c
love	c
the	c
starring	i
Danny	i
Brook	c
.	c

And	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
that	i
you	c
know	i
that	c
I	c
have	c
had	c
a	c
very	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
,	c
due	c
to	c
the	c
differences	c
between	c
the	c
advertisement	c
and	c
the	c
show	c
that	c
I	c
saw	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
visit	c
you	i
theatre	c
restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
already	c
closed	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
very	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
and	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
very	c
kind	c
of	c
you	c
if	c
you	c
give	i
me	c
back	c
the	c
money	c
.	i

I'am	i
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hear	i
you	i
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c
.	c

Your	i
faithfully	c
,	c

Why	c
not	c
.	i

Dear	c
Sir	i
,	c

First	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
congratulate	c
you	c
for	i
the	c
success	c
you	c
have	c
been	c
having	c
year	c
after	c
year	c
.	c

The	c
artists	c
you	c
brought	c
were	c
only	c
from	c
six	c
different	c
countries	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
think	c
you	i
should	i
next	i
time	i
try	c
to	c
offer	i
us	i
people	c
from	c
more	c
different	i
nationalities	c
,	c
to	c
make	c
it	c
more	c
interesting	c
than	c
it	c
is	c
already	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
just	i
would	i
like	c
to	c
recommend	i
you	c
not	c
to	c
give	c
up	c
showing	c
movies	c
,	i
during	c
the	c
Festival	i
because	c
the	c
crowds	c
were	c
amazed	i
with	c
that	i
,	c
and	c
keep	c
on	c
offering	c
the	c
current	c
prices	c
,	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
best	c
deal	i
for	c
us	c
,	c
the	c
spectators	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
talk	c
about	c
my	c
suggestions	c
,	c
please	c
,	c
do	c
not	c
hesitate	c
and	i
let	c
me	c
know	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	i
,	c

I	c
think	c
,	c
as	i
a	i
consecuence	i
,	c
that	c
there	c
is	c
no	c
difficulty	c
in	c
finding	c
a	c
job	c
for	c
our	c
spare	c
time	c
.	c

Next	c
year	c
I	c
expect	c
myself	i
finishing	i
my	c
studies	c
in	c
LAW	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
Why	i
do	c
n't	c
we	c
think	c
more	c
about	c
the	c
future	c
,	c
instead	c
of	c
being	c
upset	c
of	i
how	c
to	c
get	c
some	c
money	c
to	c
spend	i
next	i
party	c
?	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Manager	c

With	c
reference	c
to	c
the	c
show	c
last	c
week	c
.	i

I	c
realised	c
that	c
the	c
actor	c
was	c
n't	c
DANNY	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
quarter	i
of	c
an	c
hour	c
late	c
.	c

If	c
I	c
knew	i
that	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
late	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
ask	i
my	c
mom	c
to	c
come	c
with	c
me	c
,	c
because	c
her	c
working	c
hour	i
ended	c
at	c
eight	c
o'clock	c
.	c

The	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
ended	c
.	c

Your	i
sincerely	c

Thatt	c
Chitchee	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

As	c
a	c
result	c
Mallory	c
had	c
been	c
arrested	c
by	c
the	c
police	c
two	c
years	c
ago	c
.	c

The	c
story	c
began	c
in	c
1989	c
in	c
New	c
York	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

I	c
was	c
having	c
a	c
week	c
's	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
when	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
and	c
see	c
a	c
musical	c
show	i
.	c

I	c
had	c
read	c
your	c
advertisement	c
in	c
a	c
morning	i
newspaper	c
and	c
the	c
show	c
seemed	c
very	c
attractive	c
to	c
me	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
there	c
were	c
no	c
discounts	c
available	c
as	i
stated	i
in	c
your	c
advertisement	c
,	c
not	c
even	c
for	c
students	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
pay	c
for	c
a	c
full-price	c
ticket	c
.	c

At	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
have	c
dinner	c
in	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
and	c
I	c
went	c
there	c
.	c

Looking	c
forward	c
to	c
receiving	c
your	c
reply	c
very	c
soon	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

At	c
that	c
time	c
,	c
I	c
used	c
to	c
buy	c
a	c
lotery	i
ticket	c
once	c
a	c
week	c
and	c
I	c
sometimes	c
won	c
small	c
amounts	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
was	c
too	c
excited	c
to	c
keep	c
it	c
secret	c
so	c
I	c
told	c
Pat	c
that	c
I	c
had	c
won	c
a	c
prize	c
for	c
five	c
correct	c
numbers	c
and	c
had	c
her	c
swear	c
not	c
to	c
tell	c
anyone	c
.	c

SO	c
I	c
told	c
my	c
friend	c
Pat	c
how	c
much	c
I	c
had	c
won	c
and	c
the	c
following	c
day	c
at	c
school	c
,	i
everybody	c
were	i
just	c
the	c
same	c
as	c
they	c
ever	c
were	c
with	c
me	c
...	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
,	c

Thank	c
you	c
.	c

With	c
this	c
letter	c
I	c
would	c
ask	i
you	c
if	c
you	c
wuld	i
change	c
it	c
because	c
we	c
saw	c
in	c
the	c
London	c
Advertiser	c
an	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
.	c

The	c
Show	i
is	c
Tuesday	i
,	c
March	c
14th	c
from	i
10.00-19.00	c
in	c
the	c
Central	c
Exibition	i
Hall	c
.	c

We	c
all	c
think	c
that	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
good	c
opportunity	c
to	c
see	c
this	c
show	c
.	c

We	c
are	c
young	c
and	c
we	c
all	i
are	i
interested	c
in	c
fashion	c
.	c

For	i
the	i
students	i
it	i
is	i
free	i
.	c

Yours	c
sincierly	i
,	c

It	c
was	c
dangerous	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
knew	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
.	c

He	c
was	c
playing	c
with	c
fire	c
and	c
alcohol	c
in	c
the	c
bathroom	c
.	c

My	c
first	c
reaction	c
was	c
to	c
put	i
him	c
on	c
the	c
floor	c
so	c
that	c
the	c
fire	c
could	c
stop	i
.	c

I	c
called	c
a	c
taxi	c
because	c
my	c
father	c
was	c
n't	c
able	c
to	c
drive	c
.	c

Since	c
that	c
bad	c
experience	c
he	c
never	i
playied	i
with	c
fire	c
again	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
,	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
your	c
programme	c
,	c
it	i
's	i
sounds	c
very	c
interesting	c
and	c
everybody	c
is	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
it	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
we	c
do	c
all	c
have	c
a	c
request	c
to	c
ask	i
you	c
.	c

This	c
show	c
is	c
going	c
on	c
all	c
day	c
on	c
March	c
14th	c
.	c

As	c
teenagers	c
we	c
're	c
all	c
very	c
keen	c
on	c
fashion	c
so	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
to	c
go	c
because	c
in	c
our	c
countryside	i
,	c
we	c
'll	c
never	c
get	c
a	c
chance	c
to	c
see	c
a	c
show	c
like	c
that	c
.	c

Anyway	c
,	c
as	c
students	c
we	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
much	c
money	c
to	c
spend	c
on	c
shopping	c
and	c
the	c
good	c
thing	c
is	c
that	c
it	c
wo	c
n't	c
affect	c
your	c
budget	c
at	c
all	c
as	c
the	c
entrance	c
fees	c
are	c
free	c
for	c
students	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

Why	i
medias	i
are	i
so	c
interesting	i
in	c
famous	c
people	c
?	c

Because	c
of	c
us	c
!	c

Would	c
you	c
like	c
to	c
live	c
a	c
life	c
like	c
that	c
,	c
every	c
time	c
you	c
make	c
a	c
wrong	c
step	c
,	c
the	c
whole	c
world	c
is	c
looking	c
at	c
you	c
,	c
judging	c
you	c
.	i

I	c
had	c
a	c
horrible	c
evening	c
,	c
just	c
the	c
opposite	c
of	c
what	c
I	c
expected	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
want	c
my	c
money	c
back	c

THE	c
BIG	c
FAULT	i

Rod	c
was	c
a	c
happy	c
man	c
at	c
that	c
times	i
.	c

Just	c
then	c
,	c
the	c
strange	c
man	c
took	c
out	c
his	c
gun	c
.	c

He	c
then	i
was	i
killed	c
by	c
the	c
other	c
man	c
who	c
escaped	c
that	c
day	c
and	c
was	c
caught	c
soon	c
afterwards	c
.	c

And	c
these	c
lines	c
writes	i
on	c
his	c
gravestone	c
:	c

This	c
is	c
why	c
poor	c
Rod	c
died	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

The	c
idea	c
about	i
going	c
to	c
California	c
for	c
2	c
weeks	c
make	i
me	c
feel	c
very	c
excited	c
.	c

According	i
with	i
your	c
letter	c
,	c
July	c
is	c
the	c
period	i
of	i
time	c
suits	i
me	c
best	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
swimming	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
.	c

But	c
not	c
everything	c
about	c
shopping	c
is	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
I	c
hate	c
when	i
I	c
get	c
into	c
a	c
shopping	c
centre	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
crowded	c
.	c

But	c
from	c
another	c
point	c
of	c
view	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
silly	c
to	c
be	c
earning	c
money	c
and	c
do	i
n't	i
spend	i
it	c
as	c
you	c
want	c
.	c

Thank	i
's	i
for	c
accept	i
me	c
in	c
the	c
competition	c
.	c

I	c
hear	c
that	c
the	c
competition	c
there	c
are	i
very	c
good	i
,	c
and	c
the	i
Camp	c
California	c
is	c
very	c
famous	c
for	c
his	i
competitions	c
.	c

Another	c
thing	c
is	c
my	c
accommodation	c
I	i
prefer	c
to	c
have	c
log	c
cabins	c
because	c
it	c
's	c
easyeast	i
for	c
me	c
.	c

Thanks	c
for	c
all	i
,	c
and	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
there	c
the	i
next	c
month	c
.	c

I	c
like	c
to	c
shop	c
sometimes	c
but	c
not	c
always	c
and	c
not	i
spending	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
money	c
on	c
things	c
that	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
really	c
need	c
.	c

Your	c
Friend	c

With	c
reference	c
to	c
the	c
letter	c
from	c
you	c
.	i

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
inform	c
some	i
further	c
information	c
as	i

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
much	c
about	c
there	i
,	i
is	i
there	c
anything	c
should	i
I	i
bring	c

Because	c
I	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c

Most	c
people	c
believe	c
that	c
shopping	c
is	c
the	c
most	c
entertaining	c
way	i
.	c

If	c
you	c
have	c
chilldren	i
,	c
you	c
will	c
know	c
it	i
very	c
well	c
when	i
you	c
are	c
busy	c
doing	c
something	c
and	c
the	c
chilldren	i
see	c
something	c
they	c
want	c
to	c
have	c
,	c
they	c
will	c
do	c
everything	c
they	c
can	c
do	c
to	c
make	c
you	c
buy	c
it	c
for	c
them	c
,	c
sometime	i
they	c
even	c

My	c
name	c
is	c
Furilo	c
J.M.	c
and	c
last	c
month	c
I	c
spent	c
a	c
few	c
days	c
in	c
London	c
,	i
I	c
visited	c
you	i
theatre	c
.	c

The	c
reason	c
I	c
'm	c
writting	i
this	c
letter	c
for	i
you	c
is	c
that	c
in	i
my	c
staying	i
in	c
London	c
I	c
felt	c
very	c
disappointed	c
about	c
your	c
theatre	c
.	c

I	c
arrived	c
there	c
at	c
19:00	c
and	c
the	c
show	c
began	c
only	i
20:15	i
.	c

I	c
think	c
I	c
can	c
forgive	i
your	i
theatre	i
,	i
only	i
if	c
you	c
give	c
me	c
a	c
refund	c
of	c
the	c
money	c
I	c
spent	c
there	c
,	c
and	c
some	c
other	i
more	c
for	c
all	c
the	c
problems	c
I	c
had	c
.	c

Every	c
person	c
in	c
the	c
world	c
looks	c
for	i
technology	c
everyday	i
to	c
improve	c
the	c
way	c
they	c
live	c
their	c
own	c
life	i
.	c

We	c
young	c
people	c
do	c
n't	c
remember	c
when	c
technology	c
was	c
n't	c
part	c
of	c
our	c
daily	c
life	c
,	c
but	c
our	c
parents	c
,	c
or	c
grand	i
parents	i
remember	c
exactly	i
when	i
they	c
were	c
young	c
,	c
and	c
everything	c
was	c
made	c
in	c
a	c
different	c
way	c
,	i
for	i
example	c
our	c
parents	c
did	c
n't	c
have	c
computers	c
at	c
home	c
when	c
they	c
were	c
teenagers	c
.	c

Nowadays	c
,	c
it	c
's	c
very	c
common	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
computer	c
at	i
your	c
house	c
,	c
and	c
when	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
do	c
a	i
homework	c
,	c
you	c
can	c
type	c
it	c
on	c
your	c
computer	c
,	c
print	c
it	c
and	c
bring	c
it	c
to	c
the	i
school	c
,	i
also	i
you	c
can	c
search	c
for	c
new	c
subjects	c
on	c
the	c
internet	i
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

But	c
,	c
the	c
quality	c
of	c
this	c
show	c
was	c
n't	c
what	c
you	c
let	i
understand	i
,	c
an	i
I	c
feel	c
realy	i
disappointed	c
by	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
want	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
some	c
details	c
about	c
my	c
feelings	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
you	c
presented	i
a	c
starring	i
composed	i
with	i
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
but	c
he	c
was	c
n't	c
there	c
!	c

So	c
you	c
can	c
imagine	c
how	c
I	i
am	i
satisfied	i
by	c
your	c
pretending	i
"	i
Perfect	c
Evening	c
"	c
.	c

For	c
all	c
these	c
reasons	c
,	c
and	c
if	c
you	c
want	c
to	c
keep	c
me	c
a	i
costumer	i
,	c
I	c
would	c
be	c
gratfull	i
if	c
you	c
give	i
me	c
some	c
or	c
all	c
my	i
money	c
back	c
.	c

The	c
problem	c
is	c
that	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
keep	c
calm	c
during	c
an	c
exam	c
to	i
succeed	i
.	c

At	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
the	c
exam	c
session	c
,	c
all	c
students	c
and	c
teachers	c
meet	c
together	c
for	c
a	c
big	c
party	c
,	c
to	c
celebrate	c
it	i
.	c

So	c
congratulation	i
everybody	c
.	c

On	c
Thursday	c
,	c
the	c
3rd	c
of	c
May	c
2000	c
,	c
we	c
went	c
to	c
your	c
theatre	c
to	c
see	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
"	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
we	c
got	c
our	c
tickets	c
in	i
your	c
ticket	c
office	c
just	c
one	c
hour	c
before	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

Thirdly	c
,	c
we	c
were	c
astonished	c
about	i
the	c
actors	c
whose	i
we	c
know	c
from	c
others	i
musical	i
.	c

Why	c
did	c
you	c
not	c
change	c
the	c
name	i
of	i
your	c
advertisement	c
?	c

I	c
hope	c
we	c
are	c
not	c
the	c
only	c
people	c
to	c
be	c
so	c
upset	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
the	c
first	c
and	c
the	c
last	c
time	c
that	c
I	c
came	i
in	i
your	c
theatre	c
.	c

She	c
just	c
thought	i
it	c
would	i
be	i
a	c
secret	c
,	c
she	i
came	i
really	c
embarassed	i
.	c

Scala	c
was	c
hungry	i
with	c
Pat	c
because	c
she	c
thought	c
she	c
can	i
keep	c
this	c
kind	c
of	c
secret	c
.	c

Many	c
thanks	c
for	c
the	c
programme	c
you	c
have	c
organised	c
.	c

There	c
is	c
just	c
one	c
thing	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
;	i
Janine	c
and	c
Richey	c
have	c
seen	c
an	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
show	c
and	c
we	c
all	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

That	i
is	c
in	c
the	c
central	i
Exhibition	c
Hall	c
,	c
near	c
the	c
hotel	c
,	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
only	i
about	c
fashion	c
:	c
latest	i
fashions	c
,	c
leisure	c
and	c
sports	c
wear	c
,	c
make	i
up	i
and	c
hairstyles	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
could	c
be	c
very	c
interesting	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
free	c
for	c
students	c
(	c
what	i
is	c
really	c
good	c
)	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
farward	i
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

By	c
the	c
time	c
I	c
arrived	c
here	i
,	c
he	c
has	i
disappeared	c
.	c

I	c
finally	c
realized	c
that	c
she	c
was	c
dead	c
.	c

They	c
found	c
hime	i
two	c
months	c
after	i
and	c
six	c
months	c
after	i
he	c
was	c
in	c
jail	c
.	c

To	c
forget	c
everything	c
,	c
I	c
moved	c
to	c
Irkind	c
with	c
my	c
sister	c
in	i
a	c
small	c
house	c
in	c
the	c
countryside	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c

Besides	c
,	c
when	c
we	c
wanted	c
to	c
buy	c
our	c
tickets	c
we	c
were	c
hoping	c
that	c
the	c
discounting	i
was	c
available	c
.	c

These	c
kinds	c
of	c
misadventures	c
can	c
easily	c
ruin	c
your	c
reputation	c
.	c

Your	i
sincerely	c
,	c

Sweating	c
and	c
affraid	i
I	c
waited	c
out	i
side	i
the	c
director	c
's	c
office	c
the	c
following	c
day	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
suprised	i
that	c
my	c
father	c
did	c
n't	c
watch	c
me	c
but	c
I	c
soon	c
understood	c
that	c
he	c
was	c
ignoring	c
me	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Ryan	c
,	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
that	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
travel	c
only	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
in	c
the	c
other	c
months	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
too	c
busy	c
with	c
my	c
work	c
.	c

Most	c
of	c
the	c
students	c
agree	c
in	c
saying	c
that	c
two	i
are	i
the	i
main	c
features	c
of	i
our	c
daily	c
life	c
at	c
school	c
which	c
should	c
be	c
filmed	c
:	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
very	c
funny	c
to	c
dwell	i
on	c
us	c
working	c
and	c
speaking	c
together	c
without	i
the	c
help	c
of	c
the	c
teacher	c
to	i
show	i
our	i
efforts	i
and	i
sometimes	i
successful	i
and	i
sometimes	i
ridiculous	i
and	c
also	c
to	c
film	c
some	c
amusing	c
moments	c
we	c
spent	i
waiting	c
for	c
the	c
teacher	c
.	c

which	i
is	i
the	i
most	i
.	c

Then	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
forced	c
to	c
wait	c
fourty	i
five	i
minutes	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
show	c
because	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
20:75	c
in	i
stead	i
of	c
19:30	c
and	c
when	i
it	c
finally	c
started	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
really	c
disapointed	i
to	c
see	c
that	c
the	c
actors	c
were	c
n't	c
Danny	c
and	c
Tina	c
as	c
it	c
said	i
on	i
the	c
anouncement	i
.	c

Your	c
really	c
unsatisfied	i
costomer	i

How	c
has	c
modern	c
technology	c
afected	i
my	c
daily	c
life	c
?	c

That	c
is	c
not	c
difference	i
from	c
now	c
.	c

We	c
live	c
sorrounded	i
by	c
inventions	c
wich	i
help	c
as	c
through	c
the	c
day	c
.	c

From	c
the	c
vehicle	c
we	c
use	c
to	c
move	c
faster	c
to	c
the	c
light	c
bulb	c
we	c
use	c
at	c
night	c
,	c
we	c
constantly	c
depends	i
on	c
these	c
inventions	c
to	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
make	i
the	c
things	c
we	c
have	c
to	c
do	c
.	c

That	c
's	c
why	c
modern	c
technology	c
is	c
so	c
important	c
in	c
our	c
daily	c
life	i
,	c
because	c
it	c
helps	c
to	c
make	c
our	c
life	i
easiest	i
and	c
to	c
do	c
what	c
we	c
have	c
to	c
do	c
faster	c
so	c
then	c
we	c
can	c
use	c
better	i
our	i
time	i
.	c

Warsaw	c

13th	c
of	c
June	c
2000	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

Amazing	c
,	c
is	c
n't	c
it	c
?	c

The	c
event	c
took	c
place	c
a	c
month	c
ago	c
in	c
the	c
Rock	c
Stadium	c
.	c

We	c
had	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
things	c
to	c
do	c
.	c

Acctually	i
,	c
they	c
put	c
me	c
very	c
close	c
to	c
the	c
stage	c
,	c
in	c
the	c
middle	c
of	c
the	c
real	c
hell	c
.	c

Many	c
people	c
fainted	c
and	c
some	c
of	c
them	c
,	c
the	c
most	c
serious	c
cases	c
,	c
had	c
to	c
be	c
taken	c
to	c
hospital	c
.	c

Despite	c
this	c
fact	c
,	c
the	c
atmosphere	c
was	c
terrific	c
.	c

After	c
the	c
concert	c
many	c
people	c
lost	c
their	c
way	c
home	c
,	c
mostly	c
foreigners	c
who	c
did	c
n't	c
know	c
the	c
buses	c
'	c
schedule	c
.	c

We	c
had	c
to	c
order	c
taxis	c
for	c
them	c
as	c
they	c
did	c
n't	c
have	c
mobile	c
telephones	c
.	c

I	c
did	c
n't	c
manage	c
to	c
meet	c
Michael	c
as	c
I	c
had	c
expected	c
,	c
but	c
apart	c
from	c
that	c
,	c
I	c
really	c
enjoyed	c
time	i
I	c
spent	c
there	c
.	c

You	c
should	c
also	c
try	c
.	i

Best	c
wishes	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
what	c
you	c
have	c
written	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
on	i
the	c
newspaper	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
bought	c
my	c
ticket	c
I	c
asked	c
for	c
a	c
discount	c
and	c
they	c
said	c
it	i
was	i
not	i
available	c
.	c

When	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
the	c
person	c
who	c
was	c
acting	c
it	i
was	c
not	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
he	i
seemed	i
not	i
to	c
be	c
an	c
actor	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
letting	i
down	i
because	i
of	i
your	c
behaviour	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
your	i
answer	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
what	c
will	c
happen	c
with	i
us	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
?	c

So	c
,	c
what	c
are	c
we	c
going	c
to	c
do	c
?	c

Something	c
that	c
I	c
note	c
about	c
technology	c
is	c
that	c
we	c
are	c
loosing	i
green	c
places	c
and	c
there	c
are	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
pollution	c
,	c
so	c
we	c
have	c
to	c
be	c
careful	c
.	c

Dear	c

I	c

I	c
've	c

ONE	c
WEEK	c
LATER	c
THEY	c

TO	c
A	c
POP	c
CONCERT	c
WHICH	c
TOOK	c
PLACE	c
IN	c
ZURICH	c
LAST	c
MONTH	c
.	c

WE	c
WERE	c
A	c
GROUPE	i
!	c

ONE	c
TEAM	c
!	c

BEFORE	c
THE	c
CONCERT	c
WE	c
HAD	c
A	c
BREAK	c
TO	c
EAT	c
SOMETHING	c
AND	c
TO	c
TALK	c
TO	c
EACH	c
OTHER	c
.	c

IT	c
WAS	c
INTERESTING	c
TO	c
SEE	c
THAT	c
ALL	c
PEOPLE	c
HAVE	c
OTHER	i
HOBBIES	c
AND	c
WORK	i

AFTER	c
A	c

MORNING..	c

GREATING	i
AND	c
HOPE	c
TO	c
SEE	c
YOU	c
SOON	c

Firstly	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
mentioned	c
that	c
there	c
were	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
two	c
starrings	i
but	c
,	c
in	c
fact	c
,	c
only	c
an	i
actor	c
were	i
performing	c
on	i
the	c
show	c
.	c

This	c
really	c
upset	c
me	c
as	c
no	c
notice	c
were	i
given	c
before	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

Thirdly	c
,	c
the	c
advertisment	i
said	c
that	c
the	i
discounts	c
were	c
avaliable	i
but	c
,	i
the	c
ticket	c
seller	c
said	c
that	c
there	c
was	c
no	c
discount	c
allowing	i
or	i
avaliable	i
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
for	c
money	i
back	c
for	i
the	c
ticket	c
due	c
to	c
the	c
disapointing	i
evening	c
out	c
and	c
unreliable	i

We	c
would	c
n't	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
sort	i
out	i
informations	i
and	c
datas	i
this	i
quickly	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
no	c
one	c
could	c
communicate	c
on	c
the	c
phone	c
through	i
countries	i
or	i
even	i
through	i
houses	i
as	c
immediate	i
as	c
nowadays	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
the	c
affects	i
that	c
it	c
has	c
on	c
our	c
daily	c
life	c
is	i
not	c
always	c
good	c
as	c
sometime	i
,	i
the	c
technology	c
went	i
wrong	c
and	c
out	i
of	i
hand	i
of	i
people	i
who	i
control	i
it	i
can	c
cause	c
disaster	i
accidents	c
,	c
for	c
example	c
:	c
plane	c
crashes	c
,	c
trains	i
crashed	i
and	c
explosion	i
of	c
nuclears	i
bomb	i
.	c

If	c
this	c
continue	i
to	c
happen	c
our	c
life	c
would	i
be	c
very	c
misarable	i
as	c
accident	i
happens	i
all	c
the	c
time	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
many	i
interesting	c
positions	i
in	c
this	c
schedule	c
,	c
especially	c
the	c
river	c
trip	c
to	c
Greenwich	c
,	c
which	c
,	c
we	c
are	c
shure	i
,	c
will	c
be	c
very	c
exciting	c
.	c

There	c
will	c
a	i
lot	c
of	c
show	i
for	i
instance	i
latest	c
fashions	c
,	c
leisure	c
and	c
sports	c
wear	c
,	c
make	i
up	i
and	c
hairstyles	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
it	c
is	c
very	c
important	c
for	c
us	c
to	c
be	c
there	c
and	c
it	c
could	c
be	c
great	i
opportunity	c
,	c
because	c
the	i
entrance	c
is	c
free	c
for	c
students	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
b	i
grateful	c
if	c
you	c
consider	i
our	c
suggestions	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
dangerous	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
knew	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
.	c

Suddenly	c
I	c
heard	c
a	c
noice	i
from	c
my	c
garden	c
and	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
know	c
what	c
it	c
was	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
impossible	c
to	c
do	i
it	i
.	c

After	c
a	c
few	c
minutes	c
I	c
heard	c
steps	c
near	c
my	c
kitchen	i
's	i
window	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
terrible	c
,	i
I	c
thought	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
the	c
last	c
day	c
of	c
my	c
life	c
.	c

He	c
was	c
a	c
thief	c
,	c
who	c
were	i
looked	c
for	c
for	c
many	c
years	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
just	c
coming	c
back	c
from	c
a	c
week	c
's	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
,	c
which	c
has	c
been	c
all	c
in	c
all	c
really	c
nice	c
.	c

Another	c
thing	c
was	c
that	c
you	c
said	c
discounts	c
are	c
available	c
which	i
is	c
very	c
important	c
for	c
students	c
,	c
but	c
no	c
their	i
were	c
n't	c
any	c
.	c

In	c
that	c
case	c
I	c
also	c
want	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
for	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

How	c
has	c
modern	c
technology	c
changed	c
your	c
daily	c
life	c
?	c

Since	c
everyone	c
can	c
afford	c
modern	c
technology	c
the	i
life	i
of	i
everyone	i
in	c
the	c
more	c
developed	c
countries	c
has	c
changed	c
completly	i
.	c

At	c
work	c
we	c
have	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
thing	c
in	c
the	c
world	c
of	c
technology	c
,	c
the	c
computer	c
.	c

Your	c
advertisement	c
mentioned	c
that	c
the	c
famous	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
would	c
play	c
in	c
this	c
show	c
but	c
disappointingly	c
it	c
was	c
another	c
,	c
unkown	i
actor	c
who	c
starred	c
instead	c
of	c
him	c
.	c

Notwithstanding	c
the	c
fact	c
that	c
I	c
could	c
have	c
expected	c
a	c
discount	c
for	i
my	c
ticket	c
,	c
it	c
occuried	i
to	c
be	c
impossible	c
to	c
have	i
one	c
.	c

Although	c
your	c
leaflet	c
suggested	c
that	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
would	c
be	c
open	c
it	i
was	c
not	c
the	c
case	c
because	c
of	c
a	c
lack	c
of	c
available	c
staff	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

I	c
should	c
have	c
known	c
better	c
but	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
tell	c
it	i
to	i
someone	c
.	c

I	c
immediately	c
knew	c
that	c
something	c
was	c
wrong	c
so	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
word	c
with	c
Pat	c
.	c

From	c
this	c
moment	c
,	c
I	c
knew	c
without	c
the	c
shadow	c
of	c
a	c
doubt	c
that	c
my	c
mother	c
would	c
know	c
it	i
sooner	c
or	c
later	c
.	c

I	c
read	c
the	c
hurt	c
in	c
her	c
eyes	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
a	c
great	c
fan	c
of	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
went	c
to	c
see	c
him	c
in	c
his	c
new	c
show	c
,	c
but	c
,	c
to	c
my	c
surprise	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
him	c
who	c
played	c
that	c
night	c
but	c
another	c
horrible	i
young	c
actor	c
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
be	c
very	c
grateful	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
send	c
me	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
because	c
,	c
as	c
you	c
have	c
seen	c
,	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
spend	i
the	c
"	c
perfect	c
evening	c
"	c
you	c
announce	i
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

Very	c
soon	c
,	c
Lise	c
understood	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
useless	c
to	c
continue	c
pretending	c
that	c
she	c
knew	c
nothing	c
about	c
it	c
,	c
and	c
decided	c
to	c
make	c
a	c
deal	c
with	c
her	c
class	c
mates	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
an	c
unfair	c
deal	c
,	c
but	c
if	c
they	c
wanted	c
the	c
questions	c
they	c
had	c
to	c
accept	c
,	c
and	c
if	c
they	c
accepted	c
,	c
they	c
could	c
n't	c
tell	i
anything	i
to	i
the	i
teachers	i
,	c
because	c
,	c
in	c
fact	c
,	c
they	c
were	c
as	c
guilty	c
as	c
Lise	c
.	c

Dear	c
Madam	c
,	c

However	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
a	c
few	c
things	c
that	c
I	c
personally	c
think	c
can	i
be	c
improved	c
in	c
the	i
following	i
editions	i
.	c

Artists	c
from	c
different	c
cultures	c
may	i
make	c
the	c
festival	c
even	c
more	c
interesting	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
shame	c
to	c
found	i
that	c
some	c
of	c
them	c
were	c
sold	c
out	c
because	c
the	i
short	i
number	c
of	c
seats	c
available	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
really	c
enjoyed	c
the	c
dance	c
shows	c
and	c
the	c
plays	c
and	c
films	c
.	c

One	c
day	c
,	c
he	c
became	c
ill	c
and	c
was	c
worried	c
about	c
the	c
animals	c
.	c

I	c
will	c
take	c
care	c
of	c
the	c
sheeps	i
for	c
you	c
,	c
father	c
"	c
.	c

the	i
next	c
day	c
he	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
mountain	c
with	c
the	c
animals	c
.	c

He	c
did	c
it	c
more	i
times	c
,	c
and	c
at	i
last	i
nobody	c
cared	i
of	c
the	c
shoutings	i
.	c

Nobody	c
came	c
.	c

Then	c
he	c
learned	c
to	i
say	i
always	i
the	c
truth	c
.	c

Dear	c
Clark	c
,	c

However	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
some	c
points	c
which	c
can	c
be	c
improved	c
for	c
the	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

Another	c
point	c
where	c
you	c
could	c
improve	c
is	c
when	i
you	c
show	c
more	c
plays	c
and	c
films	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

To	c
finish	c
this	c
letter	c
with	i
I	i
would	c
like	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
a	c
good	c
idea	c
for	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
nice	c
if	c
you	c
create	i
an	c
exhibition	c
place	i
where	c
the	c
guests	c
can	c
try	c
to	c
play	c
different	c
instruments	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

How	c
can	c
you	c
earn	c
money	c
in	c
your	c
spare	c
time	c
?	c

I	c
think	c
everybody	c
will	c
ask	c
himself	c
this	c
question	c
one	c
day	c
or	c
has	c
already	c
asked	c
it	c
.	c

The	c
problems	i
that	c
you	c
have	c
here	c
is	c
the	c
weather	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
when	c
it	c
is	c
rainy	c
,	c
because	c
then	c
everything	c
get	i
wet	c
.	c

But	c
in	c
the	c
case	c
that	c
you	c
really	c
want	c
to	c
do	c
some	c
interesting	c
work	c
in	c
your	c
spare	c
time	c
you	c
should	c
try	c
to	c
sell	c
something	c
where	i
you	c
're	c
good	c
at	c
,	c
I	c
mean	c
if	c
you	c
're	c
interested	c
in	c
computers	c
you	c
should	c
try	c
to	c
provide	c
your	c
service	c
for	c
other	c
people	c
.	c

Of	c
course	c
in	c
the	c
begining	i
it	c
is	c
hard	c
but	c
you	c
can	c
learn	c
a	c
lot	c
and	c
if	c
you	c
're	c
good	c
at	c
you	i
'll	c
also	c
earn	c
some	c
money	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
you	i
because	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
answer	i
the	c
information	c
that	c
you	c
ask	c
for	c
.	c

It	c
will	c
be	c
impossible	c
another	i
choise	i
,	c
but	c
if	c
you	c
have	c
any	c
problem	c
you	c
will	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
advise	c
me	c
,	c
although	c
I	c
prefer	c
to	c
go	c
there	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
I	c
think	c
is	i
the	c
best	c
month	c
to	c
travel	c
,	i
the	c
weather	c
is	c
nicer	c
and	c
warmer	c
than	c
in	c
other	c
seasons	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
my	c
choise	i
is	c
the	c
accommodation	c
in	c
tents	c
,	i
I	c
think	c
it	c
could	c
be	c
more	c
interesting	c
,	i
I	c
could	c
enjoy	c
my	c
time	c
with	c
other	c
people	c
playing	c
,	c
eating	c
and	c
talking	c
outside	c
,	i
in	i
my	c
opinion	c
if	c
I	c
choose	c
the	c
log	i
cabins	i
it	c
will	c
be	c
like	c
be	i
at	c
home	c
.	c

It	c
should	c
be	c
a	c
dry	c
place	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
but	i
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
make	c
sure	c
my	i
guess	i
,	i
as	i
well	i
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
will	c
need	c
,	c
because	c
it	i
is	i
also	i
all	i
paid	i
I	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
if	c
there	c
will	c
be	c
some	i
gift	c
shops	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
hearing	i
from	c
you	c

The	c
most	c
popular	c
"	c
sport	c
"	c
that	c
all	i
the	i
people	i
do	i
it	i
's	i
obiously	i
shopping	c
.	c

Some	c
people	c
think	c
that	c
going	c
shopping	c
can	c
keep	c
you	c
away	c
from	c
depression	c
.	c

Can	c
you	c
imagen	i
be	i
in	c
Japan	c
or	c
China	c
and	c
have	i
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
thing	i
that	c
I	i
'll	i
enjoy	c
it	c
,	c
all	c
the	c
people	c

you	c

you	c
ca	c
n't	c
walk	c
properly	c
or	c
buy	c
something	i
,	i
and	i
also	c
there	c
are	c
lot	i
of	c
cases	c
which	c
show	c
how	c
people	c
can	c
be	c
in	c
shops	c
,	i
I	c
mean	c
that	c
some	c
people	c
can	c

Dear	c
Sir	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
this	c
letter	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
show	c
which	c
I	c
saw	c
in	i
your	c

During	c
staying	i
in	c
London	c
,	c
I	c
had	i
read	i
your	c
advertisement	c
and	c
planned	c
to	c
enjoy	c
seeing	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
expected	c
that	c
I	c
could	i
have	c
spend	i
a	c
wonderful	c
night	c
.	c

But	c
it	c
was	c
completely	c
different	c
one	i
which	i
I	c
had	c
expected	c
.	c

According	c
to	c
the	c
advertisement	c
the	c
show	c
is	i
to	c
start	c
at	c
19:30	c
.	c

We	c
had	c
to	c
wait	c
for	c
45	c
minutes	c
!	c

Could	i
you	c
understand	c
how	c
boring	c
it	c
was	c
just	c
sitting	c
with	c
nothing	c
to	c
do.	i
?	c

But	c
no	c
discounts	c
were	c
accepted	i
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

We	c
can	c
live	c
in	c
a	c
clean	c
and	c
comfortably	c
air-conditioned	c
house	c
.	c

In	i
these	i
days	c
,	c
many	c
kinds	c
of	c
pollution	c
have	c
been	c
caused	c
by	c
our	c
modern	c
life	i
.	c

All	c
of	c
us	c
must	c
notice	c
this	c
fact	c
.	c

It	c
said	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
at	c
14.30	c
but	c
,	c
actually	c
,	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
20.15	c
so	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
wait	c
for	c
about	c
six	c
hours	c
.	c

Your	c
advert	c
made	c
me	c
misunderstood	i
.	c

So	c
I	c
want	c
you	c
to	c
give	c
me	c
a	c
refund	c
.	c

How	c
has	c
mordern	i
technology	c
changed	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
?	c

I	c
usually	c
spend	c
my	c
time	c
on	c
playing	c
computer	c
about	i
three	c
hours	c
a	c
day	c
.	c

Modern	c
technology	c
has	c
changed	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
from	c
physical	c
activity	c
to	c
mental	c
activity	c

Mr.	c
Jones	c
:	c

I	c
recive	i
a	c
paper	i
where	i
I	c
was	c
told	c
about	c
a	c
play	c
you	c
are	c
presenting	i
and	c
of	c
the	c
advantages	c
I	c
would	c
recive	i
if	c
I	c
go	i
to	c
see	c
it	c
,	i
think	i
that	c
never	i
happend	i
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
in	i
the	c
sheet	c
I	c
recived	i
,	c
it	c
says	c
that	c
DANNY	c
BROOK	c
was	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
actor	i
,	i
thing	i
that	i
is	c
not	c
true	c
,	c
because	c
insted	i
of	c
him	c
,	c
there	c
was	c
another	c
actor	c
,	c
that	i
I	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
what	i
's	i
his	c
name	c
is	c
.	c

thank	c
you	c
.	c

Also	c
,	c
that	c
they	c
would	i
invite	c
psicologist	i
,	c
the	c
Autor	i
of	c
the	c
book	c
and	c
may	i
be	i
the	c
president	c
would	i
talk	c
so	c
I	c
recommend	c
you	c
to	i
hear	i
it	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

I	c
would	c
rather	i
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
the	i
tent	c
than	c
to	i
stay	i
in	c
the	c
log	c
cabin	c
because	c
the	i
tent	c
is	c
more	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

Also	c
,	c
how	c
much	c
does	c
it	c
cost	c
.	i

I	c
wish	c
you	c
were	i
there	c
and	c
saw	i
the	c
concert	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
really	c
brilliant	c
.	c

You	c
should	c
have	c
seen	c
,	i
there	c
was	c
really	i
terrible	c
rush	c
before	c
concert	i
and	c
everybody	c
was	c
runing	i
around	c
to	i
do	i
something	c
.	c

I	c
helped	c
to	c
carry	c
huge	c
speakers	c
to	c
the	c
concert	c
venue	c
.	c

Some	c
people	c
tried	c
to	c
enter	c
without	c
any	i
ticket	c
but	c
they	c
were	c
n't	c
allowed	c
by	i
police	i
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Brown	c
,	c

We	c
are	c
writing	c
to	c
invite	c
you	c
and	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
some	c
information	c
about	c
the	c
party	c
.	c

All	c
our	c
class	c
love	c
Mr	c
Brown	c
very	c
much	c
,	c
so	c
we	c
decided	c
to	c
organise	c
a	c
surprise	c
party	c
for	c
him	c
.	c

The	c
party	c
in	i
on	c
Tuesday	c
16	c
of	c
June	c
.	c

Besides	c
this	c
,	c
we	c
have	c
invited	c
all	c
other	i
teachers	c
and	c
the	c
Principal	c
of	c
our	c
school	c
.	c

So	c
we	c
would	c
appreciate	c
if	i
you	c
help	i
us	c
with	c
this	c
matter	c
.	c

He	c
loves	c
to	c
read	c
books	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
especially	c
as	c
I	c
am	c
concerned	c
about	c
this	c
matter	c
.	c

They	c
know	c
the	c
way	c
to	c
do	c
this	c
.	c

And	c
the	c
way	c
is	c
love	c
.	c

They	c
help	c
their	c
children	c
with	c
lessons	c
and	c
give	c
them	c
some	c
useful	c
advice	c
with	c
their	c
relationships	c
.	c

So	c
we	c
should	c
trust	c
only	c
our	c
family	c
when	c
we	c
need	c
help	c
or	c
solutions	c
of	i
our	c
problems	c
.	c

About	i
the	c
acomodation	i
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
instead	c
of	c
a	c
tent	c
so	c
as	c
to	c
get	c
a	c
better	c
rest	c
.	c

If	c
there	c
is	c
,	c
please	c
let	c
me	c
know	c
.	c

After	c
all	i
this	c
introduction	c
,	c
will	i
be	c
the	i
time	c
to	c
show	c
some	c
of	c
the	c
acitivities	i
every	i
one	i
can	c
join	i
in	i
the	c
school	c
,	c
such	i
as	i
lesons	i
or	i
others	i
like	i

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
glad	c
to	c
hear	c
that	c
I	c
had	c
won	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
the	c
competition	c
.	c

Anyway	c
,	c
to	c
participate	c
in	c
two-weeks	c
Camp	i
California	c
in	c
the	c
U.S.A	c
I	c
readily	c
give	c
you	c
my	c
personal	c
details	c
and	c
information	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
the	c
most	c
favorable	i
time	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
travel	c
is	c
July	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
in	c
the	c
final	c
year	c
of	c
University	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
attend	c
classes	c
for	c
a	c
thesis	c
almost	c
throughout	c
the	c
year	c
apart	c
from	c
July	c
,	c
when	c
I	c
can	c
take	c
a	c
relatively	c
long	c
summer	c
holiday	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
willingly	i
like	c
to	c
choose	c
swimming	c
and	c
painting	c
.	c

I	c
used	c
to	c
belong	c
to	c
a	c
swimming	c
club	c
and	c
practise	c
swimming	c
a	c
couple	c
of	c
times	c
a	c
week	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
also	c
gone	c
in	c
for	c
some	c
competitions	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
painting	c
beautiful	c
landscapes	c
of	c
California	c
.	c

Last	c
but	c
not	c
at	c
least	c
,	c
what	c
sort	c
of	c
clothes	c
do	c
you	c
think	c
I	c
must	c
bring	c
with	c
me	c
,	c
and	c
is	c
there	c
any	c
laundry	c
system	c
there	c
?	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
be	c
very	c
grateful	c
for	c
your	c
help	c
.	c

The	c
aim	c
of	c
this	c
report	c
is	c
to	c
describe	c
and	c
assess	c
daily	c
life	c
at	c
this	c
school	c
and	c
suggest	c
which	c
lessons	c
and	c
other	c
activities	c
should	c
be	c
filmed	c
.	c

This	c
may	c
be	c
thanks	c
to	c
native	i
speaker	i
teachers	c
who	c
came	c
to	c
the	c
school	c
last	c
year	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
less	i
numbers	i
of	i
students	c
were	c
nodding	c
off	c
comparing	i
with	c
other	c
classes	c
like	c
Maths	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
found	c
that	c
hockey	c
is	c
the	c
most	c
popular	c
sport	c
among	c
students	c
.	c

As	c
the	c
record	c
says	c
,	c
our	c
hockey	c
team	c
has	c
been	c
on	i
the	c
top	c
of	c
the	c
league	c
for	c
three	c
successive	c
years	c
.	c

Although	c
every	c
school	c
has	c
a	c
boys	c
'	c
football	c
team	c
,	c
our	c
school	c
is	c
the	c
only	c
one	c
which	c
possesses	c
a	c
girls	c
'	c
team	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
,	c

I	c
had	c
a	c
terrible	c
evening	c
,	c
so	c
there	c
were	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
faults	c
in	c
the	c
event	c
of	c
last	c
Saturday	c
:	c
The	c
first	c
point	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
(	c
it	c
was	c
too	i
late	c
)	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
child	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
use	c
the	c
computer	c
because	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
know	c
what	c
is	i
that	i
.	c

On	c
top	c
of	c
everything	c
,	c
the	c
main	c
cast	i
,	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
did	c
not	c
appear	c
on	i
the	c
show	c
.	c

I	c
trust	c
you	c
will	c
give	c
an	i
immediate	c
attention	c
to	c
this	c
letter	c
and	c
I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
receiving	c
a	c
satisfactory	c
responce	i
in	i
return	c
of	c
post	c
within	c
a	c
week	c
.	c

When	c
we	c
think	c
about	c
clothes	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
,	c
we	c
should	c
think	c
about	c
the	c
enviroment	i
first	c
.	c

Of	c
course	c
,	c
technologies	i
will	c
have	c
developped	i
enough	c
to	i
invent	c
new	c
material	c
for	c
those	c
kind	i
of	c
clothes	c
.	c

So	c
we	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
to	c
worry	c
about	c
how	c
heavey	i
they	c
will	c
be	c
.	c

We	c
will	c
feel	c
as	c
if	c
we	c
put	i
on	i
nothing	c
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
clothes	i
after	i
100	i
years	i
will	c
not	c
as	i
fashionable	c
as	c
they	c
are	c
now	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
,	c

Firstly	c
I	i
expected	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
but	c
I	c
felt	c
very	c
angry	c
when	c
I	c
saw	c
diffrent	i
actors	c
.	c

Additionally	c
I	c
felt	c
very	c
hungry	c
and	c
uncomfortable	c
because	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
and	c
you	c
did	c
not	c
give	c
us	c
any	c
reason	c
why	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
had	i
16	c
years	c
old	c
I	c
fell	c
in	c
love	c
with	c
the	c
most	c
hundsom	i
boy	c
in	c
our	c
school	c
.	c

One	c
day	c
he	c
invited	c
us	c
for	i
his	c
party	c
.	c

Everybody	c
started	c
to	c
laught	i
at	c
me	c
.	c

This	c
alien	i
was	c
so	c
intelligent	c
and	c
funny	c
that	c
I	c
forgot	c
about	c
my	c
troubles	c
.	c

We	c
talked	c
for	i
all	c
night	c
and	c
I	c
fall	i
in	c
love	c
with	c
him	c
.	c

Maybe	c
it	c
was	c
good	c
that	c
Pat	c
was	c
so	c
talkative	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
really	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
see	i
one	c
of	c
my	c
favourite	c
actors	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
in	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
but	c
you	c
had	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
,	c
what	i
disappointed	c
me	c
very	c
much	c
.	c

Finally	c
we	c
had	i
no	i
perfect	i
evening	c
at	c
all	c
!	c

Yours	c

Brigitte	c
Beschle	c

We	c
had	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
fun	c
.	c

We	c
lost	c
the	c
others	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
this	c
letter	c
to	c
you	c
,	c
because	c
the	c
show	c
"	c
Over	c
The	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
which	i
is	c
the	i
London	c
's	c
newest	c
and	c
best	c
musical	c
show	c
,	c
was	c
not	c
...	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
thought	c
that	c
Dany	c
Brook	c
who	i
is	c
my	c
favorite	i
actor	c
play	i
in	c
that	c
show	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
be	c
very	c
grateful	c
if	c
I	c
could	c
get	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
,	i
I	c
knew	c
that	c
he	c
's	c
very	i
talkative	c
person	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
nessesery	i
because	c
I	c
wanted	c
him	c
to	c
be	c
the	c
main	c
director	i
of	c
that	c
birthday	c
party	c
for	c
tenes	i
.	c

I	c
made	c
a	i
beautifull	i
invite	i
cards	i
for	c
every	i
Agatha	i
friends	c
with	c
a	c
sign	i
"	i
Do	c
not	c
tell	c
Agatha	c
about	c
that	i
,	i
this	i
is	c
a	c
suprise	i
party	c
for	c
her	c
,	i
please	i
keep	c
the	c
secret	c
!	c
"	c

Everything	c
was	c
set	c
...	c
the	c
day	c
and	c
hour	c
came	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
so	c
exaiting	i
!	c
!	c
!	c

We	c
put	i
off	c
the	c
lights	c
and	c
then	c
the	c
door	c
opened	c
and	c
I	c
just	c
heard	c
"	c
What	c
the	c
hell	c
is	c
going	c
on	c
?	c
!	c
!	c
"	c

We	c
had	c
fun	c
to	i
5	c
o'clock	c
!	c

As	c
far	c
as	c
activities	c
are	c
concerned	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
Basketball	i
and	i
Climbing	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
basketball	c
,	c
and	c
even	c
if	c
I	c
am	c
not	c
a	c
tall	c
boy	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
good	c
playmaker	i
and	c
I	c
play	c
in	c
a	c
local	c
team	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
at	c
the	c
concert	c
when	c
I	c
met	c
a	c
friend	c
of	c
mine	c
whose	c
job	c
is	c
to	c
organise	c
shows	c
like	c
that	c
.	c

He	c
told	c
me	c
He	i
needed	c
a	c
boy	c
who	c
could	c
help	c
on	c
stage	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
known	i
I	i
can	c
do	c
a	c
little	c
of	c
everything	c
so	c
I	c
accepted	c
.	c

I	c
connected	c
wires	c
,	c
I	c
caried	i
loudspeakers	c
,	c
and	c
so	c
on	c
.	c

Towards	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
the	c
concert	c
I	c
hansled	i
a	c
bottle	c
of	c
wine	c
to	c
Poolo	c
Conte	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
know	c
He	i
's	i
my	c
favorite	i
singer	c
.	c

We	c
started	c
talking	c
about	c
music	c
and	c
I	c
asked	c
Him	i
many	c
things	c
about	c
His	i
texts	i
,	c
which	c
are	c
beautiful	c
but	c
sometimes	c
difficult	c
to	c
understand	c
.	c

I	i
think	i
I	i
wo	i
n't	i
never	i
forget	i
that	i
evening	i
.	c

With	c
my	c
best	c
wishes	c

Is	c
there	c
any	c
problem	c
?	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
the	i
great	c
opportunity	c
I	i
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Camila	c
Beatriz	c
de	c
J.	c
Branco	c

And	c
do	c
n't	c
try	c
to	c
complain	c
to	c
someone	c
else	c
because	c
they	c
wo	c
n't	c
hear	c
you	c
.	c

Even	c
if	c
I	c
worked	c
hard	c
on	c
it	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
surprised	c
of	i
winning	i
just	i
the	c
first	c
prize	c
.	c

However	c
I	i
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
if	c
by	c
any	c
chance	c
the	c
photograpy	i
activities	c
are	c
only	c
for	c
beginners	c
.	c

In	c
this	c
case	c
I	c
would	c
rather	c
do	c
some	c
climbing	c
,	c
which	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
done	c
before	c
.	c

In	c
general	c
,	c
shopping	c
is	c
considered	c
a	c
pleasant	c
activity	c
.	c

In	c
fact	c
,	c
the	c
shopping	c
you	c
do	c
for	c
the	i
daily	c
needs	c
is	c
seldom	c
enjouble	i
,	c
as	c
it	c
is	c
clearly	c
more	c
a	c
duty	c
than	c
a	c
pleasure	c
and	c
morover	i
you	c
are	c
often	c
faced	c
with	c
some	c
nasty	c
situations	c
.	c

And	c
your	c
last	c
festival	c
was	c
very	c
intresting	i
too	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
you	c
must	c
invite	c
artists	c
and	c
stars	c
from	c
more	c
countries	c
around	c
the	c
world	c
,	c
because	c
there	c
are	i
people	c
only	c
from	c
six	c
countries	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
can	c
make	c
your	c
festival	c
more	c
popular	c
.	c

The	c
question	c
you	c
asked	c
me	c
in	c
it	c
is	c
very	c
original	c
too	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
my	c
school	c
is	c
very	c
democratic	c
and	c
so	c
there	c
are	c
very	c
good	c
relations	c
between	c
teachers	c
and	c
students	c
.	c

We	c
are	c
all	c
very	c
friendly	c
in	c
our	c
class	c
and	c
we	c
help	c
to	i
each	c
other	c
when	c
we	c
have	c
a	c
problem	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
a	c
letter	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
I	c
saw	c
last	c
week	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

I	c
thought	c
that	c
I	c
would	c
have	c
a	c
great	c
time	c
there	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
was	c
really	c
disappointed	c
in	i
that	c
evening	c
.	c

The	c
discounts	c
of	i
tickets	c
that	c
you	c
mentioned	c
were	i
not	c
exist	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
be	c
grateful	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
give	c
the	i
money	c
back	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

Our	c
life	c
has	c
been	c
influenced	i
by	c
modern	c
technology	c
.	c

Five	c
years	c
ago	c
,	c
you	c
could	c
be	c
proud	c
of	c
your	c
486	c
computer	c
,	c
which	c
can	i
only	c
be	c
put	c
inside	c
a	c
museum	c
as	c
an	c
antique	c
now	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
been	c
an	i
enthusiast	i
of	i
music	i
for	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
,	i
I	c
used	c
tape	i
player	c
and	c
I	c
felt	c
it	c
was	c
excellent	c
.	c

MD	c
walkman	c
and	c
MP3	c
player	c
,	c
which	c
are	c
considered	c
to	c
be	c
more	c
portable	c
and	c
have	c
better	i
timbre	i
.	c

Especially	i
the	c
improvement	c
of	i
personal	c
computer	i
has	c
greatly	c
helped	c
the	c
spread	c
of	c
information	i
by	i
using	c
internet	i
,	c
you	c
can	c
book	i
newspaper	i
,	i
magazines	c
,	c
even	i
go	c
shopping	c
online	c
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
we	c
should	c
work	c
hard	c
to	c
learn	i
knowledges	i

making	i
the	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
staying	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
n't	c
done	c
it	c
before	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
give	c
it	c
a	c
go	c
.	c

I	c
also	i
would	i
like	c
to	c
chose	i
basketball	c
and	c
surfing	c
as	c
two	c
activities	c
to	c
do	c
while	c
I	c
am	c
at	c
the	c
Camp	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
a	i
captain	c
of	c
school	i
's	c
basketball	c
team	c
and	c
we	c
have	c
won	c
many	i
competitions	c
.	c

Another	c
question	c
is	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
do	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
with	c
me	c
(	c
roughly	c
)	c
?	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

I	c
had	c
to	c
help	c
the	c
director	c
writing	i
a	c
script	c
of	i
the	c
concert	c
and	c
design	c
the	c
background	c
of	c
the	c
stage	c
.	c

I	c
did	c
n't	c
get	c
involved	c
that	c
much	c
in	c
writing	c
a	i
script	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
very	c
hard	c
and	c
the	c
director	c
wrote	c
most	c
of	c
it	c
but	c
the	c
main	c
idea	c
of	i
the	c
background	c
of	c
the	c
stage	c
was	c
my	i
,	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
proud	c
of	c
it	c
.	c

On	c
Saturday	c
night	c
,	c
the	c
concert	c
began	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
and	c
reply	i
to	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
happy	c
because	c
I	c
can	c
have	c
a	c
chance	c
to	c
do	c
activities	c
while	c
I	c
am	c
at	c
the	c
camp	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
not	c
goot	i
at	c
both	i
of	c
them	c
.	c

Could	c
you	c
let	c
me	c
know	c
whether	c
I	c
need	c
extra	c
money	c
or	c
what	c
sort	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
need	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

I	c
'll	c
tell	c
you	c
my	i
experience	i
about	i
helping	c
the	i
pop	c
concert	c
.	c

I	c
did	c
n't	c
need	c
to	c
pay	c
enterence	i
fee	c
because	c
I	c
was	c
working	c
there	c
.	c

Plus	c
,	c
I	c
got	c
a	i
authography	i
from	c
a	c
popular	c
singer	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
believe	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
very	c
interesting	c
,	c
but	c
there	c
were	c
few	i
artists	c
than	c
I	c
have	i
expected	c
.	c

Well	c
,	c
I	c
hope	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
we	c
have	c
to	c
wear	i
in	c
appropriate	i
way	c
,	c
not	c
talk	c
to	c
each	c
other	c
during	c
the	c
lessons	c
and	c
pay	c
attention	c
to	c
the	c
teachers	c
.	c

We	c
are	c
n't	c
allowed	c
to	c
use	c
the	i
mobile	c
phone	c
in	c
class	c
.	c

And	c
now	c
about	c
my	c

Write	c

Also	c
the	i

won	c
the	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
start	c
my	c
journey	i
on	i
the	c
second	c
week	c
of	c
July	c
because	c
I	c
will	c
have	c
a	c
3	i
weeks	i
holiday	c
in	c
July	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
not	c
travel	c
in	c
June	c
and	c
May	c
because	c
I	c
will	c
have	c
my	c
standard	c
grade	c
exam	c
during	c
these	c
two	c
months	c
.	c

As	c
for	c
the	c
accommodation	c
I	i
would	c
like	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
because	c
I	c
hate	c
sleeping	c
in	c
the	i
tents	c
.	c

Would	c
it	c
be	c
possible	c
for	c
you	c
to	c
send	c

of	c
california	i
so	c
I	c

I	c
would	c

I	c
look	c

Hi	c
!	c

We	c
were	c
sitting	c
at	c
the	c
back	c
of	c
the	c
concert	c
hall	c
and	c
chatting	c
with	c
each	c
other	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
a	i
tiring	c
work	c
because	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
run	c
from	c
place	c
to	c
place	c
for	i
hanging	i
the	c
decorations	c
.	c

Thanks	c
very	c
much	c
.	c

The	c
reason	c
is	c
that	c
we	c
have	c
long	c
holidays	c
at	c
school	c
on	i
this	i
time	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
choosen	i

What	c

of	c
clothes	c

needed	c
?	c

Yours	c
sincerelly	i

A.	c
Becker	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c

There	c
are	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
reasons	c
that	i
could	i
be	c
awful	c
to	c
go	c
shopping	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
looking	c
for	c
a	c
special	c
fruit	c
.	c

He	c
wanted	c
everything	c
what	i
his	c
eyes	c
saw	c
.	c

My	c
conclusion	c
on	c
these	c
points	c
are	i
not	c
so	c
bad	c
.	c

At	i
first	i
,	c
all	c
the	c
students	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
thank	i
you	i
for	c
this	c
great	c
idea	c
of	c
a	c
trip	c
in	i
London	c
during	i
three	c
days	c
.	c

Even	i
more	i
,	c
the	i
students	c
do	c
n't	c
pay	c
the	c
entrance	i
.	c

The	c
show	c
is	c
on	c
the	c
14th	c
from	c
10.00	c
to	c
19.00	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
suggest	c
to	i
go	i
to	c
the	c
Science	c
Museum	c
on	i
the	c
afternoon	c
of	i
Wednesday	c
,	c
and	c
just	c
have	i
two	c
or	c
three	c
hours	i
free	c
time	c
after	c
the	c
museum	c
.	c

Your	i
Faithfull	i
,	c

So	c
I	c
knew	c
that	c
the	c
day	c
after	c
would	c
be	c
the	c
good	i
one	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
arrived	c
in	c
front	c
of	c
the	c
bank	c
,	c
my	c
heart	c
was	c
going	c
faster	c
.	c

I	c
took	c
it	c
,	c
the	i
most	i
of	i
possible	i
and	c
went	c
out	c
by	i
the	c
same	c
way	c
.	c

When	c
all	c
the	c
family	c
get	i
up	i
,	c
I	c
told	c
us	i
the	c
true	i
and	c
all	i
promised	c
to	c
say	c
nothing	c
.	c

I	c
do	i
n't	i
expected	i
that	c
I	c
can	i
win	c
in	i
your	i
's	i
competition	c
.	c

I	c
prefer	c
that	c
becouse	i
I	c
will	c
travel	c
with	c
my	c
wife	c
and	c
she	c
always	c
prefers	c
that	c
kind	c
of	c
accommodation	c
.	c

Daily	c
life	c
at	c
my	c
school	c

There	c
is	i
about	c
two	c
thousands	i
students	c
at	c
my	c
school	c
.	c

There	c
are	c
only	c
men	c
.	c

This	c
is	c
very	c
important	c
,	c
becouse	i
every	c
soldier	c
schould	i
be	c
strong	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
competitions	c
should	c
be	c
filmed	c
becouse	i
my	c
school	c
is	c
a	c
kind	c
of	c
sport	i
's	i
school	c
.	c

There	c
schould	i
be	c
an	c
intereview	i
witch	i
students	c
and	c
with	c
profesons	i
.	c

We	c
spends	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
time	c
outside	c
the	c
school	c
during	c
the	c
military	c
things	c
.	c

That	c
kind	c
of	c
thinks	i
should	c
be	c
filmed	c
somehow	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
my	c
unpleasant	c
experience	c
of	c
visiting	c
your	c
theatre	c
on	c
May	c
21st	c
.	c

Next	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
instead	c
of	c
19:30	c
.	c

So	c
he	c
was	c
replaced	c
by	c
another	c
actor	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

Among	c
the	c
greatest	c
inventions	c
of	c
man	c
I	c
came	i
accross	i
dayly	i
are	c
telephone	i
,	c
computer	c
and	c
automobile	c
.	c

It	c
takes	c
me	c
less	c
than	c
a	c
minute	c
to	c
get	c
in	c
touch	c
with	c
my	c
friend	c
Nigel	c
living	c
in	c
Australia	c
-	c
thousand	i
kilometres	i
'	i
from	i
me	c
.	c

All	c
the	c
above	c
and	c
many	c
other	c
achievements	c
of	c
modern	c
technology	c
make	c
my	c
life	c
more	c
convenient	c
,	c
comfortable	c
,	c
effective	c
and	c
fun	c
.	c

But	c
it	i
is	c
not	c
the	c
end	c
.	c

We	c
were	c
planning	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
but	c
when	c
we	c
got	c
there	c
we	c
saw	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	i
of	i
the	i
cleaning	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
the	c
people	c
who	c
came	c
there	c
should	c
be	c
paid	i
back	i
.	c

The	c
things	c
that	c
people	c
wear	c
are	c
changing	c
every	i
time	i
,	c
everyone	c
tries	c
to	c
be	c
diffrent	i
in	c
the	i
public	c
and	c
very	c
different	c
sorts	c
of	c
clothes	c
are	c
being	c
created	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
appreciated	i
you	i
for	c
offering	c
a	c
well-organised	c
programme	c
,	c
especially	c
,	c
the	c
London	c
fashion	c
and	c
leisure	c
show	c
which	c
is	c
difficult	c
for	c
us	c
to	c
take	c
part	c
in	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
getting	c
your	c
reply	c
.	c

your	i
sincerely	c
.	c

As	c
the	i
result	c
,	c
we	c
can	c
observe	c
that	c
the	c
home	i
of	c
the	c
present	c
have	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
machines	c
which	c
make	c
home	c
like	c
a	c
factory	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
so	c
glad	c
to	c
know	c
I	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
.	c

The	c
first	c
one	c
sounds	c
like	c
a	c
great	c
adventure	c
,	c
while	c
the	c
second	c
will	c
allow	c
me	c
to	c
capture	c
all	c
the	c
unforgettable	c
views	c
.	c

She	c
was	c
so	c
kind	c
with	i
all	c
of	c
us	c
,	i
of	i
course	i
I	c
asked	c
her	c
for	c
an	c
autograph	c
.	c

The	c
concert	c
was	c
a	c
big	c
success	c
,	c
lot	i
of	c
excitment	i
.	c

Each	c
time	c
,	i
when	i
she	c
comes	i
back	c
to	c
the	c
room	c
,	c
she	c
asked	c
for	c
something	c
to	c
drink	c
,	c
just	c
a	c
diet	c
coke	c
,	c
because	c
she	c
's	c
always	c
looking	c
after	c
her	c
weight	i
.	c

Then	c
she	c
eat	i
something	c
small	c
and	c
she	c
looks	i
full	c
of	c
energy	c
all	c
night	c
long	c
.	c

I	c
really	c
think	c
she	c
's	c
the	c
best	c
.	c

I	c
received	c
your	c
letter	c
last	c
week	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
really	c
surprised	c
and	c
happy	c
to	c
hear	c
that	c
I	c
won	i
the	c
first	c
prize	c
On	i
your	c
letter	c
you	c
ask	c
me	c
some	c
questions	c
about	c
my	c
wishes	i
:	c

Furthermore	c
could	c
you	c
give	c
me	c
an	c
idea	c
about	c
the	c
pocket	c
money	c
I	c
need	c
?	c

The	c
purpose	c
of	c
this	c
report	c
is	c
to	c
identify	c
which	c
lessons	c
or	c
other	c
activities	c
should	c
be	c
filmed	c
.	c

In	c
order	c
,	i
to	c
prepare	c
this	c
report	c
I	c
visited	c
in	i
many	i
occasions	i
the	i
classrooms	i
and	c
talked	c
to	c
the	c
students	c
and	c
teachers	c
.	c

It	c
seems	c
to	c
me	c
that	c
it	c
will	i
be	c
a	c
nice	c
idea	c
to	c
show	c
our	c
library	c
because	c
according	i
to	c
the	c
librarians	c
,	c
the	c
library	c
has	c
a	c
welcoming	c
atmosphere	c
and	c
is	c
also	c
well-used	i
,	i
moreover	i
the	c
range	c
of	c
books	c
and	c
newspapers	c
is	c
very	c
large	i
and	c
useful	c
.	c

The	c
students	c
mentionned	i
that	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
very	c
interessting	i
to	c
show	c
the	c
English	c
course	i
because	c
some	c
foreign	c
students	c
will	c
probably	c
join	c
our	c
college	c
next	c
year	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
the	c
best	c
way	c
for	c
them	c
to	c
discover	i
our	i
English	c
course	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

Firstly	c
,	c
there	c
was	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
instead	c
of	c
the	c
famous	c
actor	c
,	i
Danny	c
Brook	c
.	c

Another	c
problem	c
is	c
,	i
I	c
realised	i
that	c
the	i
discounts	c
were	c
available	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
there	c
was	c
n't	c
any	c
discount	c
.	c

That	i
is	c
so	c
annoying	c
that	c
everything	c
had	i
been	i
changed	c
without	c
any	c
notice	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrects	i
.	c

However	c
,	c
we	c
are	c
not	c
friends	c
anymore	c
because	c
of	c
a	c
secrect	i
in	i
the	i
past	i
.	c

I	c
told	c
her	c
because	c
I	c
wanted	c
somebody	c
to	c
share	c
my	c
feeling	i
.	c

All	c
my	c
friends	c
were	c
trying	c
to	c
kept	i
a	i
distance	c
with	i
me	c
.	c

Mrs	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

Well	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
be	i
only	i
available	c
in	c
July	c
,	c
because	c
at	c
that	c
time	c
I	c
would	c
be	c
in	i
winter	i
holidays	c
.	c

You	c
mentioned	c
the	c
chance	c
to	c
choose	c
two	c
activities	c
from	c
you	i
list	c
.	c

Could	c
you	c
also	c
let	c
me	c
know	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
and	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
would	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
.	c

Thanking	c
you	c
in	c
anticipation	i
for	c
your	c
help	c
,	c
I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearin	i
from	c
you	c

Ka	c

The	c
aim	c
of	c
this	c
report	c
is	c
to	c
suggest	c
which	c
lessons	c
and	c
other	c
activities	c
should	c
be	c
filmed	c
to	c
make	c
a	c
short	c
video	c
about	c
daily	c
life	c
at	c
school	c
.	c

There	c
is	c
a	c
well	i
equipated	i
gym	c
where	c
students	c
of	c
all	c
ages	c
can	c
practise	c
any	c
kind	c
of	c
sport	c
in	c
their	c
free	c
time	c
.	c

You	c
can	c
sing	c
,	c
act	c
or	c
just	c
help	c
with	i
the	i
backstage	c
.	c

Taking	c
part	c
in	c
these	c
two	c
activities	c
would	c
be	c
very	c
useful	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Your	i
sincerely	c
-	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
nowdays	i
,	c
shopping	c
is	c
very	c
easy	c
and	c
in	i
the	i
same	i
time	i
very	c
hard	c
.	c

My	c
grandmother	c
thought	c
that	c
shopping	c
was	c
a	c
terrible	c
thing	c
,	i
she	i
had	i
n't	i
enough	i
money	i
to	i
buy	i
even	i
the	i
bread	i
.	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
you	c
this	c
letter	c
because	c
yesterday	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
musical	c
show	i
and	c
I	c
had	c
many	c
problems	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
demand	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

When	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
the	c
starring	i
was	c
wrong	c
because	c
it	c
said	c
that	c
act	i
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
and	i
Danny	c
Brook	c
did'n	i
act	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
another	c
actor	c
that	c
nobody	c
knew	c
,	c
"	c
Really	c
this	c
is	c
very	c
disappointing	c
"	c
.	c

Pat	c
got	c
very	c
angree	i
and	c
sad	c
.	c

Pat	c
affected	i
with	i
this	c
situation	c
told	i
Nick	c
all	c
the	i
situation	c
and	c
the	c
secret	i
of	i
the	i
class	i
.	c

At	i
the	i
beginning	i
Nick	c
got	c
angree	i
but	c
then	c
he	c
forgive	i
him	c
because	c
they	c
were	c
friend	i
and	c
each	c
of	c
one	i
can	i
trust	c
on	i
the	c
other	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
collect	i
further	c
information	c
about	c
my	c
trip	c
to	c
Camp	c
California	c
and	c
to	c
make	c
some	c
things	c
a	c
bit	c
more	i
clear	i
for	c
you	c

Firstly	c
,	c
since	c
I	c
'll	c
be	c
very	c
busy	c
during	c
the	c
next	c
three	c
months	c
due	c
to	c
my	c
job	c
's	c
demands	c
,	c
I	c
would	c

travel	c
in	c
July	c

Although	c
the	c
weather	c
may	c
not	c
be	c
friendly	i
,	c
it	c
is	c
the	c
only	c
time	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
beauty	c
of	c
the	c
camp	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
only	c
travel	c
on	i
July	c
because	c
that	c
's	c
when	c
I	c
have	c
vacations	c
from	c
school	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
a	c
couple	c
of	c
things	c
about	c
the	c
prize	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
.	c

Those	c
are	c
all	c
my	c
questions	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

That	c
was	c
n't	c
difficult	c
because	c
everybody	c
wanted	c
to	c
go	c
.	c

What	c
I	c
particularly	c
liked	c
about	c
this	c
experience	c
was	c
meeting	c
my	c
favourite	c
pop	c
group	c
and	c
talk	i
with	c
them	c
about	c
their	c
lifes	i
as	c
a	i
pop	c
group	c
.	c

I	c
also	c
enjoyed	c
being	c
able	c
to	c
work	c
as	c
a	i
team	c
with	c
both	c
all	c
the	c
members	c
of	c
the	c
club	c
and	c
the	c
BSB	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
hearing	i
from	c
you	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	i
Jane	i
Clark	c
,	c

I	c
'm	c
writting	i
you	c
a	c
letter	c
,	c
because	c
you	c
are	c
the	c
organiser	c
of	c
an	c
International	c
Arts	c
Festival	c
.	c

Most	c
of	c
the	c
events	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
were	c
good	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
feel	c
that	c
festival	i
could	c
be	c
even	c
better	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

There	c
were	c
jazz	c
,	c
rock	c
and	c
classical	c
concerts	c
,	c
but	c
some	c
concerts	i
hall	i
were	c
too	c
small	c
for	c
all	c
people	i
,	i
who	c
took	i
a	i
part	i
at	i
that	c
festival	c
.	c

There	c
were	c
also	c
plays	c
and	c
films	c
,	c
dance	c
shows	c
,	c
which	c
I	c
liked	c
the	c
most	c
,	c
art	c
exhibitions	c
and	c
talks	c
by	c
writers	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
good	c
to	c
see	c
more	c
plays	c
and	c
films	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

There	c
is	c
only	c
one	c
bad	c
fhing	i
,	c
that	c
this	c
festival	c
was	c
too	c
short	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
not	c
looking	i
foward	i
to	c

I	c
hope	c
that	c
you	c
feel	c
good	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
n't	c
seen	c
you	c
for	c
two	c
years	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
lessons	c
from	c
Monday	c
till	c
Friday	c
.	c

At	c
my	c
school	c
there	c
are	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
drawings	i
,	i
paintings	i
and	i
some	c
other	c
subjects	c
doing	i
by	c
hands	i
.	c

After	c
a	c
few	c
months	c
we	c
go	c
somewhere	c
with	c
all	c
class	i
,	c
for	c
example	c
next	i
to	i
the	i
lake	c
,	c
and	c
there	c
we	c
are	i
paintings	i
the	i
nature	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
received	i
a	i
new	i
letter	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
,	i
that	c
you	c
do	i
n't	i
forget	c
,	c
&	c
will	c
write	i
me	c
soon	c
.	c

Appart	i
from	c
that	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
delayed	c
forty	i
five	i
minutes	c
,	c
consequently	c
,	c
everybody	c
there	c
lost	c
control	c
and	c
became	c
angry	c
.	c

Therefore	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
be	c
very	c
grateful	c
if	c
you	c
-	c
the	c
manager	c
of	c
the	c
theatre	c
-	c
could	c
send	c
me	c
the	c
money	c
back	c
,	c
at	c
least	c
the	c
money	c
I	c
spent	c
on	c
the	c
ticket	c
.	c

Your	i
faithfully	c

Unfortunately	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
me	c
who	c
had	c
to	c
tell	c
Pat	c
about	c
the	c
surprise	c
.	c

Later	c
,	c
I	c
realiced	i
it	c
was	c
the	c
worst	c
thing	c
it	i
could	c
happen	c
to	c
me	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
found	c
the	c
advertisement	c
of	i
International	i
Arts	c
Festival	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
excited	c
.	c

Then	c
I	c
spent	c
two	c
days	c
at	c
the	c
festival	c
.	c

There	c
were	c
so	c
many	c
exciting	c
things	c
I	c
saw	c
,	c
such	c
as	c
stars	c
and	c
artists	c
from	c
around	c
the	c
world	c
.	c

Although	c
how	i
I	c
enjoyed	c
it	c
,	c
there	c
were	c
still	c
something	i
needed	i
to	c
be	c
improved	c
.	c

In	c
the	i
addition	c
when	i
you	c
organize	c
the	i
next	c
year	c
's	c
international	c
arts	c
festival	c
,	c
could	c
you	c
arrange	c
more	c
plays	c
and	c
films	c
.	i

This	c
remind	i
me	c
of	c
what	c
I	c
experienced	c
during	c
my	c
teeenage	i
.	i

These	i
always	c
annoy	c
the	c
school	i
teacher	i
and	c
parents	i
.	c

They	c
had	i
to	c
finish	c
homework	c
in	i
a	c
limited	c
time	c
.	c

They	c
cannot	c
oppose	i
to	i
the	c
teacher	c
,	c
girls	c
are	c
not	c
allowed	c
to	c
make	i
up	i
and	i
wear	c
any	c
accessories	i
.	c

They	c
are	c
all	i
in	c
the	i
school	c
.	c

Comparing	i
to	c
my	c
experience	c
,	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
give	c
them	c
more	i
open	c
attitude	c
about	c
everything	c
.	c

I	c
want	c
to	c
be	c
a	c
mother	c
of	i
them	c
and	c
a	c
friend	c
of	i
them	c
.	c

We	c
've	c
seen	c
an	c
advertisement	c
in	c
the	c
newspapers	c
,	c
about	c
a	c
Fashion	c
exhibition	c
in	c
London	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
the	c
14	i
of	c
March	c
.	c

That	c
is	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
3	c
days	c
that	c
we	c
will	c
spent	i
in	c
London	c
as	c
a	c
college	i
.	c

So	c
we	c
had	c
this	c
great	c
idea	c
if	i
it	c
is	c
possible	c
of	c
course	c
to	i
include	i
this	c
exhibition	c
in	c
our	c
programme	c
.	c

We	c
believe	c
that	c
is	i
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
because	c
is	i
one	c
of	c
the	c
best	c
shows	c
of	c
the	c
year	c
,	i
also	i
a	i
majority	c
of	c
the	c
class	c
never	i
had	i
the	c
change	i
to	c
visit	c
a	c
show	c
as	i
this	c
and	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
and	c
best	c
part	c
is	c
that	c
the	i
admission	c
is	c
Free	c
for	c
Students	c
.	c

So	c
please	c
if	c
it	c
is	c
possible	c
to	i
make	i
a	c
small	c
change	c
to	c
the	c
programme	c
and	c
to	i
move	i
the	c
activities	c
of	c
the	i
Tuesday	i
14	i
of	c
March	c
to	c
the	c
15	i
of	c
March	c
as	i
to	c
try	c
to	c
make	i
a	i
combination	i
of	i
the	c
2	c
days	c
.	c

From	c
all	c
your	c
class	c

Thank	c
you	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
they	c
are	c
humans	c
like	c
everyone	c
else	c
,	c
so	c
yes	c
everyone	c
want	i
privacy	c
in	c
their	c
lifes	i
.	c

Becaues	c
if	c
you	c
are	c
a	c
politician	c
as	i
an	i
exmaple	i
,	c
you	c
fear	c
for	c
your	c
life	c
.	c

But	c
firstly	c
when	c
we	c
bought	c
our	c
tickets	c
,	c
we	c
did	c
n't	c
get	c
any	c
discount	c
,	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
pay	c
the	c
full	c
price	c
.	c

And	c
then	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
p.m.	c
,	c
although	c
it	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
start	c
at	c
19:30	c
p.m.	c
,	c
so	c
we	i
've	i
had	i
to	c
wait	c
quite	c
long	c
in	c
this	i
crowded	c
room	c
.	c

And	c
when	c
the	c
show	c
finally	c
started	c
,	c
I	c
realized	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
acting	c
,	c
instead	c
there	c
was	c
an	c
unknown	c
,	c
not	c
very	c
talented	c
actor	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
to	c
give	c
us	c
our	c
money	c
back	c
,	c
because	c
it	c
has	i
been	i
a	c
very	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
for	c
us	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c
Sara	c
Schmidt	c

We	c
sometimes	c
tried	c
to	c
make	i
surprise	c
parties	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
never	c
worked	c
because	c
of	c
him	c
.	c

That	c
annoyed	c
us	c
so	c
much	c
,	i
that	c
we	c
started	c
making	c
something	c
up	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
invited	c
him	c
to	c
opened	i
the	c
evening	c
with	c
me	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
end	c
I	c
just	c
told	c
him	c
the	c
truth	c
.	c

Dear	c
Ms	c
Ryan	c
Helen	c
,	c

thank	c
you	c
for	c
the	c
information	c
,	i
I	c
am	c
glad	c
I	c
've	c
won	c
first	c
prize	c
!	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
in	c
July	c
for	i
it	c
's	c
the	c
only	c
month	c
I	c
can	c
choose	c
.	c

In	c
July	c
I	c
'll	c
be	c
on	c
my	c
vacation	c
.	c

As	c
for	c
accomodation	i
I	c
prefer	i
to	c
live	i
in	c
tents	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
it	c
's	c
the	c
best	c
way	c
of	c
joining	c
nature	c
and	c
fully	c
enjoying	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
also	c
used	c
to	c
join	i
the	c
school	c
choir	c
and	c
was	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
best	c
sopranos	c
.	c

Secondly	c
I	c
truly	c
love	c
painting	c
and	c
singing	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
what	c
the	c
weather	c
is	c
like	c
in	c
California	c
in	c
July	c
to	c
be	i
aware	i
of	i
what	c
clothes	c
I	c
should	c
take	c
.	c

E.	c
Sidorov	c
.	c

I	c
enjoy	c
shopping	c
like	c
any	c
woman	c
.	c

To	c
say	c
nothing	c
about	c
his	c
or	c
her	c
giving	c
advice	c
!	c

I	c
always	c
make	c
my	c
own	c
decisions	c
!	c

That	i
are	c
the	c
reasons	c
why	c
I	c
cannot	c
go	c
on	c
your	c
trip	c
at	c
any	c
other	c
times	i
.	c

I	c
do	c
appologize	i
about	c
that	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
in	c
the	c
tennis	c
county	c
player	i
I	i
was	c
12	c
.	c

My	c
family	c
live	c
near	c
the	c
sea	c
so	c
we	c
have	i
got	i
quite	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
chance	i
to	c
go	c
climbing	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
not	c
scared	c
of	c
height	i
and	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
's	c
challenging	c
.	c

How	c
hot	c
is	c
it	c
in	c
California	c
in	c
July	c
?	c
so	i
I	c
know	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
need	c
.	c

How	c
are	c
you	c
?	c

Quess	i
what	c
I	c
've	c
done	c
!	c

I	c
've	c
been	c
helping	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
that	c
happened	i
at	c
my	c
school	c
.	c

That	c
's	c
why	c
I	c
have	i
no	c
time	c
and	c
wanted	c
you	c
to	c
be	c
there	c
with	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
will	c
tell	c
you	c
all	c
about	c
it	c
!	c

Actually	c
I	i
've	i
just	c
done	c
light	c
and	c
sound	c
in	i
drama	i
's	i
day	c
in	i
my	c
school	c
at	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
last	c
term	c
.	c

Do	c
you	c
know	c
that	c
this	c
concert	c
will	c
be	c
on	c
television	c
.	i

Then	c
we	c
started	c
to	c
talk	c
about	c
what	c
we	c
have	i
to	c
do	c
for	c
this	c
concert	c
.	c

Another	c
exciting	c
part	c
was	c
,	i
I	c
had	c
to	c
climb	c
to	c
put	c
the	c
lights	c
up	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
good	c
fun	c
though	c
!	c
,	i
but	i
my	c
friend	c
did	c
n't	c
like	c
doing	c
that	c
at	c
all	c
.	c

My	c
teacher	c
was	c
very	c
proud	c
of	c
me	c
because	c
after	c
the	c
concert	c
,	c
all	c
the	c
staff	c
were	c
saying	c
how	c
helpful	c
I	c
was	c
and	c
so	c
on	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
organising	c
a	c
nice	c
programme	c
for	c
us	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
there	c
is	c
something	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
.	c

Everyone	c
in	c
the	c
class	c
wishes	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
London	c
fashion	c
and	c
leisure	c
show	c
which	c
will	c
be	c
held	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
14th	c
March	c
from	c
10	c
a.m.	c
to	c
7	c
p.m.	c
In	i
the	c
show	c
,	c
we	c
will	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
latest	c
fashion	i
,	i
leisure	i
and	i
sports	i
wear	i
,	c
make	i
up	i
and	c
hairstyles	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
if	c
we	c
could	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
Museum	c
by	c
using	c
the	c
free	c
time	c
on	c
15th	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
okay	c
although	c
we	c
could	c
not	c
go	c
shopping	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
shortly	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
horrible	c
day	c
,	c
the	c
day	c
I	c
had	i
left	i
my	c
key	c
at	c
home	c
!	c

There	c
was	c
nobody	c
to	c
let	c
me	c
in	c
,	c
noway	i
to	c
contact	c
with	i
my	c
parents	c
.	c

I	c
managed	c
to	c
do	c
that	c
although	c
I	c
cut	c
my	c
knee	c
!	c

16.12.00	c

However	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
it	c
could	c
be	c
better	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
rearrange	c
little	i
details	c
.	c

Another	c
point	c
which	c
I	c
think	c
was	c
ennoying	i
,	i
are	i
the	c
concert	c
halls	i
.	c

The	c
plays	c
and	c
the	c
films	c
were	c
really	c
great	c
.	c

I	c
believe	c
that	c
next	c
year	c
will	c
be	c
better	c
if	c
you	c
consider	c
my	c
ideas	c
.	c

16.12.00	c

I	c
'm	c
really	c
tired	c
of	c
the	c
rules	c
in	c
school	c
!	c

The	c
general	c
rules	c
which	c
are	c
used	c
in	c
all	c
schools	c
are	c
n't	c
so	c
strict	c
however	i
there	c
are	c
a	c
few	c
things	c
that	c
need	c
to	c
be	c
changed	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
if	i
you	c
do	c
n't	c
come	c
to	c
school	c
10	i
days	c
in	c
a	c
year	c
we	i
fail	c
that	c
year	c
.	c

However	c
there	c
is	c
one	c
thing	c
that	c
my	c
parents	c
do	c
n't	c
like	c
me	c
to	c
do	c
.	c

So	c
just	c
do	c
n't	c
think	c
about	c
them	c
.	c

I	c
imagine	c
I	c
could'n	i
sleep	c
at	c
all	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
play	c
basketball	c
and	c
tennis	c
at	c
the	c
Camp	c
.	c

What	c
kind	i
of	c
clothes	c
are	c
suitable	c
to	c
take	c
with	c
me	c
and	c
could	i
I	i
have	i
any	i
benefit	i
from	i
you	i
for	i
my	i
trip	i
or	i
not	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
receiving	c
your	c
reply	c
soon	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Dear	c
Kim	c

Kim	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
my	c
wonderful	c
experience	c
last	c
month	c
!	c

I	i
did	i
a	i
part	i
of	i
gard	i
job	i
.	i

I	c
stood	c
up	c
in	c
front	c
of	c
audiences	i
and	c
I	i
had	i
given	i
an	i
attention	i
to	i
them	i
.	c

I	c
could	c
n't	c
see	c
'	c
Hikaru	c
'	c
but	c
I	c
still	c
could	c
hear	c
her	c
songs	c
.	c

I	c
thought	c
if	c
you	c
were	c
here	c
I	c
could	c
really	c
enjoy	c
with	i
you	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
glad	c

the	c
Competition	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
:	c

If	c
you	c
ever	c
know	c
of	c
a	c
concert	c
that	c
needs	c
volunteers	c
tell	c
me	c
,	c
I	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

Indeed	c
,	c
I	c
recently	c
spent	c
a	c
week	c
's	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
and	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
to	c
see	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
disappointed	c
to	c
see	c
that	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
announced	c
on	c
your	c
advertisement	c
,	c
did	c
not	c
act	c
in	c
this	c
show	c
.	c

Indeed	c
,	c
he	c
was	c
replaced	c
by	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
for	c
this	c
evening	c
.	c

Additionally	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
instead	c
of	c
19:30	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
pay	c
the	c
full	c
price	c
for	c
my	c
ticket	c
as	c
no	c
discount	c
was	c
available	c
.	c

Therefore	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
for	i
refunding	i
me	c
my	c
entrance	c
fee	c
,	c
as	c
this	c
evening	c
did	c
not	c
correspond	c
to	c
your	c
advertisement	c
.	c

Science	c
and	c
technology	c
have	c
played	c
an	c
important	c
role	c
for	c
the	c
last	c
twenty	c
years	c
and	c
the	c
development	c
of	c
the	i
modern	c
technology	c
has	c
especially	c
affected	c
our	c
lives	c
.	c

This	c
latter	i
is	c
a	c
new	c
media	i
which	c
has	c
changed	c
my	c
life	c
,	c
as	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
marvellous	c
tool	c
to	i
communicate	i
,	c
learn	i
or	c
have	i
fun	c
.	c

Until	c
I	c
have	i
had	i
one	c
,	c
I	c
was	i
often	c
run	c
out	c
of	c
cash	c
and	c
had	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
bank	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
rather	c
be	i
accomodationed	i
in	c
log	i
cabins	i
than	c
go	i
in	c
tens	i
.	c

Thirsthly	i
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
swimming	i
and	c
playing	i
tennis	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
practising	i
them	i
since	c
I	c
was	c
I	c
child	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
I	c
very	i
good	c
in	i
each	c
other	i
.	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
be	c
grateful	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
tell	c
me	c
what	c
type	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Sorry	c
for	c
not	c
writing	c
you	i
before	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
so	c
busy	c
,	c
because	c
last	c
weak	i
I	c
went	c
to	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
to	c
help	c
the	c
singers	c
.	c

A	c
few	c
minutes	c
later	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
and	c
the	c
grup	i
appeared	c
on	c
the	c
stage	c
.	c

Write	c
me	i
soon	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
,	c

Firstly	c
,	c
concerning	c
actors	i
,	c
in	c
your	c
advertisement	c
you	c
stated	c
that	c
DANNY	c
BROOK	c
AND	c
TINA	c
TRUELOVE	c
would	c
perform	c
in	c
the	c
musical	c
,	c
but	c
in	c
fact	c
different	c
actors	c
performed	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
really	c
angry	c
!	c

I	c
had	c
to	c
buy	c
an	c
adult	c
ticket	c
for	c
my	c
child	c
and	c
spent	c
more	c
money	c
than	c
I	c
had	c
expected	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
sure	c
you	c
can	c
imagine	c
what	c
I	c
felt	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
not	c
perfect	i
evening	c
for	c
me	c
and	c
my	c
child	c
at	c
all	c
!	c

I	c
am	c
also	c
sure	c
you	c
can	c
refund	c
my	c
money	c
.	c

Dear	c

I	c
did	c

That	c
's	c
the	c
advantage	c

You	c
have	c
to	c
try	c
once	i
in	c
your	c
life	c

if	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c

After	c
the	c
discussion	c
that	c
we	c
had	c
in	c
the	c
english	i

,	c
I	c
understood	c
that	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
people	c
sometimes	c
do	c
n't	c
enjoy	c
during	i
the	i
shopping	c

In	c
fact	c
if	c
I	c
'm	c
not	c
in	c
the	c
right	c
mood	c
I	c
become	c
nervous	i

I	c
ca	c
n't	c
find	c

in	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

Last	c
week	c
,	c
I	c
had	i
visited	i
your	c
theatre	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
disappointed	c
because	c
I	c
did	c
not	c
have	c
a	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
like	c
what	i
advertisement	i
said	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
complain	c
four	i
things	c
about	i
your	c
theatre	c
.	c

Second	c
thing	c
,	c
you	c
should	c
open	c
the	c
show	c
on	c
time	c
because	c
if	c
the	c
audience	c
have	c
to	c
wait	c
,	c
they	c
will	c
not	c
feel	c
happy	i
but	i
I	c
think	c
you	c
know	c
that	c
.	c

To	c
conclude	c
,	c
your	c
theatre	c
is	c
not	i
good	i
like	i
what	i
advertisement	i
said	i
so	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
for	c
some	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

But	c
we	c
ca	c
n't	c
stop	c
to	i

a	c

I	c

I	c
think	c
a	i
time	c

Dear	c

In	c
addition	c
to	c
this	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
did	c
not	c
start	c
on	c
time	c
,	c
19:30	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
wait	c
for	c
45	c
minutes	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
when	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
I	c
found	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

Because	c
its	c
opening	c
time	c
was	c
from	c
10:00	c
to	c
17:00	c
.	c

Thanking	c
for	i
your	c
prompt	c
attention	c

So	c
,	c
now	c
I	c
would	c
rather	c
send	c
the	i
e-mail	c
than	c
the	i
letter	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
prefer	c
to	c
surf	c
the	c
Internet	c
when	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
find	c
something	c

Jun.	c
2000	c
Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
pleased	c
to	c
hear	c
that	c
I	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
the	c
competition	c
.	c

You	c
may	c
only	c
get	c
tired	c
on	i
your	i
feet	c
.	c

Sometimes	c
,	c
a	c
moment	c
comes	c
up	i
that	c
you	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
buy	c
something	c
you	c
have	c
not	c
wanted	c
because	c
while	c
you	c
are	c
shopping	c
,	c
you	c
might	c
get	c
something	c
beautiful	c
or	c
good	c
to	c
you	c
.	c

So	c
you	c
would	i
spend	c
more	c
money	c
you	i
have	i
expected	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
so	c
surprised	c
but	c
so	c
glad	c
to	c
read	c
that	c
I	c
won	i
the	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
.	c

In	c
response	c
to	c
your	c
question	c
and	c
if	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
mind	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
I	c
've	c
already	c
chosen	i
my	c
holiday	c
and	c
my	c
boss	c
wo	c
n't	c
give	c
me	c
another	c
one	c
.	c

I	c
like	c
very	i
much	i
the	i
moutains	i
and	c
would	c
particularly	c
enjoy	c
painting	c
them	c
after	c
a	c
walk	c
.	c

I	c
've	c
got	c
four	c
children	c
and	c
have	c
to	c
organise	c
their	c
time	c
without	c
mother	i
.	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
exactly	c
which	i
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
with	c
and	i
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	i
'll	i
be	i
supposed	i
to	c
spend	c
there	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
really	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
a	c
mother	c
of	c
four	c
children	i
and	c
you	c
can	c
easily	c
imagine	c
how	c
many	c
things	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
buy	c
in	c
a	c
week	c
.	c

When	c
you	c
're	c
shopping	c
,	c
you	c
can	c
finally	c
relax	c
,	c
just	c
admiring	c
what	c
you	i
're	i
seeing	i
.	c

To	c
be	c
fair	c
,	c
I	c
must	c
say	c
that	c
I	c
've	c
noticed	c
one	c
disadvantage	i
on	i
shopping	c
:	c
you	c
need	c
money	c
!	c

You	c
'll	c
understand	c
,	c
I	c
'm	c
sure	c
,	c
that	i
I	c
prefer	c
shopping	c
at	c
the	c
beginning	c
of	c
every	c
month	c
.	c

Our	c
English	c
class	c
has	c
an	c
additional	c
wish	c
concerning	c
the	c
programme	c
of	i
our	c
trip	c
.	c

We	c
have	c
seen	c
an	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
"	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
"	c
and	c
we	c
would	c
all	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

We	c
would	c
suggest	c
to	i
replace	i
the	c
shopping	c
part	i
on	c
Tuesday	c
afternoon	c
by	i
the	c
visit	c
of	i
the	c
show	c
.	c

We	c
think	c
we	c
would	c
all	c
have	c
another	c
chance	c
for	c
shopping	c
in	c
London	c
sometimes	i
later	c
.	c

We	c
are	c
sure	c
this	c
is	c
suitable	c
to	i
all	c
of	c
us	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
.	c

The	c
home	c
of	c
the	c
future	c

The	c
houses	c
will	c
look	c
like	c
the	c
houses	c
today	i
.	c

A	c
simple	c
and	c
well-proofen	i
architecture	c
.	c

The	c
difference	c
will	c
be	c
inside	c
the	c
buildings	c
.	c

The	c
doors	c
would	c
be	c
the	c
entrance	c
to	c
another	c
world	c
....	c

The	c
fridge	c
,	c
the	c
television	c
,	c
the	c
stove	c
and	c
the	c
Hi-Fi	i
equipment	c
will	c
be	c
attached	c
to	c
a	c
computer	c
network	c
.	c

Every	c
electronic	c
gadget	c
in	c
the	c
futur	i
home	c
will	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
comunicate	i
with	c
other	c
machines	c
or	c
computers	c
.	c

Also	c
the	c
aspects	c
of	c
security	c
within	c
people	c
's	c
homes	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
think	c
there	c
will	c
not	c
be	c
many	c
changes	c
concerning	c
the	c
furnishing	c
of	c
the	c
future	c
homes	c
.	c

I	c
want	c
to	c
say	c
thank	c
you	c
that	i
I	i
was	i
the	c
lucky	c
person	c
who	c
won	c
that	c
competition	c
.	c

You	c
want	c
to	i
know	i
some	c
further	c
information	c
from	c
me	c

About	c
the	c
date	c
,	i
when	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
travel	c
can	i
I	c
say	c
that	c
it	c
is	c
only	c
possible	c
for	c
me	c
on	i
July	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
do	c
some	c
exams	c
at	c
the	i
school	c
.	c

In	c
basketball	c
I	c
have	c
more	i
practise	i
then	i
in	c
tennis	c
.	c

I	c
play	c
every	c
weekend	c
on	i
competitions	c
with	c
my	c
local	c
team	c
and	c
about	i
tennis	i
it	i
is	i
that	i
I	i
tried	i
but	i
it	i
is	i
not	i
like	i
my	i
basketball	i
experience	i
.	c

Please	c
write	c
me	i
your	i
answer	c
as	c
quick	i
as	c
possible	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
Kim	i
you	i
was	i
not	c
too	c
jealous	c
about	c
that	c
,	c
sorry	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
the	c
prize	c
.	c

I	c
turned	i
crazy	c
when	c
I	c
knew	c
I	c
was	c
the	c
winner	c
of	c
your	c
competition	c
.	c

I	c
've	c
never	c
been	c
in	i
the	c
States	c
before	c
and	c
having	c
the	c
chance	c
to	c
do	c
it	i
so	c
makes	c
me	c
real	i
happy	c
.	c

Definitely	c
,	c
in	c
July	c
.	c

That	c
's	c
my	c
only	c
month	c
for	c
holidays	c
in	c
the	c
whole	c
year	c
.	c

That	c
's	c
the	c
best	i
suitable	c
accomodation	i
for	c
a	c
camping	c
.	i

Please	c
,	c
let	c
me	c
know	c
.	c

My	c
only	c
role	c
was	c
to	c
carry	c
things	c
from	c
one	c
place	c
to	c
another	c
.	c

Well	c
,	c
some	c
others	c
helped	c
me	c
in	i
the	c
task	c
,	c
but	c
that	c
did	c
not	c
make	c
it	c
much	c
easier	c
.	c

The	c
part	c
I	c
enjoyed	c
most	c
was	c
the	c
one	c
when	c
they	c
paid	c
me	c
.	c

Next	c
time	c
come	c
with	c
me	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Ryan	c
!	c

You	c
asked	c
me	c
few	c
questions	c
in	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

I	c
can	c
come	c
to	c
USA	c
on	i
July	c
becouse	i
on	i
August	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
working	c
with	c
my	c
father	c
.	c

We	c
are	c
building	c
a	c
new	c
house	c
for	c
our	c
family	c
.	c

Tent	i
will	c
be	c
more	i
cooler	i
to	c
sleep	c
then	i
the	i
cabin	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
a	c
life	c
guard	c
and	c
I	c
could	c
work	c
in	c
your	c
camp	c
as	c
a	c
rescuer	c
next	c
summer	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
qustions	i
to	i
.	c

How	c
much	c
money	c
should	c
I	c
take	c
with	c
me	c
and	c
what	c
sort	c
of	c
clothes	c
are	c
requested	i

Shoping	i
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
the	c
worst	c
side	c
of	c
shopping	c
in	c
Poland	c
couple	i
years	i
ago	c
.	c

Polish	c
super	i
market	i
are	c
not	c
Polish	i
origin	i
shops	c
.	c

I	c
apprieciate	i
this	i
shops	c
for	c
lots	c
of	c
products	c
,	c
cheep	i
prices	c
end	i
big	c
spaces	c
.	c

On	c
Friedy	i
evening	c
and	c
at	i
on	c
the	c
weekdays	c
each	i
supermarkets	c
are	c
crowded	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
not	c
like	c
crowded	c
places	c
.	c

And	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
we	c
did	c
n't	c
know	c
what	c
to	c
do	c
with	c
the	c
rest	c
of	c
the	c
evening	c
,	c
because	c
we	c
actually	c
wanted	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
Theatre	c
Restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
n't	c
realy	i
a	c
perfect	c
evening	c
like	i
you	c
promised	c
on	c
your	c
flyer	c
.	c

I	c
will	c
tell	c
everyone	c
I	c
know	c
how	c
bad	c
it	c
was	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c
Franz	c
Morell	c
Hand	c

Today	c
,	c
everyone	c
has	c
the	c
opertunity	i
to	c
just	c
get	c
into	c
a	c
car	c
and	c
drive	c
to	i
where	i
ever	i
they	c
want	c
to	c
.	c

This	c
also	i
is	i
a	c
very	c
big	c
disatvantage	i
because	c
many	c
people	c
are	c
losing	c
thier	i
jobs	c
.	c

The	c
only	c
and	c
simple	c
advantage	c
of	c
modern	c
technology	c
is	c
just	c
taking	c
the	c
work	c
from	c
us	c
so	c
we	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
to	c
do	c
anything	c
anymore	c
.	c

Another	c
disadvantage	c
is	c
that	c
every	i
one	i
becomes	c
a	c
bit	c
more	c
lonely	c
because	c
they	c
wath	i
TV	c
or	c
play	c
or	c
work	c
with	i
the	c
Computer	c
and	c
do	c
n't	c
see	c
each	c
other	c
any	i
more	i
because	c
they	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
to	c
.	c

One	c
of	c
the	c
reason	i
I	c
went	c
to	c
see	c
that	c
particular	c
show	c
,	i
was	c
the	c
starring	c
actor	c
announced	i
in	c
the	c
add	i
,	i
Danny	i
Brook	c
,	c
but	c
when	c
the	c
show	c
actually	c
started	c
,	c
with	i
forty	i
five	i
minutes	i
delay	c
,	c
I	c
realized	c
that	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
was	c
not	c
in	c
the	c
play	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
for	c
these	c
reasons	c
that	c
I	c
expect	c
a	c
full	c
refund	c
of	c
the	c
ticket	c
prize	i
,	i
it	i
is	c
my	c
right	c
as	c
a	c
paying	c
customer	c
to	c
get	c
what	c
I	c
have	c
paid	c
for	c
.	c

Internet	i
,	c
I	c
think	c
,	c
is	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
inventions	c
in	c
the	c
history	c
of	c
humanity	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
really	c
surprised	c
about	c
the	c
free	c
journey	i
to	c
California	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
've	c
never	c
ever	c
won	c
anything	c
before	c
.	c

For	c
one	c
night	c
it	c
would	c
not	c
disturb	i
me	c
to	c
sleep	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
,	c
but	c
for	c
a	c
period	c
of	c
two	c
weeks	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
too	c
uncomfortable	c
.	c

As	c
the	c
second	c
activity	c
I	c
have	c
chosen	c
to	c
make	i
photos	c
.	c

Once	c
you	c
've	c
found	c
you	i
should	c
take	c
everything	c
you	c
like	c
and	c
go	c
into	c
the	c
cabin	i
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
it	c
ought	c
to	c
start	c
at	c
19:30	c
but	c
it	c
really	c
started	c
at	c
20:30	c
.	c

After	c
the	c
show	c
I	c
intended	c
to	c
visit	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
as	i
you	c
have	i
known	i
that	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
late	c
,	c
therefore	i
the	c
restaurant	c
had	c
closed	c
before	c
the	c
show	c
finished	c
.	c

As	i
I	i
have	i
informed	i
you	i
all	i
the	i
fact	i
,	c
I	c
think	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
not	c
worth	c
the	c
money	c
I	c
paid	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
want	c
the	i
refund	c
for	i
£	c
15	c

The	c
story	c
begins	c
when	c
Jan	c
,	c
who	c
was	c
Pat	c
's	c
best	c
friend	c
,	c
told	c
Pat	c
that	c
she	c
saw	c
Tim	c
when	c
he	c
was	c
cheating	c
the	i
exam	c
.	c

The	c
next	c
day	c
,	c
Pat	c
told	c
everybody	c
what	c
she	c
had	c
heard	c
from	c
Jan	c
,	c
so	c
when	c
the	c
news	c
came	c
to	c
teachers	i
'	c
ears	c
,	c
the	c
teachers	c
decided	c
to	c
give	c
Tim	c
grade	i
F	c
in	c
that	c
subject	c
and	c
tell	c
his	c
parents	c
!	c
!	c

Her	c
parents	c
have	c
been	c
so	c
upset	c
that	c
they	c
have	c
asked	c
the	c
school	c
to	c
help	c
thier	i
child	c
and	c
that	c
is	c
the	c
reason	c
why	c
I	c
'm	c
writing	c
this	c
story	c

Favorite	i

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
,	c
in	i
the	i
name	i
of	i
all	c
the	c
students	c
in	c
my	c
class	c
,	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
about	c
our	c
wish	c
to	c
change	c
the	c
London	i
's	i
programme	c
.	c

We	c
suggest	c
to	i
go	i
to	c
the	c
show	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
afternoon	c
instead	c
of	c
going	c
shopping	c
(	c
thing	i
that	c
we	c
can	c
do	c
on	c
Wednesday	c
afternoon	c
,	c
in	c
our	c
free	c
time	c
)	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
will	c
consider	c
our	c
request	c

We	c
had	c
walked	c
for	c
three	c
hours	c
(	c
my	c
mother	c
,	c
my	c
two	c
brother	i
and	c
I	c
)	c
through	c
the	c
humid	c
and	c
noisy	c
jungle	c
,	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
reach	i
a	c
small	c
but	c
clean	c
house	c
where	c
a	c
nice	c
and	c
friendly	c
family	c
,	c
old	c
friends	c
of	c
us	i
,	c
used	c
to	c
live	c
.	c

My	c
mother	c
and	c
brothers	c
had	c
already	c
crossed	c
the	c
river	c
,	c
and	c
they	c
were	c
encouraging	c
me	c
to	c
do	c
the	c
same	c
from	c
the	c
other	c
side	c
of	c
it	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
was	c
paralysed	c
with	c
fear	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
easier	c
than	c
I	c
had	c
thought	c
!	c
.	i

I	c
was	c
very	c
pleased	c
to	c
hear	c
that	c
.	c

I	c
never	c
could	c
sleep	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
in	c
my	c
life	c
.	c

It	c
would	c
be	c
grateful	i
if	c
I	c
could	c
go	c
swimming	c
during	c
the	c
stays	i
.	c

Although	c
shopping	c
is	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
most	c
popular	c
ways	c
to	c
reduce	c
your	c
stress	c
,	c
this	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
the	c
case	c
.	c

That	c
's	c
a	i
hell	c
!	c
!	c

You	c
need	c
to	c
go	c
home	c
with	c
bulky	c
bags	c
in	c
both	c
of	c
your	c
hands	c
!	c
!	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
although	c
there	c
is	c
certainly	c
a	c
good	c
side	c
of	i
shopping	c
,	c
such	c
as	c
pleasures	i
of	c
getting	c
new	c
stuff	c
and	c
spending	c
money	c
on	c
something	c
you	c
really	c
wanted	c
for	c
long	i
time	c
,	c
you	c
also	c
have	c
some	c
unpleasant	c
moments	c
to	c
get	c
through	c

Filming	c
about	i
life	c
at	c
school	c
mean	i
filming	c
students	i
acts	i
and	c
behaveare	i
.	c

We	c
need	c
to	c
show	c
what	c
students	i
interests	c
in	i
and	c
which	c
subject	i
are	i
interested	c
.	i

It	c
is	c
very	c
interesting	c
and	c
fun	c
with	i
the	i
experement	i
.	c

We	c
can	c
see	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
interest	i
faces	c
on	i
the	c
students	c
wile	i
we	c
filming	i
them	c
.	c

Also	c
it	c
not	i
a	c
very	c
easy	c
subject	c
so	c
we	c
can	c
capture	c
other	c
students	i
faces	c
in	c
confuse	i
and	c
puzzal	i

We	c
can	c
also	c
film	c
life	c
after	c
school	c

After	c
school	c
activities	c
is	i
one	c
of	c
the	c
main	c
thing	i
in	c
school	c
.	c

I	c
went	c
in	c
for	c
your	c
competition	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
really	c
anxious	c
about	c

I	c
can	c
reasure	i
you	c
that	c
gradually	i
I	i
am	i
improving	c
my	c
sports	c
skills	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
which	i
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
do	i
I	c
have	i
to	i
bring	i
with	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
also	c
wondering	c
if	c
I	c
will	c
need	c
any	c
money	c
.	c

Can	c
you	c
imagine	c
?	c

Apart	c
from	c
these	i
we	i
were	c
mainly	c
helping	c
the	c
singers	c
to	c
be	i
prepared	i
for	c
the	c
concert	c
.	c

Anyway	c
the	c
result	c
of	c
the	c
whole	c
preparation	c
is	c
far	i
more	c
enjoyable	c
and	c
relaxing	c
.	c

Looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c

I	c
have	i
visited	i
your	c
theater	i
and	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
dissapointed	i
because	i
of	i
the	i
number	c
of	c
reasons	c
.	c

I	c
've	c
read	c
your	c
advertisment	i
and	c
in	i
reality	c
to	i
what	i
was	i
written	i
there	i
was	i
different	i
.	c

There	c
was	c
no	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
but	c
instead	c
of	c
him	c
was	i
a	c
different	c
actor	c
and	c
I	c
'm	c
very	c
dissapointed	i
about	c
it	i
because	c
I	c
'm	c
his	i
fan	i
.	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
realy	i
bad	c
evening	c
and	c
because	c
of	c
it	i
could	c
you	c
possibly	c
give	c
my	i
money	c
back	c
?	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

But	c
when	c
I	c
came	c
to	c
this	c
school	c
a	c
few	c
months	c
ago	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
know	c
this	c
.	c

So	c
one	c
day	c
she	c
offered	i
to	i
me	c
to	c
come	c
to	c
her	c
house	c
at	c
night	c
and	c
to	c
do	c
so	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
run	c
away	c
from	c
our	c
boarding	c
house	c
and	c
that	c
was	c
illigal	i
.	c

Unfortunately	c
for	c
me	c
Pat	c
at	c
the	c
time	c
went	i
to	c
toilet	i
and	c
saw	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
your	i
advertisement	c
about	i
the	c
"	c
London	c
Fashion	c
"	c
and	c
"	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
"	c
.	c

But	c
there	c
is	c
a	c
problem	c
which	c
I	c
hope	c
you	c
can	c
solve	c
.	c

The	c
point	c
is	c
,	c
The	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
show	c
will	c
be	c
fantastic	c
.	c

In	c
your	c
advertisement	c
,	c
you	c
had	i
written	c
"	c
The	c
show	c
will	c
be	c
help	i
in	c
Central	i
Exhibition	c
hall	c
in	c
London	c
,	i
it	i
starts	i
from	c
10	c
am	c
to	c
7	c
pm	c
on	c
14th	c
March	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
wonder	c
if	c
the	c
timetable	c
could	c
change	i
,	c
which	c
will	i
be	c
perfect	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
it	c
does	c
n't	c
make	i
some	i
trouble	c
if	c
you	c
accept	c
my	c
suggestion	c
.	c

your	i
sincerely	c
,	c

So	c
I	c
must	c
find	c
out	i
a	c
solution	i
which	i
can	i
help	i
my	c
great	c
father	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
decide	i
to	c
join	c
the	i
dangerous	c
game	c
,	c
which	c
will	i
lost	i
everything	c
or	c
suddenly	c
become	i
millionaire	i
.	c

With	c
luck	c
,	c
I	c
was	i
won	i
by	i
chance	i
.	c

I	c
said	c
to	c
myself	c
again	i
.	c

Our	c
class	c
is	c
very	c
appritiate	i
you	c
for	c
the	c
good	i
programme	c
.	c

We	c
suggest	c
changing	c
our	c
programme	c
a	c
little	c
bit	c
.	c

And	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
we	c
will	c
enjoy	c
the	c
London	c
fasion	i
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
till	c
19.00	c
.	c

What	c
does	c
it	c
means	c
?	c

From	i
my	i
point	i
of	i
view	i
,	c
these	c
are	c
the	c
people	c
,	i
who	c
stay	c
all	i
time	i
in	i
our	i
sigh	i
.	c

We	c
intrsted	i
in	c
politicians	i
's	i
and	c
film	c
stars	i
's	i
wear	i
,	c
hobbys	i
,	c

and	c
the	i

The	i

of	c
the	i
journalists	c
following	c
them	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
,	c
even	i
in	i
there	i
private	i
life	i
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
each	c
human	c
being	c
has	c
rights	i
to	c
be	c
free	c
.	c

Why	c
everybody	i
must	i
know	c
and	c
tolk	i
about	c
their	c
private	c
life	c
?	c

17	c
June	c
,	c
2000	c

I	c
was	c
not	c
satified	i
with	c
the	c
show	c
at	c
all	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
very	c
different	c
from	c
the	c
information	i
your	c
advertisement	c
had	c
stated	i
.	c

What	c
is	c
worse	c
,	c
the	c
ticket	c
price	c
was	c
not	c
reduced	c
despite	c
the	c
fact	c
that	c
I	c
showed	c
my	c
student	c
ID	c
.	c

Visiting	c
your	c
theatre	c
should	c
have	c
been	c
the	c
most	c
pleasant	c
time	i
during	c
my	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
known	c
that	c
but	c
I	c
told	i
my	i
secret	i
to	i
her	i
,	c
which	c
was	c
a	c
big	c
mistake	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
I	i
must	c
say	c
that	c
"	c
over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
"	c
is	c
not	c
the	i
London	i
newest	c
and	c
best	c
musical	c
show	c
,	c
for	c
many	c
reasons	c
:	c

I	c
want	c
the	i
money	c
back	c
,	i
if	i
you	c
do	c
n't	c
give	c
it	c
to	i
me	i
back	i
,	c
I	c
will	i
intend	c
to	c
write	c
to	c
the	c
press	c
and	c
explain	i
everything	c
,	c
and	c
of	c
course	c
I	c
wo	c
n't	c
be	c
the	c
only	c
one	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
so	c
furious	c
because	c
when	c
I	c
asked	c
for	c
money	i
back	c
that	c
day	c
,	c
the	c
sir	i
was	c
n't	c
able	c
to	c
give	c
it	c
back	c
because	c
he	c
would	c
be	c
sack	i
.	c

yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

The	c
only	c
problem	c
was	c
that	c
the	c
girl	c
was	c
to	i
shy	c
to	c
speak	c
to	c
him	c
,	c
she	c
wanted	c
to	c
keep	c
her	c
name	c
in	i
secret	c
,	c
and	c
if	c
Pat	c
tells	i
someone	c
something	c
about	c
the	c
letter	c
,	c
she	c
wo	i
n't	i
say	c
who	c
is	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
disappointed	c
,	c
and	c
if	c
it	c
is	c
possible	c
,	c
I	c
want	c
you	c
to	c
return	c
my	c
money	c
back	i
.	c

I	c
hope	c
that	c
the	c
next	c
time	c
you	c
will	c
do	i
a	c
better	c
show	c
than	c
the	c
last	c
one	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
the	c
enviroment	i
is	c
polluted	c
because	c
of	c
technology	c
,	c
although	c
is	i
our	c
fault	c
.	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
technology	c
it	i
's	i
the	c
best	c
thing	c
around	i
the	c
world	c
,	c
apart	c
from	c
T.V	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c
Madam	c
,	c

Last	c
Sunday	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
disappointed	c
it	i
.	c

It	i
wase	i
n't	i
!	c
!	c
!	c

I	c
had	c
the	i
very	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
so	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
for	c
return	i
my	c
money	c
.	i

I	c
am	c
hearing	i
to	i
looking	i
fermards	i
from	c
you	c
.	c

Ilya	c
V	c
.	c

I	c
told	c
to	i
her	c
about	c
my	c
pregnency	i
because	c
she	c
has	c
friend	i
who	c
works	c
in	c
a	c
hospital	c
as	c
a	c
doctor	c
.	c

In	i
a	c
week	c
time	i
my	c
classmates	c
and	c
teachers	c
started	c
to	i
toking	i
from	i
me	c
.	c

I	c
understand	i
who	c
told	i
my	c
secret	c
to	c
everyone	c
.	c

My	c
family	c
very	i
love	i
him	i
and	i
support	c
us	c
.	c

First	c
tell	c
to	i
your	c
parents	c
.	c

Ofcoure	i
secrets	c
can	c
be	c
different	c
...	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
more	c
comfortable	c
than	c
a	c
tent	c
.	c

I	c
want	c
to	c
join	i
swimming	c
and	c
tennis	c
courses	c
.	c

I	c
won	c
a	c
prize	c
in	c
a	c
competition	c
in	c
1999	c
.	c

Do	c
I	c
need	c
any	c
special	c
clothe	i
?	c

Everybody	c
likes	c
from	i
a	c
child	c
to	c
an	c
old	c
lady	c
in	c
sixties	i
but	i
it	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

You	c
do	c
n't	c
need	c
to	c
go	c
out	c
to	c
buy	c
something	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
you	c
wo	c
n't	c
be	c
tired	c
and	c
bored	c
end	i
of	c
your	c
shopping	c
on	c
the	c
computer	c
.	c

Think	c
about	c
that	i
way	c
for	c
enjoyable	c
shopping	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs.	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
reading	i
from	c
you	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
not	c
agree	c
that	c
it	c
is	c
preferable	c
to	c
phone	c
at	i
the	c
shop	c
and	c
give	c
them	c
a	c
list	c
of	c
items	c
you	c
need	c
instead	c
of	c
going	c
to	c
the	c
shop	c
and	c
choose	i
whatever	c
you	c
want	c
.	c

Indeed	c
I	c
would	c
rather	c
to	i
travel	i
only	c
on	i
July	c
since	c
I	c
'm	c
going	c
to	c
work	c
in	c
august	i
in	c
order	c
to	c
earn	c
money	c
to	c
pay	c
my	i
studies	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

Besides	i
I	c
've	c
chosen	c
two	c
activities	c
from	c
the	c
list	c
:	c
Tennis	i
as	i
I	c
practice	i
this	c
sport	c
regularly	c
and	c
I	c
'm	c
very	c
good	c
in	i
this	c
activity	c
and	i
Golf	i
because	c
I	c
ignore	i
all	i
about	c
this	c
sport	c
and	c
I	c
wish	c
I	i
will	i
discover	i
it	c
thanks	i
to	i
you	i
.	c

As	c
you	c
have	i
already	i
know	i
,	c
your	c
English	c
class	c
is	c
going	c
to	c
make	c
a	c
short	c
video	c
about	c
daily	c
life	c
at	c
your	c
school	c
,	i
that	i
's	i
why	c
I	c
'm	c
writing	c
a	c
report	c
suggesting	c
which	c
,	i
lessons	c
and	c
other	c
activities	c
,	i
should	c
be	c
filmed	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
he	i
seems	c
obvious	c
that	c
we	c
should	c
,	c
at	c
least	c
once	c
,	c
film	c
a	c
lesson	c
with	c
our	c
English	c
teacher	c
who	c
have	i
had	i
the	c
idea	c
to	c
make	c
this	c
short	c
video	c
.	c

At	c
the	c
end	c
,	c
to	i
my	i
opinion	i
,	c
It	i
would	c
be	c
interesting	c
to	c
film	c
a	c
course	i
of	i
sport	i
in	c
order	c
that	c
our	c
parents	c
realise	c
that	c
we	c
improve	c
our	c
body	i
's	i
abilities	c
,	c
and	c
not	c
only	c
our	c
brain	i
's	i
abilities	c
at	c
school	c
.	c

Dear	c

Very	i
Fun	i

feel	i
romatic	i
,	i
you	i
should	i
think	i
something	i
like	i
this	i

but	c
do	c
you	c

not	c
always	c

When	c

but	c
you	c
are	c
not	c
interesting	i
of	i
that	c

romatic	i

no	c
!	c

If	c
you	c
go	c
out	c
with	c
your	c

that	c
should	c
be	c
fine	c

everytime	i
go	i
to	c
the	c
same	c
place	c

everyone	c
will	c

Mr.	c

give	c
you	c
,	i
and	c
the	c
others	c
in	c
the	c
class	c
my	c
opinion	c
(	c
for	i
the	c
video	c
that	c
you	c
are	c
going	c
to	c
do	i
)	c
about	c
which	c
lessons	c
and	c
other	c
activities	c
should	c
be	c
filmed	c
and	c
why	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
advertisement	c
of	i
the	c
show	c
was	i
written	c
that	c
the	c
musical	c
will	i
be	i
start	c
at	c
19:30	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
give	i
no	i
money	c
back	c
,	c
I	c
will	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
newspaper	c

faithfully	c

At	i
first	i
I	c
would	i
say	c
that	c
our	c
technology	i
level	i
,	i
in	i
this	i
time	i
are	i
very	c
high	c
but	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
it	c
would	i
be	c
higher	c
.	c

With	c
the	c
help	c
of	c
my	c
home	c
computer	c
I	c
can	c
do	c
all	c
thing	i
,	c
about	i
money	c
,	c
with	c
my	c
bank	c
.	c

Some	c
years	c
ago	c
I	c
have	i
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
bank	c
.	c

The	c
new	c
way	c
is	c
very	c
easy	c
and	c
faster	c
and	c
I	c
can	c
spent	i
my	c
time	c
with	i
other	c
things	c
.	c

An	i
other	i
point	i
is	c
the	c
modern	c
technology	c
in	c
my	c
car	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
would	c
be	c
grateful	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
give	c
me	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
more	i
secure	i
and	c
there	c
is	c
no	c
problem	c
if	c
it	c
rains	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
been	c
climbing	c
for	c
more	c
than	c
7	c
years	c
.	c

It	c
should	c
not	c
be	c
a	c
problem	c
.	c

This	i
is	c
very	c
nice	c
when	c
you	c
can	c
do	c
your	c
shopping	c
like	c
that	c
.	c

Besides	c
,	c
when	c
you	c
want	c
to	c
pay	c
for	c
the	c
things	c
you	c
have	c
taken	i
,	c
you	c
can	c
believe	c
that	c
the	c
ladies	c
behind	c
the	c
cashdesks	i
are	c
unable	c
to	c
smile	c
.	c

After	c
that	c
,	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
carry	c
your	c
bag	c
(	c
of	c
course	c
far	c
too	c
heavy	c
for	c
you	c
)	c
to	c
your	c
car	c
.	c

When	c
you	c
are	c
at	c
home	c
,	c
there	c
is	c
no	c
reward	c
except	c
that	c
your	c
husband	c
or	c
your	c
children	c
notice	c
that	c
the	c
fridge	c
is	c
full	c
again	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
sorry	c
to	c
say	c
it	i
but	i
your	c
musical	c
show	c
was	c
very	c
disappointing	c
to	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
disappointed	c
.	c

Lot	i
of	c
things	c
that	c
you	c
have	i
written	i
at	i
the	c
advertisement	c
are	c
not	c
true	c
.	c

Everyone	c
get	c
bored	c
until	i
the	c
show	c
start	i
.	c

as	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

That	c
evening	c
was	c
n't	c
my	i
perfect	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
I	c
want	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
because	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
a	c
disaster	c
.	c

I	i

I	c

I	c
did	c

13/6/00	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
as	c
it	c
is	c
my	c
summer	c
holiday	c
and	c
is	c
the	c
most	c
convenient	c
time	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
appreciate	c
it	c
if	c
you	c
also	c
advise	i
me	c
on	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
should	c
take	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
all	c
new	c
for	c
me	c
as	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
been	c
to	c
the	c
USA	c
before	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
time	c
and	c
your	c
kind	c
effort	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
say	c
window	c
shopping	c
is	c
the	c
reason	c
why	c
I	c
have	c
no	c
money	c
now	c
.	c

Sometime	c
last	c
month	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
just	c
the	c
same	c
as	c
I	c
am	c
now	c
,	c
with	c
no	c
money	c
.	c

When	c
we	c
went	c
into	c
the	c
first	c
shop	c
,	c
I	c
caught	c
sight	c
of	c
a	c
long	c
black	c
dress	c
.	c

As	c
I	c
had	c
nothing	c
better	c
to	c
do	c
,	c
I	c
tried	c
it	c
on	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
think	c
about	c
it	c
now	c
,	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

But	c
at	i
big	i
suprise	i
I	i
saw	c
that	c
the	i
actor	i
was	i
different	i
and	i
I	c
was	c
very	c
disappointed	c
.	c

Another	c
reason	c
why	c
I	c
was	c
disappointed	c
was	c
that	c
you	c
said	c
there	c
would	c
be	c
discount	i
available	c
but	c
there	c
was	c
n't	c
.	c

At	i
last	i
I	i
was	c
waiting	i
to	c
visit	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
a	c
machine	c
was	c
broken	c
.	c

This	c
was	c
very	c
disappointing	c
.	c

After	c
a	i
big	i
confusion	c
I	i
decided	c
not	c
to	c
make	i
a	c
party	c
for	c
my	c
birthday	c
so	c
I	c
could	c
had	i
all	c
my	c
friends	c
back	c
.	c

And	c
that	c
's	c
what	i
I	i
had	i
exactly	i
done	i
even	c
if	i
I	c
stayed	i
alone	c
at	i
my	c
birthday	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
much	c
more	c
important	c
to	c
me	c
to	c
get	c
all	c
my	c
friends	c
back	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
this	c
letter	c
to	c
complain	c
how	i
terrible	c
the	c
show	c
performed	c
in	c
your	c
theatre	c
was	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
which	c
was	c
45	c
minutes	c
later	c
than	c
on	c
time	c
and	c
there	c
was	c
no	c
discount	c
for	c
the	c
ticket	c
,	c
which	c
is	c
different	c
from	c
the	c
advertisement	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

But	c
how	c
it	i
affect	c
to	i
my	c
daily	c
life	c
?	c

In	i
the	c
bus	c
or	c
even	c
in	i
the	c
tube	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
talk	c
with	c
a	c
friend	c
with	i
a	c
mobile	c
phone	c
when	c
I	c
feel	c
boaring	i
.	c

Sometimes	c
I	c
even	c
do	i
some	c
games	c
with	i
it	c
.	c

In	i
accordance	i
with	i
study	c
or	c
work	c
,	c
I	c
use	c
a	i
internet	i
,	c
which	c
is	c
the	c
easist	i
way	c
to	c
get	c
informations	i
all	i
around	c
the	c
world	c
.	c

Without	c
it	c
,	c
it	c
would	c
take	c
more	c
than	c
one	c
week	c
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
modern	c
technology	c
affects	c
a	i
lot	i
to	i
my	i
daily	i
life	i
as	c
well	c
as	c
the	c
whole	c
society	c
.	c

I	c
got	c
it	c
today	c
and	c
could	c
n't	c
believe	c
it	c
!	c

As	i
you	i
asked	c
me	c
for	c
some	c
further	c
information	c
.	c

I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
play	c
tennis	c
and	c
basketball	c
while	c
I	c
am	c
there	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
again	c
and	c
take	i
care	i
,	c

Hi	c
!	c

I	c
'm	c
fine	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
asked	c
me	c
about	c
the	c
concert	c
,	c
I	c
'll	c
write	c
about	c
it	c
today	c
.	c

We	c
move	c
them	c
to	c
a	c
safe	c
place	c
so	c
that	c
they	c
wo	c
n't	c
be	c
kicked	c
or	c
stepped	c
on	c
by	c
other	c
mad	c
fans	c

Yours	c

I	c
love	c
London	c
's	c
musical	i
shows	i
and	c
I	c
read	c
the	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
show	c
called	c
"	c
over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
"	c
.	c

I	c
've	c
gone	c
to	c
many	c
musical	i
shows	i
where	c
the	c
main	c
actor	c
was	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
I	c
can	c
say	c
that	c
he	c
is	c
really	c
good	c
.	c

I	c
showed	c
the	c
advertisement	c
to	c
him	c
and	c
he	c
said	c
it	c
was	c
wrong	c
and	c
I	c
paid	c
the	c
normal	c
price	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
been	c
waiting	c
half	c
an	c
hour	c
outside	c
the	c
theatre	c
and	i
finally	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
a	c
quarter	c
past	c
eight	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
angry	c
about	c
all	c
of	c
this	i
problems	c
but	c
I	c
was	c
disappointed	c
when	c
I	c
realised	c
the	c
advertisement	c
was	c
wrong	c
with	i
the	c
actor	c
's	c
name	c
.	c

I	i
was	c
n't	c
a	c
good	c
evening	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
have	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

I	c
started	c
my	c
research	c
in	c
the	c
town	c
's	c
library	c
and	c
all	c
the	c
information	c
I	c
collected	c
was	c
from	c
a	c
local	c
newspaper	c
.	c

You	c
can	c
find	c
there	i
all	i
you	i
need	i
and	c
more	c
!	c

I	c
'm	c
not	c
interested	c
in	c
films	c
without	c
special	c
effects.	c
.	c

On	c
top	c
of	c
everything	c
,	c
when	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
visit	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
it	c
turned	c
out	c
to	c
be	c
closed	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
insisted	c
on	c
the	i
explanation	c
of	i
this	i
fact	i
,	c
I	c
was	c
told	c
that	c
the	c
chief	c
cook	c
was	c
on	c
holiday	c
!	c

Pat	c
was	c
my	c
classmate	c
and	c
I	c
should	c
add	c
,	i
that	c
he	c
was	c
one	c
of	c
my	c
best	c
friends	c
.	c

We	c
bought	c
a	c
beautiful	c
puppy	c
and	c
were	c
waiting	c
for	c
the	c
holiday	i
probably	c
even	c
more	c
impatiently	c
,	i
than	c
Susie	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
been	c
very	c
disappointed	c
by	c
the	c
quality	c
of	c
the	c
show	c
and	c
the	c
lies	c
in	c
your	c
advertisement	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
seeing	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
as	c
written	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
,	c
but	c
his	c
part	c
was	c
played	c
by	c
another	c
actor	c
,	c
without	c
information	i
or	c
excuse	i
from	i
the	c
direction	i
.	c

H.	c
Coulez	c

So	c
when	c
he	c
heard	c
at	i
random	i
that	c
my	c
parents	c
were	c
planning	c
to	c
offer	i
me	c
a	c
trip	c
to	c
San	c
Fansisco	c
as	c
present	i
for	c
my	c
birthday	c
,	c
my	c
little	c
brother	c
ran	c
in	i
my	c
bedroom	c
wherever	i
I	c
was	c
studying	c
and	c
whispered	c
in	i
my	i
ear	i
the	i
wonderful	i
news	i
.	c

I	c
had	i
received	c
your	c
letter	c
,	i
I	c
am	c
very	c
happy	c
to	c
have	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
price	i
.	c

So	c
it	c
is	c
impossible	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
go	c
before	i
.	c

But	c
I	c
think	c
I	c
'd	c
rather	c
do	c
other	c
activities	c
what	i
you	c
show	i
me	i
in	c
your	c
letter	c
like	i
tennis	c
.	c

Because	c
is	i
something	c
it	i
goes	c
with	c
their	c
culture	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
glad	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
in	c
June	c
I	c
am	c
going	c
to	c
take	c
some	c
exams	c
at	c
University	i
and	c
at	c
the	c
moment	c
I	c
do	c
not	c
know	c
the	c
exact	c
date	c
.	c

There	c
is	c
somebody	c
who	c
says	c
that	c
'	c
Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
'	i
and	c
who	c
is	c
happy	c
only	c
when	c
can	i
go	c
shopping	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
run	c
from	c
one	c
shop	c
to	c
another	i
and	i
always	c
looking	c
at	c
the	i
watch	c
,	c
doing	i
shopping	c
is	c
a	c
terrible	c
activity	c
.	c

For	c
istance	i
,	c
it	c
is	c
funny	i
enter	i
a	c
clothes	c
shop	c
and	c
try	c
on	c
a	c
skirt	c
or	c
a	c
t-shirt	i
although	c
you	c
do	c
not	c
buy	c
anything	c
.	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
I	c
enjoy	c
wasting	c
money	c
and	i
buying	c
useful	c
things	c
or	c
not	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
shopping	c
is	c
relaxing	c
above	i
all	c
on	c
Saturdays	c
when	c
you	c
have	c
finished	c
a	c
work	i
week	c
and	c
you	c
are	c
expecting	c
a	c
wonderful	c
Sunday	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
with	c
reference	c
to	c
your	c
letter	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
give	c
some	i
information	c
which	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
asked	c
.	i

Because	c
my	c
course	c
finishes	c
at	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
June	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
going	c
to	c
work	c
for	c
a	c
Hotel	i
in	c
August	c
and	c
September	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
choose	c
basketball	c
and	c
swimming	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
was	c
at	c
school	c
,	c
I	c
have	i
been	i
playing	i
for	c
the	c
school	c
team	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
good	c
at	c
swimming	c
.	c

It	c
would	c
also	c
be	c
useful	c
to	c
know	c
that	i
how	c
much	c
money	c
will	i
be	i
enough	i
to	c
bring	c
.	c

From	c
:	c

There	c
are	c
special	c
methods	c
and	c
materials	c
for	c
students	c

Afternoon	c
Lessons	c
:	c
The	c
aim	c
of	c
the	c
afternoon	c
lessons	c
is	c
to	c
be	i
able	i
to	i
give	i
ability	i
in	i

Break	c
Time	c
:	c
We	c
have	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
facilities	c
for	c
break	c
time	c
.	c

These	i
are	i
computer	i
,	i
video	i
,	i
and	i
sports	i
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
we	c
should	c
choose	c
break	c
time	c
activities	c
.	c

Because	c
there	c
are	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
activities	c
which	c
students	c
take	c
part	c
in	c
.	c

About	c
the	c
accomodation	i
,	c
I	c
have	c
no	c
problems	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
staying	c
in	c
tent	i
,	c
so	c
that	c
the	c
holiday	c
may	c
be	c
more	c
adventurous	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
also	c
what	c
I	c
will	c
have	c
to	c
pay	c
with	i
my	c
money	c
and	c
how	c
the	c
climate	i
is	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
decide	c
which	c
clothes	c
to	c
bring	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

People	c
often	c
have	c
very	c
different	c
opinions	c
about	c
shopping	c
.	c

In	c
this	c
case	c
,	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
long	c
queues	c
,	c
you	c
ca	c
n't	c
walk	c
without	c
being	c
pulled	c
or	c
pushed	c
,	c
and	c
you	c
often	c
have	c
to	c
spend	c
a	i
hour	c
to	i
buy	i
some	c
soap	c
or	c
a	c
packet	c
of	c
biscuits	c
.	c

Even	c
if	c
you	c
are	c
with	c
a	c
friend	c
,	c
you	c
ca	c
n't	c
talk	c
,	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
noise	c
and	c
the	c
confusion	c
,	c
and	c
you	c
may	c
find	c
it	c
difficult	c
also	c
to	c
walk	c
close	c
to	c
each	c
other	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
express	c
how	c
I	i
was	i
dissatisfied	i
with	c
OVER	c
THE	c
RAINBOW	c
which	i
was	c
presented	i
by	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
the	c
reason	c
why	c
I	c
bought	c
the	c
ticket	c
was	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
who	c
is	c
my	c
favorite	i
star	c
,	c
and	c
was	c
going	c
to	c
play	i
for	i
the	c
show	c
.	c

Although	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
start	c
at	c
19=30	i
,	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
20=15	i
,	c
so	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
wait	c
for	c
an	c
hour	c
.	c

To	c
make	c
matters	c
worse	c
,	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
late	c
starting	i
,	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
had	c
already	c
closed	c
after	i
the	c
show	c
finished	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
would	i
take	c
immediate	c
action	c
for	i
that	i
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
.	c

Nowadays	c
,	c
especially	i
computer	c
technology	c
is	i
improving	c
,	c
therefore	c
,	c
we	c
can	c
get	c
any	i
kinds	i
of	i
information	i
as	i
much	i
as	i
we	i
require	i
.	c

However	c
,	c
we	c
enjoyed	c
the	c
musical	c
,	c
but	c
while	c
going	c
out	i
to	c
have	c
dinner	c
,	c
we	c
saw	c
the	c
restaurant	c
closed	i
and	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
take	i
the	c
car	c
and	c
come	c
back	c
home	c
very	c
hungry	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
Robert	c
and	c
I	c
'm	c
writting	i
for	i
the	i
article	c
about	c
clothes	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
oppinion	i
,	c
in	c
a	c
hundred	c
of	i
years	c
,	i
we	c
'll	c
wear	c
the	c
same	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
that	c
we	c
wear	c
nowadays	c
.	c

On	i
one	i
hand	i
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
I	c
'm	c
working	c
in	c
a	c
school	c
and	c
the	c
lessons	c
finish	c
at	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
June	c
so	c
if	c
I	c
could	c
go	i
to	i
this	c
extraordinary	c
opportunity	c
in	c
July	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
better	c
for	c
me	c
because	c
in	c
August	c
I	c
will	c
have	c
to	c
be	c
ready	c
to	c
begin	c
preparing	c
the	c
exams	c
of	i
september	i
.	c

Another	c
point	c
is	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
already	c
chose	i
two	c
activities	c
that	i
you	i
asked	i
me	i
while	i
I	i
am	i
at	i
the	i
camp	i
and	c
are	i
basketball	c
and	c
golf	c
,	i
they	i
are	c
the	c
best	c
for	i
me	c
because	c
I	c
think	c
I	c
am	c
good	c
at	c
both	c
and	c
I	c
used	c
to	c
play	c
them	c
before	i
.	c

We	c
arrived	c
quite	c
soon	i
because	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
organise	i
how	c
we	c
went	i
to	c
serve	c
people	c
did	i
with	i
which	i
order	i
,	i
so	c
we	c
started	c
putting	c
all	c
the	c
stuff	c
in	c
appropiate	i
place	c
.	c

See	c
you	c
soon	c

WE	c

SO	c
THE	c
ONLY	c
ONE	c
VACATION	c
MONTH	c
I	c
CAN	c
GO	c
IS	c
JULY	c
.	c

I	c
THINK	c
THAT	c
THE	c
LOG	c
CABIN	c
WILL	c
BE	c
MORE	c
COMFORTABLE	c
AT	i
ALL	c
.	c

I	c
JUST	c
STARTED	c
TO	c
PLAY	c
TENNIS	c
THAT	i
IS	c
WHY	c
I	c
THINK	c
IT	c
WOULD	c
BE	c
A	c
POSSIBILITY	c
TO	c
PRACTISE	c
AND	c
CHECK	c
MY	c
SKILLS	c

PEOPLE	c
LIKE	c

(	c
ASPECIALLY	i
IN	c
POLAND	c

WHERE	c
MANY	c

LADIES	c
PREFER	c
TO	c
VISIT	c
UNDERWEAR	c
SHOPS	c
OR	c
DEPARTMENTS	c
IN	c
HUGE	c
HIPERMARKETS	i
AND	c
MEN	c
ARE	c

WHEN	c
THEY	c
CAN	c
BUY	c
SOMETHING	c
NEW	c
FOR	c
THEIR	c
CARS	c

MOTORS	i

.	c

BUT	c
SOME	c
PEOPLE	c
DO	c
N'T	c
LIKE	c
DOING	c
SHOPPING	c
AT	c
ALL	c
.	c

THE	c
REASONS	c
ARE	c
;	c
DISTANCE	c
,	c
LACK	c
OF	c
CAR	c
,	c
CROWDED	c
STREETS	c
,	c
TRAFFIC	c
ON	c

PEOPLE	c

THEIR	c

THEY	c

PEOPLE	c
IN	c

THEY	c
DO	c
N'T	c
LIKE	c
SHOPPING	c
EITHER	c
BECAUSE	c
OF	c
THE	c
WEATHER	c
(	c
SOMETIMES	c
IT	c
'S	c
TOO	c
HOT	c
OR	c
TOO	c
COLD	c
FOR	c

IT	c
ABSOLUTELY	c
DEPENDS	c
ON	c
A	i
LIFE-STYLE	i

PERSONALITY	c
AND	c
NEEDS	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c

It	c
'll	c
make	c
me	c
like	c
at	i
the	c
village	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
I	c
'll	c
have	c
chance	i
to	c
draw	c
the	i
pictures	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
'll	c
show	c
my	i
friends	c
who	c
have	c
never	c
been	c
there	c
before	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
draged	i
to	i
learn	i
sailing	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
good	c
at	c
it	c
.	c

All	c
of	c
the	c
students	c
agree	c
with	i
that	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

So	c
they	c
said	c
they	c
do	c
not	c
always	c
enjoy	c
shopping	c
.	c

Sometimes	c
you	c
ca	c
n't	c
find	c
a	c
place	c
to	c
park	c
your	c
car	c
.	c

Sometimes	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
park	c
your	c
car	c
in	c
a	c
futher	i
place	c
then	c
walk	c
to	c
the	c
supermarket	c
.	c

Sometimes	c
you	c
get	c
lost	c
in	c
the	c
supermarket	c
.	c

I	c
will	c
give	c
you	c
the	c
information	c
which	c
you	c
asked	c
me	c
in	i
your	c
letter	c
and	c
also	c
will	i
ask	c
you	c
some	c
questions	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
quite	c
good	c
in	i
tennis	c
,	c
especially	c
plaing	i
in	i
two	i
pairs	i
.	c

Also	c
I	c
like	c
swimming	c
and	c
I	c
've	c
got	c
two	c
year	i
experience	c
in	i
teaching	c
swimming	c
in	i
lesure	i
centre	c
.	c

Do	c
I	c
enjoy	c
it	c
?	c

If	c
I	c
told	c
you	c
"	c
yes	c
"	c
or	c
"	c
no	c
"	c
,	c
I	c
'd	c
tell	c
you	c
nothing	c
.	c

I	c
ca	c
n't	c
be	i
concentrate	c
in	c
a	c
shop	c
,	c
but	i
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
relaxe	i
as	i
well	i
.	c

I	c
also	c
understand	c
that	c
nobody	c
will	c
do	c
that	c
at	i
my	c
place	c
.	c

To	c
be	c
honest	c
,	c
sometimes	c
I	c
like	c
shopping	c
.	c

He	c
is	c
my	c
favourite	c
actor	c
and	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
reason	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
your	c
theatre	c
.	c

This	c
was	c
very	c
disappointing	c
.	c

Due	i
to	i
all	c
of	c
these	c
reasons	c
,	c
I	c
hope	c
you	c
could	i
give	c
my	i
money	c
back	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
know	c
that	c
when	c
I	c
told	c
her	c
I	c
was	c
thinking	c
in	i
going	i
away	i
from	i
home	c
.	c

This	c
was	c
a	c
very	c
difficult	c
decission	i
but	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
take	c
it	c
because	c
of	c
my	c
personal	c
situation	c
,	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
shouting	c
and	c
fighting	c
will	i
all	c
my	c
family	c
.	c

Therefore	i
my	c
girlfriend	c
lived	c
alone	c
so	i
I	c
could	c
have	c
stayed	c
with	c
her	c
or	c
just	c
have	c
gone	c
on	c
travelling	c
around	c
the	c
world	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
thinking	c
a	c
lot	c
about	c
this	c
problem	c
and	c
how	c
to	c
solve	c
it	c
so	c
I	c
needed	c
someone	c
to	c
talk	c
to	c
and	c
Pat	c
had	c
always	c
been	c
my	c
best	c
friend	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
so	c
happy	c
and	c
exciting	i
to	c
receive	c
this	c
letter	c
about	c
I	i
've	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
.	c

And	c
I	c
'm	c
sure	c
about	i
that	c
the	c
weather	c
in	c
July	c
will	c
be	c
lovely	c
!	c

It	c
's	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
most	c
popular	c
sports	c
in	c
U.S.A	i
as	c
well	c
in	c
my	c
opinion	c
.	c

And	c
the	c
last	c
one	c
is	c
that	i
do	i
I	c
need	c
pillow	c
or	c
blanket	c
or	c
something	c
else	c
?	c

More	c
and	c
more	c
people	c
like	c
shopping	c
now	c
.	c

You	c
can	c
see	c
so	c
many	c
people	c
walk	c
along	c
the	c
business	c
street	c
every	c
day	c
and	c
any	c
time	c
,	c
especially	c
in	c
Oxford	c
Street	c
.	c

But	c
is	c
it	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
?	c

Also	c
for	i
example	c
.	i

If	c
you	c
were	i
rich	i
man	c
it	c
does	c
n't	c
mater	c
,	c
but	c
if	c
you	c
were	i
poor	i
man	c
,	c
you	c
will	c
be	c
sad	c
!	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
this	c
letter	c
to	c
you	c
to	c
make	c
a	c
complain	i
about	c
the	c
"	i
Over	i
the	i
rainbow	i
"	i
musical	i
show	i
which	c
I	c
saw	c
yesterday	c
.	c

When	c
it	c
finally	c
started	c
I	c
noticed	c
that	c
the	c
famous	c
actor	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
was	i
replaced	i
by	c
someone	c
who	c
was	c
not	c
as	c
good	c
as	c
him	c
.	c

Danny	c
Brook	c
was	c
the	c
reason	c
that	c
most	c
people	c
came	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

After	c
some	c
time	c
a	i
few	c
of	c
them	c
started	c
to	c
leave	c
the	c
theatre	c
.	c

Then	c
I	c
thougt	i
that	c
I	c
should	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
drink	c
or	c
eat	c
something	c
so	c
that	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
say	c
that	c
I	c
wasted	i
my	c
time	c
by	c
coming	c
here	c
.	c

I	c
became	c
furious	c
when	c
I	c
saw	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
there	c
were	c
n't	c
any	c
employees	c
to	c
work	i
.	i

I	c
do	c
n't	c
care	c
what	c
you	c
will	i
do	i
about	c
the	c
theatre	c
but	c
I	c
want	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
because	c
this	c
was	c
n't	c
the	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
you	c
promised	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
.	c

The	i
last	c
forty	c
years	c
,	c
technology	c
has	c
been	c
growing	c
very	c
fast	c
.	c

first	i
it	c
was	c
used	c
only	c
by	c
the	c
military	c
or	c
by	c
scientists	c
but	c
the	i
last	c
twenty	c
years	c
modern	c
technology	c
is	i
found	c
in	c
any	c
house	c
,	c
rich	c
or	c
poor	c
and	i
it	c
helps	c
people	c
do	c
hard	c
work	c
.	c

The	i
last	c
ten	c
year	i
computers	c
had	i
entered	i
almost	c
every	c
house	c
,	c
especially	c
in	c
rich	c
countrys	i
.	c

The	c
general	c
conclusion	c
about	c
computers	c
is	c
that	c
they	c
help	c
people	c
to	c
have	c
easier	c
lives	c
by	c
doing	c
hard	c
work	c
and	c
helping	c
them	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

I	c
have	c
to	c
admit	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
as	c
I	c
expected	c
;	c
First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
the	c
main	c
reason	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
see	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
was	c
its	c
actor	c
,	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
very	c
disappointing	c
when	c
I	c
realised	c
he	c
was	c
n't	c
in	i
the	c
scene	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
never	c
have	c
imagined	c
this	c
could	c
happen	c
in	c
such	c
a	c
well-known	c
theatre	c
.	c

It	c
seemed	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
something	c
lovely	c
step	i
by	c
step	c
.	c

I	c
got	i
conscious	c
of	c
my	c
problem	c
and	c
despite	c
being	c
a	c
personal	c
matter	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
tell	i
it	i
to	i
Pat	i
.	c

She	c
tried	c
to	c
apologise	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
enough	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

From	c
that	c
moment	c
,	c
I	c
denied	i
being	i
with	c
anyone	c
until	c
I	c
met	c
Cold	c
,	c
a	c
sensitive	c
dog	c
,	c
the	c
one	c
who	c
would	c
keep	c
my	c
secrets	c
forever	i
and	c
would	c
be	c
near	c
me	c
until	c
the	c
end	c
.	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
,	c

I	c
can	i
not	i
believe	c
that	c
I	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c

It	i

great	c
!	c
)	c

As	c
your	i
questions	c
,	c
I	c
am	c

to	c
travel	c

I	c
will	c
having	i

finished	i
the	c
exams	c

Furthermore	c

painting	c
and	c
photography	c

my	c
hobbies	c
and	c
my	i
fasinative	i
in	i

enjoyed	i

a	i
photograph	i
of	c
wildlife	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
big	c
one	c
that	i
I	i
never	i
thougth	i
and	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
imagine	i
how	c
amazing	c
was	i
it	i

I	c
have	i
to	c
taken	i
care	c
of	c
them	c
during	c
a	i

,	c
served	i
a	i

even	i
brought	c

Marvellous	c
thing	c
!	c
and	i
of	c

as	i
you	c
have	c

it	i
I	c
've	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
're	c
well	c
and	c

with	i
CD	c
and	c
do	c
n't	c
forget	c
to	c
write	c
back	c
all	c
about	c
your	c
news	c
during	i
my	i
summer	c
holiday	c
job	c
.	c

13	c
of	c
June	c
,	c
2000	c

I	c
am	c
really	c
happy	c
to	c
receive	c
letter	i
about	c
Camp	c
California	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

To	c
tell	c
the	c
truth	c
,	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
both	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
stayed	c
in	c
log	c
cabins	c
before	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
would	i
try	c
new	i
style	c
for	c
me	c
!	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
choose	c
singing	c
and	c
tennis	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
played	c
tennis	c
for	c
nearly	c
7	c
years	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
also	c
one	c
of	c
my	c
hobbies	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
like	c
to	c
tidy	c
up	c
,	c
you	c
know	c
!	c
!	c

I	c
keep	c
that	c
in	c
my	c
mind	c
,	c
ever	i
!	c

Anyway	c
,	c
hope	c
to	c
hear	c
from	c
you	c
shortly	c
.	c

See	c
you	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
there	c
were	c
two	c
unknown	c
actors	c
in	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

The	c
show	c
was	i
started	i
at	c
20.15	c
but	c
actually	c
it	c
should	c
started	i
at	c
19.30	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
I	c
bought	c
a	c
£	c
20	c
ticket	c
without	c
any	c
discount	c
even	i
the	c
advertisement	c
mentioned	c
discount	i
is	i
available	c
.	c

And	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
we	c
went	c
to	c
visit	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
am	c
wondering	c
why	c
it	c
said	c
we	c
could	c
visit	c
the	c
restaurant	c
if	c
you	c
know	i
it	c
would	c
be	c
closed	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
afraid	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
a	i
best	c
musical	c
show	c
because	c
all	i
the	i
things	i
above	i
was	i
not	i
an	i
accurate	i
as	i
what	i
we	i
had	i
been	i
told	i
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
your	c
reply	c
.	c

Pat	c
has	c
been	c
studying	c
in	c
the	c
same	c
class	c
with	c
me	c
since	i
this	c
year	c
.	c

One	c
day	c
,	c
we	c
were	c
sitting	c
in	c
the	c
dinning-hall	c
like	i
usually	i
.	c

Then	c
I	c
told	c
this	c
to	c
Pat	c
and	c
told	c
her	c
to	c
keep	c
it	c
secret	c
:	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
want	c
people	c
gossip	i
behind	i
me	c
then	i
everyone	c
would	c
know	c
I	c
fancy	i
him	c
.	c

But	c
the	c
thing	c
which	c
I	i
've	i
never	c
expected	c
is	i
Pat	c
betrayed	c
me	c
.	c

Now	c
,	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
talk	c
to	c
her	c
anymore	c
because	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
stand	c
a	c
person	c
who	c
I	c
trusted	c
betrayed	i
me	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
to	c
make	c
matters	c
worse	c
,	c
your	c
restaurant	c
had	c
already	c
closed	c
after	c
finishing	c
the	c
show	c
so	c
I	c
could	c
not	c
eat	c
anything	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

Amaisingly	i
,	c
we	c
can	c
find	c
that	c
computer	i
users	i
are	i
getting	i
more	i
and	i
more	i
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
using	c
computer	i
is	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
for	i
me	c
because	c
I	c
can	c
store	c
my	c
personal	c
records	c
such	c
as	c
diary	c
or	c
expenses	c
and	c
I	c
send	c
E-mail	c
to	c
my	c
friends	c
who	c
live	c
abroad	c
.	c

Regarding	c
the	c
accommodation	c
I	i
would	c
prefer	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
because	c
in	c
my	c
opinion	c
tents	c
are	c
very	c
uncomfortable	c
to	c
sleep	c
and	i
they	c
are	c
n't	c
very	c
cozy	i
.	c

Regarding	c
the	c
activities	c
I	i
've	c
chosen	c
swimming	c
as	c
I	c
'm	c
very	c
keen	c
on	c
it	c
and	c
I	c
'm	c
fairly	c
good	c
at	c
it	c
,	c
but	i
I	c
expect	c
the	c
water	c
to	c
be	c
as	i
crystal	c
clear	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
for	c
vegetarian	c
food	c
for	c
me	c
as	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
very	c
extrict	i
vegan	c
,	c
and	c
to	c
suggest	c
me	i
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
to	c
bring	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
really	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
my	c
stay	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
and	c
to	c
your	c
response	i
in	i
this	i
regard	i

Have	c
you	c
ever	c
asked	c

'm	c
a	c
fun	i
of	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
so	c
when	c
I	c
read	c
in	i
the	i
advertisement	i
his	i
name	i
I	c
immediately	c
decided	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
disaster	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
people	c
in	c
the	c
kitchen	c
were	c
n't	c
ready	c
with	c
the	c
food	c

Your	c
faightfully	i

I	c
read	c
it	c
two	c
months	c

and	c
I	c
liked	c
it	c
very	c
much	c

The	c
old	c
man	c
is	c
a	c
sad	c
person	c
but	c
he	c
loves	c
his	c
live	i
and	c
lives	c
on	c
the	c
beach	c
because	c
he	c
ca	c
n't	c
stay	i
without	c
see	i
the	c

for	c
a	c
day	c

Love	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
,	i
on	i
behalf	i
of	i
an	i
advanced	i
class	i
,	i
to	i
you	i
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
having	c
organised	c
our	c
a	i
three-day	c
programme	c
on	i
13th	c
to	c
15th	c
March	c
.	c

We	c
discussed	c
the	c
programme	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

Nowaday	i
,	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
celebrities	c
,	c
such	c
as	c
pop	c
,	c
film	c
and	c
sports	c
stars	c
,	c
suffer	c
from	c
being	i
intruded	i
on	i
the	i
privacy	i
of	i
their	i
lives	i
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
they	c
think	c
that	c
celebrities	c
do	c
not	c
have	c
to	c
hide	c
from	c
publicity	c
because	c
it	c
means	c
that	c
they	c
are	c
extremely	c
popular	c
with	c
people	c
and	c
being	c
loved	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
other	c
people	c
are	c
against	c
following	c
celebrities	c
and	c
photographing	c
them	c
every	c
moment	c
.	c

What	c
is	c
more	c
,	c
they	c
insist	c
that	c
before	i
celebrities	c
,	c
they	c
are	c
also	c
human-beings	i
who	c
want	c
to	c
live	c
without	c
being	c
disturbed	c
and	c
watched	c
.	c

Thus	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
journalists	c
should	c
consider	c
celebrities	c
'	c
lives	c
and	c
be	i
in	c
celebrities	c
'	c
shoes	c
.	c

I	c
see	c
people	c
who	c
run	c
the	c
camp	c
are	c
very	c
good	c
in	i
organize	i
a	i
social	c
life	c
of	c
their	c
guests	c
.	c

Generally	c
I	c
paint	c
some	c
landscapes	c
by	c
using	c
the	i
watercolours	c
,	c
but	c
sometimes	c
I	c
try	c
to	c
paint	c
like	c
during	c
the	c
impresionist	i
by	i
using	c
blobs	c
,	c
oil	c
paint	c
and	c
canvases	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

The	c
aim	c
of	c
this	c
report	c
is	c
to	c
suggest	c
which	c
lessons	c
and	c
other	c
activities	c
should	c
be	c
place	i
at	i
video	i
film	c
about	c
daily	c
life	c
at	c
our	c
school	c
.	c

In	c
order	c
to	c
preper	i
it	c
I	c
visited	c
some	c
clasrooms	i
during	c
the	c
lessons	c
and	c
I	c
interviewed	c
a	c
number	c
of	c
students	c
from	c
our	c
school	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
the	c
teacher	c
of	c
history	c
and	c
polish	i
language	c
is	c
able	c
to	c
interest	c
students	c
about	i
the	c
subject	c
in	c
differents	i
ways	c
.	c

According	c
to	c
students	c
'	c
oppinions	i
the	i
most	c
popular	c
activities	c
are	c
the	i
basketball	c
,	c
tennis	c
,	c
swimming	c
and	c
as	i
well	i
the	c
photography	c
group	c
and	c
the	c
painting	c
team	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
called	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
that	c
was	c
advertised	c
in	c
this	c
week	c
's	c
newspaper	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
said	c
that	c
it	c
would	c
start	c
at	c
19.30	c
but	c
it	c
was	i
not	c
.	c

It	c
started	c
fourty	i
five	i
minutes	c
later	c
.	c

Beside	i
this	c
,	c
we	c
where	i
invited	c
to	c
visit	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
being	c
redecorated	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
not	c
a	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c

Nowadays	c
the	i
modern	c
technology	c
is	c
increasing	i
and	c
it	c
was	i
really	c
affecting	c
our	c
daily	c
life	c
.	c

Beside	c
this	c
you	c
can	c
talk	c
with	c
a	c
person	c
in	i
the	c
other	c
side	c
of	c
the	c
world	c
by	i
a	c
computer	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
it	c
helps	c
in	i
house	i
works	i
,	c
at	c
school	c
and	c
you	c
can	c
travel	c
to	c
places	c
very	c
quickly	c
.	c

So	c
the	c
main	c
advantage	c
of	c
the	i
modern	c
technology	c
is	c
that	c
things	c
are	c
becoming	c
easier	c
and	c
easier	c

Basically	c

There	c
are	c
some	c
advantages	c
when	c

go	c
shopping	c

They	c
can	c

and	c
they	c
are	c
happy	c
when	c
they	c
find	c
the	c
thing	c
which	c
they	c
wanted	c
.	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
many	c
disadvantages	c
as	c
well	c
as	c
advantages	c
.	c

I	c
also	c
recommend	c
a	i
window	c
shopping	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
the	c
best	c
way	c
to	c
enjoy	c
shopping	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
inform	c
you	c
that	c
I	c
am	c
able	c
to	c
go	c
there	c
only	c
in	c
July	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
finishing	c
my	c
study	i
in	c
June	c
,	c
then	c
I	c
have	c
a	c
month	c
off	c
(	c
July	c
)	c
and	c
on	c
August	c
1st	c
I	c
am	c
starting	c
a	c
new	c
job	c
.	c

(	c
Do	c
I	c
need	c
any	c
special	c
garments	c
?	c
)	c
and	c
could	c
you	c
tell	c
me	c
please	c
,	c
if	c
I	c
need	c
some	c
extra	c
money	c
to	c
pay	c
for	c
anything	c
like	c
trips	c
or	c
photo-paper	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c

Next	c
,	c
not	i
very	c
enjoyable	c
thing	c
about	c
shopping	c
is	c
spending	c
money	c
!	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
shopping	c
could	c
be	c
really	c
enjoyable	c
!	c

In	c
addition	c
to	c
this	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
the	c
famous	c
actors	c
that	c
you	c
have	i
mentionned	i
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
,	i
so	c
we	c
were	c
disappointed	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
request	c
a	c
full-refund	i
for	c
my	c
friends	c
and	c
I	i
,	c
because	c
I	c
felt	c
your	c
advertisement	c
was	c
misleading	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

From	c
the	c
past	c
until	c
now	c
,	c
we	c
have	c
wearing	i
several	c
different	c
fashionable	i
clothes	i
,	c
but	c
why	c
?	c

We	c
ca	c
n't	c
wearing	i
peculiar	c
clothes	c
like	c
in	c
science	c
fiction	c
films	c
.	c

I	c
bet	c
you	c
that	c
in	c
100	c
years	c
,	c
humans	c
will	c
wearing	i
exactly	c
the	c
same	c
clothes	c
as	c
today	c
,	c
because	c
we	c
love	c
the	c
actually	i
fashion	i
of	i
clothes	i
which	i
is	c
wonderful	c
.	c

The	c
last	c
survey	c
about	c
fashion	c
shown	i
that	c
people	c
feel	c
really	c
comfortable	c
with	c
those	i
now	c
!	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
because	c
I	c
'm	c
very	c
disappointed	c
.	c

I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
to	c
see	c
at	i
what	c
time	c
was	i
the	i
show	i
,	c
19.30	c
,	i
it	i
was	c
O.K.	i
so	c
I	c
bought	c
a	c
ticket	c
.	c

In	i
that	c
moment	c
my	c
problems	c
began	c
.	c

Then	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
wait	c
45	c
mins	i
,	i
the	c
show	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
.	c

That	c
was	c
too	c
much	c
.	c

By	i

It	c
's	c
difficult	c
for	c
us	c
to	c
realize	i
the	c
changes	c
in	c
our	c
live	i
,	c
but	c
we	c
can	c
think	c
about	c
it	i
.	c

How	c
has	c
it	c
change	i
my	c
daily	c
life	c
?	c

Now	c
I	c
only	c
used	i
to	c
push	c
a	c
button	c
,	c
and	c
things	c
or	c
mashines	i
work	c
on	c
their	c
own	c
.	c

Maybe	c
,	c
I	c
wo	c
n't	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
understand	c
how	c
the	c
things	c
worked	i
and	c
that	c
scare	i
me	c
,	i
I	c
will	c
be	c
useless	c
,	c
because	c
a	c
mashine	i
will	c
do	c
all	c
the	c
work	c
.	c

Finaly	i
when	c
we	c
had	c
seen	c
the	c
Musical	c
,	c
we	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
restaurant	c
and	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
they	c
done	i
some	c
dekoreting	i
,	c
and	c
you	c
wrott	i
in	c
your	c
advertisement	c
"	i
Visit	c
our	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
"	c

Secondly	c
I	c
think	c
we	c
have	i
more	i
mixing	c
clothes	c
from	c
all	c
over	c
the	c
world	c
,	c
because	c
we	c
are	c
traveling	i
more	i
and	i
more	i
around	i
.	c

Finaly	i
about	i
my	i
oppinion	i
I	c
wish	c
we	c
are	i
going	i
to	i
dress	i
us	i
more	c
as	c
in	i
the	c
past	c
with	i
nature	i
matrial	i
,	i
we	i
most	i
think	c
more	c
about	c
the	c
eviorment	i
and	c
leave	i
closer	c
to	c
the	i
earth	i
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

I	c
went	c
to	c
London	c
for	c
a	c
week	c
's	c
holiday	c
with	c
some	c
friends	c
and	c
every	c
evening	c
we	c
decided	c
something	i
to	i
do	i
in	c
order	c
to	c
enjoy	c
our	c
staying	i
in	c
that	c
beautiful	c
city	c
.	c

In	c
fact	c
,	c
only	i
after	i
having	c
going	i
into	c
the	c
theatre	c
,	c
I	c
realized	c
that	c
the	c
advertisement	c
I	c
had	c
read	c
was	c
probably	c
about	c
another	c
show	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
when	c
I	c
paid	c
my	i
ticket	c
I	c
noticed	c
that	c
nobody	c
could	c
obtain	c
the	c
discount	c
you	c
'd	c
written	c
about	c
.	c

According	i
to	i
all	c
these	c
things	c
,	c
I	c
ask	i
my	i
money	c
back	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

What	c
have	i
moved	c
me	c
to	c
this	i
discover	i
were	c
the	c
facts	i
that	c
happened	c
last	c
month	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
what	c
it	i
happened	c
me	i
two	c
days	c
ago	c
,	c
during	c
you	i
musical	c
show	c
"	c
OVER	c
THE	c
RAINBOW	c
"	c
.	c

Nobody	c
informed	c
me	c
about	c
it	i
.	c

In	c
the	c
pass	i
,	c
for	c
example	c
,	c
we	c
used	c
to	c
write	c
letters	c
to	c
comunicate	i
,	c
but	c
now	c
we	c
surely	i
send	c
an	c
e-mail	c
,	c
a	c
fax	c
or	c
make	c
a	c
phone	c
.	i

I	c
think	c
no	i
.	c

It	c
could	i
n't	i
allow	i
us	c
to	i
think	i
and	c
to	i
do	i
freely	c
.	c

Probably	c
,	c
because	c
their	c
parents	c
have	c
n't	c
enough	c
time	c
to	c
go	i
out	i
the	c
city	c
and	c
show	c
them	c
nature	c
.	c

Yes	c
,	c
but	c
we	c
must	c
n't	c
loose	i
the	i
values	c
and	i
our	c
free	i
time	i
to	c
stay	i
with	c
our	c
family	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
good	c
at	c
playing	c
basketball	c
,	c
swimming	c
,	c
tennis	c
,	c
surfing	c
as	i
they	c
are	i
my	c
hobbies	c
for	c
donkey	c
's	c
years	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
rather	c
play	c
golf	c
and	c
go	c
sailing	c
,	c
than	c
the	c
others	c
so	i
as	c
to	c
find	c
new	c
hobbies	c
in	c
my	c
life	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
fine	c
as	c
usual	c
.	c

Anyway	c
,	c
I	c
joined	c
the	c
team	c
which	c
helps	c
anything	i
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
last	c
month	c
as	i
you	c
know	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
view	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
extremely	c
interesting	c
and	c
satisfing	i
for	c
me	c
all	c
the	c
concert	c
long	c
.	c

13th	c
June	c
2000	c

I	c
have	c
just	c
been	c
in	i
tent	i
and	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
always	c
a	c
beautiful	c
and	c
interested	i
adventure	c
.	c

During	c
the	c
journey	i
I	c
would	c
do	c
surfing	c
and	c
photography	c
.	c

I	c
like	i
also	i
doing	i
photography	c
because	c
they	i
can	i
be	i
memories	i
IN	i
my	i
future	i
.	c

Your	i
sincerelly	i

I	c
woke	c
up	c
at	c
six	c
a.m.	c
and	c
I	c
worked	c
until	c
nine	c
p.m.	c
but	c
it	c
is	i
n't	i
a	c
problem	c
for	c
me	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
like	c
spending	c
my	c
time	c
with	c
other	c
people	c
.	c

There	c
was	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
work	c
to	c
do	c
but	c
we	c
were	c
happy	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
with	c
glad	i
people	c
and	c
at	c
the	c
end	c
we	c
had	c
the	c
possibility	i
to	c
take	c
part	c
in	c
the	c
pop	c
concert	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
wonderful	c
!	c

This	i
period	c
the	c
days	c
are	c
sunny	c
and	c
the	c
weather	c
wo	c
n't	c
prevent	c
me	c
from	c
doing	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
activities	c
.	c

About	i
the	c
accomodation	i
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
cabin	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
the	c
combins	i
are	c
safer	c
than	c
the	c
tents	c
and	c
they	c
can	c
protect	c
you	c
better	c
in	c
case	c
the	c
weather	c
changes	c
.	c

I	c
selected	c
swimming	c
because	c
this	c
is	c
one	c
of	c
my	c
hobbies	c
and	c
I	c
'm	c
good	c
enough	c
t	i
this	c
sector	i
.	c

I	c
like	c
it	c
because	c
it	c
offers	c
you	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
adventure	c
and	c
action	c
.	c

Please	c
drop	c
me	c
a	c
line	c

Yesterday	c
I	c
received	c
your	c
letter	c
and	c
it	c
made	c
me	c
happy	c
that	c
you	c
and	c
your	c
family	c
are	c
healthy	c
.	c

I	c
also	c
helped	c
to	c
clear	c
up	c
the	c
place	c
after	c
the	c
concert	c
.	c

It	c
offered	c
me	c
more	c
pocket	c
money	c
and	c
besides	c
this	c
I	c
had	c
the	c
chance	c
to	c
make	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
friends	c
because	c
there	c
were	c
many	c
children	c
who	c
wanted	c
to	c
help	c
too	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
received	c
your	c
letter	c
and	c
I	c
so	i
happy	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
the	c
holiday	c
in	c
California	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
,	i
how	c
much	c
I	i
need	c
and	c
what	c
type	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
should	c
take	c
?	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
are	c
very	c
well	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
to	c
search	c
in	i
the	c
internet	i
pictures	i
that	c
could	c
be	c
used	c
for	c
the	c
flier	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
my	c
awful	c
evening	c
at	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
.	c

Last	c
week	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
see	c
a	c
musical	c
show	c
called	c
'	c
OVER	c
THE	c
RAINBOW	c
'	c
at	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
.	c

It	c
should	c
be	i
from	c
7,30	i
p.m	c
,	i
but	c
it	c
was	i
from	i
8.15	c
p.m.	c
!	c

I	c
want	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
ticket	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
because	c
they	c
closed	c
early	i
than	c
usual	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
a	c
refund	c
.	c

Right	c
now	c
in	c
2000	c
many	c
people	c
are	c
wearing	c
modern	c
clothes	c
.	c

Like	c
wearing	i
T-shirts	c
,	c
trousers	c
,	c
skirts	c
,	c
coats	c
,	c
long-sleeved	c
shirts	c
,	c
jumpers	c
,	c
etc.	c
They	c
also	c
wear	c
little	c
items	c
on	c
them	c
to	c
go	c
with	c
their	c
clothes	c
.	c

Maybe	c
in	c
100	c
years	c
from	c
now	c
,	c
fashion	c
will	c
be	c
totally	c
different	c
.	c

This	c
special	c
gas	c
will	c
be	i
not	i
dangerous	c
.	c

This	c
is	c
one	c
more	c
reason	c
to	c
wear	c
balloon	c
clothes	c
in	c
future	i
.	c

Would	c
you	c
like	c
to	c
wear	c
balloon	c
clothes	c
and	c
bounce	c
around	c
the	c
world	c
?	c

I	c
have	c
to	c
do	c
this	c
because	c
things	c
happened	c
which	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
ignore	c
and	c
which	c
disappointed	c
me	c
very	c
much	c
.	c

We	c
had	c
a	c
great	c
time	c
together	c
until	c
we	c
decided	c
to	c
visit	c
the	c
musical	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
in	i
the	c
"	c
Circle	c
Theater	i
"	c
.	c

We	c
thought	c
it	c
would	i
be	i
a	c
joke	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
.	c

Sincerely	c

It	c
was	c
wonderful	i
surprise	c
when	c
I	c
received	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
wheather	i
anything	i
I	c
should	c
bring	c
to	i
this	c
travel	i
such	c
as	c
specific	c
clothes	c
,	c
extra	c
money	c
etc	c
.	c

Yours	i
sincerely	i
,	i

Thanks	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c

Yes	c
!	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
privelage	i
to	c
help	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
.	c

I	c
really	c
wished	c
you	c
were	c
there	c
with	c
me	c

My	c
dear	c
friend	c
,	c
if	c
I	c
tell	c
you	c
this	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
sure	c
you	c
will	c
get	c
jelous	i
.	c

This	c
was	c
the	c
best	c
experience	c

Can	c
you	c
imagine	c
how	c
much	c
I	c
appreciated	c
that	c
I	c
am	c
qualified	c
in	c
massage	c
?	c

Additionally	c
,	c
I	c
'd	c
rather	c
stay	c
in	c
tents	c
as	c
I	c
've	c
never	c
slept	c
in	c
tents	c
before	c
.	c

I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
choose	c
swimming	c
and	c
photography	c
as	c
activities	c
.	c

By	c
the	c
way	c
,	c
I	c
'm	c
wondering	c
what	c
kinds	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
should	c
prepare	i
and	c
how	c
much	c
much	i
I	c
should	c
bring	c
with	c
myself	i

I	c
'll	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
answers	c
from	c

Introduction	c

The	c
survey	c
was	c
done	i
to	i
300	c
students	c
,	c
who	c
are	c
between	c
18-28	c
,	c
at	c
our	c
school	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
it	c
seems	c
that	c
the	c
students	c
prefer	c
the	c
soccer	c
play	i
to	c
be	c
filmed	c
.	c

We	c
like	c
it	c
very	c
much	c
!	c

But	c
we	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
.	c

If	c
we	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
we	c
will	c
see	c
many	c
hairstyles	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
we	c
think	c
,	i
that	c
it	c
is	c
very	c
good	c
as	i
for	c
you	c
as	i
for	c
us	c
.	c

And	c
on	c
Wednesday	c
morning	c
we	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
national	i
art	i
gallery	i
,	c
but	i
after	c
that	c
we	c
can	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
Science	c
Museum	c
,	c
in	c
the	c
afternoon	c
.	c

She	c
told	c
me	c
,	i
that	c
he	c
was	c
hansom	i
,	c
kind	c
,	c
well-understanding	i
(	c
he	i
understood	i
her	i
from	i
a	i
half	i
of	i
the	i
word	i
)	c
;	c
the	c
main	c
was	i
he	c
also	c
liked	c
her	c
very	c
much	c
!	c

And	c
said	c
just	c
to	i
be	i
careful	c
.	c

She	c
disappeared	c
!	c

We	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
something	c
.	c

The	c
friend	c
gave	c
me	c
his	c
toy	c
and	i
I	c
gone	i
to	i
the	c
street	c
.	c

I	c
surprised	i
that	c
he	c
belived	i
me	c
.	c

After	c
that	c
she	c
told	c
me	c
,	i
that	c
the	c
man	c
was	c
the	c
boy	c
,	i
which	i
she	c
met	i
.	c

It	c
finishes	c
29th	c
of	c
June	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
surging	i
and	c
golf	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
about	c
Camp	c
California	c
.	c

Let	c
me	c
know	c
if	i
I	i
have	i
to	i
take	i
which	i
kind	i
of	i
clothes	i
and	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
need	c
.	c

It	c
would	c
be	c
very	c
helpful	c
.	c

Thanks	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
fantastic	c
because	c
I	c
could	c
see	c
Madonna	c
.	c

My	c
main	c
job	c
was	c
to	c
tide	i
up	c
her	c
dressing	c
room	c
.	c

If	c
we	c
had	c
worked	c
together	c
we	c
would	c
have	c
had	c
a	c
good	c
time	c
.	c

Let	c
's	c
find	c
some	c
information	c
to	c
get	c
a	c
job	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
to	c
go	c
now	c

I	c
hope	c
that	c
you	c
'll	c
be	c
alright	c

I	c
'm	c
so	c
happy	c
that	c
I	c
've	c
won	c
2	c
weeks	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
in	c
the	c
U.S.A.	c
At	c
first	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c

that	c
I	c

I	c
'm	c
a	c

My	c
school	c

it	c
finishes	c

June	c

I	c
can	c
sleep	c
in	c
tent	i
,	c
it	c
would	c
remain	i

a	i
good	c
time	c
which	c
I	i
'd	i
spent	i
with	c
my	c
friends	c
a	c
few	c
years	c
ago	c

I	c
'm	c
not	c
scared	c

Some	c

that	c
I	c
'm	c
very	i
good	c

but	c
I	c

In	i
swimming	i
I	i
'm	i
not	i
as	i
good	i
as	c
in	i
basketball	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
practise	c
more	c
and	c
maybe	c
learn	c
something	c
new	c
about	c
it	c

I	c
'm	c

It	c

To	i
this	c

Some	c

Answering	c
your	c
questions	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
only	c
en	i
July	c
because	c
this	c
is	c
the	c
month	c
of	c
my	c
vacations	i

According	c
to	c
your	c
letter	c
I	i
have	c
two	c
options	c
of	i
accommodation	c
,	c
or	i
in	c
tents	c
or	c
log	c
cabins	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
in	i
tents	i
because	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
is	c
something	c
more	c
exciting	c
and	c
new	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

Log	c
cabins	c
may	c
be	c
more	c
confortable	i
,	i
on	i
the	c
other	c
hand	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
"	c
survive	c
"	c
in	c
tents	i

Looking	c
to	i
your	c
letter	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
see	c
many	c
options	c
of	i
activities	c
and	c
I	c
realized	i
that	c
I	c
like	c
most	c
of	c
them	c
.	c

Climbing	c
is	c
something	c
new	c
for	c
me	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
not	c
so	c
good	c
on	i
that	i
,	c
however	c
I	i
wish	i
that	c
I	c
can	c
learn	c
about	c
it	c
on	i
the	c
Camp	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
some	c
doubts	i
about	c
my	c
prize	c
and	c
travel	c
.	c

Is	c
there	c
a	i
possibility	c
that	c
you	c
send	i
me	c
a	c
list	c
of	c
material	i
and	c
clothes	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
?	c

Please	c

my	c
letter	c
as	c

is	i
possible	c

Your	i

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

Is	c
everything	c
good	c
in	c
USA	i
?	c

I	c
vish	i
you	c
were	i
here	c
with	c
me	c
.	c

We	c
bought	c
tickets	c
to	c
the	c
show	c
and	c
also	c
to	c
the	c
fan	i
's	i
bus	c
.	c

AT	c
20:00	c
,	c
we	c
stopped	c
in	i
a	c
coffee	c
house	c
to	c
eat	c
.	c

The	i
shouted	c
:	c
"	c
20:30	c
you	c
all	c
have	c
to	c
be	c
back	c
because	c
the	c
bus	c
will	c
leave.	c
"	c

After	c
a	c
few	c
minutes	c
(	c
I	c
fought	i
were	i
few	i
)	c
I	c
realized	c
that	c
the	c
coffee	c
house	c
was	c
empty	c
.	c

I	c
looked	c
to	i
my	c
watch	c
:	c
20:45	c
.	c

The	c
man	c
offered	c
a	i
ride	c
.	c

We	c
accept	i
.	c

You	c
can	i
not	i
imagine	c
how	c
dissapointed	i
I	c
were	i
with	c
my	i
ownself	i
.	c

By	i
my	i
side	i
the	i
vocal	i
of	i
the	i
Almendegos	i
was	i
and	c
he	c
touched	c
my	c
arm	c
.	c

After	c
all	c
of	c
this	c
we	c
saw	c
the	c
show	c
in	i
the	c
best	c
place	c
,	c
near	c
of	i
the	c
stage	c
and	c
after	i
,	c
the	c
thing	c
that	c
I	c
most	c
liked	c
,	c
we	c
were	c
convidated	i
to	c
see	c
the	c
group	c
and	c
had	i
their	c
signatures	c
.	c

I	c
wish	i
that	c
you	c
liked	c
my	c
experience	c
.	c

Kisses	c
,	c

I	c
received	c
your	c
letter	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
glad	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
a	c
two	i
weeks	i
travel	i
to	c
Camp	c
California	c
.	c

I	c
will	c
be	c
very	c
busy	c
in	c
June	c
so	c
let	c
me	c
tell	c
you	c
some	c
details	c
about	c
my	c
travel	i
.	c

About	i
accommodation	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
tents	c
would	c
be	c
great	c
.	c

It	c
all	c
started	c
when	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
organizers	c
asked	c
me	c
to	c
help	c
him	c
at	c
a	c
concert	c
of	c
my	c
favorite	i
band	c
.	c

I	c
have	i
got	i
very	c
responsible	i
work	c
I	i
had	c
to	c
bring	c
food	c
for	c
Peter	c
Bolen	c
and	c
Tomas	c
Anders	c
.	c

Can	c
you	c
imagine	c
?	c

He	c
told	c
me	c
about	c
concert	i
programme	c
and	c
gave	c
me	c
his	c
photo	c
with	c
a	i
sign	i
.	c

Vasiliy	c
.	c

How	c
are	c
you	c
?	c

Note	i
says	c
that	c
tickets	i
has	i
discounts	i
available	i
,	c
but	c
I	c
bought	c
my	c
ticket	c
and	c
your	c
people	c
told	c
me	c
that	c
there	c
is	c
not	i
any	i
discount	c
for	i
thicket	i
.	c

I	c
deciced	i
to	c
go	c
and	c
visit	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
,	i
But	c
I	c
went	c
there	c
and	c
it	c
is	i
closed	c
for	c
some	c
reasons	i
.	c

I	c
was	c
really	c
hungry	c
and	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
other	i
restaurant	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
I	c
can	i
.	c

I	c
was	c
really	c
disappointed	c
about	c
your	c
threat	i
and	c
service	c
,	i
I	c
hope	c
I	c
can	c
get	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
and	c
you	c
can	c
improve	c
it	c
.	c

Science	c
and	c
technology	c
can	c
give	c
us	c
a	c
better	c
live	i
style	i
or	c
better	c
food	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
disappointed	c
after	c
this	i
show	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
have	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

Also	c
,	c
you	c
wrote	c
about	c
discounts	c
,	c
but	c
it	i
's	i
not	c
true	c
!	c

During	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
hungry	c
but	c
I	c
hoped	c
to	c
visit	c
restaurant	i
,	c
it	i
's	i
a	c
pity	c
,	c
but	i
restaurant	i
was	c
closed	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
too	c
late	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
understand	c

One	c
day	c
Peter	c
killed	c
one	i
boy	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
now	c
my	c
best	c
friend	c
is	c
prisoner	i
.	c

All	c
the	c
time	c
I	i
am	c
thinking	c
about	c
Peter	c
.	c

By	c
the	c
way	c
I	i
do	i
n't	i
see	i
Pat	c
about	i
one	c
year	c
.	c

Perhaps	c
,	c
he	c
moved	c
into	i
another	c
town	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
read	c
the	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
festival	c
and	c
I	c
must	c
say	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
idea	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
you	c
should	c
put	c
it	i
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
.	c

Are	c
there	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
more	c
plays	c
and	c
films	c
next	c
year	c
?	c

I	c
find	c
the	c
reasonably-priced	c
ticket	c
excellent	c
,	c
because	c
there	c
is	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
people	c
who	c
went	i
to	c
see	c
only	c
one	c
or	c
two	c
events	c
,	c
and	c
by	c
paying	c
the	i
all	i
events	i
ticket	c
they	i
might	c
see	c
other	c
events	c
and	c
learn	c
about	c
something	c
they	c
did	c
n't	c
expected	i
to	c
find	c
interesting	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
,	c

In	c
mine	c
,	c
we	c
did	c
n't	c
have	c
many	c
rules	c
.	c

We	c
were	c
allowed	c
to	c
go	c
out	c
if	c
we	c
did	c
n't	c
want	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
class	c
.	c

The	c
musical	c
show	c
was	c
going	i
to	c
start	c
at	c
19.30	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
started	c
t	i
20:15	c
.	c

Now	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
you	c
have	c
seen	c
it	i
was	c
not	c
a	c
perfect	c
evening	c
at	c
all	c
,	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
things	i
written	i
were	c
not	c
done	c
So	i
I	c
am	c
asking	c
to	c
get	c
some	c
of	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

I	c
go	c
shopping	c
,	c
watch	c
TV	c
,	c
walk	c
around	c
the	c
city	c
,	c
use	c
my	c
computer	c
and	c
get	c
lost	c
in	i
Internet	i
.	i

TV	c
was	c
black	c
and	c
white	c
at	c
first	c
and	c
there	c
were	c
only	c
two	c
or	c
three	c
channels	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
not	c
a	c
living	c
thing	c
but	c
it	c
has	c
a	c
brain	c
.	c

It	c
knows	c
more	c
than	c
most	c
of	i
the	i
people	c
.	c

Regarding	c
with	i
two	c
activities	c
I	i
will	c
choose	c
swimming	c
and	c
photography	c
.	c

I	c
like	c
ice	c
cram	i
,	c
sweets	c
and	c
beverage	i
very	c
much	c
especially	i
in	c
the	c
summer	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

Well	c
,	c
it	c
might	c
be	c
true	c
but	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
depends	c
on	c
the	c
situation	c
.	c

You	c
can	c
also	c
see	c
more	c
graceful	c
and	c
fine	c
thing	i
.	c

You	c
usually	c
visit	c
many	c
shops	c
and	c
compare	c
the	c
quality	c
and	c
the	c
price	c
and	c
select	c
the	c
best	c
one	c
which	c
suits	c
to	i
you	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
it	c
usually	c
take	i
much	i
time	c
to	c
get	c
what	i
you	i
exactly	i
want	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
not	c
easy	c
to	c
shop	c
with	c
someone	c
who	c
are	i
not	c
interested	c
in	c
shopping	c
.	c

It	c
depends	c
on	c
the	c
situation	c
.	c

London	c
,	c
June	c
17th	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
to	c
make	c
complaints	i
for	i
the	c
very	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
I	c
had	c
at	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
.	c

yours	c
faithfully	c

I	c
usually	c
do	c
n't	c
buy	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
them	c
but	c
I	c
must	c
recognise	i
that	c
some	c
of	c
them	c
are	c
useful	c
.	c

Therefore	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
more	c
spare	c
time	c
to	c
enjoy	c
the	c
one	c
I	i
consider	c
as	i
the	c
most	c
important	c
influence	c
technology	c
had	i
in	i
my	c
life	c
:	c
the	c
computer	c
and	c
Internet	c
.	c

Now	c
,	c
I	c
will	c
never	c
say	i
again	i
that	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
where	c
can	i
I	i
find	c
some	c
information	c
about	c
this	c
or	c
that	c
and	c
when	c
on	c
holidays	i
or	c
every	c
time	c
I	c
make	c
a	c
new	c
friend	c
,	c
I	c
just	c
ask	c
for	c
the	i
email	i
and	i
that	c
's	c
enough	c
to	c
know	c
we	c
will	c
know	c
about	c
each	c
other	c
soon	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
wondering	c
if	c
some	i
special	c
clothes	c
are	c
required	c
and	c
how	c
much	c
pocket	c
money	c
I	c
need	c
for	c
this	c
trip	c
?	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
that	c
I	c
've	c
never	c
had	c
a	i
such	i
good	c
time	c
in	c
my	c
life	c
!	c

I	c
hop	i
that	c
the	c
next	c
time	c
you	c
will	c
come	c
with	c
me	c
!	c

See	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

This	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
because	c
as	c
you	c
know	c
most	c
people	c
of	i
our	c
class	c
are	c
going	c
to	c
work	c
in	c
this	c
sector	c
so	c
it	c
will	i
be	i
very	c
interesting	c
for	c
everybody	c
and	c
also	c
a	c
kind	c
of	c
education	c
.	c

Instead	c
of	c
going	c
to	c
the	c
Science	c
Museum	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
morning	c
we	i
thought	c
we	c
could	c
postpone	c
it	c
to	c
Wednesday	c
afternoon	c
.	c

The	c
shopping	c
could	c
be	c
done	c
after	c
the	c
river	c
trip	c
to	c
Greenwich	c
but	c
only	c
if	c
we	c
have	c
enough	c
time	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Will	c
the	c
home	c
of	c
the	c
future	c
really	c
look	c
different	c
?	c

The	c
place	c
to	c
spend	c
the	c
night	c
will	c
still	c
be	c
the	c
bed	c
.	c

Let	c
's	c
have	c
a	c
surprise	c
?	i

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c
.	c

Dear	c
Kim	c

I	c
'm	c
really	c
sorry	c
,	i
it	c
's	c
taken	c
me	c
so	c
long	c
to	c
reply	c
.	c

I	c
and	c
my	c
friend	c
-	i
Emma	c
,	i
we	i
helped	c
to	c
paint	c
the	c
scence	i
of	i
the	i
background	i
on	c
the	c
stage	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
known	i
,	c
I	c
like	c
drawing	c
and	c
painting	c
when	c
I	c
have	c
a	i
free	c
time	c
so	c
that	c
why	i
I	c
chose	c
to	c
paint	c
the	c
scence	i
of	i
the	i
background	i
.	c

I	c
really	c
enjoyed	c
painting	c
it	c
and	c
it	c
looked	c
very	c
nice	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
told	c
my	c
teacher	c
that	c
I	c
am	c
willing	c
to	c
give	i
a	i
hand	i
next	c
time	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
are	c
,	c
I	c
'll	c
tell	c
you	c
in	i
advance	c
.	c

Best	c
wishes	c

Because	c
I	c
'm	c
big	c
fan	c
of	c
them	c
,	c
if	i
was	c
pretty	c
much	i
boring	c
without	c
them	c
and	c
not	c
to	c
mention	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
disappointing	c
.	c

Moreover	c
the	i
testament	i
was	c
till	i
under	c
the	i
construction	c
so	c
that	c
we	c
could	c
n't	c
use	c
it	c
when	c
we	c
were	c
extlemely	i
hungry	c
.	c

Finally	i
,	i
I	i
wonder	i
why	i
you	i
did	i
n't	i
ask	i
for	i
the	i
money	i
back	i
if	i
you	i
have	i
guaranteed	i
the	i
perfect	i
evening	i
.	i

Technology	c
has	c
been	c
developed	i
extremely	c
fast	c
these	c
days	c
and	c
as	c
it	c
is	c
still	c
going	c
on	c
,	c
it	c
ca	c
n't	c
help	c
affecting	c
our	c
lives	c
.	c

Dear	c
Ms	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
was	c
pleasantly	c
surprised	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
never	c
tried	c
out	i
climbing	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
have	c
always	c
wished	i
to	c
do	c
it	c
one	c
day	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

And	c
I	c
can	c
say	c
it	c
was	c
terrific	c
!	c

My	c
job	c
was	c
actually	c
to	c
listen	c
to	c
Tim	c
and	c
do	c
whatever	c
he	c
said	c
.	c

This	c
included	c
to	i
clean	i
up	c
the	c
rooms	c
which	c
were	c
used	c
by	c
the	c
singers	c
and	c
put	i
some	c
equipment	c
on	c
the	c
stage	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
never	c
been	c
behind	c
the	c
stage	c
before	c
and	c
you	c
know	c
the	c
rooms	c
,	c
in	c
which	c
singers	c
dress	c
and	c
make-up	i
,	c
are	c
actually	c
small	c
.	c

And	c
I	c
managed	c
to	c
speak	c
to	c
Ricky	c
Martin	c
out	i
of	i
stage	i
.	c

Dear	c
Sirs	c
,	c

When	c
we	c
arrived	c
at	c
the	c
theatre	c
we	c
had	i
to	i
realise	i
that	c
there	c
were	c
no	c
discountable	i
tickets	c
available	c
as	c
mentioned	i
in	c
your	c
advertisment	i
so	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
buy	c
the	c
most	c
expensive	c
ones	c
.	c

You	c
can	c
imagine	c
how	c
disappointed	c
we	c
were	c
especially	i
the	i
acting	i
of	i
Danny	i
Brook	i
was	c
the	c
main	c
reason	c
for	i
us	i
to	i
see	c
the	c
musical	c
.	c

Heine	c
Bitz	c

What	c
would	c
we	c
wear	c
in	c
100	c
years	c
time	c
?	c

In	c
the	c
next	c
100	c
years	c
there	c
will	c
be	c
no	c
change	c
in	c
that	c
but	c
the	i
fashion	c
is	c
going	c
to	c
develop	c
in	c
a	c
special	c
imaginative	c
way	c
.	c

Especially	i
contrast	i
will	i
be	i
attractiv	i
.	c

Furthermore	c
the	c
style	c
of	c
the	c
clothes	c
are	i
going	c
to	c
be	c
more	c
crazy	c
and	c
individuell	i
but	c
there	c
will	c
be	i
still	i
enumerous	i
clothes	c
for	c
the	i
solid	i
people	c
.	c

The	c
fashion	c
industry	c
will	c
deliver	c
a	c
wide	c
range	i
of	i
vararity	i
in	i
style	i
,	c
material	i
and	c
colour	i
.	c

There	c
will	c
be	c
clothes	c
for	c
everyones	i
tast	i

Dear	c
Jane	c
Clark	c
,	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
you	c
to	c
know	c
that	c
the	c
whole	c
organization	c
was	c
nearly	i
excellent	c
.	c

The	c
idea	c
of	c
making	c
the	c
festival	c
"	c
international	c
"	c
was	c
very	c
good	c
.	c

Plays	i
and	c
films	c
I	c
watched	c
were	c
also	c
excellent	c
,	c
but	c
more	c
could	c
be	c
on	c
the	c
stage	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

I	c
joined	i
the	c
art	c
exhibitions	c
and	c
saw	c
interesting	c
pictures	c
.	c

The	c
dance	c
shows	c
made	i
sight	i
for	c
our	c
sour	i
eyes	c
,	i
they	c
were	c
really	c
fascinating	c
.	c

The	c
things	c
you	c
wrote	c
about	c
the	c
rules	c
made	c
me	c
think	c
for	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
and	c
I	c
understood	c
that	c
some	c
really	c
do	c
n't	c
make	c
any	c
sense	c
!	c

Our	c
school	c
is	c
really	c
very	c
diciplined	i
,	c
especially	c
about	c
our	c
clothes	c
and	c
behaviours	i
.	c

Do	c
we	c
become	c
the	c
"	c
perfect	c
one	c
"	c
then	c
?	c

I	c
'm	c
allowed	c
to	c
do	c
whatever	c
I	c
want	c
at	i
my	c
room	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
I	c
show	c
these	c
three	c
to	c
them	c
.	c

Love	c
,	c

But	c
if	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
choose	c
,	c
I	c
prefer	c
sleep	i
in	c
tents	c
,	c
because	c
when	c
I	c
travel	c
I	c
usually	c
sleep	c
in	c
that	c
kind	c
of	c
accommodation	c
so	c
,	c
for	c
me	c
they	c
seem	c
very	c
comfortable	c
.	c

-	c
Climbing	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
climbed	c
in	c
my	c
life	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
dream	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
do	c
that	c
.	c

I	c
wonder	i
to	c
know	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
wear	c
because	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
how	c
the	c
weather	c
is	c
in	c
U.S.A.	i
Also	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
bring	c
to	i
the	c
trip	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hear	i
from	c
you	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
a	c
friend	c
and	c
she	c
knows	c
that	c
I	c
speak	c
English	c
so	i
she	c
offered	c
to	i
me	c
work	c
with	c
an	c
English	c
singer	c
so	i
I	c
said	i
"	i
yes	i
,	i
of	c
course	c
"	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
are	c
O.K.	c
and	c
write	c
soon	c
.	c

P.D.	c
I	c
send	i
you	c
an	c
autograph	c
that	c
Sting	c
wrote	c
for	c
you	c
.	c

I	c
have	i
read	i
your	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
show	c
and	i
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
to	c
see	c
it	c
but	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
very	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
.	c

Also	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
and	c
I	c
do	c
not	c
know	c
why	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
read	c
the	c
advertisement	c
,	c
it	c
said	c
that	c
the	c
restaurand	i
would	c
be	c
opened	i
.	c

Lastly	c
,	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
that	c
I	c
had	i
not	c
a	i
perfect	c
evening	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
be	c
grateful	c
if	c
you	c
could	i
send	c
me	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
not	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

Pat	c
was	c
my	c
best	c
friend	c
.	c

Pat	c
did	c
not	c
believe	c
me	c
and	c
she	c
started	i
to	i
ask	i
why	c
.	c

She	c
helped	c
me	c
to	c
forget	c
it	c
for	c
a	c
few	c
minutes	c
,	c
she	c
made	c
me	c
to	i
laugh	i
and	c
the	i
she	c
left	c
.	c

The	c
other	i
morning	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
school	c
and	c
all	c
the	c
students	c
came	c
next	i
to	c
me	c
and	c
told	c
me	c
not	c
to	c
be	c
mad	i
because	c
of	c
my	c
parents	c
.	c

We	c
are	c
very	c
grateful	c
to	c
you	c
for	c
these	c
three	c
days	c
that	c
we	c
are	c
going	c
to	c
spend	c
in	c
the	c
English	c
capital	c
,	c
especially	c
because	c
you	c
planned	i
very	c
interesting	c
and	c
different	c
kinds	c
of	c
things	c
to	i
do	i
for	i
all	i
us	i
.	c

However	c
,	c
all	i
we	i
agree	c
that	c
we	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
introduce	i
a	c
visit	c
to	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
in	i
the	c
Central	c
Exhibition	c
Hall	c
of	c
London	c
in	c
the	c
trip	c
organisation	i
.	c

It	c
is	c
a	c
very	c
good	c
chance	c
to	c
join	i
this	c
exhibition	c
to	c
see	c
all	c
the	c
new	c
fashion	i
tendences	i
,	c
the	c
latest	c
hairstyles	c
and	c
make	i
up	i
as	c
all	c
we	i
came	i
from	c
many	c
different	c
countries	c
and	c
have	i
not	i
the	c
same	c
customs	c
either	i
.	c

As	c
the	c
show	c
is	c
held	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
from	c
10:00	c
to	c
19:00	c
we	c
could	c
go	c
there	c
instead	c
of	c
doing	i
shopping	c
in	c
the	c
afternoon	c
.	c

We	c
do	c
hope	c
you	c
like	c
our	c
suggestion	c
and	c
we	c
can	c
have	i
an	i
agreement	i
to	c
join	i
the	c
fashion	c
exhibition	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerelly	i
,	c

So	c
they	c
need	c
to	c
become	c
famous	c
to	c
be	c
what	c
they	c
want	c
and	c
if	c
the	c
people	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
them	c
,	c
they	c
are	c
forgotten	c
,	c
they	c
die	c
...	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
for	c
me	c
is	i
very	c
difficult	c
which	i
group	c
has	i
the	i
reason	i
but	c
,	c
by	i
the	c
moment	c
,	c
we	c
should	c
try	c
to	c
respect	c
each	c
other	c
and	c
go	i
in	i
the	i
other	i
's	i
soul	i
to	i
feel	i
like	i
them	i
in	i
those	i
moments	i
we	i
cannot	i
understand	i
them	i
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
must	c
admit	c
that	c
when	c
we	c
realised	c
the	c
main	c
character	i
had	c
been	c
changed	c
we	c
felt	c
really	c
disappointed	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
you	c
ought	c
to	c
be	c
more	c
serious	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
commitent	i
you	c
have	c
with	i
the	c
people	c
who	c
comes	i
to	c
your	c
theatre	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

I	c
had	c
always	c
thought	c
that	c
I	c
could	c
rely	c
on	c
her	c
whatever	c
my	c
problem	c
was	c
.	c

Yet	c
,	c
one	c
extremly	i
hot	c
day	c
while	c
I	c
was	c
pacefully	i
walking	c
by	c
the	c
sea	c
and	c
thinking	c
about	c
my	c
own	c
problems	c
I	i
discovered	c
my	c
elder	c
brother	c
's	c
girlfriend	c
with	c
another	c
boy	c
.	c

Nevertheless	c
,	c
when	c
I	c
found	c
him	c
studying	c
harder	i
for	c
his	c
final	c
exams	c
I	c
realised	c
I	c
would	c
rather	c
her	i
girlfriend	c
explained	i
my	c
poor	c
brother	c
the	c
truth	c
.	c

After	c
that	c
,	c
she	c
felt	c
completely	i
sad	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
love	c
she	c
had	c
been	c
feeling	c
for	c
my	c
brother	c
for	c
several	c
years	c
and	c
she	c
swore	c
me	i
that	c
she	c
was	c
going	c
to	c
tell	i
it	i
to	i
nobody	i
.	c

Among	i
the	c
activities	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
choose	c
painting	c
-	c
which	c
I	c
am	c
keen	c
on	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
done	c
several	c
courses	c
-	c
,and	i
Photography	c
-	c
from	i
which	c
I	c
know	c
just	c
the	c
basical	i
skills	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

But	c
it	c
can	c
also	c
be	c
dangerous	c
.	c

After	c
all	c
that	c
we	i
can	c
notice	i
that	c
shopping	c
can	c
be	c
a	c
good	c
option	i
as	c
long	c
as	c
we	c
can	c
choose	c
other	c
enjoyable	c
activities	c
for	c
our	c
free	c
time	c
.	c

Last	c
week	c
I	c
stayed	i
in	i
London	c
for	c
holidays	i
.	c

In	c
the	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
show	c
I	c
also	c
read	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
going	c
to	c
begin	c
at	c
half	c
past	c
seven	c
p.m.	c
but	c
,	c
in	i
fact	i
,	c
it	c
began	c
at	c
eight	c
fifteen	c
.	c

In	c
spite	c
of	c
it	c
was	i
said	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
.	i

In	c
the	c
advertisement	c
there	c
's	c
no	c
mention	c
about	i
getting	c
any	c
money	c
back	c
but	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
was	c
such	c
a	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
that	c
you	c
should	c
give	c
it	i
back	c
to	c
me	c
.	c

Firstly	c
In	i
the	c
advertisement	c
you	c
said	c
that	c
the	c
actor	c
would	c
be	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
but	c
there	c
was	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
in	c
the	c
show	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
really	c
disappointed	c
,	i
because	c
I	c
was	c
really	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
seeing	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
which	i
I	c
personally	c
admire	c
.	c

Mrs	c
Lemmings	c
.	i

It	c
's	c
something	c
absoletuly	i
necessary	c
for	c
every	c
action	c
people	c
does	i
It	i
effects	i
us	c
both	c
positive	i
and	c
negative	i
.	c

I	c
've	c
end	i
up	c
being	c
a	c
T.V	i
addict	c

There	c
's	c
no	c
need	c
on	i
going	i
to	c
the	c
shops	c
when	c
I	c
can	c
order	c
things	c
by	i
the	c
computer	c
.	c

But	c
also	c
we	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
visit	c
The	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
show	i
that	c
will	c
be	c
held	c
at	c
the	c
Central	c
kExhibition	i
hall	i
on	c
Tuesday	c
March	c
14	c
from	c
10:00	c
-	c
19:00	c
.	c

IT	c
WAS	c
DANGEROUS	c
,	c
BUT	c
I	c
KNEW	c
I	c
HAD	c
TO	c
DO	c
IT	c
.	c

Since	i
always	i
I	i
'd	i
gotten	i
the	i
idea	i
of	i
travel	i
abroad	c
and	c
experiece	i
others	i
people	c
's	c
life	i
and	c
cultures	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
Paris	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
I	c
finished	c
university	c
.	c

I	c
arrived	c
in	c
Paris	c
for	i
New	c
Years	i
Eve	c
2000	c
without	c
a	c
place	c
to	c
stay	c
,	c
not	c
speaking	c
any	c
French	c
,	c
alone	c
and	c
with	c
a	c
little	i
amount	c
of	c
money	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
going	c
to	c
stay	c
here	c
a	i
week	c
.	c

The	i
last	i
Monday	c
,	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
with	c
two	c
friends	c
.	c

When	c
there	c
was	c
a	i
restful	i
we	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
restaurant	c
which	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
late	c
.	c

We	c
could	c
n't	c
have	c
a	c
drink	c
.	c

Well	c
I	c
believe	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
bad	c
day	c
but	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
you	c
to	c
give	c
my	i
money	c
back	c
because	c
on	i
the	c
advertisement	c
there	c
was	i
some	c
things	c
that	c
we	c
had	i
n't	i
in	i
the	c
theatre	c
.	c

Moreover	c
you	c
can	c
change	c
the	c
TV	c
programme	c
without	c
getting	c
up	c
.	c

We	c
can	c
find	c
information	c
about	c
the	c
weather	c
,	i
sports	c
on	c
our	c
TV-text	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
sure	c
that	c
in	c
a	c
couple	c
of	c
years	c
we	c
will	c
see	c
cured	i
some	i
illness	i
like	i
cancer	i
,	i
UTH	i
.	c

Dear	c
sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

But	c
your	c
starrings	i
were	c
not	c
.	i

It	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
and	c
that	c
waisted	i
my	c
time	c
and	c
made	c
me	c
feel	c
bad	c
about	c
your	c
service	i
.	c

My	c
telephone	c
number	c
is	c
123-4567	c
.	c

Thesedays	i
we	c
are	c
living	c
on	i
a	c
high-technology	c
world	c
.	c

Modern	c
technology	c
has	c
been	c
growing	i
rapidly	c
and	c
it	c
has	c
effected	i
me	c
a	c
lot	c
.	c

Using	c
the	c
internet	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
search	i
for	i
almost	c
all	c
information	i
I	c
want	c
to	c
know	i
.	c

Thirdly	c
,	c
the	c
disappointment	c
made	c
me	c
a	c
bit	c
hungry	c
but	c
the	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
without	c
any	c
sign	c
saying	c
why	c
.	c

Sincerely	c
Yours	c
,	c

The	c
modern	c
cooker	c
will	c
turn	c
off	i
itself	i
if	c
something	c
goes	c
wrong	c
!	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
on	c
behalf	c
of	c
students	i
in	c
your	c
English	c
class	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
some	c
students	c
have	c
seen	c
an	c
advertisements	i
for	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
and	c
we	c
all	i
like	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

Therefore	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
suggest	c
that	c
on	c
Monday	c
13	c
and	c
Wednesday	c
14	c
of	c
March	c
,	c
we	c
still	c
stick	c
with	c
your	c
plan	c
.	c

I	i
was	c
dangerous	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
knew	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
.	c

We	c
knew	c
that	c
our	c
teacher	c
kept	c
the	c
exam	c
papers	c
in	c
her	c
desk	c
.	c

One	c
of	c
my	c
friend	i
came	c
up	c
with	c
the	c
idea	c
that	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
steal	c
them	c
.	c

That	c
was	c
the	c
most	c
scarely	i
and	c
daring	c
thing	c
that	c
I	c
did	c
in	c
my	c
childhood	c
.	c

First	c
you	c
have	c
written	c
that	c
the	c
starring	i
were	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
,	c
but	c
the	c
real	i
actors	c
were	c
different	c
.	c

Over	i
these	i
the	i
tickets	i
were	i
not	i
discount	i
available	c
as	c
you	c
have	i
written	c
in	i
your	c
advertisement	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
and	c
so	c
his	c
hole	i
schoole	i
knew	c
from	i
Sara	c
's	c
experience	c
.	c

She	c
did	c
n't	c
learn	i
a	c
lot	c
but	c
she	c
knew	c
all	c
important	i
things	c
.	c

Sara	c
could	c
n't	c
understand	c
the	c
fact	c
,	i
that	c
she	c
did	c
n't	c
do	c
the	c
right	c
thing	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
inform	c
you	c
whed	i
the	c
idea	c
was	c
great	c
and	c
I	c
hope	c
that	c
so	i
needful	i
for	i
people	i
events	i
would	i
become	i
a	c
good	c
tradition	c
in	c
our	c
country	c
.	c

I	c
suggest	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
very	c
intresting	i
to	c
meet	c
artists	c
from	c
far	i
and	c
exotic	c
countries	c
.	c

Event	i
this	c
year	c
some	c
halls	c
,	i
which	c
I	c
had	i
visited	i
were	c
overcrowded	c
and	c
there	c
were	c
some	c
problems	c
with	c
ventilation	c
during	c
some	c
shows	c

Want	c
to	c
be	c
independent	c
?	c

But	c
then	i
you	c
are	c
at	c
the	i
university	c
you	c
need	c
money	c
more	c
,	i
then	i
anybody	i
else	i
want	i
.	c

Many	c
young	c
people	c
earn	c
their	c
pocket	c
money	c
so	i
,	c
helping	c
neighbouring	i
parents	i
to	c
have	c
a	c
bit	c
more	c
spare	c
time	c
.	c

Sometimes	c
small	c
groups	c
of	c
students	c
organized	i
their	c
own	c
small	c
business	c
.	c

The	c
reason	c
I	c
am	c
writing	c
this	c
letter	c
is	c
to	c
congratulate	c
you	c
for	i
the	c
International	c
Arts	c
Festival	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
the	c
festival	c
was	c
fine	c
but	c
in	c
my	c
opinion	c
there	c
must	i
be	c
some	c
improvements	c
to	c
make	c
this	c
festival	c
better	c
.	c

In	c
contrast	c
with	c
the	c
halls	c
,	c
the	c
concerts	c
were	c
great	c
and	c
I	c
saw	c
everybody	c
enjoyed	c
then	c
.	c

I	c
must	c
admit	c
that	c
you	c
are	i
very	c
successful	c
about	i
finding	c
good	c
stars	c
.	c

Dear	c
Elinor	c
,	c

The	c
school	c
rules	c
are	c
horrible	c
here	c
.	c

How	c
poor	c
their	c
imagination	i
are	c
!	c
!	c

You	c
could	i
do	c
anything	c
you	c
like	c
as	c
long	c
as	c
you	c
have	c
good	c
grades	c
.	c

Nobody	c
likes	c
to	c
study	c
but	c
we	c
have	c
to	c
.	c

Love	c
,	c

To	c
the	c
manager	c
of	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
not	c
too	c
happy	c
about	c
that	c
and	c
why	c
did	c
n't	c
the	c
theatre	i
start	c
when	c
it	c
was	c
suposed	i
to	c
start	c
?	c

I	c
have	c
got	c
friends	c
over	c
the	c
whole	c
world	c
now	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
glad	c
that	c
all	c
accommodation	c
and	c
travel	c
costs	c
are	c
paid	c
,	c
but	c
even	i
though	i
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
do	i
I	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
with	c
me	c
.	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

Then	c
I	c
woke	c
up	c
;	c
well	c
,	c
I	c
shall	c
never	c
know	c
what	c
happened	c
to	c
the	c

First	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c

I	c

For	c

My	c

Lastly	c

I	c

kind	c
of	c

At	c
first	c
I	c
just	c
helped	c
setting	c
up	c
the	c
stage	c
;	c
setting	c
microphones	c
,	c
and	c
tuning	c
guiters	i
.	c

When	c
I	c
was	c
doing	c
it	c
,	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
staff	c
called	c
me	c
and	c
brought	i
me	c
to	c
a	c
room	c
.	c

You	c
wrote	c
to	c
me	c
that	c
I	c
can	c
choice	i
my	c
accommodation	c
.	c

You	c
wrote	c
to	c
me	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
a	c
chance	c
to	c
do	c
two	c
activities	c
,	c
which	c
I	c
can	c
choice	i
.	c

I	c
'll	c
be	c
very	c
happy	c
when	i
you	c
can	c
give	c
me	c
a	c
chance	c
to	c
use	c
the	c
camp	c

and	c
you	c
'll	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
prepare	c
some	c
paiting	i
's	i
materials	c
like	c
oil	c
paints	c
canvas	i
and	c
bruches	i
for	c
me	c
.	c

The	c
size	c
of	c
the	c
canvas	c
is	c
n't	c
so	c
important	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
I	c
'll	c
have	c
possibility	i
to	c
improve	c
my	c
ability	c
in	c
it	c

Could	c
you	c
write	c
to	c
me	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
need	c
and	c
what	c
type	c

Last	c
month	c
we	c
had	c
the	c
pop	c
concert	c
of	c
our	c
favourite	c
polish	i
group	c
"	c
THE	c
CULT	c
"	c
in	c
Warshaw	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
working	c
like	c
crazy	c
but	c
I	c
enjoyed	c
a	i
lot	c
.	c

Could	c
you	c
imagine	c
that	c
they	c
asked	c
me	c
to	c
make	c
the	c
summer	c
scenography	c
.	c

I	c
heard	c
,	c
the	c
atmosphere	c
of	c
their	c
concerts	c
is	c
very	c
hot	c
but	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
know	c
they	c
like	c
to	c
create	c
this	c
even	c
by	c
scenography	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
the	c
result	c
of	c
that	c
action	c
was	c
marvelous	i

I	c
like	i
a	i
lot	i
the	i
mountains	i
which	i
I	i
made	i

In	c
front	c
of	c
the	c
stage	c
I	c
put	c
the	c
grass	c
and	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
flowers	c
.	c

They	c
are	c
very	c
nice	c
people	i
even	i
Audrey	c
who	c
seems	c
very	c
stupid	c
.	c

I	c
told	c
them	c
about	c
you	c
and	c
they	c
said	c
we	c
are	c
very	c
welcome	c
any	c
time	c

We	c
'll	c

about	c
it	c

In	c

about	i

I	c
convinced	c
them	c
to	c
go	c

My	c

are	c
very	c
keen	c
on	c
theatre	c
,	c
especially	c
of	i
the	c
funny	c

Danny	c

When	c
we	c

your	c

we	c
made	c
a	c
reservation	c

next	c
evening	c
,	c
one	c
hour	c
before	c
the	c
beginning	c
of	c
the	c

we	c
learnt	c

Sir	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
my	c
expectations	c
have	i
not	i
been	i
realized	c
because	c
of	c
many	i
problems	c
I	c
had	c
during	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
delayed	c
and	c
started	c
at	c
20.15	c
so	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
wait	c
45	c
minutes	c
doing	i
absolutely	c
nothing	c
and	c
wasting	c
my	c
time	c

No	c

were	c
given	c
and	c
,	c
what	c
is	c
more	c
,	c
your	c
theatre	c

was	c
closed	c
all	i
the	i
time	c

I	c
ask	c
you	c
for	i

I	c
will	c

the	c

way	c
to	c

a	c

of	c

the	c

every	c

inform	c
you	c
that	c
I	c

I	c
will	c

However	c
,	c
in	c
your	c
letter	c
is	i
written	i
some	c
activities	c

I	c
would	c
choose	c
Basketball	c
and	c
Tennis	c

Also	c
Tennis	i
is	c
my	c
favourite	c
hobby	c
and	c
I	c
play	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c

In	c

ask	c
my	c
parents	c
for	c
money	c
,	c
and	c
going	c
on	c

As	c
regards	c
accommodation	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
stay	c

because	c
I	c
used	c
to	c
going	i
on	c
holiday	c
with	c
my	c
friends	c
and	c
staying	i
in	c
tents	c

I	c

Could	c

what	c
sorts	c
of	c

I	c

The	c

I	c
have	c
just	c

your	c

you	c

I	c
have	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
the	c
competition	c
and	c
now	c
,	i
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
express	c
my	c
opinion	c
about	c
the	c
questions	c
you	c
have	c
written	c
on	i
it	c
.	c

I	c
know	c
I	c
will	c
have	c
the	c
chance	c
to	c
do	c
two	c
activities	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
have	c
choosen	i
two	c
from	c
your	c
list	c
:	c
Basketball	i
,	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
playing	c
it	c
since	c
I	c
was	c
eight	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
taking	i

in	i
a	c
strong	c
team	c
for	c
three	c
years	c

But	c
,	c
what	c
about	c
clothes	c
,	c
money	c
,	c
food	c
?	c

Yours	c
faithfuly	i

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
to	i
do	i
shopping	c
is	c
often	c
funny	i
,	c
above	c
all	c
when	c
you	c
can	c
enter	c
without	i
difficulties	i
into	i
a	i
shop	i
.	c

Shopping	c
is	c
a	c
funny	i
thing	c
to	c
do	c
,	c
not	c
when	c
you	c
are	c
in	c
a	c
hurry	c
,	c
but	c
when	c
you	c
have	c
free	i
time	c
and	c
when	c
you	c
can	c
relax	c
yourself	i
.	c

Another	c
thing	c
that	c
regardes	i
me	i
,	c
is	c
that	c
I	c
enjoy	c
my	i
self	i
more	c
when	c
I	c
know	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
do	i
shopping	c
for	c
me	i
than	c
when	c
it	c
's	c
for	c
my	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

The	c
play	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
start	c
at	c
19.30	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
delayed	c
so	i
at	c
20.15	c
a	i
curtain	c
of	c
the	c
stage	c
was	c
pulled	i
up	i
.	c

As	c
soon	c
as	c
the	c
play	c
had	c
started	c
I	c
noticed	c
another	c
problem	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

I	c
remember	c
some	c
sientific	i
cartoons	i
when	i
I	i
was	i
younger	i
I	i
watched	i
on	i
television	i
.	c

Modern	c
technology	c
has	c
been	c
changing	c
even	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
in	c
positive	c
and	c
negative	c
ways	c
at	c
the	c
same	c
time	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
a	i
car	c
is	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
most	c
common	c
products	c
of	c
modern	c
technology	c
.	c

The	c
more	c
cars	c
there	c
are	c
on	c
the	c
street	c
,	c
the	c
more	c
difficult	c
it	c
is	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
keep	c
myself	c
fit	c
.	c

In	c
spite	c
of	c
its	c
good	c
sides	c
I	i
think	c
my	c
life	c
could	c
get	c
worse	c
.	c

I	c
suppose	c
people	c
including	i
me	c
should	i
keep	i
themselves	i
in	i
a	i
limited	i
their	i
own	i
space	i
in	i
near	i
future	i
.	i

But	c
could	c
you	c
,	c
please	c
,	c
let	c
me	c
have	c
more	c
details	c
about	c
my	c
award	i
.	c

What	c
kind	c
of	c
people	c
will	c
be	c
invited	c
at	i
your	c
Camp	c
in	i
this	c
summer	c
?	c

I	c
must	c
be	c
honest	c
:	c
I	c
'm	c
not	c
very	c
keen	c
on	c
sport	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
glad	c
to	c
swimming	i
and	c
sailing	c
for	c
some	i
weeks	c
.	c

And	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
nice	c
audience	c
for	c
my	c
poetry	c
as	c
well	c
,	i
I	c
'm	c
a	c
poet	c
,	c
yeas	i
.	c

Sent	i
me	c
,	c
please	c
,	c
news	c
about	c
July	c
.	c

But	c
now	c
all	i
things	i
became	i
absolutly	i
changed	i
!	c

I	c
found	c
the	c
kind	c
of	c
activity	c
what	i
I	c
looking	i
for	c
four	i
ages	c
.	c

My	c
Russian	c
friend	c
ivited	i
me	c
to	c
set	c
up	c
a	i
new	i
exiting	i
business	c
.	c

We	c
were	i
renting	i
for	c
him	c
a	c
special	c
hall	c
near	c
Piccadilly	c
Circus	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
a	c
nice	c
expirience	i
as	c
manager	c
too	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
be	c
a	c
professional	c
in	c
this	c
stage	i
,	c
yeas	i

Good	c
luck	c
to	c
you	c
as	c
well	c

P.S.	c
Your	c
present	c
,	c
a	c
small	c
toy	c
,	c
a	c
white	c
hose	i
-	c
I	c
always	c
keep	c
with	c
me	c

it	c
helps	c
me	c
to	c
pass	c
my	c
exams	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
everything	c
at	c
the	c
shopping	i
is	c
more	c
expensive	c
,	c
because	c
the	c
people	c
that	c
buy	i
on	i
it	i
usually	c
do	c
n't	c
compare	c
prices	c
or	c
look	c
for	c
cheaper	c
shops	c
,	c
because	c
all	c
they	c
need	c
it	i
is	c
already	c
at	c
this	c
place	c
.	c

There	c
were	c
many	c
things	c
that	c
were	c
wrong	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
I	c
saw	c
.	c

But	c
the	c
problems	c
started	c
while	i
I	c
arrived	c
the	i
place	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
a	c
discount	c
for	i
it	i
,	c
but	c
they	c
refussed	i
it	c
and	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
pay	c
the	c
full	c
price	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
this	i
reasons	c
are	c
suficiently	i
enough	i
to	c
ask	c
for	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

I	c
also	c
had	i
to	c
tell	c
you	c
that	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
there	c
were	c
few	i
people	c
there	c
and	c
they	c
take	i
me	i
out	i
of	i
the	c
place	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
upset	c
.	c

The	c
point	c
here	c
is	c
,	i
that	c
Caroline	c
choosed	i
the	c
worst	c
friend	c
to	c
told	i
this	c
.	i

She	c
was	c
also	c
concerned	c
about	c
being	c
pregned	i
,	c
but	c
she	c
was	c
afraid	c
to	c
told	i
John	c
about	c
it	c
.	c

When	c
she	c
finally	c
told	c
him	c
,	c
Pat	c
react	i
in	c
a	c
very	c
wrong	i
way	c
and	c
told	i
rapidly	i
to	i
John	i
.	c

We	c
know	c
we	c
are	c
going	c
for	c
three	i
days	c
,	c
but	c
we	c
'll	c
have	c
enough	c
time	c
to	c
use	i
one	c
of	c
the	c
bigger	i
city	i
in	c
the	c
world	c
.	c

We	c
all	i
very	c
happy	c
with	c
your	c
programme	c
,	c
especially	i
we	i
like	c
the	c
idea	c
of	c
sightseeing	i
by	c
our	i
and	c
National	i
Art	c
Gallery	c

The	c
students	c
in	c
my	c
class	c
have	c
seen	c
an	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
,	c
we	i
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
if	c
is	i
possible	c
to	c
make	c
some	c
changes	c
in	i
the	c
programme	c
?	i

I	c
think	c
for	c
all	c
of	c
us	c
home	c
is	c
something	c
which	c
is	c
a	i
very	c
important	c
.	c

We	c
call	c
home	c
the	c
place	c
where	c
we	c
live	c
or	c
the	c
country	c
where	c
we	c
come	c
frome	i
.	c

Propably	i
in	c
the	c
future	c
we	c
might	i
be	c
to	i
busy	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
our	c
own	c
home	c
and	c
spend	c
some	c
time	c
there	c
.	c

But	c
in	i
the	c
end	c
of	c
the	c
day	c
it	c
alway	i
will	i
be	c
place	i
to	c
go	c
!	c

In	c
addition	c
,	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
busy	c
with	c
my	c
cousework	i
in	c
August	c
.	c

Lastly	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
some	c
questions	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
.	c

Since	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
been	c
to	c
U.S.A	i
,	c
I	c
know	c
nothing	c
about	c
it	c
.	c

Best	c
wishes	c
.	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c

In	c
my	c
view	c
,	c
the	c
answer	c
is	c
,	c
NO	c
.	c

Would	c
you	c
say	c
that	c
shopping	c
is	c
enjoyable	c
?	c

Then	c
she	c
spent	c
all	c
her	c
spare	c
time	c
doing	c
part-time	c
jobs	c
to	c
earn	c
money	c
.	c

But	c
it	c
was	c
just	c
not	c
there	c
!	c

Helen	c
Ryan	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
this	c
great	c
opportunity	c
to	c
travel	c
with	c
you	c
for	c
free	c
!	c

I	c
would	c
also	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
in	c
advance	c
the	c
amount	c
of	c
money	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
bring	c
for	c
expenses	c
that	c
will	c
not	c
be	c
included	c
.	c

Most	c
of	c
us	c
would	c
agree	c
on	c
that	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
who	c
has	c
the	c
freedom	c
to	c
buy	c
with	i
an	i
unlimited	i
budget	i
whatever	i
they	i
need	i
?	c

And	c
whenever	c
money	c
is	c
involved	c
,	c
some	c
problems	c
are	c
likely	c
to	c
happen	i
.	c

But	c
even	c
without	c
money	c
to	c
spend	c
is	i
fun	c
to	c
rush	c
from	c
time	c
to	c
time	c
in	i
the	c
sales	c
that	c
seasonaly	i
appear	c
,	c
or	c
simply	c
look	c
at	c
the	c
superb	c
displays	c
that	c
shops	c
have	c
in	c
their	c
showrooms	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
seen	c
your	c
letter	c
for	i
Camp	c
California	c
in	c
the	c
U.S.A	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
pretty	c
busy	c
with	c
my	c
studies	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
working	c
with	c
my	c
dad	c
in	c
his	c
office	c
now	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
tents	i
because	c
I	c
like	c
being	c
in	c
contact	c
with	c
the	i
nature	c
life	i
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
from	c
the	c
list	c
of	c
activities	c
that	c
you	c
are	i
also	i
state	i
in	c
the	c
letter	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
swimming	c
because	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
child	c
I	c
practised	i
this	c
sport	c
for	c
8	c
years	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
it	i
would	c
be	c
grateful	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
clarify	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
must	c
be	i
taken	i
and	c
how	c
much	c
I	c
will	c
spend	c
during	c
the	c
stay	c
at	c
the	c
Camp	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c

Jane	c

Dear	c
Mrs.	c
Ryan	c
:	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
complete	c
debutant	i
concerning	i
surfing	c
.	c

This	c
sport	c
has	c
always	c
attracted	c
me	c
due	c
to	c
its	c
contact	c
with	c
the	c
sea	c
and	c
the	c
great	c
sensations	c
it	c
provides	c
and	c
I	c
believe	c
this	c
is	c
the	c
perfect	c
occasion	i
to	c
initiate	i
myself	c
to	c
the	i
exciting	c
sport	c
,	i
I	c
still	c
have	c
some	c
questions	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
:	c

Shopping	c
seems	c
to	c
be	c
a	c
true	c
pleasure	c
at	c
first	c
:	c
spending	c
money	c
for	i
yourself	c
or	c
people	c
you	c
appreciate	i
is	c
very	c
satisfying	c
and	c
enjoyable	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
can	c
also	c
be	c
a	c
real	c
nightmare	c
.	c

You	c
often	c
enter	c
a	c
shop	c
and	c
see	c
people	c
everywhere	c
so	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
squeeze	c
yourself	c
through	c
the	c
alleys	i
to	c
take	c
a	c
look	c
at	c
a	c
product	c
.	c

After	c
long	c
hours	c
of	c
hesitation	c
,	c
you	c
decide	c
to	c
buy	c
a	c
product	c
but	c
discover	c
that	c
it	c
is	c
out	i
of	i
price	i
.	c

Frustrated	c
,	c
you	c
nevertheless	c
pick	c
something	c
cheaper	c
and	c
advance	c
towards	c
the	c
cashiers	c
.	c

There	c
,	c
you	c
find	c
an	c
enormous	c
queue	c
waiting	c
for	c
you	c
but	c
you	c
still	c
have	c
to	c
stay	i
up	c
even	c
though	c
your	c
tired	c
legs	c
demand	c
a	c
seat	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
enquire	c
about	c
the	c
competition	c
that	c
I	c
won	c
and	c
give	c
some	c
details	c
to	c
you	c
about	c
myself	c
and	c
my	c
interests	c
.	c

Because	i
of	i
these	c
reasons	c
,	c
I	c
choose	c
basketball	c
and	c
swimming	c
from	c
the	c
list	c
which	c
were	i
given	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
what	c
types	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
need	c
and	c
beside	c
this	c
,	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
need	c
during	c
my	c
vacation	c
.	c

They	c
had	c
a	c
concert	c
in	c
my	c
hometown	i
that	i
's	c
why	c
the	c
organizators	i
were	c
looking	c
for	c
young	c
people	c
who	c
can	i
speak	c
English	c
.	c

I	c
took	i
part	i
in	c
the	c
security	c
department	c
.	c

Basicly	i
,	c
I	c
helped	c
them	c
connecting	i
with	c
the	c
local	c
police	c
and	c
getting	i
some	c
electronical	i
equipments	i
that	c
they	c
needed	c
.	c

By	c
the	c
way	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
already	c
been	c
invited	c
their	i
next	c
concernt	i
.	c

They	c
gave	c
me	c
two	c
free	c
tickets	c
.	c

Would	c
you	c
like	c
to	c
come	c
with	c
me	c
?	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
sleep	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
used	c
to	c
it	c
.	c

You	c
wrote	c
that	c
I	c
should	c
choose	c
two	c
activities	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
chosen	c
golf	c
because	c
I	c
playing	i
golf	c
sine	i
1998	c
and	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
improve	c
it	i
and	c
then	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
start	c
a	c
new	c
kind	c
of	c
sport	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
start	c
with	i
climbing	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
fantastic	c
sunny	c
day	c
and	c
we	c
went	c
to	c
Frankfurt	c
and	c
I	c
really	c
needed	c
shows	i
and	c
it	c
is	c
not	c
easy	c
to	c
buy	c
shoes	c
you	i
have	c
to	c
choose	c
carefully	c
.	c

This	c
was	c
for	c
me	c
the	c
only	c
shopping	c
tour	i
which	c
was	c
not	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
my	c
advise	i
is	c
that	c
the	i
women	c
should	c
go	c
alone	c
or	c
with	c
a	c
female	c
friend	c
.	c

My	c
second	c
choice	c
,	i
it	i
is	c
Basketball	i
.	c

For	c
these	c
two	c
weeks	c

what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	i
must	i
take	c

The	c
concert	c
sarted	c
at	c
6:00	c
pm	c
until	i
2:00	c
am	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
started	c
to	c
work	c
at	c
12:00	c
pm	c
to	c
prepear	i
the	c
scene	i
with	c
the	c
musicians	c
.	c

When	c
the	c
concert	c
started	c
I	c
had	c
to	i
look	i
round	i
if	c
anybody	c
threw	c
bottles	c
or	c
something	i
else	c
on	c
the	c
scene	i
.	c

I	c
also	c
helped	c
to	c
serve	c
people	c
who	c
would	c
like	c
drink	i
,	i
I	c
was	c
like	c
a	c
barman	c
.	c

I	c
saw	c
old	c
people	c
,	c
child	i
....	c
and	c
for	c
me	c
it	c
was	c
very	c
strange	c
and	c
it	c
was	c
very	c
interessting	i
,	c
because	c
I	c
met	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
people	c
and	c
the	c
best	c
thing	c
was	c
that	c
I	c
knew	c
the	c
pop	c
group	c
who	c
sang	c
,	i
it	i
was	c
fantastic	c
.	c

Write	c
me	i
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c
.	c

I	c
enjoyed	c
myself	c
very	c
much	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
the	c
organization	c
of	c
the	c
next	c
festival	c
could	c
be	c
better	c
.	c

I	c
saw	c
films	c
and	c
I	c
played	c
ping-pong	c
.	c

In	i
the	c
next	c
edition	i
will	c
be	i
more	c
or	c
less	c
?	i

I	i
hope	i
more	i
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	i

I	c
always	c
prefer	c
read	i
books	c
that	c
are	c
inusual	i
in	c
some	c
way	c
,	c
because	c
they	c
give	c
me	c
the	c
opportunity	c
of	i
escape	i
from	c
the	i
everyday	c
reality	c
.	c

The	c
attention	c
of	c
the	c
is	i
focused	c
on	c
the	c
unfortunate	c
love	c
of	i
Heatcliff	c
and	c
Catherine	c
.	c

I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
show	c
,	i
"	c
OVER	c
THE	c
RAINBOW	c
"	c
a	c
few	c
days	c
ago	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
this	c
letter	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
how	c
I	i
felt	i
disappointed	i
with	c
it	c
.	c

As	i
I	i
am	i
writing	i
,	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
a	c
perfect	c
evening	c
at	c
all	c
but	c
horrible	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
for	c
money	i
back	c
and	c
compensate	i
for	c
my	c
special	c
20th	c
birthday	c
.	c

Faithfully	c
yours	c
,	c

Some	c
are	c
in	i
formal	i
others	c
are	c
in	i
casual	c
.	c

Especially	c
in	c
big	c
cities	c
such	c
as	c
London	c
,	c
New	c
York	c
and	c
Tokyo	c
,	c
you	c
can	c
see	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
people	c
in	c
various	c
clothes	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
do	c
not	c
think	c
there	c
will	c
be	c
such	c
big	c
differences	c
in	c
outlooking	i
of	c
clothes	c
even	c
100	c
years	c
from	c
now	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
,	i
there	c
will	c
be	c
some	c
diffences	i
in	c
quality	i
and	c
materials	c
of	c
clothes	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Ryan	c
,	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
express	c
my	c
joy	c
for	i
having	c
won	c
that	i
prize	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
happy	c
.	c

Thirdly	c
,	c
I	c
prefer	c
staying	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
than	i
staying	c
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
more	c
fun	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
tennis	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forwards	i
to	c
receiving	c
more	c
information	c
.	c

Sofia	c
Jordana	c

The	c
car	i
park	i
of	i
the	i
supermarket	i
is	c
full	c
.	c

No	i
more	c
trolleys	i
for	i
shopping	i
.	c

All	c
the	c
shops	c
are	c
crowded	c
.	c

Some	c
people	c
are	c
in	c
a	c
hurry	c
other	i
are	c
agressive	i
and	c
most	c
of	c
the	c
other	i
are	c
very	c
stressed	c
.	c

We	c
have	c
more	c
and	c
more	c
shops	c
everywhere	c
and	c
they	c
sale	i
everything	c
.	c

It	i
is	c
also	c
the	c
reason	c
why	c
we	c
have	c
all	c
these	c
new	c
supermarkets	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
especially	i
when	c
there	c
is	i
too	c
many	c
people	c
in	c
there	i
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
the	c
actors	c
that	c
played	c
the	i
show	c
were	c
differents	i
to	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
.	c

Besides	c
of	i
this	c
they	c
were	c
not	c
good	c
as	i
actors	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
am	c
quite	c
disappointed	c
.	c

The	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
most	c
of	c
the	c
employees	c
was	i
on	c
holidays	i
and	c
there	c
were	c
not	c
enough	c
people	c
to	c
attend	i
the	c
demand	c
.	c

We	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
same	c
school	c
and	c
we	c
had	c
the	c
same	c
hobbies	c
.	c

But	c
she	c
was	c
very	c
sad	c
because	c
she	c
knew	c
that	c
it	c
will	i
be	c
very	c
difficult	c
to	i
see	c
eachother	i
in	c
the	c
future	c
.	c

In	c
spite	c
of	c
this	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
happy	c
because	c
I	c
know	c
that	c
Alice	c
is	c
preparing	c
many	c
activities	c
to	i
do	c
together	c
and	i
to	i
spend	i
the	c
best	c
week	c
in	i
our	c
lifes	i
.	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writting	i
this	c
letter	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
treatment	c
that	c
we	c
have	i
received	i
when	c
we	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
Circle	c
theatre	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
"	c
whose	i
actors	c
were	c
Anthony	c
Keens	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
we	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
they	c
were	c
on	c
holidays	i
.	c

She	c
told	c
our	c
parents	c
that	c
we	c
were	c
going	c
to	c
get	c
married	c
in	c
Brazil	c
.	c

Sally	c
and	c
I	c
had	c
bought	c
a	c
nice	c
big	c
house	c
beside	c
the	c
sea	c
in	i
the	c
outskirts	c
of	c
the	c
city	c
.	c

When	c
my	c
parents	c
arrived	c
in	c
Brazil	c
and	c
found	c
us	c
,	c
our	c
dreams	c
were	c
erased	c
.	c

That	c
day	c
was	c
the	c
worst	c
day	c
of	c
all	i
my	c
life	i
.	c

I	c
went	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
evening	c
performance	c
of	c
your	c
production	c
of	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
on	c
saturday	i
the	c
2nd	c
of	c
June	c
.	c

Although	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
scheduled	c
to	c
start	c
at	c
19.30h	c
,	c
it	c
did	c
not	c
begin	c
until	c
20.15h	c
.	c

....	c

He	c
had	c
befriended	c
her	c
without	c
telling	c
her	c
that	c
he	c
was	c
married	c
.	c

The	c
accused	c
is	c
defended	c
by	c
a	c
famous	c
lawyer	c
who	c
tells	c
his	c
wife	c
that	c
a	c
loving	c
wife	c
's	c
confirmation	c
of	c
her	c
husband	c
's	c
alibi	c
will	c
not	c
convince	c
the	c
jury	c

She	c
then	c
gives	c
letters	c
to	c
her	c
husband	c
's	c
lawyer	c
that	c
seem	c
to	c
prove	c
that	c
she	c
has	c
been	c
unfaithful	c
to	c
him	c
and	c
that	c
she	c
tries	i
to	c
get	c
rid	c
of	c
him	c
with	c
the	c
help	c
of	c
false	c
accusations	c
.	c

I	c
thought	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
the	c
best	c
musical	c
show	c
that	c
London	c
had	c
.	c

But	c
it	i
happenned	i
the	i
opposite	i
.	c

Other	i
thing	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
complement	i
is	i
about	i
the	c
time	c
of	c
the	c
theatre	i
.	c

It	c
is	c
interesting	c
to	c
starts	i
to	c
think	c
about	c
this	c
point	c
.	c

We	c
need	c
this	c
technology	c
,	c
but	c
we	c
have	c
to	c
know	c
how	c
to	c
control	c
this	i
.	c

Especially	i
River	i
trip	c
to	c
Greenwich	c
makes	c
us	c
very	c
excited	c
and	c
we	c
are	c
really	c
looking	c
to	c
forwold	i

LONDON	i
Fashion	c
Show	c
and	c
Leisure	c
show	c
will	c
hold	i
at	c
Central	i

We	c
have	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
to	c
learn	c

Faithfully	i

The	c
Home	c
of	c
the	c
Future	c

As	c
developing	i
modern	c
society	c
,	c
we	c
will	c
become	c
to	c
have	c
more	c
material	c
than	c
now	c
.	c

It	c
said	i
that	c
as	i
one	c
of	c
the	c
reasons	c
small	i
separete	i
room	c
makes	c
kids	i
unsociable	c
and	c
dissapointed	i

Therefore	c
Japanese	c

consider	c
designing	i

use	i
many	i
glasses	i
as	i
much	i
as	i
they	i
can	i
in	i

Otherwise	i
as	i

our	c

will	c
be	c
more	c

Dear	c
Kim	c

I	c
am	c
going	c
to	c
answer	c
your	c
letter	c
just	c
now	c
.	c

Also	c
another	c
interesting	c
things	i
was	c
to	i
know	i
about	c
their	c
culture	c
,	c
because	c
all	c
of	c
them	c
come	c
from	c
Peru	c
,	c
Bolivia	c
,	c
Ecuador	c
,	c
Chile	c
and	i
Uruguay	c
.	c

Now	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
end	c
this	c
letter	c
,	c
so	c
please	c
call	c
me	c
if	c
you	c
want	c
to	c
see	c
me	c
next	c
week	c
.	c

Take	c
care	c
!	c

Love	c

I	c
think	c
you	c
ought	c
to	c
have	c
postponed	c
the	c
show	c
and	c
have	i
reimbursed	c
me	c
a	i
ticket	c
price	c

Please	c

at	c
your	c
earliest	c

I	c
look	c

Modern	c
technology	c
changed	i
my	c
daily	c
life	c
completely	c
.	c

So	c
with	c
Internet	i
I	c
can	c
make	c
friends	c
all	c
over	c
the	c
world	c
and	c
it	c
does	c
not	c
take	c
lots	c
of	c
time	c
.	c

Another	c
change	c
in	c
my	c
life	c
is	c
that	c
I	c
use	c
Internet	i
as	c
a	c
library	c
when	c
I	c
write	c
my	c
course	c
papers	c
.	c

So	c
that	c
I	c
can	c
get	c
books	c
which	c
is	i
impossible	c
to	c
get	c
in	c
libraries	i
of	c
my	c
town	c
.	c

Dear	c
Ms.	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
:	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
this	c
letter	c
because	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
express	c
my	c
happiness	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
on	i
July	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
work	c
and	i
my	c
parents	c
wish	c
to	c
see	c
me	c
in	i
this	c
month	c
,	c
so	c
if	c
it	c
is	c
possible	c
to	c
arrange	c
the	c
date	i
it	i
would	c
be	c
very	c
nice	c
.	c

Second	c
,	c
I	c
use	i
to	c
go	c
to	c
Camps	c
where	c
they	c
only	c
used	c
log	c
cabins	c
so	c
I	c
prefer	c
if	i
it	c
is	c
possible	c
to	i
be	c
in	c
tents	i
,	c
because	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
original	i
experience	c
.	i

Third	c
,	c
I	c
love	c
playing	c
basketball	c
,	i
I	c
am	c
a	c
great	c
player	c
and	c
I	c
play	c
with	i
my	c
University	c
and	c
I	c
like	c
to	c
be	c
playing	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
so	c
this	i
activity	i
I	i
will	i
not	i
missed	i
.	c

Jason	c
Andre	c
.	c

I	c
will	i
have	c
to	c
be	i
waiting	i
until	c
my	c
mother	c
decides	i
which	c
is	c
the	c
best	c
place	c
to	c
buy	c
her	c
dress	c
.	c

She	c
will	i
see	c
if	c
it	c
is	c
pretty	c
or	c
not	c
,	c
if	c
it	c
is	c
in	i
discount	i
at	c
other	i
store	c
we	i
will	i
not	c
buy	c
the	c
dress	c
and	c
we	c
will	i
have	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
other	c
store	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
other	c
dress	c
,	c
but	c
at	i
the	i
final	i
of	i
seeing	c
all	c
the	c
stores	c
and	c
looking	c
all	i
the	c
dresses	c
she	c
will	i
decided	i
for	i
the	c
first	c
we	i

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
planning	c
to	c
visit	c
my	c
Mum	c
in	c
Korea	c
in	c
August	c
.	c

I	c
also	c
prefer	c
staying	c
in	c
log	c
cabins	c
to	c
tents	c
.	c

Once	i
more	c
reason	c
is	c
that	c
I	c
do	c
not	c
want	c
to	c
miss	c
the	c
chance	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
,	c
which	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
dreaming	c
for	i
a	c
long	c
time	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

I	c
've	c
been	c
busy	c
preparing	c
English	i
exams	c

You	c
remember	c
I	c
helped	c
people	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
as	c
a	c
nurse	c
last	c
month	c
?	c

It	c
was	c
absolutely	c
our	c
prejudice	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Jones	c
:	c

I	c
'm	c
writting	i
you	i
because	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
what	c
a	c
bad	c
experience	c
I	c
had	c
during	c
my	c
holidays	c
when	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
play	c
on	c
your	i
theatre	c
.	c

To	c
begin	c
with	c
,	c
the	c
actor	c
you	c
publised	i
was	i
going	c
to	c
perform	c
,	c
did	c
n't	c
.	c

Waiting	c
for	c
your	i
to	c
write	c
back	c

Yours	c

From	i
a	c
simple	c
domestic	c

a	c
TV	c
or	c
a	c
radio	c
to	i
a	c
cell	c
phone	c
or	c
a	c
computer	c
,	c
my	c
life	c
is	c
much	c
better	c
now	c
than	c
it	c
was	c
before	c
.	c

Another	c
thing	c
I	c
depend	c
on	c
is	c
the	c
computer	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

I	c
'm	c
writting	i
this	c
letter	c
to	c
explain	c
you	i
what	c
had	i
happened	i
and	c
look	i
for	c
a	c
solution	c
.	c

Your	i
faithfully	c
,	c

And	c
she	c
had	c
planned	c
with	c
my	c
friends	c
went	i
there	i
without	c
me	c
.	c

The	i
I	c
realised	c
that	c
she	c
got	i
reason	c
,	i
I	c
was	c
irritated	i
becouse	i
my	c
parent	i
was	i
going	c
to	c
divorce	i
,	c
but	c
Pat	c
would	c
always	c
be	c
my	c
best	c
friend	c
so	c
I	c
told	c
her	c
that	c
I	c
was	c
n't	c
angry	c
with	c
her	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
not	c
going	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
concert	c
becouse	i
I	c
had	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
court	c
to	c
solve	c
my	c
parent	c
's	c
affair	c
.	c

And	c
that	c
's	c
the	c
history	i
of	c
how	c
I	c
lose	i
the	c
oportunity	i
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
only	c
concert	c
that	c
Oasis	c
had	i
done	i
in	c
my	c
city	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
we	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
suggest	c
you	i
something	c
:	c

Let	c
me	c
explain	c
you	i
what	c
it	c
is	c
:	c
It	c
must	i
be	i
an	c
exhibition	c
which	c
takes	c
place	c
in	c
the	c
"	c
Central	c
Exhibition	c
Hall	c
"	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
and	c
deals	c
with	c
the	c
latest	c
fashions	c
,	c
the	c
different	c
leisures	i
,	c
make	i
up	i
and	c
so	c
on	c
...	c

It	c
would	c
be	c
all	i
the	i
more	i
interesting	c
for	c
us	c
as	c
fashion	c
is	c
a	i
great	c
interest	c
for	c
people	c
from	i
our	c
age	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
you	c
would	c
n't	c
have	c
to	c
worry	c
about	c
the	c
price	c
as	c
it	c
is	c
free	c
for	c
the	i
students	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
agree	c
,	c
we	c
will	c
only	c
have	c
to	c
change	c
the	c
programme	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
afternoon	c
:	c
I	c
mean	c
that	c
instead	c
of	c
shopping	c
,	c
we	c
would	c
go	c
to	c
this	c
exhibition	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	i

The	c
respect	i
of	c
Famous	c
people	c
's	c
private	c
life	i
has	c
always	c
been	c
a	c
hot	c
topic	c
...	c

The	c
only	c
difference	c
between	c
them	c
and	c
us	c
is	c
the	c
kind	c
of	c
job	c
they	c
are	c
doing	c
which	i
is	c
literally	c
a	c
"	c
public	c
job	c
"	c
.	c

But	c
to	c
solve	c
this	c
problem	c
,	c
we	c
may	i
think	c
first	c
about	c
its	c
origin	c
...	c

"	c
Reading	c
the	c
gossips	i
"	c
:	c
is	c
n't	c
it	c
what	c
anyone	i
of	c
us	c
love	c
doing	c
?	c
?	c

Therefore	c
we	c
should	c
try	c
to	c
educate	c
ourselves	c
so	c
as	c
to	c
respect	c
altrui	i
in	i
his	i
privacy	i
.	c

It	c
's	c
just	c
a	c
matter	c
of	c
choice	c
:	c
being	c
aware	c
of	c
that	c
problem	c
,	c
everyone	c
is	c
free	c
to	c
become	c
famous	c
or	c
not	c
...	c
!	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

It	c
was	c
an	c
awful	c
experience	c
.	c

We	c
were	c
there	c
at	c
19:15	c
as	i
the	c
show	c
was	c
starting	c
at	c
19:30	c
for	i
getting	i
our	c
tickets	c
.	c

We	c
asked	c
for	c
the	c
discounts	c
you	c
were	i
refering	i
at	i
your	c
advertisement	c
but	c
the	i
counter	c
told	i
us	c
that	c
they	c
were	c
not	c
available	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
Sunday	c
.	c

We	c
got	c
really	c
bored	c
waiting	c
.	c

After	c
the	c
show	c
had	i
finished	i
we	c
went	c
for	c
dinner	c
at	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
the	c
owner	c
was	c
ill	c
.	c

From	c
the	c
time	c
she	c
was	c
a	c
child	c
she	c
could	c
n't	c
keep	c
anything	c
for	i
herself	c
,	c
she	c
always	c
shared	c
her	c
thoughts	c
with	c
other	c
people	c

She	c
was	c
about	c
sixteen	c
years	c
old	c
when	c
she	c
moved	c
to	c
another	c
city	c
with	c
her	c
family	c
.	c

Pat	c
was	c
wondering	c
why	c
and	c
one	c
day	c
she	c
found	c
out	c
.	c

In	c
a	c
few	c
days	c
all	c
school	i
was	i
familiar	i
with	i
Kim	c
's	c
story	c
.	c

She	c
stand	i
up	c
infront	i
of	c
the	c
whole	c
classroom	i
and	c
explained	c
that	c
Kim	c
's	c
father	i
actions	c
did	c
n't	c
influence	i
Kim	c
.	c

I	c
saw	c
the	c
show	c
at	c
your	c
theatre	c
with	c
my	c
friend	c
on	c
6th	c
June	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
the	c
starting	c
time	c
has	c
been	c
changed	c
from	c
19:30	c
to	c
20:15	c
.	c

Unless	c
I	c
hear	c
from	c
you	c
within	c
ten	c
days	c
,	c
I	c
shall	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
legal	c
advice	c
on	c
the	i
matter	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
in	c
the	c
near	c
future	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
very	c
difficult	c
to	c
cook	c
and	c
wash	c
dishes	c
after	c
working	c
.	c

He	c
complained	c
about	c
a	i
lot	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
for	i
explaining	i
some	c
problems	c
I	c
had	c
when	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
to	c
see	c
one	c
of	c
your	c
company	c
's	c
musical	c
shows	c
called	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
"	c
.	c

I	c
got	i
very	c
disappointed	c
when	c
I	c
discovered	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
was	c
not	c
going	c
to	c
play	c
and	i
a	c
different	c
actor	c
would	c
play	c
instead	i
of	c
him	c
.	c

Another	c
problem	c
was	c
the	i
start	c
of	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
the	c
advertisement	c
said	c
we	c
could	c
buy	c
tickets	c
with	i
discounts	i
,	c
but	c
when	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
buy	c
it	i
your	c
employees	c
told	c
me	c
there	c
were	c
no	c
discounts	c
available	c
.	c

When	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
over	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
have	c
dinner	c
to	i
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
but	c
I	c
found	c
it	c
closed	c
because	c
your	c
company	c
is	c
lacked	i
of	i
employees	c
.	c

I	c
advise	c
you	c
to	c
pay	c
more	c
attention	c
in	i
your	c
shows	c
and	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c
.	c

I	c
wish	c
I	c
had	c
never	c
told	c
her	c
anything	c
.	c

Suddenly	c
,	c
I	c
heard	c
step	i
noises	i
that	c
were	c
getting	c
closer	c
to	c
me	c
.	c

After	c
a	c
few	c
words	c
which	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
pay	c
attention	c
to	c
,	c
my	c
teacher	c
went	i
out	i
the	c
class	i
.	c

He	c
was	c
going	c
down	c
the	c
stairs	c
wearing	c
his	c
blue	c
jacket	c
.	c

Then	c
,	c
while	c
I	c
was	c
going	c
back	c
to	c
my	c
class	i
I	c
saw	c
he	c
had	c
n't	c
switched	c
off	c
the	c
light	c
of	i
his	c
room	c
.	c

The	c
exams	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
next	i
day	c
were	c
there	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
told	c
her	c
this	i
piece	i
of	i
news	c
,	c
she	c
got	i
surprised	c
.	c

We	c
thought	c
we	c
should	c
n't	c
tell	c
it	i
anybody	c
else	c
.	c

Dear	c
Ms	c
Ryan	c

First	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
able	i
to	i
come	i
only	i
in	c
July	c
,	c
because	c
my	c
examination	c
session	c
is	c
due	c
from	c
the	c
24	c
June	c
till	c
26	c
June	c
.	c

From	c
the	c
listed	c
activities	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
choose	c
singing	c
,	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
my	c
hobby	c
and	c
I	c
also	c
sing	c
in	c
local	i
chorus	i
.	c

I	c
won	c
third	c
prize	c
in	c
competition	i
organized	c
by	c
our	c
college	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

The	c
third	c
reason	c
I	c
enjoy	c
shopping	c
is	c
that	c
I	c
never	c
go	c
alone	c
just	c
to	c
buy	c
a	c
thing	c
I	c
need	c
.	c

I	c
recently	c
had	c
a	c
week	c
's	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
and	c
during	c
my	c
stay	c
I	c
came	i
to	c
your	c
threatre	i
to	c
see	c
the	i
"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
.	c

My	c
evening	c
was	c
very	c
disappointing	c
.	c

A	c
different	c
actor	c
was	c
playing	i
durring	i
the	c
musical	c
and	c
he	c
was	c
very	c
disappointing	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
not	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

"	c
Somebody	c
had	i
hurt	i
her	c
and	c
had	i
let	i
her	c
without	c
help	c
"	c
Mourk	i
said	c
angrily	c
.	c

Suddenly	c
Pat	c
cried	c
:	c
"	c
Oh	c
my	c
Lord	c
,	c
Bad	c
Jon	c
had	i
done	i
this	c
.	c

"	c
He	c
is	c
so	c
bad	c
.	c

Hey	c
Listen	i
guys	c
we	i
will	c
take	c
his	c
dog	c
which	c
love	i
very	c
much	c
and	c
we	c
will	c
sell	c
it	c
to	c
Sally	c
who	c
wants	c
one	c
.	c

and	c
told	i
him	i
"	i
Hey	c
,	c
you	c
.	c

Bad	c
Jon	c
understood	c
and	c
talked	c
immediately	c
to	c
his	c
father	c
.	i

We	c
have	c
seen	c
an	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
.	i

You	c
see	c
,	c
the	c
programme	c
has	i
only	i
to	c
be	c
changed	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
morning	c
.	c

your	c
English	c
Class	c
4A	c

But	c
in	c
which	i
kind	c
of	c
homes	c
will	c
people	c
stay	i
in	c
the	c
future	c
?	c

What	c
will	c
be	c
different	c
and	c
what	c
wont	i
change	c
?	c

We	c
can	i
need	c
our	c
imagination	c
for	i
answering	i
these	c
questions	c
but	c
we	c
will	c
never	c
know	c
the	c
right	c
answer	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
people	c
will	c
altough	i
need	c
a	c
bed	c
and	c
a	c
table	c
with	c
a	c
chair	c
.	c

After	c
evrything	i
what	i
happend	i
we	c
went	c
to	c
hotel	i
tipped	i
and	i
very	i
affect	i

Evrything	i
what	i
we	c
do	c
now	c
we	c
do	c
with	c
:	i

then	i
human	i
.	c

First	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
great	c
expectation	c
to	c
see	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
plays	i
his	c
role	c
,	c
but	c
he	c
had	c
never	c
shown	c
up	c
that	c
night	c
.	c

Since	c
I	c
moved	c
to	c
London	c
to	c
study	c
English	c
I	c
have	c
had	c
a	c
hard	c
time	c
to	i
make	i
intimate	c
friendship	i
with	c
people	c
around	c
me	c
.	c

She	c
was	c
a	i
such	i
wonderful	c
person	c
in	c
our	c
class	c
.	c

We	c
had	c
many	c
common	c
interests	c
in	c
music	c
,	c
art	c
and	c
books	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
told	c
her	c
everything	c
about	c
my	c
life	c
.	c

There	c
were	c
some	c
stories	c
I	c
never	c
told	c
anyone	c
before	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
had	i
share	i
with	c
her	c
all	c
my	c
secrets	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
glad	c
for	i
receiving	i
such	c
a	c
wonderful	c
surprise	c
,	i
that	i
I	c
have	c
won	c
first	c
prize	c
.	c

The	c
ones	c
I	c
consider	c
I	c
'm	c
good	c
at	c
are	c
painting	c
and	c
photography	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
something	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
.	c

How	c
warm	c
is	c
California	c
in	c
those	i
days	i
?	c

And	c
,	c
yes	c
!	c

I	c
never	c
imagined	c
how	c
many	c
people	c
is	i
involved	c
in	c
the	c
organization	c
!	i

You	c
have	c
to	c
tell	c
me	c
everything	c
!	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
the	c
letter	c
which	c
I	c
have	c
received	c
with	c
a	i
great	c
delight	c
and	c
excitement	c
.	c

And	c
if	c
it	c
is	c
possible	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
rather	c
than	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
because	c
I	c
find	c
tents	c
uncomfortable	c
to	c
sleep	c
in	c
.	c

We	c
were	c
all	c
given	c
different	c
sort	i
of	c
jobs	c
to	c
do	c
.	c

Some	c
of	c
us	c
had	c
to	c
paint	c
and	c
some	c
of	c
us	c
had	c
to	c
cut	c
some	c
materials	c
and	c
fabrics	c
out	c
into	c
special	c
shapes	c
.	c

However	c
the	c
best	c
part	c
was	c
watching	c
and	c
listening	c
to	c
the	c
singers	c
and	c
bands	c
practicing	i
on	c
the	c
stage	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
the	c
best	c
day	c
of	c
my	c
life	c
and	c
certainly	c
for	c
others	c
,	c
too	c
.	c

Love	c
from	c

Also	c
,	c
the	c
advertisement	c
said	c
that	c
discounts	c
for	i
the	c
tickets	c
would	c
be	c
available	c
,	c
but	c
it	i
was	i
not	c
.	c

Peter	c
had	c
a	c
terribly	i
problem	c
with	c
drugs	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
he	c
began	c
to	c
run	c
around	c
the	c
crowd	c
and	c
also	c
to	c
hit	c
the	c
advertisements	c
which	c
announced	c
the	c
concert	c
.	c

The	c
security	c
guard	c
heard	c
her	c
and	c
agreeded	i
with	c
Pat	c
that	c
if	c
Peter	c
continued	c
acting	c
on	i
this	c
way	c
he	c
would	c
obliged	i
us	c
to	c
go	i
out	i
of	i
the	c
concert	c
.	c

I	c
will	c
give	c
you	c
all	c
information	i
you	c
need	c
and	c
ask	c
some	c
questions	c
.	c

The	i
accommodation	c
I	i
would	c
like	c
to	c
live	i
in	c
tents	c
.	c

Because	c
I	c
never	i
live	i
in	c
tents	i
before	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
play	c
basketball	c
and	c
golf	c
when	c
I	c
am	c
at	c
the	c
Camp	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
am	c
not	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
golf	c
.	c

And	c
how	c
could	i
we	c
meet	c
at	c
the	c
airport	c
?	c

Nowdays	i
internet	i
makes	i
us	c
closer	c
and	c
closer	c

What	c
do	c
you	c
do	c
after	c
class	c
?	c

You	c
ca	c
n't	c
forget	c
football	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
think	c
these	c
five	c
lesson	i
or	c
activities	c
are	c
most	i
common	c
in	c
our	c
daily	c
life	c
at	c
college	c
.	c

For	i
what	i
concernes	i
the	c
activities	c
I	i
think	c
that	c
swimming	c
and	c
climbing	c
are	c
the	c
most	c
suitable	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
been	c
swimming	c
since	c
I	c
was	c
three	c
and	c
I	c
did	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
courses	c
.	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

When	c
we	c
arrived	c
she	c
persuaded	c
me	c
to	c
go	c
the	i
backstage	c
because	c
her	c
boyfriend	c
was	c
the	c
electrician	i
of	i
the	i
band	i
.	c

It	c
did	c
n't	c
sound	c
very	c
exciting	c
to	c
me	c
but	c
I	c
accepted	c
above	i
all	i
because	c
I	c
was	c
curious	c
.	c

After	c
that	c
I	c
tried	c
to	c
tell	c
them	c
I	c
had	c
just	c
begun	c
but	i
within	c
five	c
minutes	c
I	c
was	c
on	c
the	c
stage	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
playing	c
that	c
,	c
luckily	c
,	c
easy	c
tune	c
.	c

I	i
think	i
you	i
ca	i
n't	i
believe	i
in	i
what	c
I	c
've	c
told	c
you	c
but	c
I	c
wo	c
n't	c
forget	c
this	c
experience	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
asked	c
me	c
to	c
send	c
you	c
further	c
information	c
about	c
three	c
points	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
sending	c
you	c
my	c
preferences	c
as	c
follows	c
:	c

1.	c
-	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
long	i
cabins	i
rather	c
than	c
tents	i
,	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
much	c
more	c
comfortable	c
.	c

Anyway	c
,	c
I	c
also	c
laughed	c
a	c
lot	c
,	c
the	c
music	c
was	c
fantastic	c
,	c
and	c
the	c
stars	c
were	c
really	c
nice	c
to	c
every	i
one	i
.	c

I	c
will	c
send	c
you	c
a	c
copy	c
of	c
the	c
best	c
pictures	c
the	c
next	c
time	c

Bety	c

17th	c
June	c
2000	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
'	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
'	i
I	i
've	i
visited	i
it	c
last	i
evening	c
in	c
your	c
'	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
'	c
.	c

I	c
believed	c
in	c
the	c
phrase	c
by	i
which	c
the	c
advertisement	c
ended	c
:	c
'	c
Your	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
!	c
'	c

The	c
show	c
should	c
started	i
at	c
half	c
past	c
7	c
pm	c
but	c
nothing	c
happened	c
.	c

At	c
quarter	c
past	c
8	c
pm	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
looking	c
for	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
.	c

Now	c
I	c
asked	c
myself	c
if	c
there	c
will	i
come	i
another	c
problem	c
.	c

The	c
problem	c
came	c
.	c

And	c
by	c
the	c
way	c
do	i
you	c
believe	c
that	c
they	c
also	c
thought	c
the	c
fashion	c
never	c
changed	c
?	c

But	c
the	i
fashion	c
changed	i
.	c

A	c
lot	c
of	c
thinks	i
will	c
be	c
easier	c
to	c
do	c
.	c

But	c
this	c
problem	c
is	c
solving	c
by	i
itselfes	i
.	c

The	c
season	i
for	c
this	c
is	c
the	i
global	c
warming	c
,	c
which	c
is	c
the	c
salvation	i
of	i
the	c
problem	c
and	c
another	c
reason	c
why	c
this	c
idea	c
is	c
possible	c
.	c

The	c
clothes	c
you	c
'll	c
wear	c
will	c
be	c
very	c
extraordinary	c
because	c
of	c
their	c
special	c
kind	i
of	c
producing	i
.	c

So	c
do	c
n't	c
laugh	c
about	i
this	c
idea	c
.	c

Well	c
I	c
tried	c
to	c
do	c
so	c
but	c
the	c
lady	c
at	c
the	c
desk	c
told	c
me	c
that	c
they	i
were	i
quotas	i
available	i
at	c
that	c
price	c
but	c
were	c
already	c
sold	c
out	c
!	c

"	c
Technology	c
"	c
is	c
an	c
appealing	c
as	c
well	c
as	c
an	c
interesting	c
word	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

From	c
ancient	c
times	c
up	c
to	c
now	c
this	i
science	c
has	c
allowed	c
the	c
world	c
and	c
human-beings	i
to	c
develop	c
positively	c
and	c
negatively	c
.	c

Back	c
in	c
the	c
30's	i
the	c
different	c
governments	c
invented	c

We	c
felt	c

I	c
am	c
sorry	c
to	c

that	c
I	c
do	i
not	c

the	c

your	c

When	c
we	c
look	c
around	c
in	i

it	c

Every	i

in	i
the	c
best	c
way	c
to	c
carry	i
off	i
your	c

,	c
in	c
fact	c
a	c
big	c

of	i
many	c
problem	i
or	c
estrés	i
,	c
boring	c
,	c
or	c
only	c
for	c

For	c
many	c
people	c
,	c
shopping	c
had	i
always	c
been	c
only	c
for	c
one	c
kind	c
of	c
elite	c
,	c
or	c
social	c
class	c
;	c
not	c
all	c

buy	c
hundreds	c

thousands	c
of	c

in	c
those	c

There	c
are	c

About	c
accommodation	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
a	i
long	i
cabin	c
because	c
last	c
year	c
I	c
had	c
an	c
accident	c
and	c
my	c
back	c
is	i
enjure	i
,	c
so	c
sleeping	c
in	c
a	c

it	i
would	c
be	c
painful	c
for	c
me	c

Althoung	i

bored	i
,	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
good	c
help	i
for	i

my	c
back	c

It	c
was	c
brilliant	c
!	c

It	c
was	c
n't	c
a	c
nice	c
job	c
but	c
I	c
had	c
all	c
night	c
for	c
drinking	c
and	c
dancing	c
of	c
course	c
,	i
I	c
had	i
not	i
to	c
pay	c
for	i
getting	i

She	c
will	c
come	c
to	c
Liverpool	c
next	c
week	c
and	c
I	c
'll	c
put	c
her	c
up	c

Probably	c
she	c
'll	c
come	c
with	c
a	c
friend	c
if	i
you	c
want	c
you	c
can	c
enjoy	i
us	c

Helping	c
at	c
the	c
pop	c
concert	c
has	c
been	c
a	c
great	c
experience	c
because	c
I	c
've	c
done	i
a	i
new	c
friends	c
and	c
I	c
know	c
that	c
in	i
the	c
concert	c
there	c
is	i
n't	i
any	c
drunk	i
just	c
funny	i

wonderful	c
people	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
:	c

I	c
also	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
why	c
the	c
musical	i
show	c
started	c
at	c
a	c
quarter	c
past	c
eight	c
instead	c
of	c
half	c
past	c
seven	c
.	c

I	c
spent	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
time	c
waiting	c
for	c
the	c
show	c
to	c
start	c
.	c

Of	c
course	c
discounts	c
were	c
not	c
available	c
either	c
,	c
and	c
the	c
restaurant	c
where	c
we	c
were	c
supposed	c
to	c
eat	c
afterwards	c
was	c
closed	c
without	c
any	c
explanation	c
at	c
all	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
what	c
should	c
have	c
been	c
a	c
nice	c
evening	c
out	c
came	i
to	i
a	c
nightmare	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
:	c

Modern	c
technology	c
has	c
actually	c
changed	c
my	c
life	c
quite	c
a	c
lot	c
.	c

Even	c
though	c
it	c
was	c
my	c
first	c
one	c
I	c
managed	c
and	c
I	c
got	c
to	c
know	c
pretty	i
fast	i
the	i
way	i
they	i
work	i
.	c

Now	c
,	c
I	c
'm	c
just	c
fascinated	c
by	c
Internet	i
and	c
I	c
spent	i
at	c
least	c
half	c
an	c
hour	c
every	c
day	c
surfing	c
the	c
net	c
,	c
visiting	c
lots	c
of	c
webs	i
and	c
getting	c
all	c
kind	i
of	c
information	c
for	c
free	c

I	c
'm	c
impressed	c
by	c
communications	c

well	c

First	i
at	i
all	i

I	c
'd	c
like	c

for	i
the	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

We	c
had	c
a	c
class	c
discussion	c
about	c
shopping	c
,	c
for	i
it	c
I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
tell	i
about	c
my	c
opinion	c
.	c

I	c
love	c
shopping	c
mainly	c
when	c
I	c
am	c
alone	c
on	i
when	c
I	c
am	c
angry	c
because	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
can	c
help	c
me	c
to	c
relax	c
.	c

ALBiTO	c

It	c
will	c
be	c
convenient	c
for	c
me	c
then	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
two	c
months	i
holiday	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
do	c
Tennis	c
and	c
Photography	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
in	c
the	c
team	i
for	i
tennis	i
at	c
school	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
played	c
against	c
different	i
other	c
schools	c
before	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
about	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
bring	c
and	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
have	c
bring	i
.	c

The	c
clothes	c
are	c
quite	c
expensive	c
and	c
they	c
are	c
never	c
your	c
size	c
.	c

These	c
things	c
can	c
be	c
very	c
annoying	c
but	c
there	c
is	c
a	c
good	c
side	c
of	i
'	c
shopping	c
'	c
.	c

By	c
the	c
time	c
you	c
have	c
completed	c
the	c
whole	c
High	c
Street	c
,	c
you	c
will	c
be	c
out	c
of	c
breath	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
agree	c
that	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
because	c
of	c
crowded	c
shops	c
and	c
the	c
price	c
of	c
clothes	c
but	c
I	c
am	c
sure	c
that	c
the	c
majority	c
of	c
people	c
do	c
like	c
shopping	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
sure	c
that	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
,	i
there	c
will	c
be	c
no	c
more	c
crowded	c
streets	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
'	c
internet	i
'	i
which	i
you	c
can	c
order	c
onlines	i
.	c

Maybe	c
we	c
will	c
have	c
robots	c
to	c
do	c
the	c
shopping	c
for	c
us	c
in	c
the	c
future	c

I	c
am	c

I	c
am	i

I	c
have	i

a	c

I	c
did	c

Danny	c

this	c

you	c

:	c

In	c
the	c
camp	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
log	i
cabins	i

I	c
hate	c
to	c
sleep	c
uncomfortable	i
and	c

I	c
will	c

Acording	i
to	i
your	c
letter	c
,	c
you	c
asked	c
me	c
to	c
choose	c
two	c
of	c
your	c
activities	c

I	c
prefere	i
to	c
do	c
some	c

because	c
that	c
's	c
what	c
I	c
do	c
in	c
my	c
spare	c
time	c
and	c
I	c
do	c
it	c
quite	c
well	c

Apart	c
from	c
that	c
,	c
if	c
you	c
give	c
surfing	c
classes	c
I	c
would	c
love	c
to	c

is	c
one	c
of	c
my	c
chilhood	c
drems	i
that	c
I	i
never	c
came	c
true	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
what	c
tipe	i
of	c

do	i
I	c
have	c
to	c

and	i
the	c
amount	c
of	c

that	c
I	c
'm	c
going	c

so	c
if	c
you	c
please	i
could	i
help	c
me	c
giving	i
me	c
this	c
information	c
I	c
would	c
be	c
very	c
pleased	c

We	c
all	i
have	i
been	c
shooping	i
once	c
in	c
our	c
lifes	i
and	c
sometimes	c
it	c
probably	c
has	c
not	c
been	c
very	c
enjoyable	c
,	c
why	c
?	c
we	i
had	c
a	c
class	c
discussion	c
and	c
we	c
all	c
agree	c
in	i
some	c
points	c
.	c

So	c
if	c
you	c
want	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
good	c
relaxing	i
shooping	i
day	i
,	c
we	c
recommend	c
you	c
not	i
to	i
go	i
with	c
your	c
little	c
brothers	c
and	c
to	c
go	c
with	c
enogh	i
time	c
to	c
look	c
arround	i
for	c
what	c
you	c
really	c
want	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
case	c
for	c
example	c
my	c
car	c
is	c
very	c
time-saving	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
disappointed	c
because	c
the	c
actors	c
was	i
n't	i
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
.	c

You	c
wrote	i
also	i
that	c
the	c
evening	c
would	c
be	c
perfect	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
ca	c
n't	c
give	c
me	c
all	c
the	c
money	c
back	c
then	c
do	c
it	c
particularly	i
.	c

I	c
use	i
also	i
the	c
internet	i
when	c
I	c
need	c
any	c
informations	i
for	i
example	c
I	i
need	c
them	i
for	c
school	c
or	c
private	i
for	i
myself	c
.	c

A	c
few	c
years	c
ago	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
go	c
in	i
a	c
library	c
and	c
look	c
it	i
up	c
in	c
many	c
books	c
.	c

This	c
event	i
was	c
not	c
the	c
only	c
one	c
because	c
another	c
problem	c
was	c
the	i
respect	i
of	i
the	c
time	c
.	c

The	c
fourth	c
problem	c
was	c
that	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
be	c
open	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
but	c
once	c
again	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
lie	c
because	c
the	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
for	c
renovation	c
.	c

After	c
all	c
these	c
explanations	i
,	c
I	c
am	c
sure	c
that	c
you	c
will	c
understand	c
that	i
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
have	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
and	c
that	c
I	c
was	c
disappointed	c
last	c
night	c
.	c

Leia	c
Beroni	c

So	c
I	c
spend	c
almost	c
one	c
hour	c
every	c
day	c
on	c
the	c
web	c
.	c

At	i
last	i
technology	i
that	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
bring	i
out	i
is	c
the	c
TV	c
.	c

This	c
is	c
a	c
good	c
one	c
because	c
you	c
can	c
see	c
what	c
is	c
happening	c
around	c
you	c
and	c
everywhere	c
else	c
on	c
Earth	c
.	c

Naturally	c
technology	c
is	c
everywhere	c
even	c
in	c
the	c
kitchen	c
,	c
for	c
example	c
a	c
special	c
plate	c
or	c
else	i
,	c
and	c
I	c
could	c
talk	c
a	c
lot	c
about	c
them	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
the	c
one	c
here	i
are	i
the	c
most	c
important	c
in	c
the	i
change	i
of	i
my	c
daily	c
life	c
.	i

I	c
am	c
very	c
happy	c
to	c
win	c
this	c
prize	c
but	c
also	c
I	c
have	c
some	c
questions	c
about	c
this	i
Camp	i
.	c

From	c
the	c
activities	c
I	i
choose	c
Basketball	i
and	i
Golf	i
.	c

In	i
Basketball	i
I	i
am	i
very	i
good	i
,	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
played	c
in	c
a	c
Basketball-Team	i
for	c
ten	c
years	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
if	c
it	c
is	c
necessary	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
take	c
some	c
clothes	c
with	c
me	c
for	c
the	c
sport	i
activities	c
?	c

Also	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
should	c
take	c
with	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
enjoy	c
shopping	c
when	c
I	c
can	c
buy	c
some	c
clothes	c

Dear	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
so	c
marvellous	i
about	c
winning	c
the	c
competition	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
answering	i
what	i
you	i
would	i
like	i
to	i
know	i
some	i
information	i
from	i
me	i
.	c

Secondly	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
tent	i
as	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
natural	c
life	c
while	c
I	c
am	c
at	c
the	c
Camp	c
.	c

Thirdly	c
I	c
keen	i
on	c
playing	c
tennis	c
and	c
taking	c
some	c
photography	i
.	c

During	c
that	c
time	c
I	c
can	c
talk	c
some	i
secret	c
things	i
or	i
private	i
with	c
class-mates	i
.	c

In	c
addition	c
speaking	c
activity	c
include	i
everything	c
to	i
learn	i
English	c
such	c
as	c
listening	c
,	c
speaking	c
,	c
grammer	i
as	c
well	c
.	c

However	c
all	i
students	i
are	c
passive	c
.	c

So	c
it	c
can	c
be	c
boring	c
.	c

give	i
a	c
topic	c
and	c
then	c
discussion	i
about	i
it	c
.	c

I	c
know	c
that	i
what	c
my	c
friends	c
think	c
and	c
like	c
.	c

Also	c
the	c
film	c
must	c
be	c
funny	c
.	c

During	c
speaking	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
lots	c
of	c
happening	i
such	c
as	c
,	c
some	c
students	c
ca	c
n't	c
understand	c
what	c
the	c
other	c
students	c
say	c
and	c
their	c
culture	c
.	c

Having	c
fun	c
and	c
knowing	i
new	c
knowledge	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
speaking	c
activity	c
should	c
be	c
filmed	c
as	c
you	c
can	c
see	c
and	c
know	c
real	i
us	c
and	c
funny	i
as	c
well	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
happy	c
to	c
win	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
.	i

This	c
is	c
the	c
only	c
month	c
that	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
free	c
.	c

Because	c
I	c
am	c
studying	c
the	i
Management	c
and	c
Finance	c
at	c
university	c
and	c
it	c
will	c
finish	c
at	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
June	c
.	c

I	c
will	c
be	c
in	c
italy	i
in	c
August	c
.	c

Because	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
improve	c
my	c
italian	i
and	i
I	c
am	c
taking	c
a	c
very	c
important	c
exam	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
be	i
appreciate	c
it	c
if	c
I	c
could	c
stay	c
in	c
tents	i
at	c
Camp	i
.	c

Because	c
I	c
usually	c
go	c
on	c
camping-site	i
holiday	i
,	i
with	c
my	c
friends	c
.	c

Why	c
do	c
people	c
like	c
shopping	c
?	c

I	c
think	c
the	c
weekends	c
are	c
not	c
the	c
right	c
time	c
to	c
go	c
shopping	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
not	c
really	c
good	i
idea	c
to	c
go	c
shopping	c
if	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
enough	c
time	c
.	c

I	c
can	c
remember	c
how	c
upset	c
I	c
was	c
if	c
my	c
mother	c
did	c
n't	c
buy	c
what	c
I	c
wanted	c
and	c
how	c
much	c
I	c
cried	c
.	c

Because	c
she	c
never	c
managed	c
to	c
get	c
me	c
out	c
from	i
the	c
toy	c
shop	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
see	c
shopping	i
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
the	c
information	c
you	c
wanted	i
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
you	c
asked	c
me	c
about	i
the	i
period	i
I	c
'd	c
prefer	c
to	c
travel	c
:	i
For	c
me	c
,	c
the	c
only	c
solution	i
is	c
July	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
've	c
already	c
something	c
planned	c
in	c
August	c
.	c

Concerning	c
the	c
accommodation	c
,	c
I	c
'd	c
prefer	c
to	c
spend	c
my	c
nights	c
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
've	c
great	c
difficulty	c
sleeping	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
.	c

You	c
also	c
mentionned	i
the	c
activities	c
I	c
'll	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
do	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
to	c
this	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
be	c
grateful	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
send	c
me	c
information	i
on	c
these	c
few	c
details	i
:	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
is	i
required	c
?	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
's	c
worth	c
reading	c
this	c
book	c
twice	c
,	c
both	c
for	c
a	c
better	c
understanding	c
of	c
our	c
world	c
,	c
and	c
for	c
the	c
symbolical	c
meaning	c
of	c
the	c
story	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
I	i
would	c
like	c
to	c
say	c
something	c
about	c
the	c
starring	i
:	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
because	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
see	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
but	c
once	c
there	c
I	c
found	c
an	c
actor	c
who	c
I	c
had	c
never	c
heard	c
about	i
.	c

So	c
the	c
main	c
point	i
of	c
my	c
visit	c
had	c
dissappeared	i
.	c

In	c
your	c
advertisement	c
you	c
informed	c
us	c
about	i
their	c
false	c
existence	c
.	c

But	c
there	c
is	c
still	c
another	c
point	c
:	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
where	c
I	c
had	c
decided	c
having	i
supper	c
was	c
closed	c
,	c
without	c
saying	i
the	c
reason	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
,	c
and	c
because	c
of	c
this	c
Pat	c
caused	c
a	c
big	c
,	c
but	c
stupid	c
problem	i
.	c

Nick	c
was	c
Marie	c
's	c
boyfriend	c
,	c
and	c
Marie	c
a	i
very	c
good	c
friend	c
of	c
hers	c
.	c

They	c
were	c
in	c
the	c
shopping	c
centre	c
,	c
and	c
the	c
problem	c
was	c
that	c
Nick	c
was	c
n't	c
alone	c
,	c
he	c
was	c
with	c
a	c
very	c
beautiful	c
girl	c
.	c

She	c
works	c
as	c
a	c
model	c
,	c
and	c
she	c
was	c
advicing	i
him	c
about	c
which	i
clothes	c
,	c
etc	c
,	c
...	c
buy	i
for	c
her	c
.	c

I	c
decided	c
to	c
enjoy	i
a	c
play	c
at	c
the	c
theatre	c
wich	i
you	c
're	c
the	c
manager	c
to	c
see	c
the	i
"	c
London	c
's	c
newest	c
and	c
best	c
musical	c
show.	c
"	c

My	c
opinion	c
?	c

I	c
had	c
a	c
very	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
a	c
good	c
question	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
never	i
had	i
asked	i
it	i
to	i
myself	i
.	c

But	c
,	c
is	i
not	c
only	c
news	c
or	c
information	c
.	c

But	c
,	c
if	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
like	c
to	i
use	i
the	c
keyboard	c
to	c
tell	i
something	c
or	c
comunicate	i
,	c
you	c
can	c
use	c
video	c
conference	i
,	c
a	c
sistem	i
wich	i
you	i
can	i
talk	c
with	c
other	c
people	c
simply	c
with	c
a	c
microphone	c
and	c
speakers	c
.	c

Also	c
is	i
the	c
possibility	i
of	i
download	i
things	c
to	c
your	c
pc	i
like	c
software	c
,	c
pictures	c
and	c
also	i
,	c
music	c
.	c

The	c
modern	c
technologies	c
make	i
me	i
able	i
to	c
listen	c
the	c
music	c
I	c
've	c
downloaded	c
with	c
the	c
same	c
quality	c
as	c
a	c
CD	c
,	c
and	c
if	c
I	c
buy	c
a	c
reproductor	i
,	c
I	c
can	c
wear	i
this	c
music	c
to	i
everywere	i
.	c

Without	c
this	c
evolution	c
,	c
we	c
probably	i
still	c
get	i
on	i
the	i
ancient	c
times	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
afraid	c
that	c
the	c
people	c
on	i
the	i
ancient	c
times	c
lived	c
although	c
they	c
do	i
n't	i
have	c
anything	i
of	c
these	c
things	c
,	c
but	c
me	c
and	c
everyone	c
of	i
this	i
times	c
,	c
I	c
'm	c
afraid	c
that	c
we	c
would	c
n't	c
like	c
return	i
to	c
this	c
life	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
reply	c
to	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
very	c
glad	c
to	c
hear	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
.	c

As	c
far	c
as	c
accomodation	i
is	c
concerned	c
I	i
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
because	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
more	c
comfortable	c
,	c
and	c
,	c
therefore	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
stayed	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
.	c

I	c
play	c
basketball	c
very	c
well	c
,	c
although	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
taken	c
part	c
in	c
important	c
competitions	c
;	c
however	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
not	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
tennis	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
improve	c
it	i

Yours	c
sincerely	c

This	c
report	c
shows	c
which	c
lessons	c
and	c
activities	c
are	c
better	i
to	c
be	i
filmed	i
in	c
order	c
to	c
make	c
a	c
short	c
video	c
about	c
daily	c
life	c
at	c
our	c
school	c
.	c

In	c
fact	c
they	c
find	c
it	c
difficult	c
to	c
take	c
them	c
in	c
and	c
,	c
in	c
their	c
opinion	c
,	c
these	c
lessons	c
are	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
so	c
as	c
to	c
show	c
their	c
daily	c
life	c
at	c
school	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
,	c
which	c
I	c
have	c
seen	c
in	c
The	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
on	c
6th	c
June	c
.	c

But	c
things	c
started	c
to	c
go	c
wrong	c
from	c
the	c
beginning	c
.	c

The	c
first	c
problem	c
was	c
the	c
price	c
of	c
tickets	c
.	c

I	c
expected	c
to	c
buy	c
ticket	i
cheaply	c
but	c
no	c
discounts	c
were	c
available	c
.	c

Although	c
I	c
got	c
a	c
bit	c
annoyed	c
,	c
I	c
tried	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
good	c
time	c
.	c

The	c
actor	c
'	c
Danny	c
brook	c
'	c
,	c
whom	c
you	c
advertised	c
in	c
the	c
brocher	i
,	c
did	c
not	c
play	c
a	c
part	c
in	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
restaurant	c
to	c
have	c
something	c
for	c
dinner	c
after	c
show	i
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
refurbishing	i
interior	i
.	c

I	c
expect	c
to	c
receive	c
a	c
cheque	c
for	c
£	c
20.	c
look	i
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
soon	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

Have	c
you	c
ever	c
been	c
to	c
fashion	i
show	c
named	c
"	c
New	c
trend	c
,	c
New	c
Millenium	i
"	c
?	c

We	c
never	c
know	c
whether	c
we	c
might	c
look	c
like	c
robots	c
because	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
the	c
electronic	c
age	c
.	c

Let	c
's	c
face	c
it	c
.	c

Sir	c
,	c

In	c
fact	c
,	c
unlike	c
the	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
that	c
you	c
promised	c
on	i
your	c
advertisement	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
very	c
disapointing	i
evening	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
expected	c
to	c
see	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
in	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
but	c
he	c
was	c
replaced	c
by	c
another	c
actor	c
.	c

Moreover	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
wait	c
forty	i
five	i
minutes	c
to	i
see	i
the	c
beginning	c
of	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
eat	c
this	i
evening	c
.	c

In	i
the	i
beginning	i
,	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
bring	c
him	c
in	i
my	c
house	c
where	c
everybody	c
would	c
wait	c
for	c
him	c
.	c

Leon	c
hate	i
dog	i
,	c
and	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
why	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
a	c
friend	c
who	c
had	c
just	c
received	i
a	c
little	c
dog	c
.	c

But	c
he	c
was	c
a	i
Pat	c
's	c
friend	c
too	c
,	c
and	c
Pat	c
explained	c
everything	c
to	c
Leon	c
.	c

Dear	c

I	c
read	c
the	c
information	c
as	i
you	c
gave	c
to	c
me	c
,	i
it	i
is	c
very	c
interesting	c

It	c
is	c
very	c
good	c
due	i

According	i
to	i
Camp	c
California	c
in	c
the	c
U.S.A.	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
,	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
assure	c
you	c
that	c
I	c
would	i
do	c
my	c
best	c
to	c
be	c
the	i
one	c
of	c
the	c
winners	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
.	c

Now	c
,	c
If	i
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
state	i
some	c
of	c
the	c
information	c
that	c
you	c
may	c
need	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
mostly	c
because	c
I	c
like	c
fresh	c
air	c
at	c
night	c
.	c

From	c
the	c
list	c
of	c
activities	c
in	c
which	c
I	c
will	c
have	c
a	c
chance	c
to	c
compete	c
I	c
have	c
choosen	i
:	i
basketball	c
and	c
swimming	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
those	c
kinds	c
of	c
sports	c
and	c
think	c
that	c
I	c
could	c
be	c
the	c
winner	c
.	c

I	c
will	c
wait	c
to	c
hearing	i
from	c
you	c
,	c
soon	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
agree	c
with	c
the	c
opinion	c
that	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
first	c
place	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
point	c
out	c
that	c
to	c
go	c
shopping	c
does	c
not	c
always	c
mean	c
to	c
buy	c
something	c
.	c

But	c
,	c
what	c
about	c
real	c
shopping	c
.	i

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
shopping	c
is	c
enjoyable	c
when	c
you	c
are	c
going	c
only	c
for	c
fan	i
.	c

It	c
is	c
really	c
wonderful	c
.	c

I	c
wonder	c
if	c
it	c
is	c
all	c
right	c
for	i
that	c
time	c
.	c

By	c
the	c
way	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
the	i
shopping	c
especially	i
for	c
clothes	c
,	i
I	c
want	c
to	c
buy	c
some	c
for	c
myself	c
.	c

And	c
do	c
you	c
think	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
exchange	c
money	c
before	c
I	c
go	c
there	c
?	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
your	c
letter	c

Introduction	c

This	i
report	i
is	i
aim	i
to	i
research	i
the	i

about	i
it	i
.	c

Lots	c
of	c
student	i
normally	c
have	c
classes	c
in	c
the	c
morning	c
.	c

The	c
arts	c
students	c
want	c
to	c
learn	c
another	c
foreign	c
language	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
some	c
foreign	c
students	c
hope	c
there	c
will	c
be	c
some	c
English	c
classes	c
that	c
aim	i
to	i
the	c
examination	c
.	c

Open	i

classes	i
at	i
part-time	i
for	c
the	c
students	c
who	c
is	i
interested	c
in	c
it	i
.	c

However	c
,	c
it	c
was	i
different	i
from	i
the	i
fact	i
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
did	c
not	c
act	i
as	c
you	c

Secondly	c
Discounts	i
did	i
not	c

I	c
look	c

People	c

put	c

fitted-suit	i
such	c
as	c

.	i

The	c
most	c
important	c
things	i
is	i
the	i
fugure	i
,	c
such	i
as	i
long	i
legs	i
or	i
pear-sharped	i
.	c

Because	c
the	i
fashion	c
has	c
repeated	i
many	i
times	i
in	i
the	i
circle	i
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
informing	i
letter	c
and	c
your	c
congratulations	c

I	c
'm	c
very	i
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
it	c
as	c
I	c
've	c
never	c
been	c
in	i
the	c
U.S.A.	c
before	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
used	c
to	c
sleep	i
in	c
tent	i
from	c
my	c
previous	c
holidays	c
and	c
I	c
always	c
injoyed	i
it	c
.	c

I	c
'd	c
just	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
if	c
the	c
tents	c
at	c
the	c
camp	c
are	c
based	i
on	i
sharing	i
and	c
how	c
many	c
people	c
is	i
there	c
in	c
one	c
tent	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
hard	c
to	c
choose	c
only	c
two	c
.	c

I	c
'd	c
also	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
how	c
far	c
is	i
it	i
to	c
the	c
nearest	c
village	c
and	c
how	c
much	c
cash	c
do	i
I	c
need	c
for	c
two-weeks	i
stay	c
at	c
the	c

about	c
my	c
experience	c

It	c
was	c
very	c
hectic	c
there	c
as	c
everyone	c
was	c
a	c
bit	c
nervous	c
but	c
I	c
saw	c
the	c
main	c
stars	c
and	c
even	c
managed	c
to	c
talk	c
to	c
them	c
.	c

When	c
they	c
started	c
to	c
play	c
I	c
was	c
told	c
to	c
change	c
my	c
post	c
again	c
.	c

This	c
time	c
I	c
was	c
helping	c
the	c
medical	c
workers	c
who	c
had	c

that	c
you	c
asked	c
my	i

Two	c
weeks	c

the	c
USA	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
great	c
occasion	i
for	c
me	c
to	c

after	c
that	c
.	c

You	c
asked	c
my	i

shops	i
during	i
10	c
hours	c
and	c
tried	c
at	c

2,000	c
shoes	c
,	c
I	c
finally	c
found	c
what	c
I	c
was	c
looking	c
for	c
.	c

I	c
stayed	c
that	i
happy	c
during	c
the	c
travel	i
,	c
thinking	c
of	c
how	c
cool	c
I	c
would	c
look	c
on	i
the	c
playground	c
with	c
my	c
brand	i
new	i
shoes	c
on	c
.	c

It	c
seems	c

play	c
with	i
old	c
shoes	c
for	c
one	c
more	c
summer	c

you	c
know	c
what	c
the	c
important	c
details	c
were	i
.	c

The	c
most	c

to	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
speak	c
to	c
the	c
singers	c
,	c
the	c
whole	c
environment	c
,	c

You	c
asked	c
me	c
which	c
accomodation	i
I	c

It	c
's	c
ages	c
since	c
I	c
have	i
been	i
sleeping	i

a	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

However	c
this	i
year	c
was	c
n't	c
like	c
last	c
year	c
.	c

My	c
job	c
was	c
as	i
simple	i
as	i
selling	c
ice-creams	c
.	c

You	c
might	c
say	c
that	c
it	c
is	i
quite	c
boring	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
so	i
funny	i
.	c

What	c
I	c
particularly	c
liked	c
about	c
it	c
was	c
that	c
the	c
staff	c
was	c
like	c
a	c
big	c
family	c
.	c

Everybody	c
was	c
ready	c
to	c
help	c
each	c
other	c
.	c

Love	c
from	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
organising	c
a	c
good	c
programme	c
for	c
us	c
.	c

However	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
suggest	c
a	c
good	c
idea	c
as	c
a	c
representative	c
of	c
our	c
class	c
.	c

It	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
to	c
study	c
the	c
latest	c
fashion	c
trend	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
climbing	c
,	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
something	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
doing	c
since	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
child	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
could	c
consider	c
myself	c
an	c
expert	c
in	c
it	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
this	c
apparently	c
quite	i
and	c
relaxed	c
activitie	i
can	c
sometimes	c
turn	c
into	c
a	c
living	c
hell	c
;	c
you	c
may	c
only	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
go	c
shopping	c
at	c
the	c
weekend	c
and	c
then	c
,	c
if	c
you	c
do	c
go	c
,	c
you	c
will	c
find	c
yourself	c
in	c
the	c
middle	c
of	c
a	c
huge	c
crowd	c
of	c
people	c
,	c
unable	c
to	c
get	c
to	c
any	c
product	c
or	c
even	c
shop	c
and	c
feeling	c
dizzy	c
by	i
the	c
mixture	c
of	c
smells	c
that	c
come	c
from	c
the	c
people	c
.	c

Nevertheless	c
the	c
worst	c
will	c
come	c
when	c
you	c
lose	c
the	c
youngest	c
member	c
of	c
your	c
family	c
and	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
spend	c
the	c
whole	c
day	c
looking	c
for	c
him/her	c
.	c

I	c
received	c
your	c
letter	c
this	c
morning	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
suprised	i
it	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
stay	c
at	i
long	i
cabins	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
stayed	c
at	i
tents	c
many	c
times	c
in	c
my	c
childhood	c
.	c

The	c
most	c
exciting	c
offer	c
is	c
your	c
activities	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
he	c
retired	c

with	c
the	c

with	c

a	c
little	c

They	c
promissed	i
me	c
that	c
they	c
would	c
call	c
me	c
some	i
day	i

what	i
I	c
particulary	i
doubt	c

It	c
's	c
an	i
unique	c

How	c
has	c
modern	c

changed	c

Since	c

got	i
a	c

with	c
Internet	i

my	c
social	c
life	c
has	c
changed	c

Technology	i
has	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
programs	c
that	c
lead	i
you	c
communicate	c
with	c
others	c
in	c

It	c
is	c
incredible	c
how	c
it	c

I	c

,	c
we	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
to	c

have	c
to	c

to	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
because	c
if	c
the	c
advertisement	c
had	c
been	c
right	c
,	c
there	c
should	c
had	i
to	i
be	i
a	c
luxury	c
restaurant	c
where	c
I	c
could	c
eat	c
.	c

To	c
apologise	c
and	c
give	c
the	c
impression	c
of	c
being	c
a	c
serious	c
theatre	c
.	c

What	c
could	i
be	i
out	i
of	i
control	i
of	i
technology	i
?	c

Since	c
the	c
scientific	c
revolution	c
and	c
the	c
Industrial	c
Revolution	c
,	c
between	c
17th	i
and	c
18th	c
century	i
there	c
have	c
been	c
sudden	c
changes	c
in	c
our	c
daily	c
way	i
of	i
living	i
.	c

For	c
me	c
it	c
's	c
very	c
important	c
to	i
have	i
my	i
mobile	i
and	i
computer	i
never	i
broken	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
this	c
letter	c
because	c
we	c
saw	c
your	c
programme	c
for	c
our	c
next	c
trip	c
to	c
London	c
and	c
we	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
suggest	c
you	i
just	c
one	c
thing	c
.	c

The	c
show	c
is	c
going	c
to	c
take	c
place	c
in	c
the	c
Gernal	i
Exhibition	c
Hall	c
in	c
London	c
,	c
the	i
thurday	i
14	c
of	c
March	c
,	c
so	c
could	i
be	c
a	c
good	c
idea	c
to	c
see	c
this	c
show	c
intead	i
of	c
go	i
to	c
Science	i
Museum	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
is	i
student	i
free	i
.	c

In	c
this	c
letter	c
you	c
ask	c
me	c
some	i
further	c
information	c
for	i
my	i
conveniance	i
for	i
this	i
trip	i
.	c

The	c
activities	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
chosen	c
are	c
sailing	c
and	c
climbing	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
never	c
sailed	c
but	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
well	i
swimmer	c
.	c

I	c
also	i
wondering	c
me	i
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
need	c
and	c
if	c
there	c
is	c
a	c
safe	c
place	c
where	c
I	c
can	c
put	c
my	c
money	c
and	c

In	i
the	i
street	c
is	c
so	c
crowded	c
that	c
you	c
ca	c
n't	c
walk	c
like	c
usually	i
and	c
if	c
you	c
go	c
with	c
some	c
friends	c
you	c
can	c
be	c
sure	c
that	c
you	c
will	c
lost	i
them	c
.	c

At	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
the	c
month	c
when	c
your	c
husband	c
will	c
receive	c
the	c
bill	c
from	i
you	i
visa	i
card	i
he	c
will	c
have	c
an	i
heart-attack	i
!	c

We	c
think	c
that	c
perhaps	c
in	i
Tuesday	c
March	c
14	c
,	i
we	c
could	c
change	c
the	c
time	c
of	i
going	i
to	c
Science	i
Museum	c
,	c
and	c
(	i
we	i
)	i
go	c
earlier	i
to	i
the	i
Museum	i
,	c
such	i
as	i
half	c
past	c
eight	c
on	i
the	c
morning	c
,	c
so	c
we	c
could	c
go	c
after	i
,	c
at	c
ten	c
o'clock	c
to	i
the	c
show	c
,	c
and	c
we	c
could	c
also	c
delay	c
going	c
shopping	c
on	c
that	c
afternoon	c
,	c
because	c
the	c
show	c
lasts	c
til	i
seven	c
o'clock	c
on	i
the	c
evening	c
.	c

And	c
we	c
have	i
thought	i
that	c
we	c
could	c
go	c
shopping	c
the	c
next	c
day	c
,	c
because	c
we	c
do	i
not	i
have	i
nothing	i
to	c
do	c
on	c
that	c
afternoon	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
to	c
know	i
more	c
about	c
fashion	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

We	c
wo	c
n't	c
have	c
the	i
necessity	i
of	i
going	i
out	i
from	i
home	c
,	c
because	c
computer	i
will	c
give	c
us	c
everything	c
.	c

Although	c
computers	c
will	c
give	c
us	c
all	c
the	c
material	c
things	c
,	c
it	i
could	i
not	c
give	c
us	c
things	c
like	c
the	c
feeling	c
of	c
being	c
in	c
your	c
home	c
,	c
have	i
,	c
etc.	c
That	i
things	c
wo	c
n't	c
change	c
in	c
our	c
home	c
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
home	c
our	c
conditions	i
of	i
life	i
will	c
approve	i
,	c
and	c
computer	i
will	c
be	c
very	c
important	c
for	c
us	c
,	c
but	c
is	i
wo	c
n't	c
control	c
us	c
,	c
because	c
we	c
still	c
have	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
thing	c
of	i
a	c
home	c
=	i
have	i
,	i
that	i
will	c
be	c
the	c
same	c
as	c
now	c
.	c

I	c
acxepted	i
it	i
and	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
inform	c
you	c
that	c
I	c
can	c
travel	c
only	c
on	i
July	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
booked	c
my	c
anual	i
leave	c
that	i
period	c
.	c

Every	c
years	i
my	c
parents	c
used	c
to	c
sent	i
me	c
for	i
holidays	i
at	i
Camps	c
on	i
the	c
mountains	c
so	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
stay	c
for	c
a	c
while	c
in	c
the	c
same	c
accommodation	i
,	i
and	c
environment	c
.	c

My	c
parents	c
brought	i
me	c
to	c
the	c
sea	i
side	i
every	c
weekend	c
so	c
I	c
was	i
used	c
to	c
be	i
inside	i
the	c
water	c
all	c
the	i
seasons	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
should	c
have	c
with	c
me	c
,	i
where	c
can	c
I	c
keep	c
them	i
?	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

I	c
am	c
a	c
member	c
in	i
the	c
council	c
team	c
so	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
help	c
them	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
that	c
was	c
organized	c
in	i
the	i
last	c
month	c
.	c

It	c
took	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
to	c
testifite	i
the	c
speakers	c
and	c
the	c
microphones	c
.	c

I	c
helped	c
them	c
to	c
the	i
music	c
and	c
to	i
the	c
songs	c
.	c

The	c
audients	i
was	c
excited	c
and	c
I	c
cannot	c
discribe	i
my	c
happyness	i
.	c

yours	c
sincerely	c

My	c
experience	c
in	i
camping	c
is	c
not	c
so	c
huge	c
to	i
stay	c
in	c
tents	i
for	c
2	c
weeks	c
.	c

Therefore	i
,	i
you	i
asked	c
me	c
what	c
activities	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
join	c
.	i

Moreover	c
,	c
could	c
you	c
please	c
tell	c
me	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
should	c
take	c
with	c
me	c
?	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
going	c
on	c
holidays	i
.	c

Mr	c
Oliver	c
Herre	c

As	c
you	c
know	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
fairly	c
busy	c
with	c
my	i
studying	c
for	c
my	c
First	c
Certificate	c
.	c

So	c
many	c
happy	c
people	c
in	c
the	c
crowds	c
,	c
that	c
the	c
atmosphere	c
was	c
infectious	c
.	c

Anyway	c
,	c
what	c
you	c
wanted	c
to	c
know	c
was	c
what	c
has	i
been	i
my	i
job	i
.	c

Actually	c
my	c
job	c
was	c
not	c
really	c
stressful	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
had	c
contact	c
and	i
access	c
to	c
all	c
the	c
famous	c
Pop	i
Stars	i
.	c

I	c
had	c
to	c
bring	c
them	c
refreshments	c
.	c

Lots	c
of	c
love	c
,	c

Mr	c
or	c
Mrs	c
Manager	c

Circle	c
Theatre	c

My	c
name	c
is	c
Taeron	c
Jon	c
.	c

Secondly	c
about	i
the	c
time	c
.	c

For	c
me	c
,	c
It	c
's	c
not	c
easy	c
to	c
have	i
holiday	i
and	c
your	c
play	c
just	c
blew	c
my	c
precious	c
time	c
away	c
.	c

Let	c
me	c
make	c
it	c
clear	c
,	c
you	c
blew	i
my	c
time	c
and	c
money	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
thing	i
your	c
play	c
worth	c
£	c
20.00	c
.	c

Taeron	c
Jon	c

As	c
I	c
said	c
before	c
,	c
fashion	c
is	c
somehow	c
influenced	c
by	c
science	c
and	c
insperations	i
that	c
we	c
get	c
from	c
all	c
sort	i
of	c
enviroment	i
.	c

But	c
what	c
about	c
100	c
year	i
later	c
?	c

It	c
could	c
be	c
more	c
facinating	i
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs.	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
let	c
you	c
know	c
that	c
I	c
can	c
only	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
that	c
is	c
the	c
only	c
time	c
I	c
can	c
take	c
leave	i
from	c
work	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
the	c
log	c
cabins	c
as	c
I	c
would	c
be	c
afraid	c
of	c
insects	c
or	c
any	c
crawling	c
animals	c
if	c
I	c
have	i
to	c
stay	c
in	c
the	c
tent	c
.	c

For	c
activities	c
choices	i
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
choose	c
Tennis	c
and	c
swimming	c
.	c

Swimming	c
is	c
my	c
best	i
way	c
of	c
excercise	i
and	c
keeping	c
fit	c
.	c

Since	c
all	c
accommodation	c
and	c
travel	c
costs	c
are	c
paid	c
for	c
,	c
Are	i
there	c
any	c
other	c
expenses	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
pay	i
?	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
what	c
type	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	i
should	i
bring	c
?	c

Thank	c
you	c
once	c
again	c
for	c
giving	c
me	c
good	i
news	c
!	c

If	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
buy	c
a	c
nice	c
pair	c
of	c
shoe	i
,	c
I	i
'll	i
have	i
to	c
go	c
into	c
a	c
city	c
centre	c
and	c
browse	c
around	c
from	c
shops	i
to	i
shops	i
until	c
I	c
find	c
the	c
shoes	c
I	c
like	c
.	c

If	c
I	c
'm	c
not	c
lucky	c
enough	c
to	c
find	c
one	i
,	c
then	c
I	i
'll	i
have	i
to	c
take	c
a	c
train	c
trip	i
to	c
a	c
larger	c
shopping	c
places	i
such	c
as	c
London	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
can	c
see	c
,	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

SECONDLY	c
,	c
AS	c
I	c
WROTE	c
BEFORE	c
,	c
THE	c
PLAY	c
STARTED	c
LATE	c
,	c
AND	c
FOR	c
ME	c
IT	c
WAS	c
TERRIBLE	c
TO	c
WAIT	c
FORTY	i
FIVE	i
MINUTES	c
.	c

FINALLY	c
I	c
COULD	c
N'T	c
EAT	c
TOO	i
.	c

BECAUSE	c
FOR	c
ME	c
IT	c
WAS	c
NOT	c
A	c
"	c
PERFECT	c
EVENING	c
OUT	c
"	c
.	c

UNFORTUNATELY	c
,	c
PAT	c
WAS	c
NOT	c
VERY	c
GOOD	c
AT	c
KEEPING	c
SECRETS	c
.	c

SO	c
MANY	c
TIME	i
HE	c
WAS	c
TOLD	c
:	c
"	c
PAT	c
I	i
SAY	i
THIS	c
SECRET	c
ONLY	c
TO	c
YOU	c
"	c
.	c

THIS	c
WAS	c
TERRIBLE	c
FOR	c
HIS	c
FRIENDSHIP	i
:	c
HE	c
ALWAYS	c
LOST	c
HIS	c
FRIENDS	c
.	c

HE	c
WANTED	c
TO	c
DIE	c
FOR	i
THIS	c
.	c

ONE	c
DAY	c
THE	i
FORTUNE	c
HELPED	c
OUR	c
POOR	c
PAT	c
.	c

WHEN	c
THE	c
ROBBER	c
UNDERSTOOD	i
HE	c
COULD	c
BE	c
DISCOVERED	c
HE	i
SAID	c
"	i
IF	c
YOU	c
DO	c
N'T	c
KEEP	c
THE	i
SECRET	c
I	c
WILL	c
KILL	c
YOU	c
"	c
.	c

EVENTUALLY	c
THE	c
ROBBER	c
WAS	c
CAUGHT	c
BY	c
THE	c
POLICE	c
,	c
AND	c
FOR	c
HIS	c
BRAVE	i
AND	c
HONESTY	c
HE	c
HAD	c
A	c
LOT	c
OF	c
FRIENDS	c
.	c

And	c
what	c
about	c
the	c
starting	c
time	c
?	c

I	c
had	c
to	c
wait	c
for	c
about	c
an	c
hour	c
,	c
as	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
at	c
20.15	c
instead	c
of	c
19.30	c
.	c

Another	c
thing	c
that	c
made	c
me	c
angry	c
was	c
that	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
have	i
a	c
discount	c
.	c

At	i
the	i
top	i
of	i
everything	i
,	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
being	c
restructurated	i
,	c
so	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
have	c
my	c
dinner	c
either	c
!	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
terrible	c
evening	c
out	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
ask	c
you	c
for	c
a	c
refund	c
for	c
all	c
the	c
troubles	i
you	c
caused	c
me	c
.	c

Most	c
people	c
think	c
modern	c
technologies	c
are	c
n't	c
so	i
positive	c
as	c
they	c
are	c
often	c
showed	i
.	i

Anyway	c
,	c
the	c
thing	c
that	c
has	c
most	i
changed	i
my	i
daily	i
life	i
is	c
the	c
personal	c
computer	c
and	c
,	c
expecially	i
,	c
internet	i
.	c

Then	c
,	c
surfing	c
in	i
internet	i
is	c
becoming	c
my	c
passion	c
:	c
it	c
's	c
incredible	c
how	c
many	c
unthinkable	c
activities	c
you	c
can	c
do	c
with	c
it	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
noticed	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
watching	c
it	c
that	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
was	c
performing	c
.	c

Also	c
,	c
the	c
times	c
printed	c
on	i
your	c
advertisment	i
was	i
14.30	c
and	c
19:30	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
my	c
evening	c
planned	c
out	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
not	c
pleased	c
that	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
forty-five	c
minutes	c
late	c
.	c

On	i
your	c
advertisment	i
,	c
it	c
said	c
that	c
discounts	c
were	c
available	c
for	c
the	c
tickets	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
rather	c
thirsty	c
and	c
hungry	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
and	c
on	i
your	c
advertisment	i
,	i
it	i
made	c
a	c
cup	c
of	c
tea	c
and	c
some	c
cakes	c
in	c
your	c
restaurant	c
sound	c
rather	c
inviting	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
to	c
my	c
disappointment	c
,	c
the	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
being	c
redecorated	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
not	c
my	c
'	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
'	c
,	c
as	c
your	c
advertisment	i
said	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
some	c
refund	i
back	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
would	i
give	c
these	c
problems	c
your	c
immediate	c
attention	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

How	c
could	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
so	c
stupid	c
,	c
so	c
blind	c
not	i
to	c
see	c
her	c
disability	i
to	c
keep	c
the	c
biggest	c
secret	c
about	c
my	c
biggest	c
crush	c
ever	c
?	c

I	c
was	c
seething	c
.	c

Once	c
in	c
a	c
while	c
my	c
old	c
schoolmates	c
came	c
and	c
visited	c
me	c
and	c
we	c
had	c
lots	c
of	c
fun	c
together	c
,	c
just	c
like	c
the	c
old	c
times	c
.	c

When	c
my	c
parents	c
told	c
me	c
the	c
news	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
stunned	c
,	c

However	c
,	c
the	c
person	c
who	c
helped	c
me	c
through	c
this	c
hard	c
time	c
was	c
,	c
surprisingly	c
,	c
Pat	c
.	c

She	c
was	c
a	c
person	c
I	c
could	c
turn	c
to	c
,	c
I	c
could	c
trust	c
.	c

Ever	c
since	c
,	c
she	c
gained	i
my	c
trust	c
and	c
told	i
her	c
my	c
feelings	c
and	c
secrets	c
.	c

Eventually	c
,	c
I	c
got	c
over	c
my	c
parents	c
'	c
divorce	c
and	c
lived	c
like	c
a	c
normal	c
,	c
happy	c
teenager	c
.	c

She	c
had	c
been	c
killed	c
by	c
a	c
speeding	c
car	c
.	c

I	c
fell	c
into	c
a	c
deep	c
depression	c
,	c
and	c
took	c
an	c
extremely	c
long	c
time	c
to	c
recover	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
read	c
the	c
programme	c
and	c
I	c
find	c
it	c
very	c
appealing	c
,	c
specially	i
because	c
of	c
the	c
River	c
trip	c
to	c
Greenwich	c
.	c

We	c
all	c
think	c
this	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
to	c
learn	c
more	c
about	c
London	i
daily	i
life	c
and	c
what	c
people	c
like	c
to	c
wear	c

Dear	c
Manager	c
,	c

I	c
went	c
to	c
it	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
was	c
really	c
disappointed	c
about	c
some	i
thing	i
.	c

Also	c
was	i
written	c
in	c
the	c
advertisment	i
that	c
some	c
discounts	c
were	c
available	c
,	c
but	c
there	c
was	i
n't	i
discounts	i
.	c

Mr	i
,	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
disappointed	c
with	c
the	c
show	c
so	c
I	c
want	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
sure	c
you	c
will	c
understand	c
my	c
reasons	c
.	c

The	c
police	c
caught	c
me	c
,	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
peacefully	c
in	c
my	c
room	c
,	c
and	c
put	c
me	c
covered	i
with	c
something	c
,	c
in	c
a	c
car	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
writting	i
to	c
you	c
because	c
I	i
've	i
been	i
in	i
the	c
International	c
Arts	c
Festival	c
and	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
pleasure	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
congratulate	c
you	c
for	i
the	c
idea	c
,	i
I	c
think	c
that	c
it	i
's	i
very	i
important	i
the	i
development	i
of	i
the	i
arts	i
and	c
that	c
everybody	c
could	c
assist	i
without	c
paying	c
too	c
much	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
you	c
should	c
call	i
more	c
artist	i
from	c
other	c
countries	c
and	c
have	c
some	c
concert	i
halls	i
bigger	i
or	c
may	i
be	i
change	c
the	c
distribution	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
waiting	c
for	c
your	c
answer	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
want	i
me	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
how	i
about	i
the	i
rules	i
are	i
here	i
,	c
I	c
'll	c
start	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
in	c
our	c
classroom	c
you	c
ca	c
n't	c
shout	c
,	c
you	c
must	c
be	c
quite	i
and	c
sat	i
.	i

In	c
my	c
home	c
I	c
can	c
avoid	c
that	i
rules	c
.	c

My	c
father	c
is	c
a	c
bit	c
jealous	c
but	c
agrees	c
with	c
what	c
my	c
mum	c
says	c
.	c

I	i
'd	i
like	i
it	i
would	i
be	i
nicer	i
going	i
there	i
.	c

I	c
have	c
just	c
received	c
the	c
letter	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Because	c
my	c
pen	c
friend	c
is	c
going	c
to	c
visit	c
me	c
on	i
June	c
.	c

I	c
was	i
playing	i
Basketball	c
in	i
the	i
university	c
.	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

I	c
went	c
with	c
Big	c
Brothers	c
the	i
name	c
of	c
the	c
band	c
.	c

As	c
I	c
told	c
you	c
two	c
month	i
ago	c
I	i
saw	c
the	c
advertisment	i
in	c
the	c
newspepper	i
.	c

They	c
did	c
not	c
new	i
each	c
one	i
.	c

The	c
consert	i
was	c
briliant	i
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
I	c
am	c
studying	c
at	c
University	c
and	c
I	c
wonder	c
if	c
I	c
could	c
travel	c
on	i
July	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
exams	c
I	c
have	c
on	i
May	c
.	c

Apart	i
from	i
that	i
I	c
would	c
not	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
travel	c
there	c
until	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
June	c
.	c

It	c
does	c
not	c
matter	c
to	c
me	c
whether	c
I	c
stay	c
in	c
tent	i
or	c
log	i
cabin	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
tent	i
to	i
be	c
much	i
more	i
in	i
contact	c
with	c
wild	i
life	i
and	c
nature	c
.	c

I	c
received	c
your	c
letter	c
last	c
week	c
in	c
which	c
you	c
told	c
me	c
that	c
you	c
want	c
to	c
hear	c
about	c
my	c
experience	c
at	c
the	c
pop	c
concert	c
.	c

Everything	c
was	c
all	c
right	c
during	c
the	c
perform	i
of	i
the	i
band	i
,	c
but	c
at	c
the	c
end	c
some	c
espectators	i
came	c
up	c
to	i
the	c
stage	c
and	c
made	i
some	c
damage	c
to	c
the	c
band	c
's	c
instrument	i
.	c

Looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

Lastly	c
,	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
a	c
piece	c
of	c
advice	c
.	c

Young	c
people	c
know	c
that	c
money	c
make	i
the	c
world	c
go	c
round	c
,	c
so	c
they	c
always	c
look	c
for	c
a	c
job	c
with	c
big	i
salary	c
.	c

Some	c
people	c
say	c
that	c
the	c
young	c
should	c
n't	c
be	c
independent	c
and	c
earn	c
on	c
their	c
own	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
am	c
sure	c
that	c
it	c
's	c
better	c
to	c
work	c
in	c
your	c
free-time	i
than	c
waste	c
it	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
help	c
them	c
,	c
they	c
may	c
give	c
you	c
some	c
money	c
as	c
a	c
reward	c
.	c

Thirdly	c
if	i
you	c
are	c
good	i
looking	i
you	c
can	c
apply	c
for	c
a	c
job	c
in	c
restaurant	i
and	c
become	c
waiter	i
.	c

Lastly	c
,	c
if	c
you	c
like	c
playing	c
instruments	c
and	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
like	c
working	c
you	c
can	c
go	c
busking	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
travel	i
on	i
July	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
going	c
to	c
finish	c
the	i
college	c
at	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
June	c
and	c
I	c
will	c
work	c
the	i
first	c
of	c
august	i
.	c

I	c
'm	c
very	c
keen	c
to	c
have	c
the	c
chance	c
to	c
do	i
some	c
activities	c
,	i
I	c
'm	c
very	c
attracted	i
by	i
the	c
golf	c
.	c

I	c
will	c
be	c
a	c
beginner	c
because	c
I	c
've	c
never	c
done	c
this	c
sport	c
before	c
but	c
I	c
will	c
have	c
a	c
try	c
.	c

I	c
've	c
know	i
idea	c
what	c
kind	i
of	i
weather	i
it	i
is	i
in	c
USA	i
could	i
you	c
let	c
me	c
know	c
what	c
type	c
of	c
clothes	c
should	i
I	i
bring	c
with	c
me	c
.	i

yours	i
Sincerly	i

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

Last	c
month	c
was	c
amazing	c
for	c
me	c
,	i
I	c
was	c
helping	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
.	c

I	c
mean	c
It	i
's	i
still	c
inbelivable	i
,	i
can	i
you	c
imagine	c
that	i
was	i
like	i
a	c
dream	c
I	i
was	c
checking	i
their	c
hands	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
I	c
will	c
go	c
back	c
the	i
next	c
year	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

First	c
point	c
,	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
see	c
Danny	c
BROOK	c
as	i
starring	i
.	c

Second	c
point	c
,	c
the	c
musical	i
show	c
had	i
to	c
begin	c
at	c
7:30	c
PM	c
but	c
we	c
have	i
waited	i
for	c
fourty	i
five	i
minutes	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
show	c
started	i
.	c

Fourth	c
point	c
,	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
visit	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
and	c
no	c
one	c
did	i
n't	i
know	i
why	c
!	c

Well	c
,	c
as	c
you	c
see	c
it	i
was	c
n't	c
a	c
"	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
!	c
"	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
you	c
could	c
give	c
to	i
me	c
some	c
money	c
back	c
because	c
I	c
really	c
have	c
the	c
impression	c
that	c
your	c
advertisement	c
is	c
wrong	c
.	c

We	c
live	c
in	c
a	c
society	c
where	c
the	i
technology	c
grows	i
up	i
everyday	i
.	c

When	c
I	c
go	c
to	c
school	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
see	c
in	i
many	i
stores	i
the	i
new	i
tools	i
they	i
've	i
just	i
received	i
.	c

This	c
little	c
paragraph	i
shows	c
that	c
I	c
depend	c
of	i
technology	c
and	c
,	c
more	i
over	i
,	c
because	c
I	c
'm	c
in	c
an	c
electronic	c
eegenering	i
school	c
,	c
I	c
'm	c
keen	c
on	c
technology	c
.	c

Modern	c
technology	c
does	c
n't	c
changed	i
my	c
daily	c
life	c
,	c
it	c
just	c
allows	c
to	i
evoluate	i
in	c
this	c
new	c
world	c
....	c

Dear	c
Jane	c
Clark	c
,	c
the	c
organiser	c
of	c
International	i
Arts	c
Festival	c

Most	c
of	c
attractions	i
are	i
excellent	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
point	c
out	c
that	c
"	i
quality	i
is	i
high	i
,	i
but	i
quantity	i
is	i
not	i
enough	i
!	i
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
the	i
only	i
"	i
six	i
countries	i
"	i
does	i
n't	i
mean	i
"	i
around	i
the	i
world	i
"	i
.	c

I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
Festival	c
again	c
!	c

AT	i
first	i
,	c
in	c
Japan	c
,	c
generally	c
school	c
rules	c
are	c
more	c
strictly	i
than	c
home	i
's	i
.	c

You	c
will	c
ask	c
me	c
why	c
,	i
the	i
reason	c
is	c
the	i
above	c
...	c
"	c
unify	i
"	c
.	c

Needless	c
to	c
say	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
change	c
such	c
ridiculous	c
rules	c
,	c
because	c
such	c
rules	c
are	c
not	c
for	c
us	c
.	c

Do	c
n't	c
you	c
think	c
so	c
?	c

Do	c
you	c
have	c
any	c
rules	c
at	c
school	c
that	c
make	c
you	c
upset	c
?	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c

We	c
think	c
that	c
Monday	c
and	c
Wednesday	c
are	c
good	c
,	c
but	c
we	c
ask	c
you	c
to	c
change	c
the	c
programme	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
.	c

We	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
dangerous	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
knew	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
.	c

We	c
lived	i
in	i
my	c
aunt	c
's	c
house	c
who	i
was	c
in	c
the	c
center	i
of	c
the	c
village	c
.	c

I	c
loocked	i
outside	c
and	c
saw	c
two	c
men	c
go	c
into	c
the	c
house	c
in	c
front	c
of	c
mine	c
.	c

I	c
though	i
it	c
was	c
some	c
rubbers	i
.	c

After	c
ten	c
minutes	c
,	c
one	c
man	c
came	c
out	c
with	c
a	c
big	c
bag	c
and	c
went	i
into	c
his	c
car	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
show	c
,	i
that	c
I	c
have	i
recently	i
attended	i
to	i
at	c
your	c
theatre	c
.	c

Do	c
you	c
think	c
,	i
that	c
world	i
will	c
be	c
different	c
from	c
current	i
world	c
then	c
?	c

And	c
if	c
I	c
were	c
asked	c
,	c
what	i
will	c
be	c
completely	c
different	c
in	c
year	i
2100	c
,	c
I	i
would	c
say	c
:	c
clothes	c
.	c

Most	c
of	c
the	c
scientists	c
,	c
when	c
asked	c
about	c
the	c
Earth	c
in	c
a	c
hundred	c
years	c
claim	i
,	i
that	c
it	c
is	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
absolutely	c
scorching	c
here	c
then	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
if	c
the	c
weather	c
is	c
so	c
good	c
people	c
will	c
very	c
quickly	c
forget	c
about	c
any	c
winter	c
clothes	c
.	c

But	c
in	c
case	c
my	c
predictions	c
are	c
right	c
,	c
maybe	c
you	c
should	c
buy	c
a	c
new	c
pair	c
of	c
shorts	c
?	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
this	c
letter	c
to	c
give	c
my	c
opinion	c
on	c
the	c
last	c
International	c
arts	i
festival	i
.	c

Secondly	c
the	i
plays	c
and	c
films	c
were	c
very	c
good	i
organized	c
despide	i
being	i
short	i
number	i
.	c

The	c
art	c
exhibition	c
and	c
the	c
talks	c
by	c
writers	c
were	c
great	c
.	c

The	c
rules	c
in	c
my	c
country	c
are	c
standart	i
,	c
I	c
mean	c
,	c
the	c
rules	c
are	c
very	c
similar	c
to	c
other	c
countries	c
in	c
Europe	c
.	c

Teachers	c
will	c
take	c
it	c
from	c
you	c
if	c
it	c
rangs	i
during	c
school	c
hours	c
.	c

As	i
well	i
you	i
are	i
n't	i
allowed	c
to	c
bring	c
drugs	c
or	c
arms	c
,	c
to	c
smoke	c
or	c
to	c
drink	c
alcohol	c
inside	c
the	c
school	c
.	c

You	c
have	c
to	c
respect	c
other	c
peoples	i
opinion	i
,	c
teachers	c
,	c
school	i
's	i
material	i
and	c
people	c
who	c
works	i
in	c
the	c
school	c
.	c

At	c
home	c
I	c
'm	c
allowed	c
to	c
do	c
what	c
I	c
want	c
if	c
I	c
'm	c
respectful	c
with	i
my	c
parent	i
's	i
time	i
table	i
.	c

As	c
well	c
have	i
the	c
responsability	i
to	i
look	i
after	c
my	c
brother	c
in	i
case	i
they	c
are	c
n't	c
at	c
home	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
never	c
been	c
good	c
at	c
team	c
sports	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
really	c
like	c
basketball	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
can	c
be	c
very	c
interesting	c
to	c
meet	c
other	c
people	c
by	c
means	c
of	c
this	c
team	c
sport	c
.	c

I	c
like	c
swimming	c
too	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
best	c
sports	c
to	c
keep	c
you	c
fit	c
and	c
healthy	c
.	c

Is	c
it	c
necessary	c
to	c
take	c
dressed	i
cloth	i
for	c
any	c
formal	c
events	c
?	c

Must	c
I	c
take	c
cash	c
money	i
or	c
can	c
I	c
use	c
the	i
credit	c
cards	c
?	c

We	c
arrived	c
at	c
the	c
stadium	c
the	c
previous	i
evening	i
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
we	c
were	c
asked	c
to	c
clear	i
the	c
stadium	c
,	c
especially	c
the	c
seats	c
and	c
surroundings	c
.	c

When	c
we	c
finished	c
clearing	i
,	c
some	c
of	c
us	c
offered	c
our	i
help	i
to	c
enter	i
the	c
sound	c
equipment	c
into	c
the	c
stadium	c
.	c

And	c
she	c
dedicated	c
the	c
photograph	c
to	c
me	c
!	c

I	c
still	c
believe	c
it	c
has	c
only	c
been	c
a	c
dream	c
!	c

I	c
am	c
willing	c
to	c
show	c
you	c
the	c
authograph	i
and	c
the	c
photograph	c
.	c

We	c
will	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
talk	c
bout	i
the	c
concert	c
and	c
we	c
will	c
listen	c
together	c
to	c
the	i
last	i
Celine	i
Dion	i

Best	c
wishes	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
from	c
Brazil	c
and	c
I	c
recently	c
expent	i
a	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

As	i
I	c
got	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
I	c
asked	c
for	c
the	c
discounts	c
shown	c
in	c
your	c
advertisement	c
,	c
but	c
they	c
were	c
not	c
avaible	i
.	c

So	c
I	c
sitted	i
in	c
my	c
chair	c
and	c
waited	c
for	c
45	c
minutes	c
until	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
,	c
that	i
is	c
an	c
unacceptable	c
delay	c
.	c

Even	i
though	i
I	c
was	c
still	c
excited	c
about	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
but	c
then	c
I	c
sudently	i
realise	i
that	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
is	i
not	c
performing	c
,	c
he	c
had	c
been	c
replaced	c
by	c
an	c
extremely	c
disappointing	c
actor	c
.	c

The	c
night	c
had	i
been	i
terrible	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
could	c
be	i
saved	c
by	c
a	c
nice	c
dinner	c
in	c
your	c
restaurant	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
been	i
closed	c
because	c
the	c
heater	c
was	c
not	c
working	c
due	c
to	c
leaking	i
.	c

As	c
you	c
can	c
see	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
the	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
your	c
advertisement	c
talked	c
about	c
.	c

How	c
has	c
modern	c
technology	c
changed	c
your	c
daily	c
lief	i
.	i

When	c
I	c
was	c
younger	c
I	i
remember	c
that	c
when	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
study	c
or	c
to	c
work	c
on	c
a	c
school	c
project	c
I	c
would	c
take	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
time	c
researching	c
on	i
libraries	c
,	c
looking	c
for	c
old	c
books	c
.	c

Today	c
I	c
can	c
connect	c
to	c
the	c
Internet	c
and	c
find	c
all	c
the	c
information	c
I	c
need	c
faster	c
than	c
you	c
can	c
imagine	c
.	c

But	c
technology	c
is	c
not	c
just	c
about	c
studying	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
entertainment	c
too	c
!	c

I	c
can	c
also	c
listen	c
to	c
cds	i
,	c
play	c
the	c
latest	c
games	c
,	c
watching	i
concerts.	c
.	c

everything	c
in	c
a	c
zap	c
.	c

We	c
saw	c
your	i
details	c
and	c
enjoyed	i
them	i
.	c

Especially	c
River	i
trip	c
to	c
Greenwich	c
and	c
visiting	c
National	i
Art	c
Gallery	c
.	c

It	c
will	c
be	c
at	c
Central	i
Exhibition	c
Hall	c
,	c
London	c
.	c

One	c
more	c
thing	c
about	c
show	i
is	c
,	i
it	i
's	c
free	c
for	c
students	c
.	c

This	c
changing	i
,	i
give	i
us	c
an	i
opportunity	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
show	i
on	c
Tuesday	c
afternoon	c
.	c

It	c
will	i
make	c
us	c
so	c
happy	c
.	c

Reason	i
for	c
this	c
;	i
they	i
are	c
famous	c
and	c
everybody	c
wants	c
to	c
learn	i
about	c
them	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
,	i
people	c
want	c
this	c
.	c

if	i
you	c
are	c
a	c
famous	c
person	c
,	c
for	c
example	c
singer	i
,	c
film	c
star	c
,	c
politician	c
or	c
well-know	i
footballer	c
,	c
you	c
have	c
n't	c
get	i
any	c
choice	c
.	c

I	c
know	c
,	i
they	c
are	c
not	c
like	c
us	c
.	c

They	c
nead	i
to	c
be	c
with	c
their	c
family	c
in	c
silence	i
.	c

We	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
to	c
learn	i
their	i
every	c
second	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
the	i
one	c
I	c
saw	c
a	c
week	c
ago	c
in	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
was	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
worst	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
be	c
very	c
pleased	c
if	c
you	c
answered	c
my	c
request	c
soon	c
.	c

The	i
school	i
finished	c
and	c
we	c
,	c
I	c
mean	c
Pat	c
,	c
Tim	c
and	c
me	c
,	c
did	c
n't	c
know	c
what	c
to	c
do	c
with	c
plenty	i
of	i
spare	c
time	c
.	c

Tim	c
gave	i
a	c
proposition	i
about	c
going	c
at	i
the	c
sea	i
by	i
his	c
new	c
car	c
.	c

It	c
seemed	c
fantastic	c
but	c
we	c
knew	c
our	c
parents	c
would	c
never	c
agree	c
.	c

Of	c
course	c
we	i
did	c
n't	c
wanted	i
to	c
go	c
there	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
just	c
a	c
"	c
cover	c
"	c
.	c

Two	c
days	c
before	c
going	c
Pat	i
was	c
packing	c
her	c
luggage	c
and	c
asked	c
her	c
mother	c
to	c
help	c
her	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
must	c
congratulate	c
the	c
people	c
responsible	c
of	i
this	c
good	c
idea	c
.	c

But	c
including	c
only	c
six	c
countries	c
in	c
the	c
festival	c
does	c
not	c
seem	c
enough	c
,	c
in	c
my	c
opinion	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	i
,	c

The	i
topic	i
says	c
that	c
young	c
people	c
have	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
problems	c
,	c
but	c
without	c
any	c
doubt	c
,	c
money	c
is	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
of	c
them	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
still	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
economical	i
freedom	i
from	c
your	c
parents	c
and	c
your	c
studies	c
do	c
n't	c
permit	c
you	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
full-time	c
job	c
,	c
these	c
are	c
some	c
suggestions	c
that	c
maybe	c
will	c
help	c
you	c
.	c

One	c
possible	c
thing	c
is	c
to	c
display	c
in	i
a	i
public	i
place	i
what	i
you	i
can	i
do	i
best	i
,	c
and	c
,	c
then	c
,	c
"	c
sell	c
"	c
it	c
to	c
the	c
people	c

Dear	c
Ms	c
,	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
answer	c
to	i
you	i
question	i
,	i
please	i
notice	i
that	c
I	c
can	c
travel	c
only	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
only	c
then	c
I	i
can	i
take	c
holidays	c
from	c
my	c
work	c
,	c
after	c
the	c
busy	c
time	c
of	i
month	i
May	i
and	c
June	c
.	c

I	c
prefer	c
to	c
staying	i
in	c
cabin	i
because	c
never	i
before	i
I	i
when	i
on	i
holidays	i
in	i
tent.	i
,	c
so	c
I	c
think	c
is	i
more	c
corfotabel	i
to	c
sleep	c
in	c
bet	i
instand	i
of	c
outside	c
in	c
tent	i
.	c

Basketball	i
I	i
think	i
I	i
can	i
playing	i
well	c
,	c
because	c
few	i
years	c
ago	c
I	c
was	c
mamber	i
of	c
the	c
scool	i
team	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
the	c
assistent	i
of	c
the	c
responsible	i
person	i
for	c
the	c
clothes	c
and	c
make-up	c
of	c
the	c
pop-group	i
,	i
realy	i
I	c
was	c
very	c
nervous	c
about	c
that	c
because	c
was	i
the	i
first	c
time	c
with	c
so	i
famous	c
people	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
happy	c
that	c
all	c
the	c
things	c
went	c
very	c
well	c
Kim	i
what	i
realy	i
particularly	c
liked	c
was	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
asked	c
to	c
do	c
the	c
make-up	c
on	c
my	c
on	i
realy	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
nervous	c
but	c
at	c
same	i
moment	i
very	c
happy	c
,	c
but	c
every	i
thing	i
when	i
well	c
and	c
everyboby	i
was	c
very	c
hapy	i
with	c
my	c
work	c

Dear	c
Ms	c
Clark	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
mention	c
my	c
opinions	c
on	c
the	c
International	c
Arts	c
Festival	c
that	c
you	c
have	c
organised	c
this	c
year	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
great	c
idea	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
think	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
make	c
some	c
points	c
about	c
the	c
things	c
that	c
I	c
found	c
unsatisfactory	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
disappointed	c
that	c
the	c
artists	c
invited	c
were	c
from	c
only	c
six	c
countries	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
found	c
the	c
idea	c
of	c
a	c
single	c
ticket	c
for	c
all	c
events	i
of	c
the	c
weekend	c
excellent	c
,	c
as	c
the	c
price	c
was	c
reasonable	c
and	c
access	c
to	c
a	c
wide	c
range	c
of	c
events	c
was	c
provided	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
glad	c
to	c
have	c
received	c
your	c
letter	c
and	c
I	c
'd	c
really	c
like	c
to	c
talk	c
about	c
the	c
school	c
and	c
family	c
rules	c
here	c
.	c

I	c
'd	c
love	c
to	c
write	c
more	c
,	c
Mary	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
'm	c
in	c
a	c
real	c
rush	c
nowadays	c
.	c

Take	c
care	c
!	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
,	c

This	c
show	c
is	c
about	c
the	c
latest	c
fashions	c
,	c
the	i
leisure	c
and	c
sports	c
wear	c
,	c
the	i
make-up	c
and	c
the	i
hairstyles	c
.	c

Hoping	c
to	c
hear	c
from	i
your	c
decision	c
soon	c
.	c

On	c
one	i
hand	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
true	c
because	c
famous	c
people	c
have	c
to	c
do	c
their	c
jobs	c
,	c
that	c
means	c
being	c
interviewed	c
,	c
giving	c
news	c
to	c
the	c
audiance	i
,	c
and	c
soon	i
.	c

However	c
,	c
on	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
it	c
must	c
be	c
so	c
annoying	c
to	c
be	c
followed	c
by	c
journalists	c
or	c
photographs	i
all	c
the	c
time	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
sure	c
that	c
nobody	c
would	c
like	c
this	c
.	c

That	c
is	c
why	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
famous	c
people	c
deserve	c
a	c
private	c
life	c
,	c
like	c
everybody	c
,	i
and	c
that	c
journalists	c
should	c
not	c
follow	c
them	c
everywhere	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
that	c
my	c
class	c
is	c
interested	c
in	c
going	c
to	c
the	c
show	c
which	c
takes	c
place	c
in	i
central	i
exhibition	i
Hall	c
in	c
London	c
in	i
14th	c
March	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
also	c
like	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
that	c
it	c
is	c
very	i
interesting	c
programme	i
because	c
it	c
includes	c
all	c
the	c
latest	c
fashion	i
about	i
leisure	c
and	c
sports	c
wear	c
make	i
up	i
as	c
well	c
as	c
hairstyles	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
great	i
opportunity	c
for	c
us	c
because	c
the	c
fashion	i
is	c
fashinating	i
and	c
free	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c
.	c

The	i
journalists	i
follow	c
the	i
famous	c
people	c
,	c
such	c
as	c
politicians	c
and	c
film	c
stars	c
,	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
take	c
fotos	i
and	c
other	i
information	c
about	c
them	c
.	c

All	c
the	i
people	c
have	c
the	c
right	c
to	c
live	c
free	i
without	i
to	i
be	i
disturbed	c
by	c
other	c
.	i

What	c
was	c
suppoused	i
to	c
be	c
a	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
turned	c
to	i
be	c
disappointing	i
one	c
instead	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
afraid	c
something	c
should	c
be	c
done	c
about	c
this	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
urge	c
you	c
to	c
refund	c
my	c
ticket	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

However	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
negative	c
aspects	c
in	i
the	c
way	c
that	c
technology	c
affects	c
my	c
life	c
.	c

As	c
technology	c
develops	c
so	c
fast	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
always	c
new	c
things	c
to	c
buy	c
,	c
and	c
it	c
also	c
reduces	c
the	c
amount	c
of	c
jobs	c
available	c
,	c
so	c
it	c
is	c
getting	c
hard	c
to	c
find	c
a	c
job	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
my	c
horrible	c
evening	c
at	c
The	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
on	c
10th	c
June	c
2000	c
.	c

I	c
bought	c
a	c
ticket	c
at	c
the	c
box	c
office	c
but	c
there	c
were	c
not	c
any	c
discounts	c
for	c
student	i
like	c
you	c
said	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
show	c
and	c
also	c
the	c
show	c
had	i
to	c
start	c
at	c
19.30	c
but	c
on	c
that	c
day	c
it	c
delaied	i
about	c
45	c
minutes	c
.	c

It	c
really	c
disappointed	c
me	c
.	c

After	c
finishing	i
the	i
show	i
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
visit	c
your	c
restaurant	c
and	c
I	c
found	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

It	i
was	c
a	c
sign	c
in	c
front	c
of	c
the	c
restaurant	c
"	i
sorry	c
we	c
closed	i
because	i
special	c
reasons	c
"	i
and	i
I	c
was	c
wondering	c
what	c
was	i
the	i
reasons	i
for	c
that	c
.	c

Finally	c
I	i
would	c
like	c
to	c
have	c
refund	i
for	c
my	c
ticket	c
back	i
because	c
it	c
was	c
horrible	i
evening	c
.	c

From	c
now	c
on	c
I	i
do	c
n't	c
want	c
to	c
tell	i
something	i
secrets	i
to	i
Pat	i
because	c
she	c
always	c
tell	i
someone	c
else	c
but	c
she	c
still	i
my	c
best	c
friend	c
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
declare	c
that	c
my	i
myself	i
and	c
my	c
fellow	c
students	c
will	c
be	c
available	c
to	c
help	c
to	i
this	c
short	c
video	c
by	i
all	i
means	i
.	c

As	c
far	c
as	c
some	i
further	c
information	c
you	c
need	c
from	c
me	c
is	c
concerned	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
glad	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
all	c
the	c
details	i
of	i
the	i
matter	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
on	i
July	c
;	c
that	c
is	c
for	c
me	c
the	c
only	c
possibility	c
because	c
I	c
will	c
finish	c
my	c
course	c
a	i
University	i
at	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
June	c
and	c
I	c
will	c
start	c
to	c
work	c
in	c
September	c
.	c

As	c
far	c
as	c
accomodtion	i
is	c
concerned	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
live	c
in	c
tents	i
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
.	c

As	c
I	c
am	c
an	c
athletic	c
swimmer	c
and	c
a	c
good	c
surfer	c
too	c
,	c
my	c
choice	c
from	c
your	c
attached	c
list	c
is	c
naturally	c
swimming	c
and	c
surfing	c
.	c

I	c
like	c
to	c
travel	i
with	i
light	i
logguage	i
and	c
I	c
have	c
no	c
idea	c
about	c
the	c
weather	c
;	c
could	c
you	c
suggest	c
me	i
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
have	i
to	i
bring	i
with	c
me	c
?	c

Yours	c
Sincerely	i

It	c
's	c
great	c
to	c
hearing	i
from	c
you	c
!	c

I	c
did	c
it	c
for	c
free	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
non-profit	c
concert	c
for	i
helping	i
the	c
poor	c
people	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
the	c
first	c
time	c
for	c
me	c
and	c
I	c
consider	c
this	c
experience	c
the	c
best	c
of	c
my	c
life	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
seeing	c
you	c
!	c

Dear	c
Madam	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

The	c
first	c
one	c
is	c
that	c
the	c
band	c
I	c
have	c
helped	c
,	c
although	c
it	c
has	c
n't	c
met	i
success	c
yet	c
,	c
is	c
really	c
good	c
.	c

I	c
already	c
know	c
them	c
,	i
I	c
have	c
even	c
helped	c
them	c
at	c
one	c
of	c
their	c
concert.	i
"	c

Moreover	c
,	c
the	c
work	c
I	i
've	i
had	i
to	c
do	c
,	c
apart	c
from	c
carrying	c
material	i
,	c
was	c
essentially	c
to	c
sell	c
tickets	c
for	c
the	c
concert	c
,	c
which	c
has	i
allowed	c
me	c
to	c
meet	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
nice	c
people	c
and	c
to	c
become	c
friend	i
with	c
some	c
of	c
them	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
very	c
happy	c
to	c
be	c
the	c
winner	c
from	i
your	c
competition	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
because	i
of	i
the	c
accommodation	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
be	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
spend	c
my	c
holidays	c
different	i
than	i
usually	i
.	c

I	c
used	i
to	i
be	i
a	c
member	c
in	i
a	c
swimming	c
club	c
for	c
about	c
10	c
years	c
.	c

Lastly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
if	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
money	c
with	c
me	c
,	c
for	i
example	i
for	i
the	i
food	i
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
shopping	c
is	c
like	c
relaxing	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
a	c
student	c
of	i
the	c
English	c
class	c
.	c

All	c
my	c
class	i
mates	i
are	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
go	i
to	c
London	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
so	c
much	c
for	c
organising	c
such	c
a	c
great	c
program	i
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c

Have	c
you	c
stayed	c
at	i
a	c
park	c
during	c
the	c
night	c
?	c

It	c
was	c
the	c
very	c
last	c
day	c
of	c
my	c
trip	c
and	c
at	c
that	c
time	c
I	c
was	c
in	c
Kyoto	c
.	c

Inside	c
the	c
dark	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
alone	c
and	c
only	c
the	c
moon	i
light	i
helped	c
me	c
to	c
see	c
the	i
things	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
regretting	c
I	i
risked	i
staying	c
at	i
the	c
park	c
alone	c
.	c

I	c
recently	c
had	c
a	c
week	c
's	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
and	c
during	c
my	c
stay	c
,	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
to	c
see	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
.	c

The	c
actor	c
was	c
somebody	c
else	c
and	c
this	c
was	c
something	i
disappointing	c
.	c

The	c
show	c
should	c
have	c
started	c
at	c
19:30	c
but	c
,	i
it	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
.	c

In	c
winter	c
,	c
they	c
used	c
to	c
fire	i
some	c
woods	i
to	c
keep	c
warm	c
,	i
"	c
Computer	c
"	c
was	c
a	c
word	c
that	c
nobody	c
had	i
known	i
the	c
meaning	c
of	c
it	i
.	c

Their	c
hobies	i
were	c
listening	c
to	c
the	c
radio	c
,	c
reading	c
books	c
or	c
sitting	c
on	c
a	c
chair	c
without	c
doing	c
anything	c
.	c

Modern	c
technology	c
has	c
changed	c
our	c
daily	c
life	c
a	c
lot	c
.	c

We	c
are	i
using	i
mobile	c
phones	c
so	c
it	c
does	c
n't	c
matter	c
if	c
we	c
are	c
in	c
a	c
crowded	c
city	c
or	c
on	i
a	c
desert	c
.	c

We	c
also	c
have	c
"	i
internet	i
"	i
,	c
by	i
which	c
you	c
can	c
learn	c
something	c
about	c
the	c
world	c
in	c
less	c
than	c
a	c
minute	c
.	c

When	c
you	c
look	c
around	c
,	c
you	c
can	c
easily	c
understand	c
that	c
modern	c
technology	c
is	c
used	c
in	i
everything	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
a	c
wonderful	c
time	c
at	c
the	c
International	c
Arts	c
Festival	c
.	c

There	c
were	c
stars	c
and	c
artists	c
from	c
only	c
six	c
countries	c
.	c

The	c
performances	c
were	c
great	c
,	c
but	c
some	c
halls	c
were	c
too	c
small	c
to	c
accomodate	i
so	i
many	i
people	c
there	i
were	i
that	c
day	c
.	c

The	c
special	c
tickets	c
were	c
excellent	c
because	c
we	c
could	c
enjoy	c
arts	i
without	c
worrying	c
about	c
money	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
very	c
good	c
considering	c
how	c
less	i
time	c
we	c
spend	c
on	c
it	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
about	c
3,000	c
yen	c
per	c
hour	c
in	c
my	c
district	c
.	c

Because	c
teaching	c
requires	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
knowledge	c
.	c

You	c
have	c
to	c
be	c
much	c
smarter	c
than	c
your	c
student	c
,	c
and	c
you	c
also	c
need	c
to	c
prepare	c
for	c
lessons	c
,	c
for	i
it	c
is	c
your	c
responsibility	c
to	c
provide	c
your	c
student	c
right	i
information	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
see	c
,	c
teaching	c
is	c
a	i
hard	c
work	c
in	c
some	c
respect	i
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
,	c

Yours	c
faithfully	i
,	c

I	c
had	c
to	c
react	c
!	c
...	c
otherwise	c
I	c
would	c
have	c
felt	c
responsible	c
for	c
his	c
death	c
,	c
for	c
the	c
rest	c
of	c
my	c
life	c
.	c

He	c
had	c
been	c
chained	c
and	c
no	c
way	c
could	c
he	c
escape	c
from	c
his	c
fate	c
without	c
some	c
help	c
!	c

No	c
one	c
was	c
garding	i
him	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
the	c
concerts	c
are	i
fantastic	c
,	c
especially	c
rock	i
concerts	c
.	c

I	c
saw	c
that	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
people	c
were	c
unsatisfied	c
.	c

I	c
saw	c
only	c
2	c
plays	c
and	c
3	c
films	c
.	c

This	c
is	c
excellent	i
idea	c
because	c
during	c
the	c
week	c
people	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
too	c
much	c
time	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
festival	c
.	c

Yours	i
faithfully	i

Dear	c
Annabel	c

I	c
have	i
examinations	c
,	c
but	c
now	c
I	c
have	c
plenty	c
of	c
time	c
and	c
I	c
can	c
write	c
a	c
letter	c
to	c
you	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
they	c
are	c
the	c
same	c
as	c
yours	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
'm	c
not	c
sure	i
at	i
100	i
per	i
cent	i
so	c
I	c
vrite	i
:	i

Rules	i
at	c
school	c
are	c
:	c
we	c
must	c
be	c
on	c
time	c
at	i
lessons	c
,	c
always	i
have	i
make	i
homework	i
.	c

If	c
someone	c
is	c
ill	c
must	i
bring	c
a	c
paper	i
from	c
a	c
doctor	c
.	c

And	c
the	c
main	c
rule	c
is	c
that	c
everyone	c
must	c
be	c
nice	c
to	c
teachers	i
At	i
home	c
I	c
must	c
clean	c
my	c
room	c
and	c
vacuuming	i
home	i
.	c

They	c
want	c
too	c
much	c
forstudent	i
and	c
are	c
unkindly	i
for	i
them	c
.	c

That	c
's	c
all	c
,	i
I	c
hope	c
that	c
I	c
give	i
you	c
answers	c
for	c
all	c
questions	i
you	c
have	i
.	c

Give	c
my	c
best	c
wishes	c
to	c
your	c
family	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
mind	c
staying	c
wherever	c
you	c
want	c
me	c
to	c
.	c

Please	c
,	c
do	c
n't	c
make	c
me	c
sing	c
or	c
paint	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
'm	c
not	c
very	c
keen	c
on	c
it	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Unforgetable	i

After	c

minutes	c
the	c
dream	c
happened	c

Kare	c

appeared	c
over	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
in	c
connection	c
with	c
the	c
competition	c
I	c
entered	c
a	c
month	c
ago	c
.	c

I	c
received	c
your	c
letter	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
delighted	c
to	c
know	c
that	c
I	c
won	c
it	c

I	c
would	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
travel	c
only	c
after	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
my	c
exams	c
which	c
are	c
taking	c
place	c
in	c
June	c

So	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
July	c
would	c
suit	c
me	c
best	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
I	c
would	c
love	c
to	c
follow	i
the	c
photography	c
classes	c
eventhough	i
I	c
have	c
never	c
tried	c
to	c
take	c
a	c
picture	c
before	c

I	c
hope	c
I	c
gave	i
you	c
all	c
the	c
information	c
you	c
needed	c
.	c

From	c
my	c
part	i
,	c
I	c
would	c
just	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
what	c
sort	c
of	c
clothes	c
should	i
I	i
bring	c
with	c
me	c
and	c
also	c
how	c
much	c
money	c

Thanking	c

enquiries	i

Dear	c
Kim	c

I	c
've	c
done	c
so	c
many	c
thinks	i
and	i
between	i
them	i
I	c
went	c
to	c
Glastonbery	c
(	c
as	c
you	c
know	c
)	c
!	c

It	i
lasted	c
three	c
days	c
and	c
I	i
've	i
had	i
the	c
best	c
fun	c
of	c
my	c
life	c
.	c

I	c
went	c
as	c
a	c
voluntier	i
staff	i
in	c
order	c
to	c
go	c
for	c
free	c
.	c

Oh	c
my	c
God	c
!	c
!	c
!	c

It	c
has	i
been	i
the	c
best	c
experience	c
you	c
can	c
Imagine	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
glad	c
to	c
hear	c
that	i
I	i
have	i
won	i
the	i
first	i
prize	i
from	i
you	i
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
afraid	c
that	c
I	c
am	c
just	i
available	c
to	c
travel	c
only	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
difficult	c
to	c
get	c
my	i
own	i
holiday	c
from	c
my	c
work	c
a	i
the	c
moment	c
.	c

I	c
prefer	c
staying	c
in	c
tents	c
to	c
log	c
cabins	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
really	c
been	c
interested	c
in	c
making	c
tents	c
and	c
staying	c
there	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
more	c
about	c
clothes	c
and	c
money	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
be	c
grateful	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
send	c
me	c
some	c
information	c
of	i
them	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
in	c
the	c
near	c
future	c
.	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

Last	c
month	c
,	c
I	c
helped	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
by	c
chance	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
invite	c
you	c
to	c
their	c
next	c
concert	c
and	c
share	c
my	c
experience	c
with	c
you	c
.	c

So	c
if	c
I	c
have	c
this	c
opportunity	c
,	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
want	c
to	c
fail	i
it	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
photograph	i
too	i
.	c

Could	c
you	c
send	c
me	c
more	c
informations	i
about	c
clothes	i
to	c
take	c
with	c
?	i

Hello	c
Kim	c
,	c

After	c
the	c
concert	c
,	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
eat	c
with	c
them	c
in	c
a	c
restaurant	c
near	c
the	c
stadium	c
,	i
where	c
they	c
had	c
played	c
.	c

What	c
I	c
particularly	c
liked	c
about	c
this	c
experience	c
is	c
that	c
I	c
saw	c
that	c
famous	c
people	c
are	c
like	c
us	c
and	c
have	c
the	c
same	c
interest	i
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
this	c
experience	c
is	c
something	c
that	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
live	c
too	c
.	c

Perhaps	c
in	i
the	c
next	c
concert	c
we	c
will	c
go	c
together	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
will	c
answer	c
my	c
letter	c
and	c
say	i
me	c
if	c
you	c
are	c
interesting	i
in	c
my	c
proposition	c
.	c

Charles	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
was	c
delighted	c
to	c
heard	i
that	c
I	c
won	c
the	c
prize	c
for	i
two	c
week	i
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
in	c
the	c
U.S.A	c
.	c

The	c
last	c
reason	c
I	i
love	c
to	c
watch	c
basketball	c
and	c
my	c
favourite	c
team	c
was	i
Chicago	c
also	c
my	c
favourite	c
player	c
was	i
Michael	c
Jordan	c
!	c

Do	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
take	c
a	i
special	c
clothes	c
such	i
as	c
,	i
warn	i
clothes	c
,	i
jumper	i
.	c

It	i
would	c
be	c
very	c
grateful	c
for	i
you	c
to	i
give	i
me	c
more	c
details	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c
.	c

I	c
looking	i
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c

I	c
have	c
n't	c
heard	c
from	c
you	c
for	c
such	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
n't	c
written	c
to	c
you	c
since	i
last	i
two	c
months	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
very	c
busy	c
to	i
helped	i
and	c
organizing	c
the	c
pop	c
concert	c
which	c
took	c
place	c
near	c
my	c
town	c
.	c

What	c
I	c
liked	c
most	c
about	c
my	c
experienced	i
from	i
the	c
concert	c
was	c
a	i
great	c
atmosphere	c
behind	c
the	c
state	i
and	c
live	i
music	c
made	i
me	c
felt	i
great	c
and	c
happy	c
,	i
what	i
's	i
more	c
,	c
I	c
have	i
opportunity	i
to	c
meet	c
a	c
singer	c
who	c
I	c
loved	i
and	c
I	c
dream	c
about	c
.	c

I	c
'll	c
show	c
you	c
when	c
you	c
come	c
around	c
to	c
see	c
me	c
.	c

Write	c
to	c
me	c
soon	c
when	c
you	c
have	c
time	c
.	c

Give	c
my	c
regards	c
to	c
our	c
parents	c
.	c

Take	c
care	c
!	c

I	c
saw	c
your	c
advertisement	c
yesterday	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
there	c
were	c
any	i
different	c
actor	i
.	c

I	c
was	c
disappointed	c
.	c

The	c
other	c
point	c
is	c
that	c
the	c
organization	c
was	c
very	c
bad	c
.	c

It	c
is	i
false	i
,	i
I	c
have	i
paid	i
twenty	c
pounds	c
.	c

What	i
other	i
I	c
would	c
like	c
ask	i
is	c
that	i
why	c
it	c
is	c
said	c
this	c
is	c
the	i
London	c
's	c
newest	c
and	c
best	c
musical	c
show	c
.	c

And	c
I	c
was	c
invited	c
to	c
visit	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

Finally	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
the	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
World	i
can	i
not	i
do	c
without	c
it	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
mention	c
is	i
that	c
in	c
our	c
daily	c
life	c
we	c
always	c
use	c
some	c
technological	c
machines	i
.	c

Without	c
doubt	c
,	c
discovering	i
of	c
the	c
computer	c
is	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
technological	c
event	c
.	c

Almost	c
everything	c
is	c
connected	i
to	i
the	i
computers	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
education	c
,	c
researching	i
of	i
the	c
Universe	i
and	c
others	i
.	c

What	i
other	c
I	i
would	c
like	c
to	c
mention	c
how	i
important	c
the	i
modern	c
technology	c
is	c
.	i

We	c
research	i
our	c
plant	i
,	c
other	c
planets	c
and	c
many	c
other	c
things	c
with	c
the	i
help	i
of	i
it	i
.	c

Finally	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
at	c
the	i
present	c
the	i
life	c
is	c
more	c
comfortable	c
.	i

The	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c

17th	c
Jun	c
2000	c

When	c
I	c
asked	c
something	i
about	i
"	i
discount	i
"	i
,	i
your	i
staf	i
said	i
that	i
it	i
is	i
impossible	i
.	c

We	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
bulding	i
at	c
18:30	c
.	c

We	c
were	c
really	c
angry	c
.	c

If	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
does	c
not	c
play	i
,	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
say	c
something	c
about	c
this	c
to	c
people	i
who	c
there	i
are	i
in	c
the	c
theater	i
This	i
is	c
your	c
unforgiven	i
mistake	c
.	c

After	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
w	i
were	c
still	c
angry	c
,	i
we	i
wanted	c
to	c
eat	c
something	c
in	c
your	c
theater	i
restaurant	c
.	c

We	c
were	c
hungry	c
and	c
angry	c
in	i
this	c
time	c
.	c

We	c
were	c
bored	c
to	i
waiting	c
.	c

But	c
we	c
could	c
n't	c
eat	c
something	i
and	c
we	c
could	c
n't	c
use	i
discount	i
.	c

Thanks	c
for	c
reading	c
this	c
letter	c

When	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
school	c
,	c
I	c
wrote	c
a	c
letter	c
to	c
my	c
friends	c
.	c

I	c
miss	c
to	i
wait	i
the	i
postman	c
every	c
morning	c
.	c

Before	c
we	c
had	c
a	c
computer	c
,	c
I	c
played	c
game	i
with	c
my	c
friends	c
in	c
our	c
garden	c
or	c
in	c
their	c
garden	c
.	c

When	c
we	c
had	c
a	c
computer	c
,	c
I	c
started	c
to	c
play	c
computer	c
games	c
.	c

I	c
did	c
n't	c
want	c
to	c
play	c
outside	i
games	i
with	c
my	c
friends	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
buy	c
newspaper	i
.	c

I	c
can	c
buy	c
something	i
from	i
internet	i
.	c

Everthing	i
is	c
easy	c
now	c
.	c

Sometimes	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
go	c
to	i
somewhere	c
without	c
technology	c
.	c

I	c
felt	c
very	c
upset	c
and	c
my	c
enjoyable	c
night	c
became	c
a	c
stressed	i
and	i
very	c
expensive	c
one	c
,	c
too	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
your	c
reply	c

faithfuly	i
,	c

Despite	c
of	i
the	c
distances	c
,	c
we	c
can	c
keep	c
our	c
friendship	c
closely	i
and	c
with	i
a	c
cheaply	i
way	c
.	c

Dear	c
sir	i
,	c

Unfortunately	c
that	c
evening	c
was	c
n't	c
as	c
good	c
as	c
I	c
expected	c
.	c

And	c
I	c
was	c
so	c
excited	c
about	c
it	c
!	c

But	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
disappointed	c
when	c
I	c
realised	c
that	c
another	c
actor	c
was	c
taking	c
part	i
.	c

And	c
the	c
worst	c
was	i
that	c
he	c
was	c
n't	c
so	c
good	c
in	c
his	i
role	c
!	c

Another	c
thing	c
was	c
that	c
the	c
show	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
was	c
starting	i
at	c
19:30	c
but	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
!	c

But	c
when	c
I	c
went	c
there	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

Well	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
and	c
I	c
ask	i
for	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

I	i
'll	i
wait	i
to	c
hear	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
...	i

So	c
,	c
the	c
next	c
day	c
Pat	c
went	c
and	c
told	c
to	i
his	c
sister	c
Sally	c
that	c
her	c
friends	c
were	c
organising	c
a	c
suprise	i
party	c
for	c
her	c
birthday	c
.	c

But	c
because	c
she	c
did	c
n't	c
want	c
to	c
disappoint	c
her	c
friends	c
,	c
she	c
was	c
acting	c
as	c
she	i
did	c
n't	c
know	c
anything	c
.	c

When	c
that	c
day	c
arrived	c
they	c
all	c
went	c
there	c
as	c
they	c
planned	i
.	c

After	c
a	c
while	c
the	i
bell	c
rang	c
.	c

Suddenly	c
they	c
all	c
shouted	c
"	c
suprise	i
!	c
"	c
.	c

Sally	c
although	i
she	c
knew	c
it	i
,	c
she	i
seemed	c
very	c
suprised	i
!	c

So	c
her	c
friends	c
did	c
n't	c
understand	i
that	c
she	c
knew	c
about	c
the	c
party	c
and	c
they	c
were	c
very	c
happy	c
because	c
they	c
believed	c
that	c
the	c
suprise	i
party	c
had	c
succeed	i
!	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complaine	i
about	c
the	c
evening	c
at	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
presenting	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
.	c

What	c
's	c
more	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
for	c
some	c
reasons	c
and	c
we	c
could	c
n't	c
get	c
anything	c
to	c
drink	c
or	c
eat	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

If	c
humans	c
turn	i
to	c
be	c
more	c
free	c
from	c
social	c
rules	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
their	c
dressing	i
will	c
also	c
be	c
very	c
extreme	c
and	c
unlimited	c
.	c

There	c
will	c
be	c
a	c
variety	c
of	c
colours	c
and	c
fashion	c
styles	c
.	c

Everybody	c
will	c
wear	c
anything	c
he/she	c
likes	c
,	c
choosing	c
clothes	c
from	c
any	c
century	c
they	c
wishe	i
without	c
this	c
being	c
strange	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
if	c
human	c
society	c
turns	i
to	c
be	i
stricher	i
and	c
more	c
limited	c
,	c
there	c
will	c
be	c
only	c
2	c
or	c
3	c
types	c
of	c
clothing	c
,	c
formed	c
by	c
the	c
needs	c
of	c
the	i
society	c
.	c

Perhaps	c
the	c
style	c
of	c
their	c
dressing	i
will	c
indicate	c
their	c
position	c
in	c
society	c
too	c
.	c

This	c
is	c
how	i
I	c
think	c
fashion	i
of	c
the	c
future	c
will	c
be	c
like	c
.	c

A	c
few	c
weeks	c
ago	c
,	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
London	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
and	c
see	c
a	c
musical	c
show	i
,	c
called	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow.	c
"	c

First	c
,	c
I	c
got	c
there	c
at	c
7:00	c
pm	c
,	c
because	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
about	c
to	c
start	c
at	c
7:30	c
pm	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
need	i
some	c
time	c
to	c
by	i
the	c
tickets	c
,	i
I	c
by	i
two	c
tickets	c
of	i
£	c
20	c
and	c
when	c
I	c
ask	i
for	c
a	c
discount	c
,	c
they	c
did	c
n't	c
give	i
it	i
to	i
me	i
,	c
then	c
I	c
keep	i
waiting	c
for	c
the	c
show	c
to	c
start	c
untill	i
8:15	c
pm	c
.	c

Then	c
when	c
the	c
show	c
finally	c
started	c
I	c
got	i
very	c
disappointed	c
because	c
,	i
I	c
really	c
wanted	c
to	c
see	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
but	c
instead	c
of	c
him	c
there	c
was	c
any	i
other	i
actor	c
.	c

But	c
this	c
time	c
it	c
was	c
something	c
more	c
important	c
that	i
any	c
other	c
time	c
.	c

We	c
both	c
decided	c
to	c
finish	c
with	c
all	i
this	c
stupid	c
affair	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
difficult	c
,	c
but	c
I	i
was	c
the	c
best	c
for	c
everyone	c
.	c

Manager	c
Date	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

It	c
is	c
always	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
to	c
enjoy	c
a	c
musical	c
when	c
you	c
go	c
on	c
your	i
holiday	c
to	c
London	c
.	c

Rescently	i
I	c
decided	c
to	c
watch	i
Over	c
The	c
Rainbow	c
,	c
a	c
very	c
famous	c
and	c
wellknown	i
show	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
shooked	i
when	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
main	c
persons	i
entered	i
the	c
stage	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
receiving	c
you	i
reply	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possibly	i
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

In	c
nearly	c
every	c
home	c
you	c
can	c
find	c
it	i
and	c
the	c
users	c
now	c
and	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
are	c
the	c
new	c
generation	c
.	c

Another	c
actor	c
standed	i
for	i
him	c
,	c
without	c
any	c
advice	i
.	c

Another	c
thing	c
was	c
the	c
confirmed	i
hour	i
of	c
the	c
show	c
which	i
it	c
started	c
forty-five	c
minutes	c
later	i
without	c
any	c
factual	i
reason	c
.	i

At	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
all	c
these	c
circumstances	i
we	i
were	c
so	c
puzzled	c
and	c
disappointed	c
that	c
we	c
decided	c
to	c
make	c
a	c
complaint	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
and	i
as	i
a	i
conclusion	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
this	c
development	c
has	c
made	c
my	c
life	c
more	c
comfortable	c
living	i
sourrended	i
by	i
lots	i
of	i
gadgets	i
with	i
differents	i
functions	i
.	c

In	c
the	c
advertisment	i
for	c
the	c
show	c
you	c
said	c
that	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
starring	i
was	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
and	c
to	c
my	c
surprise	c
it	i
was	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
,	c
and	c
it	i
realy	i
disapoint	i
me	c
.	c

And	c
the	c
restorant	i
of	i
the	i
theatre	i
was	c
being	c
pait	i
,	c
so	c
I	c
could	c
not	c
go	c
as	i
you	i
said	i
in	i
the	i
advertisment	i
.	c

It	c
change	i
every	c
days	i
and	c
I	c
do	c
not	c
know	c
if	c
we	c
will	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
understand	c
it	c
.	c

Tecnology	i
improves	c
our	c
lives	c
,	c
we	c
have	c
tecnology	i
for	c
cook	i
,	c
for	c
work	c
,	c
for	c
study	c
,	c
well	c
hardly	i
for	c
everything	c
.	c

and	i
now	c
of	c
courese	i
there	c
will	c
someone	i
trying	c
to	c
improve	c
it	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
organising	c
the	c
school	c
trip	c
in	i
London	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
really	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
participating	c
in	c
the	c
programme	c
,	c
especially	c
the	c
visit	c
to	c
the	c
National	c
Art	c
Gallery	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
make	c
a	c
suggestion	c
about	c
the	c
trip	c
on	c
behalf	c
of	c
all	c
the	c
students	c
in	c
my	c
class	c
.	c

I	c
believe	c
that	c
famous	c
people	c
,	c
such	c
as	c
politicians	c
and	c
film	c
stars	c
,	c
deserve	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
private	c
life	c
without	c
journalists	c
following	c
them	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
for	c
some	c
reasons	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
they	c
mix	c
them	c
up	c
and	c
that	c
they	c
should	c
think	c
about	c
the	c
right	c
of	i
privacy	c
.	c

Therefore	c
,	c
I	c
strongly	c
believe	c
that	c
famous	c
people	c
deserve	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
private	c
life	c
without	c
journalists	c
following	c
them	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
nobody	c
told	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
you	c
would	i
have	i
to	i
take	i
it	i
into	i
consideration	i
to	c
avoid	c
it	c
happens	i
again	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

I	c
explained	i
her	c
everything	c
it	i
happened	c
to	c
me	c
and	c
vice	c
versa	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
at	c
a	c
loss	c
.	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
,	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
glad	c
to	c
receive	c
this	c
great	c
notice	i
.	c

In	c
your	c
letter	c
you	c
asked	c
me	c
when	c
I	c
would	c
rather	i
travel	i
,	i
I	c
will	c
be	c
able	c
only	i
on	i
July	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
work	c
and	c
I	c
can	c
take	c
some	c
days	c
off	c
on	i
this	i
month	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
if	c
there	c
is	c
any	c
place	c
where	c
I	c
can	c
buy	c
some	c
souvenirs	c
,	c
so	i
to	i
take	c
some	c
money	c
with	c
me	c
and	i
I	c
would	c
be	c
very	c
grateful	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
send	c
me	c
a	c
list	c
of	c
clothes	c
.	c

The	c
long	c
queues	c
,	c
close	i
places	c
,	c
hight	i
prices	c
,	c
sales	c
,	c
all	c
these	c
things	c
conbined	i
could	c
make	c
shopping	c
an	c
enjoyable	c
thing	c
for	c
people	c
who	c
like	c
doing	c
it	c
.	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c

In	i
other	i
hand	i
,	c
after	c
shopping	c
you	c
'll	c
get	c
tired	c
and	c
maybe	c
you	c
ca	c
n't	c
afford	c
your	c
credit	c
card	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
shopping	c
has	c
pros	c
and	c
cons	c
,	i
it	i
depends	c
on	c
personal	c
thinking	i
.	c

I	c
enjoy	c
shopping	c
very	c
much	c
,	i
it	i
can	c
let	i
me	c
know	c
what	c
's	c
going	c
on	c
in	c
the	c
world	c
.	c

But	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
good	c
idea	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
break	c
during	c
the	c
shopping	c
,	i
you	i
wo	c
n't	c
feel	c
so	c
tired	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
with	i
reference	i
to	i
the	c
competition	c
.	c

The	c
main	c
reason	c
is	c
that	c
I	c
love	c
wood	c
.	c

Although	c
I	c
have	c
played	c
tennis	c
only	c
twice	c
,	c
I	c
really	c
enjoyed	c
it	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
I	c
once	c
have	i
been	i
trained	i
in	c
a	c
swimming	c
centre	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
am	c
quite	c
confident	c
with	i
it	i
.	c

Lastly	c
,	c
could	c
you	c
please	c
tell	c
me	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
and	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
should	c
prepare	i
and	c
do	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
buy	c
insurance	c
myself	c
?	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

As	c
far	c
as	c
I	c
know	c
,	c
English	c
people	c
are	c
really	c
surprised	c
about	i
Chinese	i
students	c
'	c
advanced	c
level	c
in	c
Maths	c
,	c
as	c
well	c
as	c
the	i
knowledge	c
in	i
politics	c
.	c

This	c
is	c
a	c
good	c
oppertunate	i
to	c
see	c
how	c
they	c
learn	c
in	c
class	c
.	c

You	c
will	c
experience	c
a	c
different	c
life	c
in	c
them	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
was	c
n't	c
the	c
leading	c
actor	c
,	c
though	c
his	c
name	c
was	c
printed	c
on	c
the	c
brochure	i
.	c

I	c
was	c
angry	c
because	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
instead	c
of	c
19.30	c
,	c
too	c
.	c

Thanks	c
to	c
you	c
,	c
I	c
've	c
had	c
the	c
most	c
dreadful	c
experience	c
of	c
my	c
life	c
.	c

Neither	c
do	c
I.	c
In	c
particular	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
talk	c
about	c
Internet	i
.	c

Therefore	c
I	c
regard	c
Internet	i
as	c
a	i
quite	i
powerful	c
tool	c
and	c
I	c
believe	c
it	c
has	c
given	c
more	c
strenght	i
to	c
relations	i
among	i
people	c
.	c

I	c
can	c
say	c
such	c
things	c
because	c
I	c
use	c
the	c
net	c
in	c
the	c
same	c
way	c
and	c
I	c
'm	c
really	c
astounded	c
by	c
its	i
way	c
of	i
changing	i
my	c
daily	c
life	c
.	c

13th	c
JUNE	c
2000	c

I	c
am	c
really	c
glad	c
for	i
reciving	i
the	c
first	c
priec	i
in	c
your	c
competition	c
,	i
I	i
will	c
be	c
very	c
plesant	i
joining	i
the	i
holliday	i
.	c

According	i
to	i
your	c
first	c
question	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
only	c
at	i
July	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
my	c
school	c
holliday	i
so	c
I	c
would	c
not	c
miss	c
any	c
class	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
about	c
somethings	i
which	c
might	c
be	c
necessary	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
take	c
with	c
,	i
like	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
should	c
I	c
take	c
,	c
should	c
I	c
take	c
my	c
own	c
surf	i
board	i
,	c
and	c
what	c
about	c
money	c
,	c
should	c
I	c
bring	c
some	c
with	c
me	c
?	c

When	c
the	c
band	c
had	c
just	c
started	c
to	c
play	c
,	c
lots	c
of	c
girls	c
started	c
to	c
jump	c
the	c
faints	i
getting	c
very	c
close	c
to	c
them	c
,	i
some	i
of	c
the	c
girls	c
started	c
to	c
take	c
their	c
clothes	c
of	i
,	c
which	c
was	c
the	c
best	c
part	c
for	c
me	c
,	c
but	c
some	c
of	c
securities	i
went	c
there	c
and	c
took	c
them	c
away	c
.	c

See	c
yah	c
mate	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
a	c
few	c
questions	c
:	c

What	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
should	c
I	c
bring	c
?	c

Faithfully	c
Yours	i
,	c

Sometimes	c
the	c
seller	i
might	c
even	c
ignore	c
you	c
as	c
he	c
or	c
she	c
is	c
talking	c
to	c
another	c
sellor	i
.	c

All	c
this	c
to	i
say	c
that	c
shopping	c
may	c
seem	c
enjoyable	c
but	c
often	c
is	c
not	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
when	c
we	c
arrived	c
we	c
went	c
to	c
pay	c
and	c
we	c
gave	c
a	i
discount	c
ticket	c
.	c

It	c
had	i
not	i
been	c
such	c
a	c
terrible	c
thing	c
if	c
the	c
new	c
actor	c
would	i
have	i
acted	c
as	c
well	c
as	c
the	c
other	c
one	c
.	c

We	c
knew	c
that	c
our	c
parents	c
would	c
n't	c
let	c
us	c
to	i
travel	i
alone	c
so	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
invent	c
a	c
story	c
to	c
avoid	c
they	i
could	i
realize	i
what	c
happened	i
.	c

We	c
booked	c
some	c
rooms	c
in	c
a	c
hotel	c
,	c
next	c
to	c
the	c
beach	c
and	i
we	c
bought	c
all	c
the	c
useful	c
things	c
we	c
were	c
going	c
to	c
need	c
.	c

Jon	c
told	c
my	c
parents	c
what	c
we	c
wanted	c
to	c
do	c
.	c

For	c
accommodation	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
I	c
prefer	c
tents	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
use	i
to	c
go	i
tents	i
holidays	i
,	i
I	c
like	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
good	c
in	i
swimming	c
.	c

It	i
is	i
all	i
about	i
me	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
something	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
like	c
to	c
have	c
many	c
things	c
in	c
my	c
house	c
,	i
I	c
do	c
n't	c
like	c
to	c
have	c
many	c
clothes	c
and	c
shoes	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
what	c
else	c
.	c

Just	c
nesseccary	i
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
we	c
must	c
spend	c
more	c
time	c
for	i
more	c
interesting	c
than	i
shopping	i
things	i
like	i
sport	c
,	c
reading	c
,	c
chating	i
about	c
ideas	c
which	c
make	c
our	c
lives	c
better	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
a	c
wonderful	c
surprise	c
.	c

For	c
the	c
two	c
activities	c
I	c
can	c
choose	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
play	c
tennis	c
:	c
I	c
have	c
some	c
experience	c
in	i
this	c
sport	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
played	c
tennis	c
during	i
seven	c
years	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
still	c
my	c
favourite	c
activity	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
try	c
to	c
do	c
some	c
painting	c
,	c
too	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
painted	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
what	c
sort	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
(	c
if	c
it	c
is	c
going	c
to	c
rainy	i
or	c
to	i
be	i
sunny	c
)	c
and	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
must	c
have	c
with	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
cooked	c
a	c
meal	c
for	c
the	c
artists	c
,	c
I	c
spoke	c
with	c
the	c
manager	i
of	i
Bruce	i
Springsteen	i
and	c
I	c
helped	c
a	c
technician	c
to	c
install	c
his	c
material	i
:	c
the	c
lights	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
excited	c
,	c
because	c
this	c
is	c
my	c
favourite	c
group	c
:	c
I	c
'm	c
always	c
hearing	i
their	i
songs	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
playing	i
guitar	c
like	c
him	c
.	c

The	c
next	c
concert	c
is	c
on	c
19th	c
June	c
and	c
I	c
will	c
be	c

Otherwise	c
I	c
will	c
not	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
travel	c
abroad	c

I	c
came	c
second	c
last	i
year	c

competition	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
enrolled	c
photography	i
classes	c

However	c
this	i
term	c
has	c
been	c
a	c
far	c
cry	c
from	c
the	c
others	c

She	c
invited	c
me	c
to	c
the	c
rehearsal	c
of	c
a	c
huge	c

well	c
as	c
my	c
favorite	i

It	c
should	c
has	i
been	c
my	c
best	c
evening	c
that	c
week	c

unfortunatly	i
it	c
was	c
n't	c

When	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
was	c
not	c
acting	c
,	c
witch	i
was	c
a	c
great	c
dissapointment	i
for	c
us	c
both	c

When	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
finished	c
we	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
resturant	i

have	c
something	c
to	c
eat	c

We	c
both	c
have	i

Yours	c
Mrs	c
Anna	c
Schulsson	c

She	c
was	c
my	c
best	c
friend	c
for	c
several	c
years	c
as	c
a	c
child	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
have	c
n't	c
seen	c
her	c
since	c
we	c
were	c
10	c
years	c
old	c
.	c

One	c
minute	c
later	c
,	c
Pat	c
and	c
half	c
our	c
classe	i
stod	i
in	c
'	c
the	c
House	c
'	c
looking	c
and	c
laufing	i
at	c
me	c
and	c
my	c
flower	c
soup	c
.	c

According	i
to	i
the	c
advertisement	c
,	c
which	c
appeared	c
in	c
one	c
of	c
the	i
London	c
's	c
newspapers	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
present	c
you	c
some	i
of	c
my	c
complaines	i
about	c
your	c
musical	c
spectacle	c
.	c

The	c
man	c
who	c
played	c
the	c
main	c
male	c
role	c
was	c
different	i
than	i
this	i
one	i
,	i
who	c
was	c
mentioned	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
.	c

For	c
unknown	c
for	i
me	i
reasons	c
,	c
I	c
found	c
the	c
restaurant	c
closed	c
(	c
there	c
was	c
no	c
information	c
telling	i
about	i
a	c
cause	i
of	i
closing	c
it	c
)	c
.	c

Technology	c
is	c
very	c
important	c
in	c
our	c
life	c
.	c

Mainly	c
,	c
because	c
it	c
makes	c
it	c
easier	c
and	c
more	c
comfortable	c
.	c

Nevertheless	c
it	i
has	c
some	c
advantages	c
and	c
drawbacks	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
my	i
daily	c
life	c
is	c
full	c
of	c
modern	c
technology	c
.	c

I	c
can	c
do	c
my	c
homework	c
on	c
computer	i
,	c
prepare	c
for	c
the	c
class	c
test	c
by	c
searching	c
information	i
in	i
Internet	i
and	c
use	c
a	c
mobile	c
phone	c
every	c
time	c
when	i
I	c
want	c
to	c
connect	i
with	c
one	c
of	c
my	c
parents	c
.	c

Then	c
we	c
will	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
technology	c
is	c
something	c
we	c
should	c
be	c
proud	c
of	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
just	c
received	c
your	c
letter	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
glad	c
to	c
know	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
if	c
you	c
have	c
some	c
vacancies	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
the	c
only	c
month	c
where	c
I	c
am	c
in	i
holidays	i
.	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
you	c
asked	c
me	c
to	c
choise	i
two	c
activities	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
do	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
happy	c
to	c
play	c
tennis	c
because	c
I	c
used	c
to	c
play	i
this	c
sport	c
with	c
my	c
village	c
club	c
for	i
five	i
years	i
and	c
earned	i
a	c
few	c
competitions	c
.	c

We	c
had	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
fun	c
during	c
our	c
last	c
holidays	i
and	c
we	c
took	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
pictures	c
.	c

And	c
nowadays	c
people	c
must	c
do	i
shopping	c
either	i
they	c
like	c
it	c
or	c
not	c
.	c

For	c
people	c
who	c
used	i
to	i
do	i
shopping	c
,	c
going	c
in	c
big	c
stores	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
they	c
like	c
it	c
and	c
they	i
are	c
always	c
looking	c
for	c
fashioned-clothes	i
.	c

But	c
when	c
these	c
stores	c
are	c
full	c
of	c
people	c
,	c
crowded	c
,	c
like	c
the	i
sales	c
period	i
,	c
I	c
am	c
sure	c
that	c
the	c
same	c
people	c
who	c
like	c
doing	i
shopping	c
may	c
think	c
it	c
can	i
be	i
boring	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
hopefull	i
that	c
I	c
was	c
going	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
good	c
time	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
have	i
had	i
no	c
discount	c
at	i
paying	i
.	c

I	c
could	c
n't	c
consentrate	i
on	c
the	c
play	c
any	c
more	c
.	c

I	c
regret	c
to	i
demand	c
all	c
my	c
expenses	i
.	i

I	c
hope	c
you	c
are	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
take	c
into	c
consideration	c
my	c
terrible	c
situation	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
waiting	c
for	c
a	c
satisfactory	c
answer	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

Technology	c
has	c
developed	c
increasingly	i
in	c
recent	c
years	c
.	c

These	c
days	c
we	c
can	c
use	c
computer	i
,	c
television	c
and	c
some	c
sophisticated	c
equipment	c
.	i

Technology	c
has	c
a	c
huge	c
effect	c
on	c
our	c
spare	i
time	i
activities	c
as	c
well	c
.	c

There	c
has	c
been	c
change	i
relatinships	i
between	c
people	c
.	c

If	c
we	c
want	c
to	c
leave	c
a	c
good	c
world	c
to	c
the	c
next	c
generations	c
,	c
we	c
should	c
behave	c
more	c
respectfully	c
againgst	i
the	i
nature	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
representing	c
an	c
English	c
class	c
,	c
which	c
is	c
going	c
on	c
a	c
three-day	c
London	c
tour	c
.	c

Our	c
students	c
will	c
have	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
of	i
seeing	i
the	c
latest	c
fashion	i
,	c
as	c
this	c
unique	c
show	c
is	c
held	c
only	c
once	c
a	c
year	c
.	c

And	c
apart	c
from	c
it	i
,	c
this	c
activity	i
is	c
free	c
of	c
charge	c
.	c

Faithfully	i
yours	c
,	c

Another	c
aspect	c
is	c
that	c
children	i
of	c
famous	c
people	c
suffer	c
a	c
lot	c
from	c
this	c
attention	c
.	c

And	c
it	c
tells	c
on	c
their	c
attitude	c
to	c
life	c
and	c
on	c
their	c
character	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
show	c
which	c
I	c
saw	c
last	c
Friday	c
at	c
your	c
theatre	c
.	c

The	c
show	c
was	c
called	c
'	c
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	i
'	c
I	i
was	c
not	c
pleased	c
with	c
the	c
way	c
that	c
was	i
set	i
out	i
.	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
the	c
original	i
actor	c
was	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
but	c
it	i
changed	i
to	i
a	i
different	i
actor	i
which	i
acted	c
terribly	c
and	c
was	c
very	c
disappointing	c
.	c

Last	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
it	c
said	i
in	c
your	c
advertisement	c
that	c
there	c
is	c
a	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
after	i
the	c
show	c
but	c
it	c
turned	c
out	c
to	c
be	c
closed	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
redecorating	i
and	c
no	c
annocement	i
was	c
made	c
.	c

What	c
will	c
clothes	c
be	c
like	c
100	c
years	c
from	c
now	c
?	c

What	c
do	c
you	c
think	c
modles	i
will	c
wear	c
in	i
cat	i
walks	i
?	c

In	i
my	i
opinion	i
,	i
I	i
think	i
clothes	c
will	c
be	c
a	c
lot	c
differente	i
100	i
years	i
later	i
compare	i
to	i
now	i
.	c

As	i
new	i
materials	c
are	i
made	i
and	c
new	c
styles	c
are	i
created	c
either	c
by	c
designers	c
or	c
people	c
themselves	c
which	i
leads	i
to	c
changes	c
in	c
fashion	c
but	i
on	i
the	i
other	i
hand	i
come	i
materials	c
will	c
probably	c
still	c
be	c
used	c
such	c
as	c
jeans	i
,	c
which	c
was	c
invented	c
ages	c
ago	c
in	c
America	c
.	c

and	i
people	c
nowadays	c
still	c
use	c
jeans	i
as	i
a	i
common	i
material	i
.	c

If	c
you	c
walk	c
out	c
to	i
the	c
street	c
now	c
,	c
you	c
will	c
probably	c
see	c
more	c
than	c
half	c
the	c
people	c
wearing	c
clothes	c
that	c
are	c
made	c
with	i
jeans	i
which	i
is	c
incredibly	c
surprising	c
!	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
this	c
letter	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
the	c
informations	i
you	c
need	c
and	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
one	c
or	c
two	c
questions	c
.	c

I	c
did	c
that	c
two	i
hours	c
,	i
this	i
first	c
job	c
was	c
sometimes	c
a	c
bit	c
boring	c
but	c
I	c
felt	c
like	c
someone	c
who	c
save	i
people	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
was	c
really	c
happy	c
!	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
excited	c
when	c
I	c
could	c
see	c
a	c
star	c
!	c

See	c
you	c
soon	c

Dear	c
Mrs.	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
about	c
the	c
competition	c
you	c
organised	c
.	c

I	c
can	c
only	c
travel	c
to	c
California	c
this	c
July	c
because	c
it	i
will	c
be	c
my	i
winter	c
holidays	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
always	c
dreamed	c
about	c
going	c
camping	c
and	c
staying	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
.	c

Now	c
my	c
dream	c
will	c
finally	c
come	c
true	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
this	c
way	c
is	c
better	c
to	c
keep	c
in	c
touch	c
with	c
the	i
nature	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
do	c
photografy	i
and	c
swimming	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
learn	c
more	c
about	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
always	c
swam	i
and	c
I	c
can	c
say	c
I	c
'm	c
good	c
on	i
it	c
.	c

How	c
much	c
money	c
do	c
you	c
think	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
to	c
buy	c
food	c
and	c
anything	c
else	c
I	c
will	c
need	c
?	c

Raquel	c
Soares	c

Is	i
a	c
kind	c
of	c
relief	c
for	c
them	c
.	c

Specially	i
if	c
we	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
to	c
worry	c
about	c
money	c
.	c

But	c
,	c
sometimes	c
,	c
go	i
shopping	c
can	c
have	c
other	c
effects	c
on	c
you	c
.	c

And	c
,	c
a	c
really	c
bad	c
thing	c
is	c
,	c
after	c
buying	c
everything	c
you	c
wanted	c
and	c
feeling	c
very	c
happy	c
with	c
all	c
that	c
,	c
you	c
realize	c
that	c
you	c
spent	c
more	c
money	c
than	c
you	c
should	c
.	i

.	c
.	c

It	c
would	c
probably	c
be	c
better	c
if	c
you	c
just	c
go	i
shopping	c
when	c
you	c
really	c
need	i
and	c
,	c
to	c
relax	c
,	c
you	c
can	c
talk	c
to	c
a	c
friend	c
,	c
read	c
a	c
book	c
or	c
listen	c
to	c
good	c
music	c

Mrs.	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c

Dear	c
Madam	c

I	c
have	c
received	c
the	c
letter	c
which	c
tells	c
me	c
that	c
have	i
won	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
going	c
to	c
write	c
about	c
information	i
which	c
you	c
want	c
to	c
know	c
.	c

First	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
only	i
July	i
,	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
got	c
a	c
job	c
and	c
only	i
July	i
is	i
the	i
time	c
I	c
can	c
have	c
a	c
vacation	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
choose	c
a	c
tent	c
for	c
accommodation	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
spent	c
time	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
,	c
that	c
's	c
why	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
good	c
oppotunity	i
for	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
a	i
planty	i
of	c
experience	c
and	c
knowledge	c
of	c
both	c
aspect	i
of	i
part	i
.	c

Another	c
one	c
is	c
that	i
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
prepare	i
.	c

I	c
will	i
be	c
greatfull	i
if	c
you	c
could	c
inform	c
me	c
.	c

Your	i
sincerely	i

I	c
had	c
a	c
wonderful	c
time	c
last	c
month	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
n't	c
allowed	c
to	c
help	c
a	i
heavy	c
work	c
,	c
even	c
though	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
do	i
,	c
because	c
I	c
'm	c
woman	i
.	c

I	c
have	c
never	c
felt	c
such	c
as	i
satisfaction	c
.	c

Bye	c

Your	c
programme	c
looks	c
very	c
interesting	c
,	c
especially	c
the	c
River	c
Trip	c
to	c
Greenwich	c
,	c
which	c
I	c
always	i
dreamt	i
of	c
.	c

The	c
show	c
will	c
have	c
latest	i
fashions	c
from	c
top	i
fashion	c
designers	c
in	c
the	c
world	c
.	c

The	c
best	c
thing	c
is	c
that	c
it	c
is	c
free	c
because	c
we	c
are	c
students	c
.	c

We	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
whether	c
we	c
can	c
change	c
some	c
programme	i
.	c

We	c
wo	c
n't	c
miss	c
any	c
programme	i
that	c
you	c
have	c
planned	c
and	c
we	c
could	c
also	c
have	c
great	i
opportunity	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
their	c
story	i
always	c
make	c
them	c
embarras	i
because	c
most	c
of	c
the	c
journalists	c
create	c
their	c
own	c
story	c
base	i
on	c
the	c
true	c
story	c
just	c
to	c
get	c
attraction	i
from	i
people	i
.	c

However	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
starred	c
and	c
we	c
were	c
all	c
disappointed	c
.	c

What	c
is	c
more	c
,	c
about	c
the	c
tickets	c
,	c
discounts	c
were	c
not	c
available	c
as	i
it	i
was	i
not	i
said	i
so	i
.	c

The	c
last	c
disappointing	c
thing	c
is	c
that	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
so	c
we	c
could	c
not	c
visit	c
it	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

Therefore	c
,	c
if	c
avaliable	i
,	c
can	c
you	c
play	i
my	c
money	c
back	c
please	c
?	c

My	i
address	i
is	i
here	i
for	i
any	i
contacts	i
,	i

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

He	c
told	c
everything	c
that	c
Pandora	c
said	c
,	i
to	c
everyone	c
which	i
Pandora	c
did	c
n't	c
want	c
them	i
to	c
know	c
.	c

Pandora	c
had	c
done	c
something	c
very	c
bad	c
like	c
a	c
robbery	c
and	c
one	c
day	c
told	c
this	c
to	c
Pat	c
because	c
she	c
was	c
very	c
shy	i
and	c
regretful	c
.	c

Pat	c
was	c
her	c
best	c
friend	c
so	c
she	c
told	c
to	i
him	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
she	c
did	c
n't	c
know	c
that	c
Pat	c
could	c
n't	c
keep	c
secrets	c
well	c
.	c

All	c
of	c
them	c
were	c
schoked	i
by	c
what	c
they	c
heard	c
.	c

As	c
well	c
as	c
this	c
they	i
started	c
to	c
talk	c
about	c
it	c
everywhere	c
.	c

After	c
a	c
week	c
of	i
holiday	c
,	c
when	c
Pandora	c
returned	c
she	c
learned	c
that	c
every	i
of	c
her	c
friends	c
knew	c
that	i
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
she	c
could	c
n't	c
wait	c
and	c
wear	i
to	c
talk	c
to	c
Pat	c
.	c

Yesterday	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	i
play	c
called	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
which	i
I	c
saw	c
the	c
advertisement	c
in	c
todays	i
Guardian	c
.	c

Simple	c
Solutions	c

And	c
almost	c
everybody	c
has	c
a	c
television	c
in	c
their	c
homes	c
.	c

These	c
2	c
devices	c
make	c
my	c
life	c
easier	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
watch	c
Tv	i
at	c
home	c
instead	c
of	c
sitting	c
in	c
a	c
chair	c
looking	c
out	c
of	c
a	c
window	c
.	c

Internet	i
brought	i
a	c
new	c
way	i
to	c
my	c
live	i
since	c
I	c
started	c
to	c
use	c
it	c
.	c

Transportation	c
.	c

I	c
ca	i
n't	i
have	c
to	c
walk	c
to	c
school	c
everyday	i
for	c
8	c
months	c
,	i
Cars	c
,	c
busses	i
and	c
trains	c
are	c
very	c
useful	c
in	c
daily	c
life	c
.	c

Lots	c
of	c
thing	i
would	c
be	c
hard	c
and	c
boring	c
in	c
my	c
life	c
I	i
was	c
living	c
in	c
a	c
different	c
time	c
than	c
now	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
:	c

I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
your	c
'	c
Best	i
'	c
musical	c
show	c
that	i
I	c
went	c
to	c
when	c
I	i
'd	i
a	c
week	c
's	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

But	c
when	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
,	c
they	c
said	c
Danny	c
was	c
n't	c
there	c
because	c
of	c
his	c
illness	c
and	c
I	c
felt	c
very	c
upset	c
and	c
dismayed	c
about	c
it	c
because	c
the	c
situation	i
I	c
had	c
was	c
unlike	c
what	c
the	c
advertisement	c
said	i
.	c

After	c
the	c
boring	c
show	c
finished	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
hungry	c
and	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
but	c
the	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
after	c
19.00	c
.	c

So	c
what	c
's	c
the	c
point	c
to	i
say	i
'	c
visit	c
our	c
restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
'	c
?	c

Everyone	c
was	c
laughing	c
and	c
the	c
headmaster	c
's	c
face	c
was	c
full	c
of	c
anger	c
.	c

After	c
that	c
event	c
happened	i
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
Jon	c
and	c
Tim	c
's	c
enemy	c
.	c

They	c
do	i
hate	c
him	c
so	c
much	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
-	c
the	c
main	c
actor	c
in	c
this	c
musical	c
-	c
was	c
abbsend	i
.	c

You	c
also	c
offered	c
discounts	c
,	i
whot	i
kind	c
of	c
discounts	c
?	c

I	c
have	i
n't	i
seen	i
any	c
!	c

Becouse	i
the	c
show	c
was	c
very	c
long	c
,	c
we	c
were	c
getting	c
hungry	c
but	c
of	c
course	c
your	i
's	i
theatre	c
restaurants	i
was	c
closed	c
because	c
of	c
holiday	i
.	c

Waiting	c
for	c
you	i
replay	i
.	c

With	c
best	c
regards	c

The	c
stay	i
has	i
begaun	i
last	c
year	c
,	c
when	c
I	c
stated	i
my	c
summer	c
holiday	c
.	c

I	c
started	c
talking	i
with	i
my	c
parents	c
that	c
I	c
will	i
be	c
travelling	c
with	c
my	c
friends	c
through	c
West-Europe	i
for	c
one	c
month	c
.	c

The	c
reason	c
for	i
which	i
I	c
decided	c
to	c
write	c
you	c
a	c
letter	c
,	c
will	c
,	c
I	c
guess	c
,	c
surprise	c
you	c
.	c

It	i
was	c
very	c
excited	c
thinking	c
about	c
being	c
at	c
the	c
theatre	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
though	i
with	c
certainty	c
I	c
was	c
going	c
to	c
enjoy	c
my	c
evening	c
.	c

How	c
rude	c
!	c

Although	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
have	c
felt	c
better	c
if	c
I	c
had	c
had	c
a	c
discount	c
on	c
my	c
ticket	c
,	c
as	c
you	c
mentionned	i
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
,	c
but	c
unfortunately	c
,	c
these	c
could	c
n't	c
possibly	c
be	c
reached	i
either	c
!	c

I	c
guess	c
I	c
could	c
not	c
live	c
without	c
many	i
instruments	i
.	c

What	c
a	c
great	c
invention	c

By	i
this	c
procedure	c

Dear	c
SIR/MADAM	c
,	c
My	c
name	c
is	c
.	c

I	c
am	i
working	i
as	c
an	c
actor	c
for	c
The	c
Spanish	c
Royal	c
Theatre	c
.	c

But	c
from	c
the	c
beginning	c
we	c
found	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
problems	c
.	c

Nevertheless	c
we	c
decided	c
to	c
stay	c
there	i
till	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
the	c
show	c
and	c
to	c
take	i
dinner	c
in	c
your	c
restaurant	c
,	c
where	c
we	c
were	c
supposed	c
to	c
meet	c
some	c
friends	c
;	c
friends	c
that	c
we	c
never	c
met	c
because	c
your	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
when	c
we	c
got	c
out	c
.	c

As	i
you	i
can	i
read	i
it	c
was	c
not	c
our	c
"	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
"	c
at	c
all	c
.	c

During	c
the	c
winter	c
,	c
when	c
it	c
is	c
raining	c
,	c
you	c
can	c
have	c
your	c
clothes	c
dry	c
in	c
less	c
that	i
thirty	c
minutes	c
.	c

The	c
computer	c
allows	c
me	c
to	c
change	c
my	c
ideas	c
without	c
any	c
effort	c
and	c
to	c
store	c
a	c
big	i
amount	c
of	c
information	c
in	c
the	c
minimum	c
space	c
.	c

Thanks	c
to	c
the	c
advance	i
of	c
Internet	i
I	c
can	c
contact	c
lots	c
of	c
colleagues	c
all	c
around	c
the	c
world	c
everyday	i
(	c
and	c
with	c
the	c
minimum	c
cost	c
)	c
.	c

But	c
,	c
on	i
my	i
opinion	i
,	c
the	c
best	c
thing	c
is	c
that	c
I	c
can	c
stay	c
at	c
home	c
or	c
going	i
on	c
holidays	i
,	c
and	c
send	c
my	c
work	c
to	c
the	c
office	c
everyday	i
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Ryan	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

However	c
now	i
if	c
someone	c
asks	c
me	c
the	c
same	c
question	c
my	c
answer	c
will	c
be	c
"	i
yes	i
,	c
I	c
like	c
it	c
"	c
.	c

They	c
do	c
n't	c
think	c
about	c
other	c
kind	i
of	c
shopping	c
which	c
are	c
liked	i
by	i
themselves	i
.	c

Maybe	c
they	c
like	c
shopping	c
on	c
internet	i
or	c
window	c
shopping	c
does	i
n't	c
matter	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
shopping	c
they	c
like	c
.	c

There	c
are	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
shopping	c
style	i
on	i
the	c
world	c
I	i
am	c
sure	c
everybody	c
prefer	i
one	c
of	c
them	c

Olivier	c
Peissaud	c

The	c
Manager	c

Circle	c
Theater	i

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complaint	i
about	c
a	c
very	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
I	c
recently	c
had	c
during	c
a	c
week	c
's	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

She	c
is	c
fond	c
of	c
the	c
actor	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
so	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
buy	c
two	c
tickets	c
,	c
provided	c
there	c
were	c
discounts	c
available	c
.	c

We	c
were	c
annoyed	c
about	c
it	c
but	c
we	c
paid	c
off	i
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
we	c
were	c
astonished	c
that	c
another	c
actor	c
we	c
did	c
not	c
know	c
was	c
playing	c
the	c
role	c
of	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
.	c

After	c
that	c
we	c
thought	c
we	c
could	c
have	c
a	c
drink	c
in	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
the	c
decorations	i
were	i
being	c
changed	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

How	c
interesting	c
it	c
is	c
to	c
imagine	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
people	c
will	c
wear	c
in	c
about	c
a	c
hundred	c
years	c
from	c
now	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
think	c
people	c
will	c
wear	c
clothes	c
made	c
of	c
recycled	c
things	c
,	c
like	c
bottles	i
of	i
aluminium	i
.	c

I	c
guess	c
they	c
will	c
wear	c
a	c
sort	c
of	c
tunique	i
upon	i
a	c
shirt	c
and	c
a	c
skirt	c
,	c
or	c
more	c
male	i
clothes	c
because	c
they	c
want	c
to	c
change	c
.	c

To	c
conclude	c
,	c
in	c
the	c
end	c
clothes	c
wo	c
n't	c
be	c
what	c
we	c
think	c
about	i
today	c
,	c
and	c
it	c
's	c
a	c
good	c
thing	c
because	c
we	c
can	c
only	c
imagine	c
and	c
follow	c
the	c
trend	c
of	c
fashion	c
that	c
makes	c
us	c
feel	c
pretty	c
and	c
happy	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
a	i
italian	i
student	c
who	c
has	i
come	i
to	c
the	c
last	c
International	c
Arts	c
Festival	c
.	c

I	c
noticed	c
that	c
the	c
artists	c
were	c
from	c
only	c
six	c
countries	c
insted	i
that	i
from	c
around	c
the	c
world	c
.	c

This	c
choice	i
does	c
n't	c
give	c
many	c
artists	c
the	c
possibility	i
to	c
expresse	i
themself	i
.	c

There	c
were	c
many	c
events	c
that	i
I	c
think	c
there	c
were	c
a	c
few	c
plays	c
and	c
films	c
.	c

Maybe	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
better	c
put	i
more	c
of	c
them	c
in	c
the	c
programme	c
because	c
they	i
like	i
so	i
much	i
to	i
young	i
people	i
.	c

The	i
very	i
about	i
young	c
people	c
,	c
the	c
choice	i
to	c
offer	c
a	c
reasonably-priced	i
weekend	c
ticket	c
is	c
a	i
excellent	c
idea	c
because	c
it	c
brings	i
them	i
to	i
have	i
a	i
contact	i
with	i
all	i
what	i
it	i
art	i
.	c

This	c
kind	c
of	c
job	c
is	c
perfect	c
for	c
the	i
young	c
people	c
who	c
want	c
get	i
money	c
and	c
in	i
the	i
meantime	i
they	i
have	c
to	c
study	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
work	c
in	c
a	c
fast-food	c
you	i
can	c
work	c
in	c
the	c
afternoon	c
,	c
or	c
during	c
the	c
night	c
and	i
so	c
you	c
have	c
time	c
for	c
yourself	c
.	c

Secondly	c
I	c
had	c
problems	c
with	c
both	c
tickets	c
and	c
time	c
.	c

(	c
I	c
have	c
a	c
special	c
youth	c
card	c
)	c
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
not	c
only	c
my	i
evening	i
was	i
horrible	c
but	c
also	c
expensive	c
.	c

Now	c
I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
because	c
a	c
story	c
of	i
Agatha	c
Christie	c
is	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
read	c
on	c
the	c
radio	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
will	c
spend	c
a	c
good	c
evening	c
listening	c
to	c
the	c
radio	c
.	c

The	c
story	c
is	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
read	c
next	c
Friday	c
at	c
8.00	c
p.m.	c
Have	c
a	c
good	c
time	c
and	c
write	c
soon	c
.	c

I	i
've	i
recently	i
visited	i
London	c
for	i
holidays	i
and	c
during	c
my	c
stay	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
your	c
theatre	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
really	c
sorry	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
I	c
am	i
very	c
disappointed	c
about	i
the	c
whole	c
organisation	c
of	c
the	c
musical	c
,	c
starting	c
from	i
the	c
advertisement	c
.	c

An	c
actor	c
that	c
I	c
admire	c
and	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
see	c
him	i
performing	c
.	c

Secondly	c
in	i
the	c
advertisement	c
the	i
starting	c
time	c
of	c
the	c
musical	c
was	c
said	c
to	c
be	c
at	i
19:30	c
,	c
but	c
the	c
theatre	i
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
want	c
to	c
be	c
rude	c
,	c
but	c
this	c
is	c
not	c
proffessional	i
at	c
all	c
.	c

Another	c
thing	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
mention	c
is	c
the	c
discount	c
that	c
we	c
were	c
supposed	c
to	c
have	c
on	c
the	c
tickets	c
.	c

Lastly	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
inform	c
you	c
that	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
have	c
dinner	c
at	c
yor	i
restaurant	c
but	c
they	c
told	c
me	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
it	c
usually	c
closes	c
at	c
11:00	c
o'clock	c
.	i

Of	c
course	c
using	c
modern	c
technology	c
has	c
both	c
advantages	c
and	c
disadvantages	c
.	c

I	c
spend	c
most	c
of	c
my	c
time	c
in	c
front	c
of	c
the	c
computer	c
,	c
either	c
working	c
or	c
playing	c
.	c

But	c
unfortunately	c
I	c
cannot	c
live	c
without	c
a	c
computer	c
.	c

The	c
first	c
thing	c
I	c
do	c
in	c
the	c
morning	c
is	c
start	c
up	c
my	c
computer	c
,	c
check	c
if	c
I	c
have	c
any	c
new	c
e-mails	c
,	c
check	c
my	c
electronic	c
calendar	c
and	c
then	c
go	c
to	c
work	c
,	c
where	c
I	c
always	c
work	c
with	c
a	c
computer	c
.	c

Everyday	i
I	c
use	c
the	c
microwave	c
for	c
heating	c
my	c
food	c
and	c
of	c
course	c
.	i

One	i
of	c
the	c
greatest	c
technological	c
achievements	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
afraid	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
I	c
cannot	c
live	c
without	c
my	c
mobile	c
phone	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
is	i
going	c
to	c
destroy	c
you	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr.	c
Robertson	c
,	c

The	c
London	c
fashion	i
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
will	c
start	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
for	c
us	c
because	c
there	c
will	c
be	c
expositions	i
of	c
the	c
latest	c
fashions	c
,	c
of	c
the	c
new	c
hairstyles	c
,	c
of	i
the	c
new	c
leisure	c
and	c
sports	c
clothes	c
and	c
people	c
teaching	c
how	c
to	c
make	i
up	i
.	c

Our	c
suggestion	c
is	c
that	c
you	c
could	c
change	c
the	i
day	i
of	i
the	i
leisure	i
time	i
to	i
the	i
shopping	i
in	i
the	i
afternoon	i
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	i
,	c

They	c
form	c
opinions	c
and	c
invent	c
new	c
fashion	c
styles	c
.	c

The	c
media	c
is	c
starting	c
to	c
get	i
into	c
the	c
private	c
life	c
of	c
these	c
famous	c
people	c
.	c

If	c
the	c
famous	c
person	c
does	c
n't	c
mind	c
in	i
being	c
filmed	c
in	c
his	c
personal	c
life	c
there	c
's	c
no	c
problem	c
.	c

Everybody	c
likes	c
to	c
be	c
with	c
your	i
family	c
without	c
any	c
reporter	c
or	c
photographer	c
.	i

The	i
respect	i
is	c
essential	c
.	c

They	c
deserve	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
private	c
life	c
like	c
any	c
common	i
person	c
.	c

Instead	c
of	c
him	c
,	c
there	c
was	c
an	c
unknown	c
actor	c
,	c
who	c
I	c
dislike	c
.	c

That	c
is	c
why	c
,	c
it	i
finished	c
later	c
and	i
I	c
arrived	c
late	c
to	c
a	c
basketball	c
match	i
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
sunday	i
.	c

That	c
is	c
why	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
pleased	c
if	c
you	c
give	c
my	i
money	c
back	c
.	c

That	c
's	c
why	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
want	c
to	c
tell	c
him	c
that	c
I	c
had	c
failed	c
my	c
natural	c
science	c
final	c
exam	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
worried	c
because	c
if	c
my	c
parents	c
knew	c
that	c
I	c
had	c
failed	c
,	c
before	c
we	c
were	c
on	c
holidays	i
,	c
they	c
will	i
cancelled	i
the	c
trip	c
to	c
Africa	c
.	c

They	c
treated	c
each	c
other	c
as	c
if	c
they	c
were	c
husband	c
and	c
wife	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
way	c
they	c
were	c
thirsty	c
so	c
when	c
they	c
looked	c
into	c
the	c
lake	c
,	c
they	c
saw	c
a	c
long	c
bar	c
of	c
gold	c
.	c

When	c
the	c
man	c
hurriedly	c
ran	c
to	c
the	c
lake	c
,	c
all	c
he	c
found	c
was	c
a	c
long	c
snake	c
.	c

He	c
was	c
just	c
able	c
to	c
kill	c
it	c
by	c
cutting	c
the	c
snake	c
into	i
half	c
by	c
using	c
his	c
knife	c
which	c
was	c
as	c
sharp	c
as	c
a	c
sickle	c
.	c

They	c
lived	c
happily	c
ever	c
after	c
.	c

This	c
story	c

WHAT	c

FORGIVE	c
TO	i
YOUR	c
COMPANY	c

TO	i

START	i

AND	c
HE	c
FELT	c
REALLY	c
DISSAPOINTED	i

IT	i
IS	c
N'T	c
ALL	c

NOBODY	c
TELL	i

He	c
was	c
shy	c
,	c
reserved	c
and	c
a	c
very	c
closed	c
person	c
.	c

He	c
enjoyed	c
himself	c
reading	c
,	c
playing	i
piano	c
at	c
home	c
.	c

Despite	c
his	c
way	c
of	c
live	i
,	c
his	c
best	c
friend	c
was	c
Anna	c
,	c
the	c
most	c
popular	c
girl	c
in	c
the	c
school	c
.	c

Definately	i
the	i
worse	i
.	c

He	c
was	c
very	c
happy	c
,	c
because	c
he	c
felt	c
that	c
everybody	c
loved	c
him	c
.	c

Everyone	c
,	i
less	i
Anna	c
.	c

And	c
you	c
?	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
very	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
there	c
were	c
the	i
different	c
actors	c
in	c
a	i
show	c
,	c
but	c
you	c
did	c
n't	c
say	c
anything	c
about	c
it	c
before	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

We	c
know	c
that	c
everything	c
is	c
changing	c
.	c

It	i
's	i
connected	i
with	i
our	c
house	c
,	c
our	c
workplace	c
and	i
e.t.c	i
.	c

Another	c
example	c
is	c
that	c
earlier	i
we	c
had	c
to	c
rewrite	c
some	c
documents	c
by	c
hand	c
just	c
to	c
make	c
a	c
copy	c
.	c

The	c
purpose	i
that	c
I	c
am	c
writing	c
due	i
to	i
the	i
fact	i
that	c
my	c
class	c
has	c
seen	c
an	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
.	c

This	c
is	c
great	i
opportunity	c
for	c
the	c
student	i
to	c
learn	c
the	i
changing	i
in	c
fashion	c
and	c
leisure	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
free	c
.	c

We	c
agreed	i
all	i
that	c
the	c
programme	c
on	c
Monday	c
March	c
13th	c
is	c
wonderful	c
.	c

Obviously	c
,	c
they	c
have	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
fans	c
and	c
their	c
fans	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
what	c
happened	i
to	c
them	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
,	c
their	c
life	i
may	c
be	c
the	i
good	c
example	c
for	c
other	c
people	c
to	c
follow	c
.	c

Eventhough	i
,	c
the	i
famous	c
people	c
can	c
be	c
the	i
good	c
example	c
,	c
they	c
should	i
be	i
the	i
bad	i
habit	i
for	i
public	i
.	c

A	c
lot	c
of	c
people	c
try	c
to	c
be	c
like	c
people	c
who	c
they	c
admire	c
,	c
For	i
example	c
,	c
buying	c
the	c
clothes	c
that	c
famous	c
people	c
wear	c
.	c

We	c
are	c
planning	c
to	c
spend	c
2	c
weeks	c
travelling	c
.	c

I	c
've	c
had	c
unpleasant	c
experience	i
from	i
my	c
last	c
holidays	c
when	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
as	i
I	c
have	c
n't	c
stayed	c
in	c
a	c
cabin	c
,	c
I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
staying	c
in	c
a	c
cabin	c
.	c

How	c
's	c
the	c
weather	c
there	c
?	c

Could	c
you	c
tell	c
me	c
about	c
them	c
?	c

I	i
'll	i
be	c
grateful	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
send	c
me	c
further	c
information	c
.	c

I	c
thought	c
going	c
shopping	c
was	c
suitable	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
to	c
control	c
my	c
expenses	c
on	i
the	i
budget	i
.	c

It	c
's	c
not	c
easy	c
for	c
me	c
,	c
as	c
I	c
used	c
to	c
depend	c
on	c
my	c
parents	c
before	c
I	c
came	c
here	c
.	c

What	c
makes	c
me	c
desperate	c
is	c
a	c
nice	c
summer	c
dress	c
I	c
've	c
found	c
in	c
a	c
department	c
store	c

I	c
hope	c
that	c
you	c
are	c
now	c
well	c
informed	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
which	i

how	c
much	c

I	c
should	c
bring	c
with	c

I	c

am	c
sure	c
you	c

know	c
some	c

Dear	c
Mr	c

We	c
are	c
really	c
interested	c
in	c
visiting	c
this	c
unhabitual	i

the	c
main	c
advantage	c
is	c
that	c
the	i
entry	c
is	c
free	c
for	c
students	c

I	c
hope	c
that	c
you	c
will	c
agree	c
with	i
this	c

I	c
am	c
waiting	c
for	c
your	c
answer	c

The	c

of	c
the	i

how	c
this	c

can	c
reach	c
such	i
extremities	i

As	c
public	c
people	c
,	c
stars	c
and	c
politicians	c
have	c
to	c
accord	i
some	c
time	c
to	c
their	c
public	c
but	c
fans	c
and	c
press	c
people	c
have	c
to	c
respect	c
their	c
private	c
life	c
and	c
to	c
stay	c
polite	c
and	c
respectful	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
you	i

for	i
your	c
program	i
which	c
will	i

for	i

"	c
Home	c

has	c
so	c
much	c
meaning	c
to	i
the	i
people	c
.	c

I	c
want	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
home	c
which	c
is	c
built	c
with	c
a	c
new	c
material	c
.	c

Home	i
made	c
out	c
of	c
plastic	c
also	i
windows	c
made	c
out	c
of	c
plastic	c
therefore	i
we	c
can	i
have	c
our	c
home	c
for	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
.	c

The	i
door	c
it	i
is	c
broken	c
,	c
we	c
can	c
replace	c
it	c
rapidly	i
and	c
it	c
is	c
not	c
expensive	c
when	c
it	c
is	c
plastic	c

We	c
have	c
more	c
time	c
to	c
stay	c
together	c
at	c
home	c
,	c
watching	c
TV	c
,	c
playing	c
games	c

etc	c
....	c
because	c
we	c
can	c
access	c
to	i

at	c

we	i
can	c
have	c
all	c
informations	i
from	c

will	c
be	c
a	c
numer	i
of	c
Developments	c
in	c

in	c
the	c
future	c

which	c
can	i
make	c
our	c

easier	c

what	c

Dear	c
J.	c
Clark	c
,	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
in	c
response	c
to	c
your	c
advertisement	c
about	c
the	c
annual	c
international	c
arts	c
festival	c
.	c

I	c
really	c
think	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
great	c
idea	c
to	c
organize	c
such	c
a	c
festival	c
in	c
our	c
city	c
as	c
there	c
are	c
lots	c
of	c
people	c
fond	c
of	c
art	c
over	c
here	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
sure	c
they	c
are	c
all	c
very	c
grateful	c
to	c
you	c
now	c
.	c

I	c
also	c
think	c
the	c
places	c
you	c
have	c
chosen	c
for	c
the	c
classical	c
concerts	c
were	c
not	c
good	c
sometimes	c
,	c
some	c
of	c
the	c
halls	c
seemed	c
to	c
be	c
too	c
small	c
.	c

But	c
your	c
idea	c
about	c
the	c
weekend	c
ticket	c
is	c
just	c
excellent	c
,	c
people	c
from	c
the	c
whole	c
country	c
get	c
the	c
opportunity	c
to	c
visit	c
your	c
festival	c
and	c
see	c
all	c
the	c
events	c
you	c
are	c
offering	c
.	c

Well	c
,	c
thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
this	c
festival	c
,	c
my	c
friends	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
enjoyed	c
it	c
a	c
lot	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
so	c
much	c
for	c
your	c
lovely	c
letter	c
,	c
it	c
's	c
always	c
great	c
to	c
get	c
something	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
quite	c
difficult	c
to	c
talk	c
bout	i
our	c
school	c
rules	c
actually	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
'll	c
try	c
to	c
help	c
you	c
somehow	c
.	c

Our	c
teaches	i
do	c
n't	c
let	c
us	c
smoke	c
of	i
course	c
,	c
but	c
you	c
can	c
always	c
see	c
some	c
students	c
smoking	c
outside	c
,	c
so	c
it	c
's	c
not	c
that	c
strict	c
to	c
be	c
honest	c
.	c

We	c
're	c
not	c
allowed	c
to	c
drink	c
alcohol	c
as	c
well	c
and	c
quarrel	c
with	c
any	c
of	c
the	c
teaches	i
.	c

I	c
was	c
glad	c
to	c
hearing	i
the	c
news	c
from	c
you	c
and	c
thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
!	c

Therefore	c
,	c
I	c
hope	c
that	c
you	c
could	i
make	i
suitable	i
arguement	i
between	c
you	c
and	c
me	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
log	c
cabins	c
which	i
I	c
could	i
feel	c
more	i
American	c
style	c
of	c
the	i
accommodation	c
.	c

Esepically	i
,	c
it	c
is	i
really	c
good	c
for	c
my	c
healthy	i
during	i
the	i
growth	i
period	i
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
!	c

Your	i
sincerely	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c

There	c
are	c
more	c
and	c
more	c
retailors	i
are	i
opening	c
to	i
customer	i
.	c

Therefore	c
,	c
people	c
used	i
to	i
shopping	c
weekly	c
or	c
monthly	c
.	c

It	i
seems	i
a	i
human	i
activity	i
during	i
their	i
spare	i
time	i
.	c

It	c
is	c
new	c
for	c
customers	i
by	i
technology	c
they	c
can	c
switch	c
on	c
the	c
computer	c
and	c
click	c
everything	c
they	c
want	c
.	c

Therefore	c
,	c
they	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
use	c
"	c
e-shopping	c
"	c
which	i
is	c
getting	i
better	i
for	i
their	i
time	i
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
I	c
believe	c
that	c
shopping	c
only	c
waste	i
time	c
for	i
human	i
life	i
.	c

And	i
you	i
could	i
n't	i
get	i
back	i
any	i
more	i
.	c

I	c
have	c
recently	c
been	c
to	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
and	c
watched	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
-	c
over	i
the	i
rainbow	i
.	c

As	c
a	c
result	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
pay	c
the	c
full	c
price	c
of	c
£	c
15	c
.	c

After	c
the	c
show	c
we	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
Theatre	i
restaurant	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
due	i
to	i
the	i
refurbishment	c
.	c

Your	i
Sincerely	i

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

My	c
story	c
had	c
already	c
been	c
spread	c
out	i
the	c
next	c
day	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
last	c
day	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
packing	c
and	c
getting	c
ready	c
to	c
leave	c
,	c
I	c
realised	c
I	c
had	c
lost	c
my	c
passport	c
and	c
tickets	c
.	c

A	c
horrible	c
thought	c
suddenly	c
came	c
into	c
my	c
mind	c
.	c

My	c
bad	c
luck	c
had	c
never	c
left	c
me	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
,	c

Last	c
week	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
week	c
's	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
,	c
where	c
I	c
have	i
n't	i
been	c
for	c
2	c
years	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
we	c
booked	c
the	i
show	c
at	c
19:30	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
,	i
what	i
's	i
wrong	c
with	c
your	c
clock	c
?	c
.	i

The	c
last	c
one	i
,	i
we	c
wanted	c
to	c
have	c
a	i
dinner	c
in	c
your	c
restaurant	c
after	c
a	i
terrible	c
musical	c
show	c
,	c
but	c
we	c
could	c
n't	c
have	i
it	i
,	c
because	c
a	c
waiter	c
said	c
your	c
chef	c
had	c
gone	c
home	c
.	c

By	c
the	c
way	c
,	c
I	c
want	c
you	c
to	c
pay	i
my	i
money	c
back	c
for	i
the	c
waste	i
time	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
you	c
understand	c
.	c

Try	c
it	c
,	i
it	i
does	i
n't	i
need	i
to	i
take	i
a	i
long	i
time	i
to	i
live	i
in	i
that	i
place	i
,	i
but	i
it	i
will	i
give	i
you	i
many	i
things	i
,	c
which	c
are	c
different	c
from	c
your	c
lifestyle	c
in	c
city	i
.	c

How	i
much	c
the	i
technology	c
gives	c
to	c
you	c
,	c
it	c
take	i
from	i
you	i
more	i
.	c

We	c
both	c
know	c
this	c
is	c
not	c
true	c
,	c
or	c
shoud	i
n't	i
be	c
.	c

Can	c
you	c
imagine	c
how	c
many	c
things	c
one	c
can	i
do	c
instead	c
.	c

Well	c
,	c
I	c
will	c
not	c
comment	c
that	i
point	c
.	c

Well	c
,	c
this	c
is	c
not	c
my	c
idea	c
of	c
a	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
,	c
as	c
you	c
can	c
realise	i
.	c

But	c
I	c
can	c
say	c
that	c
you	c
will	c
never	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
give	c
my	c
appreciation	c
for	c
your	c
theatre	c
back	c
,	c
at	c
least	c
till	i
you	c
continue	c
as	c
its	c
manager	c
.	c

Expecting	c
your	c
news	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
sure	c
that	c
fashion	c
will	c
survive	c
for	c
ages	c
,	c
even	i
it	i
will	i
change	c
to	c
become	c
easier	c
to	c
use	c
and	c
clean	i
,	c
because	c
we	c
all	c
need	c
to	c
feel	c
a	c

I	c

a	c
week	i

so	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
spend	c
my	c
last	c

with	i
great	i
pleasure	i
,	c
however	c
it	c
was	c
the	c
worse	i
evening	c
in	c
my	c
life	c

It	c
was	c
my	c
dream	c
to	c
see	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
,	c
so	c
it	c
is	c
still	c
my	c
dream	c
because	c
of	c
your	c

So	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
no	c

evening	c
out	c

I	c
want	c

money	c

When	c
the	c

I	c
was	c
terrible	i

so	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
have	c
something	c
to	c
eat	c
but	c
the	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
and	c
the	c
advertisiment	i
said	c
that	c
it	c
would	c
be	c

As	i
for	i
the	i
"	c
Over	c
The	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
presented	i
by	i
your	c
theatre	c
last	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
inform	c
you	c
of	c
the	c
following	c
problems	c

The	c
Ad	i

Lastly	c
,	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
had	i
been	i
closed	i
already	i
when	c
the	c
show	c
was	i
finished	i
,	c
because	c
the	c
time	i
of	i
begining	i
of	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
late	c

As	c
above	i
mentioned	i
,	c
it	c
can	i
not	i
be	c
a	c
"	c
perfect	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c

The	i
last	i
week	c
I	c
have	i
been	i
to	c
London	c
for	c
a	c
holiday	c
.	c

I	c
went	c
to	c
buy	c
the	c
tickets	c
but	c
when	c
I	c
paid	c
there	c
was	c
not	c
any	c
discount	c
avaible	i
.	c

When	c
it	c
started	c
the	c
main	c
actor	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
was	c
not	c
in	c
,	i
another	c
worse	i
actor	c
was	i
taken	c
his	c
part	c
.	c

When	c
it	c
finished	c
I	i
arrived	i
at	i
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
they	c
are	c
going	c
to	c
do	i
a	c
new	c
better	i
restaurant	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
did	c
not	c
know	c
it	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
told	c
her	c
my	c
secret	c
:	c
I	c
have	i
fell	i
in	c
love	c
with	c
Paul	c
a	i
friend	c
of	c
us	i
.	c

No	c
one	c
know	i
it	c
else	i
her	c
.	c

The	i
thursday	i
Sally	c
phoned	c
me	c
,	c
because	c
we	c
are	c
also	c
friends	c
,	c
but	c
she	c
did	c
not	c
tell	c
me	c
anything	c
about	c
Paul	c
.	c

She	c
hit	c
me	c
and	c
I	c
decided	c
in	i
this	i
moment	i
that	c
I	c
never	i
should	i
speak	c
with	i
her	c
.	i

Paul	c
ask	i
Pat	c
what	c
had	c
happened	c
and	c
she	c
told	c
him	c
my	c
secret	c
.	c

It	c
will	c
take	c
place	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
March	c
14th	c
at	c
the	c
Central	c
Exhibition	c
Hall	c
,	c
from	c
10.00	c
to	c
19.00	c
.	c

We	c
discussed	c
about	i
the	c
programme	c
,	c
and	c
because	c
the	c
show	c
will	c
take	c
the	c
whole	c
day	c
,	c
we	c
would	c
not	c
mind	c
going	c
to	c
the	c
Science	c
Museum	c
on	c
Wenesday	i
instead	c
of	c
having	c
free	c
time	c
all	c
afternoon	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
having	c
your	c
answer	c
.	c

Nobody	c
thought	c
I	c
was	c
capable	c
of	c
doing	c
it	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
managed	c
to	c
move	c
my	c
right	c
foot	c
closer	c
to	c
the	c
edge	c
.	c

Only	c
few	i
more	c
seconds	c
,	c
otherwise	c
my	c
time	i
would	c
be	c
over	c
.	c

Somehow	c
I	c
managed	c
to	c
jump	c
out	c
of	c
the	c
airplane	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
flying	c
!	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
the	c
good	c
programme	c
you	c
organised	i
for	c
our	c
trip	c
to	c
London	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
called	c
,,The	i
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show.	c
"	c

This	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
because	i
we	c
are	c
all	c
intrested	i
in	c
clothes	c
,	c
sports	c
and	c
fashion	c
.	c

Our	c
question	c
now	c
:	i
Could	i
we	c
go	c
to	c
this	c
show	c
?	c

We	c
all	i
prefer	i
the	i
show	c
,	i
free	c
time	c
is	c
not	c
so	c
important	c
for	c
us	c
.	c

Thanks	c
.	c

Dear	c
Jack	c

Thanks	c
a	c
lot	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
fine	c
but	c
quite	c
busy	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
my	c
German	c
exams	c
.	c

Therefore	c
I	c
read	c
Agatha	c
Christie	c
's	c
,,Best	i
Detective	c
Stories	c
of	c
Agatha	c
Christie	c
"	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
also	c
a	c
suitable	c
present	c
for	c
your	c
cousin	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
.	c

One	c
story	c
is	c
about	c
ten	c
persons	i
who	c
stay	c
together	c
in	c
a	c
hotel	c
on	c
a	c
lonely	c
island	c
.	c

Suddenly	c
a	c
murderer	i
happens	i
!	c

Believe	c
me	c
,	c
you	c
would	c
never	c
guess	c
who	c
the	c
killer	c
is	c
!	c

But	c
I	c
will	c
not	c
tell	c
you	c
more	i
.	c

And	c
if	c
your	c
cousin	c
likes	c
crime	c
stories	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
perfect	c
book	c
!	c

Okay	c
,	c
I	c
hope	c
to	c
have	c
news	c
from	c
you	c
very	c
soon	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

Certainly	c
,	c
we	c
do	c
not	c
refuse	c
to	c
take	c
part	c
in	c
other	c
activities	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

Probably	c
,	c
you	c
will	c
agree	c
just	i
to	c
put	i
London	i
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
instead	c
of	c
Science	i
Museum	c
and	c
shopping	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
attenlion	i
and	c
understanding	c
.	c

But	c
,	c
on	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
people	c
will	c
still	c
have	c
to	c
programm	i
them	c
,	c
as	c
they	c
have	c
to	c
do	c
nowadays	c
.	c

This	c
is	c
my	c
opinion	i
of	c
the	c
Home	c
of	c
the	c
Future	c
and	c
I	c
wish	c
I	c
could	c
live	c
in	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
AM	c
WRITING	c
TO	c
COMPLAIN	c
ABOUT	c
THE	c
PROBLEMS	c
WHICH	c
OCCURRED	c
IN	i
THE	c
LAST	c
MUSICAL	c
SHOW	c
OF	i
THIS	c
THEATRE	c
.	c

I	c
AM	c
VERY	c
DISAPPOINTED	c
,	c
BECAUSE	c
THAT	c
EVENING	c
OUT	c
WAS	c
NOT	c
PERFECT	i
AS	c
I	c
HAD	c
PLANNED	c
.	c

NEWS	i
INVENTS	i
HAVE	c
BEEN	c
INVENTED	c
AND	c
THE	i
SCIENCE	c
HAS	c
BEEN	i
IN	i
QUICK	c
PROGRESS	c
.	c

AS	c
A	c
RESULT	c
OF	c
THIS	c
PEOPLE	c
'S	c
DAILY	c
LIFE	i
HAS	i
BEEN	c
CHANGING	c
AS	c
WELL	c
.	c

AS	c
FAR	c
AS	c
I	c
'M	c
CONCERNED	c
,	c
I	c
FIRMLY	c
BELIEVE	c
THAT	c
,	i
IT	c
'S	c
WORTH	c
TO	i
POINTING	i
OUT	c
THE	c
FOLLOWING	c
:	c

IN	c
THE	c
SAME	c
WAY	c
,	c
WE	c
CAN	c
TRAVEL	c
INSIDE	c
OUR	c
COUNTRY	c
QUICKLY	c
AND	c
SAFELY	c
.	c

SECONDLY	c
,	c
WE	c
CA	c
N'T	c
FORGET	c
EITHER	c
THAT	c
ALL	c
OF	c
US	c
HAVE	c
CONDITIONS	i
TO	c
COMMUNICATE	c
WITH	c
PEOPLE	c
BY	c
MOBILE	c
PHONES	i
,	c
BY	c
INTERNET	i
,	c
WHO	c
LIVE	c
NOT	c
ONLY	c
IN	c
THIS	c
COUNTRY	c
,	c
BUT	c
ALSO	c
ABROAD	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
despite	c
the	c
advertisement	c
stating	c
that	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
was	c
starring	c
,	c
another	c
actor	c
was	i
starring	i
in	c
the	c
actual	c
show	c
and	c
his	c
performance	c
was	c
literally	i
horrible	c
,	c
and	c
disappointing	c
.	c

I	i
had	i
gone	i
to	i
the	i
show	i
which	i
according	i
to	i
the	i
advertisement	i
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
begin	c
at	c
19:30	c
,	c
but	c
the	c
show	c
did	c
not	c
start	c
until	c
20:15	c
.	c

However	c
by	i
the	c
time	c
the	c
show	c
had	c
ended	c
the	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

How	c
has	c
modern	c
technology	c
change	i
your	c
daily	c
life	c
?	c

One	c
of	c
the	c
essential	c
developement	i
is	i
the	i
form	i
of	c
transportation	c
.	c

This	c
enables	c
us	c
to	c
save	c
great	i
deal	c
of	c
time	c
and	c
effort	c
.	c

This	c
compared	i
to	c
the	c
traditional	c
bicycle	c
is	i
less	c
physically	c
painstaking	i
and	c
less	c
time	i
consuming	i
and	c
therefore	c
lets	c
me	c
travel	c
to	c
my	c
destination	c
in	i
small	i
amount	i
of	i
time	i
with	c
hardly	c
no	i
effort	c
at	c
all	c
.	c

This	c
has	c
made	c
my	c
life	c
easier	c
.	c

Another	c
significant	c
technological	c
developement	i
is	c
the	c
creation	i
of	c
electrical	c
appliances	c
.	c

Before	c
I	c
used	c
computers	c
generally	i
,	c
It	i
took	c
so	c
much	c
time	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
looking	i
up	c
words	c
in	c
a	c
dictionary	c
and	c
looking	i
up	c
for	i
information	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
:	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
telling	c
me	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
and	c
now	c
I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
tell	i
you	c
the	c
information	c
you	c
have	c
requested	c
.	c

And	c
the	i
other	c
one	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
painting	c
will	c
be	c
a	c
good	c
idea	c
;	c
Painting	i
is	c
one	c
of	c
my	c
hobbies	c
and	c
I	c
've	c
been	c
learning	i
it	c
since	c
I	c
was	c
5	c
years	c
old	c
and	c
now	c
I	c
'm	c
still	c
doing	c
it	c
once	i
I	c
have	c
free	i
time	c
.	c

Look	i
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
:	c

The	c
place	c
we	i
worked	c
was	c
a	c
football	c
pitch	c
;	c
we	c
spent	c
3	c
days	c
on	i
setting	c
up	c
the	c
stage	c
,	c
the	c
equitment	i
,	c
and	c
the	c
lights	c
.	c

In	c
fact	c
,	c
there	c
is	i
nothing	c
very	c
important	c
I	c
did	c
,	c
because	c
we	c
are	i
not	c
the	c
right	c
people	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
the	c
date	i
of	c
concer	i
came	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
receiving	c
your	c
letter	c
again	c

When	c
I	c
saw	c
the	c
advertisement	c
of	i
the	c
show	c
it	c
was	c
written	c
that	c
the	c
show	c
will	i
started	i
at	c
a	c
half	c
past	c
seven	c
but	c
started	i
at	c

I	c
am	c

Is	c

I	c

Do	c

Do	c

I	c
will	c
be	c
waiting	c
a	i
reply	c

I	c
'm	c
sorry	c
it	c
took	c
so	c
long	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
answer	c
your	c
letter	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
've	c
been	c
too	c
busy	c
with	c
my	c
school	c
,	c
papers	c
and	c
everything	c

When	c
they	c
said	c
my	c
name	c
,	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
believe	c
it	c
!	c

I	c
was	c
so	c
excited	c
that	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
believe	c
.	i

When	c
I	c
arrived	c
to	c
help	c
them	c
,	c
they	c
welcomed	c
me	c
and	c
were	c
so	c
nice	c
with	i
me	c
that	c
it	c
seemed	c
we	c
had	c
known	c
each	c
others	i
in	i
ages	c

JUN	c
17th	c

2000	c

I	c
was	c
really	c
excited	c
with	i
the	c
idea	c
of	c
seeing	c
that	c
show	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
when	c
I	c
arrived	c
,	c
I	c
met	i
a	c
note	c
stuck	c
on	c
the	c
front	c
door	c
that	c
informed	c
about	i
changes	c
at	i
actor	i
's	i
staff	i
.	c

Danny	c
Brook	c
was	c
ill	c
.	c

He	c
was	c
replaced	c
by	c
another	c
actor	c
whose	c
abilities	c
were	c
bad	i
.	c

I	c
had	c
put	c
some	c
money	c
aside	c
for	c
a	i
month	c
,	c
thinking	c
about	c
the	c
discount	c
,	c
but	c
when	c
I	c
want	i
to	c
buy	c
them	c
they	c
said	c
that	c
discounts	c
were	c
not	c
avaible	i
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
not	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

That	c
is	c
why	c
she	c
could	c
no	i
be	c
a	c
spy	c
.	c

Her	c
mother	c
gave	c
a	i
book	c
about	i
how	i
to	i
become	i
a	i
spy	i
for	i
her	i
birthday	i
.	c

You	c
can	c
imagine	c
what	c
had	i
happened	i
with	i
her	c
cover	c
as	i
a	i
spy	i
.	c

Dear	c

As	c
my	c

's	c
new	c

about	c

help	c
with	c
the	c
restaurant	c
,	c
which	c
is	c
expected	c
to	c
be	c
rather	c
busy	c
.	c

As	c
for	c
selecting	c
two	c
activities	c
,	c
basketball	c
and	c
surfing	c
are	c
definitely	c
on	c
my	c
list	c
.	c

Surfing	c
was	c
a	c
fresh	i
sport	c
to	c
me	c
which	c
I	c
took	c
up	c
recently	c
.	c

How	c
much	c
money	c
is	c
appropriate	i
to	c
carry	i
?	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

I	c
really	c
wish	c
you	c
were	i
there	c
with	c
me	c
at	i
that	i
one	c
of	c
the	c
exciting	c
nights	c
in	c
my	c
life	c
.	c

That	i
was	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
of	i
Steps	c
in	c
M.E.N	i
Arena	c
.	c

A	c
few	c
minutes	c
after	c
the	c
concert	c
began	c
,	c
a	c
backstage	c
assistant	c
called	c
in	c
sick	c
who	c
was	c
responsible	c
for	c
checking	c
wether	i
everything	c
is	i
going	c
well	c
according	c
to	c
the	c
timetable	c
,	i
if	i
something	c
comes	c
up	c
,	c
she	c
should	c
inform	c
other	i
staff	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
then	c
taken	c
in	i
to	c
cover	c
her	c
job	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
given	c
lots	c
of	c
paper	c
with	c
many	c
different	c
time	i
on	c
it	c
.	c

They	c
were	c
very	c
helpful	c
and	c
nice	c
.	c

Then	c
I	c
found	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
as	c
complicated	c
as	c
I	c
though	i
before	i
.	c

And	c
I	c
guess	c
I	c
did	c
a	c
good	c
job	c
as	c
everything	c
was	c
getting	i
on	i
quite	c
well	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
lucky	c
to	c
have	c
this	c
chance	c
and	c
able	c
to	c
know	i
how	c
they	c
work	c
behind	c
the	c
scene	i
.	c

All	c
in	c
all	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
once-a-lifetime	i
experience	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

Regarding	i
your	c
advertisement	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
the	i
LONDON	c
'S	c
NEWEST	c
AND	c
BEST	c
MUSICAL	c
SHOW	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
was	c
deeply	c
disappointed	c
at	i
it	c
.	c

I	c
decided	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
see	c
this	c
show	c
because	c
of	c
its	c
starrings	i
,	c
but	c
at	i
the	c
day	c
I	c
saw	c
it	c
,	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
played	i
.	c

I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
for	c
a	c
full	c
refund	c
for	c
this	c
awful	c
night	c
.	c

Could	c
you	c
give	c
me	c
a	c
satisfactory	c
reply	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c
.	i

yours	c
faithfully	c

Modern	c
technology	c
has	c
changed	c
my	c
life	c
.	c

Especially	i
,	c
a	i
computer	c
has	c
made	i
my	i
daily	i
life	i
change	i
dramatically	c
.	c

I	c
open	c
my	c
e-mail	i
box	i
every	c
night	c
.	c

Thanks	c
to	c
modern	c
technology	c
,	c
I	c
enjoy	c
chatting	c
with	c
my	c
friend	i
in	c
other	c
countries	c
and	c
my	c
family	c
in	c
Japan	c
almost	c
every	c
day	c
.	c

Below	c
I	c
provide	c
you	c
with	c
the	c
information	c
that	c
you	c
asked	c
me	c
for	c
.	c

I	c
already	c
have	c
plans	c
for	c
my	c
holiday	c
and	c
July	c
suits	c
me	c
the	c
best	c
.	c

The	c
activities	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
do	c
during	c
my	c
stay	c
are	c
golf	c
and	c
surfing	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
two	c
questions	c
.	c

The	c
other	c
question	c
is	c
about	c
money	c
.	c

Will	c
I	c
be	c
given	c
any	c
pocket-money	c
or	c
do	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
bring	c
my	c
own	c
money	c
to	c
cover	c
additional	c
expences	i
?	c

First	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
doing	i
a	c
video	c
about	c
daily	c
life	c
at	c
our	c
school	c
is	c
great	i
idea	c
.	c

To	c
make	c
that	c
happen	c
,	c
we	c
have	c
to	c
find	c
some	c
interesting	c
activities	c
to	c
film	c
.	c

Below	c
are	c
my	c
suggestions	c
of	i
what	c
should	c
be	c
filmed	c
.	c

The	c
computer	c
class	c
can	i
be	c
also	c
there	c
,	c
because	c
program	i
and	c
internet	c
surfing	c
is	i
quite	c
interesting	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
pleased	c
to	i
see	i
Danny	c
Brooke	c
,	c
he	c
's	c
my	c
favourite	c
actor	c
,	c
so	c
you	c
can	c
easily	c
imagine	c
how	c
disappointed	c
I	c
was	c
when	c
I	c
saw	c
a	c
different	c
and	c
unknown	c
actor	c
on	c
the	c
scene	i
!	c

You	c
had	c
promised	c
discounts	c
on	c
the	c
cost	c
which	i
was	c
from	c
£	c
10	c
to	c
£	c
20	c
,	c
but	c
despite	c
my	i
thoughts	i
I	c
had	c
to	c
pay	c
£	c
20	c
without	c
chance	i
.	c

In	c
the	c
end	c
,	c
I	c
thought	c
I	c
could	c
enjoy	c
myself	c
visit	i
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
of	c
something	c
they	c
did	c
n't	c
explain	c
to	c
me	c
.	c

your	i
sincerely	c

The	c
major	i
characther	i
is	c
the	c
old	c
man	c
who	c
has	c
to	c
fight	c
against	c
the	c
sea	c
to	c
keep	i
alive	c
.	c

This	c
old	c
man	c
with	c
his	c
old	c
boat	c
goes	c
too	c
far	c
away	c
from	c
the	c
coast	c
to	c
try	c
to	c
fish	c
something	i
good	c
.	c

By	c
surprise	c
he	c
comes	c
across	c
the	c
biggest	c
fish	c
he	c
has	c
ever	c
seen	c
,	c
a	c
beautiful	c
marlin	c
.	c

The	c
man	c
keeps	c
immediatly	i
in	c
contact	c
with	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
they	c
're	c
really	c
brothers	c
,	c
they	c
feel	c
the	c
same	c
pain	c
and	c
fear	c
during	c
the	c
battle	c
.	c

He	c
respected	c
and	c
still	c
loves	i
it	c
.	c

Even	c
though	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
only	c
in	i
July	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
high	c
school	c
student	c
.	c

Thus	c
I	c
have	c
not	c
got	c
long	i
holiday	c
.	c

I	c
just	c
have	c
one	c
month	c
left	i
.	c

which	c
include	c
the	i
english	i
song	i
and	c
the	c
japenese	i
song	i
,	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
part-time	i
job	c
for	i
sining	i
at	c
restaurant	i
.	c

It	c
was	c
in	i
lunch	i
time	i
.	c

Everybody	c
were	i
went	i
to	c
by	i
luch	i
in	c
supermarket	i
,	i
in	i
fact	c
,	c
nobody	c
liked	i
crowe	i
and	c
quare	i
,	c
expecially	i
in	i
the	c
summer	i
time	i
.	c

Suddenly	c
the	c
customer	c
though	i
the	c
receipt	c
was	c
not	c
truth	i
,	i
she	i
did	c
not	c
buy	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
things	c
but	c
the	c
shop	c
assistant	c
did	c
not	c
make	c
mistake	i
,	i
they	i
argued	c
about	c
this	c
thing	c
.	c

The	c
shop	c
manager	c
was	i
coming	i
solution	i
it	c
.	c

Even	c
though	c
I	c
think	c
it	i
most	i
of	i
time	i
is	c
very	c
interesting	c
,	c
sometimes	c
make	i
people	c
upsent	i
.	c

Dear	c
Jane	c
Clark	c
,	c

I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
International	c
Arts	c
Festival	c
and	c
saw	c
some	c
interesting	c
things	c
,	c
but	c
many	c
points	c
could	c
be	c
better	c
.	c

That	c
is	c
why	c
I	i
write	i
to	c
you	c
,	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
some	c
suggestions	c
that	c
you	c
can	c
take	c
into	c
consideration	c
or	c
not	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
important	c
to	c
rent	c
bigger	c
halls	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

Thirdly	c
,	c
I	c
noticed	c
that	c
the	c
plays	c
and	c
the	c
films	c
were	c
a	i
good	c
entertainment	c
.	c

I	c
also	c
think	c
that	c
you	c
should	c
put	i
a	c
Snack-Bar	i
or	c
a	c
little	c
restaurant	c
so	c
as	i
the	c
people	c
are	c
not	c
too	c
hangry	i
and	c
morever	i
you	c
can	c
realise	i
big	i
benefits	i

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
in	i
the	c
whole	c
the	c
Festival	c
was	c
a	c
success	c
,	c
but	c
these	c
suggestions	c
can	c
maybe	c
help	c
you	c
to	c
improve	c
.	i

I	c
hope	c
you	c
will	c
not	c
take	c
this	c
letter	c
as	c
a	c
complaint	c
and	c
I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
going	c
to	c
the	c
next	c
festival	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

In	c
my	c
sweet	i
home	c
,	c
my	c
parents	c
let	c
me	c
do	c
what	c
I	c
want	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
an	c
adult	c
now	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
with	c
reference	c
to	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
musical	i
show	c
which	i
I	c
went	c
to	c
see	c
at	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
last	c
night	c
.	c

Being	c
a	c
theatre	c
lover	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
always	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
seeing	c
new	c
musicals	c
,	c
but	c
unfortunately	c
,	c
this	c
particular	c
one	c
was	c
very	c
disappointing	c
.	c

To	c
make	c
things	c
even	c
worse	c
,	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
roof	c
repairs	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
can	c
see	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
very	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
-	c
the	c
worst	c
one	c
during	i
my	c
week	c
's	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

Let	c
's	c
try	c
to	c
imagine	c
,	i
what	c
will	i
clothes	i
be	c
like	c
100	c
years	c
from	c
now	c
?	c

In	c
the	c
future	c
people	c
will	c
be	c
even	c
more	c
concerned	c
with	i
pollutions	i
and	c
harmful	c
UV-rays	c
.	c

With	c
so	c
many	c
choices	c
shopping	i
for	c
clothes	c
is	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
even	c
greater	i
fun	c
than	c
it	c
is	c
now	c
.	c

Fashion	i
of	c
the	c
future	c
will	c
not	c
be	c
the	c
same	c
as	c
today	c
's	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
more	c
exciting	c
and	c
fun	c
!	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
glad	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
.	c

You	c
ask	c
me	c
in	c
your	c
letter	c
when	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
.	c

First	i
one	c
is	c
Tennis	i
and	c
second	i
one	c
is	c
sailing	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
even	c
done	i
competitions	c
.	c

How	c
much	c
money	c
do	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
with	c
me	c
for	c
these	c
two	c
weeks	c
and	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
do	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
bring	c
with	c
me	c
?	c

Sometimes	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
go	c
far	c
away	c
from	c
home	c
to	c
do	c
your	c
shopping	c
and	c
it	c
takes	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
time	c
.	c

The	c
second	c
thing	c
is	c
that	c
you	c
need	c
to	c
go	c
shopping	c
when	c
the	c
supermarkets	c
are	c
open	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
almost	c
a	c
battle	c
to	c
buy	c
different	c
things	c
and	c
to	i
go	i
paying	i
those	i
things	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
the	c
information	c
it	i
was	c
ask	i
in	c
the	c
letter	c
you	c
had	i
sent	i
me	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
the	c
two	c
activities	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
do	c
while	c
I	c
am	c
camping	c
are	c
Singing	c
and	c
Basketball	c
.	c

The	c
first	c
one	c
because	c
I	c
think	c
I	c
am	c
good	c
at	c
it	c
and	c
also	c
I	c
love	c
singing	c
loudly	c
with	c
other	c
people	c
.	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
:	c

I	c
'm	c
very	c
sorry	c
I	c
have	c
n't	c
written	c
you	i
for	c
such	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
but	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
make	c
a	c
travel	i
to	c
my	c
parents	i
house	c
because	c
my	c
mother	c
was	i
operated	i
on	i
;	c
do	c
n't	c
worry	c
she	i
is	c
all	c
right	c
now	c
.	c

The	c
most	c
exciting	c
thing	c
was	c
talking	c
with	c
the	c
band	c
,	c
asking	i
questions	i
to	i
them	i
and	c
of	c
course	c
listening	c
the	i
music	c
and	c
enjoying	c
the	c
incredible	c
show	c
.	c

It	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
great	c
plessure	i
to	c
spend	c
two	c
weeks	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
and	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
find	c
any	c
suitable	c
words	c
to	c
express	c
my	c
enthusiasm	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
as	c
a	c
reply	c
for	i
your	c
letter	c
,	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
say	c
,	c
that	c
I	c
can	c
only	c
go	c
on	c
this	c
camp	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
a	c
full-time	c
job	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
essential	c
not	c
to	c
leave	c
it	c
for	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
.	c

,,Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
"	c
.	c

From	c
my	c
point	c
of	c
view	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
very	c
controversial	c
issue	c
,	c
and	c
we	c
ca	c
n't	c
just	c
easily	c
claim	c
whether	c
it	c
is	c
enjoyable	c
or	c
not	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
shopping	c
is	c
a	c
waste	c
of	c
time	c
.	c

I	c
recently	c
had	c
a	c
week	c
's	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
actually	c
very	c
disappointing	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
I	c
want	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
as	c
you	c
said	c
'	c
your	c
pefect	c
evening	c
'	c
out	c
in	c
your	c
advertisement	c
and	c
I	c
rally	i
do	c
think	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
the	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
.	c

It	c
says	c
that	c
the	c
show	c
starts	c
at	c
14:30	c
and	c
19:30	c
but	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
which	c
was	c
45	c
minutes	c
late	c
.	c

The	c
price	c
of	c
ticket	i
was	c
another	c
problem	c
.	c

Your	c
advertisement	c
says	c

I	c
really	c
do	c
think	c
you	c
need	c
to	c
organise	c
your	c
show	c
a	c
bit	c
more	c
carefully	c
so	c
you	c
do	c
not	c
make	c
these	c
mistakes	c
in	c
future	c
and	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
kind	c
of	c
you	c
if	c
you	c
give	c
my	c
money	c
back	c

Yours	c

I	c
believe	c
that	c
modern	c
technology	c
has	c
changed	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
people	c
's	c
daily	c
life	c
.	c

I	c
can	c
play	c
games	c
,	c
listen	c
to	c
music	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
can	c
do	c
my	c
course	c
works	i
in	i
the	c
computer	c
.	c

The	c
main	c
advantage	c
of	c
modern	c
technology	c
is	c
getting	c
more	c
informations	i
in	c
shorter	i
time	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
library	i
and	c
read	c
hundred	i
's	i
of	c
books	c
to	c
find	c
informations	i
anymore	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
not	c
have	c
to	c
walk	c
or	c
run	c
a	c
lot	c
to	c
go	c
somewhere	c
.	c

There	c
are	c
plenty	c
of	c
trains	c
and	c
buses	c
.	c

I	c
sometimes	c
think	c
that	c
it	c
might	c
not	c
be	c
a	c
good	c
idea	c
to	c
use	c
modern	c
technology	c
a	c
lot	c
.	c

Sir	c
,	c
Madame	i

But	c
I	c
was	c
not	c
very	c
satisfied	c
after	c
my	c
"	c
perfect	c
evening	c
"	c
out	c
.	c

The	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
Musical	c
Show	c
was	c
very	c
good	c
,	c
but	c
the	c
information	c
was	c
not	c
correct	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
advertisement	c
was	i
written	c
that	c
the	c
show	c
will	i
start	c
at	c
19.30	c
but	c
it	c
started	c
45	c
minutes	c
later	c
,	c
at	c
20.15	c
!	c

So	c
you	c
can	c
see	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
a	c
so	c
perfect	c
evening	i
for	c
me	c
then	i
I	c
thought	i
.	c

This	c
was	c
the	c
only	c
reason	c
why	c
that	i
she	c
had	c
not	c
a	i
lot	c
of	c
friends	c
.	c

When	c
Pat	c
came	i
new	i
into	c
a	c
class	c
or	c
a	c
groupe	i
of	c
teenagers	c
there	c
were	c
no	c
problems	c
.	c

So	c
they	c
stopped	c
nearly	i
immediately	i
to	i
tell	i
her	i
something	i
important	i
.	c

Sometimes	c
it	c
finished	c
like	i
this	i
that	i
the	c
others	c
only	c
said	i
:	c
"	c
Hello	c
,	c
how	c
are	c
you	c
?	c
"	c
and	i
then	c
went	i
away	c
without	c
listening	c
the	i
answer	c
.	c

During	c
the	c
day	c
she	c
worked	c
hard	c
that	i
she	c
had	i
not	c
to	i
think	i
too	c
much	c
.	c

Then	c
one	c
day	c
she	c
met	c
this	c
person	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
Katha	c
,	c
a	c
girl	c
who	c
had	c
the	c
same	c
problems	i
like	i
Pat	c
.	c

So	c
they	c
found	i
both	i
the	c
person	c
they	c
dreamed	c
from	i
.	c

Insofar	c
as	c
I	c
came	c
here	c
especially	c
to	c
see	c
him	c
play	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
very	c
deceived	i
,	c
and	c
this	c
could	c
be	c
the	c
understatement	c
of	c
the	c
year	c
,	c
inasmuch	i
as	c
he	c
is	c
my	c
favorite	i
actor	c
.	c

Apart	c
from	c
it	i
,	c
the	c
show	c
should	c
have	c
begun	c
at	c
19.30	c
and	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
!	c

Thirdly	c
,	c
the	c
ad	c
mentionned	i
possible	c
discounts	c
.	c

Personnaly	i
speaking	c
,	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
saw	i
it	i
and	c
even	i
did	i
n't	i
heard	i
of	c
it	i
:	c
I	c
have	i
asked	i
about	c
it	c
,	c
but	c
nobody	c
seemed	c
to	c
know	c
anything	c
concerning	c
discounts	c
.	c

For	c
all	c
these	c
reasons	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
,	c
dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c
that	i
you	c
give	i
me	c
my	c
money	c
back	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

was	c

with	c
you	c

Relieved	c
,	c
he	c
thought	c
that	c
bringing	c
the	c
creature	c
in	i
his	c
world	c
would	c
have	c
revealed	c
the	c
existence	c
of	c
Faerie	c
,	c
and	c
with	c
it	c
,	c
threatened	c
the	c
ecology	c
of	c
the	c
Dream	c
Landscape	c
,	c
when	c
he	c
heard	c
a	c
creepy	c
sound	c
under	c
his	c
bed	c
.	c

There	c
she	c
died	c
because	c
of	i
not	i
having	i
Faerian	i
food	c
necessary	c
to	i
her	c
survival	c
.	c

This	c
is	c
how	i
mankind	c
ca	c
n't	c
be	c
relied	c
on	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
really	c
expecting	c
to	c
see	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
my	c
favourite	c
actor	c

I	c
also	i
would	i
like	c
to	c
claim	c
some	i
refund	c
for	c
the	c
evening	c
.	c

Moreover	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
that	c
the	c
show	c
should	c
begun	i
at	c
19:30	c
but	c
it	c
started	c
with	i
a	c
delay	c

When	c
we	c
were	c
15	c
years	c
old	c
we	c
decided	c
to	c
drive	c
with	i
my	c
mother	c
's	c
car	c
on	c
a	c
day	c
when	c
my	c
parents	c
were	c
absent	c
.	c

Pat	c
promised	c
me	i
to	c
tell	c
nobody	c
about	c
our	c
purpose	i
.	c

The	c
next	c
day	c
Pat	c
told	c
me	c
that	c
he	c
wanted	c
to	c
be	c
admired	c
by	c
some	c
girls	c
and	c
so	c
he	c
had	c
to	c
tell	c
them	c
our	c
secret	c

Pat	c
and	c
I	c
have	i
still	i
been	i
good	c
friends	c
but	c
we	c
have	c
never	c
had	i
an	i
other	i
secret	c
together	i

I	c
have	c
seen	c
your	c
musical	c
show	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c

in	c
London	c

I	c
have	i
been	i
very	c
disappointed	c
when	c
I	c
had	i
read	i
your	c
advertisement	c
,	i
I	c
was	c
keen	c
on	c
your	c
show	c

I	c
have	c
not	c
seen	c
the	c

When	c
I	c
have	i
read	i
this	c
book	c
,	c
I	c
have	i
been	i
fascinated	c
by	c
the	c
will	i
of	c
the	c
old	c
fisher	i
.	c

His	c
boat	c
is	c
so	c
small	c
and	c
poor	c
,	c
he	c
is	c
old	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
hot	c
and	c
he	c
is	c
alone	c
without	c
any	c
chance	c
to	i
meet	i
someone	i
who	c
could	c
help	c
him	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
think	c
he	c
would	c
want	c
to	c
.	c

He	c
could	c
have	c
triumph	i
othe	i
fish	i
because	c
of	c
his	c
knowledge	c
of	c
the	c
sea	c
but	c
principally	i
because	c
he	c
has	c
known	i
research	i
in	c
the	c
deeper	i
of	c
his	c
mind	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
just	c
received	c
your	c
letter	c
with	i
congratulations	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
provide	c
you	c
with	c
information	c
you	c
need	c

First	c
of	c

,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
start	c
with	c
the	c
time	c
of	c
the	c
travelling	i

The	c
reasons	c
for	c
my	c
choice	c
are	c
that	c
I	c
am	c
having	c
my	c
graduation	c
exams	c
in	c
June	c
and	c
my	c
entrance	c
exams	c
in	c
August	c
.	c

That	c
is	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
keen	c
on	c
hich-hicking	i
and	c
I	c
amused	i
to	c
living	c
in	c
tents	c

As	c
to	c
the	c
activities	c
offered	c
I	i
would	c
love	c
to	c
go	c
in	c
for	c
swimming	c

photography	c
while	c
camping	c
,	c
although	c
I	c
am	c
not	c
quite	i
good	c
at	c
the	c
last	c
one	c

I	c
wonder	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
should	c
take	c
with	c
me	c

The	c

is	c
very	c

we	c
could	c

Nowadays	c
,	c
there	c
is	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
people	c
that	i
life	i
only	c
with	i
the	c
money	c
they	c
get	c
in	i
advertisments	i
,	c
reports	c
about	c
their	c
last	c
romance	c
,	i
.	c

.	c

I	c
mean	c
,	c
they	c
enjoin	i
being	c
the	c
point	i
of	i
view	i
or	c
the	c
center	i
of	i
everyone	c
,	c
even	c
though	c
it	c
means	c
to	i
see	i
their	c
lifes	i
.	c

This	c
is	c
because	c
it	c
falls	c
on	c
my	c
semester	i
holidays	c
and	c
that	i
it	c
is	c
also	c
summer	c
in	c
America	c

This	c
trip	c
will	c
give	c
me	c
a	c
chance	c
to	c
relax	c
during	c
my	c
holidays	c
,	c
as	c
well	c
as	c
allow	i
me	c
to	c
gain	c
valuable	c
knowledge	c

experience	c

Will	c
I	c
be	c
going	c
out	c
much	c
,	c
or	c
just	c
stay	i
in	c
Camp	c

all	c
the	c

Last	c
month	c
,	c
I	c
got	c
to	c
help	c
out	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c

The	c
concert	c
was	c
held	c
at	i
our	c
school	c
hall	c
.	c

Several	c
other	c
students	c
helped	c
me	c
out	c
,	c
and	c
we	c
managed	c
to	c
make	c
some	c
eye-catching	c
advertisements	c
.	c

I	c
also	c
helped	c
in	i
the	c
lighting	c
and	c
studio	c
equipment	c
.	c

I	c
enjoyed	c
fixing	i
the	c
studio	c
equipment	c
in	c
particular	c

It	c
gave	c
me	c
the	i
chance	c
to	c
expand	c

knowledge	c
and	c
gain	c
new	c
skills	c
in	c
electronics	c

hope	c
that	c
you	c
can	c
write	c
to	c

soon	c

you	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c

I	c
will	c
have	c
graduated	c
from	c
university	c
by	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
June	c
and	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
available	c
for	c
this	c
travel	i
only	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
I	c
will	c
have	c
to	c
start	c
working	c
with	c
my	c
parents	c
in	c
August	c
.	c

I	i
m	i
always	c
been	i
intents	i
when	c
I	c
went	i
with	i
the	c
university	c
camps	c
so	c
I	c
prefer	i
log	c
cabins	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
because	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
new	c
experience	c
for	c
me	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
also	c
learn	c
how	c
to	c
live	c
in	c
there	i
.	c

According	i
to	i
your	c
activities	c
at	c
the	c
Camp	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
choose	c
singing	c
and	c
painting	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
a	i
lead	c
singer	c
in	c
the	c
university	c
band	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
good	c
at	c
this	c
activity	c
.	c

Most	c
people	c
enjoy	c
going	c
shopping	c
every	c
weekend	c
but	c
some	c
think	c
that	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
because	i
of	i
different	c
reasons	c
and	c
places	i
.	c

To	c
make	c
matters	c
worse	c
,	c
you	c
forget	i
to	c
buy	c
something	c
when	c
you	c
get	c
back	c
home	c
.	c

Another	c
point	i
of	i
view	i
against	c
shopping	c
is	c
a	i
lack	c
of	c
the	i
items	c
that	c
you	c
really	c
want	c
.	c

Sometimes	c
when	i
you	c
meet	i
a	c
nice	c
dress	c
and	c
you	c
think	c
you	c
are	c
going	c
to	c
buy	c
it	c
tomorrow	c
but	c
when	c
you	c
come	c
back	c
it	c
is	c
sold	c
out	i
or	c
there	c
is	i
no	i
your	i
size	i
left	i
.	c

I	c
cannot	c
imagine	c
anything	c
worse	c
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
I	c
believe	c
that	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
if	c
you	c
accidently	i
meet	i
a	c
bad	c
situation	c
or	c
you	c
can	i
not	i
control	c
your	c
expenditure	c
carefully	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mister	i
,	c

We	c
were	c
really	c
pleased	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
our	c
first	c
time	c
in	c
England	c
.	c

We	c
were	c
very	c
disappointed	c
!	c

And	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
pay	c
£	c
20	c
each	i
seat	c
.	c

The	c
great	c
Danny	c
Brooks	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
be	c
the	c
main	c
character	c
.	c

But	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

Perhaps	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
luck	i
!	c

faithfully	c

Two	c
days	c
before	c
,	c
I	c
told	c
him	c
that	c
our	c
father	c
was	c
about	c
to	c
buy	c
a	c
brand	c
new	c
car	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
be	c
a	c
gift	c
for	c
twenty	c
years	c
of	c
marriage	c
.	c

Her	c
reaction	c
was	c
not	c
the	c
one	c
we	c
were	c
expecting	c
.	c

Really	c
angry	c
!	c
!	c

She	c
thought	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
stupid	c
idea	c
,	c
and	c
also	c
an	c
expensive	c
one	c
.	c

13.6.00	c

Also	c
I	c
am	c
pleased	c
,	i
that	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
to	c
pay	c
any	c
expenses	c
.	c

In	c
June	c
I	c
have	c
other	c
arrangements	c
,	c
such	c
as	c
my	c
school	c
exams	c
and	c
my	c
birthday	c
.	c

Hopefull	i
I	c
will	c
meet	c
some	c
other	c
girls	c
in	i
the	c
same	c
sport	c
.	c

Can	c
you	c
let	c
me	c
know	c
if	c
there	c
is	i
any	c
facilities	c
for	c
washing	c
my	c
clothes	c
If	i
not	c
I	c
will	c
bring	c
with	c
me	c
enough	c
to	c
last	c
for	c
two	c
weeks	c
.	c

Please	c
give	c
me	c
a	c
rough	c
idea	c
how	c
much	c
spending	c
money	c
I	c
will	c
need	c
.	c

Shoping	i
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

Sometimes	c
I	c
go	c
two	i
days	i
We	i
all	c
have	c
to	c
do	c
our	c
shopping	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
unavoidable	c
Sometimes	i
it	c
is	c
pleasant	c
,	c
and	c
sometimes	c
it	c
's	c
not	c
.	c

Also	c
we	c
got	i
to	c
face	c
a	c
long	c
queue	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
pay	c
.	c

I	c
find	c
it	c
very	c
tiring	c
sometimes	c
.	c

Usually	c
much	i
more	i
money	i
we	i
spend	i
than	c
we	c
expect	c
.	c

We	c
ca	c
n't	c
do	c
anything	c
about	c
is	i
.	c

We	c
have	c
to	c
face	c
it	c
-	c
it	c
has	i
both	i
sides	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
choose	c
painting	c
which	i
I	c
have	c
been	c
doing	c
for	c
12	c
years	c
and	i
tennis	c

Cry	c
Freedom	c

Woods	c
is	c
thought	c
to	c
stand	c
for	c
all	c
of	i
white	c
peope	i
and	c
this	c
book	c
could	c
have	c
an	c
influence	c
on	c
them	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
,	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
summer	c
season	i
,	c
and	c
it	i
is	i
nice	c
weather	c
to	c
enjoy	c
in	c
California	c
.	c

Lastly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
if	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
bring	c
any	c
special	c
clothes	c
,	c
and	c
where	c
can	i
I	i
change	c
my	c
money	c
to	c
American	c
dollars	c
cheaper	i
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
you	c
need	c
to	c
know	c
,	i
and	i
be	i
counscious	i
of	i
what	c
you	c
are	c
doing	c
.	c

I	c
spend	i
two	c
weeks	c
preparing	c
all	i
the	c
stage	c
,	c
speakers	c
,	c
background	i
,	c
michrophones	i
,	c
everything	c
with	i
all	c
the	c
staff	c
,	c
and	c
every	c
night	c
,	i
the	c
artists	c
came	c
to	c
rehearsal	i
their	c
show	c
,	i
I	c
could	c
see	c
how	c
they	c
really	c
improved	c
,	c
and	c
how	c
nice	c
they	c
were	c
with	c
the	c
staff	c
.	c

What	c
I	c
personally	c
liked	c
the	c
most	c
was	c
all	c
our	c
teamwork	c
.	c

Carmen	c
Dolores	c
Rossell	c
.	c

However	c
the	i
man	c
who	c
took	c
his	c
place	c
made	i
a	c
good	c
performance	c
,	c
we	c
enjoy	i
listening	c
to	c
him	c
because	c
his	c
voice	c
was	c
amazing	c
.	c

Finally	c
your	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
too	c
few	c
people	c
came	i
before	i
.	c

After	c
such	c
a	c
bad	c
show	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
want	c
to	c
eat	c
in	c
the	c
same	c
place	c
.	c

For	c
these	c
reasons	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
have	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
a	c
"	c
perfect	c
evening	c
"	c
as	c
you	c
said	c
.	c

Modern	c
technology	c
is	c
everywhere	c
in	c
our	c
society	c
.	c

But	c
it	c
is	c
also	c
the	i
technology	c
which	c
try	i
to	c
resolve	c
this	c
problem	c
with	c
new	c
way	i
of	c
transport	c
as	i
subways	c
or	c
busses	c
so	c
as	c
to	c
have	c
less	c
cars	c
in	c
the	c
cities	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
there	c
is	c
a	c
link	c
between	c
technology	c
and	c
sciences	i
because	c
they	c
need	c
each	c
other	c
:	c
sciences	i
discover	c
technologies	c
and	c
technologies	c
make	c
possible	i
new	i
searches	i
in	i
sciences	i
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
it	c
's	c
a	c
lot	c
better	c
than	c
the	c
dictionnary	i
because	c
it	c
's	c
faster	c
and	c
you	c
really	c
find	c
what	c
you	c
need	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writting	i
you	i
about	c
an	c
enjure	i
that	c
I	c
had	c
in	i
your	c
last	c
musical	c
Circle	i
Theatre	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
studiant	i
and	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
find	i
any	i
discount	i
's	i
ticket	c
.	c

And	c
finally	c
,	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
drink	i
a	c
coffee	c
but	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
!	c

Your	i
sincerely	c

For	c
exemple	i
,	c
if	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
time	c
to	c
do	c
my	c
shopping	c
after	c
school	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
do	c
my	c
homework	c
,	c
I	c
am	i
going	i
on	c
Internet	i
and	c
ask	c
for	c
what	c
I	c
need	c
.	c

In	i
my	i
point	i
of	i
vue	i
,	c
Internet	i
is	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
discover	i
of	c
the	c
2000	c
centery	i
.	c

It	c
is	c
too	c
big	c
to	c
tell	c
everybody	c
about	c
what	c
you	c
can	c
do	c
!	c

Technology	c
will	c
not	c
stop	c
to	i
grow	i
up	i
and	c
help	i
people	c
in	c
the	c
futur	i
.	c

I	c
hope	c
I	c
will	c
help	c
them	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
sure	c
I	c
will	c
!	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
there	c
were	c
no	c
discounts	c
available	c
,	c
and	c
having	c
payed	i
£	c
20	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
wait	c
45	c
minutes	c
longer	c
than	c
expected	c
since	c
the	c
show	c
began	c
at	c
20:15	c
and	c
not	c
at	c
19:30	c
.	c

His	c
acting	c
and	c
singing	c
was	i
horrible	c
.	c

You	c
see	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
the	c
"	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
"	c
,	c
as	c
you	c
had	c
promised	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
.	c

And	c
if	c
he	c
had	c
been	c
able	c
to	c
keep	c
one	c
,	c
the	c
following	c
story	c
would	c
n't	c
have	c
happened	c
.	c

What	c
was	c
the	c
reason	c
?	c

You	c
see	c
,	c
each	c
little	c
secret	c
is	c
a	c
kind	c
of	c
pressure	c
to	c
Pat	c
,	c
and	c
he	c
only	c
feels	c
free	c
if	c
he	c
can	c
tell	c
someone	c
about	c
it	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr.	c

Now	c
I	c
try	c
to	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c

International	c
Arts	c
Festival	c
which	c
took	c
place	c
these	i
21	c

November	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
according	c
to	c
your	c
advertisement	c
,	c
the	c
'	c
Stars	c
and	c
artists	c
from	c
around	c
the	c
world	c
'	c
came	c
from	c
only	c
six	c
countries	c
.	c

Thanks	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
nowadays	c
,	c
children	c
are	c
more	c
free	c
and	c
heard	i
,	i
I	c
mean	c
the	i
contact	c
between	c
them	c
and	c
adults	c
.	c

At	c
home	c
is	i
different	c
,	i
each	i
family	c
has	c
its	c
own	c
rules	c
.	c

A	c
few	c
days	c
ago	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
your	c
theatre	c
to	c
see	c
a	c
musical	c
show	c
.	c

Another	c
thing	c
is	c
that	c
I	c
took	c
a	c
particular	c
amount	c
of	c
money	c
to	c
buy	c
a	i
tickets	c
and	c
when	c
I	c
apeared	i
infrant	i
of	c
casses	i
I	c
found	c
out	c
that	c
the	c
cost	c
of	c
tickets	i
on	i
your	c
advertisement	c
and	c
real	i
price	c
was	i
n't	i
the	c
same	c
,	c
real	i
price	c
was	c
much	c
higher	c
.	c

befor	i
the	c
beggining	i
?	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forword	i

from	c

Lena	c
Jarova	c

Look	c
at	c
historical	i
books	c
400-600	i
years	c
ago	c
,	c
or	c
even	c
in	i
time	i
of	c
First	i
and	c
Second	c
World	c
War	i
,	c
how	i
are	i
sociaty	i
changed	i
,	c
just	c
because	c
we	c
did	i
step	i
up	c
in	i
the	c
science	i
and	c
technology	c
.	c

In	i
one	i
hand	i
scientist	i
discovered	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
medisent	i
from	i
different	c
illneses	i
,	c
but	c
in	i
an	i
enother	i
hand	i
they	c
discovered	c
many	c
illneses	i
about	i
which	i
we	i
have	i
n't	i
herd	i
before	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
in	c
reply	c
to	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
I	i
want	c
to	c
give	i
you	c
the	i
thanks	i
for	c
this	c
prize	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
will	i
like	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
that	c
I	c
can	c
only	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
in	c
June	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
my	c
final	c
exams	c
at	c
school	c
.	c

In	c
August	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
be	c
in	c
Madrid	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
going	c
to	c
work	c
as	c
a	c
trainee	c
in	c
a	c
travel	c
agency	c
.	c

Although	c
all	c
the	c
activities	c
that	c
you	c
mention	c
are	c
very	c
interesting	c
,	c
I	c
prefer	c
swimming	c
and	c
tennis	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
foward	i
to	c
receiving	c
your	c
reply	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

You	c
can	c
be	c
walking	c
for	c
hours	c
and	c
finally	c
you	c
ca	c
n't	c
find	c
anything	c
that	c
you	c
like	c
.	c

Also	c
,	c
you	c
can	c
spend	c
hours	c
trying	c
to	c
decide	c
between	c
a	c
wonderful	c
blue	c
trousers	i
or	c
a	c
beautiful	c
black	c
dress	c
,	c
for	c
example	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
shopping	c
is	c
even	c
more	c
boring	c
when	c
you	c
go	c
with	c
a	c
friend	c
and	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
give	c
her	c
some	c
advice	c
.	c

Despite	c
shopping	c
is	i
boring	c
I	i
think	c
that	c
it	c
is	c
necessary	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
important	c
for	c
people	c
to	c
have	c
several	c
clothes	i
and	c
also	c
suitable	c
clothes	c
for	c
a	c
very	c
important	c
meeting	c
or	c
appointment	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
,	c

This	c
presentation	c
will	c
show	c
the	c
latest	c
fashions	c
and	c
the	i
leisure	c
and	c
sports	c
wear	c
.	c

We	c
would	c
be	c
very	c
interesting	i
in	c
seeing	c
the	i
english	i
fashion	c
.	c

It	c
will	c
stay	i
in	c
the	c
Central	c
Exhibition	c
Hall	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
not	c
too	c
far	c
and	c
the	c
openning	i
hours	c
fit	i
us	c
.	c

We	c
also	c
suggest	c
to	i
visit	i
the	c
Science	c
Museum	c
or	i
Wednesday	c
morning	c
and	c
the	i
afternoon	c
,	c
if	c
some	c
one	i
of	c
us	c
is	i
intersted	i
,	c
we	c
could	c
see	c
the	c
National	c
Art	c
Gallery	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
wo	c
n't	c
be	c
too	c
angry	c
for	i
this	c
changing	i
but	c
we	c
would	c
all	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

General	i
speaking	c
,	c
homes	c
will	c
change	c
considerably	c
.	c

We	c
also	i
will	i
see	c
very	c
high	i
buildings	c
which	c
contains	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
narrow	c
flats	c
.	c

Homes	c
like	c
this	c
will	c
be	c
build	i
with	c
the	c
latest	c
technologies	c
and	c
very	i
luxurious	c
.	c

Because	c
of	c
this	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
buy	c
the	i
cheapest	c
and	c
worst	c
seat	c
available	c
.	c

Sincerely	c
,	c

In	c
spite	c
of	c
my	c
family	c
telling	c
me	c
to	c
turn	c
the	c
PC	c
off	c
and	c
talk	c
with	i
them	c
,	c
I	c
kept	c
on	c
stucked	i
in	c
front	c
of	c
the	c
screen	c
.	c

I	c
spend	c
my	c
free	c
time	c
building	c
my	c
Personal	c
Web	c
Page	c
with	c
which	c
I	c
intend	c
to	c
earn	c
money	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
;	c
and	c
I	c
also	c
check	c
the	c
weather	c
forecast	c
,	c
buy	c
food	c
and	c
pay	c
bills	c
through	c
the	c
web	c
.	c

After	c
reading	c
the	c
hole	i
organized	i
programme	c
,	c
we	c
all	c
agreed	c
about	c
the	c
sightseeing	c
by	i
bus	c
around	c
London	c
wich	i
will	c
give	c
us	c
the	c
knowledge	c
about	i
this	c
fantastic	c
city	c
we	c
all	i
want	i
to	c
meet	i
since	c
time	i
ago	c

Make	i
up	i

A	c
good	c
book	c
should	c

amuse	c
or	c
teach	c
the	c

Not	c
only	c

lots	c
of	c

I	c
like	c

Danny	i
Brook	i
,	c
and	c
his	c
unaspected	i

caused	c
on	i
me	c
a	i
big	i
sadness	c

Then	c

to	c
start	c

open	i

after	c
the	c

but	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c

this	i
way	i

The	c

was	c
closed	c

Unfortunately	c

THAT	c
DANNY	c

WAS	c
TO	c
ACT	c
IN	c
THE	c

BUT	c
THE	c
ACTOR	c
THAT	c
REALLY	c
PLAYED	c
WAS	c
DIFFERENT	i

AND	c
THIS	c
WAS	c
VERY	c
DISAPPOINTING	c

AS	c

THE	c

I	c

THAT	c

IT	c
WAS	c
NOT	c
SO	c
,	c
AND	c

MOREOVER	c

AFTER	c
THE	c

I	c
HAD	i

BEST	c
WISHES	c

SURELY	c
,	c
ORDINARY	c
PEOPLE	c
WILL	c
NOT	c
FOLLOW	c
ONLY	c
THE	c
MODELS	c
PRESENTED	c
ON	c
TV	c
,	i
AS	c
REGARDS	c
EVERYDAY	c
LIFE	c
,	c
I	c
THINK	c
THAT	c
IN	c
THE	c
FUTURE	c
ATTENTION	c
WILL	c
BE	c
FOCALIZED	i
ON	c
COMFORTABILITY	i
MORE	c
THAN	c
ON	c
ELEGANCE	c
.	c

Now	c
let	c
's	c
speak	c
about	c
the	c
most	c
interesting	c
activity	c
:	c
sport	c
.	c

In	c
fact	c
,	c
I	c
soon	i
practice	i
tennis	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
quiet	i
good	c
at	c
,	i
and	c
it	c
will	c
the	i
occasion	i
to	c
train	c
myself	i
surfing	c
is	c
completely	c
unknown	i
for	i
me	c
and	c
I	c
hope	c
that	c
I	c
will	c
like	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

We	c
know	i
all	i
what	c
shopping	c
is	c
.	c

finally	i
,	c
when	c
it	c
's	c
for	c
pleasure	c
shopping	c
is	c
enjoyable	c
,	c
but	c
most	c
of	c
time	i
it	c
is	c
n't	c
enjoyable	c
!	c

To	c
conclude	c
,	c
if	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
want	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
supermarket	c
to	c
spend	c
four	c
hours	c
there	c
,	c
send	c
your	c
girlfriend	c
and	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
more	c
enjoyable	c
!	c

I	c
also	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
if	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
money	i
and	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
are	c
suitable	c
for	c
that	c
location	c
.	c

The	c
day	c
of	c
the	c
show	c
I	c
worked	c
so	c
hard	c
that	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
see	c
the	c
spectacle	i
.	c

But	c
when	c
Britney	c
came	c
out	i
of	i
the	c
stage	c
,	c
she	c
passed	c
by	c
me	c
,	c
saw	c
my	c
tired	c
face	c
and	c
invited	c
me	c
to	i
her	c
personal	c
changing	i
room	i

Dear	c
Helen	c
,	c

It	c
's	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
for	c
me	c
participate	i
in	c
your	c
Camp	c
California	c
because	c
normaly	i
I	c
work	c
a	c
lot	c
and	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
spend	c
money	c
to	i
travel	c
,	i
moreover	i
,	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
maintain	i
my	i
big	c
family	c
because	c
I	c
'm	c
married	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
three	c
children	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
before	c
I	i
have	c
to	c
work	c
with	c
my	c
father	c
because	c
he	c
's	c
ill	c
.	c

For	c
de	i
accommodation	c
I	c
prefer	i
a	c
long	i
cabin	c
because	c
it	i
's	i
more	c
comfortable	c
.	c

I	c
know	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
the	c
chance	c
to	c
do	c
two	c
activities	c
during	c
this	c
time	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
surfing	c
or	c
climbing	c
but	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
think	c
in	i
my	c
helth	i

Sometimes	c
,	c
they	c
have	c
to	c
buy	c
something	c
that	c
they	c
need	c
but	c
frequently	i
,	c
they	c
buy	c
only	i
to	c
spend	c
money	c
.	c

This	c
is	c
a	c
big	c
problem	c
because	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
families	c
have	i
n't	i
money	c
,	i
however	i
spend	i
going	c
shopping	c
.	c

We	c
have	c
to	c
teach	c
to	i
our	c
children	c
the	c
value	c
of	c
the	i
money	c
,	c
to	c
explain	c
the	c
difficulties	c
to	i
earn	i
money	c
in	c
a	c
job	c
,	c
because	c
we	c
have	c
to	c
work	c
eight	c
,	c
nine	c
or	c
ten	c
hours	c
a	c
day	c
,	c
for	c
example	c

It	i
's	i
a	i
first	i

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
,	c

The	c
show	c
started	c
later	i
at	i
20:15	c
which	i
was	c
very	c
different	c
in	i
'	c
19.30	c
'	c
as	i
shown	i
.	c

Please	c
would	c
you	c
also	c
change	c
the	c
advertisement	c
to	i
the	i
level	i
of	i
the	c
actual	c
facts	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

The	c
fashion	c
of	i
nowaday	i
clothings	i
is	i
just	c
keep	i
on	c
changing	c
.	c

They	c
can	c
wear	c
different	c
kinds	c
of	c
clothing	c
,	c
like	i
they	i
design	i
for	i
themselves	i
or	i
those	i
like	i
history	i
can	i
wear	i
those	i
of	i
victorian	i
time	i
and	i
in	i
different	i
countries	i
.	c

For	i
the	c
colours	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
the	i
metalic	i
colours	c
,	c
especially	c
silver	c
,	c
will	c
be	c
the	c
most	c
popular	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
fan	c
of	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
but	c
he	c
was	c
absent	c
because	c
of	i
sick	c
.	c

It	c
made	i
me	i
disappointed	i
very	c
much	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
he	c
made	c
many	c
mistakes	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
although	c
we	c
had	c
booked	c
the	c
tickets	c
3	c
days	c
before	c
we	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
,	c
we	c
could	c
not	c
be	c
given	c
any	c
discounts	c
only	c
because	c
we	c
had	c
done	i
at	c
a	c
travel	c
agency	c
.	c

Yours	c

Fashion	c
of	c
the	c
Future	c

In	i
these	i
days	i
,	c
new	c
fashions	c
have	i
been	i
passing	i
by	i
very	c
quickly	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
short	c
skirts	c
and	c
tops	c
like	c
an	i
under-wear	i
.	c

It	c
might	c
be	c
possible	c
that	c
the	c
fish-pattern	i
come	i
up	i
in	c
100	c
years	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
fashion	c
changes	c
too	c
fast	c
to	c
predict	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c

Anyway	c
we	c
can	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
Science	c
Museum	c
on	c
Wednesday	c
afternoon	c
because	c
we	c
have	c
a	i
free	c
time	c
.	c

We	c
do	c
n't	c
need	c
to	c
pay	c
,	i
it	i
's	i
for	i
free	c
because	c
we	c
are	c
students	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
because	c
in	c
our	c
fast	i
developing	i
world	c
we	c
have	c
to	c
look	c
fashionable	c
and	c
this	c
kind	c
of	c
show	c
happens	c
quite	c
rare	i
.	c

As	c
I	c
said	c
we	c
can	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
Science	c
Museum	c
on	c
Wednesday	c
instead	c
of	c
having	c
a	i
free	c
time	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
.	c

We	c
ca	c
n't	c
say	c
straight	i
away	i
how	c
the	i
people	c
's	c
homes	c
will	c
be	c
different	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
but	c
we	c
can	c
always	c
imagine	c
and	c
create	i
the	i
unbelievable	i
things	c
about	c
future	i
life	i
.	c

The	c
rooms	c
will	c
be	c
much	c
bigger	c
and	c
wider	c
than	c
now	c
,	c
and	c
you	c
can	i
have	c
up	c
to	c
twenty	c
rooms	c
in	c
your	c
own	c
flat	c
,	c
and	c
even	c
swiching	i
on	c
the	c
light	c
by	c
saying	c
only	i
;	i
"	c
light	i
"	c
.	c

Now	c
what	c
's	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
the	c
same	c
.	i

The	i
same	i
problem	i
will	i
be	i
with	i
homeless	i
people	i
who	i
does	i
n't	i
have	i
money	i
at	i
all	i
,	i
even	i
to	i
buy	i
a	i
food	i
for	i
themselves	i
.	c

They	c
will	c
have	c
to	c
stay	c
on	c
the	c
streets	c
as	c
streets	i
is	i
their	c
home	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

There	i
problems	c
were	c
;	i
Firstly	i
,	c
the	c
famous	c
actors	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
were	c
n't	c
there	c
for	i
your	c
musical	i
show	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
unhappy	c
to	c
constat	i
that	c
it	i
was	i
different	c
actors	c
this	i
evening	c
.	c

Fourthly	i
,	c
the	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
for	c
renovations	i
and	c
you	c
do	i
n't	i
have	c
to	i
propose	i
us	i
to	i
go	i
.	c

That	c
's	c
why	c
I	c
ask	c
you	c
to	c
give	c
my	i
money	c
back	c
.	c

I	c
ask	c
you	c
give	i
me	c
£	c
20	c
,	c
back	c
by	c
check	i
.	c

How	c
has	c
modern	c
technology	c
changed	c
your	c
daily	c
life	c
?	c

It	i
is	i
now	i
ten	i
years	i
that	i
Internet	i
exists	i
,	c
but	c
we	c
only	c
used	i
it	c
for	c
army	c
and	c
government	c
.	i

All	i
our	i
life	c
is	c
symplifying	i
by	c
the	i
machines	c
for	i
not	i
waste	i
the	i
time	i
to	i
work	i
on	i
their	i
developpment	i
.	c

Dear	c
Ms	c
Clark	c
,	c

I	c
write	c
you	c
this	c
letter	c
because	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
my	i
experiences	c
of	i
the	c
festival	c
.	c

I	c
have	i
spent	i
two	c
days	c
at	c
the	c
"	c
International	c
Arts	c
Festival	c
"	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
good	c
event	c
but	c
I	c
think	c
some	c
details	i
could	c
be	c
better	c
the	c
next	c
time	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
small	c
offer	i
;	c
I	c
hope	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
larger	c
the	c
next	c
time	c
.	c

But	c
do	c
not	c
worry	c
!	c

There	c
have	i
also	i
taken	i
place	i
very	c
good	c
attractions	i
like	c
dance	i
shows	c
,	c
the	c
art	c
exhibition	c
and	c
listening	i
to	i
talks	i
by	i
writers	c
,	i

The	c
reasonably-priced	c
weekend	c
ticket	c
was	c
a	c
very	c
good	c
idea	c
.	c

Please	c
tell	c
my	i
your	c
opinion	c
about	c
this	c
.	c

Best	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c

Most	c
of	c
the	c
time	c
when	c
we	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
shopping	c
Center	i
we	c
have	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
fun	c
,	i
we	i
go	c
to	c
stores	c
to	c
see	i
cloth	i
,	c
we	c
also	c
eat	c
something	c
like	c
ice	c
cream	c
or	c
French	c
Fries	c
,	c
but	c
not	i
all	i
the	i
time	i
shopping	i
is	i
enjoyable	i
.	c

Sometimes	c
when	c
we	c
go	c
shopping	c
with	c
someone	c
who	c
is	c
not	c
a	i
good	c
company	c
,	c
we	c
usually	i
do	c
n't	c
have	c
a	c
great	c
time	c
,	c
or	c
when	c
we	c
know	c
what	c
we	c
want	c
to	c
buy	c
,	c
but	c
when	c
we	c
get	c
to	c
the	c
store	c
they	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
what	c
we	c

in	i
that	i

we	i
neat	i
to	i

also	i
when	i
is	i
an	i
important	i
day	i
like	i
Father	i

day	i
or	i
christmas	i
every	i
where	i
we	i
want	i
to	i
go	i
and	i
buy	i
something	i
is	i
very	c
crowd	i
so	c
we	c
ca	c
n't	c
find	c
what	c
we	c
are	c
looking	c
for	c
with	i
calm	i
because	c
everybody	c
is	c
pushing	c
you	c
to	i
the	i
other	i

that	i
you	i
want	i
to	i
go	i

In	i
that	i
cases	i
is	i
when	i
we	c
do	c
n't	c

we	c
ca	c
n't	c
find	c
what	c
we	c

I	c
'm	c
glad	c
to	c
receive	c
your	c
letter	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
if	c
there	c
are	c
any	c
washing	c
machines	c
or	c
a	c
place	c
to	c
wash	c
our	c
clothes	c
.	c

Maybe	c
for	c
women	c
,	c
but	c
not	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

And	c
of	c
course	c
,	c
we	c
are	c
not	c
allowed	c
to	c
stop	c
in	c
a	c
place	c
that	c
we	c
like	c
.	c

You	c
cannot	c
lose	i
the	i
time	c
because	c
all	c
the	c
other	c
shops	c
could	c
be	c
closed	c
when	c
you	c
arrive	c
.	c

Another	c
point	c
is	c
to	c
go	c
a	i
big	c
area	c
.	c

Someone	c
could	c
be	c
injured	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
the	c
play	c
started	c
almost	c
an	c
hour	c
late	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
went	c
there	c
to	c
see	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
but	c
there	c
was	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
on	c
stage	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
the	i
discounts	c
are	i
available	c
but	c
in	i
the	i
tickets	i
I	i
bought	i
they	i
were	i
no	i
discount	i
.	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
planned	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
great	c
dinner	c
with	c
my	c
family	c
in	c
your	c
restaurant	c
and	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
the	c
people	c
who	c
work	c
in	i
were	c
on	c
holidays	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
be	c
grateful	c
if	c
you	c
do	i
it	i
.	c

Your	i
sincerely	c

Nowadays	c
,	c
technology	c
is	c
the	c
most	c
useful	c
tool	c
that	c

have	c

years	c

and	c
the	c
career	c
I	c
have	c
choosen	i
is	c
Internacional	i
Commerce	c
or	c
Market	i

I	c
use	c

every	c

I	c
did	c
not	c
realise	c

To	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
's	c
manager	c

We	c
had	c
to	c
pay	c
£	c
15	c
each	c
for	i
seeing	i
a	c
miserable	c
pieces	i
.	c

I	c
'm	c
sure	c
we	c
'll	c
find	c
a	c
compromise	c
and	c
I	c
'm	c
really	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c

An	c
unusual	c
part	c
of	c
life	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
,	c
and	c
half	c
a	c
week	c
later	c
,	c
all	c
the	c
school	c
knew	c
about	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
became	i
quickly	i
bored	c
by	c
this	c
hypocrital	i
attention	c
they	c
had	i
for	i
me	c
.	c

I	c
always	c
has	i
been	c
involved	c
in	c
many	c
differents	i
associations	c
,	c
which	c
are	c
fighting	c
against	c
AIDS	c
or	c
cancer	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
whole	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
really	c
disappointed	c
at	c
that	c
time	c
.	c

And	c
they	c
will	c
use	c
soft	c
cozy	c
cloths	i
like	c
cotton	c
and	c
silk	c
.	c

Some	c
of	c
that	c
will	c
be	c
very	c
strange	c
to	c
our	c
eyes	c
,	c
but	c
some	c
of	c
others	i
will	c
be	c
familiar	c
to	c
us	c
.	c

Just	c
imagine	c
the	c
way	i
of	i
future	i
people	i
's	i
life	i

And	c
you	c
can	c
see	c
the	i
their	c
clothes	c
also	c

about	c
prices	c
to	i

At	i

Yours	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
it	c
dependes	i
on	c
your	c
mood	c
,	c
your	c
financial	c
ability	i
,	c
off	i
course	i
where	i
you	c
are	c
going	c
to	c
do	i
shopping	c
and	c
what	c
you	c
are	c
going	c
to	c
buy	c

You	c
've	c
just	c
finished	c
your	c

You	c

,	c
you	c
feel	c
fed	c
up	c

finaly	i
when	c
you	c

you	c
think	c
that	c

not	c
that	i
enjoyable	c
as	c
you	c
thought	c
.	c

It	c
takes	c
hours	c
to	c
buy	c
something	c

And	c
people	c

all	c

you	c

preferences	c
and	c
ask	c
a	c
few	c
questions	c
about	c
the	c
camping	c
.	c

I	c
know	c
that	c
staying	c
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
is	c
more	c
convinient	i
but	c
I	c
just	c
want	c
to	c
feel	i
wilder	i
experience	c
.	c

It	c
will	c
be	c
a	c
wonderful	c
experience	c
to	c
swim	c
in	c
a	c
lake	c
and	c
I	c
can	c
relax	c
and	c
enjoy	c
fresh	i
air	c
.	c

Photography	c
is	c
one	c
of	c
my	c
hobbies	c
so	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
take	c
nice	i
photos	i
in	i
the	i
camp	i
area	i
as	i
many	i
as	i
I	i
can	i
.	c

And	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
know	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
carry	i
for	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
,	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
travel	c
only	c
July	i
because	c
my	c
son	c
's	c
school	c
is	c
going	c
to	c
finish	c
at	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
June	c
,	c
so	c
it	c
is	c
impossible	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
travel	c
during	c
on	i
June	c
.	c

Beside	i
this	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
playing	c
basketball	c
.	c

All	i
seats	i
were	i
brought	i
from	i
a	i
sponsor	i
company	i
.	c

At	i
the	c
concert	i
night	i
,	c
I	c
worked	c
as	c
well	c
.	c

The	c
best	c
thing	c
was	c
of	c
course	c
Tina	i
.	c

For	c
the	c
accommodation	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
have	c
tents	i
because	c
I	c
used	i
to	i
travel	i
in	i
Campsites	i
and	c
I	c
love	c
it	c
during	c
summer	c
,	c
just	i
to	i
change	i
the	i
customs	i
!	c
!	c

Concerning	c
those	i
activities	c
I	i
have	c
choosen	i
two	c
of	c
them	c
.	c

See	c
you	c
soon	c
!	c

Yours	c
Sincerely	i

You	i
decide	c
to	i
go	i
in	i
town	i
or	i
during	i
holidays	i
to	i
move	i
in	i
a	i
"	i
shopping	i
destination	i
"	i
,	c
that	c
is	i
mean	i
that	c
you	c
need	c
something	c
special	c
for	c
you	i
or	c
someone	c
else	c
.	c

Save	c
some	c
money	c
to	c
go	c
for	i
shopping	c
in	c
Paris	c
or	c
Roma	c
and	c
see	c
how	c
is	i
the	c
French	c
or	c
Italian	c
fashion	c
on	i
yourself	i
!	c
and	i
after	c
that	c
you	c
can	c
make	i
a	i
stop	i
in	i
the	c
Duty-free	i
and	i
buy	c
some	c
chipper	i
souvenirs	c
.	c

But	c
even	c
if	c
shopping	c
can	i
means	i
dream	i
it	c
can	c
be	c
boring	c
sometimes	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
have	c
no	c
money	c
and	c
a	c
friend	c
ask	i
you	c
to	c
come	i
for	i
shopping	c
,	c
it	c
should	c
be	c
boring	c
!	c
and	i
you	c
become	i
jealous	c
against	i
him	c
and	c
want	c
him	c
to	c
do	c
that	i
quickly	c
!	c
or	i
you	c
are	i
going	i
to	i
get	c
nervous	i
!	c

And	c
you	c
can	c
find	c
too	i
much	i
people	c
in	c
shops	i
,	c
it	c
is	c
too	c
hot	c
or	c
you	c
can	i
not	i
have	i
your	i
right	c
size	c
or	c
the	c
right	c
colour	c
or	c
flavour	c
--	c
-	c
then	c
you	c
get	c
angry	c
!	c
or	i
you	c
decide	c
to	i
not	i
spend	i
money	i
in	i
shopping	c
today	c
,	c
but	c
in	i
front	i
of	i
the	i
shop	i
.	c

What	c
is	c
going	c
on	c
?	c
?	c

Firstly	c
,	c
your	c
advertisement	c
said	c
the	c
actor	c
would	c
be	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
.	c

It	c
played	i
an	i
other	i
one	i
who	c
played	c
very	c
bad	i
.	c

It	c
was	c
boring	c
that	c
nothing	c
happend	i
such	i
a	c
long	c
time	c
on	c
the	c
stage	c
.	c

Did	c
you	c
know	c
that	c
you	c
have	c
no	c
discounts	c
on	c
your	c
tickets	c
?	c

This	i
are	c
too	c
many	c
negatives	i
points	c
for	c
one	c
evening	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
do	c
not	c
disappoint	c
my	i
in	i
this	c
point	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
important	c
and	c
necessary	c
to	c
think	c
about	c
it	c
,	c
because	c
our	c
children	c
will	c
live	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
.	c

Maybe	c
in	c
500	c
years	c
,	c
some	c
people	c
will	c
live	c
on	c
the	i
Mars	c
and	c
then	c
,	i
they	c
have	i
to	c
wear	c
other	c
kind	i
of	c
clothes	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
think	c
this	i
clothes	c
are	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
a	c
fashion	c
on	c
the	c
earth	c
.	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
enquire	c
you	i
about	c
some	c
doubts	i
and	c
to	c
give	c
information	i
that	c
you	c
need	c
about	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
been	c
working	c
hard	c
here	c
in	c
Portugal	c
and	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
on	c
holiday	c
just	c
in	i
next	c
july	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
tents	i
because	c
I	c
suppose	c
I	c
will	c
have	c
more	c
contact	c
with	c
natural	c
things	c
than	c
in	c
log	i
cabins	i
.	c

Are	c
they	c
inclued	i
in	c
the	c
prize	c
?	c

I	c
am	c
look	i
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
dream	c
and	c
she	c
was	c
amazing	c
with	i
me	i
.	c

Of	c
course	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
tired	c
at	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
five	c
days	c
because	c
of	c
some	c
stressed	i
situations	c
.	c

With	c
best	c
wishes	c
,	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
on	i
July	c
,	c
since	c
I	c
am	c
studying	c
and	c
that	c
is	c
the	c
only	c
month	c
I	c
have	c
for	i
vacation	c
.	c

Fortunately	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
heard	c
that	c
weather	i
is	c
beautiful	c
in	c
California	c
during	c
that	c
month	c
.	c

Singing	c
is	c
something	c
I	c
have	c
enjoyed	c
since	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
little	c
child	c
.	c

How	c
much	c
money	c
will	c
I	c
need	c
?	c

Thanks	c
for	c
your	c
attention	c

The	c
best	c
way	c
to	c
go	c
shopping	c
is	c
when	i
you	i
think	i
in	c
advance	c
what	i
you	c
really	c
want	c
to	c
buy	c
and	c
you	i
know	i
how	i
much	i
money	i
you	i
estimate	i
to	i
spend	i
.	c

There	c
is	c
no	c
way	c
to	c
find	c
good	c
prices	c
!	c

It	c
may	c
seem	c
relaxing	c
at	c
the	c
beginning	c
,	c
but	c
if	c
they	c
take	c
their	c
credit	c
cards	c
with	c
them	c
,	c
the	c
stress	c
will	c
increase	c
when	c
they	c
have	c
to	c
pay	c
for	i
the	c
bills	c

Recommendations	c
?	c

I	c
will	c
be	c
very	c
happy	c
to	c
travel	c

because	c
in	c
that	c
date	i
I	c
am	c
going	c
to	c
have	c
my	c
holidays	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
will	c
not	c
have	c
to	c
ask	c
permition	i
from	c
my	c
work	i
.	c

The	c
reason	c
of	i
my	c
option	i
for	i
singing	c
is	c
couse	i
I	c
feel	c
embarrest	i
about	c
my	c
voice	c
,	c
so	c
maybe	c
I	c
could	c
get	i
it	i
better	i
.	c

I	c
will	i
like	c
to	c
have	c
more	c
information	c
about	c
the	c
prices	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
:	c

You	c
are	c
never	c
going	c
to	c
believe	c
what	c
I	c
did	c
last	c
month	c
I	i
was	c
walking	c
with	c
my	c
sister	c
in	c
Oxford	c
circus	c
,	c
when	c
sudently	i
a	c
man	c
stop	i
us	c
saying	c
that	c
he	c
was	c
looking	c
for	c
people	c
to	c
help	c
in	i
a	c
concert	c
and	c
they	c
was	i
going	c
to	c
pay	c
us	c
five	c
pounds	c
an	c
hour	c

Saturday	c
,	c

2000	c
.	c

As	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
anxious	c
to	c
see	c
that	c
show	c
,	c
I	c
planned	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
in	i
the	i
last	c
holiday	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
completely	c
disappointed	c
with	c
that	i
.	c

Then	c
,	c
to	c
complete	c
this	c
terrible	c
night	c
,	c
the	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

I	c
wonder	c
you	i
could	c
explain	c
me	i
why	c
.	c

Due	c
to	c
my	c
huge	c
dissatisfaction	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
,	c
as	c
you	c
do	c
not	c
make	i
what	c
was	c
advertised	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c

Every	c
day	c
,	c
the	c
growth	c
of	c
the	i
modern	c
technology	c
increases	c
in	c
the	c
whole	c
world	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
becoming	c
essential	c
in	c
everybody	c
's	c
life	c
.	c

Today	c
,	c
almost	c
no	c
one	c
can	c
live	c
without	c
,	c
for	c
example	c
,	c
a	c
television	c
,	c
a	c
radio	c
or	c
electricity	c
in	c
their	c
homes	c

Another	i
bad	c
points	c
can	c
be	c
mentioned	c
,	c
like	c
the	i
polution	i
for	c
example	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
disappointed	c
and	c
upset	c
with	c
the	c
show	c
I	c
saw	c

Tina	c

performed	c

but	c
him	c
I	i
think	c
he	c
is	c
a	c
"	c
street	c
actor	c
"	c
from	c
Covent	c
Garden	c
.	c

The	c
only	c
thing	c
to	c
do	c
is	c
:	c
to	c
compensate	c
me	c
,	c
send	c
my	i
money	c
back	c
,	i
I	c
am	c
sending	c
my	c
ticket	c
for	c
that	c
:	i
Hope	c
you	c
'll	c
be	c
fair	c

I	c
am	c

I	c
am	c

that	c
I	c

good	c
tecnologies	i
like	i
my	c

the	c

Indeed	c

changed	c
our	c
lives	c
,	c
we	c
have	c
become	c
more	c
scepitical	i
and	c
cold	c

Sometimes	c
I	c
think	c

is	c
not	c
a	c
good	c
thing	c

Thanks	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c

I	c
have	c
reading	i
the	c

and	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
surprised	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
the	c
first	c

About	c
the	c
time	c
when	c
I	c
like	i
to	c
travel	c
is	i
only	i
July	c
,	c
because	c
in	c
the	c
summer	c
is	i
it	i
very	c
busy	c
at	c
work	c
.	c

At	i
second	i
,	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
like	c
tents	c
and	c
I	c
do	i
n't	i
get	c
used	c
to	c
it	i
,	c
so	c
I	c
prefer	c
log	c
cabins	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

With	i
me	i
is	i
everything	i
fine	i
and	c
the	c
pop	c
concert	c
was	c
great	c
.	c

I	c
enjoyed	c
helping	c
at	c
the	c
popconcert	i
,	c
but	c
it	c
's	c
very	c
stressful	c
work	c
.	c

You	c
always	c
walk	c
from	c
side	c
to	c
side	c
to	i
move	i
things	c
and	c
there	c
's	c
no	c
break	c
.	c

We	c
have	i
worked	i
the	c
whole	c
day	c
and	c
luckily	c
at	c
least	c
we	c
had	c
some	c
food	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
inform	c
you	c
about	c
your	c
question	c
.	c

At	i
first	i
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
go	i
travel	c
on	i
July	c
,	c
because	c
before	c
them	i
I	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
time	c
to	c
travel	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
so	c
much	i
.	c

Generally	c
many	c
women	c
would	i
like	i
the	i
shopping	c
include	i
me	c
.	c

Perhaps	c
you	c
have	c
an	c
experience	i
unpleased	i
.	c

You	c
could	c
go	c
shopping	c
for	c
some	c
rest	c
to	c
the	c
high	c
street	c
or	c
a	c
department	c
store	c
.	c

Moreover	c
you	i
bought	c
something	c
then	c
you	c
could	c
find	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
little	c
bit	c
expensive	i
than	c
the	c
other	c
shop	c
.	c

Both	c
cases	c
are	i
often	i
happened	i
in	i
shopping	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
want	c
to	c
regret	c
about	i
shopping	c
,	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
make	c
a	c
shopping	c
list	c
firstly	i
before	c
going	c
shopping	c
.	c

Moreover	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
expected	c
to	c
begin	c
at	c
19.30	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
delayed	c
of	i
forty-five	c
minutes	c
.	c

You	c
had	c
promised	c
a	c
perfect	c
evening	c
but	c
I	c
spend	i
an	i
horrible	c
one	c
and	i
you	c
ruined	c
my	c
holiday	c
!	c

Now	c
!	c

To	c
begin	c
with	c
,	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
underline	c
how	c
the	c
place	i
of	c
technology	c
has	c
increased	c
since	i
a	c
couple	c
of	c
years	c
.	c

With	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
the	c
Second	c
world	c
war	c
and	c
the	c
economic	i
prosperity	c
many	i
goods	c
like	c
TV	i
,	c
washing-machine	i
,	c
etc.	c
became	c
cheaper	c
and	c
available	i
.	c

Do	c
they	c
affect	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
?	c

As	c
far	c
as	c
I	c
am	c
concerned	c
,	c
the	c
first	c
way	c
modern	c
technology	c
influence	i
me	c
is	c
in	i
my	c
work	c
:	c
the	c
internet	i
has	c
become	c
such	c
an	c
incredible	c
tool	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
make	i
research	c
about	i
everything	c
I	c
want	c
,	c
find	c
informations	i
for	c
lectures	c
for	i
example	c
or	i
exercices	i
.	c

But	c
we	c
should	c
not	c
forget	c
that	c
it	i
's	i
only	c
tools	c
and	c
emphazise	i
human	c

It	c

I	c

when	c
I	c
bumped	c
into	c
Jane	c

asked	c

if	c

a	c

None	c

were	i

I	c
belive	i
they	c
are	c
well	c
on	c

Lots	c
of	c
Kisses	i
from	c

I	c
am	i
recently	i
spending	i
a	c
week	c
's	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
just	c
visited	c
your	c
theatre	c
to	c
see	c
a	c
musical	c
show	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
complain	c
with	i
couple	i
of	c
things	c
.	c

First	c
,	c
I	c
like	i
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
main	c
features	i
which	i
is	c
an	c
actor	c
,	i
he	i
might	c
have	i
been	i
well	c
known	c
in	c
England	c
,	c
but	c
on	c
the	c
night	c
,	c
he	c
performed	c
abysmally	c
.	c

We	c
always	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
same	c
school	c
,	c
and	c
he	i
's	i
often	c
make	i
more	c
friends	c
than	c
I	c
do	c
,	c
and	c
everytime	i
he	i
's	i
always	i
introduce	i
them	i
to	i
me	i
.	c

Although	c
,	c
we	c
are	c
great	c
friends	c
,	c
but	i
sometimes	c
people	c
can	c
make	c
such	c
a	i
stupid	c
mistake	i
,	c
and	c
so	c
there	c
was	c
one	c
time	c
when	c
Pat	c
and	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
fight	c
,	i
it	i
all	c
started	c
when	c
once	c
I	c
accidently	i
,	i
took	c
the	c
wrong	c
bag	c
back	c
to	c
my	c
house	c
,	c
and	c
there	c
was	i
lady	c
's	c
knickers	c
inside	c
,	i
I	c
was	c
so	c
nervous	c
and	c
embarassing	i
,	c
so	c
I	c
tell	i
Pat	c
and	c
there	i
he	i
goes	i
,	i
he	c
tell	i
every	c
single	c
students	i
in	c
the	c
school	c
that	c
I	i
've	i
stolen	c
girl	i
knickers	c
,	c
and	c
everyone	c
started	c
to	c
call	c
me	c
a	c
pervert	c
.	c

Anyway	c
Pat	i
eventually	c
apologized	c
to	c
me	c
and	c
we	c
still	i
being	i
best	c
mates	c
as	c
ever	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
expected	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
fantastic	c
musical	c
show	c
.	c

Even	c
though	c
they	c
performed	c
their	c
parts	c
excellently	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
disappointed	c
about	c
your	c
incorrect	c
advertisement	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
the	c
musical	c
was	c
not	c
started	c
on	c
time	c
.	c

Afterall	i
,	c
I	c
lost	i
my	c
find	i
return	c
train	c
after	c
show	i
.	c

thirdly	i
,	c
there	c
was	c
no	c
discount	c
about	i
my	c
ticket	c
and	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
of	c
being	c
repaired	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
I	c
want	c
you	c
to	c
give	i
my	i
money	i
back	i
to	i
me	i
.	c

Yeung	c

However	c
,	c
After	i
appearing	i
Internet	i
,	c
I	i
've	i
sent	i
e-mail	c
to	c
my	c
friends	c

I	c
just	c
check	c
my	c
e-mail	c
before	c
going	c
to	c

everyday	i

Mrs	i
Ryan	c

To	c
answer	c
your	c
second	c
question	c
,	c
I	c
choose	c
the	i
accomodation	i
in	c
tents	i
because	c
I	c
like	c
to	c
sleep	c
outside	c
.	c

For	c
the	c
activities	c
,	c
I	c
choose	c
the	c
Golf	i
and	c
the	c
Surfing	i
(	c
that	i
was	c
n't	c
easy	c
to	c
decide	c
which	c
activities	c
I	c
will	c
do	c
,	c
cause	i
almost	c
choice	i
interested	c
me	c
)	c

I	c
never	i
did	i
surfing	c
,	c
but	c
every	c
time	c
I	c
see	c
surfing	c
on	c
television	c
I	c
find	c
this	i
magic	i

Please	c
phone	c
me	c

answer	c
my	c
two	c
questions	c

Thanks	c
for	c
all	i

With	c
my	c
friend	c
Miko	c
we	i
looked	c
for	c
a	i
little	i
job	i
during	i
a	i
week-end	i
and	c
one	c
evening	c
we	c
met	c
a	c
guy	c
who	c
wanted	c
to	c
buy	i
some	i
drinks	c
in	i
the	c
pop	c
concert	c
and	c
so	c
we	c
told	c
him	c
that	c
we	c
were	i
agree	i
to	c
help	c
him	c
at	c
the	c
bar	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
wonderful	c
week-end	i
:	c
we	c
were	c
opposite	c
to	i
the	c
singers	c
and	c
we	c
have	i
seen	i
every	c
concert	c
without	c
buying	c
any	c
tickets	c
entry	i
!	c
(	c
we	i
were	c
include	i
in	i
the	c
staff	c
of	c
the	c
concert	c
)	i

For	c
next	c
year	c
we	c
search	i
for	c
a	c
new	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

I	c
felt	c
very	c
upset	c
about	c
you	i
advertisement	c
was	c
totaly	i
different	c
between	i
the	i
musical	c
show	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
p.m	i
instead	c
of	c
19:30	c
p.m.	i
Thirdly	c
,	c
a	i
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
being	i
closed	c
.	c

How	c
dared	i
you	i
could	i
show	i
"	c
You	i
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
"	c
in	c
you	i
advertisement	c
.	c

And	c
explain	c
what	c
had	c
happened	c
.	c

Thank	c
for	i
you	i
patience	i
.	c

Although	i
,	i
Pat	c
is	c
very	c
smart	c
and	c
intelligent	c
.	c

She	c
has	c
a	i
open-mind	i
.	c

So	c
,	c
she	c
got	i
many	c
friend	i

She	c
enjoyed	c
sharing	c
everthing	i
with	c
Pat	c
whatever	i
what	i
it	c
was	c
.	c

Her	c
husband	c
was	i
being	i
fried	i
last	i
year	c
.	c

Pat	c
also	c
promised	c
not	c
to	c
tell	c
other	c
people	c
.	c

This	c
let	i
Nick	c
very	c
embrassed	i
and	c
got	i
hurt	c
.	c

Today	c
,	c
Pat	c
and	c
Lily	c
still	i
are	i
friend	i
.	c

.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
to	c
be	c
sure	c
it	c
would	c
not	c
rain	c
during	c
the	c
trip	c
which	i
is	i
boring	i
?	c
!	c

But	c
you	c
ca	c
n't	c
play	c
if	c
there	c
is	c
too	c
much	c
wind	c
,	c
the	i
ball	c
becomes	c
incontrolable	i
!	c

you	i
need	c
technics	i
to	c
move	i
the	c
windsurf	i
.	c

You	c
must	c
know	c
how	c
to	c
use	c
the	c
wind	c
and	c
you	i
have	i
great	i
sensations	i
!	c

you	i
have	c
recently	c
had	c
a	c
class	c
discussion	c
about	c
shopping	c
.	c

You	c
can	c
hesitate	c
to	i
choose	i
an	c
article	i
.	c

You	c
do	c
n't	c
find	c
your	i
size	i
or	i
the	i
good	i
color	i
in	i
the	i
article	i
.	c

The	c
article	i
can	c
be	c
too	c
expensive	c
.	c

Now	c
my	c
dream	c
will	c
come	c
true	c
.	c

About	c
accommodation	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
a	c
tent	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
slept	c
in	c
the	i
tent	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
try	c
it	c
.	c

It	c
will	c
be	c
very	c
interesting	c
for	c
me	c
because	c
normaly	i
I	c
have	i
not	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
time	c
to	c
do	c
activities	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
the	c
letter	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
an	i
answer	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
now	i
I	c
was	c
helping	c
to	c
make	c
every	i
decorations	c
before	c
and	c
during	c
the	c
concert	c
.	c

I	c
will	c
never	c
forget	c
this	c
concert	c
and	c
those	c
people	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
again	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

Many	c
years	c
ago	c
people	c
did	c
n't	c
have	c
an	c
oppotunity	i
to	c
use	c
all	c
these	c
things	c
and	c
they	c
had	c
to	c
work	c
a	c
lot	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
happy	c
that	c
with	c
all	c
technology	i
that	c
we	c
have	c
we	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
to	c
work	c
as	c
much	c
as	c
they	c
did	c
,	c
like	i
to	i
wash	i
plates	c
and	c
cups	c
after	c
meals	c
,	i
my	i
dishwashing	i
machine	i
will	c
do	c
that	c
for	c
me	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
to	c
wash	c
my	c
clothes	c
my	i
washing	c
machine	c
does	c
it	c
better	c
.	c

Of	c
course	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
bit	c
sad	c
that	c
machinery	c
is	c
taking	c
over	c
humans	i
and	c
of	c
course	c
it	c
makes	c
me	c
lazy	c
.	c

However	c
now	i
I	c
have	c
more	c
freedom	c
,	c
free	c
time	c
,	c
and	c
privacy	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
so	c
happy	c
to	c
have	c
won	c
this	i
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
.	c

I	c
will	c
be	c
happy	c
to	c
be	c
for	c
two	c
weeks	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
in	c
the	c
U.S.A	c
.	c

And	c
would	c
it	c
be	c
possible	c
to	c
do	c
swimm	i
and	c
surf	i
.	c

I	c
done	i
it	c
since	i
I	i
remeber	i
me	i

I	c
have	c
been	c
driming	i
about	c
this	c
activitie	i
since	c
I	c
had	i
10	c
years	c
old	c

I	c
will	c
contact	c
you	c

if	c
I	c
will	i
have	i
more	c

I	c
would	c

to	c

on	i

I	c

therefore	i
I	c
only	c

holidays	c
in	c
this	c
part	c

About	c
the	c
acomodations	i
I	i
would	c
like	c
to	c

They	c
live	c

and	c
only	c
think	c
about	c
it	c

They	c
are	c
addicted	c
in	i
buying	c
things	c
.	c

Some	c
doctors	c
say	c
that	c
buy	i
without	c
control	c
is	c
a	c
disease	c
and	c
I	c
agree	c
with	c
them	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
a	c
friend	c
who	c
is	c
a	c
compulsory	i
buyer	i

Sometimes	c

shopping	c
can	c
be	c
really	c
bore	i
especially	i
in	i

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
very	c
crowded	c
,	c
I	c
could	c
hardly	c
walk	i
in	c
the	c
shop	c
.	c

I	c
decided	c
to	c
by	i
a	c
CD	i
room	i
driver	i
for	c
my	c
old	c
computer	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
approached	c
to	i
the	c
cashier	c
I	c
suddenly	c
noticed	c
my	c
wallet	c
had	c
gone	c
.	c

My	c
money	c
,	c
travel	c
card	c
and	c
credit	c
card	c
.	i

As	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c
I	i
phoned	c
to	i
my	c
bank	c
for	i
cancelation	i
of	i
my	c
credit	c
card	c
but	c
they	c
had	c
already	c
used	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
only	i
able	c
to	c
take	c
my	c
holidy	i
in	c
July	c
,	i
rest	c
of	c
the	c
year	c
I	c
work	c
.	c

Most	i
of	i
the	i
weekend	i
I	c
go	c
for	i
swiming	i
and	c
tennis	i
.	c

I	c
also	i
would	i
like	c
to	c
get	c
some	c
information	c
about	c
weather	i
.	c

What	c
does	i
it	c
like	c
in	c
July	c
over	c
there	c
?	c

Shopping	c
is	c
part	c
of	c
our	c
life	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
like	c
shopping	c
.	c

I	c
ca	c
n't	c
stand	c
on	i
the	i
long	c
queue	i
.	c

It	c
is	c
not	c
good	c
.	c

I	c
ca	c
n't	c
cope	c
with	c
that	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
annoyed	i
.	c

it	i
is	c
hard	c
to	i
make	i
decide	i
which	c
suitable	i
for	c
you	c
.	c

The	c
activities	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
mot	i
to	i
do	i
are	c
climbing	c
and	c
surfing	c
.	c

And	c
what	c
about	c
money	c
?	c

How	c
much	c
money	c
Should	i
I	c
take	c
with	c
me	c
?	c

And	c
my	c
last	c
question	c
:	c
how	c
many	c
persons	i
are	c
going	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
each	c
tent	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
big	i
variety	c
in	c
the	c
store	c
.	c

Very	c
often	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
what	c
to	c
buy	c
because	c
we	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
only	c
three	c
or	c
four	c
different	c
sport	i
shoes	c
to	c
choose	c
from	c
,	c
not	i
,	c
we	c
have	c
to	c
choose	c
out	c
of	c
twenty	c
or	c
thirty	c
such	c
as	c
Nike	c
,	c
adidas	i
or	c
Fila	c
.	c

Very	c
often	c
you	c
can	c
hardly	c
move	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
crowds	c
of	c
people	c
.	c

And	c
many	c
people	c
are	c
in	c
a	c
hurry	c
,	c
so	c
do	c
n't	c
wonder	i
if	c
other	c
people	c
have	i
not	i
tolerance	i
and	c
patience	c
to	c
wait	c
and	c
hit	c
you	c
with	c
their	c
shopping	c
cars	i
.	c

Of	c
course	c
there	c
are	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
other	c
causes	i
why	c
shopping	c
is	c
n't	c
always	c
great	c
fun	c
,	c
but	c
the	c
last	c
cause	i
,	c
which	c
is	c
very	c
important	c
for	c
me	c
is	i
that	c
shopping	c
is	c
becoming	c
more	c
and	c
more	c
impersonal	c
.	c

That	c
means	c
that	c
there	c
are	c
more	c
and	c
more	c
big	c
supermarkets	c
and	c
big	c
stores	c
,	c
where	c
noone	i
has	c
time	c
for	c
you	c
to	c
show	i
you	c
or	c
explain	c
things	c
to	c
you	c
such	c
as	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
bicycle	c
is	c
the	c
best	c
for	c
me	i
,	c
no	c
one	c
to	c
talk	c
to	c
and	c
noone	i
to	c
complaine	i
.	i

Dear	c
Sir	c
Brown	c
,	c
I	c
'm	c
writing	c
this	c
letter	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
that	c
I	c
saw	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
very	c
disappointed	c
for	i
all	c
these	c
problems	c
!	c

I	c
had	i
n't	i
a	i
great	c
fun	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
ask	c
for	c
money	i
back	c
.	c

In	c
fact	c
,	c
some	c
days	c
before	c
Karin	c
,	c
a	c
friend	c
of	c
hers	c
,	c
had	c
told	c
Pat	c
that	c
she	c
had	c
fallen	c
in	c
love	c
with	c
John	c
,	c
her	c
science	i
's	i
teacher	c
.	c

This	c
age	i
's	i
difference	c
was	c
too	c
big	c
!	c

Besides	c
,	c
Karla	c
was	c
a	c
shy	c
,	c
polite	c
girl	c
that	c
Pat	c
wanted	c
to	c
help	c
.	c

They	c
agreed	c
that	c
Karla	c
's	c
love	c
was	c
only	c
a	c
dream	c
.	c

To	c
start	c
with	c
the	i
famous	c
actors	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
did	c
n't	c
perform	c
as	c
told	i
.	c

The	c
show	c
which	c
was	c
to	c
start	c
at	c
19.30	c
only	c
began	c
at	c
20.15	c
and	c
therefore	c
me	i
and	c
my	c
friends	c
were	c
n't	c
able	c
to	c
find	c
a	c
restaurant	c
when	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
because	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
on	i
sanitary	c
reasons	c
.	c

He	c
was	c
n't	c
really	c
wicked	c
,	c
he	c
merely	c
did	c
n't	c
understand	c
to	i
keep	c
his	c
mouth	c
shut	c
,	c
especially	c
at	c
school	c
where	c
every	c
little	c
unimportant	c
thing	c
about	c
your	c
so	i
called	i
"	c
private	c
life	c
"	c
runs	c
three	c
laps	c
around	c
the	c
schoolyard	c
before	c
you	c
learn	c
it	c
although	c
you	c
are	c
the	c
most	c
concerned	c
about	c
it	c
and	c
did	c
n't	c
even	c
know	c
.	c

But	c
small	i
drama	c
can	c
grow	c
up	i
as	c
children	c
are	c
very	c
sensitive	c
.	c

That	c
is	c
only	c
human	c
.	c

The	c
criticism	i
spirit	c
has	c
to	c
be	c
preserved	c
but	c
we	c
must	c
keep	c
our	c
secrets	c
.	c

Dear	c
Ms	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
really	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
it	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
been	c
to	c
the	c
U.S.A.	c
before	c
.	c

Both	c
of	c
them	c
are	c
my	c
hobbies	c
,	i
I	c
have	c
won	c
some	c
prizes	c
in	c
my	c
school	c
competition	i
of	i
them	c
.	c

As	c
all	c
the	c
travel	c
expenses	c
are	c
paid	c
already	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
appreciate	c
it	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
tell	c
what	i
kind	c
of	c
clothing	c
also	i
how	c
much	c
pocket	c
money	c
I	c
need	c
.	c

You	c
know	c
,	c
although	c
I	c
'm	c
a	c
pop	c
music	c
fan	c
,	c
I	c
'd	c
never	c
had	c
any	c
idea	c
how	c
it	i
was	i
prepared	i
for	i
opening	i
.	c

First	c
,	c
they	c
asked	c
me	c
to	c
put	c
those	c
instruments	c
on	c
the	c
stage	c
.	c

I	c
told	c
him	c
I	c
loved	c
his	c
songs	c
,	i
he	i
was	c
very	c
happy	c
.	c

Then	c
,	c
we	c
stroke	i
a	c
lovely	c
conversation	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

Last	c
week	c
I	c
bought	c
some	c
tickets	c
to	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
,	c
thinking	c
that	c
I	c
would	c
have	c
a	c
perfect	c
evening	c
,	c
like	i
its	c
advertisement	c
tell	i
us	c
.	c

And	c
I	c
became	c
even	c
more	c
angry	c
to	i
have	i
to	c
wait	c
45	c
minutes	c
for	c
the	c
show	c
to	c
begin	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
necessary	c
to	c
start	c
on	c
time	c
,	c
and	c
your	c
paper	i
was	i
informing	i
that	i
it	c
would	c
begin	c
at	c
19:30	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
your	c
answer	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

And	c
because	c
of	c
that	c
,	c
everyone	c
at	c
school	c
happened	i
to	c
know	c
that	c
Ali	c
was	c
dating	c
Nick	c
,	c
that	i
used	i
to	i
be	i
Caroline	c
's	c
boyfriend	c
at	c
the	c
time	c
.	c

Caroline	c
discovered	c
everything	c
,	c
and	c
argued	c
with	c
the	c
infidel	i
couple	c
.	c

Pat	c
entered	c
the	c
fight	c
,	c
and	c
it	c
became	c
more	c
loud	c
and	c
agressive	i
.	c

And	c
Nick	c
told	c
her	c
that	c
his	c
real	c
love	c
was	c
his	c
girlfriend	c
Caroline	c
,	c
and	c
that	c
they	c
were	c
n't	c
going	c
to	c
break	c
up	c
.	c

One	c
of	c
the	c
most	c
beautiful	c
things	c
on	i
the	c
world	c
is	c
the	i
true	c
and	c
loyal	c
friendship	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
,	c

The	c
thing	c
which	c
made	c
me	c
really	c
upset	c
was	c
the	c
actor	c
.	c

The	c
actor	c
should	c
be	i
Danny	c
Brook	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
another	c
man	c
who	c
I	c
have	c
n't	c
seen	c
before	c
.	c

This	c
thing	c
should	c
n't	c
be	i
happened	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
about	c
21:00	c
,	c
I	c
thought	c
it	c
was	c
bit	i
later	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
my	c
falt	i
anyway	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
very	c
formal	c
fashion	c
,	c
but	c
now	c
people	c
wear	c
more	c
sexy	c
clothes	c
than	c
100	c
years	c
ago	c
.	c

Fashion	c
keeps	c
changing	c
.	c

The	c
enviroment	i
will	c
be	c
very	c
polluted	c
and	c
finally	c
we	c
'll	c
get	c
desease	i
.	c

May	i
be	i
,	c
science	c
will	c
be	c
developed	c
and	c
make	c
our	c
enviroment	i
clean	c
,	c
we	i
will	c
not	c
wear	c
anything	c
at	c
all	c
!	c
!	c
!	c
(	c
except	c
under	i
wear	i
)	c
.	c

I	c
went	c
the	i
international	c
arts	c
festival	c
which	c
you	c
organized	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
the	c
International	c
Arts	c
Festival	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
idea	c
!	c

And	c
it	c
does	c
n't	c
matter	c
if	c
we	c
enter	c
the	c
classroom	c
in	i
any	c
time	c
.	i

One	c
of	c
the	c
rules	c
of	i
my	c
friend	c
's	c
school	c
is	c
not	i
to	c
drink	c
and	i
eat	c
something	i
during	c
a	c
class	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
come	c
back	c
my	i
house	c
until	i
11	c
o'clock	c
at	c
night	c
.	c

How	c
about	c
in	c
your	c
country	c
?	c

Love	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
,	c

The	c
advertisement	c
promised	c
there	c
would	c
be	c
my	c
favorite	i
star	c
Danny	i
Brook	c
,	c
but	c
there	c
was	c
an	i
other	i
actor	c
who	c
could	c
not	c
play	c
his	c
part	c
as	c
well	c
as	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
In	i
addition	c
,	c
the	c
performance	c
started	c
45	c
minutes	c
later	i
,	c
so	c
we	c
could	c
n't	c
visit	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
because	c
it	c
had	i
been	i
closed	c
already	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

One	c
day	c
Maria	c
and	c
her	c
mother	c
returned	c
home	c
and	c
found	c
a	c
letter	c
.	c

Maria	c
bought	i
his	c
favorite	i
food	c
and	c
she	c
throw	i
it	c
away	i
into	c
the	c
bin	c
.	c

So	c
she	c
decided	c
to	c
tell	c
Pat	c
,	c
her	c
lovely	c
Pat	c
.	c

She	c
was	c
so	c
understanding	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
your	c
music	c
show	c
entitled	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
Which	i
I	c
saw	c
during	c
my	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
expected	c
to	c
see	c
the	i
play	i
by	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
who	i
is	c
my	c
favourite	c
actor	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
without	c
any	c
announcement	c
,	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
was	c
playing	c
his	c
role	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
according	c
to	c
the	c
advertisement	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
would	i
have	c
started	c
at	c
19:30	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
.	c

You	c
should	c
have	c
let	c
us	c
know	i
such	i
information	c
in	c
advance	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
modern	c
technology	c
has	c
changed	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
,	c
especially	c
in	i
communication	c
with	c
my	c
best	c
friend	c
who	i
is	c
studying	c
in	c
Britain	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
we	c
can	c
talk	c
on	c
the	c
phone	c
.	c

Without	c
a	c
computer	c
and	c
a	c
telephone	c
,	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
contact	c
her	c
easily	c
and	c
I	c
may	i
lose	c
touch	c
with	c
her	c
.	c

In	i
present	c
,	c
it	c
takes	c
just	c
12	c
hours	c
by	c
plane	c
.	c

Thanks	c
to	c
such	c
modern	c
technology	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
improve	c
the	i
relationship	c
with	c
my	c
friend	c
,	c
even	c
if	c
she	c
is	c
living	c
away	i
from	c
me	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
recived	i
your	c
latter	i
,	c
I	c
could	c
not	c
belive	i
it	c
.	c

My	i
last	c
holiday	c
in	c
tend	i
I	c
had	c
very	i
bad	c
experience	c
,	c
the	c
mosquitos	i
nearly	c
killed	c
me	c
.	c

With	c
reference	c
to	c
the	c
activities	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
been	c
climbing	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
try	c
this	c
sport	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
really	i
good	c
singer	c
.	c

I	c
am	i
enjoying	i
a	i
lot	i
with	i
karaoke	i
.	c

And	c
also	i
ask	c
you	c
,	i
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
with	c
me	c
.	c

Please	c
if	i
you	c
could	c
help	c
me	c
with	c
this	c
I	c
will	i
be	c
very	c
glad	c
.	c

You	c
cannot	c
imagine	c
what	c
I	c
've	c
been	c
up	c
to	c
.	c

To	c
be	c
honnest	i
the	c
most	c
exited	i
part	c
of	c
all	c
this	c
was	c
to	i
know	c
the	c
group	c
.	c

The	c
singer	c
is	c
very	i
nice	c
gay	i
,	c
as	c
the	i
rest	c
of	c
the	c
group	c
.	c

I	c
was	i
writting	i
as	i
reply	c
of	i
your	c
letter	c
,	i
I	c
am	c
glad	c
to	c
have	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
for	c
two	c
weeks	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
in	c
the	c
USA	c
.	c

And	c
with	i
the	c
activities	c
I	i
must	c
chose	i
Photography	c
and	c
Painting	c
becase	i
I	c
am	c
not	c
very	c
good	c
for	i
sports	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
I	c
am	i
doing	i
well	c
in	i
these	c
things	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

Later	c
the	c
band	c
was	c
talking	c
to	c
me	c
,	c
I	c
could	c
get	c
their	c
new	c
album	c
free	c
,	c
and	c
some	c
other	c
souvenirs	c
from	c
the	c
band	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
you	i
to	c
give	c
you	c
the	c
suitable	i
information	c
you	c
need	c
about	c
me	c
.	c

Here	c
are	i
some	c
of	c
the	c
information	c
:	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
then	i
the	i
school	i
year	i
ends	i
and	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
go	c
on	c
vacation	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
log	c
cabins	c
because	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
sleep	c
outside	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
.	c

I	c
know	c
how	c
to	c
swim	c
and	c
dive	c
from	c
high	c
places	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
keen	c
on	c
both	c
sports	c
.	c

And	c
finally	i
how	c
much	c
money	c
will	i
I	i
need	c
to	c
have	c
with	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
again	c

Dear	c
Kim	c

You	c
know	c
that	c
last	c
month	c
I	c
helped	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
and	c
I	i
've	i
enjoyed	i
it	c
very	c
much	c
.	c

I	c
did	c
many	c
different	c
kinds	c
of	c
things	c
.	c

Then	c
I	c
helped	c
the	c
dancers	c
with	c
their	c
dance	c
on	c
stage	c
.	c

After	c
that	c
I	c
helped	c
the	c
singers	c
perform	c
and	c
dance	c
together	c
and	c
finally	c
I	c
helped	c
with	c
the	c
lights	c
for	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
amazing	c
!	c
(	i
the	i
show	i
)	i

1st	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
suggest	c
a	c
special	c
activity	c
while	c
we	c
are	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

There	c
will	c
be	c
The	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
in	c
Central	c
Exhibition	c
Hall	c
on	c
the	c
14th	c
of	c
March	c
.	c

Besides	c
,	c
students	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
to	c
pay	c
entrance	i
fee	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
free	c
for	c
students	c
.	c

The	c
fashion	c
show	c
is	c
only	c
on	c
the	c
14th	c
of	c
March	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
would	c
be	c
grateful	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
allow	c
all	c
of	c
my	c
classmates	c
to	c
go	c
there	c
after	c
visiting	c
Science	i
Museum	c
instead	c
of	c
going	c
shopping	c
.	c

Yours	c
Sincerely	c
,	c

It	c
is	c
too	c
cruel	c
for	c
them	c
to	c
be	i
monitored	i
their	i
feelings	i
at	c
that	c
time	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
asked	c
by	c
my	c
class	c
to	c
write	c
to	c
you	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
we	c
want	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
having	c
organised	c
a	c
very	c
good	c
programme	c
for	c
the	c
three	i
days	i
trip	c
to	c
London	c
.	c

Lastly	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
free	c
for	c
students	c
,	c
which	c
is	c
fantastic	c
!	c

What	c
do	c
you	c
think	c
of	c
this	c
suggestion	c
?	c

Yours	c
Faithfully	i
,	c

For	c
famous	c
people	c
,	c
having	c
a	c
private	c
life	c
is	c
difficult	c
,	c
especially	c
because	c
we	c
are	c
all	c
interested	c
in	c
their	c
lives	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
one	c
hand	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
some	c
famous	c
people	c
are	c
looking	c
for	c
the	i
media	c
attention	c
.	c

The	c
more	c
they	c
are	c
in	c
the	c
media	c
,	c
the	c
more	c
they	i
will	i
be	i
famous	i
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
according	i
to	i
me	i
,	c
it	c
is	c
also	c
a	c
good	c
way	c
for	c
them	c
to	c
earn	c
money	c
.	c

They	c
cannot	c
go	c
to	c
public	c
places	c
,	c
unless	c
they	c
make-up	i
themselves	c
and	c
they	c
are	c
ready	c
to	c
sign	c
autographs	c
.	c

They	c
would	c
really	c
like	c
a	c
normal	c
life	c
,	c
either	c
because	c
it	i
is	i
their	c
temper	c
,	i
a	i
regarding	i
to	i
their	c
children	c
.	c

Nevertheless	c
,	c
they	c
are	c
never	c
let	i
alone	c
,	c
which	c
is	c
a	c
shame	c
.	c

We	c
can	c
inaute	i
stars	c
and	c
artists	c
from	c
around	c
the	c
world	c
who	c
will	c
make	i
and	c
prisentspresent	i
all	c
kind	i
of	c
music	c
like	c
jazz	c
,	c
rock	c
,	c
classical	c
ect	i
.	c

It	c
should	c
be	c
done	c
show	i
so	c
people	c
can	c
see	c
how	c
people	c
in	c
every	c
corner	c
of	c
the	c
word	i
make	i
theyr	i
own	i
fun	c
.	c

Afterward	i
we	c
could	c
let	c
people	c
talk	c
with	c
artists	i
so	c
they	c
can	i
get	c
knoe	i
theyr	i
privacy	i
.	c

Dear	c

I	c
attended	c
to	i
your	c
activity	i
.	c

I	c
wanted	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
play	c
as	c
quickly	c
as	c
possible	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
time	c
passed	c
and	c
it	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
begin	c
.	c

On	i
the	i
other	i
hand	i
,	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
see	c
the	c
same	c
actors	c
whose	c
name	i
were	c
written	c
on	c
the	c
advertisement	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
really	c
shocked	c
.	c

I	c
knew	c
her	c
family	c
better	c
than	c
everyone	c
else	c
.	c

Yes	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
a	i
strange	c
behaviour	c
.	c

But	c
her	c
father	c
did	c
n't	c
have	c
the	c
same	c
opinion	c
.	c

Beatrice	c
and	c
Pat	c
were	c
going	c
everywhere	c
together	c
.	c

She	c
was	c
crying	c
.	c

But	c
this	c
time	c
the	c
situation	c
was	c
inversed	i
.	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
,	c

And	c
there	c
were	c
no	c
discounts	c
available	c
either	c
,	c
unlike	c
it	i
was	c
written	c
in	c
the	c
same	c
advertisement	c
.	c

And	c
finally	c
,	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
to	c
have	c
something	c
to	c
eat	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
of	c
restoration	c
.	c

Because	c
of	c
all	c
these	c
reasons	c
,	c
which	c
I	c
have	c
listed	c
above	c
,	c
my	c
evening	c
which	i
should	c
have	c
been	c
perfect	c
,	c
turned	c
into	c
a	c
disaster	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
have	c
at	c
least	c
some	c
of	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c
.	c

And	c
now	c
the	c
situation	c
was	c
becoming	c
harder	c
to	c
get	i
on	i
with	c
.	c

On	i
one	i
side	i
it	c
was	c
her	c
best	c
friend	c
who	c
wanted	c
her	c
to	c
keep	c
this	c
secret	c
.	c

Her	c
best	c
friend	c
was	c
going	c
out	c
with	c
a	c
boy	c
that	c
night	c
,	c
And	i
she	c
told	i
her	c
parents	c
that	c
she	c
was	c
going	c
to	c
stay	c
at	c
Pat	c
's	c
house	c
,	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
get	c
permission	c
.	c

And	c
she	c
realized	c
that	c
if	c
something	c
happens	i
to	c
her	c
best	c
fried	i
,	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
her	c
fault	c
and	c
her	c
best	c
friend	c
's	c
parents	c
would	c
blame	c
her	c
for	c
it	c
.	c

So	c
she	c
decided	c
to	c
call	c
the	c
parents	c
of	c
her	c
best	c
friend	c
and	c
tell	c
them	c
what	c
was	c
going	c
on	c
.	c

Of	c
course	c
,	c
her	c
best	c
friend	c
would	c
never	c
trust	c
her	c
again	c
and	c
never	c
share	c
any	c
secrets	c
,	c
but	c
she	c
was	c
doing	c
this	c
for	c
her	c
best	c
friends	i
sake	c
,	c
was	c
n't	c
she	c

2000	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
about	c
my	c
complaints	c
of	i
mine	i
about	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
of	i
your	c
theater	i
,	i
that	c
I	c
have	i
watched	i
a	c
week	c
ago	c
,	c
during	c
my	c
stay	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

On	i
the	i
contrary	i
with	i
the	i
advertisement	c
,	i
that	c
was	c
published	c
on	i
the	c
Guardian	c
,	c
there	c
were	c
no	c
discounts	c
available	c
,	c
although	c
I	c
had	c
an	c
International	c
Student	i
Identity	c
card	i
.	c

So	c
,	c
I	c
did	c
not	c
have	c
the	c
"	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
"	c
as	c
stated	c
in	c
your	c
advertisement	c
.	c

Maybe	c
because	c
of	c
this	c
,	c
just	c
like	c
living	c
things	c
,	c
the	i
clothes	c
have	i
evolution	i
.	c

How	i
about	c
the	c
clothes	c
of	c
people	c
,	i
a	i
hundred	i
years	i
later	i
?	c

Please	c
,	c
let	c
me	c
tell	c
you	c
my	c
answer	c
now	c
.	c

Because	i
my	c
college	c
will	c
finish	c
in	i
the	c
end	c
of	c
June	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
going	c
to	c
go	c
back	c
to	c
Japan	c
in	c
August	c
.	c

Thanking	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
time	c
.	c

I	c
love	c
shopping	c
.	c

They	c
are	c
heaven	c
!	c

To	c
be	c
honest	c
,	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
always	c
buy	c
these	c
products	c
but	i
I	c
can	c
be	c
satisfied	c
with	c
just	c
looking	c
them	i
.	c

Some	c
people	c
does	i
n't	i
like	c
to	c
go	c
shopping	c
with	c
a	c
friend	c
who	c
takes	c
long	i
time	c
to	c
decide	c
.	c

I	c
believe	c
there	c
are	c
lot	i
of	c
why	i
to	c
enjoy	c
shopping	c
.	c

By	c
the	c
way	c
,	c
shopping	c
is	c
a	c
sort	c
of	c
therapy	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
many	c
people	c
,	c
specially	i
women	c
,	c
had	i
same	i
experience	c
.	c

Dear	c
Miss	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c

The	c
concert	c
was	c
a	c
huge	c
success	c
,	i
lots	i
of	c
people	c
came	c
and	c
enjoyed	c
the	c
music	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
proud	c
of	c
myself	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
way	c
I	c
managed	c
the	c
whole	c
experience	c
,	c
although	c
there	c
were	c
moments	c
when	c
I	c
thought	c
I	c
was	c
n't	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
cope	c
with	c
all	c
the	c
pressure	c
.	c

After	c
that	c
part	c
was	c
fully-functioning	i
I	c
moved	c
on	c
to	c
work	c
in	i
the	i
back	i
stage	i
.	c

I	c
really	c
enjoyed	c
working	c
with	c
those	c
people	c
,	i
they	i
are	c
all	c
very	c
professional	c
although	c
they	c
may	c
look	c
a	c
bit	c
eccentric	c
sometimes	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
what	c
I	c
liked	c
the	c
most	c
about	c
it	c
was	c
seeing	c
so	c
many	c
people	c
dancing	c
,	c
jumping	c
and	c
enjoying	c
frenetically	c
of	i
something	c
that	c
I	c
had	c
been	c
part	c
of	c
and	c
helped	c
to	c
make	c
it	i
happened	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
tents	i
so	c
that	c
I	c
will	c
have	c
the	c
chance	c
to	c
be	c
in	c
contact	c
with	c
the	i
nature	c
as	c
well	c
as	c
the	c
scenery	c
around	c
.	i

Another	i
thing	i
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
choose	c
from	c
the	c
activity	c
list	c
is	i
singing	c
(	c
because	c
I	c
take	i
part	i
in	i
a	c
chorus	i
at	c
school	c
)	c
and	c
photography	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
really	c
good	c
taking	i
pictures	c
,	i
it	i
's	i
a	c
way	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
express	c
my	c
feelings	c
.	c

I	c
wonder	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
send	c
me	c
more	c
information	c
about	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
have	i
we	i
bring	i
.	c

The	c
pop	c
band	c
"	c
Five	c
"	c
arrived	c
into	i
town	c
and	c
needed	c
people	c
to	c
help	c
with	c
not	c
only	c
the	c
organisation	c
but	c
also	c
the	i
stages	c
and	c
sound	i
.	c

I	c
could	c
n't	c
believe	c
when	i
he	c
said	c
:	c
"	c
O	c
.	c

K.	c
if	i
you	c
want	c
to	c
help	c
,	c
here	c
is	c
a	c
list	c
of	c
what	c
you	c
can	c
do.	c
"	c

What	c
I	c
really	c
enjoyed	c
was	c
been	i
part	c
of	c
the	c
staff	c
.	c

Perhaps	c
I	c
could	c
show	c
you	c
the	c
pictures	c
I	c
took	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
spending	c
some	c
days	c
in	c
London	c
and	c
enjoyed	i
a	i
lot	i
the	i
idea	i
of	i
seeing	i
this	i
show	i
.	c

All	i
my	i
disappointment	c
started	c
when	c
we	c
noticed	c
that	c
there	c
were	c
no	c
discounts	c
available	c
for	c
the	c
tickets	c
,	c
but	c
as	c
we	c
wanted	c
to	c
see	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
's	c
performance	c
,	c
we	c
decided	c
to	c
buy	c
them	c
anyway	c
.	c

Besides	c
the	c
boredom	c
of	c
having	c
waited	i
for	c
forty-five	c
minutes	c
,	c
we	c
were	c
not	c
allowed	c
to	c
visit	c
the	c
restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
since	c
it	c
was	c
already	c
closed	c
by	c
the	c
time	c
the	c
show	c
finished	c

you	c
about	c
a	c
great	c
book	c

've	c
just	c
finished	c

which	c
I	c

sure	c
you	c

Its	c

is	c
"	c
Best	c
Detective	c
Stories	c
of	c
Agatha	c
Christie	c
"	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
really	c
got	i
impressioned	i
with	c
the	c
coherence	c
of	c
the	c
stories	c
.	c

Agatha	c
Christie	c
presents	c
situations	c
that	c
make	i
us	i
break	i
up	i
our	i
minds	i
.	c

The	c
crimes	c
she	c
describes	c
seem	c
so	c
perfect	c
that	c
we	c
brainstorm	i
a	c
lot	c
trying	c
to	c
find	c
out	c
who	c
is	c
the	c
criminal	c
.	c

One	c
of	c
the	c
stories	c
will	c
be	c
read	c
on	c
the	c
radio	c
next	c
week	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
is	i
such	c
a	c
good	c
programme	c
especially	i
because	c
the	c
places	c
that	c
we	c
visit	c
,	c
like	c
the	c
Science	c
Museum	c
,	c
are	c
very	c
interesting	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
the	c
rest	c
of	c
the	c
students	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
heard	c
about	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
show	c
that	c
will	c
be	c
celebrated	c
at	c
the	c
Central	c
Exhibition	c
Hall	c
in	c
London	c
where	i
the	c
latest	c
fashions	c
will	c
be	c
shown	c

"	c
THE	c
HOME	c
OF	c
THE	c
FUTURE	c
"	c

From	i
any	i
point	i
of	i
view	i
,	c
the	c
home	c
of	c
the	c
future	c
will	c
be	c
very	c
similar	c
to	c
the	c
homes	c
that	c
we	c
have	c
today	c
.	c

Although	c
many	c
people	c
think	c
that	c
the	c
home	c
of	c
the	c
future	c
will	c
be	c
something	c
like	c
an	i
UFO	c
,	c
in	c
my	c
opinion	c
the	c
changes	c
wo	c
n't	c
be	c
very	c
important	i
,	c
they	c
will	c
probably	c
consist	c
on	i
making	c
the	c
houseworks	i
easier	c
.	c

The	c
cleanest	i
example	c
is	c
to	c
compare	c
a	c
house	c
from	c
the	c
beginings	i
of	c
the	c
20th	c
century	c
with	c
our	c
house	i
Both	i
are	c
very	c
similar	c
but	c
now	c
we	c
have	c
new	c
technologies	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
the	c
prize	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
this	c
letter	c
to	c
inform	c
you	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
recieved	i
your	c
letters	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
going	c
to	i
the	c
trip	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
to	i
the	c
trip	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
my	c
school	c
,	c
which	c
is	c
Berkeley	c
International	c
School	c
,	c
is	c
going	c
to	c
arrange	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
term	c
break	c
both	c
for	c
staff	c
and	c
students	c
.	c

The	c
weather	c
condition	i
will	c
be	c
suitable	c
for	c
camping	c
.	c

I	c
prefer	c
to	c
live	i
in	c
tents	c
to	i
log	c
cabin	c
because	c
sleeping	c
in	c
the	i
tent	c
makes	c
me	c
more	c
comfortable	c
and	c
I	c
can	c
get	c
closer	c
to	c
the	i
nature	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
was	c
in	c
fourth	i
form	c
,	c
I	c
got	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
swimming	i
competition	c
and	c
third	c
prize	c
in	c
tennis	c
.	c

It	c
will	i
be	c
very	c
kind	c
of	c
you	c
,	i
if	c
you	c
can	i
answer	c
my	c
questions	c
.	c

How	c
are	c
you	c
.	i

I	c
am	c
fine	c
and	c
I	c
hope	c
you	c
're	c
fine	c
too	c
.	c

Although	c
the	c
work	c
was	c
not	c
heavey	i
,	c
I	c
gained	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
experience	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
really	c
embarassed	i
because	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
dance	c
in	c
front	c
of	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
people	c
but	c
that	c
is	i
the	c
very	c
good	i
experience	c
I	c
have	c
ever	c
had	c
.	c

I	c
was	i
really	c
enjoy	i
at	i
the	c
concert	c
.	c

I	c
really	c
want	c
to	c
have	c
that	c
experience	c
again	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
inconnection	i
with	c
your	c
programme	c
of	i
spending	c
three	c
days	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
inform	c
you	c
about	c
The	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
show	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
14th	c
March	c
at	i
10.00	c
-	c
19.00	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
be	c
greatful	i
if	c
you	c
could	c
arrange	i
these	i
shows	i
in	c
your	c
programme	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
very	c
thoughtful	c
of	c
you	c
that	i
you	i
are	i
taking	i
all	c
of	c
us	c
to	c
London	c
.	c

I	c
closed	c
my	c
eyes	c
,	c
tooke	i
a	c
deep	c
breath	c
and	c
jumed	i
out	c
of	c
the	c
tower	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
given	c
the	c
lists	i
for	i
doing	i
the	i
activities	c
while	c
I	c
was	c
going	i
to	i
the	c
adventurous	i
school	c
schems	i
at	c
the	c
solder	i
camps	c
in	c
the	c
north	c
of	c
Thailand	c
.	c

The	c
last	c
task	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
was	c
jume	i
out	c
of	c
the	c
hight	i
tower	c
.	c

I	c
eventaully	i
managed	c
to	c
complete	c
all	c
tasks	i
that	c
I	c
had	i
given	i
I	i
was	c
very	c
proud	c
of	c
this	c
.	c

And	i
then	i
,	i
you	i
may	i
save	i
money	i
for	i
the	i
things	i
you	i
like	i
,	i
nothing	i
to	i
do	i
,	i
just	i
for	i
the	i
poor	i
things	i
what	i
you	i
like	i
so	i
funny	c
is	i
n't	c
it	c
?	c

So	c
,	c
in	c
my	c
opinion	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
really	c
enjoyable	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

Maybe	c
I	c
will	c
feel	c
better	c
and	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
a	c
fan	c
of	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
he	c
was	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
reasons	c
why	c
I	c
chose	c
seeing	i
Over	c
The	c
Rainbow	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
even	c
see	c
him	c
on	c
the	c
stage	c
.	c

Suprisingly	i
the	c
show	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
.	c

That	c
destroyed	c
all	c
my	c
plans	c
.	c

Then	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
have	c
a	i
dinner	c
at	c
your	c
Theatre	c
Restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
but	c
unfortunately	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
why	c
I	c
told	i
this	i
to	i
Pat	i
.	c

Yesterday	c
Larry	c
suggested	c
going	c
to	c
cinema	i
after	c
school	c
.	c

This	c
was	c
the	c
most	c
wonderful	c
suggestion	c
I	c
have	c
ever	c
had	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
like	i
walking	c
on	i
the	c
clouds	c
the	i
whole	c
day	c
until	c
I	c
saw	c
Pat	c
running	c
towards	c
me	c
.	c

She	c
was	i
about	i
to	i
cry	c
.	c

"	c
I	c
see	c
.	c

I	c
told	c
her	c
not	c
to	c
tell	c
this	i
anyone	i
.	c

She	c
said	c
OK	c
angrily	c
.	c

After	c
school	c
Larry	c
and	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
cinema	c
,	c
but	c
on	i
the	c
enterance	i
there	c
was	c
a	c
beautiful	c
girl	c
waiting	c
for	c
us	c
.	c

When	c
they	c
asked	c
me	c
the	c
reason	c
I	c
told	c
that	i
I	c
promised	c
my	c
Mom	c
to	c
be	i
with	c
her	c
.	c

They	c
said	c
OK	c
and	c
I	c
went	c
home	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
closed	c
my	c
bedroom	i
's	i
door	c
I	c
burst	c
into	c
tears	c
.	c

Next	c
morning	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
school	c
again	c
.	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
'm	c
very	c
surprise	i
,	i
to	c
won	i
this	c
prize	c
.	c

At	c
the	c
camp	c
I	c
will	i
like	c
to	c
practise	i
tennis	c
and	c
golf	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
some	c
question	i
.	c

It	i
's	i
necessary	c
for	i
the	i
activities	i
to	i
wear	i
special	i
clothes	i
?	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

When	c
we	c
arrived	c
to	i
the	c
shopping	c
center	i
,	c
I	c
saw	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
people	c
.	c

Nobody	c
at	i
the	c
shop	c
came	c
with	c
us	c
to	c
help	c
.	c

There	c
are	i
four	c
gays	i
,	c
in	c
this	c
shop	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
a	c
girl	i
very	i
friendly	i
came	c
with	c
us	c
.	c

I	c
,	c
as	c
a	c
head	c
member	c
of	c
the	c
students	c
who	c
participate	c
in	c
this	c
year	c
's	c
trip	c
to	c
London	c
,	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
the	c
excellence	c
of	c
the	c
programme	c
you	c
have	c
developed	i
for	c
us	c
.	c

Specially	i
,	c
I	c
would	c
have	c
to	c
name	c
the	c
great	c
opportunity	c
you	c
offer	c
to	c
us	c
with	c
the	c
visit	c
to	c
the	c
National	c
Art	c
Gallery	c
which	c
is	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
art	c
galleries	c
all	i
around	i
the	c
world	c
.	c

Being	i
London	i
one	c
of	c
the	c
most	c
multicultural	c
,	c
multiracial	c
cities	c
,	c
we	c
cannot	c
avoid	c
the	c
fact	c
that	c
is	i
these	c
days	c
The	c
London	c
Fashion	c
And	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
takes	c
place	c
in	c
the	c
Central	c
Exhibition	c
Hall	c
(	c
Tuesday	c
March	c
14th	c
)	c
10:00-19:00.	c
)	c
.	c

These	c
changes	c
will	c
not	c
affect	c
the	c
contacts	i
of	c
the	c
programme	c
itself	c
.	c

The	c
suggestion	c
is	c
to	c
move	c
the	c
Tuesday	c
shopping	c
to	c
Wednesday	c
afternoon	c
,	c
which	c
is	c
free	c
,	c
and	c
place	c
there	c
the	c
visit	c
to	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
And	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
,	c
that	c
is	c
,	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
afternoon	c
.	c

I	c
also	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
remark	c
that	c
this	c
change	c
does	c
not	c
increment	i
the	c
cost	c
of	c
the	c
trip	c
,	c
because	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
And	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
is	c
free	c
for	c
students	c
.	c

Best	c
Regards	c
,	c

Nowadays	c
I	c
remember	c
those	c
exciting	c
days	c
in	c
which	c
danger	c
is	i
knocking	c
at	c
your	c
door	c
every	c
day	c
.	c

Both	c
of	c
us	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
NASA	c
university	c
and	c
nowadays	c
we	c
work	c
for	c
the	c
CIA	c
developing	c
secure	c
system	i
and	c
new	c
encryptation	i
algorithms	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

Well	c
,	c
first	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
's	c
quite	c
difficult	c
to	c
be	c
a	c
musician	c
,	c
film	c
star	c
or	c
a	c
politician	c
without	c
being	c
followed	c
by	c
journalists	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
.	c

As	c
soon	c
as	c
they	c
are	c
famous	c
,	c
they	c
are	c
surrounded	c
by	c
their	c
fans	c
and	c
reporters	c
in	i
every	i
place	i
.	c

I	c
can	c
imagine	c
,	i
how	c
annoying	c
it	c
can	c
be	c
sometimes	c
.	c

Just	c
think	i
that	c
you	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
shopping	c
,	c
clubbing	c
or	c
to	c
a	c
restaurant	c
with	c
friends	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
one	c
hand	c
I	c
can	c
understand	c
how	c
important	c
it	c
is	c
for	c
the	c
journalists	c
to	c
take	c
pictures	c
for	c
the	c
newspaper	c
or	c
magazines	c
they	c
work	c
for	c
.	c

Do	c
you	c
think	c
she	c
would	i
have	i
been	i
still	i
alive	c
if	c
she	c
and	c
her	c
boyfriend	c
had	c
n't	c
been	c
followed	c
by	c
these	i
nosy	c
paparazzis	i
?	c

I	c
am	c
amazed	c
with	i
the	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
.	c

I	c
believe	c
if	c
you	c
choose	c
the	c
best	c
way	c
or	c
the	c
best	c
day	c
to	c
go	c
shopping	c
you	c
will	c
love	c
it	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sirs	c
,	c

i	i
was	c
so	c
happy	c
when	c
i	i
knew	i
that	c
i	i
won	c
first	c

in	c
your	c

Because	c
i	i
think	c
it	c
is	c
teenagers	i
game	c
.	c

i	i
'm	i
often	c
go	c
to	c
an	i
exhibitions	c
of	c
paintings	c
of	c
modern	c
artists	c
.	c

and	i
i	i
hope	c
to	c
see	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

end	i
what	c
do	c
you	c
think	c
?	c

i	i
asked	c
my	c
mother	c
to	c
buy	c
it	c

Our	c
goverment	i
very	i
burocrative	i

they	i
are	i
often	c
breake	i

13th	c
June	c
2000	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
with	c
reference	c
to	c
your	c
letter	c
about	c
the	c
competition	c
I	c
won	c
,	c
in	c
which	c
you	c
required	i
some	c
additional	c
information	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
a	c
little	c
unsure	c
about	c
some	c
things	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
be	c
very	c
grateful	c
to	c
you	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
answer	c
my	c
questions	c
.	c

Best	c
lessons	c
to	c
film	c

As	c
all	c
the	c
students	c
are	c
different	c
from	c
each	c
other	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
essential	c
to	c
show	c
many	c
aspects	c
of	c
the	c
school	c
.	c

Another	c
event	c
that	c
should	c
absolutely	i
be	c
captured	c
on	c
film	c
is	c
the	c
preparation	c
of	c
the	c
meals	c
in	c
the	c
canteen	c
.	c

Conclusion	c

It	c
could	i
be	c
wonderful	c
to	c
see	c
you	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
because	i
I	c
have	c
not	c
finished	c
school	c
.	c

Anyway	c
I	c
am	c
hard	i
working	i
for	i
the	i
word	i
cup	i
at	i
sailing	i
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
for	i
you	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
fine	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
my	c
birthday	i
's	i
present	c
.	c

Anyway	c
I	c
enjoed	i
so	i
much	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
n't	c
been	c
to	c
a	c
concert	c
before	c
so	c
the	c
atmosphier	i
was	c
really	c
good	c
.	c

Did	i
you	c
remember	c
the	c
computer	c
curse	i
that	c
we	c
took	c
together	i
it	i
was	c
very	c
useful	c
to	c
clasifay	i
each	c
person	c
in	i
the	c
concert	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
that	c
I	c
enjoyed	c
the	c
International	c
Arts	c
Festival	c
held	c
on	c
21-22	c
November	c
this	c
year	c
.	c

Especially	i
,	c
I	c
enjoyed	c
the	c
jazz	c
concerts	c
and	c
could	c
see	c
some	c
famous	c
jazz	c
musicians	c
I	c
adore	c
.	c

For	c
next	c
year	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
you	c
should	c
take	c
this	c
matter	c
into	c
consideration	c
,	i
And	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
much	c
better	c
if	c
you	c
had	c
more	c
plays	c
and	c
films	c
.	c

I	c
will	c
definitely	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
festival	c
next	c
year	c
,	c
too	c
.	c

To	c
make	c
it	c
more	c
enjoyable	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
be	c
grateful	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
welcome	i
my	c
comments	c
on	i
it	c
.	c

When	c
he	c
cut	c
it	c
,	c
he	c
found	c
a	c
beautiful	c
baby	c
girl	c
in	c
it	c
.	c

She	c
was	c
named	c
bamboo	i
princess	c
.	c

The	c
princess	c
grew	c
up	c
beautifully	i
.	c

But	c
,	c
one	c
the	i
day	c
,	c
the	c
princess	c
went	c
back	c
to	c
the	c
moon	c
with	c
guards	c
from	c
the	c
moon	c
although	c
the	c
prince	c
and	c
his	c
army	c
tried	c
hard	c
to	c
protect	c
her	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs.	c
Ryan	c
,	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
the	c
letter	c
which	c
brought	c
me	c
such	c
good	c
news	c
.	c

A	c
lot	c
of	c
women	c
would	c
never	c
agree	c
with	c
me	c
and	c
almost	c
all	c
the	c
men	c
of	i
the	c
world	c
would	c
never	c
believe	c
that	c
in	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	i
shopping	c
is	c
really	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

Especially	i
,	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
support	i
to	c
do	i
shopping	c
with	c
my	c
mother	c
:	c
it	c
takes	c
so	c
much	c
time	c
that	c
later	c
I	c
regret	c
of	i
agreeing	c
to	c
go	c
with	c
.	i

Shopping	c
is	c
a	c
personal	c
art	c
and	c
everybody	c
has	c
his	c
own	c
way	c
to	i
do	i
it	c
.	c

Mrs.	c
Jane	c
Clark	c
,	c

I	c
see	i
your	c
advertisement	c
about	c
Internal	i
Arts	c
Festival	c
now	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
you	c
should	c
invite	c
from	i
ten	c
countries	c
because	c
there	c
are	c
more	c
and	c
more	c
stars	c
and	c
artists	c
in	c
the	c
world	c
.	c

The	c
most	c
important	c
thing	c
is	c
dance	c
shows	c
.	i

That	c
's	c
the	i
real	c
knowledge	c
for	c
us	c
,	c
art	c
exhibition	i
and	c
talks	c
by	c
writers	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
we	c
know	i
a	c
writer	i
life	c
or	c
how	c
is	i
he	i
writing	c
it	i
?	i
it	i
's	i
very	i
significant	c
thing	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
excellent	c
.	c

I	c
miss	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
and	c
sorry	c
about	i
did	i
n't	i
write	i
you	c
some	i
letters	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
know	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
new	c
student	c
.	c

But	c
this	c
school	c
has	c
got	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
rules	c
and	c
in	c
our	c
class	c
,	i
we	c
have	c
been	c
talking	c
about	c
Rules	i
,	c
both	c
at	c
home	c
and	c
at	c
school	c
.	c

For	c
instance	c
;	i
you	c
must	c
not	c
argue	c
with	c
your	c
friend	c
or	c
you	c
must	c
not	c
argue	c
with	c
workers	c
.	c

The	c
most	c
significant	c
rule	c
is	c
you	c
must	c
not	c
smoke	c
in	c
public	c
places	c
,	c
or	c
in	c
the	c
toilet	c
.	c

Can	c
I	c
change	c
my	c
school	c
?	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
!	c

The	c
advertisement	c
of	i
the	c
musical	c
said	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	i
unfortunately	i
there	c
was	c
someone	c
else	c
-	c
an	c
actor	c
which	i
I	c
do	c
not	c
like	c
and	c
if	c
I	c
have	i
known	c
that	c
he	c
was	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
I	i
woud	i
not	c
have	c
come	i
to	c
see	c
him	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
start	c
at	c
19.30	c
but	c
actually	i
started	c
at	c
20.15	c
.	c

Your	i
faithfuly	i
,	c

It	c
is	c
always	c
with	c
us	c
:	c
in	c
our	c
homes	c
,	c
in	c
the	c
places	c
we	c
work	c
and	c
learn	c
.	c

In	c
fact	c
modern	i
technology	c
was	c
already	c
very	c
popular	c
and	c
comonly	i
used	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
born	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
cannot	c
say	c
that	c
it	c
changed	c
my	c
life	c
rapidly	i
.	c

But	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
has	c
more	c
advantages	c
than	c
disadvantages	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
O.K.	c
I	c
am	c
really	c
glad	c
that	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
child	c
of	c
my	c
centuary	i
-	c
the	c
age	c
of	c
modern	c
science	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
how	i
it	c
would	c
be	c
like	c
without	c
the	c

I	c

to	c
paint	c

composition	i

May	i
be	i
there	c
are	c
some	c
occasions	c
which	i
I	c

As	c

It	c
is	c
a	c
largish	c
city	c
and	c
has	c
a	c
population	c
of	c
over	c
eight	c
million	c

I	c
went	c
to	c
school	c
there	c
for	c
twelve	c
years	c

Many	c
people	c
are	i
saying	i
:	c
"	c
When	c
you	c
have	c
a	c
son	c
,	c
send	c
him	c
to	c
Seoul	c
to	c
get	c
a	c
job	c
and	c
to	c
have	c
the	c
chance	c

But	c
there	c
are	i
alwalys	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
traffic	c
at	c
all	c
times	c

and	c
the	c
air	c
is	c
so	c
polluted	c
that	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
even	c
breathe	c

I	c
enjoyed	c
dance	i
shows	c
,	c
jazz	i
and	c
rock	c
concerts	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
surprised	c
when	c
I	c
knew	i
that	c
stars	i
and	c
artists	c
were	c
only	i
from	i
six	c
countries	c

Yours	c

The	c
man	c
was	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
happy	c
when	c
your	c

yesterday	c

This	c
trip	c
will	c
be	c
very	c
important	c
for	c
me	c
,	i
that	i
is	c
why	c
I	c
am	c
interested	c
in	c
travelling	c
to	c
U.S.A	i
as	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

Hello	c
!	c

How	c
are	c
you	c
?	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
because	c
I	c
know	c
that	c
you	c
're	c
interested	c
in	c
listening	i
my	i
experience	c
in	i
which	i
I	c
enjoyed	c
helping	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
last	c
month	c
,	i
perhaps	i
in	c
the	c
future	c
you	c
'll	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
help	c
too	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
want	c
to	c
help	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
you	c
'll	c
have	c
to	c
write	c
down	i
yourself	c
in	c
a	c
competition	c
as	c
I	c
did	c
,	c
then	c
,	c
if	c
you	c
win	c
the	c
organiser	c
will	c
phone	c
you	c
and	c
you	c
'll	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
help	c
them	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
it	i
was	c
the	c
experience	c
I	c
particularly	i
liked	c
most	c
and	c
which	c
I	c
will	c
never	c
forget	c
.	c

According	c
in	i
your	c
brochour	i
,	c
it	i
was	i
started	i
to	i
show	i
at	c
19.30	c
p.m.	c
but	c
it	c
was	i
started	i
at	c
20.15	c
p.m.	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
sleep	c
and	c
very	i
anoying	i
.	c

You	c
said	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
like	c
that	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	i
refund	c
some	c
money	i
back	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

One	c
day	c
,	c
I	c
was	i
falling	i
in	c
love	c
with	c
closest	i
freind	i
.	c

I	c
went	c
out	c
with	c
him	c
sometimes	c
and	c
we	c
were	c
happy	c
.	c

My	c
boy	i
freind	i
told	c
me	c
that	c
he	c
wanted	c
to	c
surprise	c
his	c
freind	i
in	c
his	c
class	c
when	c
the	i
times	i
comes	i
.	c

As	c
I	c
may	c
choose	c
the	c
two	c
activities	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
practise	i
during	c
my	c
staying	i
at	c
the	c
Camp	c
from	c
the	c
list	c
given	c
in	c
your	c
letter	c
,	c
I	c
choose	c
singing	c
and	c
photography	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
been	c
taking	c
singing	c
classes	i
since	c
I	c
was	c
ten	c
years	c
old	c
so	c
I	c
am	c
pretty	c
good	c
at	c
it	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

It	c
is	c
a	c
very	c
common	c
fact	i
these	c
days	c
and	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
be	c
patient	c
if	c
you	c
really	c
want	c
to	c
buy	c
something	c
.	c

13th	c

in	c
August	c
I'am	i

The	c

I	c

I	c

what	c
type	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
should	c
take	c
and	c
also	c
if	c
I	c

Thanks	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
on	i
July	c
because	c
this	c
is	c
the	c
only	c
month	c
given	i
to	c
me	c
by	c
my	c
employer	c
.	c

Finally	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
prepare	i
and	c
which	i
sorts	c
of	c
clothes	c
are	c
usually	c
weared	i
in	c
California	c
.	c

It	c
use	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
technics	i
that	c
we	c
learn	c
in	c
other	c
classes	c
.	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
you	i
to	c
give	c
you	c
the	c
information	c
you	c
need	c
,	c
but	c
first	c
of	c
all	c
I	c
would	i
say	c
that	c
I	c
am	c
really	c
delighted	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
thank	i
you	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
choice	i
photography	c
and	c
tennis	c
.	c

(	c
I	c
guess	c
that	c
you	c
should	c
n't	c
borrow	c
some	i
!	c

Joachim	c
Delerm	c

In	c
order	c
to	c
strike	i
people	c
who	c
will	c
watch	c
the	c
film	c
,	c
we	c
could	c
record	i
student	i
drawing	c
on	c
the	c
big	c
drawing	c
tables	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
do	c
the	c
same	c
for	c
thermodynamics	c
.	c

Nevertheless	c
,	c
we	c
should	c
not	c
forget	c
the	c
extra-life	i
school	c
.	c

There	i
are	i
not	c
only	c
the	c
brain	c
which	c
should	c
be	c
trained	c
.	c

Another	c
point	i
to	i
record	i
woubl	i
be	c
the	c
time	c
we	c
have	c
got	c
between	c
lessons	c
or	c
at	c
lunch	c
time	c
,	i
it	i
will	c
show	c
a	c
part	c
of	c
the	c
way	c
of	c
life	c
in	c
the	c
school	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
want	c
further	c
information	c
or	c
if	c
you	c
disagree	c
,	c
tell	c
me	c
it	i
.	c

Furthermore	c
I	c
have	c
several	c
personal	c
objects	c
that	c
play	c
a	c
fundamental	c
role	c
in	c
the	c
camp	i
daily	i
life	i
(	c
the	c
tent	c
,	c
the	c
sleep	i
bag	c
and	c
so	c
on.	c
)	c
.	c

Indeed	c
,	c
I	c
like	c
the	i
water	c
sport	i
and	c
I	c
am	c
a	i
quite	i
good	c
guitar	i
singer	i
-	i
Some	c
questions	c
:	c
What	i
about	i
the	c
average	c
temperature	c
at	c
the	c
camp	c
on	i
July	c
?	c

I	c
will	c
be	c
very	c
glad	c
to	c
partecipate	i
to	i
your	c
camp	c
!	c

Our	c
school	c
,	c
as	c
it	i
is	c
well	c
known	c
,	c
is	c
a	c
technical	c
school	c
and	c
consequently	c
the	i
daily	c
life	c
contains	i
different	c
activities	c
performed	c
in	c
the	c
classrooms	c
or	c
in	c
the	c
laboratories	c
.	c

A	c
short	c
video	c
,	c
showed	i
to	c
the	c
English	c
class	c
,	c
must	c
take	c
into	c
account	c
all	c
these	c
aspects	c
of	c
the	c
life	c
of	c
our	c
school	c
.	c

Here	c
we	c
can	c
describe	c
some	c
lessons	c
or	c
other	c
activities	c
which	c
can	c
be	c
filmed	c
to	i
create	i
the	c
video	c
.	c

Some	c
parts	c
of	c
the	c
final	c
video	c
may	c
describe	i
these	c
additional	c
features	c
of	c
the	c
school	c
.	c

The	c
show	c
's	c
date	c
is	c
very	c
convinient	i
-	c
March	c
14	c
-	c
,	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
on	c
Central	i
Exhibition	c
Hall	c
so	c
I	c
do	c
not	c
think	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
problem	c
to	c
get	c
there	c
.	c

We	c
can	c
find	c
another	c
chance	i
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
Science	c
Museum	c
in	i
any	c
other	c
day	c
,	c
but	c
this	c
show	c
is	c
just	c
for	i
this	c
Tuesday	c
.	c

Although	c
human	i
is	i
a	i
social	c
creature	i
,	c
all	c
people	c
need	c
an	c
area	c
to	i
be	i
able	i
to	i
stay	i
away	i
from	c
other	c
people	c
.	c

Also	c
we	c
all	c
like	c
to	c
have	c
some	c
special	c
things	c
and	c
people	c
in	c
our	c
lives	c
to	c
help	c
us	c
to	c
feel	c
different	c
from	c
others	c
.	c

Consequently	c
we	c
demand	c
to	c
know	c
every	c
single	c
detail	c
about	c
them	c
and	c
their	c
lives	c
.	c

Because	c
they	c
have	c
to	c
spend	c
too	i
much	c
time	c
in	c
front	c
of	c
other	c
people	c
,	c
they	c
are	c
even	c
more	c
sensitive	c
about	c
their	c
privacy	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
quiet	i
sure	c
,	i
even	i
the	c
ones	c
,	i
who	c
have	c
chosen	c
their	c
occupies	i
just	c
to	c
be	c
famous	c
,	c
do	c
n't	c
like	c
to	c
be	c
pictured	i
when	c
they	c
believe	c
they	c
are	c
alone	c
.	c

The	c
situation	c
much	i
be	c
much	c
worse	c
for	c
the	c
ones	c
who	c
have	c
become	c
famous	c
without	c
desiring	c
this	i
.	c

Although	c
this	c
statement	c
is	c
absuletely	i
true	c
,	c
it	c
seems	c
there	c
is	c
no	c
way	c
to	c
stop	c
public	c
attention	c
,	c
so	c
they	c
will	c
keep	i
living	c
with	c
journalists	c
.	c

Dear	c
manager	c
,	c

I	c
decided	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
19:30	c
show	c
so	c
I	c
arrived	c
on	c
time	c
at	c
19:00	c
o'clock	c
.	c

At	c
19:15	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
impatient	c
waiting	i
for	c
the	c
show	c
begins	i
and	i
a	c
man	c
anounced	i
that	c
the	c
show	c
will	i
start	c
at	c
20:15	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

Now	c
she	c
is	c
85	c
years	c
old	c
so	c
she	c
ca	c
n't	c
do	c
that	c
but	c
,	i
I	c
can	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
rather	c
tends	i
than	c
log	i
cabins	i
for	c
accommodation	i
because	c
the	i
last	c
summer	c
I	c
had	c
the	c
great	c
opportunity	c
to	c
be	i
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
and	c
now	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
know	c
the	i
other	c
one	i
.	i

To	c
:	c
John	c
Weller	c
.	c

To	c
make	c
easier	i
and	i
faster	i
this	i
report	i
,	c
it	c
was	c
necessary	c
to	c
make	c
a	c
questionarie	i
which	c
was	c
gave	i
out	c
in	c
the	c
school	c
.	c

After	c
collecting	c
the	c
answers	c
,	c
I	c
obtained	c
the	c
following	c
results	c
:	c

Despite	c
of	i
being	c
almost	c
300	c
students	c
,	c
the	c
answers	c
were	c
quite	c
similar	c
.	c

Also	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
really	c
mind	c
that	c
the	c
show	c
start	i
late	c
but	c
the	c
rute	i
of	i
that	i
evening	i
was	i
rucented	i
.	c

sincinerly	i
from	i
Ki	c

Now	c
megsage	i
can	c
travel	c
quicker	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
also	c
world	i
wild	i
.	c

is	c
much	c
faster	c
.	c

require	i
time	i
is	c
about	i
few	c
minutes	c
.	c

One	c
of	c
the	c
activities	c
I	c
will	c
do	c
is	c
tennis	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
am	c
just	c
a	c
beginner	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
someone	c
to	c
teach	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
waiting	c
for	c
your	c
prompt	c
reply	c
.	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c

The	c
good	c
side	c
of	c
this	c
activity	c
is	c
that	c
it	c
can	c
be	c
a	i
good	i
leisure	i
,	c
provided	c
you	c
are	c
not	c
in	c
a	c
hurry	c
.	c

The	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
show	c
said	c
that	c
there	c
was	i
discounts	c
available	c
for	c
children	c
so	c
we	c
brought	c
them	c
and	c
when	c
we	c
bought	c
the	c
tickets	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
pay	c
the	c
maximum	c
price	c
for	c
everyone	c
.	c

By	c
then	c
our	c
children	c
were	c
very	c
bored	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

It	c
was	c
her	c
aunt	c
inviting	i
her	c
for	i
the	c
weekend	c
so	c
Pat	c
said	c
very	c
loudly	c
:	c
"	c
I	c

but	c
I	c
have	c
to	c

"	c

We	c
are	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
your	c
answer	c
.	c

I	c
knew	c
,	c
I	c
could	c
die	c

It	c
was	c
dangerous	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
kew	i
I	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
it	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
I	c
've	c
got	c
a	c
brother	c
who	c
likes	c
to	c
live	c
in	c
dangerous	i
and	c
poor	i
way	c
and	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
how	c

but	c
he	c
could	i

me	c
to	c
go	c
with	c
him	c
to	c
get	c
some	c
drugs	c
,	c
in	i
my	c
25th	c

I	c
was	c
at	c
home	c
making	i
me	i
up	i
before	c
to	i
go	i
to	c
a	c
restaurant	c
with	c
my	c
friends	c
and	c
,	c
sudenlly	i
,	c
he	c
rang	c
the	c
bell	c
,	i
he	i
was	c
so	c
nervous	i
with	c
a	c
gun	c
in	c
his	c
hands	c
and	c
no	i
longer	i
I	i
could	i
speak	i
he	c
took	c
me	c
out	c
with	c
him	c
.	c

I	c
did	c
n't	c
want	c
,	i
I	i
've	c
never	c
approve	i
his	i
deal	i
with	i
the	i
drug	i
,	c
but	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
do	c
it	c
different	i
.	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
,	c

The	c
first	c
problem	c
concerned	c
the	c
main	c
actor	c
of	i
the	c
show	c
.	c

The	c
show	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
have	c
started	c
at	c
19:30	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
only	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
,	c
so	c
the	c
public	i
,	c
including	c
me	c
,	c
was	c
forced	c
to	c
wait	c
for	c
fourty	i
five	i
minutes	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
hear	c
from	c
you	c
in	c
the	c
near	c
future	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

I	c
believed	c
in	c
her	c
and	c
trusted	c
her	c
blindly	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
about	c
an	c
incident	c
I	i
had	i
with	i
the	c
musical	c
show	i
which	c
was	c
presented	i
by	i
your	c
theatre	c
during	c
my	c
week	c
's	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

Otherwise	c
,	c
I	c
will	c
sue	c
your	c
company	c
.	c

Your	i
faithfully	c
,	c

One	c
day	c
,	c
while	c
I	c
was	c
studying	c
maths	c
,	c
one	c
of	c
my	c
friends	c
,	c
called	c
Pat	c
,	c
asked	c
me	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
coffe	i
with	c
her	c
.	c

We	c
went	c
to	c
a	c
place	c
called	c
'	c
Deli	c
'	c
where	c
we	c
talked	c
a	c
lot	c
about	c
our	c
school	c
,	c
the	c
exams	c
and	c
,	c
as	c
we	c
usually	c
did	c
,	c
about	c
our	c
friends	c
and	c
boy	i
friends	i
.	c

We	c
asked	c
each	c
other	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
questions	c
but	c
then	c
we	c
started	c
talking	c
about	c
things	c
that	c
had	c
never	c
been	c
talked	c
about	c
with	c
anybody	c
.	c

In	c
spite	c
of	c
the	c
fact	c
that	c
I	c
told	c
her	c
to	c
keep	c
it	c
as	i
a	c
secret	c
,	c
she	c
went	c
to	c
my	c
cousin	c
's	c
house	c
and	c
made	i
the	i
retelling	i
of	i
what	i
I	i
had	i
exactly	i
told	c
her	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
different	i
actor	c
appeared	c
on	c
the	c
stage	c
and	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
have	c
dinner	c
about	i
the	c
musical	c
because	c
the	c
restrant	i
had	i
been	i
closed	c
.	c

You	c
should	c
back	i
my	c
money	c
immedeastry	i
because	c
that	c
night	c
was	c
far	c
from	c
parfect	i
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

Faithfully	c
,	c

But	c
everyone	c
always	c
noticed	i
he	i
had	i
secrets	i
from	i
his	i
face	i
.	c

So	c
.	i

The	c
town	c
became	c
peace	i
again	c
.	c

On	c
his	c
way	c
back	c
home	c
to	c
port	c
he	c
is	c
attacked	c
by	c
sharks	c
who	c
eats	i
his	i
catched	i
fish	i
pice	i
by	c
pice	i
.	c

He	c
make	i
you	c
experience	c
in	c
detail	c
all	c
the	c
struggles	c
the	c
fisherman	c
has	c
when	c
he	c
fights	c
with	c
the	c
swordfish	c
and	c
the	c
sharks	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
the	c
start	i
time	c
was	i
at	i
19.30	c
p.m	c
,	c
but	c
the	c
play	c
started	c
at	c
20.15	c
p.m.	c
People	c
were	c
fed	c
up	c
with	c
waiting	c
so	c
long	c
and	c
most	c
of	c
them	c
apart	i
from	c
me	c
were	i
rather	c
nervous	i
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
the	c
well-known	c
star	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
was	c
n't	c
there	c
,	c
but	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
I	i
had	c
never	c
heard	c
from	i
him	c
.	c

From	c
my	c
point	c
of	c
view	c
I	c
think	c
he	c
was	c
such	c
a	c
very	c
bad	c
actor	c
that	c
was	i
impossible	c
to	c
fine	i
another	c
with	c
the	c
same	c
features	i
.	c

After	c
the	c
show	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
visit	c
the	c
restaurant	c
as	c
it	c
is	c
said	i
it	i
is	i
very	c
famous	c
and	c
apart	c
from	c
that	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
drink	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

But	c
this	c
time	c
things	c
have	i
gone	c
too	c
far	c
.	c

I	c
considered	c
her	c
my	c
best	c
friend	c
and	c
I	c
thought	c
we	c
would	c
never	c
drift	c
apart	c
but	c
now	c
my	i
mind	i
have	i
changed	i
,	c
because	c
she	c
has	c
done	c
something	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
approve	i
.	c

Pat	c
told	c
her	c
I	c
had	c
n't	c
spent	c
those	c
days	c
with	c
her	c
,	c
but	c
with	c
my	c
boyfriend	c
in	c
the	c
mountain	i
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

In	c
advertisment	i
starring	i
was	c
very	c
interested	i
-	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
.	c

I	c
desided	i
to	c
go	c
to	c
your	c
theatre	c
but	c
at	c
the	c
beginning	c
was	i
the	c
tranbles	i
.	c

This	c
is	c
very	i
interesting	c
question	c
for	c
us	c
and	c
maybe	c
very	c
important	c
too	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
the	c
students	c
in	c
my	c
class	c
have	c
seen	c
an	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
,	c
which	c
is	c
going	c
to	c
take	c
place	c
on	c
14th	i
of	c
March	c
at	c
Central	i
Exhibition	c
Hall	c
.	c

Journalists	c
should	c
not	c
follow	c
them	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
,	c
trying	c
to	c
make	i
an	c
interview	c
or	c
taking	i
an	c
'	c
interesting	c
'	c
picture	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
we	c
could	c
say	c
that	c
they	c
decided	c
to	c
have	c
such	i
kind	c
of	c
life	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
your	i
about	c
the	c
trip	c
in	i
London	c
.	c

Our	c
request	c
is	c
to	c
change	c
the	c
programme	c
,	c
either	c
you	c
can	c
cancel	c
all	i
the	i
Tuesday	i
and	c
we	c
can	c
enjoy	c
all	c
the	c
exhibition	c
or	c
if	c
you	c
cannot	c
cancel	c
the	c
Museum	c
,	c
we	c
can	c
go	c
there	c
right	c
after	c
because	c
we	c
will	c
have	c
full	i
of	c
time	c
to	c
shopping	i
during	c
our	c
free	c
time	c
on	c
Wednesday	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
pleased	c
to	c
recieve	i
you	i
letter	c
ricently	i
.	c

-	i
I	c
like	c
to	c
wake	c
up	c
with	c
a	c
view	c
to	i
mountains	c
,	c
wich	i
remind	i
me	c
about	i
my	c
5	c
years	i
experience	c
in	i
climbing	c
.	c

Also	c
I	c
enjoy	c
walking	c
and	c
photography	c
.	c

Do	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
bring	c
any	c
special	c
clothes	c
or	c
gize	i
?	c

If	c
you	c
would	i
ask	i
me	c
,	c
I	c
prefer	c
my	c
friends	c
to	c
do	c
all	c
shoping	i
for	c
me	c
.	c

Because	c
I	c
aware	i
of	c
big	i
lines	i
to	i
check	i
point	i
,	c
crowds	c
of	c
people	c
,	c
noise	c
...	c

My	c
name	c
is	c
Sam	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
was	c
disappointed	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
wanted	c
to	c
see	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
in	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

You	c
wrote	c
'	c
discouts	i
available	c
'	c
but	c
they	c
did	c
n't	c
discount	i
.	c

The	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
of	c
being	c
repaired	c
.	c

(	c
Hotel	c
number	c
)	c
.	c

I	i
think	i
there	i
is	i
nothing	i
not	i
to	i
be	i
influenced	i
by	i
science	i
and	i
technology	i
affects	i
in	i
our	i
daily	i
life	i
nowadays	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
answer	i
how	c
modern	c
technology	c
has	c
changed	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
as	c
a	c
housewife	c
.	c

I	c
always	c
use	c
many	c
electric	c
products	i
;	c
washing	c
machine	c
,	c
dish-washer	c
,	c
vacuum	c
cleaner	c
,	c
blender	c
,	c
juice	i
,	c
fridge	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
if	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
washing	i
machine	c
,	c
I	c
will	i
have	c
to	c
wash	c
all	c
clothes	i
myself	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
also	c
to	c
have	c
more	c
information	c
about	c
the	c
cost	c
and	c
which	i
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
you	c
suggest	c
to	i
bring	i
with	c
me	c
.	c

Interesting	i
will	i
be	i
to	c
show	c
how	c
the	c
lessons	c
are	c
organize	i
,	c
saing	i
that	c
we	c
are	c
never	c
doing	c
just	c
one	c
activitie	i
during	c
the	c
class	c
.	c

First	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
my	c
company	c
is	c
going	c
to	c
close	c
for	c
holiday	i
at	c
that	c
period	i
and	c
it	c
would	c
suits	i
me	c
very	c
well	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
won	c
various	c
little	c
tennis	c
tournaments	c
in	c
my	c
country	c
and	c
abroad	c
.	i

Please	c
let	c
me	c
know	c
which	i
clothes	c
do	i
I	c
need	c
then	i
and	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
in	c
cash	c
and	c
as	i
travellers	c
cheque	i
shall	i
I	c
take	c
with	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
completely	c
agree	c
with	c
this	c
statement	c
.	c

Although	c
from	c
my	c
point	c
of	c
view	c
she	c
planned	c
the	c
murder	c
of	c
his	c
uncle	c
and	c
was	c
able	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
.	i

The	c
plan	c
was	c
almost	c
perfectly	i
and	c
the	c
police	c
had	i
n't	i
discovered	i
the	c
murderer	c
without	c
the	c
help	c
of	c
Mr.	c
Poirot	c
.	c

Moreover	c
she	c
must	c
have	c
had	c
an	i
"	i
ice	i
blood	i
"	i
and	c
strong	c
nerves	c
to	c
handle	c
in	i
that	c
way	c
.	c

Mr.	c
Manager	c
,	c

I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
to	c
see	c
a	c
musical	c
show	c
called	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
disappointed	c
after	i
it	c
.	c

Why	c
did	c
you	c
write	c
that	c
they	c
were	c
available	c
?	c

Yours	c
sincerlly	i
,	c

Modern	c
technology	c
has	c
got	i
a	c
big	c
influence	c
on	c
our	c
life	c
.	c

Also	c
Iternet	i
has	c
influence	i
on	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
,	c
beause	i
I	c
can	c
find	c
there	c
many	c
interesting	c
things	c
,	c
or	c
I	c
can	c
meet	c
with	c
people	c
from	c
all	c
over	c
the	c
world	c
which	i
is	c
exciting	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
life	c
with	i
out	i
modern	c
technology	c
would	c
be	c
simple	i
and	c
borring	i
that	c
's	c
why	c
I	c
am	c
using	c
it	c
in	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
,	i
I	c
am	c
happy	c
that	c
there	c
is	c
such	c
thing	i
as	c
modern	c
technology	c
.	c

June	c
2000	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
travel	c
on	i
July	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
manager	c
so	c
I	c
can	i
not	i
travel	c
another	c
time	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
sing	c
and	c
photograph	i
,	i
I	c
've	c
done	c
a	c
course	c
about	i
photography	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
good	c
on	i
it	c
.	c

I	c
bought	c
everything	c
I	c
wanted	c
.	c

Now	c
I	c
was	c
without	c
my	c
money	c
and	c
my	c
wallet	c
.	c

I	c
went	c
to	c
see	c
who	c
was	c
there	c
.	c

'	c
It	i
's	i
me	c
!	c
'	c

I	c
said	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
afternoon	c
,	c
the	c
River	i
trip	c
to	c
Greenwich	c
would	i
also	c
be	c
a	c
fantastic	c
experience	c
for	c
us	c
.	c

The	c
reason	c
I	c
write	c
to	c
you	c
,	i
is	c
that	c
we	c
have	c
seen	c
an	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
,	c
for	i
a	i
fiew	i
days	i
.	c

It	c
would	c
be	c
exciting	c
,	i
if	c
we	c
had	c
the	c
possibility	i
,	i
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

Who	c
got	c
married	c
,	c
who	c
got	c
divorsed	i
or	c
who	c
had	i
a	c
remarkeable	i
changing	i
of	i
his	c
complexion	c
,	c
these	c
are	c
questions	c
,	i
who	i
most	c
journalists	c
are	c
interested	c
in	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
sometimes	c
a	c
real	c
fight	c
who	c
will	c
take	c
the	c
first	c
picture	c
of	c
a	c
film	c
star	c
or	c
a	c
politician	c
.	c

Famous	c
people	c
diserve	i
also	i
to	c
have	c
a	c
private	c
life	c
.	c

That	c
fact	c
should	c
be	c
respected	c
by	c
the	c
journalists	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
a	c
musical	c
show	c
called	c
'	c
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	i
,	i
that	c
took	i
place	i
in	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
.	c

The	c
first	c
problem	c
was	c
about	c
the	c
actors	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
advertisment	i
it	c
was	c
clearly	c
written	c
that	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
would	c
play	c
main	i
roles	c
.	c

The	c
advertisment	i
said	c
that	c
the	c
show	c
would	c
start	c
at	c
19:30	c
but	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
waiting	c
for	c
the	c
show	c
for	c
a	i
half-an-hour	i

Yours	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

It	c
was	c
wonderful	c
!	c

A	c
friend	c
of	c
mine	c
was	c
organising	c
a	i
pop	c
concert	c
,	c
and	c
as	c
he	c
knew	c
me	c
well	c
,	c
he	c
asked	c
me	c
if	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
design	c
the	c
clothes	c
the	c
pop	c
singers	c
would	c
wear	c
in	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
something	c
I	c
will	c
never	c
forget	c
.	c

And	c
tell	c
me	c
,	c
are	c
you	c
planning	c
coming	i
back	c
to	c
visit	c
me	c
?	c

Please	c
let	c
me	c
know	c
if	c
you	c
have	c
some	c
days	c
free	c
so	c
as	i
to	i
organise	i
a	c
little	c
journey	c
together	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
writeng	i
with	c
reference	c
to	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

I	c
always	c
dreamed	c
about	c
going	c
to	c
the	i
California	c
and	c
now	c
my	c
dreams	c
are	c
coming	c
truth	i
.	c

It	c
's	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
things	c
for	c
me	c
,	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
chance	c
to	c
forget	c
about	c
all	c
my	c
present	c
,	c
luxurious	c
life	c
and	c
try	c
doing	c
something	c
different	c
.	c

I	c
've	c
always	c
wanted	c
to	c
learn	c
singing	i
professionaly	i
,	c
but	c
I	c
've	c
never	c
had	c
an	c
occasion	i
.	c

I	c
'm	c
very	c
keen	c
on	c
swimming	c
,	c
too	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
sorry	c
I	c
have	c
n't	c
rewritten	i
sooner	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
busy	c
.	c

I	c
worked	c
all	c
days	i
,	c
but	c
I	c
did	c
it	c
with	c
pleasure	c
.	c

We	i
lived	i
here	i
in	i
rush	i
,	i
but	c
there	c
was	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
fun	c
,	c
too	c
.	c

One	c
day	c
I	c
was	c
talking	c
to	c
Stenkovska	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
buy	c
something	c
to	c
eat	c
for	c
everyone	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
should	i
ask	c
her	c
what	c
did	i
she	c
want	i
.	c

If	c
I	c
were	c
she	i
,	c
I	c
would	c
kill	c
that	c
boy	c
,	c
but	c
she	c
was	c
nice	c
!	c

I	c
've	c
met	c
here	i
so	i
many	i
new	i
people	i
!	c

The	c
hardest	c
was	c
,	c
when	c
I	c
brought	c
a	c
pepperoni	c
pizza	c
for	c
kubulska	c
,	c
but	c
she	c
does	c
n't	c
eat	c
meat	c
!	c

You	c
have	c
to	c
admit	c
,	c
that	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
magnificent	c
.	c

O.K.	c
That	c
's	c
all	c
for	c
today	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
writting	i
this	c
letter	c
giving	c
some	c
opinions	c
about	c
the	c
three	c
days	c
that	c
the	c
class	c
will	c
spend	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

There	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
to	c
go	c
there	c
because	c
the	i
students	c
need	c
not	c
pay	c
anyting	i
.	c

I	c
'm	c
suggesting	c
how	c
programme	i
could	c
be	c
changed	c
.	c

The	c
fashion	c
starts	i
at	c
10:00	c
am	c
and	c
ends	c
at	c
19:00	c
p.m.	c
and	c
will	c
be	c
realized	i
on	c
14	c
March	c

so	c
we	c
can	c

the	c

this	c
event	c
that	i
is	c

in	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
;	i

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
and	c
for	c
this	c
competition	c
.	c

First	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
answer	c
your	c
questions	c
.	c

Because	i
,	i
the	c
only	c
time	c
I	c
can	c
take	c
holiday	i
is	c
July	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
log	c
cabins	c
,	i
I	c
think	c
they	c
are	c
more	c
comfortable	c
and	c
safer	c
than	c
tents	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
whather	i
you	c
have	c
competitions	c
or	c
different	i
activities	c
?	i

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
your	c
interest	c

It	c
's	c
been	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
not	i
to	i
write	i
to	c
you	c
,	i
I	c
'm	c
really	c
sorry	c
but	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
busy	c
.	c

And	c
at	c
the	c
time	c
of	c
concert	i
we	c
wore	c
a	i
big	c
funny	c
costume	i
,	c
and	c
danced	c
with	c
people	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr.	c
Robertson	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
a	c
student	c
of	i
the	c
FCE	c
class	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
in	i
name	i
of	i
my	c
class	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
the	c
programme	c
about	i
the	c
three	i
days	i
trip	c
to	c
London	c
that	c
you	c
have	c
prepared	c
for	c
us	c
.	c

We	c
have	c
discussed	c
the	c
programme	c
in	c
our	c
class	c
and	c
the	c
students	c
are	c
very	c
happy	c
about	c
that	c
especially	i
because	c
we	c
will	c
have	c
the	c
possibility	i
to	c
visit	c
the	c
Science	c
Museum	c
and	c
the	c
National	c
Gallery	c
.	c

There	c
will	c
be	c
the	c
latest	c
fashions	c
and	c
leisure	c
and	c
sports	c
wear	c
.	i

For	c
these	c
reasons	c
I	i
am	c
asking	c
you	c
if	c
we	c
can	c
go	c
there	c
on	c
Tuesday	i
's	i
afternoon	c
.	c

You	c
can	c
give	c
the	c
possibility	i
to	c
the	c
students	c
too	i
choose	c
between	c
go	i
shopping	c
or	c
go	i
to	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

The	c
show	c
will	c
be	c
at	c
the	c
Central	c
Exhibition	c
Hall	c
and	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
opened	i
until	c
7.	c
pm	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
even	c
free	c
for	c
students	c
!	c
!	c

I	c
agree	c
with	c
this	c
statement	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
famous	c
people	c
deserve	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
private	c
life	c
like	c
all	c
the	c
normal	c
people	c
,	c
without	c
journalists	c
following	c
them	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
.	c

If	c
one	c
is	c
famous	c
it	i
has	c
to	c
accept	c
also	c
the	c
disadvantages	c
of	c
be	i
famous	c
.	c

First	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
afraid	c
but	i
I	c
can	c
travel	i
only	i
in	c
July	c
.	c

Yun	c
Sandra	c

I	c
love	c
shopping	c
.	c

Otherwise	c
they	c
can	c
have	c
lots	c
of	c
problem	i
and	c
difficult	i
to	c
live	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	i
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

Secondly	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
one	c
hour	c
fifteen	i
past	i
after	i
.	c

We	c
arrived	c
at	c
the	c
theatre	c
in	i
time	c
and	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
wait	c
all	c
that	c
time	c
until	c
the	c
show	c
began	c
.	c

He	c
stayed	c
looking	c
at	c
me	c
and	c
laughing	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
incredible	c
.	c

Defineteley	i
,	c
I	c
want	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c
.	c

Well	c
,	c
it	i
was	c
the	c
beginning	c
of	c
my	c
tragedy	c
.	c

In	i
that	i
precisely	i
moment	i
I	c
realized	c
that	c
I	c
had	c
forgotten	c
to	c
tell	c
her	c
that	c
Ann	c
was	c
Mr	c
Harter	c
's	c
niece	c
.	c

But	c
,	c
well	c
,	c
unhappiness	i
started	c
with	c
Pat	c
and	c
my	c
reveilled	i
secrets	c
.	c

For	c
the	c
activities	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
chose	i
the	c
Tennis	i
activities	i
,	c
which	c
I	c
am	c
not	c
too	c
bad	c
at	c
,	c
and	c
climbing	c
,	c
Which	i
I	c
have	c
never	c
done	c
but	c
must	i
be	c
interesting	c
.	c

I	c
Would	i
like	c
to	c
Know	i
if	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
take	c
any	c
clothes	c
,	c
and	c
,	c
if	c
yes	i
,	c
What	i
Kind	i
of	i
Clothes	i
?	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
pleased	c
to	c
learn	c
that	c
I	c
had	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
!	c

I	c
'd	c
prefer	c
to	c
sleep	c
in	c
tents	c
rather	c
than	c
log	c
cabins	c
:	c
sleeping	c
in	c
tents	c
seems	c
to	c
correspond	c
to	c
a	c
"	c
spirit	c
of	c
adventure	c
"	c
to	c
me	c
,	c
what	i
I	c
particularly	c
like	c
;	c
in	i
the	i
opposite	i
,	c
log	c
cabins	c
are	c
more	c
"	c
traditional	c
"	c
and	c
a	c
less	c
interesting	c
experience	c
.	c

Please	c
,	c
do	c
n't	c
forget	c
to	c
tell	c
me	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
need	c
.	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c

But	c
this	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
the	c
case	c
:	c
at	c
first	c
,	c
you	c
see	c
a	c
very	c
pretty	c
item	c
which	c
you	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
try	c
.	i

Hopeful	i
,	c
you	c
try	c
to	c
find	c
the	c
same	c
thing	c
in	c
another	c
shop	c
.	c

You	c
ask	c
the	c
seller	i
for	c
your	c
size	c
.	c

His	c
answer	c
is	c
:	c
"	c
Everything	c
is	c
here	c
,	c
Madam	c
!	c
"	c

As	c
you	c
understand	c
that	c
you	c
wo	c
n't	c
get	c
any	c
help	c
,	c
you	c
waste	c
your	c
time	c
looking	c
for	c
the	c
right	c
size	c
.	c

At	i
the	i
time	i
you	c
realise	c
it	i
,	c
you	c
also	c
realise	c
that	c
the	c
shop	c
is	c
closing	c
in	c
five	c
minutes	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr.	c
Ryan	c
:	c

Another	c
point	c
mentioned	c
was	c
the	c
choice	c
of	c
activities	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
try	c
sailing	c
as	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
sailed	c
before	c
and	c
also	c
climbing	c
as	c
I	c
enjoy	c
hiking	c
a	c
lot	c
.	c

I	c
actually	c
have	c
much	i
resistance	i
and	c
balance	c
so	c
that	c
will	c
help	c
me	c
in	c
both	c
activities	c
.	c

Now	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
request	c
some	c
information	c
about	c
clothes	c
and	c
money	c
.	c

Right	c
size	c
,	c
right	c
colour	c

However	c
that	i
impression	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
true	c
.	c

Everyone	c
enjoys	c
wearing	c
nice	c
new	c
clothes	c
,	i
however	i
do	i
we	c
really	c
like	c
the	c
process	c
of	c
chosing	i
them	c
?	c

At	c
times	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
not	c
only	c
the	i
matter	c
of	c
having	c
to	c
make	c
a	c
choice	c
but	c
the	c
trouble	c
of	c
finding	c
something	c
,	i
which	c
can	c
kill	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
time	c
and	c
specially	i
when	c
your	c
does	i
n't	c
fit	c
with	i
the	i
in	i
fashion	c
.	c

What	c
is	c
more	c
,	c
we	c
can	c
say	c
that	c
price	c
is	c
often	c
very	c
off-putting	c
as	c
well	c
.	c

Then	c
,	c
I	c
consider	c
a	i
pain	c
having	c
to	c
go	c
around	c
some	c
more	c
still	c
thinking	c
of	c
that	c
same	c
dress	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
going	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
what	c
I	c
feel	c
.	c

You	c
have	c
to	c
be	c
quiet	c
an	i
attention	i
in	c
class	c
if	c
you	c
would	i
n't	i
to	i
be	c
punished	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
happy	c
because	c
my	c
parents	c
allow	c
me	c
to	c
do	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
things	c
.	c

Love	c
,	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
happy	c
to	c
see	c
your	c
musical	c
show	c
but	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
it	c
has	c
been	c
a	c
very	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
.	c

At	c
first	c
my	c
favourite	c
actor	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
did	c
n't	c
perform	c
without	i
any	c
explictions	i
,	i
and	c
the	c
show	c
should	c
started	i
at	c
19:30	c
instead	c
of	c
20:15	c
!	c
!	c

I	c
was	c
sure	c
that	c
discouts	i
were	c
available	c
because	c
I	c
have	i
read	c
it	i
,	i
but	c
at	c
the	c
tickets	i
office	c
they	c
did	c
n't	c
accept	i
them	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
payed	i
the	i
ticket	c
.	c

After	c
the	c
show	c
I	c
was	c
hungry	c
so	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
restaurant	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
!	c

Yours	c
Faithfully	c

But	c
when	c
he	c
walked	c
out	c
the	i
station	c
he	c
realised	c
that	c
he	c
have	i
lost	i
the	c
suitcase	c
on	c
the	c
train	c
.	c

Then	c
he	c
waited	c
for	c
the	c
next	c
train	c
to	c
London	c
and	c
he	c
caught	c
it	c
.	c

He	c
was	c
so	c
happy	c
!	c

She	c
was	c
so	c
angry	c
and	c
confused	c
because	c
Jim	c
have	i
n't	i
told	c
her	c
the	c
truth	c
.	c

In	c
your	c
advertisement	c
said	i
the	c
show	c
will	i
start	c
at	c
19:30	c
however	i
it	c
began	c
at	c
20:15	c
.	c

I	c
can	c
understand	c
that	c
a	c
musical	c
show	c
has	c
to	c
be	c
prepared	c
and	c
it	c
takes	c
time	c
.	c

I	c
explained	c
to	c
you	c
every	c
detail	c
about	c
what	c
happened	c
in	i
the	c
musical	c
show	c
and	c
I	c
want	c
you	c
refund	i
my	c
money	c
and	c
send	c
to	i
me	c
an	c
apology	c
for	c
what	c
happenned	i
there	c

Dear	c
Ms	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
.	c

Because	c
I	c
have	c
had	c
experiance	i
to	i
leve	i
in	c
tent	i
and	c
I	c
like	c
it	c
very	c
much	c
.	c

I	c
play	i
tennis	c
since	c
I	c
was	c
ten	c
years	c
of	c
age	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
just	c
finished	c
profesional	i
photographer	i
course	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
continiew	i
my	c
education	c
in	c
this	c
activity	c
.	c

Look	i
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

Like	c
I	c
said	c
,	c
I	i
'd	i
helped	i
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
.	c

I	c
liked	c
it	c
very	c
much	c
.	c

While	i
this	c
concert	c
I	c
saw	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
popular	c
singers	c

Love	c
,	c

I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
,	c
three	c
weeks	c
ago	c
,	c
to	c
see	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
,	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
that	c
was	c
played	i
at	c
this	i
moment	i
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
this	c
evening	c
was	c
very	c
far	c
to	i
be	i
perfect	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
ask	c
you	c
for	c
my	c
money	c
,	c
I	i
spent	c
for	i
this	c
horrible	c
evening	c
in	c
your	c

Your	i
Faithfully	c

Modern	c
technologies	c
are	c
part	c
of	c
our	c
daily	c
life	c
,	c
everything	c
we	c
do	c
is	c
simplified	c
by	c
these	c
new	c
technologies	c
.	c

However	c
the	c
concerts	c
were	c
great	c
,	c
but	c
unfortunately	c
,	c
some	c
concert	c
halls	c
were	c
too	c
small	c
and	c
it	c
was	c
as	c
hot	c
as	c
a	i
micro-wave	i
inside	c

If	c
you	c
are	c
a	c
really	c
good	c
student	c
in	c
one	c
subject	c
,	c
you	c
can	c
provide	c
private	c
lessons	c
which	i
is	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
most	c
prolific	i
job	i
but	i
do	c
it	c
only	c
if	c
you	c
like	c
teaching	c
.	c

The	c
main	c
thing	c
to	c
remember	c
is	c
that	c
there	c
many	i
possibilities	c
but	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
try	c
to	c
find	c
them	c
and	c
not	c
just	c
say	c
:	c
"	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
work	c
and	c
earn	c
money	c
"	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c

you	c

Many	c

I	c
have	i
never	i
imagined	i
I	c
had	i
to	c
face	c
this	c
situation	c
.	c

I	c
joined	c
with	i
an	c
expedition	c
team	i
in	c
order	c
to	c
explore	c
the	c
Rocky	c
Mountains	c
.	c

We	c
planned	c
a	c
programme	i
.	c

The	c
landscapes	i
were	i
the	c
most	c
beautiful	c
that	c
I	c
had	c
ever	c
seen	c
before	i
.	c

The	c
weather	c
was	c
delightful	c
,	c
except	c
this	i
afternoon	c
when	c
started	i
to	c
rain	c
and	c
we	c
decide	i
to	c
stay	c
during	i
the	c
night	c
inside	c
a	c
hole	c
in	c
the	c
wall	i
of	c
the	c
mountain	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

I	i
was	c
going	c
to	c
begin	c
at	c
19.30	c
but	c
It	c
began	c
at	c
20.15	c
and	c
the	c
problem	c
was	c
that	c
It	c
was	c
raining	c
.	c

I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
explain	c
too	c
that	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
see	c
that	i
you	c
made	i
discounts	i
to	c
no	i
one	i
.	c

I	c
was	c
queuing	c
for	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
and	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
see	c
it	c
.	i

And	c
we	c
were	c
very	c
hungry	c
after	c
being	c
three	c
hours	c
in	c
the	c
theatre	c
.	c

And	c
that	i
are	c
all	c
problems	i
I	c
found	i
.	c

Yours	c
,	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

I	c
liked	c
a	c
boy	c
who	c
was	c
in	c
the	c
same	c
class	c
.	c

And	c
when	c
we	c
finished	c
the	i
secundary	i
school	c
,	c
I	c
decided	c
go	c
to	c
a	c
foreign	c
University	c
.	c

I	c
spend	i
five	c
years	c
there	c
,	c
although	c
I	c
came	c
all	i
summers	i
and	c
we	c
continued	c
going	c
out	c
as	c
we	c
did	i
before	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
finished	c
I	c
return	i
to	c
my	c
city	c
to	c
find	c
a	c
job	c
.	c

A	i
day	c
,	c
Pat	c
told	c
me	c
that	c
we	i
was	c
talking	c
with	c
this	c
boy	c
and	c
that	c
he	c
told	c
her	c
that	c
I	i
like	i
him	i
and	c
immediately	c
she	c
told	c
him	c
that	c
he	i
liked	c
me	i
too	c
.	c

A	c
week	c
after	c
that	c
I	c
found	c
him	c
in	c
a	c
coffee	i
and	c
he	c
asked	c
me	c
if	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
be	c
his	c
girlfriend	c
and	c
I	c
accepted	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
,	c

However	c
,	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
did	c
not	c
appear	c
in	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
another	c
actor	c
.	c

It	c
started	c
at	c
20.15	c
,	c
not	c
at	c
19.30	c
as	c
it	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
be	i
.	c

The	c
manager	c
said	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
they	c
had	c
not	c
been	c
informed	c
that	c
there	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
show	c
in	i
that	c
date	c
.	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
a	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
.	c

And	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
appreciate	c
if	i
you	c
give	i
me	c
a	c
refund	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

People	c
will	c
use	i
yellow	c
,	c
pink	c
and	c
green	c
clothes	c
.	c

This	c
way	c
,	c
people	c
tend	c
to	c
be	c
happier	c

They	c
will	c
wear	c
a	i
clothe	i
only	c
if	c
they	c
feel	c
good	c
wearing	c
it	c
.	c

Now	c
all	c
the	c
town	c
knew	i
my	c
secret	c
.	c

This	c
is	c
a	c
very	c
embarrassed	i
situation	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
to	c
leave	c
this	c
town	c
.	c

My	c
god	c
,	c
I	c
never	c
should	c
have	c
told	c
my	c
sister	c
this	c
secret	c
.	c

We	c
come	i
here	c
to	c
build	c
our	c
own	c
house	c
because	c
my	c
father	c
had	c
been	c
fired	c
and	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
sell	c
our	c
house	c
in	c
Buenos	c
Aires	c
.	c

Cassually	i
my	c
cousin	c
had	i
the	c
same	c
age	c
as	c
me	c
,	c
sixteen	c
,	c
that	c
's	c
the	c
reason	c
for	i
we	c
started	c
a	i
friendly	c
relationship	c
.	c

I	c
never	i
had	c
a	c
boyfriend	c
and	c
I	c
felt	i
in	c
love	c
with	c
him	c
.	c

I	c
felt	c
that	c
I	c
had	c
discovered	c
other	i
ways	i
.	c

In	c
fact	c
,	c
I	c
did	i
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
,	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
we	c
have	c
been	c
informed	c
that	c
students	c
are	c
allowed	c
to	c
see	i
this	c
exhibition	c
without	i
paying	i
money	i
.	c

I	c
had	c
to	c
hit	c
a	c
human	c
being	c
and	c
unfortunately	c
,	c
although	c
I	c
respect	c
every	c
form	c
of	c
life	c
humans	i
,	c
animals	c
and	c
plants	c
,	c
I	c
managed	c
to	c
hit	c
a	c
burglar	c
.	c

Three	c
months	c
ago	c
,	c
I	c
cannot	c
forget	c
this	c
day	c
,	c
my	c
parents	c
visited	c
my	c
aunt	c
at	i
hospital	c
as	c
she	c
was	c
ill	c
.	c

While	c
I	c
was	c
listening	c
to	c
my	c
favourite	c
cassette	c
,	c
I	c
heard	c
a	c
strange	c
noise	c
.	c

I	c
shouted	c
as	c
I	i
pained	i
.	c

I	c
ran	c
quickly	c
and	c
I	c
managed	c
to	c
escape	c
from	c
him	c
,	c
I	c
found	c
one	i
hidden	c
wooden	c
spoon	c
and	c
while	c
he	c
was	c
passing	c
in	c
front	c
of	c
me	c
I	c
hit	c
him	c
.	c

My	c
name	c
is	c
Yakimo	c
Nashoto	c
,	i
I	c
study	c
in	c
France	c
and	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
London	c
just	c
to	c
see	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
because	c
all	c
my	c
friends	c
told	c
me	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
"	c
great	c
"	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
was	c
not	c
there	c
,	i
I	c
was	c
very	c
upset	c
because	c
he	c
is	c
my	c
favorite	i
singer	c
and	c
it	i
was	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
reasons	c
why	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
see	c
this	c
show	c
.	c

Some	c
of	c
my	c
friends	c
live	c
in	i
overseas	c
,	i
we	i
keep	c
in	c
touch	c
by	i
e-mails	c
,	i
it	i
is	c
a	c
very	c
good	c
way	c
for	i
communicating	i
because	c
it	c
is	c
much	c
cheaper	c
than	c
a	c
phone	c
call	c
and	c
we	c
can	c
re-read	c
mails	i
and	c
keep	c
them	c
forever	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
very	c
useful	c
for	c
several	c
reasons	c
:	c

when	c
I	c
go	c
out	c
,	c
sometimes	c
my	c
parents	c
are	c
worried	c
so	c
they	c
phone	c
to	i
me	c
if	i
everything	c
is	c
going	i
alright	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writting	i
in	c
order	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
"	c
Over	c

"	c
.	c

Another	c
thing	c
,	c
the	c
tickets	c

I	c
think	c
the	c
theatre	c
should	c
give	c
me	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
and	c
I	c
hope	c
you	c
do	c
it	i

Yours	c

More	c

more	c
people	c

Our	c

that	c

because	c

I	c
am	c

about	c
a	c
musical	c
show	c
which	c
is	c
called	c
"	c
Over	c
The	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
and	c
ask	c
for	c
money	i
back	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
the	c
poster	c
told	c
me	c
that	c
this	c
show	c
was	i
performed	i
by	i
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
but	c
there	c
was	i
different	c
actor	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
so	c
disappointed	c
.	c

I	c
have	i
been	i
waiting	c
for	c
45	c
minuties	i
.	c

The	c
poster	c
also	c
told	c
me	c
that	c
I	c
could	c
visit	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

In	i
an	i
every	i
single	c
day	c
,	c
many	i
modern	i
technology	i
is	i
produced	i
and	c
it	c
really	c
affects	i
or	i
changes	i
our	c
daily	c

It	c
just	c
takes	c
you	c
a	c
few	c

How	c

this	c
letter	c
to	c
you	c

I	c
'm	c
very	c
disappointed	c
and	c
I	c
believe	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
hang	i
me	c
some	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

Before	c
I	c
bought	c
my	c
ticket	c
and	c
booked	i
train	c
and	c
hotel	c
reservations	c
I	c
'd	c
read	c
a	c
lot	c
good	i
reviews	c
about	i
that	c
show	c
and	c
I	c
thought	c
it	c
was	i
a	c
great	c
moment	i
to	c
share	c
with	c
friends	c
.	c

But	c
that	c
evening	c
became	c
a	c
real	c
nightmare	c
!	c

Discounts	c
available	c
?	c
?	c

and	c
what	c
!	c
!	c

To	c
summarize	c
I	i
want	c
that	i
you	c
hang	i
me	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
and	c
very	c
quickly	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

You	c
also	c
refer	i
to	i
your	c
advertisement	c
that	c
there	c
are	c
some	c
discounts	c
available	c
but	c
there	c
were	c
n't	c
any	c
.	c

At	i
the	i
end	i
because	i
I	c
;	i
had	i
n't	i
have	c
a	c
perfect	c
evening	c
but	c
a	c
very	c
disappointing	c
one	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
the	c
right	c
to	c
ask	c
my	i
money	c
back	c
.	c

Modern	c
technology	c
changed	i
not	c
only	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
but	c
also	c
the	c
life	i
of	c
many	c
people	c
.	c

Now	c
let	c
's	c
talk	c
about	c
me	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
I	i
do	c
n't	c
have	c
to	c
worry	c
n	i
the	c
morning	c
if	i
I	i
miss	i
the	c
bus	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
my	c
alarm	c
clock	c
to	c
wake	c
me	c
in	c
time	c
.	c

So	i
I	c
turn	c
on	c
the	c
aircondition	i
with	c
timer	i
so	c
when	c
I	c
get	i
sleep	i
to	i
turn	i
off	c
by	c
itself	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
wake	c
up	c
if	i
I	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
homework	c
I	c
sit	c
on	i
my	c
computer	c
and	c
play	c
different	c
games	c
to	c
spend	i
my	c
time	c
.	c

At	i
the	c
evenings	c
before	c
I	c
got	i
to	c
bed	c
I	c
sit	c
in	c
the	c
living	c
room	c
and	c
watch	c
TV	c
through	i
the	i
sattelite	i
.	c

As	c
regards	c
your	c
questions	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
at	c
the	c
moment	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
student	c
and	c
my	c
summer	c
holiday	c
will	c
start	c
on	c
27th	c
June	c
so	c
I	c
can	c
go	c
to	c
U.S.A	i
in	c
July	c
and	c
I	c
prefer	c
staying	c
in	c
tents	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
experienced	c
camping	c
in	c
the	i
tent	c
.	c

And	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
have	c
chances	c
to	c
play	c
tennis	c
and	c
go	c
swimming	c
.	c

In	c
case	i
of	c
swimming	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
really	c
good	c
at	c
it	c
but	c
I	c
just	c
started	c
playing	c
tennis	c
before	i
3	i
weeks	i
.	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
very	i
enjoying	c
playing	c
tennis	c
.	c

Further	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
a	c
question	c
.	c

Actually	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
gone	i
camping	c
so	c
I	c
really	c
have	c
no	c
idea	c
about	c
that	c
.	c

I	c
wonder	c
which	c
clothes	c
are	c
suitable	c
for	c
your	c
camping	c
.	c

And	c
How	c
about	c
the	c
money	c
?	c

I	c
am	c
really	c
expecting	i
going	c
camping	c

Dear	c
Mr.	c
Robertson	c
,	c

We	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
this	c
London	c
trip	c
and	c
your	c
programme	c
related	i
to	i
it	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
really	i
good	c
programme	c
,	c
especially	i
visiting	c
Science	i
Museum	c
and	c
National	i
Art	c
Gallery	c
would	c
be	c
great	i
opportunity	c
to	c
learn	c
about	c
art	c
and	c
latest	i
improvements	i
in	c
science	c
.	c

Thanking	c
in	i
advance	c
,	c
we	c
very	c
much	c
hope	c
that	c
you	c
will	c
give	c
your	c
attention	c
to	c
our	c
requirement	i
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

This	c
is	c
the	c
most	c
argueing	i
point	c
.	c

Because	c
,	i
althoug	i
they	c
are	c
famous	c
they	c
have	i
also	i
their	c
private	c
life	c
.	c

This	c
can	i
not	i
be	c
the	c
way	c
in	i
finding	i
information	i
for	i
the	i
readers	i
.	c

I	c
cannot	c
express	c
how	c
happy	c
I	c
was	c
reading	c
your	c
letter	c
about	c
the	c
prize	c
I	c
won	c
and	c
about	c
2	c
wonderful	c
weeks	c
I	c
am	c
going	c
to	c
spend	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
in	c
the	c
USA	c
.	c

I	c
will	c
still	c
be	c
at	c
school	c
in	c
June	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
going	c
to	c
spend	c
the	c
whole	c
August	i
on	c
a	c
training	c
camp	c
with	c
my	c
club	c
.	c

It	c
seems	c
like	c
a	c
good	c
oportunity	i
to	c
practice	i
it	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
appreciate	c
if	i
you	c
could	c
send	c
me	c
some	c
information	c
about	c
the	c
weather	c
in	c
California	c
at	c
this	c
time	c
of	c
year	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
a	c
little	c
concerned	c
about	c
the	c
clothes	c
that	c
I	c
should	c
take	c
.	c

Does	c
it	c
rain	c
a	c
lot	c
there	c
?	c

Another	c
thing	c
is	c
money	c
.	c

Will	c
you	c
arrange	c
a	c
place	c
where	c
I	c
could	c
keep	c
the	c
money	c
secure	i
during	c
my	c
stay	c
at	c
the	c
camp	c
?	c

"	c
Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
"	c

In	c
my	c
humble	c
opinion	c
,	c
shopping	c
is	c
one	c
of	c
he	i
most	c
stressful	c
and	c
boring	c
activities	c
people	c
do	c
in	c
life	c
.	c

If	c
I	c
was	c
asked	c
to	c
choose	c
the	c
least	c
attractive	c
thing	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
do	c
on	c
everyday	i
basis	c
,	c
shopping	c
would	c
most	c
definitely	c
be	c
placed	c
somewhere	c
on	i
top	i
of	c
the	c
list	c
.	c

If	c
it	c
would	i
be	i
possible	c
I	c
would	c
rather	c
have	c
someone	c
else	c
doing	c
shopping	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr.	c
Robertson	c
,	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
your	c
programme	c
but	i
we	c
have	c
another	c
plan	c
to	i
go	c
to	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
which	i
unluckily	i
on	i
the	c
same	c
day	c
as	c
the	c
day	c
we	c
would	c
visit	c
the	c
Science	c
Museum	i
so	i
we	c
would	c
like	c
you	c
to	c
change	c
the	c
plan	c
a	c
little	c
.	c

With	c
great	c
respect	c
,	c

I	c
climed	i
up	c
the	c
tree	c
.	c

Mom	i
came	c
in	c
,	c
looking	c
very	c
angry	c
,	i
I	c
prayed	c
for	c
a	c
short	c
conversation	c
.	c

There	c
were	c
no	c
discounts	c
on	c
the	c
ticket	i
available	c
either	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
have	c
the	c
money	c
back	c
that	c
I	c
spent	c
on	c
the	c
tickets	c
I	c
bought	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c
.	c

Yesterday	c
when	c
I	c
arrived	c
to	i
the	i
college	c
,	c
I	c
saw	c
Pat	c
standing	c
with	c
Peter	c
and	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
other	c
boys	c
and	c
they	c
were	c
looking	c
strange	i
at	c
me	c
and	c
laufhing	i
.	c

I	c
felt	c
how	c
I	c
started	c
to	c
blush	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
classroom	c
it	c
became	c
even	c
worser	i
.	c

In	c
the	c
lunchbreak	i
I	c
went	c
to	c
Pat	c
and	c
asked	c
her	c
why	c
she	c
had	c
told	c
him	c
the	c
secret	c
,	c
but	c
she	c
just	c
ignored	c
me	c
like	c
she	c
did	c
n't	c
know	c
me	c
.	c

After	c
that	c
I	c
never	c
went	c
back	c
to	c
the	c
course	c
again	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
the	c
play	c
started	c
nearly	c
an	c
hour	c
later	c
as	i
I	c
expected	c
!	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
hoped	c
that	c
,	c
after	c
these	c
incidents	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
enjoy	c
myself	c
,	c
but	c
there	c
was	c
another	c
change	c
of	i
programme	i
:	c
starring	i
!	c

The	c
main	c
actor	c
,	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
was	c
changed	c
and	c
the	c
one	c
who	c
played	c
his	c
part	c
was	c
n't	c
as	c
good	c
as	c
I	c
expected	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

What	c

We	c
became	i
passive	c

we	c
follow	c
the	c

you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
your	c

of	c
1/6/00	c
I	i
was	c
really	c
amazed	c
with	i
the	c
new	i
that	c
I	c
'd	c
won	c
two	c
weeks	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
in	c
the	c
USA	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
is	i
going	c
to	c
be	c
more	c
confortable	i
for	c
me	c
due	c
that	i
I'am	i
very	c
sensitive	c
to	c
changes	c
of	c
temperature	c
and	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
take	c
the	c
risk	c
to	i
catch	i
a	c
cold	c
as	i
you	c
know	c
I	i
'm	c
going	c
to	c
start	c
to	c
work	c
.	c

The	c
activities	c
that	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
do	c
there	c
are	c
the	c
followings:-	i
Singing	c
(	c
I	c
'm	c
very	i
good	c
singer	c
)	c
;	c
swimming	c
(	i
I	i
'm	i
not	i
good	i
at	i
all	i
at	i
this	i
one	i
)	i
but	c
I	c
enjoy	c
to	i
spend	i
time	c
in	c
the	c
water	c
I	i
really	c
do	c
.	c

Looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

I	c
really	c
enjoyed	c
the	c
opportunity	c
to	c
talk	c
with	c
well	i
known	i
starts	i
and	c
to	c
learn	c
how	c
to	c
set	c
up	c
everything	c
for	c
a	c
concert	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
45	c
minutes	c
late	c

Modern	c
technology	c
has	c
changed	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
,	c
making	c
it	c
easy	c

with	c
less	c
effort	c
and	c
time	c

All	c
this	c
in	c
one	c
morning	c
,	c
and	c
the	c
day	c
just	i
begins	i

what	c

next	c
?	c

We	c
will	c
see	c
people	c
differently	c

with	i
more	c
calm	i

because	c
we	c
have	i
no	c
stress	c
and	c
we	c
are	c
not	c
in	c
a	c
hurry	c
to	c
do	c
something	c

We	c
will	c
be	c
more	c
comprehensible	i
with	c
others	c

All	c
this	c
modern	c

the	c
level	c

Conclusion	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
have	c
answers	c
to	c
your	c
questions	c
.	c

I	c
want	c
to	c
sleep	c
in	c
tents	c
because	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
's	c
more	c
adventurous	c
better	i
scenery	c
,	c
and	c
atmosphere	c
.	c

You	c
also	c
asked	c
me	c
about	c
the	c
two	c
things	c
I	c
'm	c
good	c
at	c
,	i
well	i
,	c
the	c
first	c
one	c
is	c
basketball	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
been	c
playing	c
basketball	c
for	c
roughly	i
about	i
4	c
years	c
.	c

I	c
love	c
basketball	c
because	c
I	c
'm	c
good	c
at	c
it	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
my	c
favourite	c
sport	c
.	c

Last	c
of	c
all	c
I	c
have	c
questions	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
.	c

Would	i
I	c
have	c
to	c
bring	c
many	c
clothes	c
e.g.	i
would	i
we	c
do	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
outdoor	c
activities	c
,	c
get	c
dirty	c
etc.	i
Would	i
I	c
need	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
money	c

is	c
due	i
to	i
the	c
great	c
amount	c
of	c
rubbish	c
we	c
are	c
providing	i
for	i
the	c
world	c
.	c

The	c
more	c
stuff	c
we	c
buy	c
the	i
more	c
we	c
throw	c
away	c
.	c

Therefor	i
you	c
should	c
think	c
more	c
carefully	c
about	c
what	c
you	c
are	c
about	c
to	c
buy	c
.	c

Would	c
you	c
rather	c
spend	c
money	c
on	c
something	c
which	c
is	c
destroying	c
the	c
world	c
or	c
do	c
sports	c
which	i
is	i
for	i
your	i
own	i
benefit	i
.	c

I	c
'm	c
writting	i
to	c
complain	c
about	c
your	c
theatre	c
and	c
its	c
last	i
night	i
show	i
.	c

The	c
main	c
character	c
of	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
,	c
which	i
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
say	c
was	c
n't	c
the	c
"	c
BEST	c
"	c
,	c
was	c
awfull	i

His	c
act	i
was	c
not	c
good	c
and	c
he	c
did	c
n't	c
seem	c
like	i
acting	c
Even	i
my	c
son	c
could	c
act	c
better	c
.	c

After	c
the	c
horrible	i
act	i
of	c
your	c
star	c
,	c
it	i
comes	c
the	c
starting	c
ours	i

I	c
was	c
sitting	c
and	i
waiting	c
for	c
forty	i
five	i
minutes	c
until	c
the	c
play	c
started	c
.	c

And	c
then	c
,	c
when	c
I	c
arrived	c
at	c
the	c
theatre	c
I	i
expected	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
discount	c
but	c
unfortunatly	i
I	c
did	c
n't	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
dissappointed	i
what	i
else	i
can	i
I	i
write	i

But	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c

I	c

Pat	c
started	c
shouting	c
and	c
screaming	c

saying	c
what	c
was	c
realy	i
going	c
on	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
inform	c
that	i
I	c
can	c
only	c
go	c
in	c
July	c
,	c
the	c

because	c
I	c

a	c

in	i
the	i
university	c
and	c
it	c
will	c
start	c
in	c

If	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
really	c
like	c
shopping	c
.	c

Sometime	i
when	c
I	c
'm	c
boring	i
and	c
ca	c
n't	c
find	c
something	c
else	c
to	c
do	c
.	i

I	c
go	c
look	c
round	c
shops	i
.	c

All	c
the	c
shops	c
are	c
full	c
of	c
people	c
,	c
and	c
people	c
treat	c
the	c
articals	i
like	c
rubbish	c
.	c

Mc	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
shopping	c
is	c
nice	i
to	c
spend	c
you	i
leisure	c
time	c
and	c
give	c
yourself	c
to	i
relax	c
sometimes	c
,	c
but	c
suggest	i
that	c
never	i
in	i
the	c
weekend	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	i
be	i
started	i
at	c
19:30	c
but	c
it	c
was	i
half	c
hour	i
later	c
,	c
until	i
20:15	c
.	c

The	c
last	c
thing	c
is	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
because	c
it	c
only	c
opened	c
until	c
9	c
o'clock	c
at	c
night	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
receiving	c
a	c
satisfactory	c
reply	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c
.	c

Nowadays	c
,	c
we	c
use	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
modern	c
technology	c
both	c
at	c
home	c
and	c
office	i
but	c
it	c
has	c
its	c
aventage	i
and	c
disaventage	i
.	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
I	c
believe	c
that	c
modern	c
technology	c
could	c
help	c
our	c
daily	c
life	c
but	c
we	c
should	c
not	c
alway	i
rely	c
on	c
it	c
.	c

Indeed	c
,	c
firstly	i
,	c
the	c
play	i
did	c
n't	c
start	c
at	c
19:30	c
as	c
it	c
was	c
planned	i
on	i
the	c
advertisement	c
but	c
45	c
minutes	c
later	c
(	c
20:15	c
)	c
.	c

I	c
told	c
myself	c
,	c
I	c
could	c
eat	c
over	c
there	c
and	c
maybe	c
spend	i
a	c
better	c
evening	c
than	c
at	i
the	c
begining	i
but	i
I	c
was	c
n't	c
lucky	c
because	c
the	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
!	c

The	c
customers	c
were	c
n't	c
told	c
why	c
they	c
could	c
n't	c
have	c
a	c
meal	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
can	c
notice	i
,	c
my	i
perfect	c
evening	c
I	c
had	c
supposed	i
,	i
was	c
a	c
nightmare	c
;	c
that	c
's	c
why	c
I	c
would	c
please	i
you	i
to	i
give	i
my	i
money	c
back	c
because	c
I	c
cannot	c
tolerate	c
such	c
a	c
thing	c
!	c

From	c
the	c
begining	i
of	c
the	c
century	c
to	c
now	c
,	c
modern	c
technology	c
has	c
changed	c
and	c
has	c
made	c
our	c
daily	c
life	c
easier	c
.	c

A	c
few	c
centuries	c
ago	c
,	c
it	c
took	c
many	c
hours	c
(	c
even	c
several	c
days	c
)	c
to	c
go	c
to	i
a	i
city	c
to	c
an	i
other	i
one	i
or	c
to	c
travel	c
abroad	c
.	c

People	c
could	c
n't	c
think	i
of	c
such	c
innovation	c
in	c
our	c
world	c
and	c
yet	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
created	c
.	c

Human	i
being	i
became	c
more	c
and	c
more	c
clever	c
and	c
built	c
wonerful	i
things	c
thanks	c
to	c
his	c
thoughts	c
and	c
his	c
hands	c
.	c

Everyone	c
gets	i
a	c
television	c
at	c
home	c
.	c

"	c
A	c
machine	c
which	c
talks	c
and	c
shows	c
pictures	c
!	c
"	c

Thus	c
,	c
the	i
modern	c
technology	c
seems	c
to	c
be	c
a	c
positive	c
way	c
in	i
order	i
to	c
improve	c
our	c
daily	c
life	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs.	c
Ryan	c
,	c

Of	c
course	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
same	i
skills	c
in	c
drawing	i
landscape	i
but	c
I	c
have	c
no	c
idea	c
about	c
photography	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
never	c
been	c
I	i
California	c
.	c

What	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
would	c
you	c
recommend	c
taking	c
with	c
me	c
?	c

Yours	c
faithfully	i

Last	c
month	c
I	c
enjoyed	c
helping	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
in	c
my	c
town	c
.	c

But	c
it	c
turned	c
out	c
as	i
a	c
funny	i
and	c
interesting	c
job	c
.	c

It	i
means	i
I	c
had	c
to	c
read	c
the	c
recipies	i
very	c
carefully	c
.	c

The	c
best	c
thing	c
was	c
that	c
I	c
learnd	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
new	c
cooking	c
ideas	c
and	c
I	c
could	c
observe	c
new	c
cooking	c
tricks	c
.	c

The	c
people	c
were	c
all	c
really	c
funny	c
and	c
we	c
were	c
a	c
good	c
team	c
.	c

The	c
time	c
was	i
quickly	c
over	i
and	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
great	c
experience	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
interested	c
to	c
hear	c
about	c
your	c
new	c
dog	c
?	c

I	c
am	c
deeply	c
disapointed	i
with	c
the	c
service	c
and	c
the	c
unrealiable	i
notice	i
,	i
at	c
your	c
theartre	i
.	c

In	c
your	c
advertisement	c
you	c
've	c
mention	c
"	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
"	c
would	c
be	c
starring	c
and	c
as	c
it	c
turned	c
out	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
different	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
.	c

Lastly	c
your	i
advertisement	c
mention	i
clearly	c
that	c
this	c
would	c
be	c
"	c
Your	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
!	c
"	c
but	c
sadly	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
real	c
waste	c
of	c
time	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
to	c
hear	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

For	i
the	c
past	c
100	c
year	i
,	c
fashion	c
has	c
change	i
a	c
great	c
deal	c
.	c

It	c
would	c
provide	c
you	c
with	c
a	c
new	c
type	c
of	c
material	c
to	c
cover	c
you	i
body	c
and	c
you	c
can	i
chosse	i
what	c
you	c
want	c
to	c
wear	c
by	c
pressing	c
bottons	i
.	c

This	c
would	c
be	c
very	c
easy	c
to	c
mantage	i
but	c
that	i
mean	i
no	c
shopping	i
for	c
girls	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
,	c
it	i
's	i
great	c
to	c
hear	c
for	i
about	c
my	c
winning	i
.	c

The	c
next	c
thing	c
is	c
,	i
that	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
a	c
log	c
cabine	i
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
want	c
to	c
sleep	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
'm	c
afraid	c
of	c
snakes	c
and	c
similar	c
animals	c
.	c

Another	c
thing	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
try	c
,	c
if	c
possible	c
,	c
is	c
to	c
play	c
Golf	i
.	c

I	c
'm	c
a	c
beginner	c
in	i
Golf	i
you	c
have	c
to	c
know	c
.	c

Is	c
July	c
a	c
hot	c
and	c
dry	c
month	c
or	c
is	i
it	c
raining	i
sometimes	c
?	c

The	c
concert	c
started	c
on	c
the	c
15th	c
of	c
may	i
and	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
real	i
great	c
session	c
in	c
our	c
valley	c
.	c

We	c
arrived	c
at	c
home	c
early	c
in	c
the	c
morning	c
-	c
it	c
was	c
great	c
.	c

There	c
were	c
two	c
other	c
problems	c
:	c
there	c
were	c
no	c
discounts	c
contrary	i
to	c
the	c
information	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
,	c
and	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
repairement	i
works	i
.	c

Please	c
contact	c
me	c
for	c
more	c
details	c
if	c
necessary	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

I	c
would	c
rather	c
type	c
some	c
coursework	i
up	c
than	c
hand-write	c
it	c
.	c

This	c
made	i
my	c
life	c
easier	c
,	c
and	c
at	c
the	c
same	c
time	c
saved	i
some	c
trees	c
in	c
a	c
rainforest	i
from	c
being	c
cut	c
.	i

When	c
I	c
am	c
too	c
tied	i
to	c
go	c
out	c
but	c
want	c
to	c
meet	c
some	c
new	c
people	c
,	c
computer	c
technology	c
provides	c
me	c
with	c
this	i
opportunity	c
.	c

This	c
leaves	c
me	c
wondering	c
how	c
beneficial	c
its	c
influence	c
is	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c

However	c
,	c
we	c
would	c
be	c
grateful	c
if	c
you	c
would	c
arrange	c
a	c
time	c
to	c
visit	c
the	c
show	c
additionally	i
.	c

In	i
this	c
show	c
,	c
not	c
only	c
can	c
we	c
see	c
latest	i
fashions	c
,	c
leisure	c
and	c
sports	c
wear	c
,	c
make	i
up	i
and	c
hairstyles	c
,	c
but	c
we	c
also	i
can	i
enter	c
for	c
free	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
think	i
how	c
media	i
effect	i
to	i
famous	c
people	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
after	c
chasing	i
for	c
long	i
time	c
,	c
she	c
was	c
dead	i
because	i
of	i
car	i
accident	c
.	c

Human	c
right	i
must	c
be	i
existed	i
for	c
all	c
people	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
many	c
people	c
love	c
to	c
watch	c
a	c
gossip	c
programme	c
on	c
TV	c
or	c
in	i
a	c
magazine	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
happy	c
to	c
know	c
I	c
won	c
the	c
prize	c
for	i
two	c
weeks	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
in	c
the	c
U.S.A	c
.	c

Refering	i
about	i
sports	c
I	i
would	c
choose	c
swimming	c
and	c
basketball	c
,	c
because	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
child	c
I	c
used	c
to	c
swim	c
a	c
lot	c
,	c
I	c
won	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
prizes	c
and	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
competitions	c
.	c

About	c
basketball	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
say	c
I	c
like	c
it	i
to	i
play	i
as	c
well	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
my	c
favourite	c
sport	c
in	c
highschool	c
,	i
I	c
was	c
not	c
as	c
good	c
as	i
in	i
swimming	c
but	c
I	c
like	c
it	c
.	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
I	c
would	c
say	c
that	c
even	c
when	i
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	i
enjoyable	c
we	c
have	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
because	c
we	c
do	c
not	c
have	c
another	c
option	c
.	c

Anyway	c
the	c
accommodation	c
is	c
not	c
a	c
big	c
problem	c
for	c
me	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
away	c
most	c
of	c
the	c
time	c
.	c

Stay	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
time	c
in	c
the	c
same	c
place	c
in	c
my	c
opinion	c
is	c
the	c
worse	i
thing	c
to	c
do	c
,	c
specialy	i
during	c
a	c
trip	i
!	c

Moreover	c
would	i
like	c
if	i
it	c
is	c
possible	c
to	c
have	c
an	c
opportunity	c
to	c
play	c
tennis	c
and	c
basketball	c
.	c

Before	c
ending	c
my	c
letter	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
and	i
be	i
told	i
specialy	i
in	i
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
should	i
I	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
with	c
me	c
and	c
also	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
change	c
some	c
money	c
of	c
mine	c
in	i
Dollars	i
.	c

I	c
wanted	c
to	c
go	c
very	i
much	i
there	i
and	c
so	c
go	i
there	c
for	i
helping	i
was	c
for	c
me	c
a	c
unique	c
chance	i
.	c

From	c
the	c
first	c
time	i
that	c
went	i
there	c
I	c
understood	c
that	c
I	c
was	c
going	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
great	c
night	c
.	c

But	c
as	i
the	c
correct	i
started	c
and	c
we	c
finished	c
what	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
,	c
we	c
were	c
free	c
to	c
do	c
what	i
ever	i
we	c
wanted	c
.	c

Best	c

DEAR	c
SIR	c

I	c
WENT	c
TO	c
YOUR	c
THEATRE	c
WITH	c
THE	c
IDEA	c
OF	c

A	c
GREAT	c
TIME	c
,	i
UNFORTUNETELY	i
,	c
THINGS	c
WERE	i
VERY	c
WRONG	c

THIS	c
WAS	c
VERY	c
DISAPPOINTING	c

IT	c
IS	c
ALSO	c
ADVERTISED	c
THAT	c
THERE	c
WERE	c
DISCOUNTS	c

Dear	c
Mr.	c
maneger	i
of	c
The	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
:	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
to	c
explain	i
some	c
problems	c
about	i
your	c
theatre	c
's	c
show	c
,	i
first	i
I	c
have	c
to	c
say	c
to	c
you	c
that	c
there	c
was	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
starring	i
the	i
act	i
.	c

I	c
had	c
been	c
waiting	c
for	c
more	c
than	c
half	c
an	c
hour	c
.	c

About	c
the	c
prize	i
,	c
the	c
paper	i
that	c
I	c
have	c
at	c
home	c
tells	i
that	c
there	c
were	c
discounts	c
availables	i
,	c
if	c
these	c
discounts	c
are	c
true	i
I	c
could	c
n't	c
use	c
them	c
.	c

The	c
reason	c
they	c
gave	c
us	c
,	i
was	c
that	c
they	c
had	c
n't	c
got	c
any	c
waiters	c
.	c

For	c
all	c
those	c
reasons	c
I	c
give	i
to	i
you	c
,	c
I	c
ask	c
for	c
the	c
money	c
I	c
had	i
payed	i
to	i
you	i
back	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
sorry	c
if	c
I	c
make	i
any	i
problem	i
to	i
you	i
,	c
but	c
I	c
'm	c
very	c
angry	c
and	c
it	c
was	c
your	c
fault	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
attention	c
,	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

Our	c
parents	c
took	c
us	c
there	c
because	c
they	c
wanted	c
that	i
we	i
became	i
good	c
and	i
polite	c
girls	c
.	c

But	c
in	c
a	c
few	c
days	c
she	c
told	c
the	c
secret	c
to	c
all	c
the	c
class	c
.	c

All	c
our	c
mates	c
wanted	c
to	c
enjoy	c
our	c
fantastic	c
and	i
secret	c
path	c
to	c
look	c
for	c
exams	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
this	c
letter	c
to	c
you	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
complain	c
for	i
the	c
musical	c
show	c
(	c
'	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
'	c
)	c
that	c
was	c
performed	c
at	c
your	c
theatre	c
last	c
week	c
;	c
concretely	i
on	c
Friday	c
evening	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
nothing	i
was	i
further	i
from	i
what	i
really	i
happened	i
.	c

Jaro	c
Santoquez	c

Electronic	c
devices	c
and	c
'	c
gadgets	c
'	c
make	c
our	c
daily	c
life	i
more	c
comfortable	c
and	c
easier	c
,	c
but	c
does	c
it	i
means	i
that	c
we	c
live	c
better	c
than	c
ever	c
?	c

Of	c
course	c
,	c
they	c
have	c
liberated	c
us	c
from	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
tough	c
routines	c
,	c
giving	c
us	c
the	c
chance	c
to	c
have	c
more	c
free-time	i
.	c

However	c
,	c
instead	c
of	c
enjoying	c
this	c
fantastic	c
opportunity	c
,	c
people	c
have	c
become	c
hooked	c
on	c
technological	c
advances	c
,	c
feeding	c
back	c
their	c
development	c
in	c
an	c
accelerating	c
,	c
non-stopping	i
race	c
.	c

Machines	c
do	i
now	i
most	c
of	c
hard	i
work	c
,	c
but	c
this	c
does	c
not	c
mean	c
that	c
we	c
are	c
working	c
less	c
.	c

This	c
is	c
a	c
big	c
opportunity	c
to	c
discover	c
the	c
capital	c
.	c

Could	c
you	c
,	c
if	c
we	c
may	c
ask	i
so	i
,	c
re-organise	i
our	c
visit	c
to	c
the	c
museum	c
and	c
also	c
to	c
the	c
shopping	c
center	i
.	c

This	c
is	c
a	c
very	c
important	c
stay	c
over	c
three	c
days	c
.	c

Every	c
one	c
hopes	c
to	c
enjoying	i
himself	c
and	c
comes	i
back	c
with	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
knowledge	c
.	c

I	c
thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
hearing	c
my	c
request	c
.	c

Every	i
one	i
deserves	c
to	c
be	c
given	c
the	c
right	c
of	i
a	c
private	c
life	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c

The	c
problem	c
is	c
that	c
most	c
part	i
of	c
the	c
advertistment	i
had	i
mistakes	i
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
there	c
were	c
not	i
discount	i
on	c
tickets	i
'	c
price	i
,	c
and	c
it	i
was	i
advertised	c
.	c

Despite	i
of	i
this	i
fact	c
,	c
that	i
I	c
did	c
not	c
care	c
about	c
it	i
at	c
the	i
beginning	i
,	c
when	c
the	c
play	c
started	c
I	c
did	c
not	c
see	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
who	c
is	c
my	c
favourite	c
actor	c
,	i
I	c
saw	c
another	c
actor	c
who	c
was	c
not	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
.	c

Nowadays	c
with	i
my	c
computer	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
travel	c
everywhere	i
in	c
the	c
world	c
,	c
just	c
with	i
it	c
connected	c
with	i
a	c
modem	c
.	c

I	c
like	c
competitive	c
and	c
changelling	i
sports	c
,	i
I	c
enjoy	c
myself	i
comparing	c
my	c
skill	c
with	c
other	c
players	c
and	c
,	c
if	c
possible	c
,	c
I	i
rather	i
practising	i
sports-activities	i
not	i
indoor	i
,	c
but	c
open	c
air	c
.	i

Let	c
me	c
know	c
this	c
information	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Also	i
the	i
dancing	i
lessons	i
should	i
be	c
filmed	c
,	c
specially	i
for	i
the	c
fascinating	c
beauty	c
of	c
the	c
girls	c
and	c
the	c
elegance	c
of	c
their	c
moviments	i
.	c

The	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c

We	c
were	c
interested	c
on	i
see	i
the	c
actors	c
that	c
appeard	i
on	c
the	c
tickets	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
disappointed	c
when	c
,	c
in	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
we	c
saw	c
another	i
actors	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
comprehension	i

It	c
was	c
saturday	i
night	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
,	i
with	c
my	c
sister	c
Pat	c
alone	c
in	c
my	c
home	c
.	c

That	c
night	c
I	c
was	c
invited	c
to	c
a	c
great	c
party	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
was	i
punished	i
,	c
and	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
stayed	i
at	c
home	c
with	c
my	c
sister	c
.	c

At	i
sunday	i
night	c
,	c
when	c
my	c
parents	c
arrived	c
,	c
they	c
asked	c
her	c
if	c
I	c
had	c
stayed	c
at	c
home	c
on	c
saturday	i
,	i
my	i
sister	c
beheave	i
silence	i
for	c
a	c
minute	c
and	c
then	c
started	c
laughing	c
;	c
so	c
my	c
parents	c
,	c
with	c
her	c
laugh	c
,	c
know	i
that	c
I	c
had	c
go	i
out	c
that	c
Saturday	c
;	c
and	c
punished	c
me	c
for	c
a	c
year	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
congratulate	c
you	c
on	c
your	c
wonderful	c
"	c
Arts	c
Festival	c
"	c
.	c

From	c
my	c
point	c
of	c
view	c
,	c
it	c
will	c
better	c
if	c
you	c
have	c
some	c
"	c
Stars	c
and	c
Artists	c
"	c
from	c
only	c
six	c
countries	c
.	c

I	c
also	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
talk	c
about	c
your	c
concerts	c
.	c

Concerning	c
the	c
tickets	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
your	c
price	c
is	c
reasonable	c
for	c
this	c
festival	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	i
,	c

I	c
'm	c
really	c
happy	c
to	c
receive	c
your	c

I	c
hope	c

At	c
home	c
,	c
I	c
'm	c
not	c
allowed	c
to	c
watch	c
television	c
after	c
8	c
p.m.	c
I	c
must	c
do	c
my	c
home	i
work	i
when	c
I	c
come	c
back	c
at	i
home	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
;	i
to	i
clean	i
my	c
room	c
and	c
the	c
other	c
rooms	c
,	c
or	c
to	i

etc	c
....	c

I	c
Hope	i
these	i
information	c
will	c
help	c
you	c
,	c

Love	c
.	i

First	c
of	c
all	c
I	i
want	c
you	c
to	c
know	c
I	c
am	c
really	c
happy	c
about	c
the	c
prize	c
.	c

Refering	i
to	i
accommodation	c
I	c
would	c
rather	c
to	i
stay	i
in	c
tents	i
because	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
gone	i
on	i
camping	c
so	i
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
have	i
the	i
experience	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
not	c
really	c
keen	c
on	c
art	i
that	i
is	c
why	c
I	c
prefer	i
doing	c
some	c
sports	c
like	c
surfing	c
and	c
sailing	c
.	c

If	c
I	c
have	i
to	c
be	c
honest	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
say	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
practised	i
none	i
of	c
them	c
.	c

Yet	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
try	c
them	c
because	c
my	c
city	c
is	c
too	i
far	c
from	c
the	c
sea	c
so	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
many	c
opportunities	c
of	c
doing	c
them	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
fordward	i
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Dear	c
Miss	c
Helen	c

I	c
'm	c
a	c
good	c
tennis	c
player	c
and	c
a	c
big	c
surfer	c
too	c
.	c

Lastly	c
,	c
I	c
'm	c
interested	c
about	i
the	c
law	i

,	i
they	i
are	c
very	c
famous	c
here	c

Yours	c

This	c
is	c
a	c
precise	i
letter	c
that	c
I	c
write	c
you	i
now	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
very	c
happy	c
and	c
lazy	c
at	c
the	c
same	c
time	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
embaracing	i
during	c
the	c
concert	c
,	c
but	c
all	c
the	c
staff	c
were	c
very	c
kindly	i
with	i
me	c
and	c
Tom	c
too	c
.	c

This	c
is	i
the	c
most	c
important	c
experience	c
in	c
my	c
life	c
,	c
I	c
knew	c
all	c
the	c
people	c
,	c
in	c
a	i
particular	c
the	c
famous	c
singer	c
"	c
Kos	c
"	c
.	c

Excuse	c
me	c
Kim	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
'm	c
so	c
nervous	c
that	c
I	c
ob	i
n't	i
be	c
able	c
to	c
write	c
oben	i
this	c
letter	c
yet	i
.	c

I	c
hope	c
to	c
hearing	i
you	i
soon	c

I	c
must	c
tell	c
you	c
that	c
this	c
show	c
was	c
the	c
worst	c
one	c
I	c
had	c
ever	c
been	c
to	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
all	c
the	c
more	c
angry	c
as	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
instead	c
of	c
19:30	c
as	i
it	i
was	c
written	c
in	c
your	c
ad	c
!	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

Thus	c
when	c
Sally	c
explained	c
her	i
that	c
she	c
had	c
fallen	c
in	c
love	c
with	c
Kevin	c
,	c
Pat	c
felt	c
very	c
embarassed	i
.	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
excited	c
with	i
the	c
idea	c
of	c
going	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
did	c
n't	c
work	c
out	c
as	c
I	c
thought	c
it	c
will	i
.	c

To	c
finish	c
my	c
"	c
marvelous	i
"	c
evening	c
,	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
eat	c
at	c
your	c
restaurant	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
and	c
no	c
reason	c
was	c
given	c
.	c

As	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
have	c
a	c
"	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
"	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
I	c
have	c
the	c
right	c
to	c
ask	c
for	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

That	c
afternoon	c
she	c
visited	c
me	c
and	c
told	c
me	c
a	c
plan	c
she	c
had	c
designed	c
to	c
make	c
my	c
marks	c
rise	c

'll	c
need	c

two	c

I	c

I	c

that	c

an	c
awful	c
time	c

so	c
I	c

Yesterday	c

with	i
her	c
.	c

Pat	c
is	c
not	c
a	c
reliable	c
person	c
so	i
he	c
is	c
not	c
my	c
best	c
friend	c
anymore	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writting	i
in	c
order	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
which	i
name	i
is	i
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
that	i
I	c
could	i
see	i
in	c
your	c
theatre	c
recently	c
.	c

I	c
like	c
very	i
much	i
this	i
musical	i
and	c
while	c
I	c
was	c
spending	c
some	c
days	c
in	c
London	c
I	c
could	i
see	i
you	i
advertisement	c
so	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
see	c
it	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
I	i
had	c
problems	c
with	c
tickets	c
because	c
I	c
could	c
not	c
get	c
the	c
discounts	c
that	c
you	c
mentioned	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
.	c

Then	c
I	c
got	c
nervous	i
and	c
I	c
thought	c
that	c
the	c
organization	c
was	c
very	c
bad	c
because	c
nobody	c
explained	c
us	i
the	c
reasons	c
.	i

In	c
your	c
advertisement	c
his	c
name	c
was	c
in	c
main	i
letters	c
and	c
in	c
the	c
musical	c
the	i
actor	i
was	i
different	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
indignatged	i
because	c
I	c
wasted	c
my	c
time	c
and	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
horrible	c
evening	c
so	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
you	c
return	i
my	c
money	c
and	c
take	c
notes	i
of	c
all	c
these	c
problems	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

Nowadays	c
,	c
technology	c
is	c
changing	c
our	c
life	c
every	c
day	c
.	c

Not	c
only	c
are	c
the	i
computers	c
useful	c
for	c
keep	i
information	c
but	c
also	c
computers	c
can	c
give	c
you	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
information	c
due	i
to	c
Internet	i
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
I	c
realized	i
that	c
modern	c
technology	c
not	i
is	i
as	c
good	c
as	c
people	c
think	c
:	c
I	c
hate	c
mobiles	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c
After	c
I	c
had	c
read	c
your	c
advertisement	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
"	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
"	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
watching	c
your	c
musical	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
"	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
did	c
not	c
start	c
on	c
time	c
but	c
fourty-five	i
minutes	c
later	i
.	c

This	c
actor	c
was	c
not	c
almost	i
as	c
brilliant	c
as	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
not	c
have	c
paied	i
so	c
many	i
money	c
if	c
I	c
had	c
known	c
this	c
before	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
Gabe	c
Grumman	c
(	c
Mrs	c
)	c

Well	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
not	c
agree	c
that	c
this	c
statement	c
is	c
always	c
true	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
is	c
true	c
in	c
the	c
case	c
of	c
the	c
book	c
"	c
The	c
Old	c
Man	c
and	c
the	c
Sea	c
"	c
by	c
Ernest	c
Hemingway	c
.	c

The	c
context	c
of	c
the	c
book	c
is	c
easy	c
to	c
understand	c
and	c
not	c
very	c
spectacular	c
:	c
an	c
old	c
fisherman	c
is	c
alone	c
on	c
the	c
vast	c
sea	c
,	c
fighting	c
with	c
a	c
strong	c
fish	c
he	c
had	i
caught	c
.	c

It	c
becomes	c
a	c
fight	i
about	i
life	i
or	i
death	i
.	c

He	c
is	c
old	c
and	c
he	c
wants	c
to	c
win	c
this	c
last	c
competition	c
between	c
him	c
and	c
the	i
nature	c
.	c

So	c
he	c
bares	i
everything	c
:	c
the	c
days	c
and	c
nights	c
on	c
the	c
sea	c
,	c
without	c
any	c
food	c
or	c
water	c
,	c
the	c
terrible	c
summer	c
sun	c
,	c
the	i
being	c
injured	c
from	c
keeping	c
to	i
the	c
line	c
where	i
the	c
fish	c
is	c
on	i
.	c

Although	c
this	c
situation	c
might	c
not	c
very	i
difficult	c
or	c
important	c
for	c
anybody	c
else	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
for	c
this	c
old	c
man	c
and	c
I	c
found	c
it	c
very	c
exciting	c
to	c
follow	c
this	c
story	c
until	c
it	i
's	i
quiet	c
,	c
sad	c
end	c
.	c

The	c
surprise	c
was	c
that	c
the	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

They	c
believe	c
that	c
people	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
will	c
wear	c
confortable	i
clothes	c
because	c
they	c
will	c
be	c
outgoing	c
,	c
amused	i
,	c
etc	c
.	c

At	i
the	c
end	c
all	i
people	i
will	c
be	c
short-sight	i
.	c

It	c
is	c
a	c
point	i
very	i
interesting	i
.	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
,	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
more	c
fun	c
sleeping	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
than	c
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
.	c

For	c
the	i
activities	c
I	c
think	c
I	c
will	c
choose	c
swimming	c
because	c
I	c
love	c
swimming	c
and	c
being	c
in	c
the	c
water	c
.	c

Best	c
Regards	i
,	c

Helen	c

Well	c
this	c
is	c
abosolutly	i
true	c
,	c
espacially	i
when	c
you	c
go	c
shopping	c
on	c
Saturday	c
.	c

For	c
exemple	i
you	i
go	c
into	c
a	c
cloth	i
shop	c
,	c
you	c
see	c
all	c
those	c
women	c
running	c
around	c
trying	c
to	c
find	c
the	c
shirt	c
that	c
would	i
fit	i
their	c
new	c
skirt	c
,	c
so	c
they	c
are	c
looking	c
every	i
where	i
,	c
pushing	c
you	c
because	c
they	c
think	c
that	c
you	c
will	c
take	c
the	c
shirt	c
that	c
they	c
want	c
.	c

And	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
wait	c
after	c
to	i
buy	c
it	c
,	c
so	c
finally	c
you	c
waited	i
so	c
long	c
that	c
you	c
are	i
getting	i
late	c
,	c
so	c
you	c
get	c
stressed	c
to	i
.	c

So	c
it	c
's	c
really	c
not	c
enjoyable	c
to	c
go	c
shopping	c
.	c

You	c
get	c
headaches	c
,	c
you	c
get	c
stressed	c
,	c
and	c
finally	c
you	c
get	c
bruses	i
because	c
of	c
the	c
woman	c
that	i
pushed	c
you	c
to	c
get	c
the	c
pretty	c
skirt	c
before	c
you	c
!	c
!	c
!	c

Dear	c
Ms.	c
Ryan	c

I	c
recived	i
your	c
letter	c
recently	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
really	c
happy	c
learning	i
that	c
I	c
won	i
the	c
first	c
prize	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
that	c
my	c
only	c
chance	c
is	i
go	i
there	i
in	c
July	c
,	i
it	i
does	i
not	i
matter	i
the	i
dates	i
,	c
but	c
it	c
is	c
important	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
be	c
back	c
before	c
the	c
1st	c
of	c
August	c
,	c
because	c
that	c
day	c
I	c
will	c
start	c
a	c
summer	c
job	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
a	i
induction	c
climbing	c
course	c
two	c
years	c
ago	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
still	c
going	i
to	i
climbing	i
regulary	i
,	i
I	c
can	c
do	c
a	c
V+	c
level	c
climb	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
I	c
had	i
a	c
photography	c
course	c
five	c
years	c
ago	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
took	c
part	c
in	c
several	c
competitions	c

Yours	c

Shopping	c
,	c
what	c
an	c
exciting	c
thing	c
!	c

Going	c
out	c
to	c
spend	c
a	c
day	c
shopping	c
is	c
something	c
very	c
popular	c
,	i
the	i
shopping	c
centers	i
are	c
always	c
busy	c
,	c
people	i
going	c
up	c
and	c
down	c
carrying	c
bags	c
and	c
looking	c
at	i
window	i
shops	i
,	i
seems	i
everbody	i
is	c
happy	c
.	c

Firstly	c
is	i
the	c
parking	c
problem	c
,	i
if	i
you	c
go	c
to	i
shopping	c
late	c
at	c
weekends	c
for	c
instance	c
,	c
it	c
's	c
really	c
difficult	c
to	c
find	c
a	c
place	c
to	c
park	c
your	c
car	c
,	c
and	c
when	c
you	c
get	c
the	i
place	c
,	c
pay	i
for	c
it	c
!	c

Finally	c
you	c
've	c
found	c
out	i
something	c
really	c
wonderful	c
,	i
time	c
to	c
pay	c
!	c

No	c
choice	c
,	i
you	c
have	c
to	c
leave	c
your	c
nice	c
clothes	c
and	c
go	c
away	c
feeling	c
bad	c
and	c
sad	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
log	i
cabin	c
because	c
it	c
must	c
be	c
cold	c
to	i
stay	i
in	c
a	c
tent	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
really	c
good	c
at	c
Golf	c
and	c
Tennis	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
choose	c
these	c
two	c
activities	c
.	c

I	c
've	c
been	c
playing	c
Golf	c
for	c
five	c
years	c
,	c
and	c
I	i
'm	i
a	c
handidate	i
cup	i
of	c
sixteen	c
,	c
but	c
the	c
problem	c
is	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
n't	c
been	c
playing	c
Golf	c
for	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
because	c
I	c
work	c
every	c
day	c
.	c

S	c

I	c

them	c
that	c
you	c
're	c
really	c
good	c
at	i

so	c
they	c

I	c
'll	c

you	i
soon	c
Kim	c
.	c

Tell	i
hello	c
to	c
your	c
parents	c
!	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
,	i
at	i
present	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
doing	c
an	c
art	c
course	c
at	c
college	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
wo	c
n't	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
holiday	c
until	c
then	c
.	c

Lastly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
learn	c
that	i
what	c
kinds	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
bring	c
with	c
me	c
and	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
(	c
American	c
currency	c
-	c
dollars	c
)	c
I	c
'll	c
need	c
to	c
have	c
while	c
I	c
'm	c
there	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

I	c
even	c
go	i
a	c
bunch	c
of	c
flowers	c
from	c
them	c
with	c
a	c
"	c
thank	c
you	c
"	c
letter	c
.	c

What	c
I	c
realised	c
was	c
they	c
were	c
not	c
different	c
from	c
any	c
of	c
us	c
but	c
they	c
were	c
called	c
celebreties	i
.	c

I	c
particularly	c
liked	c
listening	c
their	i
musicians	c
when	c
they	c
played	c
the	c
piano	c
,	c
clarinet	c
,	c
drums	c
,	c
violen	i
etc.	i
Which	i
was	c
unbelievably	i
great	c
and	i
also	c
to	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
meet	c
these	c
famous	c
singers	c
made	c
me	c
realise	c
we	c
can	c
achieve	c
whatever	c
we	c
want	c
.	c

I	c
write	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
show	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
I	c
saw	c
last	c
night	c
.	c

Besides	c
this	c
,	c
no	c
discounts	c
for	c
students	c
were	c
available	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
to	c
this	c
,	c
I	c
heard	i
bad	c
singers	c
and	c
noticed	c
a	c
numertable	i
lack	c
of	c
variety	c
in	c
ballets	i
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

This	c
should	c
be	i
a	c
big	c
surprise	c
for	c
him	c
:	c
the	c
car	c
was	c
bought	c
and	c
everything	c
was	c
prepared	c
in	c
a	c
very	c
hush-hush	c
atmosphere	c
.	c

Pat	c
promised	c
not	c
to	c
speak	c
to	c
anyone	c
about	c
the	c
car	c
,	c
but	c
one	c
evening	c
Philip	c
overhead	c
her	c
speaking	c
about	c
this	c
with	c
her	c
boyfriend	c
"	i
It	c
will	c
be	c
delievered	i
on	c
Thursday	c
!	c

Can	c
you	c
imagine	c
Philip	c
's	c
face	c
when	c
he	i
'll	i
see	i
his	c
favourite	c
car	c
out	c
there	c
?	c
"	c

The	c
car	c
was	c
already	c
parked	c
near	c
the	c
rear	c
door	c
and	c
there	c
was	c
an	c
unusual	c
activity	i
all	c
over	c
the	c
house	c
.	c

Everyone	c
seemed	c
to	c
be	c
looking	c
for	c
something	c
.	c

And	c
disappeared	i
heading	i
for	c
the	c
rear	c
door	c
.	c

I	c
've	c
been	c
thrilled	c
eversince	i
I	c
received	c
your	c

Hi	c
Kim	c
.	c

I	c
thin	i
it	c
's	c
a	c
wonderful	c
idea	c
and	c
my	c
advice	c
is	c
to	c
take	c
it	c
if	c
you	c
have	c
an	c
offer	c
!	c

I	c
had	c
so	c
much	c
fun	c
helping	c
my	c
friends	c
'	c
band	c
having	i
their	c
concert	c
.	c

At	c
first	c
,	c
they	c
asked	c
me	c
to	c
decorate	c
the	c
stage	c
since	c
I	c
like	c
drawing	c
,	c
but	c
as	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
get	c
more	c
involved	c
,	c
they	c
said	c
that	c
I	c
could	c
also	c
help	c
them	c
set	c
up	c
the	c
lights	c
,	c
the	c
microphones	c
and	c
the	c
instruments	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
have	c
any	c
questions	c
,	c
please	c
write	c
to	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
wish	c
you	c
the	c
best	c
of	c
luck	c
and	c
hope	c
you	c
have	c
fun	c
helping	c
the	c
singers	c
as	c
much	c
as	c
I	c
did	c

None	c
of	c
conditions	i
was	i
fulfilled	c
:	c
firstly	c
,	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
who	c
was	c
going	c
to	c
perform	c
in	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
was	c
changed	c
by	i
another	c
actor	c
.	c

On	i
the	i
other	i
hand	i
,	c
it	i
there	c
was	i
n't	i
any	c
discounts	c
in	i
the	c
sell	i
of	c
the	c
tickets	c
.	c

To	c
make	c
matters	c
worse	c
,	c
when	c
the	c
show	c
finished	c
we	c
could	c
n't	c
visit	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
fact	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
(	c
since	c
it	c
was	c
being	c
painted	c
)	c
.	c

What	c
will	c
clothes	c
be	c
like	c
100	c
years	c
from	c
now	c
?	c

I	c
imagine	c
it	i
will	c
be	c
very	c
different	c
.	c

Sciencist	i
will	c
invented	i
new	c
materials	c
that	c
will	c
keep	c
the	c
temperature	i
in	c
a	c
suitable	c
range	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
these	c
new	c
material	i
wo	i
n't	i
weight	i
hardly	c
anything	c
.	c

Of	c
course	c
,	c
the	c
resources	c
used	c
and	c
manufacturing	i
will	i
be	c
completely	c
harmless	c
for	c
the	c
enviroment	i
because	c
people	c
will	c
be	c
more	c
aware	c
of	c
the	c
neccesity	i
of	c
taking	c
care	c
of	c
the	c
world	c
we	c
live	c
in	c
.	c

I	c
write	c
this	c
letter	c
because	c
I	c
find	i
there	c
were	c
too	c
many	c
problems	c
concerning	c
your	c
musical	c
show	c
:	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
"	c
.	c

At	i
first	i
,	c
I	c
expected	c
to	c
find	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
as	c
the	c
main	c
actor	c
,	c
but	c
she	c
must	c
have	c
been	c
changed	i
since	c
the	c
actor	c
was	c
different	c
.	c

Nevertheless	c
,	c
I	c
stayed	c
since	c
I	c
had	c
paid	c
.	c

We	c
can	i
see	c
on	c
the	c
advertisement	c
that	c
discounts	c
are	c
available	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
modern	c
technology	c
change	i
my	c
daily	c
life	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
if	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
buy	c
something	c
,	c
I	c
have	i
to	i
go	i
on	c
my	c
computer	c
and	c
buy	c
it	c
.	c

But	c
on	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
technology	c
's	c
products	c
are	c
sometimes	c
cheap	i
and	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
afford	c
it	i
.	c

In	c
fact	c
,	c
I	c
like	c
technology	c
but	c
sometimes	c
I	c
wish	c
it	c
had	i
n't	i
existed	c
since	c
there	c
are	c
too	c
many	c
things	c
on	c
market	i
.	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
very	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
so	c
I	c
ask	c
for	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

The	c
first	c
problem	c
we	c
had	c
was	c
that	c
the	c
discounts	c
announced	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
were	c
not	c
available	c
and	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
pay	c
the	c
full	c
ticket	i
.	c

Another	c
problem	c
was	c
that	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
45	c
minutes	c
late	c
and	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
surprise	c
when	c
I	c
saw	c
that	c
the	c
main	c
character	c
was	c
not	c
played	c
by	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
who	c
is	c
one	c
of	c
my	c
favourite	c
actors	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerelly	i

Another	c
important	c
thing	c
will	c
be	c
the	c
use	c
of	c
technology	c
.	c

Scientists	c
are	c
looking	c
for	c
new	c
materials	c
that	c
will	c
made	i
our	c
clothes	c
more	c
comfortable	c
stronger	i
.	c

Fashion	c
reflects	c
the	c
way	c
we	c
live	c
so	c
we	c
can	c
expect	c
that	c
fashion	c
will	c
be	c
connected	c
with	i
technology	c
and	c
society	c
.	c

With	c
regard	c
to	c
your	c
International	c
Arts	c
Festival	c
advertisment	i
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
share	c
with	c
you	c
the	c
pleasure	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
be	c
part	c
of	c
the	c
event	c
and	c
some	i
suggestions	c
for	c
next	c
year	c
's	c
festival	c
that	c
you	c
might	c
take	c
in	i
consideration	c
.	c

In	c
your	c
advertisment	i
you	c
mentionned	i
that	c
there	c
is	i
artists	c
and	c
stars	c
from	i
all	i
around	i
the	i
world	i
coming	i
,	c
unfortunately	c
I	c
found	c
out	c
only	c
six	c
countries	c
were	c
represented	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
a	c
very	c
good	c
opportunity	c
to	c
listen	c
to	c
different	c
kind	i
of	c
music	c
and	c
to	c
discover	c
different	c
culture	i
.	c

It	c
's	c
a	c
story	c
of	c
a	c
special	c
person	c
who	c
was	c
born	c
in	c
my	c
country	c
and	c
who	c
is	c
now	c
known	c
worldwide	c
.	c

Only	c
the	c
one	i
who	c
knew	c
how	c
to	c
read	c
stars	c
could	c
actually	c
tell	c
that	c
a	c
great	c
king	c
was	i
born	c
.	c

This	c
little	c
man	c
from	c
Israel	c
died	c
as	c
the	c
hero	i
of	c
all	c
times	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
musical	c
'	c
OVER	c
THE	c
RAINBOW	c
'	c
.	c

There	c
were	c
some	c
unfortunate	c
incidents	c
.	c

To	c
begin	c
with	c
,	c
according	c
to	c
your	c
advertisement	c
,	c
discount	c
tickets	c
were	i
availabe	i
.	c

To	c
make	c
matters	c
worse	c
,	c
it	i
was	i
the	i
different	i
actor	i
although	i
Danny	i
Brook	i
should	i
have	i
starred	i
.	c

Can	c
you	c
imagine	c
how	c
upset	c
I	c
was	c
?	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
receiving	c
your	i
satisfactory	c
reply	c
by	c
return	c
of	c
post	c
.	c

To	c
begin	c
with	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
the	c
mobile	c
phone	c
is	c
very	c
useful	c
because	c
I	c
can	c
make	c
a	c
phone	c
call	c
wherever	c
I	c
am	c
,	c
without	c
looking	c
for	c
a	c
telephone	c
box	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
as	c
far	c
as	c
I	c
am	c
concerned	c
,	c
the	c
computer	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
invention	c
.	c

That	c
's	c
nearly	c
an	c
hour	c
later	i
!	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets.	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
found	c
out	c
afterwards	c
and	c
it	c
was	c
too	c
late	c
.	c

Pat	c
was	c
my	c
friend	c
,	c
I	c
trusted	c
her	c
and	c
we	c
got	c
on	c
very	c
well	c
untill	i
she	c
had	i
repeated	i
to	c
everyone	c
the	c
secret	c
I	c
had	c
told	c
her	c
.	c

Since	c
everyone	c
knew	c
the	c
truth	c
,	c
things	c
were	c
n't	c
the	c
same	c
.	c

Everyone	c
,	c
even	c
my	c
friends	c
,	c
looked	c
at	c
me	c
in	c
a	c
strange	c
kind	c
of	c
way	c
.	c

I	c
knew	i
,	c
now	c
,	c
why	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
hide	c
the	c
truth	c
.	c

Dear	c
Madam	c

As	i
accomodation	i
I	c
'd	c
prefer	c
to	c
sleep	c
in	c
tents	i
becaose	i
I	c
like	c
beeing	i
outside	c
and	c
earing	i
the	c
noises	c
of	c
the	c
sea	c
.	c

My	c
two	c
activities	i
's	i
choices	i
are	c
Climbing	i
and	i
Surfing	i
.	c

I	c
used	c
to	c
climb	c
and	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
try	c
still	i
because	c
climbing	c
is	c
good	i
for	i
the	i
fit	c
.	c

I	c
purpose	i
that	c
we	c
should	c
be	i
filmed	i
five	c
topics	i
:	c

-	c
At	i
the	c
math	i
lesson	c
and	c
the	c
English	c
lesson	c
we	c
could	c
show	c
how	c
the	c
teacher	c
learn	i
at	i
his	c
students	c
.	c

-	c
During	i
the	i
break	i
we	i
could	i
show	i
the	i
activities	i
of	i
the	i
students	i
.	c

for	i
exemple	i
students	i
who	c
play	c
football	c
or	c
volleyball	c
.	c

We	c
could	c
known	i
how	i
this	i
room	i
is	i
and	c
what	c
the	c
Teachers	i
do	c
in	c
this	c
misterious	i
room	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
really	c
pleased	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
at	i
Camp	c
California	c
in	c
U.S.A	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
this	c
year	c
because	c
I	c
think	c
the	c
weather	c
will	c
be	c
nice	c
and	c
I	c
can	c
take	c
a	c
holiday	c
.	c

I	c
can	c
be	c
more	i
next	i
nuture	i
and	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
used	c
tents	c
before	c
.	c

It	c
seems	c
to	c
be	c
exciting	c
.	c

I	c
choose	c
swimming	c
and	c
painting	c
for	c
my	c
activities	c
while	c
I	c
am	c
at	c
the	c
Camp	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
child	c
,	c
I	c
used	c
to	c
go	c
swimming	c
with	c
my	c
family	c
at	c
the	c
weekend	c
having	i
a	c
chat	c
,	c
making	c
a	c
barbecue	c
,	c
playing	c
games	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
was	c
in	c
high	c
school	c
,	c
I	c
won	c
second	c
prize	c
in	c
a	c
painting	c
competition	c
.	c

My	c
parents	c
were	c
very	c
pround	i
of	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
taking	c
the	c
final	c
exam	c
next	c
month	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
know	c
,	c
I	c
'm	c
crazy	c
about	c
pop	c
music	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
n't	c
sleep	c
well	c
and	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
know	c
what	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
in	i
the	c
concert	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
such	c
a	c
big	c
concert	c
.	c

Of	c
course	c
,	c
there	c
were	c
lots	c
of	c
spectaculars	i
.	c

First	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
in	c
front	c
of	c
the	c
entrance	c
door	c
.	c

My	c
hands	c
were	c
sclumbling	i
but	c
I	c
did	c
it	c
very	c
well	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
sorry	c
that	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
ask	c
them	i
to	i
take	i
any	i
pictures	i
for	c
you	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
really	c
busy	c
.	c

I	c
knew	i
lots	c
of	c
people	c
from	i
different	c
job	i
.	c

Take	c
care	c
of	c
yourself	c
and	c
I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Best	c
wishes	c
,	c

According	c
to	c
your	c
advertisment	i
I	c
could	c
have	c
one	c
but	c
in	c
reality	c
there	c
were	c
no	c
discounts	c
at	c
all	c
.	c

But	c
nevertheless	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
your	c
show	c
.	c

One	c
of	c
the	c
reasons	c
for	c
my	c
visiting	c
your	c
show	c
was	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
's	c
participance	i
.	c

To	c
make	c
matters	c
worse	c
the	i
restaurant	c
which	c
was	c
mentioned	c
in	c
your	c
advertisment	i
was	c
closed	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

Both	c
computer	i
and	c
Internet	i
influence	c
people	c
's	c
life	i
.	c

Dear	c
Jane	c
Clark	c

My	c
name	c
is	c
Yuna	c
Kimber	c
who	c
attended	c
this	c
annual	c
International	c
Arts	c
Festival	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
appreicate	i
you	c
for	c
organizing	c
such	c
an	c
exciting	c
festival	c
.	c

And	c
another	c
thing	c
is	c
that	c
some	c
concert	c
halls	c
were	c
too	c
small	c
,	c
so	c
when	c
I	c
went	c
there	c
for	c
Jazz	c
and	c
rock	c
concerts	c
it	c
was	c
so	c
crowded	c
,	c
and	c
during	c
the	c
concerts	c
people	c
felt	c
stuffy	i
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
mention	c
reasonably-priced	i
weekend	c
ticket	c
.	c

Faithfully	c
yours	c

Long	i
time	c
ago	c
,	c
there	c
were	c
two	c
brothers	c
,	c
whose	c
parents	c
were	c
dead	c
.	c

Hungbu	c
had	c
nothing	c
but	c
his	c
twelve	i
family	i
.	c

But	c
,	c
even	c
if	c
he	c
was	c
so	i
poor	c
,	c
he	c
was	c
so	i
good	c
and	c
had	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
affection	c
about	i
the	c
people	c
who	c
were	c
much	c
poorer	c
than	c
his	c
family	c
,	c
so	c
he	c
looked	c
after	c
them	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
kind	c
of	c
map	c
that	c
showed	c
the	c
place	i
for	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
money	c
which	c
robbers	c
hid	c
.	c

People	c
belive	i
that	c
the	c
bird	c
was	c
sent	c
by	i
heaven	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
sorry	c
but	c
I	c
must	c
admit	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
bit	c
disappointing	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
n't	c
see	c
anyone	c
inside	c
either	c
.	c

No	c
one	c
.	c

And	c
the	c
tickets	c
were	c
pretty	c
expensive	c
...	c

He	c
said	c
it	c
was	c
because	c
the	c
runner	i
of	c
the	c
restaurant	c
had	c
gone	c
out	c
to	c
arrange	c
the	c
food	c
supply	c
for	c
the	c
next	c
day	c
.	c

So	c
you	c
see	c
my	c
point	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
pleasant	c
.	c

But	c
maybe	c
not	c
.	c

Like	c
shiny	c
and	c
plastic	c
kind	i
.	c

All	c
suitable	c
for	c
discos	c
!	c

Shoes	c
will	c
be	c
high	c
heeled	c
and	c
modern	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
I	i
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
the	i
perfect	i
organisation	i
of	i
the	c
competition	c
which	c
I	c
luckely	i
won	c
,	i
I	c
have	c
been	c
really	c
very	c
impressed	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
I	c
became	i
your	c
letter	c
with	i
two	c
weeks	c
late	c
so	c
I	c
can	c
travel	c
only	c
between	c
the	c
5th	c
and	c
the	c
20th	c
July	c
.	c

In	c
fact	c
I	c
will	c
finish	c
my	c
university	i
's	i
exams	c
only	c
on	c
the	c
first	c
July	i
and	c
after	c
the	c
20th	c
is	i
impossible	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
going	c
to	c
do	c
four	c
weeks	i
volontary	i
in	i
India	c
for	c
UNICEF	c
.	c

If	c
it	c
is	c
possible	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
log	i
cabins	i
,	c
because	c
,	c
in	c
spite	c
of	c
my	c
love	c
for	c
nature	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
terribly	c
allergic	c
to	c
pollins	i
.	c

So	c
stay	i
in	c
a	c
log	i
cabins	i
will	c
probably	c
evite	i
me	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
problems	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
your	c
attencion	i
on	i
my	i
regard	i

Your	i
sincerely	c

Why	c
so	i
many	i
people	i
have	i
been	i
contaged	i
by	c
this	c
"	c
psychologic	i
virus	c
"	c
?	c

Maybe	c
you	c
can	i
think	c
I	c
am	c
excessive	i
but	c
recent	c
studies	c
prouves	i
that	c
this	c
mania	c
can	c
be	c
really	c
dangerous	c
.	c

In	c
fact	c
if	c
you	c
have	c
the	c
new	c
Kalvin	c
Klein	c
model	i
for	i
a	c
certain	c
kind	c
of	c
people	i
you	c
are	c
cool	c
,	c
but	c
it	i
is	i
really	c
so	c
important	c
?	c

Probably	c
when	c
Oscar	c
Wilde	c
said	c
:	c
"	c
Superficiality	c
is	c
the	c
suprem	i
vice	c
"	c
he	c
was	c
right	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr.	c
Smith	c
;	i

Not	c
only	c
me	c
but	c
also	c
the	c
others	c
got	c
bored	c
.	c

But	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
Danny	c
Brock	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
.	c

If	c
there	c
had	c
been	c
a	c
problem	c
,	c
it	i
would	i
have	i
been	i
told	i
us	i
.	c

I	c
wanted	c
to	c
see	c
him	c
but	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
see	c
.	i

But	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
without	c
any	c
reason	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
very	c
rude	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
would	i
not	i
continue	i
like	c
this	c
.	c

But	c
if	c
they	c
were	c
n't	c
made	c
,	c
we	c
would	c
have	c
to	c
walk	c
or	c
go	c
by	c
a	i
horse	c
or	c
donkey	c
.	c

Not	c
only	c
as	c
a	c
hobby	c
.	c

They	c
use	c
computers	c
for	c
their	c
works	i
.	c

But	c
in	c
the	c
past	c
people	c
had	c
to	c
use	c
lots	c
of	c
note	i
books	i
and	c
they	c
also	c
had	c
to	c
find	c
places	c
to	c
hide	c
them	c
.	c

But	c
it	c
has	i
also	i
bad	c
points	c
.	c

You	c
cannot	c
imagine	c
our	c
disappointment	c
when	c
we	c
realised	c
that	c
the	c
show	c
had	c
been	c
posticipated	i
at	i
20.15	c
instead	c
of	c
19.30	c
and	c
that	c
the	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
of	c
restructuring	i
;	c
as	c
a	c
matter	c
of	c
fact	c
,	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
we	c
only	c
ate	c
an	i
hamburger	c
in	c
a	c
fast-food	c
.	i

Yours	c
Faithfully	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
actually	c
say	c
that	c
if	c
it	c
had	c
n't	c
been	c
for	c
Mr.	c
White	c
she	c
would	c
have	i
never	i
passed	c
her	c
exam	c
to	c
enter	c
University	c
.	c

Mr	c
White	c
came	c
to	c
our	c
school	c
when	c
he	c
was	c
40	c
year-old	i
but	c
still	c
well-looking	i
and	c
all	c
my	c
girls	i
school-mates	c
fell	c
suddenly	c
in	c
love	c
with	c
him	c
;	c
he	c
was	c
always	c
so	c
kind	c
and	c
generous	c
towards	c
his	c
pupils	c
that	c
any	c
girls	i
felt	c
herself	c
loved	c
by	c
him	c
:	c
Pat	c
certainly	c
was	c
one	c
of	c
them	c
.	c

She	c
was	c
so	c
angry	c
and	c
felt	c
so	c
betrayed	c
by	c
Mr	c
White	c
that	c
without	c
any	c
exitation	i
she	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
school	c
Headmaster	c
to	c
report	c
everything	c
she	c
had	c
seen	c
.	c

The	c
trial	c
was	c
long	c
and	c
had	i
a	i
wide	c
coverage	c
by	i
media	i
.	c

We	c
live	c
in	c
a	c
small	c
and	c
old	i
fashioned	i
town	c
and	c
Mr.	c
White	c
was	c
considered	c
a	c
monster	c
:	c
loosing	i
his	c
job	c
was	c
hard	c
for	c
him	c
,	c
but	c
even	c
harder	c
was	c
the	c
loss	c
of	c
his	c
beloved	c
pupils	c
who	c
were	c
not	c
allowed	c
to	c
meet	c
him	c
;	c
so	c
,	c
on	c
a	c
bright	c
summer	c
day	c
he	c
took	c
his	c
final	c
decision	c
and	c
died	c
terrified	i
by	c
the	c
darkness	c
which	c
was	c
nearing	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
the	c
only	c
suitable	c
time	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
go	c
is	c
July	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
the	c
only	c
time	c
when	c
I	c
am	c
free	c
from	c
my	c
duties	c
-	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
doctor	c
so	c
you	c
see	c
that	c
I	c
can	i
not	i
let	c
my	c
patients	c
down	c

Unconected	i
part	i
of	i
every	i
people	i
lifes	i
is	i
shopping	i
.	i

We	c
buy	c
everything	c
from	c
clothes	c
to	c
food	c
and	c
the	c
only	c
thing	c
that	c
could	c
stop	c
us	c
from	c
this	c
are	i
money	c
.	c

As	c
a	c
teenager	c
I	c
must	c
addmit	i
that	c
there	c
is	c
nothing	c
more	c
enjoyable	c
from	i
shopping	c
.	c

It	c
all	c
comes	c
from	c
my	c
parents	c
.	c

All	c
I	c
ought	i
to	c
do	c
is	c
buy	c
and	c
choose	c
.	c

Everybody	c
know	i
that	c

Dear	c
Mrs/Ms	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
the	c
prize	c
I	c
won	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
rather	c
than	c
in	c
tents	i
,	c
because	c
I	c
find	c
it	c
more	c
confortable	i
to	c
sleep	c
in	c
beds	i
,	c
but	c
it	c
would	c
n't	c
be	c
a	c
problem	c
if	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
sleep	c
in	c
tents	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
great	c
!	c

The	c
concert	c
was	c
organized	c
by	c
the	c
community	c
so	c
everyone	c
who	c
wanted	c
to	c
help	c
was	c
welcomed	i
.	c

It	c
was	c
hard	c
and	c
it	c
took	c
me	c
the	c
whole	c
day	c
.	c

Of	c
course	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
do	c
it	c
alone	c
,	c
we	c
were	c
a	c
group	c
of	c
about	c
ten	c
guys	c
.	c

I	c
made	c
great	c
friends	c
with	c
the	c
group	c
I	c
worked	c
with	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
to	c
California	c
this	c
July	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
can	c
take	c
an	i
holiday	c
from	c
14th	c
to	c
27th	c
of	c
July	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
log	c
cabins	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
my	c
only	c
favorite	i
hobby	c
.	c

Also	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
a	c
dog	c
.	c

Please	c
,	c
let	c
me	c
know	c
this	i
questions	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c
.	c

Dear	c
Kim	c

Also	c
,	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
I	i
'll	i
want	i
to	c
be	c
an	c
organizer	c
like	c
this	i
concert	c
,	c
so	c
it	c
'll	c
be	c
useful	c
the	i
experience	c
to	i
me	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
somewhat	c
hard	c
to	i
me	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c

Also	c
,	c
I	c
would	c

to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
rather	c
than	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
.	c

Another	c
consideration	c
are	c
activities	i
.	c

I	c
enjoy	c
playing	c
basketball	c
and	c
golf	c
.	c

Also	c
I	c
think	c
I	c
am	c
good	c
at	c
singing	c
and	c
at	c
dancing	c
.	c

-	c
How	c
to	i
get	i
to	c
Camp	c
California	c
from	c
airport	i
?	c

-	c
How	c
far	c
from	c
city-centre	i
the	i

is	i
situated	c
?	c

-	c
How	c
much	c
money	c
I	i

I	c

The	c
aim	c
of	c
this	c

is	c
to	c
summarize	c
the	c

attituds	i
about	i

they	c
have	c
to	c

made	i
and	c
to	c
suggest	c
which	c
lessons	c

other	c
activities	c
should	c
be	c

What	c
would	c
the	c
pupils	c
prefer	c
to	c
film	c
?	c

-	c
Also	c
they	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
film	c
the	c
pat	i
corner	c
at	c

because	c
they	c
enjoy	c

June	c

13th	c
2000	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
would	c
now	c
like	c
to	c
answer	i
the	c
information	c
you	c
requested	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
be	c
pleased	c
if	c
I	c
could	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
as	c
I	c
already	c
booked	c
this	c
month	c
as	c
a	c
holiday	c
at	c
work	c
.	c

I	c
know	c
I	c
have	c
already	c
asked	c
a	c
lot	c
but	c
there	c
is	c
one	c
more	c
thing	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
know	i
which	i
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
will	c
be	c
appropriate	c
and	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
will	c
I	c
approximately	i
need	i
?	c

June	c
,	c
13th	c
2000	c

Here	c
,	c
everything	c
is	c
as	c
usual	c
:	c
School	i
,	c
studying	c
,	c
eating	c
,	c
sleeping	c
-	c
but	c
did	c
I	c
tell	c
you	c
about	c
my	c
latest	c
job	c
?	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
helped	c
selling	c
tickets	c
and	c
drinks	c
and	c
there	c
I	c
realized	c
how	c
bad	c
my	c
maths	c
is	c
-	c
I	c
took	c
such	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
to	c
give	c
back	c
the	c
change	c
!	c

But	c
at	i
the	i
end	i
I	c
handled	c
it	c
almost	c
automatically	c
.	c

Before	c
the	c
performance	c
I	c
introduced	i
the	c
spectators	c
to	c
their	c
seats	c
and	c
then	c
a	i
instructor	c
showed	c
me	c
how	c
to	i
lead	i
the	c
spotlights	c
.	c

I	c
really	c
had	c
butterflies	c
in	c
my	c
stomach	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
responsible	c
for	c
the	c
lightening	i
!	c

He	c
asked	c
me	c
what	c
I	c
was	c
doing	c
and	c
so	c
on	c
and	c
finally	c
invited	c
me	c
for	i
his	c
next	c
concert	c
!	c

I	c
can	c
hardly	c
await	i
your	c
reply	c
!	c

Jun	c
10/2000	c

I	c
am	c
really	c
surprise	i
for	i
the	i
information	i
because	i
I	c
won	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
like	i
to	c
tell	i
you	i
thank	c
you	c
for	c
everyting	i
this	c
is	c
why	c
I	c
wrote	c
and	c
send	i
this	c
letter	c
with	c
the	c
information	c
you	c
need	c
,	i
only	i
I	i
can	i
travel	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
the	c
only	c
time	c
with	i
I	c
can	c
do	c
it	c
before	c
for	i
my	i
work	c
,	i
really	i
I	i
do	i
not	i
care	i
which	i
accommodation	c
will	i
I	i
can	i
have	c
,	i
I	c
am	i
prefer	c
the	i
accommodation	i
in	c
July	c
I	i
will	i
be	i
avaliabel	i
for	i
the	i
moment	i
,	i
I	c
am	i
really	c
apreciated	i
if	i
you	c
can	i
tell	c
to	i
the	c
people	c
who	c
work	c
in	i
Camp	c
California	c
,	i
I	c
choose	c
the	c
Golf	c
and	c
Photography	c
because	c
I	c
think	c
I	c
am	c
really	c
interesting	i
in	c
that	i
object	i
I	i
am	c
no	i
really	c
really	c
good	c
but	c
I	c
have	c
some	c
of	i
studies	i
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
you	i
time	c
.	c

I	c
really	c
enjoy	c
that	c
kind	c
of	c
day	c
what	i
about	c
you	c
?	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

Next	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
find	c
out	c
some	c
details	c
about	c
the	c
camp	c
.	c

Before	i
.	i

I	c
am	c
very	c
close	c
to	c
the	i
nature	c
,	c
so	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
a	c
pleasure	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

That	c
is	c
why	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
continue	c
doing	c
this	c
at	c
the	c
camp	c
.	c

A.	c
Adamski	c
.	c

When	c
discribing	i
the	c
advantages	c
,	c
we	c
should	c
remember	c
that	c
most	c
people	c
like	c
doing	c
shopping	c
.	c

What	c
is	c
more	c
,	c
most	c
people	c
cannot	c
live	c
without	c
shopping	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
some	c
minuses	c
.	c

Walking	c
from	c
shop	c
to	c
shop	c
carrying	c
heavy	c
bags	c
,	c
takes	c
much	c
of	c
your	c
time	c
.	c

Instead	c
of	c
that	c
you	c
could	c
do	c
more	c
interesting	c
things	c
.	i

such	c
as	c
playing	c
sports	c
or	c
reading	c
a	c
book	c
.	c

Besides	c
that	c
,	c
shopping	c
steal	i
you	i
from	i
money	i
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
shopping	c
is	c
very	c
tiring	c
and	c
I	c
usually	c
try	c
to	c
avoid	c
doing	c
it	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
,	c
I	c
do	c
it	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
think	c
we	c
waste	c
too	c
much	c
time	c
on	c
it	c
that	i
we	i
should	i
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Ryan	c
,	c

Accordingly	c
I	c
will	c
give	c
you	c
the	c
further	c
information	c
that	c
you	c
wanted	c
.	c

I	c
choose	c
singing	c
and	c
surfing	c
,	i
singing	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
singer	c
in	c
a	c
band	c
and	c
I	c
hope	c
to	c
make	c
my	c
voice	c
more	c
perfect	c
and	c
surfing	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
surf	i
and	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
learn	c
to	i
.	c

Is	i
it	i
possible	i
to	i
travel	i
with	c
a	c
friend	c
of	c
mine	c
?	c

I	c
hope	c
fine	i
.	c

At	i
the	i
time	i
the	i
concert	i
was	i
running	i
I	c
cleaned	c
the	c
kitchen	c
and	c
the	c
room	c
where	c
the	c
"	c
stars	c
"	c
ate	c
.	c

The	c
after	i
show	i
dinner	c
party	c
was	c
very	c
nice	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
thought	c
that	c
popular	i
people	i
like	c
Elton	c
John	c
dances	i
on	c
the	c
table	c
if	c
he	i
likes	i
the	c
music	c
and	c
if	c
he	i
have	c
made	i
a	c
great	c
show	c
on	c
stage	c
.	c

Marlene	c

Dear	c
Manager	c
,	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
is	c
far	c
away	c
from	c
being	c
the	c
best	c
musical	c
show	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
exited	i
to	c
see	c
it	c
yesterday	c
,	c
but	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
I	c
arrived	c
at	c
the	c
theater	i
the	c
problems	c
began	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
looking	c
forward	c
on	i
having	i
a	c
discount	c
of	c
some	i
pounds	c
on	c
my	c
ticket	c
,	c
as	c
the	c
leaflet	c
says	i
,	c
however	c
it	i
did	c
not	c
happen	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
the	c
actors	c
were	c
not	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
,	c
but	c
others	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
seeing	i
before	c
,	c
and	c
the	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
with	c
no	c
advise	i
.	c

At	i
last	i
,	c
for	c
all	c
these	c
reasons	c
my	c
evening	c
was	c
horrible	c
,	c
and	c
that	c
is	c
why	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
for	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c
.	c

Yours	c
Sincerelly	i
,	c

In	i
the	i
other	i
hand	i
,	c
technology	c
has	c
made	i
the	c
differences	c
between	c
-	i
poor	c
and	c
rich	c
people	c
to	c
grow	i
at	i
a	i
high	i
level	i
,	c
and	c
this	c
is	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
biggest	c
causes	c
of	c
violence	c
in	c
all	c
countries	c
.	c

I	i
addition	c
to	c
that	c
,	c
people	c
will	c
always	c
be	c
affraid	i
of	c
the	i
technological	c
war	c
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
from	c
my	c
point	c
of	c
view	c
,	c
people	c
must	c
learn	c
that	c
despite	c
technology	c
being	c
such	c
a	c
new	i
area	c
to	c
explore	c
,	c
we	c
have	c
to	c
use	c
it	c
with	c
a	c
great	c
amount	i
of	c
responsability	i
,	i
for	c
us	c
all	c
to	c
survive	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
.	c

Thanks	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
,	i
I	c
am	c
so	c
glad	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
asked	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
only	c
in	c
July	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
quite	c
busy	c
with	c
my	c
job	c
.	c

I	c
often	c
go	c
climbing	c
in	c
my	c
town	c
.	c

For	i
sailing	c
,	c
well	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
n't	c
try	i
it	c
before	c
,	i
that	i
is	c
why	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
try	i
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
must	c
be	c
fun	c
.	c

How	c
much	c
do	c
you	c
think	c
that	c
I	c
will	c
need	c
.	i

Just	c
imagine	c
if	c
one	c
day	c
their	c
husbands	c
lost	c
their	c
jobs	c
,	i
will	i
those	c
women	c
still	c
thinking	i
shopping	c
is	c
enjoyable	c
!	c

So	c
it	c
is	i
depend	i
on	c
different	i
case	c
.	c

Shopping	c
is	c
just	c
like	c
a	c
nightmare	c
to	c
me	c
,	i
I	c
think	c
I	c
will	c
never	c
understand	c
why	c
people	c
love	c
shopping	c
.	c

Some	c
women	c
spend	c
their	c
whole	c
life	c
doing	i
shopping	c
,	c
and	c
most	c
of	c
times	i
,	c
they	c
do	c
n't	c
buy	c
many	c
things	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
eyes	c
they	c
are	c
wasting	c
their	c
lifes	i
,	c
they	c
are	c
hopeless	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
to	c
give	c
some	i
opinions	c
of	c
mine	c
abut	i
The	c
International	c
Arts	c
Festival	c

.	c

I	c
think	i
that	i
there	i
were	i
not	i
enough	c
plays	c
and	c
films	c
.	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
bout	i
my	c
suggestions	c
for	c
next	c
year	c
's	c
festival	c
.	c

It	c
would	c
be	c
wonderful	c
to	c
buy	c
some	c
books	c
or	c
programms	i
with	c
signatures	i
of	c
all	c
the	c
stars	c
and	c
artists	c
taking	c
part	c
in	c
the	c

Hello	c
Philip	c
,	c

In	c
our	c
school	c
we	c
have	c
the	c
following	c
rules	c
:	c
1	c
.	c

Every	c
puple	i
has	c
to	c
sit	c
alone	c
(	i
I	c
mean	c
that	c
one	c
desk	c
is	c
given	c
for	i
one	c
man	i
)	i

These	c
rules	c
are	c
strict	c
and	c
certainly	c
we	c
have	c
endless	i
number	c
of	c
just-so-called	i
rules	c
.	c

Truely	i
speaking	c
I	c
am	c
not	c
sure	c
about	c
home	c
rules	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
in	c
our	c
family	c
everything	c
is	c
based	c
on	c
mutual	c
understanding	c
.	c

We	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
old-traditioned	i
rules	c
or	c
something	i
alike	i
.	i

Love	c

I	c
have	c
just	c
received	c
your	c
letter	c
and	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
all	c
this	c
information	c
that	c
you	c
giving	i
me	c
.	c

Fist	i
of	c
all	c
,	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
good	c
thing	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
July	c
would	c
be	c
the	c
best	c
time	c
to	c
travel	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
hotest	i
mounth	i
in	c
the	c
year	c
,	c
and	c
the	c
weather	c
shall	i
be	c
really	c
nice	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
as	c
you	c
asked	c
me	c
to	c
choose	c
two	c
activities	c
,	c
I	c
'm	c
choosing	c
swimming	c
and	c
climbing	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
'm	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
swimming	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
try	c
myself	i
at	i
climbing	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
do	i
I	c
have	c
to	c
bring	c
with	c
me	c

Dear	c
Ms	c
Jane	i
Clark	c
,	c

I	c
believe	c
your	c
festival	c
to	c
be	c
a	c
great	c
event	c
in	c
our	c
cultural	c
life	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
convinced	c
that	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
success	c
.	c

Wuthering	c
Heights	c
-	c
Emily	c
Brontë	c

Stories	c
that	c
are	c
realistic	c
help	c
us	c
to	c
understand	c
better	i
our	i
own	i
life	i
and	i
people	i
around	i
us	i
.	c

It	c
is	c
a	c
remarkable	c
piece	c
of	c
literature	c
,	c
which	c
portrays	c
deep	c
feelings	c
of	c
love	c
and	c
hate	c
,	c
depicts	c
strong	c
and	c
unique	c
characters	c
,	c
reveals	i
eternal	c
concerns	c
with	c
good	c
and	c
bad	c
,	c
life	c
and	c
death	c
.	c

This	c
book	c
is	c
both	c
realistic	c
and	c
unusual	c
and	c
in	c
my	c
opinion	c
this	c
is	c
the	c
core	c
of	c
its	c
originality	c
.	c

It	c
contributes	c
to	c
the	c
world	i
treasurehouse	i
of	c
literature	c
and	c
arouses	c
irresistable	i
fascination	c
.	c

i	i
am	c
writing	c
to	c
reply	c
your	i
questions	c
about	c
me	c
.	c

To	c
tell	c
you	c
the	c
truth	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
do	c
swimming	c
and	c
singing	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
been	c
swimming	c
for	c
eight	c
years	c
!	c

Thanks	c
for	c
you	i
letter	c
.	c

The	c
concert	c
lasted	c
four	i
hours	c
and	c
in	i
the	c
end	c
they	c
wanted	c
to	c
pay	c
me	c
.	c

P.S.	c
I	c
hope	c
you	c
will	c
find	c
the	c
spare	c
time	c
to	c
visit	c
my	c
country	c
this	c
Summer	i
.	c

As	c
regards	c
to	i
the	i
time	i
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
make	c
you	c
aware	c
that	c
I	c
can	c
only	c
on	i
July	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
very	i
tied	c
up	c
this	i
time	c
owing	c
to	c
he	i
exam	c
period	c
which	i
will	c
last	c
until	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
June	c
.	c

I	c
'd	c
rather	c
have	c
accommodation	c
in	c
tents	c
,	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
good	c
experience	c
for	c
me	c
especially	i
because	c
I	c
have	c
n't	c
lived	i
it	i
as	i
well	i
as	i
it	i
is	i
more	i
romantic	i
.	c

Furthermore	c
I	c
will	c
have	c
the	c
opportunity	c
to	c
play	c
basketball	c
,	c
despite	c
the	c
fact	c
that	c
I	c
am	c
not	c
too	i
tall	c
for	c
this	c
kind	c
of	c
sport	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
would	c
you	c
mind	c
to	i
send	i
me	c
more	c
information	c
about	c
the	c
amount	c
of	c
money	c
that	c
I	c
should	c
have	i
.	c

Thank	c

,	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
looking	c

The	c
gym	c

for	c
filming	c
with	c
the	c

equipments	i
that	c
owns	i

In	c
addition	c
,	c
we	c
can	c
film	c
the	c
library	c

possesses	c
thousand	c
of	c
works	c

It	c
will	c
be	c
a	i
good	c
advertising	c
,	c
and	c
will	c
help	c

make	c
the	c

better	c

I	c

Second	c

I	c

I	c

Because	i

Hi	c
!	c

The	c
interview	c
was	c
OK	c
and	c
my	c
friend	c
and	c
I	c
was	i
hired	c
!	c

Then	c
,	c
the	c
day	c
of	c
the	c
concert	c
came	c
!	c

Can	c
you	c
imagine	c
how	c
excited	c
we	c
were	c
?	c

Our	c
heart	i
was	i
bumping	i
and	c
we	c
were	c
kind	c
of	c
nervous	c
,	c
however	c
,	c
there	c
were	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
things	c
to	c
do	c
so	i
we	c
started	c
working	c
.	c

If	c
only	c
I	c
could	c
sing	c
beautifully	c
!	c

Maybe	c
next	c
time	c
!	c

Please	c
take	c
care	c
and	c
please	c
write	c
to	c
me	c
,	c
right	c
?	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
I	i
'd	c
like	c

thank	c
you	c

the	c
prize	c
,	c
I	c
will	c

it	c
abosolutly	i

Your	c
letter	c
encloses	c
an	c
application	c
I	i
have	c
to	c
fill	c
with	i
some	c
information	c
for	i
the	c
travel	i
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c

I	c
sympathize	c
with	c
Heathcliff	c
because	c
I	c
think	c
every	c
bad	c
character	c
is	c
a	c
very	c
important	c
point	i
of	c
every	c
book	c
,	c
film	c
or	c
play	c
and	c
if	c
they	c
were	c
missing	c
we	c
would	c
not	c
love	c
those	c
stories	c
we	c
enjoyed	c
while	c
we	c
were	c
reading	c
them	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Ryan	c
,	c

It	c
is	c
not	c
too	c
much	i
confortable	i
,	c
but	c
it	i
is	c
not	c
a	c
problem	c
for	c
me	c
,	i
I	c
like	c
this	c
kind	c
of	c
holliday	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
be	c
grateful	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
tell	c
me	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
with	c
and	i
how	c
many	i
money	c
,	c
more	c
or	c
less	c
,	c
do	i
you	c
think	c
I	c
should	c
take	c

Audrey	c
Gillett	c

Then	c
I	c
put	c
some	i
blue	c
lights	c
.	c

The	c
most	c
exiting	i
part	c
was	c
when	c
I	c
had	c
to	i
make	i
up	i
the	c
pop	i
stars	i
!	i

Do	c
you	c
believe	c
that	c
I	c
spoke	c
with	c
Micheal	c
Jackson	c
,	c
my	c
favourite	c
singer	c
?	c

I	c
ca	c
n't	c
explain	c
how	c
supper	i
it	c
was	c
.	c

I	c
stayed	c
with	c
him	c
until	c
the	c
concert	c
begun	i
and	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
I	c
had	c
the	c
opportunity	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
his	c
private	c
room	c
with	c
him	c
and	c
the	c
other	c
dansers	i
.	c

Well	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
leave	c
you	c
now	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
will	c
tell	i
you	c
more	c
details	c
when	c
we	c
next	c
meet	c
each	c
other	c
.	c

Audrey	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
the	c
play	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
start	c
at	c
7:30	c
P.M.	c
but	c
it	c
actually	c
started	c
only	i
at	c
8:15	c
P.M.	c
so	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
wait	c
forty-five	c
minutes	c
.	c

What	i
is	c
quite	i
not	i
true	c
because	c
when	c
I	c
asked	c
for	c
it	i
,	c
the	c
woman	c
who	c
sells	c
the	c
tickets	c
replied	c
with	c
a	c
resounding	c
"	i
no	i
"	c
.	c

When	c
the	c
play	c
finally	c
started	c
,	c
and	c
the	c
two	c
actors	c
entered	c
the	c
stage	c
,	c
I	c
could	c
see	c
that	c
the	c
male	c
one	c
was	c
not	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
differently	i
from	i
what	c
the	c
advertisement	c
sign	i
says	c
,	c
what	i
really	c
disappointed	c
me	c
since	c
he	c
was	c
the	c
only	c
reason	c
that	c
I	c
came	c
to	c
this	c
play	c
.	c

As	c
we	c
all	c
know	c
,	c
technology	c
had	i
a	i
gigantic	i
improvement	i
over	c
the	c
last	c
20	c
years	c
,	c
and	c
today	c
,	c
it	c
affects	c
us	c
in	c
many	c
ways	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
we	c
all	i
became	i
much	c
more	c
sedentary	c
than	c
in	c
the	c
past	c
.	c

Please	c
send	c
me	c
a	c
list	c
of	c
needed	i
clothes	c
and/or	c
supplies	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
if	c
there	c
is	c
a	c
medical	c
staff	c
present	c
during	c
the	c
two	c
weeks	c
?	i

Does	c
any	c
medication	c
have	i
to	c
be	c
declared	c
to	c
them	c
?	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
it	c
depends	c
on	c
who	c
is	c
with	c
you	c
and	c
what	c
the	c
other	c
person	c
likes	c
to	c
shop	c
for	c
.	c

Why	c
would	c
anyone	c
shop	c
with	c
that	c
type	c
of	c
person	c
?	c

Well	c
,	c
I	c
really	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
.	c

If	c
it	c
is	c
something	c
they	c
like	c
,	c
they	c
always	c
have	c
to	c
try	c
it	c
on	c
.	c

Shopping	c
for	c
them	c
is	c
a	c
very	c
long	c
and	c
tiring	c
experiance	i
.	c

It	c
seems	c
to	c
last	c
forever	c
and	c
just	c
when	c
you	c
think	c
she	c
's	c
done	c
,	c
she	c
spots	c
an	i
othe	i
pair	c
.	c

This	c
made	i
me	i
really	i
disappointed	i
.	c

It	c
was	c
also	c
said	c
that	c
discounts	c
was	i
available	c
but	c
this	c
was	c
wrong	c
,	c
because	c
we	c
could	c
n't	c
get	c
any	c
discounts	c
.	c

This	c
should	c
have	c
been	c
our	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
therefor	i
writing	c
to	c
ask	c
for	c
a	c
full	c
refund	c

This	c
was	c
the	c
best	c
thing	c
that	c
ever	i
had	i
happend	i
in	i
years	i
for	i
the	i
Fennall	i
family	i
.	c

Pat	c
's	c
sister-in-law	c
was	c
having	c
a	c
baby	c
but	c
she	c
wanted	c
to	c
wait	c
and	c
tell	c
the	c
rest	c
of	c
the	c
family	c
.	c

She	c
realised	c
that	c
telling	c
Pat	c
was	c
a	c
very	c
bad	c
idea	c
but	c
now	c
it	c
was	c
done	c
.	c

She	c
and	c
her	c
husband	c
Peter	c
had	c
been	c
trying	c
for	c
so	c
long	c
and	c
now	c
they	c
had	c
succeeded	c
.	c

Many	c
weeks	c
went	c
by	c
and	c
Maria	c
and	c
Pat	c
did	c
n't	c
say	c
a	c
word	c
about	c
it	c
.	c

The	c
rest	c
of	c
the	c
family	c
understood	c
that	c
something	c
was	c
wrong	c
because	c
Pat	c
started	c
to	c
buy	c
baby	c
clothes	c
.	c

Which	c
was	c
very	c
chooking	i
for	c
her	c
mother	c

OF	c
THE	c
THINGS	c
I	c

AND	c
GIVE	c
A	c
HAND	c
IF	c
NEEDED	c

according	i
to	c
the	c
question	c
of	i
wich	i
type	c
of	c
accommodation	c
I	c
prefer	c
,	c
I	c
choose	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
the	i
tent	c
is	c
more	i
messy	i

so	c
I	c
would	c
appreciate	c
if	i
you	c
give	c

Anyway	c
I	c

At	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
show	c
,	c
unfortunately	c
for	c
me	c
and	c
the	c
others	i
spectators	c
,	c
the	c
worst	c
thing	c
happened	c
:	c
the	c
theatre	c
's	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
without	c
any	c
reasons	c
and	i
nobody	c
went	i
to	c
us	c
to	c
apologise	c
or	c
advice	i
us	c
for	i
an	i
other	i
restaurant	c
opened	i
late	c
in	i

Pat	c
was	c

very	c
good	c
at	c

That	c
's	c
why	c
all	c
his	c
friends	c
were	c
angry	c
against	i
him	c
and	c
let	i
him	c
alone	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
clear	c
that	c
Pat	c
had	c
to	c
change	c
and	c
show	c
to	i
his	c

that	c
they	c
can	i

I	c
need	c
some	c
practise	i

You	c

were	i
broken	c
by	c
the	c
transport	c

The	c

About	c
accommodation	c
during	c
these	c
two	c
weeks	c
at	c
the	c
Camp	c
I	i
would	c
prefer	c
log	i
cabins	i
;	c
because	c
maybe	c
is	i
more	c
interesting	c
to	c
share	c
with	c
other	c
people	c
.	c

In	i
other	i
hand	i
you	c
ask	i
me	c
I	c
have	c
the	c
chance	c
for	i
to	c
choose	c
two	c
activities	c
while	c
I	c
am	c
at	c
the	c
camp	c
.	c

Can	c
you	c
said	i
me	c
if	c
is	i
necessary	c
to	c
bring	c
special	i
clothes	c
,	i
I	i
refer	i
for	i
instance	c
if	c
I	c
practice	i
surfing	c
I	i
need	c
water	i
suit	i
.	c

Is	c
possible	i
to	c
get	c
there	i
?	c

I	c
am	i
really	c
appreciate	c
if	i
you	c
can	i
answer	c
me	i
these	c
doubt	i
and	c
saying	i
again	i
.	c

this	c
prize	c
.	c

For	c
the	i
men	c
and	c
women	c
is	i
important	i
the	i
appearance	i
and	c
they	c
spent	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
money	c
in	i
buy	i
clothes	c
,	c
cosmetic	i
,	c
accesories	i
,	c
jewels	i
etc.	c
And	c
the	i
other	c
they	i
choose	i
sometimes	i
just	c
for	c
the	c
label	c
.	c

In	i
the	i
other	i
hand	i
the	c
facilities	c
for	c
access	c
to	c
mall	i
center	i
is	i
not	c
good	c
.	c

A	c
few	c
days	c
ago	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
London	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
nice	c
holiday	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
expecting	c
to	c
have	c
fun	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
play	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
,	c
thats	i
now	c
presenting	i
in	c
your	c
theatre	c
.	c

I	c
let	c
this	c
pass	c
and	c
I	c
bought	c
it	c
anyway	c
,	c
thinking	c
that	c
was	i
posible	i
that	c
it	i
was	c
only	c
a	c
mistake	c
in	c
your	c
advertisement	c
.	c

Specting	i
that	c
you	c
will	c
solve	i
this	c
misunderstanding	c
.	c

It	c
has	c
changed	c
the	c
ways	c
in	i
how	i
people	c
comunicate	i
.	c

I	c
have	i
received	i
your	c
letter	c
yesterday	c
.	c

I	c
really	i
thanks	i
for	i
your	i
organisation	i
has	i
given	i
me	i
the	i
opportunities	i
to	c
go	c
abroad	i
U.S.A	c
.	c

And	c
I	c
need	c
few	i
days	c
to	c
prepare	c
my	c
stuff	c
.	c

Regarding	c
to	i
the	c
accommodation	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
tents	c
more	i
than	c
log	c
carbins	i
because	c
I	c
have	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
experiences	i
of	c
built	i
up	c
my	c
own	c
tents	c
.	c

The	i
activities	c
that	c
you	c
have	c
listed	c
forms	i
.	c

Although	c
I	c
'm	c
not	c
the	c
best	c
,	c
but	i
I	c
have	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
confident	i
in	i
it	c
.	c

For	i
frank	i
,	c
I	c
like	c
to	c
shopping	i
.	c

I	c
like	c
to	c
have	i
window	c
shopping	c
that	i
is	i
good	i
to	i
go	i
arround	i
the	c
shopping	c
area	i
.	c

It	c
would	i
help	i
you	c
up	i
to	c
the	i
date	c
.	c

Because	c
of	c
the	c
crowd	i
.	c

So	c
sometimes	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
think	c
shopping	c
is	c
enjoyable	c
,	c
and	c
if	c
there	c
is	c
any	c
big	c
festival	i
,	c
I	c
would	c
rather	c
stay	c
at	c
home	c
and	c
watch	c
television	c
.	c

13.06.2000	c

I	c
am	c
happy	c
that	c
I	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
travelling	c
to	c
California	c
.	c

If	c
there	c
are	c
only	c
tents	c
available	c
at	c
this	c
time	c
it	c
will	c
not	c
be	c
a	c
problem	c
for	c
me	c
,	i
too	i
.	c

On	i
the	i
other	i
side	i
I	c
have	c
no	c
experience	c
in	i
surfing	c
,	i
-	c
I	c
am	c
an	c
absolute	c
beginner	c
with	c
high	c
motivation	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
getting	c
further	c
information	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

'	c
Shopping	c
'	c
could	c
be	c
annoying	c
if	c
you	c
look	c
at	i
it	c
as	c
a	c
waste	c
of	c
time	c
because	c
you	c
do	c
it	c
every	c
day	c
.	c

This	c
is	c
even	c
an	i
appropriate	i
way	c
to	c
get	c
around	c
unfriendly	i
service	c
you	c
get	c
to	c
know	c
if	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
buy	c
something	c
in	c
a	c
shop	c
right	c
before	c
closing	c
time	c
.	c

Recently	c
I	c
am	i
interested	c
in	c
musical	c
shows	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
seen	c
it	i
in	c
my	c
country	c
.	c

As	c
I	c
arrived	c
there	c
after	c
5	c
P.M.	c
,	c
I	c
missed	c
the	c
first	c
performance	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
19:30	c
p.m	c
performance	c
.	c

The	c
worst	c
one	i
was	c
that	c
the	c
actor	c
and	c
actress	c
were	c
not	c
the	c
person	i
who	c
had	c
been	c
written	c
in	i
the	c
advertisement	c
,	c
because	c
of	c
that	c
I	c
was	c
extremely	c
disappointed	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
really	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
!	c

So	c
I	c
am	c
asking	c
for	c
some	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
receiving	c
your	c
prompt	c
reply	c
.	c

It	c
could	c
be	c
difficult	c
to	c
feel	c
how	c
many	c
things	c
has	i
been	c
changed	c
in	c
our	c
daily	c
life	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
we	i
can	c
be	i
connected	i
other	c
people	c
with	c
a	c
mobile	c
phone	c
no	c
matter	c
where	c
you	c
are	c
and	c
you	c
can	c
correspond	c
to	i
other	i
contry	i
people	i
in	c
real	c
time	c
by	c
using	c
internet	i
.	c

How	c
incredable	i
it	c
is	c
!	c

However	c
not	i
only	c
this	c
advantage	c
but	c
also	i
there	i
are	i
lots	c
of	c
disadvantages	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
say	c
the	i
science	c
and	c
techology	c
changed	c
our	c
daily	c
life	c
more	i
convenience	c
it	i
also	c
could	c
be	c
dangerous	c

'd	c
like	c
to	c
join	c
the	c
activities	c
,	c
swimming	c
and	c
Singing	c
.	c

I	c
love	c
swimming	c
and	c
also	c
I	c
've	c
got	c
a	c
scubar	i
diving	c
licence	c
.	c

Singing	c
is	c
the	c
most	c
favarite	i
hobby	c
for	c
us	c
.	c

We	c
often	c
go	c
out	c
to	c
sing	c
in	c
Karaoke	i
bar	c
.	c

Secondary	i
the	i
customer	i
's	i
service	c
often	c
makes	c
us	c
angry	c
.	c

So	c
their	c
attitude	c
sometimes	c
seems	c
to	c
be	c
bossy	c
and	c
pushy	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
necessary	c
to	c
buy	c
something	c
to	c
alive	i
.	c

Even	i
when	i
the	i
risk	i
comes	i
up	i
with	i
shopping	i
.	i

To	c
make	c
matters	c
worse	c
the	c
musical	c
started	c
almost	c
one	c
hour	c
later	c
than	c
it	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
start	c
.	c

This	c
event	c
was	c
not	c
what	c
I	c
call	c
:	i
"	c
a	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
"	c
,	c
as	c
your	c
advertisement	c
promised	c
.	c

Maybe	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
so	c
bad	c
after	c
all	c
?	c

I	c
pretended	c
to	c
be	c
totaly	i
miserable	c
.	c

Pat	c
did	c
n't	c
know	c
what	c
to	c
do	c
,	i
she	i
apoligised	i
over	c
and	c
over	c
again	c
and	c
I	c
could	c
really	c
see	c
that	c
she	c
was	c
more	c
than	c
devestated	i
.	c

Finally	c
I	c
smiled	c
.	c

Especially	c
not	c
if	c
it	c
has	c
to	c
do	c
with	c
failing	c
all	c
exams	i
....	c

A	c
few	c
days	c
ago	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
Circle	c
theatre	c
to	c
see	c
a	c
musical	c
show	c
which	c
it	i
shows	i
in	c
your	c
theatre	c
now	c
.	c

Also	c
I	i
had	c
a	c
student	c
identification	c
card	c
to	c
discount	i
the	c
ticket	c
price	c
but	c
it	i
was	i
unavilable	i
to	i
discount	i
.	c

Barclays	c
bank	c
1010-10	c
1234567	c

Also	c
T.Vs	c
,	c
I	c
guess	c
that	c
I	c
was	i
not	i
able	c
to	c
watch	c
colour	c
T.V	c
if	c
I	c
was	c
born	c
in	c
1960	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
to	c
wait	c
45	c
minutes	c
,	c
wasting	c
time	c
.	c

You	c
said	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
perfect	i
evening	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
.	c

Pat	c
talks	i
others	i
secrets	c
to	c
everyone	c
easily	c
.	c

His	c
girl	i
friend	i
talked	c
to	c
him	c
everything	i
.	c

Because	i
she	c
believed	i
him	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
about	c
his	c
private	c
problem	c
,	c
related	c
his	i
friendship	i
in	c
whole	i
school	c
.	c

Actually	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
on	c
his	i
purpose	c
.	c

But	c
sometimes	c
,	c
Pat	c
mistakes	i
to	i
speak	i
someone	c
's	c
secrets	c
.	c

Though	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
on	c
his	i
purpose	c
,	c
it	c
makes	c
his	c
friends	c
leave	c
him	c
.	c

They	c
ca	c
n't	c
believe	i
him	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
like	c
his	i
one	i
of	i
bad	c
habbits	i
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c

The	c
other	c
actor	c
was	c
very	c
disappointing	c
.	c

The	c
second	c
problem	c
was	c
the	c
start	c
of	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
n't	c
a	c
perfect	c
evening	c
at	c
all	c
.	c

After	c
breakfeast	i
I	c
have	c
to	c
use	c
my	c
car	c
to	c
get	c
to	c
school	c
.	c

I	c
use	c
it	c
to	c
make	i
compositions	i
,	c
to	c
print	c
some	c
pictures	c
or	c
to	c
surf	c
on	i
the	c
internet	i
.	c

After	c
school	c
I	c
relax	c
in	c
front	c
of	c
the	c
TV	c
and	c
talk	c
a	c
lot	c
with	c
my	c
friends	c
per	i
telephone	i
.	c

Without	c
these	i
technology	c
I	c
would	c
get	c
realy	i
bored	c
.	c

I	c
AM	c
WRITING	c
TO	c
COMPLAIN	c
ABOUT	c
A	c
MUSICAL	c
SHOW	i
THAT	c
IS	c
TAKING	c
PART	i
IN	i
THE	c
CIRCLE	c
THEATRE	c
.	c

THE	c
FIRST	c
PROBLEM	c
WAS	c
WHEN	c
I	c
READ	c
THE	i
STARRING	c
.	c

I	c
THOUGHT	c
IT	c
WILL	i
BE	c
AT	c
19.30	c
AND	c
I	c
HAVE	i
BEEN	i
WAITING	i
FOR	c
FORTY	i
FIVE	i
MINUTES	c
!	c
!	c

BESIDES	c
THIS	c
,	c
I	c
COULD	c
NOT	c
VISIT	i
THE	c
RESTAURANT	c
IN	c
THE	c
THEATRE	c
BECAUSE	c
IT	c
WAS	c
CLOSED	c
.	c

SO	c
,	c
I	c
HAD	c
TO	c
PAY	c
A	c
LOT	c
OF	c
MONEY	c
TO	c
SEE	c
A	c
PLAY	c
THAT	c
WAS	c
A	c
COMPLETELY	i
DISASTER	c
.	c

MANUELA	c
BELABARA	c

JUST	c
BE	c
YOURSELF	c

THIS	i
PEOPLE	c
WILL	c
BE	c
WORRIED	c
ABOUT	c
WHAT	c
THEY	c
LOOK	c
LIKE	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
rather	i
prefer	c
sleeping	c
in	c
log	i
cabins	i
if	c
its	i
possible	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
back	c
problems	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
not	c
allowed	c
to	c
sleep	c
on	c
the	c
ground	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
rather	c
good	c
at	c
these	c
sports	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
practised	i
them	c
since	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
little	c
girl	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
better	c
at	c
tennis	c
that	c
at	c
golf	c
but	c
anyway	c
I	c
have	c
experience	c
in	c
both	c
these	c
sports	c
.	c

thank	c
you	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
all	c
about	c
the	c
pop	c
concert	c
I	c
helped	c
to	c
organize	c
last	c
month	c
.	c

Boy	c
,	c
He	i
's	i
really	c
really	c
handsom	i
!	c

It	c
was	c
hard	c
work	c
because	i
I	c
have	i
been	c
practising	c
for	c
several	c
weeks	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
to	c
learn	c
what	c
part	c
of	c
the	c
stage	c
had	c
to	c
be	c
lightened	i
with	c
a	c
blue	c
light	c
or	i
a	c
green	c
one	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
never	c
even	c
gone	c
to	c
a	c
concert	c
before	c
.	c

Well	c
,	c
its	c
an	c
experience	c
I	c
'll	c
never	c
forget	c
as	c
long	c
as	c
I	c
live	c
.	c

Write	c
to	c
me	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c
,	c
please	c
!	c

Besides	c
,	c
the	c
actor	c
who	c
filled	c
him	i
in	i
was	c
unknown	c
and	c
specially	c
boring	c
.	c

Anybody	i
could	c
explain	c
to	c
me	c
why	c
!	c

I	c
can	c
assure	c
you	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
a	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
and	c
I	c
got	c
very	c
annoyed	c
about	c
this	c
evening	c
which	c
could	c
have	c
been	c
wonderful	c
.	c

That	c
is	c
the	c
reason	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
you	c
to	c
refund	c
my	c
money	c
.	c

My	c
daily	c
life	c
changed	c
in	c
some	c
ways	c
when	c
I	c
got	i
the	i
hand	i
of	i
using	c
new	c
technologies	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
to	c
work	c
out	c
all	c
my	c
figures	c
two	c
times	c
to	c
make	c
sure	c
that	c
my	c
accounts	c
were	c
accurate	c
.	c

If	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
find	c
out	i
timetables	i
,	c
it	c
is	c
very	c
useful	c
to	c
have	c
the	c
possibility	i
to	c
see	c
on	i
the	c
Internet	c
,	c
besides	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
the	c
quickest	c
way	c
!	c

But	c
after	c
a	c
while	c
you	c
gain	c
experience	c
and	c
you	c
get	i
soon	i
used	c
to	c
this	c
kind	c
of	c
research	c
.	c

That	c
's	c
why	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
great	c
if	c
I	c
could	c
make	c
that	c
journey	c
to	c
the	c
U.S.	c
in	c
July	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
not	c
quite	i
a	c
young	c
man	c
and	c
during	c
the	c
past	i
years	c
of	c
my	c
life	c
I	c
gothave	i
become	i
accostomed	i
to	c
some	i
more	i
comfort	c
.	c

Tents	c
remind	c
me	c
of	c
the	c
time	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
at	i
the	c
army	c
-	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
log	i
cabin	c
for	c
my	c
stay	c
in	c
the	c
camp	c
.	c

Then	c
I	c
tell	c
them	c
to	c
sit	c
down	c
.	c

-	c
Later	c
on	c
we	c
'll	c
go	i
to	i
sing	i
the	c
song	c
of	i
"	c
Old	c
McDonald	c
had	c
a	c
farm	c
"	c
.	c

-	c
The	c
third	c
part	c
of	c
the	c
film	c
will	c
show	c
the	c
children	c
's	c
painting	c
work	c
"	c
Animals	c
on	c
a	c
farm	c
"	c
.	c

-	c
Some	c
sequences	c
of	i
the	c
gym-lesson	i
should	c
conclude	c
the	c
part	c
of	c
the	c
film	c
showing	c
the	c
children	c
at	c
work	c
,	c
but	c
there	c
should	c
follow	c
another	c
short	c
part	c
that	c
presents	i
how	c
children	i
have	c
their	c
lunch	c
and	c
spend	c
their	c
free-time	i
,	c
what	c
games	c
they	c
play	c
in	c
the	c
school-yard	i
and	c
how	c
they	c
have	i
contact	i
with	c
each	c
other	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

Another	c
complain	i
is	c
about	c
the	c
time	c
that	c
the	c
musical	i
show	c
started	c
,	i
the	i
advertisement	c
said	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
19:30	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
did	c
not	c
,	i
we	i
had	c
to	c
wait	c
45	c
minutes	c
.	c

Now	c
,	c
about	c
the	c
tickets	c
,	c
the	i
were	c
different	c
prices	c
but	c
there	c
were	c
not	i
discounts	c
,	c
and	c
because	c
of	c
this	c
,	c
many	c
people	c
could	c
not	c
see	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
especially	c
students	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
when	c
the	c
musical	i
show	c
finished	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
say	c
,	c
a	c
bit	c
late	c
,	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
's	c
restaurant	c
to	c
eat	c
something	c
but	c
this	c
place	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
the	c
chef	c
had	c
already	c
gone	c
.	c

At	i
is	i
explain	i
it	i
was	c
not	c
the	c
perfect	c
evening	c
that	c
I	c
expected	c
to	c
have	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
have	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
because	i
of	i
the	c
reasons	c
that	c
I	c
mentioned	c
before	i
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

Maria	c
talked	c
to	c
Pat	c
about	c
the	c
stupid	c
thing	c
that	c
she	c
did	i
,	c
but	c
Pat	c
refused	c
to	c
apologaising	i
to	c
her	c
,	c
because	c
she	c
felt	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
a	c
mistake	c
and	c
she	c
did	c
it	c
for	c
only	c
one	c
reason	c
:	c
help	i
Maria	c
to	c
get	c
the	c
man	c
that	c
she	c
loved	c
.	c

Maria	c
was	c
speechless	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
the	c
first	c
time	c
that	c
she	c
did	c
n't	c
know	c
what	c
to	c
do	c
,	c
so	c
she	c
decided	c
to	c
stop	c
talking	c
to	c
Pat	c
.	c

One	c
day	c
,	c
when	c
Maria	c
was	c
seating	i
in	c
her	c
bedroom	c
,	c
someone	c
knock	i
the	i
door	c
,	i
it	i
was	c
Manuel	c
,	i
he	i
was	c
worried	c
for	i
her	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
recently	c
got	c
a	c
new	c
job	c
,	c
which	c
I	c
am	c
going	c
to	c
start	c
in	c
August	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
shopping	c
is	c
hard	c
,	c
exhausting	c
work	c
,	c
especially	c
when	c
you	c
are	c
trying	c
to	c
buy	c
yourself	c
some	c
new	c
clothes	c
.	c

You	c
get	c
really	c
angry	c
trying	c
to	c
find	c
a	c
bigger	c
one	c
but	c
unfortunately	c
this	c
is	c
the	c
last	c
one	c
.	c

At	c
last	c
you	c
come	c
back	c
home	c
,	c
carrying	c
the	c
most	c
beautiful	c
skirt	c
in	c
the	c
whole	c
town	c
.	c

You	c
phone	c
your	c
friend	c
to	c
visit	c
you	c
and	c
your	c
friend	c
come	i
,	c
wearing	c
the	i
skirt	c
not	c
unlike	c
the	c
one	c
you	c
have	c
just	c
bought	c
.	c

With	c
regard	c
to	c
your	c
letter	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
and	c
congratulate	c
you	c
for	c
making	c
possible	c
such	i
a	i
wonderful	i

Dear	c

Sorry	c
for	c
not	c

you	i
in	c
the	c
last	c
month	c

Thirty-six	c
people	c
in	c
two	c
hours	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
you	c
asked	c
when	c
would	i
I	i
be	c
able	c
to	c

Answering	c

I	i
would	c

my	c
accomodation	i

log	c
cabins	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

Basing	c
my	c
opinion	c
on	c
my	c
experience	c
I	i
'm	c
going	c
to	c
talk	c
mostly	c
about	c
clothes	c
shopping	c
.	c

There	c
are	c
some	c
points	c
that	c
give	i
me	i
the	i
reason	i
.	c

Who	c
would	c
talk	c
now	c
about	c
enjoyable	c
shopping	c
journeys	i
?	c

I	c
'm	c
sure	c
there	c
would	c
be	c
plenty	c
of	c
people	c
ready	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
.	c

Sir	i
manager	c

The	c
first	c
thing	c
was	c
,	i
that	c
it	c
started	c
45	c
minutes	c
late	c
.	c

I	c
wanted	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
pleasant	c
evening	c
while	c
I	c
'm	c
here	c
in	c
London	c
for	c
a	c
week	c
's	c
holiday	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
ask	c
you	c
sincearly	i
for	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
becaus	i
it	c
was	c
n't	c
a	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
to	c
tell	c
her	c
that	c
I	c
do	i
n't	i
have	c
the	c
time	c
to	c
organise	c
anything	c
becaus	i
we	c
,	c
my	c
mother	c
and	c
I	c
,	c
have	i
to	c
get	c
our	c
stuff	c
ready	c
to	c
move	c
.	c

We	c
are	c
all	c
extremely	c
excited	c
especially	i
because	c
of	c
the	c
trip	c
to	c
Greenwich	c
,	c
the	c
town	c
we	c
were	i
always	i
interested	c
in	c
.	c

Our	c
suggestion	c

He	c

The	c
job	c
was	c
hard	c
,	c
but	c
from	i
my	c
point	c
of	c
view	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
worthful	i

The	c
most	c
exhiting	i
thing	c
was	c
when	c
we	c
removed	c
all	c
the	c
stuff	c
the	c
day	c
after	c
the	c
concert	c
,	c
and	c
we	c

Some	c
words	i
about	c
tickets	i
:	c
you	i
ad	i
noticed	i
that	c
discounts	c
were	c
available	c
so	c
we	c
did	c
n't	c
have	c
money	i
with	c
us	c

It	c
was	c
May	c
,	i
15	c
-	c
our	c
english	i
teacher	c
's	c
birthday	c
.	c

Month	i
ago	i
we	c
began	c
to	c
prepare	c
for	c
this	c
day	c
and	c
we	c
all	c
agreed	c
to	c
keep	c
it	c
in	i
a	c
secret	c
.	c

But	c
we	c
decided	c
to	c
buy	c
a	c
picture	c
,	c
because	c
she	c
has	i
always	i
told	i
us	c
about	c
art	c
galleries	c
with	c
a	i
great	c
exitement	i

That	c
's	c
why	c
he	c
disappointed	c
Marion	c
and	c
us	c
.	c

The	c
person	c
that	c
played	i
instead	c
of	c
Denny	c
was	c
not	c
very	c
good	c

The	c
show	c
supposted	i
to	c
start	c
at	c
19.30	c
pm	c
but	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
20.15	c
pm.	c
It	c
was	c
very	c
late	c
.	c

We	c
bought	c
tickets	c
without	c
discount	i
.	c

The	c
restaurant	c
should	c
open	i
until	c
the	c
show	c
finish	i

I	c
was	c
very	c
disappointed	c
about	c
this	c

out	c
that	c

knew	c
his	c

Dancers	i
worn	i
nice	c
clothes	c
,	c
the	i
music	c
was	c
very	c
good	c
.	c

We	c
also	c
listened	c
to	c
the	c
concerts	c
but	c
in	c
our	c
opinion	c
the	c
concert	c
halls	c
were	c
too	c
small	c

I	c
like	c
listening	c
to	c
the	i
classical	c
music	c
in	c
the	c
big	c
halls	c
,	c
too	c
.	c

My	c
boyfriend	c
was	c
exciting	i
about	c
the	c
art	c
exhibitions	c
and	c
listening	c
to	c
the	c
writers	c

We	c
had	c
no	c
time	c
to	c
watch	c
all	c
plays	i
and	c
films	c
.	c

We	c
chose	c
some	c
of	c
them	c
and	c
we	c
were	c
glad	c
that	c
we	c
had	c
our	c
reasonably	c
ticket	i
for	c
all	c
evants	i
because	c
we	c
could	c
change	c
our	c
planes	i
during	c
the	c
evant	i

We	c
have	c
more	c

in	c
the	c

Monte	c

I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
write	c
about	c
rules	c
in	c
Poland	c
.	c

They	c
're	c
horrible	c
.	c

There	c
are	c
many	c
things	c
we	c
are	c
n't	c
allowed	c
to	c
do	c
at	c
school	c

We	c
have	c
to	c
change	c
our	c
shoes	c
.	c

Most	c
of	i
studenst	i
wear	c
jeans	c
and	c
sweaters	i
.	c

We	c
have	c
to	c
be	c
quiet	c
during	c
the	i
lessons	c
and	c
our	c
lessons	c
are	c
boring	c
because	c
of	c
it	c
.	c

Our	c
school-bags	i
are	c
very	c
heavy	c
because	c
we	c
have	c
to	c
carry	c
our	c
books	c
,	c
notebooks	c
,	c
atlases	c
and	c
dictionaries	c
all	c
day	c

It	i
is	c
what	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
change	c

I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
leave	c
my	c
books	c
at	c
school	c

There	c
's	c
always	c
much	c
to	c

Dear	c
:	i
Jane	c
Clark	c

Most	c
of	c
the	c
events	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
were	c
good	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
feel	c
that	c
the	c
festival	c
could	c
be	c
even	c
better	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
feel	c
the	c
word	c
of	i
"	c
International	c
"	c
was	c
not	c
really	c
suit	i
;	c
because	c
you	c
just	i
only	c
got	i
six	c
countrie	i
's	i
stars	c
and	c
artists	c
came	i
.	c

And	c
the	c
offer	c
of	c
"	i
weedend	i
ticket	c
"	c
was	c
an	c
excellent	c
idea	c
.	c

Then	c
Sara	c
looked	c
down	i
the	c
river	c
.	c

She	c
was	c
very	c
scared	c
.	c

After	c
a	c
few	c
second	i
,	c
Sara	c
felt	c
that	c
golden	i
fish	c
was	c
lovely	c
.	c

Sara.	c

look	c
at	c
me.	c

This	c
story	c
happened	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
ago	c
.	c

Dear	c
Jane	c
Clark	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
about	c
International	i
Arts	c
Festival	c
which	i
I	c
went	c
to	c
recently	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
be	c
grateful	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
consider	c
my	c
opinion	c
above	i
,	i

Dear	c
Ms.	c
Ryan	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
in	c
response	c
to	c
the	c
letter	c
,	c
which	c
I	c
had	i
yesterday	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
be	i
appreciate	c
if	i
I	c
could	c
stay	c
in	c
log	c
cabins	c
at	c
Camp	c
.	c

I	c
feel	c
that	c
it	i
would	c
be	c
fabulos	i
places	c
with	c
western	i
design	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
try	c
both	c
of	c
them	c
.	c

As	c
well	c
as	c
that	c
,	c
I	c
wonder	c
if	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
some	c
money	c
for	c
extra	c
activities	c
and	c
few	i
more	c
things	c
.	i

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
time	i
and	c
attention	c

There	c
was	c
a	c
meeting	c
to	c
talk	c
about	c
a	c
video	c
about	c
daily	c
life	c
at	c
our	c
school	c
.	c

There	c
seems	c
to	c
be	c
a	c
general	c
opinion	c
that	c
sports	c
,	c
art	c
and	c
music	c
activities	c
such	c
as	c
tennis	c
,	c
football	c
,	c
orchestra	c
,	c
painting	c
,	c
photography	i
should	c
be	c
included	c
.	c

It	c
can	c
show	c
how	c
much	c
students	c
are	i
enjoying	i
their	c
life	c
in	c
our	c
school	c
.	c

Dear	c
Jane	c
Clark	c
,	c

Whereas	c
an	i
advertisement	c
promised	c
stars	c
from	c
around	c
the	c
world	c
.	c

Although	c
,	c
some	c
concert	c
halls	c
were	c
too	c
small	c
for	c
all	c
the	c
guests	c
of	c
the	c
festival	c
.	c

Another	c
disadvatage	i
of	c
the	c
festival	c
's	c
programme	c
was	c
lack	i
of	c
plays	c
and	c
films	c
which	c
are	c
the	c
best	c
to	i
display	c
the	i
modern	c
county	i
's	i
culture	c
.	i

All	c
the	c
guests	c
were	c
offered	c
a	c
weekend	c
ticket	c
for	c
all	c
events	c
.	c

That	c
was	c
an	c
excellent	c
decision	c
as	c
all	c
the	c
events	c
started	c
at	c
different	c
time	i
and	c
there	c
was	i
plenty	c
of	c
them	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
reasonable-priced	i
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
kind	c
attention	c
.	c

Sincerely	c
yours	c
,	c

Everybody	c
wants	c
to	c
earn	c
a	c
bit	c
of	c
money	c
.	c

Especially	c
young	c
people	c
who	c
are	c
always	c
out	i
of	i
their	c
small	c
budget	c
.	c

It	c
mean	i
that	c
a	c
job	c
should	c
be	c
part-time	c
.	c

This	c
job	c
does	c
n't	c
demand	c
much	c
abilities	i
,	c
but	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
patience	c
though	c
.	c

Another	c
way	c
to	c
earn	c
some	c
money	c
is	c
to	c
work	c
as	c
a	c
waiter	c
after	c
classes	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
it	c
's	c
possible	c
to	c
work	c
abroad	c
during	c
a	c
holiday	c
.	c

There	c
are	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
people	c
not	c
willing	c
to	c
type	c
essays	c
and	c
reports	c
themselves	c
or	c
just	c
not	c
having	c
a	c
computer	c
.	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
there	c
is	c
no	c
problem	c
without	c
a	c
solution	c
and	c
if	c
you	c
are	c
an	c
active	c
and	c
broad-minded	c
person	c
,	c
you	c
will	c
surely	c
find	c
a	c
way	c
to	c
earn	c
money	c
even	c
in	c
Arctic	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
happy	c
to	c
have	c
won	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
now	i
more	c
information	c
about	c
clothes	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
child	i
does	c
not	c
like	c
shopping	c
because	c
he	c
often	c
waits	i
,	c
and	c
I	c
prefer	c
to	c
play	c
with	c
these	i
friends	i
.	c

To	c
conclude	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
"	c
Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
"	c
is	c
a	c
true	c
statement	c
,	c
but	c
not	c
always	c
for	c
all	c
people	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
the	c
attractions	i
were	i
beautiful	i
such	i
as	i
shows	i
,	i
exhibitions	i
and	i
concerts	i
.	c

I	c
liked	c
all	c
the	c
different	c
kind	i
of	c
atmosphere	c
.	c

Also	c
,	c
for	c
all	c
these	c
attractions	c
,	c
the	c
price	c
was	c
low	c
and	c
it	i
is	c
important	c
for	c
the	i
big	c
family	c
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
an	c
unforgetable	i
time	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
eat	c
some	c
different	c
kind	c
of	c
foods	i
,	c
if	c
it	i
is	c
possible	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Your	i
sincerely	c

We	c
have	c
to	c
wash	c
the	c
board	c
when	c
it	c
's	c
our	c
turn	c
.	c

I	c
know	c
that	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
ask	c
at	i
my	c
Mum	c
or	c
Dad	c
for	i
going	c
by	i
my	c
friend	c
after	c
the	i
lessons	i
.	c

See	c
you	c
soon	c
,	c
bye	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madame	i
,	c

I	c
was	c
on	c
week	i
's	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
and	c
I	c
went	c
there	i
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
to	c
see	c
"	c
Over	c
The	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
I	i
expected	c
to	c
see	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
saw	c
different	i
actor	c
and	c
that	c
was	c
big	i
disappointment	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

Out	i
the	c
end	c
your	i
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
from	i
unknown	c
reasons	c
,	c
but	c
on	i
an	i
advertisement	c
was	i
clearly	c
sign	i
:	c

"	c
Visit	c
our	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
"	c
.	c

That	c
was	c
cruel	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
haungry	i
after	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

At	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
this	c
letter	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
if	c
you	c
can	c
refund	c
my	c
money	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfuly	i

Modern	c
technology	c
makes	c
our	c
lives	c
different	c
,	c
maybe	c
better	c
.	c

Useful	c
things	c
like	c
TV	c
sets	c
,	c
radios	c
,	c
computers	c
,	c
Hi-Fi	i
stereos	c
and	c
cars	c
-	c
we	c
are	c
dealing	c
with	c
them	c
every	c
day	c
.	c

I	c
waited	c
quite	i
one	c
hour	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
and	c
what	c
happened	c
with	c
the	c
actor	c
?	c

Where	c
were	c
the	c
discounts	c
that	c
I	c
should	c
have	c
earned	i
?	c

I	c
was	c
totaly	i
unsatisfied	c
with	c
the	c
theatre	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
have	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
if	c
it	i
's	i
possible	c
.	c

I	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
read	i
my	c
letter	c
,	i
I	c
hope	c
you	c
write	c
for	i
me	i
back	i
,	c
and	c
do	c
n't	c
forget	c
my	c
money	c
!	c

As	c
we	c
see	c
the	i
clothes	i
are	c
changing	c
every	c
hour	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
difficult	c
to	c
say	c
how	c
people	c
will	c
be	c
wearing	c
clothes	c
100	c
years	c
from	c
now	c
.	c

Dear	c
misses	i
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
'm	c
surprised	c
to	c
read	c
that	c
I	c
've	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
.	c

What	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
should	c
I	c
bring	c
with	c
me	c
?	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
hearing	i
news	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

What	c
are	i
we	i
doing	i
then	c
?	c

We	c
go	c
shopping	c
.	c

I	c
suggest	i
and	c
we	c
went	c
shopping	c
.	c

You	i
ca	i
n't	i
be	i
carefull	i
because	i
you	i
do	i
n't	i
know	i
what	i
time	i
it	i
will	i
happens	i
.	c

Dear	c
Ms.	c
Ryan	c
,	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
very	c
pleasant	c
surprise	c
to	c
win	c
a	c
trip	c
to	c
California	c
and	c
I	c
very	c
much	c
appreciate	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
'll	c
have	c
to	c
pass	i
several	c
exams	c
in	c
June	c
,	i
in	i
August	c
my	c
family	c
going	i
to	c
visit	c
our	c
relatives	c
in	c
Austria	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
not	c
so	c
keen	c
about	c
accomotation	i
but	c
would	c
rather	c
stay	c
in	c
tents	c
than	c
cabins	c
.	c

Far	i
the	c
best	c
swimmer	c
in	c
my	c
school	c
.	c

The	c
other	c
subject	c
is	c
photography	c
.	c

Finally	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
some	c
questions	c
.	c

How	c
much	c
money	c
should	c
I	c
take	c
,	i
will	i
it	i
be	c
any	c
guided	c
tours	c
?	c

And	c
how	c
many	c
will	c
be	c
in	i
Camp	i
in	c
July	c
?	c

It	c
seems	c
that	c
going	c
shopping	c
is	c
a	c
sense	i
of	i
living	i
.	c

People	c
are	c
normally	c
angry	c
after	c
shopping	c
-	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
so	c
easy	c
to	c
get	c
tied	i
.	c

Try	c
to	c
give	c
up	c
shopping	c
one	c
day	c
and	c
try	c
to	c
spend	c
your	c
day	c
with	c
friends	c
going	i
to	c
play	i
something	c
together	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
so	c
happy	c
to	c
received	i
your	c
letter	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
tell	i
you	c
the	c
information	c
you	c
need	c
.	c

The	c
lessons	c
we	c
take	i
in	c
the	c
video	c
,	i
should	c
be	c
the	c
main	c
subject	c
we	c
study	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
video	c
I	c
think	c
we	c
should	c
take	c
part	i
to	c
talk	c
about	c
,	i
what	c
we	c
doing	i
in	c
feel	i
time	c
and	c
study	c
period	i
.	c

This	c
is	c
another	c
important	c
part	c
of	c
our	c
school	c
life	c
,	c
and	c
we	c
should	c
make	i
a	c
section	c
to	i
talk	i
about	c
lunch	c
and	c
where	i
are	i
the	i
people	i
go	i
to	i
eat	i
their	i
lunch	i
or	i
what	i
they	i
do	i
?	i

After	c
we	c
talk	c
about	c
lunch	c
,	c
we	c
should	c
take	i
about	c
activities	i
we	c
are	c
doing	c
and	c
the	i
systems	i
about	i
the	i
activities	i
in	i
school	i
or	i
outside	i
school	i
and	i
make	i
a	i
little	i
section	i
of	i
the	i
School	i
term	i
,	i
and	i
what	i
kind	i
of	i
sport	i
the	i
people	i
like	i
the	i
most	i
.	c

Dear	c
Jane	c
Clark	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
great	i
idea	c
to	c
have	c
a	i
this	c
kind	c
of	c
festival	c
.	c

Firstly	c
.	c

Otherwise	c
,	c
the	c
price	c
was	c
really	c
reasonable	c
for	c
all	c
:events	i
the	i
weekend	i
.	c

I	c
was	c
satisfied	c
with	c
that	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
the	c
next	c
one	c
will	c
be	c
better	c
.	c

Dear	c
Lula	c

Hello	c
.	c

Also	c
our	c
hair	i
style	i
was	c
the	c
same	c
as	i
everyone	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
not	c
allowed	c
to	c
sleep	c
at	c
my	c
friend	c
's	c
house	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
glad	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
more	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
getting	c
your	c
letter	c
soon	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
.	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

It	c
would	c
be	c
nice	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
chance	c
to	c
try	c
new	i
sport	c
when	c
we	c
are	c
relaxed	c
.	c

I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
about	c
what	c
clothes	c
we	c
need	c
,	c
what	c
the	c
weather	c
is	c
like	c
and	c
whether	c
we	c
need	c
some	c
spending	c
money	c
or	c
not	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
going	c
on	c
this	c
fantastic	c
holiday	c
.	c

But	c
as	c
you	c
know	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
so	c
busy	c
that	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
write	c
earlier	c
.	c

I	c
thought	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
the	c
last	c
thing	c
I	c
wanted	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
.	c

I	c
've	c
really	c
enjoyed	c
this	c
opportunity	c
.	c

We	c
delivered	c
so	c
many	c
fantastic	c
and	c
gorgeous	c
costumes	c
which	c
had	c
been	c
designed	c
exclusively	c
by	c
top	c
designers	c
.	c

We	c
also	c
helped	c
to	c
make	c
posters	c
and	c
leaflets	c
,	c
which	c
I	c
enjoyed	c
most	c
as	c
I	c
always	c
like	c
drawing	c
and	c
designing	c
.	c

The	c
most	c
difficult	c
work	c
was	c
to	c
arrange	c
coach	i
trip	c
to	c
the	c
concert	c
hall	c
as	c
there	c
were	c
many	c
audience	i
from	c
countryside	i
.	c

But	c
the	c
rest	c
of	c
the	c
preparation	c
was	c
so	c
good	c
.	c

They	c
were	c
so	c
kind	c
and	c
modest	c
.	c

Do	c
you	c
know	c
what	c
I	c
liked	c
most	c
from	i
this	c
experience	c
?	c

I	i
've	i
found	i
pop	c
music	c
so	c
wonderful	c
,	c
it	c
changed	c
my	c
idea	i
of	i
that	c
classic	i
music	c
is	c
always	c
best	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
in	c
response	c
to	c
your	c
advertisment	i
in	c
Today	i
's	i
newspaper	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
really	i
a	i
good	c
idea	c
to	c
organize	c
a	c
festival	c
containing	c
such	c
different	c
shows	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
to	c
this	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
wondering	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
organize	c
the	c
same	c
festival	c
in	c
sommer	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
in	c
the	c
near	c
future	c
.	c

That	c
year	c
,	c
the	c
winter	c
in	c
France	c
was	c
very	c
cold	c
.	c

Alex	c
suggested	c
that	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
good	c
idea	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
city	c
to	c
buy	c
that	c
present	c
.	c

Daniela	c
agreed	c
but	c
she	c
knew	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
snowing	c
and	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
dangerous	c
to	c
walk	c
with	i
this	c
kind	c
of	c
weather	c
.	c

Anyway	c
,	c
Alex	c
was	c
too	c
stubborn	c
to	c
give	c
up	c
and	c
it	c
was	c
like	c
talking	c
to	c
a	c
brick	c
wall	c
:	c
she	c
did	c
n't	c
listen	c
to	c
her	c
sister	c
.	c

After	c
forty	c
minutes	c
,	c
the	c
weather	c
became	c
very	c
bad	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
the	c
prize	c
at	i
camp	c
California	c
in	c
America	c
.	c

This	c
is	c
because	c
my	c
A-levels	i
exams	c
is	i
coming	c
up	c
so	c
I	c
really	c
need	c
times	i
to	c
revise	c
,	c
and	c
July	c
is	c
the	c
only	c
month	i
and	i
time	i
that	c
I	c
am	c
free	c
.	c

An	i
accommodation	c
,	c
I	c
prefer	i
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
never	c
ever	c
stayed	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
before	c
but	c
some	c
of	c
the	c
people	c
I	c
know	c
said	c
that	c
it	c
is	c
fun	c
and	c
much	c
more	c
exiting	i
.	c

Once	i
I	c
used	c
to	c
take	c
a	c
photography	c
course	c
at	c
my	c
school	c
and	c
my	c
teacher	c
taught	c
me	c
well	c
about	c
taking	c
photo	i
.	c

Please	c
,	c
give	c
me	c
a	i
suggestion	i
about	c
these	c
.	i

I	c
have	c
written	c
to	c
you	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
about	c
the	c
greatest	c
experience	c
that	c
I	c
ever	i
have	i
.	c

Last	c
week	c
I	c
offered	c
myself	i
to	c
help	c
the	c
others	c
at	c
the	c
concert	c
and	c
it	c
was	c
amazing	c
.	c

There	c
were	c
so	c
many	c
youngsters	c
at	c
the	c
concert	c
,	c
but	c
because	c
I	c
was	c
the	c
youngest	c
in	c
a	i
helping	i
team	c
so	i
I	c
guess	c
that	c
I	c
was	c
the	c
luckiest	c
at	c
that	c
moment	c
.	c

A	i
concert	c
did	i
very	c
well	c
and	c
I	c
enjoyed	c
it	c
so	c
much	c
.	c

Later	c
on	c
the	c
band	c
took	c
a	c
break	c
for	c
ten	c
or	c
fifteen	c
minutes	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
served	c
them	c
with	c
glasses	c
of	c
fizzy	c
drink	c
and	c
chocolate	c
bars	c
,	c
biscuits	c
and	c
sandwiches	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
the	i
enjoyable	c
time	c
in	c
my	c
life	c
and	c
wished	i
that	c
you	c
were	c
there	c
with	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
because	c
I	c
was	c
n't	c
pleased	c
with	c
the	c
show	c
!	c

First	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
disappointed	c
about	c
the	c
price	c
of	c
the	c
ticket	c
because	c
I	c
expected	c
to	c
pay	c
a	c
smaller	i
pice	i
than	c
£	c
20	c
for	c
my	c
six	i
year	i
old	i
daughter	c
.	c

The	c
secret	c

One	c
day	c
her	c
best	c
friend	c
Sally	c
told	c
her	c
that	c
she	c
had	c
betrayed	c
her	c
boyfriend	c
.	c

Pat	c
really	c
liked	c
chatting	c
about	c
others	c
and	c
so	c
she	c
was	c
n't	c
able	c
to	c
keep	c
quiet	c
about	c
Sally	c
's	c
secret	c
.	c

She	c
told	c
it	c
to	c
her	c
boyfriend	c
Paul	c
.	c

After	c
that	c
Paul	c
got	i
white	c
in	c
his	i
face	c
,	c
he	c
was	c
pale	c
like	c
a	c
wall	c
and	c
it	c
seemed	c
as	i
he	c
would	i
be	i
very	c
nervous	c
.	c

I	c
visited	c
the	c
festival	c
for	c
2	c
days	c
.	c

I	c
also	c
read	c
an	c
advertisement	c
in	c
"	c
The	c
Times	c
"	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
visited	c
the	c
festival	c
,	c
of	c
course	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
really	c
good	c
.	c

The	c
ticket	c
price	c
was	c
not	c
too	c
expensive	c
for	c
student	i
too	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
your	c
answer	c
.	c

I	c
earned	c
easily	c
and	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
control	c
myself	c
at	c
that	c
time	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
made	c
brochure	i
for	c
a	c
company	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
in	c
high	c
school	c
.	c

I	c
forgot	c
many	c
skills	c
and	c
knowledge	c
during	c
the	c
time	c
.	c

So	c
lose	i
was	c
bigger	c
than	c
profit	i
.	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
answer	c
your	c
question	c
about	c
rules	i
in	c
my	c
life	c
,	c
at	c
school	c
and	c
at	c
home	c
.	c

Our	c
teachers	c
are	c
very	c
strick	i
,	c
we	c
have	c
to	c
stand	c
up	c
as	c
they	c
come	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Ryan	c

I	c
think	c
a	c
tent	c
would	c
suit	c
my	c
personal	c
life-style	i
better	c
than	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
because	c
I	c
love	c
the	i
nature	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
played	c
golf	c
in	c
my	c
life	c
but	i
with	c
your	c
help	c
I	c
would	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
learn	c
how	c
to	c
play	c
golf	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
this	c
could	c
be	c
very	c
interesting	c
.	c

I	c
also	i
would	i
like	c
to	c
know	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
will	c
get	c
from	c
you	c
for	c
those	i
two	c
weeks	c
because	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
spend	c
some	c
money	c
for	i
clothes	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

At	c
first	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
clean	c
the	c
three	c
private	c
rooms	c
of	c
the	c
stars	c
.	c

These	c
two	c
people	c
are	c
stars	c
in	c
our	c
country	c
...	c

I	c
will	c
never	c
ever	c
help	c
anybody	c
to	c
organice	i
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
.	i

I	c
think	c
you	c
know	c
his	c
popular	c
songs	c
like	c
"	c
My	c
Name	c
Is	c
"	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
greatest	c
moments	c
in	c
my	c
life	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
to	c
bring	i
him	c
something	c
to	c
eat	c
.	c

You	c
should	c
try	c
to	c
called	i
some	c
experience	c
during	i
such	c
a	c
concert	i
you	i
would	c
not	c
regret	c
it	c
.	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
have	c
just	c
read	c
your	c
letter	c
and	c
it	i
would	c
be	c
grateful	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
give	c
me	c
more	c
information	c
about	c
the	c
two	c
weeks	c
at	c
camp	c
California	c
in	c
the	c
USA	c
.	c

As	c
I	c
said	c
before	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
playing	c
tennis	c
for	c
four	c
years	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
sorry	c
I	c
have	c
n't	c
written	c
to	c
you	c
before	c
but	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
very	c
busy	c
helping	c
at	c
Mano''s	i
concert	c
.	c

Well	c
,	c
my	c
dream	c
come	i
true	c
.	c

All	i
started	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
in	i
Drama	c
Club	c
and	c
my	c
singing	c
teacher	c
told	c
me	c
that	c
Mano''s	i
group	c
were	c
going	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
concert	c
here	c
,	c
in	c
Argentina	c
.	c

You	c
know	c
that	c
last	c
year	c
I	c
organise	i
the	c
lights	c
in	i
our	c
performance	c
.	c

I	c
will	c
never	c
forget	c
that	c
wonderful	c
experience	c
.	c

This	i
really	i
help	i
me	c
for	c
our	c
next	c
performance	c
in	i
the	c
Drama	c
Club	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
thank	c
for	i
the	c
letter	c
with	c
the	c
result	c
of	c
the	c
competition	c
and	c
also	c
to	c
ask	c
some	c
questions	c
.	c

I	c
can	c
say	c
I	c
am	c
good	c
at	c
swimming	c
,	c
because	c
in	c
the	c
club	c
I	c
used	c
to	c
be	c
the	i
first	c
in	c
all	c
the	c
competitions	c
and	c
climbing	i
I	c
used	c
to	c
climb	c
trees	c
,	c
walls	c
everything	i
in	c
my	c
childhood	c
without	c
falling	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
just	c
writing	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
about	c
my	c
experience	c
about	i
helping	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
you	c
have	i
the	c
unique	c
opportunity	c
to	c
take	i
pictures	i
with	i
them	c
,	c
to	c
have	c
their	c
names	c
written	c
,	i
on	c
your	c
notebook	c
by	c
themselves	i
.	c

Do	c
n't	c
worry	c
because	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
pay	c
your	i
ticket	c
it	i
is	c
"	c
free	c
"	c
.	c

From	c
my	c
point	c
of	c
view	c
,	c
there	c
were	c
not	i
disadvantages	c

Lots	c
of	c
Love	c

XXXXX	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c

I	c
am	i
glad	c
to	c
hear	c
from	c
you	c
recently	c
and	c
I	c
really	c
appreciate	c
your	c
invitation	c
to	c
California	c
.	c

When	c
it	c
comes	c
to	c
activities	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
try	c
climbing	c
and	c
surfing	c
.	c

Finaly	i
,	c
I	c
must	c
choose	c
traveling	i
there	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
not	c
allowed	c
to	c
take	c
holidays	c
in	c
other	c
months	c
due	c
to	c
my	c
work	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
your	c
time	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
visiting	c
there	c
.	c

Needless	c
to	c
say	c
,	c
shopping	c
can	c
cause	c
you	c
a	c
waste	c
of	c
time	c
and	c
money	c
.	c

However	c
some	i
people	c
might	c
be	c
opposed	c
to	c
this	c
general	c
understanding	c
because	c
they	c
believe	c
that	c
they	c
can	c
find	c
shopping	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

And	c
shopping	c
is	c
also	c
a	c
difficult	c
hobby	c
to	c
go	c
along	c
with	c
your	c
friends	c
or	c
your	c
pertners	i
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
in	c
our	c
opinion	c
,	c
this	c
travel	i
is	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
very	c
interesting	c
for	c
us	c
.	c

The	c
show	c
is	c
free	c
,	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
only	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
14th	c
of	c
March	c
.	c

Thinking	c
about	c
the	c
media	c
's	c
treatment	c
of	c
famous	c
people	c
,	c
I	c
've	c
realised	c
of	i
some	c
things	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
if	c
the	c
media	i
's	i
are	c
acting	c
in	c
that	c
way	c
is	i
because	c
of	c
the	i
society	c
.	c

But	c
in	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
before	c
you	c
get	c
famous	c
you	c
know	c
which	i
are	c
the	c
consequences	c
.	c

As	c
in	c
another	c
you	i
may	c
know	c
what	c
could	c
happen	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
you	c
this	c
letter	c
to	c
complain	i
about	c
you	i
have	c
organized	c
us	i
for	c
our	c
trip	c
to	c
London	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
activity	c
programme	c
.	c

We	c
know	c
that	c
you	c
have	c
planned	c
a	c
very	c
complete	c
programme	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
considering	c
our	c
petition	i
.	c

But	c
I	c
'm	c
sure	c
that	c
all	c
these	c
things	c
can	i
not	i
give	c
them	c
back	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
most	c
needed	c
things	c
:	c
a	c
private	c
life	c
.	c

So	c
now	c
,	c
all	c
we	c
should	c
have	c
to	c
ask	c
ourselves	c
is	c
if	c
their	c
damaged	i
lifestyles	i
is	c
in	c
part	c
our	c
fault	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
really	c
good	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
feel	c
it	c
could	c
be	c
better	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
:	c

Dear	c
Jacob	c
:	c

I	c
hope	c
everything	c
is	c
ok	c
.	c

We	c
should	c
keep	c
in	c
touch	c
with	c
each	c
other	c
,	c
because	c
you	c
know	c
I	c
'm	c
very	c
happy	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
friend	c
like	c
you	c
.	c

In	c
your	c
last	c
letter	c
you	c
asked	c
me	c
something	c
about	c
our	c
rules	c
,	c
both	c
at	c
home	c
and	c
at	c
school	c
in	c
my	c
country	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
fail	c
three	c
subjects	c
in	c
your	c
exam	c
,	c
you	c
will	c
be	c
kicked	c
out	c
of	c
school	c
.	c

Anyway	c
,	c
in	c
my	c
country	c
,	c
generally	c
,	c
children	c
are	c
free	c
at	c
home	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
also	c
depends	c
on	c
their	c
parents	c
.	c

For	c
me	c
,	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
rules	c
at	c
home	c
,	i
just	i
do	c
n't	c
take	i
trouble	c
to	i
my	c
family	c
,	i
that	i
's	i
all	c
.	c

OK	i
,	i
just	i
here	i
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

yours	c
:	c

The	c
purpose	c
of	c
this	c
letter	c
is	c
to	c
congratulate	c
you	c
on	c
the	c
International	c
Arts	c
Fesival	i
I	c
attended	c
last	c
weekend	c
.	c

Firstly	c
I	i
would	c
like	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
that	c
the	c
idea	c
of	c
organizing	c
an	c
International	c
Arts	c
Festival	c
is	c
fantastic	c
,	c
but	c
in	c
your	c
advertisement	c
it	c
was	i
said	c
that	c
I	c
would	c
find	c
stars	c
and	c
artists	c
from	c
arround	i
the	c
world	c
,	c
when	c
,	c
in	c
fact	c
,	c
they	c
were	c
from	c
only	c
six	c
countries	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
understand	c
that	c
it	c
must	c
be	c
difficult	c
to	c
get	c
these	c
people	c
to	c
go	i
to	c
the	c
festival	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
nice	c
if	c
next	c
year	c
we	c
could	c
meet	c
other	i
personalities	c
.	c

Last	c
but	c
not	c
least	c
I	i
would	c
like	c
you	c
to	c
know	c
that	c
I	c
think	c
the	c
idea	c
of	c
the	c
weekend	c
ticket	c
for	c
all	c
events	c
was	c
excellent	c
because	c
in	c
the	c
end	c
it	c
was	c
cheaper	c
than	c
paying	c
for	c
each	c
event	c
separatelly	i
.	c

I	c
hope	c
to	c
hearing	i
from	c
you	c
soon	c

there	i
are	c
several	c
ways	c
to	c
earn	c
a	c
bit	c
of	c
money	c
in	c
your	c
spare	c
time	c
.	c

If	c
looking	c
after	c
children	c
does	c
n't	c
fit	i
you	c
,	c
you	c
can	c
try	c
with	i
pets	c
.	c

As	c
I	c
was	c
requested	c
I	c
should	c
choose	c
two	c
activities	c
from	c
the	c
list	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
choose	c
climbing	c
and	c
photography	c
.	c

Climbing	c
,	c
in	c
contrast	c
,	c
is	c
something	c
I	c
started	c
few	i
months	c
ago	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
have	c
not	c
gained	c
any	c
success	c
in	c
this	c
sport	c
.	c

But	c
you	c
could	c
give	c
me	c
a	c
chance	c
to	c
get	c
more	c
familier	i
with	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
about	c
clothes	c
.	c

You	c
might	c
spend	c
too	c
much	c
money	c
and	c
buy	c
something	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
really	c
need	c
.	c

You	c
could	c
also	c
buy	c
something	c
which	c
later	c
turns	c
out	c
to	c
be	c
out	i
of	i
order	i
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
you	c
could	c
face	c
an	c
agressive	i
and	c
maybe	c
even	c
drunk	c
shop	c
assistant	c
or	c
manager	c
.	c

You	c
are	c
happy	c
to	c
buy	c
a	c
dress	c
or	c
a	c
suit	c
for	c
a	c
good	c
price	c
.	c

So	c
if	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
want	c
to	c
feel	c
deceived	c
or	c
offended	c
,	c
think	c
twice	c
before	c
you	c
decide	c
to	c
go	c
shopping	c
.	c

(	c
A	c
very	c
depressing	c
point	c
of	c
view	c
,	c
is	c
n't	c
it	c
?	c
)	c

Thank	c
you	c
a	i
lot	i
for	c
your	c
letter	c
,	i
I	c
am	c
very	c
happy	c
of	i
having	c
won	c
the	c
competition	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
exams	c
in	c
June	c
and	c
a	c
work	i
in	c
August	c
.	c

Yours	c
,	c

Brenda	c

Sir	c
Manager	c
,	c

My	c
name	c
is	c
Sandre	c
Atos	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
writting	i
to	c
you	c
because	c
this	i
last	c
weekend	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
,	i
you	c
manage	c
,	c
to	c
see	c
what	c
was	c
called	c
"	c
London	c
's	c
newest	c
and	c
best	c
musical	c
show	c
"	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
after	c
the	c
play	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
still	c
closed	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
told	c
that	c
I	c
would	c
have	c
a	c
perfect	c
evening	c
,	c
though	c
instead	c
of	c
that	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
terrible	c
one	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
since	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
child	c
I	c
have	c
noticed	c
that	c
except	i
for	c
the	c
medical	c
facilities	c
and	c
achievements	c
,	c
it	c
has	c
brought	c
to	i
me	c
more	c
disadvantages	c
than	c
advantages	c
.	c

Nowadays	c
,	c
I	c
barely	c
know	c
my	c
parents	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
do	c
know	c
exactly	c
what	c
is	c
happening	c
in	c
the	c
soap	c
operas	c
.	c

Besides	c
this	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
some	c
of	c
the	c
concert	c
halls	c
were	c
too	c
small	c
that	i
I	c
felt	c
very	c
uncomfortable	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
consider	c
these	c
pieces	i
of	i
suggestions	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
really	c
nice	c
to	c
hearing	i
from	c
you	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
we	c
will	c
learn	c
so	c
many	c
interesting	c
facts	c
from	c
each	c
other	c
.	c

At	c
home	c
it	c
is	c
the	c
other	c
way	c
about	i
.	c

I	c
must	c
admit	c
that	c
I	c
am	c
able	c
to	c
do	c
whatever	c
I	c
want	c
,	c
such	c
as	c
inviting	i
friends	c
,	i
watching	i
TV	c
until	c
midnight	c
and	c
so	c
on	c
.	c

That	c
is	c
all	c
!	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c

I	c
had	c
everythig	i
planned	c
,	i
I	i
and	i
my	i
family	i
where	i
coming	c
to	c
whatch	i
your	c
show	c
and	c
then	c
have	c
a	c
decent	c
meal	c
at	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
disasterous	i
.	c

Then	c
everything	c
was	c
going	c
well	c
untill	i
the	c
show	c
did	c
n't	c
start	c
!	c

Supposedly	c
it	c
was	c
to	c
start	c
at	c
19:30	i
well	i
it	c
did	c
n't	c
,	i
it	i
started	c
45	c
minutes	c
late	c
,	c
at	c
exactly	c
20:15	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
an	i
other	i
actor	c
I	i
had	c
never	c
heard	c
of	c
.	c

they	i
even	c
gave	c
us	c
a	c
table	c
number	c

What	c
kind	c
of	c
an	c
organasation	i
do	c
you	c
call	c
this	c
,	c
sir/madam	c
?	c

You	c
do	c
n't	c
understand	c
how	c
dissappointed	i
and	c
angry	c
I	c
was	c
that	c
night	c

The	c
Revealed	c
Secret	c

In	c
fact	c
he	c
was	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
main	i
busybodies	c
of	c
his	c
neighborhood	i
and	c
his	c
school	c
so	c
not	c
alot	i
of	c
people	c
in	c
his	c
school	c
liked	c
him	c
.	c

this	i
was	c
a	i
vary	i
bad	i
thing	i
about	i
Pat	i
's	i
school	i
and	i
also	i
for	i
Pat	i
.	c

This	c
whent	i
on	c
and	c
on	c
,	c
got	c
more	c
and	c
more	c
serious	c
but	i
it	c
was	c
so	c
secret	c
that	c
teachers	i
did	c
n't	c
notice	c
.	c

But	c
luckily	c
for	c
Pat	c
the	c
word	c
did	c
not	c
return	c
to	c
the	c
group	c
having	c
the	c
party	c
.	c

Everyone	c
in	c
the	c
year	c
was	c
anoyed	i
,	c
but	c
not	c
with	c
Pat	c
,	c
oh	c
,	c
no	c
!	c

With	c
the	c
group	c
having	c
the	c
party	c
.	c

No	c
one	c
could	c
do	c
anything	c
about	c
it	c
.	i

Everyone	c
was	c
drunk	c
and	c
they	c
simply	c
would	c
not	c
let	c
him	c
go	c
.	c

now	i
,	i

It	c
will	c
be	c
from	c
10.00	c
till	c
7.00pm	c
.	c

The	c
show	c
will	c
be	c
about	c
all	c
the	c
latest	c
fashion	i
,	c
leisure	c
and	c
sports	c
wear	c
,	c
make	i
up	i
and	c
hairstyles	c
.	c

We	c
would	c
also	c
not	c
have	c
to	c
worry	c
financially	c
as	c
it	c
is	c
free	c
for	c
students	c
.	c

We	c
can	c
however	i
go	i
and	c
look	c
around	c
the	c
shopping	c
mall	c
if	c
we	c
have	c
time	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

Lastly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
be	c
very	c
grateful	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
give	c
us	c
your	c
permission	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

We	c
might	c
even	c
be	c
using	c
voice	c
identification	c
and	c
fingerprints	c
instead	c
of	c
keys	c
.	c

We	c
might	c
still	c
favour	i
that	c
old	c
carpet	c
and	c
couch	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
future	c
,	c
every	c
child	c
might	c
have	c
a	c
laptop	c
.	c

And	c
instead	c
of	c
going	c
to	c
school	c
,	c
why	c
not	c
let	c
school	c
come	c
to	c
you	c
?	c

We	c
might	c
not	c
need	c
maids	c
to	c
do	c
housework	c
anymore	c
as	c
they	c
can	c
easily	c
be	c
replaced	c
with	c
a	c
robot	c
,	c
a	c
machine	c
,	c
or	c
something	c
other	i
with	c
the	c
same	c
purpose	c
.	c

This	c
is	c
because	c
people	c
wo	c
n't	c
miss	i
the	c
great	c
taste	c
of	c
food	i
although	i
it	c
could	c
be	c
subsituted	i
to	i
a	c
vitamin	c
pill	c
or	c
two	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
about	c
the	c
International	c
Arts	c
Festival	c
which	c
has	c
just	c
finished	c
.	c

I	c
congratulated	i
with	i
you	c
because	c
it	c
has	i
been	i
a	c
great	c
idea	c
since	i
the	c
town	c
needed	c
a	c
cultural	c
event	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
some	c
concert	c
halls	c
were	c
too	c
small	c
for	c
the	c
musical	c
performances	c
.	c

You	c
probably	c
did	c
not	c
expect	c
such	c
a	c
big	c
audience	c
!	c

Finally	c
,	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
make	c
a	i
really	c
international	c
festival	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
you	c
should	c
invite	c
artists	c
from	c
all	c
over	c
the	c
world	c
,	c
not	c
just	c
from	c
six	c
countries	c
like	c
this	c
year	c
.	c

16.12.00	c

However	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
dissapointment	i
,	i
when	c
I	c
realised	c
that	c
not	c
many	c
countries	c
were	c
attending	c
to	i
the	c
event	c
.	c

I	c
could	i
be	i
fine	i
if	i
I	i
had	i
seen	c
more	c
countries	c
from	c
all	c
around	c
the	c
world	c
,	c
for	c
instance	c
:	i
far	i
east	i
,	c
indonesia	i
etc	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
n't	c
complicated	i
to	c
find	c
the	c
right	c
hall	c
to	i
the	c
shows	c
,	c
I	c
should	i
say	c
it	c
was	c
very	c
well	c
organised	c
.	c

16.12.00	c

What	c
a	c
pitty	i
!	c

Did	i
you	c
like	c
it	c
more	c
than	c
the	c
previous	c
one	c
?	c

Anyway	c
it	i
think	c
that	c
's	c
it	c
for	c
now	c
.	c

Lots	c
of	c
Love	i

The	c
activities	c
that	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
do	c
:	c
First	i
one	c
it	i
would	c
be	c
basketball	c
and	c
to	c
be	c
honest	c
I	c
can	c
play	c
it	c
very	c
well	c
due	i
to	i
I	c
used	c
to	c
be	c
a	c
basketball	c
player	c
in	c
my	c
high	c
school	c
.	c

This	c
information	c
should	c
enough	i
for	c
you	c
but	c
if	c
you	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
more	c
about	c
anything	c
please	c
ask	c
me	c
and	c
do	c
not	c
hesitate	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
it	c
and	c
I	c
hope	c
seeing	i
you	c
during	i
this	c
summer	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
it	i
's	i
wasting	i
my	c
time	c
especially	i
when	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
find	c
the	c
thing	c
I	c
want	c
,	i
this	i
is	c
very	c
frustrating	c
.	c

Once	c
you	c
've	c
got	c
all	i
your	i
shopping	c
list	c
,	c
you	c
also	c
have	c
to	c
carry	c
all	c
the	c
bags	c
that	c
you	c
just	c
bought	c
which	i
is	i
very	c
heavy	c
sometime	i
.	c

The	c
activities	c
are	c
quite	c
hard	c
to	c
choose	c
really	c
,	c
because	c
you	c
have	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
chose	i
which	c
is	i
I	c
like	c
.	c

Photography	c
is	c
a	c
very	c
interesting	c
activitie	i
,	c
and	c
is	c
not	c
too	c
hard	c
to	c
do	c
too	i
.	c

Finally	c
I	i
hope	c
the	c
information	c
I	c
've	c
gave	i
are	i
useful	c
for	c
you	c
,	c
and	c
hope	c
you	c
can	c
answers	i
my	c
questions	c
A.S.A.P	c
.	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c

For	c
some	c
people	c
it	c
may	c
be	c
a	c
method	i
to	c
relax	c
themselves	i
,	c
after	c
you	c
have	c
been	c
to	c
work	c
or	c
school	c
.	c

So	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
thing	c
you	c
will	c
enjoy	c
most	c
of	c
the	c
time	c
,	c
but	c
still	c
have	i
something	i
you	i
will	i
not	i
enjoy	i
it	i
.	c

London	c
,	c
20th	c

2000	c

Besides	i
of	c
all	c
,	c
at	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
the	c
Musical	c
,	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	i
your	c
Theatre	c
Restaurant	c
,	c
in	c
order	c
of	i
taking	i
a	i
dinner	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
have	i
leaft	i
home	c
without	c
eating	c
and	c
so	c
I	c
was	c
hungry	c
at	c
that	c
time	c
.	c

Thus	i
,	c
you	c
can	i
n't	i
believe	c
what	i
was	i
my	i
disappointment	i
when	c
I	c
noted	i
that	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
,	c
without	i
no	i
explanation	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
say	i
you	c
that	c
I	c
am	c
asking	c
for	c
money	i
back	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
had	c
an	i
evening	i
totally	i
despleased	i
,	c
completely	c
different	c
that	i
you	c
have	i
anouced	i
in	c
your	c
advertisement	c
.	c

Nowadays	c
,	c
I	c
can	i
n't	i
stay	i
one	c
day	c
without	c
consulting	c
computers	i
communications	c
throught	i
e-mail	c
or	c
internet	i
.	c

My	c
life	c
would	c
n't	c
be	c
the	c
same	c
another	i
time	i
without	c
these	i
progress	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
as	i
a	i
reply	c
to	c
your	c
letter	c
,	i
congratulating	c
me	c
to	i
the	i
winning	c
of	i
the	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
and	c
inviting	c
me	c
to	c
the	i
Camp	c
California	c
in	c
the	c
U.S.A.	c
I	c
was	c
delighted	c
to	c
hear	c
from	c
you	c
and	c
am	c
already	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
spend	i
two	c
weeks	c
in	c
California	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
afraid	c
that	c
the	c
only	c
possible	c
time	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
travel	c
is	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
the	c
only	c
month	c
I	c
am	c
able	c
to	c
get	c
time	c
off	c
work	c
.	c

As	i
an	i
accomodation	i
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
sleeping	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
because	c
I	c
enjoy	c
the	c
closeness	c
to	c
the	i
nature	c
while	c
camping	c

Yours	c

Dear	c
Kim	c

My	i
job	i
was	i
it	i
,	i
to	c
help	c
to	c
keep	c
all	c
the	c
little	c
kids	c
out	c
of	c
the	c
backstage	c
area	c
.	c

Therefore	c
I	c
got	c
to	c
stay	c
backstage	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
and	c
to	c
see	c
all	c
the	c
members	c
of	c
the	c
"	c
Backstreet	c
Boys	c
"	c
.	c

I	c
sort	c
of	c
felt	c
,	i
like	c
I	c
had	c
done	c
my	c
part	c
to	c
make	c
the	c
concert	c
a	c
sucess	i
.	c

Do	c
you	c
know	c
,	i
what	c
I	c
mean	c
?	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
first	c
of	c
all	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
about	i
the	c
good	i
programme	c
that	c
you	c
give	i
us	c
about	i
the	c
trip	c
in	i
London	c
,	c
especially	c
for	c
planning	c
to	i
visit	i
the	c
science	c
museum	c
,	c
which	c
we	c
believe	c
is	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
very	c
interesting	c
.	c

We	c
were	c
thinking	c
that	c
meaby	i
we	c
can	c
go	c
early	c
to	c
visit	c
the	c
Science	c
Museum	c
and	c
than	i
go	c
to	c
the	c
Central	c
Exhibition	c
,	i
where	c
the	c
event	c
is	c
going	c
to	c
have	i
place	c
!	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
mutch	i
!	c

Anyway	c
,	c
this	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
necessary	i
a	c
problem	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
can	c
be	c
a	c
big	c
thing	c
for	c
the	c
famous	c
person	c
,	c
becouse	i
let	i
people	c
talking	c
about	c
him	c
and	c
increase	i
his	c
popularity	c
.	c

We	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
because	c
we	c
are	c
very	c
interested	c
in	c
art	c
and	c
fashion	c
.	c

Famous	c
people	c
,	c
such	c
as	c
politicians	c
and	c
film	c
stars	c
,	c
deserve	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
private	c
life	c
without	c
journalists	c
following	c
them	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
journalists	c
should	c
not	c
only	c
think	c
about	c
commercial	i
value	i
,	c
but	i
morality	c
and	c
priciples	i
are	i
also	i
being	i
concerned	c
.	c

Although	c
we	c
can	i
not	i
deny	c
it	c
is	c
our	c
nature	c
-	c
curious	i
,	i
we	c
can	c
improve	c
our	c
sence	i
of	c
morality	c
and	c
try	c
to	c
think	c
about	c
the	c
importance	c
of	c
privacy	c
for	c
them	c
.	c

We	c
have	c
received	c
the	c
programme	c
.	c

London	c
is	c
a	c
good	c
place	c
for	c
discovering	c
it	i
.	c

We	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
because	c
there	c
are	c
some	c
people	c
in	c
our	c
class	c
who	c
like	i
to	c
study	c
fashions	i
after	c
leaving	c
this	c
school	c
.	c

And	c
everyone	i
of	c
us	c
is	c
interested	c
in	c
fashions	c
and	c
clothes	c
!	c

This	c
exhibition	c
is	c
situated	c
in	c
Central	i
Exhibition	c
Hall	c
,	c
London	c
.	c

We	c
've	c
noticed	c
that	c
the	c
exhibition	c
will	c
be	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
,	c
14th	i
of	c
March	c
.	c

What	c
do	c
you	c
think	c
about	c
our	c
suggestion	c
?	c

In	c
your	c
letter	c
,	c
you	c
asked	c
me	c
wheter	i
the	c
book	c
I	c
've	c
read	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
suitable	c
present	c
for	c
your	c
cousin	c
's	c
fifteenth	c
birthday	c
.	c

Because	c
he	c
especially	i
concentrates	c
on	c
history	i
,	c
social	i
life	i
and	c
politic	i
situation	c
in	i
the	c
time	c
the	c
story	c
is	c
played	i
.	c

But	c
anyway	c
,	c
do	c
you	c
know	c
the	c
book	c
with	c
the	c
title	c
'	c
The	c
Best	c
Detective	c
Stories	c
of	c
Agatha	c
Christie	c
'	c
?	c

And	c
I	c
think	c
this	c
book	c
is	c
a	c
very	c
good	c
one	c
for	c
your	c
cousin	c
.	c

You	c
wrote	c
that	c
your	c
cousin	c
is	c
quite	c
intered	i
in	c
magic	c
,	c
detectives	c
and	c
sport	c
,	c
did	c
n't	c
you	c
?	c

Please	c
read	c
it	c
and	c
write	c
your	c
comments	c
.	c

See	c
you	c
soon	c
!	c

It	i
also	i
will	i
be	c
"	c
The	c
London	c
fashion	i
and	i
leisure	i
show	i
"	c
on	c
the	c
14th	c
of	c
March	c
,	c
which	c
consist	i
on	i
an	c
exhibition	c
of	c
the	c
latest	c
fashions	c
,	c
leisure	c
and	c
sports	c
wear	c

make	i
up	i
and	c

As	c
you	c
know	c
we	i
are	c
in	c
England	c
to	c
learn	c
your	c
language	c
and	c
also	c
your	i
lifestyle	c
,	c
and	c
we	c
thought	c
this	c
show	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
good	c
opportunity	c
for	c
us	c
to	c
discorve	i
this	c
way	i
of	c
your	c
country	c
!	c

Sincerely	c
,	c

It	c
's	c
a	c
perfect	c
combinaison	i
between	i
passion	c
and	c
life	i

Let	c
me	c

A	c
DAY	c
OF	i
MY	c
LIFE	c

It	c
was	c
dangerous	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
knew	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
.	c

That	c
day	c
,	c
I	c
got	c
up	c
early	c
because	c
I	c
had	c
n't	c
slept	c
very	c
well	c
.	c

I	c
checked	c
everything	c
again	c
and	c
again	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
afraid	c
of	i
doing	i
it	c
but	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
promised	c
her	c
to	i
find	i
a	i
money	c
for	c
her	c
operation	c
.	c

Despite	c
feeling	c
really	c
bad	c
I	c
left	c
home	c
.	c

I	c
told	c
everybody	c
to	c
lie	c
down	c
.	c

Before	c
I	c
took	c
money	i
one	c
of	c
the	c
cashier	i
had	c
pressed	c
a	c
button	c
to	c
call	c
a	i
police	c
.	c

I	c
quickly	c
left	c
bank	i
.	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
saw	c
the	c
advertisement	c
of	i
"	c
THE	c
LONDON	c
FASHION	c
AND	c
LEISURE	c
SHOW	c
"	c
in	c
the	c
newspaper	c
today	c
,	c
and	c
told	c
all	c
classmates	i
about	c
it	c
.	c

This	c
show	c
is	i
held	c
in	c
Central	i
Exhibition	c
Hall	c
,	c
London	c
on	c
Tue	c
.	c

Therefore	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
great	i
idea	c
to	c
visit	c
the	c
show	c
for	c
our	c
knowledgement	i
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
"	c
shopping	c
on	c
14	c
,	i
March	c
'	c
can	c
be	c
changed	c
to	c
15	c
,	i
March	c
instead	c
of	c
"	c
Free	c
time	c
"	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
that	c
you	c
would	i
give	c
us	c
an	c
opportunity	c
to	c
visit	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

Some	c
people	c
said	i
that	c
famous	c
people	c
such	c
as	c
politicians	c
,	c
and	c
film	c
stars	c
,	c
needs	i
to	c
have	c
a	c
private	c
life	c
without	c
journalists	c
following	c
them	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
most	c
people	c
might	i
remember	c
the	c
sad	c
story	c
of	c
"	c
Princess	c
Diana	c
"	i
she	i
died	c
in	c
Paris	c
few	i
years	c
ago	c
while	c
she	c
was	c
escaping	c
from	c
lots	c
of	c
journalists	c
called	c
"	c
Paparach	i
"	c
.	c

Additionally	c
,	c
some	c
concert	c
halls	c
were	c
too	c
small	c
to	c
relax	c
,	i
while	i
most	c
of	c
them	c
were	c
very	c
comfortable	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
there	c
were	i
a	c
lot	c
that	c
impressed	c
me	c
very	c
much	c
.	c

Sincerely	c
yours	c
,	c

Long	c
long	c
ago	c
,	c
there	c
lived	c
in	c
a	i
province	c
of	c
Bizen	c
in	c
Japan	c
an	c
old	c
woman	c
and	c
an	c
old	c
man	c
.	c

She	c
brought	i
it	c
to	c
her	c
house	c
,	c
cutting	c
it	c
with	i
her	c
husband	c
.	c

He	c
made	c
up	c
his	c
mind	c
to	c
defeat	c
them	c
,	c
and	c
asked	c
his	c
stepmother	c
for	c
some	c
kibidango	c
,	c
one	c
of	c
traditional	c
snacks	c
in	c
Japan	c
.	c

Having	c
eaten	c
the	c
kibidango	c
,	c
he	c
departed	c
for	c
Onigashima	c
with	c
three	c
friends	c
of	c
him	i
:	c
a	c
dog	c
,	c
a	c
monkey	c
and	c
a	c
bird	c

Dear	c
Madame	i

Daniel	c
Ortiz	c

I	c
have	c
heard	c
from	c
you	c
recently	c
and	c
I	c
'm	c
really	c
happy	c
,	c
I	c
hope	c
you	c
and	c
your	c
family	c
are	c
well	c
.	c

During	c
the	c
concert	c
I	c
listened	c
the	i
band	c
like	c
everybody	c
,	i
besides	c
I	c
earned	c
money	i
so	i
,	i
was	i
a	c
wonderful	c
experience	c
.	c

It	c
will	c
take	c
place	c
in	c
Central	i
Exhibition	c
Hall	c
,	c
in	c
London	c
,	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
14th	i
of	c
March	c
and	c
the	i
suitable	i
time	i
will	c
be	c
10.00	c
-	c
19.00	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
mention	c
that	c
this	i
day	c
we	c
are	c
going	c
to	c
visit	c
the	c
Science	c
Museum	c
in	c
the	c
morning	c
and	c
after	c
we	c
are	c
going	c
for	i
shopping	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
believe	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
a	c
good	c
change	i
for	c
all	c
of	c
us	c
to	c
attend	c
this	c
show	c
as	c
it	c
is	c
free	c
for	c
students	c
!	c

Really	c
interesting	c
!	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
it	i
will	i
be	i
a	i
great	i
opportunity	i
to	i
all	i
of	i
us	i
to	i
be	i
on	i
this	i
show	i
while	c
we	c
are	c
going	i
to	i
be	i
in	c
London	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
the	i
politicians	c
the	i
have	c
choosed	i
their	c
careers	c
,	i
they	c
must	c
know	c
that	c
they	i
are	i
going	i
to	i
involved	i
with	i
everything	i
that	i
it	i
has	i
to	i
do	i
with	i
publicity	i
and	i
their	i
country	i
and	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
is	i
that	c
they	c
have	c
to	c
realize	c
that	c
they	c
should	c
be	c
extremely	c
careful	c
of	i
their	c
movements	c
or	c
else	c
they	c
are	c
going	c
to	c
have	c
bad	i
reputation	c
,	c
and	c
they	c
will	c
be	i
not	i
trustworthy	i
.	c

You	c
must	c
control	c
your	c
behaviour	c
and	c
try	c
not	c
implove	i
so	c
much	c
yourself	c
.	c

Dear	c
Jane	c
Clark	c

I	c
felt	c
very	c
good	c
about	c
all	c
these	c
shows	c
.	c

Do	c
you	c
want	c
to	c
know	c
about	c
our	c
country	c
's	c
rules	c
?	c

like	c
when	c
the	c
class	c
starts	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
keep	c
quiet	c
and	c
you	c
ca	c
n't	c
say	c
anything	c
while	c
the	c
teacher	c
speaks	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
'm	c
very	c
glad	c
to	c
hear	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

In	c
other	c
words	c
,	c
what	c
they	c
will	c
introduce	i
,	i
is	c
most	i
interested	i
in	i
us	c
,	i
I	i
mean	i
it	i
's	i
conflict	i
with	c
your	c
plan	c
,	i
what	i
a	c
pity	c
!	c

Not	c
only	c
I	i
was	i
a	c
member	c
of	c
swimming	i
team	c
in	c
our	c
school	c
,	c
but	c
also	c
I	c
was	i
tought	i
by	c
my	c
father	c
since	c
I	c
was	c
five	c
years	c
old	c
,	i
So	c
I	c
would	i
understood	i
some	c
skills	c
and	c
how	i
to	c
protect	c
yourself	i
from	c
my	c
Dad	c
,	c
if	i
you	i
had	i
a	i
accident	i
.	c

One	c
day	c
,	c
I	c
passed	c
by	c
a	c
river	c
in	i
accident	i
,	i
I	c
saw	c
there	c
were	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
people	c
playing	c
in	c
the	c
river	c
.	c

Suddenly	c
,	c
I	c
heard	c
of	i
"	c
help	i
,	c
help	c
"	c
in	c
my	i
distance	c
.	c

In	c
a	c
while	i
,	c
lots	c
of	c
passed-by	i
crowed	i
to	i
the	c
river-side	i
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
jumped	c
into	c
the	c
river	c
,	i
I	c
really	i
knew	c
that	c
was	c
dangerous	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
have	i
n't	i
think	c
about	c
anything	c
except	c
"	i
justify	i
"	i
this	i
word	i
.	c

You	c
could	c
have	c
let	c
us	c
get	c
used	i
to	i
more	c
cultures	c
by	c
inviting	c
from	i
some	c
other	c
countries	c
too	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
could	c
hardly	c
participated	i
in	i
all	c
of	c
the	c
concerts	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
really	c
a	c
reasonably-priced	i
weekend	c
for	c
me	c
,	c
but	c
you	c
should	c
also	c
recognise	i
new	c
activities	c
like	c
competitions	c
on	i
singing	c
songs	c
,	i
drawing	i
a	c
portrate	i
next	c
year	c
.	c

Then	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
excellent	c
.	c

Dear	c
Ana	c
,	c

Everywhere	c
and	c
everytime	i
in	c
our	c
lives	c
we	c
face	i
with	c
the	i
rules	c
.	c

Contrary	i
there	c
are	c
other	c
rules	c
which	c
annoy	c
us	c
like	c
the	c
clothing	i
ones	i
.	c

You	c
should	c
wear	c
the	c
same	c
things	c
every	c
time	c
,	c
no	c
changes	c
and	c
alternations	c
are	c
allowed	c
.	c

It	c
makes	c
us	c
like	c
robots	c
and	c
feel	i
bad	c
psychologically	c
,	c
because	c
we	c
want	c
to	c
be	c
different	c
and	c
free	c
in	c
wearing	i
.	c

Also	c
the	c
attendance	c
rules	c
put	c
a	c
strain	c
on	c
us	c
.	c

They	c
do	c
n't	c
care	c
if	c
we	c
have	c
problems	c
,	c
exams	c
to	c
study	c
or	i
if	c
we	c
are	c
ill	c
.	c

They	c
are	c
against	c
democracy	c
I	c
think	c
.	c

Anyway	c
hope	c
to	c
hear	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

With	c
all	c
my	c
love	c
,	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
coffe	i
after	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
but	c
when	c
I	c
tried	c
to	c
get	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

A	c
police	c
officer	c
who	c
was	c
there	c
told	c
me	c
that	c
the	c
manager	c
of	c
the	c
restaurant	c
was	c
ill	c
and	c
that	c
he	c
did	i
n't	i
allowed	i
anyone	c
to	c
open	c
it	c
.	c

For	c
all	c
that	i
reasons	c
,	c
I	c
want	c
you	c
to	c
refund	c
the	c
cost	c
of	c
the	c
tickets	c
and	c
to	c
send	c
the	c
money	c
back	i
to	c
my	c
house	c
.	c

Some	c
of	c
them	c
were	c
in	c
charge	c
of	c
bringing	c
music	c
.	c

Ballons	i
and	c
coloured	c
lights	c
were	c
put	c
in	c
all	c
the	c
trees	c
.	c

A	c
table	c
was	c
laid	c
with	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
delightful	i
food	c
and	c
a	c
beautiful	c
cake	c
was	c
in	c
the	c
centre	c
of	c
it	c
.	c

The	c
children	c
were	c
very	c
enthusiastic	c
because	c
they	c
thought	c
that	c
Maria	c
was	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
very	c
happy	c
with	c
this	c
surprise	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
all	c
the	c
details	c
that	c
you	c
need	c
from	c
me	c
.	c

According	c
to	c
your	c
letter	c
,	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
take	c
part	c
in	c
two	c
activities	c
at	c
the	c
Camp	c
.	c

If	c
the	c
answer	c
is	c
yes	c
,	c
could	c
you	c
tell	c
me	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
will	c
need	c
to	c
take	c
with	c
me	c

nice	c
for	c
my	i
relaxing	c
and	c
I	c
can	c
do	c
exercise	c
for	c
a	c
long	c

Do	i

My	c

Do	c

Bye	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c

An	i
especiall	i
invitation	c

Although	c
my	c
parents	c
were	c
very	c
happy	c
of	i
having	c
such	c
an	i
especial	i
opportunity	c
visiting	i
a	c
place	c
with	c
no	c
tourists	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
little	c
bit	c
scared	c
.	c

In	c
this	c
country	c
my	c
parents	c
used	c
to	c
buy	c
water	c
in	c
bottles	c
to	c
have	c
it	c
clean	c
,	c
but	c
in	c
the	c
little	c
town	c
we	c
did	c
n't	c
had	i
this	i
possibility	i
and	c
the	c
family	c
where	c
we	c
were	c
staying	c
with	i
,	i
kindly	c
boiled	c
the	c
water	c
for	c
us	c
.	c

We	c
spent	c
2	c
weeks	c
with	c
the	c
family	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
was	c
the	c
water	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Ryan	c

Now	c
I	c
can	c
realize	c
one	c
of	c
my	c
dream	i
.	c

I	c
can	c
do	c
two	c
activities	c
during	c
my	c
stay	c
at	c
the	c
camp	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
a	c
good	c
level	c
in	i
swimming	c
and	c
I	c
have	i
done	i
some	c
competitions	c
last	c
year	c
which	c
I	c
have	i
won	i
.	c

You	c
could	c
speak	c
to	c
them	c
and	c
you	c
could	c
see	c
that	c
a	c
lot	c
were	c
very	c
cool	c
and	c
the	c
other	c
ones	c
were	c
still	i
in	i
the	i
sky	i
.	c

I	c
did	c
n't	c
regret	c
it	c
and	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
again	c
!	c

It	c
was	c
absolutely	i
great	c
idea	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
give	c
some	c
suggestions	c
for	c
next	c
year	c
as	c
I	c
have	c
read	c
the	c
advertisement	c
.	c

Thirdly	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
expecting	c
to	c
watch	c
more	c
films	c
and	c
plays	c
which	i
were	c
impressive	c
.	c

Lastly	c
,	c
it	c
could	c
be	c
nice	c
to	i
students	c
who	c
are	c
interested	c
in	c
arts	i
,	c
if	c
you	c
help	i
special	c
events	c
,	c
for	c
instance	c
,	c
song	i
contest	c
,	c
writing	c
competition	c
or	c
dance	c
lessons	c
.	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
I	c
hope	c
the	c
festival	c
is	c
developed	i
next	c
year	c
with	c
excellent	c
reasonably-priced	c
ticket	i
like	c
this	c
year	c
's	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

Do	c
you	c
need	c
money	c
?	c

Probably	c
the	c
best	c
way	c
you	c
can	c
get	c
money	c
is	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
part	i
time	i
job	c
in	c
your	c
spare	c
time	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
recommending	c
you	c
to	i
check	i
your	c
possible	c
time	c
to	c
work	c
-	c
weekdays	c
or	c
weekend	c
?	c
-	c
before	c
you	c
request	i
a	c
job	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
go	c
to	c
your	c
school	c
or	c
local	c
council	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
case	c
,	c
I	i
could	i
get	i
a	i
telephone	i
researcher	i
part	i
by	i
my	i
friend	i
's	i
reference	i
.	i

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
do	c
n't	c
forget	c
that	c
a	c
job	c
is	c
just	c
spent	i
in	c
your	c
"	c
spare	c
"	c
time	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
,	c

During	c
my	c
stay	c
in	c
London	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
your	c
theatre	c
to	c
see	c
this	c
show	c
.	c

The	c
show	c
had	i
to	c
start	c
at	c
19:30	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
.	c

I	c
invited	c
a	c
friend	c
of	c
mine	c
and	c
promised	c
her	c
that	c
we	c
will	i
go	c
there	c
.	c

Your	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

Everything	c
was	c
just	c
vice	i
versa	i
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
not	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

My	c
class	c
was	c
going	c
to	c
a	c
night	i
disco	i
and	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
go	c
there	c
too	c
.	c

I	c
told	c
my	c
secret	c
to	c
my	c
best	c
friend	c
Pat	i
.	c

But	c
she	c
told	c
it	c
to	c
very	i
kid	c
in	c
school	c
,	c
even	c
the	c
teachers	c
heard	c
it	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
the	c
concert	c
hall	c
is	c
too	c
small	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
great	c
concert	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
should	i
be	c
bigger	c
for	c
jazz	c
,	c
rock	c
or	c
still	i
classical	c
concerts	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
some	c
ideas	c
for	c
the	c
next	c
year	i
events	c
,	c
such	c
as	c
:	i

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
I	c
hope	i
will	i
be	c
better	c
next	c
year	c
if	c
these	c
points	c
was	i
observed	c
for	i
the	i
each	i
year	i
the	i
event	i
to	i
be	i
better	c
than	c
before	c
.	c

How	c
are	c
you	c
?	c

Dear	c
The	i
Manager	c
of	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
,	c

That	c
made	c
me	c
feel	c
disappointed	c
.	c

It	c
should	c
be	c
on	c
time	c
at	c
19:30	c
.	c

Besides	c
this	c
,	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	i
early	i
closed	i
.	c

Lastly	c
,	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
think	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
my	c
perfect	c
evening	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
replying	i
from	c
you	c
.	c

As	c
far	c
as	c
we	c
knew	c
,	c
she	i
's	i
good	c
at	c
cooking	c
.	c

When	c
he	c
asked	c
her	c
'	i
why	i
do	c
you	c
choose	c
deliberately	i
?	c
'	c
,	c
she	c
answered	c
without	c
thinking	c
.	c

That	c
caused	c
the	c
secret	c
disclosed	i
.	c

Dear	c
Jean	c
Clark	c
,	c

As	c
you	c
tell	i
me	c
in	c
your	c
last	c
letter	c
you	i
were	c
talking	c
about	c
rules	c
in	c
your	c
class	c
and	c
you	c
want	i
to	c
know	c
about	c
school	c
rules	c
in	c
my	c
country	c
and	c
also	c
what	c
I	c
am	c
allowed	c
to	c
do	c
at	c
home	c
.	c

First	c
I	i
must	c
tell	c
you	c
that	c
teachers	i
are	c
strict	c
at	c
school	c
.	c

We	c
ca	c
n't	c
chat	c
with	c
our	c
classmates	c
.	c

How	c
boring	c
!	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
as	c
a	c
representative	c
of	c
the	c
class	c
about	c
the	c
3-day	c
school	c
trip	c
which	c
has	c
been	c
organized	c
for	c
next	c
week	c
.	c

Being	c
famous	i
and	i
risk	i
is	c
something	c
all	c
of	c
us	c
have	c
dreamt	c
of	c
sometimes	i
.	c

But	c
not	i
always	i
famous	i
people	i
are	i
happy	c
of	i
their	c
condition	i
.	c

Also	c
the	c
most	c
famous	c
star	c
can	c
be	c
unhappy	c
and	c
depresed	i
:	c
not	i
always	i
,	i
in	i
fact	i
,	i
money	i
and	i
celebrity	i
being	i
happiness	c
.	c

13th	c
June	c
2000	c

Dear	c
Ms	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
at	i
log	c
cabins	c
rather	c
than	c
tents	c
.	c

It	c
will	c
be	c
my	c
first	c
time	c
to	i
experience	i
to	i
stay	i
there	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
interested	c
in	c
trying	c
new	c
things	c
which	c
I	c
have	c
not	c
tried	c
.	c

Actually	c
,	c
I	c
used	c
to	c
play	c
basketball	c
for	c
6	c
years	c
and	c
am	c
quite	c
confident	c
of	i
it	c
.	c

And	c
nowadays	i
,	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
practicing	i
tennis	c
as	c
school	i
activity	c
.	c

Therefore	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
choose	c
basketball	c
and	c
tennis	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
considering	i
about	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
should	c
wear	c
and	c
how	c
much	c
I	c
need	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
be	c
most	c
grateful	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
give	c
me	c
further	c
advicable	i
information	c
.	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

I	c
hope	c
everything	c
around	c
you	c
is	c
alright	c
.	c

which	i
I	c
must	c
have	c
set	c
thousands	c
chairs	i
correctly	c
and	c
after	c
finishing	c
I	c
put	c
them	c
back	c
nicely	c
.	c

The	c
reason	c
I	c
enjoyed	c
it	c
very	c
much	c
is	c
that	c
I	c
could	c
meet	c
the	c
vocalist	c
on	i
setting	c
chairs	c
just	c
before	c
they	c
started	c
practicing	i
.	c

Anyway	c
it	c
was	c
so	c
interesting	c
time	i
that	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
even	c
feel	c
tired	c
after	c
that	c
.	c

You	c
must	i
like	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
seeing	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

The	c
show	c
is	c
opened	i
between	c
ten	c
and	c
seven	c
p.m	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
,	c
March	c
14	c
at	i
Central	i
Exhibition	c
Hall	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
,	c
the	i
addmission	i
for	c
students	c
is	c
free	c
.	c

We	c
hope	c
that	c
you	c
consider	c
our	c
suggestion	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerily	i
,	c

People	c
may	c
tend	c
to	c
avoid	i
from	i
living	i
in	i
a	i
large	i
number	i
of	i
families	i
in	i
an	i
expected	i
small	i
house	i
in	i
a	i
city	i
.	c

The	c
longer	c
and	c
further	i
they	c
live	c
on	c
their	c
own	c
,	c
the	c
more	c
they	c
may	c
feel	c
that	c
they	c
need	c
a	c
family	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
surprised	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
.	c

First	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
mention	c
that	c
I	c
can	c
only	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
will	c
work	c
in	c
August	c
in	c
a	c
web	c
designer	i
studio	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
's	c
more	c
exciting	c
to	c
be	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
than	c
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
.	c

I	c
also	c
had	c
Painting	c
as	c
main	i
subject	c
at	c
school	c
for	c
five	c
years	c
.	c

I	c
like	c
painting	c
very	c
much	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
I	c
am	c
good	c
in	i
Painting	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
also	c
important	c
to	c
present	c
a	c
comercial	i
english	i
lesson	c
,	i
maybe	i
the	c
pupils	c
could	c
write	c
"	c
offers	c
and	c
orders	c
"	c
or	c
enquiries	c
on	c
the	c
blackboard	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
your	c
entertainment	i
which	c
was	c
advertised	c
in	c
the	c
last	c
edition	c
of	c
"	c
Plays	c
"	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
afraid	c
that	c
reality	c
had	c
nothing	c
common	c
with	c
the	c
things	c
I	c
suspected	i
to	c
meet	i
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
the	c
prices	c
were	c
n't	c
lower	i
in	i
any	i
cases	i
although	i
you	i
advertised	i
the	i
information	i
like	i
that	i
.	c

Then	c
,	c
I	c
expected	c
the	c
show	c
to	c
start	c
on	c
time	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
turned	c
out	c
that	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
wait	c
45	c
minutes	c
.	c

Especially	i
I	c
was	c
disappointed	c
by	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
who	i
made	c
me	c
nervous	c
with	c
his	c
lack	c
of	c
talent	c
.	c

Come	i
back	i
to	c
paradise	c

People	c
spend	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
money	c
to	c
buy	c
something	c
extraordinary	c
,	c
feel	c
comfortable	c
and	c
stand	c
out	c
.	c

They	c
come	c
up	c
with	c
many	c
ideas	c
but	c
it	c
ca	c
n't	c
last	c
for	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
.	c

Styles	c
mix	c
,	c
colours	c
and	c
shapes	c
come	c
back	c
from	c
the	c
past	c
,	c
only	i
the	c
fabrics	c
are	c
different	c
.	c

People	c
look	c
for	c
something	c
new	c
but	c
it	c
is	c
not	c
so	c
easy	c
to	c
be	c
creative	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
.	c

Teenagers	c
are	c
bored	c
with	c
casual	c
fashion	c
and	c
their	c
parents	c
laugh	c
at	c
them	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
fact	c
they	c
wear	c
common	i
clothes	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
you	c
changed	c
actors	c
without	c
informing	c
viewers	i
.	c

As	c
if	c
this	c
were	c
not	c
enough	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
forty	i
five	i
minutes	c
late	c
.	c

Your	c
leaflet	c
was	c
rather	c
misleading	c
on	c
this	c
subject	c
.	c

According	c
to	c
your	c
leaflet	c
,	c
tickets	c
were	c
supposed	c
to	c
be	c
a	c
bit	c
cheaper	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
was	c
refused	c
being	i
given	i
a	c
discount	c
.	c

On	c
top	c
of	c
everything	c
,	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

My	c
life	c
has	c
also	c
changed	c
as	c
a	c
result	c
of	c
modern	c
technology	c
.	c

I	c
also	c
enjoy	c
shopping	c
through	i
internet	i
.	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
see	c
some	c
disadvantages	c
of	c
technological	c
progress	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
modern	c
technology	c
has	c
made	c
our	c
environment	c
more	c
polluted	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
very	c
interesting	c
and	c
I	c
enjoyed	c
reading	c
it	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
know	c
,	c
I	c
enjoyed	c
helping	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
last	c
month	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
sell	c
tickets	c
for	c
the	c
concert	c
in	c
the	c
street	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
angry	c
because	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c

the	c
artists	c
performing	c
their	c
songs	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
very	c
important	c
experience	c
for	c
me	c
because	c
I	c
learnt	c
all	c
about	c
the	c
organisation	c
of	c
a	c
pop	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c

.	c
.	c

I	c
read	c
it	c
and	c
found	c
it	c
very	c
good	c
,	c
specially	i
,	i
Science	i
Museum	c
and	c
National	c
Art	c
Gallery	c
as	c
I	c
am	c
interested	c
in	c
arts	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
suggest	c
a	c
change	c
in	c
the	c
programme	c
by	c
giving	c
up	c
shopping	c
and	c
going	c
to	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
will	c
consider	c
this	c
proposition	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
form	i
you	c
.	c

THE	c
HOME	c
OF	c
THE	c
FUTURE	c

It	c
gives	c
you	c
safety	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
not	c
know	c
people	c
who	c
would	c
not	c
want	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
home	c
.	c

We	c
like	c
our	c
houses	c
that	i
is	c
why	c
are	i
always	c
trying	c
to	c
make	c
it	i
more	c
comfortable	c
and	c
useful	i
.	c

Take	c
care	c
of	c
your	c
home	c
,	c
do	c
not	c
hesitate	c
in	i
it	c
and	c
you	c
will	c
be	c
very	c
happy	c
.	c

At	i
the	i
begining	i
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
.	c

Now	c
I	c
am	c
going	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
some	c
further	c
informations	i
I	i
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
only	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
student	c
in	c
High	i
school	c
and	c
this	c
is	c
most	i
important	c
year	c
of	c
my	c
life	c
I	i
am	c
studying	c
to	i
university	i
entrance	c
exams	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
study	c
until	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
June	c
and	c
then	c
by	i
the	c
end	c
of	c
June	c
I	c
will	c
be	i
having	i
university	i
entrance	c
exam	c
after	i
that	c
in	i
July	c
I	i
am	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
alright	c
.	c

My	c
first	c
question	c
is	c
about	c
clothes	c
;	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
do	c
we	c
need	c
to	c
take	c
with	c
us	c
?	c
and	i
How	i
much	c
money	c
do	c
we	c
need	c
to	c
take	c
?	c

Your	i
sincerely	c

Osman	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
very	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
,	c
because	c
very	c
little	c
of	c
what	c
was	c
offered	i
in	c
the	c
advertisements	c
was	c
provided	c
.	c

Thirdly	c
,	c
it	c
was	i
written	i
that	c
discounts	c
were	c
available	c
but	c
we	c
were	c
again	c
frustrated	c
,	c
seing	i
they	c
were	c
not	c
available	c
.	c

Yours	c
Sincerely	i
,	c

MY	c
LIFE	c
AND	c
MODERN	c
TECHNOLOGY	c

Here	c
we	c
are	c
,	c
in	c
the	c
21st	c
century	c
...	c

But	c
how	c
has	c
modern	c
technology	c
changed	c
our	c
lives	c
?	c

In	c
my	c
spare	c
time	c
,	c
I	c
watch	c
television	c
,	c
play	c
with	c
my	c
computer	c
,	c
or	c
chat	c
in	i
the	c
internet	i
...	c
"	c

There	c
is	c
no	c
sentence	c
without	c
electronic	c
devices	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
go	c
out	c
with	c
my	c
friends	c
or	c
read	c
books	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
look	c
at	c
my	c
life	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
understand	c
I	c
am	c
dependent	c
on	c
the	c
machines	c
.	c

Modern	c
technology	c
has	c
changed	c
my	c
life	c
completely	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
they	c
are	c
the	c
nearest	i
'	c
arts	c
'	c
in	c
real	c
life	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

Of	c
course	c
,	c
you	c
ca	c
n't	c
afford	c
a	c
luxualy	i
car	c
and	c
a	c
large	c
apartment	c
unless	c
you	i
've	i
born	i
with	i
a	i
silver	i
spoon	i
.	c

Not	c
only	c
it	i
's	i
a	c
simple	c
job	c
,	c
but	c
also	c
you	c
can	c
enjoy	c
working	c
with	c
many	i
colleague	i
at	i
your	c
age	c
.	c

You	c
'll	c
find	c
that	c
your	c
life	c
is	c
becoming	c
more	c
and	c
more	c
enjoyable	c
!	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
in	c
reply	c
to	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
only	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
my	c
family	c
is	c
going	c
to	c
visit	c
me	c
on	i
August	c
and	c
I	c
will	c
have	c
to	c
look	c
after	c
them	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
been	c
sailing	c
since	c
my	c
father	c
had	i
bought	c
a	c
boat	c
in	c
1980	c
,	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
only	c
five	c
years	c
old	c
.	c

For	c
me	c
it	c
is	c
only	c
a	c
hobby	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
what	c
kinds	c
of	c
clothes	c
should	i
I	i
take	c
with	c
me	c
.	i

and	c
I	c
wonder	c
if	c
prizes	i
are	c
high	c
there	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

It	c
is	c
n't	c
true	c
.	c

We	c
like	c
them	c
because	c
everything	c
is	c
on	i
one	c
place	c
.	c

You	c
ca	c
n't	c
buy	c
something	c
in	c
peacful	i
and	c
calm	c
athmospher	i
.	c

However	c
such	c
centers	i
are	c
very	c
useful	c
and	c
necessary	c
.	c

I	i
my	c
opinion	c
the	c
worst	c
thing	c
which	c
may	c
happened	i
is	c
extremly	i
hugh	i
queu	i
to	i
the	c
changing	c
room	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
really	c
exhausting	c
.	c

Nevertheless	c
sometimes	c
shopping	c
could	i
be	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr.	c
Robertson	c

The	c
show	c
is	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
the	c
14th	c
of	c
March	c
,	c
from	c
10	i
oo	i
to	i
19	i
oo	i
o'clock	i
in	c
the	c
Central	c
Exhibition	c
Hall	c
.	c

This	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
for	c
us	c
,	c
because	c
we	c
have	c
n't	c
been	i
ever	i
before	i
in	i
this	c
kind	c
of	c
show	c
.	c

Instead	c
of	c
visiting	c
the	c
Science	c
Museum	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
we	c
could	c
go	c
there	c
on	c
Wednesday	c
afternoon	c
and	c
instead	c
of	c
going	c
shopping	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
afternoon	c
we	c
could	c
maybe	c
stop	c
at	c
some	c
places	c
during	c
the	c
sightseeing	c
tour	c
and	c
buy	c
there	i
something	i
.	c

This	c
is	c
also	c
important	i
to	c
him	c
as	c
friendship	c
and	c
family	c

The	c
photographers	c
are	c
chasing	c
these	c
people	c
,	i
just	c
to	c
take	c
a	c
picture	c
of	c
them	c
on	i
how	c
they	c
eat	c
or	c
with	c
who	i
the	i
meat	i
.	c

The	c
price	c
for	c
fame	c
and	c
money	c
is	c
the	c
lost	i
of	c
privacy	c
.	c

As	c
well	c
as	c
this	c
,	c
the	c
stars	c
should	c
n't	c
complaint	i
at	c
any	c
time	c
about	c
their	c
fans	c
and	c
their	c
lost	i
of	c
privacy	c
.	c

They	c
wanted	c
to	c
be	c
famous	c
and	c
the	i
had	i
known	i
the	c
price	c
before	i
.	c

The	c
fans	c
and	c
the	c
press	c
are	c
those	c
who	c
have	c
made	c
them	c
rich	c
and	c
famous	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
!	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
"	c
,	c
wich	i
I	c
visited	i
on	c
Friday	c
the	c
16th	c
of	c
June	c
in	c
your	c
theatre	c
.	c

On	c
your	c
ticket	i
information	c
is	c
written	c
out	i
that	c
discounts	c
are	c
available	c
,	c
when	c
I	c
ask	i
at	c
the	c
ticket	c
reception	i
I	c
could	c
n't	c
get	c
any	c
discount	c
for	c
beeng	i
student	i
.	c

To	c
make	i
an	i
result	i
the	c
evening	c
in	c
your	c
theatre	c
and	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
very	c
disappointing	c
and	c
not	c
like	c
promised	i
.	c

What	c
is	c
the	c
prize	c
?	c

After	c
one	c
hour	c
the	c
hohle	i
class	c
had	c
heard	c
about	c
Sarah	c
's	c
secret	c
.	c

Sarah	c
realized	c
that	c
everybody	c
was	c
nice	c
and	c
friendly	c
to	c
her	c
but	c
something	c
was	c
going	c
on	c
in	c
the	c
class	c
,	c
when	c
she	c
turned	c
around	c
a	i
talking	c
and	c
wispering	i
started	c
.	c

Suddenly	c
,	c
she	c
went	c
to	c
Pat	c
and	c
asked	c
him	i
did	i
you	c
tell	c
anybody	c
about	c
our	c
secret	c
.	i

Pat	c
told	c
her	c
everything	c
.	c

Sarah	c
looked	c
at	c
him	c
for	c
a	c
while	c
,	c
than	i
she	c
stood	c
in	c
front	c
of	c
the	c
class	c
and	c
explaind	i
to	c
the	c
others	c
,	i
that	c
she	c
won	i
a	c
prize	c
for	c
20	c
people	c
to	c
travel	c
for	c
1	c
week	c
to	c
the	c
sea	i
of	c
southern	c
France	c
and	c
everybody	i
of	c
the	c
19	c
pupils	c
was	c
invited	c
,	c
except	c
Pat	c
who	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
know	c
if	c
I	c
should	c
take	c
any	c
warm	c
clothes	c
with	c
me	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

It	c
was	c
nice	c
to	c
hear	c
from	c
you	c
recently	c
.	c

Then	c
a	c
young	c
man	c
told	c
me	c
what	c
to	c
do	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
good	c
idea	c
if	c
we	c
two	c
did	c
this	c
job	c
together	c
the	i
next	c
year	c
.	c

Give	c
my	c
regards	c
to	c
your	c
family	c

25th	c
November	c
2000	c

Most	c
of	c
the	c
events	c
were	c
wonderful	c
and	c
well-organised	i
.	c

In	c
addition	c
to	c
it	i
,	c
one	c
weekend	c
ticket	c
for	c
all	c
events	i
was	c
only	c
£	c
10	c
,	i
this	i
was	c
excellent	c
,	i
it	i
made	i
people	c
only	c
spend	i
pocket-money	i
,	c
and	c
then	c
they	c
could	c
watch	c
all	c
the	c
events	c
at	c
the	c
weeked	i
,	i
for	i
them	c
it	c
is	c
really	i
economical	c
to	i
spent	i
their	c
weekend	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
the	c
plays	c
and	c
films	c
were	c
wonderfully	c
welcomed	i
,	c
as	c
far	c
as	c
I	c
'm	c
concerned	c

we	c
are	c

,,Over	i

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

She	c
was	c
25-years-old	i
secretary	c
in	c
one	i

He	c
was	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
most	c
famous	c
person	i
in	c
his	i
city	c
,	c
but	c
he	c
was	c
n't	c
honest	c
with	c
his	c
clients	c
.	c

One	c
of	c
them	c
was	c
about	c
her	c

Of	c

,	c
only	c
one	c

My	c

to	i

But	c
the	c
most	c

Dear	c

There	c

advertisement	c
and	c
show	i
,	i
which	c
I	c
could	i
see	i
at	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
.	c

She	i
is	c
my	c
famous	i
artist	c
and	c
I	c
was	i
coming	i
there	c
mainly	c
because	c
of	c
him	c
.	c

The	c
place	c
you	c
have	i
offered	c
was	c
closed	c
and	c
there	c
was	c
nothing	c
to	c
eat	c
inside	c
the	c
theatre	c
at	c
all	c
.	c

Could	c
you	c
possibly	c
explain	c
why	c
you	c
did	c
n't	c
provide	c
us	c
anything	i
to	c
eat	c
?	c

I	c
think	c
,	i
this	c
could	c
be	c
the	c
only	c
,	i
right	c
possibility	i
for	c
me	c
,	i
to	c
forget	c
about	c
my	c
not	i
interesting	i
evening	c
.	c

We	c
saw	c
almost	c
all	c
kinds	c
of	c
skirts	c
,	c
trousers	c
,	c
coats	c
,	c
skirts	c
and	c
even	c
hats	c
-	c
which	c
untill	i
nowadays	i
are	i
the	c
main	c
point	c
of	c
many	c
fashion	c
creatures	i
.	c

What	c
something	i
new	i
has	c
n't	c
been	c
invented	c
for	i
now	c
?	c

And	c
it	i
will	c
be	c
the	i
past	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
are	c
you	c
interested	c
in	c
that	c
style	c
?	c

Do	c
you	c
agree	c
with	c
me	c
?	c

This	c
fashion	c
is	c
coming	c
,	c
so	c
think	c
about	c
it	c
.	c

These	c
are	c
the	c
colours	c
of	c
the	c
FUTURE	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
advertisement	c
,	c
it	c
was	i
told	i
that	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
was	c
starring	c
,	c
but	c
in	c
place	c
of	c
him	c
there	c
was	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
and	c
he	c
was	c
really	c
dissapointing	i
.	c

I	c
could	c
not	c
see	c
any	c
portion	c
of	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
's	c
performance	c
at	i
him	c
.	c

Also	c
,	c
in	c
the	c
schedule	i
,	c
the	c
time	c
of	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
written	c
as	c
19:30	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
20;15	i
and	c
,	i
I	c
missed	c
the	c
dinner	c
I	c
was	c
going	c
to	c
have	c
with	c
my	c
best	c
friend	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

TECHNOLOGY	c
AND	c
MY	c
DAILY	c
LIFE	c

on	i
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
because	c
of	c
dealing	i
with	i
computers	c
so	c
much	c
,	c
I	c
can	i
not	i
see	c
my	c
family	c
and	c
friends	c
very	c
much	c
,	c
even	c
when	c
we	c
are	c
at	i
the	c
same	c
medium	i
.	c

But	c
despite	c
this	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
happy	c
with	c
the	c
facilities	i
of	i
technology	i
in	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
.	c

Dear	c
Ms	c
Jane	i
Clark	c
,	c

At	i
first	i
,	c
I	c
propose	i
to	i
invite	i
stars	c
and	c
artists	c
not	c
from	c
all	c
the	i
world	c
,	c
but	c
from	c
only	c
six	c
countries	c
.	c

From	c
my	c
point	c
of	c
view	c
,	c
there	c
should	c
be	c
more	c
films	c
because	c
this	c
part	c
of	c
the	c
festival	c
is	c
interesting	c
for	c
people	c
.	c

And	c
,	c
at	i
last	i
,	c
I	c
should	c
congratulate	c
you	c
with	i
the	c
decision	c
of	i
making	i
one	c
weekend	c
ticket	c
for	c
all	c
events	c
.	c

I	c
support	c
this	c
idea	c
which	c
is	c
convinient	i
both	c
for	c
people	i
and	c
organisators	i
.	c

Thanks	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
and	c
postcard	c
.	c

At	i
first	i
,	c
about	c
school	c
.	c

And	c
the	c
problem	c
is	c
that	c
nobody	c
wants	c
to	c
wear	c
it	c
.	c

That	c
's	c
why	c
our	c
headmaster	c
is	c
really	c
angry	c
.	c

Off	i
course	c
,	c
if	c
we	c
had	c
such	i
pretty	c
forne	i
like	c
yours	c
,	c
we	c
would	c
wear	c
it	c
with	c
pleasure	c
.	c

This	c
is	c
all	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
write	c
you	i
about	c
rules	c
.	c

I	c
miss	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
see	i
you	c
next	c
summer	c
after	c
my	c
exams	c
.	c

Write	c
me	i
what	i
do	i
you	c
think	c
about	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
wanted	c
to	c
drink	i
a	c
coffee	c
but	c
,	i
unfortunately	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
,	c
because	c
the	c
waiter	c
went	i
out	c
!	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
modern	c
technology	c
has	c
changed	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
very	c
much	c
.	c

At	i
first	i
,	c
there	c
are	c
now	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
things	c
that	c
most	c
people	c
use	c
at	c
home	c
.	c

We	c
could	c
n't	c
imagine	c
our	c
life	c
without	c
them	c
.	c

It	c
can	c
really	c
help	c
a	c
lot	c
to	c
cure	c
people	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
one	c
hand	c
it	i
helps	c
me	c
a	c
lot	c
in	c
daily	c
life	c
,	c
but	c
on	c
the	c
other	c
I	i
'm	c
afraid	c
of	c
the	c
future	c
everyday	i
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Ryan	c
,	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
pleased	c
to	c
see	c
that	c
I	c
win	i
the	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
working	c
the	c
rest	c
of	c
this	c
summer	c
.	c

For	c
the	c
accommodation	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
because	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
probably	c
more	c
comfortable	c
.	c

I	c
choose	c
singing	c
because	c
I	c
love	c
singing	c
and	c
I	c
am	i
in	c
a	c
choir	c
for	c
7	c
years	c
now	c
.	c

I	c
also	c
choose	c
climbing	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

It	c
is	c
not	c
comfortable	i
at	c
all	c
.	c

That	c
is	c
why	c
I	c
am	c
writing	c
this	c
letter	c
;	c
to	c
inform	c
you	c
about	c
the	c
problems	c
I	c
had	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
the	c
tickets	c
were	c
too	c
expensive	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
really	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
eating	c
at	c
that	c
place	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
not	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

Sally	c
,	c
her	c
best	c
friend	c
,	c
had	c
told	c
her	c
what	c
had	c
been	c
happening	c
at	c
her	c
house	c
for	c
the	c
last	c
two	c
months	c
.	c

She	c
had	c
seen	c
her	c
stepfather	c
hitting	c
her	c
mother	c
everytime	i
he	c
was	c
drunk	c
.	c

She	c
did	c
n't	c
want	c
to	c
tell	c
the	c
teachers	c
at	c
school	c
or	c
any	c
other	c
person	c
because	c
she	c
was	c
afraid	c
that	c
if	c
her	c
stepfather	c
find	i
out	c
about	c
that	i
,	c
he	c
would	c
get	c
made	i
and	c
hit	c
her	c
,	c
or	c
even	c
worse	c
,	c
kill	c
her	c
mother	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
the	c
police	c
.	c

Sally	c
was	c
so	c
scared	c
,	c
and	c
at	c
the	c
same	c
time	c
mad	c
at	c
Pat	c
because	c
she	c
knew	c
the	c
only	c
person	c
who	c
could	c
have	c
told	c
the	c
police	c
was	c
her	c
best	c
friend	c
.	c

Dear	c
Ms	c
Ryan	c

I	c
decided	c
to	i
have	i
the	i
accommodation	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
in	i
a	c
tent	c
,	c
because	c
there	c
you	c
will	c
have	c
lots	c
of	c
fun	c
.	c

Another	i
question	i
I	i
have	i
;	c
the	c
live	i
there	c
,	c
is	c
it	c
as	c
expensive	c
as	c
I	c
think	c
?	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

L.	c
Schwartz	c

I	c
've	c
recived	i
your	c
letter	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
pleased	c
to	c
have	c
won	c
because	c
I	c
needed	c
some	c
days	c
to	c
relax	c
myself	i
and	c
to	c
leave	c
the	c
city	c
,	c
which	c
is	c
very	c
extressing	i
.	c

In	c
spite	c
of	c
liking	c
all	c
the	c
sports	c
you	c
wrote	c
in	i
your	c
letter	c
I	i
am	c
only	c
good	c
at	c
climbing	c
and	c
sailing	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
am	i
used	i
to	i
practise	i
them	c
with	c
my	c
father	c
since	i
I	c
was	c
a	c
child	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
.	c

In	c
that	c
way	c
shopping	c
can	c
be	c
as	c
funny	i
as	c
you	c
want	c
,	c
although	c
if	c
you	c
do	c
it	c
very	c
often	c
,	c
it	c
will	c
be	i
as	i
an	i
obligation	i
in	i
the	i
future	i
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

About	c
two	c
weeks	c
ago	c
,	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
London	c
for	c
a	c
week	i
holiday	c
.	c

After	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
over	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
possible	c
to	c
visit	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
,	c
as	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
that	c
day	c
.	c

You	c
will	c
find	c
the	c
receipt	c
enclosed	c
.	c

I	c
will	c
take	c
the	c
exemple	i
of	c
the	c
use	c
of	c
the	c
internet	i
.	c

It	c
is	c
also	c
possible	c
to	c
read	c
the	c
news	c
or	c
play	c
games	c
.	c

I	c
also	c
have	c
the	c
possibility	i
of	c
making	c
new	c
friends	c
:	c
I	c
can	c
connect	c
to	c
a	c
special	c
site	c
which	c
will	c
enable	c
me	c
to	c
virtually	c
meet	c
people	c
.	c

Also	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
says	i
,	i
that	c
the	c
show	c
will	i
begin	c
at	c
19.30	c
and	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
20.15	c
;	c
that	c
mean	i
that	c
I	c
have	i
to	c
cancelled	i
a	c
date	c
that	c
I	c
had	c
at	c
21:00	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
coud	i
n't	i
make	c
it	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
at	i
work	c
;	c
computer	i
are	c
really	c
amazing	c
,	c
you	c
only	c
need	c
to	c
turn	c
it	i
on	c
and	c
start	c
to	c
write	c
;	c
your	c
work	c
is	c
more	i
clean	i
and	c
you	c
work	c
faster	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
technology	c
have	i
made	c
human	i
life	i
easily	i
,	c
funier	i
and	c
more	c
comfortable	c
.	c

Afterwards	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
expecting	c
to	c
have	c
at	c
least	c
a	c
nice	c
dinner	c
in	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
already	c
closed	c
because	c
the	c
show	c
ended	c
too	c
late	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
reading	c
this	c
letter	c
.	c

We	c
cannot	c
deny	c
that	c
technology	c
has	c
changed	c
our	c
lives	c
.	c

Nowadays	c
,	c
we	c
do	i
not	i
need	i
anymore	i
to	c
spend	c
hours	c
cooking	c
,	c
for	c
example	c
:	c
we	c
just	c
put	c
some	c
frozen	c
food	c
in	c
the	c
microwave	c
,	c
and	c
in	c
a	c
few	c
minutes	c
our	c
meal	c
is	c
ready	c
.	c

We	c
can	c
communicate	c
with	c
people	c
in	c
distant	c
countries	c
in	c
real	c
time	c
,	c
using	c
the	c
internet	i
.	c

There	c
is	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
other	c
examples	c
of	c
how	c
technology	c
has	c
changed	c
people	c
's	c
lives	c
.	c

In	c
adittion	i
,	c
I	c
would	c
rather	i
playing	c
tennis	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
was	c
younger	c
I	c
won	c
the	c
National	c
Tennis	c
Championship	c
.	c

I	c
also	c
like	c
surfing	c
,	i
I	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
dangerous	c
sport	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
know	c
how	c
to	c
practice	i
it	c
,	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
fact	c
that	c
last	c
year	c
a	c
proffessional	i
surfer	c
tought	i
me	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

To	c
summarize	c
,	c
I	c
could	i
say	c
that	c
if	c
you	c
want	c
to	c
buy	c
something	c
,	c
first	c
make	c
sure	c
what	c
sort	c
of	c
product	c
you	c
need	c
and	c
then	c
,	i
go	c
shopping	c
.	c

IT	c
STARTED	c
FORTY-FIVE	c
MINUTES	c
AFTER	c
THE	c
RIGHT	c
TIME	c
AND	c
WE	c
HAD	c
TO	c
WAIT	c
OUTSIDE	c
THE	c
THEATRE	c
.	c

ONE	c
OF	c
THE	c
EMPLOYEES	c
OF	c
THE	c
THEATRE	c
TOLD	c
ME	c
THAT	c
IT	c
WAS	c
BECAUSE	c
THEY	c
WERE	c
CLEANING	c
IT	c
TO	c
GET	c
RID	c
OF	c
THE	c
RATS	c
.	c

I	i
'VE	i
NOT	c
IMPRESSED	c
WHEN	c
HE	c
TOLD	c
ME	c
THIS	c
.	c

THIS	c
TECHNOLOGY	c
CHANGED	i
OUR	c
LIFE	i
IN	c
MANY	c
WAYS	c
AND	c
WE	c
ALMOST	c
DO	c
N'T	c
NOTICE	c
IT	c
.	c

THIS	c
TECHNOLOGY	c
HAS	i
ALSO	i
IT	c
'S	c
BAD	c
ASPECT	c
,	i
IT	c
MAKES	i
YOU	c
MORE	i
FAR	i
FROM	c
PEOPLE	c
,	i
ISOLATED	i
FROM	c
TRUE	c
RELATIONSHIPS	c
BUT	c
YOU	c
CAN	c
HANDLE	c
IT	c
WHEN	c
YOU	c
GOT	i
USED	c
TO	c
THIS	c
.	c

Accommodation	c
is	c
very	c
important	c
for	c
me	c
as	c
well	c
.	c

I	c
'd	c
very	c
much	c
like	c
to	c
do	c
painting	c
and	c
swimming	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
quite	c
good	c
at	c
painting	c
.	c

It	c
will	i
be	c
fantastic	c
experience	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

You	c
pay	c
for	c
all	c
costs	c
.	c

And	c
please	c
let	c
me	c
know	c
How	c
the	c
weather	c
is	c
.	c

But	c
it	c
is	c
impossible	c
to	c
buy	c
everything	c
at	c
the	c
same	c
time	c
.	c

Before	c
I	c
go	c
out	c
home	i
,	c
I	c
make	c
a	c
plan	c
.	c

But	c
when	c
I	c
stand	c
at	i
every	c
shops	i
,	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
stand	i
my	c
desire	c
.	c

If	c
I	c
have	c
got	c
enough	c
money	c
to	c
buy	c
something	c
what	i
I	c
want	c
to	c
buy	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
buy	c
them	c
and	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
no	c
problem	c
.	c

I	c
feel	c
depressed	c
.	c

Dear	c
Ms.	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
almost	c
could	c
not	c
believe	c
it	c
when	c
I	c
received	c
the	c
letter	c
you	c
had	i
sent	i
.	c

When	c
I	c
was	c
at	c
the	c
Univercity	i
I	c
was	c
very	c
keen	c
on	c
basket	i
ball	i
and	c
I	c
was	i
playing	i
in	i
Univercity	i
's	i
team	c
.	c

In	c
1998	c
we	c
were	c
the	c
champion	c
of	c
the	c
First	c
National	c
Leque	i
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
is	c
because	c
of	c
my	c
long	c
legs	c
.	c

What	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	i
need	c
to	c
bring	c
with	c
me	c
?	c

Novadays	i
our	c
shopping	c
habits	c
seem	c
to	c
be	i
changed	c
.	c

Yes	c
!	c

There	c
was	c
only	c
one	c
shop	c
in	c
the	c
area	c
where	c
I	c
used	c
to	c
live	c
until	c
we	c
moved	c
to	c
Oxford	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
really	c
astonished	c
by	c
all	c
these	c
shopping	c
centers	i
like	i
ASDA	c
,	c
HOMEBASE	c
,	c
ex	i
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
could	c
not	c
find	c
the	c
entrance	c
.	c

I	c
realized	c
that	c
I	c
'd	c
walked	c
so	c
many	c
times	c
in	c
front	c
of	c
the	c
entrance	c
but	c
the	c
door	c
had	c
looked	c
like	c
a	c
window	c
.	c

I	c
started	c
looking	c
for	c
the	c
food	c
products	c
written	i
on	c
the	c
paper	i
but	c
I	c
found	c
only	c
the	c
eggs	c
,	c
milk	c
and	c
bread	c
.	c

I	c
bought	c
a	c
ticket	c
for	c
the	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
musical	c
show	c
last	c
Saturday	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
felt	c
very	c
disappointed	c
with	c
it	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
announced	c
that	c
there	c
would	c
be	c
discount	c
tickets	c
available	c
,	c
but	c
there	c
were	c
not	c
.	c

The	c
show	c
should	c
have	c
started	c
at	c
19.30	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
delayed	i
forty-five	c
minutes	c
.	c

Nowadays	c
,	c
I	c
feel	c
myself	i
entirely	c
linked	c
to	c
these	c
innovations	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
find	c
it	c
hard	c
to	c
live	c
without	c
them	c
.	c

Currently	c
,	c
I	c
exchange	c
e-mails	c
with	c
dozens	c
of	c
people	c
all	c
over	c
the	c
country	c
.	c

Dear	c
Ms	c
Ryan	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
going	c
to	c
finish	c
my	c
exams	c
in	c
June	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
planning	c
to	c
go	c
back	c
to	c
China	c
in	c
early	c
August	c
.	c

Would	c
you	c
tell	c
me	c
that	i
how	c
much	c
money	c
you	c
would	i
give	c
it	i
to	c
me	c
and	c
how	i
is	i
the	i
weather	i
like	c
in	c
U.S.A.	i
Thank	c
you	c
for	c
every	i
thing	i
!	c

During	c
break	i
time	c
I	c
did	c
give	c
a	c
lots	i
of	c
direction	i
to	c
people	c
who	c
ca	i
n't	i
find	c
toilet	i
,	c
and	c
information	i
such	c
as	c
where	c
they	c
could	c
have	c
a	c
cup	c
of	c
coffee	c
.	c

Write	i
to	i
you	i
next	i
time	i
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
work	c
except	i
that	c
month	c
.	c

I	c
prefer	c
staying	c
in	c
tents	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
unusual	i
experience	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

Now	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
two	c
questions	c
about	c
camping	c
.	c

First	c
,	c
what	c
clothes	c
should	c
I	c
bring	c
?	c

Is	c
it	c
hot	c
enough	c
?	c

Second	c
,	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
to	i
I	c
need	c
?	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

As	c
I	c
mentioned	c
before	c
,	c
I	c
really	c
enjoyed	c
helping	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
last	c
month	c
,	i
the	i
artist	c
's	c
name	c
was	c
"	c
Bonny	c
Pink	c
"	c
who	i
is	c
famous	c
in	c
my	c
country	c
.	c

Actually	c
,	c
I	c
could	c
have	c
a	c
chance	c
to	c
ask	c
her	c
about	c
music	c
,	c
her	c
favorite	i
artist	c
and	c
her	c
hobby	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
impressed	c
when	c
I	c
heard	c
that	c
she	c
liked	c
playing	i
puzzle	i
alone	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
very	i
interesting	c
experience	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
wish	c
you	c
were	i
there	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

Third	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
chosen	c
'	c
Tennis	c
'	c
and	c
'	c
Photography	c
'	c
for	i
my	c
activities	c
at	c
the	c
Camp	c
.	c

Since	c
then	c
I	c
have	c
entered	c
ten	c
competitions	c
and	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
three	c
times	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
also	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
should	c
take	c
with	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
and	c
travelling	c
to	c
the	c
U.S.A	c
.	c

Last	c
month	c
I	c
helped	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
.	c

The	c
name	c
of	c
the	c
band	c
was	c
'	c
Dream	c
Comes	c
True	c
'	c
.	c

This	c
bank	i
is	c
not	i
only	i
in	i
Japan	i
but	i
also	i
in	i
the	i
U.S.A	i
very	i
famous	i
.	c

First	c
,	c
I	c
helped	c
to	c
prepare	c
the	c
stage	c
before	c
the	c
band	c
arrived	c
.	c

The	c
music	i
instruments	c
were	c
transported	c
from	c
the	c
lorries	c
(	c
three	c
big	c
lorries	c
!	c
)	c
into	c
the	c
concert	c
hall	c
and	c
I	c
helped	c
to	c
put	c
them	c
at	i
the	c
right	c
position	c
on	c
the	c
stage	c
.	c

They	c
were	c
very	c
heavy	c
and	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
carry	c
them	c
with	c
care	c
because	c
they	c
were	c
very	c
important	c
for	i
the	c
band	c
.	c

After	c
that	c
I	c
helped	c
to	c
test	c
lights	c
and	c
microphones	c
.	c

I	c
almost	c
fainted	c
when	c
the	c
band	c
arrived	c
and	c
entered	c
the	c
stage	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
a	c
fan	c
of	c
this	c
band	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
seen	c
them	c
in	c
flesh	i
.	c

I	c
want	c
to	c
help	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
again	c
!	c

Best	c
wishes	c
,	c

Dear	c
Sir	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
an	c
evening	c
I	c
spent	c
in	c
your	c
theatre	c
to	i
see	i
a	c
musical	c
show	c
.	c

To	c
end	c
,	c
in	i
spite	i
of	i
being	c
opened	i
,	c
the	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
for	c
reparations	i
.	c

Because	c
of	c
all	c
those	i
inconvenients	i
,	c
I	c
ask	c
you	c
a	i
total	c
refund	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

When	c
poor	c
Caroline	c
arrived	c
at	c
school	c
on	c
Wednesday	c
morning	c
all	c
the	c
students	c
of	i
her	c
class	c
knew	c
about	c
what	c
she	c
had	c
just	i
said	i
the	c
day	c
before	c
to	c
Pat	c
.	c

After	c
a	c
long	c
conversation	c
they	c
eventually	c
decided	c
to	c
split	c
up	c
.	c

Because	c
of	c
his	c
behaviour	c
,	c
now	i
Pat	i
is	i
alone	c
and	c
nobody	c
trust	i
in	i
him	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
about	c
the	c
trip	c
to	c
London	c
.	c

So	c
we	c
can	c
walk	c
around	c
and	c
see	c
how	i
it	i
looks	i
like	i
in	i
Greenwich	i
.	c

It	c
is	c
from	c
10	c
am	c
to	c
7	c
p.m.	c
,	i
it	i
is	i
about	i
the	c
latest	c
fashion	c
,	c
leisure	c
and	c
sports	c
wear	c
,	c
make	i
up	i
and	c
hairstyles	c
,	i
all	i
of	c
us	c
are	c
really	c
interesting	i
,	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
free	c
for	c
student	i
to	c
get	c
in	c
as	c
well	c
.	c

This	c
trip	c
was	c
organised	c
by	c
our	c
form	c
tutor	c
,	i
he	i
wanted	c
to	c
test	c
us	i
if	c
we	c
trust	i
each	c
other	c
and	c
worked	c
in	c
a	c
team	c
,	c
and	c
the	c
trip	c
last	i
for	c
3	c
days	c
.	c

I	c
did	c
not	c
want	c
to	c
climb	c
up	c
but	c
I	c
did	c
not	c
have	c
any	c
choice	c
.	c

But	c
after	c
I	c
climbed	c
two	c
steps	c
more	c
,	c
my	c
right	c
feet	i
slipped	c
over	i
,	i
I	c
was	i
nearly	c
fell	c
down	i
,	c
but	c
luckly	i
my	c
hand	c
caught	c
a	c
rock	c
,	i
it	i
was	c
dangerous	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
had	i
any	c
choice	c
,	i
finally	i
I	c
did	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
was	c
definitely	c
not	c
a	i
perfect	c
evening	c
as	i
garenteed	i
in	c
your	c
advertisement	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
having	c
a	c
full	c
refund	c
in	c
the	c
very	c
near	c
future	c
as	c
I	c
did	c
not	c
enjoy	c
it	c
at	c
all	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
so	c
sad	c
about	c
it	c
and	c
did	c
not	c
forgive	c
Pat	c
even	c
though	c
she	c
apologise	i
for	i
thousands	c
of	c
times	c
.	c

'	c
If	c
there	c
were	c
no	c
cleaner	i
,	c
who	c
would	c
clean	c
the	c
school	c
for	c
us	c
,	i
who	i
would	c
keep	c
the	c
environment	c
nice	c
and	c
tidy	c
.	i
'	c

The	c
teacher	c
also	c
grinned	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
so	c
impressed	c
and	c
repeated	c
the	c
words	c
in	c
my	c
heart	c
:	c
'	c
All	c
the	i
jobs	c
have	c
the	c
same	c
importance	c

Being	c
on	c
a	i
holiday	c
trip	i
in	c
London	c
,	c
I	c
dreamed	c
to	i
go	i
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
for	i
a	c
musical	c
show	c
.	c

In	c
fact	c
,	c
your	c
musical	c
show	c
was	c
attractive	c
:	c
actors	c
,	c
time	c
,	c
restaurant	c
,	c
discount	c
tickets	c
,	c
and	c
also	c
the	c
title	c
!	c

What	c
was	c
written	c
on	i
the	c
advertisement	c
?	c

The	c
summum	i
was	c
reached	c
when	c
I	c
saw	c
the	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
for	c
"	c
holidays	c
"	c
.	c

I	c
spent	c
the	c
worse	i
evening	c
of	c
my	c
holiday	c
in	i
this	c
show	c
!	c

So	c
I	c
need	i
now	i
a	c
"	c
perfect	c
-	c
money	i
back	i
-	c
"	c
for	i
replacement	c
of	i
your	c
"	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
"	c

I	c
often	c
go	c
on	c

to	c
find	c
informations	i
for	i
studying	c
a	c
precise	i

At	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c

the	c
main	c

The	c

required	c

Firstly	c
,	c
the	c
most	c
suitable	c
month	c

and	c
my	c

I	c
confess	c
you	i
that	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
been	c

and	c
till	i
now	i
I	c
have	c
never	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
want	c

I	c
am	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
better	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
travel	c
on	i
July	c

I	c
will	c
started	i

at	c
7.30	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
afternoon	c
the	c
singers	c
cames	i
in	c
and	c
I	c
also	c
could	c
have	c
an	c
interview	c
with	c
Ricky	c
Martin	c
.	c

lot	i
of	c
kisses	c

Now	c
you	c
can	c
guess	c
how	c
disappointed	c
I	c
was	c
when	c
I	c
saw	c
that	c
there	c
were	c
different	c
(	c
and	c
worse	c
)	c
actors	c
!	c

so	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
wait	c
forty-five	c
minutes	c
outside	c
and	c
it	c
was	c
raining	c
cats	c
and	c
dogs	c
!	c

I	c
'd	c
rather	c
say	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
catastrophe	c
!	c

And	c
I	c
am	c
really	c
sorry	c
,	c
but	c
consequently	c
I	c
would	c
ask	c
you	c
for	c
some	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

For	c
instance	c
,	c
my	c
discman	c
gives	c
me	c
the	c
possibility	c
to	c
listen	c
to	c
music	c
or	c
to	c
the	c
radio	c
everywhere	c
:	c
in	c
the	c
underground	c
,	c
or	c
when	c
I	c
walk	c
in	c
the	c
city	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
,	c

Hairstyles	c

We	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
request	i
if	c
we	c
could	c
go	c
to	c
this	c
show	c
on	c
the	c
15th	c
March	c
instide	i
off	i
the	i
visit	c
in	i
the	c
Science	c
Museum	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
in	i
advanced	i
for	c
your	c
comprehention	i
and	c
we	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
for	i
you	c
.	c

The	c
private	c
life	c
of	c
famous	c
people	c
!	c

They	c
have	i
always	i
to	c
be	c
careful	c
about	c
what	c
they	c
say	c
and	c
what	c
they	c
do	c
.	c

What	c
a	c
surprise	c
!	c

At	i
first	i
,	c
from	i
your	c
advert	c
Danny	i
Brook	c
(	c
who	c
is	c
a	c
very	c
good	c
singer	c
I	c
appreciate	c
very	c
much	c
)	c
was	i
not	c
here	i
.	c

At	i
second	i
,	c
to	c
go	c
on	c
with	i
the	c
beginning	c
,	c
your	c
show	c
started	c
not	c
at	c
19.30	c
but	c
nearly	c
one	c
hour	c
later	c
(	c
20.15	c
to	c
be	c
more	c
precise	c
!	c
)	c

And	c
for	c
the	c
third	c
point	c
,	c
I	c
would	i
hope	i
to	c
offer	i
a	c
good	c
diner	i
to	c
my	c
friend	c
because	c
I	c
knew	c
your	c
restaurant	c
as	i
a	c
famous	c
place	c
but	c
I	c
was	c
still	i
disappointed	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
!	c

I	c
was	c
just	c
thirteen	c
years	c
old	c
!	c

I	c
had	c
read	c
a	c
very	c
good	c
book	c
about	c
pirates	c
and	c
I	c
know	c
I	c
got	i
a	c
very	c
creative	c
imagination	c
.	c

To	i
make	i
to	i
profit	i
my	i
ideas	i
my	c
parents	c
lived	c
in	c
a	c
small	c
village	c
near	c
a	i
wonderful	c
country	i
.	c

With	c
my	c
friend	c
Pat	c
(	c
I	i
put	i
him	i
in	i
the	i
confidence	i
)	c
I	c
started	c
to	c
work	c
and	c
my	c
idea	c
became	c
real	c
.	c

We	c
could	c
play	c
hours	i
and	c
hours	c
without	c
seeing	c
an	c
adult	c
or	c
other	i
children	c
from	c
the	c
village	c
.	c

I	c
accepted	c
them	c
but	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
angry	c
against	i
Pat	c
.	c

There	c
was	i
lots	c
of	c
fights	c
between	c
us	c
and	c
we	c
were	c
naughty	c
like	c
child	i
could	i
be	c
with	c
other	c
child	i
.	c

Dear	c
Miss	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
in	c
reply	c
to	c
your	c
letter	c
,	i
informing	c
me	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
the	i
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
which	c
is	c
two	c
weeks	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
in	c
the	c
U.S.A	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
really	c
pleased	c
to	c
hear	c
that	c
the	c
prize	c
includes	c
accommodation	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
be	c
really	c
happy	c
if	c
I	c
could	c
apply	i
Singing	i
and	c
Photography	i
as	i
the	i
activities	c
you	c
have	c
written	i
about	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
afraid	c
that	c
July	c
is	c
the	c
only	c
appropriate	i
month	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
due	c
to	c
start	c
work	c
in	c
August	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

I	c
'm	c
sorry	c
I	c
have	c
n't	c
written	c
for	c
so	c
long	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
've	c
been	c
quite	c
busy	c
just	c
recently	c
.	c

Last	c
month	c
,	c
I	c
helped	c
at	i
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
which	i
I	c
really	c
enjoyed	c
.	c

Do	c
you	c
know	c
what	c
Kim	c
,	c
I	c
've	c
never	c
thought	c
before	c
,	i
that	c
enjoying	c
yourself	c
like	c
this	c
,	i
could	c
be	c
weirdly	c
.	i

But	c
I	c
'm	c
really	c
happy	c
,	i
that	c
I	c
had	c
even	c
small	i
role	c
in	c
making	i
people	c
enjoying	i
themselves	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
introduced	c
to	c
the	c
singer	c
by	c
my	c
friend	c
,	c
who	c
works	c
for	c
him	c
.	c

I	c
suppose	c
,	i
I	c
will	c
never	c
forget	c
that	c
night	c
.	c

Last	c
week	c
I	c
spent	c
my	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
and	c
I	i
've	i
seen	i
your	c
musical	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
'	c
in	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
really	c
disappointed	c
.	c

Because	c
of	c
these	c
problems	c
I	c
had	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
for	c
a	i
compensation	c
,	c
maybe	c
to	c
get	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
understand	c
my	c
complains	i
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
the	i
modern	c
technology	c
has	c
changed	i
my	i
daily	i
life	i
not	i
really	i
a	c
lot	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
just	c
20	c
years	c
old	c
and	c
I	c
used	c
to	c
play	c
computer	i
when	c
I	c
was	c
young	c
or	c
wash	c
my	c
clothes	c
in	c
the	c
washing	c
machine	c
.	c

Of	c
course	c
,	c
it	c
changes	c
,	c
it	c
became	c
normal	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
mobile	c
phone	c
or	c
to	i
use	i
mainly	i
the	c
computer	c
and	c
the	c
internet	i
.	c

It	c
becomes	c
more	i
and	i
more	i
easier	i
to	c
use	c
the	c
computer	c
for	c
everything	c
.	c

I	c
can	c
just	c
switch	c
on	c
my	c
computer	c
and	c
order	c
everything	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
think	c
in	i
my	c
generation	c
it	i
is	c
not	c
a	c
really	c
big	c
difference	c
.	c

I	c
love	c
travelling	c
when	c
the	c
weather	c
is	c
warm	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
meting	i
you	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
what	c
happened	c
last	c
month	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
You	i
do	i
n't	i
believe	c
me	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
enjoed	i
helping	c
at	c
a	i
Oasis	i
's	i
pop	i
concert	c
.	c

The	c
concert	c
was	c
absolutely	c
fantastic	c
.	c

Yours	c
Irene	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

The	i
Price	i
of	i
the	i
ticket	i
was	i
said	i
that	i
there	i
would	i
be	i
discounts	i
available	i
.	c

I	c
also	c
found	c
out	c
that	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
not	c
opened	i
after	c
the	c
show	c
due	c
to	c
the	i
shortage	i
of	i
food	i
sold	i
.	c

Fashion	c
is	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
most	c
popular	c
topics	c
people	c
discuss	c
about	i
in	i
the	i
past	i
,	i
now	i
and	i
also	i
in	i
the	i
future	i
.	c

It	c
is	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
increasing	c
number	i
of	c
population	i
and	c
the	c
shortage	c
of	c
the	i
oxygen	c
gas	c
in	c
the	c
atmosphere	c
.	c

Indeed	i
,	i
my	i
wife	c
is	c
afraid	c
of	c
sleeping	c
in	c
tents	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
want	i
to	c
ask	c
you	c
whether	c
we	c
had	i
to	c
bring	c
money	i
:	i
Life	c
is	c
so	c
expensive	c
there	c
!	c

Tom	c
Turner	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
as	c
Mathematics	i
are	i
the	c
main	c
lesson	c
in	c
the	c
morning	c
,	c
we	c
ought	c
to	c
film	c
a	i
time	c
where	i
we	c
are	c
in	c
MathClass	i

the	c
lunch	c

We	c
could	c
begin	c
the	c
afternoon	c
with	c
the	i
sport	c
,	c
showing	c
the	c
different	c
places	i
with	c
surroundings	i
(	c
near	i
the	i
wild	i
)	c
:	c
it	c
would	c
give	c
a	c
good	c
impression	c
.	c

I	c
advise	c
to	i
finish	i
with	c
a	c
lesson	i
of	i
Chemistry	i
so	c
that	c
people	c
see	c
the	c
laboratery	i
.	c

Like	i
I	c
have	c
already	c
told	c
you	c
,	c
instead	c
of	c
being	c
the	c
perfect	c
evening	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
the	c
worst	c
I	c
ever	c
had	c
.	c

Hope	c
to	c
hear	c
from	c
you	c
:	c

And	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
's	c
the	c
same	c
to	i
me	c
,	c
because	c
when	c
advances	c
in	c
technology	c
like	i
computers	c
,	c
internet	i
,	c
etc.	c
were	i
made	c
,	c
it	c
changed	c
my	c
life	c
as	c
a	c
high	c
school	c
student	c
.	c

Answering	i
the	c
question	c
:	c
"	c
How	c
has	c
modern	c
technology	c
changed	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
?	c
,	i
I	c
can	c
confirm	c
,	i
that	c
it	c
has	c
been	c
in	c
many	c
ways	c
,	c
and	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
one	c
that	c
I	c
can	c
remember	c
was	c
the	c
invention	c
of	c
computers	c
and	c
later	c
the	c
internet	i
,	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
easiest	i
to	i
me	c
,	c
and	c
to	i
every	i
one	i
,	c
to	c
make	i
your	c
home	i
works	i
,	c
school	i
works	i
,	c
and	c
in	i
fact	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
easier	c
to	i
me	c
to	c
search	c
for	c
information	c
that	c
in	c
the	c
past	c
I	c
would	c
have	c
to	c
look	c
at	i
in	c
a	c
library	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
only	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
.	c

So	c
that	c
's	c
the	c
reason	c
why	c
I	c
can	i
not	i
travel	c
in	c
August	c
.	c

I	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
tents	c
rather	c
than	c
log	c
cabins	c
,	i
because	c
I	c
have	c
had	i
a	i
camping	c
once	c
and	c
I	c
stayed	c
in	c
tents	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
great	c
to	c
have	c
a	i
fun	c
and	c
also	c
it	i
was	i
very	i
good	i
memorise	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
quite	c
good	c
at	c
singing	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
a	c
talent	c
about	i
singing	c
that	c
I	i
can	c
entertain	c
people	c
by	c
singing	c
.	c

In	c
fact	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
some	c
questions	c
that	i
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
will	c
need	c
,	c
what	c
else	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
bring	c
with	c
and	i
if	i
I	i
have	i
a	i
emergency	i
what	i
you	i
can	i
do	i
for	i
.	c

Lee	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
not	c
,	c
however	c
,	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
that	i
there	c
are	c
both	c
advantages	c
and	c
disadvantages	c
.	c

The	c
customer	c
can	c
never	c
know	c
what	c
price	c
is	c
the	c
normal	c
unless	i
they	c
have	c
a	i
same	c
shop	c
or	c
same	i
thing	c
.	c

Also	c
tents	c
are	c
not	c
fairly	i
comfortable	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
wondering	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
wear	c
in	c
California	c
?	c

Hello	c
Kim	c
,	c

Yes	c
!	c
!	c
!	c

So	c
,	c
I	c
started	c
to	c
speak	c
in	c
English	c
with	c
him	c
.	c

I	c
thought	c
he	c
was	c
very	c
rude	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
was	c
wrong	c
,	c
he	c
is	c
n't	c
arrogant	c
at	c
all	c
and	c
he	c
looks	c
very	c
simply	i
.	c

Yeah	c
!	c
!	c
!	c

I	c
'm	c
not	c
joking	c
,	c
I	c
got	c
his	c
e-mail	c
.	c

Well	c
my	c
friend	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
go	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
got	i
an	c
appoinment	i
with	c
the	c
Dentist	c
.	c

Write	c
me	i
soon	c
and	c
take	c
care	c
.	c

Best	c
wishes	c

So	c
,	c
because	c
of	c
that	c
I	c
can	c
only	c
then	i
.	c

You	c
ofer	i
me	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
activities	c
.	c

I	c
play	c
basketball	c
and	c
tennis	c
very	c
well	c
.	c

I	c
've	c
got	i
also	i
two	c
questions	c
.	c

How	c
much	c
money	c
I	i
need	c
to	c
stay	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
and	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	i
should	i
take	c
with	c
me	c
?	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
!	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
,	c
which	c
arrived	c
this	c
morning	c
.	c

You	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
how	c
was	i
the	i
Top-Pop	i
Concert	i
,	c
which	c
I	c
helped	c
to	c
organise	c
last	c
month	c
.	c

I	c
gave	c
information	c
about	c
correct	c
ways	c
to	c
another	i
places	c
like	c
tooletes	i
and	c
medical	c
points	c
.	c

I	i
was	c
big	i
fun	c
!	c

As	c
for	c
the	c
accommodation	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
the	c
tent	c
because	c
it	c
is	i
my	i
first	c
time	c
that	c
I	i
'm	i
going	i
to	i
camping	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
see	c
how	i
the	i
real	i
life	i
is	i
.	c

That	c
is	c
all	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
making	c
my	c
dream	c
come	c
true	c

There	c
is	i
times	c
that	i
you	c
have	c
to	c
do	c
something	c
even	c
if	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
like	c
it	c
,	c
and	c
times	c
that	i
you	c
are	c
doing	c
what	c
you	c
like	c
but	c
not	c
the	i
time	c
you	c
like	i
it	i
.	c

What	c
I	c
'm	c
trying	c
to	c
say	c
is	c
that	c
I	c
like	c
to	c
shop	c
but	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
do	c
that	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
.	c

Because	c
my	c
school	c
finishes	c
end	i
of	c
June	c
and	c
I	c
will	c
have	c
a	c
month	i
break	c
after	i
that	c
I	i
have	c
to	c
do	c
a	c
computing	c
course	c
which	c
I	c
have	c
already	c
applied	c
for	c
it	i
.	c

Could	c
you	c
tell	c
me	c
what	c
sort	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
would	c
need	c
to	c
bring	c
with	c
me	c
and	c
will	c
I	c
need	c
any	c
extra	c
money	c
for	c
this	c
holiday	c
.	i

Then	c
,	c
I	c
discovered	c
some	c
points	i
and	c
I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
express	i
my	c
suggestion	i
and	c
recommendations	c
.	c

Next	c
,	c
One	i
reasonably-priced	c
weekend	c
ticket	c
for	c
all	c
events	c
is	c
also	c
fantastic	i
idea	c
,	c
because	c
everyone	c
could	c
enjoy	c
everything	c
by	i
the	i
ticket	c
.	c

While	c
you	c
stated	c
that	c
there	c
were	c
stars	c
and	c
artists	c
from	c
around	c
the	c
world	c
,	c
they	c
were	c
from	i
only	i
six	i
countries	i
in	i
fact	i
.	c

The	c
number	c
of	c
plays	c
and	c
films	c
were	i
also	c
very	c
few	i
.	c

On	c
balance	c
,	c
I	c
feel	c
that	c
this	c
annual	c
festival	c
can	c
be	c
even	c
better	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

I	c
also	c
suggest	c
that	c
more	c
plays	c
and	c
films	c
should	c
be	i
taken	i
place	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
be	c
grateful	i
to	c
support	c
you	c
providing	c
that	c
you	c
would	i
like	i
to	c
make	c
the	c
festival	c
more	c
successful	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerelly	i

So	c
this	c
is	c
quick	i
note	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
what	c
you	c
want	c
to	c
know	c
,	c
as	c
you	c
asked	c
about	c
school	c
rules	c
and	c
house	c
ones	c
.	c

We	i
ca	i
n't	i
also	i
turn	i
our	c
hair	c
colour	c
an	i
have	c
to	c
keep	c
hair	i
length	c
above	c
eye	i
blows	i
.	c

Just	i
I	i
ca	c
n't	c
go	c
out	c
after	c
9	c
o'clock	c
in	i
the	i
night	c
and	c
I	c
'm	c
not	c
allowed	c
to	c
play	c
computer	c
games	c
over	i
two	c
hours	c
.	c

These	c
are	i
not	c
so	c
strict	c
that	c
I	c
can	i
stand	c
them	c
.	c

Anyway	c
,	c
that	c
's	c
all	c
about	i
my	i
information	i
which	c
you	c
want	c
.	c

Write	c
soon	c
,	i
I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
I	c
must	c
tell	c
you	c
that	c
I	c
only	c
have	c
freetime	i
in	c
July	c
at	i
any	c
day	c
,	c
any	c
week	c
,	i
because	c
I	c
am	c
still	c
having	c
my	c
lesson	i
at	c
college	c
and	c
it	i
will	c
be	c
finished	c
at	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
June	c
and	i
also	c
in	c
August	c
I	c
have	c
a	c
training	c
course	c
for	c
my	c
studies	c
.	c

One	c
thing	c
,	i
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
is	c
how	c
many	c
clothes	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
with	c
me	c
and	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
cloth	i
they	c
are	c
?	i

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

Most	c
student	i
who	c
were	c
interviewed	c
suggested	c
to	i
have	i
a	c
speaking	c
part	c
of	i
the	c
lesson	c
to	i
be	c
on	c
film	c

Activities	c

Spending	c
time	c
together	c
out	c
of	c
the	c
class	c
is	c
the	i
nice	c
experiance	i
.	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
,	c

I	c
understood	i
you	c
want	c
to	c
know	c
when	c
am	i
I	i
available	c
to	c
set	c
off	c
and	c
where	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
stay	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
fond	c
of	c
swimming	c
but	c
unfortunately	c
I	c
am	c
not	c
a	c
good	c
swimmer	c
.	c

I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
some	c
questions	c
which	i
I	c
want	c
to	c
know	c
.	c

Do	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
bring	c
any	c
special	c
clothes	c
?	c

How	c
much	c
mone	i
do	c
you	c
recommend	c
me	c
to	c
bring	c
with	c
me	c
?	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

Last	c
month	c
I	c
helped	c
the	c
service	c
crew	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
.	c

I	c
saw	c
all	c
the	c
pop	c
bands	c
and	c
singers	c
.	c

Carrying	c
big	c
speakers	c
place	i
to	c
place	c
was	c
extremely	c
tiring	c
but	c
we	c
had	c
loads	c
of	c
laugh	i
.	c

I	c
was	c
just	c
walking	c
down	c
by	c
dressing	i
room	c
manager	i
said	i
that	i
if	c
I	c
could	c
help	c
them	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
in	c
her	c
room	c
and	i
helping	c
her	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
like	i
to	c
choose	c
swimming	c
as	c
activity	i
in	c
the	c
Camp	c
.	c

So	c
that	c
is	c
my	c
second	c
choice	c
.	c

Do	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
bring	c
something	i
else	c
?	c

If	c
is	i
so	c
,	c
please	c
let	c
me	c
know	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c
.	c

That	i
was	c
a	c
charity	c
concert	c
to	c
save	i
money	c
to	i
poor	c
people	c
of	i
AFRICA	c
.	c

I	c
should	c
say	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
the	c
easiest	c
and	c
more	i
interesting	c
job	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
ever	c
done	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
writting	i
to	c
you	c
to	c
make	c
a	c
complaint	c
about	c
your	c
musical	c
show	c
:	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
...	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
think	i
it	i
's	i
not	i
professional	c
to	c
change	c
the	c
principal	c
actor	c
in	i
the	c
last	c
minute	c
,	c
the	c
play	c
should	c
be	i
with	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
to	c
this	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
instead	c
19:30	i
,	c
more	c
45	i
minutes	c
in	i
late	c
...	c

There	c
was	c
well	i
a	c
restaurant	c
,	c
even	i
though	c
,	i
it	c
was	c
closed	c
for	c
reparations	i
,	c
also	i
2	c
hours	c
30	c
without	c
drinking	c
or	c
eating	c
something	c
,	i
was	c
quite	c
difficult	c
for	c
the	c
children	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

Nowadays	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
could	i
be	c
impossible	c
for	c
us	c
to	c
live	c
like	c
our	c
grand-parents	i
or	c
great	i
grand-parents	i
lived	c
...	c
we	c
are	c
too	c
lazy	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
's	c
not	c
our	c
mistake	i
,	c
this	c
revolution	c
is	c
called	c
"	c
progress	c
"	c
!	c

In	c
addition	c
to	c
this	c
,	c
thinking	i
also	i
,	i
to	i
the	i
medicine	i
,	i
science	i
or	i
astronomy	i
progress	i
...	c

I	c
have	c
just	c
been	c
there	c
and	c
noticed	i
some	c
points	i
which	c
could	c
make	c
the	c
festival	c
better	c
.	c

That	c
is	c
everything	c
I	c
have	c
noticed	i
about	i
the	c
festival	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
be	c
grateful	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
think	c
about	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
really	c
enjoyed	c
reading	c
it	c
.	c

There	c
're	c
plenty	c
of	c
rules	c
in	c
my	c
high	c
school	c
.	c

That	c
's	c
so	c
stupid	c
!	c

I	c
know	c
some	c
rules	c
are	c
necessary	c
to	c
control	c
the	c
students	c
.	c

And	c
the	c
advantage	c
of	c
this	c
is	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
need	c
to	c
think	c
about	c
what	c
to	c
put	c
on	c
every	c
morning	c
!	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

According	i
to	i
my	c
work	c
experience	c
as	c
a	c
lifeguard	c
I	c
will	c
choose	c
swimming	c
as	c
the	c
second	c
activity	c
.	c

How	c
much	c
money	c
do	c
I	c
need	c
?	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
there	c
are	c
some	c
disadvantages	c
.	c

You	c
need	c
to	c
buy	c
essential	c
items	c
like	c
food	c
and	c
you	c
get	c
tired	c
because	c
it	c
very	i
crowded	c
and	c
you	c
spend	c
more	c
time	c
thank	i
you	c
prefer	i
to	c
.	c

In	c
Conclusion	i
shopping	c
is	c
enjoyable	c
but	c
not	c
when	c
it	c
is	c
too	c
buzy	i
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
which	c
said	c
I	c
had	i
won	c
first	c

It	c
is	c
important	c
to	c

If	c
you	c

the	c

Dear	c
Miss	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
as	c
regards	c
the	c
letter	c
you	c
've	c
sent	c
me	c
about	c
the	c
competition	c
I	c
've	c
won	c
.	c

With	c
regard	c
to	c
the	c
date	c
of	c
the	c
trip	c
,	c
July	c
would	c
be	c
best	c
because	c
in	c
June	c
I	c
'm	c
going	c
to	c
visit	c
my	c
family	c
in	c
Mexico	c
and	c
in	c
August	c
school	c
begins	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
really	c
keen	c
on	c
sports	c
,	c
especially	c
sailing	c
.	c

I	c
've	c
practised	i
sailing	c
since	c
an	c
early	c
age	c
and	c
I	c
perfectly	i
manage	i
the	i
rigging	i
and	i
sail	i
.	c

I	c
'd	c
appreciate	c
it	c
a	c
lot	c
.	c

While	c
we	c
were	c
in	c
Florence	c
my	c
wallet	c
was	c
stolen	c
,	c
probably	c
by	c
a	c
gypsie	i
.	c

I	c
had	c
to	c
buy	c
my	c
dress	c
,	c
it	i
's	i
accesories	i
and	c
besides	i
clothes	c
and	c
souvenirs	c
!	c

I	c
felt	c
really	c
bad	c
seeing	c
my	c
friends	c
buy	c
the	c
latest	c
fashion	c
while	c
the	c
only	c
thing	c
I	c
could	c
do	c
was	c
tell	c
them	c
how	c
great	c
their	c
clothes	c
were	c
and	c
of	c
course	c
window-shop	c
.	c

For	c
the	c
trip	c
to	c
California	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
only	c
go	c
in	c
July	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
afraid	c
,	c
because	c
my	c
English	c
course	c
finishes	c
in	c
June	c
and	c
it	c
starts	c
again	c
in	c
August	c
.	c

How	c
much	c
money	c
would	c
I	c
need	c
?	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

The	c
feeling	c
of	c
buying	c
new	c
things	c
is	c
wonderful	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
you	c
did	c
not	c
plan	c
to	c
buy	c
any	c
crisps	c
,	c
but	c
they	c
are	c
at	c
half	c
price	c
and	c
you	c
buy	c
them	c
without	c
thinking	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
buying	c
things	c
needed	c
and	c
planned	c
could	c
be	c
enjoyable	c
but	c
buying	c
things	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
need	c
or	c
unplanned	c
,	c
might	c
make	c
you	c
feel	c
sad	c
after	c
sometime	i
.	c

He	c
must	c
not	c
learn	c
about	c
it	c
subsequently	i
you	c
must	c
not	c
tell	c
him	c
.	c

We	c
think	c
the	i
suitable	c
time	c
will	c
be	c
3-6	c
p.m.	c
You	c
can	c
come	c
earlier	c
,	c
if	c
you	c
want	c
.	c

We	c
would	c
have	c
junky	i
food	i
,	c
some	c
juices	c
and	c
drinks	c
.	c

Can	c
you	c
help	c
us	c
?	c

We	c
had	c
finished	c
the	c
exams	c
two	c
weeks	c
ago	i
and	c
we	c
were	c
waiting	c
for	c
the	c
results	c
.	c

He	c
would	c
earn	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
money	c
,	c
in	c
addition	c
they	c
wanted	c
an	i
another	c
person	c
.	c

At	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
the	c
summer	c
we	c
are	c
planning	c
to	c
visit	c
a	c
cousin	c
who	c
lives	c
in	c
Australia	c

13/6/2000-11-07	c

We	c
like	i

My	c

on	i
swimming	c
race	i

In	i
Golf	i
,	c
we	c
are	c
both	c
total	c
beginners	c
.	c

We	c
are	c
both	c
a	c
little	c
afraid	i
,	i
what	i
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
and	c
shoes	c
we	i
have	c
to	c
take	c
off	i
with	c
us	c
?	c

Which	i
temperature	i
will	i
be	i
on	i
the	c
summer	c
season	c
in	c
this	c
area	c
?	c

Finally	c
,	c
we	c
like	i
to	c
know	c
,	i
when	c
you	c
will	c
send	c
us	c
the	c
airline-tickets	i

the	c

we	i
will	i

on	c
this	c

How	c

We	c
were	c
mainly	c
on	i

for	i
all	c
the	c

In	c

We	c

excitement	i
and	c
I'am	i
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
if	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
those	c
spending	c
sprees	c
very	c
often	c
,	c
shopping	c
can	c
be	c
a	c
pleasant	c
experience	c
and	c
a	c
chance	c
to	c
spend	c
some	c
quality	c
time	c
with	c
your	c
family	c
.	c

Its	i
normal	c
to	c
have	c
spending	c
sprees	c
.	c

But	c
do	c
n't	c
be	c
afraid	c
.	c

At	c
the	c
ticket	c
office	c
I	c
also	c
asked	c
for	c
a	c
discount	c
but	c
they	c
told	c
me	c
this	c
was	c
n't	c
possible	c
,	c
instead	i
your	c
advertisement	c
said	i
clearly	i
there	c
were	c
discounts	c
available	c
!	c

The	c
advertisment	i
assured	i
us	c
a	c
perfect	c
evening	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
would	c
highly	c
appreciate	c
if	i
you	c
could	c
refund	i
completely	i
our	c
tickets	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

Since	c
Paul	c
ran	c
a	c
very	c
popular	c
hotel	c
in	c
London	c
,	c
he	c
told	c
Pat	c
that	c
on	c
Sunday	c
the	c
superstar	c
Madonna	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
be	c
staying	c
there	c
with	c
her	c
new	c
misterious	i
lover	c
.	c

On	c
Sunday	c
all	c
the	c
english	i
press	c
was	i
waiting	c
for	c
Madonna	c
in	c
front	c
of	c
Paul	c
's	c
hotel	c
and	c
when	c
they	c
discovered	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
all	c
an	i
invention	i
,	c
they	c
got	c
so	c
angry	c
that	c
they	c
wrote	c
on	i
every	c
newspaper	c
that	c
Pat	c
had	c
made	c
up	c
everything	c
!	c

Paul	c
finally	c
had	c
his	c
revenge	c
!	c
!	c

My	c
name	c
is	c
Manuel	c
Olmez	c
and	c
last	c
week	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
'	c
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
'	c
to	i
the	c
Circle	c
theatre	c
.	c

There	c
were	c
not	i
discounts	c
available	c
for	c
the	c
tickets	c
and	c
the	c
theatre	c
's	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
too	c
late	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
good	c
at	c
singing	c
and	c
photography	c
.	c

There	c
are	c
all	c
kinds	c
of	c
photos	c
,	c
for	c
example	c
,	c
beach	i
,	c
sea	c
trees	i
and	c
so	c
on	c
.	c

In	i
the	i
end	i
,	c
I	c
wonder	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
should	c
take	c
and	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
should	c
bring	c
with	c
me	c

The	c
aim	c
of	c
this	c
report	c
is	c
to	c
suggest	c
which	c
lessons	c
and	c
lessons	i
be	i
filmed	c
into	i
a	c
short	c
video	c
.	c

In	c
order	c
to	c
write	c
the	c
report	c
I	c
interviewed	c
about	c
one	c
hundred	c
students	c
who	c
are	c
studying	c
in	c
our	c
English	c
class	c
.	c

Two	c
thirds	c
said	c
we	c
should	c
film	c
a	i
part	i
of	i
playing	i
football	i
.	c

Playing	c
football	c
is	c
good	c
for	c
health	i
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
introduce	c
myself	c
.	c

Then	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
began	c
45	c
minutes	c
later	i
,	c
so	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
wait	c
very	i
long	c
.	i

For	c
example	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
born	c
knowing	c
the	i
man	c
has	c
stepped	i
on	c
the	c
moon	c
.	c

There	c
are	c
some	c
machines	c
which	c
have	c
helped	c
in	c
my	c
development	c
,	c
and	c
others	c
which	c
help	c
me	c
to	c
make	c
my	c
life	c
easier	c
.	c

The	c
computer	c
for	c
example	c
makes	c
communication	c
much	c
easier	c
and	c
faster	c
then	i
in	c
past	i
time	i
,	c
when	c
everything	c
was	c
send	i
by	c
common	i
mail	c
,	c
and	c
it	c
took	i
weeks	c
till	c
it	c
got	c
the	i
right	c
place	c
.	c

There	c
are	c
other	c
machines	c
which	c
are	c
bad	c
for	c
the	c
environment	c
.	c

Technology	c
has	c
to	c
move	c
further	c
so	c
it	c
can	c
solve	c
problems	c
as	i
pollution	c
,	c
so	c
we	c
can	c
live	c
better	c
and	c
longer	c
.	c

Dear	c
Helen	c

After	c
that	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
say	c
Thanks	c
,	c
I	c
never	i
have	i
won	c
any	c
price	i
at	c
all	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
tents	i
because	c
since	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
child	c
I	c
have	c
being	i
using	c
this	c
type	c
of	c
accommodation	c
.	c

I	c
used	c
to	c
go	c
to	i
campings	i

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Dear	c
Kim	c

I	c
am	c
writen	i
to	c
you	c
telling	i
about	i
my	c
experience	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
.	c

The	c
following	c
day	c
I	c
was	c
the	c
person	c
who	c
provide	i
the	c
meals	c
for	c
all	c
the	c
organization	i
staff	c
and	c
besides	i
every	c
day	c
I	c
was	c
at	i
the	i
back-stage	i
supporting	c
the	c
catering	c
staff	c
.	c

Particularly	i
I	i
am	i
pleased	c
to	c
had	i
know	i
the	c
most	c
popular	c
pop	c
stars	c
in	c
the	c
world	c
.	c

Hopping	i
to	c
hear	c
from	c
you	c

Best	c
wishes	c

When	c
I	c
bought	c
my	c
ticket	c
I	c
expected	c
to	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
take	c
advantage	c
of	c
those	c
discounts	c
you	c
announced	c
in	c
the	c
newspaper	c
advertisement	c
but	c
when	i
I	c
had	c
to	c
pay	c
the	c
most	c
expensive	c
price	c
.	c

Paul	c
asked	c
her	c
some	c
questions	c
about	c
her	c
childhood	c
and	c
her	c
toys	c
because	c
he	c
was	c
going	c
to	c
write	c
an	c
article	c
about	c
children	c
.	c

Pat	c
told	c
him	c
some	c
unimportant	c
things	c
such	c
as	c
she	c
learnt	c
to	c
swim	c
at	c
the	c
age	c
of	c
five	c
or	c
that	c
she	c
loved	c
ants	c
.	c

She	c
told	c
Paul	c
she	c
had	c
a	c
special	c
toy	c
called	c
Max	c
and	c
that	c
she	c
slept	c
with	c
him	c
.	c

Two	c
weeks	c
later	c
everybody	c
forbade	i
about	c
Marion	c
's	c
secret	c
and	c
she	c
took	i
into	i
account	i
her	c
relationship	c
with	c
Pat	c
.	c

.	c

How	c
much	c
money	c
would	c
like	i
to	c
pay	c
me	c
for	c
five	i
hours	i
a	i
day	i
in	i
two	i
weeks	i
working	i
with	i
children	i
?	c

Dear	c
Madam	c
,	c

If	c
it	c
is	c
possible	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
.	c

I	c
will	c
be	c
working	c
until	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
June	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
going	c
to	c
start	c
university	c
in	c
August	c
.	c

However	c
it	i
is	c
true	c
that	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
for	i
example	c
before	c
Christmas	c
or	c
during	c
some	c
special	c
salles	i
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
know	c
when	c
and	c
where	c
to	c
shop	c
quietly	c
but	c
in	c
my	c
opinion	c
spending	c
money	c
in	c
a	c
crowded	c
shop	c
is	c
the	c
most	c
enjoyable	c
thing	c
in	c
the	c
world	c
.	c

I	c
did	c
not	c
expect	c
to	i
find	i
all	c
the	c
problems	c
that	c
I	c
had	c
.	c

Thirdly	c
,	c
I	c
did	c
not	c
receive	i
any	c
kind	c
of	c
discounts	i
when	c
I	c
payed	i
although	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
it	c
was	c
written	c
.	i

I	c
think	c
that	c
if	c
the	c
musical	i
show	c
will	i
begin	i
later	c
the	c
restaurant	c
should	c
close	c
later	c
,	c
too	c
!	c

I	c
think	c
when	c
you	c
explain	i
a	c
secret	c
you	c
must	c
be	c
sure	c
that	c
you	c
have	c
chose	i
the	c
best	c
person	c
to	c
keep	c
it	c
.	c

When	c
you	c
go	c
to	c
the	i
university	c
you	c
are	c
a	c
person	c
who	c
can	c
begin	c
to	c
make	c
a	i
good	c
friends	c
.	c

You	c
have	c
an	i
experience	i
to	c
know	i
people	c
and	c
now	c
you	c
have	c
an	c
opportunaty	i
to	c
select	c
good	c
friends	c
.	c

Dear	c
Manager	c
,	c

The	c
show	c
should	c
start	i
at	c
19.30	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
did	c
n't	c
start	c
until	c
20.15	c
!	c

As	c
I	c
'm	c
a	c
student	c
,	c
I	c
usually	c
get	c
discounts	c
on	c
different	i
things	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
was	c
so	c
disappointed	c
when	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
get	c
it	i
here	i
!	c

It	c
could	c
have	c
been	c
a	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
!	c

For	c
example	c
TV	i
,	c
telephone	c
,	c
micrown	i
etc.	c
But	c
the	i
last	c
few	c
years	c
,	c
it	i
has	c
change	i
and	c
so	c
many	c
new	c
important	c
things	c
had	i
been	c
discovered	i
.	c

What	c
I	c
'm	c
talking	c
about	c
are	c
the	c
computer	i
,	c
which	c
now	c
can	c
be	c
found	c
in	c
almost	c
every	c
home	c
and	i
of	i
course	c
,	c
the	c
mobile	c
phone	c
!	c

I	c
tought	i
I	c
would	c
never	c
need	c
a	c
mobile	c
phone	c
,	c
but	c
my	c
mum	c
and	c
dad	c
gave	c
me	c
one	c
for	c
Christmas	c
last	c
year	c
and	c
now	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
live	c
without	c
it	c
!	c

It	c
's	c
so	c
quick	c
and	c
not	c
too	c
expensive	c
either	c
.	c

To	c
use	c
the	c
mobile	c
phone	c
by	i
the	c
way	c
,	c
is	c
very	c
expensive	c
.	c

Karol	c
Johannes	c

He	c
is	c
a	c
good	c
actor	c
but	c
I	c
saw	c
a	c
very	c
bad	c
one	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
sure	c
you	c
will	c
complain	i
the	c
reasons	c
why	c
I	c
want	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

And	c
Lorca	c
knew	c
it	c
.	c

That	i
's	i
a	c
story	c
of	c
a	c
crime	c
of	c
passion	c
.	c

Her	c
family	c
was	c
very	c
rich	c
and	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
men	c
wanted	c
to	c
marry	c
to	c
her	c
.	c

When	c
Jim	c
's	c
wife	c
knew	c
it	i
she	c
caught	i
a	c
gun	c
and	c
killed	c
her	c
husband	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
shock	c
for	c
Lorca	c
.	c

Pat	c
and	c
Jim	c
's	c
wife	c
lived	c
with	c
the	c
guilty	i
all	c
their	c
long	c
lives	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
suitable	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
only	c
,	c
because	c
that	c
is	c
when	c
I	c
am	c
on	c
holiday	c
from	c
work	c
.	c

About	c
surfing	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
an	c
amateur	c
at	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
been	c
surfing	c
for	c
five	c
years	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
competed	c
in	c
two	c
championships	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
start	c
at	c
ten	c
,	c
but	c
when	c
the	c
band	c
was	c
going	c
on	c
stage	c
,	c
the	c
leader	i
of	i
it	i
fell	c
down	c
on	c
some	c
wires	c
that	c
gave	c
the	c
power	c
to	c
all	c
the	c
instruments	c
and	c
all	c
the	c
lights	c
!	c

Then	c
,	c
a	c
security	c
guard	c
started	c
calling	c
for	c
help	c
.	c

I	c
happened	c
to	c
be	c
near	c
him	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
help	c
him	c
.	c

There	c
was	c
an	c
ambulance	c
behind	c
the	c
stage	c
,	c
so	c
the	c
paramedic	c
came	c
right	c
away	c
and	c
took	c
care	c
of	c
Bono	c
's	c
finger	c
.	c

Like	i
an	c
hour	c
later	c
,	c
he	c
recovered	c
and	c
the	c
show	c
began	c
.	c

Bye	c
!	c
see	c
you	c
soon	c
,	c

When	c
we	c
saw	c
your	c
advertisment	i
for	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
,	c
over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
,	c
we	c
immediatly	i
decided	c
that	c
this	c
must	i
be	c
a	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerelly	i

Adra	c
Johansson	c

I	c
had	c
thought	c
about	c
it	c
for	c
many	c
years	c
but	c
never	c
been	c
able	c
to	c
fulfill	i
my	c
dreams	c
.	c

However	c
I	i
was	c
n't	c
sure	c
if	c
my	c
decision	c
was	c
right	c
and	c
therefore	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
discuss	c
it	c
with	c
Pat	c
.	c

It	i
is	c
now	c
twenty	c
years	c
ago	c
.	c

Because	c
of	c
my	c
study	i
I	c
will	c
not	c
be	c
free	c
to	c
travel	c
until	c
july	i
and	c
schools	c
goes	i
on	i
in	c
August	c
again	i
so	c
I	c
hope	c
July	c
will	c
be	c
fine	c
.	c

So	c
one	c
week	c
befor	i
the	c
concert	c
I	c
went	c
at	i
"	c
L'Arena	c
"	c
to	c
meet	c
the	c
other	c
worker	c
and	c
receive	c
the	c
instructions	c
.	c

We	c
realy	i
started	c
to	c
work	i
like	i
ants	i
the	c
morning	c
befor	i
the	c
show	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
exiting	i
looking	c
all	i
three	c
mens	i
working	c
together	c
and	c
building	c
a	c
scene	i
,	c
and	c
it	c
was	c
interresting	i
to	c
help	c
the	c
sound	c
engineer	c
to	c
check	c
the	c
sound	c
and	c
configuring	i
his	c
computers	c
to	c
get	c
the	c
best	c
sound	c
possible	c
.	c

About	c
two	c
hours	c
befor	i
the	c
beginning	c
of	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
we	c
met	c
the	c
band	c
and	c
recieved	i
tickets	c
to	c
backstage	i
,	i
that	i
was	c
wonderful	c
,	c
maybe	c
better	c
than	c
the	c
concert	c
itself	c
!	c

Now	c
Kim	c
,	c
tell	c
me	c
about	c
your	i
side	i
of	i
the	i
show	i

Thirdly	c
I	c
chose	c
photography	c
and	c
swimming	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
previous	c
experience	c
in	c
these	c
activities	c
and	c
of	c
course	c
I	c
have	c
some	c
diplomas	c
which	c
I	c
will	c
send	c
you	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
,	c
I	c
work	c
every	c
summer	c
as	c
a	c
Monitor	i
in	i
the	c
leisure	c
centre	c
in	c
my	c
town	c
.	c

Apart	c
from	c
this	c
photography	i
is	c
one	c
of	c
my	c
favorite	i
hobbies	c
and	c
I	c
usually	c
spent	i
nearly	c
all	c
my	c
spare	c
time	c
practising	i
it	c
and	c
of	c
course	c
I	c
have	c
some	c
diplomas	c
as	c
well	c
.	c

On	i
the	i
one	i
hand	i
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
have	c
further	c
information	c
about	c
which	i
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
need	c
for	c
that	c
area	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
that	c
this	c
experience	c
was	c
wonderful	c
and	c
in	c
fact	c
I	c
enjoyed	c
a	i
lot	c
and	c
of	c
course	c
I	c
knew	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
people	c
there	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
I	c
found	c
it	i
very	i
short	i
time	i
and	c
they	c
offered	c
me	c
new	i
project	c
for	c
the	c
summer	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
really	c
like	c
to	c
see	c
a	c
new	c
one	c
such	c
as	c
Markin	c
Davis	c
,	c
he	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
actor	c
and	c
he	c
would	c
fit	c
well	c
this	i
musical	c
.	c

After	c
the	c
show	c
I	c
felt	c
really	c
hungry	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
meant	i
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
restaurant	c
which	i
occasionally	i
was	c
closed	c
.	c

Once	c
,	c
when	c
we	c
first	c
met	c
I	i
was	c
about	c
15	c
and	c
she	c
was	c
the	c
same	c
age	c
,	c
we	c
started	c
talking	c
and	c
by	c
the	c
time	c
we	i
found	c
out	c
a	i
very	c
good	c
friendship	c
on	i
our	c
conversation	c
.	c

Then	c
I	c
told	c
her	c
about	c
my	c
first	c
kiss	c
(	c
it	c
was	c
terrible	c
,	c
the	c
guy	c
did	c
n't	c
know	c
how	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
)	c
and	c
things	c
like	c
that	c
.	c

The	c
next	c
morning	c
when	c
I	c
got	c
to	c
the	c
high	c
school	c
I	c
heard	c
what	c
I	c
was	c
n't	c
expecting	c
,	c
Pat	c
had	c
told	c
everybody	c
about	c
my	c
first	c
experience	c
in	i
kissing	c
.	c

On	i
June	c
and	c
August	c
,	c
so	c
that	c
's	c
the	c
only	c
time	c
when	c
I	c
can	c
travel	c
there	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
the	c
best	c
time	c
is	c
the	c
first	c
two	c
weeks	c
of	c
July	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
free	c
then	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
prepare	c
the	c
clothes	c
of	c
the	c
pop	c
stars	c
.	c

The	c
most	c
exciting	c
things	c
happened	c
later	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
to	c
look	c
after	c
the	c
tone	i
that	i
nothing	i
goes	i
wrong	i
.	c

Hope	c
to	c
hear	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

Yours	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

I	c
was	i
very	c
glad	c
I	c
won	c
the	c
competition	c
.	c

As	c
far	c
as	c
the	c
dates	i
of	i
travelling	i
are	c
concerned	c
,	c
the	c
only	c
period	c
available	c
would	c
be	c
in	c
July	c
as	c
I	c
am	c
fully	c
booked	c
for	c
the	c
remaining	i
summer	i
.	c

I	c
really	c
did	c
n't	c
expect	c
to	c
win	c
the	c
trip	c
.	c

Could	c
you	c
please	c
include	c
in	c
your	c
next	c
letter	c
some	c
information	c
about	c
the	c
amount	c
of	c
money	c
and	c
clothes	c
we	c
have	c
to	c
carry	i
?	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

As	c
you	c
asked	c
me	c
,	c
I	c
write	i
you	i
about	c
my	c
experience	c
at	c
the	c
Pop	i
Concert	i

The	c
woman	c
had	c
to	c
deliver	c
something	c
.	c

But	c
,	c
as	c
I	c
said	c
,	c
the	c
whole	c
thing	c
was	c
fun	c

I	c
'm	c
sure	c
you	c
are	c
jalous	i
now	c

John	c

I	c
was	c
surprised	c
because	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
expect	c
that	c
I	c
could	c
win	c
.	c

The	c
second	c
my	i
favorit	i
sport	i
is	c

Would	c
you	c

me	c
your	c

as	c
fast	i
as	c
it	c
possible	i

I	c
look	c

to	c
seeing	c
you	c
soon	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

Often	c
we	c
looked	i
repetitions	i
and	c
if	c
something	c
did	c
n't	c
like	i
us	c
we	c
tried	c
to	c
correct	c
it	c
.	c

These	c
days	c
were	c
so	c
busy	c
.	c

But	c
when	c
we	c
saw	c
our	c
show	c
and	c
heard	c
how	c
loud	i
audience	i
claped	i
them	c
we	c
were	c
proud	c
and	c
understood	c
that	c
we	c
spent	i
a	i
good	i
time	i

Best	c

I	c
'm	c
writting	i
to	c
you	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
musical	c
show	i
that	c
I	c
saw	c
when	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
on	i
my	c
holidays	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
I	i
had	c
read	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
that	c
it	c
would	c
start	c
at	c
19:30	c
and	c
that	c
I	c
would	i
have	i
some	i
discount	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
,	c
what	i
means	i
that	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
wait	c
for	c
forthy	i
five	i
minutes	c
,	c
and	c
there	c
was	c
n't	c
any	c
discount	c
on	c

I	c

be	c
looking	c

We	i
could	i

How	c
the	i
fashion	c
change	i
in	c
its	c
colours	c
and	c
styles	c
,	c
Since	c
the	c
first	c
men	c
on	c
the	c
earth	c
started	c
to	c
wear	c

because	c
they	c
were	c
a	c

cold	c

Asking	c

about	c
the	c

of	c
the	c

you	c
realise	c
that	c
there	c
are	c
different	c

They	c
think	c
that	c
in	c
the	c

they	c
will	c
change	c
and	c
start	c
to	c
wear	c
more	c
formal	c

said	c
"	i
I	c

I	c

made	i
of	c

something	c

Most	c

the	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
your	c

As	c
far	c
as	c
accommodation	c
is	c
concerned	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
,	c
because	c
tents	c
are	c
too	c
hot	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

Please	c
let	c
me	c
know	c
how	i
is	i
the	i
climate	i
like	i
at	c
the	c
Camp	i
,	c
so	c
that	c
I	c
can	c
take	c
with	c

the	c
right	c

of	c

Being	c
a	c
woman	c
,	c
I	c
naturally	c
love	c
shopping	c
.	c

The	c
first	c
one	c
is	c
the	c
Christmas	c
period	c
.	c

In	c
many	c
cases	c
,	c
you	c
do	c
not	c
even	c
find	c
the	c
things	c
you	c
want	c
,	c
because	c
shops	i
run	c
out	c
of	c
products	c
very	c
quickly	c
.	c

For	c
the	c
majority	c
of	c
men	c
,	c
in	c
fact	c
,	c
shopping	c
is	c
the	c
most	c
boring	c
activity	c
in	c
the	c
world	c
.	c

Anyway	c
,	c
apart	c
from	c
these	c
two	c
cases	c
,	c
shopping	c
is	c
always	c
very	c
amusing	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
recently	c
been	c
in	i
London	c
for	c
spending	i
a	c
week	c
's	c
holiday	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
writen	i
that	c
the	c
stars	c
would	c
be	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
.	c

I	c
felt	c
abosolutly	i
disapointed	i
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
the	i
main	c
disadvantage	c
is	c
that	c
using	c
modern	c
machines	c
it	i
can	c
be	c
very	c
difficult	c
for	c
ederly	i
people	c
;	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
very	c
pratitable	i
if	c
the	c
modern	c
industries	c
train	i
people	c
about	i
using	i
modern	c
technologies	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
back	i
to	c
tell	c
you	c
that	c
I	c
am	c
happy	c
to	c
accept	c
this	c
prize	c
and	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
some	c
further	c
information	c
that	c
you	c
need	c
from	c
me	c
.	c

If	c
it	c
's	c
possible	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
on	i
July	c
because	c
of	c
my	c
job	c
.	c

I	c
ca	c
n't	c
leave	c
it	c
until	c
this	i
month	c
and	c
I	c
'm	c
not	c
able	c
to	c
travel	c
at	c
any	c
other	c
time	c
of	c
the	i
year	c
.	c

As	c
I	c
see	c
I	c
have	c
the	c
chance	c
to	c
choose	c
what	i
accommodation	c
I	c
prefer	c
.	i

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
because	c
I	i
'm	i
used	i
to	i
go	c
camping	c
at	c
weekends	c
but	c
if	c
there	c
's	c
any	c
problem	c
I	c
could	c
be	c
very	c
confortable	i
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
too	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
mind	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
are	c
apropriate	i
for	c
the	c
camp	c
and	c
for	c
the	c
weather	i
of	i
California	i

"	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
"	c

From	i
my	i
point	i
of	i
view	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
people	c
believe	c
that	c
it	c
's	c
very	i
fun	c
to	c
go	c
shopping	c
and	c
it	c
's	c
a	c
great	c
way	c
to	c
spend	c
Saturday	c
afternoons	c
and	c
that	c
's	c
true	c
but	i
in	c
my	c
opinion	c
go	i
shopping	c
can	c
be	c
stressing	i
and	c
disgusting	c
.	c

Thirdly	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
pray	c
to	i
find	i
the	c
right	c
size	c
and	c
once	c
you	c
've	c
got	c
it	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
think	i
Does	i
it	i
fits	i
me	i
?	i

And	c
after	c
all	c
of	c
this	c
it	c
's	c
important	c
when	c
you	c
're	c
going	c
shopping	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
big	i
amount	c
of	c
money	c
or	c
you	c
will	c
end	c
stressed	i
,	c
disgusted	c
,	c
and	c
depressed	c

Dear	c
Ms	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
have	i
just	i
received	i
it	c
yesterday	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
California	c
in	c
the	c
U.S.A.	c
in	c
July	c
.	c

It	c
would	c
be	c
nice	i
and	i
safe	i
for	c
me	c
than	c
the	c
tents	c
.	c

The	c
activities	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
choose	c
the	i
swimming	c
and	c
sailing	c
.	c

Then	i
I	i
can	i
prepare	i
my	c
clothes	c
,	c
or	c
can	c
we	c
buy	c
some	c
clothes	c
there	c
?	c

I	c
would	c
be	c
greatful	i
if	c
you	c
could	c
send	c
me	c
the	c
full	c
details	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
very	i
important	c
thing	c
for	c
our	c
life	c
.	c

In	c
suppermarket	i
,	c
shop	c
,	i
department	c
store	c
have	i
many	c
things	c
.	c

We	c
could	c
buy	c
mostly	i
all	c
we	c
need	c
in	c
one	c
store	c
.	c

Most	c
people	c
enjoy	c
shopping	c
because	c
it	c
more	i
convenien	i
for	i
today	c
but	c
if	c
you	c
found	c
the	i
busy	c
place	c
for	c
shopping	c
or	c
it	c
is	i
not	c
as	c
good	c
as	c
you	c
expect	i
.	c

It	c
would	c
not	c
enjoyable	i
for	c
you	c
.	c

We	c
had	c
been	c
told	c
that	c
discounts	c
to	i
the	c
ticket-prices	i
were	c
possible	i
but	c
at	i
the	c
evening	c
of	c
the	c
show	c
no	c
discounts	c
or	c
special	c
offers	c
whatsoever	c
were	c
offered	c
.	c

So	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
leave	c
hungry	c
and	c
with	c
a	c
certain	c
feeling	c
of	c
frustration	c
and	c
disappointment	c
.	c

Honestly	c
for	c
us	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
that	c
"	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
"	c
.	c

"	c
The	c
old	c
man	c
and	c
the	c
Sea	c
"	c

I	c
suppose	c
you	c
still	c
wonder	c
what	c
the	c
great	c
authors	c
can	c
do	c
for	c
us	c
?	c

A	c
story	c
of	c
an	c
old	c
seaman	c
leaving	c
his	c
town	c
to	c
proove	i
that	c
he	c
is	c
still	c
able	c
to	c
catch	c
the	c
biggest	c
fish	c
ever	c
caught	c
.	c

So	c
did	c
he	c
finally	c
win	c
or	c
loose	c
?	c

Kind	c

be	i

other	c
people	c
and	c
pay	c
attention	c
for	i
the	c

life	c
because	c
sometimes	c
it	i
can	c
help	c
us	c
very	c

I	c
would	c

like	c
to	c
suggest	c
idea	i
and	c
change	c

It	c
was	c
such	c
a	c
wonderful	c
story	c
that	c
I	c
remember	c
the	c
old	c
man	c
speaking	c
about	c
human	c
's	c
life	c
between	c
the	c
sea	c
and	c
the	c
man	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
,	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
,	c
but	c
she	c
was	c
her	c
best	c
friend	c
and	c
she	c
had	c
to	c
trust	c
her	c
.	c

Anna	c
told	c
her	c
again	c
:	c
"	c
Pat	c
do	c
n't	c
tell	c
it	i
to	i
anyone	c
please	c
,	c
especially	c
to	i
my	c
brother	c
everything	i
will	i
be	i
ruin	i
then	c
"	c
.	c

and	i
Pat	c
answered	c
:	c
"	c
Do	c
n't	c
wory	i
I	c
wo	c
n't	c
tell	c
anyone	c
"	c
.	c

The	c
big	c
secret	c
was	c
that	c
Anna	c
was	c
prearing	i
a	c
suprice	i
party	c
for	c
her	c
brother	c
,	i
John	c
and	c
she	c
did	c
n't	c
want	c
anyone	c
to	c
know	c
about	c
it	c
.	c

She	c
had	c
told	c
it	i
to	i
Pat	c
though	c
and	c
that	c
was	c
extremely	c
dangerous	c
!	c

The	c
party	c
was	c
set	c
up	i
to	c
be	c
in	c
two	c
days	c
.	c

The	c
3rd	c
of	c
July	c
will	c
suit	c
to	i
me	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
more	c
convinient	i
for	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
glad	c
I	c
can	c
chose	i
two	c
activities	c
while	c
I	c
will	i
at	c
the	c
Camp	c
.	c

I	c
've	c
never	c
done	c
it	c
before	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	i

Every	c
new	c
day	c
is	c
not	c
the	c
same	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
good	c
shopping	c
depends	c
on	c
ourself	i
.	c

If	c
we	c
decided	i
to	c
by	i
somthing	i
special	c
and	c
we	c
have	c
enough	c
money	c
for	c
it	c
we	c
have	c
to	c
go	c
and	c
buy	c
it	c
.	c

Some	i
times	i
we	c
have	c
to	i
have	i
deal	i
with	c
not	i
good	i
service	c
or	c
for	i
example	c
could	i
you	c
imagine	c
it	i
on	i
your	i
way	i
to	i
shop	i
you	i
have	i
met	i
wrong	i
people	i
or	c
someone	c
told	i
you	c
bad	c
news	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
express	c
my	c
extreme	c
dissatisfaction	c
with	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
'	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
'	c
that	c
recently	c
took	c
place	c
in	c
The	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
annoyed	c
by	c
the	c
fact	c
that	c
the	c
event	c
had	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
-	c
not	c
19:30	c
as	c
mentioned	i
in	c
the	c
advertisment	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
receiving	c
a	c
response	c
in	c
the	c
near	c
future	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

I	c
guess	c
it	c
was	c
that	c
thrill	c
that	c
actually	c
made	c
me	c
anxious	c
to	c
know	c
what	c
really	c
was	c
going	c
on	c
inside	c
the	c
dodgy-looking	c
old	c
house	c
guarded	c
by	c
a	c
man	c
with	c
an	c
unfriendly	c
hound	c
.	c

But	c
knowing	c
what	c
these	c
people	c
are	c
capable	c
of	c
makes	c
me	c
doubt	i
wether	i
to	c
use	c
it	c
or	c
not	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
n't	c
be	c
surprised	c
if	c
suddenly	c
something	c
bad	c
happened	c
to	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
on	i
July	c
because	c
is	i
the	c
perfect	c
time	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
camp	c
and	c
is	i
summer	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

another	i
good	c
thing	c
was	c
that	c
all	c
the	c
people	c
wants	i
to	c
be	c
in	c
your	c
place	c
and	c
they	c
were	c
very	c
jealous	c
about	i
me	c
.	c

Competitor	c
Organiser	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
in	i
replay	i
to	c
the	c
letter	c
I	c
have	c
recently	c
recived	i
,	c
to	c
inform	c
you	c
about	c
some	c
details	c
that	c
I	c
am	c
concerned	c
about	c
.	c

In	c
your	c
letter	c
you	c
settled	i
the	c
possibility	c
to	i
choose	i
two	c
activities	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
let	c
you	c
know	c
that	c
I	c
would	c
be	c
pleased	c
if	c
I	c
could	c
join	c
to	i
basketball	c
and	c
climbing	c
,	c
as	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
both	c
of	c
them	c
due	i
to	i
I	i
've	i
played	i
in	i
my	c
secondary	c
scholl	i
as	c
leader	i
of	c
my	i
team	c
and	c
due	c
to	c
my	c
long	c
training	c
periods	i
in	i
lifting	c
weights	c
.	c

Suppose	c
you	c
go	c
shopping	c
with	c
your	c
girlfriend	c
,	c
that	c
means	c
that	c
you	c
will	c
have	c
to	c
spend	c
hours	c
walking	c
behind	c
her	c
from	c
one	c
shop	c
to	c
another	c
and	c
during	c
the	c
time	c
that	c
she	c
is	c
trying	c
the	c
items	c
on	c
,	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
bear	c
with	i
the	c
odds	c
faces	c
of	c
the	c
other	c
women	c
looking	c
at	c
you	c
as	c
if	c
you	c
were	c
an	c
alien	c
into	i
their	c
territory	c
.	c

Your	c
first	c
question	c
was	c
about	c
when	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
really	c
difficult	c
choose	i
two	c
activities	c
from	c
that	c
list	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
wondering	c
which	i
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
we	c
need	c
and	c
what	c
about	c
money	c
and	c
meals	c
,	i
Are	c
they	c
provided	c
?	c
or	i
can	c
we	c
find	c
some	c
places	c
to	c
buy	c
it	i
?	c

I	c
suppose	c
it	i
's	i
everything	c
that	c
you	c
need	c
from	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
,	c
again	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
shopping	c
is	c
a	c
subject	i
really	i
up	i
to	i
date	i
.	c

I	c
can	c
say	c
that	c
nowadays	c
is	i
growing	i
up	i
very	c
quickly	c
in	c
our	c
society	c
like	i
a	c
kind	c
of	c
sport	c
or	c
hobby	c
to	i
waste	c
or	c
spend	c
the	i
free	c
time	c
.	c

And	c
it	c
's	c
creating	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
adict	i
people	c
,	c
call	i
"	c
shopalcoholics	i
"	c
.	c

Otherwise	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

You	c
can	c
spend	c
hours	c
and	c
hours	c
going	i
shopping	c
and	c
not	c
find	c
what	c
you	c
were	i
looking	c
for	c
,	c
perhaps	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
not	c
your	i
size	c
or	c
the	c
colour	c
that	c
you	c
like	c
,	c
or	c
just	c
nothing	c
is	c
suitable	c
to	i
you	c
.	c

After	c
that	c
,	c
the	i
unfriendly	c
and	c
sometime	i
's	i
unpolite	i
shop	c
assistance	i
who	c
breaks	i
your	c
nerves	c
down	i
.	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
:	c

I	c
am	c
writting	i
to	c
you	c
because	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
very	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
at	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
.	c

It	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
!	c

I	c
forgot	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
that	c
there	c
were	c
no	c
available	i
discounts	i
.	c

As	i
a	i
matter	i
of	i
fact	i
,	c
when	c
the	c
musical	i
show	c
was	c
over	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
really	c
hungry	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
asked	c
someone	c
who	c
seemed	c
to	c
be	c
in	c
charge	c
,	c
and	c
he	c
told	c
me	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
too	c
late	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
meal	c
.	c

Well	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
is	c
all	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
will	c
ask	c
you	c
to	c
give	c
my	i
money	c
back	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
attending	c
college	c
,	c
as	c
I	c
normally	c
do	c
.	c

With	c
nothing	c
to	c
lose	c
,	c
at	c
all	c
,	c
but	c
on	c
the	c
contrary	c
,	c
with	c
a	c
lot	c
to	c
learn	c
from	i
.	c

His	c
name	c
was	c
Cody	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
know	c
what	c
to	c
do	c
.	c

Pat	c
suggested	c
me	i
to	i
talk	i
to	c
him	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
really	c
did	c
n't	c
managed	i
to	c
do	c
so	c
.	c

I	c
can	c
say	c
that	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
nervious	i
or	i
anxious	c
about	c
what	c
was	c
going	c
to	c
happen	c
.	c

He	c
did	c
n't	c
kept	i
my	c
secret	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
on	i
July	c
because	c
I	c
will	c
I	i
have	c
finished	c
my	c
exams	c
by	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
June	c
.	c

I	c
will	c
not	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
travel	c
on	i
August	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
found	c
a	c
job	c
for	c
that	c
month	c
.	c

I	c
also	c
think	c
that	c
the	c
log	c
cabin	c
will	c
be	c
much	c
more	c
confortable	i
than	c
the	c
tent	c
.	c

I	c
play	i
basketball	c
since	c
I	c
was	c
twelve	c
years	c
old	c
and	c
I	c
am	i
member	i
of	c
the	c
basketball	i
school	i
team	c
for	c
four	c
years	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	i

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

If	c
I	c
have	c
the	c
opportunity	c
next	c
month	c
I	c
really	c
want	c
to	c
go	c
back	c
.	c

Kelly	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c

After	i
that	i
,	c
the	c
time	c
that	c
the	c
show	c
should	i
start	i
was	c
19:30	c
but	c
it	c
started	c
fortyfive	i
minutes	c
later	c
.	c

People	c
have	i
been	i
started	c
to	c
complain	c
.	c

What	c
about	c
the	c
available	i
discounts	c
.	i

They	c
were	i
not	c
exist	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	i
return	i
to	i
me	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
Beth	c
,	i
asked	c
Jane	c
if	c
she	c
is	i
in	c
love	c
with	c
Brian	c
and	c
she	c
said	c
that	c
she	c
was	c
.	c

Jane	c
and	c
Brian	c
were	c
very	c
happy	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
of	i
my	c
understanding	c
that	c
discounts	c
were	c
available	c
on	c
the	c
tickets	c
,	c
as	c
the	c
advertisement	c
showed	c
,	c
but	c
there	c
were	c
no	c
discounts	c
.	c

Looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
,	c

But	c
I	c
soon	c
knew	c
it	c
because	c
when	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
school	c
canteen	c
everybody	c
was	c
staring	c
at	c
me	c
and	c
whispering	c
to	c
eachother	i
.	c

Suddenly	c
my	c
face	c
went	c
all	c
red	c
and	c
I	c
ran	c
towards	c
the	c
toilet	c
.	c

That	c
day	c
I	c
swore	c
to	c
myself	c
that	c
I	c
would	c
never	c
trust	c
anybody	c
again	c
.	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c

Competition	c
Organiser	c

I	c
agree	c
with	i
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

I	c
my	c
view	c
,	c
is	i
more	c
enjoyable	c
do	i
others	i
things	c
than	c
go	i
to	i
shopping	c
because	c
,	c
maybe	c
"	i
you	c
lose	i
your	c
money	c
"	c
.	c

However	c
it	i
's	i
just	c
the	c
begining	i
of	c
the	c
problems	c
we	c
had	c
.	c

People	c
have	c
seen	c
in	c
the	c
last	c
10	c
years	c
how	c
diferent	i
our	c
clothes	c
had	i
become	c
to	i
.	c

Clothes	c
that	i
used	c
to	c
be	c
made	c
of	c
coton	i
,	c
but	c
nowadays	c
we	c
can	c
see	c
shirts	c
,	c
pants	c
socks	i
....	c
made	c
of	c
almost	c
everything	i
.	c

It	c
is	c
a	c
revolution	c
in	c
the	i

Dear	c
madame	i

I	c
'm	c
very	c
surprised	c
about	c
the	c
good	c
news	c
and	c
I	c
'm	c
sure	c
I	c
'll	c
really	c
have	c
a	c
good	c
time	c
in	c
California	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
a	c
good	c
swimmer	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
in	c
the	c
Californian	c
See	i
.	c

On	i
the	i
contrary	i
,	c
I	c
'm	c
an	c
absolute	c
beginner	c
in	i
playing	c
tennis	c
and	c
I	c
'm	c
not	c
fit	c
in	i
running	c
but	c
I	c
chose	c
it	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
sport	c
I	c
've	c
always	c
wanted	c
to	c
learn	c
BUT	c
I	c
'VE	c
NEVER	c
HAD	c
enough	c
free	c
time	c
.	c

What	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
am	c
I	c
supposed	c
to	c
bring	c
with	c
me	c
?	c

Yours	c
sincerily	i

That	c
's	c
why	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
an	c
easy	c
thing	c
to	c
do	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
go	c
shopping	c
I	c
always	c
have	c
to	c
ask	c
for	c
the	c
extra-large	c
size	c
and	c
harder	i
to	c
find	c
it	c
.	c

Just	c
think	c
about	c
commercials	c
.	c

They	c
're	c
full	c
of	c
perfect	c
people	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
the	c
reason	c
that	c
we	c
decided	c
to	c
do	i
this	c
party	c
was	c
because	c
Mr	c
Brown	c
helped	c
to	i
the	c
organisation	c
of	c
our	c
trip	c
to	c
France	c
.	c

Also	c
,	c
the	i
drinks	i
we	i
will	i
take	i
them	i
from	c
our	c
canteen	c
and	c
there	c
will	c
be	c
a	c
group	c
of	c
mucisians	i
for	c
our	c
entertainment	c
.	c

We	i
should	i
buy	c
a	c
book	c
or	c
a	c
Cd	i
player	i
.	i

I	c
was	c
draw	i
6:30	i
p.m	i
in	i
the	i
company	i
.	c

I	c
cannot	i
believe	c
it	c
.	c

Sir	i
manager	c
of	c
the	c
theatre	c
,	c

With	c
a	c
friend	i
we	i
had	c
seen	c
your	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
witch	i
was	i
very	c
attractive	c
.	c

Unfortunatly	i
,	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
did	i
n't	i
go	i
like	i
the	i
advertisement	i
explained	i
,	c
and	c
that	c
wise	i
I	c
wont	i
ask	i
you	c
some	i
money	c
back	c
.	c

The	c
starring	i
had	c
been	c
changed	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
had	c
started	c
only	i
at	c
20:15	c
,	c
and	c
there	c
were	c
no	c
discounts	c
available	c
.	c

And	c
your	c
last	c
phrasal	i
of	i
the	c
advertisement	c
"	i
Your	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
"	c
!	c
it	i
was	c
n't	c
at	i
all	c
,	c
like	i
I	c
have	c
explain	i
you	i
above	c
in	c
this	c
letter	c
.	c

At	i
the	i
began	c
of	i
my	i
work	i
in	c
a	i
Insurance	c
Company	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
only	c
a	i
old	c
writting	i
machine	i
,	c
witch	i
makes	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
noise	c
and	c
was	c
very	c
difficult	c
to	c
write	c
with	c
it	i
because	c
the	c
switch	i
were	c
hard	c
for	i
my	c
small	c
fingers	c
.	c

Also	c
now	c
for	i
write	i
a	i
letter	i
to	i
a	i
friend	i
overland	i
it	i
is	i
better	i
with	i
Internet	i
.	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
getting	c
sun-tanned	c
under	c
the	c
sun	c
in	c
California	c
.	c

I	c
'd	c
prefer	c
to	c
say	c
in	c
log	c
cabins	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
very	c
difficult	c
to	c
choose	c
only	c
two	c
of	c
those	c
fascinating	c
activities	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
made	c
a	c
decision	c
,	c
which	c
is	c
Golf	c
and	c
Photography	c
.	c

Since	c
my	c
hobby	c
is	c
taking	c
photos	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
interested	c
in	c
this	c
field	c
and	c
have	c
studied	c
by	c
myself	c
about	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
remember	c
that	c
you	c
asked	c
me	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
about	c
that	c
job	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
quite	c
terrible	c
when	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
let	i
people	c
leave	c
,	c
because	c
all	c
tickets	c
were	c
sold	c
out	c
.	c

Stay	c
pretty	c
and	c
lovely	c
!	c

Kisses	c
from	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
.	i

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
we	c
went	c
to	c
ticket	i
office	c
to	c
get	c
the	c
tickets	c
.	c

eventually	i
,	c
we	c
got	c
the	c
tickets	c
,	c
Because	i
we	c
would	i
like	i
to	c
see	c
the	c
musical	c
and	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
.	c

Because	c
the	i
different	c
actor	c
played	i
the	i
musical	c
that	c
day	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
if	c
the	c
musical	c
start	i
late	c
time	i
,	c
you	c
should	c
open	i
the	c
restaurant	c
until	i
late	c
time	i
.	c

To	c
tell	c
the	c
truth	c
,	c
we	c
could	c
n't	c
enjoy	c
our	c
evening	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

We	c
had	c
a	c
secret	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
ship	c
!	c
!	c

One	c
day	c
,	c
Suddenly	i
,	c
heavy	i
storm	c
came	c
our	i
town	c
.	c

We	c
worried	c
about	c
it	c
and	c
we	c
tryed	i
to	c
pull	i
it	c
.	c

Because	c
Pat	c
called	i
them	c
.	c

Where	c
do	c
you	c
think	c
?	i

During	c
my	c
stay	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
musical	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
.	c

First	c
the	c
advertisement	c
said	c
that	c
there	c
were	c
discounts	c
available	c
but	c
there	c
were	c
not	c
.	c

Very	c
disappointing	c
as	i
Danny	c
Brook	c
is	c
my	c
favourite	c
actor	c
.	c

Afterwards	c
we	c
wanted	c
to	c
go	c
for	c
a	c
pleasent	i
dinner	c
.	c

Fashion	c
of	c
the	c
future	c

lausanne	c
,	c
the	c
17th	c
of	c
June	c
2000	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
's	c
really	c
not	c
correct	i
.	c

After	c
this	c
bad	c
show	c
we	c
had	c
want	i
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
Restaurant	c
for	c
drunk	i
and	c
ate	i
something	c
and	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
and	c
nobody	c
had	i
explained	i
us	i
why	c
the	c
Restaurant	c
was	c
n't	c
open	c
.	c

She	c
is	c
very	c
friendly	c
but	c
she	c
ca	c
n't	c
keep	c
a	c
secret	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
ask	c
for	c
some	c
queries	c
about	c
your	c
letter	c
which	c
I	c
have	c
received	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
could	c
you	c
make	c
an	c
arrangement	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
,	c
because	c
it	c
seems	c
that	c
living	c
in	c
log	c
cabins	c
is	c
more	c
exciting	c
than	c
in	c
tents	c
.	c

Also	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
go	c
swimming	c
and	c
surfing	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
used	c
to	c
be	c
an	c
assistant	c
in	c
a	c
Korean	c
national	c
pool	c
so	i
that	i
I	c
am	c
good	c
at	c
swimming	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
tried	c
to	i
go	i
surfing	c
.	c

That	c
is	c
why	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
do	c
that	c
.	c

How	c
's	c
your	c
new	c
flat	c
?	c

Anyway	c
,	c
I	c
'll	c
tell	c
you	c
about	c
my	c
wonderful	c
experience	c
which	c
I	c
enjoyed	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
.	c

You	c
know	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
studied	c
English	c
for	c
two	c
years	c
in	c
England	c
.	c

That	c
's	c
why	c
I	c
could	c
attend	c
to	i
that	c
concert	c
as	c
a	c
volunteer	c
,	c
because	c
they	c
needed	c
people	c
who	c
could	c
speak	c
English	c
very	c
well	c
.	c

if	c
it	c
's	c
possible	c

of	c

In	i
the	c
accomodation	i
at	c

,	c
he	i
is	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
more	c
funny	i
,	c

The	c
motor	i
bike	i
club	c
of	i
our	c
town	c
organized	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
.	c

They	c
were	c
all	c
very	c
kind	c
and	c
with	c
some	c
of	c
them	c
I	c
spent	c
the	c
rest	c
of	c
the	c
evening	c
and	c
also	c
the	c
following	c
day	c
.	c

Love	c
,	c

I	c
have	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
that	c
for	i
me	i
it	i
is	i
only	i
possible	i
to	c
go	c
on	c
holiday	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
my	c
father	c
is	c
very	c
ill	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
only	c
possible	c
for	c
my	c
sister	c
to	c
take	c
care	c
of	c
him	c
in	c
July	c
(	c
because	c
her	c
small	c
children	c
are	c
in	c
summer	c
school	c
at	c
this	i
time	c
.	c

Singing	c
is	c
one	c
of	c
my	c
favourite	c
activities	c
and	c
I	c
know	c
that	c
I	c
do	c
it	c
very	c
well	c
.	c

I	c
'd	c
be	c
very	c
happy	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
give	c
me	c
a	c
call	c
and	c
answer	c
this	i
questions	c
.	c

Last	c
month	c
I	c
received	c
a	c
letter	c
which	c
told	c
me	c
that	c
I	i
've	i
entered	i
a	c
competition	c
.	c

My	c
price	i
was	c
the	c
chance	c
to	c
meet	c
a	c
pop	c
group	c
and	c
to	c
help	c
at	c
the	i
concert	c
.	c

At	c
5	c
pm	c
the	c
band	c
members	c
disappeared	c
again	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
responsible	c
for	c
some	c
kind	c
of	c
guiding	i
tour	c
for	c
the	c
journalists	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
to	c
show	c
them	c
the	c
way	c
to	c
the	c
interviewing	c
room	c
.	c

At	c
7	c
p.m.	c
the	c
first	c
group	c
started	c
.	c

This	c
was	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
best	c
and	c
most	c
exciting	c
days	c
in	i
my	c
life	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
happy	c
to	c
take	c
part	c
in	c
the	c
competition	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
all	c
the	c
information	c
you	c
need	c
:	c

Secondly	c
,	c
if	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
mind	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
sleep	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
.	c

Although	c
it	c
is	c
not	c
very	c
comfortable	c
,	c
I	c
like	c
camping	c
very	c
much	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
asked	i
to	c
write	c
a	c
composition	c
regarding	c
the	c
questionit	i
is	c
believed	c
that	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
queue	c
for	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
to	c
get	c
a	c
free	c
cabin	i
and	c
waste	c
of	i
time	c
putting	c
on	c
some	c
clothes	c
and	i
in	c
the	c
end	c
they	c
are	c
not	c
the	c
right	c
size	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
easy	c
to	c
spend	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
money	c
in	c
few	i
minutes	c
and	c
as	i
soon	i
as	i
you	i
can	i
regret	i
to	i
buy	i
all	c
these	i
clothes	c
,	i
which	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
really	c
need	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
not	c
easy	c
to	c
get	c
a	c
refund	c
or	c
to	c
change	c
them	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
doing	i
shopping	c
bring	i
me	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
satisfaction	c
especially	c
I	i
am	c
depressed	c
,	i
nevertheless	i
it	c
could	c
be	c
very	c
dangerous	c
for	c
my	c
wallet	c
.	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
glad	c
to	c
hear	c
from	c
you	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
reply	c
and	c
ask	c
you	c
some	c
questions	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
for	i
the	c
accomodation	i
,	c
I	c
would	c
say	c
I	c
prefer	c
living	c
in	c
tent	i
rather	c
than	c
in	c
log	i
cabin	c
because	c
I	c
used	c
to	c
sleep	c
in	c
tent	i
while	i
I	c
was	c
joining	i
a	i
local	c
scout	c
camp	c
in	c
my	c
country	c
.	c

Thirdly	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
choosen	i
Sailing	c
and	c
Photography	c
from	c
the	c
list	c
you	c
gave	c
me	c
because	c
both	c
of	c
them	c
are	c
my	c
favorite	i
hobbies	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
enjoying	c
Sailing	c
and	c
Photography	c
for	c
several	c
years	c
so	c
I	c
am	c
quite	c
good	c
at	c
both	c
of	c
them	c
.	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

In	i
my	i
opinion	i
,	i
I	i
do	i
agree	i
with	c
this	c
expression	i
.	c

I	i
've	i
read	c
your	c
advertisement	c
and	c
it	c
did	c
n't	c
say	i
the	c
truth	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
n't	c
visit	c
the	c
theatre	c
after	c
the	c
performance	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
for	c
reparations	i
.	c

In	i
that	c
time	c
I	c
used	c
the	c
computer	c
only	c
to	c
play	c
with	i
its	i
video	c
games	c
.	c

It	c
became	c
scencial	i
to	c
do	i
my	c
homework	c
.	c

The	i
modern	i
technology	c
is	c
better	c
now	c
than	c
what	i
it	c
used	c
to	c
be	c
.	c

What	c
do	c
you	c
think	c
about	c
this	c
?	c

I	c
'm	c
sure	c
that	c
these	c
arguments	c
have	c
explained	c
my	c
point	c
of	c
view	c
,	c
have	c
n't	c
they	c
?	c

Ryan	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c

and	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
pleased	c
that	c
I	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
compition	i

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
California	c
in	c
June	c
if	c
his	i
is	c
possible	c
because	c
I	c
will	c
have	c
finished	c
my	c
course	c
in	c
Merton	c
college	c
at	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
June	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
staying	i
in	c
a	c
tent	c
rather	c
than	c
staying	c
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
have	c
experience	i
,	i
which	c
I	c
have	c
n't	c
had	c
before	c

To	c

Mrs.	c
Sexington	c

The	c
aim	c
of	c
this	c
report	c
is	c
to	c
describe	c
our	c
English	c
classes	c
in	c
Merton	c
College	c
and	c
suggest	c
that	i
what	c
we	c
should	c
film	c
for	c

Misses	i
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
giving	c
me	c
the	c
oportunity	i
to	c
travel	c
.	c

Travelling	c
in	c
July	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
say	c
,	c
would	c
be	c
perfect	c
for	c
me	c
because	c
I	i
have	i
got	i
my	i
birtday	i
the	c
24th	c
of	c
this	i
month	c
and	c
I	c
wish	c
I	i
could	i
spend	i
my	c
birtday	i
as	i
well	i
as	i
possible	c
,	c
so	c
it	i
means	c
there	c
.	c

I	c
also	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
sleep	c
into	i
tents	c
which	i
are	c
more	c
comfortable	c
and	i
,	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
doing	c
lots	c
of	c
campings	i
,	c
I	c
am	c
quite	c
used	c
to	c
this	c
kind	c
of	c
accomodation	i
.	c

I	c
may	i
have	c
a	c
question	c
for	c
you	c
to	c
answer	c
,	i
please	c
could	c
you	c
tell	c
my	i
how	c
much	c
money	c
do	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
bring	c
with	c
me	c
?	c

However	i
it	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
,	c
people	c
are	c
shopping	c
more	c
and	c
more	c
,	i
it	i
is	c
very	c
fashionable	c
those	i
times	i
.	c

They	c
do	c
not	c
always	c
buy	c
lots	c
of	c
things	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
think	c
most	c
of	c
them	c
do	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
people	c
either	c
go	c
shopping	c
to	i
change	i
mind	i
because	c
they	c
may	c
have	c
lots	c
of	c
problems	c
or	c
to	c
meet	c
other	c
people	c
,	c
to	c
feel	c
they	c
belong	c
to	c
a	c
group	c
of	c
human	c
being	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
.	c

We	c
felt	c
very	c
disappointed	c
when	c
we	c
discovered	c
that	c
Danny	c
had	c
been	c
replaced	c
by	c
an	c
unknown	c
and	c
really	c
bad	c
actor	c
.	c

Not	c
only	c
was	c
the	c
show	c
late	c
and	c
awful	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
expensive	c
too	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
now	c
because	c
I	c
've	c
been	c
told	c
that	c
is	i
going	i
to	i
be	i
read	i
on	i
the	i
radio	i
a	i
short	i
story	i
by	i
Agatha	i
Christie	i
.	c

It	c
's	c
a	c
story	c
titled	i
Accident	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
you	c
'll	c
enjoy	c
it	c
.	c

That	c
woman	c
is	c
supposed	c
to	c
have	c
killed	c
her	c
husbands	c
(	c
at	c
least	c
two	c
)	c
,	c
because	c
she	c
wanted	c
their	c
money	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
end	c
,	c
the	c
three	c
of	c
them	c
are	c
having	c
a	c

Dear	c
Sirs	c

We	c
have	c
spent	c
a	c
week	c
's	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
and	c
wanted	c
to	c
see	c
a	c
musical	c
show	i
.	c

So	c
we	c
asked	i
you	c
for	c
our	c
money	c
back	c

I	c
looking	i
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c

Yours	c
Sincerely	c

We	c
are	c
too	c
reliable	i
at	i
technology	c
today	c

But	c
we	c
can	c
ask	c
us	i
"	i
What	c
will	c
be	i
happen	c
in	c
50	c
years	c
?	c

Dear	c
Sir	c

Maybe	c
,	c
I	i
could	i
be	i
a	c
good	c
way	c
to	c
get	c
spectators	i
but	c
I	c
'm	c
going	c
to	c

that	i
to	i
my	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c

so	c
she	c
lost	c
all	c
her	c

Pat	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
,	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
really	c
looking	c

to	c
seeing	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
but	c
actually	i
,	c
starting	i
was	i
not	i
Danny	c
Brook	c
but	c
another	c
person	c
.	c

Besides	c
her	i
acting	c
did	c
n't	c
make	i
me	i
satisfied	i
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
starting	i
time	c
was	c
not	c
19:30	c

20:15	c

Fashion	c

Also	c
,	c
comfortable	c

maintain	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
.	c

To	c
make	c
matters	c
worse	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
at	c
20.15	c
,	c
although	c
the	c
advertisement	c
was	i
saying	i
it	c
would	c
begin	c
at	c
19.30	c
.	c

And	c
on	i
the	i
top	i
of	i
everything	i
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
waiters	c
'	c
strike	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
look	c
for	c
another	c
place	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
snack	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
will	c
give	c
this	c
matter	c
your	c
immediate	c
consideration	c

Otherwise	c
I	c
'll	c
have	c
to	c

On	c
the	c
one	c
hand	c
,	c
science	c
and	c

have	c
been	c
developing	c
rapidly	c
,	c
and	c
God	c
knows	c
what	c
new	c
materials	c
will	c
be	c
invented	c
in	c

Of	c
course	c
,	c
those	i
new	c
material	i
wo	c
n't	c
be	c
so	c
harmful	c
for	i
our	c

other	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
of	c
Madam	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
musical	c
show	i
which	c
was	c
presented	i
by	i
The	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
last	c
week	c
.	c

I	c
saw	c
the	c
performance	c
and	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
like	i
it	c
was	c
mentioned	i
in	c
the	c
advertisent	i
I	c
read	c
in	c
the	c
local	c
newspaper	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
the	c
main	c
actor	c
was	c
not	c
Dany	c
Brook	c
as	c
it	i
was	c
expected	c
so	i
.	c

Secondly	c
it	c
must	i
have	i
started	c
at	c
14.30	c
and	c
ended	c
by	c
19.30	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
would	c
be	c
greatful	i
if	c
you	c
payed	i
for	c
a	c
full	c
refund	c
of	c
the	c
money	c
I	c
spent	c
in	i
the	c
tickets	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

And	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
even	c
think	c
about	i
how	i
it	c
would	c
be	c
not	i
having	c
a	c
computer	c
.	c

Another	c
advatage	i
is	c
that	c
,	c
for	c
example	c
sattelite	i
television	c
,	c
which	c
is	c
an	c
example	c
of	c
modern	c
technology	c
,	c
makes	i
me	c
be	i
informed	c
about	c
what	c
is	c
happening	c
on	i
the	c
whole	c
world	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
to	c
that	c
,	c
technology	c
does	i
n't	i
sometimes	i
let	c
me	c
develop	c
my	c
imagination	c
and	c
creative	c
skills	c
.	c

To	c
sump	i
up	c
,	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
think	c
about	i
how	i
my	c
life	c
would	c
be	c
without	i
technology	c
.	c

June	c
,	c
the	c
13th	c
2000	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
must	c
precise	i
that	c
I	c
can	c
only	c
leave	c
during	c
the	c
month	c
of	c
July	c
owing	c
to	c
the	i
job	c
I	c
obtained	i
for	c
August	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
have	c
no	c
doubt	c
about	c
my	c
taste	c
for	c
camping	c
,	c
however	c
I	i
admit	c
I	c
will	c
appreciate	c
a	c
bit	c
of	c
comfort	c
two	i
weeks	i
long	i
.	c

Even	c
if	c
the	c
photograph	i
made	i
are	c
modest	c
work	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
really	c
interested	c
in	c
this	c
activity	c
.	c

Then	c
,	c
as	c
low	c
my	i
level	c
of	c
basketball	i
is	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
enjoyed	c
playing	c
this	c
sport	c
for	c
fun	c
for	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
.	c

What	c
obviously	i
appears	i
about	c
our	c
daily	c
life	c
at	c
school	c
is	c
that	c
it	c
is	c
hard	c
to	c
sum	c
up	c
all	c
the	c
different	c
aspects	c
it	c
includes	c
.	c

Therefore	c
,	c
the	c
film	c
will	c
manage	c
to	c
be	c
a	c
success	c
if	c
it	c
does	c
n't	c
forget	c
the	c
main	c
times	i
that	c
make	c
our	c
life	c
.	c

To	c
my	c
mind	c
,	c
the	c
class	c
attending	c
a	c
lesson	c
must	c
be	c
shown	c
at	i
first	c
.	c

It	c
would	c
not	c
only	c
emphasize	c
the	c
sharp	c
contrast	c
with	i
the	i
classroom	c
atmosphear	i
but	c
also	c
show	c
how	c
they	c
are	c
as	c
young	c
people	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
two	c
moments	c
could	c
have	c
a	c
role	c
.	c

As	c
if	c
this	c
was	c
not	c
enough	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
instead	c
of	c
starting	c
at	c
half	c
past	c
seven	c
as	c
the	c
advertisement	c
said	c
,	c
started	c
at	c
a	c
quarter	c
past	c
eight	c
and	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
main	c
actors	c
,	c
who	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
be	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
was	c
someone	c
else	c
.	c

You	c
can	c
imagine	c
how	c
dissappointed	i
I	c
felt	c
after	c
that	c
evening	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
for	c
a	c
further	i
return	i
of	c
part	c
of	c
the	c
money	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

In	c
music	c
,	c
before	c
having	i
a	c
computer	c
I	c
could	c
only	c
write	c
my	c
compositions	c
and	c
'	c
listen	c
'	c
to	c
them	c
into	i
my	c
mind	c
,	c
because	c
,	c
of	c
course	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
n't	c
got	c
an	c
orchestra	c
to	c
play	c
them	c
,	c
but	c
now	c
I	c
just	i
can	i
record	c
one	c
part	c
,	c
and	c
then	c
another	c
part	c
,	c
and	c
then	c
another	c
one.	c
.	c

and	c
I	c
can	c
get	c
the	c
sound	c
of	c
every	c
instrument	c
controlling	i
it	c
with	c
a	c
keyboard	c
,	c
or	c
even	c
create	c
new	c
sounds	c
.	c

But	c
,	c
in	c
other	c
things	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
modern	c
technology	c
has	c
n't	c
changed	c
my	c
way	i
of	i
living	i
too	c
much	c
:	c
I	c
do	c
more	c
or	c
less	c
the	c
same	c
as	c
I	c
did	c
some	c
years	c
ago	c
:	c
I	c
get	c
up	c
in	c
the	c
morning	c
,	c
go	c
to	c
school	c
,	c
have	c
lunch	c
,	c
study	c
and	c
go	c
out	c
with	c
my	c
friends	c
without	c
being	c
afected	i
by	c
microchips	c
or	c
nuclear	c
energy	c
.	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

Now	c
to	c
answer	c
your	c
questions	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
only	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
that	c
's	c
the	c
only	c
period	i
of	c
the	c
year	c
I	c
can	c
get	c
out	c
of	c
working	c
for	c
more	c
than	c
two	c
weeks	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
because	c
I	c
think	c
you	c
should	c
give	i
me	c
a	i
good	c
accommodation	c
and	c
not	c
just	c
a	c
tent	c
to	c
sleep	c
in	c
,	c
with	c
no	c
electricity	c
and	i
entertainment	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

You	c
should	c
have	c
been	c
here	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
amazing	c
.	c

Well	c
,	c
we	c
also	c
had	c
to	c
carry	c
all	c
the	c
instruments	c
up	c
to	i
the	c
stage	c
and	c
believe	i
me	c
,	c
that	c
was	c
the	c
hardest	c
bit	c
of	c
all	c
.	c

They	c
were	c
extremely	c
heavy	c
and	c
there	c
were	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
them	c
on	c
the	c
bus	c
.	c

Basilio	c
Romero	c

In	c
the	c
advertisement	c
I	c
read	c
that	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
started	i
in	c
the	c
show	c
but	c
when	c
I	c
got	c
there	c
I	c
realised	c
there	c
was	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
in	c
his	c
place	c
whose	c
acting	c
was	c
n't	c
good	c
enough	c
.	c

You	c
have	c
also	c
advertised	c
that	c
there	c
would	c
be	c
discounts	c
available	c
but	c
there	c
were	c
n't	c
and	c
that	c
we	c
could	c
visit	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
they	c
were	c
redecorating	c
it	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
advertisement	c
you	c
write	c
that	c
it	c
's	c
the	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
but	c
all	c
these	c
problems	c
made	c
my	c
evening	c
in	i
the	c
show	c
very	c
unpleasant	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
are	c
the	c
manager	c
of	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
you	c
should	c
try	c
to	c
avoid	c
this	i
sort	i
of	c
problems	c
in	c
future	c
shows	c
.	c

Clothes	c
will	c
be	c
bright	c
coloured	c
and	c
loose	c
.	c

Also	c
the	c
clothes	c
in	c
a	c
hundred	c
years	c
will	c
have	c
the	c
ability	c
to	c
cool	c
down	c
the	c
people	c
who	c
wear	c
them	c
in	c
the	c
summer	c
and	c
the	c
same	c
clothes	c
will	c
keep	c
them	c
warm	c
in	i
cold	c
winters	c
'	c
days	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs.	c
Ryan	c
,	c

It	c
's	c
very	c
nice	c
of	c
you	c
to	c
let	c
me	c
choose	c
my	c
favourite	c
activities	c
.	c

Anyway	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
some	c
questions	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
:	c
What	i
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
would	c
be	c
the	c
most	c
suitable	c
for	c
California	c
weather	c
in	c
summer	c
,	c
and	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
do	c
you	c
think	c
I	c
'll	c
need	c
?	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

But	c
the	c
most	c
exciting	c
part	c
was	c
meeting	c
the	c
band	c
,	c
mainly	c
the	c
singer	c
and	c
the	c
drummer	c
who	c
are	c
very	c
nice	c
and	c
also	c
good-looking	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
happy	c
to	c
win	c
this	c
prize	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
going	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
some	c
information	c
from	i
me	i
that	i
you	i
need	i
to	c
make	i
me	i
have	c
a	c
good	c
time	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	i
only	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
set	i
my	c
holidays	c
this	i
month	c
since	c
last	c
January	c
.	c

I	i
want	i
if	i
it	i
is	i
possible	i
a	c
log	i
cabins	i
like	i
accommodation	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
suffering	c
from	i
my	c
back	c
since	c
my	c
childhood	c
,	c
therefore	c
I	c
need	c
a	c
confortable	i
accommodation	i
.	c

I	c
will	c
be	c
pleased	c
to	c
swim	c
and	c
paint	c
when	c
I	c
am	c
at	c
the	c
camp	c
.	c

I	c
also	c
choosed	i
painting	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
done	c
before	i
,	i
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
learn	c
and	c
moreover	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
do	c
a	c
calm	i
activity	c
.	c

How	c
many	c
times	c
have	c
we	c
heard	c
people	c
complaining	c
about	c
shopping	c
?	c

but	c
why	c
?	c

Therefore	i
,	i
shopping	c
can	c
be	c
enjoyable	c
but	c
it	i
is	c
not	c
always	c
the	c
case	c
.	c

In	i
fact	i
you	c
try	c
to	c
get	c
a	c
present	c
to	c
make	c
receive	i
happy	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
if	c
you	c
want	c
a	c
new	c
track	c
suit	c
you	c
know	c
that	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
a	c
sport	i
shop	c
but	c
if	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
what	c
you	c
want	c
you	c
are	c
going	c
to	c
waste	c
your	c
time	c
in	c
the	c
shops	c
.	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
enjoyable	c
with	c
people	c
who	c
just	c
look	c
around	c
the	c
shops	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
stupid	c
,	i
they	i
do	c
not	c
have	c
any	c
goal	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
you	i
in	i
relation	i
to	i
our	c
next	c
programme	c
in	c
London	c
from	c
13th	c
March	c
to	c
14th	c
March	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
our	c
class	c
has	c
recently	c
read	i
an	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
which	i
takes	c
place	c
during	c
our	c
visit	c
to	c
London	c
,	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
14th	c
.	c

We	c
think	c
that	c
it	c
could	c
be	c
a	c
great	c
chance	c
in	i
order	i
to	c
know	i
British	c
fashion	c
and	c
probably	c
it	c
would	c
give	c
us	c
good	c
information	c
for	c
improving	c
our	c
studies	c
.	c

We	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
if	c
it	c
could	i
be	c
possible	c
to	c
introduce	c
a	c
little	c
change	c
in	c
our	c
programme	c
.	c

How	i
will	i
be	i
our	i
future	i
homes	i
?	i

For	c
example	c
,	c
we	c
will	c
have	c
got	i
computerizated	i
ovens	c
,	c
microwaves	c
and	c
freezers	c
,	c
or	c
we	c
will	c
probably	c
have	c
got	i
central	c
heating	c
controled	i
through	c
Internet	i
from	c
our	c
office	c
.	c

And	c
to	c
read	c
the	c
newspaper	c
at	c
breakfast	c
instead	c
of	c
watching	c
TV	c
?	c

To	c
begin	c
with	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
.	c

Referring	c
to	c
the	c
possibilities	c
of	c
accommodation	c
,	c
I	c
'd	c
prefer	c
log	c
cabins	c
to	c
tents	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
log	c
cabins	c
are	c
more	c
comportable	i
than	c
tents	c
.	c

Last	i
not	i
least	i
,	c
I	c
always	c
have	c
backache	c
after	c
sleeping	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
for	c
a	c
couple	c
of	c
days	c
.	c

As	c
I	c
had	i
been	c
asked	c
to	c
choose	c
two	c
activities	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
during	i
my	c
stay	c
at	c
the	c
camp	c
,	c
I	c
chose	c
Golf	c
and	c
singing	c
.	c

I	c
just	c
love	c
singing	c
.	c

Especially	c
in	c
summer	c
,	c
clothes	c
get	c
dirty	c
very	c
easily	c
.	c

Is	c
there	c
a	c
possibility	c
of	c
exchanging	c
different	c
currancies	i
to	c
US	c
dollar	i
?	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

It	c
sounds	c
nice	c
and	c
shopping	c
is	c
great	c
fun	c
-	c
or	c
it	c
should	c
be	c
.	c

You	c
cannot	c
make	c
a	c
step	c
without	c
"	c
touching	c
"	c
the	i
others	c
.	c

But	c
the	c
worst	c
moment	c
comes	c
,	i
if	c
you	c
cannot	c
find	c
the	c
thing	c
you	c
were	c
looking	c
for	c
,	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
no	c
longer	c
trendy	c
or	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
sold	c
out	c
.	c

Because	i
,	c
at	i
first	i
,	c
at	i
the	i
advertisement	i
was	i
written	i
that	c
in	i
this	c
music	c
show	c
would	c
play	i
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
so	c
.	c

What	c
is	c
more	c
you	i
wrote	c
that	c
discounts	c
available	i
,	c
but	c
it	i
was	c
also	c
lie	i
.	c

After	c
the	c
show	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
disappointed	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
spent	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
money	c
for	c
nothing	c
and	c
my	c
husband	c
decided	c
to	c
make	i
me	i
a	i
pleasure	i
.	c

But	c
when	c
we	c
came	i
to	c
it	c
,	c
we	c
saw	c
that	c
the	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
,	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
reconstructed	i
.	c

So	c
this	c
evening	c
was	c
terriable	i
.	c

It	c
broke	i
all	c
my	c
impression	c
about	i
London	c
.	c

Because	c
of	i
nothing	i
what	i
was	i
mentioned	i
at	i
the	i
advertisement	i
I	i
did	i
n't	i
get	i
.	c

There	c
are	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
new	c
modern	c
technologies	c
around	c
the	c
world	c
,	c
which	c
appear	i
not	c
long	c
ago	c
.	c

All	c
of	c
them	c
play	c
a	c
very	c
great	c
role	c
in	c
people	c
's	c
daily	c
life	c
.	c

Some	c
years	c
ago	c
people	c
especially	i
students	c
had	i
to	c
run	c
to	c
lubraries	i
in	c
order	c
to	c
find	c
a	c
book	c
about	c
something	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

I	c
saw	c
an	c
advertising	i
which	c
seemed	i
very	c
atractive	i
to	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
to	c
say	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
the	c
best	c
musical	c
show	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
enbelievable	i
to	i
be	i
late	i
with	i
45	i
minutes	i
.	c

For	c
all	c
these	c
reasons	c
I	c
am	c
asking	c
you	c
to	c
give	c
my	i
money	c
back	c
.	c

Best	c
Regards	c
,	c

We	c
spent	c
three	c
weeks	c
over	c
there	c
,	c
the	c
weather	c
was	c
great	c
,	c
the	c
people	c
we	c
met	c
very	i
interesting	c
so	c
everything	c
was	c
perfect	c
.	c

I	c
've	c
just	c
seen	c
your	c
letter	c
and	c
I	c
'm	c
really	c
delighted	c
to	c
have	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
be	c
in	c
log	i
cabins	i
because	c
I	c
feel	c
insecure	i
staying	c
in	c
tent	i
.	c

I	c
'm	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
swimming	c
and	c
my	c
level	c
is	i
medium	i
at	c
tennis	c
.	c

If	c
possible	c
,	c
could	c
you	c
let	c
me	c
know	c
what	c
I	c
'll	c
need	c
for	i
example	c
which	i
clothes	c
I	c
must	c
take	c
and	c
how	c
much	c
I	c
can	c
expect	c
to	c
spend	c
.	i

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
about	c
my	i
good	c
experience	c
I	c
had	c
last	c
month	c
.	c

I	i
'd	i
enjoyed	i
helping	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
and	c
it	c
has	i
been	i
fabulous	c
.	c

During	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
behind	c
them	c
and	c
I	c
could	c
see	c
the	c
spectators	c
shouting	c
and	c
jumping	c
with	i
their	i
and	i
up	i
.	c

It	c
was	c
unbelievable	c
to	c
realize	i
that	c
I	c
'd	c
worked	c
with	c
stars	c
and	c
that	c
they	c
were	c
my	c
friends	c
.	c

How	c
stupid	c
of	c
me	c
!	c

I	c
felt	c
really	c
disappointed	c
.	c

Lack	c
of	c
my	i
time	c
made	c
me	c
to	i
go	i
at	i
the	c
evening	c
show	c
.	c

No	c
,	c
alas	c
in	i
reality	c
it	c
appeared	c
a	i
mistake	c
.	c

According	c
to	c
the	c
advertisement	c
,	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
anyone	c
could	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
for	c
a	c
drink	c
.	c

Yours	c
faitully	i

They	c
could	c
not	c
communicate	c
with	c
someone	c
living	c
in	c
other	i
country	c
,	c
often	i
located	c
far	c
away	c
from	c
his	i
own	c
.	c

Using	c
mobile	c
phones	c
,	c
e-mails	c
or	c
internet	i
,	c
we	c
have	c
a	i
better	c
access	c
to	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
different	c
news	i
.	c

For	c
example	c
a	i
lot	c
of	c
pollution	c
has	c
raised	i
.	c

It	c
's	c
a	c
good	c
programme	c
,	c
especially	c
the	c
visit	c
to	c
the	c
National	c
Art	c
Gallery	c
.	c

A	c
few	c
students	c
and	c
me	i
have	c
heard	c
about	c
a	c
fashion	c
and	c
leisure	c
show	c
.	c

We	c
have	c
it	i
already	i
discussed	i
and	c
we	c
think	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
because	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
students	c
a	i
very	c
keen	c
ongoing	i
.	c

On	c
Monday	c
we	c
could	c
first	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
Sience	i
Museum	c
and	c
in	c
the	c
afternoon	c
to	c
Greenwich	c
.	c

Then	c
we	c
could	c
go	c
sightseeing	c
by	c
bus	c
on	c
Wednesday	c
after	c
lunchtime	i
.	c

It	c
must	c
be	c
wonderful	c
when	c
you	c
have	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
money	c
and	c
everybody	c
seems	c
to	c
know	c
you	c
.	c

Really	i
?	c

But	c
you	c
need	c
all	c
the	c
journalists	c
to	c
become	c
famous	c
so	c
the	c
only	c
way	c
is	c
to	c
accept	c
that	c
there	c
are	c
journalists	c
and	c
that	c
they	c
are	c
just	c
doing	c
their	c
job	c
.	c

No	c
one	c
told	c
you	c
to	c
be	c
famous	c
.	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
I	i
think	c
,	i
if	c
you	c
well-known	i
you	c
have	c
to	c
deal	c
with	c
that	c
.	c

Besides	c
,	i
we	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
And	i
Leisure	c
Show	c
,	c
which	c
was	c
advertised	c
in	c
the	c
newspaper	i
"	i
Metro	i
"	i
yesterday	c
.	c

All	c
my	c
classmates	c
are	c
very	c
interested	c
in	c
this	c
show	c
,	c
which	c
includes	c
latest	i
fashions	c
,	c
Leisure	i
and	c
sports	c
wear	c
,	c
Make	i
up	i
,	c
and	c
Hair	i
styles	c
.	c

We	c
would	c
be	c
very	c
pleased	c
if	c
you	c
could	i
consider	c
our	c
recommendation	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

They	c
feel	c
exhausted	c
to	i
be	i
followed	c
by	c
journalists	c

I	c
have	i
always	c
thought	c
that	c
plays	i
of	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
are	c
worth	c
of	i
seeing	c
,	c
but	c
two	c
days	c
before	i
I	c
was	c
very	c
disappointed	c
after	c
visiting	c
yours	i
theatre	c
.	c

Ealyer	i
I	c
had	c
seen	c
an	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
show	c
but	c
the	c
informationes	i
on	c
it	c
caused	i
fals	i
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
I	i
have	i
not	i
seen	i
my	c
favourite	c
actor	c
Danny	i
Brook	c
.	c

The	c
last	c
think	i
is	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
unpossible	i
to	c
get	i
the	i
theatre	c
restaurant	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

At	i
the	i
end	i
I	i
would	c
like	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
my	c
evening	c
out	c
two	c
days	c
before	i
was	c
not	c
perfect	c
and	c
I	c
wold	i
be	c
glad	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
pay	i
my	i
some	i
money	i
back	i
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	i

When	c
I	c
neaded	i
some	c
informationes	i
I	c
had	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
liblary	i
to	c
find	c
it	c
in	c
books	c
or	c
newspapers	c
.	c

We	c
are	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c

Last	c
summer	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
amazon	i
on	c
an	c
expedition	c
with	c
other	i
10	i
people	c
,	i
such	i
as	i
a	c
guide	c
,	c
a	c
doctor	c
,	c
a	c
scientist	c
&	c
all	c
the	c
rest	i
as	c
me	c
were	c
just	c
curious	c
.	c

We	c
walked	c
all	c
day	c
and	c
took	i
rest	i
in	c
the	c
evenings	c
.	c

We	c
were	c
not	c
allowed	c
to	c
leave	c
out	i
tents	c
during	c
the	c
night	c
or	c
until	c
the	c
day	c
start	i
,	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
dangerous	c
animals	c
which	c
leave	i
there	c
.	c

One	c
day	c
at	c
five	c
o'clock	c
in	c
the	c
morning	c
I	c
stepped	c
out	c
of	c
my	c
tent	c
without	c
seen	i
and	c
started	c
walking	c
towards	c
the	c
river	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
want	i
take	i
some	c
photographs	c
of	c
the	c
sun	i
rise	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
be	c
grateful	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
book	c
a	c
tent	c
for	c
me	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
nature	c
lover	c
and	c
the	c
idea	c
of	c
outdoor-sleeping	i
really	c
makes	c
me	c
happy	c
.	c

Concerning	c
the	c
activities	c
,	c
as	i
a	i
matter	i
of	i
fact	i
tennis	c
is	c
my	c
favorit	i
sport	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
keen	c
on	c
it	c
,	i
for	i
the	c
second	c
activity	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
enroll	i
surfing	i
,	c
because	c
my	c
husband	c
,	c
who	c
is	c
already	c
a	c
proficient	c
,	i
keeps	c
telling	c
me	c
about	c
the	c
excitement	c
of	c
this	c
sport	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
worthwile	i
trying	c
,	c
therefore	c
I	c
'd	c
love	c
to	c
be	c
in	c
the	c
beginners	i
group	c

there	c

swimming	c
for	i
8	i
years	i
for	i
a	i
club	i
and	c
enjoying	i
a	i
lot	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
afraid	c
,	i
I	c
am	c
not	c
good	c
at	c
photography	c
but	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
improve	c
it	i

I	c
hope	c
to	c
receive	c
your	c
reply	c
soon	c

I	c
am	c
really	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
going	c
this	i
camp	c
.	c

English	c

It	c
is	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
most	c
popular	c
subject	i
in	c
the	c
school	c
.	c

Seeing	c
that	c
this	c
is	c
the	c
first	c
year	c
of	c
the	i
drama	c
lessons	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
not	c
very	c
well	c
known	c
.	c

To	c
whome	i
it	c
may	c
concern	c
,	c

There	c
are	c
some	c
things	c
that	c
I	c
was	c
not	c
completely	c
satisfied	c
with	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
point	c
them	c
out	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
according	c
to	c
the	c
advertisment	i
,	c
the	c
musical	c
was	c
supprsed	i
to	c
start	c
at	c
19.30	c
but	c
it	c
actually	c
started	c
at	c
20.15	c
which	i
caused	c
me	c
a	i
trouble	i
.	c

How	c
did	c
we	c
know	c
that	c
she	c
was	c
that	c
kind	c
of	c
person	c
?	c

Well	c
,	c
it	c
all	c
begun	i
when	c
Pat	c
's	c
friend	c
,	c
Molly	c
,	c
went	c
down	c
to	c
London	c
...	c

She	c
found	i
familier	i
faces	c
on	c
the	c
other	c
side	c
of	c
the	c
street	c
.	c

As	c
Molly	c
did	c
n't	c
know	c
this	c
,	c
she	c
was	c
so	c
surprised	c
and	c
tried	c
to	c
ask	c
more	c
about	c
it	c
.	c

She	c
did	c
n't	c
mean	c
to	c
do	c
so	i
,	c
but	c
this	c
kind	c
of	c
thing	c
happens	c
a	c
lot	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
,	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
informing	c
me	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
first	i
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
two	i
weeks	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
in	c
the	c
USA	c
.	c

Could	c
I	i
please	i
know	i
which	i
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
should	c
bring	c
with	c
me	c
and	c
the	i
company	c
offers	c
us	c
some	c
expensise	i
money	c
to	c
spend	c
?	c

I	c
feel	c
,	i
it	c
will	c
be	c
the	c
best	c
holiday	c
,	i
I	c
have	c
ever	c
had	c
.	c

Although	c
I	c
am	c
the	i
one	i
who	c
loves	c
shopping	c
,	c
I	c
can	i
not	i
stand	c
on	i
the	i
Easters	i
,	i
the	i
Christmas	i
and	i
Sundays	i
,	i
because	i
those	i
days	i
are	i
suitable	i
for	i
anyone	i
to	i
consume	i
the	i
food	i
,	i
buy	i
some	i
presents	i
etc.	i
However	c
,	c
everyone	c
prefers	c
to	c
do	c
the	c
same	c
thing	c
and	c
the	i
same	c
time	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

According	c
to	c
the	c
advertisement	c
,	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
actor	i
who	c
had	i
to	i
show	i
was	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
but	c
for	c
some	c
unknown	c
reasons	c
,	c
there	c
was	c
another	c
disappointing	i
actor	c
instead	c
of	c
him	c
.	c

Looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c

Radio	c
,	c
television	c
,	c
stereo	c
,	c
CD	c
,	c
computer	c
:	c
it	c
's	c
hard	c
to	c
believe	c
,	c
but	c
every	c
day	c
I	c
'm	c
using	c
something	c
that	c
borns	i
from	c
the	i
technology	c
.	c

Yesterday	c
my	c
grandmother	c
asked	c
me	c
what	c
will	i
I	i
do	c
without	c
the	c
computer	c
.	c

And	c
mostly	c
,	c
it	c
should	c
a	i
great	c
opportunity	c
for	c
the	c
Art	c
students	c
who	c
are	c
attending	c
English	c
class	c
.	c

Most	c
of	i
students	c
in	c
our	c
class	c
are	c
studying	c
Fashion	c
as	i
full-time	c
.	c

Especially	c
,	c
it	c
does	c
not	c
cost	c
at	i
all	c
for	c
students	c
.	c

We	c
are	c
look	i
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

The	c
prises	i
for	c
lands	i
are	c
getting	i
increasing	c
it	i
's	i
because	c
of	c
this	c
reason	i
.	c

I	c
mean	c
most	c
of	i
home	i
are	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
in	c
a	c
building	c
like	c
a	c
flat	c
.	c

I	c
believe	c
there	c
are	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
high	c
buildings	c
now	c
in	c
Japan	c
.	c

And	c
because	c
it	c
'll	c
be	c
a	c
big	c
building	c
we	c
'll	c
able	i
to	c
see	c
a	c
whole	i
view	c
through	c
the	c
window	c
.	c

We	c
think	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
wonderful	c
chance	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
new	c
experience	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

That	c
is	i
,	c
our	c
security	c
system	c
will	c
be	c
much	c
stronger	c
.	c

Because	c
it	c
is	c
a	i
instinct	c
that	c
people	c
prefer	c
comfortable	c
place	i
and	c
want	c
to	c
take	c
a	c
rest	c
in	c
a	c
peaceful	c
place	c
.	c

The	c
advertisement	c
outside	c
the	c
theatre	c
explained	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
interesting	c
things	c
to	c
enjoy	c
.	c

Moreover	c
the	c
advertisement	c
said	c
that	c
the	c
show	i
time	i
was	c
19.30	c
;	c
on	c
the	c
contrary	c
it	c
started	c
with	i
45	c
minutes	c
of	i
late	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
modern	c
technology	c
has	c
changed	c
human	i
's	i
life	c
a	c
lot	c
,	c
expecially	i
starting	i
with	i
the	i
last	c
century	c
.	c

The	c
changements	i
brought	c
by	c
modern	c
technology	c
are	c
so	c
important	c
that	c
today	c
no	c
one	c
can	c
live	c
without	c
this	c
technology	c
or	c
with	i
a	c
part	c
of	c
it	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
situation	c
for	c
example	c
cars	c
and	c
motorcycles	c
are	c
a	c
necessity	c
to	i
get	i
out	i
:	c
I	c
live	c
on	c
a	c
little	c
mountain	c
at	c
160	c
metres	c
of	i
altitud	i
so	c
I	c
cannot	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
city	c
using	c
a	c
bycicle	i
.	c

Moreover	c
without	i
a	i
cellular	i
phone	i
my	i
mother	i
does	i
not	i
let	i
me	i
go	i
out	i
with	i
my	i
friends	i
to	i
the	i
city	i
because	c
it	c
is	c
too	c
far	c
and	c
she	c
is	i
worried	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
be	c
grateful	c
if	c
I	c
could	c
have	i
the	i
accomodation	i
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
:	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
not	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
because	c
of	c
my	c
height	c
,	i
I	c
am	c
so	c
tall	c
that	c
I	c
could	c
never	c
stand	c
up	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
play	c
basketball	c
because	c
my	c
trainer	c
said	c
that	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
suitable	i
not	c
to	c
stop	c
practising	i
it	i
during	c
July	c
.	c

Would	c
you	c
mind	c
sending	c
me	c
some	c
information	c
about	c
the	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
will	c
need	c
?	c

Elena	c
Pabori	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
if	c
we	c
want	c
to	c
show	c
the	c
good	c
points	c
of	c
our	c
typical	c
school-day	i
,	c
we	c
should	c
film	c
the	c
large	c
number	c
of	c
sport	i
activities	c
that	c
this	c
school	c
organises	c
because	c
students	c
are	c
compelled	c
by	c
them	c
to	c
come	c
to	c
school	c
with	c
enthusiasm	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
20.15	c
instead	c
of	c
19.30	c
as	c
you	c
had	c
written	c
on	i
it	i
.	c

I	c
had	c
to	c
wait	c
for	c
45	c
minutes	c
without	i
nothing	i
doing	i
.	c

I	c
would	i
you	c
informed	i
us	c
before	i
.	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
interested	c
in	c
visiting	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
but	c
it	c
seemed	c
to	c
me	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

Nowadays	c
,	c
we	c
need	c
modern	c
technology	c
to	c
improve	c
on	i
daily	c
life	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
as	c
you	c
also	i
know	c
,	c
lots	c
of	c
technology	c
have	i
boosted	i
since	i
few	i
years	c
.	c

To	c
conclude	c
,	c
we	c
must	c
not	c
forget	c
that	c
science	c
and	c
technology	c
is	c
a	c
tool	c
to	i
live	c
better	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
received	c
your	c
letter	c
about	c
the	c
prize	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
.	c

Re	c
time	i
:	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
student	c
and	c
have	c
examinations	c
until	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
June	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
can	c
arrange	c
this	c
.	c

Re	c
activities	c
:	c
During	c
the	c
two	c
weeks	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
do	c
tennis	c
and	c
swimming	c
.	c

Swimming	c
is	c
another	c
sport	c
I	c
learned	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
six	c
.	c

Do	c
you	c
have	c
a	c
choice	c
of	c
food	c
?	c

I	c
'm	c
vegetarian	c
and	c
ca	c
n't	c
eat	c
any	c
milk	c
products	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
to	c
tear	c
off	c
a	c
part	c
of	c
every	c
single	c
ticket	c
.	c

This	c
part	c
had	c
to	c
be	c
saved	c
for	c
later	c
because	c
the	c
concert	c
orginazer	i
wanted	c
to	c
know	c
the	c
exactly	i
number	c
of	c
visitors	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
great	c
experience	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
a	c
serious	c
duty	c
and	c
also	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
fun	c
.	c

Hello	c
,	c

Yeah	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
's	c
why	c
!	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothe	i
I	c
probably	i
will	i
use	i
there	c
?	c

Dear	c
Tina	c

Remember	c
when	c
I	c
told	c
you	c
I	c
helped	c
someone	c
important	c
?	c

I	c
was	c
walking	c
down	c
the	c
main	c
street	c
looking	c
for	c
a	c
gift	c
shop	c

I	c
did	c
n't	c
know	c
what	c
to	c
do	c
,	i
I	c
was	c
sure	c
he	c
was	c
a	c
Robber	c

or	c
even	c
a	c
murther	i
!	c

Tina	c
,	c
guess	c
WHO	c
was	i
he	i
?	c

Ricky	c
Martin	c
!	c
!	c

And	c
there	c
's	c
more	c
!	c

Because	c
the	c
store	c
manager	c
told	c
him	c
that	c
I	c
was	c
the	c
best	c
hairdresser	c
in	c
the	c
city	c
!	c

I	c
met	c
all	c
the	c
staff	c
,	c
and	c
Ricky	c
took	c
lots	c
of	c
fotographs	i
with	c

As	c
far	c
as	c
accommodation	c
is	c
concerned	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
the	c
log	c
cabin	c
due	c
to	c
the	c
fact	c
that	c
I	c
am	c
not	c
a	c
teenager	c
any	c
more	c
and	c
crawling	c
in	c
and	c
out	c
of	c
a	c
tent	c
has	c
become	c
cumbersome	i
to	i
me	c
.	c

I	c
remain	c
,	c

Therefore	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
time	i
document	c
which	c
will	c
remain	c
of	c
interest	c
and	c
which	c
will	c
be	c
read	c
again	c
and	c
again	c
,	c
also	i
by	i
non-South	i
Africans	i
.	c

Steve	c
Biko	c
and	c
Donald	c
Woods	c
will	c
be	c
remembered	c
always	c
.	c

A	c
peaceful	c
man	c
who	c
was	c
caught	c
up	c
in	c
the	c
wills	i
of	c
the	c
apartheid	c
regime	c
,	c
dying	c
such	c
a	c
violent	c
death	c
.	c

Donald	c
Wood	c
for	c
literally	c
jumping	i
over	i
his	i
own	i
shadow	i
and	c
risking	c
his	c
life	c
and	c
that	c
of	c
his	c
family	c
in	c
the	c
process	c
of	c
reporting	c
the	c
vile	c
crimes	c
of	c
the	c
SA	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
my	c
firm	c
believe	i
that	c
this	c
book	c
will	c
remain	c
a	c
piece	i
of	c
literature	c
which	c
will	c
not	c
lose	c
its	c
actuality	i
,	i
in	c
a	c
world	c
where	c
people	c
are	c
hounded	c
for	c
their	c
colour	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
your	c

In	c
Italy	c
there	c
are	c
n't	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
rules	c
at	c

and	c
they	c
are	c

very	c
stricht	i

Nobody	c

I	c
can	c
do	c
what	c
I	c
like	c
doing	c
but	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
study	c

There	c
is	c

Write	c
soon	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
,	c

It	c
seems	c
so	c
exciting	c
.	c

Because	c
I	c
'm	c
not	c
good	c
at	c
sporting	i
,	c
so	i
I	c
will	c
choose	c
singing	c
and	c
photography	c
as	c
my	c
activities	c
.	c

As	c
I	c
love	c
singing	c
and	c
always	c
spend	c
my	c
free	c
time	c
in	i
Karaoke	c
to	c
practise	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
my	c
singing	c
is	c
not	c
too	c
bad	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
be	c
delightful	i
if	c
you	c
could	c
recommend	i
me	c
.	c

I	c
used	c
to	c
do	i
shopping	c
a	c
lot	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
in	i
the	i
university	c
.	c

I	c
found	c
that	c
it	c
's	c
not	c
worth	i
when	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
southern	c
part	c
of	c
Thailand	c
3	c
years	c
ago	c
where	c
I	c
met	c
an	c
old	c
man	c
and	c
his	c
little	c
grandson	c
.	c

Little	i
grandson	c
tried	c
to	c
help	c
his	c
grandfather	c
who	i
was	c
70	c
years	c
old	i
by	c
hiring	i
himself	i
out	i
as	c
a	c
gardener	c
after	c
school	c
,	c
though	c
he	c
was	c
only	c
10	c
years	c
old	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
it	c
changed	c
our	c
life-style	i
.	c

We	c
have	c
modern	c
equipment	c
for	c
communication	c
-	c
phones	c
,	c
faxes	c
,	c
E-mail	c
.	c

We	c
can	c
communicate	c
with	c
our	c
partner	i
faster	c
and	c
better	c
and	c
offer	c
them	c
better	c
service	i
.	c

During	c
my	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
.	c

First	c
,	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
was	c
n't	c
the	c
star	c
that	c
night	c
,	c
he	c
was	c
replaced	c
by	c
an	c
actor	c
that	c
seemed	c
a	i
rookie	c
.	c

How	i
it	i
was	i
explained	i
above	i
,	i
I	i
'm	i
not	i
satisfied	i
and	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
be	c
refund	i
.	c

yours	c
faithfully	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

She	c
's	c
the	c
sister	c
of	c
my	c
ex-girlfriend	c
which	i
is	c
called	c
Eingrid	c
.	c

We	c
had	c
a	c
little	c
conversation	c
and	c
suddenly	c
she	c
kissed	c
me	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
refused	c
to	c
continue	c
.	c

I	c
called	c
Nick	c
to	c
go	c
search	c
the	i
girls	c
(	c
he	c
was	c
in	c
the	c
WC	c
)	c
and	c
said	c
goodbye	c
to	c
she	i
.	c

When	c
we	c
met	c
the	c
girls	c
Eingrid	c
was	c
furious	c
,	c
she	c
said	c
me	i
that	c
Pat	c
had	c
saw	i
me	c
kissing	c
another	c
girl	c
and	c
our	c
relationship	c
was	c
over	c
!	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
on	c
behalf	c
of	c
my	c
class	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
about	i
the	c
programme	c
you	c
organised	c
for	c
our	c
trip	c
to	c
London	c
.	c

In	i
fact	i
,	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
big	c
exhibition	c
of	c
the	c
latest	c
fashions	c
,	c
leisure	c
and	c
sports	c
wear	c
,	c
make	i
up	i
and	c
hairstyles	c
.	c

It	c
would	c
be	c
interesting	c
for	c
us	c
to	c
see	c
all	c
that	c
"	c
live	c
"	c
,	c
rather	c
than	c
on	c
TV	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

We	c
had	c
been	c
trapped	c
in	c
the	c
snowy	c
,	c
almost	c
vertical	c
slopes	c
of	c
the	c
"	c
Tête	c
Blanche	c
"	c
for	c
more	c
than	c
ten	c
hours	c
by	c
then	c
.	c

We	c
had	c
decided	c
to	c
climb	c
that	c
more	c
than	c
3'700-metre-high	i
mountain	c
near	c
Arolla	c
in	c
Switzerland	c
two	c
weeks	c
beforehand	c
.	c

He	c
could	c
n't	c
move	c
any	c
more	c
and	c
my	c
mobilephone	i
was	c
not	c
able	c
to	c
find	c
a	c
proper	c
network	c
.	c

I	c
finally	c
decided	c
to	c
carry	c
him	c
on	c
my	c
back	c
on	i
the	i
way	i
back	c
to	c
the	c
rescue	c
chalet	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
dangerous	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
steepness	c
of	c
the	c
slope	c
and	c
we	c
risked	c
falling	c
down	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
we	c
would	c
have	c
frozen	c
to	c
death	c
if	c
we	c
had	c
stood	i
where	c
we	c
were	c
.	c

We	c
were	c
safe	c
!	c

I	c
visited	c
your	c
Theatre	c
yesterday	c
.	c

We	c
have	i
disappointed	c
.	c

Another	c
problem	c
-	c
the	c
tickets	c
for	c
students	c
according	c
to	c
your	c
advertisement	c
should	c
be	i
available	i
with	i
discounts	i
-	c
unfortunately	c
I	c
could	c
not	c
buy	c
such	c
ticket	i
.	c

During	c
the	c
interval	c
I	c
would	c
drink	i
coffee	c
in	c
theatre	i
restaurant	c
-	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

In	i
accordance	i
with	i
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
to	c
return	c
me	c
my	c
money	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

What	c
will	c
clothes	c
be	c
like	c
100	c
years	c
from	c
now	c
?	c

All	c
syntetic	i
material	c
will	c
be	c
uncomfortable	c
for	c
these	c
people	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
,	i
we	c
will	c
observe	c
a	c
little	i
and	i
slow	c
changes	c
in	c
fashion	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
hope	c
that	c
new	c
clothes	c
will	c
be	i
always	i
pleasent	i
for	c
people	c
.	c

This	c
show	c
consists	c
of	c
a	c
big	c
fair	c
in	c
the	c
Central	c
Exhibition	c
Hall	c
in	c
which	c
we	c
will	c
have	c
the	c
opportunity	c
of	c
seeing	c
the	c
latest	c
releases	c
on	i
sports	i
wear	i
,	c
make	c
up	c
,	i
hairstyles	i
.	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
we	c
would	c
be	c
speaking	c
English	c
outside	c
school	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sarah	c
,	c

Well	c
,	c
having	c
read	c
the	c
book	c
before	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
say	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
great	c
idea	c
!	c

You	c
told	c
me	c
your	c
cousin	c
likes	c
suspense	c
books	c
and	c
stories	c
,	c
the	c
ones	c
you	i
keep	c
trying	c
to	c
figure	c
it	i
out	c
who	c
is	c
the	c
killer	c
.	c

Are	c
you	c
already	c
on	c
holidays	i
.	i

Love	c

Dear	c
Mr.	c
Robertson	c
,	c

Anyway	c
,	c
intstead	i
of	c
go	i
shopping	c
in	c
the	c
afternoon	c
session	c
,	c
we	c
will	c
attend	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
never	c
wanted	c
to	c
be	c
a	c
hero	c

We	c
all	c
believe	c
that	c
is	i
a	c
great	c
programme	c
which	i
concludes	i
both	c
education	i
and	c
free	c
time	c
.	c

We	c
all	i
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
again	c
.	c

They	c
just	c
published	i
gossips	i
about	c
famous	c
people	c
,	c
such	c
as	c
politicians	c
,	c
musicians	c
and	c
film	c
stars	c
.	c

So	c
the	c
power	c
is	c
to	i
the	c
people	c
.	c

I	c
and	c
all	c
of	c
my	c
college	i
have	c
read	c
your	c
programme	c
,	c
which	c
you	c
organised	c
for	c
us	c
,	c
for	c
our	c
three	i
days	i
trip	c
to	c
London	c
.	c

We	c
all	c
think	c
the	c
programme	c
is	c
organised	c
well	c
,	i
especially	i
we	c
're	c
so	c
keen	c
on	c
the	c
idea	c
to	i
go	i
to	c
the	c
National	c
Art	c
Gallery	c
,	c
to	c
see	c
work	i
of	c
the	c
bigest	i
painters	c
on	i
the	c
world	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
,	i
because	c
we	c
saw	c
a	c
great	c
advetisement	i
for	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
and	c
we	c
really	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
see	c
that	c
show	c
.	c

The	c
show	c
will	c
be	c
in	c
Central	i
Exhibition	c
Hall	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
,	c
14th	i
of	c
March	c
between	i
10.00	c
pm	c
to	c
19.00	c
pm	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
we	c
can	c
have	c
a	c
great	c
time	c
there	c
,	c
and	c
entrence	i
is	c
free	c
of	c
charge	c
for	c
students	c
,	c
what	i
is	c
very	c
important	c
as	c
well	c
.	c

'	c
It	c
was	c
dangerous	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
knew	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
'	c

However	c
the	i
truth	c
was	c
a	c
little	c
bit	c
diffrent	i
.	c

I	c
look	i
around	c
and	c
I	c
relised	i
one	i
friend	c
of	c
mine	c
is	i
still	c
in	c
the	c
see	i
,	c
and	c
fighting	c
with	i
storm	i
,	c
trying	c
to	c
get	c
to	c
the	c
side	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
"	c
performed	c
at	c
"	c
The	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
"	c
on	c
the	c
20th	c
of	c
May	c
.	c

To	c
begin	c
with	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
start	c
at	c
19:30	c
but	c
,	c
due	c
to	c
a	c
"	c
technical	c
problem	c
"	c
,	c
as	c
they	c
said	c
,	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
it	c
would	c
not	c
have	c
been	c
such	c
a	c
great	c
problem	c
if	c
the	c
show	c
on	i
the	i
proved	i
to	c
be	c
as	c
good	c
as	c
they	c
promised	c
but	c
it	c
really	c
was	c
not	c
worth	c
seeing	c
,	c
especially	c
because	c
the	c
first	i
actor	c
was	c
not	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
as	i
we	c
expected	c
but	i
an	c
unknown	c
,	c
clearly	c
an	c
inexperienced	c
young	c
actor	c
,	c
named	c
Tom	c
Douglas	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
not	c
satisfied	c
with	c
the	c
service	c
we	c
received	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
therefore	c
writing	c
for	i
a	c
full	c
refund	c
and	c
I	c
expect	c
to	c
receive	c
by	i
post	i
a	i
cheque	i
for	c
£	c
20	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

LIKE	c
BLIND	c
SHEEP	c

The	c
reason	c
why	c
we	c
'll	c
do	c
this	c
is	c
that	c
we	c
need	c
to	c
be	c
accepted	c
by	c
the	c
elite	c
group	c
that	c
decide	c
who	c
you	c
must	c
be	c
and	c
how	c
you	c
must	c
behave	c
.	c

Anyway	c
,	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
really	c
mind	c
what	c
people	c
will	c
be	c
wearing	c
in	c
100	c
years	c
'	c
time	c
.	c

We	c
know	c
that	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
good	c
chance	c
for	c
us	c
to	c
learn	c
more	c
different	c
things	c
and	c
can	i
widen	c
our	c
knowledge	c
in	c
the	c
Science	c
Museum	c
.	c

So	c
we	c
decide	i
to	c
choose	c
the	i
other	i
programme	i
which	i
have	i
seen	i
as	i
an	i
entertainment	i
.	c

It	c
is	c
the	c
LONDON	c
FASHION	c
AND	c
LEISURE	c
SHOW	c
.	c

It	c
shows	c
the	c
latest	c
fashions	c
including	i
leisure	c
and	c
sports	c
wear	c
.	c

And	c
,	i
it	c
is	c
free	c
for	c
students	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
worth	c
visiting	c
.	c

We	c
can	c
join	i
the	c
programme	c
that	c
you	c
planned	c
as	c
usual	c
and	c
we	i
go	c
to	c
that	c
fashion	c
show	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
.	c

The	c
home	i
will	c
be	c
built	c
on	i
the	c
sky	c
-	c
so	c
as	c
to	c
save	c
more	c
land	c
to	c
build	c
the	c
other	c
buildings	c
.	c

on	i
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
there	c
're	c
some	c
ways	i
that	c
remain	c
the	c
same	c
.	c

Firstly	c
I	i
would	c
like	c
to	c
explain	c
you	i
where	i
the	c
problem	c
is	c
.	c

Please	c
forgive	c
me	c
but	c
you	c
did	c
n't	c
do	c
your	c
best	c
.	c

There	c
was	c
a	c
change	c
of	i
the	c
leader-actor	i
what	i
annoyed	c
me	c
indeed	i
.	c

Further	i
more	i
the	i
show	c
was	c
to	c
begin	c
at	c
about	c
19.30	c
but	c
it	c
didi	i
n't	i
.	c

A	c
poster	c
:	c
"	c
Closed	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
illness	c
of	c
the	c
chef.	c
"	c

There	c
were	c
some	c
more	c
disappointing	c
situations	c
about	c
which	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
want	c
to	c
write	c
.	c

Eventually	i
-	c
you	c
offered	c
a	c
wonderflul	i
evening	c
but	c
I	c
must	c
say	c
that	c
if	c
I	c
had	c
known	c
that	c
it	c
is	i
going	i
to	c
be	c
like	c
that	c
I	c
would	c
n't	c
have	c
wasted	c
my	c
time	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
recieve	i
back	c
my	c
money	c
.	c

The	c
most	c
important	c
thing	c
for	c
me	c
is	c
using	c
a	c
computer	c
.	c

Further	i
more	i
you	c
can	c
play	c
with	c
the	c
computer	c
,	c
and	c
unfortunetly	i
this	c
advantage	i
has	i
especially	i
changed	c
my	c
life	c
.	c

The	c
next	c
thing	c
that	c
has	c
changed	c
my	c
life	c
is	c
a	c
mobile	c
telephone	c
.	c

This	c
little	c
thing	c
brings	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
satisfaction	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
very	c
useful	c
either	i
.	c

But	c
actually	c
it	c
is	c
boring	c
when	c
you	c
're	c
almost	c
always	c
under	c
observation	c
.	c

The	c
modern	c
technologies	c
brought	i
to	c
my	c
life	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
changes	c
.	c

I	c
only	c
press	c
the	c
button	c
and	c
everything	c
is	c
going	i
alright	i
.	c

They	c
made	c
my	c
life	c
better	c
.	c

As	i
I	c
saw	c
on	i
the	c
advertisement	c
,	i
there	c
were	i
stars	c
and	c
artists	c
from	c
around	c
the	c
world	c
but	c
this	c
year	c
there	c
were	c
only	c
six	c
countries	c
.	i

I	c
wonder	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
offer	i
outside	i
concerts	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
there	c
were	c
too	c
few	c
plays	c
and	c
films	c
.	c

Do	c
n't	c
you	c
think	c
you	c
could	c
create	i
dramatic	i
courses	c
?	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerly	i
,	c

Dear	c
George	c
,	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
when	c
we	c
failed	i
an	c
exam	c
in	c
June	c
,	c
we	c
can	c
have	i
it	c
in	c
September	c
.	c

And	c
if	c
we	c
are	c
interested	c
,	c
we	c
can	c
spend	c
six	c
months	c
abroad	c
but	c
we	c
must	c
pass	c
the	c
FCE	c
.	c

There	c
are	c
so	c
many	c
rules	c
but	c
it	c
would	c
be	i
too	c
long	c
if	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
explain	c
all	c
of	c
them	c
.	c

Best	c
regards	c

16.12.2000	c

The	c
festival	c
was	c
generally	c
good	c
but	c
I	c
have	c
some	c
suggestions	c
for	c
the	i
next	c
year	c
's	c
festival	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
great	c
idea	c
.	c

However	c
there	c
were	c
things	c
that	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
like	c
.	c

You	c
said	c
that	c
stars	c
and	c
artists	c
would	c
come	c
from	c
around	c
the	c
world	c
but	c
there	c
was	i
only	c
starts	i
from	c
six	c
major	c
countries	c
.	c

Last	i
thing	c
that	c
I	c
will	c
say	c
is	c
"	c
one	c
reasonably-priced	c
weekend	c
ticket	c
"	c
.	i

16.12.2000	c

Dear	c
Emily	c
,	c

I	c
'm	c
fine	c
thanks	c
and	c
my	c
parents	c
are	c
also	c
good	i
.	c

I	c
have	c
a	c
suprise	i
for	c
you	c
.	c

In	c
schools	c
we	c
are	c
n't	c
allowed	c
to	c
speak	c
in	c
classes	i
.	c

Also	c
we	c
must	c
go	c
to	c
school	c
by	i
our	c
uniforms	c
.	c

All	i
the	i
time	i
we	i
must	i
be	i
kind	i
to	i
our	i
friends	i
and	i
teachers	i
.	c

Other	c
things	c
are	c
allowed	c
to	c
me	c
.	c

Your	c
friend	c

Secondly	c
,	c
you	i
advertisement	c
stated	c
that	c
the	c
second	c
show	c
should	c
start	c
at	c
19:30	c
.	c

It	i
was	c
not	c
true	c
because	c
the	c
audience	c
had	c
to	c
wait	c
until	c
20:15	c
.	c

It	i
was	c
,	c
however	c
,	c
impossible	c
because	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
for	c
unknown	c
reasons	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

"	c
Oh	c
,	c
that	c
girl	c
will	c
cause	c
some	c
problems	c
"	c
-	c
he	c
thought	c
when	c
Miss	c
Colston	c
entered	c
the	c
classroom	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
been	c
the	c
happiest	c
woman	c
since	c
I	c
have	i
got	i
your	c
letter	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
not	c
believe	c
my	c
eyes	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
some	c
information	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
on	c
19th	i
of	c
July	c
and	c
come	c
back	c
on	c
2nd	i
of	c
August	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
work	c
until	c
19th	c
of	c
July	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
been	i
at	i
log	c
cabins	c
before	c
and	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
enjoy	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
also	c
like	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
about	c
my	c
free-time	c
activities	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
actually	c
not	c
so	c
good	c
at	c
climbing	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
like	c
the	c
fear	c
of	c
risks	c
and	c
dangers	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
happy`	c
,	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
will	c
have	c
the	c
chance	c
to	c
do	c
this	i
two	c
activities	c
.	c

My	c
last	c
question	c
were	i
;	i
how	c
much	c
money	c
do	c
I	c
need	c
?	c

I	c
hope	c
,	i
I	c
have	c
answered	c
all	c
questions	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

You	c
can	c
lose	c
your	c
way	c
if	c
you	c
do	c
not	c
follow	c
the	c
signs	c
,	c
or	c
you	c
can	i
not	i
find	c
the	c
items	c
what	i
you	c
want	c
to	c
buy	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
you	i
need	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
time	c
,	c
because	c
the	c
market	i
is	c
so	c
big	c
.	c

For	i
instance	i
,	i
I	c
think	c
a	c
lot	c
about	c
this	c
issue	c
,	c
and	c
sometimes	c
I	c
do	c
not	c
even	c
want	c
to	c
spend	i
water	c
,	c
although	c
I	c
should	c
do	i
it	i
.	c

I	c
think	c
I	c
am	c
too	c
sensible	c
.	c

I	i
'd	i
prefer	c
to	c
go	c
the	i
markets	i
which	i
are	i
open	i
and	i
outside	i
.	c

So	i
you	i
can	c
ask	c
about	c
the	c
qualities	i
and	c
prices	c
and	c
get	c
immediately	i
your	i
answers	i
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
I	c
found	c
closed	c
doors	c
and	c
any	i
information	c
about	c
the	c
reason	c
.	c

Neither	i
without	i
any	c
reason	c
it	i
was	i
not	c
available	c
.	c

What	c
is	c
more	c
,	c
our	c
friends	c
did	c
n't	c
want	c
to	c
talk	c
with	i
us	c
.	c

We	c
tried	c
to	c
survive	c
there	c
without	c
returning	c
on	i
a	i
land	c
-	c
to	c
our	c
town	c
.	c

There	c
was	c
no	c
light	c
during	i
nights	i
so	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
find	c
some	c
wood	c
to	c
make	c
a	c
fire	c
.	c

This	c
is	c
no	c
joke	c
!	c

There	c
was	c
a	c
secret	c
place	c
when	i
robber	i
keept	i
stolen	i
gold	i
from	c
bank	i
.	c

We	c
found	c
the	c
solution	c
of	i
this	c
deceperous	i
situation	c
-	c
to	c
say	c
nothing	c
to	c
anybody	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
you	c
are	c
able	c
to	c
imagine	c
what	c
was	i
happen	i
later	c
.	c

Our	c
class	c
really	c
appreciate	c
for	i
preparing	c
this	c
programme	c
,	c
especially	c
for	i
Monday	c
's	c
atraction	i
.	c

The	i
idea	i
of	i
sightseeing	i
by	c
bus	c
would	i
be	c
a	c
great	c
possibility	i
for	c
us	c
to	c
know	i
better	i
our	i
wonderful	i
capitol	i
.	c

In	c
last	i
edition	c
of	c
'	c
London	c
's	c
Guide	c
'	c
we	c
saw	c
an	c
advert	c
of	i
'	c
The	c
London	c
Fasion	i
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
'	c
,	c
which	c
will	c
be	c
held	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
and	c
it	c
lasted	i
from	c
10	c
a.m.	c
to	c
7	c
p.m.	c
The	c
offer	c
mentiones	i
'	i
latest	c
fasions	i
'	c
,	c
which	c
we	c
are	c
incredible	i
interested	c
in	c

Thing	i
which	c
attract	c
us	c
the	c
most	c
are	c
:	i
'	c
Make	i
up	i
'	c
and	c
'	c
Hairstyles	c
'	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
convinced	c
that	c
you	c
agree	i
with	c
us	c
and	c
we	c
take	i
part	i
in	i
this	c
show	c
.	c

We	c
would	c
be	c
terribly	c
grateful	c
,	i
if	c
you	c
accept	i
our	c
offer	i

I	c
'm	c
looking	c

Nowedays	i
famous	c
people	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
an	c
easy	c
life	c
.	c

They	c
are	c
always	c
attacted	i
by	c
naughty	c
journalists	c
,	c
which	c
have	c
aspiration	i
to	c
earn	c
big	c
money	c
for	c
writing	c
an	c
extremaly	i
good	c
report	c
,	i
or	c
article	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
we	c
are	c
fascinated	c
in	i
their	c
marriage	i
,	c
children	c
,	c
holidays	c
etc.	c
What	c
is	c
more	c
it	c
was	c
their	c
own	c
choice	c
to	c
become	c
popular	c
and	c
well-known	i
.	c

By	i
chosing	i
this	c
style	c
of	c
life	c
they	c
should	c
realise	c
,	i
how	i
their	i
life	i
would	i
look	i
like	i
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
I	c
belive	i
that	c
we	c
have	c
right	i
to	c
be	c
informed	c
about	c
their	c
life	i
,	c
providing	c
that	c
journalists	c
respect	c
some	c
important	c
rules	c
.	c

There	c
is	c
only	c
one	c
thing	c
that	c
we	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
change	c
,	c
if	c
you	c
would	c
n't	c
mind	c
.	c

The	c
latest	c
fashions	c
will	c
be	c
shown	c
there	c
and	c
many	c
useful	c
tips	c
about	c
make-up	c
and	c
hairstyles	c
will	c
be	c
given	c
.	c

So	c
we	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
a	c
disco	c
and	c
this	c
fashion	c
show	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
for	c
us	c
to	c
learn	c
something	c
about	c
styling	c
.	c

We	c
think	c
we	c
'll	c
find	i
one	c
free	c
hour	c
befor	i
the	c
River	c
trip	c
.	c

In	c
every	c
country	c
there	c
are	c
the	i
famous	c
people	c
who	c
are	c
in	i
the	c
middle	i
of	c
the	i
public	c
attention	c
.	c

They	c
are	c
always	c
expected	c
to	c
be	c
beautiful	c
,	c
intelligent	c
,	c
good-looking	c
.	c

That	c
's	c
why	c
it	c
's	c
very	c
important	c
for	c
these	c
people	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
private	c
life	c
without	c
journalists	c
where	c
they	c
can	c
relax	c
and	c
where	c
they	c
do	c
n't	c
need	c
to	c
be	c
superstars	c
.	c

In	c
answer	c
to	c
your	c
letter	c
,	c
you	c
will	c
find	c
below	c
the	c
informations	i
you	c
need	c

I	c
ca	c
n't	c

I	c

month	c

I	c
hope	c
it	i
will	c
not	c
make	i
problems	i
to	i
you	i

Moreover	c
I	c
was	i
sailing	i
teacher	c
on	i
summers	i
the	i
past	i
few	i
years	i

Or	c
can	c
I	c
retire	i
some	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
?	c

The	c
most	c
interesting	c
lessons	c
for	c

lessons	c
in	c
which	c

something	c
real	c

concrete	c

for	i
example	i
,	c
the	c
lessons	i
of	i
mechanics	i

are	c
very	c
interesting	c

After	c
all	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
not	c
important	c
the	i
one	c
we	c
will	c

Dear	c
Mr	c

We	c
are	c
especially	c
looking	c

to	c
join	i
the	c
river	c

Greenwich	c

the	i

What	c
was	c
so	c
dangerous	c
and	c
why	i
I	i
had	i
to	i
do	i
it	i
?	c

We	c
all	c
decided	c
to	i
go	i
to	c
have	c
a	c
day	c
by	c
the	c
seaside	c
not	c
far	c
away	c
from	c
Portsmouth	c
.	c

We	c
lied	i
on	c
the	c
sand	c
under	c
the	c
sun	c
,	c
we	c
had	c
funny	c
beach	c
volley	i
matches	c
,	c
interesting	c
chats	c
,	c
but	c
after	c
two	c
hours	c
there	c
,	c
my	c
friends	c
decided	c
to	c
go	c
swimming	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
took	c
the	c
decision	c
to	c
go	c
and	c
join	c
them	c
also	i
if	i
I	c
knew	c
that	c
it	c
would	c
have	i
been	i
dangerous	c
for	i
my	i
life	i
.	c

I	c
walked	i
very	c
slowly	c
through	c
the	c
water	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
scared	c
but	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
because	c
if	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
go	c
my	c
friends	c
could	i
understand	i
that	c
something	c
was	c
wrong	c
with	c
me	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
end	c
fortunately	c
everything	c
went	c
well	c
as	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
sink	c
in	c
the	c
sea	c
.	c

After	c
that	c
day	c
,	c
I	c
decided	c
taking	i
up	c
swimming	c
,	c
so	c
that	c
I	c
would	c

The	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c

It	c
should	c
start	i
at	c
19.30	c
and	c
it	c
had	i
at	c
20:15	c
!	c

He	c
had	i
been	i
mistakeing	i
all	c
the	c
time	c
.	c

At	i
the	c
advertisement	c
,	c
there	i
was	c
written	c
"	c
your	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
"	c
.	c

One	c
day	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
going	c
to	c
school	c
by	c
bus	c
and	c
I	i
do	c
n't	c
know	c
why	c
I	i
went	c
to	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
it	c
.	c

Her	c
name	c
was	c
Sue	c
and	c
she	c
was	c
so	c
beautiful	c
that	c
I	c
still	c
ca	c
n't	c
find	c
words	c
which	c
could	c
be	c
good	c
to	c
describe	c
her	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
constantly	c
seeing	c
her	c
but	c
my	c
shyness	c
made	c
my	c
mouth	c
close	c
so	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
say	c
anything	c
!	c

I	c
was	c
in	c
Love	c
but	c
that	c
was	c
n't	c
nice	c
.	c

That	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
be	c
a	c
joke	c
from	c
my	c
"	c
coleagues	i
"	c
!	c

I	c
enjoyied	i
it	c
and	c
here	c
are	c
some	c
feelings	i
and	c
advice	c
for	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

Then	i
I	c
had	c
pleasure	i
listening	i
to	c
your	c
variety	c
of	c
concerts	c
.	c

It	c
would	c
be	c
better	c
if	c
people	c
have	i
had	i
the	c
possibility	i
to	c
let	i
their	c
cars	c
very	c
near	c
to	c
the	c
Festival	i
during	c
the	c
week-end	i
!	c

So	c
,	c
her	i
father	c
prepared	c
the	c
car	c
and	c
her	i
mother	c
took	c
some	c
food	c
for	c
the	c
journey	c
.	c

Suddenly	c
,	c
the	c
father	c
stopped	c
and	c
said	c
:	c
"	c
Here	c
we	c
are	c
!	c
"	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
the	c
letter	c
.	c

I	c
ca	c
n't	c
believe	c
it	c
but	c
I	c
'm	c
really	c

SECRETS	c

DAMAGE	c

From	c
the	c
time	c
she	c
began	c
the	i
university	c
,	c
the	c
problems	c
began	c
.	c

One	c
day	c
,	c
her	c
friends	c
got	c
fed	c
up	c
with	c
this	c
and	c
ended	c
their	c
friendship	c
.	c

Nobody	c
wanted	c
to	c
talk	c
to	c
her	c
either	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
explain	c
to	c
you	c
what	c
the	c

were	c
at	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c

at	c
your	c

So	c
,	c
now	c
I	c
ask	c
you	c
to	c
send	c
my	c
money	c
back	c

because	c
I	c
really	c
did	c
not	c
enjoy	c
that	c
night	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

She	c
accepted	c

But	c
,	c
when	c
they	c
heard	c
a	c
scream	c
,	c
they	c
stopped	c
and	c
,	c
when	c
they	c
saw	c
a	c
shadow	c
coming	c
forward	i
them	c
,	c
they	c
started	c
running	c
,	c
hearing	c
a	c
voice	c
saying	c
:	c
"	c
Our	c
secret	c
!	c
"	c

But	c
Pat	c

But	c
Kim	i

and	i
no	i

the	c

Danny	c
Brook	c

there	i
was	c

in	c
the	c

there	c
was	c
an	i

with	i
my	i

Your	i
Sincerely	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

That	c
might	i
be	i
a	c
secret	c
for	c
Francis	c
-	c
and	c
they	c
decided	c
the	i
program	i
and	c
the	c
present	c
,	c
a	c
new	c
gold	c
watch	c
.	c

The	c
last	c
day	c
all	c
the	c
friends	c
went	c
to	c
Pat	c
's	c
home	c
with	c
food	c
,	c
musical	c
instruments	c
,	c
tape	i
recorder	c
.	c

Pat	c
was	c
very	c
excited	c
about	c
this	c
.	c

Now	c
many	i
people	c
knew	c
the	c
secret	c
but	c
Pat	c
said	i
everyone	c
:	c
"	c
I	c
tell	i
you	c
a	c
small	c
secret	c
,	c
but	c
you	i
do	i
n't	i
speak	c

please	c

"	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
that	c
has	c
recently	c
taken	c
place	c
at	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
.	c

That	c
was	c
very	c
disappointing	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
unpleasantly	c
amazed	i
no	i
discounts	c
were	c
available	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
not	c
have	i
complained	i
if	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
had	c
been	c
open	c
.	c

According	c
to	c
the	c
advertisement	c
,	c
I	c
could	c
visit	c
it	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
lack	c
of	c
customers	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

Modern	c
technology	c
has	c
variety	i
of	c
uses	c
and	c
its	c
possibilities	c
are	c
being	c
widened	c
more	c
and	c
more	c
.	c

They	c
would	c
like	c
me	c
to	c
go	c
for	c
a	c
walk	c
more	c
often	c
or	c
to	c
help	c
them	c
in	c
their	c
daily	c
routine	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
delighted	c
to	c
answer	i
you	i
back	i
to	c
give	c
you	c
more	c
informations	i
about	c
me	c
since	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
such	c
a	c
nice	c
price	i
.	c

It	c
would	c
be	c
nice	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
tent	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
been	c
camping	c
and	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
try	c
it	c
,	c
at	c
least	c
once	c

Yours	c

Like	c
most	c
of	c
the	c
girls	c
I	i
enjoy	c
shopping	c
but	c
it	c
can	c
be	c
either	c
a	c
great	c
moment	i
or	c
a	c
nightmare	c
.	c

Then	c
,	c
you	c
decide	c
to	c
wait	c
for	c
the	c
savings	i
but	c
it	i
is	i
even	c
worse	c
as	c
everybody	c
want	i
to	c
do	c
their	c
shopping	c
at	c
that	c
time	c
and	c
the	c
streets	c
are	c
so	c
crowded	c
you	c
cannot	c
even	c
look	c
for	c
your	c
favourite	c
items	c
.	c

From	c
ten	c
o'clock	c
in	c
the	c
morning	c
till	c
seven	c
o'clock	c
in	c
the	c
afternoon	i
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

As	c
I	c
knew	c
the	c
teknics	i
to	c
break	c
in	i
a	c
place	c
without	c
being	c
noticed	c
,	c
I	c
should	c
not	c
be	i
afraid	c
but	c
tonight	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
steal	c
the	c
most	c
precious	c
diamond	c
in	c
the	c
country	c
which	i
was	c
very	c
well	c
secured	i
.	c

When	c
I	c
got	c
close	c
to	c
the	c
shop	c
,	c
I	c
checked	c
if	c
anyone	c
was	c
around	c
and	c
luckily	c
was	i
not	i
.	c

However	c
,	c
my	c
adventure	c
was	c
not	c
over	c
yet	c
.	c

Suddenly	c
something	c
went	c
wrong	c
,	i
the	i
alarm	c
was	c
making	c
noise	i
.	c

I	c
ran	c
towards	c
the	c
diamond	c
grabed	i
it	c
got	i
out	c
quickly	c
,	c
ran	i
out	c
of	c
the	c
back	c
door	c
.	c

I	c
got	c
into	c
the	c
car	c
gave	i
the	c
jewelry	i
in	c
exchange	c
of	i
my	c
brother	c
,	c
took	c
him	c
and	c
left	c
the	c
place	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
we	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
say	c
,	i
that	c
recently	c
the	i
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
has	c
been	c
seen	c
by	c
one	c
of	c
your	c

Thinking	c
about	c
home	c
like	i
a	c
place	c
to	c
live	c
,	i
is	i
not	i
already	i
worth	i

We	c
need	c
to	c
make	c
our	c
home	c
a	c
place	c
where	c
we	c
want	c
to	c
come	c
back	c
after	i
the	i

school	c

Everything	c
will	c
be	c
faster	c

We	c
will	c

What	c

how	i

for	c

We	c
cannot	i

we	c
might	c

some	c
feelings	c

I	c
would	c
be	c

only	c

I	c

but	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
my	c

I	c
would	c

to	c
be	c
in	c
tents	c

so	c
that	c
I	c
could	i
enjoy	c
a	c
