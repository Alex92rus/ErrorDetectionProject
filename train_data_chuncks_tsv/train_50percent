I	c
went	c
to	c
London	c
for	c
a	c
holiday	c
last	c
week	c
and	c
read	c
the	c
advertisement	c
about	c
'	c
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
'	c
in	c
the	c
hotel	c
which	c
I	c
stayed	c
.	i

I	c
saw	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
were	c
written	c
on	c
the	c
advertisement	c
paper	c
and	c
was	c
very	c
excited	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
did	c
not	c
appear	c
on	c
the	c
stage	c
until	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
musical	c
showing	c
time	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
so	i
long	c
time	c
to	c
wait	c
in	c
the	c
theatre	c
.	c

Thirdly	c
,	c
it	c
mentioned	c
about	c
discounts	c
.	c

I	c
also	c
visited	c
your	c
restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
but	c
already	i
closed	c
because	c
the	c
show	c
finished	c
late	c
.	c

Because	i
of	i
the	c
reason	i
above	c
,	c
I	c
,	c
indeed	c
,	c
spent	c
awful	i
last	c
night	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

Sincerely	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
T-shirts	c
for	c
women	c
are	i
included	i
bra	i
:	c
easy	c
to	c
take	c
it	c
out	c
when	c
you	c
wash	c
it	c
,	c
is	i
very	c
simple	c
and	c
comfortable	c
.	c

What	c
about	c
short	c
pants	c
?	c

We	c
can	c
just	c
put	c
some	c
thin	c
pads	c
in	c
there	c
.	c

We	c
ca	c
n't	c
feel	c
it	c
and	c
easy	c
to	c
remove	c
and	c
just	c
can	i
wash	c
it	c
.	c

Simplest	c
is	c
the	c
best	c
in	c
summer	c
!	c

Because	c
special	c
warm	c
and	c
healthy	c
material	c
will	c
be	c
developed	c
and	c
use	i
them	i
inside	c
thin	c
clothes	c
so	c
we	c
do	c
n't	c
need	c
to	c
put	c
heavy	c
clothes	c
on	c
our	c
bodies	c
.	c

Most	c
important	c
thing	c
is	c
that	c
we	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
to	c
kill	c
the	i
animals	c
only	i
for	c
people	c
's	c
cruel	c
aims	c

DEAR	c
SIR	c
,	c

I	c
WANT	c
TO	c
THAK	i
YOU	c
FOR	c
PREPARING	c
SUCH	c
A	c
GOOD	c
PROGRAMME	c
FOR	c
US	c
AND	c
ESPECIALLY	c
FOR	c
TAKING	c
US	c
TO	i
THE	c
RIVER	c
TRIP	c
TO	c
GREENWICH	c
.	c

I	c
WOULD	c
LIKE	c
TO	c
KNOW	c
IF	c
THERE	c
IS	c
ANY	c
CHANCE	c
OF	c
CHANGING	c
THE	c
PROGRAMME	c
BECAUSE	c
WE	c
HAVE	c
FOUND	c
A	c
VERY	c
INTERESTING	c
ACTIVITY	c
TO	c
DO	c
ON	c
TUESDAY	c
14	c
MARCH	c
.	c

IT	c
CONSISTS	i
ON	i
VISITING	c
THE	c
LONDON	c
FASHION	c
AND	c
LEISURE	c
SHOW	c
IN	i
THE	c
CENTRAL	c
EXHIBITION	c
HALL	c
.	c

I	c
THINK	c
IT	c
'S	c
A	c
GREAT	c
OPPORTUNITY	c
TO	c
MAKE	c
GREATER	c
USE	c
OF	c
OUR	c
KNOWLEDGE	c
OF	c
ENGLISH	i
LANGUAGE	c
.	c

I	c
SUGGEST	c
THAT	c
WE	c
SHOULD	c
GO	c
TO	c
THE	c
NATIONAL	c
ART	c
GALLERY	c
IN	c
THE	c
MORNING	c
AND	c
INSTEAD	c
OF	c
HAVING	c
THE	c
AFTERNOON	c
FREE	c
WE	c
COULD	c
GO	c
TO	c
THE	c
FASHION	c
AND	c
LEISURE	c
SHOW	c
.	c

THE	c
MOST	c
IMPORTANT	c
THING	c
IS	c
THAT	c
,	c
ALTHOUGH	c
THEY	c
ARE	c
FAMOUS	c
,	c
THEY	c
ARE	c
JUST	c
NORMAL	c
PEOPLE	c
THAT	c
DESERVE	c
TO	c
HAVE	c
A	c
PRIVATE	c
LIFE	c
WITHOUT	c
JOURNALISTS	c
AND	c
FANS	c
FOLLOWING	c
THEM	c
ALL	c
THE	c
TIME	c
,	c
AND	c
ON	c
THE	c
OTHER	c
HAND	c
PEOPLE	c
HAVE	c
TO	c
LEARN	c
TO	c
RESPECT	c
THE	c
FAMOUS	i
RIGHT	i
TO	c
KEEP	c
THEIR	c
PERSONAL	c
LIVES	c
IN	i
SECRET	c
.	c

IN	c
MY	c
OPINION	c
FAMOUS	c
PEOPLE	c
ARE	c
BEING	c
OBLIGED	c
TO	c
PAY	c
A	c
PRICE	c
FOR	c
BEING	c
FAMOUS	c
THAT	c
IN	i
SOME	c
CASS	i
,	c
COSTS	c
MORE	c
THAN	c
THEY	c
DESERVE	c
TO	c
PAY	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
something	c
about	c
the	c
three-day	c
trip	c
to	c
London	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
seen	c
your	c
programme	c
for	c
the	c
trip	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
a	c
great	c
trip	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
organising	c
this	c
trip	c
and	c
putting	c
all	c
your	c
spare	c
time	c
and	c
effort	c
into	c
it	c
.	c

That	c
is	c
why	c
I	c
think	c
the	c
trip	c
to	c
the	c
science	c
museum	c
is	c
a	c
good	c
idea	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
my	c
class	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
seen	c
an	c
advertisement	c
about	i
a	c
fashion	c
and	c
leisure	c
show	c
.	c

We	c
are	c
attracted	c
to	c
this	c
show	c
and	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
on	c
14th	c
March	c
,	c
which	c
is	c
the	c
day	c
we	c
will	c
be	c
visiting	c
the	c
science	c
museum	c
.	c

This	c
show	c
is	c
on	c
the	c
14th	c
March	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
in	c
the	c
Central	c
Exhibition	c
Hall	c
and	c
will	c
start	c
and	i
ten	c
o'clock	c
and	c
finish	c
at	c
five	c
o'clock	c
in	c
the	c
evening	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
based	c
on	c
fashion	c
.	c

If	c
we	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
we	c
can	c
do	c
without	c
the	c
free	c
time	c
.	c

In	c
a	c
country	c
like	c
the	c
UK	c
,	c
we	c
are	c
all	c
bound	c
to	c
have	c
houses	c
.	c

We	c
either	c
own	c
it	c
,	c
or	c
we	c
simply	c
borrow	c
it	c
from	c
other	c
people	c
.	c

We	c
take	c
our	c
homes	c
for	c
granted	c
.	c

Think	c
about	c
the	c
people	c
in	c
the	c
poor	c
countries	c
!	c

Have	c
you	c
ever	c
thought	c
about	c
how	c
the	c
changes	c
will	c
affect	c
our	c
lives	c
?	c

I	c
doubt	c
it	c
.	c

For	c
one	c
,	c
the	c
future	c
homes	i
might	c
not	c
be	c
built	c
out	c
of	c
bricks	c
at	c
all	c
!	c

Non-breakable	c
glass	c
.	c

Also	c
,	c
due	c
to	c
global	c
warming	c
,	c
sea	c
levels	c
might	c
rise	c
and	c
risk	i
of	c
flooding	c
will	c
also	c
rise	c
.	c

All	c
domestic	c
appliances	c
such	c
as	c
showers	c
,	c
kettles	c
,	c
lights	c
,	c
TV	c
and	c
curtains	c
may	c
be	c
voice	c
activated	c
.	c

Incredibly	c
high	c
security	c
will	c
prevent	c
robbery	c
.	c

The	c
future	c
homes	c
will	c
also	c
have	c
many	c
similarities	c
,	c
such	c
as	c
having	c
a	c
separate	c
bathroom	c
,	c
and	c
not	c
having	c
one	c
in	c
a	c
bedroom	c
,	c
or	c
having	c
two	c
floors	c
or	c
having	c
garages	c
.	c

What	c
do	c
you	c
think	c
will	c
happen	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
?	c

Dear	c
Mrs.	c
Jane	i
Clark	c
,	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
this	c
letter	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
giving	c
a	i
possibility	i
to	c
know	c
more	c
about	c
modern	c
art	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
only	c
six	c
countries	c
were	c
represented	c
this	c
year	c
at	c
the	c
festival	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
hope	c
that	c
soon	c
there	c
would	i
be	i
much	i
more	c
of	c
them	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
,	i
you	c
should	c
make	i
some	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

Then	i
,	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
say	c
,	i
that	c
plays	i
and	c
films	c
were	c
exellent	i
,	c
but	c
it	i
was	i
n't	i
enough	c
of	c
them	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

May	i
be	i
you	c
should	c
make	i
more	c
next	c
year	c
?	i

And	c
at	i
the	i
end	i
,	c
my	c
opinion	c
is	c
that	c
one	c
weekend	c
ticket	c
for	c
all	c
events	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
idea	c
,	c
because	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
to	c
stay	i
in	c
queues	c
to	c
buy	c
a	c
ticket	c
for	c
a	c
show	c
,	i
you	c
want	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

Dear	c
Lucia	c
,	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
pleased	c
to	c
receive	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

You	c
asked	c
,	i
if	c
there	c
are	c
some	c
school	c
rules	c
in	c
my	c
country	c
.	c

I	c
'll	c
give	c
you	c
an	c
example	c
.	c

The	c
fine	c
for	c
smoking	c
on	c
the	c
Academy	i
is	i
territory	i
is	c
100	c
dollars	c
.	c

The	c
only	c
rule	c
for	c
me	c
at	c
home	c
is	c
to	c
walk	c
out	i
with	i
my	c
dog	c
three	c
times	c
a	c
day	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
,	c

I	c
was	i
to	c
Circle	i
Theatre	c
to	c
watch	c
'	i
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
'	c
musical	c
show	c
,	c
recently	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
trully	i
dissapointed	i
by	c
it	c
.	c

My	c
expectations	c
were	c
high	c
after	c
I	i
've	i
read	c
your	c
leaflet	c
in	c
which	c
it	c
was	c
advertised	c
as	c
'	c
London	c
's	c
newest	c
and	c
best	c
musical	c
show	c
'	c
.	c

Now	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
assure	c
you	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
wait	c
fourty-five	i
minutes	c
before	c
the	c
show	c
finally	c
began	c
.	c

You	c
can	c
believe	c
me	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
'	c
my	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
'	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
no	c
other	c
choice	c
than	c
asking	i
to	i
give	c
my	i
money	c
back	c
.	c

I	c
'd	c
like	c
you	c
to	c
send	c
the	c
money	c
to	c
this	c
adress	i

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

When	c
Paul	c
entered	c
the	c
school	c
gate	c
,	c
other	c
children	c
began	c
to	c
tease	c
him	c
and	c
laugh	c
.	c

Normally	c
,	c
he	c
would	c
go	c
and	c
talk	c
to	c
Pat	c
but	c
Pat	c
betrayed	c
him	c
.	c

They	c
were	c
no	c
longer	c
friends	c
.	c

'	c
How	c
could	c
he	c
,	c
'	c
Paul	c
thought	c
'	c
Now	c
the	c
whole	c
school	c
knows	c
Jean	c
attracts	c
me	c
'	c
.	c

As	c
he	c
was	c
sitting	c
there	c
,	c
he	c
heard	c
someone	c
walking	c
towards	c
him	c
.	c

Jean	c
.	c

'	c
What	c
are	c
you	c
dong	i
here	c
,	i
why	i
are	c
n't	c
you	c
at	c
school	c
?	c
'	c
she	c
asked	c
.	c

Paul	c
was	c
like	i
paralyzed	c
.	c

He	c
could	c
n't	c
reply	c
.	c

All	c
the	c
children	c
were	c
staring	c
at	c
them	c
and	c
Paul	c
thought	c
that	c
Pat	c
is	i

that	c
bad	c
at	c
all	c

Dear	c
friend	c

The	c
group	c
asked	c
me	c
make	i
sure	c
that	c
in	c
the	c
fridge	c
they	c
always	c
could	c
find	c
a	c
big	i
variety	c
of	c
drinks	c
including	c
honey	c
and	c
lemon	c
for	c
throat	i
.	c

Other	i
thing	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
is	i
keep	c
an	c
eye	c
in	i
the	c
towels	c
,	c
I	c
mean	c
,	c
dried	i
towels	c
because	c
as	c
you	c
know	c
that	c
country	c
is	c
too	c
hot	c
,	c
especially	c
for	c
my	c
liking	c
,	c
as	i
they	c
have	c
to	c
change	c
the	i
clothes	c
and	c
looks	i
fresh	c
;	c
do	c
n't	c
ask	c
me	c
why	c
.	c

I	c
just	c
did	c
not	c
enjoyed	i
when	i
they	c
were	c
making	i
the	i
instruments	i
work	c
for	c
the	c
big	c
day	c
.	c

Do	c
n't	c
be	c
jealous	c
,	c
I	c
will	c
make	c
a	c
copy	c
for	c
you	c
,	c
OK	c
?	c

Love	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
with	c
regard	c
to	c
the	c
International	c
Art	c
Festival	c
that	c
was	c
held	c
recently	c
.	c

The	c
festival	c
was	c
excenent	i
in	c
many	c
ways	c
,	c
and	c
especially	i
it	c
being	c
an	c
international	c
festival	c
was	c
a	c
challenging	c
,	c
but	c
brilliant	c
idea	c
.	c

I	c
assume	c
that	c
this	c
fact	c
attracted	c
people	c
very	c
much	c
.	c

I	c
personally	c
think	c
that	c
it	c
helped	c
many	c
people	c
who	c
were	c
not	c
able	c
to	c
afford	c
the	c
tickets	c
with	i
proper	i
price	c
to	c
come	c
to	c
the	c
festival	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
most	c
of	c
the	c
events	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
were	c
fantastic	c
.	c

The	c
festival	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
be	c
an	c
international	c
one	c
,	c
but	c
the	c
artists	c
and	c
stars	c
participated	i
in	c
it	c
were	c
from	c
six	c
countries	c
only	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
I	c
found	c
that	c
there	c
were	c
not	c
many	c
genres	c
of	i
neither	i
the	i
films	i
nor	i
the	c
plays	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
suggest	c
you	c
have	c
various	c
kinds	c
,	c
and	c
more	c
numbers	i
of	i
plays	c
and	c
films	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

People	c
all	c
have	c
different	c
opinions	c
about	c
books	c
.	c

Some	c
prefer	c
realistic	c
stories	c
whereas	c
others	c
do	i
unusual	c
ones	c
.	c

Above	c
all	c
,	c
realistic	c
stories	c
teach	c
me	c
something	c
of	i
the	i
life	c
,	c
or	c
at	c
least	c
influence	c
me	c
.	c

Here	c
,	c
the	c
fishman	c
is	c
very	c
old	c
,	c
but	c
he	c
is	c
still	c
challenging	c
to	i
everything	c
he	c
faces	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
to	c
that	c
,	c
realistic	c
stories	c
are	c
more	c
attractive	c
,	c
I	c
personally	c
do	c
n't	c
want	c
to	c
hear	c
stories	c
about	c
very	c
peculiar	c
incidents	c
as	c
I	c
know	c
they	c
cannot	c
be	c
true	c
.	c

But	c
,	c
while	c
reading	c
realistic	c
stories	c
,	c
I	c
just	c
fall	c
deep	c
into	c
the	c
story	c
,	c
into	c
the	c
writer	c
's	c
own	c
world	c
.	c

So	c
when	c
I	c
read	c
other	i
sharks	c
eating	c
the	c
shark	c
the	c
old	c
man	c
had	c
caught	c
,	c
I	c
got	c
very	c
angry	c
and	c
annoyed	c
.	c

Realistic	c
stories	c
thus	c
,	c
develop	c
our	c
imagination	c
and	c
creativity	c
,	c
which	c
are	c
essential	c
in	c
our	c
lives	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
disappointing	i
a	i
week	i
holiday	c
for	i
me	i
because	c
I	c
had	c
got	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
problem	i
with	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
seen	c
the	i
advertisement	c
that	c
the	c
actors	c
were	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
really	c
disappointing	i
because	c
he	c
is	c
my	c
famous	i
actor	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
asked	i
for	c
the	c
discount	c
of	i
ticket	i
in	i
the	c
cashier	c
desk	c
they	c
told	c
me	c
no	c
discount	c
available	i
for	i
this	i
.	c

I	c
had	c
seen	c
the	c
advertisement	c
say	i
that	c
discount	i
available	i
.	c

It	c
closed	c
at	c
10	c
pm	c
but	c
the	c
show	c
finished	c
at	c
10.30	c
pm	c
.	c

This	c
was	c
not	c
perfect	i
evening	c
for	c
me	c
,	c
so	c
if	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
give	c
my	i
money	c
back	c
,	c
I	c
will	c
tell	c
to	i
the	c
newspaper	c
about	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hear	i
a	i
good	c
new	i
.	c

Boo	c
Sersuwan	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
in	c
the	c
next	c
100	c
years	c
people	c
will	c
wear	c
the	i
space	i
clothes	i
with	c
small	i
engine	c
in	c
the	c
back	c
.	i

The	c
atmosphere	c
in	i
the	c
earth	c
now	i
starting	i
badly	c
every	c
years	i
.	c

The	c
carbon	i
dioxide	c
are	i
growing	c
very	c
fast	c
and	c
people	c
cut	c
more	i
trees	c
,	c
therefore	c
not	i
enough	c
trees	c
to	c
such	i
carbon	c
dioxide	c
and	c
produce	c
oxygen	c
.	c

The	c
designer	i
will	c
have	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
idea	i
for	i
how	c
to	c
make	c
very	c
nice	c
and	c
useful	c
clothes	c
.	c

This	c
is	i
a	c
new	c
business	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
I	c
can	c
win	c
this	c
price	i
,	c
because	c
this	i
clothe	i
will	c
produce	i
in	c
the	i
future	i
soon	i

mr.	c
MANAGER	c

FIRST	c
OF	c
ALL	c
ON	i
THE	c
ADVERTISEMENT	c
FOR	c
THE	c
SHOW	c
IT	c
SAYS	i
THAT	c
THE	c
ACTOR	c
WAS	c
GOING	c
TO	c
BE	c
DANNY	c
BROOK	c
AND	c
INSTEAD	c
OF	c
HIM	c
WAS	i
A	c
TOTALLY	c
UNKNOWN	c
CLOWN	c
THAT	c
HAD	c
NO	c
IDEA	c
OF	c
HOW	c
TO	c
ACT	c
,	i
IT	c
WAS	c
HORRIBLY	c
DISAPPOINTING	c
!	c

SECOND	c
I	c
GOT	c
TO	c
THE	c
THEATRE	c
AT	c
19.20	c
BECAUSE	c
IN	c
THE	c
ADVERTISEMENT	c
IT	c
CLEARLY	c
APPEARS	i
THAT	c
THE	c
SHOW	c
STARTS	c
AT	c
19.30	c
,	c
AND	c
I	c
GOT	c
HEAVILY	i
MAD	c
WHEN	c
I	c
LOOK	i
MY	i
WATCH	c
AND	c
NOTICE	i
THAT	c
I	c
HAD	c
BEEN	c
WAITING	c
FOR	c
40	c
(	c
FORTY	c
)	c
MINUTES	c
AND	c
THE	c
SHOW	c
DID	i
N'T	i
START	i
YET	c
...	c

AFTER	c
THE	c
SHOW	c
I	c
GOT	c
OUT	c
THE	i
SHOW	i
ROOM	i
DEEPLY	c
DISAPPOINTED	c
AND	c
WENT	c
TO	c
THE	c
RESTAURANT	c
TO	c
DRINK	c
SOMETHING	c
TO	c
RELAX	c
,	c
AND	c
DO	c
YOU	c
KNOW	c
WHAT	c
?	c
.	c
.	c

I	c
COULD	c
N'T	c
BELIVE	i
IT	c
HOW	i
THIS	i
CLASS	i
OF	i
THEATRE	i
CAN	i
BE	c
SO	c
.	c

I	c
THINK	c
THAT	c
MODERN	c
TECHNOLOGY	c
HAS	c
AFFECTED	c
ALL	c
THE	i
HUMAN	c
BEINGS	c
.	c

ANOTHER	c
EXAMPLE	c
IS	c
THE	i
COMPUTERS	c
,	i
I	c
THINK	c
THEY	c
ARE	c
ONE	i
OF	c
THE	c
MOST	c
ADVANCED	c
MACHINE	i
IN	c
THE	c
WORLD	c
,	i
YOU	c
CAN	c
LIVE	c
YOUR	c
ENTIRE	c
LIFE	c
IN	c
A	c
HOUSE	c
WITHOUT	c
GOING	c
OUT	c
,	c
BY	i
JUST	i
USING	c
THE	c
INTERNET	c
,	i
IT	c
HAS	c
ALSO	c
HELPED	c
ME	c
IN	i
MY	c
SCHOOL	i
HOMEWORK	c
,	i
I	c
MEAN	c
IT	c
'S	c
INCREDIBLE	c
THE	c
TIME	c
YOU	c
WAIST	i
BY	c
MAKING	i
THING	i
WITHOUT	c
A	c
COMPUTER	c
.	c

1th	i
,	i
June	i
,	i
2000	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
!	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
tents	c
to	c
log	c
cabins	c
.	c

Camping	c
is	c
my	c
enthusiasm	i
and	c
I	c
sleep	c
in	c
tents	c
every	c
time	c
I	c
go	c
camping	c
.	c

Therefore	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
afraid	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
get	c
used	c
to	c
log	c
cabins	c
easily	c
.	c

Besides	c
camping	c
,	c
I	c
also	c
like	c
painting	c
.	c

My	c
Dad	c
is	c
an	c
amateur	c
painter	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
begun	i
painting	c
for	c
8	c
years	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
good	c
at	c
portraits	c
and	c
landscapes	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
also	c
like	c
to	c
play	c
golf	c
during	c
my	c
holiday	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
played	c
it	c
before	c
,	i
will	i
I	c
get	c
any	c
tuition	c
?	c

How	i
is	c
the	c
weather	c
like	c
in	c
California	c
in	c
July	c
?	c

If	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
buy	c
some	c
gifts	c
,	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
should	c
I	c
take	c
and	c
can	c
I	c
use	c
traveller	c
's	c
cheques	c
in	c
every	c
place	c
?	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c

It	c
's	c
always	c
a	c
great	c
job	i
to	c
go	c
home	c
with	c
bags	c
of	c
purchases	c
,	c
but	c
is	c
it	c
doing	c
us	c
good	i
apart	c
from	c
the	c
temporary	c
satisfaction	c
?	c

But	c
you	c
'll	c
find	c
your	c
'	c
cool	c
bargain	c
'	c
soon	c
get	i
out	c
of	c
date	c
and	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
keep	c
buying	c
new	c
ones	c
.	c

Therefore	c
,	c
we	c
become	c
impulsive	c
buyers	c
easily	c
under	c
these	i
tricks	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
not	c
hard	c
to	c
realise	c
how	c
exhausted	c
we	c
are	c
after	c
a	c
day	c
of	c
shopping	c
.	c

Think	c
of	c
the	c
awful	c
crowds	c
,	c
the	c
busy	c
car	c
parks	c
,	c
polluted	c
air	c
in	c
the	c
city	c
centres	c
and	c
mile-long	c
queues	c
in	c
front	c
of	c
the	c
cash	c
desks	c
.	c

Dear	c
Manager	c
,	c

You	i
have	i
informed	i
the	i
actor	i
,	i
times	i
,	i
discount	i
and	i
the	i
restaurant	i
to	i
people	i
,	i
but	i
actually	i
what	i
did	i
you	i
do	i
?	i

The	i
first	i
,	c
you	c
have	c
changed	c
the	c
actor	c
.	c

The	i
second	i
,	c
the	i
time	i
is	i
late	i
from	i
19.30	i
,	i
it	i
started	i
20.15	i
.	c

The	i
third	i
,	c
the	i
tickets	i
have	i
not	i
the	i
discount	i
.	c

The	i
last	i
,	c
after	c
show	i
,	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
restaurant	c
,	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

What	c
's	c
happened	c
?	c

This	c
is	c
the	i
famous	c
theatre	c
.	c

You	c
know	c
,	c
What	c
did	c
people	c
feel	c
?	c

If	c
you	c
can	i
not	i
managed	i
the	c
programe	i
,	c
why	c
did	i
you	c
informe	i
people	c
before	c
programe	i
start	i
?	c

If	i
we	i
came	i
back	i
to	i
the	i
past	i
,	i
we	i
felt	i
everything	i
,	i
it	i
was	i
so	i
difficult	i
to	i
do	i
,	i
we	i
would	i
have	i
plane	i
and	i
done	i
by	i
ourself	i
and	i
last	i
time	i
.	c

How	c
has	c
modern	c
technology	c
changed	c
your	c
daily	i
life	c
?	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
,	c

Regarding	c
the	c
programme	c
you	c
have	c
organised	c
,	c
it	i
is	i
great	i
ideas	i
everything	i
that	i
you	i
have	i
planed	i
,	c
but	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
suggest	c
to	i
you	i
something	c
that	c
the	c
students	c
saw	c
in	c
an	c
advertisement	c
.	c

The	c
idea	c
about	i
going	c
to	c
science	i
museum	c
is	c
fantastic	c
,	i
I	c
read	c
about	c
the	c
museum	c
,	c
it	i
is	c
really	c
interesting	c
in	i
science	i
history	i
.	c

Freedom	c
!	c

Nowadays	c
the	c
main	c
attroction	i
in	c
the	c
newspapers	c
and	c
television	i
is	c
private	i
life	i
of	c
famous	c
people	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
really	c
interesting	c
how	c
people	c
like	c
knowing	i
famous	i
people	i
life	i
.	c

Without	c
someone	c
famous	c
know	i
,	c
photographs	i
take	c
pictures	c
secretly	c
,	c
try	i
to	c
get	c
money	c
on	i
it	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
"	c
which	i
was	c
performed	c
in	c
your	c
theatre	c
two	c
weeks	c
ago	c
.	c

I	c
went	c
to	c
see	c
it	c
on	c
5th	c
June	c
2000	c
.	c

Then	c
at	c
the	c
tickets-office	i
I	c
was	c
said	i
that	c
no	c
discounts	c
were	c
available	c
so	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
pay	c
the	c
full	c
prize	i
despite	c
I	i
am	c
a	c
student	c
.	c

Finally	c
I	c
would	c
have	c
had	c
dinner	c
at	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
if	c
it	c
had	c
not	c
been	i
already	i
closed	c
because	c
the	c
show	c
finished	c
,	c
obviously	c
,	c
late	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
really	c
not	c
satisfied	c
with	c
the	c
show-organization	i
particularly	c
because	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
you	c
wrote	c
something	c
different	i
.	c

For	c
this	c
reason	c
I	c
expect	c
to	c
receive	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

Last	c
week	c
we	c
had	c
another	c
demostration	i
of	c
this	c
.	c

On	c
Monday	c
we	c
decided	c
to	c
organize	c
a	c
surprise-party	i
for	c
Ted	c
's	c
birthday	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
evening	c
.	c

Anna	c
prepared	i
the	c
cake	c
,	c
Peter	c
organized	c
the	c
music	c
,	c
Heather	c
and	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
buy	c
the	c
present	c
;	c
Pat	c
said	c
:	c
"	c
OK	c
I	i
'll	c
phone	c
to	i
some	c
of	c
Ted	c
's	c
friends	c
to	c
invite	c
them	c
"	c
.	c

Obviously	c
Ted	c
should	c
have	i
known	c
nothing	i
about	c
it	c
and	c
we	c
remembered	i
it	i
to	i
Pat	i
twice	c
:	c
"	c
the	i
party	c
is	c
a	c
secret	c
!	c
!	c
"	c
and	c
she	c
said	c
:	c
"	c
Yes	c
,	c
it	c
must	c
be	c
a	c
surprise	c
!	c
"	c

In	i
that	c
moment	c
she	c
understood	c
that	c
something	c
was	c
wrong	c
!	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
,	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
organising	c
good	i
programme	c
,	c
especially	i
like	c
sightseeing	i
from	i
River	i
trip	i
to	i
Greenwich	i
in	c
London	c
for	c
three	c
days	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
on	c
behalf	c
of	c
my	c
classmates	c
to	c
give	c
the	i
information	c
of	i
'	c
The	c
London	c
Fashion	c
And	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
'	c
which	c
we	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
and	i
to	c
huggest	i
our	c
opinion	c
.	c

We	c
have	c
seen	c
an	c
advertisement	c
of	i
last	c
Saturday	i
'	c
The	c
Times	c
'	c
edition	c
of	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
we	c
will	c
be	c
able	c
to	i
see	i
leisure	i
and	i
sports	i
wear	i
about	i
fashion	i
trend	i
of	i
next	i
year	i
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
we	c
can	c
see	c
how	c
to	c
make	i
up	i
and	c
make	i
better	c
hairstyle	i
in	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

We	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
if	c
it	c
is	c
possible	c
to	c
change	c
your	c
programme	c
.	c

We	c
would	c
be	c
grateful	c
if	c
we	c
could	c
go	c
there	c
in	c
the	c
afternoon	c
on	c
14	c
March	c
because	c
we	c
are	c
able	c
to	c
go	c
shopping	c
.	c

We	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
dangerous	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
knew	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
.	c

Whenever	c
I	c
recollet	i
it	c
,	c
I	c
feel	c
self-confident	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
was	c
twenty	c
years	c
old	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
go	c
to	i
Army	i
.	c

As	c
you	c
know	c
,	c
my	c
country	c
has	c
been	c
separated	c
into	c
two	c
countries	c
(	c
South	c
and	c
North	c
Korea	c
)	c
.	c

One	c
year	c
later	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
working	c
in	c
Kang-nam	c
police	c
station	c
in	c
Seoul	c
.	c

Suddenly	c
,	c
the	c
theft	i
signal	i
came	c
into	i
.	c

So	c
,	c
another	c
policeman	c
and	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
arrive	c
at	c
the	c
accident	c
place	c
quickly	c
.	c

When	c
we	c
arrived	c
at	c
the	c
place	c
which	i
it	c
happened	c
,	c
one	c
man	c
started	c
running	c
away	c
.	c

Without	c
any	c
thought	c
,	c
I	c
ran	c
quickly	c
like	c
a	c
swallow	c
.	c

Then	c
,	c
he	c
tried	c
to	c
go	c
over	c
the	c
wall	c
,	c
I	c
held	c
his	c
leg	c
.	c

As	c
a	c
result	c
,	c
I	c
could	c
go	c
on	c
vacation	c
.	c

Therefore	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
in	c
spite	c
of	c
it	c
being	c
dangerous	c
.	c

Dear	c
Competition	c
Organiser	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
replay	i
your	i
letter	c
and	c
to	c
ask	c
more	i
details	c
about	c
the	c
competition	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
I	c
'm	c
very	c
glad	c
to	c
have	c
been	c
choosen	i
and	c
I	c
will	c
do	c
my	c
best	c
for	c
this	c
competition	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
asked	c
in	c
the	c
letter	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
only	c
on	i
july	i
because	c
I	c
work	c
at	c
the	c
central	c
library	c
and	c
I	c
'm	c
also	c
having	c
English	c
classes	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
will	c
just	c
have	c
holidays	c
on	i
July	c
.	c

Is	c
it	i
suitable	c
for	c
you	c
?	c

As	c
you	c
mentioned	c
about	c
the	c
accomodation	i
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
stay	i
in	c
the	i
tents	i
,	c
because	c
it	c
's	c
more	c
exciting	c
and	c
I	c
really	c
love	c
camping	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
choose	c
sailing	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
facinating	i
with	c
the	c
sea	c
and	c
it	i
's	i
misteries	i
and	c
I	c
also	c
like	c
the	c
watter	i
,	c
the	c
wind	c
in	c
my	c
face	c
...	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
receiving	c
your	c
prompt	c
replay	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
some	c
news	c
and	c
to	c
ask	c
a	c
little	c
bit	c
about	c
you	c
.	c

Although	c
it	i
was	i
5.000	i
thousand	c
people	c
there	c
,	c
people	c
could	c
walk	c
and	c
dance	c
without	c
any	c
problem	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
very	c
well	c
organised	c
,	i
the	i
shows	i
started	c
in	i
the	i
exactly	c
time	i
and	c
the	c
group	c
were	i
well	i
performed	i
too	c
.	c

However	c
the	i
success	c
of	c
the	c
concert	c
,	c
at	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
show	i
some	c
full	i
gays	i
started	c
a	c
big	c
confusion	i
and	c
some	c
people	c
get	i
hurt	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
depressing	c
...	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
some	c
news	c
about	c
you	c
,	i
What	c
have	c
you	c
done	c
?	c

Be	i
you	c
studing	i
a	c

can	i
not	i
belive	i
that	c
I	c

man	c
and	c
now	c
I	c

I	c
would	c

the	c
best	c
Basketball	i

and	c
I	c

Your	i
sincerely	c

I	c

enjoyed	c

but	c
nowday	i
some	i

I	c
can	i
not	i

things	i
every	c
day	c
,	c
even	c
when	c
I	c

I	c
alway	i
try	c
to	c

something	c
to	c
use	c
instead	c
of	i
that	i
things	i

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
,	c

Moreover	c
I	i
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
why	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
which	i
is	c
my	c
favourite	c
actor	c
,	c
did	c
n't	c
play	i
in	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
must	c
say	c
that	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
very	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
get	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

Your	i
faithfully	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

I	c
wish	c
I	c
had	c
know	i
it	c
two	c
days	c
ago	c
...	c

Exacly	i
on	i
15th	c
June	c
we	c
were	c
at	c
the	c
birthday	c
party	c
.	c

Dora	c
wanted	c
me	c
to	c
come	c
with	c
Pat	c
because	c
she	c
was	c
in	c
love	c
with	c
him	c
.	c

I	c
thought	c
that	c
if	c
I	c
said	c
something	c
specific	c
about	c
her	c
he	c
would	c
look	c
at	c
her	c
in	c
a	c
different	c
way	c
.	c

Yesterday	c
I	i
discovered	c
that	c
he	c
told	c
everything	c
to	c
Marl	c
and	c
Tony	c
.	c

Firstly	c
when	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
show	c
it	c
was	c
writing	i
that	c
the	c
starting	i
time	c
was	c
19.30	c
but	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
quarter	c
past	c
eight	c
I	i
had	c
waitted	i
for	c
fourthey	i
five	i
minutes	c
.	c

Secondly	c
the	c
stars	c
were	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
DANNY	c
BROOK	c
and	c
TINA	c
TRUELOVE	c
but	c
different	c
people	c
came	c
to	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
the	c
first	c
time	c
I	c
was	i
going	i
to	i
go	i
to	c
a	c
musical	c
show	c
but	c
I	c
guess	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
the	c
last	c
one	c
too	c
.	c

And	c
as	i
last	i
that	c
was	c
the	c
worse	i
night	c
I	c
had	c
ever	c
had	c
so	c
I	c
asked	c
for	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
but	c
they	c
would	c
n't	c
give	c
it	i
so	c
I	c
had	c
an	c
argument	c
with	c
the	c
people	c
Who	i
worked	c
their	i
but	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
get	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

She	c
saw	c
me	c
as	c
I	c
was	c
smoking	c
so	c
that	c
was	c
n't	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
very	c
good	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mister	c

As	c
my	c
husband	c
is	c
a	c
native	c
and	c
we	c
live	c
in	c
Switzerland	c
,	c
we	c
apreciate	i
to	i
pass	i
a	c
week	c
in	c
London	c
every	c
year	c
.	c

We	c
are	c
keen	c
on	c
theatre	c
and	c
musical	c
show	i
.	c

Anyway	c
we	c
had	c
a	c
very	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
.	c

Then	c
the	c
spectacle	i
began	c
45	c
minutes	c
later	c
than	c
mentioned	i
.	c

The	c
kids	c
were	c
by	i
their	c
grandmother	c
,	c
who	c
take	i
care	c
of	c
them	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
so	c
hot	c
,	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
go	c
for	c
a	c
swim	c
in	c
tutry	c
,	c
although	c
I	c
had	c
n't	c
any	i
swimming-clothes	i
.	c

I	c
knew	c
a	c
good	c
place	c
.	c

As	c
I	c
had	c
planed	i
,	c
the	c
place	c
was	c
deserted	c
.	c

I	c
took	c
my	c
clothes	c
of	i
and	c
swam	c
twenty	i
minutes	c
in	c
the	c
lake	c
.	c

The	c
car	c
was	c
missing	c
too	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
a	c
police	c
car	c
drove	c
by	c
and	c
the	c
policeman	c
saw	c
me	c
standing	c
there	c
nude	c
.	c

They	c
drove	c
me	c
to	c
their	c
office	c
after	c
having	c
given	c
me	c
use	i
of	i
their	i
shirt	c
.	c

I	c
felt	c
so	c
miserable	c
that	c
Pat	c
laughed	c
seeing	i
me	c
.	c

If	c
only	c
Pat	c
could	c
keep	c
secrets	c
!	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c

In	i
the	i
name	i
of	i
the	c
class	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
the	c
excellent	c
programme	c
you	c
have	c
organised	c
,	c
especially	c
the	c
idea	c
of	c
visiting	c
a	c
galery	i
.	c

However	c
,	c
we	c
have	c
seen	c
an	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
It	i
would	i
be	i
on	c
the	c
13th	c
of	c
March	c
from	c
10.00	c
to	c
19.00	c
.	c

We	c
are	c
all	c
very	c
interested	c
in	c
the	c
show	c
because	c
England	i
people	c
have	c
a	c
different	c
kind	c
of	c
life	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

I	c
had	c
always	c
wanted	c
to	c
swim	c
in	i
the	i
middle	i
of	i
sharks	c
.	c

My	c
father	c
was	c
a	c
captain	c
on	c
a	c
huge	c
boat	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
child	c
,	c
I	c
used	c
to	c
go	c
with	c
him	c
travelling	c
from	c
harbours	i
to	c
harbours	i
.	c

I	c
grew	c
up	c
through	i
the	i
water	i
world	i
and	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
live	c
whitout	i
it	c
.	c

I	c
got	c
the	c
strange	c
feeling	c
I	c
could	c
jump	c
and	c
follow	c
them	c
.	c

Since	c
this	c
famous	i
experience	c
,	c
I	c
dreamt	c
every	i
night	i
about	i
that	i
.	c

One	c
Saturday	c
I	c
got	c
on	i
my	c
motorboat	c
and	c
rode	c
far	c
away	c
from	c
the	c
reef	c
.	c

Some	c
minutes	c
later	c
I	c
was	c
doing	c
it	c
,	c
spending	c
time	c
with	c
the	c
fish	c
,	c
swimming	c
round	c
the	c
sharks	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
done	c
what	c
I	c
had	c
never	c
expected	c
to	c
do	c
.	c

Now	c
I	c
can	c
die	c
in	c
freedom	c
.	c

I	c
went	c
to	c
your	c
show	c
called	c
"	c
Over	c
The	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
really	c
disappointing	i
in	i
many	c
points	i
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
you	c
spoke	c
about	c
two	c
actors	c
Danny	i
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
,	c
instead	i
of	c
them	c
we	c
had	c
two	c
others	c
and	c
they	c
were	c
really	c
bad	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
was	c
really	c
surprised	c
.	c

How	c
could	c
we	c
appreciate	c
the	c
show	c
properly	c
.	c

Then	c
you	c
offered	i
people	c
to	c
visit	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
there	c
is	i
no	c
staff	c
to	c
welcome	c
the	i
people	c
.	c

You	c
offered	c
something	c
impossible	i
to	i
do	i
.	c

O.	c
Labro	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

She	c
could	c
n't	c
keep	c
my	c
secret	c
and	c
everybody	c
knew	c
which	c
boy	c
I	c
was	c
in	c
love	c
with	c
.	c

I	c
followed	c
her	c
and	c
caught	c
her	c
to	c
push	c
her	c
on	i
the	c
ground	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
n't	c
go	c
back	c
to	c
the	c
class	c
so	c
I	c
went	c
home	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
class	c
and	c
everybody	c
was	c
laughing	c
at	c
me	c
and	c
the	c
boy	c
told	c
them	c
to	c
stopped	i
because	c
he	c
loved	c
me	c
and	c
wanted	c
to	c
be	c
with	c
me	c
.	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
:	c

I	c
am	c
now	c
writing	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
the	c
information	c
you	c
have	c
asked	c
about	i
me	c
:	c

About	c
the	c
activities	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
do	c
Basketball	c
and	c
Surfing	c
.	c

I	c
play	c
Basketball	c
at	c
school	c
twice	c
a	c
week	c
and	c
I	c
enjoy	c
it	c
.	c

There	c
are	c
some	c
things	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
:	i
the	c
tipe	i
(	c
and	c
quantity	c
)	c
of	c
Clothes	c
I	c
will	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
,	c
if	i
it	c
is	c
necessary	c
to	c
take	c
some	c
money	c
and	i
any	c
additional	c
stuff	c
(	c
like	c
raincoates	i
)	c
.	c

Well	c
,	c
that	c
would	i
be	i
all	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
receiving	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

The	c
good	c
always	c
wins	i
,	c
and	c
we	c
are	c
told	c
that	c
the	c
other	c
part	c
is	c
bad	c
,	c
and	c
that	c
is	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
the	c
story	c
.	c

But	c
is	c
n't	c
evil	c
interesting	c
?	c

On	i
the	c
tale	c
"	c
It	c
's	c
a	c
good	c
life	c
"	c
,	c
the	c
author	c
gives	c
much	c
more	c
emphasis	c
to	c
the	i
Witte	c
Anthony	c
than	c
to	c
anyone	c
else	c
in	c
the	c
story	c
.	c

Although	c
the	c
other	c
people	c
on	i
the	c
story	c
are	c
the	c
good	c
ones	c
and	c
suffer	c
with	i
his	c
domination	c
,	c
they	c
are	c
quite	c
poor	c
and	c
empty	c
,	c
not	c
interesting	c
and	c
not	c
well	c
described	c
,	c
meanwhile	c
Anthony	c
is	c
a	c
very	c
interesting	c
and	c
different	c
person	c
,	c
and	c
all	c
his	c
thoughts	c
are	c
told	c
us	i
by	c
the	c
author	c
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
even	c
though	c
we	c
know	c
that	c
this	c
character	c
is	c
good	c
and	c
this	c
one	c
is	c
bad	c
,	c
sometimes	c
the	c
good	c
ones	c
are	c
quite	c
boring	c
,	c
and	c
we	c
find	c
the	c
bad	c
one	i
much	c
more	c
interesting	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
The	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
which	c
is	c
very	c
different	c
from	c
what	i
it	i
have	i
shown	i
.	c

I	c
went	c
to	c
your	c
theatre	c
last	c
saturday	i
,	c
about	i
7.	c
p.m.	c
I	c
asked	c
for	c
discounts	c
.	c

I	c
did	c
not	c
care	c
about	c
money	i
and	c
I	c
rushed	c
into	c
and	i
then	c
took	c
a	c
seat	c
with	c
some	c
food	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
waiting	c
for	c
the	c
show	c
that	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
start	c
at	c
7.30	c
p.m.	c
But	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
8.15	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
upset	c
and	c
disappointed	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
were	c
me	c
,	c
how	c
would	c
you	c
feel	c
?	c

So	c
,	c
I	c
could	c
not	c
help	c
to	i
writing	c
to	c
you	c
and	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
take	i
money	c
back	c
.	c

I	c
enclosed	i
the	c
receipt	i
of	i
theatre	i

How	c
has	c
modern	c
technology	c
changed	c
your	c
daily	c
life	c
?	c

At	c
this	c
time	c
,	c
our	c
nation	c
was	c
under	i
a	c
developing	c
country	c
.	c

As	c
I	c
growed	i
up	c
,	c
T.V	c
was	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
mysteriest	i
things	c
like	c
a	c
telephone	c
and	c
a	c
bus	c
.	c

When	c
it	c
comes	c
to	c
modern	c
technology	c
,	c
I	c
grately	c
appreciate	c
it	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
university	c
student	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
find	c
out	c
some	c
imformation	i
about	i
my	c
homework	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
not	c
get	c
them	i
.	c

Second	c
thing	c
is	c
an	i
airplane	c
.	c

Now	c
I	c
am	c
in	c
England	c
.	c

I	i
know	i
a	i
ship	i
but	i
an	i
airplane	i
made	i
an	i
arrival	i
to	i
here	i
be	i
quick	i
.	i

All	c
in	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
having	c
many	c
benefits	c
from	c
modern	c
technology	c
which	i
is	c
very	c
useful	c
.	c

But	c
it	c
might	c
be	c
a	c
problem	c
,	c
making	c
me	c
lazy	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

I	c
was	c
in	c
London	c
for	c
a	c
week	c
's	c
holiday	c
and	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
.	c

I	c
saw	c
your	c
musical	c
show	c
advertised	c
in	c
my	c
hotel	c
and	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
buy	c
a	c
ticket	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
still	c
a	c
student	c
and	c
I	c
saw	c
in	c
the	c
advertisment	i
that	c
there	c
were	c
some	c
discounts	c
available	c
.	c

I	c
arrived	c
at	c
the	c
theatre	c
at	c
19.00	c
and	c
I	c
thought	c
I	c
'd	c
have	c
waited	c
only	c
thirty	c
minutes	c
.	c

When	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
started	c
I	c
had	c
the	c
third	c
bad	c
surprise	c
.	c

The	c
male	c
actor	c
was	c
n't	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
but	c
an	c
actor	c
that	c
I	c
've	c
never	c
seen	c
before	c
.	c

At	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
the	c
show	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
hungry	c
and	c
so	c
I	c
had	c
the	c
brilliant	c
to	i
decide	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
but	c
,	c
of	c
course	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
!	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
you	i
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c
.	c

I	c
'll	c
give	c
you	c
some	c
examples	c
describing	c
how	c
technology	c
affects	c
my	c
life	c
every	c
day	c
.	c

The	c
first	c
thing	c
I	c
do	c
every	c
day	c
,	c
when	c
I	c
get	c
up	c
,	c
is	c
to	c
prepare	c
fantastic	i
cappuccino	c
with	c
my	c
coffe	i
machine	c
.	c

Then	c
I	c
go	c
to	c
work	c
by	c
motorbike	c
.	c

During	i
all	i
the	i
day	c
I	c
speak	c
with	c
the	c
majority	c
of	c
my	c
collegues	i
by	c
telephone	c
or	c
e-mail	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
book	c
a	c
holiday	c
,	c
to	c
buy	c
a	c
book	c
or	c
to	c
control	i
my	c
bank	c
account	c
use	i
Internet	i
and	c
I	c
do	c
all	c
these	c
things	c
,	c
and	c
many	c
others	c
,	c
without	c
moving	c
from	c
my	c
office	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
finish	c
to	i
work	i
I	c
come	c
back	c
home	c
.	c

I	c
know	c
that	c
it	c
can	c
appear	c
a	c
sad	c
day	c
but	c
it	c
's	c
what	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
people	c
do	c
every	c
day	c
in	c
every	c
part	c
of	c
the	c
world	c
.	c

To	c
conclude	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
technology	c
has	c
improved	c
many	c
aspects	c
of	c
our	c
daily	c
life	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
concerning	c
the	c
London	c
trip	c
that	c
my	c
English	c
class	c
is	c
going	c
to	c
do	i
in	c
March	c
.	c

The	c
students	c
are	c
especially	c
very	i
happy	c
about	c
the	c
visit	c
to	c
the	c
Science	c
Museum	c
,	c
which	c
we	c
are	c
going	c
to	c
do	i
on	c
tuesday	i
morning	c
of	i
14th	c
March	c
.	c

The	c
point	c
of	c
my	c
letter	c
is	c
that	c
students	i
in	c
my	c
class	c
have	c
seen	c
an	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
and	c
they	c
would	c
appreciate	c
if	i
they	c
could	c
go	c
and	c
see	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

The	c
show	c
is	c
going	c
to	c
include	c
latest	i
fashions	c
,	c
leisure	c
and	c
sports	c
wear	c
,	c
make	i
up	i
and	c
hairstyles	c
and	c
best	c
of	c
all	c
it	c
is	c
free	c
for	c
students	c
to	c
get	c
in	c
.	c

The	c
only	c
problem	c
is	c
that	c
the	c
show	c
is	c
going	c
to	c
take	c
place	c
on	c
tuesday	i
of	i
14th	c
March	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
'm	c
wondering	c
if	c
you	c
can	c
make	c
some	c
changes	c
in	i
your	c
programme	c
.	c

My	c
class	c
think	c
that	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
for	c
them	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
because	c
tuesday	i
is	c
the	c
last	c
day	c
that	c
the	c
show	c
is	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
showed	i
.	c

The	c
home	c
of	c
the	c
Futere	i

The	i
technologi	i
is	c
changing	c
very	c
fast	c
and	c
at	c
the	c
same	c
moment	i
as	c
I	c
'm	c
writing	c
my	c
article	c
about	c
the	c
future	c
maybe	c
technologists	c
have	c
made	c
a	c
new	c
owen	i
which	c
co-operate	i
with	c
your	c
refrigerator	c
and	c
has	c
in	i
the	i
programme	i
to	c
make	c
dinner	c
for	c
you	c
every	c
day	c
without	c
that	i
you	c
have	i
to	c
do	c
anything	c
.	c

What	c
about	c
rooms	c
which	c
can	c
feel	i
your	c
mood	c
and	c
acting	i
after	i
that	c
,	i
if	i
you	c
are	c
tired	c
for	c
example	c
then	c
your	c
stereo	c
might	c
put	c
some	c
relaxing	c
musik	i
on	c
and	c
turn	c
down	c
the	c
light	c
a	c
little	c
bit	c
.	c

Next	i
step	c
might	c
be	c
a	c
robot	c
,	i
which	c
would	c
do	c
all	c
your	c
housework	c
,	c
but	c
what	c
would	c
happened	i
to	c
the	c
people	c
?	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
everyone	c
should	c
not	i
think	i
just	c
about	c
the	c
positive	c
sides	i
with	i
technologi	i
but	c
also	c
the	c
negative	c
.	c

The	i
technologi	i
is	c
good	c
as	c
long	c
as	c
it	c
gives	c
people	c
more	c
free	c
time	c
,	c
but	c
what	c
would	c
happened	i
if	c
freetime	i
became	c
your	c
life	c
?	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

To	c
make	c
matters	c
worse	c
,	c
not	c
only	c
was	c
the	c
restaurant	c
closed	c
,	c
without	i
any	i
appearant	i
reason	c
,	c
but	c
also	c
the	c
discounts	c
that	c
were	c
said	c
to	c
be	c
available	c
were	c
not	c
.	c

I	c
find	c
it	c
unbearable	c
to	c
witness	c
such	c
a	i
lying	i
advertising	c
and	c
to	c
pay	i
even	i
ten	c
pounds	c
to	c
spend	i
such	c
a	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
.	c

Consequently	c
,	c
I	c
ask	c
for	c
money	i
back	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
will	c
not	i
obviously	i
go	c
back	c
in	i
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
.	c

I	c
join	i
my	c
receipt	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

Bobby	c
did	c
n't	c
use	c
to	c
commit	c
such	c
acts	c
and	c
the	c
story	c
looked	i
very	c
strange	c
.	c

Pat	c
knew	c
there	c
was	c
no	c
solving	c
the	c
problem	c
without	c
the	c
adults	i
'	i
help	i
.	c

Katie	c
and	c
Bobby	c
would	c
be	c
furious	c
,	c
but	c
anyway	c
...	c

We	c
have	c
seen	c
an	c
advertisment	i
for	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
in	c
a	c
newspaper	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
mind	c
,	c
we	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
change	c
the	c
programme	c
a	c
little	c
bit	c
.	c

Instead	c
of	c
shopping	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
afternoon	c
we	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
this	c
show	c
,	c
which	c
will	c
continue	c
till	c
7	c
o'clock	c
in	c
the	c
evening	c
.	c

We	c
all	c
expect	c
the	c
trip	c
to	c
London	c
to	c
be	c
exiting	i
and	c
hope	c
to	c
get	i
unforgettable	c
memories	c

Best	c

The	c

Future	c

Our	c
life	c
is	c
changing	c
every	c
day	c
.	c

Will	c
we	c
all	c
live	c
in	c
countryside	i
in	c
house	i
surrounded	c
by	c
forest	c
full	c
of	c
animal	c
life	c
?	c

With	c
new	c
computer	c
technology	c
nothing	c
is	c
impossible	c
.	c

The	i
scintist	i
could	c
invent	i
the	c
4'th	i
dimention	i
and	c
we	i
'll	i
get	c
unlimited	c
space	c
inside	c
the	c
house	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
already	c
predictable	i
,	i
that	c
very	c
soon	c
all	c
house	i
appliances	c
will	c
be	c
voice	i
controlled	i
.	c

You	c
could	c
tell	c
your	c
wardrobe	c
what	c
clothes	c
you	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
wear	c
,	c
your	c
hob	c
will	c
cook	c
your	c
preferable	i
meals	c
and	c
your	c
refigerator	i
will	c
send	c
orders	c
to	c
the	c

to	c
buy	c
the	c
food	c

Nobody	c

I	c
am	c
writting	i
you	i
in	c
order	c
to	c
obtain	i
you	i
my	c
money	c
back	c
,	c
concerning	i
the	c
musical	c
show	c
:	c
OVER	c
THE	c
RAINBOW	c
.	c

I	c
decided	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
theatre	i
to	c
have	c
a	c
nice	c
evening	c
.	c

It	c
seemed	c
to	c
be	c
very	c
attractive	i
.	c

But	c
in	c
fact	c
it	c
is	c
not	c
!	c

Secondly	c
the	c
show	c
had	i
go	i
on	i
19.30	c
pm.	c
In	c
fact	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
20.15	c
pm	c
without	c
any	c
explanations	i
.	c

Thirdly	c
it	i
said	c
that	i
"	c
discounts	c
available	c
"	c
.	c

This	c
is	c
not	c
the	c
truth	c
.	c

And	c
you	c
write	i
,	c
I	c
quote	c
"	i
your	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
"	c
,	c
excuse	c
me	c
but	i
I	c
do	c
not	c
agree	c
with	c
you	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
awful	c
,	c
the	c
worst	c
evening	c
out	i
of	c
my	c
life	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
clothes	c
will	c
not	c
change	c
so	c
much	c
,	c
because	c
fashion	c
is	c
an	c
eternal	c
cycle	c
.	c

You	c
will	c
find	i
always	i
basic	i
clothes	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
the	c
materials	c
which	c
will	c
change	c
.	c

We	c
will	c
find	c
the	c
same	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
with	c
gadgets	c
included	c
.	c

fresh	c
air	c
,	c
why	c
not	c
?	c

Or	c
special	c
flying	c
shoes	c
,	c
and	c
maybe	c
on	i
your	i
watch	i
you	i
would	i
have	i
a	i
screen	i
to	c
watch	c
your	c
favorite	i
soap	c
operas	c
.	c

Do	c
not	c
worry	c
about	c
this	c
,	c
it	c
will	c
not	c
happen	c
!	c

Dear	c
Ms	c
Ryan	c
,	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
which	i
informed	c

won	c
the	c
first	c

two	c

U.S.A.	c
Here	c

day	c
but	c
please	c
let	c

I	c
think	c
the	c
log	c
cabin	c
is	c
more	c
fun	c
&	c
exciting	c
.	c

The	c
activities	c
that	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
do	c
are	c

and	c

Golf	c

forward	c
to	c

you	c

not	c
hesitate	c
to	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

We	c
always	c
need	c
fresh	c
food	c
such	c
as	c
vegetables	c
,	c
fruits	i
,	c
milk	c
and	i
etc.	c
At	i
least	i
most	c
people	c
will	c
do	c
their	c
shopping	c
twice	c
a	c
week	c
for	c
a	i
fresh	c
food	c
.	c

You	c
have	c
to	c
try	c
to	c
park	c
your	c
cark	i
first	c
which	i
sometime	i
the	c
space	i
are	c
fulled	i
and	c
after	c
you	c
have	c
parked	c
your	c
car	c
and	c
went	i
in	i
the	c
supermarket	c
the	c
product	c
you	c
wanted	c
have	i
run	c
out	c
so	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
changes	i
your	c
plan	c
for	c
dinner	c
or	c
going	i
to	c
another	c
supermarket	c
to	c
facing	i
a	c
long	c
queue	c
.	c

that	i
make	i
you	i
whole	i
day	i
for	i
shopping	i
which	c
was	c
not	c
fun	c
at	c
all	c
.	c

I	c
reciently	i
was	c
in	c
London	c
,	c
in	i
my	c
sister	c
's	c
home	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
se	i
"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
a	c
lots	i
of	c
problems	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
about	c
them	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
evening	c
I	c
got	c
a	c
flat	c
tire	c
,	c
and	c
because	c
of	c
this	c
I	c
got	c
late	i
to	i
the	i
show	i
,	c
when	c
I	c
got	c
to	c
my	c
place	i
,	c
it	c
was	c
used	i
(	c
it	c
cost	c
a	c
lot	c
)	c
and	c
they	c
took	c
me	c
to	c
the	c
cheapest	c
seats	c
,	c
where	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
see	c
a	c
thing	c
.	c

After	c
waiting	c
a	c
while	c
in	c
this	c
uncomfortable	c
place	i
the	c
show	c
started	c
,	i
I	c
waited	c
45	c
minutes	c
and	c
then	c
the	c
actors	c
appeared	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
find	i
myself	i
that	c
the	c
main	c
one	c
was	c
n't	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
an	c
impostor	c
.	c

And	c
finally	c
when	c
the	c
show	c
ended	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
go	c
eat	i
something	c
,	c
but	c
the	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
the	c
chef	c
was	c
sick	c
.	c

Sorry	c
,	c
but	c
all	i
these	i
stuff	i
are	i
not	i
proffesional	i
,	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
going	c
to	c
make	i
a	i
demand	i
exactly	i
because	i
you	i
do	i
n't	i
have	i
that	i
,	c
if	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
give	c
me	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
understand	c
me	c

But	c
there	c
was	c
a	c
little	c
problem	c
and	c
it	c
was	c
that	c
my	c
parent	i
's	i
did	c
n't	c
let	c
me	c
go	c
alone	i
to	i
disco	i
's	i
,	c
so	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
go	c
illegaly	i
,	c
and	c
I	c
decided	c
I	c
would	c
do	c
it	c
.	c

That	c
night	c
I	c
waited	c
until	c
my	c
parents	c
were	c
asleep	c
and	c
I	c
went	i
out	c
my	i
window	c
.	c

I	c
made	c
her	c
promise	c
she	c
would	c
n't	c
tell	c
anyone	c
my	c
secret	c
.	c

The	c
next	c
morning	c
Pat	c
came	c
to	c
my	c
house	c
,	i
I	c
was	c
sleeping	c
so	c
she	c
talked	c
to	c
my	c
mom	c
and	c
she	c
suddenly	c
asked	c
her	c
:	c
At	c
what	c
time	c
did	c
Catana	c
arrive	c
last	i
night	c
?	c
...	c

All	c
the	c
truth	c
was	c
then	c
told	c
,	c
and	c
now	c
I	c
am	c
grownded	i
for	c
life	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
terrible	c
evening	c
I	c
spent	c
in	c
your	c
theatre	c
.	c

Just	c
to	c
remind	c
you	c
of	c
which	c
show	c
I	c
am	c
talking	c
about	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
called	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
.	c

But	c
there	c
was	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
instead	c
of	c
him	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
disappointed	c
.	c

Another	c
problem	c
that	c
bothered	c
me	c
about	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
its	c
late	c
start	c
.	c

Instead	c
of	c
starting	c
at	c
19:30	c
pm	c
,	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
pm.	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
meeting	c
straight	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
but	c
I	c
was	c
late	c
and	c
made	c
fool	i
of	c
my	i
self	i
by	c
arriving	c
late	c
and	c
all	i
those	c
people	c
starring	i
at	c
me	c
and	c
whispering	c
.	c

Then	c
I	c
found	c
out	c
that	c
the	c
discounts	c
are	i
not	c
available	c
but	c
on	c
the	c
notice	c
board	c
,	i
it	c
said	c
that	c
they	c
are	i
available	c
.	c

After	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
I	c
noticed	c
that	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
that	c
day	c
.	c

The	c
evening	c
that	c
I	c
spent	c
there	c
was	c
terrible	c
so	c
please	c
may	c
I	c
have	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

Well	c
,	c
for	c
instance	c
people	c
in	c
Roman	c
times	c
(	c
Roman	c
soldiers	c
)	c
did	c
n't	c
have	c
any	c
sort	c
of	c
transport	c
to	c
move	c
them	c
from	c
one	c
place	c
to	c
another	c
.	c

They	c
could	c
walk	c
over	c
4	c
km	c
per	c
day	c
without	c
any	c
breaks	c
.	c

But	c
people	c
in	i
nowadays	c
like	c
me	c
ca	c
n't	c
even	c
walk	c
1	c
km.	c
And	c
also	c
what	c
is	c
the	c
point	c
of	c
walking	c
when	c
you	c
have	c
cars	c
and	c
buses	c
or	c
even	c
bikes	c
.	c

Phones	c
also	c
affected	c
my	c
daily	c
routine	c
.	c

When	c
e-mails	c
did	c
n't	c
exist	c
,	c
I	c
was	i
writing	i
letters	c
and	c
it	c
took	c
longer	c
to	c
get	c
to	c
the	c
person	c
I	c
am	i
writing	c
to	c
but	c
with	c
e-mails	c
,	i
the	c
person	c
could	c
receive	c
my	c
message	c
within	c
few	i
seconds	c
and	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
to	c
count	c
in	i
how	c
many	c
days	c
he	i
will	c
receive	c
it	c
.	c

So	c
in	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
modern	c
technology	c
changed	i
my	c
daily	c
routine	c
quiet	i
a	c
lot	c
.	c

Organiser	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
to	c
Camp	c
California	c
only	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
during	c
June	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
busy	c
with	c
my	c
tests	i
.	c

I	c
will	c
do	i
F.C.E	i
in	i
University	i
of	c
Cambridge	c
and	c
other	c
tests	i
in	c
several	c
subjects	c
in	i
my	c
high	c
school	c
.	c

But	i
the	i
way	i
,	c
I	c
do	c
not	c
like	c
to	c
stay	i
alone	c
.	c

My	c
father	c
was	c
a	c
great	c
singer	c
and	c
he	c
has	c
been	c
helping	c
me	c
.	c

Painting	c
is	c
my	i
challenge	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
very	c
hard	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
want	c
to	c
know	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
wear	c
there	c
and	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
will	c
spend	c
.	c

Women	c

I	c
am	c
a	c
woman	c
then	i
I	c
love	c
it	c
a	c

I	c
live	c
in	c

I	c
retired	c
four	c
years	c
ago	c
and	c
my	c
live	i
is	c
very	c
bored	i
.	c

I	c
bought	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
shoes	c
,	c
clothes	c
and	c
books	c
last	c
week	c
.	c

He	c
told	c
me	c
that	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
stupid	c
.	c

I	c
tried	c
to	c
buy	c
a	c
handsome	c
suit	c
for	c
him	c
but	c
he	c
shouted	c
and	c
abandoned	c
me	c
with	c
my	c
bags	c
.	c

I	c
took	c
a	c
cab	c
and	c
went	c
to	c
my	c
house	c
.	c

I	c
decided	c
to	c
stop	c
buying	c
those	c
things	c
that	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
really	c
need	c
.	c

I	c
know	c
in	i
deep	i
of	i
my	i
heart	i
sometimes	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	i
enjoyable	c
.	c

We	c
are	c
different	c
.	c

We	c
need	c
different	c
things	c
than	i
men	c
.	c

I	c
believe	c
him	c
because	c
he	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
man	c

At	c
last	c
I	c
am	c
really	c
a	c
great	c
woman	c
and	c
I	c
love	c
myself	c

Dear	c
Miss	c
Ryan	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
glad	c
to	c
hear	c
that	c
I	c
have	c

and	c
thank	c
you	c
very	c

Here	c
is	c
the	c
information	c
you	c
want	c

I	c
hope	c

are	i
useful	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
July	c
is	c
the	c
only	c
month	c
I	c
can	c
travel	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
got	c
exams	c
at	c

and	c
I	c
wo	c
n't	c
finish	c
them	c
until	c
the	c
last	c

of	c

So	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
on	i
July	c
.	c

Since	c
I	c
have	c
n't	c
been	c
camping	c
in	c
tents	c
so	i
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
take	c
this	c
chance	c
to	c
feel	c
and	c
experience	c
what	c
will	i
it	i
be	i
.	c

About	c
the	c
activities	c
,	c
I	c
chose	c
swimming	c
and	c
climbing	c

I	c
am	c
in	c
swimming	i
term	i
a	i
school	c
and	c
I	c
won	c
a	c
prize	c
last	c
month	c

And	c
I	c
was	c
wondering	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
do	i
I	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
?	i

Also	c
,	c
if	c
I	c

Dear	c

It	c
was	c
lovely	c
to	c
hear	c
that	c
you	c
want	c
to	c
hear	c
about	c
my	c
experience	c

I	c
helped	c
the	i
concert	c
which	i
was	c
my	c
favour	i
singer	c
's	c
concert	c
.	c

I	c
helped	c
with	c
the	c
piano	c
part	c
in	c
that	c
concert	c
.	c

At	c
the	c
concert	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
play	c
4	c
songs	c
and	c
I	c
had	c
never	c
played	c
in	c
a	c
concert	c
before	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
felt	c
very	c
nervous	c
before	c
the	c
concert	c

And	c
also	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
played	c
the	c
piano	c
with	c
the	i
singers	c
before	c
,	c
and	c
after	i
that	c
it	i
makes	c
me	c
more	c
confident	c
and	c
improved	i
my	c
skills	c
a	c

that	c

we	c
found	c
very	i

45	c
minutes	c
before	c
the	c
show	c
goes	i

and	c
we	c
can	c
also	c
add	c
that	c
your	c

was	c

of	c
hygienic	i
troubles	i

Yours	c

Application	c
for	c
the	c
shopping	c
trip	c
to	c
New	c
York	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
we	c
should	c
consider	c
the	c
manner	i
actually	i
how	i
the	i
people	i
are	i
dressing	i
to	c
see	c
how	c
it	c
's	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
developped	i
into	i
the	c
future	c
.	c

Everyone	c
has	c
is	i
own	c
style	c
but	c
it	c
's	c
obvious	c
that	c
many	c
of	c
us	c
is	i
wearing	c
the	c
same	c
clothes	c
like	i
others	c
.	c

These	c
new	c
clothes	c
are	c
often	c
very	c
expensive	c
that	i
's	i
maybe	c
not	c
everyone	c
can	c
afford	c
to	c
buy	c
himself	c
the	c
newest	c
clothes	c
on	c
the	c
market	c
.	c

In	c
100	c
years	c
,	c
it	c
's	c
possible	c
that	c
each	i
people	i
will	c
developp	i
his	c
own	c
style	c
using	c
all	c
the	c
new	c
materials	c
like	c
plastic	c
,	c
latex	c
everything	i
possible	c
,	c
in	i
a	c
way	c
to	c
create	c
own	i
clothes	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
people	c
will	c
wear	i
no	i
clothes	c
anymore	c
,	c
just	c
being	i
natural	c
,	c
nude	i
and	c
feeling	c
free	c
,	c
like	c
many	c
many	c
years	c
before	c
.	c

Because	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
people	c
need	c
to	c
find	c
again	i
their	i
authenticity	i
.	c

With	c
Best	c
regards	c

Dear	c
Jane	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
some	c
advice	c
about	c
the	c
International	c
Arts	c
festival	i
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
idea	c
to	c
organise	c
this	c
sort	c
of	c
festival	c
because	c
most	c
of	i
people	c
enjoy	c
it	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
concerning	c
stars	i
and	c
artists	c
,	c
they	c
came	c
from	c
only	c
six	c
countries	c
.	c

Because	c
some	c
concert	c
halls	c
were	c
too	c
small	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
have	c
any	c
ideas	c
about	c
bigger	i
halls	c
,	c
it	c
will	i
be	i
better	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
about	c
plays	i
and	c
films	c
it	i
will	i
be	i
good	c
if	c
you	c
make	i
more	c
because	c
the	c
children	c
like	c
it	i
.	c

I	c
hope	c
to	i
give	i
you	c
enough	c
information	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	i
,	c

After	c
that	c
,	c
it	i
maked	i
a	i
long	i
time	i
that	i
he	i
drove	i
,	c
so	i
we	c
decided	c
to	c
stop	c
to	i
an	i
area	i
.	c

We	c
were	i
going	i
to	c
the	c
toilet	c
and	c
ate	c
something	c
to	i
the	c
snack	c
bar	c
.	c

Suddenly	c
,	c
my	c
father	c
realised	c
he	c
forgot	i
to	c
close	i
the	c
car	c
.	c

He	c
ran	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
too	c
late	c
,	c
somebody	c
had	c
stolen	c
the	c
luggages	i
.	c

We	c
called	c
the	c
police	c
but	c
they	c
said	c
us	i
if	i
you	i
did	c
n't	c
close	i
your	i
car	c
we	i
did	i
n't	i
make	i
something	i
.	c

It	c
was	c
the	i
worse	i
holiday	c
in	c
my	c
life	c
but	c
we	c
continued	c
.	c

We	c
went	c
to	c
an	i
hotel	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
expensive	c
and	c
uncomfortable	c
.	c

on	i
last	c
week	c
.	c

I	c
could	i
compare	i
between	i
the	c
advertising	c
of	c
musical	i
and	c
actual	i
musical	c
show	c
last	c
week	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
after	c
show	i
,	c
it	i
is	i
because	i
I	i
saw	i
it	i
was	i
opened	i
at	i
break	i
time	i
for	i
musical	i
,	i
but	i
afterwards	i
,	i
the	i
people	i
of	i
staff	i
for	i
restaurant	i
were	i
closing	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c

popular	c
thing	c
all	i
of	i
the	i
world	c
.	c

from	i
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
been	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
that	c
show	c
since	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
was	c
to	c
be	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
main	c
actors	c
;	c
however	c
,	c
there	c
was	c
other	i
actor	c
instead	c
of	c
him	c
,	c
which	c
came	i
to	i
me	i
as	i
a	i
great	i
disappointment	i
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
as	c
for	c
the	c
times	c
,	i
instead	c
of	c
19.30	c
it	c
all	i
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
,	c
which	c
involved	i
being	c
stranded	c
in	i
the	c
theatre	c
for	c
such	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
.	c

Nevertheless	i
,	c
there	c
was	c
not	c
any	c
available	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
as	c
regards	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
due	c
to	c
problems	c
with	c
the	c
pipes	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
may	c
realize	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
a	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
but	c
a	c
complete	c
disaster	c
.	c

To	c
make	c
matters	c
worse	c
,	c
people	c
gossiped	c
about	c
me	c
and	c
tried	c
to	c
find	c
out	c
more	c
and	c
more	c
about	c
my	c
private	c
affairs	c
,	c
which	c
made	c
me	c
feel	c
embarrassed	c
.	c

The	c
worst	c
point	i
was	c
that	c
she	c
started	c
to	c
make	c
up	c
false	c
stories	c
about	c
me	c
,	c
which	c
soon	c
spread	c
all	c
around	c
the	c
neighbourhood	c
.	c

Needless	c
to	c
say	c
,	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
put	c
up	c
with	c
that	c
situation	c
any	c
longer	c
so	c
I	c
determined	i
to	c
fall	c
out	c
with	c
her	c
.	c

Of	i
course	i
,	c
I	c
became	c
aware	c
of	c
her	c
feelings	c
since	c
a	c
friend	c
of	c
mine	c
overheard	c
a	c
conversation	c
between	c
Pat	c
and	c
other	i
girl	c
.	c

In	c
spite	c
of	c
that	c
,	c
I	c
found	c
it	c
difficult	c
to	c
forgive	c
her	c
as	c
she	c
had	c
hurt	c
my	c
feelings	c
;	c
that	c
's	c
why	c
the	c
only	c
thing	c
I	c
could	c
tell	c
her	c
since	i
we	c
had	c
quarrelled	c
was	c
:	c
"	c
It	c
serves	c
you	c
right	c
,	c
I	c
'll	c
hate	c
you	c
for	c
the	c
rest	c
of	c
your	c
life	c
!	c
"	c

I	c
love	c
sports	c
so	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
play	c
some	c
basketball	c
at	c
the	c
camp	c
,	i
by	i
the	c
way	c
my	i
team	c
and	c
I	c
won	c
the	c
last	c
scholl	i
championship	c
,	i
I	c
play	c
guard	c
on	c
my	c
team	c
,	i
I	c
also	c
like	c
tennis	c
but	c
I	c
am	c
not	c
very	c
good	c
,	i
I	c
was	c
wondering	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
give	c
me	c
some	c
lesson	i
while	c
I	c
am	c
there	c
.	c

Hoping	c
to	c
hear	c
soon	i
from	i
you	i
.	c

Nowadays	c
in	i
the	c
year	c
2000	c
we	c
still	c
practice	i
this	c
ancient	c
art	c
but	c
in	c
a	c
diferent	i
way	c
,	c
we	c
do	c
n't	c
use	c
weapons	c
for	c
hunting	c
animal	i
in	c
the	c
jungle	c
,	c
we	c
use	c
the	c
remote	c
to	c
hunt	c
TV	c
shows	c
,	c
and	c
we	c
do	c
not	c
collect	c
vegetables	c
any	c
more	c
we	i
go	c
shopping	c
.	c

This	c
activity	c
of	c
shopping	c
has	c
become	c
one	c
of	c
our	c
most	c
important	c
,	c
after	c
all	c
,	c
we	c
go	c
shopping	c
for	c
any	c
reason	c
,	c
we	c
have	c
develop	i
such	c
an	c
instinc	i
for	c
shopping	c
that	c
we	c
can	c
proudly	c
say	c
,	i
that	c
we	c
are	c
some	c
sort	c
of	c
kings	c
in	i
the	c
urban	c
jungle	c
.	c

But	c
where	c
is	c
the	c
bad	c
poet	i
of	c
it	c
,	i
well	i
shopping	c
can	c
became	c
horrible	c
in	i
christmast	i
for	c
example	c
when	i
houndred	i
of	c
people	c
goes	i
to	c
the	c
shopping	c
center	i
and	c
it	c
also	c
can	c
take	i
many	c
problems	c
when	c
you	c
become	c
an	c
impulsive	c
buyer	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
only	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
going	c
to	c
work	c
in	c
Aougust	i
to	c
earn	c
money	c
and	c
after	c
(	i
from	c
September	c
to	c
June	c
)	c
I	c
go	c
to	c
university	c
as	c
usual	c
.	c

About	c
accomodation	i
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
rather	c
be	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
than	c
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
because	c
in	c
July	c
the	c
weather	c
is	c
really	c
good	c
and	c
when	c
I	c
am	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
I	c
feel	c
closer	c
of	i
nature	c
.	c

Although	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
climb	i
(	c
so	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
complete	c
beginner	c
)	c
.	i

But	i
I	c
sailed	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
ago	c
so	c
I	c
am	c
quite	c
a	c
beginner	c
too	i
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

The	c
most	c
exciting	c
thing	c
when	c
you	c
help	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
is	c
that	c
you	c
can	c
meet	c
popstars	c
,	c
and	c
,	c
indeed	c
,	c
I	c
met	c
OUR	c
favourite	c
popstar	c
!	c

I	c
will	c
never	c
forget	c
this	i
moment	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
I	c
worked	c
very	c
hard	c
because	c
the	c
concert	c
finished	c
very	c
late	c
and	c
after	c
the	c
concert	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
clean	c
up	c
the	c
room	i
and	c
you	c
ca	c
n't	c
imagine	c
how	c
dirty	c
the	c
fans	c
are	c
!	c

When	c
I	c
receive	i
the	c
photos	c
I	c
took	c
,	c
I	c
will	c
write	c
you	i
again	c
to	c
give	c
them	c
to	c
you	c
.	c

Looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c

That	c
show	c
was	c
n't	c
as	i
it	c
supposed	i
to	c
be	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
for	c
that	c
reason	c
that	c
I	c
am	c
writting	i
to	c
you	c
.	c

One	c
of	c
the	c
problems	c
is	i
that	c
a	c
couple	c
of	c
actors	c
,	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
,	c
were	c
the	c
ones	c
supposed	c
to	c
act	c
and	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
took	c
Danny	c
's	c
place	c
,	i
it	i
was	c
disappointing	c
!	c

The	c
second	c
show	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
start	c
at	c
19:30	c
,	c
but	c
to	i
make	i
the	i
matters	i
worse	i
,	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
20.15	c
,	c
so	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
got	i
to	c
the	c
cinema	c
.	c

Apart	i
from	i
that	i
I	c
could	c
n't	c
visit	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
for	c
holidays	i
.	c

On	c
top	c
of	c
everything	c
the	c
tickets	i
did	c
n't	c
offer	c
any	c
discounts	c
,	c
so	c
the	i
last	c
day	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
buy	c
the	i
present	c
for	c
my	c
neighbour	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writting	i
to	c
ask	c
a	i
refund	c
of	c
the	c
£	c
55	c
which	c
I	c
spent	c
on	c
the	c
ticket	c
for	c
the	i
miserable	c
show	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
I	i
think	c
that	c
technology	c
has	c
been	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
inventions	c
of	i
human	c
and	i
that	c
without	c
it	c
we	c
could	c
n't	c
be	c
where	c
we	c
are	c
wright	i
now	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
people	c
who	c
has	i
n't	i
any	c
cars	c
,	i
can	c
also	c
be	c
helped	c
by	c
technology	c
:	c
they	c
can	c
use	c
the	c
public	c
transport	c
like	c
the	c
train	c
or	c
the	c
bus	c
,	c
which	c
is	i
also	c
a	i
comfortable	c
form	i
of	c
travelling	c
.	c

In	c
contrast	c
,	c
technology	c
is	c
very	c
bad	c
for	c
the	c
nature	i
:	c
if	c
we	c
use	c
cars	c
we	c
contaminate	c
,	i
and	c
many	c
cars	c
are	c
being	c
used	c
every	c
day	c
!	c

I	c
feel	c
very	c
happy	c
to	c
be	c
the	c
winner	c
of	c
your	c
competition	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
only	c
because	i
they	c
will	c
need	c
me	c
at	c
work	c
in	c
August	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
sleep	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
done	c
it	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
an	c
experience	c
not	c
to	c
be	c
missed	c
,	c
a	c
very	c
original	c
adventure	c
!	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
do	c
singing	c
and	c
swimming	c
.	c

For	i
the	c
first	c
activity	c
,	c
I	c
must	c
tell	c
you	c
that	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
keen	c
on	c
singing	c
but	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
very	c
few	i
experience	c
in	c
it	c
.	c

What	c
is	c
the	c
weather	c
like	c
in	c
July	c
?	c

Is	c
it	c
worth	c
to	i
take	i
a	c
raincoat	c
?	c

Should	c
I	c
take	c
trainers	c
?	c

Finally	c
,	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
must	c
I	c
bring	c
with	c
me	c
?	c

Is	c
it	c
necessary	c
to	c
ask	c
for	c
Travellers	c
'	c
Cheques	c
?	c

Especially	c
If	c
you	c
go	c
shopping	c
on	c
a	c
Saturday	c
,	c
when	c
people	c
are	c
on	i
week-end	i
.	c

You	c
are	c
embarrassed	i
with	i
the	c
people	c
who	c
are	c
so	c
close	c
to	c
you	c
that	c
you	c
ca	c
n't	c
walk	c
as	c
fast	c
as	c
you	c
want	c
.	c

Or	c
if	c
you	c
look	c
for	c
a	c
present	c
and	c
you	c
ca	c
n't	c
find	c
it	c
.	c

You	c
can	c
discover	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
things	c
if	c
you	c
are	c
abroad	c
and	c
learn	c
a	c
lot	c
about	c
the	c
life	c
of	c
local	c
people	c
.	c

It	c
can	c
be	c
funny	i
!	c

Finally	c
,	c
shopping	c
can	c
help	c
you	c
to	c
feel	c
happy	c
if	c
you	c
are	c
down	c
in	c
the	c
dumps	c
,	c
if	c
you	c
feel	c
horrible	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
the	c
actors	i
who	c
starring	i
was	c
not	c
Dany	c
Brook	c
as	c
it	i
was	i
advertised	c
but	c
one	i
other	i
actor	c
,	c
whose	c
performance	c
was	c
very	c
bad	c
.	c

despite	i
these	i
fact	c
the	c
show	c
began	c
at	c
a	c
quarter	c
to	c
eight	c
.	c

Also	c
,	c
there	c
was	i
not	i
available	i
tickets	i
and	i
after	c
these	i
bad	c
musical	c
show	c
the	i
restaurant	c
of	c
the	c
theatre	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

As	c
a	c
result	c
of	c
that	i
I	c
demand	c
to	i
have	i
some	c
of	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

If	c
I	c
say	i
that	c
technology	c
has	c
not	c
changed	c
my	c
life	c
I	c
would	c
be	c
lying	c
.	c

Technology	c
so	i
much	c
my	i
life	c
which	i
I	c
could	c
not	c
live	c
without	c
it	c
.	c

But	c
technology	c
does	c
n't	c
only	c
makes	i
my	c
life	c
better	c
.	c

By	c
the	i
use	i
of	i
car	i
I	c
do	i
not	c
only	c
get	c
an	c
easy	c
way	c
to	c
move	c
,	i
but	c
I	c
destroy	i
my	i
enviroment	i
.	c

Also	c
,	c
if	c
I	c
use	c
the	c
car	c
,	i
in	i
small	c
distances	c
when	c
I	c
can	i
go	c
on	c
foot	c
,	c
I	c
destroy	i
my	c
physical	i
situation	i
.	c

Could	i
you	c
imagine	c
your	c
life	c
without	c
a	c
television	c
or	c

THE	c
CIRCLE	c
THEATRE	c

LONDON	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
you	i
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
which	c
took	c
place	c
the	i
last	c
1st	c
of	c
May	c
in	i
"	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
"	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

Your	c
show	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
be	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
best	c
that	c
I	c
had	c
ever	c
seen	c
.	c

The	c
prices	c
that	c
our	c
travel	c
agency	c
confirmed	c
us	i
were	c
not	c
the	c
same	c
as	c
the	c
theatre	i
,	i
we	i
asked	c
for	c
our	c
special	c
discount	c
for	c
be	i
students	c
with	i
less	c
than	c
eighteen	c
years	c
but	c
we	c
only	c
obtained	c
a	c
rudely	i
answer	c
of	i
the	c
woman	c
who	c
sold	c
the	c
tickets	c
.	c

You	c
can	c
imagine	c
how	c
upset	c
we	c
were	c
and	c
we	c
asked	i
you	c
for	c
our	i
reward	i
for	c
the	c
night	c
that	c
we	c
spent	c
.	i

For	i
instances	i
with	c
the	c
arrive	i
of	c
Internet	i
,	c
the	c
new	c
digital	c
television	c
or	i
the	c
researchers	c
in	c
the	i
medecin	i
;	i
we	c
are	c
discovering	c
how	c
we	c
can	c
change	c
our	c
lives	c
only	i
with	i
press	i
a	i
botton	i
,	c
or	c
look	c
for	c
something	c
new	c
with	i
only	c
think	i
about	c
it	c
...	c
we	c
realize	c
that	c
the	c
new	c
technology	c
it	i
have	i
just	c
begun	c
,	i
and	c
lively	i
in	c
a	c
few	c
years	c
we	c
will	c
be	c
very	c
avanced	i
in	c
this	c
way	c
.	c

Although	c
the	i
technology	c
also	i
is	i
used	c
for	i
create	i
new	c
types	c
of	c
weapons	i
and	c
also	c
for	i
killing	i
people	c
,	c
it	i
is	c
only	c
the	c
worst	c
part	c
of	c
this	i
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
to	i
start	c
at	c
19:30	c
a	i
I	c
bought	c
my	c
ticket	c
for	c
the	c
evening	c
session	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
have	c
understood	c
a	c
little	c
bit	c
of	c
waiting	c
time	c
,	c
but	c
everybody	c
agreed	c
that	c
this	c
was	c
too	c
long	c
.	c

Second	c
,	c
instead	c
of	c
being	i
starred	i
by	i
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
the	c
musical	c
was	c
starred	i
by	i
another	c
actor	c
,	c
who	c
I	c
found	c
really	c
disappointing	c
.	c

Although	c
he	c
sung	c
quite	c
well	c
he	c
danced	c
terribly	c
and	c
that	c
spoiled	c
part	c
of	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

I	c
asked	c
for	i
the	c
discounts	c
available	c
as	c
we	c
were	c
a	c
group	c
of	c
15	c
people	c
,	c
but	c
the	c
answer	c
I	c
was	c
given	c
was	c
that	c
nobody	c
had	c
ever	c
heard	c
of	c
them	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
,	c
we	c
had	c
planned	c
to	c
have	c
dinner	c
at	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
as	c
it	c
closes	c
every	c
Thursday	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
just	c
want	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
the	c
perfect	c
evening	c
that	c
the	c
advertisement	c
said	i
and	c
that	c
we	c
all	c
wished	i
turned	c
out	c
to	c
be	c
a	i
regret	i
for	i
the	c
wasted	c
money	c
.	c

That	c
's	c
why	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
give	c
me	c
some	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
receiving	c
your	c
decision	c
.	c

Yours	c
Faithfully	c
,	c

I	c
live	c
more	c
comfortably	c
and	c
even	i
more	c
carefree	c
than	c
some	i
years	c
ago	c
.	c

Nowadays	c
,	c
almost	c
everybody	c
have	i
a	c
microwaves	i
oven	c
,	c
where	c
you	c
put	c
your	c
milk	c
less	i
than	c
two	c
minuts	i
and	c
it	c
is	c
ready	c
to	c
delight	c
your	c
mouth	c
.	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
the	c
letter	c
you	c
wrote	c
to	c
me	c
to	c
inform	c
me	c
about	c
the	c
prize	c
I	c
won	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
so	c
happy	c
!	c

As	c
you	c
offer	c
many	c
activities	c
it	c
was	c
hard	c
to	c
choose	c
which	c
ones	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
do	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
dicided	i
to	c
take	c
swimming	c
and	c
photography	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
swimming	c
and	c
because	c
currently	i
I	i
am	i
attending	c
a	c
photography	c
course	c
in	c
Vienna	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
not	c
very	c
experienced	c
but	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
I	c
will	c
find	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
beautiful	c
motives	i
in	c
the	c
USA	c
.	c

I	i
would	c
be	c
very	c
kind	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
inform	c
me	c
about	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
with	c
me	c
and	c
which	i
clothes	c
I	c
will	c
need	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	i

There	c
always	i
was	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
security	c
stuff	c
around	c
us	c
to	c
make	c
sure	c
every	i
thing	i
is	i
ok	i
,	c
because	c
there	c
really	c
were	c
thousends	i
of	c
persons	i
.	c

The	c
other	c
thing	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
was	c
to	c
make	c
some	c
sandwiches	c
and	c
drinks	c
just	c
before	c
they	c
returned	c
behind	i
the	i
stage	i
to	c
rest	c
a	c
little	c
bit	c
before	c
they	c
continued	c
playing	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
amazing	c
to	c
be	c
in	c
the	c
same	c
room	c
they	c
were	c
.	i

Hope	c
to	c
see	c
you	c
soon	c
!	c

Dear	c
Ms	c
Ryan	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
reply	c
to	c
your	c
questions	c
about	c
Camp	c
California	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
very	c
pleased	c
and	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
States	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c
,	c
however	c
I	c
'm	c
free	c
only	c
in	c
July	c
.	c

After	c
that	c
I	c
will	c
go	c
back	c
to	c
Japan	c
and	c
continue	c
studying	c
at	c
College	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
stats	i
at	c
the	c
beginning	c
of	c
August	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
not	c
a	i
kind	c
of	c
person	c
who	c
can	c
easily	c
fall	c
a	i
sleep	i
and	c
it	c
gets	c
worse	c
when	c
I	c
am	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
.	c

At	c
the	c
Camp	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
do	c
climbing	c
and	c
golf	c
.	c

I	c
belonged	c
to	c
a	c
climbing	c
club	c
at	c
my	c
highschool	i
and	c
I	c
've	c
got	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
knowledge	c
from	c
my	c
experienced	c
teacher	c
.	c

I	c
often	c
climbed	c
mountains	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
in	c
high	c
school	c
.	c

That	c
is	c
how	c
many	c
and	c
what	c
sort	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
need	c
and	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
should	c
bring	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

Most	c
of	c
us	c
(	c
students	c
)	c
came	c
to	c
our	c
school	c
because	c
they	c
wanted	c
to	c
study	c
English	c
,	c
so	c
it	c
should	c
be	c
the	c
important	c
part	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
if	i
we	c
film	c
the	c
class	c
,	c
people	c
can	c
see	c
how	c
interesting	c
or	c
funny	c
the	c
lesson	c
is	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
we	c
should	c
film	c
it	c
at	c
the	c
very	c
crowded	c
moment	c
so	c
that	c
people	c
can	c
see	c
we	c
have	c
to	c
wait	c
patiently	c
before	c
we	c
reach	c
our	c
foods	i
.	c

For	c
the	c
very	c
last	c
part	c
why	i
not	c
filming	i
our	c
faces	c
when	c
all	c
the	c
lessons	c
are	c
finished	c
?	c

I	c
recently	c
had	c
a	c
week	c
's	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

During	c
my	c
stay	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
your	c
theatre	c
to	c
see	c
a	c
musical	c
show	c
which	i
was	c
OVER	c
THE	c
RAINBOW	c
,	i
however	i
,	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
very	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
.	c

There	c
are	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
differences	c
between	c
the	c
details	c
of	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
on	i
the	c
advertisement	c
and	c
the	i
ones	i
it	i
actually	i
was	i
.	c

Thirdly	c
it	c
said	c
there	c
were	c
discounts	c
available	c
on	i
the	c
advertisement	c
,	i
however	i
,	c
there	c
was	i
not	c
any	c
at	c
all	c
.	c

Finally	c
it	c
said	c
we	c
could	c
visit	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
colsed	i
because	c
your	i
excuse	i
of	i
being	i
used	i
at	i
that	i
moment	i
.	c

I	c
felt	c
very	c
disappointing	i
after	c
seeing	c
the	c
music	c
show	c
in	c
your	c
theatre	c
.	c

As	i
I	i
said	i
the	i
reasons	i
above	i
,	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
ask	c
for	c
money	i
back	c
!	c

I	c
look	c
forwards	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

He	c
was	c
so	c
kind	c
that	c
the	i
could	c
n't	c
stop	i
telling	c
Janet	c
that	c
she	c
was	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
killed	c
by	c
Mr	c
Brown	c
After	i
finishing	i
that	c
Pat	i
left	c
this	i
room	c
.	c

She	c
went	c
quietly	i
downstair	i
and	c
closed	c
the	c
door	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
she	c
went	c
into	c
her	c
room	c
.	c

At	c
that	c
moment	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
things	c
appeared	c
in	c
her	c
mind	c
which	i
seemed	c
as	i
just	i
happened	i
yesterday	c
.	c

She	i
said	c
to	c
herself	c
"	i
I	c
am	c
just	c
a	c
servant	c
in	c
this	c
castle	c
,	i
I	c
loves	i
him	c
so	c
much	c
and	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
want	c
anything	c
from	c
him	c
although	c
he	c
is	c
the	c
owner	c
of	c
this	c
castle.	c
"	c

while	i
it	i
seemed	c
as	c
a	i
shadow	c
came	c
in	c
from	i
the	c
window	c
and	c
disappeared	c
quickly	c
.	c

Everything	c
in	c
the	c
room	c
is	i
quiet	c
except	c
the	c
sound	c
of	c
the	c
clock	c
as	i
if	c
everything	c
is	i
going	c
to	c
die	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
Writing	c
this	c
letter	c
to	c
say	i
my	c
dissatisfaction	c
of	i
your	c
entertament	i
.	c

I	c
was	c
really	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
seeing	c
it	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
like	c
musical	i
and	c
also	c
I	c
like	c

nothing	c

If	c

My	c

Nowadays	c

convinience	i
on	i

there	c
lots	i

I	c

my	c
own	c

in	c

I	c
enjoy	c

Sometimes	c
it	c
waste	i

If	c

I	c
can	c

I	c
think	c
I	c

And	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
reason	c
is	c
because	c
I	i

And	c
about	c
the	c

I	c

Beverley	i
Center	i
area	c
is	c
the	c
place	c
that	c
the	c
teenager	i
like	c
to	c
go	c
shopping	c
the	i
most	c
.	c

But	c
some	c
teenager	i
like	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
Bolton-Market	i
.	c

Because	c
every	i
one	i
have	i
different	i
thinking	i
like	i
beverley	i
center	i
if	c
you	c
there	i
every	c
day	c
or	c
every	c
week	c
for	c
a	i
shopping	c
you	c
well	i
get	c
very	c
boring	i
because	c
some	i
time	i
is	i
to	i
much	i
people	c
every	i
where	i
like	i
in	c
the	c
resturant	i
and	c
shops	c
.	c

It	i
's	i
make	i
you	c
feel	c
want	i
to	c
go	c
home	c
.	c

Because	c
all	c
the	c
smell	i
in	c
the	c
market	c
is	i
alfrell	i
is	i
the	c
smell	c
of	c
the	c
meat	c
and	c
durty	i
water	c
black	i
and	c
smely	i
water	c
all	i
over	c
the	c
market	i
street	i
.	c

I	i
think	i
of	i
it	i
it	i
's	i
make	i
my	i
shopping	i
enjoyable	i
.	c

And	c
that	c
's	c
why	c
some	i
time	i
shopping	c
is	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

Also	c
,	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
mention	c
that	c
all	c
the	c
class	c
will	c
come	c
,	c
all	c
the	c
teachers	c
will	c
be	c
there	c
,	c
and	c
the	c
Principal	c
will	c
come	c
too	c
.	c

I	c
dont	i
know	c
why	c
but	c
the	c
summer	c
it	i
is	c
the	c
most	c
beautiful	c
season	c
.	c

All	c
the	c
scenery	c
with	c
the	c
lovely	c
sun	c
,	c
the	c
wonderful	c
beaches	c
,	c
the	c
green	c
mountains	c
and	c
the	c
smell	c
of	c
the	c
sea	c
,	c
make	c
me	c
feel	c
great	c
.	c

I	c
live	c
in	c
Greece	c
,	c
and	c
especially	i
in	i
an	c
island	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
know	c
very	c
well	c
what	c
summer	c
means	c
.	c

Also	c
it	c
means	c
to	i
meet	i
other	c
people	c
,	c
to	i
have	i
fun	c
together	c
,	c
to	i
travel	i
at	i
all	c
the	c
places	c
of	i
the	c
island	c
.	c

I	c
believe	c
that	c
the	c
summer	c
is	c
a	c
season	c
for	c
everybody	c
who	c
wants	c
to	c
have	c
wonderful	i
time	c
and	c
wonderful	c
memories	c
wherever	c
the	i
go	c

Immediantely	i

I	c
would	c

that	c
it	c
could	i
be	i
definetely	i
a	c
great	c

"	c
It	c
was	c
dangerous	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
knew	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
"	i
Peter	c
whispered	c
smiling	i
at	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
hear	c
a	i
owl	c
hooting	c
in	c
the	c
tree	c
nearby	c
.	c

As	c
a	c
postman	c
,	c
Peter	c
,	i
had	c
to	c
deliver	c
letters	c
aroud	i
our	c
little	c
village	c
.	c

He	c
knew	c
everybody	c
,	c
especially	i
Mrs	c
Rilke	c
,	c
an	c
elderly	c
,	c
eagle-eyed	c
teacher	i
in	i
retirement	i
,	c
who	c
lived	c
in	c
a	i
old	c
cottage	c
with	c
her	c
five	c
bad-tempered	c
dogs	c
.	c

She	c
has	i
never	c
received	c
any	c
letter	i
,	c
since	i
that	c
morning	c
.	c

Suddenly	c
I	c
made	c
up	c
my	c
mind	c
,	c
and	c
running	c
as	c
fast	c
as	c
a	c
champion	c
horse	c
I	c
reached	c
her	c
hands	c
and	c
left	c
the	c
letter	c
,	c
then	c
I	c
went	c
away	c
quickly	c
and	c
,	c
fortunately	c
,	c
just	i
in	c
time	c
to	c
close	c
the	c
gate	c
between	c
me	c
and	c
the	c
dogs	c
!	c

To	c
the	c
manager	c
,	c

Unfortunatly	i
I	c
never	c
thought	c
it	c
could	c
be	c
so	c
dissapointing	i
.	c

According	i
to	i
that	c
,	c
I	c
thought	c
I	c
'd	c
have	c
a	c
wonderful	c
night	c
.	c

The	c
first	c
problem	c
happened	c
at	c
the	c
box	c
office	c
because	c
there	c
were	c
abosolutly	i
no	c
discounts	c
available	c
.	c

Well	c
,	c
I	c
bought	c
a	c
the	i
ticket	c
anyway	c
.	c

The	c
show	c
supposed	i
to	c
start	c
at	c
19:30	c
but	c
it	c
actually	c
started	c
forty	i
five	i
minutes	c
after	i
it	i
.	c

When	c
the	c
show	c
began	c
had	i
my	c
biggest	c
disappoint	i
,	c
instead	c
of	c
the	c
great	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
there	c
were	i
another	c
actor	c
,	c
totally	c
unknown	c
.	c

I	i
'd	i
like	i
so	i
,	i
to	c
reiceve	i
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

Techology	i
is	c
always	c
getting	c
better	c
.	c

And	c
it	c
is	c
responsable	i
for	c
many	c
changes	c
in	c
my	c
life	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
I	c
would	c
n't	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
live	c
without	c
it	c
anymore	c
.	c

Nowaday	i
,	c
with	c
Internet	i
it	c
had	i
became	i
easier	c
to	c
do	c
the	i
school	c
works	i
and	c
I	c
also	c
like	c
to	c
chat	c
with	c
other	c
people	c
or	c
maybe	c
read	c
the	c
latest	c
news	c
about	c
my	c
favorite	i
football	c
team	c
.	c

But	c
for	c
me	c
,	c
the	c
best	c
thing	c
is	c
definatly	i
the	c
microwaver	i
.	c

And	c
there	c
is	c
a	i
quite	i
good	c
reason	c
for	c
it	i
.	c

I	c
live	c
alone	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
cook	c
my	c
own	c
food	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
'm	c
the	c
worst	c
cooker	i
in	c
the	c
whole	c
world	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
pleased	c
and	c
very	c
excited	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
-	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
wait	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
Camp	c

At	c
present	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
taking	c
my	c
exams	c
and	c
am	c
fully	c
occupied	c
with	c
studying	c

It	c
would	c
also	c
be	c
a	c
chance	c
to	c
try	c
it	c
out	c
for	c
the	c
first	c
time	c
in	c

Would	c
there	c

You	c

know	c
everything	c
about	c
the	c
concert	c
?	c

God	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
so	c
excited	c
!	c

I	c
quickly	c
helped	c
others	c
to	c
decorate	c
and	c
to	c
'	c
polish	c
'	c
off	c
the	c
hall	c
-	c
we	c
blew	c
up	c
as	c
my	i
balloons	c
as	c
we	c
can	i
and	c
sprayed	c
them	c
with	i
gold	c
and	c
silver	c
.	c

There	c
must	c
have	c
been	c
hundreds	c
out	c
there	c
-	c
dancing	c
,	c
laughing	c
,	c
shouting.	c
.	c

and	c
I	c
was	c
having	c
a	i
time	c
of	c
my	c
life	c
!	c

I	c
handed	c
out	c
refreshment	c
to	c
the	c
pop	c
group	c
's	c
members	c
during	c
breaks	c
-	c
my	c
friends	c
were	c
so	c
jealous	c
of	c
me	c
!	c

At	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
the	c
concert	c
,	c
when	c
it	c
was	c
after	c
midnight	c
and	c
everyone	c
had	c
alread	i
left	c
,	c
the	c
group	c
came	c
up	c
to	c
each	c
of	c
us	c
(	c
who	c
helped	c
out	c
)	c
and	c
thanked	c
us	c
personally	c
!	c

I	c
mean	c
,	c
is	c
n't	c
that	c
really	c
nice	c
of	c
them	c
?	c

We	c
shook	c
hands	c
and	c
they	c
even	c
wrote	c
(	c
scribbled	c
?	c
)	c
their	c
signatures	c
on	c
my	c
T-shirt	c
!	c

Really	c
,	c
Kim	c
,	c
you	c
should	c
try	c
this	c
out	c
some	c
time	c

In	c

to	c
this	c

I	c
could	c
not	c
get	c
a	c

I	c
wonder	c
why	c
the	c
advertisement	c
mentioned	c
about	i
the	c
reduction	i
tickets	i

I	c
should	c
not	c
have	c
gone	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	i

I	c
recommend	c

about	c

One	c

I	c
had	c
a	c

I	c

believe	c
her	c
because	c
my	c
best	c
friend	c
was	c
a	c
boy	c
!	c

I	c
was	c
too	c
shocked	c
to	c
eat	c
anything	c
.	c

I	c
tried	c
to	c
avoid	c
thinking	c
about	c
it	c
but	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
.	c

I	c
dared	c
to	c
ask	c
him	c
and	c
he	c
told	c
me	c
his	i
truth	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
true	c
!	c

And	c
then	c
I	c
asked	c
him	c
to	c
split	c
up	c
with	c
my	c
best	c
friend	c
but	c
to	c
make	c
matters	c
worse	c
,	c
he	c
chose	c
my	c
best	c
friend	c

Now	c
I	c
have	c
the	c
opurtuanity	i
so	c
I	c
shall	c
inform	c
you	c
fully	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
been	c
sailing	c
in	c
the	c
Mediterennean	c
for	c
eight	c
years	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
playing	c
tennis	c
for	c
four	c
years	c
so	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
choose	c
sailing	c
and	c
tennis	c
activities	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
the	i
sort	c
of	c
the	i
clothes	c
I	c
am	c
supposed	c
bring	c

What	c
's	c
my	c
fund	i
limit	i
?	c

I	c
would	c
really	c
appreciate	c
if	i
you	c
could	c
write	c
me	i
back	c

Yours	c
Sincerely	i

I	c
received	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

I	c
,	c
ofcourse	i
jumped	i
into	i
it	c
.	c

The	c
idea	c
of	c
meeting	c
a	c
worldwide	i
known	i
pop	i
singer	i
;	i
just	c
made	c
my	c
heart	c
punch	c
my	c
ribcage	c
.	c

Waiting	c
to	c
hear	c
from	c
you	c

At	i
last	i
would	c
you	c

which	c
is	c
the	c
best	c
present	c

a	i
compact	c

Yours	c
faithfuly	i

Family	c
life	c
in	i
our	i
days	i
is	c
very	c
important	c
because	c
both	c
of	i
parents	c
work	c
and	c
they	c
have	c
n't	c
any	c
time	c
for	c
children	i
.	c

Parents	c
play	c
with	c
children	i
and	c
have	c
fun	c
.	c

And	c
the	c
difference	c
in	i
that	c
children	i
is	i
effectivily	i
when	c
they	c
grown	i
up	c
and	c
want	c
to	c
make	i
a	c
family	c
they	i
do	c
the	c
same	c
with	i
their	c
parents	c
and	c
make	i
a	c
happy	c
family	c
.	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
family	i
life	c
is	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
think	i
for	c
childrens	i
phycological	i
wold	i
which	c
help	i
them	c
in	c
their	c
education	c
,	c
job	c
and	c
their	c

Dear	c
Mrs.	c
Ryan	c
:	c

I	c
am	c

I	c

saying	c
that	c
I	c
won	c
first	c

,	c
a	c
two	c
week	c
holiday	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
in	c
U.S.A	i
,	c
and	c
that	c
you	c
need	c
further	c
information	c
from	c
me	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
on	i
July	c
,	c
because	c

the	c
only	c
month	c

holidays	c
in	c
.	c

About	c
the	c
activities	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
chosen	c
basketball	c
because	c
I	c
enjoy	c
playing	c
it	c
,	c
and	c
also	c
because	c
I	c
know	c
very	i
well	i
how	i
to	i
play	i
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
's	c
all	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
look	c
foreword	i
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

Yours	c
Sincerely	c
,	c

The	c
only	c
thing	c
you	c
mostly	i
say	c
is	c
,	c
"	c
If	c
I	c
had	c
more	c
money	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
buy	c
it	c
"	c
,	c
or	c
"	c
I	c
wish	c
I	c
had	c
more	c
money.	c
"	c

This	c
cituation	i
is	c
very	c
annoying	c
for	c
most	c
of	i
the	i
people	c
,	c
and	c
that	c
's	c
what	c
makes	c
shopping	c
unejoyable	i
.	c

AND	c
FOR	i
SEEING	c
IT	c
MY	c
FAMILY	c
HAD	c
A	c
VERY	c
DISAPPOINTING	c
EVENING	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

About	c
accomodation	i
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
cabins	i
,	c
because	c
I	c
suffer	c
alergic	i
,	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
tend	i
,	i
would	c
be	i
not	i
very	c
suitable	c
for	c
my	c
health	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
very	c
good	c
in	i
swimming	c
and	c
surfing	c
.	c

Swiming	i
I	i

competition	c
in	c

,	i
although	i
I	c
'm	c
not	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
surfing	c
I	c
like	c
,	i
and	c
I	c
always	c
practis	i
in	i
my	c
holidays	c
every	c
year	c
.	c

Im	i
very	c
greatful	i
to	c
hearing	i
from	c
you	c
.	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
happy	c
to	c
receive	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
sure	c
you	c
will	c
be	i
enjoy	c
.	i

You	c
asked	c
me	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
about	c
my	c
experience	c
to	i
help	i
in	i
the	c
concencert	i
last	c
week	c
.	c

Well	c
,	c
let	c
me	c
tell	c
you	c
,	c
first	c
of	c
all	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
nervous	i
you	i
know	c
was	i
my	c
first	c
time	c
in	i
such	c
event	i
.	c

However	c
I	i
was	c
not	c
very	c
sure	c
in	i
this	i
I	i
enjoy	i
.	c

You	c
immagine	i
how	c
existing	i
I	c
was	c
specially	i
because	c
I	c
always	c
wanted	c
some	c
photograph	i
with	i
them	c
and	c
this	c
was	c
special	i
moment	c
and	c
I	c
realice	i
I	c
did	i
n't	i
bring	i
my	c
camera	c
I	i
was	c
very	c
sad	c
.	c

Give	c
my	c
regards	c
to	c
your	c
boyfriend	c
.	c

With	c
Love	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
it	c
had	i
been	i
written	i
that	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
were	c
starring	c
,	c
but	c
Danny	c
was	c
n't	c
there	c
and	c
somebody	c
else	c
took	c
his	c
place	c
.	c

This	c
was	c
the	c
most	c
disappointing	c
thing	c
I	c
herd	i
.	c

You	c
ought	c
to	c
know	c
that	c
all	c
the	c
people	c
hated	c
to	i
wait	i
and	c
started	c
the	i
complains	i
.	c

The	c
discounts	c
were	c
n't	c
available	c
and	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
n't	c
open	c
,	i
because	c
the	c
owners	c
were	c
for	i
holidays	i
.	c

At	i
last	i
you	c
wrote	i
that	c
it	c
was	i
our	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
,	c
but	c
like	c
I	c
said	c
before	c
it	i
was	c
n't	c
.	c

Actually	c
it	c
was	c
terrible	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
have	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

She	c
had	i
really	i
let	i
me	i
down	i
.	c

It	c
took	c
us	c
a	c
few	i
time	c
to	c
became	i
best	c
friend	i
and	c
after	c
that	c
we	c
were	c
always	c
together	c
.	c

Anyway	c
,	c
always	i
I	i
trust	i
her	c
my	i
secrets	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
was	c
sure	c
she	c
would	c
n't	c
tell	c
them	c
to	c
other	c
people	c
,	c
even	c
if	c
some	c
say	i
we	c
would	c
be	c
apart	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
was	c
wrong	c
again	c
.	c

One	c
day	c
,	c
we	c
went	c
to	c
a	c
party	c
,	c
where	c
she	c
met	c
some	c
of	c
the	c
most	c
pobular	i
girls	c
in	c
the	c
school	c
.	c

She	c
started	c
to	c
act	c
like	c
them	c
and	c
speak	c
like	c
them	c
.	c

So	c
if	c
I	c
could	c
choose	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
.	c

Being	c
at	c
the	c
Camp	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
swim	c
and	c
to	c
play	c
tennis	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Warsaw	c
's	c
,	c
,	c
Clif	c
''	c
is	c
my	c
favourite	c
shopping	c
centre	c
so	c
I	c
went	c
there	c
.	c

I	c
decided	c
to	c
try	c
it	c
on	c
.	c

-	c
Och	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
sorry	c
,	c
but	c
we	c
have	c
run	c
out	c
of	c
36	i
size	i
.	c

I	c
was	c
going	c
to	c
the	c
chemist	c
to	c
buy	c
some	c
eye-shadow	c
,	c
when	c
I	c
saw	c
black	c
,	c
suede	c
shoes	c
.	c

I	c
went	c
in	c
and	c
I	c
asked	c
the	c
shop	c
assistant	c
if	c
I	c
could	c
try	c
it	i
on	c
.	c

-	c
38	c
-	c
I	c
said	c
.	c

-	c
I'am	i
very	c
sorry	c
but	c
we	c
do	c
not	c
have	c
38	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
angry	c
.	c

Everything	c
did	c
not	c
suit	c
me	c
!	c

Surely	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
the	c
best	c
day	c
for	c
shopping	c
.	c

Dear	c
Miss	c
Ryan	c
:	c

I	c
received	c
your	c
letter	c
about	c
the	c
two	c
weeks	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
not	c
that	c
much	c
of	c
a	c
"	c
nature	c
"	c
person	c
and	c
besides	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
feeling	c
a	c
little	c
sore	c
for	c
the	c
last	c
few	c
days	c
and	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
better	c
for	c
my	c
back	c
than	c
a	c
sleeping	c
bag	c
.	c

I	c
must	c
say	c
I	c
am	c
quite	c
good	c
at	c
tennis	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
n't	c
say	c
the	c
same	c
about	c
surfing	c
though	c
I	i
've	c
done	c
it	c
only	c
twice	c
in	c
my	c
entire	c
life	c
but	c
I	c
really	c
enjoyed	c
doing	c
it	c
.	c

And	c
one	c
last	c
thing	c
I	i
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
about	c
which	i
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
should	i
I	i
take	c
,	c
if	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
some	c
money	c
with	c
me	c
and	c
if	c
there	c
are	c
any	c
expenses	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
pay	i
at	c
the	c
camp	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
have	c
any	c
questions	c

do	c
not	c

about	i

Dear	c
Kim	c
:	c
Hi	c
!	c

How	c
are	c
you	c
?	c

How	c
has	c
your	c
family	c
been	c
?	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
are	c
doing	c
fine	i
,	c
I	c
am	c
and	c
so	c
is	c
my	c
family	c
and	c
everything	c
around	c
here	c
.	c

I	c
helped	c
Korn	c
in	i
a	c
concert	c
they	c
had	c
at	c
the	c
Auditorium	c
.	c

His	c
name	c
is	c
Jimme	c
,	c
he	c
is	c
a	c
really	c
nice	c
guy	c
.	c

Maybe	c
,	i
you	c
will	c
meet	c
him	c
one	c
day	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
it	c
turned	c
out	c
that	c
Jimme	c
was	c
organizing	c
the	c
concert	c
and	c
he	c
asked	c
me	c
and	c
three	c
of	c
my	c
friends	c
if	c
we	c
wanted	c
to	c
help	c
at	c
the	c
concert	c
.	c

Our	c
job	c
was	c
to	c
make	c
the	c
band	c
feel	c
comfortable	c
and	c
to	c
give	c
them	c
anything	c
they	c
pleased	i
.	c

We	c
even	c
took	i
pictures	i
with	c
them	c
and	c
they	c
gave	c
us	c
their	c
autographs	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
so	c
much	c
fun	c
,	c
we	c
had	c
a	c
great	c
time	c
that	c
night	c
.	c

Well	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
go	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
an	c
exam	c
tomorrow	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
n't	c
studied	c
at	c
all	c
.	c

Please	c
write	c
back	c

For	c
weeks	c
I	i
've	i
been	c
planing	i
to	c
go	c
to	c
this	i
threatre	i
with	c
some	c
close	c
relatives	c
and	c
friends	c
but	c
the	c
problems	c
that	c
we	c
had	c
made	c
this	c
perfect	c
night	c
a	c
disaster	c
has	i
all	c

To	c
make	c
matters	c
worse	c
the	i
restaurant	i
of	i
the	i

was	c
closed	c
.	c

You	c
can	c
understand	c
how	c
that	c
made	c
me	c
feel	c
,	c
and	c
when	i
the	i
tickets	i
had	i
no	i
discount	i

So	c
I	c
expect	c
nothing	c
less	c
than	c
a	c
full	c
refund	c
of	c
the	c
money	c
I	c
paid	c
to	c
see	c

What	c
are	c

If	c

I	c
take	i
the	c
dissision	i
to	c
write	c
to	c
you	c
because	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
complaine	i
about	c
the	i

I	c
write	i
to	c
you	c
because	c
last	c
night	c
I	c
expected	c
to	c
pass	i
a	c
wonderful	c
evening	c
and	c
unfortunatly	i
I	c
was	c
disappointing	i
a	i
lote	i

Me	i
and	c
some	c
athers	i
friends	c
we	i
disided	i
to	c
went	i
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
to	c
see	c
the	i
musical	c
show	c
.	c

We	c
are	i
saw	i
excitment	i

We	c
never	i
went	i
in	i
musical	i
show	c
and	c
we	c
thing	i
that	c
was	i
nowe	i
oportunite	i
.	c

I	c
believe	c
that	c
some	c
ather	i
actors	c
mabe	i
made	c
the	c
hole	i
store	i
to	i
be	i
more	c
interesting	c

We	c
wate	i
one	c
hour	c

I	c
can	c
say	c
that	c
I	c
want	i
to	c
go	c
.	i

but	c
I	c
stay	i
finally	i

When	c
we	c
went	c
to	c

the	i
tickets	c
there	c
no	i
discounts	c
and	c
we	c
are	i
6	c
people	c
all	i

I	c
dissapointing	i
so	i
mush	i
because	c
all	i
went	c
wrong	c
that	c
night	c
.	c

We	c
are	c
in	c
the	c
2000	i

Humans	c

They	c
invended	i

many	c
things	c
that	c
made	i
the	i
life	c
more	c
interesting	c
and	c
more	i
ezier	i

I	c
believe	c
that	c
I	c
am	c
lake	i
that	c
I	i
belong	c
to	c
that	c
centure	i

I	c
could	c

before	c

n't	i
travel	c
with	i

and	c

Personally	c
modern	i
technology	c
change	i
me	c
a	c
lot	c
.	c

I	c
can	c
spend	c
so	c
many	c
ours	i
because	c
day	c
by	c
day	c
I	c
discavered	i
new	c
things	c
.	c

All	c
this	i
are	c
in	i
my	c
life	c

Exactly	i
happend	i
and	i
with	i
telephone	i

About	c
the	c
gymnastick	i
centers	i
.	i

I	c
found	i
it	i
very	c
well	i
That	i
place	i
have	c
so	c
many	c
machines	c
that	c
you	c
can	c
eazy	i
loose	i
fat	i
and	c
made	i
a	c
wonderful	c
body	c
.	c

Now	c
if	i
we	i
made	i
a	i
conclution	i
we	c
can	c
see	c
or	i
I	c
can	c
see	c
that	i
mapy	i
I	c
do	i
n't	i
be	i
so	i
sociaple	i
person	c
bad	i
I	c
can	c
do	c
what	i
ever	i
I	c
want	c
and	c
take	c
what	i
ever	i
I	c
want	c
only	c
throu	i
the	i

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
express	c
my	c
dissatisfaction	c
about	i
the	c
musical	c
show	c
I	c
had	i
seen	i
yesterday	c
,	c
called	c
'	c
Over	c
The	c
Rainbow	c
'	c
.	c

Then	c
,	c
another	c
thing	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
mention	c
is	c
that	c
the	c
time	c
advertised	c
was	c
wrong	c
,	c
because	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
.	c

It	i
also	c
puts	i
that	c
there	c
was	c
a	c
restaurant	c
to	c
eat	c
in	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
completely	c
built	c
.	c

Yours	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

One	c
day	c
,	c
when	c
Peter	c
and	c
Pat	c
were	c
alone	c
in	c
class	c
,	c
he	c
confessed	c
her	i
that	c
he	c
was	c
gay	c
.	c

On	c
Saturday	c
Peter	c
,	c
Pat	c
and	c
some	c
other	c
friends	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
cinema	c
.	c

Peter	c
got	c
very	c
angry	c
and	c
told	i
Pat	c
why	c
did	i
they	i
say	i
that	c
to	c
him	c
.	c

Pat	c
did	c
not	c
answer	c
to	i
him	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c

Unfortunately	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
.	c

And	c
I	c
think	c
I	c
could	c
find	c
something	c
worth	i
to	c
do	c
than	c
just	c
writing	i
,	c
doing	c
nothing	c
during	c
this	c
spare	c
time	c
.	c

However	c
all	i
I	c
can	i
see	c
,	i
the	c
light	c
was	c
off	c
and	c
the	c
door	c
was	c
locked	c
.	c

This	c
is	c
because	c
they	c
are	c
rebuilding	c
it	c
again	c
.	c

It	c
would	c
be	c
greatful	i
if	c
you	c
consider	i
to	i
return	i
my	c
money	c
for	i
the	i
tickets	i
back	i
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c

something	c

easy	i
to	i

which	c
is	c

This	c
is	c
not	c

what	c

For	c

what	i

?	i

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

Moreover	c
,	c
the	c
theatre	i
's	i
play	c
was	c
expected	c
to	c
start	c
at	c
half	c
past	c
seven	c
in	c
the	c
afternoon	i
,	c
however	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
quarter	c
past	c
eight	c
!	c

This	c
so-called	c
"	c
Perfect	c
Evening	c
"	c
was	c
so	i
disappointing	c
as	c
well	c
as	c
discouraging	c
of	i
coming	i
to	c
your	i
Circle	c
Theatre	c
again	c
.	c

After	c
all	c
I	c
've	c
been	c
through	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
a	c
refund	c
of	c
my	c
money	c
.	c

Nowadays	c
,	c
the	i
technology	c
has	c
expanded	i
its	c
"	i
legs	i
"	i
to	c
almost	c
every	c
part	i
of	c
our	c
interests	c
,	c
jobs	c
and	c
even	c
hobbies	c
.	c

Therefore	c
,	c
our	i
life	c
has	c
changed	c
a	c
lot	c
since	c
a	c
hundred	c
years	c
ago	c
,	c
as	i
well	i
as	i
mine	i
did	i
.	c

I	c
use	c
it	c
a	c
lot	c
so	i
sometimes	c
I	c
feel	c
pain	c
in	c
my	c
eyes	c
or	c
my	c
hands	c
.	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
my	c
life	c
is	c
surrounded	i
by	i
modern	c
gadgets	c
.	c

It	c
only	i
depends	c
of	i
your	c
judgement	c
and	c
the	c
way	c
you	i
're	i
about	i
to	c
use	c
technology	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
received	c
your	c
letter	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
write	i
you	i
to	c
give	c
you	c
some	c
informations	i
from	i
me	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
on	i
July	c
because	c
I	c
finish	c
school	c
on	i
June	c
and	c
I	c
go	c
to	c
Great	c
Britain	c
on	i
August	c
for	c
one	c
month	c
.	c

I	c
prefer	c
this	c
accomodation	i
because	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
's	c
more	i
easy	i
to	c
met	i
people	c
when	c
you	c
live	i
in	c
tent	i
,	c
near	c
them	c
,	c
than	c
when	c
you	c
live	i
in	c
log	i
cabin	c
.	c

I	c
want	c
playing	i
tennis	c
and	c
swimming	i
.	c

I	c
did	i
n't	i
play	i
tennis	c
before	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
am	c
not	c
good	c
.	c

I	c
go	c
to	c
swimming-pool	i
two	c
time	i
by	i
week	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
am	c
good	c
at	c
this	c
sport	c
.	c

Could	c
you	c
tell	c
me	c
what	c
sort	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
will	c
have	c
to	c
wear	c
to	c
play	c
tennis	c
?	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
.	c

There	c
is	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
activities	c
and	c
lessons	c
at	c
our	c
school	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
's	c
difficult	c
to	c
chose	i
some	c
of	c
them	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
could	c
be	c
interested	i
to	c
show	c
how	c
students	c
work	c
to	c
write	c
the	c
new	i
paper	i
of	i
school	i
.	c

At	c
the	c
end	c
,	c
we	c
can	c
also	c
show	c
where	c
we	c
can	c
be	c
relaxed	c
.	c

All	c
this	i
activities	c
which	c
should	c
be	c
filmed	c
,	i
are	c
our	i
daily	c
life	c
at	c
our	c
school	c
.	c

To	c
make	c
matters	c
worse	c
when	c
we	c
bought	c
the	c
tickets	c
,	i
they	c
were	c
too	i
much	i
expensive	c
and	c
there	c
were	c
n't	c
any	c
discounts	c
for	c
young	c
people	c
or	c
for	c
groups	c
.	c

But	c
the	c
worst	c
happened	c
when	c
the	c
show	c
finished	c
,	c
because	c
we	c
(	c
my	c
girlfriend	c
and	c
I	c
)	c
were	c
hungry	c
and	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

Maybe	c
,	c
this	c
was	c
the	c
worst	c
show	c
I	c
have	c
ever	c
seen	c
and	c
for	c
this	c
I	i
'll	c
wait	c
for	c
the	i
refund	c
.	c

Jon	c
had	c
crashed	c
with	i
Pat	c
's	c
boyfriend	i
car	c
and	c
he	c
told	c
her	c
that	c
someone	c
had	c
kicked	i
the	c
car	c
with	c
a	c
metal	c
stick	c
.	c

Pat	c
's	c
boyfriend	c
could	c
n't	c
believe	c
that	c
story	c
but	c
Pat	c
trusted	c
in	i
Jon	c
and	c
she	c
thinked	i
that	c
he	c
was	c
honest	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
Jon	c
felt	c
very	c
disappointed	i
and	c
he	c
told	c
the	c
truth	c
.	c

At	i
the	i
beggining	i
they	c
did	c
n't	c
talk	c
to	c
each	c
other	c
but	c
yesterday	c
they	c
both	c
took	c
part	c
in	c
a	c
radio	c
programme	c
and	c
she	c
forgave	c
him	c
.	c

Now	c
Pat	c
is	c
angry	c
with	c
us	c
because	c
we	c
did	c
n't	c
explain	i
her	c
what	c
happened	c
that	c
night	c
,	c
and	c
because	c
she	c
has	c
left	c
her	c
boyfriend	c
.	c

IS	c
I	i
HAVE	c
FOBIA	i
TOWARDS	i

MY	c

FOR	i
THE	c
QUESTION	c
YOU	c
MADE	i
ABOUT	c
ACTIVITIES	c
MY	c
ANSWER	c
WOULD	c
BE	c
CLIMBING	c
AND	c
SWIMMING	c
.	c

I	c
CHOOSE	c
THIS	i
TWO	c
ACTIVITIES	c
BECAUSE	c
I	c
USED	c
TO	c
PRACTICE	i
THEM	c
LONG	i
TIME	c
AGO	c
AND	c
BESIDES	c
I	c
WOULD	c
SAY	c
I	c
HAVE	c
THE	c
SKILLS	c
AND	c
ABILITY	c
TO	c
MAKE	i
THEM	c
.	c

I	c
WOULD	c
LIKE	c
TO	c
ASK	c
YOU	c
IF	c
IT	c

NECESARY	i

NOW	c
THAT	c
THE	c
STUDENTS	c
HAVE	c
GATHER	i
UP	i

TO	c

A	c

ABOUT	c

EVERY	c

OF	c

WITH	c

IT	c
WOULD	c
BE	c
MY	c
SUGGESTION	c
TO	c
THE	c
PRODUCERS	c
OF	c
THIS	c

THAT	c
THEY	c
SHOULD	c
GET	i
FOUCOSED	i
IN	i
OUR	c

;	i
DO	i
N'T	i

MY	c

ALTHOUG	i
LOTS	c

N'T	c
BELIVE	i
IT	c
,	c
SPORTS	i
ARE	i
THE	i
IMAGE	i
OF	i
OUR	i
SCHOOL	i
,	i
I	c
THINK	c
THE	c
VIDEO	c
WOULD	c
ENCOURGE	i
STUDENTS	c
TO	c
DO	c
SPORTS	c
AND	c
BE	c
GOOD	c
ATHLETS	i
.	c

BESIDES	c
THAT	i
WOULD	c
KEEP	c
US	c
OUT	i

DO	c
N'T	c
YOU	c

AMIDIO	c

I	c
have	c
received	c
a	c

that	c
I	c

of	c
person	c
who	c
enjoy	i

have	i
a	c
wild	c
and	c
simple	c
life	c

so	c
I	c

be	i
accommodated	i
in	c

About	c
the	c
activities	c
,	c
the	c
first	c

is	c

I	c
have	c
a	c

The	c
second	c
one	c
is	c

I	c

this	c
sport	c

I	c
would	c

Hi	c
Helen	c
,	c

Im	i
very	c
excited	c
because	c
I	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
and	c
my	c
family	c
is	c
very	c
proud	c
of	c
me	c

About	c
my	c
acommodations	i
in	i
the	c
camp	c
I	i
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
because	c
it	c
's	c
safer	c
than	c
being	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
and	c
because	c
you	c
sleep	c
more	c
confortable	i
.	c

The	c
activities	c
that	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
do	c
are	c
signing	i
because	i
my	c
friend	c
told	c
me	c
that	c
im	i
good	c
at	c
it	c
.	i

I	c
just	c
want	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
for	i
something	c
else	c
.	c

do	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
?	c
and	i
how	c
much	c
money	c
would	i
I	c
need	c
to	c
bring	c
in	c
my	c
pocket	c
?	c

I	c
appreciate	c
that	i
opportuniti	i
that	c
you	c
are	c
giving	c
to	i
me	c
and	c
Im	i
very	c
thankful	i
to	c
you	c
guys	c

Well	c
on	c
march	c
11th	c
there	c
was	c
group	i
here	c
in	c
brazil	c
named	i
"	c
Los	c
Jagoares	c
"	c
they	i
sing	c
pop	c
music	c
.	c

and	i
its	i
one	c
of	c
my	c
favorites	i
and	c
as	c
you	c
know	c
I	c
have	c
a	c
cousin	c
that	c
works	c
as	c
a	i
organizer	c
for	c
all	c
the	c
bands	c
that	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
concert	c
in	c
brazil	i
and	c
when	c
my	c
cousin	c
knew	c
that	c
my	c
favorite	i
band	c
was	c
coming	c
he	c
called	c
me	c
and	c
told	i
me	c
that	i
if	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
help	c
them	c
to	c
install	c
the	c
speakers	c
,	c
microphones	c
etc	c
...	c

That	c
night	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
stadium	c
and	c
I	c
met	c
the	c
singer	i
his	i
name	c
is	c
saul	c
Hernañdez	c
and	c
he	c
is	c
very	c
funny	i
that	i
night	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
fun	c
with	c
them	c
and	c
of	c
course	c
I	c
was	c
on	i
the	c
first	c
line	i
in	i
the	c
concert	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
are	c
having	c
fun	c
and	c
that	c
you	c
are	c
OK	c

Dear	c
manager	i
of	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c

Last	c
Sanday	i
my	c
friends	c
and	c
I	c
saw	c
that	c
advertisement	c
about	c
the	c
theatre	i
you	c
were	c
supposed	c
to	c
present	i
.	c

We	c
really	c
got	c
bored	c
as	i
all	c
the	c
other	c
peaple	i
there	c
.	c

We	c
were	c
very	c
disappointed	c
because	c
before	c
this	c
happened	c
we	c
pouded	i
the	c
tickets	c
but	c
there	c
were	c
no	c
discounts	c
available	c
.	c

Then	c
we	c
expected	c
to	c
,	i
see	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
.	c

That	c
was	c
very	c
disapponted	i
.	c

Fortunately	c
the	c
show	c
finished	c
.	c

We	c
decided	c
to	c
visit	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
.	c

That	c
was	c
bad	i
organized	c
evening	c
we	i
thought	c
.	c

When	c
we	c
asked	c
why	c
was	i
it	i
closed	c
the	i
people	c
there	c
told	c
us	c
that	c
they	c
did	c
not	c
organized	i
it	c
before	c

I	c
must	c
admit	c
that	c
,	i
that	c
evening	c
was	c
n't	c
the	c
perfect	c
one	c
out	i
for	c
me	c
but	i
I	i
and	i
for	i
my	i
friends	i
either	i
.	c

My	c
friends	c
and	c
I	c
demand	c
our	c
money	c
bacck	i
real	i
soon	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
;	i
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

I	c
did	i
a	c
big	c
mistake	c
by	c
trusting	c
him	c
.	c

She	c
and	c
Pat	c
had	c
a	c
special	c
relationship	c
.	c

After	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
thought	c
I	c
told	c
it	i
to	i
him	c
.	c

He	c
told	c
me	c
that	c
he	c
had	c
to	c
tell	c
it	i
to	i
my	c
grandmother	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
n't	c
do	c
anything	c
.	c

My	c
grandmother	c
was	c
very	c
sensitive	c
and	c
bored	c
life	i
and	c
when	c
she	c
heart	i
it	c
her	i
condition	c
became	c
more	c
serious	c
.	c

After	c
two	c
days	c
she	c
died	c
.	c

We	c
knew	c
we	c
had	c
lost	c
her	c
for	c
ever	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Brown	c
,	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
suggested	i
you	i
to	i
come	i
to	c
our	c
party	c
and	c
we	c
would	c
like	c
not	i
to	c
tell	i
anything	i
to	i
your	i
husband	i
because	c
the	c
party	c
is	c
a	c
surprise	c
.	c

The	c
party	c
will	c
be	c
organised	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
the	c
16th	c
of	c
June	c
at	c
three	c
to	c
six	c
pm	c
at	i
college	i
Canteen	i
.	c

We	c
will	c
have	c
food	c
and	c
drink	c
and	c
we	c
will	c
have	c
music	c
because	c
we	c
know	c
that	c
Mr	c
Brown	c
loves	c
music	c
.	c

My	c
fellow	c
students	c
have	c
suggested	c
to	i
buy	i
a	c
CD	c
or	c
a	c
Book	i
.	c

We	c
would	c
like	c
to	i
tell	c
us	c
which	c
is	c
the	c
best	c
present	c
for	c
him	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c
.	c

I	c
did	c
n't	c
beleive	i
him	c
at	i
the	i
first	i
time	i
.	c

I	c
stopped	c
talking	c
to	c
my	c
friends	c
and	c
I	c
followed	c
him	c
.	c

We	c
started	c
walking	c
and	c
walking	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
n't	c
beleive	i
I	i
have	i
to	i
see	i
him	c
for	c
five	c
years	c
.	c

As	c
requested	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
choosed	i
two	c
activities	c
-	c
sailing	c
and	c
surfing	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
quite	c
experienced	c
in	i
surfing	c
-	c
I	c
have	c
participated	c
some	i
competitions	c
-	c
whereas	c
not	i
at	c
all	c
experienced	c
in	i
sailing	c
.	c

Also	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
if	c
there	c
is	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
qualified	i
instructor	c
for	c
activities	c
since	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
beginning	i
in	i
sailing	c
as	c
mentioned	c
before	c
.	c

Thanks	c
for	c
your	c
last	c
letter	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
great	c
to	c
hear	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
sorry	c
I	c
have	c
n't	c
written	c
before	c
,	c
but	c
as	c
you	c
know	c
,	c
I	c
've	c
been	c
very	c
busy	c
because	c
I	c
was	c
helping	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
last	c
month	c
.	c

I	c
helped	c
people	c
setting	c
and	i
decorating	c
the	c
concert	c
hall	c
which	c
was	c
great	c
help	c
for	c
my	c
major	c
subject	c
-	c
You	c
know	c
that	c
my	c
subject	c
is	c
design	c
.	c

What	c
I	c
particularly	c
enjoyed	c
was	c
meeting	c
the	c
famous	c
musicians	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
dreaming	c
to	i
see	i
.	c

The	c
day	c
I	c
shaked	i
their	c
hands	c
,	c
I	i
though	i
I	i
was	i
over	i
the	i
moon	i
!	i

I	c
will	c
never	c
forget	c
that	c
day	c
.	c

Write	c
son	i
and	c
let	c
me	c
know	c
what	c
you	c
have	c
been	c
doing	c
.	c

Mr.	i
Jones	c
,	c

How	c
are	c
you	c
?	c

Because	c
you	c
are	c
the	c
manager	c
at	i
the	c
theatre	c
,	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
know	c
,	i
the	i
problems	c
which	c
it	c
has	c
.	c

I	c
did	c
n't	c
see	c
anywhere	i
Danny	i
Brook	i
,	c
but	c
another	c
actor	c
.	c

That	c
it	i
was	c
a	c
big	c
mistake	c
.	c

Unfortunatly	i
your	c
advertisment	i
said	c
that	c
the	c
show	c
starts	c
at	c
19:30	c
but	c
it	c
started	c
45	c
minutes	c
later	c
.	c

Also	c
there	c
were	c
n't	c
any	c
discounts	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
that	c
's	c
why	c
I	c
'm	c
asking	c
you	c
to	c
give	c
me	c
,	i
some	c
of	c
money	i
back	c
.	c

The	i
perfect	i
evening	i
out	i
I	i
was	i
waiting	i
for	i
,	c
it	c
was	c
finally	i
one	c
of	c
the	c
most	c
disappointed	i
,	i
of	i
mine	i
.	c

How	c
has	c
modern	c
technology	c
changed	c
your	c
daily	c
life	c
?	c

That	c
's	c
a	c
good	c
question	c
!	c

I	c
know	c
that	c
,	i
each	c
student	c
gave	i
its	i
different	i
answers	i
,	c
but	c
some	c
of	c
us	c
will	c
have	c
some	c
opinions	i
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
,	i
the	c
big	i
'	i
improve	i
'	i
of	c
technology	c
the	i
last	c
30	c
years	c
helped	i
and	c
still	i
helping	c
us	c
a	c
lot	c
in	c
our	c
daily	c
life	c
.	c

With	c
T.V	i
we	c
can	c
learn	c
,	i
what	c
is	c
going	c
on	c
all	c
over	c
the	c
world	c
.	c

We	c
can	c
see	c
new	c
countries	c
,	c
learn	c
about	c
their	c
history	c
etc.	c
With	c
my	c
computer	c
(	c
internet	i
)	c
I	c
can	c
speak	c
with	i
my	c
friends	c
,	i
as	i
far	i
they	c
are	c
.	c

All	c
these	i
may	c
be	i
sounds	i
great	c
,	c
but	c
they	i
are	i
n't	i
all	c
.	i

You	c
might	c
not	c
know	c
your	c
neighbour	c
because	c
all	i
the	i
time	i
your	i
in	i
the	i
house	i
.	c

That	c
's	c
why	c
my	c
marks	c
this	c
year	c
were	c
bit	i
low	c
.	c

This	c
is	c
also	c
another	c
reason	i
of	c
heard	i
attacts	i
.	c

I	c
'm	c
very	c
much	c
surprised	c
to	c
receive	c
your	c
letter	c
announcing	c
the	c
first	i
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
and	c
I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
spend	i
the	i
two	c
weeks	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
.	c

The	c
second	c
week	c
of	c
July	c
would	c
be	c
perfect	c
to	c
start	c
my	c
trip	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
rather	c
sleep	c
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
.	c

I	i
've	i
joined	i
a	c
climbing	c
group	i
in	c
my	c
town	c
2	i
years	c
and	i
reached	i
the	c
top	c
of	c
several	c
middle-high	c
mountains	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
some	c
questions	c
that	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
about	i
.	c

Do	c
I	c
need	c
passport	i
to	c
travel	c
?	c

What	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
would	c
be	c
appropriate	c
,	c
winter	c
or	c
summer	c
?	c

Are	c
there	c
any	c
food	i
service	i
at	c
the	c
camp	c
?	c

I	c
hope	c
to	c
hear	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

The	c
opening	c
time	i
recording	i
the	c
students	c
while	c
they	c
meet	c
outside	c
the	c
school	c
and	c
come	c
in	c
could	i
be	c
a	c
good	c
begining	i
.	c

Practically	c
the	c
whole	c
school	c
would	c
appear	c
on	c
the	c
video	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

Your	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
musical	c
show	i
,	i
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
,	i
said	c
it	c
was	c
London	c
's	c
newest	c
and	c
best	c
musical	c
show	c
,	i
I	c
agree	c
with	c
that	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
wonderfull	i
show	c
but	c
,	i
it	c
said	c
that	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
would	c
be	c
starring	c
in	c
it	c
.	c

The	c
show	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
when	c
it	c
actually	c
should	c
have	c
started	c
at	c
19:30	c
.	c

What	c
I	c
'm	c
trying	c
to	c
say	c
is	c
that	c
this	c
was	c
n't	c
my	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
and	c
that	c
I	c
should	c
get	c
at	c
least	c
some	c
money	c
back	c
!	c

As	c
we	c
know	c
,	c
Carla	c
and	c
Pat	c
were	c
good	c
friends	c
so	c
Carlotta	c
would	c
tell	c
Pat	c
anything	c
.	c

This	c
time	c
she	c
told	c
Pat	c
that	c
she	c
thought	c
her	c
dog	c
,	c
Churls	c
,	c
was	c
going	c
to	c
die	c
.	c

Pat	c
could	c
n't	c
resist	c
herself	i
and	c
told	c
her	c
brother	c
Jacob	c
,	i
he	i
was	c
quite	c
shocked	c
about	c
the	c
news	c
because	c
,	i
he	c
missunderstood	i
.	c

There	c
,	c
Jacob	c
aproaches	i
to	i
him	c
slowly	c
and	c
tells	c
him	c
.	c

"	c
She	c
said	c
she	c
was	c
going	c
to	c
kill	c
you	c
!	c
"	c

Jacob	c
shouts	c
.	c

Charles	c
exclaims	c
.	c

When	c
Charles	c
told	c
Carlotta	c
what	c
he	c
knew	c
,	c
Carlotta	c
started	c
crying	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
all	c
a	c
missunderstanding	i
.	c

They	c
managed	c
to	c
sort	c
everything	c
out	c
and	c
Carlotta	c
never	c
had	c
anymore	c
secrets	c
.	c

My	c
name	c
is	c
Alois	c
Blau	c
and	c
I	c
'm	c
very	c
happy	c
that	c
I	c
've	c
won	c
this	c
competition	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
I	c
can	c
only	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
attend	c
school	c
until	c
June	c
the	c
30th	c
and	c
in	c
August	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
work	c
in	c
an	c
office	c
for	i
experience	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
,	i
that	c
's	c
possible	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
living	i
in	c
a	c
tent	c
during	c
the	c
two	c
weeks	c
because	c
I	c
think	c
a	c
tent	c
is	c
more	i
natural	i
.	c

A	c
log	c
cabin	c
does	c
n't	c
sound	c
like	c
a	c
camp	i
holiday	c
.	c

From	c
the	c
activities	c
I	i
want	c
to	i
take	i
Golf	i
and	i
Surfing	i
.	c

Yours	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

Many	c
people	c
say	c
that	c
this	c
is	c
real	c
shopping	c
,	c
when	c
you	c
queue	c
for	c
hours	c
to	i
pay	i
only	i
a	i
pair	c
of	c
socks	c
or	c
a	c
bottle	c
of	c
mineral	c
water	c
at	c
the	c
supermarket	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
see	c
this	c
musical	c
'	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
'	c
because	c
the	c
actor	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
was	c
acting	c
in	c
it	c
.	c

Then	c
,	c
the	c
musical	c
did	c
n't	c
start	c
on	c
time	c
.	c

All	c
the	c
people	c
got	c
very	c
angry	c
.	c

Also	c
I	c
bought	c
a	c
£	c
20	c
ticket	c
because	c
in	i
the	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
show	c
was	i
put	i
that	c
discounts	c
were	c
available	c
for	c
£	c
10	c
£	c
15	c
,	c
£	c
20	c
tickets	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
n't	c
have	c
my	c
ticket	c
discounted	c
because	c
when	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
buy	c
it	c
they	c
told	c
me	c
that	c
was	c
untrue	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
ridiculous	c
!	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
have	c
my	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
,	c
in	c
other	c
words	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
very	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
so	c
I	c
am	c
asking	c
you	c
for	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
telling	c
you	c
this	c
because	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
big	c
trouble	i
a	c
few	c
days	c
ago	c
because	c
of	c
her	c
.	c

Pat	c
used	c
to	c
be	c
my	c
best	c
friend	c
but	c
a	c
few	c
days	c
ago	c
I	c
knew	i
all	i
the	c
truth	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
always	c
talking	c
to	c
her	c
and	c
she	c
was	c
always	c
listening	c
to	c
me	c
but	c
she	c
did	c
n't	c
talk	c
to	c
me	c
very	c
much	c
about	c
herself	c
.	c

At	c
first	c
,	c
I	c
thought	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
bit	c
strange	c
but	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
care	c
too	c
much	c
about	c
that	c
and	c
I	c
easily	c
forgot	c
it	c
.	c

In	c
other	c
words	c
,	c
Pat	c
knew	c
all	c
my	c
secrets	c
.	c

I	c
started	c
to	c
get	c
along	c
with	c
other	c
people	c
and	c
had	c
new	c
friends	c
but	c
I	c
continued	c
telling	c
Pat	c
my	c
secrets	c
.	c

My	c
new	c
friends	c
sometimes	c
talked	c
to	c
me	c
about	c
Pat	c
and	c
they	c
asked	c
me	c
once	c
if	c
we	c
were	c
close	c
friends	c
.	c

I	c
asked	c
them	c
why	c
they	c
had	c
asked	c
me	c
that	c
.	c

They	c
told	c
me	c
Pat	c
used	c
to	c
be	c
a	c
close	c
friend	c
of	c
them	i
and	c
she	c
used	c
to	c
talk	c
about	c
me	c
and	c
my	c
problems	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
they	c
had	c
already	c
knew	i
all	c
my	c
secrets	c
for	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
!	c

I	c
asked	c
her	c
why	c
she	c
could	c
n't	c
keep	c
my	c
secrets	c
and	c
she	c
told	c
me	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
impossible	c
for	c
her	c
keeping	i
secrets	c
.	c

Now	c
I	c
'm	c
very	c
happy	c
with	c
my	c
new	c
friends	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
learnt	c
that	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
trust	c
anybody	c
too	c
much	c
because	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
really	c
know	c
how	i
the	c
person	c
is	c
like	c
.	c

I	c
cannot	c
bear	c
when	i
somebody	c
says	c
something	c
and	c
then	c
does	c
just	c
the	c
opposit	i
way	i
.	c

To	c
begin	c
with	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
inform	c
you	c
,	c
in	c
case	c
you	c
do	c
not	c
know	c
that	i
the	c
play	c
does	c
not	c
start	c
at	c
19.30	c
as	c
it	c
says	c
.	i

What	c
is	c
more	c
it	i
lasted	i
45	c
minutes	c
of	c
waiting	c
to	i
start	i
and	c
did	i
not	c
supply	i
all	c
the	c
expectations	c
people	c
had	c
.	c

The	c
last	c
thing	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
complain	c
for	i
is	c
that	c
the	c
Theatre	c
Restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
because	i
,	c
as	c
it	i
said	i
,	c
of	c
"	c
VACATIONS	c
"	c
.	c

If	c
in	i
the	c
advertisements	c
and	c
leaflets	c
says	i
"	c
VISIT	c
OUR	c
THEATRE	c
RESTAURANT	c
AFTER	c
THE	c
SHOW	c
"	c
there	c
are	i
not	i
reasons	i
for	c
being	i
closed	c
.	c

It	c
must	c
be	c
our	c
decission	i
whether	c
to	c
stay	c
and	c
eat	c
there	c
,	c
or	c
not	c
.	c

HOW	c
HAS	c
TECHNOLOGY	c
CHANGED	c
OUR	c
DAYLY	i
LIFES	i

First	c
,	c
we	c
have	c
to	c
admit	c
that	c
technology	c
has	c
really	c
increased	c
the	i
access	i
to	i
communication	i
,	c
traveling	i
and	c
geting	i
information	c
.	c

You	c
can	c
now	c
know	c
what	c
happens	i
on	c
the	c
other	c
side	c
of	c
the	c
world	c
,	i
at	c
the	c
same	c
time	c
it	i
is	c
happening	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
as	c
we	c
all	c
know	c
,	c
day	i
life	c
now	i
a	i
days	i
is	c
quite	c
simplier	i
and	c
an	c
example	c
of	c
this	c
is	c
that	c
instead	c
of	c
buying	c
a	c
peice	i
of	c
ice	c
to	c
cool	c
drinks	c
(	c
as	c
our	c
grandparents	c
used	c
to	c
do	c
)	c
we	c
not	c
only	c
have	c
a	c
refrigerator	c
but	c
also	c
a	c
freezer	c
in	c
case	c
you	c
want	c
it	c
faster	c
and	c
cooler	i
.	c

As	c
people	c
do	c
not	c
get	c
a	i
job	i
because	c
is	i
not	c
needed	c
they	c
get	i
into	c
poorness	i
,	c
criminal	c
activities	c
,	c
being	i
isolated	c
and	c
without	i
the	i
possibility	i
of	c
getting	c
a	c
good	c
education	c
.	c

This	c
is	c
the	c
most	c
terribly	i
disadvantage	c
technology	c
has	c
.	c

Things	i
and	i
technology	i
changes	i
every	i
day	i
our	c
life	c
,	c
our	c
jobs	c
,	c
our	c
way	c
of	c
face	i
the	c
world	c
,	c
this	c
is	c
what	i
differences	i
both	i
centuries	i
,	i
our	i
grandparents	i
'	i
changes	i
lasted	i
to	i
long	i
to	i
change	i
human	i
life	i

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
thank	c
for	i
noticing	i
me	c
about	c
the	c
competition	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
be	c
very	c
grateful	i
in	i
giving	i
to	c
you	c
the	c
information	c
was	i
requiered	i
in	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

I	c
regret	c
to	c
inform	c
you	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
had	c
some	c
problems	c
in	c
my	c
full-time	c
sales	c
assistant	c
job	c
so	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
rather	c
travel	c
only	c
in	c
July	c
than	c
other	c
months	c
.	c

About	c
the	c
Accommodation	c
I	i
would	c
like	c
you	c
to	c
take	c
careful	c
consideration	c
that	i
I	c
am	c
ashmatic	i
so	i
,	i
I	c
would	c
appreciatte	i
it	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
reserve	c
a	c
bed	c
in	c
log	i
cabins	i
.	c

Your	c
letter	c
also	c
mentioned	c
some	c
kind	c
of	c
activities	c
in	c
which	c
we	c
can	c
involve	i
through	i
the	c
camping	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
choose	c
painting	c
and	c
photography	c
which	c
are	c
my	c
favourites	i
ones	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
recently	c
finished	c
a	c
three	i
year	i
course	c
of	i
painting	c
and	c
I	c
always	i
be	i
fascinated	c
by	c
the	i
photography	c
.	c

Well	c
,	c
I	c
've	c
been	c
very	c
busy	c
you	i
know	c
.	c

We	c
just	c
worked	c
in	i
building	c
the	c
stage	c
and	c
all	c
those	i
of	c
thing	c
.	c

Putting	c
the	c
instrument	i
in	c
the	c
right	c
place	c
,	c
testing	c
all	c
the	c
microphone	i
as	c
well	c
as	c
the	c
sound	c
was	c
the	c
rest	c
of	c
the	c
job	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
had	i
this	c
oportunitty	i
one	c
day	c
,	c
you	c
had	c
better	c
buy	c
the	c
ticket	c
to	c
the	c
concert	c
or	c
just	c
watch	c
it	c
on	c
TV	c
but	c
never	c
do	c
something	c
like	c
just	i
to	c
get	c
a	c
free	c
pass	c
.	c

Danny	c
Brook	c
was	c
one	c
of	c
my	c
best	c
friends	c
while	c
I	c
was	c
at	c
University	c
.	c

But	c
as	c
the	c
show	c
began	c
,	c
I	c
realised	c
that	c
the	c
actor	c
was	c
someone	c
different	c
,	c
his	c
name	c
was	c
Tim	c
Paradise	c
.	c

If	c
this	c
had	c
been	c
my	c
only	c
disappointment	c
nothing	c
would	c
have	c
happened	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
wait	c
stil	i
quarter	c
past	c
eight	c
in	i
order	i
to	c
watch	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
instead	c
of	c
beggining	i
at	c
half	c
past	c
seven	c
as	c
you	c
had	c
written	c
in	c
your	c
advertisement	c
.	c

For	c
all	c
of	c
these	c
reasons	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
for	i
having	i
my	i
money	c
back	c
.	c

a	c
disappointed	c
user	i
!	c

It	c
consisted	c
in	c
having	c
to	c
memorisize	i
a	c
whole	c
book	c
of	c
250	c
pages	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
pass	c
a	c
final	c
exam	c
.	c

Although	c
this	c
project	c
could	c
seem	c
a	i
very	c
though	i
work	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
try	c
it	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
rise	i
my	c
low	c
global	i
mark	c
.	c

Suddenly	i
,	c
when	c
the	c
teacher	c
went	c
out	c
of	c
his	c
office	c
,	c
I	c
quickly	c
copied	c
the	c
answers	c
on	i
my	c
notebook	c
,	i
I	c
could	c
n't	c
believe	c
it	c
,	i
that	i
would	c
be	c
the	c
easiest	c
exam	c
I	c
would	c
had	i
ever	i
done	i
.	c

As	c
she	c
was	c
also	c
making	i
the	c
project	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
let	c
her	c
copy	c
the	c
answers	c
.	c

I	c
told	c
her	c
she	c
had	i
n't	i
to	i
talk	i
about	c
that	i
to	c
anybody	c
.	c

She	c
agreed	c
and	c
went	c
home	c
very	c
happy	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
the	c
last	c
time	c
I	c
trusted	c
in	i
Pat	c
.	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
informing	c
me	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
the	c
competition	c
.	c

Firstly	c
I	c
will	c
be	i
able	i
to	i
travel	i
just	i
in	c
july	i
because	c
my	c
class	c
starts	c
the	c
month	c
after	c
this	i
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Nowadays	c
most	c
of	i
the	i
people	c
are	c
atractted	i
by	i
shopping	c
centers	c
,	c
which	c
is	i
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
some	c
opinions	c
to	i
this	c
,	c
which	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
tell	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
people	c
have	c
to	c
look	c
after	c
their	c
money	c
in	c
the	c
shops	c
,	c
and	c
do	i
n't	i
spend	c
it	c
in	i
the	i
thing	i
that	c
they	c
do	c
n't	c
need	c
because	i
by	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
the	c
month	c
they	c
wo	c
n't	c
have	c
money	i
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
I	c
have	i
seen	i
last	c
Friday	c
in	c
your	c
theatre	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
your	c
advertisement	c
about	i
it	c
was	c
n't	c
true	c
!	c

Firstly	c
,	c
it	i
's	i
written	c
that	i
it	i
will	i
be	i
played	i
by	i
Danny	i
Brook	i
,	c
but	c
in	c
fact	c
it	i
was	c
n't	c
.	c

At	i
least	i
,	c
after	c
all	c
my	c
disappointments	c
when	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
visit	c
your	c
restaurant	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
too	c
late	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
you	c
are	c
not	c
a	c
good	c
manager	c
.	c

Therefore	c
,	c
I	c
should	c
be	c
grateful	c
if	c
you	c
would	c
send	c
me	c
back	c
some	c
money	c
for	c
all	c
the	c
disagreements	i
I	c
've	c
had	c
in	c
your	c
theatre	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

We	c
spent	c
all	c
our	c
childhood	c
together	c
usually	i
driving	c
our	c
parents	c
mad	c
.	c

As	c
we	c
grown	i
up	c
,	c
we	c
were	c
getting	c
closer	c
and	c
closer	c
sharing	i
all	c
our	c
love	c
stories	c
and	c
even	c
more	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
do	c
have	c
a	c
problem	c
with	c
her	c
.	c

Even	c
worth	i
,	c
she	c
is	c
not	c
able	c
to	c
keep	c
anything	c
.	i

Last	c
year	c
,	c
Pat	c
and	c
I	c
were	c
driving	c
back	c
home	c
and	c
unfortunately	c
driving	i
too	c
fast	c
I	i
drove	c
through	c
the	c
front	c
gate	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
wondering	c
how	c
to	c
tell	c
my	c
parents	c
and	c
I	c
asked	c
Pat	c
if	c
she	c
could	c
keep	c
it	c
secret	c
till	c
I	c
found	c
the	c
way	c
to	c
tell	c
them	c
.	c

Of	c
course	c
,	c
the	c
following	c
day	c
all	c
my	c
family	c
had	c
heard	c
about	i
my	c
odd	c
story	c
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
to	c
this	c
,	c
why	c
do	c
I	c
still	c
go	i
on	c
with	c
her	c
,	i
it	i
's	i
the	c
fact	c
I	c
love	c
her	c
as	c
well	i
as	c
my	c
sister	c
and	c
I	c
know	c
that	c
she	c
can	c
change	c
it	i
if	c
she	c
would	i
because	c
last	i
week	c
,	c
she	c
organized	c
a	c
huge	c
party	c
for	c
me	c
,	c
without	c
telling	c
me	c
.	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
impressed	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
your	c
competition	c
.	c

Firstly	c
I	i
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
only	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
two	c
months	i
holiday	c
which	c
are	c
July	c
and	c
August	c
,	i
I	c
choose	c
July	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
the	c
only	c
one	i
month	c
that	c
I	c
think	c
I	c
'm	c
free	c
.	c

In	c
August	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
work	c
so	i
.	c

Secondly	c
I	i
prefer	c
the	c
tents	c
because	c
I	c
've	c
never	c
been	c
in	c
that	i
tent	c
so	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
try	c
.	c

Thirdly	c
for	i
the	c
activities	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
chose	i
climbing	c
and	c
photography	c
,	i
I	c
have	c
never	c
done	c
them	c
before	c
.	c

How	i
much	i
do	i
I	i
have	i
to	i
bring	i
the	i
money	i
?	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c

Shopping	c
is	c
when	c
human	i
goes	i
to	c
the	c
shop	i
and	c
buy	c
what	c
they	c
went	i
,	i
however	i
I	i
think	c
this	c
word	c
is	c
for	c
women	c
because	c
they	c
like	c
beautiful	c
clothes	c
all	i
sort	i
of	c
things	c
.	c

Anyway	c
shopping	i
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
as	c
the	c
title	c
because	i
firstly	c
you	c
will	c
get	c
tied	i
because	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
walk	c
out	i
and	i
in	i
the	c
shops	c
.	c

Thirdly	c
if	i
you	c
're	c
fat	c
you	c
wo	c
n't	c
find	c
you	i
size	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
if	c
you	c
have	c
lots	c
of	c
money	c
and	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
what	c
to	c
do	c
with	c
it	c
,	c
do	c
not	c
go	c
shopping	c
give	c
the	c
money	c
to	c
charity	c
,	i
that	i
is	c
better	c
than	c
shopping	c
.	c

For	i
me	i
my	i
opinions	i
on	i
this	i
one	i
is	i
true	c
it	c
is	c
boring	c
,	i
it	i
might	c
because	i
I	c
am	c
a	c
boy	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madame	i
,	c

Moreover	c
the	i
show	c
was	c
awful	c
.	c

I	c
like	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
's	c
acting	c
but	c
he	i
actors	c
were	c
changed	c
without	c
mentioning	c
,	c
also	c
the	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
by	i
the	c
excuse	c
to	i
be	i
repaired	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
recieving	c
your	c
prompt	c
reply	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

Return	c
to	c
the	i
Nature	c
.	c

One	c
of	c
them	c
is	c
fashion	i
area	i
.	c

people	i
think	c
that	c
we	c
will	c
wear	c
a	i
simple	c
,	c
practical	c
,	c
light	c
clothes	c
.	c

People	c
like	c
designer	c
's	c
clothes	c
like	c
Armani	c
,	c
Chanel.	c
.	c

so	i
on	c
.	c

They	c
prefer	c
new	c
original	c
style	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
show	i
them	i
more	c
attractive	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
most	c
designers	c
prefer	c
to	c
use	c
natural	c
material	c
.	c

They	c
have	c
used	c
animal	c
and	c
fish	c
skins	c
,	c
some	c
plants	c
and	c
herbal	c
things	c
than	i
chemical	c
one	i
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
people	c
want	c
to	c
wear	c
special	c
and	c
original	c
clothes	c
to	c
show	c
their	c
own	c
characters	c
.	c

Also	c
countless	c
fashion	i
will	c
be	c
shown	i
.	c

People	c
will	c
prefer	c
to	c
use	c
more	c
natural	c
than	c
chemical	c
things	c
and	c
wear	c
more	c
beautiful	c
and	c
attractive	c
clothes	c
.	c

I	c
ca	i
n't	i
stand	c
wearing	c
a	c
suit	c
or	c
kit	c
like	c
which	i
has	c
been	c
showed	i
in	c
Starwars	c
!	c

Although	i
,	c
this	c
musical	c
show	i
was	c
not	c
as	c
good	c
as	c
I	c
expected	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
was	i
the	i
show	i
suppossed	i
to	c
start	c
at	c
19.30	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
started	c
first	i
at	c
20.15	c
.	c

To	c
make	c
matters	c
worse	c
,	c
instead	c
of	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
performing	c
you	c
had	c
another	c
actor	c
,	c
which	c
was	c
very	c
disappointing	c
.	c

On	c
top	c
of	c
everything	c
,	c
you	c
recommended	c
to	i
visit	i
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

According	c
to	c
your	c
brochure	c
it	i
says	i
this	c
would	c
be	c
the	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
.	c

According	i
to	i
my	c
experience	c
it	i
was	c
not	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
expecting	c
a	c
full	c
refund	c
and	c
compensation	c
for	c
the	c
discomfort	c
I	c
have	c
suffered	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
foward	i
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Fashion	c
of	c
the	c
future	c
.	c

Designers	c
are	c
improving	c
their	c
skills	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
.	c

Nowadays	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
more	c
and	c
more	c
people	c
who	c
wants	i
to	c
become	c
designers	c
and	c
the	c
competion	i
is	c
increasing	c
.	c

Everybody	c
wants	c
to	c
be	c
the	c
best	c
.	c

Due	c
to	c
this	c
the	c
quality	c
of	c
clothes	c
is	c
getting	c
better	c
and	c
in	c
100	c
years	c
we	c
will	c
be	c
asking	c
for	c
a	c
bigger	i
variety	c
of	c
clothes	c
.	c

Although	c
,	c
the	c
price	c
of	c
clothes	c
is	c
increasing	c
,	c
people	c
still	c
buy	c
them	c
.	c

We	c
give	c
other	c
things	c
priority	c
so	c
we	c
are	c
able	c
to	c
afford	c
our	c
clothes	c
.	c

It	c
appears	c
that	c
people	c
are	c
more	c
aware	c
about	c
clothes	c
and	c
also	c
work	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
people	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
will	c
begin	c
to	c
only	i
wear	i
fashionable	c
clothes	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
the	c
prize	c
two	i
weeks	c
at	c
Camp	c

On	i
the	c
following	c
there	c
is	c
some	c
further	c

from	c

I	c
do	c
not	c

I	c
have	c
enough	c
time	c
to	c
prepare	c
somethings	i
to	c
travel	c
before	c
of	i
July	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
choose	c
tennis	c
and	c
swimming	c

Dear	c
Kim	c

How	c
are	c
you	c
?	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
have	i
a	c
nice	c
summer	i
time	i
now	c
.	c

I	c
wondered	c
who	c
had	c
told	c
you	c
about	i
I	c
had	i
helped	i
a	i
pop	c
concert	c
last	c
month	c
.	c

Anyway	c
,	c
it	c
is	i
does	c
n't	c
matter	c
now	c
who	c
had	i
told	i
you	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
happy	c
and	c
enjoyed	c
it	c
.	c

Well	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
going	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
about	c
it	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
been	i
train	i
by	c
the	c
concert	i
's	i
staff	c
for	c
a	c
day	c
.	c

Before	c
the	c
concert	c
started	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
help	c
the	c
staff	c
prepared	i
a	c
stage	c
,	c
like	i
put	i
the	c
instruments	c
where	c
they	c
should	c
be	c
on	c
the	c
stage	c
,	i
.	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
frightening	i
I	c
might	c
put	c
too	c
much	c
make	i
up	i
on	c
their	c
faces	c
,	c
but	c
everything	c
was	c
allright	i
.	c

After	c
that	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
help	c
them	c
to	c
prepare	c
some	c
lunch	c
when	c
the	c
concert	c
had	i
started	i
.	c

After	c
the	c
concert	c
finished	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
help	c
them	c
cleaned	i
up	c
everything	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
so	c
tired	c
,	c
but	c
enjoyed	i
.	c

I	c
really	c
like	c
to	c
help	c
people	c
without	c
something	i
back	c
.	c

This	i
experience	i
I	i
was	i
so	i
prond	i
and	c
very	c
enjoyed	i
.	c

I	i
think	i
I	i
did	i
n't	i
waste	i
my	c
time	c
at	c
all	c
.	c

I	c
spent	c
my	c
free	c
time	c
to	i
helping	c
them	c
its	i
made	i
my	c
life	c
a	c
little	c
bit	c
busy	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
I	c
have	c
learnt	c
a	c
lot	c
from	c
this	c
experience	c
.	c

Well	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
I	c
must	c
stop	c
writing	c
now	c
.	c

Your	c
letter	c
which	c
says	c
I	c
won	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
has	c
just	c
been	i
arrived	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
making	c
my	c
dreams	c
real	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
answer	c
your	c
questions	c
about	c
this	c
trip	c
.	c

Before	i
everything	i
,	c
I	c
'm	c
living	c
in	c
Leeds	c
and	c
also	c
studying	c
English	c
in	i
a	c
college	c
.	c

Before	c
this	i
time	i
,	c
I	c
usually	i
stay	i
in	c
log	c
cabins	c
,	c
But	i
I	c
never	i
had	i
chance	i
for	i
staying	i
in	c
a	c
tent	c
.	c

According	i
to	i
me	i
,	c
to	i
say	i
in	c
the	i
tents	c
is	c
mor	i
exciting	c
than	c
to	i
stay	i
in	c
the	i
log	c
cabins	c
.	c

That	c
's	c
why	c
,	i
I	c
would	c
love	c
to	i
choose	i
tents	i
for	i
living	i
for	i
2	i
weeks	i
!	c

On	i
the	i
other	i
hand	i
,	c
I	c
've	c
just	c
learnt	c
from	c
your	c
letter	c
that	c
I	c
can	c
have	i
some	c
sport	i
activities	c
during	c
the	c
camp	c
.	c

Because	c
,	i
I	c
spent	c
most	c
of	c
my	c
scholl	i
life	c
for	i
sports	c
,	c
specially	i
for	i
basketball	c
.	c

When	c
I	i
'm	i
coming	i
,	c
what	c
king	i
of	c
clothes	c
could	i
be	i
able	c
to	c
wear	c
in	i
there	c
?	c

And	c
also	c
,	c
what	i
do	i
you	i
think	i
how	i
much	i
money	i
,	i
I	c
'll	c
need	c
to	i

Dear	c

As	c
you	c

I	c
was	c
there	c
to	c
help	c
for	i
the	c
good	i
running	c
of	c
the	c
concert	c
and	c
there	c
was	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
different	c
things	c
to	c
do	c
.	c

First	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
to	i
control	i
the	c
tickets	c
at	c
the	c
entry	i
.	c

In	c
addition	c
,	c
there	c
were	c
some	c
VIP	i
's	i

Then	c

very	c
important	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
the	c
above	c
I	c

anything	c
longer	c

1	c

2	c
minuts	i

have	i
a	c

Dear	c
Miss/Mrs	c

I	c
have	c
just	c
received	c
the	c
excellent	c
news	c
about	c
the	c
prize	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
all	c
the	c
details	c
you	c
need	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
only	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
,	c
as	c
it	c
is	c
then	c
when	i
I	c
get	i
my	i
holiday	c
from	c
my	c
present	c
job	c
.	c

About	c
the	c
activities	c
I	c
can	c
choose	c
from	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
be	c
delighted	c
if	c
I	c
could	c
sing	c
,	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
something	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
always	c
loved	c
and	c
,	c
although	c
perhaps	c
I	c
should	c
not	c
say	c
that	i
myself	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
I	c
have	c
a	c
nice	c
voice	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
also	c
very	c
fond	c
of	c
photography	c
,	c
so	c
when	c
I	c
have	i
seen	i
that	c
it	c
is	c
among	c
your	c
options	c
it	c
has	i
been	i
a	c
wonderful	c
surprise	c
.	c

Thanks	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
your	c
last	c
letter	c
.	c

When	c
we	c
arrived	c
there	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
prepare	c
the	c
stage	c
,	c
clean	c
everything	c
and	c
put	c
a	c
number	c
on	c
each	c
seat	c
.	c

For	c
a	c
while	c
I	c
thought	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
dream	c
.	c

I	c
even	c
got	c
a	c
few	c
friendly	c
words	c
from	c
the	c
singer	c
in	i
a	c
piece	c
of	c
paper	c
:	c
I	c
hope	c
you	c
've	c
enjoyed	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
'll	c
show	c
you	c
the	c
photographs	c
I	c
took	c
next	c
time	c
you	c
come	c
to	c
visit	c
me	c
,	c
O.K	i

Love	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
:	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
in	i
the	c
ticket	c
for	i
entrance	i
says	i
that	c
the	c
actor	c
was	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
realy	i
he	c
was	c
not	c
.	c

I	c
thought	c
you	c
were	c
a	c
good	c
theatre	c
,	c
were	i
people	c
can	c
go	c
and	c
have	c
a	c
good	c
evening	c
alone	c
or	c
with	c
somebody	c
else	c
,	c
but	c
realy	i
I	c
am	c
very	c
disappointed	c
and	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
ask	c
for	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

Please	c
,	c
let	c
me	c
know	c
your	c
answer	c
.	c

We	c
work	i
all	i
separated	i
,	c
making	i
grow	i
the	i
individuality	i
and	c
forgoten	i
we	c
has	i
to	c
talk	i
all	i
together	c
to	c
know	c
about	c
the	i
other	c
's	c
life	c
.	c

The	i
comunications	i
in	i
the	c
world	c
are	i
faster	c
than	c
ever	c
,	c
so	c
when	c
I	c
need	c
something	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
have	c
it	c
in	c
only	c
a	c
minute	c
.	c

It	c
allowed	i
me	c
to	c
worry	c
about	c
other	c
things	c
of	i
the	i
life	c
.	c

To	c
finish	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
say	c
technology	c
has	c
changed	c
my	c
life	c
in	c
good	c
and	c
bad	c
ways	c
,	c
helping	c
the	i
things	c
be	i
easier	c
but	c
making	c
me	c
develop	i
a	i
big	i
independence	i
.	c

Dear	c
Helen	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
as	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
on	c
traineeship	i
in	c
August	c
,	c
I	c
hope	c
this	c
could	i
occur	c
in	c
July	c
.	c

Besides	i
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
staying	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
.	c

It	c
provides	i
me	c
a	c
feeling	c
of	c
adventure	c
which	i
is	c
very	c
exciting	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
also	c
very	c
glad	c
to	c
see	c
such	c
a	c
variety	c
of	c
activities	c
at	i
the	c
camp	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
quite	c
difficult	c
to	c
say	c
wether	i
I	c
prefer	c
painting	c
or	c
sailing	c
.	c

Will	c
I	c
have	c
the	c
opportunity	c
to	c
visit	c
San	c
Franscico	c
or	c
Los	c
Angles	c
?	c

Yours	c
Sincerely	i

Cloutier	c

Daily	c
life	c
at	c
school	c
:	c

What	c
should	c
be	c
filmed	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
lay	c
the	c
emphasis	c
on	c
the	c
fact	c
that	c
this	c
report	c
can	c
be	c
seen	c
by	c
the	c
director	i
of	i
the	i
school	i
.	c

Therefore	c
it	c
must	c
be	c
objective	c
.	c

Then	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
film	c
the	c
computer	c
rooms	c
.	c

Eventually	i
,	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
nice	c
to	c
make	i
a	c
sequence	c
with	c
lots	c
of	c
sports	c
activities	c
.	c

It	c
would	c
bring	c
some	c
rhythm	c
to	c
the	c
video	c
.	c

Moreover	c
it	c
will	c
show	i
of	i
healthy	i
the	c
students	c
are	c
.	c

These	c
are	c
some	c
ideas	c
we	c
could	c
discuss	c
over	i
.	c

We	c
had	c
a	c
very	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
yesterday	c
.	c

We	c
thought	c
that	c
we	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
let	c
you	c
know	c
all	c
details	i
which	i
it	i
did	i
n't	i
make	i
us	i
happy	i
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
we	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
theather	i
to	c
pick	c
up	c
our	c
tickets	c
.	c

We	c
were	c
thinking	c
to	i
get	i
some	i
discount	c
on	c
our	c
tickets	c
,	c
because	c
we	c
had	c
already	i
read	c
from	i
the	c
advertisement	c
but	c
they	c
did	c
n't	c
discount	c
the	c
prices	c
so	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
pay	c
complete	i
money	i
for	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

We	c
were	c
ready	c
for	c
the	c
show	c
at	c
19.30	c
.	c

We	c
waited	c
for	c
45	c
minutes	c
.	c

I	c
realised	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
different	i
actor	c
playing	c
instead	c
of	c
Danny	c
brook	i
.	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
disappointed	c
.	c

They	c
just	c
said	c
,	c
"	c
we	i
do	c
n't	c
give	c
money	c
back.	c
"	c

However	i
we	c
wanted	c
to	c
eat	c
something	c
at	c
the	c
Theatre	c
Restaurant	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
again	i
same	i
with	i
the	i
others	i
,	c
because	c
the	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
we	c
had	c
a	c
totally	c
unhappy	i
night	c
with	i
your	c
show	c
.	c

You	c
ca	c
n't	c
take	c
this	c
bad	c
feeling	c
back	i
but	c
you	c
might	c
give	c
us	c
our	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

We	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

In	c
the	c
twenty	i
first	i
century	c
things	i
are	c
changing	c
very	c
fast	c
.	c

If	c
we	c
look	c
at	c
a	i
family	c
life	c
.	c

Children	c
have	c
own	i
televisions	c
,	c
computers	c
and	c
telephones	c
in	c
their	c
room	c
.	c

Full	i
of	i
technological	i
tools	i
and	i
instruments	i
in	i
the	i
house	i
.	c

Fire	c
alarm	c
,	c
burglar	c
alarm	c
,	c
house	c
temperature	c
checker	i
,	c
automatic	c
garage	c
door	c
many	i
of	i
them	i
.	c

In	i
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
thy	i
use	c
all	c
this	c
too	c
much	c
.	c

Just	i
wersting	i
time	c
on	c
it	c
.	c

It	c
developes	i
day	c
by	c
day	c
.	c

The	c
problem	c
is	c
"	i
Do	i
we	c
really	c
use	c
it	c
properly	c
or	c
not	c
?	c
"	i

I	c
am	c
writing	c
this	c
letter	c
to	c
inform	c
you	c
that	c
the	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
was	i
with	c
wrong	c
information	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
the	c
actors	c
were	c
different	c
from	c
the	c
ones	c
written	i
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
which	i
was	c
very	c
disappointing	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
according	c
to	c
the	c
advertisement	c
I	i
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
begin	c
at	c
14.30	c
and	c
19.30	c
but	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
20.15	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
when	c
I	c
bought	c
the	c
tickets	c
I	c
was	c
expecting	c
discounts	c
available	i
,	c
however	c
,	c
there	c
were	c
no	c
discounts	c
available	c
and	c
the	c
tickets	c
were	c
more	c
expensive	c
than	c
the	c
price	c
written	i
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c
.	c

How	c
has	c
modern	c
technology	c
changed	c
your	c
daily	c
life	c
?	c

Firstly	c
,	c
we	c
can	c
cook	c
our	c
meals	c
an	i
electrical	c
stove	c
or	c
in	c
a	c
microwave	c
and	c
it	c
takes	c
just	c
a	c
few	c
minutes	c
to	c
get	c
ready	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
the	i
doctors	c
have	c
found	c
the	c
cure	c
for	c
many	c
diseases	c
and	c
many	c
operations	c
have	c
been	c
done	c
in	c
less	c
time	c
and	c
in	c
a	c
painless	c
way	c
,	i
by	i
using	c
especial	i
machines	c
doctors	c
have	c
be	i
able	c
to	c
save	c
more	c
lives	c
than	c
in	c
the	c
past	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
surprised	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
keen	c
on	c
in	i
summer	c
.	c

As	c
can	c
be	c
seen	c
from	c
your	c
letter	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
choose	c
Accommodation	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
play	c
Basketball	c
and	c
Golf	c
.	c

Both	i
of	i
them	i
I	i
am	i
not	i
as	i
good	i
as	i
you	i
expect	i
,	i
but	c
recently	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
intrested	i
in	c
those	i
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
some	c
question	i
such	c
as	c
clothes	i
and	c
money	c
.	c

What	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
are	c
much	i
to	i
the	i
camp	i
?	c

How	c
have	c
you	c
been	c
doing	c
recently	c
.	i

One	c
of	c
my	c
friends	c
suggested	c
that	c
we	c
should	c
have	c
had	i
part	i
time	i
job	c
which	i
was	c
that	c
.	c

Both	c
of	c
us	c
are	c
keen	c
on	c
pop	c
music	c
.	c

It	c
must	c
have	c
been	c
hot	c
.	c

Howeve	i
,	c
we	c
decided	c
to	c
have	c
the	c
job	c
,	c
because	c
of	c
good	c
money	c
.	c

Howeve	i
it	i
was	c
great	i
job	c
I	i
have	c
n't	c
hade	c
such	c
experience	i
.	i

Can	c
you	c
believe	c
that	c

I	c
must	c
sign	c
off	c
as	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
catch	c
the	c
post	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c

I	c
recently	c
went	c
there	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
.	c

Instead	c
,	c
there	c
was	c
this	c
unknown	c
actor	c
with	i
a	c
very	c
bad	c
performance	c
and	c
a	i
terribly	c
annoying	c
voice	c
.	c

All	c
the	c
waiting	c
made	c
me	c
quite	c
hungry	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
was	c
expecting	c
to	c
have	c
good	c
meal	c
at	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
for	c
cleaning	c
.	c

The	c
New	c
Modern	c
Life	c

The	i
easy	i
access	c
to	c
information	c
and	c
the	c
new	c
ways	c
of	c
communicating	c
with	c
other	c
people	c
help	c
me	c
save	c
time	c
that	c
I	c
can	c
spend	c
doing	c
whatever	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
.	c

It	c
provides	c
you	c
all	i
the	c
information	c
you	c
want	c
.	c

Mobile	c
phones	c
are	c
another	c
thing	c
that	c
is	i
making	c
my	c
life	c
much	c
easier	c
.	c

This	c
can	c
be	c
very	c
useful	c
when	c
you	c
have	c
a	c
problem	c
that	c
needs	c
an	c
immediate	c
solution	c
.	c

I	c
get	c
to	c
rest	c
more	c
and	c
spend	c
more	c
time	c
at	c
home	c
,	c
and	c
so	c
they	c
make	c
me	c
a	c
happier	c
person	c
.	c

Dear	c
Helen	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
would	i
be	c
a	c
very	c
good	c
experience	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

Actually	c
,	c
I	c
'd	c
prefer	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
'm	c
working	c
at	c
the	c
moment	c
,	i
in	i
a	c
company	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
'll	c
only	c
have	c
two	c
weeks	c
off	c
in	i
the	c
period	c
between	c
the	c
fifteenth	c
and	c
the	c
thirtieth	c
of	c
July	c
.	c

I	c
will	i
also	c
appreciate	c
,	i
if	c
you	c
would	c
offer	c
me	c
accomodation	i
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
,	c
because	c
of	c
some	c
health	c
problems	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
,	c
which	c
are	i
not	c
allow	c
me	c
to	c
leave	i
outsid	i
on	c
the	c
ground	c
,	c
and	c
to	c
be	c
honest	c
with	c
you	c
,	c
I	c
never	c
liked	c
camping	c
.	c

That	c
is	c
my	c
worst	c
nightmare	c
.	c

I	c
never	c
go	c
shopping	c
with	c
women	c
and	i
especially	c
with	c
my	c
mother	c
or	c
my	c
sisters	c
.	c

And	c
that	c
's	c
because	c
they	c
spend	c
hours	c
trying	c
on	c
any	i
kind	i
of	c
clothes	c
,	c
everything	c
you	c
can	c
imagine	c
,	c
and	c
at	c
the	c
end	c
they	c
are	i
not	c
buying	i
anything	c
.	c

They	c
also	c
like	c
going	c
to	c
loads	c
of	c
shops	c
,	c
in	c
different	c
parts	c
of	c
the	c
city	c
.	c

At	c
the	c
end	c
I	c
feel	c
very	c
tired	c
and	c
angry	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
spent	i
the	c
whole	c
morning	c
doing	c
nothing	c
,	c
except	c
from	i
looking	c
at	c
them	c

clothes	c
,	c
and	c
that	c
's	c
not	c
enjoyable	c
at	c

in	c

it	c
's	c
realy	i
annoying	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
informing	c
me	c
I	i
've	c
won	c
the	c
prize	c
.	c

To	c
let	c
you	c
arrange	c
the	c
details	c
of	c
your	c
programe	i
,	c
I	c
'm	c
going	c
to	c
give	i
my	i
answers	i
to	i
you	i
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
I	c
've	c
already	c
resistered	i
another	i
summer	c
course	c
which	c
starts	c
in	i
the	c
end	c
of	c
July	c
.	c

And	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
choose	c
swimming	c
as	c
the	c
other	c
one	c
.	c

I	c
learned	c
swimming	c
at	c
my	i
age	c
of	c
8	c
for	c
5	c
years	c
and	c
I	c
still	c
love	c
swimming	c
.	c

Then	c
I	c
can	c
prepare	i
my	i
clothes	i
suitable	i
for	c
that	c
weather	c
.	c

Kyon	c
Chwa	c

All	c
the	c
students	c
in	c
my	c
class	c
are	c
excited	c
about	c
that	c
work	c
and	c
now	c
we	c
're	c
in	c
the	c
process	c
of	c
discussion	c
about	c
what	c
will	c
be	c
filmed	c
.	c

We	c
've	c
been	c
thinking	c
about	c
the	c
plot	c
,	c
at	c
first	c
,	c
and	c
we	c
decided	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
the	c
best	c
way	c
,	c
the	c
flow	c
of	c
time	c
.	c

The	c
lessons	c
we	c
have	c
in	c
the	c
morning	c
does	c
n't	c
attract	c
us	c
very	c
much	c
,	c
but	c
this	c
bit	c
will	c
show	c
you	c
routine	i
scenery	i
of	c
a	c
lesson	c
.	c

Spoken	c
English	c
lessons	c
which	c
is	i
in	c
the	c
afternoon	c
are	c
quite	c
interesting	c
.	c

After	c
the	c
class	c
is	c
also	c
very	i
essential	c
part	c
of	c
school	c
life	c
.	c

Because	c
we	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
pub	c
which	c
is	c
situated	c
near	c
to	c
the	c
school	c
quite	c
often	c
and	c
we	c
talk	c
more	c
about	c
personal	c
stories	c
that	c
make	c
us	c
closer	c
,	i
the	i
pub	c
after	c
the	c
lessons	c
will	c
be	c
interesting	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
allow	c
us	c
to	c
film	c
those	c
things	c
,	c
we	c
'll	c
be	c
very	c
happy	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
just	c
received	c
your	c
letter	c
and	c
I	c
'm	c
writing	c
back	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
how	c
much	i
it	i
made	i
me	i
happy	i
to	c
win	c
this	c
prize	c
and	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
the	c
answers	c
to	c
your	c
questions	c
.	c

Concerning	c
the	c
accomodation	i
,	c
I	c
prefer	c
to	c
live	i
in	c
log	c
cabins	c
finding	i
them	c
much	c
more	c
comfortable	c
than	c
tents	c
!	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
choose	c
singing	c
and	c
basketball	c
because	c
my	c
friends	c
say	c
I	c
'm	c
good	c
at	c
both	c
.	c

Singing	c
has	c
always	c
been	c
a	c
hobby	c
and	c
takes	i
an	c
important	c
part	c
in	c
my	c
life	c
.	c

Singing	c
relaxes	c
me	c
when	c
I	c
am	c
stressed	c
before	c
exams	c
or	c
competitions	c
.	c

Basketball	c
is	c
simply	c
my	c
favourite	c
sport	c
.	c

It	c
makes	c
me	c
feel	c
very	c
free	c
and	c
makes	c
me	c
forget	c
all	c
my	c
daily	c
problems	c
.	c

I	c
actually	c
have	c
won	c
a	c
basketball	c
prize	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
young	c
...	c
!	c

I	c
hope	c
I	c
have	c
n't	c
been	c
too	c
"	c
demanding	c
"	c
.	c

Making	c
a	c
short	c
video	c
about	c
daily	i
life	c
is	c
an	c
enjoyable	c
but	c
difficult	c
thing	c
to	c
do	c
.	c

We	c
would	i
concentrate	c
on	c
students	i
imagination	i
,	c
creation	i
and	c
talent	i
.	c

to	i
do	c
that	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
more	c
interesting	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
art	c
,	c
music	c
and	c
drama	c
classes	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
important	c
to	c
observe	c
students	i
attention	i
and	c
therefore	c
we	c
should	c
film	c
them	c
during	c
an	c
exam	c
(	c
but	c
only	c
for	c
a	c
short	c
period	c
of	c
time	c
)	c

The	c
cafeteria	c
is	c
an	c
interesting	c
place	c
to	c
go	c
because	c
one	c
can	c
see	c
if	c
students	c
respect	c
food	c
and	c
if	c
they	c
remain	c
polite	c
towards	c
each	c
other	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
important	c
to	c
remember	c
that	c
short	i
shots	i
should	c
be	c
taken	c
for	i
each	c
subject	c
.	c

Students	c
walking	c
and	c
talking	c
in	c
corridors	c
should	c
be	c
filmed	c
so	c
that	c
we	c
also	c
show	c
how	c
students	c
relax	c
between	c
two	c
lessons	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
these	i
are	i
the	c
best	c
advices	i
I	c
can	c
give	c
and	c
hope	c
that	c
one	i
understands	i
the	c
main	c
idea	c
which	i
is	c
to	c
concentrate	c
more	c
on	c
students	i
attitudes	c
than	c
on	c
lessons	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
James	c
,	c

This	c
looked	c
very	c
good	c
to	c
me	c
,	i
one	c
of	c
my	c
favourite	c
actors	c
,	c
the	c
time	c
did	i
suit	i
me	c
and	c
for	i
the	i
tickets	i
was	i
a	i
discount	i
available	i
.	c

Everything	c
was	c
just	c
perfect	c
.	c

Despite	c
of	i
this	c
we	c
have	i
still	c
been	i
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
the	c
show	c
and	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
.	c

The	c
other	c
thing	c
was	c
the	c
time	c
,	i
the	i
show	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
start	c
at	c
half	c
past	c
seven	c
,	c
but	c
we	c
have	i
been	i
waiting	i
for	c
45	c
minutes	c
,	c
before	c
the	c
light	c
turned	c
off	c
.	c

Eventually	i
,	c
the	c
restaurant	c
which	c
belongs	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

I	c
really	c
do	c
regret	c
that	c
I	c
told	c
Pat	c
about	c
my	c
feelings	c
for	c
the	c
new	c
girl	c
in	c
class	c
,	c
but	c
who	c
else	c
can	c
I	i
talk	c
to	c
,	i
if	c
it	c
is	c
not	c
your	c
best	c
friend	c
?	c
.	c

I	i
've	i
never	c
been	c
so	c
fascinated	c
by	c
a	c
girl	c
and	c
so	c
I	c
knew	c
it	c
must	c
have	c
been	c
real	c
love	c
.	c

Luckely	i
I	c
could	c
keep	c
my	c
secret	c
for	c
a	c
couple	c
of	c
days	c
but	c
then	c
,	i
it	c
became	c
urgent	c
and	c
I	c
needed	c
someone	c
to	c
talk	c
to	c
.	c

Pat	c
,	c
he	c
was	c
my	c
friend	c
,	c
and	c
he	c
knew	c
girls	c
.	c

I	c
thought	c
he	c
would	c
keep	c
everything	c
like	i
a	i
thing	i
between	c
him	c
and	c
me	c
,	c
but	c
he	c
disappointed	c
me	c
.	c

No	c
doubt	c
she	c
would	c
never	c
ever	c
look	c
at	c
me	c
again	c
.	c

There	c
are	c
two	c
Carlas	c
in	c
my	c
class	c
!	c

Dear	c
Mrs.	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
:	c

That	c
is	c
really	c
the	c
only	c
time	c
I	c
have	c
,	c
unfortunately	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
love	c
it	c
if	c
I	c
could	c
be	i
accommodated	i
in	c
a	c
tent	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
learning	c
how	c
to	c
take	c
care	c
of	c
myself	c
in	c
dangerous	c
situations	c
,	c
such	c
as	c
getting	c
lost	c
in	c
a	c
forest	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
being	i
in	c
a	c
tent	c
will	c
be	c
very	c
usefull	i
for	c
that	c
.	c

I	c
'd	c
also	c
like	c
to	c
get	c
in	c
touch	c
with	c
nature	c
,	c
and	c
that	c
is	i
a	c
great	c
way	c
.	i

I	c
have	c
sung	c
in	c
the	c
church	c
's	c
choir	c
for	c
three	c
years	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
had	c
singing	c
classes	c
at	c
school	c
since	c
first	c
grade	c
.	c

Yours	c
truthfully	i

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

The	c
Material	c
girl	c
's	c
the	c
sweetest	c
person	c
in	c
the	c
world	c
,	c
totally	c
unlike	c
the	i
media	c
says	c
.	i

Mo	c
'	c
told	c
me	c
everything	c
about	c
her	c
new	c
album	c
,	c
"	c
Music	c
"	c
,	c
and	c
how	c
the	c
single	c
with	i
the	c
same	c

had	c
slipped	c
into	i
the	c
Internet	c
in	c
the	c

Her	c
daughter	c
,	c
Lourdes	c
Maria	c
,	c
is	c
such	c
a	c
pretty	c
little	c
girl	c
,	i
that	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
take	c
my	c
eyes	c
off	c
of	c
her	c

Hope	c
you	c
enjoy	c
the	c
pictures	c

for	c
you	c

Benedito	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
share	c
with	c
you	c
some	c
feelings	c
I	c
have	c
after	c
watching	c
a	c
musical	c
show	c
,	i
which	c
was	c
played	i
at	c
The	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
last	c
week	c
.	c

The	c
advertisement	c
looked	c
pretty	c
interesting	c
and	c
I	c
dicided	i
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
to	c
watch	c
this	c
musical	c
show	c
.	c

Especialy	i
due	c
to	c
the	c
fact	c
that	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
see	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
-	c
my	c
favourite	c
actor	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
,	c
which	c
made	c
me	c
even	c
angier	i
.	c

There	c
was	c
no	c
information	c
why	i
it	c
was	c
closed	c
and	c
if	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
open	c
at	c
all	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

I	c
told	c
her	c
about	c
my	c
plans	c
on	c
Monday	c
,	i
however	i
on	i
Friday	c
almost	c
half	c
of	c
my	c
class	c
knew	c
what	i
's	i
going	c
on	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
the	c
only	c
boy	c
in	c
my	c
class	c
who	c
did	c
n't	c
have	c
a	c
driving	c
licence	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
Pat	i
was	c
there	c
and	c
half	c
of	c
my	c
class	c
.	c

I	c
felt	c
terrible	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
the	c
worst	c
time	c
I	c
ever	c
had	c
.	c

At	c
the	c
beginning	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
start	c
the	c
engine	c
.	c

It	c
made	c
my	i
crazy	c
.	c

I	c
started	c
doing	c
stupid	c
things	c
:	c
turn	i
right	c
instead	c
of	c
left	c
and	c
so	c
on	c
.	c

I	c
went	c
to	c
school	c
and	c
everyone	c
was	c
very	c
friendly	c
.	c

At	c
the	c
begining	i
I	c
was	c
very	c
angry	c
but	c
in	c
the	c
end	c
I	c
said	c
that	c
everything	c
is	i
O.K	c
.	c

We	c
are	c
good	c
friends	c
nowadays	c
,	i
however	i
I	i
will	c
never	c
tell	c
her	c
my	c
secrets	c
.	c

I	c
enjoyed	c
it	c
very	c
much	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
you	c
have	i
had	i
a	c
great	c
idea	c
.	c

I	c
liked	c
all	c
the	c
stars	c
and	c
the	c
artists	c
who	c
came	c
from	c
around	c
the	c
world	c
,	c
even	c
if	c
the	c
number	c
of	c
countries	c
was	c
very	c
little	i
,	c
only	c
six	c
.	c

I	c
also	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
dance	c
shows	c
,	c
the	c
art	c
exhibition	c
and	c
the	c
talks	c
by	c
writers	c
,	c
they	c
were	c
really	c
very	c
nice	c
and	c
interesting	c
.	c

I	c
also	c
agree	c
with	c
you	c
about	c
the	c
ticket	c
's	c
prize	i
.	c

And	c
that	c
's	c
the	c
reason	c
because	i
lots	c
of	c
people	c
came	c

Capua	c

16/12/2000	c

I	c
received	c
your	c
letter	c
yesterday	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
answer	c
you	c
soon	i
!	c

I	c
think	c
the	c
discussion	c
in	c
your	c
class	c
was	c
very	c
interesting	c
.	c

You	c
have	c
to	c
begin	c
your	c
lesson	c
at	c
8.25	c
and	c
wait	c
for	c
the	c
teacher	c
of	c
the	c
next	c
lesson	c
in	c
the	c
class	c
.	c

You	c
ca	c
n't	c
speak	c
during	c
the	c
lesson	c
or	c
outside	c
the	c
classrooms	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
some	c
rules	c
also	c
at	c
home	c
,	c
but	c
they	c
are	c
few	c
.	c

My	c
parents	c
are	c
afraid	c
of	c
it	c
because	c
I	c
took	i
my	i
licence	i
only	i
in	c
September	c
.	c

My	c
parents	c
also	c
like	c
eating	c
all	c
together	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
is	c
n't	c
a	c
rule	c
,	c
only	c
an	i
habitude	i
!	c

I	c
like	c
my	c
life	c
,	c
both	c
at	c
school	c
and	c
at	c
home	c
!	c

Write	c
to	c
me	c
soon	c

I	c
just	c
receive	i
your	c
letter	c
with	c
the	c
good	c
news	c
.	c

I	c
enjoy	c
swimming	c
and	c
singing	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
join	c
others	c
in	c
these	c
activities	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
an	c
average	c
swimmer	c
and	c
as	c
a	c
singer	c
I	c
am	c
not	c
a	c
start	i
but	i
it	c
would	c
be	c
fun	c
to	c
share	c
my	c
songs	c
with	c
the	c
holiday	c
makers	c
.	c

Can	c
you	c
please	c
give	c
me	c
some	c
recomendations	i
about	c
the	c
clothes	c
I	c
will	c
need	c
and	c
also	c
the	c
cost	c
of	c
the	c
food	c
there	c
to	c
make	i
my	c
budget	c
.	c

I	c
start	c
thinking	c
what	i
she	c
or	c
he	c
prefer	i
and	c
I	c
try	c
my	c
best	c
buying	i
something	c
apropiate	i
does	i
n't	i
matter	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
does	i
it	c
cost	i
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
45	c
minutes	c
late	c
.	c

If	c
there	c
was	i
someone	c
to	c
do	c
so	c
,	c
we	c
could	c
have	c
gone	c
out	c
to	c
eat	c
something	c
.	c

Then	c
,	c
as	c
we	c
were	c
told	c
that	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
begginning	i
,	c
the	c
second	c
shock	c
of	c
the	c
evening	c
faced	c
us	c
.	c

Instead	c
of	c
the	c
famous	c
actor	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
a	c
very	c
bad	c
and	c
disappointing	c
actor	c
showed	c
up	c
.	c

As	c
it	c
was	c
too	c
late	c
,	c
the	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
and	c
we	c
starved	c
till	c
we	c
got	c
to	c
our	c
homes	c
.	c

....	c

Knowing	c
that	c
he	i
decided	c
to	i
not	c
to	c
see	c
Alison	c
until	c
the	c
birthday	c
party	c
.	c

The	c
best	c
bakery	c
was	c
at	i
the	c
other	c
side	c
of	c
the	c
town	c
so	c
there	c
was	c
no	c
danger	c
for	i
him	c
to	i
see	i
Alison	c
and	c
reveal	i
the	c
party	c
.	c

He	c
went	c
out	c
of	c
his	c
house	c
and	c
got	c
on	c
his	c
bike	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
bakery	c
.	c

On	c
his	c
way	c
he	c
saw	c
lots	c
of	c
places	c
he	c
could	c
buy	i
the	c
birthday	c
cake	c
but	c
knowing	c
that	c
the	c
safest	c
one	c
was	c
the	c
one	c
which	c
is	i
as	i
andy	i
as	i
Alison	c
's	c
house	c
he	i
kept	c
on	c
riding	c
.	c

When	c
he	c
reached	c
the	c
bakery	c
,	c
he	c
was	c
quite	c
relieved	c
and	c
he	c
almost	c
forgot	c
that	c
he	c
had	c
a	c
secret	c
to	c
keep	c
.	c

He	c
suddenly	c
saw	c
Alison	c
and	c
said	c
"	c
Did	i
you	c
like	c
the	c
cake	c
,	i
it	i
's	i
for	c
your	c
birthday	c
party	c
"	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c

But	c
,	c
Yes	c
.	c

Yes	c
,	c
45	c
minutes	c
,	i
I	c
want	c
to	c
see	c
you	c
in	c
that	c
case	i
.	c

What	c
would	c
you	c
do	c
?	c

More	c
than	c
that	c
,	c
the	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
on	i
repairing	i
.	c

At	i
end	i
,	c
I	c
could	c
see	c
that	c
the	c
advertisement	c
said	c
"	i
Your	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
"	c
,	i
it	i
was	c
n't	c
the	c
perfect	c
evening	c
,	i
now	i
I	c
'm	c
looking	c
for	c
a	c
layer	i
,	c
because	c
I	c
want	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
,	c
if	i
do	i
n't	i
well	i
you	i
know	i
the	i
end	i
of	i
this	i
story	i
.	c

Faithfully	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
,	c
because	c
one	c
day	c
when	c
Maria	c
,	c
her	c
sister	c
,	c
was	c
walking	c
to	c
the	i
school	c
,	c
a	c
car	c
stopped	c
at	i
her	c
and	c
a	c
man	c
said	c
"	i
I	c
know	c
who	c
is	c
your	c
love	i
,	c
it	c
's	c
Peter	c
"	c
.	c

But	c
the	c
problem	c
began	c
to	c
increase	i
because	c
all	c
her	c
friends	c
knew	c
her	c
secret	c
.	c

In	c
the	c

future	c
we	c
will	c
be	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
really	c
surprised	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
.	c

I	c
have	i
not	c
expect	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
used	c
to	c
be	c
a	c
scout	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
to	i
questions	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
which	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
should	c
take	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
your	c
opinion	c
how	i
much	c
money	c
I	c
should	c
take	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
onc	i
again	c
for	c
this	c
great	c
opportiunity	i
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

We	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
belive	i
that	c
shopping	c
is	c
the	c
most	c
wonderful	c
part	c
of	c
our	c
life	c
.	c

After	c
working	c
all	c
week	c
,	c
finally	c
on	c
Saturday	c
we	c
can	c
do	i
shopping	c
.	c

Problems	c
start	c
when	c
we	c
cannot	c
find	c
any	c
space	c
to	c
park	c
our	c
car	c
.	c

When	c
we	c
finally	c
do	c
this	c
,	c
we	c
cannot	c
go	i
confortable	i
because	c
of	c
crowd	i
.	c

The	c
answer	c
is	c
that	c
we	c
choose	c
the	c
same	c
street	c
(	c
usually	c
the	c
most	c
popular	c
)	c
and	c
the	c
same	c
time	c
as	c
six	c
hundrets	i
other	c
people	c
.	c

We	c
become	c
customers	c
who	c
want	c
to	c
do	c
their	c
shopping	c
with	c
pleasure	c

A	i
least	i
suggestion	c
for	c
next	c
year	c
's	c
festival	c
is	c
to	c
invite	c
some	c
"	c
salsa	c
"	c
band	i
,	i
It	c
would	c
be	c
great	c
to	c
listen	c
and	c
dance	c
in	i
the	c
same	c
time	c
"	i
salsa	c
"	c
music	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
happy	c
to	c
receive	c
a	c
letter	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

But	c
,	i
I	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
the	c
same	c
in	c
England	c
.	c

But	c
there	c
are	c
also	c
some	c
life	i
's	i
rules	c
,	c
like	c
do	c
not	c
put	c
legs	i
on	c
the	c
table	c
when	c
we	c
are	c
eating	c
or	c
eat	i
with	c
my	i
fingers	c
.	c

There	c
are	i
not	c
really	c
anything	c
that	c
I	c
could	i
like	c
to	c
change	c
,	c
because	c
,	c
as	c
you	c
know	c
,	c
in	c
France	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
not	c
really	c
strict	c
rules	c
like	c
in	c
China	c
or	c
other	c
countries	c
.	c

Dear	c
Ms	c
Clark	c
,	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
express	i
a	c
couple	c
of	c
thoughts	c
that	c
I	c
have	i
after	c
the	c
festival	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
recently	c
seen	c
.	c

Especially	i
the	i
date	c
was	c
very	c
suitable	c
for	c
me	c
,	c
as	c
I	c
have	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
free	c
time	c
.	c

What	c
is	c
more	c
there	i
was	c
a	c
wide	c
vareiety	i
of	c
music	c
Although	i
the	c
artists	c
were	c
supposed	c
to	c
be	c
from	c
all	c
counties	i
,	c
there	c
were	c
only	c
six	c
nationalities	c
.	c

I	c
have	i
also	i
one	c
suggestion	c
,	c
if	c
I	c
may	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Just	i
I	i
got	i
your	c
letter	c
and	c
sat	c
straight	i
away	c
to	c
write	i
you	i
a	i
few	i
sentences	i
that	c
will	c
illustrate	c
my	c
opinion	c
.	c

Although	c
we	c
have	c
to	c
change	c
our	c
boots	i
,	c
we	c
do	c
n't	c
need	c
to	c
wear	c
special	c
uniforms	c
.	c

Our	c
clothes	c
should	c
be	c
in	c
a	i
good	c
taste	c
.	c

We	c
are	c
also	c
allowed	c
to	c
have	c
jewellery	c
and	c
a	i
make-up	c
,	c
what	i
's	i
especially	c
crucial	i
for	c
girls	c
.	c

When	c
it	c
goes	i
to	c
my	c
home	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
I	c
have	c
usual	i
duties	c
I	i
have	c
to	c
clean	c
my	c
room	c
,	c
wash	c
the	c
dishes	c
or	c
vacuum	c
the	c
carpets	c
,	c
but	c
they	c
're	c
not	c
exhausting	c
things	c
,	c
as	c
I	c
share	c
them	c
with	c
my	c
sister	c
and	c
brother	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
that	c
will	c
be	c
everything	c
as	i
for	c
now	c
.	c

THERE	i
IS	i
GOING	i

14TH	c
OF	c
MARCH	c

FROM	c

TO	c

WE	c
THINK	c
IS	i
A	c
GRATE	i
OPORTUNITY	i
,	c
BECAUSE	c
AS	c
YOU	c
KNOW	c
,	c
WE	c

N'T	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Clark	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
with	c
reference	c
to	c
the	c
international	c
arts	c
festival	c
that	c
you	c
organise	c
every	c
year	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
express	c
my	c
opinion	c
about	c
it	c
and	c
give	c
you	c
some	c
suggestions	c
that	c
may	c
prove	c
to	c
be	c
useful	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
from	c
my	c
point	c
of	c
view	c
the	c
festival	c
itself	c
is	c
a	c
wonderful	c
idea	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
notice	i
that	c
the	c
festival	c
would	i
be	i
able	i
to	i
appeal	c
to	c
more	c
people	c
if	c
a	c
few	c
improvements	c
were	c
made	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
you	c
had	c
said	c
in	c
your	c
advertisement	c
that	c
artists	c
from	c
around	c
the	c
world	c
would	c
perform	c
.	c

What	c
is	c
more	c
,	c
some	c
concert	c
halls	c
were	c
too	c
small	c
.	c

As	c
a	c
result	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
impossible	c
for	c
al	i
the	c
audience	c
to	c
fit	c
in	c
there	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
suggest	c
you	c
should	i
think	c
about	c
giving	c
the	c
audience	c
the	c
opportunity	c
to	c
see	c
more	c
plays	c
and	c
films	c
.	c

Dear	c
Kathy	c
,	c

In	c
your	c
last	c
letter	c
you	i
wondered	c
what	c
the	c
rules	c
of	c
behaviour	c
at	c
school	c
and	c
at	c
home	c
are	c
like	c
in	c
my	c
country	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
'm	c
going	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
some	c
information	c
.	c

In	c
Poland	c
rules	i
that	c
refer	c
to	c
the	c
ways	i
of	i
being	i
dressed	i
at	c
school	c
are	c
n't	c
very	c
strict	c
;	c
we	c
do	c
n't	c
wear	c
any	c
uniforms	c
,	c
but	c
our	c
clothes	c
have	c
to	c
be	c
clean	c
and	c
nice	c
to	c
look	c
at	c
.	c

We	c
can	c
neither	c
eat	c
nor	c
drink	c
during	c
the	i
lessons	c
.	c

What	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
change	c
at	c
school	c
is	c
that	c
the	c
breaks	c
are	c
too	c
short	c
!	c

I	c
recently	c
went	c
to	c
London	c
on	c
vacation	c
,	c
with	c
some	c
friends	c
.	c

When	c
we	c
arrived	c
,	c
the	i
were	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
people	c
,	c
the	c
pace	i
was	c
beatiful	i
,	c
all	c
seemed	c
perfect	c
.	c

When	c
we	c
entrance	i
the	c
place	c
our	c
problems	c
begun	i
.	c

First	c
,	c
there	c
were	c
no	c
discount	i
on	c
the	c
tickets	c
but	c
that	c
was	c
fine	c
.	c

Then	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
had	c
a	c
great	c
delay	c
,	c
almost	c
an	c
hour	c
,	i
we	c
deal	i
with	c
that	c
too	c
.	c

After	c
that	c
they	c
changed	c
the	c
principal	c
actor	c
,	c
the	c
one	c
that	c
replaced	c
him	c
was	c
very	c
bad	c
,	c
that	c
made	c
us	c
realy	i
angry	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
that	c
you	c
understand	c
that	i
I	c
want	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
,	c
or	c
at	c
least	c
some	c
of	c
it	c
,	c
because	c
this	c
were	i
n't	i

How	c
has	c
moden	i
technology	c
changed	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c

Nowadays	c

is	c
everywhere	c

all	c
over	c
your	c

ofice	i
or	c
any	c
place	c
you	c
can	c

This	c
technology	c
has	c
help	i
to	c
made	i
my	c
life	c
easier	c
and	c
more	c
exciting	c
,	c
but	c
like	c
everithing	i

some	c
negative	c

Dear	c
Ms.	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
this	c
letter	c
to	c
express	c
my	c
thoughts	c
about	c
the	c
International	c
Art	c
Festival	c
of	c
this	c
year	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
so	c
impressed	c
the	i
exhibitions	c
of	i
the	c
festival	c
that	c
you	c
had	i
organized	i
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
it	c
is	i
better	c
to	c
invite	c
more	c
artists	c
not	i
only	i
from	i
six	i
countries	i
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
plays	c
and	c
films	c
were	c
shown	c
only	c
twice	c
a	c
day	c
so	c
that	c
people	c
had	i
gathered	i
one	i
time	i
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
regards	i
to	i
tickets	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
very	i
wonderful	c
idea	c
because	c

Yours	c
Sincerely	c

Long	i
long	c
time	c
ago	c
,	c
there	c
were	c
the	i
old	c
man	c
and	c
old	c
woman	c
lived	i
in	i
a	i
foot	c
of	c
mountain	i
.	c

One	c
day	c
,	c
when	c
the	c
old	c
man	c
went	c
into	c
the	c
bambo	i
bush	c
,	c
he	c
found	c
one	i
bambo	i
gritted	i
white	i
.	c

He	c
took	c
the	c
baby	c
to	c
his	c
house	c
and	c
explained	c
what	c
had	c
happened	c
in	c
the	c
bush	c
to	c
the	c
old	c
woman	c
.	c

The	c
baby	c
was	c
named	c
'	c
Kaguya	c
.	c
'	c

A	c
lot	c
of	c
men	c
asked	c
her	c
to	c
marry	c
with	i
them	c
but	c
she	c
always	c
refused	c
.	c

The	c
old	c
man	c
and	c
woman	c
tried	c
to	c
keep	i
her	c
staying	i
their	i
house	c
,	c
but	c
they	c
could	c
n't	c
.	c

The	i
servants	c
from	c
the	c
Moon	c
picked	i
her	c
up	c
to	c
the	c
Moon	c
.	c

This	c
story	i
happened	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
ago	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
poor	i
administrations	i
of	c
your	c
theatre	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
disappointed	c
because	c
I	c
was	c
longing	c
for	i
seeing	i
them	c
as	i
a	c
fan	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
,	c
when	c
I	c
entered	c
into	i
the	c
theatre	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
have	c
discount	i
in	c
spite	c
of	c
student	i
and	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
use	c
in	i
your	c
restaurant	c
either	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

In	i
that	c
time	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
it	c
had	c
been	c
being	c
repaired	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c

How	c
has	c
modern	c
technology	c
changed	c
our	c
daily	c
life	c
?	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
the	c
developed	c
technology	c
and	c
science	c
will	c
make	c
our	c
life	c
more	c
convenient	c
than	c
now	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
if	c
you	c
watch	c
"	c
The	c
Star	c
Trek	c
"	c
-	c
science	c
fiction	c
programme	c
on	c
TV	c
,	c
you	c
will	c
realise	c
that	c
you	c
just	i
can	i
say	c
"	c
Do	c
it	c
"	c
and	c
then	c
the	c
computers	c
will	c
do	c
it	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
some	c
problems	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
we	c
have	c
to	c
consider	c
about	i
our	c
nature	i
.	c

As	c
you	c
know	c
,	c
even	c
now	c
,	c
science	c
and	c
technology	c
are	c
destroying	c
our	c
environment	c
,	c
for	c
example	c
weird	c
temperature	c
etc.	c
If	c
we	c
do	c
n't	c
protect	c
our	c
environment	c
,	c
our	c
daily	c
life	c
will	c
not	c
be	c
convenient	c
.	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
future	c
civilization	c
is	c
important	c
for	c
us	c
.	c

If	c
there	c
is	c
no	i
our	i
good	i
nature	i
,	i
our	c
daily	c
life	c
will	c
be	c
unhappy	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
really	c
disappointed	c
therefore	c
I	c
am	c
writing	c
a	c
complain	i
.	c

Also	c
the	i
person	c
was	c
not	c
really	c
good	c
at	c
acting	c
.	c

Secondly	c
the	c
time	c
on	c
the	c
leaflet	c
is	c
totaly	i
wrong	c
.	c

It	c
said	c
it	c
will	i
start	c
at	c
19:30	c
.	c

Infact	i
it	c
started	c
t	i
20:15	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
waiting	c
for	c
45	c
minuts	i
.	c

Thirdly	c
the	c
ticket	c
was	c
no	i
discount	i
and	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
I	c
visited	c
theater	i
restaurant	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
close	i
because	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
too	i
late	c
.	c

(	i
Therefore	i
)	i
I	c
want	c
to	c
have	c
money	i
back	c
and	c
I	c
hope	c
you	c
will	c
think	c
about	c
these	c
problems	c
.	c

But	c
when	c
I	c
heard	i
the	c
word	c
of	i
future	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
image	i
of	c
metalic	i
colour	i
so	c
that	c
my	i
imagination	c
they	c
are	c
wearing	c
metalic	i
or	c
bright	i
colour	i
cloth	i
.	c

The	i
mean	i
of	i
this	i
is	c
all	c
our	c
fashion	i
styles	i
come	c
from	c
history	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
the	i
people	c
will	c
wear	c
clothes	c
which	c
are	c
metalic	i
or	c
bright	i
colourful	i
colour	i
with	i
mixture	i
of	i
history	i
and	i
future	i
fashion	i
style	i
.	i

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
.	i

Firstly	c
I	i
must	c
say	c
that	c
I	c
'll	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
have	c
two	c
weeks	c
free	c
only	c
in	c
July	c
,	c
since	c
I	c
started	i
work	c
and	c
intitled	i
to	c
have	c
a	c
holiday	c
only	c
in	c
July	c
.	c

Despite	c
my	c
appriciation	i
of	c
all	c
kinds	c
of	c
sports	c
and	c
activities	c
,	c
I	i
'd	i
choose	i
my	c
favourite	c
ones	c
,	c
which	c
are	c
swimming	c
and	c
tennis	c
.	c

In	i
the	i
conclusion	i
I	i
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
if	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
take	c
some	c
money	c
with	c
me	c
and	c
how	c
much	c
?	i

Probably	c
summer	c
clothes	c
mostly	c
?	c

There	c
are	c
always	c
too	c
many	c
people	c
there	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
it	c
takes	c
too	c
long	c
to	c
find	c
something	c
you	c
need	c
in	c
unfamiliar	c
stores	c
.	c

Sometimes	c
I	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
local	c
market	c
,	c
but	c
not	c
on	c
my	c
own	c
.	c

Another	c
thing	c
I	c
dislike	c
about	c
shopping	c
is	c
some	c
annoying	c
shop	c
assisstants	i
which	i
try	c
to	c
sale	i
any	c
products	i
to	c
the	c
"	c
victim	c
"	c
entring	i
the	c
door	c
.	c

Otherwise	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
so	c
bad	c
,	c
as	c
you	c
get	c
what	c
you	c
want	c
in	c
the	c
end	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
happy	c
to	c
receive	c
it	c
.	c

Of	c
course	c
I	c
will	c
able	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
Camp	c
California	c
in	c
the	c
U.S.A.	c
However	c
,	c
I	c
only	i
will	i
able	i
to	c
go	c
to	c
there	c
on	i
July	c
2001	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
a	c
job	c
which	c
is	c
extreme	i
busy	c
work	c
.	c

Our	c
department	c
,	c
which	c
is	c
sales	i
department	c
,	c
have	c
to	c
make	c
good	c
sales	c
result	i
befor	i
end	i
of	c
June	c
because	c
of	c
financial	i
month	c
.	c

I	c
used	c
to	c
play	c
tennis	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
university	i
student	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
interst	i
playing	i
tennis	c
very	c
much	c
.	c

Finaly	i
,	c
I	c
have	c
some	c
question	i
.	c

Please	c
reply	c
for	i
me	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c

Hello	c
Kim	c
.	c

How	c
are	c
you	c
?	c

I	c
could	c
enjoy	c
helping	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
in	i
last	c
week	c
which	c
is	c
"	c
The	c
Max	c
"	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
know	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
big	i
fun	i
with	i
"	c
The	c
Max	c
"	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
got	c
good	c
experience	c
and	c
fantastic	c
memory	i
.	c

At	c
the	c
same	c
time	c
I	i
have	c
got	c
a	c
small	c
money	i
but	i
it	c
was	c
not	c
important	c
for	i
me	c
.	c

I	c
've	c
just	c
helped	c
for	i
staff	i
.	c

When	c
I	c
was	c
university	i
student	c
,	c
I	c
studied	c
sound	c
effect	i
but	i
I	c
hae	i
n't	i
used	c
effect	c
equepument	i
whole	i
my	i
life	c
because	c
our	c
school	c
dose	i
n't	i
have	c
it	c
.	c

At	c
first	c
I	i
could	c
n't	c
understand	c
this	c
system	c
but	c
our	c
staff	c
was	i
very	c
kind	c
people	c
.	c

They	c
teached	i
me	c
paticulaly	i
.	c

After	c
that	c
I	i
was	c
able	c
to	c
understand	c
this	c
system	c
,	c
time	c
after	c
time	c
.	c

Now	c
,	c
I	c
able	i
to	c
use	c
sound	i
effect	c
system	c
.	c

Take	c
care	c
of	c
youself	i
.	c

Your	i
sincerely	i
,	i

Hellow	i
!	c

I'am	i
very	c
pleased	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
and	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
that	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
better	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
your	c
Camp	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
this	i
month	c
I	c
usually	c
have	c
a	c
rest	c
and	c
now	c
I	c
am	c
thinking	c
about	c
it	c
.	c

So	c
your	c
advice	c
of	i
going	c
to	c
a	c
camp	c
suits	c
me	c
very	c
well	c
.	c

From	c
your	c
list	c
of	c
activities	c
I	c
have	c
chosen	c
swimming	c
and	c
surfing	c
,	c
because	c
all	c
of	c
us	c
went	i
out	c
from	c
water	i
and	c
we	c
have	c
to	c
go	c
back	c
there	c
.	c

Of	c
course	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
joke	c
,	c
but	c
as	c
I	c
have	c
chosen	c
swimming	c
and	c
surfing	c
I	c
will	c
tell	c
you	c
why	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
chosen	c
them	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
candidat	i
to	i
masters	c
of	i
sports	c
in	c
water	c
polo	c
.	c

Also	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
t-shirt	c
with	c
your	c
signature	i
.	c

As	c
a	c
student	c
of	i
economical	i
form	c
I	c
think	c
I	c
should	c
tell	c
you	c
about	c
one	c
day	c
in	c
time	i
table	i
of	c
our	c
form	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
Tuesday	c
.	c

Especially	c
English	c
and	c
Economics	c
because	c
we	c
are	c
going	c
to	c
become	c
famous	c
economists	c
.	c

International	c
Arts	c
Festival	c

Dear	c
Jane	c
Clark	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
student	i
at	c
London	c
College	c
and	i
studying	c
English	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
,	i
you	c
will	c
concider	i
about	i
my	c
opinions	c
and	c
my	i
suggestions	c
would	i
be	c
helpful	c
for	c
the	i
next	c
year	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
very	c
nice	c
to	c
hearing	i
from	c
you	c
.	c

However	c
there	c
are	c
lots	c
of	c
rules	c
in	c
our	c
lives	c
,	c
both	c
at	c
home	c
and	c
at	c
school	c
.	c

At	c
home	c
is	i
completely	c
different	c
,	c
my	c
mum	c
is	c
quite	c
organised	c
,	c
so	c
she	c
always	i
puts	i
new	c
rules	c
.	c

Firstly	c
I	i
've	i
to	c
keep	c
clean	i
my	i
room	i
and	c
hoover	c
once	c
a	c
week	c
.	c

I	i
've	i
to	c
cook	c
myself	i
and	c
worst	i
thing	c
is	c
I	c
'm	c
not	c
allowed	c
to	c
listen	c
loud	i
music	c
in	i
everywhere	i
at	c
home	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
not	c
allowed	c
to	c
stay	c
out	c
after	c
midnight	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
groue	i
up	c
I	c
'll	c
change	c
all	c
rules	i
in	c
my	c
life	c
and	c
I	c
'll	c
make	c
my	c
own	c
rules	c
which	c
are	c
not	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
too	c
strict	c
.	c

Love	i
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
happy	c
to	c
spent	i
two	c
weeks	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
in	c
the	c
USA	c
.	c

Yet	c
,	c
I	c
could	c
only	c
travel	c
July	i
because	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
student	c
and	c
so	c
my	c
holidays	c
begin	c
on	i
July	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
not	c
too	c
bad	c
at	c
these	c
sports	c
.	c

This	c
year	c
,	c
our	c
English	c
class	c
has	c
decided	c
to	c
make	c
a	c
short	c
video	c
about	c
daily	c
life	c
at	c
our	c
school	c
.	c

(	c
It	c
is	c
a	c
graduate	c
engineer	i
school	c
where	c
we	c
are	c
studying	c
mecanics	i
and	c
energetics	i
.	c
)	c

On	i
one	i
hand	i
,	c
we	c
should	c
be	c
interested	c
in	c
the	c
lessons	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
we	c
should	c
interview	c
the	c
teacher	c
of	c
heat	c
transfert	i
since	c
his	c
courses	i
are	c
rally	i
breathtaking	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
our	c
basketball	c
team	c
has	c
won	c
a	c
local	c
championship	c
.	c

To	c
conclude	c
,	c
in	c
this	c
short	c
video	c
,	c
we	c
must	c
show	c
that	c
thanks	c
to	c
our	c
school	c
we	c
are	c
able	c
to	c
make	i
come	i
out	c
the	c
best	c
of	i
ourselves	c
.	c

According	i
to	i
the	c
evening	c
I	c
have	i
passed	i
in	c
your	c
theatre	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
see	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
"	c
(	c
as	c
you	c
wrote	c
on	c
the	c
publicity	i
paper	i
)	c
.	c

The	c
show	c
begun	i
45	c
minutes	c
later	c
than	c
supposed	i
!	c

At	i
the	i
top	i
of	i
everything	i
,	c
you	c
proposed	i
us	c
to	c
visit	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

I	c
will	c
not	c
make	c
troubles	i
but	c
I	c
ask	c
you	c
politely	c
my	i
money	c
back	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
,	i
you	c
will	c
agree	c
and	c
share	c
my	c
disappointement	i
.	c

Fashion	c
of	c
the	c
Future	c

Future	i
,	i
Everybody	c
ask	i
how	i
will	i
our	i
world	i
look	c
like	c
.	c

What	i
's	i
about	c
the	i
fashion	c
in	c
100	c
years	c
?	c

I	c
think	c
we	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
in	i
consideration	i
our	i
enviroment	i
:	c
The	i
pollution	c
makes	c
more	i
and	i
more	i
the	i
atmosphere	i
warmer	i
.	c

In	c
fact	c
,	c
winterseason	i
will	c
be	c
rare	c
or	c
will	c
maybe	c
even	c
disappear	c
.	c

The	c
ice	c
will	c
smellt	i
,	c
the	c
weather	c
will	c
be	c
warmer	c
.	c

People	c
wo	c
n't	c
wear	c
warm	c
clothes	c
anymore	c
and	c
they	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

But	c
,	c
first	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
the	c
time	c
and	c
the	c
effort	c
you	c
have	c
made	i
to	c
organize	c
the	c
entire	c
programme	c
.	c

Everything	c
seams	c
very	c
interesting	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
sure	c
that	c
we	c
will	c
all	c
have	c
a	c
very	c
good	c
time	c
.	c

That	c
's	c
because	c
the	c
"	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
"	c
takes	c
place	c
that	c
date	i
in	c
London	c
.	c

My	c
suggestion	c
is	c
to	c
use	c
Wednesday	c
's	c
afternoon	c
free	c
time	c
as	c
an	c
alternative	c
solution	i
of	i
the	c
shopping	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
that	c
you	c
will	c
find	i
this	i
possible	i
.	c

With	c
best	c
regards	c

It	c
was	c
dangerous	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
knew	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
.	c

The	c
same	c
afternoon	c
I	c
picked	c
up	c
the	c
phone	c
and	c
I	c
gave	c
them	c
a	c
call	c
.	c

Well	c
,	c
danger	c
is	c
in	c
my	c
nature	c
an	i
Life	c
is	c
nothing	c
but	c
an	c
adventure	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
,	c

I	c
'm	c
a	c
student	c
of	i
your	c
college	c
and	c
I	c
write	i
this	c
letter	c
for	c
my	c
class	c
because	c
I	c
'm	c
the	c
class	c
chief	c
.	c

On	i
the	c
hall	c
of	i
our	c
classroom	c
we	c
have	c
seen	c
an	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
and	c
we	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
show	c
is	i
it	i
possible	c
.	c

We	c
know	c
that	c
we	c
will	c
spend	c
three	c
days	c
in	c
London	c
in	c
a	c
with	i
a	c
determinate	i
programme	c
.	c

As	c
I	c
see	c
your	i
programme	c
the	i
shopping	c
is	i
at	c
the	c
same	c
time	c
of	i
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
so	i
I	c
'll	c
make	c
you	c
a	c
suggestion	c
:	c
we	c
'll	c
start	c
in	c
the	c
morning	c
with	c
the	c
Science	c
Museum	c
and	c
immediately	c
after	c
we	c
'll	c
go	c
to	c
Central	i
Exhibition	c
Hall	c
without	c
doing	c
shopping	i
.	c

Thank	c
you	c

We	c
will	c
have	c
a	c
relaxing	c
room	c
,	c
with	c
soft	c
light	c
,	c
music	i
New	i
Age	i
and	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
essences	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
we	c
ca	c
n't	c
stop	c
the	i
progress	c
but	c
if	c
we	c
want	c
we	c
can	c
conserve	c
traditional	i
things	c
.	c

The	c
home	c
of	c
the	c
future	c
will	c
be	c
very	c
impersonally	i
and	c
the	c
atmosfear	i
will	c
be	c
cold	c
and	c
very	c
essencial	i
.	c

1/3/2000	c

I	c
'm	c
a	c
student	c
in	c
English	i
class	c
which	c
going	i
to	c
spend	c
three	c
days	c
in	c
London	c
(	c
13th-14th	c
March	c
)	c
and	c
I	c
'm	c
a	i
representative	i
student	i
from	c
my	c
class	c
to	i
thanks	i
you	c
about	i
your	i
programme	c
that	c
you	c
've	c
already	i
organised	c
for	c
us	c
.	c

We	c
feel	c
ca	i
n't	c
wait	c
until	c
that	c
time	c
.	c

Anyway	c
,	c
we	c
still	c
want	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
Science	c
Museum	c
and	c
shopping	i
as	c
well	c
but	c
we	c
think	c
we	c
can	c
go	c
shopping	c
on	c
the	c
last	c
day	i
afternoon	c
of	c
our	c
trip	c
.	c

So	c
we	c
will	c
have	c
free	i
time	c
on	c
the	c
afternoon	c
of	c
the	c
14th	c
March	c
and	c
we	c
can	c
spend	c
this	c
time	c
enjoy	i
the	c
show	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
also	c
include	i
the	c
show	c
's	c
leaflet	c
on	c
the	c
back	c
of	c
this	c
letter	c
.	c

What	c
do	c
you	c
think	c
about	c
this	c
plan	c
?	c

We	i
're	i
always	c
want	c
to	c
know	c
about	c
others	c
'	c
life	i
especially	i
the	c
famous	c
one	i
even	c
the	c
one	i
that	c
we	c
hate	c
.	c

Famous	c
people	c
are	c
also	c
the	i
normal	c
people	c
like	c
us	i
just	i
because	c
their	c
jobs	i
are	i
known	i
by	c
every	i
people	i
,	c
it	c
does	c
n't	c
mean	c
that	c
we	c
can	c
invade	c
their	c
privacy	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
not	c
fair	c
for	c
them	c
to	c
have	c
journalists	c
following	c
them	c
and	c
take	i
their	c
photographs	c
and	i
some	c
journalists	c
write	c
the	i
news	i
that	c
not	i
true	c
.	c

We	c
also	c
ca	c
n't	c
deny	c
that	c
the	c
journalists	c
'	c
job	c
is	c
to	c
know	c
what	c
's	c
going	c
on	c
with	c
these	c
famous	c
people	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
these	c
stars	c
should	c
accept	c
that	c
they	c
are	c
famous	c
people	c
so	c
everyone	c
wants	c
to	c
know	c
about	c
their	c
life	c
.	c

The	c
best	c
way	c
is	c
they	i
,	c
the	c
famous	c
stars	c
and	c
the	c
journalists	c
,	c
should	i
compromise	c
and	c
respect	c
each	c
other	c
's	c
rights	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sirs	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
your	c
musical	c
show	c
which	i
I	c
saw	c
last	c
Saturday	c
.	c

According	c
to	c
your	c
advertisement	c
,	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
stars	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
be	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
.	c

You	c
can	c
imagine	c
how	c
upset	c
I	c
felt	c
,	c
as	c
I	c
really	c
wanted	c
to	c
see	c
his	c
performance	c
.	c

On	c
top	c
of	c
everything	c
,	c
although	c
your	c
advertisement	c
told	c
me	c
that	c
I	c
would	c
receive	c
some	c
discounts	c
,	c
there	c
were	c
no	c
discounts	c
available	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
receiving	c
your	c
response	c
within	c
the	c
next	c
seven	c
days	c
.	c

In	i
these	i
days	c
,	c
young	c
people	c
prefer	c
wearing	c
shabby	c
and	c
scruffy	c
clothes	c
to	c
wearing	c
neat	c
and	c
tidy	c
clothes	c
.	c

In	c
other	c
words	c
,	c
their	c
fashion	c
has	c
become	c
more	c
casual	c
.	c

In	c
general	c
,	c
their	c
parents	c
do	c
n't	c
like	c
their	c
fashion	c
.	c

They	c
want	c
their	c
children	c
to	c
wear	c
clothes	i
neatly	i
.	c

When	c
they	c
were	c
young	c
,	c
they	c
judged	c
the	i
other	i
person	c
by	c
his	c
appearance	c
.	c

They	c
also	i
were	i
asked	c
to	c
wear	c
clothes	c
which	c
was	i
in	c
accordance	c
with	c
the	c
occasion	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
this	c
is	c
still	c
correct	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
people	c
noticed	i
that	c
what	c
is	c
important	c
is	c
not	c
their	c
clothes	c
but	c
their	c
mind	c
.	c

If	c
someone	c
does	c
n't	c
have	i
enough	i
knowledge	i
about	c
the	c
event	c
which	c
he	c
attends	i
,	c
even	c
if	c
he	c
wears	c
clothes	i
neatly	i
,	c
he	c
does	c
n't	c
look	c
like	c
a	c
gentleman	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
express	c
the	c
deserve	i
of	c
all	c
students	i
in	c
my	c
class	c
to	c
visit	c
the	c
LONDON	c
FASHION	c
AND	c
LEISURE	c
SHOW	c
at	c
Central	i
Exhibition	c
Hall	c
,	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
14	c
March	c
.	c

especially	c
the	c
part	c
of	i
the	c
Latest	c
Fashions	c
,	c
because	c
is	i
something	c
which	c
affect	i
the	i
people	c
of	c
all	c
ages	c
today	c
.	c

But	c
also	c
the	c
rest	i
parts	c
of	c
the	c
show	c
seems	i
to	c
be	c
very	c
interesting	c
.	c

Leisure	c
and	c
Sports	c
Wear	c
is	c
very	c
interesting	c
.	c

The	c
girls	c
are	c
interesting	i
more	i
than	c
boys	c
,	i
For	i
make	i
up	i
and	c
hairstyle	i

Tuesday	c
morning	c
until	c
15.00	c
visit	c
to	c
Science	c
Museum	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
.	c

and	c
I	c
am	c
waiting	c
for	c
your	c
reply	c
.	c

Famous	c
people	c
,	c
such	c
as	c
politicians	c
and	c
Film	c
stars	c
,	c
deserve	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
private	c
life	c
without	c
journalists	c
Following	c
them	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
.	c

Private	i
life	c
is	c
very	c
important	c
to	i
anyone	i
,	c
because	c
your	c
job	c
create	i
you	i
stress	c
and	c
you	c
should	c
rest	c
,	i
charge	i
your	c
batteries	c
For	c
the	c
next	c
day	c
.	c

If	c
journalists	c
following	i
you	i
step	i
by	i
step	i
is	i
difficult	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
private	c
life	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
.	i

Another	c
thing	c
is	c
the	c
pressure	c
.	c

Private	i
life	c
is	c
right	i
to	i
anyone	i
and	c
all	i
we	i
should	i
respect	c
it	i
.	c

Miss	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
:	c

I	c
am	c
writting	i
in	c
response	c
of	i
it	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
can	c
arrange	c
2	c
weeks	c
in	c
July	c
with	i
my	c
school	c
holidays	c
,	c
in	c
order	c
not	c
to	c
lose	i
classes	c
.	c

You	c
told	c
me	c
to	c
choose	c
2	c
activities	c
and	c
I	c
chose	c
surfing	c
and	c
singing	c
.	c

I	c
did	c
a	c
surf	i
course	c
last	c
summer	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
gone	c
to	c
singing	c
lessons	c
almost	c
all	c
my	c
life	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
a	c
few	c
questions	c
.	c

How	c
much	c
money	c
should	c
I	c
take	c
to	c
spend	c
in	c
those	c
two	c
weeks	c
?	c
and	c
also	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	i
should	i
take	c
?	c

Please	c
,	c
when	c
you	c
recive	i
this	c
letter	c
give	c
me	c
a	c
call	c
so	c
we	c
can	c
arrange	c
everything	c
.	c

Looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c

We	c
are	c
going	c
to	c
do	i
a	c
video	c
about	c
daily	c
life	c
at	c
school	c
,	i
the	i
following	c
classes	c
are	c
the	c
ones	c
I	c
recomend	i
to	i
film	i
.	c

CHEMISTRY	c
:	c
We	c
do	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
experiments	c
and	c
the	c
materials	c
we	c
use	c
are	c
very	c
good	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
if	c
we	c
film	c
that	i
class	c
the	c
people	c
that	c
watches	i
it	c
will	c
be	c
impress	i
with	c
the	c
equipment	c
we	c
have	c
got	c
.	c

SPANISH	c
:	c
We	c
are	c
doing	c
a	c
play	c
now	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
if	c
we	c
do	c
it	c
properly	c
we	c
could	c
have	c
a	c
great	c
spanish	i
play	c
.	c

Those	c
three	c
classes	c
are	c
my	c
choises	i
,	i
I	c
hope	c
we	c
could	i
do	c
them	c
and	c
make	c
a	c
very	c
good	c
video	c
about	c
our	c
school	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
should	c
have	c
had	i
started	c
at	c
19:30	c
but	c
it	c
started	c
later	i
,	c
at	c
20:15	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
pay	c
attention	c
to	c
my	c
complains	i
.	c

So	c
I	c
phoned	c
her	c
and	c
told	c
her	c
the	c
whole	c
story	c
.	c

Last	c
weekend	c
in	i
the	c
Local	c
Festival	c
,	c
that	i
is	c
held	c
every	c
year	c
in	c
our	c
Town	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
walking	c
with	c
my	c
little	c
sister	c
,	c
who	c
is	c
three	c
years	c
old	c
.	c

So	c
while	c
I	c
was	c
looking	c
for	c
her	c
I	c
saw	c
the	c
Director	c
of	c
my	c
school	c
,	c
Mr	c
Smythe	c
,	c
stealing	c
money	c
from	c
a	c
small	c
shop	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
not	c
believe	c
my	c
eyes	c
!	c

When	c
Mr	c
Smythe	c
saw	c
me	c
there	c
,	c
he	c
told	c
me	c
:	c
"	c
If	c
you	c
say	c
a	c
word	c
you	c
're	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
in	c
serious	c
trouble.	c
"	c

We	c
were	c
at	c
school	c
when	c
she	c
told	c
me	c
this	c
and	c
Mr	c
Smythe	c
went	c
to	c
our	c
class	c
and	c
said	c
to	c
me	c
"	i
May	c
I	c
talk	c
to	c
you	c
?	c
"	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
some	c
further	c
information	c
about	c
the	c
competition	c
I	c
won	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
not	c
just	i
to	c
sleeping	c
in	c
an	i
tent	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
mabey	i
ruen	i
my	c
holiday	c
.	c

Photography	i
I	i
never	i
realy	i
took	i
pratice	i
in	i
,	i
yes	i
I	c
have	c
made	i
some	c
holiday	c
pictures	c
but	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
learn	c
more	c
about	c
this	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
am	c
not	c
very	c
good	c
in	i
Photography	i
.	c

Surfing	c
is	c
my	c
passion	c
.	c

I	c
live	c
nearby	i
a	c
beach	c
and	c
whenever	c
I	c
have	c
the	c
time	c
I	c
grape	i
my	c
bord	i
and	c
go	c
surfing	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
if	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
bring	c
my	c
own	c
wetsuit	c
for	c
surfing	c
and	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
do	c
you	c
think	c
I	c
need	c
?	c

I	c
hope	c
I	c
have	c
informed	i
you	c
enough	c

helping	c
at	c
pop	i
concert	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
fantastic	c
.	c

You	c
also	c
would	c
have	c
liked	c
very	i
much	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
to	c
take	i
care	i
of	i
that	c
every	c
artist	c
went	c
in	c
the	c
right	c
dressing	c
room	c
and	c
not	c
in	c
someone	c
elses	i
.	c

Every	c
artist	c
could	c
scream	c
at	c
me	c
whenever	c
they	c
wanted	c
.	c

That	c
was	c
a	c
good	c
feeling	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

What	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
they	c
shoot	i
wear	c
.	c

I	c
also	c
had	c
to	c
give	c
them	c
drinks	c
and	c
food	c
and	c
help	c
them	c
to	c
relax	c
whenever	c
they	c
were	c
nervous	c
.	c

The	c
thing	c
I	c
realy	i
liked	c
,	i
was	c
helping	c
the	c
artists	c
and	c
talking	c
to	c
them	c
.	c

Oke	i
,	c
they	c
screamed	c
at	c
me	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
because	c
they	c
were	c
nervous	c
and	c
excited	c
about	c
their	c
concert	c
.	c

I	c
realy	i
got	c
to	c
know	c
them	c
after	c
the	c
concert	c
.	c

And	c
of	c
course	c
I	c
immediately	c
said	c
Yes	i
!	c
!	c

The	i
will	c
call	c
me	c
next	c
week	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
write	i
when	c
I	c
talk	i
to	c
them	c
.	c

Talk	c
to	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
I	c
had	i
unfortunately	i
a	c
very	c
bad	c
evening	c
.	c

Finaly	i
,	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
understand	c
why	c
you	c
pushed	c
people	c
to	c
visit	c
your	c
restaurant	c
if	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
open	c
it	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
!	c

This	c
is	c
why	c
for	i
all	c
of	c
those	i
good	c
reasons	c
I	i
am	c
asking	c
for	c
some	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

Our	c
century	c
is	c
a	c
century	c
of	c
changes	c
,	c
of	c
evolution	c
.	c

If	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
discuss	c
with	i
friends	c
or	c
order	c
a	c
Pizza	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
do	c
it	c
easely	i
as	c
I	c
want	c
,	c
when	c
it	i
want	c
.	c

In	i
spite	i
of	c
that	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
the	i
technology	c
is	c
improving	c
my	c
quality	c
of	c
life	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
with	c
reference	c
to	c
the	c
three	i
day	i
trip	c
in	i
London	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
organising	c
the	c
programme	c
,	c
which	c
seems	c
extremely	c
interesting	c
.	c

Especially	i
,	c
sightseeing	i
by	c
bus	c
must	i
be	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

We	c
all	c
found	c
it	c
exciting	c
and	c
exhilarating	c
.	c

It	c
must	i
be	i
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
show	c
because	c
we	c
are	c
keen	c
on	c
fashions	c
and	c
clothes	c
.	c

Therefore	c
,	c
I	c
wonder	c
if	c
we	c
could	c
possibly	c
change	c
the	c
programme	c
slightly	c
on	c
14th	c
March	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
be	c
grateful	c
,	i
if	c
you	c
could	c
understand	i
our	c
concern	c
and	c
change	c
the	c
programme	c
on	c
14th	c
of	c
March	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
they	c
should	c
accept	c
the	c
fact	c
that	c
they	c
are	c
well-known	i
and	c
they	c
should	c
be	c
observed	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
,	c
as	c
we	c
are	c
curious	c
to	c
know	c
what	c
they	c
do	c
and	c
we	c
love	c
to	c
gossip	c
about	c
others	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
it	c
might	c
be	c
a	c
good	c
thing	c
that	c
scandales	i
usually	c
increase	c
their	c
fame	c
,	c
even	c
if	c
they	c
did	i
anything	i
wrong	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
also	c
said	c
that	c
their	c
private	c
lives	c
must	c
not	c
be	c
intruded	c
,	i
as	c
they	c
are	c
the	c
same	c
as	c
us	c
,	c
human	c
beings	c
.	c

It	c
does	c
not	c
seem	c
possible	c
that	c
we	c
can	c
live	c
without	c
any	c
private	c
life	c
.	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
although	c
I	c
think	c
they	c
ought	c
to	c
abondone	i
their	c
lives	c
partly	c
when	c
they	c
entre	i
the	c
world	c
of	c
fame	c
,	c
they	c
should	c
take	c
some	c
actions	i
against	c
journalists	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
protect	c
their	c
human	c
rights	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
Carlos	c
Gregore	c
and	c
during	c
my	c
last	c
holiday	c
I	c
stayed	c
in	c
London	c
for	c
a	c
week	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
I	c
noted	i
on	i
the	i
advertisement	i
,	i
a	i
lot	i
of	i
wrong	i
points	i
:	c

An	c
actor	c
was	c
changed	c
and	c
the	c
pubblic	i
were	c
no	i
informated	i
.	c

There	c
were	c
no	c
discounts	c
available	c
like	c
the	c
advertisement	i
had	i
written	i
.	c

At	i
the	i
end	i
,	c
the	c
theatre	c
resturant	i
was	c
closed	c
for	c
holiday	i
!	c

"	c
YOUR	c
PERFECT	c
EVENING	c
OUT	c
"	c
but	c
I	c
think	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
very	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
!	c

Your	i

I	c
also	c
think	c
I	c
am	c
lucky	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
live	c
in	c
a	c
period	c
of	c
tecnologic	i
boom	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
last	c
fifty	c
years	c
the	i
human	c
tecnologies	i
are	i
growed	i
up	i
exponensially	i
.	c

First	c
the	c
conquist	i
of	c
the	i
space	c
,	c
then	c
the	i
computers	c
,	c
and	c
now	c
the	c
new	c
biotecnologies	i
have	c
changed	c
,	c
and	c
are	c
changing	c
,	c
the	c
face	c
of	c
the	c
word	i
.	c

My	c
daily	c
life	c
should	c
be	c
changed	c
by	c
these	c
innovations	c
!	c

So	c
,	c
in	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
new	c
tecnology	i
has	c
changed	c
,	c
is	c
changeing	i
and	c
will	c
change	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
,	i
I	c
hope	c
that	c
after	i
my	c
life	c
is	i
better	c
.	c

The	c
whole	c
class	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
the	c
good	c
programm	i
,	i
which	c
you	c
have	c
organised	c
for	c
our	c
trip	c
to	c
London	c
.	c

The	c
reason	c
why	c
I	c
'm	c
writting	i
to	c
you	c
is	c
the	c
class	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
seen	c
an	c
advertisment	i
for	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
March	i
14	c
from	c
10.00	c
am	c
-	c
19.00	i
p.m.	c
It	c
is	c
a	c
show	c
about	c
latest	i
fashions	c
,	c
leisure	c
and	c
sports	i
wear	i
,	c
make	i
up	i
and	c
hairstyles	c
.	c

Instead	c
of	c
a	c
shopping	c
tour	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
afternoon	c
we	i
could	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
show	c
and	c
do	c
the	c
shopping	c
on	c
Wedensday	i
afternoon	c
in	c
our	c
free	c
time	c
.	c

What	c
are	i
you	i
thinking	i
about	c
this	c
suggesten	i
?	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
will	c
unterstand	i
this	i
kind	i
of	i
matter	i
and	c
the	c
class	c
and	c
I	c
looking	i
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	i
,	c

First	i
point	c
we	i
will	c
use	c
more	c
often	c
new	c
technologies	c
like	c
telecommunication	i
or	c
internet	i
.	c

That	c
means	c
for	c
exampel	i
while	i
you	c
are	c
sitting	c
in	c
the	c
office	c
you	c
are	c
able	c
to	c
controll	i
your	c
home	c
with	c
the	c
computer	c
.	c

But	c
the	c
form	c
and	c
the	c
rooms	c
of	c
a	c
building	c
will	c
still	c
be	c
the	c
same	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
explain	c
to	c
you	c
the	c
problems	c
regarding	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
I	c
saw	c
at	c
your	c
theatre	c
.	c

The	c
show	c
started	c
forty-five	c
minutes	c
later	i
and	c
this	c
really	c
disappointed	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
in	c
the	c
near	c
future	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

She	c
was	c
a	c
very	c
pretty	c
and	c
kind	c
girl	c
,	c
but	c
she	c
had	c
this	c
bad	c
habit	c
.	c

This	c
was	c
her	c
only	c
fault	c
.	c

That	c
was	c
why	c
she	c
decide	i
to	c
change	c
her	c
behaviour	c
.	c

She	c
was	c
given	c
a	c
chance	c
:	c
if	c
she	c
had	i
been	i
able	c
not	c
to	c
tell	c
everybody	c
a	c
secret	c
for	c
a	c
short	c
time	c
,	c
her	c
friends	c
would	c
have	i
started	i
trusting	c
her	c
.	c

The	c
secret	c
was	c
about	c
a	c
surprise-party	i
for	c
her	c
bestfriend	i
's	i
birthday	c
.	c

But	c
,	c
as	c
the	c
days	c
went	c
by	c
,	c
she	c
was	c
surprised	c
because	c
she	c
realized	c
she	c
was	c
getting	c
used	i
not	c
to	i
tell	i
secrets	c
any	i
more	i
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c

My	c
name	c
is	c
Gabriel	c
and	c
I	c
represented	i
our	c
class	c
.	c

We	c
have	c
seen	c
an	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
and	c
we	c
would	c
particularly	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

As	c
representant	i
of	c
my	c
class	c
may	c
I	c
kindly	c
ask	c
you	c
to	c
change	i
partially	i
your	c
plan	c
during	i
our	c
visit	c
in	i
London	c
.	i

The	i
Monday	c
13	c
March	c
would	i
be	i
fine	i
.	c

There	i
will	c
shown	i
the	c
latest	c
fashions	c
,	c
leisure	c
and	c
sports	c
wear	c
,	c
several	i
additional	c
attractions	c
.	c

It	c
will	i
be	i
beutiful	i
if	c
you	c
would	c
agree	c
to	c
change	c
your	c
plan	c
.	c

It	c
happened	c
on	c
a	c
very	c
lovly	i
day	c
in	c
summer	c
.	c

The	c
sun	c
was	c
shining	c
,	c
the	c
Chanel	i
was	c
clear	c
blue	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
walking	c
by	c
the	c
Sea	i
.	c

Suddenly	c
I	c
heart	i
somebody	c
crying	c
for	c
the	i
help	c
.	c

I	c
knew	c
,	i
I	c
ca	i
n't	i
swimm	i
then	i
I	c
realized	c
it	c
might	c
be	c
dangerous	c
for	c
me	c
as	c
well	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
diffucult	i
for	c
me	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
afraid	c
of	c
watter	i
.	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
happy	c
that	c
I	c
managed	c
to	c
save	c
the	c
live	i
of	c
the	c
boy	c
.	c

Now	c
,	c
when	c
I	c
consider	c
about	i
the	c
events	c
it	i
's	c
clear	c
for	i
me	c
that	c
if	c
I	c
got	c
a	i
few	c
minutes	c
later	c
probably	i
would	i
be	i
to	i
late	c
.	c

The	c
two	c
activities	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
do	c
in	c
the	c
camp	c
are	c
swimming	c
and	c
photography	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
a	c
good	c
swimmer	c
and	c
I	c
had	i
some	c
expirience	i
in	c
photography	i
however	i
I	i
have	c
very	i
much	i
to	c
learn	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
got	c
two	c
questions	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
.	c

How	c
much	c
money	c
and	c
clothes	i
should	c
I	c
take	c
with	c
me	c
?	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
grateful	c
for	c
your	c
prize	c
and	c

of	c
the	c

of	c
the	c

not	c
to	c

but	c
to	c
keep	c
the	c
computers	c
working	c
properly	c

Maths	c

popular	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
this	c
letter	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
make	c
some	c
suggestions	c
for	c
the	c
International	c
Arts	c
Festival	c
that	c
took	c
place	c
a	c
while	c
ago	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
there	c
two	i
days	c
enjoying	c
it	c
and	c
have	c
found	c
some	c
points	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
change	c
to	c
make	c
it	c
a	c
better	c
one	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

Well	c
,	c
here	c
are	c
some	c
of	c
my	c
opinion	i
and	c
suggestions	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
there	c
should	c
more	i
stars	c
and	c
artists	c
from	c
more	c
countries	c
because	c
this	c
year	c
,	c
I	c
believe	c
there	c
were	c
artists	c
only	i
from	i
six	c
countries	c
which	c
,	c
in	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
is	c
not	c
quite	c
from	c
all	c
over	c
the	c
world	c
.	c

The	c
jazz	c
,	c
rock	c
and	c
classical	c
concerts	c
were	c
really	c
entertaining	c
except	c
that	c
there	c
were	c
some	c
concert	c
halls	c
to	i
small	c
for	c
the	c
audience	c
:	c
I	c
'm	c
sure	c
that	c
you	c
can	c
find	c
bigger	c
halls	c
for	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

By	c
the	c
way	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
also	c
wondering	c
if	c
it	c
was	c
possible	c
to	c
have	c
more	c
plays	c
and	c
films	c
for	c
the	c
coming	c
up	i
festival	c
as	c
the	c
reaction	c
of	c
the	c
people	c
was	c
excellent	c
.	c

Dear	c
Emily	c
,	c

Well	c
,	c
in	c
the	c
letter	c
you	c
wrote	c
me	c
,	c
you	c
asked	c
some	c
questions	c
about	c
school	c
and	c
house	c
rules	c
.	c

My	c
school	c
's	c
an	c
American	c
school	c
so	c
you	c
're	c
not	c
supposed	c
to	c
talk	c
in	c
Spanish	c
during	c
the	c
classes	c
either	c
.	c

But	c
still	c
I	c
cannot	c
go	c
out	c
of	c
the	c
house	c
without	c
telling	c
my	c
mom	c
where	c
I	c
am	c
going	c
and	c
when	c
I	c
'm	c
coming	c
back	c
.	c

But	c
it	c
existed	i
since	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
young	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
change	c
the	c
rule	c
not	i
to	i
speak	i
in	c
Spanish	c
at	c
school	c
because	c
most	c
of	c
us	c
feel	c
more	c
comfortable	c
speaking	c
in	c
Spanish	c
but	i
I	c
guess	c
to	i
learn	c
.	i

we	c
should	c
speak	c
English	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
.	c

Well	c
,	c
that	c
's	c
all	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
one	c
day	c
you	c
get	c
to	c
change	c
what	c
you	c
wanted	c
.	c

Bye.	c
.	c

your	c
Pal	c
,	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
as	c
I	c
have	c
an	c
allergie	i
against	i
grass	c
.	c

Then	i
you	c
asked	c
to	i
chose	i
two	c
activities	c
from	c
the	c
list	c
you	c
sent	c
to	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
a	c
total	c
beginner	c
in	c
both	c
activities	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
these	c
two	c
weeks	c
will	c
be	c
a	c
good	c
opportunity	c
to	c
learn	c
something	c
about	c
them	c
.	c

Finally	c
I	i
have	i
also	i
some	c
questions	c
to	i
you	c
.	c

Firstly	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
will	c
be	c
appropriate	c
for	c
the	c
camp	c
,	c
secondly	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
should	c
take	c
with	c
me	c
for	c
the	c
two	c
weeks	c
and	c
lastly	c
if	c
there	c
are	c
any	c
possibilies	i
for	c
cooking	c
.	c

'	c
Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
'	c

All	c
kinds	c
of	c
shopping	c
have	c
more	c
and	c
more	c
become	c
to	i
a	c
rather	i
stressful	i
activity	i
than	c
an	c
enjoyable	c
on	c
.	c

I	i
often	c
begins	c
with	c
finding	c
a	c
parking	i
for	c
the	c
car	c
,	c
which	c
can	c
take	c
more	c
than	c
15	c
minutes	c
.	c

Having	c
finally	c
decided	c
and	c
got	c
what	c
you	c
wanted	c
to	i
,	c
the	c
next	c
torture	c
comes	c
at	c
the	c
cash-desk	i
,	c
when	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
pay	c
.	c

You	c
have	c
to	c
wait	c
at	i
a	c
long	c
queue	c
for	c
more	c
than	c
15	c
minutes	c
.	c

2	c
Desember	i
2000	i

Although	c
I	c
have	i
read	i
that	c
Starts	i
and	c
Artists	i
came	c
frome	i
around	c
the	c
world	c
,	c
I	c
have	i
realised	i
that	c
they	c
only	c
came	c
from	c
only	i
six	c
countries	c
.	c

I	c
spent	i
a	c
good	c
time	c
in	i
the	c
jazz	c
,	c
rock	c
and	c
classical	c
concerts	c
in	c
spite	c
of	c
the	c
fact	c
that	c
some	c
concert	c
halls	c
were	c
too	c
small	c
.	c

All	c
my	c
family	c
liked	c
the	c
films	c
and	c
the	c
plays	c
that	c
there	c
were	c
very	c
much	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
personaly	i
think	c
that	c
It	i
would	c
be	c
better	c
to	c
add	c
more	c
because	c
there	c
were	c
only	c
five	c
plays	c
and	c
seven	c
films	c
.	c

The	c
rest	c
of	c
the	c
activities	c
were	c
very	c
interesting	c
for	c
us	c
,	c
we	c
learnt	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
things	c
and	c
we	c
met	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
interesting	c
people	c
,	c
and	c
all	c
of	c
this	c
without	c
being	c
expensive	c
,	i
I	c
think	c
that	c
ticket	i
was	c
exellent	i
for	c
us	c
because	c
of	c
its	c
price	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
you	i
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c
.	c

2	c
Desember	i
2000	i

It	c
's	c
good	c
to	c
hear	c
that	c
you	c
have	c
passed	c
all	c
of	c
them	i
.	c

In	c
your	c
letter	c
you	c
told	i
me	c
something	c
about	c
rules	c
.	c

I	c
imagine	c
that	c
you	c
want	c
my	c
opinion	c
for	i
your	c
homework	c
?	c

Do	c
n't	c
you	c
?	c

You	c
know	c
that	c
I	c
'm	c
studing	i
in	c
a	c
hard	i
school	c
,	c
and	c
as	c
you	c
can	c
imagine	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
work	c
hard	c
and	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
do	c
homework	c
everyday	i
.	c

?	i

Do	c
you	c
understand	c
this	c
?	c

I	c
have	c
friends	c
that	c
are	c
studing	i
in	c
other	c
schools	c
and	c
they	c
are	c
very	c
happy	c
with	c
their	c
freedom	c
.	c

they	i
let	c
me	c
go	c
out	c
with	c
my	c
friends	c
every	c
day	c
,	c
but	c
they	c
make	c
me	c
do	c
homework	c
and	c
I	c
hate	c
this	i
!	c
!	c

I	c
hope	c
that	i
it	i
is	c
what	c
you	c
wanted	c
from	c
me	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
;	i

However	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
as	i
well	i
,	i
that	i
the	i
class	i
would	i
like	i
to	i
visit	i
"	i
The	i
London	i
Fashion	i
and	i
Leisure	i
Show	i
"	i
,	c
is	i
on	c
Tuesday	c
from	c
10.00	c
AM	i
until	c
19.00	c
pm.	c
They	c
do	c
n't	c
need	c
to	c
pay	c
.	c

In	i
addition	i
,	i
I	c
think	c
is	i
a	c
good	c
a	c
idea	c
,	c
because	c
they	c
could	c
go	c
after	i
shopping	i
,	c
when	c
they	c
have	c
a	i
free	c
time	c
,	i
I	c
am	c
sure	c
about	c
that	c
,	c
they	c
will	c
like	i
to	c
visit	c
that	c
place	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
hearing	i
from	c
you	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
true	c
,	c
they	c
deserve	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
private	c
life	c
without	c
journalist	i
following	c
them	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
,	c
however	c
this	c
news	i
give	i
them	c
money	c
,	c
and	c
confortable	i
life	c
.	c

Famous	c
people	c
,	c
such	c
as	c
politicians	c
and	c
film	c
stars	c
,	c
they	i
live	c
happy	i
,	i
because	c
they	c
know	c
that	c
the	i
famous	c
mean	i
to	i
be	i
rich	c
.	c

They	c
can	c
travel	c
around	c
the	c
world	c
,	c
buy	c
everything	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
good	c
life	c
,	c
but	c
at	c
the	c
same	c
time	c
,	c
they	c
must	c
be	c
a	i
very	c
good	c
peaple	i
,	c
because	c
"	c
the	i
Famous	i
"	c
is	c
just	c
for	c
a	c
few	i
time	c
,	c
nothing	c
is	i
forever	c
in	c
this	c
world	c
.	c

I	c
do	i
not	c
really	c
like	c
will	i
be	i
a	c
famous	c
person	c
,	c
because	c
you	c
are	c
not	c
really	c
yourselfh	i
,	c
and	c
for	c
me	c
is	i
the	c
more	i
important	c
thing	c
.	c

Your	i
faithfully	i

I	c
was	c
so	i
disappointed	c
because	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
find	c
what	c
I	c
expect	i
at	c
your	c
show	c
.	c

I	c
expected	c
to	c
see	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
because	c
at	i
the	c
paper	c
that	c
you	c
have	i
given	i
to	c
me	c
it	c
wrote	i
that	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
came	i
but	c
there	c
was	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
.	c

Then	c
you	c
wrote	c
that	c
it	c
start	i
at	c
19.30	c
but	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
.	c

You	c
wrote	c
that	i
"	c
visit	c
our	c
restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
"	c
so	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
eat	c
my	c
supper	c
,	c
to	c
eat	c
at	c
your	c
restaurant	c
.	i

but	c
the	c
reastaurant	i
was	c
closed	c
because	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
20:15	i
and	c
finissed	i
at	c
00.15	c
and	c
the	c
restaurant	c
was	c
opened	i
until	c
00.00	c
.	c

After	c
all	c
this	i
problems	c
I	c
became	c
dissappointed	i
.	c

If	c
you	c
would	i
give	c
me	c
some	c
of	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
that	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
great	c
excuse	i
for	c
the	c
loss	i
of	c
time	c
and	c
my	c
dissopointness	i
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c

and	c
the	c
police	c
thought	c
Marine	c
's	c
father	c
did	c
this	c
so	c
they	c
put	c
him	c
on	i
prison	i
he	i
had	c
nobody	c
that	c
he	c
can	i
give	c
marry	i
so	i
he	c
leave	i
her	c
on	i
their	c

They	c
give	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
money	c
to	c
Marine	c

we	c
understood	c
each	c
other	c
,	c
because	c
when	c
I	c
talked	c
about	c
my	c
private	c
life	c
to	c
her	c
,	c
she	c
seemed	c
very	c
understandable	i
.	c

I	c
appreciated	c
her	c
and	c
she	c
would	i
n't	i
mind	c
.	c

I	c
told	c
her	c
the	c
reason	c
that	i
I	c
had	c
to	c
miss	c
the	i
work	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
to	c
go	c
and	c
see	c
him	c
.	c

All	c
I	c
know	c
is	c
about	i
drug	c
smuggling	c
,	c
that	i
he	c
involved	i
.	c

I	c
quickly	c
got	c
out	c
of	c
toilet	i
.	c

June	c
17th	c
2000	c

I	c
went	c
in	i
London	c
for	c
a	c
week	c
of	c
"	c
pure	c
holiday	c
"	c
thinking	i
to	i
have	i
some	c
fun	c
coming	i
to	c
see	c
your	c
musical	c
show	c
.	c

On	i
the	c
advertisement	c
it	c
had	i
been	i
written	c
that	c
there	i
would	i
have	i
been	i
Danny	i
Brook	i
too	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
entered	i
I	c
did	c
n't	c
get	c
the	i
discount	c
(	c
as	i
it	i
has	i
been	c
written	i
!	c
!	c
)	c

The	c
show	c
had	i
to	i
started	i
at	c
19:30	c
and	c
I	c
arrived	c
before	i
,	c
frightened	c
not	i
to	i
find	i
a	c
good	c
place	c
to	c
see	c
"	c
my	c
hero	c
"	c
.	c

Is	i
it	i
a	i
correct	i
thing	i
?	c

I	c
was	c
getting	c
angry	c
,	c
but	c
,	c
finally	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
and	c
I	c
became	c
quiter	i
.	c

when	c
I	c
saw	c
that	c
the	c
actor	c
was	c
n't	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
but	c
a	c
different	c
one	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
disappointed	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	i
to	c
have	c
a	c
good	c
meal	c
in	c
the	c
"	c
famous	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
"	c
(	c
that	i
,	c
of	c
course	c
,	c
was	c
closed	c
for	c
a	c
free	i
night	i
!	c
!	c
!	c
!	c
)	c

I	c
hope	c
,	c
that	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
,	c
you	c
will	c
understand	c
that	c
it	c
is	c
n't	c
right	c
to	c
write	c
false	c
things	c
on	i
an	c
advertisement	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
attention	c
.	c

Faithfully	c

If	c
you	c
think	c
that	c
fifty	c
years	c
ago	c
,	c
when	c
there	c
were	c
n't	c
cars	c
or	c
any	c
sort	c
of	c
comfort	i
(	c
born	c
just	c
in	c
the	c
"	c
industrial	c
age	c
"	c
)	c
everything	c
had	c
to	c
be	c
done	c
by	c
hands	i
or	c
by	c
animal	c
work	i
:	c
I	c
think	c
in	i
that	c
time	c
life	c
was	c
really	c
harder	i
than	c
now	c
!	c

Walking	c
on	c
a	c
city	c
street	c
,	c
it	c
's	c
difficult	c
to	c
find	c
parks	c
or	c
"	c
green	c
"	c
places	c
with	c
trees	c
and	c
clean	c
air	c
:	c
actually	c
pollution	c
,	c
traffic	c
and	c
noize	i
are	c
the	c
main	c
problems	c
of	c
our	c
society	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
concerning	c
our	i
three	c
days	c
which	c
we	c
are	c
going	c
to	c
spend	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
the	c
programme	c
which	c
you	c
have	c
organised	c
for	c
our	c
English	c
class	c
.	c

It	c
sounds	c
very	c
promissing	i
.	c

Especially	c
the	c
trip	c
to	c
Greenwich	c
.	c

The	c
show	c
is	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
in	c
Central	i
Exhibition	c
Hall	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
14th	c
March	c
from	c
10.00-19.00.	c
.	i

The	i
entry	i
for	c
students	c
is	c
free	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
suggest	c
to	i
visit	i
the	c
Science	c
Museum	c
,	c
which	c
was	i
planned	i
for	i
Tuesday	c
,	c
on	c
Wednesday	c
afternoon	c
.	c

So	c
that	c
we	c
can	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
Fashion	c
Show	c
.	c

And	c
if	c
there	c
is	c
anybody	c
who	c
wants	c
to	c
go	c
shopping	c
,	c
he	c
would	i
be	c
able	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
on	c
Wednesday	c
evening	c
.	c

We	c
are	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c
.	c

For	c
just	c
one	c
day	c
in	c
my	c
summer	c
holidays	c
I	c
planned	c
to	c
do	c
something	c
adventurous	c
.	c

The	c
moment	c
I	c
saw	c
the	c
advertisement	c
about	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
seven	i
world	i
wonders	i
,	c
I	c
knew	c
,	i
I	c
had	c
to	c
see	c
it	c
.	c

But	c
this	c
was	c
also	c
the	c
moment	c
when	c
my	c
nightmare	c
started	c
to	c
come	c
alive	i
.	c

My	c
friend	c
and	c
I	c
had	c
just	c
arrived	c
at	c
a	c
small	c
airport	c
in	c
the	c
middle	c
of	c
the	c
Californian	c
desert	c
.	c

One	i
man	c
came	c
out	c
from	c
a	c
small	c
building	c
.	c

He	c
introduced	c
himself	c
and	c
we	c
walked	c
towards	c
a	c
small	c
plane	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
horrible	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
feel	c
every	c
movement	c
which	c
was	c
caused	c
by	c
clowds	i
or	c
winds	i
.	c

But	c
then	c
,	c
finally	c
,	c
we	c
reached	c
the	c
Grand	c
Canyon	c
.	c

I	c
did	c
n't	c
know	c
what	c
to	c
feel	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
amazing	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
too	c
dangerous	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
knew	c
deep	c
inside	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
see	c
it	c
.	c

As	c
I	c
'm	c
an	c
artist	i
student	c
in	i
a	c
particular	c
College	c
,	c
I	c
only	i
can	i
go	c
to	c
your	i
Camp	c
California	c
in	c
July	c
,	c
because	c
in	c
this	i
month	c
I	c
got	i
no	i
class	i
,	c
and	c
I	c
'm	c
free	c
to	c
do	c
whatever	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
.	c

Painting	c
and	c
Photography	c
are	c
the	i
activities	i
good	i
for	i
me	i
.	c

In	i
Painting	c
I	c
talk	c
about	c
human	c
beings	c
in	c
this	c
world	c
,	c
in	i
big	c
canvases	c
;	c
and	c
in	i
Photography	c
,	c
with	i
Collages	c
,	c
I	c
talk	c
about	c
anger	c
and	c
guilty	i
in	c
the	c
families	i
'	i
lines	i
.	c

So	c
in	i
Camp	c
California	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
keep	c
me	i
on	i
touching	i
to	i
these	c
areas	c
.	c

With	c
this	c
amount	c
I	c
could	c
buy	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
art	c
books	c
,	c
and	c
records	c
.	c

Shopping	i
is	i
something	i
made	i
,	i
which	i
do	i
not	i
need	i
to	i
be	i
enjoyable	i
.	c

We	c
can	c
analize	i
when	c
shopping	c
is	c
enjoyable	c
,	c
when	i
it	c
is	c
not	c
.	c

There	c
is	c
joy	c
in	c
shopping	c
when	c
it	c
is	c
made	i
by	c
ourselves	c
to	i
ourselves	c
.	c

It	i
means	c
buying	c
whatever	c
we	c
like	c
,	c
just	i
like	c
clothes	c
,	c
records	c
,	c
rings	c
,	c
and	c
books	c
.	c

Buying	c
coffins	c
and	c
graveyards	i
to	c
bury	c
relatieves	i
is	c
not	c
as	c
enjoyable	c
as	c
buying	c
clothes	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
organising	c
the	c
International	c
Arts	c
Festival	c
,	c
in	c
which	c
I	c
participated	c
this	c
year	c
,	c
and	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
my	c
opinion	c
about	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
organising	c
this	c
event	c
was	c
a	c
great	c
idea	c
.	c

One	c
reasonably-priced	c
weekend	c
ticket	c
for	c
all	c
events	c
was	c
also	c
an	c
excellent	c
idea	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
stars	i
were	c
supposed	c
to	c
come	c
from	c
all	c
around	c
the	c
world	c
.	c

Apparently	c
there	c
were	c
artists	c
from	c
only	c
six	c
countries	c
.	c

All	c
the	c
concerts	c
were	c
great	c
,	c
but	c
some	c
concert	c
halls	c
were	c
too	c
small	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
also	c
like	c
to	c
suggest	c
you	i
to	i
try	i
and	c
make	c
more	c
plays	c
and	c
films	c
available	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mary	c
,	c

It	c
was	c
very	c
interesting	c
to	c
hear	c
about	c
rules	i
in	c
England	c
.	c

The	c
rules	c
in	c
Poland	c
are	c
quite	c
similar	c
to	c
those	c
discribed	i
in	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

We	c
are	c
not	c
allowed	c
to	c
talk	c
during	c
the	i
lesson	i
and	c
we	c
have	c
to	c
do	c
our	c
homework	c
every	c
day	c
.	c

In	c
most	c
of	c
the	c
schools	c
students	c
have	c
to	c
change	c
their	c
shoes	c
in	c
order	c
not	c
to	c
make	c
the	c
floor	c
dirty	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
hard	c
to	c
find	c
any	c
spare	c
time	c
sometimes	c
!	c

What	c
about	c
home	i
rules	c
?	c

All	c
the	c
things	c
we	c
're	c
not	c
allowed	c
to	c
do	c
depend	c
on	c
them	c
.	c

Lots	c
of	c
love	c
,	c

I	c
'm	c
a	c
student	c
from	c
St.	c
Petersburg	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
'm	c
studing	i
in	c
a	c
theatre	i
acodimy	i
.	c

We	c
were	c
lucky	c
to	c
get	c
tickets	c
to	c
the	c
,,Over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
"	c
show	c
in	c
your	c
theatre	c
.	c

Danny	c
Brook	c
is	c
my	c
favorit	i
actor	c
&	c
to	c
see	c
him	c
was	c
my	c
dream	i
from	i
my	c
childhood	c
!	c

It	c
was	i
a	i
suprise	i
when	c
we	c
were	c
told	c
there	i
will	i
be	c
another	c
actor	c
.	c

Also	c
we	c
expected	c
to	c
get	i
a	i
discounts	i
as	c
a	c
students	c
,	c
but	c
international	c
students	c
cards	c
are	c
not	i
available	i
in	c
your	i
theater	i
(	c
that	c
is	c
very	c
strange	c
-	c
even	c
your	i
advertisment	i
has	i
an	c
information	c
about	c
discounts	c
)	c
.	c

Another	c
problem	c
-	c
we	c
were	c
very	c
hungry	c
that	c
evening	c
because	c
the	c
show	c
was	i
postpone	i
45	c
minutes	i
!	c
so	c
we	c
were	c
late	i
to	c
our	c
supper	c
in	c
the	c
hotel	c
and	i
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
also	c
closed	c
without	c
any	i
risons	i
.	c

I	c
'm	c
waiting	c
for	c
your	c
anser	i
and	c
hope	c
I	c
can	c
get	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
!	c

Industrial	i
weel	i
going	i
faster	i
and	i
faster	i
.	i

Im	i
dealing	c
with	c
a	i
mobile	c
communication	c
-	c
mobile	c
phones	c
and	c
papers	i
.	c

And	c
I	c
hope	c
to	c
find	c
a	c
realy	i
good	c
job	c
in	c
a	c
good	c
company	c
.	c

More	c
and	c
more	c
people	c
buing	i
mobile	c
phones	c
,	c
because	c
it	i
is	i
very	c
usefull	i
,	c
you	i
get	i
a	i
lot	i
of	i
possiblyties	i
like	c

tickets	c
,	c
control	i
your	i
home	i
technic	i
and	c
many	c
authers	i

Mobile	c
communication	c
is	c
a	c
key	c
to	c
sucsess	i
in	c
all	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

I	c
can	c
travel	c
only	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
I	c
have	i
holidays	i
from	i
my	i
work	i
only	i
in	c
this	c
month	c
.	c

By	i
the	c
Accomodation	i
at	c
the	c
Camp	i
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
the	c
tents	c
,	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
something	c
different	c
wich	i
you	c
do	c
n't	c
make	i
everyday	i
!	c

Then	c
the	c
activities	c
that	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
do	c
are	c
Singing	i
and	c
Swimming	i
.	c

Singing	i
because	c
it	c
's	c
my	c
favourite	c
hobby	c
and	c
I	c
grew	c
up	c
with	c
it	c
and	c
Swimming	i
because	c
I	c
like	c
water	c
and	c
the	c
feeling	c
that	c
you	c
have	c
when	c
you	c
are	c
in	c
it	c
.	c

Another	c
reason	c
for	c
swimming	i
is	c
that	c
I	c
'm	c
good	c
at	c
it	c
because	c
a	c
few	c
years	c
ago	c
I	c
had	c
lessons	c
,	c
where	c
I	c
learn	i
very	i
good	i
swimming	i
.	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
hearing	i
from	c
you	c
.	c

yours	c
faithfuly	i
,	c

Everybody	c
likes	c
shopping	c
!	c

But	c
shopping	c
is	c
n't	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

Sometimes	c
it	c
is	c
n't	c
so	c
easy	c
to	c
find	c
what	c
you	c
need	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
:	c
you	c
have	i
in	i
your	i
memory	i
a	c
great	c
pair	c
of	c
shoes	c
that	c
you	c
have	i
seen	i
last	c
week	c
in	c
a	c
shop	c
.	c

Now	c
you	c
will	i
by	i
it	c
but	c
it	c
's	c
nowhere	c
to	c
find	i
!	c

That	c
's	c
a	c
pity	c
!	c

Dear	c
Jane	c
Clark	c
,	c

I	c
have	c
spent	c
two	c
days	c
on	c
it	c
which	c
was	c
exciting	c
.	c

The	c
name	c
of	c
the	c
event	c
,	c
International	c
Arts	c
Festival	c
,	c
is	c
great	i
idea	c
actually	c
,	c
but	c
there	c
were	c
stars	c
and	c
artists	c
only	i
from	i
six	c
countries	c
apart	i
from	i
your	i
advertisement	i
.	c

However	c
,	c
there	i
were	i
some	c
concert	c
halls	c
were	c
too	c
small	c
.	c

As	c
well	c
as	c
that	c
,	c
I	i
expect	i
you	i
plays	i
and	i
films	i
are	i
performed	i
more	i
.	c

Even	c
if	c
the	c
majority	c
of	c
my	c
friends	c
had	c
a	c
good	c
time	c
there	c
I	c
saw	c
some	c
people	c
would	i
anticipate	i
it	i
,	i
because	i
there	i
were	i
many	i
people	i
who	i
were	i
impressed	i
in	i
it	i
.	i

At	c
that	c
time	c
I	c
was	c
lucky	c
and	c
also	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
recommand	i
other	i
friends	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

Nowadays	c
while	c
my	c
country	c
is	c
developing	c
,	c
most	c
people	c
are	c
very	c
busy	c
,	c
so	c
they	c
ca	c
n't	c
bring	c
up	c
their	c
children	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
if	c
students	c
behave	c
wrongly	c
at	c
school	c
,	c
they	c
will	c
have	c
some	c
punishments	c
even	c
up	c
to	c
now	c
.	c

Apart	c
from	c
that	c
,	c
at	c
home	c
,	c
children	c
are	c
not	c
allowed	c
to	c
use	c
impolite	c
words	c
and	c
on	c
weekend	i
they	c
have	c
to	c
help	c
parents	c
to	c
do	c
some	c
chores	c
.	c

But	c
people	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
change	c
life	i
style	i
in	c
their	c
house	c
because	c
there	c
have	i
n't	i
been	i
convenient	c
appliaces	i
in	c
their	c
house	i
yet	c
.	c

Looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c

Dear	c
Madam/Sir	c
,	c

Secondly	c
,	c
in	c
your	c
advertisement	c
the	c
time	c
of	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
19:30	c
and	c
in	c
reallity	i
the	c
show	c
has	i
started	i
at	c
20:15	c
and	c
the	c
discount	c
was	c
not	c
available	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
visit	c
you	i
theatre	c
restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
already	c
closed	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
very	c
good	c
to	c
have	c
a	i
science	c
and	c
technology	c
because	c
it	i
can	c
really	c
affects	i
our	c
lives	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
20	i
years	c
ago	c
,	c
people	c
who	c
were	c
affected	c
by	c
the	c
AIDS	c
Virus	c
could	c
n't	c
live	c
more	c
than	c
two	c
or	c
three	c
years	c
,	c
but	c
now	c
with	c
the	c
new	c
science	c
,	c
there	c
is	i
several	c
therapi	i
and	c
now	c
people	c
affected	c
by	c
this	c
virus	c
can	c
live	c
many	c
years	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
you	c
can	c
do	c
a	c
lot	c
of	i
think	i
now	c
than	c
before	c
with	c
the	i
techonology	i
.	c

Why	c
not	c

The	c
purpose	c
of	c
this	c
letter	c
is	c
just	c
to	c
let	c
you	c
know	c
my	c
opinion	c
of	c
the	c
event	c
.	c

Nevertheless	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
some	c
suggestions	c
that	c
may	c
be	c
profitable	i
for	c
next	c
year	c
's	c
Festival	i
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
thinking	c
about	c
changing	c
the	c
location	c
because	c
,	c
as	c
you	c
probably	c
already	c
know	c
,	c
some	c
concert	c
halls	c
were	c
not	c
big	c
enough	c
to	c
let	c
everybody	c
who	c
wanted	c
go	i
in	c
.	c

Independent	c
Student	c
Magazine	c

Here	c
is	c
my	c
article	c
.	c

Some	c
examples	c
could	c
be	c
delivering	c
pizzas	c
or	c
newspapers	c
,	c
working	c
as	c
a	c
bartender	c
throug	i
the	i
nights	i
,	c
cleaning	c
services	c
,	c
etc.	c
I	c
usually	c
call	c
these	c
jobs	c
non-	i
cualified	i
positions	c
.	c

What	c
it	i
really	c
makes	c
us	c
,	c
the	c
students	c
,	c
upset	c
,	c
is	c
to	i
find	i
the	c
perfect	c
job	c
.	c

To	c
be	c
more	c
technically	i
and	c
specifically	i
,	c
we	c
need	c
a	c
very	c
flexible	c
job	c
,	c
wich	i
gives	c
independence	i
and	c
allow	i
us	c
to	c
stop	c
working	c
when	c
we	c
are	c
not	c
able	c
to	c
,	c
for	c
example	c
during	c
the	c
exams	c
period	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
know	c
that	c
that	c
point	c
is	c
not	c
easy	c
,	c
although	c
we	c
are	c
still	c
students	c
,	c
the	c
most	c
suitable	c
job	c
for	c
us	c
should	i
be	c
a	c
position	c
related	c
with	i
our	c
carreer	i
.	c

Next	c
year	c
I	c
expect	c
myself	i
finishing	i
my	c
studies	c
in	c
LAW	c
.	c

And	c
by	c
that	c
time	c
I	c
will	c
have	i
already	i
some	c
experience	c
,	c
so	c
that	c
I	c
will	c
more	i
easily	i
able	i
to	i
apply	i
for	c
a	c
really	c
good	c
job	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Manager	c

With	c
reference	c
to	c
the	c
show	c
last	c
week	c
.	i

In	c
the	c
advertisement	c
,	c
it	c
state	i
that	c
the	c
actor	c
for	i
this	c
show	c
is	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
TINA	c
TRUELOVE	c
.	c

The	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
ended	c
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
it	i
was	c
n't	c
a	c
perfect	c
evening	c
,	i
I	c
did	c
n't	c
enjoy	c
it	c
at	c
all	c
due	c
to	c
the	c
failure	i
advertisement	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

As	c
a	c
result	c
Mallory	c
had	c
been	c
arrested	c
by	c
the	c
police	c
two	c
years	c
ago	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
he	c
had	c
to	c
serve	c
a	c
life	c
sentences	i
.	c

He	c
ran	c
away	c
.	c

By	c
the	c
time	c
he	c
got	c
out	c
of	c
the	c
building	c
,	c
the	c
cops	c
was	i
ever	i
where	i
but	c
as	c
long	c
as	c
Mallory	c
is	c
alive	c
,	c
he	c
wo	c
n't	c
be	c
arrested	c
,	c
with	c
his	c
unpredicatable	i
mind	c
.	c

He	c
ran	c
into	c
the	c
old	c
build	i
,	c
and	c
hidden	i
a	c
diamond	c
in	c
there	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
having	c
a	c
week	c
's	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
when	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
and	c
see	c
a	c
musical	c
show	i
.	c

Moreover	c
an	c
English	c
friend	c
of	c
mine	c
had	c
told	c
me	c
that	c
it	c
would	c
purely	i
be	c
a	c
good	c
show	c
as	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
was	c
a	c
very	c
good	c
actor	c
.	c

So	c
on	c
Saturday	c
,	c
June	c
7	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
there	c
for	c
the	c
7:30	c
pm	c
show	c
and	c
here	c
are	c
my	c
reasons	c
for	c
complaining	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
there	c
were	c
no	c
discounts	c
available	c
as	i
stated	i
in	c
your	c
advertisement	c
,	c
not	c
even	c
for	c
students	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
pay	c
for	c
a	c
full-price	c
ticket	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
wait	c
until	c
8:00	c
pm	c
before	c
being	c
able	c
to	c
have	i
a	c
seat	c
and	c
the	c
show	c
finally	c
beginned	i
at	c
8:15	c
!	c

No	c
need	c
to	c
say	c
how	c
much	c
I	c
was	c
disappointed	c
to	c
see	c
that	c
another	c
actor	c
was	c
performing	c
instead	c
of	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
the	c
actor	c
did	c
n't	c
seem	c
to	c
have	c
rehearsed	c
the	c
role	c
very	c
much	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

At	c
that	c
time	c
,	c
I	c
used	c
to	c
buy	c
a	c
lotery	i
ticket	c
once	c
a	c
week	c
and	c
I	c
sometimes	c
won	c
small	c
amounts	c
.	c

One	c
day	c
,	c
while	c
I	c
was	c
checking	c
my	c
weekly	c
ticket	c
,	c
I	c
found	c
out	c
that	c
I	c
had	c
five	c
numbers	c
out	c
of	c
six	c
so	c
that	c
I	c
would	c
surely	c
get	c
a	c
substancial	i
amount	c
of	c
money	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
was	c
too	c
excited	c
to	c
keep	c
it	c
secret	c
so	c
I	c
told	c
Pat	c
that	c
I	c
had	c
won	c
a	c
prize	c
for	c
five	c
correct	c
numbers	c
and	c
had	c
her	c
swear	c
not	c
to	c
tell	c
anyone	c
.	c

No	i
longer	i
after	c
,	c
they	c
were	c
asking	c
me	c
to	c
pay	i
a	c
coffee	c
or	c
lunch	c
for	c
them	c
;	c
some	c
proposed	c
to	i
go	i
shopping	c
,	c
others	c
to	i
go	i
to	c
the	c
cinema	c
and	c
the	i
restaurant	c
.	c

Endly	i
came	i
the	i
end	i
of	i
the	i
week	i
and	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
lotery	i
office	c
to	c
check	i
the	c
amount	c
I	c
had	c
won	c
.	c

SO	c
I	c
told	c
my	c
friend	c
Pat	c
how	c
much	c
I	c
had	c
won	c
and	c
the	c
following	c
day	c
at	c
school	c
,	i
everybody	c
were	i
just	c
the	c
same	c
as	c
they	c
ever	c
were	c
with	c
me	c
...	c

The	c
Show	i
is	c
Tuesday	i
,	c
March	c
14th	c
from	i
10.00-19.00	c
in	c
the	c
Central	c
Exibition	i
Hall	c
.	c

They	c
gona	i
show	i
a	i
latest	c
fashion	i
,	c
leisure	c
and	c
sports	c
wear	c
,	c
make	i
up	i
and	c
new	c
hairstyles	c
.	c

We	c
are	c
young	c
and	c
we	c
all	i
are	i
interested	c
in	c
fashion	c
.	c

For	i
the	i
students	i
it	i
is	i
free	i
.	c

We	c
thought	c
that	c
we	c
could	c
change	c
the	c
programme	c
this	c
way	c
:	c
we	c
could	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
Science	c
Museum	c
Wednesday	i
afternoon	c
instead	c
of	c
Tuesday	c
.	c

I	c
really	c
hope	c
that	c
you	c
gona	i
consider	i
our	c
request	c
.	c

My	c
dear	c
brother	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
normal	c
Saturday	c
morning	c
.	c

My	c
mam	c
was	c
cooking	c
and	c
my	c
dad	c
was	c
sitting	c
in	c
his	c
chair	c
reading	c
a	c
book	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
doing	c
my	c
homeworks	i
when	c
I	c
heard	c
an	c
explosion	c
.	c

My	c
first	c
reaction	c
was	c
to	c
put	i
him	c
on	c
the	c
floor	c
so	c
that	c
the	c
fire	c
could	c
stop	i
.	c

He	c
was	c
screaming	c
because	c
he	c
had	i
such	i
a	i
big	i
pain	c
.	c

We	c
were	c
shocked	c
,	i
we	i
all	i
did	i
n't	i
know	i
what	c
to	c
do	c
.	c

I	c
really	c
like	i
my	c
brother	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
do	c
anything	c
possible	c
to	c
save	c
him	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
on	i
the	c
name	c
of	c
all	c
the	c
students	c
who	c
will	c
go	c
to	i
the	c
London	i
's	i
trip	c
.	c

This	c
show	c
is	c
going	c
on	c
all	c
day	c
on	c
March	c
14th	c
.	c

Anyway	c
,	c
as	c
students	c
we	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
much	c
money	c
to	c
spend	c
on	c
shopping	c
and	c
the	c
good	c
thing	c
is	c
that	c
it	c
wo	c
n't	c
affect	c
your	c
budget	c
at	c
all	c
as	c
the	c
entrance	c
fees	c
are	c
free	c
for	c
students	c
.	c

Because	c
of	c
us	c
!	c

I	c
know	c
that	c
everyone	c
is	c
excited	c
about	c
what	c
happened	c
to	i
Michael	c
Douglas	c
'	c
wedding	c
or	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
life	c
the	c
President	c
of	c
The	i
United	c
States	c
is	c
living	c
but	c
sometimes	c
it	c
's	c
going	c
a	c
bit	c
to	i
far	c
.	c

Those	c
movie	c
stars	c
or	c
politicians	c
may	c
have	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
money	c
,	c
may	c
do	c
whatever	c
they	c
want	c
but	c
what	c
is	c
the	c
price	c
to	c
pay	c
?	c

Would	c
you	c
like	c
to	c
live	c
a	c
life	c
like	c
that	c
,	c
every	c
time	c
you	c
make	c
a	c
wrong	c
step	c
,	c
the	c
whole	c
world	c
is	c
looking	c
at	c
you	c
,	c
judging	c
you	c
.	i

It	c
must	c
be	c
very	c
exhausted	i
to	c
have	c
the	c
medias	i
around	c
you	c
days	i
and	i
nights	i
because	c
you	c
ca	c
n't	c
be	c
yourself	c
,	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
show	c
your	c
best	c
side	c
and	c
character	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
it	i
should	c
be	c
a	c
rule	c
which	c
let	i
the	c
medias	i
approach	c
famous	c
people	c
almost	c
anywhere	c
except	c
in	c
their	c
private	c
home	c
to	c
leave	c
them	c
at	c
least	c
one	c
place	c
to	c
feel	c
safe	c
.	c

Last	c
Saturday	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
your	c
theatre	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
new	c
musical	c
show	c
;	i
"	c
Over	c
The	c
Rainbow	c
"	c

That	c
disappointed	c
both	i
me	c
and	c
the	c
people	c
who	c
just	c
went	c
to	c
see	c
him	c
.	c

All	c
people	i
there	c
gave	i
the	c
same	c
amount	c
of	c
money	c
.	c

After	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
restaurant	c
in	c
the	c
theatre	c
to	c
eat	c
something	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
being	c
cleaned	c
that	c
day	c
.	c

Your	i
faithfully	c
,	c

Rod	c
was	c
a	c
happy	c
man	c
at	c
that	c
times	i
.	c

One	c
day	c
,	c
while	c
he	c
was	c
gardening	c
,	c
he	c
saw	c
an	c
old	c
lady	c
being	c
kidnapped	c
by	c
some	c
strange	c
man	i
,	c
who	c
he	c
ran	c
after	c
and	i
caught	i
one	i
of	i
whom	i
.	c

Just	c
then	c
,	c
the	c
strange	c
man	c
took	c
out	c
his	c
gun	c
.	c

Nobody	c
saw	c
or	i
nobody	c
heard	c
what	c
had	c
happened	c
.	c

Rod	c
told	c
this	c
to	c
nobody	c
,	c
except	c
Pat	c
,	c
his	c
best	c
friend	c
.	c

He	c
then	i
was	i
killed	c
by	c
the	c
other	c
man	c
who	c
escaped	c
that	c
day	c
and	c
was	c
caught	c
soon	c
afterwards	c
.	c

Rod	c
's	c
grave	c
is	c
now	c
in	c
prison	c
.	c

Never	c
give	c
your	c
secrets	c
away	c
,	c

And	c
everyone	c
was	c
surprised	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

To	c
be	c
honest	c
I	c
had	c
doubts	c
about	c
winning	c
the	c
competition	c
,	c
because	c
in	c
spite	c
of	c
I	i
think	i
I	c
did	c
well	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
play	c
against	c
a	i
very	c
strong	c
competence	i
.	c

The	c
idea	c
about	i
going	c
to	c
California	c
for	c
2	c
weeks	c
make	i
me	c
feel	c
very	c
excited	c
.	c

According	i
with	i
your	c
letter	c
,	c
July	c
is	c
the	c
period	i
of	i
time	c
suits	i
me	c
best	c
.	c

About	c
the	c
accommodation	c
I	i
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
never	c
done	c
it	c
before	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
really	c
fancy	c
the	c
idea	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
really	c
surprise	i
about	c
how	c
many	c
activities	c
can	c
be	c
practised	i
in	c
this	c
place	c
.	c

If	c
is	i
possible	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
swimming	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
swimming	c
.	c

On	i
one	i
hand	i
I	c
think	c
that	c
climbing	c
sounds	c
very	c
exciting	c
,	c
but	c
on	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
it	c
scares	c
me	c
a	c
lot	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
will	c
play	c
tennis	c
.	c

By	c
the	c
way	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
if	c
the	c
level	i
of	i
life	i
in	c
USA	i
is	c
similar	c
to	c
UK	i
.	c

Another	c
point	c
is	c
about	c
the	i
clothes	c
,	i
could	i
you	c
confirm	c
me	i
that	c
I	c
'll	c
need	c
summer	c
clothes	c
?	c

Please	c
if	i
you	c
need	c
further	c
information	c
from	c
me	c
,	c
do	c
n't	c
hesitate	c
to	c
contact	c
me	c
again	c
.	c

In	c
fact	c
when	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
feel	c
very	c
happy	c
I	c
decide	c
to	c
do	i
shopping	c
to	c
try	c
to	c
cher	i
myself	c
up	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
like	c
when	i
I	c
have	c
to	c
try	c
on	c
differents	i
sizes	c
because	c
the	c
small	c
does	i
n't	c
fit	c
on	i
my	i
body	i
because	c
I	c
have	c
got	i
weight	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
women	c
,	c
in	c
general	c
,	c
are	c
very	c
impulsive	c
purchasing	i
things	c
.	c

But	c
from	c
another	c
point	c
of	c
view	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
silly	c
to	c
be	c
earning	c
money	c
and	c
do	i
n't	i
spend	i
it	c
as	c
you	c
want	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Ryan	c
:	c

Thank	i
's	i
for	c
accept	i
me	c
in	c
the	c
competition	c
.	c

I	c
hear	c
that	c
the	c
competition	c
there	c
are	i
very	c
good	i
,	c
and	c
the	i
Camp	c
California	c
is	c
very	c
famous	c
for	c
his	i
competitions	c
.	c

Another	c
thing	c
is	c
my	c
accommodation	c
I	i
prefer	c
to	c
have	c
log	c
cabins	c
because	c
it	c
's	c
easyeast	i
for	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
will	c
choose	c
for	c
activities	i
tennis	c
and	c
swimming	c
,	i
I	c
'm	c
good	c
on	i
tennis	c
because	c
I	c
play	i
since	c
1990	c
and	c
I	c
loved	i
it	c
and	c
swimming	i
because	c
I	c
like	c
to	c
swim	c
and	c
I	c
've	c
been	c
two	i
competition	i
and	c
I	c
won	c
both	c
.	c

Your	i
sincerely	c

Lola	c
Villanueva	c
.	c

For	c
me	c
went	i
to	i
shop	i
it	i
's	i
not	c
the	c
best	c
thing	c
I	c
can	c
do	c
.	c

Well	c
I	c
think	i
the	c
opposite	c
like	i
a	c
year	c
before	i
but	c
recently	c
I	c
think	i
this	c
because	c
I	c
see	c
all	c
the	c
people	c
to	i
go	i
shopping	c
they	i
do	c
n't	c
realised	i
that	c
they	i
are	i
outside	c
in	c
the	c
real	c
world	c
poor	i
people	c
who	c
need	c
that	c
money	c
and	i
they	c
are	c
only	c
spent	i
on	c
material	c
things	c
,	i
you	i
would	i
put	c
you	i
money	c
in	c
the	c
bank	c
because	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
need	c
it	c
now	c
,	c
but	c
tomorrow	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
.	c

At	i
the	c
rest	c
of	c
you	c
who	c
do	c
n't	c
understand	c
this	c
it	i
's	c
on	i
your	i
memories	i
to	c
keep	c
shopping	c
and	c
spending	c
all	c
your	c
money	c
on	c
things	c
that	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
really	c
need	c
.	c

And	c
sometimes	c
I	c
get	c
bored	c
when	c
I	c
'm	c
shopping	c
because	c
now	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
really	c
enjoy	c
it	c
.	c

Bye	c
and	c
think	c
on	i
this	c
.	c

Lola	c
Villanueva	c
J	c
.	c

With	c
reference	c
to	c
the	c
letter	c
from	c
you	c
.	i

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
tents	c
to	c
long	i
cabins	c
because	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
more	c
interesting	c
and	c
exciting	c
than	i
live	i
in	c
long	i
cabins	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
much	c
about	c
there	i
,	i
is	i
there	c
anything	c
should	i
I	i
bring	c
with	c
me	c
?	c

What	c
is	c
the	c
weather	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
like	c
?	c

And	c
how	c
much	c
meney	i
should	i
I	i
have	i
?	c

If	c
you	c
have	c
chilldren	i
,	c
you	c
will	c
know	c
it	i
very	c
well	c
when	i
you	c
are	c
busy	c
doing	c
something	c
and	c
the	c
chilldren	i
see	c
something	c
they	c
want	c
to	c
have	c
,	c
they	c
will	c
do	c
everything	c
they	c
can	c
do	c
to	c
make	c
you	c
buy	c
it	c
for	c
them	c
,	c
sometime	i
they	c
even	c
cry	c
or	c
shout	c
to	i
you	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
really	c
anoy	i
you	i
.	c

Anyway	c
,	c
even	i
in	c
families	c
they	c
usauly	i
have	c
this	c
problem	c
that	c
when	c
they	c
bought	i
a	c
new	c
one	i
,	c
suddenly	c
they	c
have	c
a	c
problem	c
that	i
where	c
the	c
old	c
one	c
is	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
and	c
that	c
is	c
the	c
begining	i
of	c
argument	i
between	c
mother	c
and	c
farther	i
or	c
parents	c
and	c
chilldren	i

My	c

I	c
spent	c
a	c
few	c
days	c
in	c
London	c
,	i
I	c
visited	c
you	i
theatre	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
this	c
complaining	i
is	c
not	c
only	c
about	c
the	c
actor	c
,	c
who	i
ever	i
,	i
the	c
problem	c
is	c
that	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
too	c
late	c
.	c

I	i
bought	c
my	c
tickets	c
,	c
I	c
noticed	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
have	i
any	c
discounts	i
as	i
it	i
was	c
written	c

for	i

to	c
improve	c
the	c
way	c
they	c
live	c
their	c

Nowadays	c
,	c
it	c
's	c
very	c
common	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
computer	c
at	i
your	c
house	c
,	c
and	c
when	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
do	c
a	i
homework	c
,	c
you	c
can	c
type	c
it	c
on	c

2000	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
waiting	i
this	c
letter	c
re	i
fearing	i
to	c
the	c
show	c
"	c
over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
you	c
presented	i
the	i
10	c
of	c
this	c
month	c
.	c

But	c
,	c
the	c
quality	c
of	c
this	c
show	c
was	c
n't	c
what	c
you	c
let	i
understand	i
,	c
an	i
I	c
feel	c
realy	i
disappointed	c
by	c
it	c
.	c

Then	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
student	c
,	c
and	c
when	c
I	c
bought	c
my	c
ticket	c
,	c
there	c
was	i
n't	i
any	c
discounts	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
hoped	i
that	c
I	c
could	c
have	c
a	i
diner	i
in	c
the	c
restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
but	c
,	c
to	c
make	c
my	i
totally	c
disappointed	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
find	c
another	c
restaurant	c
at	c
22.00	c
.	c

In	c
fact	c
,	c
I	c
did	c
this	c
kind	c
of	c
studies	i
because	c
of	c
my	c
interests	c
in	c
programming	c
.	c

The	c
problem	c
is	c
that	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
keep	c
calm	c
during	c
an	c
exam	c
to	i
succeed	i
.	c

That	c
's	c
why	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
hack	c
the	i
teacher	c
's	c
computers	c
to	c
change	c
all	c
my	c
marks	c
.	c

And	c
when	c
he	c
was	c
totally	c
drunk	c
,	c
he	c
started	c
speaking	c
.	c

Then	c
,	c
the	c
teachers	c
made	c
copies	c
of	c
their	c
file	i
,	c
and	c
my	c
project	c
was	c
n't	c
possible	c
anymore	c
.	c

And	c
I	c
think	c
I	c
will	c
still	c
be	c
there	i
next	c
year	c
.	c

Lausanne	c
,	c
the	c
20th	c
of	c
May	c
2000	c

Two	c
weeks	c
ago	c
,	c
I	c
spent	c
a	c
week	c
in	c
your	c
fabulous	c
city	c
of	c
London	c
with	c
my	c
friend	c
.	c

Surprisily	i
,	c
there	c
were	c
no	c
discounds	i
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
instead	c
of	c
19:30	c
,	i
it	c
's	c
a	c
theatre	c
but	i
not	c
a	c
concert	c
hall	c
!	c
!	c
!	c
!	c

Thirdly	c
,	c
we	c
were	c
astonished	c
about	i
the	c
actors	c
whose	i
we	c
know	c
from	c
others	i
musical	i
.	c

Why	c
did	c
you	c
not	c
change	c
the	c
name	i
of	i
your	c
advertisement	c
?	c

In	c
the	c
end	c
,	c
the	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
you	c
did	c
n't	c
have	c
enough	c
staffs	i
,	i
this	i
evening	c
!	c
!	c

Nothing	i
was	i
serious	i
.	c

In	c
advance	c
,	c
thank	c
you	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

When	c
her	c
best	c
friend	c
,	c
Scala	c
,	c
asked	c
her	c
an	i
idea	c
to	c
surprise	c
her	c
husband	c
because	i
she	i
's	i
pregnant	c
,	c
Pat	c
put	c
her	c
feets	i
in	i
the	i
plate	i
just	c
before	c
Scala	c
's	c
husband	c
got	i
the	c
surprise	c
.	c

Everybody	c
knows	c
everybody	c
.	c

Pat	c
and	c
Scala	c
have	c
been	c
good	c
friends	c
for	c
10	c
years	c
,	c
their	c
husband	i
too	i
.	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
Friday	i
suny	i
afternoon	c
,	c
Scala	c
was	c
really	c
excited	c
to	i
tell	i
her	c
the	c
new	i
.	c

He	c
was	c
so	c
amazed	c
and	c
asked	c
to	i
repeat	c
.	i

She	c
just	c
thought	i
it	c
would	i
be	i
a	c
secret	c
,	c
she	i
came	i
really	c
embarassed	i
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
,	c

Many	c
thanks	c
for	c
the	c
programme	c
you	c
have	c
organised	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
really	c
interesting	c
and	c
diversity	i
at	c
the	c
same	c
time	c
.	c

That	i
is	c
in	c
the	c
central	i
Exhibition	c
Hall	c
,	c
near	c
the	c
hotel	c
,	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
only	i
about	c
fashion	c
:	c
latest	i
fashions	c
,	c
leisure	c
and	c
sports	c
wear	c
,	c
make	i
up	i
and	c
hairstyles	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
could	c
be	c
very	c
interesting	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
free	c
for	c
students	c
(	c
what	i
is	c
really	c
good	c
)	c
.	c

And	c
,	c
as	c
you	c
know	c
we	c
all	c
are	c
interested	c
in	c
fashion	c
.	c

In	i
my	i
opinion	i
,	i
I	c
would	c
suggest	c
to	i
go	i
to	c
the	c
show	c
instead	c
of	c
the	c
National	c
Art	c
Gallery	c
because	c
we	c
could	c
go	c
there	c
another	c
time	c
.	c

Or	c
,	i
going	c
to	c
the	c
show	c
on	c
wensday	i
morning	c
and	c
on	i
the	c
afternoon	c
,	c
we	c
can	c
choose	c
between	c
free	c
time	c
or	c
National	i
Art	c
Gallery	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

Suddenly	c
,	c
I	c
felt	c
very	c
tired	c
and	c
decided	c
to	c
go	c
home	c
.	c

I	c
took	c
her	c
in	c
my	c
arms	c
and	c
opened	c
the	c
door	c
:	c
my	c
mother	c
was	c
sitting	c
in	c
a	c
chair	c
,	c
reading	c
a	c
book	c
,	c
with	c
blood	c
all	c
around	c
her	c
.	c

They	c
found	c
hime	i
two	c
months	c
after	i
and	c
six	c
months	c
after	i
he	c
was	c
in	c
jail	c
.	c

To	c
forget	c
everything	c
,	c
I	c
moved	c
to	c
Irkind	c
with	c
my	c
sister	c
in	i
a	c
small	c
house	c
in	c
the	c
countryside	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c

Firstly	c
we	c
arrived	c
at	c
19.15	c
to	c
be	c
in	c
time	c
for	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
which	c
should	c
have	c
started	c
at	c
19.30	c
.	c

However	c
it	i
started	c
at	c
20.15	c
and	c
we	c
were	c
all	c
very	c
disappointed	c
.	c

Imagine	c
how	c
disappointed	c
we	c
got	i
when	c
we	c
found	c
out	c
that	c
he	c
had	c
been	c
replaced	c
.	c

Besides	c
,	c
when	c
we	c
wanted	c
to	c
buy	c
our	c
tickets	c
we	c
were	c
hoping	c
that	c
the	c
discounting	i
was	c
available	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
and	c
we	c
could	c
n't	c
afford	c
bying	i
everyone	c
a	c
ticket	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
after	i
the	i
show	i
we	i
had	i
planed	i
to	i
eat	i
diner	i
at	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
and	c
we	c
were	c
very	c
disappointed	c
when	c
it	c
turned	c
out	c
to	c
closed	i
.	c

I	c
was	c
send	i
a	c
letter	c
in	c
which	c
it	c
was	c
written	c
that	c
the	c
director	c
wanted	c
to	c
meet	c
me	c
and	c
my	c
parents	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
unable	c
to	c
image	i
what	c
would	c
happen	c
to	c
me	c
if	c
my	c
parents	c
knew	c
what	c
I	c
had	c
stolen	c
.	c

Mrs	c

In	c
the	c

I	c
add	c
that	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
an	i
accomodation	i
in	c
a	c
tent	c
,	c
even	c
though	c
it	c
is	c
not	c
very	c
comfortable	c

because	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
put	c
myself	c
to	c
the	c
test	c
by	c
living	c
in	c
a	i
condition	i
I	c
am	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c

Most	c
of	c
the	c
students	c
agree	c
in	c
saying	c
that	c
two	i
are	i
the	i
main	c
features	c
of	i
our	c
daily	c
life	c
at	c
school	c
which	c
should	c
be	c
filmed	c
:	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
very	c
funny	c
to	c
dwell	i
on	c
us	c
working	c
and	c
speaking	c
together	c
without	i
the	c
help	c
of	c
the	c
teacher	c
to	i
show	i
our	i
efforts	i
and	i
sometimes	i
successful	i
and	i
sometimes	i
ridiculous	i

also	c

Mr.	c
Manager	c

The	c
porpouse	i
of	c
this	c
letter	c
is	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
my	c
experience	c
with	c
the	c
musical	c
show	i
"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
,	c
wich	i
really	c
disapointed	i
me	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
there	c
were	c
no	c
diccounts	i
avaible	i
as	i
it	i
said	i
on	i
the	c
anouncement	i
so	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
pay	c
the	c
original	c
price	c
wich	i
was	c
n't	c
cheap	c
at	c
all	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
as	c
you	c
can	c
see	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
my	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
at	c
all	i
that	i
's	i
why	c
I	c
demand	c
you	c
to	i
send	i
me	c
my	c

How	c
has	c
modern	c

afected	i
my	c
daily	c

?	c

That	c
is	c
not	c

from	c

From	c

Dear	c
Mrs.	c
Ryan	c
,	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
the	c
only	c
month	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
visit	c
the	c
U.S.A.	c
is	c
July	c
due	c
to	c
the	c
fact	c
that	c
I	c

another	c

for	c
August	c

Second	i
of	i

I	c
would	c

in	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
some	c
questions	c

What	c
type	c
of	c
clothes	c
should	c
I	c
take	c
and	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
would	c
be	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

Well	c
,	c
I	c
took	c
my	c
chance	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
chosen	c
to	c
help	c
at	c
Michael	c
Jackson	c
's	c
concert	c
.	c

The	c
event	c
took	c
place	c
a	c
month	c
ago	c
in	c
the	c
Rock	c
Stadium	c
.	c

There	c
was	i
about	c
100	c
000	c
people	c
.	c

We	c
had	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
things	c
to	c
do	c
.	c

Acctually	i
,	c
they	c
put	c
me	c
very	c
close	c
to	c
the	c
stage	c
,	c
in	c
the	c
middle	c
of	c
the	c
real	c
hell	c
.	c

Many	c
people	c
fainted	c
and	c
some	c
of	c
them	c
,	c
the	c
most	c
serious	c
cases	c
,	c
had	c
to	c
be	c
taken	c
to	c
hospital	c
.	c

Despite	c
this	c
fact	c
,	c
the	c
atmosphere	c
was	c
terrific	c
.	c

We	c
had	c
to	c
order	c
taxis	c
for	c
them	c
as	c
they	c
did	c
n't	c
have	c
mobile	c
telephones	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
they	c
were	c
very	c
nice	c
people	c
.	c

You	c
should	c
also	c
try	c
.	i

Best	c
wishes	c
,	c

Ursula	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
what	c
you	c
have	c
written	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
on	i
the	c
newspaper	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
disappointed	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
horrible	c
evening	c
I	c
have	c
had	c
,	i
I	c
was	c
on	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
and	c
I	c
did	c
not	c
have	c
time	i
enough	i
to	c
spend	c
there	c
,	c
but	c
when	c
you	c
said	c
that	c
show	i
was	c
the	c
best	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
go	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
bought	c
my	c
ticket	c
I	c
asked	c
for	c
a	c
discount	c
and	c
they	c
said	c
it	i
was	i
not	i
available	c
.	c

I	c
arrived	c
at	c
the	c
theatre	c
in	c
time	c
and	c
the	c
musical	c
show	i
started	c
later	c
than	c
I	c
expected	c
so	c
I	c
was	c
getting	c
nervous	i
because	c
I	c
dislike	i
very	i
much	i
the	i
impuntuality	i
,	c
but	c
that	c
was	c
not	c
all	c
.	c

Really	c
he	c
was	c
bad	c
.	c

Afterwards	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
go	c
for	c
a	c
meal	c
in	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
but	c
It	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

So	c
you	c
can	c
imagine	c
how	c
I	c
felt	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
irritating	c
evening	c
out	c
I	c
had	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
letting	i
down	i
because	i
of	i
your	c
behaviour	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
technology	c
has	c
changed	c
my	c
life	c
and	c
the	c
way	i
of	i
living	i
of	c
almost	c
all	i
people	i
around	c
the	c
world	c
.	c

Our	c
life	i
will	c
be	c
managed	c
by	c
robots	c
and	c
they	c
will	c
replace	c
us	c
in	i
our	i
jobs	i
.	c

So	c
,	c
what	c
are	c
we	c
going	c
to	c
do	c
?	c

There	c
are	c
several	c
reasones	i
why	c
I	c
was	c
n't	c
satisfied	c
with	c
it	c
.	c

Despite	c
it	i
,	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
stared	i
in	c
the	c
performance	c
,	c
which	c
was	c
really	c
disappointing	c
.	c

Lastly	c
,	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

That	c
evening	c
was	c
n't	c
my	c
perfect	c
one	c
out	i
,	c
although	c
it	c
was	c
promised	c
to	c
be	c
so	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
I	c
'll	c
get	c
at	c
least	c
a	c
part	c
of	c
the	c
money	c
I	c
've	c
paid	c
back	c
.	c

During	i
the	c
centuries	c
man	c
's	c
clothes	c
has	i
been	c
changing	c
and	c
even	c
developing	c
in	c
some	c
way	i
.	c

People	c
wore	c
clothes	c
made	c
from	c
metal	c
,	c
which	c
were	c
rather	c
heavy	c
,	c
I	c
suppose	c
.	c

Nowadays	c
people	c
wear	c
more	c
common	i
clothes	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
we	c
can	c
make	i
a	c
conclusion	c
:	c
during	i
the	c
centuries	c
man	c
's	c
clothes	c
have	c
been	c
becoming	c
less	c
heavy	c
and	c
luxurious	c
and	c
more	c
common	i
.	c

People	c
's	c
clothes	c
have	c
been	c
changing	c
from	c
metalwear	i
to	c
shorts	c
and	c
miniskirts	c
.	c

That	c
's	c
why	c
I	c
suppose	c
,	i
that	c
man	c
's	c
clothes	c
will	c
be	c
becoming	c
more	i
and	i
more	i
light	i
.	c

People	c
wo	c
n't	c
be	c
embarassed	i
to	c
show	c
the	c
beauty	c
of	c
their	c
bodies	c
.	c

Perhaps	c
,	c
clothes	c
will	c
be	c
rather	c
small	c
.	c

Maybe	c
,	c
people	c
will	c
create	c
something	c
even	c
smaller	c
than	c
that	c
.	c

Perhaps	c
,	c
metalwear	i
will	c
become	c
a	c
craze	c
again	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
happy	c
to	c
have	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
of	i
the	c
competition	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
going	c
to	i
clear	i
up	i
some	c
details	c
you	c
asked	c
me	c
in	i
your	c
letter	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
because	c
of	c
my	c
school	c
exam	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
only	c
july	i
.	c

On	i
the	i
other	i
handDuring	i
my	c
stay	c
in	i
Camp	c
California	c
,	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
go	c
swimming	c
because	c
I	c
practice	i
this	c
activitie	i
regularly	c
and	c
I	c
often	c
do	i
competitions	c
:	c
this	c
is	c
one	c
of	c
my	c
hobbies	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
to	c
this	c
,	c
I	c
wish	c
I	i
am	i
going	i
to	i
sail	i
:	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
try	i
it	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
seems	i
to	i
be	i
great	c
!	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

As	c
you	c
asked	c
me	c
in	c
your	c
last	c
letter	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
going	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
more	c
about	c
the	i
last	c
month	c
's	c
pop	c
concert	c
.	c

As	c
soon	c
as	c
all	c
the	c
conections	c
was	i
made	c
,	c
we	c
tested	c
the	c
nivel	i
of	i
the	i
sound	i
:	c
I	c
found	c
it	c
too	c
loud	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
advised	c
them	c
to	c
regular	i
it	c
,	c
and	c
they	c
listed	i
to	c
me	c
!	c

Thus	i
,	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
fantastic	c
afternoon	c
because	c
I	c
like	c
very	i
much	i
music	i
,	c
even	c
if	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
play	c
any	c
music	i
instrument	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
I	c
learnt	c
a	c
lot	c
about	c
music	c
,	c
especially	c
concerning	c
the	i
way	i
of	i
using	i
an	c
instrument	c
.	c

Consequently	c
,	c
I	c
hope	c
I	c
will	c
play	c
an	c
instrument	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
,	c
especially	c
because	c
the	c
group	c
promises	c
me	i
to	c
help	c
me	c
to	c
learn	c
any	c
instrument	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
,	c

My	c
friends	c
have	c
seen	c
an	c
advertisement	c
which	c
is	c
the	i
London	c
fashion	i
and	i
leissure	i
show	i
.	c

it	i
will	c
be	c
held	c
on	c
14th	c
March	c
.	c

We	c
will	c
be	c
given	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
to	c
have	c
fun	c
and	c
look	c
around	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

We	c
would	c
be	c
pleased	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
make	c
a	c
new	c
arrangement	c
in	c
your	c
programme	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c

Yours	c
Sincererly	i

CAN	c
YOU	c
IMAGINE	c
THE	c
NEW	c
YOUR	i
HOUSE	c
?	c

We	c
like	c
them	c
show	i
our	c
life	i
style	i
and	c
of	c
course	c
feel	c
ourself	i
comfortable	c
.	c

it	i
could	c
be	c
as	c
simple	c
as	c
we	c
think	c
.	i

but	c
the	c
imagine	i
of	c
the	c
life	i
style	i
depends	c
on	c
person	i
.	c

Somehow	c
I	c
could	c
say	c
that	c
the	c
main	c
appliance	i
would	c
remain	i
the	c
same	c
working	c
structure	c
.	c

it	i
would	c
be	c
enjoyable	c
to	c
have	c
virtual	c
friends	c
in	c
my	c
house	c
.	c

Although	c
I	c
imagine	c
my	i
house	c
in	c
my	c
future	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
sure	c
I	c
would	c
be	c
suprised	i
when	i
I	c
had	c
them	c

So	c

I	c

Introduction	c
:	c
It	c
seems	c
to	c
me	c
that	c
modern	c
technology	c
has	c
deeply	i
changed	c
our	c
daily	c
life	c

An	i
usefull	i

The	i
personal	c
computer	c
can	c
fastly	i
help	c
you	c
in	c
lots	c
of	c
situations	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
a	c
variety	c
of	c
micro	i
computers	i
are	c
now	c
everywhere	c
such	c
as	c
in	c
your	c
car	c
,	c
on	c
your	c
radio	c
and	c
so	c
on	c

Have	i
a	i
good	i
feeling	i
with	i
it	i

On	i
one	i

the	i
modern	c

BUT	c
NOW	c
FROM	c
THE	c
BEGINNING	c
:	c

AS	c
YOU	c
KNOW	c
I	c
WROTE	c
TO	c
THAT	c
ORGANISATION	c
WHO	i
IS	c
ALWAYS	c
RESPONSBLE	i
FOR	c
BIG	c
EVENTS	c

WHEN	c
I	c
ARRIVED	c
WE	c
FIRST	c
HAD	c
A	c
MEETING	c
.	c

AFTER	c
THE	c
MEETING	c
WE	i
RECIEVED	i
ALL	i
THE	c
SAME	c
CLOTHES	c

BEFORE	c
THE	c
CONCERT	c
WE	c
HAD	c
A	c
BREAK	c
TO	c
EAT	c
SOMETHING	c
AND	c
TO	c
TALK	c
TO	c
EACH	c
OTHER	c
.	c

IT	c
WAS	c
INTERESTING	c
TO	c
SEE	c
THAT	c
ALL	c
PEOPLE	c
HAVE	c
OTHER	i
HOBBIES	c
AND	c
WORK	i

I	c
have	c
recently	c
been	c
to	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
to	c
see	c
a	c
musical	c
show	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
mentioned	c
that	c
there	c
were	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
two	c
starrings	i
but	c
,	c
in	c
fact	c
,	c
only	c
an	i
actor	c
were	i
performing	c
on	i
the	c
show	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
for	c
money	i
back	c
for	i
the	c
ticket	c
due	c
to	c
the	c
disapointing	i
evening	c
out	c
and	c
unreliable	i
advertisement	c
you	c
have	c
created	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c

Nowaday	i
,	c
modern	c
technology	c
is	c
becomming	i
very	i
essential	c
to	c
our	c
daily	c
life	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
no	c
one	c
could	c
communicate	c
on	c
the	c
phone	c
through	i
countries	i
or	i
even	i
through	i
houses	i
as	c
immediate	i
as	c
nowadays	c
.	c

Put	i
it	c
in	c
another	i
words	c
,	c
modern	c
technology	c
has	c
changed	c
our	c
life	c
to	c
became	c
more	c
advanced	c
in	c
every	c
ways	i
.	c

If	c
this	c
continue	i
to	c
happen	c
our	c
life	c
would	i
be	c
very	c
misarable	i
as	c
accident	i
happens	i
all	c
the	c
time	c
.	c

We	c
have	c
just	c
known	i
the	c
programme	c
you	c
prepared	c
for	c
our	c
three-day	c
trip	c
to	c
London	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
many	i
interesting	c
positions	i
in	c
this	c
schedule	c
,	c
especially	c
the	c
river	c
trip	c
to	c
Greenwich	c
,	c
which	c
,	c
we	c
are	c
shure	i
,	c
will	c
be	c
very	c
exciting	c
.	c

There	c
will	c
a	i
lot	c
of	c
show	i
for	i
instance	i
latest	c
fashions	c
,	c
leisure	c
and	c
sports	c
wear	c
,	c
make	i
up	i
and	c
hairstyles	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
it	c
is	c
very	c
important	c
for	c
us	c
to	c
be	c
there	c
and	c
it	c
could	c
be	c
great	i
opportunity	c
,	c
because	c
the	i
entrance	c
is	c
free	c
for	c
students	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
b	i
grateful	c
if	c
you	c
consider	i
our	c
suggestions	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Your	i
sincerelly	i

Suddenly	c
I	c
heard	c
a	c
noice	i
from	c
my	c
garden	c
and	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
know	c
what	c
it	c
was	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
impossible	c
to	c
do	i
it	i
.	c

The	c
outside	c
lights	c
were	c
broken	i
down	i
and	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
see	c
anything	c
.	c

My	c
dog	c
was	c
very	c
angry	c
.	c

After	c
a	c
few	c
minutes	c
I	c
heard	c
steps	c
near	c
my	c
kitchen	i
's	i
window	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
no	c
time	c
to	c
call	c
someone	i
and	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
my	c
kitchen	c
to	c
check	i
what	c
it	c
was	c
.	c

Suddenly	c
someone	c
broke	c
my	c
window	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
no	c
time	c
to	c
think	c
,	i
I	c
kept	i
one	c
of	c
the	c
pots	c
and	c
hit	c
him	c
in	i
his	c
head	c
.	c

One	c
moment	c
later	c
I	c
called	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

The	c
only	c
thing	c
which	c
really	c
disapointed	i
me	c
was	c
a	c
visit	c
in	i
your	c
theatre	c
where	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
musical	c
'	c
over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
'	c
,	c
after	c
I	c
read	c
the	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

The	c
things	c
that	c
really	c
dissapointed	i
me	c
were	c
that	c
you	c
said	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
were	c
suposed	i
to	i
be	i
the	c
actors	c
but	c
they	c
were	c
n't	c
,	c
different	c
actors	c
played	c
and	c
to	c
be	c
honest	c
they	c
made	c
the	c
hole	i
show	c
very	c
bad	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
you	c
will	c
understand	c
that	c
and	c
looking	i
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Since	c
everyone	c
can	c
afford	c
modern	c
technology	c
the	i
life	i
of	i
everyone	i
in	c
the	c
more	c
developed	c
countries	c
has	c
changed	c
completly	i
.	c

If	c
we	c
than	i
want	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
work	c
we	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
to	c
get	c
our	c
horse	c
,	c
no	c
,	c
we	c
get	c
the	c
car	c
keys	c
and	c
go	c
where	i
ever	i
we	c
want	c
to	c
.	c

But	c
we	c
ca	c
n't	c
say	c
the	c
new	c
technology	c
has	c
done	i
just	i
bad	c
things	c
in	c
our	c
life	c
because	c
otherwise	c
we	c
could	c
n't	c
have	c
made	c
such	c
progress	c
in	c
all	c
the	c
sciences	c
and	c
other	c
subjects	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
express	c
my	c
annoyance	c
at	c
your	c
musical	c
show	c
which	i
happened	c
to	c
be	c
inaccurate	i
at	i
the	i
leaflet	i
given	i
.	c

Notwithstanding	c
the	c
fact	c
that	c
I	c
could	c
have	c
expected	c
a	c
discount	c
for	i
my	c
ticket	c
,	c
it	c
occuried	i
to	c
be	c
impossible	c
to	c
have	i
one	c
.	c

Although	c
your	c
leaflet	c
suggested	c
that	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
would	c
be	c
open	c
it	i
was	c
not	c
the	c
case	c
because	c
of	c
a	c
lack	c
of	c
available	c
staff	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

Gens	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

From	c
this	c
moment	c
,	c
I	c
knew	c
without	c
the	c
shadow	c
of	c
a	c
doubt	c
that	c
my	c
mother	c
would	c
know	c
it	i
sooner	c
or	c
later	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
only	c
a	c
question	c
of	c
hours	c
before	c
my	c
life	c
would	c
collapse	c
.	c

My	c
fear	c
turned	c
out	c
to	c
be	c
right	i

I	c
read	c
the	c
hurt	c
in	c
her	c
eyes	c

I	c
write	c
to	c
you	c
because	c
last	c
night	c
,	c
(	c
Saturday	c
10	c
)	c
,	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
that	c
you	c
are	c
presenting	c
at	c
the	c
Circle	c
theatre	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
a	c
great	c
fan	c
of	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
went	c
to	c
see	c
him	c
in	c
his	c
new	c
show	c
,	c
but	c
,	c
to	c
my	c
surprise	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
him	c
who	c
played	c
that	c
night	c
but	c
another	c
horrible	i
young	c
actor	c
.	c

After	c
the	c
play	c
,	c
we	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
's	c
restaurant	c
and	c
we	c
found	c
out	c
that	c
it	c
was	i
closed	c
since	c
1999's	i
spring	i
!	c

How	c
can	c
you	c
ask	c
the	i
people	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
a	c
closed	c
restaurant	c
?	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

Although	c
he	c
had	c
promised	c
Lise	c
that	c
he	c
would	c
n't	c
say	c
a	c
word	c
,	c
when	c
he	c
reached	c
the	c
school	c
he	c
told	c
the	c
secret	c
to	c
Ann	c
.	c

Of	c
course	c
,	c
Ann	c
promised	c
not	c
to	c
tell	c
anyone	c
,	c
but	c
by	c
the	i
lunch-break	i
all	c
the	c
school	c
knew	c
that	c
Lise	c
had	c
stolen	c
the	c
literature	c
exams	c
.	c

Very	c
soon	c
,	c
Lise	c
understood	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
useless	c
to	c
continue	c
pretending	c
that	c
she	c
knew	c
nothing	c
about	c
it	c
,	c
and	c
decided	c
to	c
make	c
a	c
deal	c
with	c
her	c
class	c
mates	c
.	c

She	c
would	c
give	c
them	c
the	c
exam	c
's	c
questions	c
and	c
they	c
would	c
make	i
all	c
her	c
homeworks	i
during	i
3	c
weeks	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
the	c
perfect	c
plan	c
does	c
n't	c
exist	c
,	c
and	c
a	c
teacher	c
heard	c
two	c
students	c
talking	c
in	c
the	c
bathroom	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
the	c
teachers	c
asked	c
Lise	c
and	c
her	c
friends	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
this	c
letter	c
to	c
congratulate	c
you	c
for	i
the	c
excellent	c
international	c
arts	c
festival	c
we	c
could	i
enjoy	i
last	c
November	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
a	c
few	c
things	c
that	c
I	c
personally	c
think	c
can	i
be	c
improved	c
in	c
the	i
following	i
editions	i
.	c

Artists	c
from	c
different	c
cultures	c
may	i
make	c
the	c
festival	c
even	c
more	c
interesting	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
in	c
my	c
opinion	c
two	c
days	c
is	c
a	c
short	c
time	c
for	c
this	c
kind	c
of	c
event	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
strongly	c
encourage	c
you	c
to	c
organise	c
a	c
full	c
week	i
festival	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
the	c
prize	i
was	c
reasonably	i
and	c
it	c
was	c
helpful	c
to	c
have	c
one	c
ticket	c
for	c
all	c
the	c
weekend	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

Once	c
upon	c
a	c
time	c
,	c
in	c
a	c
small	c
Catalan	c
village	c
,	c
there	c
was	c
a	c
little	c
boy	c
who	c
loved	c
cheating	i
and	c
making	c
jokes	c
.	c

One	c
day	c
,	c
he	c
became	c
ill	c
and	c
was	c
worried	c
about	c
the	c
animals	c
.	c

the	i
next	c
day	c
he	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
mountain	c
with	c
the	c
animals	c
.	c

"	c
Let	c
's	c
have	c
a	c
bit	c
of	c
fun	c
"	c
,	c
he	c
thought	c
.	c

And	c
then	c
he	c
started	c
shouting	c
:	c
"	c
the	i
fox	c
!	c

Help	c
me	c
!	c
the	i
fox	c
!	c
"	c

Some	c
people	c
went	i
to	c
help	c
him	c
,	c
and	c
then	c
realised	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
true	c
.	c

They	c
were	c
angry	c
.	c

He	c
did	c
it	c
more	i
times	c
,	c
and	c
at	i
last	i
nobody	c
cared	i
of	c
the	c
shoutings	i
.	c

One	c
day	c
,	c
the	c
fox	c
attacked	c
his	c
animals	c
and	c
he	c
shouted	c
as	c
much	c
as	c
he	c
could	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
the	c
whole	c
festival	c
was	c
a	c
greatful	i
success	c
and	c
I	c
also	c
think	c
you	c
chose	c
an	c
appropriate	c
title	c
for	c
the	c
leaflet	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
some	c
points	c
which	c
can	c
be	c
improved	c
for	c
the	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

This	i
kind	i
of	i
problem	i
you	i
could	i
avoid	i
when	i
you	c
look	c
for	c
big	c
halls	c
at	c
the	c
begining	i
.	c

Another	c
point	c
where	c
you	c
could	c
improve	c
is	c
when	i
you	c
show	c
more	c
plays	c
and	c
films	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

Nearly	c
at	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
this	c
letter	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
the	c
idea	c
with	i
the	c
weekend	c
ticket	c
was	c
really	c
good	c
because	c
it	c
gave	c
to	i
the	c
people	c
the	c
opportunity	c
to	c
attemp	i
a	i
whole	c
weekend	c
for	c
a	c
cheap	c
price	c
.	c

To	c
finish	c
this	c
letter	c
with	i
I	i
would	c
like	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
a	c
good	c
idea	c
for	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
nice	c
if	c
you	c
create	i
an	c
exhibition	c
place	i
where	c
the	c
guests	c
can	c
try	c
to	c
play	c
different	c
instruments	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

How	c
can	c
you	c
earn	c
money	c
in	c
your	c
spare	c
time	c
?	c

I	c
think	c
everybody	c
will	c
ask	c
himself	c
this	c
question	c
one	c
day	c
or	c
has	c
already	c
asked	c
it	c
.	c

A	c
traditional	c
way	c
to	c
earn	c
money	c
,	c
in	c
the	i
spare	c
time	c
,	c
is	c
to	c
bring	i
newspapers	c
or	c
magazines	c
to	c
the	c
families	c
in	c
your	c
town	c
or	c
village	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs/Ms	c
Ryan	c
,	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
there	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
the	c
only	c
month	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
free	c
in	i
my	c
job	c
.	c

It	c
will	c
be	c
impossible	c
another	i
choise	i
,	c
but	c
if	c
you	c
have	c
any	c
problem	c
you	c
will	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
advise	c
me	c
,	c
although	c
I	c
prefer	c
to	c
go	c
there	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
I	c
think	c
is	i
the	c
best	c
month	c
to	c
travel	c
,	i
the	c
weather	c
is	c
nicer	c
and	c
warmer	c
than	c
in	c
other	c
seasons	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
my	c
choise	i
is	c
the	c
accommodation	c
in	c
tents	c
,	i
I	c
think	c
it	c
could	c
be	c
more	c
interesting	c
,	i
I	c
could	c
enjoy	c
my	c
time	c
with	c
other	c
people	c
playing	c
,	c
eating	c
and	c
talking	c
outside	c
,	i
in	i
my	c
opinion	c
if	c
I	c
choose	c
the	c
log	i
cabins	i
it	c
will	c
be	c
like	c

About	c
the	c
two	c
activities	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
select	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
the	c
best	c
one	i
are	c
swimming	c
and	c
painting	c
.	c

A	i
thing	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
ask	i
is	c
if	c
I	c
need	c
special	c
clothes	c
,	i
I	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
camp	c
I	c
am	c
going	c
.	i

It	c
should	c
be	c
a	c
dry	c
place	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
but	i
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
make	c
sure	c
my	i
guess	i
,	i
as	i
well	i
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
will	c
need	c
,	c
because	c
it	i
is	i
also	i
all	i
paid	i
I	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
if	c
there	c
will	c
be	c
some	i
gift	c
shops	c

Patricia	c
Reyes	c

The	c
most	c
popular	c
"	c
sport	c
"	c
that	c
all	i
the	i
people	i
do	i
it	i
's	i
obiously	i
shopping	c
.	c

But	c
the	c
question	c
is	c
:	c
Is	c
shopping	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
?	c

The	c
mother	c
was	c
shock	i
,	i
she	i
did	c
n't	c
know	c
how	c
to	c
look	c
for	c
her	c
because	c
all	c
the	c
shops	c
and	c
streets	c
were	c
full	c
of	c
people	c
going	c
out	i
and	i
in	i
the	i
places	i
,	i
it	i
was	c
nightmare	i
but	c
fortunaly	i
the	c
police	c
found	c
her	c
.	c

Where	c
we	i
are	i
going	c
!	c
!	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
the	i
thing	c
that	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
do	c
in	c
my	c
free	c
time	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
it	c
's	c
too	c
stressful	c
,	c
too	i
many	c
people	c
in	c
the	c
shops	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
prefer	c
spend	i
my	c
free	c
time	c
go	i
swimming	c
or	c
painting	c
and	c
I	c
go	c
shopping	c
in	i
the	c
days	c
that	i
usually	c
there	c
are	c
not	c
too	c
many	c
people	c
.	c

I'am	i
really	c
surprising	i
and	c
happy	c
about	c
it	c
.	c

For	i
accommodations	i
at	c
this	c
camp	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
being	i
in	c
a	c
tent	c
to	c
being	i
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
more	c
amusing	i
and	c
friendly	i
.	c

It	c
will	c
allow	c
me	c
to	c
make	c
friends	c
more	c
quickly	c
.	c

The	c
first	c
one	c
is	i
a	i
needless	i
for	i
me	i
.	c

The	i
last	i
summer	c
I	c
won	c
a	c
prize	c
in	c
competition	i
of	i
swimming	i
.	c

I	c
like	c
go	i
in	i
nature	i
and	c
make	i
photography	i
.	c

I	c
started	c
it	i
two	c
months	c
ago	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
any	c
material	i
.	c

Could	c
you	c
tell	c
me	c
if	c
you	c
would	i
lend	c
me	c
some	c
material	i
for	i
photography	i
?	c

What	c
sort	c
of	c
clothes	c
will	c
I	c
need	c
for	c
these	c
two	c
weeks	c
?	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

Henri	c
Devereux	c

I	c
told	c
you	c
that	c
I	c
have	i
helped	i
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
last	c
month	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
starting	c
to	c
sell	c
the	c
tickets	c
when	c
a	i
person	i
who	i
organised	i
told	c
me	c
to	c
go	c
into	c
the	c
lodge	i
.	c

Are	i
you	i
thinking	i
?	c

I	c
was	c
so	c
exciting	i
!	c

Finally	i
these	i
people	c
are	c
like	c
us	c
,	c
they	c
have	i
just	i
a	c
special	c
job	c
with	c
special	i
times	i
.	c

They	c
will	c
organise	c
a	i
same	c
concert	i
pop	i
but	c
with	c
an	i
other	i
singer	c
.	c

Henri	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
in	i
the	c
describing	i
of	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
the	c
starring	i
sould	i
be	i
Mr.	c
DANNY	c
BROOK	c
,	c
and	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
.	c

But	c
,	c
the	c
principal	c
reason	c
of	i
this	c
letter	c
is	c
to	c
ask	c
for	c
some	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
could	i
be	c
the	i
best	c
for	c
everyone	c
,	c
and	c
I	i
'll	i
like	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
an	i
advice	c
,	i
if	c
somebody	c
pay	i
you	c
for	c
a	c
ticket	c
,	c
try	c
to	c
give	c
the	c
best	c
you	c
can	c
.	c

Hope	i
hearing	i
from	c
you	c
.	c

He	c
worked	c
day	c
and	c
night	c
.	c

Every	c
day	c
after	c
having	c
dinner	c
Pat	c
,	c
his	c
best	c
friend	c
,	c
and	c
my	c
grandpa	c
met	c
to	c
talk	c
about	c
their	c
problems	c
,	c
but	c
my	c
Grandpa	c
never	c
told	c
Pat	c
about	c
his	c
new	c
project	c
.	c

The	c
only	c
thing	c
Pat	c
should	i
do	i
,	i
was	c
to	c
choose	c
a	c
date	c
,	c
the	i
one	c
he	c
likes	i
and	i
to	c
press	c
the	c
starter	c
botton	i
,	c
and	c
you	c
know	c
,	i
what	c
,	i
he	i
did	c
it	c
!	c

That	c
's	c
why	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

THE	c
END	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
happy	c
to	c
here	i
from	c
you	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
-	c
twe	i
weeks	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
in	c
the	c
U.S.A.	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
writing	c
for	i
my	i
information	i
to	i
tell	i
you	i
.	c

to	i
do	i
.	i

And	c
I	c
choose	c
phtograghy	i
and	c
tennis	c
from	c
the	c
activities	c
list	c
.	c

How	c
much	c
money	c
should	c
I	c
take	c
and	c
should	c
I	c
take	c
only	c
casual	c
clothes	c
and	c
trainers	c
?	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

The	c
other	c
day	c
,	c
I	c
worked	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
to	c
help	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
really	c
interesting	i
than	c
I	c
expected	c
.	c

My	c
job	c
at	i
behind	c
the	c
stage	c
was	c
helping	c
make-up	i
,	c
hare	i
and	c
clothes	c
staylist	i
.	c

It	c
was	c
different	c
from	c
I	i
did	c
at	i
college	c
.	c

There	c
was	c
no	c
time	c
to	c
rest	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
met	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
famous	c
singer	i
and	c
spoke	c
to	c
them	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
do	c
n't	c
go	c
to	c
a	c
concert	c
!	c

Anyway	c
,	c
shall	c
we	c
meet	c
sometime	c
?	c

I	c
can	c
enjoy	c
this	c
gifted	i
prize	c
only	c
after	c
7th	i
of	c
july	i
,	c
because	c
before	c
this	c

I	c
will	c
be	c
in	c

doing	c
a	i

course	c

about	c
wich	i

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
this	c
letter	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
show	c
which	c
I	c
saw	c
in	i
your	c
theatre	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
expected	c
that	c
I	c
could	i
have	c
spend	i
a	c
wonderful	c
night	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
been	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
seeing	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
.	c

Can	c
you	c
imagine	c
how	c
disappointed	c
I	c
was	c
when	c
I	c
saw	c
the	i
different	c
actors	c
on	c
the	c
stage	c
?	c

According	c
to	c
the	c
advertisement	c
the	c
show	c
is	i
to	c
start	c
at	c
19:30	c
.	c

However	c
it	i
did	i
at	c
20:15	c
.	c

You	c
mention	c
about	i
discounts	c
,	c
too	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

Modern	c
technology	c
has	c
really	c
changed	c
our	c
daily	c
life	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
we	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
to	c
wash	c
our	c
face	c
with	c
cold	c
water	c
even	c
if	c
it	c
is	c
freezing	i
morning	c
.	c

And	c
we	c
can	c
speak	c
to	c
anyone	c
at	c
anytime	c
on	c
a	c
phone	c
even	c
if	c
he	c
or	c
she	c
is	c
abroad	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
,	c
we	c
can	c
travel	c
to	i
anywhere	c
in	c
the	c
world	c
within	i
a	c
few	c
days	c
.	c

These	c
are	c
advantages	i
which	c
modern	c
technology	c
has	c
brought	c
to	i
us	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
must	c
accept	c
that	c
there	c
are	c
some	c
disadvantages	c
caused	i
by	i
the	i
technology	c
,	c
as	c
well	c
.	c

Air	c
pollution	c
by	i
cars	c
,	c
Soil	c
pollution	c
by	i
industrial	c
wastes	i
.	c

All	c
these	c
facts	c
mean	c
that	c
our	c
modern	c
life	c
gives	i
big	i
damage	c
to	c
the	c
earth	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
,	c

While	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
your	c
theatre	c
to	c
see	c
"	c
Over	c
The	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
very	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
fan	c
of	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
so	c
your	c
advert	c
attracted	c
me	c
but	c
when	c
I	c
went	c
there	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
was	c
in	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
instead	c
of	c
him	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
so	c
disappointed	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
your	c
timetable	c
was	c
wrong	c
.	c

Thirdly	c
,	c
I	c
saw	c
"	c
Discount	c
Available	c
"	c
on	c
your	c
advert	c
but	c
your	c
staffs	i
said	c
it	c
was	c
just	c
for	c
Mondays	c
.	c

Your	c
advert	c
made	c
me	c
misunderstood	i
.	c

Your	c
advert	c
promised	c
me	c
"	i
Perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
"	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
terrible	i
evening	c
to	i
me	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
want	c
you	c
to	c
give	c
me	c
a	c
refund	c
.	c

Looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c

When	c
I	c
bought	c
my	c
computer	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
n't	c
interested	c
in	c
it	c
but	c
when	c
I	c
started	c
studying	c
about	i
internet	i
and	c
playing	c
games	c
,	c
I	c
found	c
it	c
interesting	c
.	c

I	c
usually	c
spend	c
my	c
time	c
on	c
playing	c
computer	c
about	i
three	c
hours	c
a	c
day	c
.	c

After	c
that	c
,	c
I	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
sofa	c
for	i
watch	i
TV	c
.	c

Although	c
there	c
are	c
n't	c
programmes	c
which	c
are	c
interesting	c
,	c
I	c
just	c
watch	c
TV	c
,	c
so	c
my	c
mother	c
calls	c
me	c
"	c
Couch	c
Potato	c
"	c
.	c

As	c
a	c
result	c
,	c
my	c
health	c
is	c
getting	c
worse	c
.	c

I	c
know	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
excercise	c
but	c
it	c
is	c
difficult	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
start	c
.	c

Modern	c
technology	c
has	c
changed	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
from	c
physical	c
activity	c
to	c
mental	c
activity	c

was	c
one	c
of	c
the	c

,	i
thing	i
that	i

that	i
I	c

book	c
is	c
very	c
easy	c
to	c
read	c
,	c
but	c
if	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
time	c
I	c
recomended	i
to	i
listen	i
the	i
program	i
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
listen	c
to	c
it	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
thing	i
that	c
if	c
you	c
want	c
to	c
become	c
a	i
M.P.	c
,	c
it	c
will	c
teach	c
you	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
thing	i

and	c
you	c
would	i
learn	c
more	c
about	c
England	i

I	c
am	c
writing	c
this	c
letter	c
to	c
let	c
you	c
know	c
my	c
decision	c
about	i
your	i
letter	c
,	c
which	c
I	c
have	c
received	c
recently	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
rather	i
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
the	i
tent	c
than	c
to	i
stay	i
in	c
the	c
log	c
cabin	c
because	c
the	i
tent	c
is	c
more	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

I	c
might	c
say	c
that	c
I	c
am	c
really	c
good	c
at	c
swimming	c
and	c
sailling	i
because	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
joining	i
these	c
kinds	c
of	c
activities	c
for	c
five	c
year	i
and	c
I	c
had	i
really	i
good	c
training	c
about	i
sea-sports	i
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
about	c
what	i
exciting	c
experience	c
I	c
had	c
last	c
month	c
during	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
.	c

The	c
concert	c
tickets	c
were	c
very	c
expensive	c
and	c
I	c
'd	c
seen	c
an	c
adversitement	i
on	c
the	i
tv.	i
It	c
said	c
,	c
"	c
be	i
a	c
valunteer	i
for	i
our	c
concert	c
and	c
get	c
a	c
free	c
ticket	c
"	i
.	i

After	c
that	c
I	c
applied	c
and	c
they	c
accepted	c
my	c
application	c
.	c

You	c
should	c
have	c
seen	c
,	i
there	c
was	c
really	i
terrible	c
rush	c
before	c
concert	i
and	c
everybody	c
was	c
runing	i
around	c
to	i
do	i
something	c
.	c

I	c
helped	c
to	c
carry	c
huge	c
speakers	c
to	c
the	c
concert	c
venue	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Brown	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
in	c
connection	c
with	c
a	c
surprise	c
birthday	c
party	c
for	c
your	c
husband	c
,	c
Mr.	c
Brown	c
.	c

We	c
have	c
bought	c
some	c
snaks	i
to	c
eat	c
and	c
three	c
students	c
will	c
sing	c
for	c
him	c
,	c
also	i
.	c

Furthermore	i
,	c
we	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
what	c
present	c
buying	i
for	c
him	c
.	c

So	c
we	c
would	c
appreciate	c
if	i
you	c
help	i
us	c
with	c
this	c
matter	c
.	c

We	c
have	c
thought	c
to	i
buy	i
a	c
cd	i
or	c
a	c
book	c
.	c

What	c
do	c
you	c
believe	i
?	c

If	c
he	c
needs	c
something	c
else	c
,	c
we	c
are	c
happy	c
to	c
buy	c
this	c
.	c

The	c
only	c
appropriate	c
to	i
solve	c
people	c
's	c
problems	c
is	c
the	c
family	c
.	c

Teenagers	c
usually	c
think	c
about	c
a	c
matter	c
which	c
is	c
drugs	c
.	c

They	c
know	c
the	c
way	c
to	c
do	c
this	c
.	c

Apart	c
from	c
this	c
,	c
parents	c
could	c
be	c
very	c
helpful	c
to	c
their	c
children	c
with	i
difficulties	c
of	i
school	c
.	c

They	c
help	c
their	c
children	c
with	c
lessons	c
and	c
give	c
them	c
some	c
useful	c
advice	c
with	c
their	c
relationships	c
.	c

Because	c
sometimes	c
they	c
are	c
upset	c
when	c
they	c
lose	c
a	c
friend	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
friends	c
are	c
not	c
suitable	c
to	i
do	i
this	c
.	c

So	c
we	c
should	c
trust	c
only	c
our	c
family	c
when	c
we	c
need	c
help	c
or	c
solutions	c
of	i
our	c
problems	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
.	i

I	c
still	i
studing	i
at	c
the	c
moment	c
I	c
will	c
finish	c
at	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
June	c
so	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
leave	c
at	c
the	c
begining	i
of	c
July	c
.	c

You	c
are	c
asking	c
me	c
to	c
choose	c
just	c
2	c
activities	c
.	c

But	c
in	i
the	i
other	i
hand	i
,	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
done	i
surfing	c
,	i
I	c
am	c
a	c
completely	i
Beginer	i
but	c
I	c
am	c
dieing	i
to	c
do	c
it	c
.	c

If	c
there	c
is	c
,	c
please	c
let	c
me	c
know	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
we	c
should	c
have	c
a	c
protagonist	c
for	c
it	c
.	c

After	c
that	c
,	c
we	c
should	c
have	c
a	c
morning	c
view	i
of	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
most	i
busiest	i
London	c
tube	c
station	i
in	c
order	c
to	c
show	c
stressed	c
people	c
going	c
in	c
and	c
out	c
,	c
Including	i
our	c
protagonist	c
going	i
out	i
peacefully	c
with	c
a	c
couple	c
of	c
books	c
on	i
his	c
hand	c
-	c
then	c
the	c
school	c
's	c
door	c
,	c
and	c
him	c
going	c
in	c
.	c

After	c
all	i
this	c
introduction	c
,	c
will	i
be	c
the	i
time	c
to	c
show	c
some	c
of	c
the	c
acitivities	i
every	i
one	i
can	c
join	i
in	i
the	c
school	c
,	c
such	i
as	i
lesons	i
or	i
others	i
like	i
the	i
library	i
,	i
our	i
protagonist	i
having	i
a	i
cofe	i
with	i
some	i
coleagues	i
in	i
the	i
cofe	i
bar	i
,	i
the	i
reception	i
service.	i
.	c

Second	i
of	i
all	i
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
log	c
cabins	c
to	c
staying	c
in	c
tents	c
,	c
since	c
I	c
have	c
had	c
a	c
horrible	c
experience	c
being	c
attaked	i
by	c
a	c
herd	i
of	c
midges	c
,	c
when	c
I	c
camped	c
out	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
willingly	i
like	c
to	c
choose	c
swimming	c
and	c
painting	c
.	c

I	c
used	c
to	c
belong	c
to	c
a	c
swimming	c
club	c
and	c
practise	c
swimming	c
a	c
couple	c
of	c
times	c
a	c
week	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
painting	c
beautiful	c
landscapes	c
of	c
California	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
would	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
,	c

I	c
recently	c
had	c
a	c
week	c
's	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c

see	c
a	c
musical	c
show	i
'	i
Over	c
the	c

at	i

The	c
Circle	c

,	c
where	c
you	c
are	c
the	c
manager	c

The	c
second	c
point	c
,	c
the	c
principal	c
actor	c
was	c
changed	c
.	c

The	c
third	c
point	c
was	c
that	c
the	c
discounts	i
tickets	c
were	c
unavailable	c
and	c
finally	i
,	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
the	c
oven	c
was	c
broken	c
and	c
we	c
could	c
n't	c
enjoy	c
there	i
after	c
the	c

I	c
would	c
be	c
grateful	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
send	c
a	i
money	c
back	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
horrible	c
evening	c
for	c
my	c

and	c
it	c
was	c

a	c

the	c
enviroment	i
first	c

But	c
it	c
is	c
the	i
fact	c
.	c

We	c
will	c
feel	c
as	c
if	c
we	c
put	i
on	i
nothing	c

In	c
conclusion	c

clothes	i
after	i
100	i
years	i
will	c
not	c
as	i

as	c
they	c
are	c

.	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
,	c

Firstly	c
I	i
expected	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
but	c
I	c
felt	c
very	c
angry	c
when	c
I	c
saw	c
diffrent	i
actors	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
bored	c
because	c
I	c
did	c
not	c
have	c
anything	c
to	c
do	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
waiting	c
for	c
your	c
show	c
.	c

Additionally	c
I	c
felt	c
very	c
hungry	c
and	c
uncomfortable	c
because	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
and	c
you	c
did	c
not	c
give	c
us	c
any	c
reason	c
why	c
.	c

You	c
promised	c
us	c
a	c
big	c
show	c
and	c
perfect	i
evening	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
only	c
an	c
average	c
show	c
with	c
unknown	c
actors	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
you	i
are	c
not	c
very	c
respectful	i
and	c
responsible	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
you	c
give	i
me	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
foward	i
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

Only	c
Pat	c
knew	c
about	c
my	c
lover	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
happy	c
and	c
nervous	c
.	c

Everything	c
was	c
great	c
.	c

But	c
when	c
Pat	c
drank	c
some	c
beer	c
she	c
told	c
him	c
everything	c
about	c
me	c
.	c

Everybody	c
started	c
to	c
laught	i
at	c
me	c
.	c

'	c
She	c
was	c
my	c
best	c
friend	c
,	c
how	c
can	c
she	c
do	c
it	c
to	c
me	c
'	i
-	c
-	c
I	c
was	c
crying	c
.	c

This	c
alien	i
was	c
so	c
intelligent	c
and	c
funny	c
that	c
I	c
forgot	c
about	c
my	c
troubles	c
.	c

We	c
met	c
again	c
and	c
again	c
and	c
now	c
Jon	c
is	c
my	c
husband	c
.	c

Dear	c
sir	c
,	c

I	c
'm	c
sorry	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
,	i
that	c
I	c
'm	c
really	c
disappointed	c
of	i
your	c
advertisment	i
for	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
in	i
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
really	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
see	i
one	c
of	c
my	c
favourite	c
actors	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
in	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
but	c
you	c
had	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
,	c
what	i
disappointed	c
me	c
very	c
much	c
.	c

And	c
you	c
have	i
written	c
in	c
your	c
advert	c
,	i
that	c
there	c
would	c
be	c
discounts	c
available	c
,	c
what	i
was	i
n't	i
possible	i
this	i
evening	c
.	c

After	c
the	c
show	c
we	c
wanted	c
to	c
visit	c
the	c
restaurant	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
of	c
painting-works	i
inside	c
the	c
restaurant	c
.	c

Finally	c
we	c
had	i
no	i
perfect	i
evening	c
at	c
all	c
!	c

Brigitte	c
Beschle	c

Because	c
he	c
likes	c
to	c
tease	c
people	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
last	c
summer	c
,	c
we	c
were	c
on	c
a	c
short	c
trip	c
with	c
our	c
class	c
to	c
a	i
adventure-park	i
.	c

Until	c
we	c
came	c
to	c
a	c
big	c
cave	c
,	c
where	c
you	c
could	c
walk	c
through	c
.	c

I	c
walked	c
first	i
with	c
Pat	c
and	c
two	c
of	c
my	c
friends	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
so	c
worried	c
not	i
to	i
find	i

And	c
after	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
!	c

I	c
thought	c
that	c
Dany	c
Brook	c
who	i
is	c
my	c
favorite	i
actor	c
play	i
in	c
that	c
show	c
.	c

Please	c
,	c
if	c
you	c
would	c
be	c
so	c
kind	c
and	i
mind	i
correct	c
this	c
mistake	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
be	c
gratefull	i
if	c
you	c
could	c
correct	c
too	c
that	i
show	i
start	i
at	i
20.15	i
not	i
on	i
19.30	i
.	c

Other	i
thing	c
was	c
that	c
there	c
was	i
no	c
discounts	c
available	c
,	c
and	c
that	c
the	c
restaurant	c
which	i
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
visit	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
was	i
closed	c
because	c
of	c
the	i
main	i
cooker	i
sikness	i
.	c

That	c
evening	c
which	i
should	c
be	i
my	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
,	c
was	c
in	c
fact	c
very	c
tireing	i
and	c
boring	c
.	c

Apologise	i
me	i
for	i
disturb	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
for	i
answer	i
!	c

Best	c
regardes	i
!	c

It	c
started	c
a	c
week	c
before	c
that	c
day	c
.	c

Pat	c
arranged	c
great	i
DJ	c
and	c
drinks	c
.	c

My	c
friend	c
and	c
I	c
made	c
a	i
perfect	c
decoration	i
with	c
ballons	i
and	c
other	c
party	c
stuff	c
.	c

Everyone	c
told	c
us	c
it	c
was	c
breath	i
taking	i
.	c

Everyone	c
gathered	c
in	c
disco	i
at	c
21.00	c
.	c

We	c
were	c
only	c
waiting	c
for	c
Agatha	c
who	i
should	i
come	i
at	c
22	c
o'clock	c
with	c
her	c
boyfriend	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
so	c
exaiting	i
!	c
!	c
!	c

She	c
entered	c
the	c
room	c
,	c
and	c
everyone	c
shouted	c
HAPPY	c
BIRTHDAY	c
DEAR	c
!	c

Enyway	i
the	c
disco	c
was	c
great	c
,	c
music	i
also	i
.	c

Agatha	c
said	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
the	c
greatest	c
present	c
she	c
could	c
ever	c
get	i
!	c

As	c
far	c
as	c
activities	c
are	c
concerned	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
Basketball	i
and	i
Climbing	i
.	c

As	c
to	c
climbing	c
I	c
am	c
almost	i
inexperienced	c
but	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
improve	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
some	i
other	c
things	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
,	c
for	c
instance	c
,	c
whether	c
the	c
evenings	c
there	c
are	c
cold	c
or	c
hot	c

I	c
look	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
happy	c
to	c
receive	c
your	c
last	c
letter	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
n't	c
believe	c
in	i
it	c
!	c

As	c
you	c
know	c
He	i
's	i
my	c
favorite	i
singer	c
.	c

We	c
started	c
talking	c
about	c
music	c
and	c
I	c
asked	c
Him	i
many	c
things	c
about	c
His	i
texts	i
,	c
which	c
are	c
beautiful	c
but	c
sometimes	c
difficult	c
to	c
understand	c
.	c

Fabienne	c

It	c
'd	c
be	c
great	c
if	c
I	c
could	c
be	i
accommodated	i
in	c
tents	i
,	c
because	c
I	c
've	c
never	c
slept	c
in	c
tents	i
before	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
an	c
interesting	c
experience	c
.	c

Although	c
I	c
know	c
how	c
surfing	i
,	c
I	c
have	c
no	c
idea	c
about	c
sailing	c
,	i
I	c
just	i
only	c
read	c
about	c
it	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
interested	c
to	i
practice	i
.	c

I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
some	c
questions	c
:	c
Is	i
necessary	i
bring	i
money	i
to	c
the	c
Camp	c
?	c

And	c
about	c
clothes	c
?	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
.	c

A	c
programme	i
not	i
often	c
good	c
.	c

However	c
sometimes	c
it	c
is	c
n't	c
so	c
wonderful	c
as	c
it	c
seems	c
to	c
be	c
.	c

When	c
you	c
go	c
to	c
a	c
sale	i
shop	c
it	c
is	c
dificult	i
to	c
find	c
what	c
you	c
look	i
for	c
without	c
a	i
help	c
of	c
the	c
shop	c
assistant	c
.	c

The	c
problem	c
is	c
find	i
a	c
shop	c
assistant	c
who	c
hear	i
your	i
problems	c
and	c
can	c
help	c
you	c
.	c

So	c
you	c
had	i
lost	i
hours	c
to	i
buy	i
nothing	c
.	c

To	c
conclude	c
,	c
although	c
you	c
can	c
have	c
good	c
moments	i
while	c
shopping	c
all	c
of	c
us	c
know	c
that	c
it	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
,	c
is	i
n't	i
it	i
?	c

Dear	c
Ms.	c
Ryan	c
,	c

Even	c
if	c
I	c
worked	c
hard	c
on	c
it	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
surprised	c
of	i
winning	i
just	i
the	c
first	c
prize	c
.	c

As	c
far	c
as	c
I	c
am	c
concerned	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
an	i
accomodation	i
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
,	c
but	c
in	c
case	c
there	c
are	c
no	c
cabins	c
left	c
I	c
can	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
tend	i
as	c
well	c
.	c

However	c
I	i
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
if	c
by	c
any	c
chance	c
the	c
photograpy	i
activities	c
are	c
only	c
for	c
beginners	c
.	c

In	c
this	c
case	c
I	c
would	c
rather	c
do	c
some	c
climbing	c
,	c
which	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
done	c
before	c
.	c

In	c
general	c
,	c
shopping	c
is	c
considered	c
a	c
pleasant	c
activity	c
.	c

In	c
fact	c
,	c
the	c
shopping	c
you	c
do	c
for	c
the	i
daily	c
needs	c
is	c
seldom	c
enjouble	i
,	c
as	c
it	c
is	c
clearly	c
more	c
a	c
duty	c
than	c
a	c
pleasure	c
and	c
morover	i
you	c
are	c
often	c
faced	c
with	c
some	c
nasty	c
situations	c
.	c

God	c
bless	c
the	c
one	i
who	c
invented	c
the	c
Internet	c
!	c

Dear	c
Mr/Mrs	i
,	c

I	i
've	i
seen	i
your	c
festival	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
my	c
suggestions	c
to	i
it	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
you	c
must	c
invite	c
artists	c
and	c
stars	c
from	c
more	c
countries	c
around	c
the	c
world	c
,	c
because	c
there	c
are	i
people	c
only	c
from	c
six	c
countries	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
can	c
make	c
your	c
festival	c
more	c
popular	c
.	c

And	c
also	c
it	c
is	c
very	c
interesting	c
to	c
talk	c
with	c
writers	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
one	c
reasonably-priced	c
weekend	c
for	i
all	c
events	c
is	c
exellent	i
idea	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
n't	c
so	c
Expensive	i
as	c
buying	c
ticket	i
to	i
each	c
event	c
,	c
and	c
with	c
this	c
ticket	c
you	c
can	c
visit	c
everything	c
you	c
want	c
.	c

Dear	c
Tom	c
,	c

It	c
was	c
very	c
interesting	c
.	c

My	c
parents	c
are	c
very	c
kind	c
,	c
and	c
they	c
know	c
that	c
their	c
son	c
will	c
do	c
everything	c
right	c
.	c

And	c
the	c
main	c
reason	c
Why	i
our	c
family	c
is	c
so	c
friendly	c
,	i
it	i
's	i
because	c
we	c
have	c
n't	c
go	i
many	c
rules	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
everything	c
is	c
good	c
in	c
your	c
family	c
and	c
your	c
school	c
.	c

It	c
could	i
make	i
things	c
worse	c
that	c
the	i
visit	c
to	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
,	c
which	c
had	c
already	c
been	c
closed	c
because	c
of	c
lack	i
of	c
customers	c
,	c
was	c
canceled	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
be	c
grateful	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
give	c
the	i
money	c
back	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Five	c
years	c
ago	c
,	c
you	c
could	c
be	c
proud	c
of	c
your	c
486	c
computer	c
,	c
which	c
can	i
only	c
be	c
put	c
inside	c
a	c
museum	c
as	c
an	c
antique	c
now	c
.	c

Then	c
how	c
does	i
it	c
changed	c
our	c
daily	c
life	c
?	c

I	c
have	c
been	c
an	i
enthusiast	i
of	i
music	i
for	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
,	i
I	c
used	c
tape	i
player	c
and	c
I	c
felt	c
it	c
was	c
excellent	c
.	c

Especially	i
the	c
improvement	c
of	i
personal	c
computer	i
has	c
greatly	c
helped	c
the	c
spread	c
of	c
information	i
by	i
using	c
internet	i
,	c
you	c
can	c
book	i
newspaper	i
,	i
magazines	c
,	c
even	i
go	c
shopping	c
online	c
.	c

Helen	c
Ryan	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
and	c
your	c
organisation	c
for	c
giving	c
me	c
this	c
opportunity	c
.	c

I	c
've	c
just	c
received	c
your	c
letter	c
this	c
morning	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
happy	c
an	i
exciting	i
about	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
can	c
only	c
travel	c
during	c
July	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
many	i
A-levels	i
examinations	c
to	c
take	c
during	c
June	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
keen	c
on	c
basketball	c

I	c
am	c
a	i

of	c
school	i
's	c
basketball	c
team	c
and	c
we	c
have	c
won	c
many	i
competitions	c

Another	c
question	c
is	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
do	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
with	c
me	c
(	c
roughly	c
)	c
?	c

I	c
am	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

How	c
are	c
you	c
?	c

I	c
am	c
fine	c
.	c

Well	c
,	c
it	c
turned	c
out	c
really	c
well	c
and	c
everybody	c
had	c
a	c
great	c
time	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
last	c
month	c
that	c
I	c
was	c
selected	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
to	c
help	c
the	c
director	c
writing	i
a	c
script	c
of	i
the	c
concert	c
and	c
design	c
the	c
background	c
of	c
the	c
stage	c
.	c

On	c
Saturday	c
night	c
,	c
the	c
concert	c
began	c
.	c

Everything	c
went	c
really	c
well	c
,	i
the	i
music	c
was	c
great	c
and	c
the	c
fans	c
were	c
loving	c
it	c
.	c

When	c
they	i
've	i
finished	i
singing	c
the	c
last	c
song	c
I	c
was	c
surprice	i
when	c
they	c
called	c
me	c
up	c
on	c
the	c
stage	c
and	c
said	c
thank	c
you	c
to	c
me	c
in	c
front	c
of	c
hundreds	c
of	c
people	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
sure	c
that	c
I	c
'll	c
never	c
forget	c
that	c
moment	c
.	c

Love	c
,	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
according	i
to	i
your	c
letter	c
you	c
asked	c
me	c
my	c
prefered	i
travel	c
dates	c
.	c

If	c
it	c
is	c
possible	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
only	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
going	c
to	c
go	i
on	c
my	i
holiday	c
in	c
July	c
.	c

On	i
your	c
letter	c
,	c
you	i
are	i
going	i
to	i
provid	i
me	i
one	i
of	i
tents	i
and	i
log	i
cabins	i
with	i
accommodation	i
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
be	c
in	c
tents	c
because	c
I	c
can	i
find	c
it	i
being	c
in	c
tents	c
more	c
comfortable	c
than	c
being	c
in	c
log	c
cabins	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
happy	c
because	c
I	c
can	c
have	c
a	c
chance	c
to	c
do	c
activities	c
while	c
I	c
am	c
at	c
the	c
camp	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
not	c
goot	i
at	c
both	i
of	c
them	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
been	c
interested	c
in	c
them	c
so	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
turn	i
up	i
them	i
on	i
this	i
chance	i
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
something	c
about	c
travel	c
.	c

Could	c
you	c
let	c
me	c
know	c
whether	c
I	c
need	c
extra	c
money	c
or	c
what	c
sort	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
need	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
also	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
whether	c
someone	c
will	c
be	c
at	c
the	c
airport	c
for	c
me	c
because	c
this	c
will	c
be	c
the	i
first	c
time	c
in	c
the	c
U.S.A	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Dear	c
Kim	c

I	c
was	c
happy	c
to	c
get	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

On	i
your	c
letter	c
,	c
you	c
want	c
to	c
hear	c
about	c
my	c
experience	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
.	c

At	c
first	c
,	c
I	c
applyed	i
for	i
the	i
volenteer	i
at	c
the	c
pop	c
concert	c
and	c
then	c
I	c
got	c
a	i
responsibility	c
for	c
control	i
the	c
audience	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
I	c
always	c
spoke	c
loudly	c
and	c
run	i
fast	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
there	c
was	c
something	c
good	c
to	i
me	c
.	c

I	c
did	c
n't	c
need	c
to	c
pay	c
enterence	i
fee	c
because	c
I	c
was	c
working	c
there	c
.	c

I	c
'll	c
tell	c
you	c
more	c
experience	i
on	i
next	i
letter	c
.	c

Best	c
whishes	i

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
to	c
give	c
some	c
opinion	i
about	c
the	c
International	c
Arts	c
Festival	c
that	c
you	c
have	i
organized	i
last	c
November	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
believe	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
very	c
interesting	c
,	c
but	c
there	c
were	c
few	i
artists	c
than	c
I	c
have	i
expected	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
interesting	c
to	c
invite	c
young	c
compositors	i
to	c
hear	c
news	i
from	c
the	i
classical	c
music	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
receiving	c
your	c
reply	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
.	c

Dear	c
Magda	c
,	c

Well	c
,	c
I	c
hope	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
we	c
have	c
to	c
wear	i
in	c
appropriate	i
way	c
,	c

I	c
know	c

Dear	c
Miss	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
informing	c
me	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
start	c
my	c
journey	i
on	i
the	c
second	c
week	c
of	c
July	c
because	c
I	c
will	c
have	c
a	c
3	i
weeks	i
holiday	c
in	c
July	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
not	c
travel	c
in	c
June	c
and	c
May	c
because	c
I	c
will	c
have	c
my	c
standard	c
grade	c
exam	c
during	c
these	c
two	c
months	c
.	c

As	c
for	c
the	c
accommodation	c
I	i
would	c
like	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
because	c
I	c
hate	c
sleeping	c
in	c
the	i
tents	c
.	c

I	c
stayed	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
once	c
when	c
I	c
had	c
my	c
Duke	c
of	c
Edinburgh	c
walk	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
keen	c
on	c
singing	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
sevral	i
singing	c
competitions	c
at	c
school	c
.	c

I	c
enjoy	c
doing	c
it	c
very	c
much	c
.	c

I	c
note	c
that	c
all	c
accommodation	c
and	c
travel	c
costs	c
are	c
paid	c
for	i
,	c
but	c
does	c
it	c
include	c
my	c
expenses	c
in	c
California	c
?	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

We	c
were	c
sitting	c
at	c
the	c
back	c
of	c
the	c
concert	c
hall	c
and	c
chatting	c
with	c
each	c
other	c
.	c

I	c
found	c
that	c
they	c
were	c
all	c
Kelly	c
's	c
fans	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
a	i
tiring	c
work	c
because	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
run	c
from	c
place	c
to	c
place	c
for	i
hanging	i
the	c
decorations	c
.	c

After	c
I	c
had	c
finished	c
my	c
work	c
,	c
I	c
saw	c
Kelly	c
Chen	c
walking	c
into	c
the	c
concert	c
hall	c
.	c

She	c
smiled	c
at	c
me	c
and	c
said	c
thank	c
you	c
to	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
happy	c
at	c
that	c
time	c
and	c
I	c
thought	c
it	c
was	c
the	c
happiest	c
moment	c
that	c
I	c
ever	c
had	c
.	c

Could	c
you	c
tell	c
me	c
what	c
your	c
happiest	c
moment	c
is	c
?	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Ryan	c

Regarding	c
your	c
letter	c
dated	c
on	i
the	c
6th	c
of	c
June	c
I	c
'm	c
so	c
happy	c
to	c
receive	c
the	c
first	c
price	i
.	c

Thanks	c
very	c
much	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
to	c
California	c
.	c

The	c
reason	c
is	c
that	c
we	c
have	c
long	c
holidays	c
at	c
school	c
on	i
this	i
time	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
the	c
log	c
cabin	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
comfort	c
and	c
the	c
better	c
bed	c
.	c

Should	c
I	c
take	c
some	c
money	c
with	c
me	c
?	c

How	c
is	c
the	c
wheather	i
in	c
California	c
?	c

Yours	c
sincerelly	i
,	c

A.	c
Becker	c

Most	c
of	c
the	c
time	c
is	i
shopping	i
fun	c
and	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

Even	i
if	c
you	c
run	c
out	c
of	c
money	c
or	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
buy	c
a	c
particular	c
thing	c
which	c
is	c
difficult	c
to	c
find	c
.	c

Last	c
week	c
I	c
was	c
shopping	c
with	c
my	c
younger	c
brother	c
.	c

Awful	c
.	i

The	c
shops	c
have	c
bad	c
opening	c
times	c
.	c

My	c
conclusion	c
on	c
these	c
points	c
are	i
not	c
so	c
bad	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
,	c

At	i
first	i
,	c
all	c
the	c
students	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
thank	i
you	i
for	c
this	c
great	c
idea	c
of	c
a	c
trip	c
in	i
London	c
during	i
three	c
days	c
.	c

Otherwise	i
,	c
all	c
the	c
class	c
have	c
seen	c
an	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
"	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
"	c
,	c
and	c
we	c
are	c
all	c
interested	c
to	i
see	i
this	c
show	c
,	c
this	c
is	c
why	c
I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
.	c

In	c
fact	c
this	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
because	c
we	c
certainly	c
will	c
not	c
have	c
again	c
the	c
chance	c
to	c
take	c
part	c
in	c
a	c
live	c
show	c
,	c
like	c
this	c
one	c
.	c

This	c
is	c
the	c
arrangement	c
that	c
we	c
fouded	i
with	c
the	c
other	c
students	c
and	c
everyone	c
had	i
agree	i
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hear	i
news	i
from	c
you	c
.	c

Your	i
Faithfull	i
,	c

It	c
was	c
dangerous	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
knew	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
.	c

We	c
were	c
a	c
poor	c
family	c
,	c
living	i
in	i
one	i
room	i
for	i
five	i
persons	i
.	c

My	c
father	c
died	c
during	c
the	c
war	c
and	c
my	c
mother	c
stayed	c
alone	c
with	c
four	c
children	c
.	c

We	c
have	i
n't	i
enough	c
money	c
to	c
buy	c
food	c
,	i
new	i
clothes	c
and	c
the	c
worse	i
was	i
that	c
my	c
youngerst	i
brother	c
was	c
terribly	c
ill	c
,	c
and	c
without	c
money	c
we	c
could	c
n't	c
bring	i
him	c
up	i
to	c
a	c
doctor	c
.	c

During	i
weeks	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
prepared	c
my	c
programme	i
,	c
trying	c
not	c
to	c
forget	c
something	i
important	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
knew	c
that	c
the	c
day	c
after	c
would	c
be	c
the	c
good	i
one	c
.	c

I	c
get	i
up	i
very	c
early	c
.	c

I	c
took	c
it	c
,	c
the	i
most	i
of	i
possible	i
and	c
went	c
out	c
by	i
the	c
same	c
way	c
.	c

I	c
ran	c
to	c
my	c
house	c
and	c
went	c
back	c
in	i
my	c
bed	c
for	i
sleep	i
a	c
little	c
bit	c
.	c

When	c
all	c
the	c
family	c
get	i
up	i
,	c
I	c
told	c
us	i
the	c
true	i
and	c
all	i
promised	c
to	c
say	c
nothing	c
.	c

I	c
do	i
n't	i
expected	i
that	c
I	c
can	i
win	c
in	i
your	i
's	i
competition	c
.	c

I	c
like	i
to	c
travel	c
only	c

becouse	i
now	c
I	c
'm	c
studying	c
at	c
National	c

Defense	c
and	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
a	i
time	c
for	c
enything	i
else	c

When	c
I	c
will	i
arrive	i

You	c

that	c
I	c
will	c
have	c
the	c
chance	c
to	c
do	c
two	c
activities	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

I	c
had	c
dreamt	c
about	c
visiting	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
to	c
see	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
's	c
performance	c
for	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
all	c
my	c
expectations	c
failed	c
to	c
become	i
true	c
.	c

Although	c
you	c
mentioned	c
it	i
in	c
your	c
advertisement	c
.	c

And	c
,	c
finally	c
,	c
right	c
before	c
the	c
starting	i
they	c
announced	c
that	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
woud	i
not	c
be	c
in	c
the	c
show	c
that	c
evening	c
.	c

I	c
really	c
hope	c
it	c
will	c
not	c
take	c
you	c
long	c
to	c
settle	c
the	c
matter	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

Undoubtfully	i
,	c
modern	c
technology	c
changed	i
my	c
daily	c
life	c

Among	c
the	c
greatest	c
inventions	c
of	c
man	c
I	c
came	i
accross	i
dayly	i
are	c
telephone	i

computer	c
and	c

At	c
any	c
time	c
of	c
a	i

I	c
may	c
contact	c
any	c

at	i
any	c
part	c
of	c
the	c
world	c
over	c

But	c
it	i
is	c
not	c
the	c
end	c

And	c
I	c
'm	c
sure	c
all	c
those	c

was	c
not	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
.	c

The	c
show	c
should	c
have	c
started	c
t	i
19.30	c
.	c

We	c
were	c
planning	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
but	c
when	c
we	c
got	c
there	c
we	c
saw	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	i
of	i
the	i
cleaning	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
the	c
people	c
who	c
came	c
there	c
should	c
be	c
paid	i
back	i
.	c

Faithfully	i
,	c

People	c
used	c
to	c
wear	c
very	c
diffrent	i
things	c
from	c
the	c
clothes	c
we	c
wear	c
now	c
,	c
we	c
would	c
n't	c
even	c
say	c
that	c
they	c
are	c
'	c
clothes	c
'	c
.	c

People	c
try	c
to	c
look	c
nice	c
and	c
clean	c
by	c
wearing	c
good	c
clothes	c
.	c

The	c
things	c
we	c
wear	c
may	c
not	c
seem	c
as	i
if	i
'	c
clothes	c
'	c
to	c
the	c
ones	c
who	c
will	c
live	c
100	c
years	c
from	c
now	c
.	c

I	c
belive	i
they	c
will	c
wear	c
very	c
diffrent	i
things	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
ask	c
some	i
information	c
about	c
the	c
programme	c
which	c
our	c
class	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
join	c
.	c

your	i
sincerely	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
middle	c
age	i
,	c
Nobody	i
expected	c
to	c
have	c
a	i
electric	i
goods	c
which	c
have	i
been	i
helping	i
to	c
do	c
housework	c
.	c

By	c
contrast	c
,	c
In	i
the	c
future	c
,	c
I	c
guess	c
we	c
would	c
rather	c
go	c
back	c
to	c
the	c
acient	i
time	i
,	i
owing	i
to	i
have	i
natural	i
life	i
style	i
.	i

We	c
will	c
be	c
unwilling	c
to	c
give	c
a	i
housework	c
away	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

The	c
only	c
time	c
available	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
travel	c
is	c
July	c
,	i
any	i
time	i
during	c
the	c
month	c
suits	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
need	c
to	c
insist	c
in	i
it	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
not	c
able	c
to	c
take	c
holidays	c
during	c
the	c
rest	c
of	c
the	c
year	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
not	c
easy	c
to	c
chose	i
from	c
the	c
list	c
of	c
activities	c
,	i
all	i
of	c
them	c
look	c
interesting	c
.	c

Although	c
this	c
is	c
a	c
new	c
experience	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
climbing	c
and	c
Photographe	i
.	c

In	c
addition	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
appreciate	c
if	i
you	c
let	c
me	c
know	c
what	c
is	c
the	c
kind	c
of	c
clothing	c
required	c
for	c
the	c
Camp	c
;	c
if	i
I	c
need	c
some	c
money	c
there	c
and	c
for	c
what	c
;	c
and	c
finally	c
if	i
the	c
prize	c
is	c
just	c
for	c
me	c
or	c
if	c
I	c
can	c
go	c
with	c
somebody	c
else	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Finally	c
I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
let	c
you	c
know	c
about	c
the	c
most	c
exciting	c
experience	c
in	c
my	c
life	c
.	c

Can	c
you	c
believe	c
that	c
I	c
was	c
helping	c
in	i
the	c
last	c
Britney	c
Spears	i
's	i
Concert	c
?	c

During	c
the	c
day	c
I	c
helped	c
preparing	i
her	c
room	c
,	c
then	c
she	c
arrived	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
there	c
to	c
continue	c
helping	c
.	c

She	c
was	c
so	c
kind	c
with	i
all	c
of	c
us	c
,	i
of	i
course	i
I	c
asked	c
her	c
for	c
an	c
autograph	c
.	c

The	c
concert	c
was	c
a	c
big	c
success	c
,	c
lot	i
of	c
excitment	i
.	c

Each	c
time	c
,	i
when	i
she	c
comes	i
back	c
to	c
the	c
room	c
,	c
she	c
asked	c
for	c
something	c
to	c
drink	c
,	c
just	c
a	c
diet	c
coke	c
,	c
because	c
she	c
's	c
always	c
looking	c
after	c
her	c
weight	i
.	c

At	c
the	c
end	c
,	c
she	c
took	c
the	c
time	c
to	c
say	c
good	i
by	i
to	c
all	c
of	c
the	c
people	c
helping	c
her	c
.	c

But	c
now	c
,	c
tell	c
me	c
about	c
you	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Ryan	c
,	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
sleeping	i
in	c
a	c
tent	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
very	i
active	c
person	c
who	c
loves	c
the	c
outdoor	c
life	c
.	c

Thirdly	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
keen	c
on	c
sailing	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
lucky	c
enough	c
to	c
practice	i
this	c
sport	c
,	i
moreover	i
,	c
I	c
passed	i
my	c
licence	c
last	c
year	c
in	c
Port	c
Camargue	c
in	c
France	c
so	c
it	i
means	c
that	c
I	c
can	c
teach	c
this	c
sport	c
.	c

I	c
also	c
choose	c
the	i
Golf	i
I	i
have	c
never	c
played	i
this	c
sport	c
but	c
I	c
am	c
sure	c
I	c
will	c
enjoy	c
it	c
.	c

Would	c
you	c
be	c
kind	c
enough	c
to	c
tell	c
if	i
I	c
need	c
special	i
clothes	c
or	c
equipment	c
?	c

Furthermore	c
could	c
you	c
give	c
me	c
an	c
idea	c
about	c
the	c
pocket	c
money	c
I	c
need	c
?	c

Please	c
do	c
not	c
hesitate	c
to	c
contact	c
me	c
if	c
you	c
need	c
more	c
information	c
about	c
me	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Subject	c
:	c
short	c
video	c
about	c
daily	c
life	c
at	c
our	c
school	c
.	c

The	c
purpose	c
of	c
this	c
report	c
is	c
to	c
identify	c
which	c
lessons	c
or	c
other	c
activities	c
should	c
be	c
filmed	c
.	c

It	c
seems	c
to	c
me	c
that	c
it	c
will	i
be	c
a	c
nice	c
idea	c
to	c
show	c
our	c
library	c
because	c
according	i
to	c
the	c
librarians	c
,	c
the	c
library	c
has	c
a	c
welcoming	c
atmosphere	c
and	c
is	c
also	c
well-used	i
,	i
moreover	i
the	c
range	c
of	c
books	c
and	c
newspapers	c
is	c
very	c
large	i
and	c
useful	c
.	c

The	c
students	c
mentionned	i
that	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
very	c
interessting	i
to	c
show	c
the	c
English	c
course	i
because	c
some	c
foreign	c
students	c
will	c
probably	c
join	c
our	c
college	c
next	c
year	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
the	c
best	c
way	c
for	c
them	c
to	c
discover	i
our	i
English	c
course	c
.	c

Another	c
problem	c
is	c
,	i
I	c
realised	i
that	c
the	i
discounts	c
were	c
available	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
there	c
was	c
n't	c
any	c
discount	c
.	c

Additionally	c
,	c
the	c
advertisement	c
said	c
I	c
can	i
visit	c
the	c
threatre	i
restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
arrived	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

That	i
is	c
so	c
annoying	c
that	c
everything	c
had	i
been	i
changed	c
without	c
any	c
notice	c
.	c

I	c
expected	i
to	c
receive	c
the	i
money	c
back	c
within	c
these	i
two	c
days	c
.	c

Otherwise	c
I	c
would	i
like	i
to	c
take	c
the	i
other	i
action	c
.	c

Your	i
faithfully	c
,	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrects	i
.	c

I	c
told	c
Pat	c
everything	c
even	c
my	c
secrects	i
when	c
we	c
were	c
still	c
friendly	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
we	c
are	c
not	c
friends	c
anymore	c
because	c
of	c
a	c
secrect	i
in	i
the	i
past	i
.	c

I	c
told	c
Pat	c
that	c
my	c
father	c
and	c
mother	c
were	c
going	c
to	c
seperate	i
.	c

May	i
be	i
it	c
was	c
a	i
wrong	c
decision	c
to	c
tell	c
her	c
,	i
she	i
began	c
to	c
spread	i
that	c
secrect	i
to	i
everybody	c
including	i
the	c
teachers	c
.	c

They	c
tried	c
to	c
contact	c
with	i
my	c
parents	c
.	c

My	c
parents	c
were	c
very	c
angry	c
when	c
they	c
realised	c
what	c
happened	i
.	c

All	c
my	c
friends	c
were	c
trying	c
to	c
kept	i
a	i
distance	c
with	i
me	c
.	c

That	c
was	c
all	c
because	c
of	c
Pat	c
.	c

Mrs	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
have	c
just	c
received	c
your	c
letter	c
where	c
you	c
stated	c
that	c
I	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
of	i
the	c
competition	c
of	i
which	c
I	c
need	c
more	c
information	c
.	c

To	c
begin	c
with	c
,	c
in	c
your	c
letter	c
you	c
asked	c
me	c
when	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travell	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
do	c
tennis	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
used	c
to	c
play	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
at	c
school	c
and	i
swiming	i
because	c
I	c
like	c
water	c
sports	c
and	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
good	c
at	c
it	c
.	c

Could	c
you	c
also	c
let	c
me	c
know	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
and	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
would	c
have	c
to	c
take	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

In	i
that	i
occasion	i
I	c
had	c
n't	c
the	c
opportunity	c
for	i
giving	i
my	c
opinion	c
about	i
this	c
task	c
.	c

Now	c
,	c
my	c
English	c
teacher	c
has	c
asked	c
me	c
to	c
explane	i
all	i
what	c
I	c
think	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
nowdays	i
,	c
shopping	c
is	c
very	c
easy	c
and	c
in	i
the	i
same	i
time	i
very	c
hard	c
.	c

You	c
can	c
chose	i
the	c
price	c
more	i
suitable	i
for	c
you	c

My	i
mother	i

whereas	i
was	c
very	c
keen	c

Dear	c
Manager	c
,	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
when	i
I	c
paid	c
my	c
entrance	c
they	i
did	c
n't	c
acept	i
me	i
my	c
discount	c
ticket	c
,	c
they	c
said	i
me	c
that	c
the	c
ticket	c
was	c
false	i
,	c
then	c
I	c
enter	i
to	i
the	c
theatre	c
and	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
wait	c
45	c
min	i
,	i
the	i
show	c
was	c
suposed	i
to	c
start	c
at	c
19:30	c
and	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
,	c
"	c
this	c
is	i
a	c
lack	c
of	c
respect	c
"	c
.	c

When	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
the	c
starring	i
was	c
wrong	c
because	c
it	c
said	c
that	c
act	i
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
and	i
Danny	c
Brook	c
did'n	i
act	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
another	c
actor	c
that	c
nobody	c
knew	c
,	c
"	c
Really	c
this	c
is	c
very	c
disappointing	c
"	c
.	c

Sincerely	c
,	c

The	c
class	c
had	c
organized	c
a	c
secret	c
party	c
for	c
our	c
friend	c
,	i
Nick	c
that	i
was	c
leaving	c
the	c
school	c
on	i
2	c
more	c
weeks	c
.	c

All	i
started	c
when	c
Pat	c
,	c
the	i
best	i
friend	i
of	i
Nick	i
,	c
wanted	c
to	c
make	i
the	c
party	c
in	i
his	c
house	c
,	i
most	i
of	c
the	c
class	c
disagree	i
with	c
that	c
because	c
the	c
house	i
of	i
Pat	i
is	c
extremly	i
little	c
,	c
they	c
started	c
to	c
say	c
him	i
that	c
his	c
house	c
was	c
like	c
a	c
box	c
.	c

Pat	c
got	c
very	c
angree	i
and	c
sad	c
.	c

Pat	c
affected	i
with	i
this	c
situation	c
told	i
Nick	c
all	c
the	i
situation	c
and	c
the	c
secret	i
of	i
the	i
class	i
.	c

Although	c
the	c
weather	c
may	c
not	c
be	c
friendly	i
,	c
it	c
is	c
the	c
only	c
time	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
beauty	c
of	c
the	c
camp	c
.	c

I	c
'll	c
choose	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
tents	i
,	c
considering	c
that	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
feel	c
the	c
country	c
in	c
a	c
more	c
raw	c
way	c
.	c

And	c
being	c
a	c
photographer	c
during	c
my	c
spare	c
time	c
and	c
a	c
swimmer	c
since	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
child	c
,	c
these	c
will	c
be	c
the	c
activities	c
I	i
'll	i
like	c
to	c
do	c
while	c
at	c
the	c
camp	c
-	c
I	c
think	c
I	c
am	c
fairly	c
good	c
at	c
doing	c
both	c
things	c
!	c

I	c
would	c
also	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
some	c
more	c
details	c
about	c
what	c
sort	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
will	c
have	c
to	c
bring	c
with	c
me	c
and	c
about	c
the	c
amount	c
of	c
money	c
which	c
will	i
be	c
necessary	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
take	c

Shopping	c
can	c
be	c
painful	c

As	c
a	c
child	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
be	c
taken	c
to	c
the	c
mall	c
and	c
be	c
forced	c
to	c
go	c
through	c
all	c
the	c
shops	c
and	c
establishments	c
just	c
to	c
please	c
my	c
mother	c
,	c
whose	c
desire	c
to	c
buy	c
,	c
without	c
any	c
sort	c
of	c
control	c
,	c
all	c
kinds	c
of	c
clothes	c
and	c
gadgets	c
was	c
something	c
unbelievable	c
.	c

Certainly	c
,	c
buying	c
things	c
can	c
be	c
a	c
pleasant	c
activity	c
,	c
especially	c
if	c
you	c
are	c
acquiring	c
the	c
goods	c
for	c
yourself	c
.	c

Believe	c
me	c
,	c
shopping	c
can	c
also	c
be	c
painful	c
.	c

Amazingly	c
,	c
doctors	c
tell	c
people	c
to	c
look	c
after	c
their	c
bodies	c
during	c
Christmas	c
time	c
:	c
shopping	c
can	c
cause	c
you	c
a	c
large	c
variety	c
of	c
undesireble	i
pains	c
.	c

They	c
keep	c
claiming	c
that	c
there	i
's	i
no	i
such	i
thing	i
as	i
shopping	c

Dear	c
Mr	i
Jane	i
Clark	c
,	c

I	c
'm	c
24	c
and	c
I	c
'm	c
student	i
from	c
Poland	c
.	c

I	c
study	c
architecture	c
at	c
the	c
Polytechnics	i
in	c
Krakow	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
very	c
interested	c
in	c
art	c
,	c
specially	i
in	c
paintings	c
and	c
goings	i
to	c
galleries	c
.	c

I	c
recently	c
spent	c
two	c
days	c
at	c
this	c
festival	c
.	c

Most	c
of	c
the	c
events	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
were	c
good	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
feel	c
that	c
festival	i
could	c
be	c
even	c
better	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

Also	c
a	i
great	i
idea	i
was	i
,	i
that	i
it	i
was	i
one	c
reasonably-priced	c
weekend	c
ticket	c
for	c
all	c
events	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerly	i
,	c

Dear	c
Kathleen	c
,	c

You	c
wrote	c
that	c
in	c
your	c
class	c
,	c
you	c
've	c
been	c
talking	c
about	c
rules	c
,	c
both	c
at	c
home	c
and	c
at	c
school	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
know	c
I	i
'm	c
not	c
a	c
secondary	c
school	i
's	i
student	c
,	c
I	c
'm	c
now	c
a	c
student	c
of	c
architecture	c
in	c
Krakow	c
.	c

We	c
are	c
allowed	c
to	c
prepare	c
for	c
the	c
next	c
week	c
's	c
lessons	c
.	c

At	c
my	c
school	c
there	c
are	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
drawings	i
,	i
paintings	i
and	i
some	c
other	c
subjects	c
doing	i
by	c
hands	i
.	c

We	c
also	c
learn	c
how	c
to	c
design	c
the	i
interiors	c
and	c
buildings	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
very	c
interesting	c
.	c

We	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
tests	c
during	c
the	c
whole	c
student	c
year	c
,	c
only	c
at	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
the	c
class	c
.	c

There	c
are	c
also	c
some	c
exams	c
.	c

After	c
a	c
few	c
months	c
we	c
go	c
somewhere	c
with	c
all	c
class	i
,	c
for	c
example	c
next	i
to	i
the	i
lake	c
,	c
and	c
there	c
we	c
are	i
paintings	i
the	i
nature	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
troubbles	i
with	c
my	c
education	c
,	i
my	i
friends	c
and	c
teachers	c
are	c
nice	c
and	c
friendly	c
,	c
but	c
there	c
is	c
one	c
thing	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
change	c
in	c
my	c
school	c
.	c

I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
have	c
more	c
tests	c
during	c
the	c
whole	c
study	i
,	c
not	c
only	c
at	c
the	c
end	c
,	c
because	c
it	i
causes	i
that	i
I	i
'm	i
getting	i
very	c
lasy	i
.	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
received	i
a	i
new	i
letter	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

See	c
you	c
soon	c
,	c
your	c
best	c
friend	c

Finally	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
inform	c
you	c
that	c
I	c
had	i
never	c
spent	i
such	c
an	c
umpleasant	i
evening	c
in	c
my	c
whole	c
life	c
.	c

Therefore	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
be	c
very	c
grateful	c
if	c
you	c
-	c
the	c
manager	c
of	c
the	c
theatre	c
-	c
could	c
send	c
me	c
the	c
money	c
back	c
,	c
at	c
least	c
the	c
money	c
I	c
spent	c
on	c
the	c
ticket	c
.	c

Your	i
faithfully	c

Unfortunately	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

When	c
we	c
were	c
in	i
the	i
primary	c
school	c
,	c
my	c
teacher	c
wanted	c
to	c
surprise	c
Tom	c
(	c
a	c
school	c
mate	c
)	c
for	i
his	c
10th	c
birthday	c
by	c
preparing	i
a	c
fancy	c
dress	c
party	c
in	i
the	c
school	c
.	c

We	c
had	c
been	c
preparing	c
it	c
for	c
three	c
days	c
,	c
we	c
hired	c
fancy	c
dresses	i
,	c
had	c
a	c
cake	c
made	c
by	c
a	c
cook	c
and	c
decorated	c
the	c
gymnasium	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
me	c
who	c
had	c
to	c
tell	c
Pat	c
about	c
the	c
surprise	c
.	c

Later	c
,	c
I	c
realiced	i
it	c
was	c
the	c
worst	c
thing	c
it	i
could	c
happen	c
to	c
me	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
day	c
of	c
the	c
party	c
,	c
half	c
an	c
hour	c
before	c
it	c
started	c
,	c
Pat	c
came	c
across	c
with	c
a	c
gang	c
of	c
boys	c
from	c
another	c
course	i
.	c

Since	c
they	c
were	c
going	c
to	c
beat	c
him	c
,	i
he	c
desperately	c
told	c
them	c
everything	c
he	c
knew	c
about	c
the	c
party	c
.	c

Both	c
Pat	c
and	c
Tim	c
were	c
very	c
disappointed	c
that	c
day	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
writting	i
to	c
express	c
my	c
feeling	c
and	c
opinion	c
about	c
the	c
International	c
Arts	c
Festival	c
which	c
held	i
a	c
few	c
days	c
ago	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
great	i
to	c
hold	c
an	c
annual	c
international	c
arts	c
festival	c
in	c
the	i
place	c
.	c

There	c
were	c
so	c
many	c
exciting	c
things	c
I	c
saw	c
,	c
such	c
as	c
stars	c
and	c
artists	c
from	c
around	c
the	c
world	c
.	c

In	c
the	i
addition	c
when	i
you	c
organize	c
the	i
next	c
year	c
's	c
international	c
arts	c
festival	c
,	c
could	c
you	c
arrange	c
more	c
plays	c
and	c
films	c
.	i

Dear	c
Magda	c

This	c
remind	i
me	c
of	c
what	c
I	c
experienced	c
during	c
my	c
teeenage	i
.	i

In	c
my	c
country	c
the	c
children	c
go	c
to	c
the	i
secondary	c
school	c
when	c
they	c
are	c
at	i
the	c
first	c
year	c
of	c
teenage	i
.	c

In	i
a	c
result	c
of	c
these	i
the	i
teachers	c
make	c
very	c
strict	c
rules	c
at	c
school	c
,	c
such	c
as	c
students	c
are	c
n't	c
allowed	c
to	c
speak	c
each	i
other	c
in	c
the	i
class	c
.	c

They	c
cannot	c
oppose	i
to	i
the	c
teacher	c
,	c
girls	c
are	c
not	c
allowed	c
to	c
make	i
up	i
and	i
wear	c
any	c
accessories	i
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
not	c
just	c
what	c
happened	c
in	c
my	c
home	c
many	i
of	c
my	c
friend	i
had	c
the	c
same	c
experience	c
.	c

I	c
want	c
to	c
be	c
a	c
mother	c
of	i
them	c
and	c
a	c
friend	c
of	i
them	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
receiving	c
your	c
next	c
letter	c
soon	c
.	c

Best	c
wishes	c

The	c
other	c
reason	c
as	i
I	c
mention	i
earlier	c
is	c
because	i
of	i
a	c
request	c
off	i
all	i
the	i
class	c
.	c

We	c
've	c
seen	c
an	c
advertisement	c
in	c
the	c
newspapers	c
,	c
about	c
a	c
Fashion	c
exhibition	c
in	c
London	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
the	c
14	i
of	c
March	c
.	c

So	c
we	c
had	c
this	c
great	c
idea	c
if	i
it	c
is	c
possible	c
of	c
course	c
to	i
include	i
this	c
exhibition	c
in	c
our	c
programme	c
.	c

The	c
exhibition	c
is	c
caud	i
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
and	c
it	c
taking	i
place	c
at	c
the	c
Central	c
Exhibition	c
hall	c
,	c
in	c
London	c
From	i
10.00	c
till	c
19.00	c
.	c

We	c
believe	c
that	c
is	i
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
because	c
is	i
one	c
of	c
the	c
best	c
shows	c
of	c
the	c
year	c
,	i
also	i
a	i
majority	c
of	c
the	c
class	c
never	i
had	i
the	c
change	i
to	c
visit	c
a	c
show	c
as	i
this	c
and	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
and	c
best	c
part	c
is	c
that	c
the	i
admission	c
is	c
Free	c
for	c
Students	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
sure	c
that	c
the	c
people	c
that	c
had	i
decided	i
to	i
meet	i
this	i
word	i
they	i
did	c
not	c
realised	i
that	c
there	c
is	c
a	c
price	c
to	c
pay	c
.	c

I	c
believe	c
that	c
any	i
famous	c
people	c
such	i
as	c
politicians	c
and	c
film	c
stars	c
,	c
deserve	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
private	c
life	c
without	c
journalists	c
following	c
them	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
for	c
a	i
various	c
reasons	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
they	c
are	c
humans	c
like	c
everyone	c
else	c
,	c
so	c
yes	c
everyone	c
want	i
privacy	c
in	c
their	c
lifes	i
.	c

Of	c
course	c
on	i
you	c
are	c
on	i
the	c
public	c
eye	c
,	c
the	c
reasons	c
are	i
different	i
when	i
you	i
want	i
privacy	i
.	c

Becaue	i

I	c
have	i
spent	i
my	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
recently	c
and	c
it	i
is	c
like	c
a	c
tradition	c
,	c
we	c
went	c
to	c
a	c
musical	c
.	c

After	c
reading	c
your	c
programme	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
impressed	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
see	i
it	c
.	c

But	c
firstly	c
when	c
we	c
bought	c
our	c
tickets	c
,	c
we	c
did	c
n't	c
get	c
any	c
discount	c
,	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
pay	c
the	c
full	c
price	c
.	c

And	c
then	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
p.m.	c
,	c
although	c
it	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
start	c
at	c
19:30	c
p.m.	c
,	c
so	c
we	i
've	i
had	i
to	c
wait	c
quite	c
long	c
in	c
this	i
crowded	c
room	c
.	c

After	c
the	c
show	c
we	c
wanted	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
,	c
because	c
we	c
were	c
very	c
hungry	c
,	c
but	c
then	c
we	c
saw	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
,	c
because	c
of	c
staff	c
illness	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
to	c
give	c
us	c
our	c
money	c
back	c
,	c
because	c
it	c
has	i
been	i
a	c
very	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
for	c
us	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

Two	c
weeks	c
before	c
his	c
birthday	c
he	c
started	c
asking	c
us	c
what	c
we	c
were	c
gong	i
to	c
do	c
.	c

That	c
annoyed	c
us	c
so	c
much	c
,	i
that	c
we	c
started	c
making	c
something	c
up	c
.	c

We	c
told	c
Pat	c
we	c
could	c
n't	c
have	c
a	c
party	c
on	c
his	c
birthday	c
,	c
because	c
everyone	c
except	c
me	c
had	c
something	c
to	c
do	c
.	c

Of	c
course	c
,	c
that	c
was	c
n't	c
,	i
we	c
had	c
actually	c
organised	c
a	c
party	c
for	c
him	c
with	c
all	c
his	c
friends	c
since	i
a	c
long	c
time	c
go	i
,	c
but	c
he	c
was	c
n't	c
supposed	c
to	c
know	c
that	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
invited	c
him	c
to	c
opened	i
the	c
evening	c
with	c
me	c
.	c

But	c
half	c
an	c
hour	c
before	c
he	c
should	c
have	c
been	c
there	c
he	c
phoned	c
me	c
and	c
said	c
he	c
was	c
too	c
tired	c
to	c
come	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
n't	c
change	c
his	c
mind	c
although	c
I	i
've	i
tried	i
everything	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
end	c
I	c
just	c
told	c
him	c
the	c
truth	c
.	c

Dear	c
Ms	c
Ryan	c
Helen	c
,	c

thank	c
you	c
for	c
the	c
information	c
,	i
I	c
am	c
glad	c
I	c
've	c
won	c

prize	c
!	c

I	c
would	c
like	c

In	c
July	c
I	c
'll	c
be	c

As	c
for	c
accomodation	i
I	c
prefer	i
to	c
live	i
in	c
tents	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
'd	c
be	c
happy	c
to	c
do	c

two	c
reasons	c
.	c

First	c
I	c
am	c
good	c

at	c
both	c
of	c
them	c
.	c

Secondly	c
I	c
truly	c
love	c

singing	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
what	c
the	c
weather	c
is	c
like	c
in	c
California	c
in	c
July	c
to	c
be	i
aware	i
of	i
what	c
clothes	c
I	c
should	c
take	c
.	c

I	c

I	c
enjoy	c
shopping	c
like	c
any	c
woman	c

Or	c
I	c
would	c
rather	c
say	c
he	c
or	c
she	c
might	i
be	i
or	i
might	c
happen	c
to	c
be	c
such	c

But	c
sometimes	c
I	c
really	c
get	c
annoyed	c
at	c
his	c
or	c
her	c
,	c
persistent	c
in	c
nature	c
and	c
polite	c
in	c
structure	c

questions	c
or	c
suggestions	c

To	c
say	c
nothing	c
about	c
his	c

her	c

advice	c

Like	c
any	c
human	c
being	c
I	c
am	c
not	c
delighted	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c

I	c
've	c
just	c
received	c
your	c
letter	c
saying	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
2	i
weeks	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
in	c
the	c
USA	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
glad	c
to	c
hear	c
that	c
and	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
all	c
the	c
informations	i
you	c
need	c
to	c
know	c
from	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
would	i
be	c
able	c
to	c
travel	c
only	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
my	c
summer	c
holiday	c
and	c
I	c
assumed	c
that	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
long	i
enough	c
time	c
to	c
fit	c
the	c
trip	c
in	c
.	c

Also	c
we	c
are	c
going	c
to	i
a	c
ferry	i
trip	i
with	c
my	c
relatives	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
appologize	i
about	c
that	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
choose	c
these	c
2	c
activities	c
,	c
they	c
are	c
Tennis	c
and	c
Climbing	c
.	c

As	c
I	c
say	i
before	c
that	i
I	c
have	c
to	c
attend	i
tennis	i
competition	c
so	i
I	c
think	c
I	c
am	c
quite	c
good	c
at	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
in	c
the	c
tennis	c
county	c
player	i
I	i
was	c
12	c
.	c

I	c
attended	i
15	c
competitions	c
already	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
lost	c
5	c
games	c
and	c
won	c
10	c
games	c
.	c

My	c
dad	c
influences	i
me	c
to	c
play	c
tennis	c
and	c
enjoy	i
it	c
.	c

For	i
climbing	c
,	c
I	c
started	c
to	c
be	c
interested	c
in	c
it	c
since	i
it	i
was	c
14	c
.	c

My	c
family	c
live	c
near	c
the	c
sea	c
so	c
we	c
have	i
got	i
quite	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
chance	i
to	c
go	c
climbing	c
.	c

My	c
sister	c
loves	c
nature	c
and	c
climbing	c
so	c
she	c
is	c
the	c
one	c
who	c
influences	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
a	c
few	c
questions	c
.	c

How	c
hot	c
is	c
it	c
in	c
California	c
in	c
July	c
?	c
so	i
I	c
know	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
need	c
.	c

What	c
kind	c
of	c
food	c
do	c
we	c
eat	c
?	c

This	c
is	c
because	c
I	c
cannot	c
eat	c
Pork	c
.	c

If	c
there	i
is	c
any	i
unconvenience	i
,	c
please	c
feel	c
free	c
to	c
tell	c
me	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

How	c
are	c
you	c
?	c

Quess	i
what	c
I	c
've	c
done	c
!	c

That	c
's	c
why	c
I	c
have	i
no	c
time	c
and	c
wanted	c
you	c
to	c
be	c
there	c
with	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
will	c
tell	c
you	c
all	c
about	c
it	c
!	c

I	c
immediately	c
say	i
"	c
yes	c
"	c
and	c
also	i
my	c
friend	c
.	c

Do	c
you	c
know	c
that	c
this	c
concert	c
will	c
be	c
on	c
television	c
.	i

Their	c
jobs	i
are	i
preparing	i
concert	i
.	c

I	c
had	c
a	c
chance	c
to	c
talk	c
to	c
them	c
about	c
their	c
jobs	c
and	c
it	c
was	c
amuzing	i
!	c

I	c
have	c
learnt	c
lots	c
of	c
things	c
about	c
preparing	c
stage	i
,	c
light	i
,	c
sound	c
,	i
background	c
.	c

I	c
felt	c
like	c
I	i
'm	i
one	c
of	c
those	c
professional	i
too	c
because	c
they	c
always	c
called	c
me	c
and	c
my	c
friend	c
to	c
help	c
them	c
and	c
that	c
made	c
me	c
learn	c
lots	c
of	c
thing	i
from	c
doing	c
the	c
practical	c
work	c
.	c

Can	c
you	c
imagine	c
the	c
real	c
concert	c
,	c
and	c
how	c
high	c
the	c
lights	c
always	c
like	i
?	c

She	c
did	c
n't	c
seem	c
to	c
enjoyed	i
it	c
as	c
much	c
as	c
I	c
do	i
.	c

At	i
the	i
end	i
of	i
the	i
day	i
,	c
my	c
ambition	c
is	c
to	c
be	c
like	c
one	c
of	c
the	i
professionals	c
.	c

My	c
teacher	c
was	c
very	c
proud	c
of	c
me	c
because	c
after	c
the	c
concert	c
,	c
all	c
the	c
staff	c
were	c
saying	c
how	c
helpful	c
I	c
was	c
and	c
so	c
on	c
.	c

I	c
feel	c
like	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
work	c
harder	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
will	c
feel	c
like	c
me	c
one	c
day	c
.	c

I	c
will	c
write	c
to	c
you	c
again	c
soon	c
and	c
tell	c
you	c
how	c
I	c
getting	i
on	c
.	c

Lots	c
of	c
love	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
organising	c
a	c
nice	c
programme	c
for	c
us	c
.	c

Especially	i
,	c
going	c
to	c
the	c
Museum	c
and	c
the	c
Art	c
Gallery	c
would	i
be	c
a	c
great	c
oppotunity	i
for	c
all	c
of	c
us	c
,	c
as	c
they	c
are	c
world-famous	c
places	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
there	c
is	c
something	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
.	c

It	c
would	i
be	i
essential	c
because	c
many	c
people	c
in	c
the	c
class	c
are	c
thinking	c
of	c
studying	c
fashion	c
in	c
future	c
.	c

To	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
we	c
need	c
to	c
alter	c
the	c
programme	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
shortly	c
.	c

Story	c

It	c
was	c
dangerous	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
knew	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
.	c

First	c
,	c
I	c
climbed	c
the	c
tree	c
in	c
the	c
garden	c
.	c

I	c
managed	c
to	c
do	c
that	c
although	c
I	c
cut	c
my	c
knee	c
!	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
scary	c
,	c
but	c
thrilling	c
and	c
exciting	c
incident	c
!	c

16.12.00	c

I	c
enjoyed	c
the	c
festival	c
pretty	i
much	c
.	c

However	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
it	c
could	c
be	c
better	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
rearrange	c
little	i
details	c
.	c

This	i
also	i
would	i
take	i
more	i
attraction	i
to	i
the	i
festival	i
.	c

I	c
enjoyed	c
all	c
of	c
them	c
.	c

The	c
best	c
thing	c
about	c
the	c
festival	c
was	c
the	c
price	c
I	c
think	c
,	c
because	c
it	c
made	i
a	c
really	c
big	c
effect	c
on	c
the	c
attraction	i
,	c
that	i
of	c
course	c
made	c
the	c
festival	c
much	c
more	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

I	c
again	c
want	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
really	c
nice	c
to	c
be	c
at	c
the	c
festival	c
.	c

I	c
just	c
received	c
your	c
letter	c
and	c
decided	c
you	i
to	c
write	c
back	c
now	c
;	i
because	c
of	c
your	c
questions	c
which	c
were	c
about	c
the	i
rules	c
.	c

Actually	c
not	c
all	c
the	c
schools	c
in	c
Turkey	c
are	c
so	c
strict	c
but	c
unfortunatly	i
the	c
school	c
that	c
I	c
'm	c
going	c
is	i
like	c
a	c
military	c
camp	c
.	c

No	c
one	c
is	c
allowed	c
to	c
wear	c
anything	c
which	c
is	c
n't	c
written	c
in	c
the	c
school	c
rules	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
if	i
you	c
do	c
n't	c
come	c
to	c
school	c
10	i
days	c
in	c
a	c
year	c
we	i
fail	c
that	c
year	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
allowed	c
to	c
stay	c
up	c
late	c
,	c
I	c
'm	c
allowed	c
to	c
bring	c
my	c
friends	c
home	c
and	c
stuff	c
like	c
that	c
.	c

They	c
hate	c
it	c
when	c
I	c
listen	i
to	i
music	c
loudly	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
they	c
do	c
n't	c
like	c
the	c
music	c
I	c
listen	c
to	c
.	c

This	c
is	c
all	c
that	c
I	c
can	c
tell	c
you	c
about	c
my	c
school	c
and	c
family	c
.	c

Rules	c
are	c
every	i
where	i
and	c
you	c
ca	c
n't	c
change	c
them	c
.	c

Your	c
Best	i
Pen	i
friend	c

I	c
am	c
so	c
pleased	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
.	c

And	c
also	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
the	c
log	c
cabins	c
to	c
the	c
tents	c
otherwise	i
I	c
have	c
never	c
slept	c
in	c
the	i
sleepin	i
bag	c
before	c
.	c

Because	c
I	c
used	c
to	c
play	c
tennis	c
and	c
basketball	c
for	c
ages	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
could	c
you	c
give	c
me	c
your	c
suggestion	c
about	c
money	c
and	c
clothes	c
.	c

Could	c
you	c
please	c
send	c
me	c
more	c

about	c

Dear	c
Kim	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
kind	c
letter	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
glad	c
to	c
hearing	i
about	c

Kim	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
my	c
wonderful	c
experience	c
last	c
month	c
!	c

On	c
5th	c
of	c
May	c
which	i
was	c
national	i
holiday	c
in	c
Japan	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
part-time	c
work	i
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
in	c
the	c
Tokyo	c
Dome	c
.	c

The	c
concert	c
was	i
start	i
7.00	i
p.m.	c
At	c
that	c
time	c
I	c
was	c
in	i
the	c
second	c
floor	c
where	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
work	c
is	i
.	c

I	i
did	i
a	i
part	i
of	i
gard	i
job	i
.	i

I	c
stood	c
up	c
in	c
front	c
of	c
audiences	i
and	c
I	i
had	i
given	i
an	i
attention	i
to	i
them	i
.	c

All	c
of	c
her	c
funs	i
were	c
stooud	i
up	c
the	c
whole	c
concert	c
and	c
dancing	c
.	c

I	i
was	i
so	i
exciting	i
night	i
.	i

Some	c
of	c
funs	i
were	c
not	c
good	c
at	c
all	c
because	c
they	c
shouted	c
and	c
argued	c
,	c
but	c
most	c
of	c
people	i
were	c
very	c
good	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
enjoyed	c
so	i
much	i
with	i
my	i
wonderful	i
experience	i

I	c
am	c
very	c
glad	c
I	c
won	c
the	c
Competition	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
Camp	c
California	c
.	c

Log	i
cabines	i
will	i
be	c
ideal	i
accomodation	i
,	i
presumably	i
they	c
are	c
more	c
spacious	c
than	c
tent	i
and	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
easier	c
to	c
keep	c
tidy	c
.	c

And	c
I	c
'm	c
quite	c
good	c
at	c
.	i

Climbing	c
would	c
be	c
my	c
second	c
option	c
,	c
for	i
this	c
I	c
'm	c
afraid	c
I	c
would	c
need	c
some	c
instruction	c
for	i
I	c
've	c
only	c
done	c
it	c
a	c
few	c
times	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
do	i
people	c
ussually	i
take	c
and	c
how	c
many	i

Sincerely	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
:	c

Well	c
,	c
you	c
want	c
to	c
know	c
what	c
I	c
did	c
in	i
the	c
concert	c
?	c

It	c
was	c
in	c
fact	c
more	c
fun	c
than	c
the	c
concert	c
itself	c
;	c
believe	c
it	c
or	c
not	c
,	c
all	c
the	c
popstars	i
came	c
to	c
help	c
us	c
clean	c
up	c
and	c
we	c
all	c
had	c
a	c
food	c
fight	c
with	c
the	c
left-overs	i
!	c

If	c
you	c
ever	c
know	c
of	c
a	c
concert	c
that	c
needs	c
volunteers	c
tell	c
me	c
,	c
I	c
'm	c
in	c
!	c
!	c
!	c

Write	c
back	c
soon	c

I	c
was	c
disappointed	c
to	c
see	c
that	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
announced	c
on	c
your	c
advertisement	c
,	c
did	c
not	c
act	c
in	c
this	c
show	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
the	c
worst	c
was	c
to	c
come	c
as	c
it	c
was	c
impossible	c
to	c
eat	c
something	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

Indeed	c
,	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
the	c
chef	c
was	c
ill	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

Science	c
and	c
technology	c
have	c
played	c
an	c
important	c
role	c
for	c
the	c
last	c
twenty	c
years	c
and	c
the	c
development	c
of	c
the	i
modern	c
technology	c
has	c
especially	c
affected	c
our	c
lives	c
.	c

This	c
latter	i
is	c
a	c
new	c
media	i
which	c
has	c
changed	c
my	c
life	c
,	c
as	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
marvellous	c
tool	c
to	i
communicate	i
,	c
learn	i
or	c
have	i
fun	c
.	c

Another	c
important	c
change	c
related	c
to	c
the	i
modern	c
technology	c
are	c
the	i
credit	c
cards	c
.	c

Until	c
I	c
have	i
had	i
one	c
,	c
I	c
was	i
often	c
run	c
out	c
of	c
cash	c
and	c
had	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
bank	c
.	c

At	c
the	c
present	c
time	c
,	c
thanks	c
to	c
my	c
credit	c
card	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
really	c
buy	c
what	c
I	c
want	c
,	c
when	c
I	c
want	c
and	c
where	c
I	c
want	c
!	c

However	c
it	i
would	c
be	i
too	c
long	c
to	c
list	c
them	c
all	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
quite	c
sure	c
that	c
you	c
also	i
know	i
them	c
as	c
they	c
do	c
n't	c
change	c
only	c
my	c
life	c
,	c
but	c
everybody	c
's	c
daily	c
life	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
provide	c
you	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
rather	c
be	i

in	c
log	i

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
staying	c
in	c
log	c
cabins	c
is	c
funnier	i
and	c
much	c
cleaner	c
.	c

Sorry	c
for	c
not	c
writing	c
you	i
before	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
so	c
busy	c
,	c
because	c
last	c
weak	i
I	c
went	c
to	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
to	c
help	c
the	c
singers	c
.	c

Then	c
,	c
they	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
airport	c
,	c
and	c
my	c
dream	c
finished	c
.	c

What	c
I	c
really	c
liked	c
doing	c
was	c
to	i
helped	i
them	c
with	c
their	c
clothes	c
and	c
to	i
make-up	c
them	i
,	c
because	c
I	c
learnt	c
how	c
to	c
make-up	i
a	i
person	i
and	c
I	c
spend	i
a	c
few	c
minutes	c
with	c
the	c
most	c
popular	c
grup	i
of	i
the	c
world	c
.	c

Write	c
me	i
soon	c
.	c

Regarding	c
starting	c
time	c
and	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
,	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
musical	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
wait	c
about	c
45	c
minuits	i
because	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
.	c

Lastly	c
,	c
with	c
reference	c
to	c
ticket	c
prices	c
,	c
your	c
theatre	c
had	c
n't	c
any	c
discounts	c
even	c
for	c
children	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
to	c
buy	c
an	c
adult	c
ticket	c
for	c
my	c
child	c
and	c
spent	c
more	c
money	c
than	c
I	c
had	c
expected	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
not	c
perfect	i
evening	c
for	c
me	c
and	c
my	c
child	c
at	c
all	c
!	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
this	c
letter	c

concerning	c
the	c
information	c
you	c
have	c
asked	c
me	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
,	i
for	c
giving	c
me	c
the	c
chance	c
to	c
visit	c
Camp	c
California	c
.	c

To	c
be	c
honest	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
spend	c
some	i
days	c
with	c
my	c
family	c
,	c
before	c
I	c
go	c
to	c
California	c
.	c

The	c
best	c
season	c
for	c
holidays	c
.	c

About	i
the	c
accomodation	i
,	c
I	c
would	c
be	c
pleased	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
,	c
because	c
this	c
reminds	c
me	c
the	i
holidays	c
with	c
my	c
family	c
.	c

I	c
joined	c
my	c
choir	c
,	i
when	c
I	c
was	c
eight	c
years	c
old	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
sung	c
solo	c
in	c
two	c
concerts	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

I	c
thought	c
that	c
you	c
did	c
n't	c
like	c
pop	c
music	c
and	c
things	i
have	i
to	i
deal	i
with	i
that	i
.	c

Anyway	c
,	c
I	i
've	i
enjoyed	i
it	c
very	c
much	c
!	c

It	c
was	c
the	c
best	c
experience	c
I	c
've	c
ever	c
had	c
in	c
my	c
whole	c
life	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
trying	c
to	c
be	c
with	c
the	c
singers	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
fantastic	c
.	c

I	c
wanted	c
to	c
touch	c
them	c
,	c
as	c
the	c
only	c
way	c
to	c
convince	c
myself	c
that	c
I	c
was	c
with	c
them	c
.	c

I	c
did	c
n't	c
really	c
have	c
to	c
do	c
anything	c
special	c
.	c

That	c
's	c
the	c
advantage	c
of	c
being	c
a	c
volunteer	c
.	c

You	c
have	c
to	c
try	c
once	i
in	c
your	c
life	c
and	c
if	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
like	c
,	i
do	c
n't	c
do	c
it	c
again	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
is	i
the	c
best	c
period	i
to	c
take	c
a	c
break	c
from	c
my	c
work	c
.	c

For	i
the	c
accomodation	i
,	c
if	c
is	i
possible	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
camping	i
because	c
I	c
think	c
is	i
a	c
relaxing	c
place	c
where	i
to	c
stay	c
.	c

Also	c
is	i
possible	c
to	c
meet	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
people	c
,	c
and	c
chatting	i
during	c
the	c
night	c
,	c
might	i
around	c
the	c
fire	c
,	c
playing	c
a	c
clutone	i
and	c
singing	c
I	i
think	c
is	i
a	c
nice	c
way	c
to	c
have	c
fun	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
play	c
Tennis	i
,	i
and	c
swimming	i
.	c

I	c
choose	c
tennis	c
because	c
is	i
a	c
sport	c
that	c
you	c
can	c
play	c
with	c
others	i
people	c
,	c
also	c
because	c
I	c
like	c
the	i
competition	i
in	i
the	i
sport	i
.	c

The	c
other	c
sport	c
that	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
do	c
is	c
swimming	c
.	c

Swimming	c
is	c
my	c
favourite	c
sport	c
because	c
you	c
can	c
relax	c
your	c
body	c
and	c
your	c
mind	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
for	c
further	c
informations	i
about	c
this	c
travel	i

First	c
of	c
all	c
which	i
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	i
have	c
to	c
bring	c
with	c
me	c
?	c

And	c
if	c
during	c
the	c
nights	c
there	c
are	c
entrotenements	i
?	c

Thanks	c
for	c
all	c
these	i
informations	i
,	i
I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
you	i
again	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

After	c
the	c
discussion	c
that	c
we	c
had	c
in	c
the	c
english	i
class	c
,	c
I	c
understood	c
that	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
people	c
sometimes	c
do	c
n't	c
enjoy	c
during	i
the	i
shopping	c
.	c

I	c
ca	c
n't	c
understand	c
these	c
people	c
because	c
this	c
situation	i
never	c
happen	i
to	c
me	c
.	c

By	c
the	c
way	c
usually	i
the	c
people	c
that	i
do	c
n't	c
like	c
shopping	c
are	c
men	c
or	c
children	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
admit	c
that	c
sometimes	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
really	c
like	c
shopping	c
above	i
all	c
when	c
I	c
'm	c
tired	c
or	c
when	c
I	c
'm	c
not	c
in	c
the	c
right	c
mood	c
.	c

For	c
me	c
,	c
the	i
best	i
moments	i
for	i
the	i
shopping	i
are	i
two	i
opposite	i
situations	i
.	c

For	i
the	i
first	i
situation	i
happen	i
to	i
me	i
,	i
when	c
I	c
'm	c
hungry	i
with	c
somebody	c
really	c
close	c
to	c
me	c
like	c
my	c
boyfriend	c
or	c
a	c
component	i
of	c
my	c
family	c
,	c
so	c
for	i
relaxing	i
my	i
mind	i
I	c
go	c
to	i
shopping	c
and	c
usually	c
I	c
enjoy	c
a	i
lot	c
.	c

The	c
opposite	c
situation	c
is	c
when	c
I	c
pass	c
my	c
exams	c
and	c
I	c
really	c
need	c
to	c
buy	c
something	c
for	i
me	i
as	c
a	c
preseant	i
for	c
myself	c
.	c

Dear	c
Ms	c
Clark	c
,	c

I	c
had	i
recently	i
spent	i
two	c
days	c
at	c
your	c
annual	c
international	c
arts	c
festival	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
the	c
first	c
time	c
I	c
went	i
and	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
pleased	c
to	c
go	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
congratulate	c
you	c
on	c
making	i
this	c
kind	c
of	c
event	c
.	c

You	c
should	c
increase	c
the	c
number	c
of	c
places	c
you	c
give	i
.	c

Therefore	i
,	c
you	c
could	c
invite	c
artists	c
from	c
around	c
the	c
world	c
not	i
only	c
from	c
six	c
countries	c
:	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
more	c
pleasant	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
wondering	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
improve	c
that	c
?	c

Finally	c
I	i
suggest	c
to	i
invite	i
important	c
scientists	c
like	c
Hubert	c
Reeves	c
or	c
Aaroun	c
Tazief	c
so	c
as	c
to	c
inform	c
the	c
public	c
about	c
the	i
new	c
technologies	c
or	c
sciences	c
because	c
it	i
also	c
a	i
kind	c
of	c
art	c
!	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
recent	c
letter	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
n't	c
write	c
sooner	c
because	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
busy	c
last	c
week	c
.	c

I	c
see	c
you	c
are	c
interested	c
in	c
hearing	c
about	c
school	c
rules	c
in	c
France	c
and	c
also	c
about	c
what	c
I	c
am	c
allowed	c
or	i
not	c
to	c
do	c
at	c
home	c
.	c

Also	c
when	i
you	c
have	c
forgotten	c
to	c
do	c
your	c
homeworks	i
.	c

What	c
's	c
more	c
,	c
you	c
had	c
better	c
have	i
done	i
them	i
if	i
you	c
would	i
have	i
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
blackboard	c
!	c

Although	c
our	c
library	c
is	c
very	c
large	c
,	c
we	c
must	c
n't	c
make	c
noise	i
in	c
order	c
not	c
to	c
disturb	c
the	c
students	c
,	i
who	c
work	i
.	c

I	c
consider	c
the	c
school	c
rules	c
are	c
good	c
:	c
we	c
should	c
respect	c
the	c
teachers	c
and	c
people	c
who	c
need	c
to	c
work	c
.	c

If	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
make	i
the	c
cooking	c
,	c
I	c
will	c
have	c
to	c
do	c
the	c
washing	c
up	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
sometimes	c
allowed	c
to	c
watch	c
the	c
television	c
when	c
I	c
have	c
finished	c
my	c
homeworks	i
.	c

Fortunately	c
I	i
can	c
play	c
violin	i
when	c
I	c
want	c
even	i
if	c
I	c
have	c
n't	c
done	c
my	c
homework	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
what	c
I	c
like	c
most	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
really	c
want	c
to	c
change	c
that	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
just	i
like	c
this	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

Last	c
week	c
,	c
I	c
had	i
visited	i
your	c
theatre	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
disappointed	c
because	c
I	c
did	c
not	c
have	c
a	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
like	c
what	i
advertisement	i
said	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
complain	c
four	i
things	c
about	i
your	c
theatre	c
.	c

To	c
conclude	c
,	c
your	c
theatre	c
is	c
not	i
good	i
like	i
what	i
advertisement	i
said	i
so	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
for	c
some	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

The	c
technology	c
make	i
my	i
daily	i
life	i
change	i
a	c
lots	i
compare	i
to	i
the	i
past	i
.	c

Therefore	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
will	c
change	c
to	i
bad	c
ways	c
or	c
goods	c
ways	c
,	i
it	i
depends	c
on	c
how	c
I	c
use	c
the	c
technology	c
.	c

opportunity	c

when	c

we	c
will	c

Your	c

This	c
technologic	i
improvement	c
is	c
changing	c
people	c
's	c
lifes	i
,	c
behaviours	i
even	i
their	c
homes	c
.	c

Can	c
you	c
imagine	c
?	c

What	c
people	i
's	i
homes	i
will	i
it	i
be	i
like	c
in	c
fifty	c
years	i
time	c
?	c

Maybe	c
there	c
will	c
be	c
some	c
robots	c
to	c
do	c
our	c
ironings	i
,	c
washing	i
our	c
dishes	c
,	c
cleaning	i
everywhere	c
,	c
hoovering	i
,	c
etc.	c
Will	c
it	c
make	c
life	c
easier	c
?	c

We	c
can	c
get	c
everything	c
we	c
want	c
to	c
know	c
from	c
computers	c
.	c

It	c
means	c
we	c
wo	i
n't	i
need	i
to	c
go	c
somewhere	i
to	c
get	c
some	i
information	c
we	c
need	c
.	c

We	c
'll	c
be	c
stuck	c
to	c
our	c
computers	c
at	c
home	c
.	c

It	c
means	c
we	c
'll	c
lose	c
our	c
social	c
lifes	i
.	c

But	c
I	c
believe	c
human	i
will	c
never	c
forget	c
what	c
they	c
used	c
to	c
be	c
.	c

We'are	i
learning	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
things	c
about	c
life	c
.	i

Probably	i
our	i
homes	i
will	i
be	c
smaller	c
than	c
now	c
.	c

It	c
means	c
there	c
will	c
be	c
too	c
many	c
people	c
in	c
small	c
areas	c
.	c

We	c
'll	c
travel	c
around	c
to	i
space	c

Like	c
everything	c
our	c
homes	c
will	c
change	c

well	c

Dear	c
Madam	c
:	c

How	c
delighted	c
I	c
was	c
when	c
I	c
receved	i
your	c
letter	c
!	c

About	c
the	c
information	c
required	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
is	i
my	c
half	c
term	c
at	c
University	i
and	c
summer	i
time	i
would	c
be	c
ideal	c
.	c

In	i
relation	i
with	i
leisure	c
activities	c
,	c
my	c
favourites	i
are	i
Basketball	c
,	c
which	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
playing	c
for	c
two	c
years	c
because	i
I	c
have	c
been	c
selected	c
for	c
my	c
University	i
team	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
a	i
time	c
practising	c
with	c
players	c
from	c
different	c
countries	c
will	c
help	c
me	c
develop	c
my	c
skills	c
at	c
international	i
level	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
practise	i
tennis	c
,	c
which	c
is	c
my	c
hobby	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
helps	c
my	c
mind	c
to	c
keep	c
working	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
do	i
I	c
need	c
,	c
how	c
is	i
the	i
weather	i
in	i
order	c
to	c
pack	c
the	c
necessary	c
clothe	i
and	i
wheter	i
I	c
need	c
something	i
else	c
.	c

You	c
would	c
n't	c
believe	c
it	c
!	c

I	c
was	c
working	c
helping	c
to	c
mantle	i
and	c
dismantle	c
the	c
stage	c
,	i
sometimes	i
I	c
had	c
to	c
check	c
the	c
sound	c
by	c
saying	c
something	c
on	i
the	c
microphone	c
,	i
that	i
was	c
my	c
chance	c
and	c
I	c
always	c
pretended	c
to	c
be	c
a	c
singer	c
and	c
that	c
I	c
sand	i
in	c
duo	i
with	c
the	c
vocalist	c
of	c
the	c
group	c
,	i
it	i
was	c
such	c
a	i
great	c
fun	c
!	c

That	c
night	c
was	c
the	c
best	c
of	c
my	c
entire	c
life	c
.	c

I	c
send	i
you	c
some	c
pictures	c
,	c
the	c
best	c
ones	c
because	i
there	c
were	c
some	c
quite	c
embarrasing	i

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Ryan	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c

week	c

at	c
Camp	c

USA	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
as	c
I	c
feel	c
that	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
more	c
exciting	c
than	c
staying	c
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c

I	c
am	c
not	c
a	c
good	c
swimmer	c
yet	c
but	c
soon	c
I	c
will	c
be	c

I	c
have	c
not	c
been	c
practising	i
it	c
at	c
all	c
recently	c
but	c
only	c
wish	c
I	c
had	c
.	c

Do	c
you	c
suggest	c
me	i
to	i
take	i
cash	c
or	i
can	c
I	c
used	i
my	c
credit	c
card	c

Will	c
there	c
be	c
any	i
tour-guide	i
during	c
the	c

I	c
thank	c
you	c

quite	c
a	c

what	c
was	i
the	c

we	i

what	c

Another	c
disappointing	c
thing	c
was	c
that	c
you	c
did	c
not	c
explain	c
the	c
reason	c
why	c
it	c
was	c
delayed	c
by	i
20:15	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
when	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
I	c
found	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

Because	c
its	c
opening	c
time	c
was	c
from	c
10:00	c
to	c
17:00	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
not	c
need	c
to	c
tell	c
,	i
either	c
,	c
that	c
I	c
had	c
awful	i
evening	c
and	c
you	c
are	c
responsible	c
for	c
that	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

I	c
am	i
checking	i
my	c
e-mail	c
everyday	i
using	c
the	c
Internet	c
,	c
I	c
am	i
talking	i
to	c
my	c
friends	c
who	c
is	i
far	c
away	c
connecting	i
to	c
network	c
systems	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
am	i
taking	i
my	c
mobile	c
phone	c
.	c

For	i
recent	c
years	c
,	c
as	c
Information	c
Technology	c
has	c
been	c
improved	c
highly	i
,	c
communication	c
methods	c
have	c
been	c
changed	c
to	c
a	c
different	c
way	c
,	c
which	c
is	c
not	c
same	i
as	c
before	c
.	c

But	c
,	c
while	c
those	i
have	i
been	i
spread	i
all	c
over	c
the	c
world	c
,	c
I	c
and	c
all	c
the	c
other	c
people	c
who	c
I	c
have	c
known	c
became	i
to	c
use	c
them	c
.	c

I	c
can	c
find	c
out	c
some	c
information	c
at	c
home	c
,	c
although	c
I	c
do	c
not	c
go	c
to	c
library	i

I	c
am	c
able	c
to	c
meet	c
my	c
friends	c
quickly	c
in	i
Internet	i
just	i
clicking	c
the	c
mouse	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
causing	c
some	c
changes	c
to	i
me	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
now	c
I	c
would	c
rather	c
send	c
the	i
e-mail	c
than	c
the	i
letter	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
prefer	c
to	c
surf	c

when	c
I	c
need	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
pleased	c
to	c
hear	c
that	c
I	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
the	c
competition	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
stay	c
at	i
log	c
cabins	c
which	c
would	c
have	c
a	c
good	c
smell	c
of	c
nature	c
in	c
them	c
.	c

And	c
also	c
the	c
reason	c
why	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
surfing	c
is	c
that	c
I	c
am	c
always	c
dreaming	c
of	c
surfing	c
on	c
the	c
coast	c
of	c
California	c
like	c
on	c
TV	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
tried	c
to	c
surf	c
yet	c
,	c
which	c
doe	i
n't	i
mean	c
I	c
am	c
bad	c
at	c
swimming	c
.	c

When	c
you	c
spend	c
money	c
on	c
goods	c
and	c
services	c
,	c
it	c
gives	c
you	c
satisfaction	c
and	c
happiness	c
but	c
going	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
you	c
cannot	c
always	c
get	c
the	c
right	c
one	i
although	c
you	c
scour	c
about	i
all	c
the	c
shops	c
to	c
find	c
something	c
you	c
want	c
.	c

And	c
also	c
you	c
would	c
have	c
to	c
thread	c
your	c
way	c
between	c
the	c
shoppers	c
because	c
there	c
are	c
too	c
many	c
shoppers	c
,	c
especially	c
,	i
on	c
the	i
special	c
occasion	i
like	c
on	i
sale	i
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
you	c
cannot	c
exclude	i
that	c
you	c
might	c
get	c
a	i
pick-pocket	c
which	c
would	c
make	c
you	c
upset	c
and	c
irritated	c
when	c
you	c
think	c
of	c
that	i
you	c
could	c
avoid	c
it	c
and	c
that	c
you	c
could	c
take	c
less	c
money	c
in	c
your	c
wallet	c
from	i
home	i
.	c

In	c
addition	c
to	c
this	c
,	c
even	c
if	c
you	c
buy	c
something	c
you	c
would	i
like	c
,	c
you	c
can	c
change	c
your	c
mind	c
at	c
home	c
.	c

Dear	c
Edouard	c
,	c

Firstly	c
,	c
let	c
me	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
nice	c
letter	c
of	c
June	c
10th	c
.	c

In	c
response	c
to	c
your	c
question	c
and	c
if	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
mind	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
I	c
've	c
already	c
chosen	i
my	c
holiday	c

my	c
boss	c
wo	c
n't	c
give	c
me	c
another	c
one	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
no	i
more	i
a	i
young	i
girl	i
!	i
and	c
do	c
appreciate	c
a	c
little	c
bit	c
of	c
comfort	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
exactly	c
which	i
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
with	c
and	i
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	i
'll	i
be	i
supposed	i
to	c
spend	c
there	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
really	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	i
,	c

Shopping	c
is	c

everyday	c
life	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
a	c
mother	c
of	c
four	c
children	i
and	c
you	c
can	c
easily	c
imagine	c

things	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
buy	c
in	c
a	c
week	c
.	c

It	c
starts	c
with	c
food	c
(	c
monstruous	i
)	c
and	c
goes	c
on	c
with	i
clothes	c
,	c
pills	c
,	c
games	c
and	c
so	c
on	c
.	c

It	c
never	c
ends	c
!	c

To	c
be	c
fair	c
,	c
I	c
must	c
say	c
that	c
I	c
've	c
noticed	c
one	c
disadvantage	i
on	i
shopping	c
:	c
you	c
need	c
money	c
!	c

Dear	c
Mister	i
Robertson	c

The	c
programme	c
looks	c
very	c
good	c
,	c
especially	c
the	c
river	c
trip	c
to	c
Greenwich	c
.	c

We	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
because	c
it	c
only	c
takes	c
place	c
once	c
a	c
year	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
free	c
for	c
students	c
.	c

We	c
would	c
suggest	c
to	i
replace	i
the	c
shopping	c
part	i
on	c
Tuesday	c
afternoon	c
by	i
the	c
visit	c
of	i
the	c
show	c
.	c

The	c
home	c
of	c
the	c
future	c

The	c
view	c
from	c
outside	c
will	c
mainly	c
be	c
the	c
same	c
.	c

A	c
simple	c
and	c
well-proofen	i
architecture	c
.	c

The	c
doors	c
would	c
be	c
the	c
entrance	c
to	c
another	c
world	c
....	c

Every	c
electronic	c
gadget	c
in	c
the	c
futur	i
home	c
will	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
comunicate	i
with	c
other	c
machines	c
or	c
computers	c
.	c

It	c
will	c
be	c
possible	c
to	c
connect	c
to	c
the	c
Internet	c
from	c
nearly	c
everywhere	c
in	c
the	c
house	c
or	c
flat	c
.	c

All	c
the	c
big	c
and	c
small	c
things	c
which	c
are	i
defining	i
people	c
's	c
personal	c
environment	c
will	c
be	c
left	c
nearly	c
unchanged	c
-	c
the	c
furniture	c
,	c
the	c
pictures	c
on	c
the	c
wall	c

Dear	c
Mrs.	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
received	c
your	c
letter	c
last	c
monday	i
.	c

I	c
want	c
to	c
say	c
thank	c
you	c
that	i
I	i
was	i
the	c
lucky	c
person	c
who	c
won	c
that	c
competition	c
.	c

It	c
will	c
be	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
United	c
States	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
so	c
happy	c
about	c
that	c
,	i
I	c
can	i
not	i
explain	c
it	c
.	c

About	c
the	c
date	c
,	i
when	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
travel	c
can	i
I	c
say	c
that	c
it	c
is	c
only	c
possible	c
for	c
me	c
on	i
July	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
do	c
some	c
exams	c
at	c
the	i
school	c
.	c

As	i
activities	c
I	i
can	c
say	c
that	c
I	c
like	c
every	c
sport	c
,	c
but	c
basketball	c
and	c
tennis	c
would	c
be	c
perfect	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

In	c
basketball	c
I	c
have	c
more	i
practise	i
then	i
in	c
tennis	c
.	c

I	c
play	c
every	c
weekend	c
on	i
competitions	c
with	c
my	c
local	c
team	c
and	c
about	i
tennis	i
it	i
is	i
that	i
I	i
tried	i
but	i
it	i
is	i
not	i
like	i
my	i
basketball	i
experience	i
.	c

Also	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
know	c
how	c
much	i
clothes	c
and	c
money	i
I	c
would	i
need	c
for	c
these	c
two	c
weeks	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
I	c
can	c
hear	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

On	c
my	c
first	c
day	c
I	c
should	i
help	i
to	c
bring	c
the	c
staff	i
for	c
the	c
band	c
,	c
things	c
like	c
guitars	c
,	c
drums	c
and	c
others	i
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
two	c
days	c
I	c
helped	c
to	c
prepare	c
the	c
breakfast	c
,	c
lunch	c
and	c
diner	i
for	c
the	c
band	c
.	c

You	c
are	c
always	c
so	c
near	c
to	c
these	c
people	c
and	c
after	c
a	c
while	c
it	c
is	c
normal	c
to	c
stay	c
and	c
chat	c
with	c
Brian	c
Adams	c
,	c
for	c
example	c
.	c

I	c
realy	i
enjoyed	c
that	c
and	c
it	c
was	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
greatest	c
,	c
when	i
not	c
the	c
greatest	c
experience	c
in	i
my	c
life	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
good	i
paid	i
job	c
with	i
15	c
pounds	c
per	c
hour	c
,	i
what	i
do	i
you	i
can	i
say	c
.	i

I	c
could	c
n't	c
believe	c
it	c
but	c
he	c
gave	c
me	c
the	c
contract	c
to	i
fill	i
it	i
out	i
.	c

I	c
hope	c
Kim	i
you	i
was	i
not	c
too	c
jealous	c
about	c
that	c
,	c
sorry	c
.	c

Please	c
write	c
me	i
soon	c
,	i
I	c
'm	c
waiting	c
.	c

Loves	i

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
the	c
prize	c
.	c

I	c
turned	i
crazy	c
when	c
I	c
knew	c
I	c
was	c
the	c
winner	c
of	c
your	c
competition	c
.	c

So	c
let	c
's	c
answer	c
the	c
question	c
you	c
told	i
me	c
to	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
make	c
that	i
two	c
weeks	c
there	c
as	c
funnier	i
as	c
possible	c
.	c

You	c
asked	c
me	c
when	c
would	i
I	i
like	c
to	c
travel	c
to	c
California	c
.	c

Definitely	c
,	c
in	c
July	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
just	i
the	i
sleeping	i
one	i
.	c

It	c
just	i
keeps	c
you	c
in	c
touch	c
with	c
nature	c
.	c

That	c
's	c
what	c
camping	c
is	c
about	c
,	c
is	c
n't	c
it	c
?	c

If	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
choose	c
two	c
of	c
them	c
I	c
'll	c
take	c
tennis	c
first	c
.	c

Ca	c
n't	c
say	c
the	c
same	c
about	c
golf	c
.	c

It	c
will	c
be	c
my	c
first	c
experience	c
with	i
the	i
putt	i
.	c

One	c
thing	c
you	c
have	c
not	c
told	c
me	c
is	c
weather	i
I	c
have	c
to	c
pay	c
all	i
things	i
by	i
my	i
own	i
in	c
California	c
or	c
not	c
.	c

Please	c
,	c
let	c
me	c
know	c
.	c

Waiting	c
for	c
your	c
answer	c
,	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

As	c
I	c
told	c
you	c
in	c
my	c
previous	c
letter	c
I	c
finally	c
had	c
the	c
opportunity	c
to	c
take	c
part	c
on	i
the	c
Sting	c
concert	c
here	c
in	c
Segovia	c
.	c

The	c
part	c
I	c
enjoyed	c
most	c
was	c
the	c
one	c
when	c
they	c
paid	c
me	c
.	c

Next	c
time	c
come	c
with	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
Ernestina	c
is	c
coming	c
to	c
the	c
city	c
very	c
soon	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Ryan	c
!	c

You	c
asked	c
me	c
few	c
questions	c
in	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
answer	c
.	c

I	c
can	c
come	c
to	c
USA	c
on	i
July	c
becouse	i
on	i
August	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
working	c
with	c
my	c
father	c
.	c

We	c
are	c
building	c
a	c
new	c
house	c
for	c
our	c
family	c
.	c

What	c
about	c
accommodation	c
,	i
I	c
prefer	c
tents	c
to	c
log	c
cabins	c
.	c

Nights	c
in	i
hol	i
.	i

on	i
July	c
are	c
hot	c
.	c

Tent	i
will	c
be	c
more	i
cooler	i
to	c
sleep	c
then	i
the	i
cabin	c
.	c

You	c
offer	c
a	c
great	c
veriety	i
of	c
activities	c
.	c

My	c
best	c
sports	c
disciplines	c
are	c
swimming	c
and	c
basketball	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
a	c
life	c
guard	c
and	c
I	c
could	c
work	c
in	c
your	c
camp	c
as	c
a	c
rescuer	c
next	c
summer	c
.	c

Basketball	c
is	c
the	c
game	c
which	c
I	c
love	c
.	c

I	c
always	c
watch	c
the	c
NBA	c
matches	c
on	c
T.V.	c
It	c
will	c
be	c
great	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
train	i
basketball	c
in	c
USA	i
.	c

How	c
much	c
money	c
should	c
I	c
take	c
with	c
me	c
and	c
what	c
sort	c
of	c
clothes	c
are	c
requested	i

Thank	c
You	c
.	c

Shoping	i
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

People	c
alwas	i
queued	c
for	c
stuff	c
from	c
west	i
.	c

If	c
you	c
had	c
wanted	c
something	c
special	c
for	c
example	c
for	c
a	c
gift	c
you	c
had	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
line	c
all	c
night	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
the	c
worst	c
side	c
of	c
shopping	c
in	c
Poland	c
couple	i
years	i
ago	c
.	c

I	c
apprieciate	i
this	i
shops	c
for	c
lots	c
of	c
products	c
,	c
cheep	i
prices	c
end	i
big	c
spaces	c
.	c

But	c
the	c
problem	c
is	c
when	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
buy	c
only	c
one	c
thing	c
,	c
for	c
example	c
bread	c
.	c

On	c
Friedy	i
evening	c
and	c
at	i
on	c
the	c
weekdays	c
each	i
supermarkets	c
are	c
crowded	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
not	c
like	c
crowded	c
places	c
.	c

Last	c
weak	i
,	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
London	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
musical	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
.	c

But	c
what	c
I	c
saw	c
was	c
exactly	c
the	c
opposite	c
I	i
expected	c
.	c

Maybe	c
you	c
could	c
explain	c
to	c
me	c
,	i
what	c
the	c
problems	c
were	c
.	c

But	c
these	c
are	c
only	c
little	c
problems	c
.	c

The	c
most	c
disappointing	c
thing	c
was	c
that	c
there	c
were	c
diffrent	i
actors	c
which	i
were	c
not	c
very	c
good	c
in	i
acting	c
.	c

And	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
we	c
did	c
n't	c
know	c
what	c
to	c
do	c
with	c
the	c
rest	c
of	c
the	c
evening	c
,	c
because	c
we	c
actually	c
wanted	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
Theatre	c
Restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
n't	c
realy	i
a	c
perfect	c
evening	c
like	i
you	c
promised	c
on	c
your	c
flyer	c
.	c

I	c
will	c
tell	c
everyone	c
I	c
know	c
how	c
bad	c
it	c
was	c
.	c

Today	c
,	c
everyone	c
has	c
the	c
opertunity	i
to	c
just	c
get	c
into	c
a	c
car	c
and	c
drive	c
to	i
where	i
ever	i
they	c
want	c
to	c
.	c

Modern	c
technology	c
also	c
allows	c
you	c
to	c
go	c
into	i
the	c
Internet	c
to	c
get	c
any	c
information	c
you	c
need	c
.	c

Every	i
production	i
is	c
much	c
faster	c
and	c
cheaper	c
than	c
before	c
,	c
because	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
to	c
pay	c
for	c
worker	i
anymore	c
.	c

The	c
only	c
and	c
simple	c
advantage	c
of	c
modern	c
technology	c
is	c
just	c
taking	c
the	c
work	c
from	c
us	c
so	c
we	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
to	c
do	c
anything	c
anymore	c
.	c

Another	c
disadvantage	c
is	c
that	c
every	i
one	i
becomes	c
a	c
bit	c
more	c
lonely	c
because	c
they	c
wath	i
TV	c
or	c
play	c
or	c
work	c
with	i
the	c
Computer	c
and	c
do	c
n't	c
see	c
each	c
other	c
any	i
more	i
because	c
they	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
to	c
.	c

You	c
never	c
get	c
bored	c
.	c

Let	c
me	c
tell	c
you	c
now	c
how	c
everything	c
really	c
was	c
.	c

The	c
add	i
also	c
mentioned	c
discounts	c
,	c
but	c
that	c
was	c
n't	c
true	c
either	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
for	c
these	c
reasons	c
that	c
I	c
expect	c
a	c
full	c
refund	c
of	c
the	c
ticket	c
prize	i
,	i
it	i
is	c
my	c
right	c
as	c
a	c
paying	c
customer	c
to	c
get	c
what	c
I	c
have	c
paid	c
for	c
.	c

Looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

We	c
can	c
do	c
things	c
our	c
grandparents	c
could	c
only	c
dream	c
of	c
.	c

Internet	i
,	c
I	c
think	c
,	c
is	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
inventions	c
in	c
the	c
history	c
of	c
humanity	c
.	c

But	c
technology	c
is	c
becoming	c
more	c
and	c
more	c
complicated	c
,	c
and	c
new	c
things	c
are	c
invented	c
every	c
day	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
our	c
life	i
will	c
be	c
completely	c
different	c
in	c
forty	c
years	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
really	c
surprised	c
about	c
the	c
free	c
journey	i
to	c
California	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
've	c
never	c
ever	c
won	c
anything	c
before	c
.	c

In	c
August	c
I	c
am	c
going	c
to	c
work	c
in	c
an	c
office	c
,	c
so	c
there	c
is	c
not	i
possibility	c
to	i
travel	i
away	i
this	i
month	c
.	c

For	c
one	c
night	c
it	c
would	c
not	c
disturb	i
me	c
to	c
sleep	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
,	c
but	c
for	c
a	c
period	c
of	c
two	c
weeks	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
too	c
uncomfortable	c
.	c

Once	c
my	c
family	c
and	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
Greece	c
and	c
rent	i
a	c
sailing	c
boat	c
for	c
three	c
weeks	c
.	c

Because	c
most	i
of	i
the	i
work	i
did	i
my	i
parents	i
,	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
exactly	c
how	c
to	c
handle	c
a	c
sailing	c
boat	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
giving	c
me	c
the	c
chance	c
to	c
discover	c
a	c
new	c
type	c
of	c
landscape	c
!	c

Once	c
you	c
've	c
found	c
you	i
should	c
take	c
everything	c
you	c
like	c
and	c
go	c
into	c
the	c
cabin	i
.	c

It	c
's	c
a	c
big	c
advantage	c
to	c
go	c
shopping	c
with	c
a	c
friend	c
,	c
because	c
he	c
or	c
she	c
can	c
bring	c
you	c
all	c
the	c
clothes	c
in	c
a	i
suitable	i
size	c
if	c
the	c
one	i
you	c
took	c
does	c
n't	c
fit	c
.	c

Often	c
it	c
happens	c
that	c
the	c
salesman	c
has	c
n't	c
got	c
the	c
size	c
you	c
need	c
and	c
that	c
's	c
always	c
a	c
pity	c
.	c

After	c
trying	c
on	c
about	c
twenty	c
different	c
tops	c
,	c
dresses	c
or	c
jeans	c
your	c
legs	c
and	c
your	c
back	c
start	c
to	c
hurt	c
terribly	c
.	c

At	i
the	i
end	i
you	c
may	c
have	c
found	c
only	c
two	c
or	c
three	c
things	c
you	c
really	c
like	c
,	c
but	c
they	c
are	c
all	i
the	i
work	i
worth	i
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c

As	c
I	c
thought	c
your	c
advertisement	c
was	c
interesting	c
,	c
I	c
went	c
there	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
good	i
as	c
it	c
should	c
be	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
it	c
ought	c
to	c
start	c
at	c
19:30	c
but	c
it	c
really	c
started	c
at	c
20:30	c
.	c

According	c
to	c
the	c
advertisement	c
,	c
the	i
discounts	c
were	i
available	c
.	c

In	c
fact	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
pay	c
the	c
full	c
price	c
which	i
costed	i
me	c
£	c
15	c
.	c

As	i
I	i
have	i
informed	i
you	i
all	i
the	i
fact	i
,	c
I	c
think	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
not	c
worth	c
the	c
money	c
I	c
paid	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
want	c
the	i
refund	c
for	i
£	c
15	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c
.	c

The	c
next	c
day	c
,	c
Pat	c
told	c
everybody	c
what	c
she	c
had	c
heard	c
from	c
Jan	c
,	c
so	c
when	c
the	c
news	c
came	c
to	c
teachers	i
'	c
ears	c
,	c
the	c
teachers	c
decided	c
to	c
give	c
Tim	c
grade	i
F	c
in	c
that	c
subject	c
and	c
tell	c
his	c
parents	c
!	c
!	c

He	c
was	c
furious	c
with	c
Jan	c
,	c
so	c
what	c
happened	c
was	c
Jan	c
was	c
bullied	c
but	c
not	c
because	c
of	c
her	c
fault	i
,	i
it	i
was	c
Pat	c
's	c
.	c

Actually	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
was	c
right	c
to	c
tell	c
the	c
teachers	c
but	c
not	c
in	c
Pat	c
's	c
way	c
.	c

It	c
would	c
have	c
been	c
better	c
for	c
both	c
Pat	c
and	c
Jan	c
if	c
they	c
had	c
told	c
the	c
teachers	c
privately	c
and	c
secretly	c
because	c
Tim	c
would	i
have	i
n't	i
known	c
who	c
had	c
told	c
the	c
teachers	c
.	c

If	c
all	c
of	c
us	c
try	c
to	c
help	c
her	c
,	c
I	c
'm	c
sure	c
that	c
we	c
can	c
make	i
her	i
a	i
better	i
school	i
life	i
.	c

So	c
I	c
will	c
answer	c
you	i
about	i
this	i
different	i
points	i
.	c

Between	i
your	c
different	c
activities	c
,	c
I	c
will	i
like	c
to	c
practice	i
:	c

Surfing	c
because	c
I	c
never	c
do	c
it	c
and	c
I	c
will	i
like	c
to	c
learn	c
it	i
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
answer	i
my	c
different	c
questions	c
.	c

Salutations	i

In	c
England	c
,	c
there	i
are	i
n't	i
paper	i
for	i
make	i
a	i
present	i
.	c

It	c
's	c
different	c
than	i
the	c
other	c
European	c
countries	c
.	c

Sometimes	c
the	c
sales	i
women	i
are	c
n't	c
friendship	i
,	c
because	c
they	c
have	i
some	i
stress	i
or	c
they	c
are	i
n't	i
the	i
sale	i
feeling	i
.	c

Finally	c
I	c
think	c
,	i
it	c
will	c
be	c
better	c
if	c
the	c
shops	c
stay	c
open	c
until	c
7.30	c
pm	c
(	c
half	c
past	c
seven	c
)	c
.	c

One	c
of	c
them	c
is	c
basketball	c
,	c
which	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
playing	c
for	c
over	c
seven	c
years	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
the	c
captain	c
of	c
my	c
university	c
basketball	c
team	c
.	c

I	c
go	c
to	c
elementary	c
school	c
to	c
teach	c
children	c
how	c
to	c
play	c
tennis	c
every	c
Wednesday	c
and	c
Friday	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
therefore	c
writing	c
to	c
enquire	c
about	c
some	c
things	c
.	c

Lastly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
how	c
many	c
people	c
are	c
comming	i
to	c
the	c
Camp	c
I	c
will	c
go	c
.	i

I	c
sould	i
be	c
grateful	c
if	c
you	c
would	c
send	c
me	c
further	i
information	c
that	c
I	c
asked	c
and	i
I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c

This	c

Not	c
surprisingly	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
,	c
in	i
the	i
name	i
of	i
all	c
the	c
students	c
in	c
my	c

tell	c
you	c
about	c
our	c

I	c
would	c
also	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
the	c
good	i
programme	c
you	c
made	i
for	c
us	c
,	c
especially	i
the	c
river	c
trip	c
to	c
Greenwich	c
might	c
be	c
fascinating	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
about	c
the	c
show	c
which	c
we	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
see	c
:	c
It	c
is	c
"	c
The	c
London	c
Fashion	c

,	c
make	i
up	i
and	c
hairstyles	c
will	c
be	c
shown	c
in	i
this	c
occasion	c

We	c
think	c
that	c
this	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
because	c
it	c
takes	c
part	i
only	c
once	c
a	c

on	c

of	c
all	c

We	c
suggest	c
to	i

yours	c
sincerely	c

I	c
had	c
absolutely	c
no	c
choice	c
.	c

We	c
had	c
walked	c
for	c
three	c
hours	c
(	c
my	c
mother	c
,	c
my	c
two	c
brother	i
and	c
I	c
)	c
through	c
the	c
humid	c
and	c
noisy	c
jungle	c
,	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
reach	i
a	c
small	c
but	c
clean	c
house	c
where	c
a	c
nice	c
and	c
friendly	c
family	c
,	c
old	c
friends	c
of	c
us	i
,	c
used	c
to	c
live	c
.	c

The	c
path	c
we	c
were	c
walking	c
in	i
was	c
quite	c
clean	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
feeling	c
really	c
happy	c
and	c
relaxed	c
...	c
until	c
we	c
reached	c
a	c
river	c
.	c

There	c
were	i
nor	i
bridge	i
nor	c
a	c
canoe	c
,	i
the	i
only	c
way	c
to	c
cross	c
it	c
was	c
walking	i
on	c
an	i
old	i
big	i
trunk	i
which	c
was	c
lying	c
down	c
,	c
peacefully	c
,	c
making	c
the	c
only	c
connection	i
between	c
our	c
side	c
and	c
the	c
other	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
easier	c
than	c
I	c
had	c
thought	c
!	c
.	i

That	c
day	c
,	c
I	c
learnt	c
that	c
I	c
can	c
do	i
even	i
things	c
which	c
,	c
at	c
first	c
sight	c
,	c
seem	c
impossible	c
to	c
be	i
done	i
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
informing	c
that	c
I	c
won	c
the	c
prize	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
pleased	c
to	c
hear	c
that	c

Owing	c

take	c

in	c
August	c
,	c
July	c
is	c
the	c
only	c
month	c
I	c
have	c
free	c
time	c
.	c

With	c
regard	c
to	c
place	i
to	c
stay	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
be	c
most	c
grateful	c
if	c
I	c
could	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
.	c

Since	c
I	c
have	c
studied	c
photography	c
for	c
several	c
years	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
take	c
some	c
picture	i
of	c
beautiful	c
scenaries	i
in	c
California	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
should	c
take	c
there	c
,	c
and	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
would	c
need	c

I	c
look	c

Although	c
shopping	c
is	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
most	c
popular	c
ways	c
to	c
reduce	c
your	c
stress	c
,	c
this	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
the	c
case	c
.	c

That	c
's	c
not	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
the	c
story	c

You	c
need	c
to	c
go	c
home	c
with	c
bulky	c
bags	c

The	c
only	c
time	c
I	c
can	c
travel	c
to	c
U.S.A	i
is	c

,	c
because	c
that	c
is	c
the	c
only	c

I	c
can	c
leave	c
my	c

Other	c

About	c
the	c
accommodation	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
,	c
I	c
would	c

'm	c

very	c
out	i
door	i

who	c
like	i
to	c
go	c
camping	c
and	c
hiking	c

so	c
staying	i
in	i
a	c
tents	i
is	c
like	c
a	c
second	c
home	c
to	c
me	c
.	c

The	c
two	c
activities	c
that	c
I	c
could	i
like	c
to	c
do	c
are	c
Tennis	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
!	c

I	c
went	c
in	c
for	c
your	c
competition	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
really	c
anxious	c
about	c
the	c
results	c
.	c

Therefore	c
it	c
would	i
be	i
my	c
pleasure	c
to	c
reply	c
to	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
arrive	c
at	c
the	c
Camp	c
in	c
July	c
if	c
that	c
is	c
possible	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
working	c
and	c
I	c
will	c
not	c
have	c
spare	c
time	c
before	c
this	i
month	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
rather	c
live	i
in	c
a	c
tent	c
than	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
be	c
close	c
to	c
nature	c
I	i
adore	c
the	c
sound	c
of	c
the	c
wind	c
,	c
trees	c
,	c
animals	c
and	c
everything	c
which	c
is	i
surrounding	i
.	i

I	i
could	i
feel	i
the	i
environment	i
.	c

Thirdly	c
,	c
as	i
far	i
as	i
the	c
activities	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
choose	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
swimming	c
as	i
well	i
as	i
tennis	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
gained	c
some	c
experience	c
in	c
playing	c
tennis	c
due	c
to	c
the	c
tennis	c
court	c
that	c
we	c
used	c
to	c
have	c
at	c
home	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
sports	i
a	i
lot	i
so	i
apart	c
from	c
tennis	i
I	c
am	c
a	c
member	c
in	i
our	c
local	c
swimming	c
centre	c
.	c

Is	c
the	c
weather	c
changeable	c
?	c

I	c
was	c
also	c
wondering	c
if	c
I	c
will	c
need	c
any	c
money	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
appreciate	c
if	i
you	c
could	c
let	c
me	c
know	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
tried	c
to	c
be	c
as	c
helpful	c
as	c
possible	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
about	c
my	c
previous	i
experience	c
.	c

I	c
know	c
how	c
impatient	c
you	c
are	c
about	i
it	c
and	c
I	c
just	c
want	c
to	c
let	c
you	c
know	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
something	i
amazing	c
!	c

As	c
I	c
've	c
told	c
you	c
,	c
last	c
month	c
I	c
went	c
at	i
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
and	c
I	c
really	c
enjoy	i
helping	c
with	c
the	c
preparation	c
.	c

It	c
took	c
place	c
in	c
a	c
huge	c
stadium	c
which	c
had	c
over	c
4.000	i
seats	c
for	c
the	c
"	c
spactetors	i
"	c
if	c
you	c
can	c
call	c
them	c
like	i
this	i
.	c

Can	c
you	c
imagine	c
?	c

Another	c
thing	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
was	c
help	c
the	c
staff	c
to	c
tranfer	i
some	c
equipment	c
.	c

We	c
had	c
to	c
be	c
very	c
careful	c
.	c

You	c
do	c
n't	c
even	c
want	c
to	c
know	c
.	c

I	c
've	c
learned	c
the	c
meaning	c
of	c
the	c
words	c
"	c
reliability	c
"	c
and	c
"	c
responsibility	c
"	c
.	c

Anyway	c
the	c
result	c
of	c
the	c
whole	c
preparation	c
is	c
far	i
more	c
enjoyable	c
and	c
relaxing	c
.	c

Best	c

The	c
theater	i

no	c

We	c
are	c
in	c
the	c
same	c
maths	c
set	c
so	c
I	c
met	c
him	c
rather	c
soon	c
.	c

He	c
was	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
first	c
people	c
who	c
I	c
get	i
know	i
.	c

After	c
a	c
few	c
days	c
he	c
was	c
already	c
my	c
best	c
friend	c
.	c

Her	c
name	c
was	c
Marine	c
.	c

I	c
saw	c
her	c
as	c
a	c
perfect	c
girl	c
with	c
who	i
I	c
fallen	i
in	c
love	c
with	i
.	c

So	c
one	c
day	c
she	c
offered	i
to	i
me	c
to	c
come	c
to	c
her	c
house	c
at	c
night	c
and	c
to	c
do	c
so	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
run	c
away	c
from	c
our	c
boarding	c
house	c
and	c
that	c
was	c
illigal	i
.	c

Unfortunately	c
for	c
me	c
Pat	c
at	c
the	c
time	c
went	i
to	c
toilet	i
and	c
saw	c
me	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
asked	c
him	c
to	c
keep	c
it	c
in	i
secret	c
.	c

Next	c
day	c
my	c
best	c
friend	c
went	c
to	c
headmaster	i
and	c
told	c
him	c
about	c
me	c
so	c
he	c
gave	i
me	c
a	i
sespend	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
your	i
advertisement	c
about	i
the	c
"	c
London	c
Fashion	c
"	c
and	c
"	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
"	c
.	c

What	c
is	c
more	c
they	c
are	c
the	i
Leisure	i
and	i
sports	i
wear	i
,	c
which	c
we	c
are	c
keen	c
on	c
seeing	c
it	i
.	c

As	c
you	c
know	c
,	c
all	c
of	c
us	c
want	c
to	c
join	i
the	c
programme	c
,	c
so	c
if	c
some	c
students	c
go	c
to	c
Science	i
Museum	c
,	c
they	c
will	c
miss	c
the	c
wonderful	c
show	c
.	c

For	c
that	c
reason	c
,	c
I	c
suggest	c
that	c
you	c
could	c
change	c
the	c
activities	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
sorry	c
to	c
make	i
your	i
inconveint	i
.	c

I	c
hope	c
it	c
does	c
n't	c
make	i
some	i
trouble	c
if	c
you	c
accept	c
my	c
suggestion	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
see	c
sadness	c
in	c
my	c
father	c
's	c
eyes	c
.	c

My	c
mother	c
came	c
over	c
to	c
me	c
and	c
said	c
softly	c
,	c
;	i
my	i
dear	c
,	c
your	c
father	c
's	c
company	c
has	c
jut	i
gone	c
bankrupt	c
'	c
,	c
then	c
she	c
could	c
n't	c
help	c
crying	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
hear	i
this	c
bad	c
news	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
depressed	c
because	c
father	c
worked	c
quite	c
hard	c
for	c
his	c
company	c
.	c

My	c
father	c
always	c
remembered	c
his	c
responsibily	i
was	c
giving	i
good	i
salary	i
to	i
his	i
worker	i
,	c
which	c
is	c
the	c
view	i
of	c
his	c
life	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
must	c
find	c
out	i
a	c
solution	i
which	i
can	i
help	i
my	c
great	c
father	c
.	c

One	c
day	c
,	c
I	c
suddenly	c
got	i
a	c
good	c
idea	c
.	c

'	c
Why	c
not	c
go	c
to	c
sock	i
exchange	c
?	c
'	c

I	c
said	c
to	c
myself	c
.	c

Almost	c
every	c
day	c
I	c
stayed	i
in	i
there	c
and	c
research	i
the	c
exchange	c
decline-line	c
,	c
which	c
give	i
me	c
lots	c
of	c
information	c
from	i
there	i
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
decide	i
to	c
join	c
the	i
dangerous	c
game	c
,	c
which	c
will	i
lost	i
everything	c
or	c
suddenly	c
become	i
millionaire	i
.	c

'	c
Surely	c
it	c
does	c
n't	c
mean	c
that	c
they	c
have	c
learnt	c
the	c
exciting	c
news	c
?	c
'	c

Now	c
,	c
they	c
are	c
both	c
prouding	i
of	c
me	c
!	c

Dear	c
Mr.	c
Robertson	c
.	i

Especially	i
,	i
we	i
are	i
interested	c
in	c
the	c
sightseeing	c
by	c
bus	c
on	c
Monday	c
morning	c
and	c
the	c
river	c
trip	c
to	c
Greenwich	c
at	i
the	c
afternoon	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
the	c
students	c
in	c
our	c
class	c
have	c
seen	c
an	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
at	c
the	c
Central	c
Exhibition	c
Hall	c
of	c
London	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
from	c
10	c
am	c
to	c
7	c
p.m.	c
All	c
of	c
us	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
because	i
of	i
the	c
following	c
reasons	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
there	c
will	c
be	c
leisur	i
and	c
sports	c
wear	c
and	c
the	c
latest	c
fasions	i
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
the	i
entrance	c
for	c
students	c
is	c
free	c
.	c

Instead	c
of	c
Wednesday	i
's	i
afternoon	i
free	c
time	c
we	c
could	c
visit	c
the	c
Science	c
Museum	c
.	c

And	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
we	c
will	c
enjoy	c
the	c
London	c
fasion	i
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
till	c
19.00	c
.	c

After	c
all	i
we	i
will	i
be	c
able	c
go	i
shopping	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
recieving	i
your	c
positive	c
reply	c
.	c

For	c
the	i
further	c
details	c
you	c
can	c
contact	c
me	c
my	i
phone	c
number	i
.	c

Famous	c
people	c
.	c

We	c
intrsted	i
in	c
politicians	i
's	i
and	c
film	c
stars	i
's	i
wear	i
,	c
hobbys	i
,	c
passions	c
and	c
the	i
intrigues	c
.	c

The	i
lardge	i
numbers	c
of	c
the	i
journalists	c
following	c
them	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
,	c
even	i
in	i
there	i
private	i
life	i
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
each	c
human	c
being	c
has	c
rights	i
to	c
be	c
free	c
.	c

We	c
can	c
go	c
for	c
a	c
wolk	i
,	c
go	c
shopping	c
go	i
to	c
the	c
cinema	c
,	c
marrige	i
or	c
devorce	i
.	c

I	c
think	c
,	i
they	c
must	i
have	c
a	c
normal	c
,	i
private	c
life	c
without	c
journalists	c
following	c
them	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
and	c
without	c
any	c
exact	i
details	c
about	c
them	c
in	i
the	c
different	c
newspaper	i
's	i
curiouses	i
.	c

I	c
was	c
not	c
satified	i
with	c
the	c
show	c
at	c
all	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
very	c
different	c
from	c
the	c
information	i
your	c
advertisement	c
had	c
stated	i
.	c

First	c
,	c
I	c
expected	c
to	c
see	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
but	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
appeared	c
without	c
any	c
explanation	c
.	i

Secondly	c
,	c
although	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
,	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
closed	c
at	c
the	c
usual	c
time	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
not	c
able	c
to	c
eat	c
dinner	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
planned	c
to	c
have	c
dinner	c
there	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

What	c
is	c
worse	c
,	c
the	c
ticket	c
price	c
was	c
not	c
reduced	c
despite	c
the	c
fact	c
that	c
I	c
showed	c
my	c
student	c
ID	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
just	c
an	c
usual	i
day	c
.	c

I	c
did	c
n't	c
mind	c
telling	c
her	c
about	c
my	c
cousin	c
,	i
actually	i
he	c
is	c
n't	c
different	c
from	c
other	c
boys	c
at	c
all	c
,	i
he	i
just	i
has	i
sweet-looking	c
.	c

Next	i
day	c
,	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
school	c
as	c
usual	c
and	c
got	i
agog	c
at	c
a	i
large	c
number	c
of	c
girls	c
waiting	c
for	c
me	c
around	c
my	c
rocker	i
.	c

They	c
all	c
seemed	c
to	c
want	c
to	c
be	c
my	c
best	c
friend	c
,	c
and	c
only	c
Pat	c
seemed	c
to	c
be	c
happy	c
to	c
be	c
my	c
best	c
friend	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
this	c
letter	c
to	c
you	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
your	c
Circle	c
theatre	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
I	i
must	c
say	c
that	c
"	c
over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
"	c
is	c
not	c
the	i
London	i
newest	c
and	c
best	c
musical	c
show	c
,	c
for	c
many	c
reasons	c
:	c

In	c
your	c
advertisement	c
I	c
read	c
the	c
times	c
,	i
it	i
was	i
14.30	c
and	c
10.30	c
,	c
however	c
it	i
started	c
20.15	i
!	c

So	c
I	i
've	i
been	i
doing	c
the	i
nothing	c
for	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
and	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
like	c
to	c
lose	i
my	c
time	c
,	c
and	c
what	c
about	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
?	c
,	i
where	i
were	c
they	c
the	i
last	c
weekend	c
?	c
the	i
last	i
weekend	c
in	i
the	c
theatre	c
was	i
a	c
different	c
actor	c
who	c
was	c
disappointing	c
.	c

I	c
want	c
the	i
money	c
back	c
,	i
if	i
you	c
do	c
n't	c
give	c
it	c
to	i
me	i
back	i
,	c
I	c
will	i
intend	c
to	c
write	c
to	c
the	c
press	c
and	c
explain	i
everything	c
,	c
and	c
of	c
course	c
I	c
wo	c
n't	c
be	c
the	c
only	c
one	c
.	c

On	i
day	c
we	c
decided	c
to	c
write	c
a	c
special	c
letter	c
to	c
Pat	c
;	c
in	c
the	c
letter	c
we	c
told	c
him	c
that	c
we	c
felt	i
in	c
love	c
,	c
we	c
were	c
a	c
beautiful	c
girl	c
with	c
long	c
hair	c
and	c
green	c
eyes	c
(	c
as	i
Pat	i
likes	i
women	i
)	c
.	c

We	c
laughed	c
and	c
explained	c
him	i
that	c
we	c
were	c
who	i
wrote	c
that	i
letters	c
,	c
and	c
made	c
him	c
promises	i
that	c
when	c
he	c
gets	c
a	c
secret	c
lover	c
,	c
a	c
real	c
one	c
,	c
do	i
n't	i
tell	c
anyone	c
because	c
he	i
wo	c
n't	c
meet	c
her	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

The	c
show	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
start	c
at	c
half	c
past	c
seven	c
and	c
started	c
a	i
quarter	c
past	c
eight	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
incredible	c
.	c

Apart	c
from	c
that	c
,	c
the	c
advertisement	c
mention	i
that	c
there	c
were	c
discounts	c
available	c
,	c
and	c
there	c
were	c
not	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
that	c
the	c
next	c
time	c
you	c
will	c
do	i
a	c
better	c
show	c
than	c
the	c
last	c
one	c
.	c

But	c
it	c
has	c
advantatges	i
as	c
disadvantatges	i
.	c

On	c
the	c
positive	c
side	c
,	c
if	c
I	c
am	c
bored	c
,	c
the	c
first	c
thing	c
that	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
do	c
is	c
watching	i
television	c
or	c
listening	i
to	c
music	c
.	c

Or	i
if	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
go	c
shopping	c
or	c
to	c
another	c
city	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
necessary	c
to	c
use	c
the	c
car	c
or	c
the	i
public	c
transport	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
the	c
enviroment	i
is	c
polluted	c
because	c
of	c
technology	c
,	c
although	c
is	i
our	c
fault	c
.	c

Because	c
there	c
were	c
other	c
actors	c
which	i
played	c
too	i
badly	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
understand	c
why	c
you	c
changed	c
them	c
.	c

I	c
hoped	c
to	c
see	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
as	c
was	c
presented	i
in	c
an	c
advertisement	c
.	c

Any	i
kinds	i
of	i
tickets	c
were	c
original	i
prase	i
.	c

I	c
had	c
the	i
very	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
so	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
for	c
return	i
my	c
money	c
.	i

I	c
got	c
the	c
ticket	c
for	c
£	c
20	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
hearing	i
to	i
looking	i
fermards	i
from	c
you	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

Ilya	c
V	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

I	c
knew	c
that	c
but	c
I	c
needed	c
someone	c
who	c
could	c
understent	i
and	c
support	c
me	c
at	c
that	c
moment	c
.	c

I	c
understand	i
who	c
told	i
my	c
secret	c
to	c
everyone	c
.	c

They	c
stopped	c
me	c
to	i
do	i
the	c
operetion	i
.	c

Then	i
I	i
was	i
15	i
years	i
old	i
.	c

I	c
still	c
go	c
to	c
school	c
and	c
I	c
have	i
plan	c
go	i
to	i
a	i
college	c
on	i
next	c
year	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
tell	c
to	i
everyone	c
,	i
do	c
n't	c
be	c
naive	c
when	c
you	c
share	c
with	i
sameone	i
your	i
big	i
secret	i
or	i
promlem	i
.	c

First	c
tell	c
to	i
your	c
parents	c
.	c

Ofcoure	i
secrets	c
can	c
be	c
different	c
...	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

I	c
have	c
been	c
swimming	c
from	i
my	i
five	i
years	c
of	c
age	c
until	i
1993	c
as	i
a	c
member	c
of	c
school	i
team	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
also	c
good	c
at	c
playing	c
tennis	c

Is	c
everything	c
free	c
?	c

If	c
you	c
reply	i
my	i
letter	c
until	i
28th	i
of	c
June	c
I	i
'll	i
be	c
pleased	i
with	i
it	i
because	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
give	c
information	c
about	c
my	c
holiday	c
dates	c
to	c
my	c
company	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Everybody	c
likes	c
from	i
a	c
child	c
to	c
an	c
old	c
lady	c
in	c
sixties	i
but	i
it	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

When	c
you	c
get	c
home	c
tired	c
after	c
spending	c
all	c
your	c
morning	c
and	c
afternoon	c
at	i
shopping	c
you	i
'll	i
want	i
to	c
go	c
to	c
bed	c
because	c
you	c
were	i
looking	i
for	i
only	i
a	i
suit	i
during	i
all	i
day	i
and	c
you	c
could	c
n't	c
find	c
the	c
perfect	c
one	c
.	c

We	c
have	c
few	i
possibilities	c
.	c

We	c
can	c
look	c
up	i
a	c
magazine	c
or	c
a	c
booklet	i
which	c
deliver	i
with	c
newspaper	i
weekly	c
.	c

We	c
can	c
order	c
a	c
free	c
book	i
from	c
big	c
shops	c
or	c
companies	c
monthly	c
.	c

The	c
easiest	c
and	c
latest	c
way	c
is	c
the	i
internet	c
shops	i
recently	c
so	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
need	c
to	c
see	c
long-face	i
staffs	i
in	c
the	c
shops	c
.	c

I	c
will	c
be	c
leaving	c
university	c
in	c
a	c
few	c
month	i
's	i
time	c
but	c
is	i
in	c
my	c
plans	c
to	c
continue	c
my	c
studied	i
at	c
another	c
University	i
trying	i
to	c
do	c
a	c
master	i
of	i
two	i
years	i

I	c
am	c
a	c
good	c
swimmer	c
and	c
also	c
well	i
at	c
golf	c
(	c
handicap	c
twelve	c
)	c
I	i
took	c
a	c
certificate	c
as	i
Teachear	i
in	c
both	c
of	c
them	c
six	c
years	c
ago	c
before	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
"	c
CROARA	c
GOLF	c
"	c
in	c
Milan	c
where	c
I	c
organised	c
evening	i
's	c
entertainment	c
for	c
customers	i

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
reading	i
from	c
you	c

First	c
of	c
all	c

I	c
belive	i
that	c
if	c
someone	c
has	c
time	c

go	c
to	c
the	c

Dear	c
Misses	i
RYAN	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
inquire	c
whether	c
there	i
is	c
possible	c
to	c
have	c
more	c
details	c
about	c
travel	c
and	c
to	c
give	c
my	c
preferences	c
about	i
travel	c
.	c

Moreover	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
being	i
accommodate	i
in	c
log	i
cabins	i
because	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
put	c
up	c
with	c
mosquitos	c
and	c
other	c
insects	c
which	c
risk	i
coming	i
into	c
tents	c
.	c

On	i
the	i
other	i
hand	i
,	i
I	c
would	c
obtain	i
some	c
details	c
about	c
the	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
that	c
I	c
should	c
carry	i
with	c
me	c
and	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
to	c
take	c

You	i
do	i
n't	i
hesitate	c
to	c
contact	c
me	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
have	c
further	c
information	c

Dear	c
readers	c

As	c
you	c
have	i
already	i
know	i
,	c
your	c
English	c
class	c
is	c
going	c
to	c
make	c
a	c
short	c
video	c
about	c
daily	c
life	c
at	c
your	c
school	c
,	i
that	i
's	i
why	c
I	c
'm	c
writing	c
a	c
report	c
suggesting	c
which	c
,	i
lessons	c
and	c
other	c
activities	c
,	i
should	c
be	c
filmed	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
he	i
seems	c
obvious	c
that	c
we	c
should	c
,	c
at	c
least	c
once	c
,	c
film	c
a	c
lesson	c
with	c
our	c
English	c
teacher	c
who	c
have	i
had	i
the	c
idea	c
to	c
make	c
this	c
short	c
video	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
please	i
to	c
receive	c
you	i
letter	c

and	c
read	c
all	c
the	c
question	i
you	c
ask	i
me	c
,	i
now	i
,	c
I	c
answer	i
the	i
question	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
travel	i
in	c
July	c
,	c
because	c
at	i
that	i
moment	i
,	i
is	i
stay	i
my	i
summer	i
holiday	i
,	c
so	c
I	c
had	i
more	c
freedom	i
time	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
live	i
in	c
tents	c
more	c
than	c
log	c
cabin	i
,	c
because	c
when	c
we	c
live	i
in	c
a	c
tent	c
,	i
usually	i
we	i
are	i
in	c
the	c
countryside	c
.	c

Please	c

From	c

What	c
do	c
you	c
think	c
about	c
shopping	c
?	c

Very	i
Fun	i
,	i
very	i
happy	i
,	i
if	i
go	i
with	i
your	i
girl	i
friend	i
will	i
feel	i
romatic	i
,	i
you	i
should	i
think	i
something	i
like	i
this	i
,	c
but	c
do	c
you	c
know	c
is	i
not	c
always	c
like	c
this	c
.	i

When	c
you	c
go	c
to	i
shopping	c
with	c
your	c
girl	i
friend	i
,	c
she	c
want	i
to	c
watch	i
every	c
clothes	i
in	c
the	c
shopping	c
centre	c
,	c
but	c
you	c
are	c
not	c
interesting	i
of	i
that	c
,	i
romatic	i
,	c
no	c
!	c

In	c
this	c
unconfortable	i
situation	c
I	c
am	c
writting	i
to	c
tell	c
you	c
about	c
some	c
irratable	i
problems	c
.	c

I	c
went	c
today	c
to	c
see	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
disappointed	c
with	c
the	c
organisation	c
of	c
your	c
theatre	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
when	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
buy	c
my	c
tickets	c
I	c
discovered	c
that	c
the	c
advertisement	c
was	c
saying	c
false	c
things	c
because	c
there	c
was	c
n't	c
any	c
discount	c
available	c
,	c
but	c
in	i
anyway	i
I	i
bought	i
the	i
ticket	i
.	c

Closing	i
this	i
facts	i
,	c
when	c
the	c
musical	c
finished	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
,	i
in	i
the	i
fact	i
of	i
the	i
wainting	i
for	c
the	c
start	c
of	c
the	c
musical	c
and	c
dissapointed	i
with	c
this	c
version	c
of	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
,	i
every	i
body	i
went	c
to	c
the	c
restaurant	c
wich	i
is	i
closed	c
without	c
any	c
explanation	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
dissapointed	i
with	c
this	c
evening	c
and	c
with	c
the	i
desorganized	i
way	c
of	c
deal	i
with	c
problems	c
so	c
I	c
am	c
asking	c
my	i
money	c
back	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

They	c
always	c
done	i
thing	i
together	c
,	c
and	c
they	c
were	c
the	c
most	c
popular	c
boys	c
in	c
school	c
,	i
both	i
were	c
very	c
hanson	i
,	c
played	c
football	c
they	i
were	c
the	i
example	c
for	c
everybody	c
.	c

Before	i
one	i
day	c
,	i
when	c
Pat	c
discovered	c
that	c
his	c
brother	c
was	c
gay	c
,	i
after	i
this	i
their	c
relationship	c
has	i
change	i
.	c

Pat	c
was	c
very	c
frightened	c
with	i
this	c
situation	c
.	c

Pat	c
and	c
Ted	c
,	i
had	i
always	i
competition	c
,	c
and	c
Ted	c
used	c
to	c
be	c
the	c
best	c
,	i
he	i
never	i
had	i
failed	c
and	c
people	c
in	c
general	c
constums	i
to	i
like	i
more	i
Ted	i
,	i
I	c
do	c
n't	c
now	i
why	c
.	c

This	c
secret	c
was	c
an	c
opportunity	c
for	c
Pat	c
be	i
the	c
best	c
without	c
competition	i
but	c
it	c
is	i
a	c
secret	c
who	i
involved	c
his	c
best	c
friend	i
sexuality	c
,	c
and	c
if	c
Ted	c
was	i
a	c
normal	c
person	c
it	c
will	i
be	i
fine	c
but	c
he	c
was	c
the	i
example	c
for	c
all	c
school	i
.	c

Unable	c
to	c
keep	c
a	c
secret	c
he	c
told	c
for	i
everyone	c
,	c
ended	c
his	c
friendship	c
with	c
Ted	c
,	i
now	i
Ted	c
is	c
rejective	i
for	i
everyone	c
,	c
no	c
one	c
talks	c
to	c
him	c
and	c
Pat	c
is	c
the	c
example	c
,	c
but	c
without	c
his	c
best	c
friend	c
and	c
his	c
honestity	i
.	c

I	c
prefer	i
be	i
nothing	c
than	c
bun	i
like	c
Pat	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
pleased	c
with	c
the	c
prize	c
that	c
I	c
won	i
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
more	c
information	c
about	c
it	i
,	c
because	c
I	c
would	c
really	c
really	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
California	c
,	i
I	c
have	c
always	c
wanted	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
California	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
'm	c
very	c
ill	c
at	c
the	c
moment	c
and	c
I	c
need	c
about	c
a	c
week	c
to	c
get	c
better	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
within	c
the	c
next	c
few	c
weeks	c
if	c
is	i
possible	c
(	c
July	c
2000	c
)	c
.	c

May	c
I	c
ask	c
you	c
to	c
bring	i
me	c
some	c
more	c
information	c
about	c
the	c
question	i
that	c
I	c
have	c
asked	c
you	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
about	i
your	c
letter	c

The	c
other	c
lesson	c
that	c
I	c
think	c
is	c
very	c
important	c
is	c
physics	c
because	i
of	i
the	c
same	c
reason	c
as	i
maths	i
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
geography	c
is	c
important	c
as	c
well	c
because	c
we	c
must	i
all	c
know	c
WHERE	c
we	c
live	c
,	c
what	c
are	i
the	i
problems	i
that	c
we	c
have	c
in	c
this	c
world	c
,	c
what	c
problem	c
does	i
every	c
different	c
country	c
have	i
and	c
where	c
does	i
the	c
petroleum	c
come	i
from	c
and	c
what	c
are	i
the	i
advantages	i
and	i
disadvantages	i
for	i
it	i
and	c
the	i
gold	c
as	c
well	c
,	i
there	i
are	c
loads	c
of	c
thinks	i
about	c
geography	c
that	c
we	c
MUST	i
KNOW	i
.	c

You	c
can	c
put	c
a	i
few	c
activities	c
(	c
sports	c
)	c
like	c
basketball	c
,	c
football	c
,	c
tennis	i
,	c
but	c
only	c
those	c
because	c
their	i
are	c
very	c
popular	c
and	c
people	c
will	c
have	i
interest	i
on	i
them	c
.	c

My	c
advise	i
for	c
you	c
is	c
:	c
"	c
Do	c
not	c
put	c
to	i
much	i
subjects	c
,	i
just	i

Dear	c
manager	c
,	c

At	i
first	i
,	c
the	c
actor	c
was	c
not	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
there	i
was	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
,	c
who	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
advertisement	c
of	i
the	c
show	c
was	i
written	c
that	c
the	c
musical	c
will	i
be	i
start	c
at	c
19:30	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
.	c

After	c
the	c
musical	i
show	c
I	c
want	i
to	c
spend	c
some	c
time	c
in	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
open	c
,	c
because	c
all	c
of	c
your	c
cooks	c
and	c
waiters	c
are	c
in	i
holidays	i
.	c

I	i
've	i
payed	i
£	c
160	c
for	c
eight	c
people	c
and	c
there	c
was	i
no	c
discounts	c
available	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
50	c
%	c
(	c
£	c
80	c
)	c
are	i
enough	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
give	i
no	i
money	c
back	c
,	c
I	c
will	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
newspaper	c

The	c
new	c
way	c
is	c
very	c
easy	c

faster	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
glad	c
to	c
hear	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
.	c

Here	c
are	i
some	c
further	c
information	c
you	c
need	c
from	c
me	c
:	c

It	c
is	c
more	i
secure	i
and	c
there	c
is	c
no	c
problem	c
if	c
it	c
rains	c
.	c

As	c
for	c
the	c
two	c
activities	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
enjoy	c
climbing	c
and	c
playing	c
tennis	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
watch	c
every	c
tournament	c
on	c
television	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
if	c
I	c
need	c
special	i
clothes	c
,	c
extra	c
money	c
or	c
any	c
other	c
things	c
.	c

Could	c
you	c
please	c
send	c
me	c
more	c
details	c
about	c
that	c
...	i

They	c
are	c
all	c
excited	c
when	c
thinking	c
about	c
the	c
party	c
they	c
have	c
been	c
invited	c
to	c
.	c

This	i
is	c
very	c
nice	c
when	c
you	c
can	c
do	c
your	c
shopping	c
like	c
that	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
when	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
buy	c
what	c
is	c
necessary	c
for	c
you	c
:	c
bread	c
,	c
butter	c
,	c
milk	c
etc	c
...	c

You	c
are	c
among	c
thousands	c
of	c
people	c
,	c
but	c
at	i
the	c
same	c
time	c
,	c
you	c
are	c
alone	c
.	c

Besides	c
,	c
when	c
you	c
want	c
to	c
pay	c
for	c
the	c
things	c
you	c
have	c
taken	i
,	c
you	c
can	c
believe	c
that	c
the	c
ladies	c
behind	c
the	c
cashdesks	i
are	c
unable	c
to	c
smile	c
.	c

After	c
that	c
,	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
carry	c
your	c
bag	c
(	c
of	c
course	c
far	c
too	c
heavy	c
for	c
you	c
)	c
to	c
your	c
car	c
.	c

When	c
you	c
are	c
at	c
home	c
,	c
there	c
is	c
no	c
reward	c
except	c
that	c
your	c
husband	c
or	c
your	c
children	c
notice	c
that	c

Dear	c

Lot	i
of	c
things	c
that	c
you	c
have	i
written	i
at	i

not	c

the	c
discount	c
that	c
we	c

to	c

I	c
am	c
also	c
wondering	c
why	c
you	c
told	c
us	c
to	c
visit	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
.	i

Everyone	i
after	i
the	i
show	i
run	i
to	c
take	i
a	c
good	c
seat	c
at	i
the	c
restaurant	c
but	c
everyone	c
disappointed	i
when	c
they	c
see	i
the	c
sight	i
which	c
said	c

was	c
Saturday	c

I	c

a	c

secret	c
was	c
about	c
our	c
friend	c
Maria	c
who	c
was	c
very	c
kind	c
with	i
everyone	c
I	i
told	c
her	c
that	c
I	c
have	i
heard	i
that	c
Maria	c
had	c
concern	i
.	c

But	c
now	c
we	c
are	c
friends	c
again	c
but	c
I	c
will	c
never	c
say	i
to	i
her	c
a	c
secret	c
in	i
my	c
whole	c
life	c
.	c

My	c
name	c
is	c
Agripina	c
T.	c
I	c
just	c
recive	i
your	c
letter	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
answer	c
and	c
ask	c
some	c
questions	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
live	i
in	c
log	c
cabins	c
because	c
I	c
think	c
they	c
are	c
more	c
comfortable	c
than	c
tents	c
.	c

Before	i
I	c
was	c
in	c
a	c
basketball	c
team	c
and	c
I	c
enjoyded	i
a	i
lot	c
.	c

Also	c
I	c
like	c
singing	c
.	c

I	c
like	c
this	c
kind	c
of	c
activity	c
.	c

There	c
is	c
something	c
else	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Agripina	c
Tymoshenko	c

I	c
suggest	c
to	i
film	i
our	c
English	c
lessons	c
and	c
Math	i
lessons	c
.	c

From	c
activities	i
I	c
suggest	c
to	i
film	i
sport	i
lessons	c
.	i

At	c
some	c
lessons	c
students	c
are	c
always	c
work	i
,	c
but	c
us	i
we	c
work	c
,	c
joke	i
,	c
discuss	c
many	c
topics	c
,	c
tell	c
some	c
stories	c
about	c
our	c
life	c
.	c

Students	c
think	c
that	c
we	c
do	c
n't	c
do	c
anything	c
and	c
we	c
do	c
n't	c
learn	c
anything	c
spessial	i
.	c

It	c
's	c
not	c
true	c
.	c

We	c
practice	i
our	c
English	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
we	c
have	c
to	c
film	c
our	c
English	c
lessons	c
,	c
so	c
others	c
can	c
see	c
that	c
to	c
study	c
this	c
way	c
is	c
better	c
than	c
to	c
study	c
the	c
way	c
how	i
they	c
do	c
.	c

Many	c
people	c
do	c
n't	c
like	c
Math	i
because	c
they	c
think	c
that	c
it	c
's	c
boreing	i
subject	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	i
's	i
all	c
depends	c
of	i
teacher	i
.	c

Our	c
Math	i
.	i

We	c
do	i
many	c
competitions	c
with	c
other	c
schools	c
,	c
and	c
we	c
always	c
have	c
fun	c
.	c

We	c
try	c
to	c
play	c
on	i
many	c
instruments	c
,	c
sing	i
even	c
if	c
we	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
how	c
.	c

I	c
write	c
you	c
this	c
letter	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
your	c
musical	c
show	c
.	c

I	c
went	c
to	c
your	c
show	c
to	c
see	c
Mr.	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
who	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
play	c
the	c
main	c
character	c
,	c
but	c
he	c
did	c
n't	c
appeared	i
.	c

He	c
had	c
been	c
replaced	c
by	c
a	c
really	c
bad	c
actor	c
,	c
whom	i
I	c
do	c
n't	c
even	c
know	c
the	c
name	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
disappoint	i
of	i
that	c
change	c
,	c
because	c
Mr.	c
Brook	c
is	c
one	c
of	c
my	c
favourite	c
actor	i
.	c

My	c
wife	c
and	c
I	c
had	c
decided	c
to	c
eat	c
at	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
play	c
.	c

Waiting	c

The	c
developpement	i
of	c
portable	c
communication	c
systems	c
,	c
such	c
as	c
mobile	c
phones	c
has	i
greatly	c
changed	c
our	c
way	c
of	c
life	c
.	c

Precision	c
industry	c
has	c
changed	c
my	c
life	c
a	c
lot	c
too	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
we	c
live	c
easier	c
now	c
(	c
thanks	c
to	c
modern	c
medicine	c
)	c
and	c
that	c
our	c
lives	c
will	c
get	c
easier	c
with	c
the	i
time	c
.	c

I	c
received	c
your	c
letter	c
this	c
morning	c
.	c

You	i
can	i
find	i
futher	i
information	i
from	i
me	i
about	i
Camp	i
California	i
in	i
the	i
USA	i
.	c

Lastly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
should	c
bring	c
with	c
me	c
and	i
could	c
you	c
give	c
me	c
clue	i
about	c
what	c
I	c
must	c
bring	c
as	i
a	i
clothes	c
and	c
what	c
I	c
do	c
not	c
need	c
it	i
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Shopping	c
is	c
Not	c
Enjoy	i
Anymore	c

They	c
are	c
a	c
bit	c
far	c
from	c
town	c
but	c
they	c
have	c
huge	c
car	i
park	i
.	c

Also	c
they	c
give	i
lots	c
of	c
sale	i
for	i
everything	c
even	i
you	i
can	i
join	c
their	c
club	i
for	c
extra	c
discount	c
.	c

But	c
when	c
we	c
thing	i
properly	i
shopping	i
is	c
not	c
enjoyable	c
for	i
example	c
if	i
you	c
forget	c
something	c
that	c
need	i
for	c
salat	i
.	c

At	i
it	i
shows	c
shopping	i
is	i
become	c
our	i
dislikes	c
,	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
huge	c
supermarkets	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
recently	c
received	c
a	c
letter	c
saying	c
I	c
am	c
a	i
first-prize	c
winner	c
for	i
your	c
competition	c
.	c

I	i
was	c
wonderful	c
news	c
and	c
as	c
you	c
have	c
requested	c
,	c
here	c
is	c
some	c
further	c
information	c
and	c
details	c
.	c

The	c
two	c
activities	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
do	c
are	c
Photography	c
and	c
Sailing	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
all	c
new	c
for	c
me	c
as	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
been	c
to	c
the	c
USA	c
before	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
time	c
and	c
your	c
kind	c
effort	i
.	c

Yours	c
Sincerely	c

Shopping	c
is	c
thought	c
of	c
as	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

There	c
are	i
more	c
than	c
one	c
kind	c
of	c
shopping	c
though	c
and	c
one	c
particular	c
kind	c
is	c
window-shopping	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
say	c
window	c
shopping	c
is	c
the	c
reason	c
why	c
I	c
have	c
no	c
money	c
now	c
.	c

Sometime	c
last	c
month	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
just	c
the	c
same	c
as	c
I	c
am	c
now	c
,	c
with	c
no	c
money	c
.	c

My	c
friend	c
wanted	c
to	c
meet	c
up	c
with	c
me	c
so	c
we	c
made	c
plans	c
to	c
meet	c
up	c
at	i
a	c
high	c
street	c
to	c
go	c
shopping	c
.	c

For	c
me	c
,	c
that	c
was	i
window-shopping	i
.	c

When	c
we	c
went	c
into	c
the	c
first	c
shop	c
,	c
I	c
caught	c
sight	c
of	c
a	c
long	c
black	c
dress	c
.	c

As	c
I	c
had	c
nothing	c
better	c
to	c
do	c
,	c
I	c
tried	c
it	c
on	c
.	c

I	c
fell	c
in	c
love	c
with	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
went	c
back	c
everyday	i
just	c
to	c
eye	c
that	c
dress	c
because	c
I	c
just	c
could	c
n't	c
get	c
over	c
the	c
fact	c
that	c
I	c
had	c
no	c
money	c
.	c

I	c
went	i
back	c
to	c
where	c
I	c
was	c
before	c
-	c
with	c
no	c
money	c
(	c
and	c
a	c
black	c
dress	c
)	c
all	c
over	c
again	c
.	c

Dear	c
Manager	c
,	c

But	c
at	i
big	i
suprise	i
I	i
saw	c
that	c
the	i
actor	i
was	i
different	i
and	i
I	c
was	c
very	c
disappointed	c
.	c

I	c
prefered	i
to	c
come	i
at	c
19:30	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
better	c
at	c
night	c
and	c
it	c
would	c
n't	c
finish	c
late	c
,	c
but	c
the	c
theatre	i
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
and	c
we	c
got	c
bored	c
waiting	c
to	i
start	c
.	c

Another	c
reason	c
why	c
I	c
was	c
disappointed	c
was	c
that	c
you	c
said	c
there	c
would	c
be	c
discount	i
available	c
but	c
there	c
was	c
n't	c
.	c

At	i
last	i
I	i
was	c
waiting	i
to	c
visit	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
a	c
machine	c
was	c
broken	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
can	c
see	c
there	i
were	c
many	c
problems	c
with	c
the	c
theatre	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
for	c
some	c
money	c
back	c
as	c
an	i
alternative	i

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

The	c
next	c
morning	c
at	c
school	c
everybody	c
was	c
looking	c
at	c
me	c
with	i
a	c
strange	c
way	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
ungry	i
with	c
her	c
,	i
I	c
did	c
n't	c
know	c
what	c
to	c
do	c
I	i
was	c
afraid	c
that	c
I	c
would	i
have	i
lost	c
all	c
my	c
friends	c
.	c

I	c
said	i
she	i
looked	c
as	c
if	c
she	c
did	c
n't	c
want	c
to	c
talk	c
to	c
me	c
.	c

Everybody	c
knew	c
about	c
my	c
party	c
and	c
I	c
had	c
invited	c
only	c
ten	c
persons	i
.	c

I	c
was	c
confused	c
.	c

I	c
wondered	c
why	c
I	c
made	c
the	c
mistake	c
to	i
invite	i
Pat	c
.	c

I	c
guess	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
know	c
that	c
she	c
would	c
have	c
said	i
it	i
.	c

After	c
a	i
big	i
confusion	c
I	i
decided	c
not	c
to	c
make	i
a	c
party	c
for	c
my	c
birthday	c
so	c
I	c
could	c
had	i
all	c
my	c
friends	c
back	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
much	c
more	c
important	c
to	c
me	c
to	c
get	c
all	c
my	c
friends	c
back	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
this	c
letter	c
to	c
complain	c
how	i
terrible	c
the	c
show	c
performed	c
in	c
your	c
theatre	c
was	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
interested	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
about	i
the	c
musical	c
show	c
so	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
to	c
see	c
it	c
two	c
weeks	c
ago	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
cannot	c
help	c
saying	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
really	c
nightmare	i
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
which	c
was	c
45	c
minutes	c
later	c
than	c
on	c
time	c
and	c
there	c
was	c
no	c
discount	c
for	c
the	c
ticket	c
,	c
which	c
is	c
different	c
from	c
the	c
advertisement	c
.	c

Thirdly	c
,	c
the	c
only	c
one	i
restaurant	c
in	c
your	c
theatre	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
of	c
renovating	i
it	i
.	c

As	c
a	c
result	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
totally	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
during	c
my	c
holiday	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
I	c
hope	c
that	c
you	i
should	i
have	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

I	c
will	c
looking	i
forward	c
to	c
your	c
reply	c
.	c

But	c
how	c
it	i
affect	c
to	i
my	c
daily	c
life	c
?	c

I	c
get	c
up	c
in	c
the	c
morning	c
with	c
the	c
soft	c
sound	c
of	c
radio	i
program	i
not	i
the	c
sound	c
of	c
alarm	i
clock	c
and	c
eat	c
my	c
breakfast	c
watching	c
TV	c
news	c
.	c

In	i
the	c
bus	c
or	c
even	c
in	i
the	c
tube	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
talk	c
with	c
a	c
friend	c
with	i
a	c
mobile	c
phone	c
when	c
I	c
feel	c
boaring	i
.	c

Sometimes	c
I	c
even	c
do	i
some	c
games	c
with	i
it	c
.	c

Without	c
it	c
,	c
it	c
would	c
take	c
more	c
than	c
one	c
week	c
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
modern	c
technology	c
affects	c
a	i
lot	i
to	i
my	i
daily	i
life	i
as	c
well	c
as	c
the	c
whole	c
society	c
.	c

To	c
Helen	c

this	c
is	c
the	c
only	c
time	c
I	c
can	c

September	c

For	c
accommodation	c

I	c
prefer	c

I	c

if	c
I	c
stay	c
in	c
log	c
cabins	c
and	c
it	c
's	c
a	c
lot	c

I	c
have	c
never	c

played	c

6	c
years	c

During	c
the	c

so	c
on	c

We	c
move	c

By	c
the	c
time	c
it	c
finished	c

I	c
was	c
exhausted	c

enjoyed	c
this	c
experience	c
as	c
you	c
can	c
meet	c
many	c
people	c
at	c
a	c
time	c
and	c
what	c
I	c
liked	c
most	c
was	c
that	c
you	c
can	c
see	c

listen	c
to	c
their	c
live	c

It	c
was	c
my	c
last	c
night	c
in	c
London	c
and	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
this	c
musical	i
show	c
.	c

I	c
showed	c
the	c
advertisement	c
to	c
him	c
and	c
he	c
said	c
it	c
was	c
wrong	c
and	c
I	c
paid	c
the	c
normal	c
price	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
been	c
waiting	c
half	c
an	c
hour	c
outside	c
the	c
theatre	c
and	i
finally	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
a	c
quarter	c
past	c
eight	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
angry	c
about	c
all	c
of	c
this	i
problems	c
but	c
I	c
was	c
disappointed	c
when	c
I	c
realised	c
the	c
advertisement	c
was	c
wrong	c
with	i
the	c
actor	c
's	c
name	c
.	c

Waiting	c
for	c
your	c
answer	c
.	c

Modern	c
technology	c
has	c
changed	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
and	c
I	c
'll	c
try	c
to	c
explain	c
it	i
.	c

The	c
subject	c
was	c
"	c
What	c
's	c
happening	c
in	c
Irak	c
?	c
"	c

I	c
started	c
my	c
research	c
in	c
the	c
town	c
's	c
library	c
and	c
all	c
the	c
information	c
I	c
collected	c
was	c
from	c
a	c
local	c
newspaper	c
.	c

After	c
two	c
hours	c
I	c
thought	c
that	c
all	c
of	c
this	c
information	c
was	c
writted	i
from	c
a	c
foreign	c
point	c
of	c
view	c
and	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
the	c
native	c
opinion	c
.	c

Do	c
you	c
want	c
to	c
organize	c
a	c
different	c
holiday	c
in	i
a	c
strange	c
place	c
?	c

I	c
ca	c
n't	c
imagine	c
my	c
parents	c
playing	c
in	c
the	c
street	c
without	i
watching	c
the	c
TV	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
see	c
at	c
your	c
theatre	c
in	c
London	c
two	c
weeks	c
ago	c
.	c

According	c
to	c
your	c
advertisement	c
,	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
was	c
involved	c
in	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
but	c
to	c
my	c
disappointment	c
there	c
was	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
.	c

To	c
make	c
things	c
worse	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
at	c
20.15	c
instead	c
of	c
19.30	c
.	c

Besides	i
,	c
there	c
was	c
a	c
problem	c
with	c
tickets	c
.	c

According	c
to	c
the	c
advertisement	c
,	c
discounts	c
were	c
available	c
,	c
but	c
in	c
reality	c
it	i
was	c
n't	c
so	c
!	c

Pat	c
was	c
my	c
classmate	c
and	c
I	c
should	c
add	c
,	i
that	c
he	c
was	c
one	c
of	c
my	c
best	c
friends	c
.	c

We	c
bought	c
a	c
beautiful	c
puppy	c
and	c
were	c
waiting	c
for	c
the	c
holiday	i
probably	c
even	c
more	c
impatiently	c
,	i
than	c
Susie	c
.	c

He	c
told	c
her	c
about	c
the	c
present	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
he	c
saw	c
her	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
sure	c
he	c
did	c
it	c
not	c
because	c
he	c
wanted	c
to	c
spoil	c
everything	c
,	c
but	c
because	c
he	c
was	c
so	c
happy	c
and	c
excited	c
,	i
that	c
he	c
could	c
n't	c
act	c
in	c
a	c
different	c
way	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

I	c
have	c
been	c
very	c
disappointed	c
by	c
the	c
quality	c
of	c
the	c
show	c
and	c
the	c
lies	c
in	c
your	c
advertisement	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
seeing	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
as	c
written	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
,	c
but	c
his	c
part	c
was	c
played	c
by	c
another	c
actor	c
,	c
without	c
information	i
or	c
excuse	i
from	i
the	c
direction	i
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
coud	i
n't	i
get	c
a	c
discount	c
with	c
my	c
student	c
card	c
and	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
45	c
minutes	c
later	i
.	c

In	c
addition	c
,	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
,	c
where	c
we	c
had	c
planned	c
to	c
eat	c
,	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
the	c
cook	c
was	c
ill	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

The	c
poor	c
boy	c
was	c
only	c
5	c
year	i
old	c
and	c
at	c
this	c
age	c
,	i
it	c
's	c
very	c
difficult	c
to	c
keep	c
your	c
mouth	c
shut	c
knowing	c
an	c
important	c
secret	c
.	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
in	c
July	c
after	c
taking	c
my	c
examination	c
at	c
the	i
college	c
in	i
the	c
end	c
of	c
June	c
.	c

So	c
it	c
is	c
impossible	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
go	c
before	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
quite	c
good	c
at	c
swimming	c
.	c

I	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
price	i
at	c
the	c
Regional	c
Championship	c
six	c
years	c
ago	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
think	c
I	c
'd	c
rather	c
do	c
other	c
activities	c
what	i
you	c
show	i
me	i
in	c
your	c
letter	c
like	i
tennis	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
been	c
playing	c
this	c
game	c
with	c
my	c
friends	c
and	c
I	c
like	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
be	c
please	i
if	c
you	c
give	i
me	c
some	c
more	c
information	c
about	c
the	c
accommodation	c
,	c
and	c
some	c
advices	i
about	c
the	c
cloth	i
(	c
shal	i
)	c
I	c
should	c
wear	c
and	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
should	c
take	c
with	c
me	c
.	c

Your	i
faithfully	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
,	i
even	i
no	i
healthy	c
for	c
your	c
pockets	c
.	c

Because	c
is	i
something	c
it	i
goes	c
with	c
their	c
culture	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
in	c
reply	c
to	c
your	c
letter	c
in	c
which	c
you	c
communicate	i
I	i
have	c
won	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competion	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
glad	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
.	c

Now	c
I	c
am	c
answering	c
your	c
questions	c
and	c
then	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
further	i
information	c
about	c
travel	c
and	c
accomodation	i
.	c

I	c
can	c
tell	c
you	c
I	c
am	c
only	c
free	c
in	c
July	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
an	i
accomodation	i
in	c
log	i
cabins	i
because	c
I	c
am	c
not	c
keen	c
on	c
tents	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
is	c
more	c
comfortable	c
than	c
a	c
tent	c
.	c

So	c
when	c
I	c
go	c
back	c
home	c
I	c
can	c
use	c
my	c
best	c
pictures	c
to	c
reproduce	c
them	c
as	c
a	c
painting	c
.	c

Would	c
you	c
give	c
me	c
some	c
information	c
about	c
clothes	i
to	c
wear	c
there	c
?	c

I	c
would	c
like	i
also	i
to	c
know	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
can	c
bring	c
.	c

There	c
is	c
somebody	c
who	c
says	c
that	c
'	c
Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
'	i
and	c
who	c
is	c
happy	c
only	c
when	c
can	i
go	c
shopping	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
run	c
from	c
one	c
shop	c
to	c
another	i
and	i
always	c
looking	c
at	c
the	i
watch	c
,	c
doing	i
shopping	c
is	c
a	c
terrible	c
activity	c
.	c

For	c
istance	i
,	c
it	c
is	c
funny	i
enter	i
a	c
clothes	c
shop	c
and	c
try	c
on	c
a	c
skirt	c
or	c
a	c
t-shirt	i
although	c
you	c
do	c
not	c
buy	c
anything	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
with	c
reference	c
to	c
your	c
letter	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
give	c
some	i
information	c
which	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
asked	c
.	i

It	i
is	c
the	c
best	c
time	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

As	c
far	c
as	c
accommodation	c
is	c
concern	i
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
I	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
tents	c
.	c

I	c
like	c
staying	c
in	c
tents	c
because	c
when	c
we	c
go	c
on	c
holiday	c
with	c
my	c
friends	c
,	c
we	c
always	c
stay	c
in	c
tents	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
am	c
used	c
to	c
staying	c
in	c
tents	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
also	c
been	c
asked	c
to	c
choose	c
some	c
activities	c

When	c
I	c
was	c
at	c

I	c
have	i

the	c

team	c
and	c
I	c
am	c

Finally	c
,	c
could	c
you	c

me	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
have	c
just	c
received	c
your	c
letter	c
informing	c
me	c
that	c
I	c
won	c
a	c
two	c
week	c
holiday	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
to	c
indicate	i
my	i
preferences	c
for	c
the	c
travel	c
and	c
the	c
accomodation	i
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
shopping	c
can	c
be	c
interesting	c
in	c
big	c
stores	c
,	c
where	c
you	c
can	c
find	c
everything	c
,	c
or	c
in	c
shops	c
which	c
sell	c
something	c
special	c
or	c
strange	c
.	c

In	c
this	c
case	c
,	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
long	c
queues	c
,	c
you	c
ca	c
n't	c
walk	c
without	c
being	c
pulled	c
or	c
pushed	c
,	c
and	c
you	c
often	c
have	c
to	c
spend	c
a	i
hour	c
to	i
buy	i
some	c
soap	c
or	c
a	c
packet	c
of	c
biscuits	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
the	c
reason	c
why	c
I	c
bought	c
the	c
ticket	c
was	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
who	c
is	c
my	c
favorite	i
star	c
,	c
and	c
was	c
going	c
to	c
play	i
for	i
the	c
show	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
as	i
your	i
advertisement	i
,	c
we	c
would	c
get	c
discount	i
price	c
for	c
the	c
ticket	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
available	c
.	c

Although	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
start	c
at	c
19=30	i
,	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
20=15	i
,	c
so	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
wait	c
for	c
an	c
hour	c
.	c

To	c
make	c
matters	c
worse	c
,	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
late	c
starting	i
,	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
had	c
already	c
closed	c
after	i
the	c
show	c
finished	c
.	c

I	c
wonder	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
give	c
me	c
a	c
refund	c
for	i
that	i
,	c
because	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
extremely	i
different	c
which	i
I	c
was	i
expected	i
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfuly	i

Our	c
daily	c
life	c
with	c
modern	c
technology	c

Science	c
and	c
technology	c
are	c
necessary	c
for	c
our	c
life	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
say	c
that	c
we	c
can	i
not	i
servive	i
without	c
them	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
if	c
we	c
rely	c
on	c
modern	c
technology	c
too	c
much	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
difficult	c
to	c
be	c
independent	c
,	c
otherwise	i
we	c
will	c
tend	c
to	i
not	i
consider	c
or	c
solve	c
a	c
problem	c
by	c
ourselves	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c

Last	c
week	c
I	c
attempted	i
the	c
musical	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
"	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
writting	i
in	c
order	c
to	c
complaint	i
about	c
things	c
that	c
really	c
disappointed	c
me	c
.	c

Thirdly	c
,	c
when	c
I	c
bought	c
the	c
tickets	c
,	c
I	c
asked	c
for	c
discounts	c
and	c
nobody	c
know	i
anything	c
about	c
them	c
,	c
so	c
it	c
is	c
false	c
there	i
are	c
discounts	c
available	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
waiting	c
for	c
your	c
answer	c

Hello	c

I	c
'm	c
Robert	c
and	c
I	c
'm	c
writting	i
for	i
the	i
article	c
about	c
clothes	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
.	c

What	c
will	c
change	c
in	i
clothes	c
,	i
will	c
be	c
the	i
comfortability	i
of	i
them	i
and	c
the	c
way	c
they	c
protect	c
us	c
and	c
our	c
body	i
from	c
temperature	c
and	c
physical	c
agressions	i
.	c

I	c
think	c
they	c
will	c
cold	i
us	c
in	c
the	c
summer	c
and	c
makes	i
us	c
hot	i
in	c
the	c
winter	c
.	c

Clothes	c
will	c
be	c
more	c
personalized	c
and	c
they	c
'll	c
make	c
us	c
feel	c
better	c
and	c
more	c
free	c

I	c
wish	i
I	c
win	c
the	c
trip	c

I	c

in	c
the	c
U.S.A	c
during	i

the	c

extraordinary	c
opportunity	c
in	c
July	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
better	c
for	c
me	c
because	c
in	c
August	c
I	c
will	c
have	c
to	c
be	c
ready	c
to	c
begin	c
preparing	c
the	c
exams	c
of	i
september	i
.	c

If	c
it	c
is	c
any	c
problem	c
let	c
me	c
know	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c
because	c
I	c
'll	c
try	c
to	c
sort	c
it	c
out	c
.	c

Another	c
point	c
is	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
already	c
chose	i
two	c
activities	c
that	i
you	i
asked	i
me	i
while	i
I	i
am	i
at	i
the	i
camp	i
and	c
are	i
basketball	c
and	c
golf	c
,	i
they	i
are	c
the	c
best	c
for	i
me	c
because	c
I	c
think	c
I	c
am	c
good	c
at	c
both	c
and	c
I	c
used	c
to	c
play	c
them	c
before	i
.	c

Finally	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
find	c
out	c
about	i
if	c
is	i
any	i
supermarket	c
near	c
the	c
camping	i
and	c
if	c
there	c
are	c
any	c
facilities	c
in	i
washing	c
my	c
clotches	i
into	i
the	c
camp	c

BUT	c
EVERY	c

CAN	c

THE	c
WAY	c
HOW	i
TO	c
DO	c
IT	c
.	c

IT	c
ABSOLUTELY	c
DEPENDS	c
ON	c
A	i
LIFE-STYLE	i
,	c
PERSONALITY	c
AND	c
NEEDS	c
.	c

I	c
want	c
to	c
know	c
if	c
it	c
is	c
avaliabile	i
during	i
that	c
time	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
I	c
'll	c
have	c
chance	i
to	c
draw	c
the	i
pictures	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
'll	c
show	c
my	i
friends	c
who	c
have	c
never	c
been	c
there	c
before	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
good	c
at	c
it	c
.	c

It	c
would	c
be	c
exciting	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Recently	c
we	c
have	i
a	c
class	c
discussion	c
about	c
shopping	c
.	c

All	c
of	c
the	c
students	c
agree	c
with	i
that	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

Women	c
always	c
enjoy	c
shopping	c
.	c

Futhermore	i
when	i
you	c
look	c
aroud	i
the	c
supermarket	c
,	c
you	c
ca	c
n't	c
easyly	i
find	c
the	c
goods	c
which	c
you	c
want	c
to	c
buy	c
.	c

Sometimes	c
you	c
get	c
lost	c
in	c
the	c
supermarket	c
.	c

Otherwise	i
men	i
always	i
do	i
n't	i
like	i
shopping	c
,	i
while	i
their	c
wives	c
are	c
doing	c
shopping	i
they	c
sit	c
in	c
the	c
car	c
or	c
read	c
newspaper	i
.	c

They	c
would	c
be	c
happy	c
if	c
there	c
are	i
sports	c
and	c
leisure	c
facilities	c
in	c
the	c
supermarket	c
.	c

They	i
'll	i
change	c
their	c
mind	c
.	c

Now	c
about	c
accomodation	i
.	c

If	c
it	c
is	c
possible	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
tent	i
.	c

As	c
I	c
am	c
young	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
be	c
a	c
romantic	c
person	c
and	c
to	c
be	c
closer	c
to	c
the	i
nature	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
the	c
best	c
way	c
to	c
understand	c
what	c
California	c
means	c
.	c

Also	c
I	c
like	c
swimming	c
and	c
I	c
've	c
got	c
two	c
year	i
experience	c
in	i
teaching	c
swimming	c
in	i
lesure	i
centre	c
.	c

Could	c
I	c
ask	c
you	c
some	c
questions	c
about	c
clothes	c
and	c
money	c
.	i

Shopping	c
is	c
part	c
of	c
my	c
life	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
everybody	c
in	c
my	c
family	c
will	c
open	c
their	c
mouths	c
and	c
wo	c
n't	c
just	c
ask	c
to	c
eat	c
,	c
they	c
will	c
ask	c
me	c
something	i
special	c
and	c
testy	i
.	c

To	c
be	c
honest	c
,	c
sometimes	c
I	c
like	c
shopping	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
an	c
opportunity	c
to	c
meet	c
different	c
people	c
(	c
even	c
if	c
they	c
are	c
pushing	c
you	c
)	c
,	c
to	c
understand	c
what	c
they	c
like	c
and	c
what	c
they	c
do	c
n't	c
,	c
because	c
even	c
some	c
kind	i
of	c
food	c
could	i
be	c
in	c
fashing	i
.	c

But	c
finally	i
,	c
without	c
telling	c
us	c
anything	c
,	c
there	c
was	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
your	c
famous	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

That	c
was	c
very	c
displeasured	i
because	c
I	c
had	c
planned	c
a	c
romantic	c
dinner	c
with	c
my	c
wife	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
had	c
told	c
me	c
your	c
restaurant	c
was	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
closed	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
have	c
made	c
a	c
reservation	c
anywhere	i
else	c
,	c
but	c
you	c
did	c
n't	c
.	c

And	c
finally	c
the	c
play	c
started	c
with	c
a	c
delay	c
of	c
forty-five	c
minutes	c
and	c
there	c
were	c
not	i
discounts	c
available	c
.	c

This	c
was	c
a	c
very	c
difficult	c
decission	i
but	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
take	c
it	c
because	c
of	c
my	c
personal	c
situation	c
,	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
shouting	c
and	c
fighting	c
will	i
all	c
my	c
family	c
.	c

Therefore	i
my	c
girlfriend	c
lived	c
alone	c
so	i
I	c
could	c
have	c
stayed	c
with	c
her	c
or	c
just	c
have	c
gone	c
on	c
travelling	c
around	c
the	c
world	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
thinking	c
a	c
lot	c
about	c
this	c
problem	c
and	c
how	c
to	c
solve	c
it	c
so	c
I	c
needed	c
someone	c
to	c
talk	c
to	c
and	c
Pat	c
had	c
always	c
been	c
my	c
best	c
friend	c
.	c

But	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
big	c
mistake	c
because	c
she	c
told	i
it	i
to	i
her	i
mother	i
and	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
how	c
but	c
now	c
my	c
mother	c
know	i
it	i
,	c
and	c
she	c
is	c
very	c
worried	c
about	c
me	c
and	c
my	c
future	c
.	c

And	c
my	c
father	c
thinks	c
a	c
year	c
travelling	c
and	c
living	c
by	c
myself	c
will	c
be	c
very	c
good	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
so	c
happy	c
and	c
exciting	i
to	c
receive	c
this	c
letter	c
about	c
I	i
've	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
.	c

The	c
dream	c
happens	i
to	c
me	c
now	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
go	c
back	c
to	c
my	c
country	c
in	c
Auguest	i
.	c

And	c
I	c
'm	c
sure	c
about	i
that	c
the	c
weather	c
in	c
July	c
will	c
be	c
lovely	c
!	c

I	c
think	c
living	i
in	c
tents	c
is	c
more	c
comfortable	c
for	c
sleeping	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
am	c
good	c
at	c
it	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
never	i
try	i
it	c
before	c
.	c

I	c
just	c
think	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
exciting	c
and	c
interesting	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

Also	c
I	c
got	i
two	c
questions	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
.	c

The	c
first	c
one	c
is	c
that	i
shall	i
I	c
take	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
money	c
or	c
just	c
a	c
little	c
?	c

I	c
hope	c
that	c
I	c
will	c
enjoy	c
my	c
journey	c
!	c

Yours	c
Sincerely	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c

More	c
and	c
more	c
people	c
like	c
shopping	c
now	c
.	c

You	c
can	c
see	c
so	c
many	c
people	c
walk	c
along	c
the	c
business	c
street	c
every	c
day	c
and	c
any	c
time	c
,	c
especially	c
in	c
Oxford	c
Street	c
.	c

Sometimes	c
shopping	c
can	c
relax	c
people	c
and	c
increase	c
people	c
's	c
working	c
express	i
.	c

Of	c
course	c
not	c
.	c

So	c
you	c
like	c
them	c
but	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
want	c
them	c
any	c
more	c
.	c

Also	c
for	i
example	c
.	i

You	c
become	c
unhappy	c
immediately	c
.	c

And	c
sometimes	c
for	i
example	c
,	c
you	c
just	c
bought	c
something	c
last	c
week	c
,	c
but	c
when	c
you	c
go	c
shopping	c
this	c
week	c
,	c
you	c
see	c
the	c
same	c
items	c
but	c
different	c
prices	c
,	c
maybe	c
from	c
£	c
50	c
down	c
to	c
£	c
20	c
,	c
and	c
then	c
you	c
'll	c
regret	c
wasting	c
money	c
,	c
although	c
you	c
like	c
it	c
very	c
much	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
were	i
rich	i
man	c
it	c
does	c
n't	c
mater	c
,	c
but	c
if	c
you	c
were	i
poor	i
man	c
,	c
you	c
will	c
be	c
sad	c
!	c

How	c
can	c
shopping	c
be	c
enjoyable	c
at	i
thoese	i
situation	c
!	c

I	c
have	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
I	c
'm	c
very	c
disappointed	c
with	c
what	c
I	c
saw	c
because	c
by	i
seing	i
your	c
advertisment	i
I	c
expected	c
more	c
That	i
show	c
was	c
entirely	c
different	c
to	c
what	c
it	c
says	c
on	i
the	c
advertisment	i
.	c

I	c
arrived	c
at	c
the	c
theatre	c
at	c
19:30	c
,	c
found	c
my	c
seat	c
and	c
waited	c
for	c
forty-five	c
minutes	c
,	c
with	c
two	c
hundred	c
other	c
people	c
for	i
the	c
show	c
to	c
start	c
.	c

When	c
it	c
finally	c
started	c
I	c
noticed	c
that	c
the	c
famous	c
actor	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
was	i
replaced	i
by	c
someone	c
who	c
was	c
not	c
as	c
good	c
as	c
him	c
.	c

Danny	c
Brook	c
was	c
the	c
reason	c
that	c
most	c
people	c
came	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

After	c
some	c
time	c
a	i
few	c
of	c
them	c
started	c
to	c
leave	c
the	c
theatre	c
.	c

Then	c
I	c
thougt	i
that	c
I	c
should	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
drink	c
or	c
eat	c
something	c
so	c
that	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
say	c
that	c
I	c
wasted	i
my	c
time	c
by	c
coming	c
here	c
.	c

I	c
became	c
furious	c
when	c
I	c
saw	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
there	c
were	c
n't	c
any	c
employees	c
to	c
work	i
.	i

So	c
,	c
I	c
went	c
home	c
as	c
fast	c
as	c
I	c
could	c
to	c
write	c
you	c
this	c
letter	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
care	c
what	c
you	c
will	i
do	i
about	c
the	c
theatre	c
but	c
I	c
want	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
because	c
this	c
was	c
n't	c
the	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
you	c
promised	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
.	c

first	i
it	c
was	c
used	c
only	c
by	c
the	c
military	c
or	c
by	c
scientists	c
but	c
the	i
last	c
twenty	c
years	c
modern	c
technology	c
is	i
found	c
in	c
any	c
house	c
,	c
rich	c
or	c
poor	c
and	i
it	c
helps	c
people	c
do	c
hard	c
work	c
.	c

Most	c
houses	c
have	c
many	c
electric	c
devices	c
like	c
microwave	i
machine	i
,	c
an	c
oven	c
a	i
mixer	c
,	c
a	c
dish	i
washer	i
and	c
many	c
other	c
things	c
which	c
can	c
do	c
a	c
job	c
by	i
the	c
press	c
of	c
a	c
button	c
.	c

The	i
last	c
ten	c
year	i
computers	c
had	i
entered	i
almost	c
every	c
house	c
,	c
especially	c
in	c
rich	c
countrys	i
.	c

Competers	i
entirely	i
changed	i
people	i
lives	c
.	c

Children	c
can	c
play	c
games	c
on	c
it	i
or	c
watch	c
a	c
film	c
.	c

You	c
can	c
listen	c
to	c
music	c
and	c
generally	c
use	c
it	c
for	c
fun	c
but	c
the	c
primary	c
reason	c
that	c
computer	i
were	c
invented	c
was	c
for	c
communication	c
.	c

There	c
are	c
hundrets	i
of	c
prograns	i
which	c
help	c
you	c
communicate	c
with	c
your	c
cousin	c
in	c
Australia	c
or	c
with	c
a	c
complete	c
stranger	c
which	i
you	c
wanna	i
meet	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
very	c
disappointing	c
when	c
I	c
realised	c
he	c
was	c
n't	c
in	i
the	c
scene	i
.	c

During	c
this	c
time	c
,	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
drink	c
in	c
the	c
restaurant	c
but	c
,	c
as	c
well	c
as	c
being	c
closed	c
,	c
there	c
was	c
no	i
nobody	c
from	c
the	c
staff	c
that	c
could	c
help	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
n't	c
believe	c
it	c
!	c

I	c
would	c
never	c
have	c
imagined	c
this	c
could	c
happen	c
in	c
such	c
a	c
well-known	c
theatre	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
you	c
talk	c
about	c
discounts	c
in	c
your	c
leaflets	c
and	c
they	i
were	c
no	i
available	c
,	c
so	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
an	c
expensive	c
evening	c
!	c

Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
she	c
was	c
a	c
close	c
friend	c
and	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
accuse	c
her	c
of	c
nothing	i
else	c
.	c

I	c
wo	c
n't	c
never	i
forget	c
the	c
day	c
the	c
doctor	c
told	c
me	c
and	c
my	c
Mum	c
the	c
thruth	i
of	i
my	c
strange	c
disease	c
.	c

He	c
just	c
said	c
there	c
were	c
n't	c
resources	c
to	c
face	i
it	c
at	c
that	c
moment	c
but	c
...	c

I	c
bursted	i
into	c
teas	i
as	c
well	i
as	i
my	c
Mother	c
.	c

It	c
seemed	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
something	c
lovely	c
step	i
by	c
step	c
.	c

I	c
got	i
conscious	c
of	c
my	c
problem	c
and	c
despite	c
being	c
a	c
personal	c
matter	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
tell	i
it	i
to	i
Pat	i
.	c

I	c
still	c
remember	c
her	c
words	c
:	c
"	c
Do	c
n't	c
worry	c
about	c
anything	c
.	c

My	c
lips	c
are	c
sealed	c
"	c
.	c

I	c
do	i
really	i
trusted	i
her	c
when	c
three	c
days	c
after	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
school	c
and	c
I	c
could	c
appreciate	i
I	c
was	c
catching	i
the	i
eyes	i
of	c
everybody	c
.	c

My	c
best	c
friend	c
had	c
let	c
me	c
down	c
.	c

From	c
that	c
moment	c
,	c
I	c
denied	i
being	i
with	c
anyone	c
until	c
I	c
met	c
Cold	c
,	c
a	c
sensitive	c
dog	c
,	c
the	c
one	c
who	c
would	c
keep	c
my	c
secrets	c
forever	i
and	c
would	c
be	c
near	c
me	c
until	c
the	c
end	c
.	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
,	c

Thanks	i
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
your	c
recent	c
letter	c
.	c

As	c
your	i
questions	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
free	c
to	c
travel	c
only	c
on	i
July	c
because	c
I	c
will	c
having	i
my	c
holiday	c
after	c
finished	i
the	c
exams	c
.	c

I	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
log	i
cabin	c
rather	c
than	c
in	c
tent	i
because	c
I	c
am	c
not	c
used	c
to	c
with	i
narrow	c
space	i
and	c
feel	c
more	c
comfortable	c
with	c
a	c
place	c
like	c
bedroom	i
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
please	c
could	c
you	c
give	c
me	c
an	c
idea	c
what	c
sort	c
of	c
clothes	c
to	c
bring	c
?	c
and	i
how	c
much	c
would	i
be	i
spend	i
there	c
.	i

Sorry	c
for	i
I	c
have	c
n't	c
written	c
to	c
you	c
for	c
such	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
've	c
got	c
a	c
good	c
excute	i
!	c

You	c
might	c
understand	c
how	c
excited	c
I	c
was	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
they	c
are	c
so	c
hospitality	i
and	c
warm	c
with	c
people	c
around	c
them	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
're	c
well	c
and	c
enjoyed	c
with	i
CD	c
and	c
do	c
n't	c
forget	c
to	c
write	c
back	c
all	c
about	c
your	c
news	c
during	i
my	i
summer	c
holiday	c
job	c
.	c

13	c
of	c
June	c
,	c
2000	c

I	c
am	c
really	c
happy	c
to	c
receive	c
letter	i
about	c
Camp	c
California	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
exciting	i
and	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
doing	i
camp	i
there	c
.	c

Plus	c
,	c
it	c
may	c
be	c
lovely	c
weather	c
at	c
that	c
time	c
in	c
U.S.A	i
.	c

How	c
was	c
your	c
exam	c
?	c

I	c
believe	c
it	c
went	c
well	c
!	c

By	c
the	c
way	c
,	c
last	c
month	c
I	c
was	c
in	c
that	c
pop	c
concert	c
which	c
you	c
mentioned	c
in	c
your	c
last	c
letters	c
.	c

Can	c
you	c
believe	c
it	c
?	c

I	c
've	c
sold	c
tickets	c
before	c
but	c
not	c
in	c
that	c
kind	c
of	c
big	c
pop	c
concert	c
.	c

Before	c
it	c
was	c
packed	c
into	c
by	c
audience	i
,	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
clean	c
around	c
the	c
reception	c
,	c
but	c
totally	i
it	c
was	c
really	c
exciting	c
although	c
I	c
was	c
just	c
a	c
staff	i
in	c
the	c
small	c
reception	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
felt	c
great	c
excitement	c
(	c
especially	c
girls	c
!	c
)	c
from	c
people	c
queing	i
.	c

I	c
liked	c
that	c
especially	c
.	c

I	c
like	c
to	c
face	c
people	c
whom	c
even	i
I	i
do	i
n't	i
know	c
.	c

Foremost	c
,	c
after	c
finishing	c
my	c
work	c
,	c
I	c
could	c
meet	c
singers	c
by	c
chance	c
!	c
!	c

That	c
night	c
was	c
brilliant	c
and	c
class	c
!	c

Anyway	c
,	c
hope	c
to	c
hear	c
from	c
you	c
shortly	c
.	c

See	c
you	c
.	c

From	c

Dear	c
manager	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
which	c
was	c
held	c
last	c
week	c
.	c

I	c
feel	c
disappointed	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
different	c
to	c
the	i
advertisement	c
.	c

The	c
show	c
was	i
started	i
at	c
20.15	c
but	c
actually	c
it	c
should	c
started	i
at	c
19.30	c
.	c

And	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
we	c
went	c
to	c
visit	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
afraid	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
a	i
best	c
musical	c
show	c
because	c
all	i
the	i
things	i
above	i
was	i
not	i
an	i
accurate	i
as	i
what	i
we	i
had	i
been	i
told	i
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
your	c
reply	c
.	c

Your	i
faithfully	c
,	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

Actually	c
,	c
we	c
were	c
quite	c
good	c
friends	c
before	c
the	i
event	c
happened	c
.	c

Pat	c
has	c
been	c
studying	c
in	c
the	c
same	c
class	c
with	c
me	c
since	i
this	c
year	c
.	c

She	c
is	i
sitting	i
next	c
to	c
me	c
,	i
we	i
started	c
to	c
chat	c
more	c
and	c
more	c
,	i
then	i
we	c
became	c
good	c
friends	c
.	c

Suddenly	c
my	c
heart	c
was	c
thumbing	i
so	c
quickly	c
because	c
I	c
saw	c
him	c
?	i
-	c
A	i
boy	c
who	c
is	i
a	c
new	c
student	c
.	c

I	c
know	c
this	c
is	c
one	i
right	i
love	i
,	i
I	c
'm	c
absolutely	c
besorrted	i
of	i
him	c
.	c

Now	c
,	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
talk	c
to	c
her	c
anymore	c
because	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
stand	c
a	c
person	c
who	c
I	c
trusted	c
betrayed	i
me	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
found	c
it	c
very	c
disappointing	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
not	c
at	c
19.30	c
so	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
wait	c
for	c
45	c
minutes	c
on	i
the	i
seat	c
so	i
it	c
made	c
me	c
upset	c
.	c

Thirdly	c
,	c
you	c
state	c
that	c
there	c
are	c
discounts	c
available	c
but	c
I	c
could	c
not	c
get	c
any	c
reductions	c
at	c
all	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
must	c
insist	c
that	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
full	c
refund	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
receiving	c
your	c
cheque	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c
.	c

For	c
many	c
years	c
scientific	c
and	c
technological	c
break	i
throughs	i
have	c
changed	c
our	c
lives	c
.	c

So	c
the	i
life	c
is	c
much	c
faster	c
and	c
more	c
convenient	c
than	c
before	c
.	c

I	c
used	c
to	c
write	c
letters	c
but	c
it	c
takes	c
time	c
to	c
arrive	c
there	c
or	c
sometimes	c
disappear	i
so	i
E-mail	c
is	c
brilliant	c
for	c
my	c
life	c
.	c

Before	c
I	c
go	c
on	c
holiday	c
I	c
use	c
internet	i
to	c
book	c
or	c
get	c
details	c
from	c
travel	i
agency	c
,	c
which	c
means	c
I	c
could	c
save	c
my	c
time	c
and	c
physical	c
energy	c
.	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
with	c
regard	c
to	c
the	c
letter	c
I	c
've	c
just	c
received	c
as	c
I	c
wish	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
some	c
further	c
information	c
about	c
myself	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
rather	c
travel	c
on	i
July	c
because	c
I	c
'm	c
not	c
as	c
busy	c
as	c
on	i
June	c
or	c
August	c
and	c
because	c
in	c
my	c
opinion	c
during	c
July	c
there	c
's	c
excellent	c
weather	c
.	c

Regarding	c
the	c
accommodation	c
I	i
would	c
prefer	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
because	c
in	c
my	c
opinion	c
tents	c
are	c
very	c
uncomfortable	c
to	c
sleep	c
and	i
they	c
are	c
n't	c
very	c
cozy	i
.	c

I	c
've	c
also	c
chosen	c
singing	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
for	c
vegetarian	c
food	c
for	c
me	c
as	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
very	c
extrict	i
vegan	c
,	c
and	c
to	c
suggest	c
me	i
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
to	c
bring	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
really	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
my	c
stay	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
and	c
to	c
your	c

Yours	c

Nuria	c

Well	c

I	c
've	c
just	c
polled	c
some	c
students	c
and	c
here	c
are	c
their	c
responses	c
.	c

70	c
%	c
of	c
students	c
think	c
we	c
should	c
film	c
the	c
Speech	c

Drama	c
lesson	c
because	c
is	i
one	c
of	c
the	c
lessons	c
they	c
enjoy	c
the	c
most	c
.	c

The	c
vast	c
majority	c
say	c
Maths	c
and	c
History	c
should	c
be	c
filmed	c
too	c
,	c
because	c
they	c
love	c
these	c
subjects	c
and	c
think	c
they	c
are	c
very	c
interesting	c
and	c
are	c
also	c
great	c
fun	c
.	c

60	c
%	c
of	c
students	c
say	c

be	c
filmed	c

because	c
they	c
want	c
to	c
show	c
in	c
the	c
video	c
they	i
can	c
also	c
have	c
fun	c
at	c
school	c

Most	c
of	c
them	c
said	c
Science	c

English	c

Literature	c
should	c

also	i
very	c
boring	c

Dear	c
Madam	c
,	c

Here	c
are	i
some	c
information	i
and	c
details	c
you	c
requested	c
:	c

About	i
your	c
activities	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
picked	c
basketball	c

because	c
I	c
love	c
it	c
:	c
I	c
am	i
a	i
player	i
in	c
a	c
local	c
club	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
playing	c
for	c
twelve	c
years	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
guess	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
"	c
good	c
"	c
player	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
also	c
chosen	c
photography	c
in	i
your	c
list	c

of	c
California	c
must	c
be	c

and	c
I	c
would	c
love	c
bringing	i
some	i
"	c
well-taken	c
"	c
photos	c
of	c
the	c
area	c

Lastly	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
know	c
if	c
all	c
meals	c
are	c
included	c
in	c
your	c
package	c
.	c

Yours	c

We	c
decided	c
to	c
make	c
a	c
short	c
film	c
about	c

showed	i
through	c

"	c
A	c

"	c
It	c
will	c
be	c

At	c

want	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c

One	c
evening	c
,	c
while	c
I	c
was	c
walking	c
around	c
the	c
city	c
I	i
saw	c
a	c
very	c
interesting	c
advertisement	c
,	c
which	c
was	c
about	c
a	c
musical	c
show	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
a	c
fun	i
of	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
so	c
when	c
I	c
read	c
in	i
the	i
advertisement	i
his	i
name	i
I	c
immediately	c
decided	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
n't	c
true	c
;	c
there	c
were	c
n't	c
any	c
discounts	c
.	c

The	c
show	c
started	c
at	c
20.15	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
disaster	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
people	c
in	c
the	c

were	c
n't	c

According	c
to	c
an	i
advertisement	c
,	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
events	c
will	c
take	c

during	c
the	c

such	c
as	c
make	i

In	c

it	c

After	c
consideration	c
,	c
we	c
would	c
like	c
you	c

We	c
are	c
politely	c
asking	c

It	c
would	c
be	c

Nowaday	i
,	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
celebrities	c
,	c
such	c
as	c
pop	c
,	c
film	c
and	c
sports	c
stars	c
,	c
suffer	c
from	c
being	i
intruded	i
on	i
the	i
privacy	i
of	i
their	i
lives	i
.	c

Undoubtedly	c
,	c
their	c
the	i
first	c
enemies	c
are	c
"	c
Journalists	c
"	c
.	c

Because	c
it	c
is	c
interesting	c
and	c
they	c
can	c
forget	c
about	c
their	c
own	c
problems	c
by	c
imagining	c
celebrities	c
'	c
luxurious	c
lives	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
other	c
people	c
are	c
against	c
following	c
celebrities	c
and	c
photographing	c
them	c
every	c
moment	c
.	c

What	c
is	c
more	c
,	c
they	c
insist	c
that	c
before	i
celebrities	c
,	c
they	c
are	c
also	c
human-beings	i
who	c
want	c
to	c
live	c
without	c
being	c
disturbed	c
and	c
watched	c
.	c

Taking	c
everything	c
account	i
,	c
the	c
drawbacks	c
far	c
outweigh	c
its	c
benefits	c
.	c

Thus	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
journalists	c
should	c
consider	c
celebrities	c
'	c
lives	c
and	c
be	i
in	c
celebrities	c
'	c
shoes	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
just	i
in	c
July	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
going	c
to	c
study	c
at	c
my	c
university	c
untill	i
the	c
end	c
of	c
June	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
glad	c
that	c
all	c
accommodation	c
and	c
travel	c
costs	c
have	c
been	c
paid	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
live	i
in	c
the	i
tent	i
cabin	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
more	c
comfortable	c
.	c

The	c
climbing	c
and	c
the	c
painting	c
are	c
preferred	c
by	c
me	c
the	c
most	c
.	c

Generally	c
I	c
paint	c
some	c
landscapes	c
by	c
using	c
the	i
watercolours	c
,	c
but	c
sometimes	c
I	c
try	c
to	c
paint	c
like	c
during	c
the	c
impresionist	i
by	i
using	c
blobs	c
,	c
oil	c
paint	c
and	c
canvases	c
.	c

At	i
the	i
end	i
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
with	c
me	c
and	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
will	c
need	c
for	c
the	c
normal	c
life	c
at	c
the	c
camp	c

Report	c
on	c
making	c
a	i
interesting	c
video	c
film	c

The	c
aim	c
of	c
this	c
report	c
is	c
to	c
suggest	c
which	c
lessons	c
and	c
other	c
activities	c
should	c
be	c
place	i
at	i
video	i
film	c
about	c
daily	c
life	c
at	c
our	c
school	c
.	c

In	c
order	c
to	c
preper	i
it	c
I	c
visited	c
some	c
clasrooms	i
during	c
the	c
lessons	c
and	c
I	c
interviewed	c
a	c
number	c
of	c
students	c
from	c
our	c
school	c
.	c

Some	c
of	c
the	c
teachers	c
are	c
very	c
good	c
just	i
profesionalists	i
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
the	c
teacher	c
of	c
history	c
and	c
polish	i
language	c
is	c
able	c
to	c
interest	c
students	c
about	i
the	c
subject	c
in	c
differents	i
ways	c
.	c

It	c
can	i
show	c
that	c
during	c
every	c
day	c
we	c
have	c
a	i
big	i
fun	c
and	c
we	c
recived	i
a	i
good	c
,	c
important	c
knowledge	c
.	c

If	c
we	c
take	i
under	i
an	i
attention	i
this	i
things	c
our	c
film	c
is	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
very	c
interesting	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
madam	c
,	c

According	c
to	c
the	c
advertisement	c
,	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
would	c
be	c
starring	c
but	i
it	c
was	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
at	c
the	c
wrong	c
time	c
.	c

It	c
started	c
fourty	i
five	i
minutes	c
later	c
.	c

So	c
why	c
you	i
make	c
this	c
invitation	c
?	c

I	c
suppose	c
that	c
you	c
are	i
understanding	i
my	c
situation	c
,	c
because	c
you	c
did	c
not	c
say	i
the	c
truth	c
.	c

Sometimes	c
there	c
advantages	i
but	c
there	c
some	i
disadvantages	c
too	c
.	c

So	c
the	c
main	c
advantage	c
of	c
the	i
modern	c
technology	c
is	c
that	c
things	c
are	c
becoming	c
easier	c
and	c
easier	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
certain	c
drawbacks	c
.	c

First	c
and	c
foremost	c
is	c
the	c
pollution	c
and	c
big	c
cities	c
are	c
suffering	c
with	c
it	c
.	c

A	c
further	c
disadvantage	c
is	c
that	c
children	c
are	c
growing	c
up	c
very	c
lazy	c
.	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
both	c
positives	i
and	c
negatives	i
aspects	c
of	i
the	i
modern	c
technology	c
,	c
because	c
it	c
can	c
makes	i
our	c
lives	c
easy	c
but	c
at	c
the	c
same	c
time	c
it	c
is	c
causing	c
lots	c
of	c
problems	c
for	c
us	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
received	c
your	c
letter	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
reply	c
for	i
it	c
.	c

To	c
begin	c
with	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
join	c
the	c
camp	c
only	c
in	c
July	c
.	c

My	c
school	c
starts	c
a	c
summer	c
holyday	i
from	c
1st	c
July	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
going	c
to	c
take	c
a	c
summer	c
course	c
from	c
August	c
.	c

Therefore	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
the	c
middle	c
of	c
July	c
.	c

What	c
short	i
of	c
clothes	c
should	c
I	c
prepare	i
?	c

According	c
to	c
your	c
letter	c
,	c
all	c
travel	c
costs	c
are	c
included	c
in	c
your	c
service	c
,	c
however	c
,	c
how	c
much	c
pocket	c
money	c
do	c
I	c
need	c
?	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

There	c
are	c
some	c
advantages	c
when	c
people	c
go	c
shopping	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
shopping	c
sometimes	c
make	i
them	c
stressfull	i
.	c

In	c
addition	c
,	c
a	c
shop	c
assistant	c
gives	c
them	c
a	i
wrong	c
advice	c
.	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
many	c
disadvantages	c
as	c
well	c
as	c
advantages	c
.	c

If	c
people	c
want	c
to	c
enjoy	c
shopping	c
,	c
we	i
must	c
consider	c
before	c
buy	i
something	c
-	c
do	c
I	c
really	c
want	c
it	c
?	c

I	c
also	c
recommend	c
a	i
window	c
shopping	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
the	c
best	c
way	c
to	c
enjoy	c
shopping	c
.	c

You	c
do	c
not	c
have	c
to	c
waste	c
money	c
at	c
all	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
say	c
how	c
happy	c
I	c
am	c
to	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
take	c
part	c
of	i
"	c
Camp	c
California	c
in	c
the	c
USA	c
"	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
inform	c
you	c
that	c
I	c
am	c
able	c
to	c
go	c
there	c
only	c
in	c
July	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
live	i
in	c
a	c
tent	c
during	c
your	c
camp	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
always	c
dreamt	c
about	c
sleeping	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
,	c
in	c
sleeping	c
bags	c
,	c
but	c
my	c
parent	i
always	c
took	c
me	c
to	c
expensive	c
hotels	c
,	c
so	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
nice	c
adventure	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

(	c
Do	c
I	c
need	c
any	c
special	c
garments	c
?	c
)	c
and	c
could	c
you	c
tell	c
me	c
please	c
,	c
if	c
I	c
need	c
some	c
extra	c
money	c
to	c
pay	c
for	c
anything	c
like	c
trips	c
or	c
photo-paper	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

Sometimes	c
I	c
like	c
doing	c
it	c
during	c
long	c
Sundays	c
.	c

Sometimes	c
unfortunatelly	i
shopping	c
could	i
be	c
very	c
annoying	c
,	c
especially	c
at	c
Christmast	i
or	c
Easter	c
time	c
.	c

Then	c
,	c
all	c
shops	c
and	c
supermarkets	c
are	c
crowded	c
.	c

People	c
are	c
pushing	c
each	c
other	c
,	c
they	c
are	c
not	c
as	c
kind	c
as	c
usually	i
.	c

Another	c
period	c
when	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
like	c
doing	c
shopping	c
is	c
when	c
there	c
is	c
a	c
huge	c
sale	c
!	c

I	c
always	c
go	c
absolutely	c
crazy	c
when	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
do	c
shopping	c
then	c
!	c

You	c
just	c
cannot	c
refuse	i
buying	c
another	c
bottle	c
of	c
body	c
lotion	c
or	c
another	c
box	c
of	c
soap	c
because	c
they	c
smell	c
so	c
nice	c
can	c
you	c
?	c
!	c

I	c
always	c
become	c
very	c
angry	c
with	c
myself	c
afterwards	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
cannot	c
help	c
it	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
shopping	c
could	c
be	c
really	c
enjoyable	c
!	c

The	c
only	c
advice	c
would	c
be	c
:	c
"	c
Do	c
not	c
do	c
your	c
shopping	c
at	c
Christmast	i
or	c
Easter	c
time	c
"	c
-	c
but	c
it	c
will	c
not	c
make	c
any	c
sense	c
,	c
will	c
it	c
?	c

So	c
you	c
just	c
have	c
to	c
get	c
used	c
to	c
it	c
,	c
and	c
enjoy	c
your	c
shopping	c
for	c
the	c
rest	c
time	i
of	c
the	c
year	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

Having	c
seen	c
with	i
two	c
of	c
my	c
friends	c
your	i
musical	c
show	c
last	c
week-end	i
at	c
The	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
which	i
called	i
"	c
OVER	c
THE	c
RAINBOW	c
"	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
our	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
in	c
your	c
advertisement	c
you	c
refer	c
to	c
discounts	c
that	c
are	c
available	c
,	c
but	c
when	i
we	c
bought	c
our	c
tickets	c
,	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
employees	c
refused	c
to	c
give	c
us	c
'	c
tickets	i
student	i
price	i
'	c
.	c

Usually	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
starts	c
at	c
19:30	c
,	c
but	c
this	c
time	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
wait	c
until	c
20:15	c
!	c

In	c
addition	c
to	c
this	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
the	c
famous	c
actors	c
that	c
you	c
have	i
mentionned	i
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
,	i
so	c
we	c
were	c
disappointed	c
.	c

Concerning	c
the	c
restaurant	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
due	i
to	i
transformations	i
.	c

In	i
the	i
result	i
,	c
I	c
am	c
sure	c
you	c
will	c
understand	c
our	c
annoyed	i
and	c
frustrated	i
,	c
so	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
a	i
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
that	c
your	c
advertisement	c
stated	c
was	i
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
request	c
a	c
full-refund	i
for	c
my	c
friends	c
and	c
I	i
,	c
because	c
I	c
felt	c
your	c
advertisement	c
was	c
misleading	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

H.	c
Boulard	c

What	c
do	c
you	c
think	c
about	i
what	i
will	i
clothes	i
be	c
like	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
?	c

Let	c
's	c
have	c
a	c
look	c
at	c
different	c
points	c
.	c

From	c
the	c
past	c
until	c
now	c
,	c
we	c
have	c
wearing	i
several	c
different	c
fashionable	i
clothes	i
,	c
but	c
why	c
?	c

From	c
my	c
point	c
of	c
view	c
,	c
almost	c
all	c
humans	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
be	c
more	i
and	i
more	c
attractive	c
,	c
so	c
we	c
always	c
think	c
about	c
it	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
it	c
's	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
best	c
way	i
to	c
make	c
money	c
.	c

Anyway	c
,	c
do	c
n't	c
you	c
think	c

We	c
ca	c
n't	c

The	c
last	c
survey	c
about	c
fashion	c
shown	i
that	c
people	c
feel	c
really	c
comfortable	c
with	c
those	i
now	c
!	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
because	c
I	c
'm	c
very	c
disappointed	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
not	c
from	c
here	c
(	c
this	c
city	c
)	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
know	c
everything	c
about	c
it	c
:	c
it	i
's	i
culture	c
,	c
history	c
and	c
the	c
famous	c
musicals	c
.	c

Yesterday	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
to	c
see	c
a	c
musical	c
show	i
.	c

I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
to	c
see	c
at	i
what	c
time	c
was	i
the	i
show	i
,	c
19.30	c
,	i
it	i
was	c
O.K.	i
so	c
I	c
bought	c
a	c
ticket	c
.	c

In	i
that	c
moment	c
my	c
problems	c
began	c
.	c

Then	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
wait	c
45	c
mins	i
,	i
the	c
show	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
.	c

Then	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
was	c
n't	c
acting	c
,	c
it	i
was	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
.	c

That	c
was	c
too	c
much	c
.	c

"	c
Dear	c
"	c
manager	c
I	c
hope	c
you	c
to	i
understand	i
me	c
,	c
so	i
I	c
ask	c
for	c
money	c
back	c
and	c
I	c
hope	c
this	c
wont	i
happen	c
again	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
I	i
think	c
we	c
have	c
grown	c
with	i
the	i
technology	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
difficult	c
for	c
us	c
to	c
realize	i
the	c
changes	c
in	c
our	c
live	i
,	c
but	c
we	c
can	c
think	c
about	c
it	i
.	c

How	c
has	c
it	c
change	i
my	c
daily	c
life	c
?	c

Homework	c
is	c
easer	i
to	c
find	i
in	i
the	c
cumputer	i
than	c
in	i
a	c
book	c
sometimes	c
.	c

Modern	c
technology	c
showed	c
us	c
that	c
we	c
could	c
do	c
anything	c
we	c
wanted	c
to	c
,	c
and	c
it	c
make	i
us	c
thing	i
more	c
about	c
my	i
future	c
job	i
.	c

Finaly	i
when	c
we	c
had	c
seen	c
the	c
Musical	c
,	c
we	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
restaurant	c
and	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
they	c
done	i
some	c
dekoreting	i
,	c
and	c
you	c
wrott	i
in	c
your	c
advertisement	c
"	i
Visit	c
our	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
"	c

We	c
are	c
very	c
disappointed	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
a	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
for	c
us	c
,	c
therefore	c
we	c
would	c
have	i
your	i
money	c
back	c
.	c

I	c
looking	i
forwart	i
to	c
hear	i
from	c
you	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

Clothes	c
in	c
the	c
future	c

If	c
you	c
travlling	i
around	c
you	c
can	c
see	c
lot	i
of	c
different	i
still	c
from	i
different	c
culture	i
.	c

At	i
first	i
I	c
think	c
that	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
we	c
are	c
going	c
to	c
wear	c
less	i
clothes	c
because	c
the	c
climet	i
are	i
being	i
warmer	c
and	c
warmer	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
make	i
you	c
know	c
how	c
angry	c
I	c
am	c
for	i
having	c
gone	c
to	c
one	c
of	c
your	c
shows	c
.	c

I	c
went	c
to	c
London	c
for	c
a	c
week	c
's	c
holiday	c
with	c
some	c
friends	c
and	c
every	c
evening	c
we	c
decided	c
something	i
to	i
do	i
in	c
order	c
to	c
enjoy	c
our	c
staying	i
in	c
that	c
beautiful	c
city	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
when	c
I	c
paid	c
my	i
ticket	c
I	c
noticed	c
that	c
nobody	c
could	c
obtain	c
the	c
discount	c
you	c
'd	c
written	c
about	c
.	c

But	c
that	c
would	c
be	c
nothing	c
if	c
I	i
thought	i
to	i
dinner	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
cancelled	i
because	c
your	c
show	c
started	c
at	c
20.15	c
,	c
although	c
it	c
should	c
have	c
been	c
at	c
19.30	c
!	c

At	c
that	c
point	c
,	c
even	c
if	c
there	i
had	i
been	i
Danny	i
Brook	i
as	c
the	c
advertisement	c
announced	c
,	c
it	c
would	i
n't	i
have	c
been	c
a	c
less	i
disappointing	c
evening	c
.	c

According	i
to	i
all	c
these	c
things	c
,	c
I	c
ask	i
my	i
money	c
back	c
.	c

In	i
that	i
period	i
we	c
were	c
n't	c
getting	c
on	c
with	c
.	i

It	c
was	c
only	c
a	c
dinner	c
with	c
a	c
friend	c
and	c
in	c
fact	c
we	c
'd	c
spent	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
remembering	c
our	c
childhood	c
,	c
but	c
probably	c
Pat	c
can	i
have	i
thought	c
that	c
Peter	c
and	c
I	c
were	c
n't	c
only	c
friends	c
.	c

He	c
became	c
very	c
angry	c
no	c
matter	c
how	c
hard	c
I	c
tried	c
telling	i
him	c
the	c
truth	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
what	c
it	i
happened	c
me	i
two	c
days	c
ago	c
,	c
during	c
you	i
musical	c
show	c
"	c
OVER	c
THE	c
RAINBOW	c
"	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
decided	c
buying	i
a	c
ticket	c
,	c
but	c
no	c
discounts	c
were	c
available	c
.	c

Nobody	c
informed	c
me	c
about	c
it	i
.	c

After	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
my	c
friends	c
and	c
me	i
decided	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
your	c
restaurant	c
,	c
but	c
we	c
were	c
amazed	c
to	c
find	c
it	c
close	i
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
I	c
ask	i
for	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
a	i
perfect	c
evening	c
like	i
your	c
advice	i
showed	i
.	c

I	c
hope	c
that	c
you	c
understand	c
me	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
true	c
that	c
modern	c
technology	c
has	c
changed	c
our	c
daily	c
life	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
pass	i
,	c
for	c
example	c
,	c
we	c
used	c
to	c
write	c
letters	c
to	c
comunicate	i
,	c
but	c
now	c
we	c
surely	i
send	c
an	c
e-mail	c
,	c
a	c
fax	c
or	c
make	c
a	c
phone	c
.	i

Certainly	c
it	i
will	i
be	i
easier	c
and	c
faster	c
than	c
write	i
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
nice	c
when	c
you	c
were	c
waiting	c
for	c
a	c
letter	c
.	c

Everyone	c
have	i
to	c
use	c
modern	c
technology	c
carefully	c
,	c
because	c
too	c
much	c
technology	c
could	c
be	c
dangerous	c
.	c

It	c
could	i
n't	i
allow	i
us	c
to	i
think	i
and	c
to	i
do	i
freely	c
.	c

Today	c
there	c
are	c
children	c
that	i
do	c
n't	c
know	c
nothing	i
about	c
nature	c
and	c
its	c
things	c
.	c

Probably	c
,	c
because	c
their	c
parents	c
have	c
n't	c
enough	c
time	c
to	c
go	i
out	i
the	c
city	c
and	c
show	c
them	c
nature	c
.	c

Yes	c
,	c
but	c
we	c
must	c
n't	c
loose	i
the	i
values	c
and	i
our	c
free	i
time	i
to	c
stay	i
with	c
our	c
family	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
really	c
glad	c
to	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
win	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
and	c
travel	c
to	c
the	c
U.S.A.	c
which	i
I	c
used	c
to	c
dream	c
.	i

At	i
first	i
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
only	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
I	c
study	c
at	c
University	c
at	c
the	c
moment	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
they	c
will	c
give	c
me	c
such	c
a	c
long	c
holiday	c
enough	i
to	c
travel	c
for	c
two	c
weeks	c
in	c
June	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
rather	c
play	c
golf	c
and	c
go	c
sailing	c
,	c
than	c
the	c
others	c
so	i
as	c
to	c
find	c
new	c
hobbies	c
in	c
my	c
life	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
what	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
is	c
what	c
sort	c
of	c
cloths	i
are	c
suitable	c
for	c
the	i
travelling	c
,	c
and	c
also	c
,	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	i
should	i
prepare	c
for	c
the	c
travelling	i
,	c
approximately	c
.	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

How	c
are	c
you	c
going	i
these	c
days	c
?	c

In	c
my	c
view	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
extremely	c
interesting	c
and	c
satisfing	i
for	c
me	c
all	c
the	c
concert	c
long	c
.	c

Talking	c
of	c
my	c
work	c
,	c
I	c
had	i
to	i
mostly	i
make	i
the	c
concert	c
stage	c
with	c
some	c
fellows	i
.	c

If	c
you	c
choose	i
the	c
post	c
,	c
you	c
would	c
be	c
exhausted	i
throughlly	i
in	i
the	c
end	c
of	c
the	c
concert	c
.	c

Although	c
I	c
can	i
not	i
explain	c
any	c
more	c
about	c
the	c
thing	c
I	c
felt	c
during	c
the	c
concert	c
in	c
this	c
letter	c
,	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
recomend	i
you	c
to	c
help	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
or	i
the	i
other	i
.	c

See	c
you	c
and	c
write	c
me	i
soon	c
.	c

Best	c
Wishes	c

I	c
am	c
satisfied	i
to	c
have	c
received	c
your	c
letter	c
that	c
informed	c
me	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
just	c
been	c
in	i
tent	i
and	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
always	c
a	c
beautiful	c
and	c
interested	i
adventure	c
.	c

I	c
like	i
also	i
doing	i
photography	c
because	c
they	i
can	i
be	i
memories	i
IN	i
my	i
future	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
receive	i
further	c
information	c
about	c
which	i
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
should	c
put	i
off	i
during	c
my	c
holiday	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
know	i
if	c
I	c
should	c
bring	c
with	c
me	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
money	c
.	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
afraid	c
that	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
write	c
you	i
immediatly	i
,	c
but	c
last	c
month	c
I	c
enjoyed	c
helping	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
and	c
so	c
I	c
am	i
very	c
busy	c
.	c

Even	c
if	c
the	c
job	c
was	c
so	i
hard	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
an	c
amused	i
experience	c
.	c

I	c
particularly	c
liked	c
to	i
know	i
people	c
of	i
different	c
countries	c
and	c
some	c
pop-stars	c
,	c
which	i
were	c
friendly	c
with	i
us	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
surprised	c
of	i
the	c
co-operation	c
that	c
there	c
was	c
during	i
the	i
job	i
,	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
as	i
a	c
big	c
family	c
,	c
where	c
each	c
member	c
helped	i
others	i
.	c

There	c
was	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
work	c
to	c
do	c
but	c
we	c
were	c
happy	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
with	c
glad	i
people	c
and	c
at	c
the	c
end	c
we	c
had	c
the	c
possibility	i
to	c
take	c
part	c
in	c
the	c
pop	c
concert	c
.	c

I	i
greet	i
you	i
.	c

Best	c
wishes	c

Yesterday	c
,	c
I	c
received	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
.	c

The	c
two	c
activities	c
I	c
have	c
chosen	c
is	i
swimming	c
and	c
climbing	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
swim	c
in	c
a	c
sea	c
like	c
California	c
's	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
clean	c
and	c
beautiful	c
.	c

I	c
chose	c
climbing	c
because	c
I	c
'm	c
intrested	i
in	c
this	c
sport	c
even	i
if	i
I	c
'm	c
not	c
experienced	c
.	c

I	c
like	c
it	c
because	c
it	c
offers	c
you	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
adventure	c
and	c
action	c
.	c

Yesterday	c
I	c
received	c

and	c
it	c
made	c
me	c
happy	c
that	c
you	c

Before	c

I	c
helped	c
in	i
carring	i
and	c
putting	c
in	c
order	c
some	c
chairs	c
on	c
which	c
would	i
sit	i
some	i
special	i
persons	i
.	c

It	c
was	c
very	c
hard	c
and	c
at	c
the	c
end	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
tired	c
.	c

Dear	c
Ryan	c

been	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
most	c
wonderful	c
experience	i
in	i
my	c
life	c

but	c
the	c
concert	i

was	c
really	c
amazing	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
my	c
awful	c

at	c
the	c
Circle	c

Last	c
week	c
I	c
went	c
to	c

a	c

show	c
called	c
'	c
OVER	c
THE	c
RAINBOW	c
'	c
at	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
shocked	c
.	c

The	c
show	c
started	c
late	i
then	i
I	c
expected	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
because	c
they	c
closed	c
early	i
than	c
usual	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
disappointed	c
with	c
everything	c
what	i
happened	c
last	c
week	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
a	c
refund	c

long-sleeved	c
shirts	c
,	c
jumpers	c
,	c
etc.	c
They	c
also	c
wear	c
little	c
items	c
on	c
them	c
to	c
go	c
with	c
their	c
clothes	c
.	c

Like	c
earings	i
,	c
necklaces	c
,	c
bracelets	c
,	c
rings	c
,	c
glasses	c
,	c
hairbands	i
,	c
hand	i
bags	i
,	c
shoes	c
,	c
watches	c
,	c
etc.	c
They	c
like	c
designers	i
clothes	c
and	c
everyone	c
wear	i
different	c
modern	c
clothes	c
in	i
size	c
,	c
in	i
colour	c
and	c
in	i
shapes	i
.	c

I	c
think	c
everyone	c
will	c
wear	c
balloons	c
for	c
clothes	c
in	c
future	i
.	c

Every	i
one	i
will	c
wear	c
very	c
colourful	c
balloons	c
on	i
them	i
.	c

They	c
will	c
bounced	i
on	c
roads	c
with	c
there	i
balloon	c
clothes	c
.	c

In	c
future	i
they	c
will	c
wear	c
balloon	c
clothes	c
,	c
because	c
to	i
make	i
people	i
fly	i
.	c

If	c
we	c
use	c
up	i
carbon	c
dioxide	c
with	i
balloon	i
clothes	c
there	c
will	c
be	c
less	c
carbon	c
dioxide	c
on	c
Earth	c
,	c
so	c
there	c
is	c
no	c
worry	c
about	c
Ozone	i
breaking	i
.	c

After	c
we	c
waited	c
for	c
half	c
an	c
hour	c
to	c
get	c
two	c
spare	c
seat	c
tickets	c
,	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
wait	c
45	c
minutes	c
until	c
it	c
started	c
.	c

So	c
when	c
the	c
miserable	c
musical	c
came	c
to	c
his	i
end	c
,	c
we	c
were	c
happy	c
to	c
leave	c
the	c
theater	i
room	i
,	c
but	c
we	c
both	c
wanted	c
to	c
have	c
dinner	c
in	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
,	c
because	c
no	c
restaurantes	i
were	c
opened	i
anymore	c
,	c
because	c
it	c
started	c
too	c
late	c
.	c

So	c
we	c
went	c
upstairs	c
to	c
find	c
the	c
restaurant	c
,	c
but	c
we	c
just	c
a	i
big	c
empty	c
hall	c
,	c
with	c
nothing	c
in	c
it	c
,	c
with	c
a	c
short	i
sign	c
on	c
a	c
door	c
:	c
"	c
Sorry	c
,	c
we	c
are	c
closed	c
because	i
of	i
renovations	c
"	c
!	c

We	c
thought	c
it	c
would	i
be	i
a	c
joke	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
.	c

Sincerely	c

Hedwiga	c
Heinkel	c

And	c
we	c
knew	c
that	c
from	c
the	i
day	c
on	c
,	i
that	c
he	i
knows	i
anything	c
about	c
our	c
secret	c
we	c
will	i
live	c
in	c
danger	c
being	i
caught	c
.	c

We	c
had	c
this	c
idea	c
first	c
,	i
when	c
we	c
watched	c
a	c
movie	c
about	c
the	c
Italian	c
mafia	c
in	c
an	c
English	c
lesson	c
in	c
school	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
love	i
of	i
first	i
slight	i
and	c
we	c
were	c
fascinated	c
by	c
the	c
thought	c
,	i
building	i
a	i
kind	i
of	i
the	i
same	i
organisation	c
in	c
our	c
town	c
.	c

Pat	c
was	c
my	c
big	c
brother	c
,	c
who	c
had	c
heaed	i
of	c
some	c
people	c
paying	c
,	c
"	c
safty-money	i
"	c
,	c
but	c
never	c
know	c
the	c
reason	c
,	c
until	c
he	c
found	c
a	c
big	i
amout	i
of	c
money	c
in	c
my	c
room	c
.	c

His	c
thoughts	i
combined	i
and	c
ready	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
police	c
he	c
went	i
out	i
of	i
our	c
house	c
,	c
where	c
me	c
and	c
my	c
homies	i
were	c
just	c
hanging	c
aroud	i
.	c

It	c
was	c
wonderful	i
surprise	c
when	c
I	c
received	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
this	c
great	c
opportunity	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
inform	c
you	c
that	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
travel	c
only	c
in	c
July	c
,	c
which	c
is	c
the	c
only	c
month	c
I	c
can	c
take	c
holiday	c
from	c
my	c
work	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
enjoy	c

I	c
look	c

receiving	c
your	c

Yours	i
sincerely	i
,	i

Yes	c

At	c
first	c
,	c
I	c
helped	c
stage	c
setting	c
,	c
as	c
you	c
know	c
they	c
use	c
lots	c
of	c
unique	c
tricks	c
in	c
their	c
concert	c
.	c

So	c
it	c
was	c
very	c
interesting	c
to	c
know	c
how	c
they	c
are	c
made	c
.	c

Then	c
,	c
I	c
helped	c
tuning	c
the	c
instruments	c
for	c
the	c
back	c
band	c
.	c

This	c
was	c
the	c
best	c
experience	c
.	c

Can	c
you	c
imagine	c
how	c
much	c
I	c
appreciated	c
that	c
I	c
am	c
qualified	c
in	c
massage	c
?	c

Hope	c
to	c
hear	c
from	c
you	c

Madamme	i

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
only	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
I	c
'm	c
supposed	c
to	c
be	c
a	c
volunteer	c
in	i
the	c
Music	c
festival	c
,	c
held	c
in	c
August	c
.	c

I	c
go	c
swimming	c
three	c
times	c
a	c
week	c
so	c
I	c
have	c
no	c
problem	c
with	c
swimming	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
also	c
the	i
member	c
of	c
photography	i
club	c
at	c
my	c
university	c
and	c
really	c
keen	c
on	c
taking	c
a	c
picture	c
of	c
nature	c
.	c

By	c
the	c
way	c
,	c
I	c
'm	c
wondering	c
what	c
kinds	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
should	c
prepare	i
and	c
how	c
much	c
much	i
I	c
should	c
bring	c
with	c
myself	i

I	c
'll	c
look	c

to	c
hearing	c
answers	c
from	c

Introduction	c

The	c

was	c
done	i
to	i
300	c

who	c
are	c
between	c
18-28	c
,	c
at	c
our	c
school	c
.	c

Prefered	i
lessons	c
.	c

The	i
70	c
%	c
of	c
students	c
said	c
that	c
the	c
acting	c
lesson	c
should	c
be	c
filmed	c
as	c
the	c
students	c
,	i
attending	c
this	c
lesson	c
,	c
are	c
not	c
only	c
excited	c
but	c
also	c
very	c
active	c
.	c

Additionally	c
,	c
15	c
%	c
of	c
students	c
answered	c
they	i
want	c
the	c
presentation	c
lesson	c
to	c
be	c
filmed	c
.	c

Prefered	i
activities	c
.	c

The	c
soccer	c
game	c
,	c
played	c
every	c
Monday	c
,	c
was	c
ranked	c
in	i
the	c
most	c

was	c
chosen	c
by	c
20	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
according	c
to	c
the	c
survey	c
,	c
it	c
's	c
obvious	c
that	c
more	c
than	c
half	c
of	c
students	i
want	c
acting	i
lesson	c
to	c
be	c
filmed	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
it	c
seems	c
that	c
the	c
students	c
prefer	c
the	c

to	c
be	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
good	i
programme	c
!	c

We	c
like	c
it	c
very	c
much	c
!	c

Also	c
,	c
you	c
'll	c
be	c
glad	c
to	c
know	c
,	i
that	c
for	c
students	c
it	c
is	c
free	c
!	c

So	c
,	c
we	c
can	c
change	c
your	c
programme	c
a	c
little	c
bit	c
to	i
the	i
best	i
one	i
.	c

On	c
Monday	c
afternoon	c
we	c
have	c
the	c
river	c
trip	c
to	c
Greenwich	c
,	c
as	c
you	c
have	c
written	c
on	i
your	c
programme	c
.	c

Our	c
class	c
asks	c
you	c
to	c
think	c
about	c
this	c
programme	c
.	c

She	c
was	c
speaking	i
about	c
him	c
every	i
time	c
.	c

And	c
said	c
just	c
to	i
be	i
careful	c
.	c

But	c
in	i
three	c
days	c
she	c
has	i
n't	i
been	i
at	i
home	c
.	c

We	c
called	c
the	c
police	c
.	c

They	c
advised	c
us	c
to	c
wait	c
.	c

I	c
took	i
the	c
phone	c
.	c

Someone	c
told	c
me	c
if	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
see	c
my	c
friend	c
,	c
I	c
must	c
take	i
5000$	c
and	c
bring	i
them	i
up	i
to	i
the	c
street	c
.	c

I	c
took	c
any	i
papers	i
,	c
put	c
them	i
to	i
one	i
bag	c
and	c
without	c
saying	c
anything	c
went	c
to	c
my	c
friend	c
to	c
take	i
something	c
like	i
gun	i
.	c

There	c
I	c
saw	c
a	c
man	c
and	c
my	c
friend	c
.	c

I	c
surprised	i
that	c
he	c
belived	i
me	c
.	c

Of	c
course	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
better	c
for	c
us	c
.	c

After	c
that	c
she	c
told	c
me	c
,	i
that	c
the	c
man	c
was	c
the	c
boy	c
,	i
which	i
she	c
met	i
.	c

Do	c
n't	c
believe	c
everyone	c

Better	c
check	c
,	c
if	c
you	c
are	c
not	c
sure	c

Dear	c
Mrs.	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
.	i

It	c
was	c
so	c
great	c
to	c
hear	c
that	c
I	c
had	c
won	c
first	c
prize	c
.	c

It	c
would	c
be	c
meaningful	c
in	c
my	c
life	c
to	c
take	c
part	c
in	c
your	c
camp	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
reply	c
about	i
your	c
questions	c
.	c

I	i
am	i
wondering	i
that	i
I	c
will	c
be	i
only	i
able	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
finish	c
my	c
first	c
year	c
at	c
the	c
university	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
to	c
this	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
already	c
resistered	c
another	i
course	c
which	c
starts	c
from	c
2nd	c
of	c
August	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
living	i
in	c
tents	c
,	c
I	c
always	i
admire	i
outdoors	i
life	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
surging	i
and	c
golf	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
I	c
used	c
to	c
play	c
golf	c
with	c
my	c
father	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
was	c
14	c
,	c
I	c
won	c
the	i
competition	c
.	c

I	c
want	c
to	c
let	c
you	c
know	c
about	c
my	c
experience	c
as	c
you	c
wanted	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
fantastic	c
because	c
I	c
could	c
see	c
Madonna	c
.	c

You	c
are	c
working	c
with	c
your	c
idea	i
woman	c
,	c
I	c
ca	i
n't	i
still	i
belive	i
that	c
I	c
spoke	c
with	c
her	c
.	c

If	c
we	c
had	c
worked	c
together	c
we	c
would	c
have	c
had	c
a	c
good	c
time	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
pity	i
,	c
is	c
n't	c
it	c
?	c

Next	c
time	c
,	c
I	c
hope	c
that	c
we	c
'll	c
work	c
together	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
to	c
go	c
now	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
that	c
you	c
'll	c
be	c
alright	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
so	c
happy	c
that	c
I	c
've	c
won	c
2	c
weeks	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
in	c
the	c
U.S.A.	c
At	c
first	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
belive	i
that	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
winer	i

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
at	i
the	c
Camp	c
in	c
July	c
,	c
if	c
is	i
possible	c
.	c

This	c
is	c
just	c
one	c
months	i
which	c
I	i
've	i
fee	i
.	c

July	c
is	c
months	i
when	c
I	c
'm	c
having	c
a	c
rest	c
and	c
I	c
'm	c
doing	c
nothing	c
.	c

In	c
August	c
I	c
'm	c
working	c
in	c
the	i
shop	c
which	c
is	c
my	c
sister	i
.	c

I	c
can	c
sleep	c
in	c
tent	i
,	c
it	c
would	c
remain	i
me	c
a	i
good	c
time	c
which	c
I	i
'd	i
spent	i
with	c
my	c
friends	c
a	c
few	c
years	c
ago	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
sure	c
would	i
be	c
good	c
fun	c
;	c
sleep	i
next	c
to	c
each	c
other	c
telling	c
scared	i
story	i
.	c

Also	c
I	c
know	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
the	c
chance	c
to	c
do	c
two	c
activities	c
while	c
I	c
'm	c
at	c
the	c
Camp	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
choose	c
basketball	c
.	c

Some	c
of	c
my	c
friends	c
say	c
that	c
I	c
'm	c
very	i
good	c
player	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
think	c
so	c
.	c

Another	c
sport	c
which	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
do	c
is	c
swimming	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
,	c
what	c
sort	c
of	c
clothes	c
shall	i
I	c
take	c
with	c
me	c
?	c

Know	i
,	c
I	c
can	c
just	i
wait	c
for	c
July	c

Hi	c
Kim	c
!	c

How	c
are	c
you	c
?	c

Last	c
month	c
I	c
was	c
helping	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
with	c
a	c
few	c
friends	c
of	c
mine	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
Tina	i
Turner	c
concert	c
!	c

To	i
this	c
moment	c
when	c
I	i
'm	i
thinking	i
of	c
it	c
I	c
want	c
shout	i
.	c

At	c
first	c
I	c
was	c
helping	c
to	c
seill	i
the	c
tickets	c
-	c
was	i
n't	c
difficult	c
.	c

We	c
had	c
to	c
check	c
evey	i
plug	c
,	c
switch	c
,	c
lights	i
.	c

When	c
concert	i
had	c
started	c
and	c
Tina	c
cam	i
out	c
I	c
forget	c
about	c
lights	c
,	c
just	i
I	i
was	i
looking	c
at	c
her	c
.	c

fortunetly	i
nothing	c
had	c
happend	i
.	c

Every-thing	i
was	c
O.K	c

Just	i
people	c
who	c
was	i
helping	c
and	c
organizating	i
this	c
concert	c
could	c
meet	c
her	c
.	c

Some	c
of	c
them	c
were	c
speaking	c
with	c
her	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
n't	c
this	c
lucky	c
person	c
,	c
but	c
still	c
I	c
'm	c
happy	c
,	c
that	c
I	c
could	c
be	c
thear	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
in	i
tents	i
because	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
is	c
something	c
more	c
exciting	c
and	c
new	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
never	i
stayed	i
in	c
tents	i
in	c
the	c
middle	c
of	c
nowhere	c
,	i
in	c
my	c
life	c
so	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
something	c
more	c
realistic	c
and	c
new	c
.	c

Looking	c
to	i
your	c
letter	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
see	c
many	c
options	c
of	i
activities	c
and	c
I	c
realized	i
that	c
I	c
like	c
most	c
of	c
them	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
Climbing	c
and	c
Painting	c
.	c

Climbing	c
is	c
something	c
new	c
for	c
me	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
not	c
so	c
good	c
on	i
that	i
,	c
however	c
I	i
wish	i
that	c
I	c
can	c
learn	c
about	c
it	c
on	i
the	c
Camp	c
.	c

Painting	c
is	c
something	c
that	c
I	c
love	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
good	c
doing	i
it	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
some	c
doubts	i
about	c
my	c
prize	c
and	c
travel	c
.	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
because	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
wonderful	c
experience	c
last	c
month	c
.	c

There	c
was	c
a	c
concert	c
of	i
a	c
famous	c
band	c
here	c
in	c
my	c
city	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
I	c
went	c
with	c
my	c
friend	c
to	c
the	c
concert	c
with	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
fans	c
.	c

Yes	c
,	c
there	c
is	c
a	c
bus	c
that	c
take	i
you	c
to	c
the	c
concert	c
and	c
bring	i
you	c
back	c
.	c

The	c
concert	c
was	c
going	c
to	c
start	c
at	c
22:00	c
and	c
the	c
bus	c
arrived	c
at	c
my	c
house	c
at	c
18:00	c
.	c

AT	c
20:00	c
,	c
we	c
stopped	c
in	i
a	c
coffee	c
house	c
to	c
eat	c
.	c

The	i
shouted	c
:	c
"	c
20:30	c
you	c
all	c
have	c
to	c
be	c
back	c
because	c
the	c
bus	c
will	c
leave.	c
"	c

Suddenly	c
a	c
man	c
came	c
and	c
started	c
to	c
tell	c
us	c
his	c
adventures	c
.	c

The	c
bus	c
had	c
left	c
about	c
fifteen	c
minutes	c
.	i

The	c
man	c
offered	c
a	i
ride	c
.	c

We	c
accept	i
.	c

You	c
can	i
not	i
imagine	c
how	c
dissapointed	i
I	c
were	i
with	c
my	i
ownself	i
.	c

When	c
we	c
arrived	c
the	c
concert	c
had	c
already	c
began	i
.	c

We	c
answered	c
:	c
"	c
Yes	c
!	c
"	c

By	i
my	i
side	i
the	i
vocal	i
of	i
the	i
Almendegos	i
was	i
and	c
he	c
touched	c
my	c
arm	c
.	c

That	c
was	c
the	c
best	c
night	c
of	c
my	c
life	c
.	c

Kisses	c
,	c

I	c
will	c
give	c
you	c
some	c
information	c
which	c
helps	i
you	c
to	c
know	c
me	c
better	c
.	c

I	c
will	c
be	c
very	c
busy	c
in	c
June	c
so	c
let	c
me	c
tell	c
you	c
some	c
details	c
about	c
my	c
travel	i
.	c

About	i
accommodation	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
tents	c
would	c
be	c
great	c
.	c

And	c
there	c
are	c
few	i
questions	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
.	c

how	c
much	c
money	c
and	c
by	i
cash	c
or	c
by	c
travel	i
cards	i
.	i

Thanks	c
!	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
our	c
meeting	c
.	c

Vasiliy	c
Alekseyev	c
.	c

Last	c
month	c
I	c
enjoyed	c
helping	c
at	c
concert	i
of	c
"	c
Modern	c
Talking	c
''	c
and	c
now	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
share	c
with	c
you	c
about	i
my	c
experience	c
.	c

I	c
came	i
into	c
their	c
room	c
and	c
give	i
hot	c
Cheeseburgers	c
,	c
Coca-Cola	c
and	c
ice-cream	c
to	c
Peter	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
nervous	c
talking	c
with	c
him	c
.	c

I	c
will	c
never	c
forget	c
that	c
summer	c
day	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
my	c
day	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
sure	c
about	c
it	c
.	c

See	c
you	c
.	c

Yours	i
faithfully	i
,	c

Vasiliy	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
:	c

But	c
in	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
there	c
was	c
a	i
another	c
actor	c
.	c

When	c
the	c
show	c
is	i
finished	i
.	i

The	i
note	i
says	i
that	i
your	i
perfect	i
evening	i
out	i
,	i
I	i
thought	i
I	i
could	i
get	i
my	i
money	i
back	i
,	i
with	i
your	i
poor	i
service	i
and	i
all	i
my	i
reasons	i
,	i
But	i
it	i
was	i
not	i
ask	i
for	i
money	i
back	i
.	c

I	c
was	c
really	c
disappointed	c
about	c
your	c
threat	i
and	c
service	c
,	i
I	c
hope	c
I	c
can	c
get	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
and	c
you	c
can	c
improve	c
it	c
.	c

Than	i
you	c
for	c
reading	c
.	i

Today	c
,	c
science	c
and	c
technology	c
help	c
us	c
a	c
lot	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
pass	i
,	c
people	c
have	i
to	c
go	c
and	c
get	c
wood	c
,	c
make	c
a	c
fire	c
and	c
cook	c
,	c
but	c
now	c
people	c
can	c
cook	c
in	c
a	c
microwave	c
and	c
do	c
not	c
have	c
to	c
do	c
all	c
the	c
hard	c
work	c
.	c

e.g.	c
use	i
science	c
to	c
put	c
all	c
the	c
good	c
part	i
of	c
two	c
plants	c
into	c
one	c
plant	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writting	i
to	c
you	c
about	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
disappointed	c
after	c
this	i
show	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
have	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

After	c
your	c
show	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
visit	c
my	c
friends	c
,	c
and	c
because	c
of	c
it	c
,	c
I	c
did	i
n't	i
do	c
it	i
.	c

The	c
woman	c
,	i
who	c
sold	c
a	i
ticket	c
was	c
very	c
roud	i
with	i
me	c
,	c
actually	c
she	c
started	c
swearing	c
at	c
me	c
.	c

During	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
hungry	c
but	c
I	c
hoped	c
to	c
visit	c
restaurant	i
,	c
it	i
's	i
a	c
pity	c
,	c
but	i
restaurant	i
was	c
closed	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
too	c
late	c
.	c

And	c
,	c
I	c
forget	c
to	c
say	c
about	i
actor	i
,	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
enjoy	c
them	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
I	c
hope	c
I	c
will	c
get	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
,	i
it	i
was	c
very	i
disappointing	c
evening	c
out	i
in	c
my	c
life	c
!	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
understand	c
me	c
!	c

your	i
sincerely	c

Ongelina	c

I	c
hoped	i
that	c
it	c
,	i
just	i
could	i
see	i
3	i
people	c
,	c
but	c
it	i
was	c
mistake	i
...	c

We	c
spoke	i
with	i
Pat	c
many	c
times	c
to	c
keep	c
this	c
secret	c
,	c
not	c
to	c
tell	c
anyone	c
.	c

We	c
trusted	c
him	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
forget	c
him	c
.	c

He	c
will	c
be	c
in	c
the	i
prison	c
5	i
years	c
.	c

Dear	c
Jane	c
,	c

The	c
stars	c
and	c
artist	i
are	c
from	c
only	c
six	c
countries	c
,	c
and	c
some	c
concerts	c
take	c
place	c
in	c
small	c
halls	c
.	c

Are	c
there	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
more	c
plays	c
and	c
films	c
next	c
year	c
?	c

I	c
find	c
the	c
reasonably-priced	c
ticket	c
excellent	c
,	c
because	c
there	c
is	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
people	c
who	c
went	i
to	c
see	c
only	c
one	c
or	c
two	c
events	c
,	c
and	c
by	c
paying	c
the	i
all	i
events	i
ticket	c
they	i
might	c
see	c
other	c
events	c
and	c
learn	c
about	c
something	c
they	c
did	c
n't	c
expected	i
to	c
find	c
interesting	c
.	c

Dear	c
John	c
,	c

Here	c
in	c
Brazil	c
the	c
rules	c
at	c
school	c
depends	i
on	c
the	c
school	c
.	c

We	c
were	c
allowed	c
to	c
go	c
out	c
if	c
we	c
did	c
n't	c
want	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
class	c
.	c

But	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
use	i
the	c
uniform	c
and	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
study	c
a	c
lot	c
to	c
pass	c
the	c
exams	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
allowed	c
to	c
do	c
what	c
I	c
want	c
as	c
long	c
as	c
I	c
studie	i
enough	c
to	c
aprove	i
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
my	c
parents	c
let	c
me	c
do	c
what	c
I	c
want	c
,	i
because	c
they	c
trust	c
me	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
not	c
allways	i
easy	c
,	c
but	c
there	c
are	c
rules	c
in	c
every	c
home	c
and	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
respect	c
them	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
,	c

I	c
have	i
come	i
to	c
watch	i
the	c
musical	c
show	c
called	c
'	c
Over	c
The	c
Rainbow	c
'	c
in	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
really	c
disappointed	c
because	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
things	c
were	c
not	c
done	c
.	c

That	c
was	c
very	c
disappointing	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

The	c
musical	c
show	c
was	c
going	i
to	c
start	c
at	c
19.30	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
started	c
t	i
20:15	c
.	c

We	c
have	i
waited	i
for	i
45	i
minutes	i
getting	i
bored	i
for	i
it	i
to	i
start	i
!	c

When	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
buy	c
tickets	c
,	c
they	c
did	c
n't	c
accept	i
the	i
discounts	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
had	c
read	c
that	c
the	i
discounts	c
were	c
available	c
.	c

There	c
was	c
nothing	c
for	c
us	c
to	c
do	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
45	c
minutes	c
later	i
.	c

Now	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
you	c
have	c
seen	c
it	i
was	c
not	c
a	c
perfect	c
evening	c
at	c
all	c
,	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
things	i
written	i
were	c
not	c
done	c
So	i
I	c
am	c
asking	c
to	c
get	c
some	c
of	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

MY	i
daily	c
life	c
.	i

I	c
get	c
up	c
early	c
in	c
the	c
morning	c
,	c
go	c
to	c
school	c
,	c
then	c
come	c
home	c
and	c
do	c
what	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
do	c
.	c

Modern	c
technology	c
is	c
everywhere	c
in	c
my	c
life	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
I	c
get	c
up	c
whenever	c
I	c
want	c
using	c
my	c
watch	c
or	c
clock	c
.	c

TV	c
was	c
black	c
and	c
white	c
at	c
first	c
and	c
there	c
were	c
only	c
two	c
or	c
three	c
channels	c
.	c

Now	c
it	c
's	c
colourful	i
and	c
there	c
are	c
many	c
channels	c
on	c
TV	c
.	c

It	c
knows	c
more	c
than	c
most	c
of	i
the	i
people	c
.	c

You	c
can	c
look	c
for	c
everything	c
you	c
want	c
.	c

You	c
can	c
talk	c
to	c
every	i
people	c
living	c
all	c
around	c
the	c
world	c
.	c

You	c
do	c
n't	c
understand	i
the	c
time	c
passing	c
when	c
you	c
are	c
in	c
that	c
world	c
.	c

You	c
can	c
have	c
information	c
about	c
all	c
the	i
things	c
,	c
go	i
everywhere	c
.	c

Everything	c
is	c
near	c
you	c
.	c

You	c
see	c
,	c
our	c
daily	c
life	c
consists	c
of	c
modern	c
technology	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
just	c
received	c
a	c
letter	c
from	c
you	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
really	c
happy	c
to	c
hear	c
the	c
news	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
the	c
competition	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
something	c
about	c
what	c
you	c
asked	c
me	c
in	c
the	c
letter	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
travel	i
only	i
in	c
July	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
no	c
time	c
except	c
July	i
as	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
postgraduate	c
student	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
very	c
much	c
like	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
not	c
good	c
at	c
swimming	c
but	c
I	c
would	c
very	c
much	c
like	c
to	c
learn	c
how	c
to	c
swim	c
this	c
year	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
photography	c
as	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
photographer	c
in	c
a	c
club	c
while	c
I	c
was	c
in	c
the	i
college	c
.	c

Is	c
n't	c
it	c
cold	c
at	c
night	c
in	c
the	c
Camp	c
California	c
?	c

I	c
like	c
ice	c
cram	i
,	c
sweets	c
and	c
beverage	i
very	c
much	c
especially	i
in	c
the	c
summer	c
.	c

Are	c
these	c
expensive	c
?	c

Do	c
you	c
think	c
shopping	c
is	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
?	c

Well	c
,	c
it	c
might	c
be	c
true	c
but	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
depends	c
on	c
the	c
situation	c
.	c

You	c
usually	c
visit	c
many	c
shops	c
and	c
compare	c
the	c
quality	c
and	c
the	c
price	c
and	c
select	c
the	c
best	c
one	c
which	c
suits	c
to	i
you	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
it	c
usually	c
take	i
much	i
time	c
to	c
get	c
what	i
you	i
exactly	i
want	c
.	c

Because	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
visit	c
many	c
shops	c
and	c
see	c
many	c
thing	i
.	c

If	c
shopping	i
mall	c
is	c
not	c
collected	i
,	c
it	c
is	c
physically	c
hard	c
to	c
get	c
what	c
you	c
want	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
not	c
easy	c
to	c
shop	c
with	c
someone	c
who	c
are	i
not	c
interested	c
in	c
shopping	c
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
as	c
many	c
people	c
think	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
to	c
make	c
complaints	i
for	i
the	c
very	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
I	c
had	c
at	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
found	c
that	c
there	c
were	c
no	c
discounts	c
as	c
it	i
was	i
announced	i
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
.	c

Of	c
course	c
I	c
must	c
tell	c
you	c
that	c
the	c
strongest	i
reason	c
for	c
my	c
going	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
's	c
presence	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
just	i
to	c
find	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
and	c
the	c
friend	c
I	c
had	c
asked	c
to	c
meet	c
me	c
there	c
was	c
not	c
waiting	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

Every	c
day	c
we	c
find	i
out	i
new	c
devices	c
that	c
promise	c
us	i
to	c
satisfy	c
our	c
needs	c
.	c

I	c
usually	c
do	c
n't	c
buy	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
them	c
but	c
I	c
must	c
recognise	i
that	c
some	c
of	c
them	c
are	c
useful	c
.	c

I	c
ca	c
n't	c
remember	c
waking	c
up	c
with	i
the	c
alarm-clock	c
,	c
making	c
a	c
hand-made	c
orange	c
juice	c
or	c
heating	c
water	c
for	c
the	c
coffee	c
.	c

The	c
improvement	i
of	c
electronics	c
and	c
global	c
communications	c
has	c
made	c
it	c
possible	c
to	c
know	c
places	c
,	c
look	c
for	c
information	c
or	c
even	c
keep	c
close	i
contact	c
with	c
friends	c
all	c
over	c
the	c
world	c
.	c

Now	c
,	c
I	c
will	c
never	c
say	i
again	i
that	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
where	c
can	i
I	i
find	c
some	c
information	c
about	c
this	c
or	c
that	c
and	c
when	c
on	c
holidays	i
or	c
every	c
time	c
I	c
make	c
a	c
new	c
friend	c
,	c
I	c
just	c
ask	c
for	c
the	i
email	i
and	i
that	c
's	c
enough	c
to	c
know	c
we	c
will	c
know	c
about	c
each	c
other	c
soon	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
2	c
weeks	c
off	c
in	i
the	c
beginning	c
of	c
the	c
month	c
.	c

Concerning	c
the	c
available	c
activities	c
,	c
firstly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
choose	c
climbing	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
practised	i
it	c
for	c
many	c
years	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
wondering	c
if	c
some	i
special	c
clothes	c
are	c
required	c
and	c
how	c
much	c
pocket	c
money	c
I	c
need	c
for	c
this	c
trip	c
?	c

I	c
thank	c
you	c
in	i
advanced	i
and	c
looking	i
forward	c
to	c
your	c
reply	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
to	c
relate	i
my	c
experience	c
in	i
helping	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
last	c
month	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
that	c
I	c
've	c
never	c
had	c
a	i
such	i
good	c
time	c
in	c
my	c
life	c
!	c

The	c
day	i
one	i
consisted	i
in	i
surrounding	i
the	c
festival	i
's	i
place	i
with	c
fences	c
.	c

The	c
second	c
day	i
objective	c
was	c
to	c
install	c
the	c
scene	i
,	i
with	i
lights	i
,	i
loudspeakers	i
and	i
all	i
stuff	i
.	c

The	c
last	c
day	c
,	c
in	i
fact	i
the	i
concert	i
day	i
was	i
absolutely	c
fantastic	c
.	c

The	c
public	i
was	c
so	c
excited	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
concert	c
that	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
place	c
some	c
bouncer	i
front	i
of	c
the	c
scene	i
,	i
to	c
avoid	i
the	i
people	c
coming	i
on	i
the	i
concert	i
floor	i
.	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
your	i
impressions	i
about	c
this	c
!	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c

It	c
is	c
very	c
good	c
,	c
especially	c
the	c
Sightseeing	i
tour	c
by	c
bus	c
.	c

This	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
because	c
as	c
you	c
know	c
most	c
people	c
of	i
our	c
class	c
are	c
going	c
to	c
work	c
in	c
this	c
sector	c
so	c
it	c
will	i
be	i
very	c
interesting	c
for	c
everybody	c
and	c
also	c
a	c
kind	c
of	c
education	c
.	c

The	c
shopping	c
could	c
be	c
done	c
after	c
the	c
river	c
trip	c
to	c
Greenwich	c
but	c
only	c
if	c
we	c
have	c
enough	c
time	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
will	c
agree	c
with	c
our	c
suggestion	c
and	c
if	c
you	c
have	c
any	c
further	c
questions	c
do	c
not	c
hesistate	i
to	c
contact	c
me	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
quite	c
difficult	c
to	c
say	c
,	c
but	c
of	c
course	c
there	c
will	c
be	c
a	i
change	i
.	c

For	c
example	c
if	i
you	c
look	c
back	c
into	i
the	c
forties	c
and	c
compare	c
the	i
home	i
with	i
nowadays	c
you	i
can	c
see	c
that	c
it	i
has	i
become	c
more	c
modern	c
,	c
especially	c
the	c
facilities	i
in	c
the	c
kitchen	c
and	c
in	c
the	c
livingroom	i
.	c

in	i
the	c
future	c
it	c
could	i
be	i
that	c
you	c
do	i
n't	i
have	c
to	c
prepare	c
your	c
breakfast	c
by	i
your	i
own	i
,	c
perhaps	c
you	c
just	i
have	i
to	c
press	c
a	c
button	c
when	c
your	c
alarm	c
clock	c
has	c
gone	c
.	i

In	c
addition	c
to	c
this	c
you	i
may	c
have	c
some	c
roboters	i
bringing	c
the	c
newspaper	c
at	i
the	c
table	c
,	c
tidying	c
up	c
the	c
house	c
,	c
doing	i
the	c
shopping	c
and	i
maybe	i
they	c
are	i
also	i
your	c
living	i
patners	i
.	c

The	c
livingroom	i
wo	c
n't	c
get	i
any	c
big	c
changes	c
although	i
the	i
televisions	c
,	c
stereos	c
and	c
videos	c
will	c
become	c
more	c
modern	c
and	c
perhaps	c
more	c
difficult	i
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs.	c
Ryan	c

I	c
am	c
really	c
appreciated	i
to	c
hear	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
the	c
competition	c
-	c
two	c
weeks	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
in	c
the	c
U.S.A.	c
I	c
am	c
writing	c
this	c
letter	c
to	c
inform	i
you	c
more	c
information	c
about	c
myself	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
only	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
I	c
will	c
have	c
a	c
summer	c
holiday	c
for	c
2	c
months	c
at	c
that	c
time	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
the	i
accommodation	i
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
in	c
tents	c
because	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
nice	c
to	c
spend	c
the	c
time	c
living	c
in	c
tents	c
with	c
a	c
nice	c
environment	c
and	c
fresh	c
air	c
.	c

Swimming	c
is	c
quite	c
nice	i
activity	i
to	c
relax	c
and	c
work	c
out	c
.	c

Anyway	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
that	i
how	c
many	c
people	c
are	c
joining	i
at	i
this	c
Camp	c
.	c

Could	c
you	c
please	c
tell	c
me	c
about	c
the	c
clothes	c
I	c
should	c
take	c
?	c

Dear	c
Kim	c

Thanks	c
for	c
your	c
last	c
letter	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
that	c
you	c
can	c
get	c
on	c
well	c
with	c
your	c
roommate	c
.	c

I	c
and	c
my	c
friend	c
-	i
Emma	c
,	i
we	i
helped	c
to	c
paint	c
the	c
scence	i
of	i
the	i
background	i
on	c
the	c
stage	c
.	c

I	c
felt	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
great	c
time	c
in	c
my	c
life	c
.	c

Best	c
wishes	c

The	c
tickets	c
also	c
caused	c
a	c
problem	c
.	c

Moreover	c
the	i
testament	i
was	c
till	i
under	c
the	i
construction	c
so	c
that	c
we	c
could	c
n't	c
use	c
it	c
when	c
we	c
were	c
extlemely	i
hungry	c
.	c

Finally	i
,	i
I	i
wonder	i
why	i
you	i
did	i
n't	i
ask	i
for	i
the	i
money	i
back	i
if	i
you	i
have	i
guaranteed	i
the	i
perfect	i
evening	i
.	i

I	c
am	c
therefore	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
to	c
ask	c
for	c
the	c
money	c
back	c
as	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
get	c
any	c
advantages	c
or	c
services	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Technology	c
has	c
been	c
developed	i
extremely	c
fast	c
these	c
days	c
and	c
as	c
it	c
is	c
still	c
going	c
on	c
,	c
it	c
ca	c
n't	c
help	c
affecting	c
our	c
lives	c
.	c

People	c
have	c
invented	c
such	c
things	c
like	i
TV	c
,	c
radio	c
,	c
telephones	c
and	c
so	c
on	c
which	c
made	c
us	c
enable	i
to	c
hear	c
the	c
news	c
quickly	c
and	c
stay	c
in	c
touch	c
with	c
people	c
easily	c
.	c

There	c
are	c
also	c
changes	c
in	c
biological	c
areas	c
.	c

Nearly	i
almost	i
of	i
the	i
disease	i
have	i
been	i
found	i
the	i
way	i
to	i
cure	i
except	c
only	i
a	c
few	c
like	c
AIDS	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
pleasantly	c
surprised	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
answer	c
your	c
questions	c
.	c

As	c
I	c
am	c
doing	c
my	c
A-levels	i
exams	c
at	c
the	c
moment	c
and	c
they	c
continue	c
until	c
the	c
30th	c
of	c
June	c
and	c
my	c
further	c
studies	c
start	c
in	c
August	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
only	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
.	c

It	c
will	c
give	c
me	c
an	i
adventure	i
feeling	i
and	c
I	c
have	c
always	c
prefered	i
tents	c
to	c
log	c
cabins	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
never	c
tried	c
out	i
climbing	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
have	c
always	c
wished	i
to	c
do	c
it	c
one	c
day	c
.	c

Would	c
you	c
be	c
kind	c
enough	c
to	c
tell	c
me	c
which	i
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
should	c
bring	c
with	c
me	c
?	c

Hi	c
,	c
how	c
are	c
you	c
?	c

My	c
job	c
was	c
actually	c
to	c
listen	c
to	c
Tim	c
and	c
do	c
whatever	c
he	c
said	c
.	c

Tim	c
was	c
in	c
charge	c
of	c
organising	c
this	c
concert	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
never	c
been	c
behind	c
the	c
stage	c
before	c
and	c
you	c
know	c
the	c
rooms	c
,	c
in	c
which	c
singers	c
dress	c
and	c
make-up	i
,	c
are	c
actually	c
small	c
.	c

And	c
I	c
managed	c
to	c
speak	c
to	c
Ricky	c
Martin	c
out	i
of	i
stage	i
.	c

O.K.	c
,	c
I	c
actually	c
asked	c
him	c
only	c
:	c
'	c
How	c
are	c
you	c
?	c
'	c
and	c
he	c
gave	c
me	c
his	c
signature	i
.	c

He	c
was	c
fantastic	c
,	i
you	i
know	c
that	c
he	c
is	c
my	c
favourite	c
singer	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
this	c
was	c
my	c
best	c
job	c
as	c
a	c
student	c
in	c
Cambridge	c
.	c

Probably	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
so	c
nice	c
to	c
do	c
jobs	c
which	c
you	c
were	c
told	c
to	c
do	c
,	c
but	c
you	c
see	i
many	c
stars	c
out	i
of	i
stage	i
.	c

Beside	c
this	c
,	c
I	c
earned	c
some	c
money	c
,	i
not	c
a	c
lot	c
but	c
enough	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

Well	c
I	c
'll	c
have	c
to	c
close	c
now	c
.	c

Give	c
my	c
regards	c
to	c
your	c
parents	c
.	c

Looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

With	c
love	c

Dear	c
Sirs	c
,	c

On	c
Saturday	c
,	c
June	c
5th	c
,	c
2000	c
my	c
wife	c
and	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
spend	i
a	c
nice	c
and	c
enjoyable	c
evening	c
and	c
decided	c
to	c
go	c
and	c
see	c
the	c
musical	c
.	c

So	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
arrest	i
for	c
a	c
while	c
and	c
had	c
a	c
drink	c
.	c

yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

Heine	c
Bitz	c

Fashion	c
will	c
always	c
be	c
an	c
interesting	c
and	c
important	c
subject	c
for	c
all	c
ages	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
the	c
material	c
of	c
which	c
clothes	c
are	c
made	c
has	i
a	i
wide	c
range	i
.	c

In	c
100	c
years	c
most	c
of	i
the	i
clothes	c
are	i
made	c
from	c
syntetical	i
material	c
.	c

Light	c
and	c
bright	c
colours	c
will	c
be	c
very	c
common	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
the	c
style	c
of	c
the	c
clothes	c
are	i
going	c
to	c
be	c
more	c
crazy	c
and	c
individuell	i
but	c
there	c
will	c
be	i
still	i
enumerous	i
clothes	c
for	c
the	i
solid	i
people	c
.	c

Dear	c
Jane	c
Clark	c
,	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
you	c
to	c
know	c
that	c
the	c
whole	c
organization	c
was	c
nearly	i
excellent	c
.	c

The	c
idea	c
of	c
making	c
the	c
festival	c
"	c
international	c
"	c
was	c
very	c
good	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
find	c
the	c
opportunity	c
to	c
watch	c
the	i
artists	c
from	c
different	c
countries	c
,	c
but	c
there	c
could	c
have	c
been	c
stars	c
from	c
more	c
than	c
6	c
countries	c
.	c

The	c
dance	c
shows	c
made	i
sight	i
for	c
our	c
sour	i
eyes	c
,	i
they	c
were	c
really	c
fascinating	c
.	c

I	c
learned	c
so	c
many	c
things	c
about	c
the	c
writers	c
and	c
their	c
ideas	c
,	c
their	i
life	i
styles	i
by	i
talking	c
to	c
them	c
.	c

Beyond	i
all	c
these	i
,	c
the	c
application	i
of	c
joining	c
all	i
activities	i
by	i
one	c
nice-priced	i
ticket	c
was	c
excellent	c
;	i
because	c
it	c
saved	c
you	c
from	c
buying	i
one	c
ticket	c
for	c
each	c
activity	c
.	c

Next	c
year	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
you	c
should	c
increase	c
the	c
number	c
of	c
shows	c
,	c
concerts	c
and	c
others	i
,	c
also	i
the	c
time	c
spent	c
at	c
the	c
festival	c
(	c
for	c
example	c
:	c
at	c
least	c
5	c
days	c
)	c
,	c
then	c
everything	c
would	c
be	c
perfect	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
making	i
a	c
great	c
festival	c
which	c
made	c
all	c
the	c
art	i
activities	c
come	c
together	c
.	c

Yours	c
Sincerely	i
,	c

It	c
's	c
the	c
same	c
here	c
.	c

I	c
've	c
got	c
too	i
many	i
exams	c
nowadays	i
,	c
but	c
that	c
's	c
all	c
.	c

The	c
more	c
you	c
obey	c
the	c
rules	c
,	c
the	c
better	c
person	c
you	c
are	c
!	c

Do	c
we	c
become	c
the	c
"	c
perfect	c
one	c
"	c
then	c
?	c

Love	c
,	c

I	c
can	c
travel	c
only	c
in	c
july	i
because	c
is	i
the	c
only	c
month	c
of	i
this	c
year	c
that	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
available	c
because	i
I	c
finish	c
school	c
in	c
june	i
so	i
I	c
will	c
be	c
very	c
busy	c
and	i
in	c
August	c
I	c
start	c
to	c
study	c
at	c
the	i
University	c
,	c
so	c
july	i
is	c
the	c
best	c
month	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
travel	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
easy	c
going	c
and	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
satisfied	c
wherever	c
.	i

I	c
play	i
tennis	c
since	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
child	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
some	c
competitions	c
in	c
my	c
town	c
so	c
I	c
think	c
I	c
play	c
very	c
well	c
.	c

-	c
Climbing	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
climbed	c
in	c
my	c
life	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
dream	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
do	c
that	c
.	c

I	c
wonder	i
to	c
know	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
wear	c
because	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
how	c
the	c
weather	c
is	c
in	c
U.S.A.	i
Also	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
bring	c
to	i
the	c
trip	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hear	i
from	c
you	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c

Hello	c
Kim	c
:	c

Sorry	c
but	i
I	c
have	c
n't	c
written	c
you	i
because	c
I	c
've	c
been	c
very	c
busy	c
.	c

Last	c
month	c
I	c
helped	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
,	i
it	i
was	c
marvellous	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
a	c
friend	c
and	c
she	c
knows	c
that	c
I	c
speak	c
English	c
so	i
she	c
offered	c
to	i
me	c
work	c
with	c
an	c
English	c
singer	c
so	i
I	c
said	i
"	i
yes	i
,	i
of	c
course	c
"	c
.	c

You	c
know	c
,	c
he	c
is	c
my	c
favourite	c
singer	c
.	c

I	c
understood	c
everything	c
he	c
said	c
and	c
Sting	c
said	c
to	c
me	c
that	c
I	c
spoken	i
very	i
well	i
English	i
.	c

The	c
best	c
thing	c
was	c
I	c
spoke	c
in	c
English	c
because	i
I	i
was	i
forgetting	i
it	i
and	c
I	c
met	c
my	c
favourite	c
singer	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
my	c
friend	c
call	i
me	c
again	c
to	c
work	c
because	i
I	c
had	c
a	c
wonderful	c
time	c
and	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
great	c
and	c
unforgettable	c
experience	c
.	c

Lots	c
of	c
Love	c

This	c
was	c
very	c
disappointing	c
and	c
I	c
believe	c
that	c
all	c
the	c
people	c
there	c
,	i
were	c
angry	c
.	c

Also	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
and	c
I	c
do	c
not	c
know	c
why	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
read	c
the	c
advertisement	c
,	c
it	c
said	c
that	c
the	c
restaurand	i
would	c
be	c
opened	i
.	c

Lastly	c
,	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
that	c
I	c
had	i
not	c
a	i
perfect	c
evening	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
be	c
grateful	c
if	c
you	c
could	i
send	c
me	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
your	c
answer	i
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
not	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

Pat	c
was	c
my	c
best	c
friend	c
.	c

I	c
told	c
her	c
all	c
my	c
problems	c
and	c
I	c
could	c
rely	c
on	c
her	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
heard	c
it	i
,	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
my	c
room	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
crying	c
.	c

I	c
called	c
Pat	c
to	c
come	c
to	c
my	c
house	c
because	c
I	c
was	c
not	c
very	c
good	i
and	c
to	i
tell	c
her	c
what	c
had	c
happened	c
.	c

Few	i
minutes	c
later	c
Pat	c
came	c
to	c
my	c
house	c
and	c
I	c
told	c
her	c
that	c
my	c
parents	c
are	i
going	c
to	c
divorce	c
.	c

Pat	c
did	c
not	c
believe	c
me	c
and	c
she	c
started	i
to	i
ask	i
why	c
.	c

She	c
helped	c
me	c
to	c
forget	c
it	c
for	c
a	c
few	c
minutes	c
,	c
she	c
made	c
me	c
to	i
laugh	i
and	c
the	i
she	c
left	c
.	c

The	c
other	i
morning	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
school	c
and	c
all	c
the	c
students	c
came	c
next	i
to	c
me	c
and	c
told	c
me	c
not	c
to	c
be	c
mad	i
because	c
of	c
my	c
parents	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr.	c
Robertson	c
,	c

We	c
are	c
very	c
grateful	c
to	c
you	c
for	c
these	c
three	c
days	c
that	c
we	c
are	c
going	c
to	c
spend	c
in	c
the	c
English	c
capital	c
,	c
especially	c
because	c
you	c
planned	i
very	c
interesting	c
and	c
different	c
kinds	c
of	c
things	c
to	i
do	i
for	i
all	i
us	i
.	c

It	c
is	c
a	c
very	c
good	c
chance	c
to	c
join	i
this	c
exhibition	c
to	c
see	c
all	c
the	c
new	c
fashion	i
tendences	i
,	c
the	c
latest	c
hairstyles	c
and	c
make	i
up	i
as	c
all	c
we	i
came	i
from	c
many	c
different	c
countries	c
and	c
have	i
not	i
the	c
same	c
customs	c
either	i
.	c

Well	c
,	c
that	c
is	c
all	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
.	c

We	c
do	c
hope	c
you	c
like	c
our	c
suggestion	c
and	c
we	c
can	c
have	i
an	i
agreement	i
to	c
join	i
the	c
fashion	c
exhibition	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerelly	i
,	c

This	c
is	c
supposed	c
to	c
make	c
them	c
happier	c
...	c

So	c
they	c
need	c
to	c
become	c
famous	c
to	c
be	c
what	c
they	c
want	c
and	c
if	c
the	c
people	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
them	c
,	c
they	c
are	c
forgotten	c
,	c
they	c
die	c
...	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
for	c
me	c
is	i
very	c
difficult	c
which	i
group	c
has	i
the	i
reason	i
but	c
,	c
by	i
the	c
moment	c
,	c
we	c
should	c
try	c
to	c
respect	c
each	c
other	c
and	c
go	i
in	i
the	i
other	i
's	i
soul	i
to	i
feel	i
like	i
them	i
in	i
those	i
moments	i
we	i
cannot	i
understand	i
them	i
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

This	c
is	c
because	c
I	c
had	c
been	c
waiting	c
to	c
enjoy	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
's	c
performance	c
since	c
I	c
saw	c
him	c
the	c
first	c
time	c
on	c
television	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
despite	c
of	i
your	c
advertisement	i
of	i
the	c
possibility	c
of	c
discounts	c
,	c
when	c
I	c
showed	c
my	c
student	c
identity	c
card	c
to	c
one	c
of	c
your	c
employes	i
she	c
angrily	c
told	c
me	c
that	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
pay	c
the	c
whole	i
prize	i
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
not	c
only	c
had	c
the	c
actor	c
been	c
changed	c
but	c
also	c
the	c
musical	i
show	c
started	c
forty	i
five	i
minutes	c
late	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
at	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
the	c
night	c
we	c
felt	c
a	c
bit	c
hungry	c
but	c
we	c
could	c
n't	c
eat	c
until	c
arriving	i
home	c
due	c
to	c
your	c
restaurant	i
new	c
cooker	i
illness	i
.	c

The	c
truth	c
is	c
the	c
night	c
was	c
n't	c
my	c
perfect	c
night	c
out	c
as	c
you	c
have	i
announced	i
so	c
I	c
would	c
appreciate	c
if	i
you	c
could	c
give	c
my	i
money	c
back	c
.	c

I	c
wait	c
to	c
receiving	i
a	c
prompt	c
answer	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

At	c
first	c
I	c
felt	c
really	c
annoyed	c
and	c
disappointed	c
so	c
I	c
run	i
to	c
my	c
brother	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
explain	i
him	c
what	c
I	c
had	c
seen	c
.	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
this	c
letter	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
all	c
the	c
necessary	c
details	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
you	c
have	c
asked	c
me	c
when	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
.	c

Actually	c
,	c
I	c
could	c
only	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
,	c
when	c
I	c
am	i
having	i
my	c
school	c
vacations	i
and	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
totally	c
free	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
have	c
asked	c
me	c
about	c
the	c
accommodation	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
be	c
grateful	c
if	c
I	c
could	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
-	c
as	c
it	c
seems	c
to	c
be	c
more	c
practical	c
and	c
comfortable	c
.	c

Among	i
the	c
activities	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
choose	c
painting	c
-	c
which	c
I	c
am	c
keen	c
on	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
done	c
several	c
courses	c
-	c
,and	i
Photography	c
-	c
from	i
which	c
I	c
know	c
just	c
the	c
basical	i
skills	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
if	c
I	c
should	c
take	c
winter-clothes	i
,	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
be	c
grateful	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
tell	c
me	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
is	c
necessary	c
for	c
the	c
trip	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

With	c
the	c
increasing	i
of	i
violence	c
,	c
more	c
and	c
more	c
people	c
are	c
leaving	c
the	c
streets	c
to	c
spend	c
their	c
free	c
time	c
shopping	c
-	c
usually	c
in	c
shopping	c
centres	c
.	c

But	c
it	c
can	c
also	c
be	c
dangerous	c
.	c

Besides	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
confirmed	c
by	c
scientists	c
that	c
consumism	i
may	c
develop	c
to	i
a	c
compulsion	c
.	c

After	c
all	c
that	c
we	i
can	c
notice	i
that	c
shopping	c
can	c
be	c
a	c
good	c
option	i
as	c
long	c
as	c
we	c
can	c
choose	c
other	c
enjoyable	c
activities	c
for	c
our	c
free	c
time	c
.	c

Last	c
week	c
I	c
stayed	i
in	i
London	c
for	c
holidays	i
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
see	i
one	c
of	c
my	c
favourite	c
actors	c
,	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
and	c
it	c
was	c
very	c
disappointing	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
see	c
a	c
diferent	i
actor	c
instead	c
of	c
him	c
in	c
spite	c
of	c
his	c
name	c
was	i
writen	i
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
show	c
I	c
also	c
read	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
going	c
to	c
begin	c
at	c
half	c
past	c
seven	c
p.m.	c
but	c
,	c
in	i
fact	i
,	c
it	c
began	c
at	c
eight	c
fifteen	c
.	c

In	c
spite	c
of	c
it	c
was	i
said	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
.	i

Another	c
disappointing	c
thing	c
I	c
found	c
was	c
that	c
the	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
the	c
cooker	i
has	i
had	c
an	c
accident	c
with	c
hot	c
water	c
when	c
he	c
was	c
boiling	c
some	c
vegetables	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

Last	c
summer	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
spending	c
my	c
holidays	c
in	c
a	c
little	c
village	c
in	i
the	c
southern	c
cost	i
of	c
Spain	c
with	c
my	c
friend	c
Pat	c
.	c

At	i
it	c
was	c
so	c
beautiful	c
,	c
we	c
decided	c
to	c
come	i
back	c
to	c
the	c
beach	c
at	c
night	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
moon	c
,	c
the	c
see	i
and	c
the	c
stars	c
.	c

When	c
we	c
arrived	c
at	c
the	c
beach	c
,	c
we	c
saw	c
a	c
suspicious	c
light	c
and	c
two	c
persons	i
doing	c
something	c
we	c
could	c
n't	c
see	c
very	c
well	c
.	c

As	c
it	c
seemed	c
dangerous	c
we	c
agreed	c
that	c
we	c
should	c
n't	c
tell	i
it	i
to	i
anybody	i
.	c

It	c
was	c
our	c
secret	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
Pat	c
explained	i
the	c
story	c
to	c
a	c
friend	c
of	c
us	i
and	c
I	i
do	c
n't	c
know	c
how	c
,	c
but	c
the	c
robbers	c
knew	c
that	c
we	c
had	c
seen	c
all	c
they	c
had	c
been	c
doing	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
writting	i
this	c
letter	c
to	c
inform	c
you	c
about	c
the	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
I	c
had	c
when	c
I	c
visited	c
the	c
Circle	c
theatre	i
.	c

Secondly	c
the	c
play	c
did	c
n't	c
start	c
at	c
19:30	c
as	c
we	c
were	c
being	i
told	i
but	c
it	c
started	c
with	i
a	c
delay	c
of	c
45	c
minutes	c
.	c

Finally	c
there	c
were	c
no	c
discounts	c
available	c
in	i
the	c
tickets	c
.	c

All	c
the	c
above	c
made	c
my	c
night	c
terribly	c
disappointing	c
and	c
I	c
must	c
say	c
that	c
the	c
advertisement	c
is	c
nothing	c
but	c
a	c
business	c
fraud	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
'm	c
in	c
the	c
unpleasant	c
position	c
to	i
ask	i
my	i
money	c
back	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
your	c
reply	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Technology	c
is	c
an	c
essential	c
part	c
in	i
people	c
's	c
life	i
.	c

It	c
's	c
something	c
absoletuly	i
necessary	c
for	c
every	c
action	c
people	c
does	i
It	i
effects	i
us	c
both	c
positive	i
and	c
negative	i
.	c

It	c
's	c
a	c
part	c
of	c
our	c
lifes	i
.	c

Firstly	c
technology	c
has	c
created	c
a	c
bond	c
between	c
myself	c
and	c
my	c
computer	c
.	c

Also	c
the	c
need	c
of	i
doing	i
simple	c
things	c
as	c
a	c
family	c
is	c
no	c
longer	c
the	i
case	i
.	c

In	c
addition	i
technology	i
has	c
made	c
my	c
life	c
easier	c
but	c
it	c
's	c
also	c
an	c
intrude	i
in	c
my	c
life	c
crating	i
a	c
distance	c
between	c
myself	c
and	c
my	c
family	c
.	c

So	c
we	c
suggest	c
to	i
put	i
it	i
this	c
way	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
14	c
,	i
in	c
the	c
morning	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
Science	c
Museum	c
and	c
instead	i
of	c
shopping	c
,	c
we	c
could	c
attend	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
show	i
,	c
because	c
will	i

up	i

and	c

and	c
as	c
you	c
know	c
us	i
,	c
we	c
love	c
all	c
those	c
topics	c
,	c
and	c
it	c
's	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
while	c
we	c
are	c
London	i
.	c

IT	c
WAS	c
DANGEROUS	c
,	c
BUT	c
I	c
KNEW	c
I	c
HAD	c
TO	c
DO	c
IT	c
.	c

So	c
suddenly	c
,	c
a	c
week	c
later	c
I	c
found	c
me	i
a	c
job	c
as	c
an	c
au	c
pair	c
,	c
taking	c
care	c
of	c
two	c
little	c
girls	c
that	c
only	c
spoke	c
french	i
at	c
that	c
moment	i
.	c

It	c
took	c
me	c
three	c
months	c
to	c
overcame	i
the	c
languages	i
and	c
after	i
this	c
time	c
the	c
whole	c
familly	i
falled	i
in	c
love	c
with	c
me	c
,	c
that	i
when	c
they	c
decided	c
to	c
move	c
to	c
London	c
,	c
they	c
invited	c
me	c
and	c
now	c
we	c
all	c
live	c
here	c
and	c
I	c
feel	c
like	c
part	c
of	c
the	c
familly	i
,	c
eventhough	i
It	i
was	c
very	c
hard	c
at	c
the	c
beggining	i
.	c

The	i
last	i
Monday	c
,	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
with	c
two	c
friends	c
.	c

We	c
arrived	c
on	c
time	c
but	c
the	c
musical	i
show	c
was	c
delayed	c
untill	i
half-pass	i
eight	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
we	c
had	i
n't	i
any	c
disscount	i
for	c
beeing	i
students	c
.	c

We	c
could	c
n't	c
have	c
a	c
drink	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
it	i
would	c
be	c
grateful	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
answer	c
me	c
soon	c
.	c

Our	c
lives	c
are	c
changing	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
child	c
I	c
had	c
different	c
entertainments	i
that	i
the	i
actually	i
children	c
had	i
n't	i
.	c

We	c
had	c
n't	c
so	c
many	c
machines	c
than	i
they	c
have	c
.	c

The	c
technology	c
is	c
growing	c
and	c
growing	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
have	c
a	c
computer	c
you	c
will	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
have	c
all	c
the	c
information	c
that	c
you	c
want	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
very	c
important	c
but	c
some	i
times	i
it	c
is	c
a	c
wrong	i
thing	c
because	c
the	c
children	c
can	c
see	c
it	c
too	c
.	c

Moreover	c
you	c
can	c
change	c
the	c
TV	c
programme	c
without	c
getting	c
up	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
the	i
science	c
is	c
changing	c
.	c

Actually	c
,	c
we	c
can	c
cure	c
illness	i
which	c
were	c
very	i
dangerous	i
before	i
.	c

The	c
new	c
technology	c
is	c
changing	c
our	c
lives	c
.	c

Dear	c
sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

But	c
your	c
starrings	i
were	c
not	c
.	i

I	c
bought	c
a	c
ticket	c
for	c
the	c
19.30	c
round	i
and	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
very	c
very	c
late	c
.	c

And	c
finally	c
,	c
your	c
restaurant	c
was	c
not	c
available	i
after	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

And	c
because	c
of	c
this	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
for	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

My	c
telephone	c
number	c
is	c
123-4567	c
.	c

Yours	c

Modern	c
technology	c
has	c
been	c
growing	i
rapidly	c
and	c
it	c
has	c
effected	i
me	c
a	c
lot	c
.	c

Indeed	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
save	c
more	c
money	c
for	i
upgrading	i
my	c
personal	c
computer	c
.	c

And	c
I	c
can	c
send	c
e-mail	c
to	c
my	c
friends	c
via	c
the	c
Internet	c
fastly	i
and	c
cheaply	c
prepared	i
to	c
the	c
old-style	c
mail-services	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
arrived	c
at	c
about	c
19:20	c
because	c
advertisement	i
said	c
that	c
performance	c
begins	c
at	c
19:30	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
till	c
about	c
20:15	c
that	c
the	c
begin	i
of	i
the	i
show	i
and	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
wait	c
entire	i
hour	c
which	i
was	c
not	c
very	c
amazing	i
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
have	i
a	c
discount	c
but	c
there	c
were	c
no	c
discounts	c
,	c
although	c
the	c
advertisement	c
said	c
there	c
are	c
.	c

As	c
things	c
went	c
that	c
way	c
,	c
I	c
want	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

I	c
shall	c
have	c
a	c
look	c
into	i
the	c
place	c
I	c
believe	c
no	c
one	c
can	c
avoid	c
-	c
the	c
kitchen	c
.	c

How	c
much	c
effort	c
and	c
time	c
it	c
took	c
about	c
two	c
decades	c
go	i
to	c
chop	c
vegetables	c
or	c
prepare	c
coffee	c
or	c
how	c
hard	c
it	c
was	c
to	c
deal	c
with	c
fridges	c
!	c

But	c
today	c
the	c
mixer	c
or	c
some	c
more	c
complicated	c
kitchen-device	c
will	c
chop	c
and	c
mix	c
anything	c
for	c
you	c
from	c
fruits	c
to	c
meat	c
,	c
and	c
modern	c
coffee	c
machines	c
can	c
make	i
even	i
cappuccino	i
or	c
whatever	c
you	c
want	c
on	c
their	c
own	c
.	c

Personally	c
,	c
my	c
life	c
became	c
much	c
faster	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
much	c
more	c
time	c
for	c
many	c
other	c
things	c
during	c
the	c
day	c
thanks	c
to	c
devices	i
modern	c
technology	c
offers	c
us	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr.	c
Robertson	c
,	c

Firstly	c
,	c
we	c
are	c
please	i
and	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
arrangement	i
to	c
taking	i
us	c
to	c
London	c
for	c
3	c
days	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
some	c
students	c
have	c
seen	c
an	c
advertisements	i
for	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
and	c
we	c
all	i
like	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
to	c
visit	c
because	i
it	c
is	c
shown	i
only	c
twice	c
a	c
year	c
and	c
the	i
entrance	c
is	c
free	c
for	c
students	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
most	c
of	c
us	c
are	c
designers	c
so	c
this	c
might	c
help	c
to	c
up-dated	i
their	i
knowledge	c
as	c
well	c
.	c

I	c
remember	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
in	c
secondary	c
school	c
.	c

At	c
that	c
time	c
,	c
my	c
friends	c
and	c
I	c
was	i
so	c
daring	c
and	c
full	c
of	c
energy	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
succeed	i
in	c
doing	c
that	c
.	c

I	c
took	c
it	c
to	c
copy	c
and	c
returned	c
it	c
back	i
without	c
anyone	c
saw	i
me	c
.	c

That	c
was	c
the	c
most	c
scarely	i
and	c
daring	c
thing	c
that	c
I	c
did	c
in	c
my	c
childhood	c
.	c

During	c
my	c
last	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
,	c
I	c
was	i
visiting	i
your	c
theatre	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
see	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
"	c
.	c

You	c
wrote	c
some	c
things	c
in	c
your	c
advertisement	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
disappointed	c
that	c
was	i
n't	i
true	c
.	c

First	c
you	c
have	c
written	c
that	c
the	c
starring	i
were	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
,	c
but	c
the	c
real	i
actors	c
were	c
different	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
disappointing	i
for	c
me	c
,	c
because	c
this	i
actors	c
were	c
recommended	c
by	c
my	c
friend	c
,	c
because	c
he	c
knows	c
Danny	c
and	c
Tina	c
.	c

You	c
have	c
also	c
written	c
in	c
your	c
advertisement	c
that	c
it	c
would	c
started	i
at	c
half	c
past	c
seven	c
but	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
!	c

It	i
would	c
n't	c
be	i
mind	i
if	c
the	c
restaurant	c
had	c
pressed	i
in	i
order	i
to	c
eat	c
or	c
drink	c
something	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
,	c
and	c
it	i
had	i
n't	i
also	i
opened	i
after	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
because	c
the	c
waitress	c
had	c
to	c
clean	c
up	i
the	c
theatre	c
room	i
.	c

Over	i
these	i
the	i
tickets	i
were	i
not	i
discount	i
available	c
as	c
you	c
have	i
written	c
in	i
your	c
advertisement	c
.	c

So	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
a	c
perfect	c
evening	c
for	c
me	c
and	c
I	i
think	i
about	i
it	i
,	c
if	c
I	c
can	c
have	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

If	c
it	c
's	c
possible	c
,	c
please	c
write	c
back	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
and	c
so	c
his	c
hole	i
schoole	i
knew	c
from	i
Sara	c
's	c
experience	c
.	c

Sara	c
was	c
a	c
very	c
good	c
puple	i
.	c

She	c
had	c
to	c
buy	c
a	c
lottery-ticket	i
and	c
other	c
things	c
for	c
her	c
.	c

She	c
spent	c
this	i
only	i
for	i
a	c
magazin	i
.	c

Sara	c
was	c
out	c
of	c
breath	c
and	c
after	c
she	i
had	i
told	i
her	c
mother	c
,	i
she	c
had	c
n't	c
bought	c
the	c
ticket	c
.	c

Sara	c
could	c
n't	c
understand	c
the	c
fact	c
,	i
that	c
she	c
did	c
n't	c
do	c
the	c
right	c
thing	c
.	c

She	c
had	c
earn	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
money	c
,	c
so	c
she	c
would	c
be	c
more	c
careful	c
with	i
doing	c
things	c
.	i

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
to	c
thank	c
for	i
so	i
good	c
organisation	c
of	c
International	i
Arts	c
Festival	c
,	c
where	c
I	i
'd	i
spent	i
two	c
exellent	i
days	c
recently	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
providing	c
such	c
festivals	c
could	c
help	c
people	c
to	c
be	c
in	i
the	c
centre	c
of	c
cultural	c
life	c
of	c
the	c
world	c
and	c
to	c
have	c
enough	c
information	c
about	c
the	i
new	c
art	i
styles	c

But	c
I	c
hope	c
that	c
next	c
year	c
visitores	i
of	i
festival	i
would	i
be	i
able	c
to	c
introduce	i
with	i
more	c
art	c
groups	c
from	c
all	c
over	c
the	c
world	c
.	c

Also	c
,	c
if	c
I	c
were	c
you	c
I	c
would	c
make	c
your	c
concert	c
halls	c
a	c
bit	c
larger	c
,	c
because	c
of	i
too	i
many	c
people	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
spend	c
their	c
holidays	c
with	c
their	c
families	c
on	i
your	c
festival	c
next	c
year	c

Earn	c
yourself	i
.	c

Of	c
course	c
,	c
the	c
easiest	c
way	c
to	c
have	i
them	i
is	c
to	c
ask	c
your	c
parents	c
for	c
help	c
,	c
but	c
a	c
great	c
number	c
of	c
young	c
persons	i
want	c
to	c
be	c
independent	c
.	c

So	c
thy	i
need	c
to	c
get	c
a	c
job	c
that	i
is	c
very	c
difficult	c
when	c
you	c
have	c
n't	c
any	i
special	c
education	c
and	c
experience	c
yet	c
.	c

Other	c
students	c
work	c
as	c
house	c
or	c
office	c
managers	c
,	c
make	i
promontion	i
of	i
different	c
goods	c
or	c
even	c
as	i
a	i
bouncer	i
.	c

Naturally	c
,	c
it	c
's	c
easier	c
to	c
get	c
a	c
job	c
then	i
you	c
were	i
good	c
in	i
foreign	c
languagers	i
or	c
computers	c
.	c

Sometimes	c
small	c
groups	c
of	c
students	c
organized	i
their	c
own	c
small	c
business	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
they	c
can	c
design	c
furniture	c
or	c
clothes	c
,	c
make	i
web-sites	i
and	c
so	c
on	c
.	c

In	i
two	i
words	i
,	c
if	c
the	i
young	c
man	c
want	i
to	c
earn	c
a	c
bit	c
of	c
money	c
by	i
his	i
own	i
hands	i
,	c
the	i
luck	c
and	c
success	c
will	c
find	c
him	c

Dear	c
Jane	c
Clark	c
,	c

I	c
think	c
the	c
festival	c
was	c
fine	c
but	c
in	c
my	c
opinion	c
there	c
must	i
be	c
some	c
improvements	c
to	c
make	c
this	c
festival	c
better	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
there	c
were	c
stars	c
and	c
artists	c
only	i
from	i
six	c
countries	c
.	c

This	c
number	c
may	i
be	c
increased	c
to	c
attract	c
more	c
and	c
different	c
people	c
.	c

Also	c
some	c
concerts	i
holls	i
were	c
too	c
small	c
for	c
this	c
much	i
people	c
.	c

I	c
must	c
admit	c
that	c
you	c
are	i
very	c
successful	c
about	i
finding	c
good	c
stars	c
.	c

The	i
films	i
and	i
plays	i
were	i
not	i
so	i
many	i
.	c

I	c
have	c
nothing	c
to	c
say	c
with	i
the	c
dance	c
show	c
,	c
art	c
exhibitions	c
and	c
talks	c
by	c
writers	c
.	c

They	c
were	c
excellent	c
and	c
they	c
attracted	c
any	i
kind	i
of	c
people	c
.	c

Another	c
paht	i
is	c
the	c
tickets	c
.	c

The	c
weekend	c
ticket	c
is	c
excellent	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
not	c
so	i
expensive	c
and	c
it	c
allows	c
to	i
see	c
everything	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
was	c
disappointed	c
that	c
there	c
were	i
no	c
competition	c
between	c
the	c
films	c
performed	i
I	i
think	c
there	c
should	c
be	c
an	c
Oscar-like	c
competition	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
make	c
people	c
more	c
ambitious	c
to	c
make	c
better	c
films	c
.	c

I	c
promise	c
I	c
'll	c
write	c
more	c

The	c
school	c
rules	c
are	c
horrible	c
here	c
.	c

We	c
are	c
restricted	c
to	i
do	i
nearly	c
everything	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
went	i
to	c
be	c
so	c
evel	i
about	c
school	c
but	c
the	i
rules	c
are	c
rules	c
and	c
they	c
are	c
limiting	c
us	c
with	i
the	c
borders	c
of	c
our	c
school	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
boring	c
.	c

How	c
poor	c
their	c
imagination	i
are	c
!	c
!	c

However	c
we	c
are	c
free	c
at	c
home	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
,	c
you	c
hear	c
the	c
same	c
word	c
every	c
day	c
,	c
"	c
Study	c
,	c
Study	c
,	c
Study	c
"	c
!	c

Nobody	c
likes	c
to	c
study	c
but	c
we	c
have	c
to	c
.	c

Love	c
,	c

I	c
went	c
to	c
see	c
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
Show	i
,	c
Friday	c
evening	c
the	c
16/6	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
been	c
looking	c

I	c

I	c

Money	c
is	c
a	c
very	c
important	c
thing	c
in	i
shopping	c
,	i
if	i
you	c
have	c
money	c
,	c
is	i
not	c
a	c
problem	c
,	c
but	c
if	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
?	c

So	c
,	c
let	c
's	c
imagen	i
that	c
your	c
credit	c
card	c
is	c
not	c
working	c
,	c
or	c
some	c
one	c
stold	i
your	c
cash	c
from	c
your	c
pocket	c
.	c

All	c
people	i
are	c
shouting	c
,	c
stepping	c
on	c
your	c
feet	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
very	c
likely	c
that	c
you	c
wo	c
n't	c
get	c
the	c
product	c
you	c
need	c

After	i
words	i
you	c
are	c
tiered	i
and	c
have	c
no	c
power	i
to	c
do	c

After	c
all	c
things	i
that	c

The	c
Manager	c
of	c
the	c
Theatre	c
Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
so	c
as	c
to	c
express	c
my	c
great	c
disappointment	c
about	c
the	c
Musical	c
Show	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
,	c
"	c
I	i
attended	c
to	i
,	i
a	c
fortnight	c
ago	c
.	c

To	c
begin	c
with	c
,	c
never	c
have	c
I	c
been	c
so	c
upset	c
when	i
I	c
realized	c
that	c
the	i
expected	i
famous	i
actor	i
Danny	i
Brook	c
,	c
did	i
not	c
show	c
up	c
at	c
the	c
performance	c
and	c
that	c
he	c
had	c
been	c
shamefully	c
replaced	c
by	c
an	c
unknown	c
actor	c
whose	c
performance	c
was	c
,	i
quite	c
mediocre	c
.	c

More	i
over	i
,	c
I	c
was	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
getting	c
a	c
reduction	i
on	c
the	c
pricing	i
as	i
,	i
indicated	c
on	i
your	c
adverts	c
,	c
but	c
I	i
,	c
once	c
again	c
,	c
fell	c
flat	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
made	i
my	c
own	c
experience	c
with	c
her	c
so	i
far	i
and	c
I	c
would	c
be	i
always	i
careful	c
not	c
to	c
tell	c
her	c
anything	c
important	c
when	i
ever	i
we	c
met	c
.	c

Mind	c
what	c
you	c
may	i
tell	c
her	c
;	c
she	c
can	c
make	c
the	c
worst	c
of	c
it	c
;	c
gossiping	c
around	i
is	c
her	c
favorite	i
leisure	c
activity	c
!	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
guess	c
that	c
Olga	c
turned	i
a	i
deaf	i
hear	i
to	c
what	c
I	c
had	c
told	c
her	c
.	c

A	c
couple	c
of	c
weeks	c
later	c
,	c
my	c
sister	c
called	c
me	c
as	i
I	c
was	c
at	c
work	c
;	c
completely	c
devastated	c
and	c
weaping	i
scalding	c
tears	c
,	c
she	c
could	c
,	i
hardly	c
pronounce	c
a	c
word	c
.	c

After	c
a	c
while	c
,	c
she	c
pulled	c
herself	c
together	c
and	c
paused	c
for	c
a	c
minute	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
then	c
,	c
feel	i
her	i
,	i
upset	c
as	c
ever	c
.	c

Then	c
I	c
woke	c
up	c
;	c
well	c
,	c
I	c
shall	c
never	c
know	c
what	c
happened	c
to	c
the	c
"	c
poor	c
cow	c
"	c
!	c

Dear	c
Miss	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
have	c
received	c
the	c
letter	c
you	c
have	c
sent	c
me	c
.	c

Next	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
time	c
to	c
relax	c
when	c
I	c
travel	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
been	c
playing	c
it	c
since	c
I	c
was	c
nine	c
years	c
old	c
.	c

In	c
high	c
school	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
in	c
a	c
school	c
team	c
and	c
I	c
enjoyed	c
playing	c
it	c
with	c
my	c
team	c
mate	c
,	c
even	c
though	c
we	c
were	c
not	c
a	c
strong	c
team	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
never	c
played	c
it	c
until	c
last	c
month	c
.	c

Lastly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
whether	c
I	c
should	c
bring	c
some	c
money	c
and	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
should	c
bring	c
.	c

I	c
will	c
be	c
expecting	c
to	c
hear	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Yours	i
sincerely	i
,	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

I	i
've	i
got	c
your	c
letter	c
yesterday	c
.	c

I	c
enjoyed	c
reading	c
how	c
you	c
spent	c
time	c
with	c
your	c
family	c
and	c
had	c
fun	c
at	c
the	c
Park	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
.	c

So	c
he	c
suggested	c
me	c
to	c
help	c
their	i
concert	c
so	c
that	c
I	c
could	c
know	c
behind	c
the	c
scenes	c
.	c

At	c
first	c
I	c
just	c
helped	c
setting	c
up	c
the	c
stage	c
;	c
setting	c
microphones	c
,	c
and	c
tuning	c
guiters	i
.	c

He	c
explained	c
me	i
that	c
it	c
was	c
to	c
controll	i
the	c
light	c
.	c

When	c
the	c
concert	c
was	c
finished	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
exhausted	c
but	c
happy	c
.	c

I	i
'll	i
write	i
you	i
back	i
.	i

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
answer	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
happy	c
I	c
can	c
join	c
you	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
in	c
the	c
U.S.A	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
sorry	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
I	c
can	c
attend	c
your	c
camp	c
only	c
on	i
July	c
because	c
I	c
just	c
started	c
my	c
new	c
job	c
and	c
I	c
got	i
one	c
month	c
of	c
my	i
holiday	c
,	c
which	c
are	i
on	i
July	c
.	c

Beside	c
that	c
I	i
'm	c
alergic	i
,	c
that	i
make	i
me	c
problem	i
when	c
I	c
'm	c
close	c
to	c
the	i
nature	c
.	c

You	c
wrote	c
to	c
me	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
a	c
chance	c
to	c
do	c
two	c
activities	c
,	c
which	c
I	c
can	c
choice	i
.	c

The	c
size	c
of	c
the	c
canvas	c
is	c
n't	c
so	c
important	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
I	c
'll	c
have	c
possibility	i
to	c
improve	c
my	c
ability	c
in	c
it	c
.	c

Could	c
you	c
write	c
to	c
me	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
need	c
and	c
what	c
type	c
of	c
weather	c
do	i
you	c
have	c
in	i
this	c
time	c
of	c
the	c
year	c
.	c

Last	c
month	c
we	c
had	c
the	c
pop	c
concert	c
of	c
our	c
favourite	c
polish	i
group	c
"	c
THE	c
CULT	c
"	c
in	c
Warshaw	c
.	c

You	c
ca	c
n't	c
imagine	c
how	c
happy	c
I	c
was	c
.	c

You	c
know	c
I	c
'm	c
good	c
in	i
mace-up	i
and	c
I	c
have	c
done	c
many	i
times	i
scenography	i
.	c

They	c
were	c
pleased	c
that	c
I	c
can	c
do	c
two	c
of	c
this	i
job	i
that	i
's	c
why	c
I	c
got	c
the	c
work	i
.	c

Could	c
you	c
imagine	c
that	c
they	c
asked	c
me	c
to	c
make	c
the	c
summer	c
scenography	c
.	c

Could	c
you	c
believe	c
that	c
two	c
nights	c
I	c
was	c
cutting	c
paper	i
's	i
flowers	c
,	c
grass	c
,	c
the	c
sun	c
and	c
thousands	c
of	c
birds	c
.	c

Everybody	c
was	c
very	c
suprise	i
that	c
you	c
can	c
create	c
such	c
amazing	c
things	c
,	c
using	c
a	i
sizors	i
and	c
papers	i
.	c

I	c
like	i
a	i
lot	i
the	i
mountains	i
which	i
I	i
made	i
.	c

From	c
the	i
distance	c
they	c
looked	c
very	c
real	c
.	c

In	c
front	c
of	c
the	c
stage	c
I	c
put	c
the	c
grass	c
and	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
flowers	c
.	c

After	c
that	c
I	c
prepared	c
the	c
group	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
happy	c
because	c
on	i
this	c
time	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
chance	c
talking	i
to	c
them	c
and	c
to	c
know	i
more	c
about	c
them	c
.	c

I	c
really	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
why	c
she	c
behave	i
herself	i
so	c
badly	c
during	c
her	c
interview	c
.	c

I	c
got	c
their	c
address	c
so	c
we	c
can	c
visit	c
them	c
one	c
day	c
.	c

I	c
told	c
them	c
about	c
you	c
and	c
they	c
said	c
we	c
are	c
very	c
welcome	c
any	c
time	c
.	c

A	c
lot	c
of	c
kisses	c
.	c

I	c
also	c
hope	c
,	i
that	c
the	c
festival	c
could	c
be	c
even	c
better	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

The	c
great	c
idea	c
of	c
making	c
it	c
"	c
international	c
"	c
was	c
unfortunately	c
not	c
brought	c
to	c
life	c
,	c
because	c
the	c
artists	c
(	c
mentioned	i
to	c
be	c
"	c
from	c
around	c
the	c
world	c
"	c
)	c
were	c
from	c
only	c
six	c
countries	c
.	c

Maybe	c
the	c
eason	i
for	c
that	c
is	c
very	c
simple	c
:	c
lack	c
of	c
money	c
?	c

My	c
suggestion	c
for	c
next	c
year	c
's	c
festival	c
is	c
simple	c
-	c
please	c
make	c
it	c
a	c
few	c
days	c
longer	c
!	c

If	c
you	c
really	c
want	c
to	c
hear	c
about	c
school	c
rules	c
in	c
my	c
country	c
,	c
I	c
'll	c
try	c
to	c
write	c
about	c
them	c
in	i
a	i
nutshell	i
.	c

We	c
do	c
not	c
have	c
many	c
school	c
rules	c
,	c
and	c
the	c
teachers	c
are	c
rather	c
liberal	c
.	c

We	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
to	c
wear	c
any	c
special	c
uniforms	c
on	i
signs	i
of	c
our	c
school	c
.	c

Some	c
rules	c
are	c
really	c
simple	c
:	c
we	c
must	c
be	c
at	c
school	c
on	c
time	c
,	c
and	c
we	c
must	c
not	c
disturb	c
others	c
during	c
the	i
classes	c
.	c

We	c
are	c
not	c
allowed	c
to	c
smoke	c
cigarettes	c
or	c
drink	c
alcohol	c
of	c
course	c
!	c

In	c
winters	i
we	c
are	c
to	c
change	c
our	c
shoes	c
.	c

It	c
may	c
sound	c
funny	c
,	c
but	c
mud	c
,	c
gravel	c
and	c
snow	c
lying	c
on	c
the	c
school	i
's	i
floors	c
is	c
not	c
a	c
nice	c
sight	c
,	c
so	c
we	c
change	c
our	c
schoes	i
without	c
questioning	c
that	c
rule	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
very	c
pleased	c
with	c
my	c
situation	c
and	c
I	c
hope	c
you	c
are	c
pleased	c
with	c
yours	c
!	c

for	c
my	c
acommodation	i
and	c
travel	i
to	c
Ireland	c

I	c
arrived	c
at	i
Ireland	c
on	c
2th	i
July	c

On	c
the	c
next	c
day	c
I	c
helped	c

I	c
had	c
enough	c

in	c
Dublin	c
in	c
the	c
evening	c

On	c
my	c
third	c

I	c
helped	c

While	c
we	c
were	c
installing	c
the	c
sound	c
system	c
we	c
listened	c
irish	i
music	c
and	c
suddenly	c
we	c
saw	c

which	c
is	c
my	c

going	c

I	c
convinced	c
them	c
to	c

of	c
the	c
most	c

the	c

First	c
of	c
all	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
inform	c
you	c
that	c
I	c
am	c
able	c
to	c
travel	c
only	c
in	c
July	c
.	c

Because	c
,	i
I	c
am	c
a	c
student	c
and	c
in	c
June	c
,	c
I	c
will	c
still	c
have	c
school	c
.	c

Also	c
,	c
in	c
Augost	i
I	c
will	c
be	c
studying	c
a	c
summer	c
English	i
course	i
.	c

In	c
addition	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
.	c

Because	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
stay	c
somewhere	c
which	c
differs	c
from	c
my	c
home	c
and	c
every	i
days	i
comforts	c
,	c
in	i
these	c
two	c
weeks	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
choose	c
Basketball	c
and	c
Tennis	c
.	c

Also	c
Tennis	i
is	c
my	c
favourite	c
hobby	c
and	c
I	c
play	c
twice	c
every	i
week	c
with	c
my	c
friends	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
be	c
grateful	c
to	c
you	c
,	i
if	c
you	c
told	i
me	c
about	c
clothes	c
and	c
money	c
.	c

Will	c
we	c
need	c
any	c
special	c
clothes	c
and	c
How	i
much	c
you	i
would	i
suggest	c
me	i
to	i
carry	i
for	c
these	c
two	c
weeks	c
?	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
well	c
I	i
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
explain	i
my	c
experience	c
with	c
the	c
pop	c
concert	c
;	i
last	c
month	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
going	c
to	c
markets	c
to	i
schools	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
giving	c
information	i
when	i
and	c
where	c
the	c
group	c
was	c
going	c
to	c
appear	c
as	c
well	c
as	c
where	c
can	i
they	i
buy	c
or	c
book	c
a	c
ticket	c
for	c
this	c
concert	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
good	c
break	c
from	c
the	c
routine	i
.	c

Because	c
I	c
believed	c
that	c
this	c
was	c
a	c
result	c
which	c
came	c
with	i
my	c
help	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
do	c
again	i
it	i
in	c
the	c
future	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
fantastic	c
experience	c
.	c

I	c
will	c
be	c
having	c
my	c
exams	c
durind	i
this	c
month	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
travel	c
before	c
July	c

As	c
you	c
can	c
see	c
,	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
available	c
only	c
in	c
July	c
.	c

As	c
regards	c
accommodation	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
tents	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
used	c
to	c
going	i
on	c
holiday	c
with	c
my	c
friends	c
and	c
staying	i
in	c
tents	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
spare	c
time	c
I	c
like	c
to	c
play	c
basketball	c
for	c
a	c
local	c
team	c
of	c
which	c
I	c
have	c
recently	c
been	c
made	c
captain	c

Could	c
you	c
please	c
let	c
me	c
know	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
weather	c
will	i
be	i
there	i
in	c

,	c
what	c
sorts	c
of	c
clothing	c
I	c
'd	c
better	c
take	c
with	c
me	c
.	c

Is	c
there	c
an	c
extra	c
charge	c
for	c
some	c
trips	c
,	c
which	c
might	c
put	c
them	c
beyond	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
for	i
explaining	i
some	c
problems	c
your	c
theatre	c
has	c
got	c
and	c
asking	i
for	c
some	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

Another	c
problem	c
was	c
the	c
time	c
.	c

As	c
soon	c
as	c
the	c
play	c
had	c
started	c
I	c
noticed	c
another	c
problem	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
a	c
big	c
fan	c
of	c
Danny	c
Book	c
and	c
it	i
was	c
why	c
I	c
chose	c
'	c
over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
'	c
.	c

After	c
the	c
show	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
restaurant	c
according	c
to	c
your	c
advertisement	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	i
of	i
decoration	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c

I	c
remember	c
some	c
sientific	i
cartoons	i
when	i
I	i
was	i
younger	i
I	i
watched	i
on	i
television	i
.	c

Second	c
I	i
can	c
save	c
time	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
modern	c
technology	c
could	c
affect	c
my	c
life	c
in	c
a	c
bad	c
way	c
.	c

Another	c
problem	c
is	c
pollution	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
a	i
car	c
is	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
most	c
common	c
products	c
of	c
modern	c
technology	c
.	c

The	c
more	c
cars	c
there	c
are	c
on	c
the	c
street	c
,	c
the	c
more	c
difficult	c
it	c
is	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
keep	c
myself	c
fit	c
.	c

To	c
sum	c
it	c
up	c
,	c
as	c
technology	c
is	c
improving	c
my	c
life	c
itself	c
is	c
becoming	c
convinient	i
.	c

To	c
live	c
in	c
this	c
world	c
needs	c
somebody	c
else	c
to	c
contact	c
and	c
health	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
am	c
loosing	c
chances	c
to	c
meet	c
my	c
friend	c
face	c
to	c
face	c
and	c
I	c
feel	c
I	c
am	c
getting	c
weaker	c
.	c

I	c
suppose	c
people	c
including	i
me	c
should	i
keep	i
themselves	i
in	i
a	i
limited	i
their	i
own	i
space	i
in	i
near	i
future	i
.	i

It	c
will	c
be	c
caused	c
by	c
technology	c

From	c
your	c

I	c
was	c
pleased	c
to	c
know	i
that	c
all	c
accommodation	c
and	c
travel	c
costs	c
are	c

What	c
kind	c
of	c
people	c
will	c
be	c
invited	c
at	i
your	c

-	c
it	c
does	c
not	c
matter	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
so	c
!	c

I	c
have	c
been	c
written	i
to	c
you	c
that	c
my	c
life	c
in	c
London	c
was	i
a	c
little	c
bit	c
boring	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
true	c
.	c

But	c
now	c
all	i
things	i
became	i
absolutly	i
changed	i
!	c

I	c
found	c
the	c
kind	c
of	c
activity	c
what	i
I	c
looking	i
for	c
four	i
ages	c
.	c

We	c
established	c
a	c
firm	c
which	c
has	c
a	c
deal	c
with	c
musicians	c
and	c
contemporary	c
pop	c
stars	c
.	c

We	c
were	i
renting	i
for	c
him	c
a	c
special	c
hall	c
near	c
Piccadilly	c
Circus	c
.	c

His	c
one-week	c
concert	c
programme	c
was	c
so	c
succsessful	i
that	c
we	c
decided	c
to	c
invite	c
him	c
else	i
,	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
tickets	i
would	i
be	i
sold	i
.	c

P.S.	c
Your	c
present	c

a	c
small	c
toy	c
,	c
a	c
white	c
hose	i
-	c
I	c
always	c
keep	c
with	c
me	c
,	c
it	c
helps	c
me	c
to	c
pass	c
my	c
exams	c
.	c

With	c
Love	c
-	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
if	c
is	i
possible	c
for	c
me	c
going	i
on	i
July	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
school	c
on	i
the	c
others	i
months	c
,	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
impossible	c
for	c
me	c
going	i
on	i
December	c
or	c
January	c

About	c
the	c
accommodation	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
log	i
cabins	i
instand	i
of	c

because	c
is	i
safer	c

more	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c

People	c
are	c
used	c
to	c
go	i
to	c
the	c
shopping	i
because	c
it	c
is	c
easier	i
and	c
familiare	i
,	i
it	i
is	c
one	c
place	c
where	c
you	c
can	c
have	c
lunch	c
or	c
dinner	c
,	c
watch	c
some	i
movie	c
after	c
that	c
,	c
and	c
if	i
you	c
want	c
buy	i
something	c
at	c
the	c
shops	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
everything	c
at	c
the	c
shopping	i
is	c
more	c
expensive	c
,	c
because	c
the	c
people	c
that	c
buy	i
on	i
it	i
usually	c
do	c
n't	c
compare	c
prices	c
or	c
look	c
for	c
cheaper	c
shops	c
,	c
because	c
all	c
they	c
need	c
it	i
is	c
already	c
at	c
this	c
place	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
why	c
do	c
n't	c
we	c
try	c
to	c
change	c
our	c
customs	i
and	c
start	c
to	c
do	c
knew	i
things	c
to	c
enjoy	c
ourselves	c
.	c

Circle	c
theatre	c
's	c
Manager	c
:	c
I	c
am	c
writting	i
you	i
because	c
I	c
felt	c
dissapointed	i
after	c
seeing	c
the	c
musical	c
show	i
"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
.	c

There	c
were	c
many	c
things	c
that	c
were	c
wrong	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
I	c
saw	c
.	c

First	c
the	c
actors	c
who	c
were	c
suppoused	i
to	c
star	c
in	c
this	c
show	c
were	c
not	c
the	c
ones	c
put	c
in	i
there	i
.	c

But	c
the	c
problems	c
started	c
while	i
I	c
arrived	c
the	i
place	c
.	c

Appart	i
from	c
this	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
fourty	i
five	i
minutes	c
later	i
.	c

So	c
I	c
hope	c
that	c
you	c
will	c
understand	c
my	c
point	c
.	c

I	c
also	c
had	i
to	c
tell	c
you	c
that	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
there	c
were	c
few	i
people	c
there	c
and	c
they	c
take	i
me	i
out	i
of	i
the	c
place	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
upset	c
.	c

He	c
had	c
talked	c
to	c
Caroline	c
days	c
before	c
the	c
secret	c
was	c
known	c
.	c

She	c
had	c
told	c
him	c
about	c
the	i
relationship	c
with	c
her	c
boyfriend	c
.	c

Everybody	c
knew	c
that	c
Caroline	c
and	c
her	c
boyfriend	c
John	c
,	i
loved	c
each	c
other	c
so	c
much	c
that	c
it	c
would	c
n't	c
be	c
rare	i
to	c
find	c
that	c
they	c
had	c
have	i
sex	c
together	i
.	c

The	c
point	c
here	c
is	c
,	i
that	c
Caroline	c
choosed	i
the	c
worst	c
friend	c
to	c
told	i
this	c
.	i

When	c
she	c
finally	c
told	c
him	c
,	c
Pat	c
react	i
in	c
a	c
very	c
wrong	i
way	c
and	c
told	i
rapidly	i
to	i
John	i
.	c

But	c
as	i
every	c
story	c
this	c
has	c
a	c
happy	c
final	i
.	c

And	c
Pat	c
understood	c
that	c
secrets	i
should	i
die	i
on	i
your	i
own	i
.	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
the	c
programme	c
you	c
have	c
organised	c
.	c

London	c
is	c
the	c
place	c
to	c
be	c
when	i
always	i
something	c
happening	c
.	c

And	c
all	c
of	c
it	c
is	c
free	c

According	c
to	c
your	c
programme	c
we	i
have	c

Museum	c
which	c
is	c
in	c

then	c

All	c
students	i
will	i
be	c
very	c
greatful	i

After	c
hard	c
work	c
we	i
want	c
to	c
go	c
home	c

have	c
our	c

where	c
we	c
are	c
all	i

to	c
rest	c
and	c
relax	c

We	c
live	c
in	c
the	i
very	c
busy	c
world	c
!	c

Propably	i
in	c
the	c
future	c
we	c
might	i
be	c
to	i
busy	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
our	c
own	c
home	c
and	c
spend	c
some	c
time	c
there	c

We	c
find	c
our	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

Since	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
full-time	c
student	c
,	c
I	c
will	c
not	c
have	c
finished	c
my	c
lessons	c
until	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
June	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
,	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
busy	c
with	c
my	c
cousework	i
in	c
August	c
.	c

Regarding	c
to	i
the	c
accomodation	i
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
tents	c
because	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
closer	c
to	c
the	i
nature	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
sure	c
I	c
will	c
have	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
fun	c
and	c
release	c
myself	c
from	c
the	i
busy	i
study	i
totally	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Shopping	c
,	i
is	c
becoming	c
a	c
popular	c
way	c
of	c
killing	c
time	c
nowdays	i
.	c

However	c
,	c
more	c
and	c
more	c
people	c
are	c
now	c
asking	c
,	c
"	c
Is	c
shopping	c
always	c
so	c
enjoyable	c
?	c
"	c

Try	c
to	c
imagine	c
the	c
scence	i
:	c
twenty	c
or	c
thirty	c
or	c
even	c
more	c
people	c
are	c
keeping	i
a	c
quel	i
outside	c
the	c
fitting	c
room	c
.	c

Would	c
you	c
be	c
patient	c
enough	c
to	c
wait	c
for	c
half	c
an	c
hour	c
or	c
more	c
just	c
because	c
you	c
wanna	i
buy	i
a	c
T-shirt	c
?	c

Secondly	c
,	c
the	c
cost	c
is	c
also	c
a	c
problem	c
.	c

It	c
will	i
be	i
really	i
an	i
annoying	c
thing	c
when	c
you	c
are	c
keen	c
on	c
something	c
but	c
you	c
ca	c
n't	c
afford	c
it	c
.	c

One	c
of	c
my	c
friend	i
,	c
Emma	c
,	c
happened	c
to	c
see	c
a	c
fantastic	c
jacket	c
which	c
costs	c
£	c
105	c
.	c

She	c
felt	c
really	c
badly	i
after	c
that	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
would	c
you	c
still	c
say	c
that	c
shopping	c
is	c
enjoyable	c
?	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

Sometimes	c
it	c
can	c
be	c
a	c
waste	c
of	c
time	c

Dear	c
Madam	c
,	c

I	c
entered	c
the	c
competition	c
you	c
organized	c
but	c
never	c
expected	c
to	c
be	c
the	c
lucky	c
winner	c
.	c

The	c
accomodation	i
that	c
best	c
suits	c
me	c
is	c
in	i
log	i
cabins	i
,	c
as	c
the	c
space	c
in	c
tents	c
is	c
very	c
limited	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
not	c
used	c
to	c
have	i
all	c
my	c
belongings	c
in	c
order	c
and	c
packed	c
at	c
all	c
times	c
.	c

Please	c
send	c
me	c
a	c
list	c
of	c
the	c
items	c
I	c
many	i
need	c
there	c
,	c
including	c
the	c
most	c
appropriate	c
clothes	c
for	c
the	c
american	i
weather	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Most	c
of	c
us	c
would	c
agree	c
on	c
that	c
.	c

Who	c
has	c
never	c
had	c
a	c
bad	c
experience	c
related	c
with	i
an	c
unsatisfactory	c
product	c
?	c

And	c
finally	c
who	c
has	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
needed	c
to	c
do	c
so	c
?	c

And	c
whenever	c
money	c
is	c
involved	c
,	c
some	c
problems	c
are	c
likely	c
to	c
happen	i
.	c

Thieves	c
will	c
try	c
to	c
put	c
their	c
hands	c
in	c
our	c
wallets	c
and	c
purses	c
,	c
and	c
even	c
the	c
so	i
called	i
'	c
plastic	c
money	c
'	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
safe	c
.	c

And	c
nobody	c
can	c
say	c
they	c
would	c
rather	c
go	c
back	c
to	c
the	c
caverns	i
'	i
age	c
where	i
money	c
was	c
not	c
even	c
invented	c
.	c

With	c
more	c
free	c
time	c
and	c
more	c
money	c
to	c
spend	c
than	c
ever	c
,	c
shopping	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
activity	c
,	c
but	c
when	c
this	c
creates	c
bad	c
habits	c
as	i
overspending	c
,	c
could	i
lead	c
to	c
serious	c
problems	c
.	c

At	i
the	i
end	i
all	i
depends	c
in	i
our	c
attitud	i
to	c

,	c
including	c
shopping	c
.	c

I	c
particularly	c
enjoy	c
making	c
lists	c
of	c
the	c
products	c
before	i
going	c
shopping	c
.	c

But	c
even	c
without	c
money	c
to	c
spend	c
is	i
fun	c
to	c
rush	c
from	c
time	c
to	c
time	c
in	i
the	c
sales	c
that	c
seasonaly	i
appear	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
you	c
state	c
in	c
the	c
letter	c
that	c
the	c
accommodation	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
is	c
in	c
tents	c
or	c
log	c
cabins	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
tents	i
because	c
I	c
like	c
being	c
in	c
contact	c
with	c
the	i
nature	c
life	i
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
from	c
the	c
list	c
of	c
activities	c
that	c
you	c
are	i
also	i
state	i
in	c
the	c
letter	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
swimming	c
because	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
child	c
I	c
practised	i
this	c
sport	c
for	c
8	c
years	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

Many	c
thanks	c
for	c
your	c
last	c
letter	c
.	c

Anyway	c
,	c
the	c
reason	c
I	c
'm	c
writing	c
is	c
that	c
you	c
asked	c
me	c
about	c
my	c
experience	c
with	c
the	c
most	c
famous	c
pop	c
group	c
in	c
America	c
:	c
"	c
Mana	c
"	c

Jane	c
's	c
grandfather	c
was	c
the	c
organiser	c
of	c
the	c
pop	c
concert	c
and	c
Jane	c
had	c
invited	c
me	c
to	c
help	c
in	i
the	c
event	c
.	c

First	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
accept	c
but	c
finally	c
she	c
conviced	i
me	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
the	c
most	c
excited	i
experience	c
I	c
have	c
ever	c
had	c
!	c

I	c
helped	c
with	c
the	c
lights	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
in	c
charge	c
of	c
the	c
food	c
and	c
drinks	i
.	c

I	c
did	c
hamburgers	c
and	c
hot	c
dogs	c
and	c
I	c
prepare	i
orange	c
juices	c
.	c

He	c
's	c
good-looking	i
.	c

Write	c
soon	c

Having	c
won	c
the	c
trip	c
to	c
California	c
delights	c
me	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
providing	c
you	c
the	i
further	c
informations	i
you	c
asked	c
for	c
:	c

I	c
only	c
have	c
two	c
months	c
of	c
vacation	c
that	i
are	i
July	c
and	c
August	c
and	c
since	c
I	c
must	c
visit	c
my	c
grandparents	c
in	c
August	c
,	c
the	c
only	c
time	c
possible	c
is	c
July	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
a	c
tent	c
rather	c
than	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
told	c
that	c
the	c
Californiai	i
summer	c
is	c
hot	c
and	c
dry	c
so	c
because	i
a	c
tent	c
's	c
wind	c
circulation	c
is	c
better	c
,	c
it	c
would	c
create	c
a	c
confortable	i
coolness	c
.	c

The	c
two	c
activities	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
do	c
are	c
basketball	c
and	c
surfing	c
.	c

Do	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
bring	c
particular	i
clothing	c
like	i
a	c
surfing	i
suit	i
,	c
for	c
instance	c
?	c

Best	c
Regards	c

There	c
,	c
you	c
find	c
an	c
enormous	c
queue	c
waiting	c
for	c
you	c
but	c
you	c
still	c
have	c
to	c
stay	i
up	c
even	c
though	c
your	c
tired	c
legs	c
demand	c
a	c
seat	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
finally	c
your	c
turn	c
and	c
you	c
reluctantly	c
hand	c
the	c
money	c
over	c
to	c
the	c
hypocrital	i
cashier	c
.	c

Then	c
,	c
you	c
can	c
rest	c
a	c
little	c
and	c
examine	c
the	c
product	c
a	c
little	c
closer	c
but	c
unluckily	i
,	c
it	c
does	c
not	c
provide	c
the	c
satisfaction	c
you	c
may	c
have	c
wished	c
for	c
.	c

Instead	c
,	c
you	c
keep	c
thinking	c
about	c
the	c
initial	c
product	c
you	c
could	c
not	c
afford	c
,	c
resulting	c
into	i
more	c
frustration	c
and	c
tiredness	c
.	c

So	c
there	c
are	c
several	c
plausible	c
reasons	c
why	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
enquire	c
about	c
the	c
competition	c
that	c
I	c
won	c
and	c
give	c
some	c
details	c
to	c
you	c
about	c
myself	c
and	c
my	c
interests	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
spare	c
time	c
,	c
I	c
enjoy	c
playing	c
basketball	c
with	c
my	c
friends	c
and	c
I	c
also	c
like	c
swimming	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
what	c
types	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
need	c
and	c
beside	c
this	c
,	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
need	c
during	c
my	c
vacation	c
.	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

Last	c
month	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
great	c
time	c
at	c
the	c
concert	c
of	c
"	c
Dragon	c
"	c
which	i
is	c
the	c
most	c
popular	c
hard-rock	i
group	c
all	i
over	i
the	c
world	c
.	c

They	c
had	c
a	c
concert	c
in	c
my	c
hometown	i
that	i
's	c
why	c
the	c
organizators	i
were	c
looking	c
for	c
young	c
people	c
who	c
can	i
speak	c
English	c
.	c

I	c
applied	c
and	c
They	i
took	c
me	c
on	c
.	c

Basicly	i
,	c
I	c
helped	c
them	c
connecting	i
with	c
the	c
local	c
police	c
and	c
getting	i
some	c
electronical	i
equipments	i
that	c
they	c
needed	c
.	c

They	c
treated	c
me	c
as	c
if	c
I	c
was	c
the	c
private	c
secretary	c
of	c
the	c
department	c
,	c
because	c
of	c
this	c
sometimes	c
I	c
felt	c
that	c
the	c
power	c
was	c
in	c
my	c
hands	c
.	c

By	c
the	c
way	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
already	c
been	c
invited	c
their	i
next	c
concernt	i
.	c

Would	c
you	c
like	c
to	c
come	c
with	c
me	c
?	c

Looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

Love	c

Two	c
months	c
ago	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
see	c
your	c
musical	c
show	c
.	c

I	c
got	c
very	c
angry	c
because	c
you	c
are	c
liars	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
most	c
disappointing	c
evening	i
of	c
my	c
life	c
.	c

The	c
advertisement	c
said	c
that	c
the	c
actors	c
were	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
but	c
the	c
actor	i
was	i
different	c
.	c

Who	c
can	i
believe	c
it	c
?	c

You	c
are	i
really	i
a	c
funny	c
theatre	c
.	c

And	c
the	i
time	c
too	i
.	c

You	c
wrote	c
that	c
at	c
19.30	c
the	c
musical	c
started	i
.	c

the	c
show	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
.	c

You	c
said	c
that	c
some	c
discouns	i
was	i
available	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
reastaure	i
I	c
was	c
really	c
suprised	i
.	c

It	c
was	c
closed	c
and	c
I	c
steel	i
do	c
n't	c
know	c
why	c
?	i

The	i
modern	i
technology	c
help	i
me	c
when	c
I	c
do	c
my	c
homework	c
,	i
to	i
some	i
games	c
e.t.c	i
.	i

First	c
of	c
all	c
the	i
computer	c
.	c

I	c
can	c
find	c
many	c
things	c
from	i
the	c
internet	i
or	c
to	i
write	i
my	c
compositions	c
on	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
can	c
go	c
from	c
one	c
place	c
to	i
other	i
very	c
fast	c

Most	c
of	c
the	c
machines	c
which	c
you	i
have	c
at	c
home	c
help	c
me	c
,	c
too	c
.	c

I	c
can	c
find	c
cold	c
water	c
in	c
the	c
refrigarator	i
but	c
50	c
years	c
before	i
the	i
did	c
n't	c
have	c
the	c
refrigarator	i
,	c
so	c
our	c
life	c
is	c
easier	c
,	i
today	c
.	c

13rd	c
of	c
June	c

For	i
me	i
it	i
is	i
only	i
possible	i
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
.	c

That	c
is	c
the	c
only	c
month	c
where	i
I	c
have	c
time	c
because	c
after	c
July	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
start	c
with	i
the	i
University	i
.	c

When	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
child	c
my	c
parents	c
and	c
I	c
spent	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
time	c
at	c
camps	c
.	c

You	c
wrote	c
that	c
I	c
should	c
choose	c
two	c
activities	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	i

I	c
think	c
it	c
depents	i
if	c
you	c
are	c
a	c
man	c
or	c
a	c
woman	c
and	c
now	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
say	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
woman	c
and	c
I	c
enjoy	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
can	c
remember	c
one	c
shopping	c
tour	i
which	c
I	c
had	i
with	i
a	c
man	c
and	c
it	c
was	c
nightmare	i
.	c

We	c
left	c
the	c
shop	c
without	c
shoes	i
,	c
in	c
horrible	i
mood	c
and	c
we	c
went	c
home	c
.	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
my	c
advise	i
is	c
that	c
the	i
women	c
should	c
go	c
alone	c
or	c
with	c
a	c
female	c
friend	c
.	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
have	c
received	c
your	c
letter	c
today	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
to	i
thank	c
you	c
for	c
the	c
first	c
price	i
.	c

The	c
best	c
dates	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
travel	c
,	i
would	c
be	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
actually	i
I	c
work	c
in	c
the	c
communication	i
firm	i
and	c
I	c
must	c
ask	c
to	i
my	c
employer	c
when	c
I	c
can	c
take	c
holidays	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
from	c
the	c
7	c
July	c
2000	c
to	c
the	c
21	c
July	c
2000	c
.	c

For	i
the	c
accommodation	c
at	c
camp	c
,	c
I	c
prefer	c
in	i
the	c
log	c
cabins	c
,	c
because	c
few	i
years	c
go	c
,	c
I	c
went	c
camping	c
with	c
some	c
friends	c
and	c
every	c
night	c
it	c
rained	c
and	c
in	c
the	c
tent	c
,	i
it	c
was	c
impossible	c
to	c
sleep	c
because	c
the	c
ground	c
was	c
so	c
wet	i
so	i
for	c
this	c
fact	i
,	c
I	c
choose	c
the	c
log	c
cabins	c
.	c

My	c
second	c
choice	c
,	i
it	i
is	c
Basketball	i
.	c

I	c
have	c
played	c
basketball	c
at	c
school	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
best	c
player	i
after	c
that	c
,	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
coach	c
a	c
team	c
but	c
I	c
should	c
stop	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
started	c
swimming	i
competition	i
.	c

It	i
is	i
including	i
the	i
transport	i
and	i
travel	i
,	c
but	c
for	c
the	c
food	c
and	c
extra	c
hobbies	i
I	c
must	c
take	c
some	c
money	c
.	c

Could	c
you	c
tell	c
me	c
approximatively	i

M.	c
Bruni	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

How	c
are	c
you	c
?	c

I	c
'm	c
fine	c
.	c

You	c
know	c
last	c
month	c
I	c
helped	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
as	c
like	i
security	c
.	c

After	c
that	c
,	c
at	c
2:00	c
pm	c
,	c
when	c
people	c
arrived	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
at	c
the	c
entrance	c
to	c
take	c
the	c
tickets	c
and	c
you	i
know	c
it	i
was	c
incredibale	i
because	c
some	c
people	c
slept	c
all	c
the	i
night	c
in	c
front	c
of	c
the	c
stadium	c
to	c
be	c
in	c
the	c
front	c
row	c
.	c

If	c
I	c
had	i
an	i
other	i
opportunity	c
to	c
do	c
that	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
I	c
will	c
do	c
.	c

Last	c
season	i
I	c
spent	c
two	c
days	c
at	c
the	c
Festival	c
.	c

I	c
enjoyed	c
myself	c
very	c
much	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
the	c
organization	c
of	c
the	c
next	c
festival	c
could	c
be	c
better	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
as	c
I	c
see	c
it	c
the	c
idea	c
of	c
an	c
Arts	c
Festival	c
is	c
great	c
because	c
in	c
this	c
way	c
many	c
people	c
can	c
know	i
artists	c
who	c
cames	i
from	c
different	c
countries	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
in	c
the	c
last	c
edition	i
there	i
were	i
artists	c
who	i
cames	i
from	c
only	c
six	c
countries	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
think	c
you	c
should	c
invite	c
artists	c
from	c
other	c
countries	c
,	c
for	c
example	c
from	c
Africa	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
appreciated	c
the	c
fact	c
that	c
there	c
were	c
concerts	c
of	i
different	c
kind	i
of	c
music	c
,	c
but	c
in	c
this	c
case	c
the	c
main	c
problem	c
was	c
that	c
some	c
concerts	i
hall	i
were	c
too	c
small	c
,	c
and	c
because	c
of	c
it	i
I	c
could	c
n't	c
see	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
concerts	c
in	i
programme	i
.	c

In	i
the	c
next	c
edition	i
will	c
be	i
more	c
or	c
less	c
?	i

I	i
hope	i
more	i
.	c

The	c
thing	c
that	c
I	c
liked	c
much	c
more	c
than	c
others	i
,	i
was	c
that	c
I	c
had	i
to	i
buy	i
only	i
one	c
ticket	c
for	c
all	c
events	i
,	c
and	c
it	c
was	c
no	i
pricey	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
clear	c
that	c
for	c
me	c
the	c
last	c
Festival	c
was	c
really	c
great	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
have	c
only	c
one	c
suggestion	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
,	i
I	c
think	c
you	c
should	c
do	i
a	c
baby-parking	i
,	i
in	i
fact	c
a	c
certain	c
number	c
of	c
women	c
could	c
n't	c
see	c
the	c
Festival	c
because	c
of	c
their	c
sons	i
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	i

What	c
I	c
try	i
to	c
explain	c
is	c
that	c
in	c
every	c
book	c
there	c
are	c
characters	c
or	c
situations	c
really	i
different	c
.	c

So	c
we	c
can	c
read	c
realistic	c
stories	c
or	c
fantastic	c
,	i
it	i
depends	c
from	i
what	c
we	c
prefer	c
.	c

I	c
always	c
prefer	c
read	i
books	c
that	c
are	c
inusual	i
in	c
some	c
way	c
,	c
because	c
they	c
give	c
me	c
the	c
opportunity	c
of	i
escape	i
from	c
the	i
everyday	c
reality	c
.	c

In	c
this	c
book	c
you	c
can	c
find	c
only	c
good	c
or	c
bad	c
characters	c
,	i
everything	c
is	c
good	c
or	c
bad	c
.	c

In	c
other	c
words	c
,	c
when	c
I	c
read	c
a	c
book	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
go	c
in	i
a	c
world	c
where	c
I	c
can	c
find	c
something	c
different	c
from	c
my	c
everyday	c
life	c
.	c

Dear	c
The	i
Manager	c
of	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
,	c

There	c
are	c
some	c
differences	c
between	c
the	c
advertisement	c
and	c
the	c
real	c
show	c
.	c

To	c
make	c
it	c
worse	c
,	c
neither	c
discounts	c
or	i
restraurants	i
were	c
available	c
at	i
that	c
night	c
although	c
they	c
were	c
said	c
to	c
be	c
available	c
.	c

Some	c
are	c
in	i
formal	i
others	c
are	c
in	i
casual	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
,	i
there	c
will	c
be	c
some	c
diffences	i
in	c
quality	i
and	c
materials	c
of	c
clothes	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
speaking	c
of	c
sports	c
,	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
remarkable	c
progress	c
has	c
been	c
made	c
in	i
especially	i
swimming	c
costumes	c
and	c
athletes	c
'	c
costumes	i
for	c
Olympic	i
.	c

In	c
addition	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
the	c
earth	c
will	c
be	c
warmer	c
and	c
warmer	i
than	c
now	c
and	c
100	c
year	i
from	c
now	c
will	i
be	i
an	i
Area	i
of	i
Space	i
.	c

So	c
clothes	c
for	c
space	c
will	c
be	c
necessary	c
and	c
clothes	c
for	c
warmer	c
climates	c
will	c
be	c
necessary	c
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
100	c
years	c
from	c
now	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
,	i
better	i
quality	c
in	i
clothes	c
will	c
be	c
created	i
in	c
every	c
field	i
,	i
such	i
as	i
sports	i
,	i
office	i
,	i
leisure	i
,	i
building	i
site	i
,	i
school	i
and	i
space	i
.	c

although	i
outlooking	i
such	c
as	c
,	i
shape	c
and	c
color	i
will	c
not	c
be	i
changed	i
so	c
much	c
in	c
fashion	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
happy	c
.	c

Actually	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
asked	c
my	c
boss	c
and	c
he	c
gave	i
me	c
two	c
weeks	c
in	i
July	c
.	c

We	c
have	c
a	c
lot	c
to	c
do	c
at	c
work	c
so	c
it	c
is	c
not	c
easy	c
to	c
have	i
weeks	c
off	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
more	c
fun	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
tennis	c
.	c

Last	c
year	c
,	c
I	c
took	c
part	c
in	c
a	c
competition	c
and	c
I	c
did	c
it	i
well	c
.	c

I	c
have	i
also	i
a	c
licence	i
for	i
sailing	i
but	c
I	c
have	c
not	c
done	c
it	c
for	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
.	c

Therefore	c
,	c
could	c
you	c
give	c
me	c
an	c
idea	c
of	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
should	c
bring	c
with	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forwards	i
to	c
receiving	c
more	c
information	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

Sofia	c
Jordana	c

It	c
is	c
Saturday	c
.	c

No	i
more	c
trolleys	i
for	i
shopping	i
.	c

All	c
the	c
shops	c
are	c
crowded	c
.	c

Because	c
of	c
that	c
,	c
people	c
's	c
need	i
has	i
increase	i
a	c
lot	c
nowadays	c
.	c

In	i
the	i
one	i
hand	i
,	c
it	c
is	c
very	c
enjoyable	c
to	c
go	c
shopping	c
because	c
we	c
can	c
find	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
things	c
.	c

Sometimes	c
we	c
need	c
them	c
and	c
sometimes	c
we	c
do	c
n't	c
but	c
it	c
is	c
fun	c
to	c
buy	c
new	c
clothes	c
,	c
furniture	c
and	c
so	c
one	i
.	c

In	i
the	i
other	i
hand	i
,	c
the	c
service	i
in	c
the	c
shops	c
or	i
supermarkets	c
has	c
decrease	i
a	c
lot	c
those	i
last	c
years	i
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
especially	i
when	c
there	c
is	i
too	c
many	c
people	c
in	c
there	i
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
which	i
I	c
went	c
to	c
see	c
last	c
week	c
.	c

Then	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
had	i
to	c
start	c
at	c
half	c
past	c
seven	c
and	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
wait	c
fourty-five	i
minutes	c
because	c
it	c
started	c
later	i
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
visit	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
and	c
have	c
a	c
good	c
dinner	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
impossible	c
.	c

I	c
will	c
be	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Alice	c
is	c
my	c
best	c
friend	c
and	c
we	c
met	c
twenty	c
years	c
ago	c
.	c

We	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
same	c
school	c
and	c
we	c
had	c
the	c
same	c
hobbies	c
.	c

But	c
she	c
was	c
very	c
sad	c
because	c
she	c
knew	c
that	c
it	c
will	i
be	c
very	c
difficult	c
to	i
see	c
eachother	i
in	c
the	c
future	c
.	c

After	c
that	c
,	c
we	c
wrote	c
letters	c
and	c
she	c
phoned	c
me	c
once	c
time	i
a	c
week	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
the	c
same	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
n't	c
explain	c
all	c
my	c
problems	c
to	c
her	c
and	c
her	c
voice	c
had	c
changed	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
visit	c
her	c
but	c
I	c
wanted	c
that	i
it	c
was	i
a	c
surprise	c
.	c

I	c
decided	c
to	c
explain	c
all	c
my	c
plans	c
to	c
Pat	c
and	c
she	c
promised	c
me	c
that	c
she	c
did	i
n't	i
say	c
anything	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
true	c
.	c

In	c
spite	c
of	c
this	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
happy	c
because	c
I	c
know	c
that	c
Alice	c
is	c
preparing	c
many	c
activities	c
to	i
do	c
together	c
and	i
to	i
spend	i
the	c
best	c
week	c
in	i
our	c
lifes	i
.	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
,	c

Moreover	c
,	c
the	c
actors	c
were	c
not	c
the	c
same	c
of	i
the	i
advertisement	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
we	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
they	c
were	c
on	c
holidays	i
.	c

I	c
look	c
to	i
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

PEDRO	c
REZ	c
SORAN	c

Sally	c
and	c
I	c
had	c
bought	c
a	c
nice	c
big	c
house	c
beside	c
the	c
sea	c
in	i
the	c
outskirts	c
of	c
the	c
city	c
.	c

Because	c
of	c
this	c
,	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
sell	c
the	c
house	c
and	c
left	c
our	c
jobs	c
.	c

When	c
we	c
arrived	c
in	c
Spain	c
,	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
explain	c
our	i
parents	c
all	c
our	i
adventure	c
.	c

That	c
day	c
was	c
the	c
worst	c
day	c
of	c
all	i
my	c
life	i
.	c

Nowadays	i
,	c
Sally	c
and	c
I	c
are	c
married	c
,	c
have	c
three	c
children	c
,	c
a	c
marvellous	c
house	c
and	c
both	c
of	c
us	c
are	c
working	c
in	i
a	c
big	c
company	c
.	c

I	c
address	c
this	c
letter	c
to	c
you	c
because	c
as	c
the	c
manager	c
of	c
"	c
The	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
"	c
I	c
hold	c
you	c
responsible	c
for	c
the	c
most	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
in	c
a	c
theatre	c
I	c
had	i
in	c
years	c
.	c

I	c
went	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
evening	c
performance	c
of	c
your	c
production	c
of	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
on	c
saturday	i
the	c
2nd	c
of	c
June	c
.	c

At	c
first	c
I	c
was	c
irritated	c
that	c
contrary	c
to	c
your	c
announcements	c
no	c
discounts	c
were	c
availlable	i
.	c

Although	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
scheduled	c
to	c
start	c
at	c
19.30h	c
,	c
it	c
did	c
not	c
begin	c
until	c
20.15h	c
.	c

To	c
my	c
greatest	c
disappointement	i
Danny	c
Brooks	c
was	c
not	c
in	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
but	c
his	c
part	c
was	c
played	c
by	c
an	c
actor	c
whose	c
(	c
lack	c
of	c
)	c
singing	c
and	c
acting	c
skills	c
did	c
not	c
make	c
him	c
a	c
suitable	c
replacement	c

That	c

stories	c
always	c
describe	c
people	c
in	c
difficult	c
situations	c
is	c
true	c
of	c
Agatha	c

"	c
Witness	c
for	c

prosecution	c
"	c
.	c

He	c
had	c
befriended	c
her	c
without	c
telling	c
her	c
that	c
he	c
was	c
married	c
.	c

To	c
help	c
her	c
husband	c
she	c
works	c
out	c
a	c
plan	c
:	c
She	i
is	c
willing	c
to	c
be	c
witness	i
for	c
the	c
prosecution	c
and	c
states	c
that	c
her	c
husband	c
has	i
not	i
been	i
with	c
her	c
at	c
the	c
time	c
the	c
crime	c
was	c
committed	c
.	c

She	c
then	c
gives	c
letters	c
to	c
her	c
husband	c
's	c
lawyer	c
that	c
seem	c
to	c
prove	c
that	c
she	c
has	c
been	c
unfaithful	c
to	c
him	c
and	c
that	c
she	c
tries	i
to	c
get	c
rid	c
of	c
him	c
with	c

found	c
innocent	c

One	c
of	c
my	c
reasons	c
to	i
travel	i
to	c
London	c
,	i
was	c
this	c
theatre	c
.	c

I	c
thought	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
the	c
best	c
musical	c
show	c
that	c
London	c
had	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
propaganda	i
had	i
written	c
that	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
are	c
supposed	i
to	i
be	i
the	c
actors	c
,	c
and	c
in	c
the	c
theatre	c
had	i
totally	c
differents	i
actors	c
.	c

Other	i
thing	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
complement	i
is	i
about	i
the	c
time	c
of	c
the	c
theatre	i
.	c

It	c
is	c
true	c
that	c
science	c
and	c
technology	c
affects	c
our	c
lives	c
a	c
lot	c
.	c

The	i
technology	i
is	c
essencial	i
to	c
our	c
life	c
,	c
we	c
need	c
it	c
on	i
each	c
minute	c
,	c
on	i
each	c
second	c
.	c

Good	c
because	c
you	c
can	c
have	c
acess	i
to	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
informations	i
,	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
bad	c
because	c
the	c
computers	c
are	c
getting	i
the	i
people	c
's	c
work	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
our	c
parents	c
had	c
time	c
to	c
played	i
with	c
dolls	c
or	c
toys	c
,	c
and	c
the	c
new	c
generation	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
time	c
for	c
this	c
,	c
because	c
they	c
spend	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
time	c
in	c
front	c
of	c
televisions	c
that	c
only	c
shows	i
silly	c
programmes	c
.	c

We	c
are	i
really	c
appriciate	i
about	i
giving	i
very	i
nice	c
program	i
,	c
which	c
is	i
organised	c
by	c
your	i
this	c
time	c
.	c

Especially	i
River	i
trip	c
to	c
Greenwich	c
makes	c
us	c
very	c
excited	c
and	c
we	c
are	c
really	c
looking	c
to	c
forwold	i

have	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
to	c

latest	i

Could	c
you	c

Also	c
another	c
interesting	c
things	i
was	c
to	i
know	i
about	c
their	c
culture	c
,	c
because	c
all	c
of	c
them	c
come	c
from	c
Peru	c
,	c
Bolivia	c
,	c
Ecuador	c
,	c
Chile	c
and	i
Uruguay	c
.	c

At	c
the	c
concert	c
they	c
were	c
very	c
susscceful	i
because	c
they	c
were	c
very	c
confident	c
and	c
I	c
helped	c
with	c
the	c
sound	c
system	c
and	c
our	c
equipment	c
was	c
extraordinary	c
and	c
the	c
audience	c
were	c
fantastic	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
to	c
tell	c
that	i
I	c
saw	c
your	c
musical	c
show	c
,,Over	i
the	c
rainbow	i
"	c
and	c
there	c
were	c
too	c
many	c
disappointing	c
divergences	c
between	c
the	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
show	c
and	c
the	c
show	c
itself	c
.	c

Please	c
reply	c
at	c
your	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

When	c
I	c
saw	i
modern	c
technology	c
I	i
mean	c
Internet	i
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
I	c
live	c
in	c
Kursk	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
can	c
get	c
a	c
letter	c
from	c
my	c
friend	c
after	i
some	i
hours	i
since	i
he	c
has	c
written	c
it	c
.	c

My	c
friend	c
lives	c
in	c
Kresnodar	c
.	c

And	c
it	c
takes	c
3	c
days	c
to	i
her	c
letter	c
to	c
get	c
to	c
Kursk	c
.	c

Another	c
change	c
in	c
my	c
life	c
is	c
that	c
I	c
use	c
Internet	i
as	c
a	c
library	c
when	c
I	c
write	c
my	c
course	c
papers	c
.	c

So	c
that	c
I	c
can	c
get	c
books	c
which	c
is	i
impossible	c
to	c
get	c
in	c
libraries	i
of	c
my	c
town	c
.	c

That	c
is	c
why	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
modern	c
techology	i
helps	c
me	c
in	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
.	c

Dear	c
Ms.	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
:	c

This	c
is	c
the	c
first	c
time	c
I	c
won	c
a	c
prize	c
in	c
these	i
kind	c
of	c
competitions	i
so	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
clear	i
some	i
doubts	i
.	c

Second	c
,	c
I	c
use	i
to	c
go	c
to	c
Camps	c
where	c
they	c
only	c
used	c
log	c
cabins	c
so	c
I	c
prefer	c
if	i
it	c
is	c
possible	c
to	i
be	c
in	c
tents	i
,	c
because	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
original	i
experience	c
.	i

Third	c
,	c
I	c
love	c
playing	c
basketball	c
,	i
I	c
am	c
a	c
great	c
player	c
and	c
I	c
play	c
with	i
my	c
University	c
and	c
I	c
like	c
to	c
be	c
playing	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
so	c
this	i
activity	i
I	i
will	i
not	i
missed	i
.	c

I	c
think	c
is	i
very	c
cool	c
and	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
learn	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
know	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothe	i
I	c
will	c
need	c
and	c
if	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
money	i
for	i
shops	c
or	c
markets	c
.	c

Looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

Jason	c
Andre	c

I	c
will	i
have	c
to	c
be	i
waiting	i
until	c
my	c
mother	c
decides	i
which	c
is	c
the	c
best	c
place	c
to	c
buy	c
her	c
dress	c
.	c

She	c
will	i
see	c
if	c
it	c
is	c
pretty	c
or	c
not	c
,	c
if	c
it	c
is	c
in	i
discount	i
at	c
other	i
store	c
we	i
will	i
not	c
buy	c
the	c
dress	c
and	c
we	c
will	i
have	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
other	c
store	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
other	c
dress	c
,	c
but	c
at	i
the	i
final	i
of	i
seeing	c
all	c
the	c
stores	c
and	c
looking	c
all	i
the	c
dresses	c
she	c
will	i
decided	i
for	i
the	c
first	c
we	i
saw	c
.	c

It	c
is	i
horrible	c
.	c

Is	i
like	c
a	c
nightmare	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
pleased	c
to	c
hear	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
and	c
writing	i
to	c
you	c
to	c
offer	c
additional	c
information	c
,	c
as	c
requested	c
.	c

I	c
also	c
prefer	c
staying	c
in	c
log	c
cabins	c
to	c
tents	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
once	c
experienced	c
to	i
have	i
been	c
soaked	c
while	c
I	c
was	c
sleeping	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
dut	i
to	c
heavy	c
rain	c
several	c
years	c
ago	c
.	c

As	c
for	c
my	c
activities	c
,	c
as	c
I	c
took	c
up	c
playing	c
golf	c
since	i
I	c
was	c
a	c
child	c
and	c
now	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
single-handicapped	c
player	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
have	c
chance	i
to	c
play	c
golf	c
at	c
camp	c
.	c

What	c
's	c
the	c
weather	c
like	c

California	c

I	c
would	c
be	c
really	c
greateful	i
if	c
you	c
could	c
send	c
me	c
some	c
information	c
or	c
any	c

I	c
look	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

I	c
've	c
been	c
busy	c
preparing	c
English	i
exams	c
.	c

You	c
remember	c
I	c
helped	c
people	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
as	c
a	c
nurse	c
last	c
month	c
?	c

You	c
ca	c
n't	c
imagine	c
how	c
happy	c
I	c
am	c
to	c
have	c
had	c
such	c
a	c
wonderful	c
chance	i
.	c

As	c
you	c
know	c
,	c
I	c
've	c
not	c
been	c
keen	c
on	c
pop	c
music	c
-	c
I	c
've	c
always	c
thought	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
only	c
noisy	c
but	c
also	c
even	c
rubbish	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
not	c
until	c
the	c
concert	c
that	c
I	c
became	c
a	c

It	c
was	c
really	c
great	c
to	c
have	c
talked	c
with	c
famous	c
pop	c
singers	c
,	c
bands	c

and	c
TV	c
stars	c

We	c
usually	c
are	c
apt	c
to	c
think	c
famous	c
stars	c
to	c
be	c
arrogant	c
and	c
nasty	c
,	c
but	c
they	c
were	c
n't	c
at	c
all	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
absolutely	c
our	c
prejudice	c
.	c

They	c
were	c
very	c
kind	c
,	c
soft	c
,	c
well-behaved	c
,	c
even	c
modest	c

Their	c
attitudes	c
towards	c
people	c

their	c

their	c
songs	c

everything	c
was	c
really	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Jones	c
:	c

I	c
'm	c
writting	i
you	i
because	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
what	c
a	c
bad	c
experience	c
I	c
had	c
during	c
my	c
holidays	c
when	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
play	c
on	c
your	i
theatre	c
.	c

To	c
begin	c
with	c
,	c
the	c
actor	c
you	c
publised	i
was	i
going	c
to	c
perform	c
,	c
did	c
n't	c
.	c

Considering	c
all	c
this	c
,	c
and	c
especially	c
the	c
fact	c
that	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
get	c
a	c
discount	c
on	c
my	c
ticket	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
the	c
least	c
you	c
can	c
do	c
is	c
give	c
me	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
to	c
make	c
it	c
up	c
to	c
me	c
,	c
and	c
so	c
I	c
can	c
go	c
an	i
spend	c
the	c
money	c
in	i
a	c
good	c
play	c
when	i
they	c
do	c
what	c
they	c
've	c
promised	c

Modern	c
technology	c
is	c
,	c
nowadays	c
,	c
not	c
only	c
a	c
"	c
tool	c
"	c
for	c
every	i
day	i
life	c
but	c
also	c
a	c
lifestyle	c
.	c

People	c
are	c
getting	c
more	c
and	c
more	c
adicted	i
to	c
this	c
,	c
because	c
helps	i
every	i
day	i
life	c
to	i
be	i
easier	c
and	c
more	c
confortable	i
.	c

In	c
my	c
own	c
personal	c
experience	c
,	c
technology	c
is	c
something	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
live	c
without	c
.	c

From	i
a	c
simple	c
domestic	c
appliance	c
,	c
a	c
TV	c
or	c
a	c
radio	c
to	i
a	c
cell	c
phone	c
or	c
a	c
computer	c
,	c
my	c
life	c
is	c
much	c
better	c
now	c
than	c
it	c
was	c
before	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
whenever	c
I	c
go	c
out	c
by	c
myself	c
,	c
my	c
father	c
gives	c
me	c
a	c
cell	c
phone	c
,	c
to	c
call	c
him	c
in	c
case	c
I	c
need	c
anything	c
.	c

Another	c
thing	c
I	c
depend	c
on	c
is	c
the	c
computer	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
anything	c
that	c
can	c
make	c
our	c
lifes	i
better	c
,	i
should	c
be	c
done	c
,	c
because	c
that	c
way	c
we	c
would	i
n't	i
have	c
so	c
many	c
things	c
to	c
be	c
concerned	c
about	c
,	c
and	c
we	c
would	i
be	c
able	c
to	c
live	c
a	c
happier	c
and	c
more	c
relaxed	c
life	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

I	c
've	c
been	i
recently	i
to	c
one	c
of	c
yours	i
musical	c
shows	c
called	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
"	c
in	i
the	c
Circle	c
theatre	c
in	c
London	c
thinking	i
it	c
might	c
be	c
a	c
good	c
idea	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
desappointing	i
.	c

Despite	c
saying	c
it	c
will	i
start	c
at	c
19:30	c
,	c
it	c
done	i
at	c
20:15	c
which	i
I	c
think	c
is	c
to	i
much	i
late	c
for	c
a	c
good	c
theatre	c
like	c
yours	c
.	c

After	i
,	c
you	c
say	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
to	i
visit	i
your	c
restaurant	c
,	c
however	c
it	i
was	c
close	i
,	i
how	i
can	c
you	c
explain	c
that	c
?	c

And	c
to	i
sum	i
up	i
,	c
there	c
were	c
n't	c
discounts	i
on	c
the	c
prices	c
of	c
the	c
tickets	c
.	c

She	c
answered	c
to	i
me	i
becouse	i
all	c
this	c
year	c
I	i
have	c
been	c
so	c
irritated	i
that	c
I	i
got	c
angry	c
with	c
every	i
person	i
who	c
tried	c
to	c
talk	c
to	c
me	i
,	c
and	i
the	c
others	i
friend	i
had	c
convinced	c
her	c
to	c
let	i
me	i
out	i
.	c

If	c
Pat	c
had	c
been	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
n't	c
have	c
known	c
anything	c
about	c
the	c
concert	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
n't	c
have	c
got	c
angry	c
for	i
not	c
being	c
able	c
to	c
go	c
.	c

And	c
that	c
's	c
the	c
history	i
of	c
how	c
I	c
lose	i
the	c
oportunity	i
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
only	c
concert	c
that	c
Oasis	c
had	i
done	i
in	c
my	c
city	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
,	c

However	c
,	c
we	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
suggest	c
you	i
something	c
:	c

What	c
do	c
you	c
think	c
about	c
our	c
jobs	c
?	c

It	c
would	c
be	c
all	i
the	i
more	i
interesting	c
for	c
us	c
as	c
fashion	c
is	c
a	i
great	c
interest	c
for	c
people	c
from	i
our	c
age	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
agree	c
,	c
we	c
will	c
only	c
have	c
to	c
change	c
the	c
programme	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
afternoon	c
:	c
I	c
mean	c
that	c
instead	c
of	c
shopping	c
,	c
we	c
would	c
go	c
to	c
this	c
exhibition	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
guess	c
that	c
neither	c
us	i
nor	c
you	c
would	c
be	c
against	c
the	c
sacrifice	c
of	c
a	c
"	c
Shopping-Afternoon	c
"	c
-	c
that	c
we	c
can	c
even	c
put	i
on	c
Wednesday	c
during	c
the	i
free-time	i
-	c
so	c
that	c
to	i
enjoy	c
the	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
...	c

The	c
respect	i
of	c
Famous	c
people	c
's	c
private	c
life	i
has	c
always	c
been	c
a	c
hot	c
topic	c
...	c

The	c
only	c
difference	c
between	c
them	c
and	c
us	c
is	c
the	c
kind	c
of	c
job	c
they	c
are	c
doing	c
which	i
is	c
literally	c
a	c
"	c
public	c
job	c
"	c
.	c

Therefore	c
,	c
why	c
do	c
we	c
have	c
to	c
talk	c
and	c
gossip	c
about	c
them	c
?	c
!	c

And	c
here	c
comes	c
the	c
paradox	i
:	c
Do	c
we	c
have	c
to	c
reveal	i
someone	c
's	c
privacy	c
to	c
judge	c
his	c
work	c
and	c
appreciate	c
him	c
?	c

As	c
far	c
as	c
I	c
'm	c
concerned	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
say	c
that	c
famous	c
people	c
made	c
the	c
choice	i
to	c
be	c
followed	c
and	c
tracked	c
by	c
journalists	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
,	c
when	c
they	c
chose	c
to	c
be	c
famous	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
add	c
that	c
journalists	c
-	c
being	c
aware	c
of	c
that	c
hard	i
topic	i
-	c
should	c
try	c
to	c
modorate	i
what	c
they	c
write	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
respect	c
altrui	i
's	i
privacy	c
;	c
since	c
they	c
would	c
probably	c
not	c
be	c
glad	i
to	c
have	c
their	c
own	c
private	c
life	c
revealed	i
!	c

But	c
to	c
solve	c
this	c
problem	c
,	c
we	c
may	i
think	c
first	c
about	c
its	c
origin	c
...	c

Therefore	c
we	c
should	c
try	c
to	c
educate	c
ourselves	c
so	c
as	c
to	c
respect	c
altrui	i
in	i
his	i
privacy	i
.	c

Why	c
not	c
?	c

To	c
conclude	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
say	c
that	c
"	c
privacy	c
"	c
and	c
"	c
celebrity	c
"	c
ca	c
n't	c
go	c
together	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

My	c
name	c
is	c
*	c
*	c
*	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
was	c
completely	c
wrong	c
.	c

We	c
were	c
there	c
at	c
19:15	c
as	i
the	c
show	c
was	c
starting	c
at	c
19:30	c
for	i
getting	i
our	c
tickets	c
.	c

We	c
asked	c
for	c
the	c
discounts	c
you	c
were	i
refering	i
at	i
your	c
advertisement	c
but	c
the	i
counter	c
told	i
us	c
that	c
they	c
were	c
not	c
available	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
Sunday	c
.	c

That	c
was	c
terrible	c
but	c
we	c
did	c
n't	c
want	c
to	c
make	i
a	i
big	i
deal	i
of	i
it	i
so	c
we	c
went	c
inside	c
and	c
waiting	i
.	c

The	c
show	c
started	c
forty-five	c
minutes	c
later	c
.	c

From	i
all	c
these	c
reasons	c
you	c
can	c
understand	c
how	c
unpleasant	c
our	c
evening	c
.	i

was	c
We	i
are	c
asking	c
you	c
to	c
return	c
our	c
money	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

She	c
was	c
about	c
sixteen	c
years	c
old	c
when	c
she	c
moved	c
to	c
another	c
city	c
with	c
her	c
family	c
.	c

She	c
was	c
not	c
very	c
sociable	c
and	c
she	c
could	c
not	c
create	i
relationships	c
very	c
easily	c
.	c

Pat	c
was	c
wondering	c
why	c
and	c
one	c
day	c
she	c
found	c
out	c
.	c

Pat	c
Kept	i
this	c
a	c
secret	c
for	c
two	c
months	c
but	c
one	c
day	c
told	i
it	c
by	c
accident	c
to	c
a	c
boy	c
from	i
her	c
class	c
.	c

In	c
a	c
few	c
days	c
all	c
school	i
was	i
familiar	i
with	i
Kim	c
's	c
story	c
.	c

She	c
had	c
to	c
find	c
a	c
way	c
to	c
make	c
Kim	c
forgive	c
her	c
.	c

She	c
stand	i
up	c
infront	i
of	c
the	c
whole	c
classroom	i
and	c
explained	c
that	c
Kim	c
's	c
father	i
actions	c
did	c
n't	c
influence	i
Kim	c
.	c

Kim	c
forgave	c
her	c
and	c
all	c
the	c
students	c
understand	i
how	c
wrong	c
they	c
were	i
and	c
were	c
very	c
sorry	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
.	i

However	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
disappointed	c
with	c
something	i
which	i
did	i
not	i
match	i
your	i
advertisement	i
.	c

We	c
waited	c
for	c
ages	c
because	c
we	c
had	c
not	c
been	c
informed	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
staff	c
trainning	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
sure	c
you	c
can	c
understand	c
my	c
disappointment	c
.	c

Unless	c
I	c
hear	c
from	c
you	c
within	c
ten	c
days	c
,	c
I	c
shall	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
legal	c
advice	c
on	c
the	i
matter	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
in	c
the	c
near	c
future	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

It	c
is	c
very	c
difficult	c
to	c
cook	c
and	c
wash	c
dishes	c
after	c
working	c
.	c

Before	c
buying	c
my	c
dishwasher	c
I	c
asked	c
my	c
son	c
to	c
wash	c
them	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
computers	c
are	c
useful	c
for	c
us	c
as	c
well	c
,	c
because	c
we	c
do	c
not	c
need	c
to	c
go	c
somewhere	c
if	c
we	c
want	c
to	c
have	i
information	c
,	c
for	c
example	c
traveling	i
.	c

However	c
my	i
family	i
's	i
members	c
do	c
less	i
communicate	i
with	i
each	i
other	i
than	c
we	i
used	c
to	c
,	c
because	c
my	c
children	c
are	c
keen	c
on	c
playing	c
computer	c
games	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
the	i
morden	i
technology	c
make	i
our	c
life	i
style	i
combinient	i
.	c

It	c
is	c
very	c
good	c
for	c
us	c
but	c
I	c
think	c
we	c
should	c
think	c
about	i
more	c
carefully	c
when	c
we	c
buy	c
something	c
for	c
our	c
children	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
for	i
explaining	i
some	c
problems	c
I	c
had	c
when	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
to	c
see	c
one	c
of	c
your	c
company	c
's	c
musical	c
shows	c
called	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
"	c
.	c

I	c
got	i
very	c
disappointed	c
when	c
I	c
discovered	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
was	c
not	c
going	c
to	c
play	c
and	i
a	c
different	c
actor	c
would	c
play	c
instead	i
of	c
him	c
.	c

Another	c
problem	c
was	c
the	i
start	c
of	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

You	c
should	c
review	c
the	c
advertisements	c
you	c
do	c
because	c
you	c
give	c
wrong	i
information	c
.	c

When	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
over	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
have	c
dinner	c
to	i
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
but	c
I	c
found	c
it	c
closed	c
because	c
your	c
company	c
is	c
lacked	i
of	i
employees	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
if	c
I	c
could	c
have	c
some	c
money	c
back	c
for	c
these	c
problems	c
I	c
have	c
told	c
you	c
.	i

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

Two	c
days	c
ago	c
I	c
thought	c
I	c
could	c
trust	c
Pat	c
because	c
she	c
was	c
not	c
going	c
to	c
tell	c
anybody	c
our	c
secret	c
,	c
our	c
important	c
secret	c
.	c

All	i
began	c
when	c
,	c
three	c
days	c
ago	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
doing	c
homework	i
in	c
my	c
class	i
.	c

It	c
was	c
Paul	c
,	c
my	c
teacher	c
,	c
who	c
came	c
to	c
see	c
what	c
I	c
was	c
doing	c
there	c
.	c

He	c
was	c
going	c
down	c
the	c
stairs	c
wearing	c
his	c
blue	c
jacket	c
.	c

"	c
See	c
you	c
tomorrow	c
!	c
"	c

Then	c
,	c
while	c
I	c
was	c
going	c
back	c
to	c
my	c
class	i
I	c
saw	c
he	c
had	c
n't	c
switched	c
off	c
the	c
light	c
of	i
his	c
room	c
.	c

As	c
soon	c
as	c
I	c
entered	c
that	c
room	c
I	c
realised	c
he	c
had	c
forgotten	i
our	c
exams	c
there	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
n't	c
believe	c
my	c
eyes	c
!	c

The	c
exams	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
next	i
day	c
were	c
there	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
told	c
her	c
this	i
piece	i
of	i
news	c
,	c
she	c
got	i
surprised	c
.	c

We	c
thought	c
we	c
should	c
n't	c
tell	c
it	i
anybody	c
else	c
.	c

Next	c
day	c
in	i
the	c
morning	c
,	c
before	c
the	c
exam	c

we	c
were	c
going	c
to	c
put	c
the	c
exam	c
back	c
with	c
the	c
other	c
exams	c
.	c

Next	c
day	c
,	c
everybody	c
knew	c
about	c
my	c
great	c
finding	i
because	c
Pat	c
had	c
n't	c
kept	c
our	c
secret	c
.	c

The	c
problem	c
was	c
that	c
my	c
teacher	c
also	c
knew	c
it	i
because	c
someone	c
had	c
told	c
him	c
"	c
the	c
story	c
of	c
the	c
exams	i

,	c
as	c
he	c
called	c
my	c
big	c
problem	c

He	c
told	c
me	c
I	c
had	c
done	c
wrong	c
taking	c
the	c
exam	i
but	c
I	c
think	c
the	c
only	c
thing	c
I	c
did	c
wrong	c
was	c
telling	c
Pat	c
my	c
important	c
secret	c
.	c

Dear	c
Ms	c
Ryan	c

First	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
able	i
to	i
come	i
only	i
in	c
July	c
,	c
because	c
my	c
examination	c
session	c
is	c
due	c
from	c
the	c
24	c
June	c
till	c
26	c
June	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
be	c
accomodated	i
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
as	c
do	i
not	c
like	c
sleeping	c
on	c
the	i
mattres	i
and	c
I	c
get	c
allergy	i
to	c
rubber	c
.	c

I	c
won	c
third	c
prize	c
in	c
competition	i
organized	c
by	c
our	c
college	c
.	c

Could	c
you	c
,	c
pleas	i
send	c
me	c
some	c
extra	c
information	c
regarding	c
the	c
ammount	i
of	c
money	c
I	c
should	c
take	c
to	c
cover	c
any	c
other	c
expenses	c
,	c
and	c
also	c
,	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
should	c
take	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Is	c
shopping	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
?	c

There	c
are	c
different	c
opinions	c
and	c
points	c
of	c
view	c
.	c

I	c
like	c
shopping	c
very	c
much	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
large	c
supermarkets	c
with	c
dishes	c
ready	c
to	c
eat	c
.	c

Even	c
if	c
you	c
do	c
not	c
have	c
any	c
cooking	c
skills	c
you	c
can	c
enjoy	c
exotic	c
meals	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
some	c
people	c
complain	c
that	c
there	c
are	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
artificial	c
products	c
,	c
which	c
are	c
quite	c
unhealthy	c
,	c
but	c
very	c
expensive	c
.	c

You	c
can	c
always	c
ask	c
for	c
good	c
advice	c
from	c
the	c
experienced	c
shop	c
attendants	i
,	c
which	c
does	c
not	c
necessarily	c
cost	c
you	c
extra	c
money	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
someone	c
else	c
may	c
say	c
,	c
it	c
takes	c
too	c
much	c
time	c
.	c

I	c
always	c
take	c
my	c
friend	c
with	c
me	c
so	c
we	c
can	c
chat	c
or	c
have	c
coffee	c
in	c
the	c
shop	c
's	c
cafe	c
.	c

Although	c
my	c
brother	c
thinks	c
the	c
better	c
way	c
to	c
have	c
fun	c
is	c
to	c
watch	c
TV	c
than	c
to	c
be	c
pushed	c
in	c
crowded	c
shops	c
,	c
I	c
do	c
not	c
agree	c
.	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
I	i
agree	c
that	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
,	c
but	c
for	c
me	c
it	c
is	c
and	c
I	c
like	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
express	c
my	c
dissatisfaction	c
with	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
which	c
the	c
Circle	c
Threatre	i
has	i
presented	i
.	c

In	c
the	c
advertisment	i
,	c
I	c
had	c
read	c
that	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
was	c
starring	c
but	c
she	i
was	c
not	c
.	c

A	c
different	c
actor	c
was	c
playing	i
durring	i
the	c
musical	c
and	c
he	c
was	c
very	c
disappointing	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
not	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

He	c
and	c
his	c
friends	c
got	c
in	i
trouble	c
because	c
of	c
this	c
habit	c
,	i
last	c
week	c
.	c

The	c
children	c
were	c
very	c
unhappy	c
and	c
sorry	i
about	i
the	c
pet	c
.	c

"	c
Somebody	c
had	i
hurt	i
her	c
and	c
had	i
let	i
her	c
without	c
help	c
"	c
Mourk	i
said	c
angrily	c
.	c

"	c
We	c
have	c
to	c
find	c
him	c
and	c
make	c
him	c
pay	c
for	c
his	c
action	c
"	c
Sally	i
told	c
them	c
.	c

"	c
Yes	c
,	c
Oh	i
Lord	c
he	c
did	c
it	c
because	c
we	c
won	i
his	c
team	c
at	c
football	c
"	c
Nick	i
said	c
.	c

"	c
He	c
is	c
so	c
bad	c
.	c

Hey	c
Listen	i
guys	c
we	i
will	c
take	c
his	c
dog	c
which	c
love	i
very	c
much	c
and	c
we	c
will	c
sell	c
it	c
to	c
Sally	c
who	c
wants	c
one	c
.	c

We	c
will	c
pay	c
Curly	c
's	c
doctor	i
with	c
these	i
money	c
that	c
we	c
will	i
earn	i
"	c
Pat	i
said	c
.	c

Next	c
morning	c
as	i
Pat	c
was	c
going	c
to	c
school	c
met	i
Bad	c
Jon	c
.	i

Bad	c
Jon	c
understood	c
and	c
talked	c
immediately	c
to	c
his	c
father	c
.	i

who	c
was	c
the	c
school	c
minister	i
about	c
the	c
children	i
'	i
plan	c
.	c

Of	c
course	c
they	c
were	c
punished	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
the	c
good	c
programme	c
which	c
you	c
have	c
organised	c
.	c

and	c
we	c
would	c
all	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
this	c
show	c
.	c

First	c
there	c
is	c
a	c
show	c
with	c
latest	i
fashions	c
,	c
after	c
they	c
show	c
us	i
the	i
leisure	c
and	c
sports	i
wear	i
and	c
then	c
there	c
are	c
the	c
make	i
up	i
and	c
the	c
hairstyles	c
shows	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
in	c
advance	c
for	c
your	c
trouble	i

Yours	c
sincerely	c

your	c
English	c
Class	c
4A	c

Now	c
,	c
we	c
are	c
in	c
the	c
21th	i
century	c
.	c

Most	c
of	c
us	c
live	c
in	c
houses	c
or	c
flats	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
most	i
very	c
comfortable	c
.	c

What	c
will	c
be	c
different	c
and	c
what	c
wont	i
change	c
?	c

We	c
can	i
need	c
our	c
imagination	c
for	i
answering	i
these	c
questions	c
but	c
we	c
will	c
never	c
know	c
the	c
right	c
answer	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
further	i
ideas	c
:	i
In	c
the	c
futur	i
,	c
maybe	c
in	c
2113	c
,	c
there	c
will	c
are	i
houses	c
like	c
now	c
but	c
only	i
with	c
more	c
technical	c
things	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
people	c
wont	i
have	c
to	c
clean	c
their	c
houses	c
because	c
there	c
are	i
machine	i
for	c
all	c
works	i
.	c

But	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
people	c
will	c
altough	i
need	c
a	c
bed	c
and	c
a	c
table	c
with	c
a	c
chair	c
.	c

These	c
things	c
and	c
a	c
lot	c
more	c
went	i
change	c
or	c
wont	i
be	c
forgotten	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
.	i

houses	c
only	i
will	i
be	c
more	c
moderne	i
and	c
more	c
practique	i
but	c
not	c
very	c
different	c
from	c
our	c
home	i
in	c
the	c
present	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

Last	c
night	c
,	c
me	c
and	c
my	c
family	c
visited	c
your	c
theatre	c
,	c
and	c
we	c
had	c
a	c
very	c
disappointing	c
evening	c

In	c
the	c
advertisement	c
the	c
time	c
when	c
the	c
show	c
should	c
start	c
was	c
19.30	c
but	c
it	c
started	c
20:15	i
.	c

When	c
I	c
arrived	c
to	i
theatre	i
and	c
ask	i
for	c
the	c
discount	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
available	c
.	c

In	c
your	c
adv	i

starring	i
was	i
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
and	c
on	c
the	c
stage	c
plaied	i
different	i
actor	i
and	c
his	c
play	i
was	c
very	c
poor	c
.	c

When	c
we	c
decided	c
to	c
visit	c
theatre	i
Restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
it	c
was	c
clouse	i
because	c
same	i
of	i
decorating	c
was	c
n't	c
finish	i
.	c

It	c
was	c
last	i
poin	i
to	i
get	i
me	c
angry	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
n't	c
perfect	i
evening	c
out	c
,	c
how	i
you	c
did	i
promise	i
in	c
your	c
a	c
advertisement	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
want	c
ask	i
for	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

Alexy	c
Pasimov	c

They	c
were	i
used	i
just	i
a	c
candle	c
.	c

Nobody	c
can	i
thinking	i
about	c
the	c
Telephone	c
,	c
and	c
telegraph	c
.	c

From	c
small	i
village	c
to	c

was	c
very	i
long	c
way	c
becouse	i
the	i
people	c
used	c

And	c

Evrything	i

difficult	c
operation	i
,	c
becose	i
the	c
computer	c
can	c
think	c
much	c
faster	c
then	i
human	i
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

We	c
have	c
had	c
a	c
quite	c
pleasant	c
time	c
except	c
the	i
evening	c
.	c

Actually	c
it	c
spoiled	c
our	c
time	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
get	c
back	c
our	c
money	c
.	c

These	c
are	c
some	c
points	c
I	c
want	c
mention	i
about	c
the	c
differencies	i
between	c
the	i
advertisement	c
said	c
and	c
the	c
realities	c
.	c

First	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
great	c
expectation	c
to	c
see	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
plays	i
his	c
role	c
,	c
but	c
he	c
had	c
never	c
shown	c
up	c
that	c
night	c
.	c

The	c
main	c
actor	c
was	c
an	c
unknown	c
actor	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
a	i
such	i
disappointing	i
.	c

It	c
was	c
45	c
minutes	c
later	c
than	c
it	c
suppose	i
to	c
be	c
.	c

Third	c
,	c
there	c
was	c
no	c
possibility	c
of	c
discount	i
.	c

Forth	i
,	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

There	c
was	c
a	c
not	i
on	c
the	c
door	c
saying	c
that	c
the	i
painting	c
was	c
going	c
on	c
the	i
weekend	c
.	c

How	c
could	c
you	c
arrange	c
work	c
like	c
that	c
?	c

It	c
was	c
most	i
imperfect	c
evening	c
out	c
I	c
ever	c
exprienced	i
.	c

I	c
wish	i
that	c
you	c
can	c
provide	c
a	c
better	c
service	c
next	c
time	c
,	c
and	c
this	c
time	c
you	c
need	c
give	i
back	c
the	c
money	c
we	c
paid	c
.	c

First	c
it	c
was	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
culture	c
difference	c
.	c

It	c
took	c
quite	c
long	i
time	c
to	c
adjust	c
in	i
the	c
multi	i
culture	i
in	c
the	c
language	c
institue	i
.	c

Secondly	c
the	c
language	c
ability	c
was	c
another	c
issue	c
.	c

I	c
really	c
wished	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
friend	c
can	i
share	c
everything	c
is	i
going	c
in	i
our	c
lives	c
.	c

Finally	c
I	c
met	c
Pat	c
.	c

One	c
day	c
she	c
realized	c
that	c
I	c
was	c
always	c
been	i
outside	c
of	c
circle	i
.	c

Even	i
we	i
could	i
make	c
a	c
trip	c
to	c
Paris	c
in	c
the	c
school	c
holiday	c
!	c

We	c
had	c
many	c
common	c
interests	c
in	c
music	c
,	c
art	c
and	c
books	c
.	c

There	c
were	c
some	c
stories	c
I	c
never	c
told	c
anyone	c
before	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
had	i
share	i
with	c
her	c
all	c
my	c
secrets	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
nightmare	c
!	c

June	c
13th	c
,	c
2000	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
glad	c
for	i
receiving	i
such	c
a	c
wonderful	c
surprise	c
,	i
that	i
I	c
have	c
won	c
first	c
prize	c
.	c

About	c
the	c
information	c
you	c
asked	c
me	c
for	c
,	c
the	c
most	c
suitable	c
month	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
travel	c
would	c
be	c
July	c
,	c
since	c
it	c
is	c
when	c
I	c
am	c
free	c
for	i
traveling	i
due	i
to	i
I	c
wo	c
n't	c
have	c
classes	c
at	c
school	c
by	c
that	c
time	c
.	c

In	i
the	c
matter	c
of	c
accommodation	c
I	c
'd	c
rather	i
prefer	c
log	i
cabins	i
,	c
because	c
I	c
consider	c
them	c
better	c
for	c
resting	c
and	c
know	i
people	c
.	c

I	c
also	c
want	c
to	c
mention	c
that	c
it	c
's	c
great	c
you	c
have	c
so	c
many	c
activities	c

The	c
ones	c
I	c
consider	c
I	c
'm	c
good	c
at	c
are	c
painting	c
and	c
photography	c

I	c
have	c
something	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c

Do	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
any	c

which	c
I	c
have	c
received	c
with	c
a	i
great	c
delight	c
and	c
excitement	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
as	c
it	c
is	c
my	c
summer	c
holiday	c
and	c
I	c
believe	c
the	c
weather	c
would	c
be	c
best	c
for	c
camping	c
in	c
July	c
.	c

And	c
if	c
it	c
is	c
possible	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
rather	c
than	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
because	c
I	c
find	c
tents	c
uncomfortable	c
to	c
sleep	c
in	c
.	c

The	c
two	c
activities	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
do	c
at	c
the	c
Camp	c
are	c
Tennis	c
and	c
surfing	c
.	c

Before	c
I	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
Camp	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
what	c
type	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
take	c
and	c
wheather	i
there	c
is	c
anything	c
I	c
should	c
take	c
in	c
case	c
of	c
any	c
emergencies	c
.	c

Also	c
the	c
amount	c
of	c
money	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
bring	c
(	c
is	i
there	c
any	c
shops	c
)	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

We	c
were	c
all	c
given	c
different	c
sort	i
of	c
jobs	c
to	c
do	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
the	c
best	c
day	c
of	c
my	c
life	c
and	c
certainly	c
for	c
others	c
,	c
too	c
.	c

I	c
will	c
be	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
your	c
reply	c
.	c

Love	c
from	c

For	c
the	c
attention	c
to	i
the	c
manager	c
:	c
I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
organization	c
of	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
that	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
presented	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
said	c
that	c
the	c
stars	c
who	c
were	c
invited	i
to	i
the	i
estatement	i
were	c
Dany	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
,	c
the	c
event	i
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
start	c
at	c
19.30	c
but	c
we	c
could	c
not	c
enjoy	c
the	c
show	c
until	c
20.15	c
.	c

The	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
show	c
announced	c
that	c
we	c
were	i
able	c
to	c
visit	c
the	c
Theatre	c
restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
due	i
to	i
the	c
Chef	c
who	c
leaded	i
the	c
Restaurant	c
did	c
not	c
remember	c
to	c
bring	c
the	c
keys	c
to	c
open	c
it	c
.	c

Peter	c
had	c
a	c
terribly	i
problem	c
with	c
drugs	c
.	c

Australia	c
is	c
a	i
country	i
too	i
calm	i
for	c
him	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
he	c
began	c
to	c
run	c
around	c
the	c
crowd	c
and	c
also	c
to	c
hit	c
the	c
advertisements	c
which	c
announced	c
the	c
concert	c
.	c

A	c
security	c
guard	c
saw	c
it	i
and	c
put	i
his	c
attention	c
on	i
him	c
.	c

Pat	c
stared	c
at	c
him	c
and	c
asked	c
for	c
help	c
.	c

The	c
security	c
guard	c
heard	c
her	c
and	c
agreeded	i
with	c
Pat	c
that	c
if	c
Peter	c
continued	c
acting	c
on	i
this	c
way	c
he	c
would	c
obliged	i
us	c
to	c
go	i
out	i
of	i
the	c
concert	c
.	c

Thanks	c
for	c
you	i
letter	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
so	c
exciting	i
that	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
.	c

I	c
will	c
give	c
you	c
all	c
information	i
you	c
need	c
and	c
ask	c
some	c
questions	c
.	c

I	c
could	i
only	c
travel	c
on	i
July	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
have	c
booked	c
a	c
flight	c
to	i
home	c
at	c
the	c
beginning	c
of	c
Auguest	i
.	c

Because	c
I	c
never	i
live	i
in	c
tents	i
before	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
is	i
great	c
and	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
try	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
play	c
basketball	c
a	c
lot	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
member	c
of	c
our	c
college	c
term	i

And	c
also	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
ask	c
some	c
questions	c
.	c

How	c
much	c
money	c
should	c
I	c
taken	i
?	c

And	c
how	c
could	i
we	c
meet	c
at	c
the	c
airport	c
?	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
your	i
reply	c

about	c

,	c
I	c
write	i
this	c
report	c
to	c
suggest	c
some	c
lessons	c
and	c
activities	c
which	c
should	c
be	c
filmed	c

of	c
the	c

things	c
in	c

from	c

also	c

Canteen	c

You	c
ca	c
n't	c
forget	c
football	c

These	i
are	i
what	c
I	c
think	c
should	c
be	c
filmed	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
about	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
I	c
won	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
been	c
swimming	c
since	c
I	c
was	c
three	c
and	c
I	c
did	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
courses	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
had	i
a	c
course	c
of	i
climbing	c
even	c
though	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
take	c
up	c
this	c
hobby	c
.	c

I	c
bet	c
you	c
want	c
to	c
know	c
everything	c
about	c
my	c
great	c
experience	c
at	c
Luna	c
Pop	c
's	c
concert	c
last	c
month	c
.	c

But	c
maybe	c
you	c
want	c
to	c
hear	c
the	c
story	c
from	c
the	c
beginning	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
know	c
Luna	i
Pop	c
is	c
not	c
my	c
favourite	c
group	c
and	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
their	c
concert	c
only	c
because	c
Ake	c
needed	c
being	i
accompanied	c
.	c

When	c
we	c
arrived	c
she	c
persuaded	c
me	c
to	c
go	c
the	i
backstage	c
because	c
her	c
boyfriend	c
was	c
the	c
electrician	i
of	i
the	i
band	i
.	c

In	i
that	i
moment	i
Ake	c
exlaimed	i
that	c
I	c
could	c
play	c
the	c
piano	c
.	c

After	c
that	c
I	c
tried	c
to	c
tell	c
them	c
I	c
had	c
just	c
begun	c
but	i
within	c
five	c
minutes	c
I	c
was	c
on	c
the	c
stage	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
playing	c
that	c
,	c
luckily	c
,	c
easy	c
tune	c
.	c

I	c
wish	c
you	c
had	c
been	c
with	c
me	c
but	c
I	c
'm	c
sure	c
you	c
understand	c
what	c
I	c
felt	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Ryan	c
:	c

As	c
you	c
asked	c
me	c
to	c
send	c
you	c
further	c
information	c
about	c
three	c
points	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
sending	c
you	c
my	c
preferences	c
as	c
follows	c
:	c

1.	c
-	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
long	i
cabins	i
rather	c
than	c
tents	i
,	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
much	c
more	c
comfortable	c
.	c

2.	c
-	c
I	c
have	c
chosen	c
singing	c
and	c
painting	c
as	c
activities	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
love	c
painting	c
moreover	i
,	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
it	c
,	c
and	c
singing	c
because	c
is	i
one	c
of	c
my	c
talents	c
.	c

3.	c
-	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
travel	c
only	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
at	c
the	c
moment	c
I	c
am	c
alone	c
at	c
home	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
care	c
of	c
my	c
little	c
sister	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
,	i
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
do	i
I	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
with	c
me	c
and	c
How	i
much	c
money	c
will	c
I	c
need	c
as	i
well	i
?	c

Bety	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
what	c
an	c
impressing	i
experience	c
I	c
have	c
had	c
,	i
helping	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
.	c

I	c
will	c
start	c
telling	i
you	c
how	c
crowded	c
it	c
was	c
,	c
the	i
people	c
was	i
so	c
excited	c
that	c
they	c
were	c
screaming	c
from	c
the	c
beginning	c
to	c
the	c
end	c
.	c

I	c
tried	c
to	c
take	c
a	c
photo	c
of	c
everyone	c
,	c
but	c
sometimes	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
possible	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
'	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
'	i
I	i
've	i
visited	i
it	c
last	i
evening	c
in	c
your	c
'	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
'	c
.	c

I	c
believed	c
in	c
the	c
phrase	c
by	i
which	c
the	c
advertisement	c
ended	c
:	c
'	c
Your	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
!	c
'	c

The	c
show	c
should	c
started	i
at	c
half	c
past	c
7	c
pm	c
but	c
nothing	c
happened	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
be	c
gladly	i
to	c
get	c
an	c
answer	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Bergut	c
Hunrtner	c

Do	c
you	c
remember	c
what	c
people	c
wore	c
100	c
years	c
ago	c
?	c

And	c
by	c
the	c
way	c
do	i
you	c
believe	c
that	c
they	c
also	c
thought	c
the	c
fashion	c
never	c
changed	c
?	c

100	c
years	c
ago	c
the	i
people	c
wore	c
long	c
clothes	i
and	c
large	i
robes	i
.	c

You	c
can	c
say	c
they	c
wore	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
clothes	c
at	c
one	c
time	c
.	c

Nowaday	i
people	c
wear	c
lesser	i
clothes	c
.	c

Often	c
you	c
causes	i
very	c
litte	i
and	i
short	c
robes	i
and	c
tops	c
.	c

So	c
it	i
's	i
possible	c
to	c
wear	c
nothing	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
winter	c
you	c
'll	c
freeze	c
.	c

But	c
this	c
problem	c
is	c
solving	c
by	i
itselfes	i
.	c

But	c
by	i
some	c
situations	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
wear	c
something	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
possible	c
.	c

Your	c
advertisement	c
was	i
featuring	i
"	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
"	c
as	c
the	c
main	c
characters	c
but	c
in	c
fact	c
some	c
other	c
people	c
replaced	c
them	c
that	c
evening	c
.	c

Well	c
I	c
tried	c
to	c
do	c
so	c
but	c
the	c
lady	c
at	c
the	c
desk	c
told	c
me	c
that	c
they	i
were	i
quotas	i
available	i
at	c
that	c
price	c
but	c
were	c
already	c
sold	c
out	c

After	c
the	c
show	c
we	c
tried	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
your	c
restaurant	c
but	c
unfortunately	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c

MODERN	c
TECHNOLOGY	c

From	c

up	c

The	c

But	c
due	i

unknown	c
reasons	i

the	c

did	c

start	c
until	c
20:15	c

The	c

Shopping	c
...	c
a	c
great	c
and	c
emotion	i
statement	c
,	c
do	c
n't	c
you	c
think	c
?	c

Every	i
one	i
think	i
that	c
shopping	c
in	i
the	c
best	c
way	c
to	c
carry	i
off	i
your	c
problems	c
and	c
,	c
in	c
fact	c
a	c
big	c
solution	c
of	i
many	c
problem	i
or	c
estrés	i
,	c
boring	c
,	c
or	c
only	c
for	c
distraction	c
.	c

But	c
the	c
question	c
is	c
:	c
Why	i
shopping	i
is	i
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
?	c
.	i

For	c
many	c
people	c
,	c
shopping	c
had	i
always	c
been	c
only	c
for	c
one	c
kind	c
of	c
elite	c
,	c
or	c
social	c
class	c
;	c
not	c
all	c
people	c
can	c
go	c
shopping	c
and	c
buy	c
hundreds	c
and	c
thousands	c
of	c
stuff	i
in	c
those	c
big	c
malls	c
as	c
distraction	i
.	c

The	i
shopmania	i
is	c
really	c
unstapped	i
.	c

There	c
are	c
many	c
facts	c
to	c
prove	c
that	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
"	c
pretty	c
and	c
armonious	i
"	c
,	c
but	i
believe	c
me	c
,	c
is	i
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
becaus	i
I	c
was	c
very	c
disappointing	i
with	c
the	c
presentation	i
you	c
have	c
made	i
to	c
attract	c
people	c
to	c

Looking	c

hearing	c
from	c
you	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

I	c
had	c
the	c
best	c
month	c
in	i
my	c
life	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
hard	c
month	c
because	c
my	c
job	c
was	c
very	c
hard	c
,	i
I	c
worked	c
12	c
hours	c
per	c
day	c
but	c
alwalys	i
with	c
funny	i
people	c
.	c

I	c
felt	i
in	c
love	c
with	c
a	c
beautiful	c
girl	c
"	c
Calen	c
"	c
,	i
she	i
is	c
from	c
Spain	c
and	c
was	c
selling	c
"	c
hot	c
dogs	c
"	c
.	c

Probably	c
she	c
'll	c
come	c
with	c
a	c
friend	c
if	i
you	c
want	c
you	c
can	c
enjoy	i
us	c
.	c

You	c
have	c
to	c
save	c
up	c
money	i
because	c
Spain	c
is	c
too	c
expensive	c
(	c
beach	c
,	c
beer	c
,	c
discos..	c
)	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
I	i
want	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
I	c
'm	c
very	c
keen	c
on	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
who	c
was	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
main	c
reasons	c
why	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
come	i
.	c

However	c
my	i
favourite	c
actor	c
was	c
not	c
there	c
.	c

I	c
spent	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
time	c
waiting	c
for	c
the	c
show	c
to	c
start	c
.	c

I	c
really	c
do	c
understand	c
that	c
problems	c
can	c
always	c
come	c
up	c
but	c
it	c
would	c
not	c
have	c
been	c
a	c
problem	c
for	c
me	c
as	i
long	i
as	i
I	c
had	c
been	c
informed	c
about	c
it	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
what	c
should	c
have	c
been	c
a	c
nice	c
evening	c
out	c
came	i
to	i
a	c
nightmare	c
.	c

I	c
guess	c
all	c
my	c
reasons	c
are	c
more	c
than	c
enough	c
to	c
get	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
:	c

Firstly	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
talk	c
about	c
computers	c
.	c

A	c
couple	c
of	c
years	c
ago	c
I	c
bought	c
a	c
new	c
computer	c
and	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
learn	c
all	c
about	c
them	c
.	c

Even	c
though	c
it	c
was	c
my	c
first	c
one	c
I	c
managed	c
and	c
I	c
got	c
to	c
know	c
pretty	i
fast	i
the	i
way	i
they	i
work	i
.	c

I	c
'm	c
impressed	c
by	c
communications	c
as	c
well	c
.	c

Is	c
n't	c
that	c
amazing	c
?	c

I	c
should	c
not	c
forget	c
mobile	c
phones	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
extremly	i
happy	c
because	c
not	c
only	c
do	c
I	c
earn	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
money	c
but	c
also	c
I	c
'm	c
learning	c
a	c
lot	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
as	c
you	c
can	c
see	c
,	c
modern	c
technology	c
has	c
had	c
influence	i
in	i
my	c
life	c
.	c

this	i
prize	c
came	c
in	i
a	c
good	c
time	c
.	c

For	c
it	i
the	c
only	c
one	i
that	c
I	c
can	c
travel	c
is	c
July	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
love	c
sports	c
.	c

I	c
've	c
already	c
Won	i
three	c
prizes	c
about	i
it	c
.	c

And	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
about	i
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
to	c
take	c
and	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
to	c
take	c
too	c
.	c

We	c
had	c
a	c
class	c
discussion	c
about	c
shopping	c
,	c
for	i
it	c
I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
tell	i
about	c
my	c
opinion	c
.	c

I	c
love	c
shopping	c
mainly	c
when	c
I	c
am	c
alone	c
on	i
when	c
I	c
am	c
angry	c
because	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
can	c
help	c
me	c
to	c
relax	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
got	i
plenty	c
of	c
money	c
sometimes	c
I	c
like	c
spend	i
a	c
bit	c
of	c
it	c
with	c
some	c
friends	c
or	c
buying	c
a	c
good	c
present	c
for	c
my	c
girl	i
friend	i
.	c

Normally	c
I	c
spend	c
money	c
buying	c
some	c
new	c
clothes	c
that	c
I	c
like	c
more	i
and	c
shoes	c
I	i
love	c
new	c
shoes	c
.	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c
the	c
competition	c
Organiser	c
,	c

It	c
was	c
very	c
fortuanate	i
of	i
me	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
Camp	c
California	c
in	c
the	c
USA	c
only	c
in	c
July	c
as	c
it	c
is	c
my	c
summer	c
holidays	c
.	i

I	c
am	c
doing	c
this	c
subject	c
for	c
my	c
G.C.S.E.	i
so	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
very	c
helpful	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
practise	c
.	c

I	c
can	c
also	c
then	c
wake	c
up	c
in	c
the	c
morning	c
and	c
take	c
photographs	c
of	c
the	c
wonderful	c
sceneries	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
about	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
bring	c
and	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
have	c
bring	i
.	c

Will	c
there	c
be	c
any	c
shops	c
?	c

Please	c
could	c
you	c
send	c
me	c
an	c
itenerary	i
of	c
the	c
trip	c
?	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

The	c
clothes	c
are	c
quite	c
expensive	c
and	c
they	c
are	c
never	c
your	c
size	c
.	c

These	c
things	c
can	c
be	c
very	c
annoying	c
but	c
there	c
is	c
a	c
good	c
side	c
of	i
'	c
shopping	c
'	c
.	c

Maybe	c
we	c
will	c
have	c
robots	c
to	c
do	c
the	c
shopping	c
for	c
us	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
!	c

We	c
all	c
just	c
have	c
to	c
wait	c
and	c
see	c

That	c

very	c
disappointing	c

The	c

I	c
did	c
not	c
have	c

So	c
I	c

Techology	i

?	c

What	c
does	c

offer	c
to	c
us	c
?	c

Let	i
see	c
if	c
we	c
use	c
the	i
modern	c
technology	c
we	i
may	i
have	c
good	c

Dear	c

:	c

In	c
the	c
camp	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
log	i
cabins	i
because	c
I	c
hate	c
to	c

uncomfortable	i
and	c
,	i
I	c
will	c
if	c

stay	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c

I	c
prefere	i

The	c
manager	c
of	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c

Dear	c
manager	c
,	c

Now	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
explain	c
the	i
problems	c
.	c

It	c
was	i
also	i
told	i
that	c
the	c
evening	c
shows	c
are	i
starting	i
19.30	i
,	c
but	c
it	c
started	c
20.15	c
.	c

After	c
the	c
show	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
with	c
my	c
friends	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
of	c
illness	i
.	c

At	i
first	i
you	c
have	c
to	c
define	c
what	c
is	c
meant	c
by	c
'	c
modern	c
technology	c
'	c
.	c

For	c
me	c
modern	c
technology	c
are	i
things	c
like	c
personal	c
computers	c
,	c
mobile	c
phones	c
,	c
keyboards	c
,	c
video	c
recorders	c
,	c
Hifi	i
sound	c
systems	c
,	c
television	c
or	c
even	c
cars	c
.	c

My	c
oppinion	i
is	c
that	c
modern	c
technology	c
can	c
help	c
you	c
to	c
save	c
time	c
.	c

If	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
training	c
I	c
need	c
not	c
wait	c
for	c
the	c
bus	c
,	c
and	c
so	c
I	c
need	c
not	c
start	c
one	c
and	c
a	c
half	c
hour	i
before	c
training	c
I	i
start	c
a	i
half	i
hour	c
before	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
I	c
can	c
save	c
time	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
think	c
every	i
body	i
should	c
use	c
his	i
saved	i
time	i
for	c
things	c
like	c
hiking	c
,	c
walking	c
,	c
swimming	c
,	c
for	c
a	c
"	c
natural	c
life	c
"	c
and	c
not	c
for	c
a	c
life	c
in	c
a	c
technical	c
world	c
with	c
stress	c
and	c
sorrows	c
because	c
we	c
are	c
humans	c
and	c
not	c
robots	c
.	c

We	c
should	c
also	c
move	c
our	c
body	c
and	c
not	c
only	c
use	c
our	c
brain	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

Instead	c
of	c
them	c
you	c
had	c
different	c
actors	c
.	c

Then	c
the	c
show	c
delayed	i
,	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
,	c
not	c
at	c
19.30	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
to	c
wait	c
45	c
minutes	c
!	c

After	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
finished	c
,	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
drink	c
something	c
,	c
but	c
as	i
I	c
arrived	c
in	i
the	c
restaurant	c
it	c
had	c
been	c
closed	c
.	c

You	c
wrote	i
also	i
that	c
the	c
evening	c
would	c
be	c
perfect	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
ca	c
n't	c
give	c
me	c
all	c
the	c
money	c
back	c
then	c
do	c

Modern	c
technology	c
has	c
changed	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
in	c
the	c
point	i
that	c
all	i
I	c
do	c
is	c
becoming	c
more	i
comfortable	i
.	c

I	c
use	i
also	i
the	c
internet	i
when	c
I	c
need	c
any	c
informations	i
for	i
example	c
I	i
need	c
them	i
for	c
school	c
or	c
private	i
for	i
myself	c
.	c

Most	i
that	i
took	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
the	c
advantage	c
of	c
modern	c
technology	c
is	c
that	c
all	i
I	c
do	c
goes	c
very	c
fast	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
more	c
time	c
for	c
my	c
hobbys	i
or	c
for	c
friends	c
.	c

Another	c
important	c
point	c
for	c
me	c
is	c
that	c
things	c
like	c
listening	c
music	i
or	c
watching	c
TV	c
sounds	i
better	c
and	c
the	c
pictures	c
on	c
TV	c
are	c
being	c
impoved	i
,	c
because	c
the	c
machines	c
become	c
more	i
better	i
.	c

And	c
also	c
a	c
good	c
intention	i
for	c
me	c
is	c
the	c
Handy	i
,	c
because	c
everywhere	c
I	c
go	c
I	c
can	c
talk	c
to	c
other	c
people	c
.	c

Last	c
night	c
,	c
I	c
cam	i
to	c
your	c
musical	c
show	c
,	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
"	c
and	i
I	c
was	c
very	c
disappointed	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
what	i
you	c
writed	i
in	c
your	c
advertisement	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
your	c
advertisement	c
said	c
that	c
the	c
starring	i
were	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
,	c
but	c
at	c
the	c
show	c
they	c
were	c
not	c
them	i
!	c

They	i
were	c
Kevin	c
Starr	c
and	c
Jessica	c
Richmond	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
like	c
to	c
have	i
such	i
big	i
change	i
in	i
time	i
.	c

The	c
third	c
problem	c
was	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
writting	i
that	c
the	i
discounts	c
were	c
available	c
,	c
but	c
when	c
I	c
get	i
there	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
true	c
.	c

The	c
fourth	c
problem	c
was	c
that	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
be	c
open	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
but	c
once	c
again	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
lie	c
because	c
the	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
for	c
renovation	c
.	c

After	c
all	c
these	c
explanations	i
,	c
I	c
am	c
sure	c
that	c
you	c
will	c
understand	c
that	i
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
have	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
and	c
that	c
I	c
was	c
disappointed	c
last	c
night	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerly	i

For	c
example	c
,	c
a	c
car	c
,	c
which	c
is	c
used	c
from	i
everyone	c
everyday	i
,	c
changed	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
in	c
the	c
sens	i
that	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
need	c
my	c
dad	c
or	c
my	c
mum	c
to	c
go	c
to	i
ice-skating	c
or	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
work	c
.	c

This	c
a	i
big	i
walk	i
in	i
the	i
technology	c
and	c
I	c
can	c
say	c
that	c
it	c
is	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
for	c
me	c
because	c
I	c
like	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
friends	c
.	c

This	c
is	c
a	c
good	c
one	c
because	c
you	c
can	c
see	c
what	c
is	c
happening	c
around	c
you	c
and	c
everywhere	c
else	c
on	c
Earth	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
information	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
happy	c
to	c
win	c
this	c
prize	c
but	c
also	c
I	c
have	c
some	c
questions	c
about	c
this	i
Camp	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
if	c
it	c
is	c
possible	c
to	c
travel	c
to	c
this	c
Camp	i
on	i
July	c
because	c
for	c
me	c
it	c
is	c
the	c
best	c
time	c
and	c
I	c
can	i
not	i
travel	c
before	c
or	c
after	c
according	i
to	c
my	c
employer	c
.	c

From	c
the	c
activities	c
I	i
choose	c
Basketball	i
and	i
Golf	i
.	c

In	i
Basketball	i
I	i
am	i
very	i
good	i
,	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
played	c
in	c
a	c
Basketball-Team	i
for	c
ten	c
years	c
.	c

But	c
in	i
Golf	i
I	c
am	c
a	c
beginner	c
.	c

Also	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
should	c
take	c
with	c
me	c
.	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c

I	c
think	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
an	c
enjoyable	c
thing	c
because	c
there	c
are	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
things	c
which	c
are	c
not	c
good	c
.	i

For	c
example	c
:	c
you	c
need	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
money	c
each	c
month	c
for	c
shopping	c
,	c
and	c
a	c
part	c
of	c
this	c
money	c
is	c
only	c
for	c
buying	c
the	c
necessaryiest	i
things	c
like	c
bread	c
and	c
other	c
things	c
to	c
eat	c
.	c

I	c
enjoy	c
shopping	c
when	c
I	c
can	c
buy	c
some	c
clothes	c
.	c

All	c
the	c
people	c
are	c
there	c
most	i
on	c
the	c
same	c
day	c
because	c
there	c
are	c
not	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
other	c
possibilities	i
for	c
shopping	c
while	i
the	c
week	c
for	c
the	i
employees	i
.	c

2000	c

I	c
am	c
so	c
marvellous	i
about	c
winning	c
the	c
competition	c
.	c

Thirdly	c
I	c
keen	i
on	c
playing	c
tennis	c
and	c
taking	c
some	c
photography	i
.	c

In	c
spite	c
of	c
the	c
fact	c
that	c
the	c
weathe	i
is	c
bad	c
,	c
I	c
play	c
tennis	c

I	c
collect	c
strange	c
photography	i
by	c
myself	c

Title	c
:	c
Speaking	c
activity	c

During	c
that	c
time	c
I	c
can	c
talk	c
some	i
secret	c
things	i
or	i
private	i
with	c
class-mates	i
.	c

After	c
that	c
we	c
know	c
each	c
other	c
more	i
than	c
before	c
.	c

Other	i
lesson	i
,	c
the	c
teacher	c
teaches	c
lots	c
of	c
things	c
which	c
are	c
grammer	i
,	c
English	c
culture	c
...	c
etc.	c
It	c
might	c
be	c
good	c
.	c

However	c
all	i
students	i
are	c
passive	c
.	c

give	i
a	c
topic	c
and	c
then	c
discussion	i
about	i
it	c
.	c

It	i
is	i
real	i
life	i
who	i
we	i
are	i
.	c

During	c
speaking	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
lots	c
of	c
happening	i
such	c
as	c
,	c
some	c
students	c
ca	c
n't	c
understand	c
what	c
the	c
other	c
students	c
say	c
and	c
their	c
culture	c
.	c

Having	c
fun	c
and	c
knowing	i
new	c
knowledge	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
speaking	c
activity	c
should	c
be	c
filmed	c
as	c
you	c
can	c
see	c
and	c
know	c
real	i
us	c

funny	i
as	c

I	c

prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
.	i

-	c
two	c
weeks	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
in	c
the	c
U.S.A.	c
I	c
am	c
also	c
very	c
excited	c
about	c
it	c
.	c

This	c
is	c
the	c
only	c
month	c
that	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
free	c
.	c

I	c
will	c
be	c
in	c
italy	i
in	c
August	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
be	i
appreciate	c
it	c
if	c
I	c
could	c
stay	c
in	c
tents	i
at	c
Camp	i
.	c

Because	c
I	c
usually	c
go	c
on	c
camping-site	i
holiday	i
,	i
with	c
my	c
friends	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
great	c
fun	c
.	c

I	c
really	c
like	c
staying	i
in	c
tents	c
.	c

It	i
is	i
also	c
written	i
in	c
your	c
letter	c
that	c
we	c
will	c
have	c
to	i
chance	i
to	c
do	c
two	c
activities	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
really	c
good	c
at	c
playing	c
tennis	c
and	c
singing	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
been	c
playing	c
the	c
classicial	i
guitar	c
for	c
three	c
years	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
receiving	c
your	c
reply	c

Why	c
do	c
people	c
like	c
shopping	c
?	c

First	i
answer	c
is	c
that	c
they	c
need	c
shopping	i
.	c

I	c
went	c
shopping	c
last	c
week	c
with	c
my	c
friend	c
she	i
needed	c
to	c
buy	c
a	c
nightdress	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
incredibly	c
crowded	c
.	c

We	c
could	c
n't	c
even	c
move	c
and	c
the	i
most	c
people	c
were	c
just	c
looking	c
and	c
were	i
wasting	c
of	i
their	c
time	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
are	c
in	c
a	c
hurry	c
,	c
do	c
n't	c
go	c
shopping	c
!	c

I	c
can	c
tell	c
you	c
how	c
bad	c
situation	i
you	c
are	c
in	c
because	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
child	c
I	c
always	c
had	c
an	i
argument	i
with	c
my	c
mother	c
about	c
shopping	c
.	c

I	c
can	c
remember	c
how	c
upset	c
I	c
was	c
if	c
my	c
mother	c
did	c
n't	c
buy	c
what	c
I	c
wanted	c
and	c
how	c
much	c
I	c
cried	c
.	c

She	c
was	c
also	c
very	c
angry	c
.	c

Because	c
she	c
never	c
managed	c
to	c
get	c
me	c
out	c
from	i
the	c
toy	c
shop	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
wonderful	c
surprise	c
!	c

I	c
chose	c
tennis	c
and	c
golf	c
.	c

And	c
I	c
'm	c
even	c
worse	c
at	c
golf	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
've	c
never	c
been	i
playing	i
it	c
before	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
enjoy	c
discovering	i
new	i
activities	c
!	c

And	c
should	c
I	c
take	c
some	c
money	c
with	c
me	c
?	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c
.	c

"	c
Cry	c
Freedom	c
"	c
,	c
from	i
John	c
Briley	c
,	c
is	c
one	c
of	c
these	c
books	c
.	c

But	c
why	c
should	c
we	c
read	c
this	c
book	c
twice	c
?	c

And	c
by	c
understanding	c
the	c
book	c
,	c
you	c
'll	c
also	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
better	c
understand	c
what	c
happens	c
nowadays	c
in	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
countries	c
.	c

Just	c
as	i
the	c
Greeks	c
and	c
the	c
Romans	c
,	c
our	c
modern	c
society	c
has	c
mythes	i
,	c
and	c
"	c
Cry	c
Freedom	c
"	c
is	c
one	c
of	c
them	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
I	i
would	c
like	c
to	c
say	c
something	c
about	c
the	c
starring	i
:	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
because	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
see	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
but	c
once	c
there	c
I	c
found	c
an	c
actor	c
who	c
I	c
had	c
never	c
heard	c
about	i
.	c

Another	c
point	c
is	c
the	c
time	c
when	c
it	c
started	c
,	c
exactly	c
45	c
minutes	c
later	i
.	c

A	c
serious	c
theatre	c
ca	c
n't	c
miss	i
such	i
an	c
important	c
thing	c
,	c
the	c
starting-time	i
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
once	c
I	c
was	c
going	i
to	i
pay	i
for	c
the	c
tickets	c
,	c
I	c
found	c
another	c
thing	c
:	i
there	c
were	c
no	c
discounts	c
avaible	i
.	c

In	c
your	c
advertisement	c
you	c
informed	c
us	c
about	i
their	c
false	c
existence	c
.	c

Summing	c
up	c
,	c
you	c
might	c
have	c
noticed	i
that	c
that	c
was	c
n't	c
"	c
my	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
"	c
wich	i
you	c
promised	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
you	c
to	c
give	c
me	c
the	c
money	c
I	c
paid	c
for	c
the	c
ticket	c
back	c
.	c

They	c
were	c
in	c
the	c
shopping	c
centre	c
,	c
and	c
the	c
problem	c
was	c
that	c
Nick	c
was	c
n't	c
alone	c
,	c
he	c
was	c
with	c
a	c
very	c
beautiful	c
girl	c
.	c

That	c
morning	c
Marie	c
had	c
told	c
her	c
that	c
Nick	c
could	c
n't	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
cinema	c
with	c
her	c
because	c
he	c
had	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
work	c
to	c
do	c
in	c
the	c
afternoon	c
so.	c
.	c

what	c
was	c
he	c
doing	c
there	c
with	c
that	c
girl	c
?	c

In	c
the	c
end	c
Pat	c
phoned	c
Marie	c
and	c
told	c
her	c
:	c
she	c
was	c
a	c
very	c
good	c
friend	c
.	c

Marie	c
was	c
so	c
shocked	c
that	c
,	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
Pat	c
had	c
stopped	c
speaking	c
,	c
she	c
phoned	c
Nick	c
and	c
,	c
without	c
letting	c
him	c
say	c
anything	c
,	c
she	c
broke	c
up	c
their	c
relation	i
.	c

But..what	c
about	c
the	c
girl	c
?	c

She	c
works	c
as	c
a	c
model	c
,	c
and	c
she	c
was	c
advicing	i
him	c
about	c
which	i
clothes	c
,	c
etc	c
,	c
...	c
buy	i
for	c
her	c
.	c

Pat	c
could	c
n't	c
keep	c
that	c
secret	c
,	c
and	c
in	c
spite	c
of	c
helping	c
Marie	c
,	c
she	c
made	c
a	c
couple	c
disappear	i
.	c

London	c
,	c
1st	c
of	c
June	c
2000	c

My	c
opinion	c
?	c

I	c
had	c
a	c
very	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
.	c

First	c
,	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
does	i
n't	i
play	i
"	i
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
"	c
his	i
paper	i
was	c
played	c
by	c
Danny	c
De	c
Vito	c
.	c

I	c
can	c
understand	c
that	c
a	c
play	c
can	c
start	c
fifteen	c
minutes	c
late	c
,	c
but	c
not	c
fourty	i
five	i
.	c

Second	c
,	c
my	c
wife	c
and	c
me	i
payed	i
£	c
20	c
for	c
the	c
tickets	c
and	c
we	c
asked	c
for	c
discounts	c
.	c

The	c
receptionist	c
who	c
gave	c
me	c
the	c
tickets	c
told	c
me	c
that	c
no	c
discounts	c
were	c
able	i
that	c
night	c
.	c

I	c
decided	c
to	c
go	c
home	c
and	c
prepare	i
some	c
sandwiches	c
.	c

The	c
principal	c
reason	c
for	i
I	c
'm	c
writting	i
you	i
at	c
the	c
moment	c
is	c
that	c
I	c
want	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
felt	c
so	c
disappointing	i
with	c
the	c
theatre	c
and	c
also	c
with	c
the	c

Before	c
modern	c
technologies	c
arrived	c
,	c
you	c
ca	i
n't	i
comunicate	i
as	c
easy	i
as	c
today	i
we	i
can	i
do	i
.	c

It	c
changed	c
my	c
life	c
,	c
because	c
with	c
it	c
I	c
can	c
discover	i
more	c
information	c
than	c
a	i
newspaper	c
,	c
and	c
also	c
information	c
of	i
all	c
around	c
the	c
world	c
,	c
that	i
possibly	i
never	i
I	i
can	i
access	c
without	c
Internet	i
.	c

But	c
,	c
is	i
not	c
only	c
news	c
or	c
information	c
.	c

No	c
electricity	c
,	c
no	c
canalized	c
water	c

no	c
healthy	c
water	c

I	c
'm	c
afraid	c
that	c
the	c
people	c
on	i
the	i
ancient	c
times	c
lived	c
although	c
they	c
do	i
n't	i
have	c
anything	i
of	c
these	c
things	c
,	c
but	c
me	c
and	c
everyone	c
of	i
this	i
times	c
,	c
I	c
'm	c
afraid	c
that	c
we	c
would	c
n't	c
like	c
return	i
to	c
this	c
life	c
.	c

As	i
well	i
,	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
modern	c
technologies	c
are	c
necessary	c
,	c
but	c
also	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
are	i
so	i
expensive	c
,	c
but	c
with	c
time	c
,	c
the	c
price	c
goes	c
down	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
if	c
the	c
price	c
goes	c
down	c
is	i
because	c
anything	i
new	c
is	c
at	c
the	i
moment	i
for	i
sell	i
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
'm	c
available	c
for	i
travel	i
only	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
in	c
August	c
I	c
'm	c
going	c
to	c
attend	c
a	c
language	c
course	c
in	c
France	c
.	c

As	c
far	c
as	c
accomodation	i
is	c
concerned	c
I	i
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
because	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
more	c
comfortable	c
,	c
and	c
,	c
therefore	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
stayed	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c

This	c
report	c
shows	c
which	c
lessons	c
and	c
activities	c
are	c
better	i
to	c
be	i
filmed	i
in	c
order	c
to	c
make	c
a	c
short	c
video	c
about	c
daily	c
life	c
at	c
our	c
school	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
according	c
to	c
the	c
majority	c
of	c
them	c
,	c
latin	i
and	i
greek	i
lessons	c
should	c
be	c
filmed	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
some	c
students	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
film	c
the	c
football	i
school	i
team	i
,	c
because	c
football	c
is	c
the	c
most	c
practised	i
activity	c
by	i
the	c
students	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
,	c
which	c
I	c
have	c
seen	c
in	c
The	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
on	c
6th	c
June	c
.	c

On	c
that	c
date	c
,	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
spend	c
one	c
evening	c
seeing	c
a	c
musical	c
show	c
as	c
I	c
was	c
on	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
and	c
was	c
interested	c
in	c
musial	i
show	c
.	c

But	c
things	c
started	c
to	c
go	c
wrong	c
from	c
the	c
beginning	c
.	c

The	c
first	c
problem	c
was	c
the	c
price	c
of	c
tickets	c
.	c

I	c
expected	c
to	c
buy	c
ticket	i
cheaply	c
but	c
no	c
discounts	c
were	c
available	c
.	c

Although	c
I	c
got	c
a	c
bit	c
annoyed	c
,	c
I	c
tried	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
good	c
time	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
something	c
wrong	c
came	i
up	i
again	c
.	c

The	c
actor	c
'	c
Danny	c
brook	c
'	c
,	c
whom	c
you	c
advertised	c
in	c
the	c
brocher	i
,	c
did	c
not	c
play	c
a	c
part	c
in	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

He	c
kept	c
forgetting	c
his	c
lines	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
therefore	c
writing	c
to	c
ask	c
for	c
a	c
full	c
refund	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
comletely	i
different	c
!	c

'	c
It	c
's	c
completely	c
different	c
!	c

This	c
is	c
what	c
my	c
friend	c
said	c
the	c
other	c
day	c
when	c
she	c
went	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
show	c
with	c
me	c
.	c

In	i
my	i
opinion	i
,	i
I	c
believe	c
that	c
clothes	c
indicate	c
individual	i
's	c
creativity	c
as	c
well	c
as	c
social	c
situation	c
.	c

Let	c
's	c
face	c
it	c
.	c

Clothes	c
are	c
always	c
changing	c
.	c

Sir	c
,	c

In	c
fact	c
,	c
unlike	c
the	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
that	c
you	c
promised	c
on	i
your	c
advertisement	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
very	c
disapointing	i
evening	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
expected	c
to	c
see	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
in	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
but	c
he	c
was	c
replaced	c
by	c
another	c
actor	c
.	c

And	c
to	c
finish	c
,	c
the	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
,	c
for	c
any	i
reasons	c
you	c
did	c
n't	c
take	i
to	i
us	c
.	c

So	c
the	c
surprise	c
we	c
prepared	c
for	c
the	i
Leon	c
's	c
birthday	c
had	c
failed	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
we	i
've	i
started	c
to	c
search	i
an	i
idea	i
for	c
it	c
for	i
one	c
months	i
.	i

But	c
he	c
wanted	c
to	c
stay	c
at	c
his	i
home	c
.	c

So	c
Sigone	c
found	i
the	c
greatest	c
idea	c
.	c

We	c
would	c
pretend	c
to	c
have	c
bought	c
for	i
him	i
a	i
dog	i
.	c

So	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
find	c
a	c
dog	c
that	c
Leon	c
would	c
n't	c
recognized	i
.	c

I	c
had	c
a	c
friend	c
who	c
had	c
just	c
received	i
a	c
little	c
dog	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
very	c
good	c
due	i
.	c

According	i
to	i
Camp	c
California	c
in	c
the	c
U.S.A.	c
I	i
expect	c
to	c
traveling	i
on	i
July	c
because	c
I	c
will	c
have	c
a	c
long	c
holiday	i
break	i
on	i
that	c
time	c
and	c
my	c
children	c
have	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
France	c
with	c
student	i
's	i
school	c
on	i
July	c
as	c
well	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
,	i
it	c
will	c
be	c
very	i
good	c
time	c
to	c
traveling	i
by	i
without	c
worries	c
.	c

How	i
is	i
about	c
an	i
accommodation	c
.	i

I	c
prefer	c
to	c
live	i
in	c
tents	c
because	c
I	c
feel	c
very	c
natural	c
.	c

Can	c
you	c
imagine	c
how	c
exsiting	i
when	i
we	c
stay	i
in	c
the	c
dark	c
and	c
very	c
quite	i
and	c
we	c
can	c
hear	c
a	i
sound	c
of	c
animal	i

That	c
is	c
what	c
most	c
of	i
the	i
women	c

They	c
love	c
going	c
to	c
a	c
shopping	c
centre	c
and	c
put	i
lots	c
of	c
clothes	c
on	c
.	c

That	c
's	c
so	c
good	c
when	c
you	c
have	c
money	i
for	i
joy	i
it	c
but	c
,	c
appart	i
from	c
that	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
many	c
problems	c
.	c

On	i
the	i
one	i
hand	i
,	c
a	c
big	c
problem	c
are	i
the	c
children	c
.	c

People	c
buy	c
and	c
buy	c
unnecessary	c
things	c
but	c
,	c
when	c
they	c
arrives	i
in	i
their	i
houses	i
,	c
they	c
can	c
see	c
an	c
empty	c
wallet	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
the	c
letter	c
I	c
have	c
just	c
received	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
assure	c
you	c
that	c
I	c
would	i
do	c
my	c
best	c
to	c
be	c
the	i
one	c
of	c
the	c
winners	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
.	c

Now	c
,	c
If	i
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
state	i
some	c
of	c
the	c
information	c
that	c
you	c
may	c
need	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
I	c
can	c
travel	i
only	i
in	c
July	c
this	c
year	c
.	c

From	c
the	c
list	c
of	c
activities	c
in	c
which	c
I	c
will	c
have	c
a	c
chance	c
to	c
compete	c
I	c
have	c
choosen	i
:	i
basketball	c
and	c
swimming	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
how	c
many	c
clothes	c
and	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
should	i
I	i
take	c
with	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
will	c
wait	c
to	c
hearing	i
from	c
you	c
,	c
soon	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

I	c
do	c
agree	c
with	c
the	c
opinion	c
that	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

Nowadays	c
many	c
young	c
people	c
like	c
to	c
do	c
their	c
shopping	c
.	c

But	c
,	c
is	c
n't	c
it	c
a	c
kind	c
of	c
entertaintment	i
?	c

In	c
the	c
first	c
place	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
point	c
out	c
that	c
to	c
go	c
shopping	c
does	c
not	c
always	c
mean	c
to	c
buy	c
something	c
.	c

But	c
,	c
what	c
about	c
real	c
shopping	c
.	i

I	c
mean	c
shopping	c
with	c
a	c
real	c
purpose	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
achievement	c
for	c
you	c
when	c
you	c
buy	c
the	c
suit	c
that	c
is	c
perfect	c
for	c
everyone	c
.	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
shopping	c
is	c
enjoyable	c
when	c
you	c
are	c
going	c
only	c
for	c
fan	i
.	c

But	c
,	c
when	c
you	c
want	c
to	c
buy	c
something	c
special	c
it	c
's	c
a	c
real	c
nightmare	c

Dear	c
Sir/madam	c

really	c
wonderful	c

I	c

I	c
prefer	i
live	i
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
,	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
more	c
comfortable	c
.	c

I	c
like	i
to	c
relax	c
there	c
and	c
enjoy	c
the	c
atmosphere	c
when	i
I	c
live	i
in	i
.	c

I	c
like	c
to	c
do	c
some	c
activities	c
in	c
water	c
and	c
my	c
favourite	c
activity	c
is	c
swimming	c

I	c
want	c

By	c
the	c

to	c

shopping	c
especially	i
for	c

,	i
I	c
want	c
to	c

some	c
for	c

And	c

This	i

about	i
their	i

and	i
give	i
some	i

about	i
it	i

What	c
do	c
students	c
do	c
now	c
?	c

And	c
sometimes	c
they	c
do	c
something	c
in	c
the	c
library	c
by	c
themselves	c
in	c
the	c
afteroon	i

Moreover	c

Open	i

I	c

to	c

about	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
did	c
not	c
act	i
as	c
you	c
had	c
said	i
.	c

A	c
different	c
actor	c
acted	i
in	i
stead	i
of	c
him	c
.	c

it	i
was	c
disappointing	c
.	c

Even	c
though	c
I	c
brought	c
discount	i
taken	i
which	c
I	c
was	c
given	c
by	c
travel	i
agency	c
.	c

What	c
's	c
more	c
,	c
the	c
theatre	c
reastaurant	i
had	i
been	i
closed	c
,	i
when	c
the	c
show	c
finished	c
.	c

It	c
should	c
have	c
started	c
at	c
19:30	c
as	c
you	c
said	c
at	i
advertisement	i
,	c
or	i
you	c
should	c
not	c
have	c
closed	c
before	i
the	c
show	c
finished	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
not	c

Dear	c
Mrs.	c
Ryan	c

I	c
'm	c
very	i
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
it	c
as	c
I	c
've	c
never	c
been	c
in	i
the	c
U.S.A.	c
before	c
.	c

As	c
for	c
accommodation	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
,	c
I	c
prefer	c
tent	i
.	c

I	c
'm	c
used	c
to	c
sleep	i
in	c
tent	i
from	c
my	c
previous	c
holidays	c
and	c
I	c
always	c
injoyed	i
it	c
.	c

I	c
'd	c
just	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
if	c
the	c
tents	c
at	c
the	c
camp	c
are	c
based	i
on	i
sharing	i
and	c
how	c
many	c
people	c
is	i
there	c
in	c
one	c
tent	c
.	c

I	c
've	c
chosen	c
tennis	c
and	c
sailing	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
also	c
good	c
at	c
swimming	c
and	c
surfing	c
but	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
try	c
sailing	c
.	c

Do	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
bring	c
with	c
me	c
some	c
special	c
gear	c
or	c
equipment	c
?	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Dear	c
Kim	c

In	c
my	c
last	c
letter	c
I	c
promised	c
to	c
write	c
you	i
about	c
my	c
experience	c
working	c
at	c
pop-concert	i
.	c

It	c
was	c
very	c
hectic	c
there	c
as	c
everyone	c
was	c
a	c
bit	c
nervous	c
but	c
I	c
saw	c
the	c
main	c
stars	c
and	c
even	c
managed	c
to	c
talk	c
to	c
them	c
.	c

First	c
,	c
it	c
seemed	c
to	c
me	c
odd	c
because	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
understand	c
why	c
they	c
faint	i
,	c
but	c
as	c
the	c
concert	c
went	c
on	c
,	c
the	c
heat	c
in	c
the	c
air	c
was	c
increasing	c
and	c
so	c
was	c
the	c
number	c
of	c
the	c
fainted	i
.	c

It	c
was	c
n't	c
funny	c
anymore	c
and	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
know	c
what	c
to	c
do	c
first	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
really	c
shocked	c
by	c
the	c
view	i
of	c
crying	c
and	c
shaking	c
but	c
absolutely	i
happy	c
girls	c
sitting	c
or	c
lying	c
on	c
the	c
floor	c

Two	c

at	c

I	c
stayed	c
that	i
happy	c
during	c
the	c
travel	i
,	c
thinking	c
of	c
how	c

I	c
would	c
look	c
on	i
the	c
playground	c
with	c
my	c
brand	i
new	i

on	c

There	c
was	c

do	c
the	c

when	c

The	c
most	c

thing	i

to	c

able	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c

I	c
received	c
your	c
letter	c
last	c
week	c
and	c
was	c
surprised	c
to	c
see	c
that	c
I	c
won	i
a	c
competition	c
.	c

You	c
asked	c
me	c
which	c
accomodation	i
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
.	c

It	c
will	c
remind	c
me	c
some	i
wonderful	c
experiences	c
.	c

According	i
to	i
the	c
activities	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
do	c
some	c
painting	c
,	c
which	c
I	c
am	c
quite	c
good	c
at	c
.	c

The	c
second	c
activity	c
I	c
chose	c
is	c
sailing	c
.	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
your	c
last	c
letter	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
you	i
have	c
to	c
know	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
a	i
common	i
pop	c
concert	c
,	c
but	c
a	c
real	c
open	i
air	i
festival	c
.	c

It	i
is	c
n't	c
the	c
first	c
year	c
that	c
I	c
work	i
there	c
.	c

Everybody	c
was	c
so	c
relaxed	c
;	c
we	c
were	c
singing	c
and	c
dancing	c
while	c
selling	c
ice-creams	c
in	c
our	c
little	c
van	c
.	c

Byran	c
Adams	c
himself	c
bought	c
me	c
an	c
ice-cream	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
amazing	i
experience	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
really	c
impressed	c
by	c
this	c
solidarity	c
and	c
friendship	c
which	c
is	c
quite	c
rare	c
in	c
Switzerland	c
.	c

We	c
have	c
just	c
sen	i
the	c
advertisement	c
for	c
'	c
The	c
London	c
fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
'	c
.	c

We	c
are	c
very	c
keen	c
on	c
the	i
fashions	c
and	c
make	i
up	i
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
the	c
admittion	i
fee	c
is	c
free	c
for	c
students	c
.	c

If	c
some	c
students	c
want	c
a	i
shopping	i
,	c
they	c
could	c
go	c
on	c
15	c
March	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
will	c
consider	c
my	c
suggestion	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c

Yours	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
provide	c
you	c
with	c
the	c
information	c
that	c
you	c
require	c
to	c
arrange	c
my	c
two	i
week	i
holidays	i
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
in	c
the	c
U.S.A	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
,	c
as	c
I	c
am	c
working	c
,	c
this	c
is	c
the	c
only	c
time	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
go	c
on	c
holidays	i
.	c

You	c
also	c
told	c
me	c
that	c
I	c
would	c
have	c
the	c
chance	c
of	c
doing	c
two	c
activities	c
.	c

And	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
try	c
golf	c
because	c
this	c
is	c
a	c
sport	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
practised	i
but	c
I	c
have	c
always	c
wanted	c
to	c
try	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
this	c
apparently	c
quite	i
and	c
relaxed	c
activitie	i
can	c
sometimes	c
turn	c
into	c
a	c
living	c
hell	c
;	c
you	c
may	c
only	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
go	c
shopping	c
at	c
the	c
weekend	c
and	c
then	c
,	c
if	c
you	c
do	c
go	c
,	c
you	c
will	c
find	c
yourself	c
in	c
the	c
middle	c
of	c
a	c
huge	c
crowd	c
of	c
people	c
,	c
unable	c
to	c
get	c
to	c
any	c
product	c
or	c
even	c
shop	c
and	c
feeling	c
dizzy	c
by	i
the	c
mixture	c
of	c
smells	c
that	c
come	c
from	c
the	c
people	c
.	c

Nevertheless	c
the	c
worst	c
will	c
come	c
when	c
you	c
lose	c
the	c
youngest	c
member	c
of	c
your	c
family	c
and	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
spend	c
the	c
whole	c
day	c
looking	c
for	c
him/her	c
.	c

I	c
received	c
your	c
letter	c
this	c
morning	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
suprised	i
it	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
writting	i
you	i
about	c
your	c
questions	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
stay	c
at	i
long	i
cabins	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
stayed	c
at	i
tents	c
many	c
times	c
in	c
my	c
childhood	c
.	c

The	c
most	c
exciting	c
offer	c
is	c
your	c
activities	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
been	c
interested	c
in	c
Painting	c
but	c
I	c
have	c
not	c
had	c
a	c
chance	c
so	i
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
do	c
climbing	c
.	c

My	c
grand	i
father	i
used	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
when	c
he	c
was	c
a	c
student	c
.	c

After	c
he	c
has	i
got	i
a	c
job	c
,	c
he	c
became	c
busy	c
.	c

If	c
I	c
know	c
how	c
to	c
climb	c
,	c
I	c
will	c
enjoy	c
it	c
with	c
my	c
grand	i
father	i
.	c

Your	i
faithfully	c
,	c

It	c
was	c
so	c
exciting	c
!	c

My	c
main	c
working	i
was	c
take	i
people	c
to	c
their	c
seat	i
because	c
of	c
a	c
concert	c
hall	c
,	c
which	c
was	c
the	c
millenium	i

It	c
's	c
the	c
hottest	c
place	c
in	c
England	c

I	c
also	c
sold	c
a	c
panfulet	i
of	c
that	c
concert	c
,	c
CD	c
and	c
T-shirts	c

When	c
I	c
saw	c
Jullia	c

I	c
was	c
socked	i

I	c
have	c
never	c
seen	c
that	c
kind	c
of	c
long	c
legs	c
in	c
my	c
life	c

Did	c
you	c
enjoy	c
my	c
letter	c
?	c

I	c
ca	c
n't	c
explain	c

The	c

part	c
was	c
when	c

arrived	c

I	c
took	c
lots	c
of	c
pictures	c

asked	c

I	c
even	c
gave	c

Some	i

Dear	c
Manager	c
:	c
I	c
am	c
Angela	c
Ounis	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
writting	i
to	c
you	c
because	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
see	c
'	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
'	c
,	c
London	c
's	c
newest	c
and	c
best	c
musical	c
show	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
disappointing	i
at	i
this	c
evening	c
's	c
show	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
the	i
starring	i
that	c
was	i
supposed	c
to	c
be	c
(	i
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
)	c
were	c
n't	c
there	c
,	i
I	c
was	c
so	c
enthusiastic	c
about	c
your	c
starring	i
,	c
when	c
I	c
realized	c
was	i
a	i
failure	i
,	c
even	c
though	c
they	i
do	i
good	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
the	c
same	c
.	c

You	c
go	c
there	c
to	c
see	c
a	c
show	c
and	c
have	c
a	c
good	c
time	c
,	c
not	c
to	c
wait	c
forever	i
until	i
you	i
want	c
.	c

Also	c
was	i
said	c
that	c
Discounts	c
will	i
be	c
available	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
received	i
any	c
discount	c
as	c
you	c
were	c
cheating	c
us	c
.	c

On	i
the	i
other	i
hand	i
,	c
the	c
theatre	c
Restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
they	c
've	c
got	c
a	c
problem	c
with	c
the	c
schedule	i
's	i
organization	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
so	c
disappointed	c
with	c
this	c
,	i
that	c
I	c
am	c
in	i
all	i
my	i
right	i
to	c
ask	c
for	c
some	c
money	c
back	c
,	c
your	c
theatre	c
show	c
was	c
n't	c
expected	i
.	c

How	c
has	c
modern	c
technology	c
changed	c
your	c
daily	c
life	c
?	c

I	c
am	c
17	c
years	c
old	c
,	c
and	c
my	c
life	c
has	c
been	c
very	c
normal	c
.	c

Now	c
I	c
have	c
more	c
friends	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
more	c
fun	c
.	c

This	c
has	c
helped	c
me	c
a	c
lot	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
can	c
talk	c
with	c
my	c
friends	c
that	i
are	i
living	i
in	c
other	c
countries	c
.	c

Technology	i
has	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
programs	c
that	c
lead	i
you	c
communicate	c
with	c
others	c
in	c
a	i
more	i
easy	i
way	c
.	c

This	c
has	c
opened	c
another	c
world	c
to	c
me	c
,	c
distances	c
are	c
n't	c
so	c
sad	c
,	c
they	c
are	c
more	i
close	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
interesting	i
in	c
reading	c
articles	c
and	c
developing	c
myself	c
.	c

Technology	c
had	i
gave	i
me	c
another	c
life	c
,	c
has	i
helped	c
me	c
.	c

My	c
knowledge	c
has	c
been	c
developed	c
and	c
also	c
my	c
life	i
style	i
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
my	i
cousin	c
,	c
who	c
lives	c
there	c
,	c
had	c
had	c
many	c
problems	c
with	c
the	c
tickets	c
.	c

The	c
starring	i
changed	i
and	c
this	i
was	c
the	c
worst	c
surprise	c
I	c
could	c
have	c
.	i

But	c
instead	c
of	c
him	c
there	c
was	c
a	i
unknown	c
young	c
actor	c
.	c

What	c
an	c
absurd	c
thing	c
,	c
do	c
n't	c
you	c
think	c
so	c
?	c

I	c
had	c
n't	c
tought	i
for	i
a	c
restaurant	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
because	c
if	c
the	c
advertisement	c
had	c
been	c
right	c
,	c
there	c
should	c
had	i
to	i
be	i
a	c
luxury	c
restaurant	c
where	c
I	c
could	c
eat	c
.	c

Because	c
of	c
the	c
quality	c
of	c
the	c
evening	c
I	c
spent	i
,	c
the	c
only	c
thing	c
you	c
can	c
do	c
is	c
giving	i
me	c
back	c
at	c
least	c
the	c
half	c
of	c
the	c
cost	c
of	c
ticket	i
.	c

Your	i
Sinceraly	i

We	c
are	c
in	c
the	c
ages	i
of	c
the	i
technologic	i
development	c
it	i
's	i
out	i
of	i
doubt	i
.	c

What	c
could	i
be	i
out	i
of	i
control	i
of	i
technology	i
?	c

Nowadays	c
especially	i
in	c
the	c
west	i
area	c
of	c
the	c
world	c
science	i
and	c
technology	c
have	c
done	i
great	c
,	c
enormous	c
steps	c
in	c
directions	i
of	i
the	i
progress	c
.	c

I	c
can	c
buy	c
,	c
today	c
,	c
a	c
book	c
being	i
comfortable	c
at	c
home	c
,	c
can	c
communicate	c
with	c
other	c
friends	c
faster	c
than	c
before	c
.	c

I	c
can	i
have	i
my	i
homeworks	i
done	i
by	i
a	i
calculator	i
etc.	c
In	c
future	i
I	c
wish	i
I	c
could	c
fly	c
on	c
my	c
own	c
!	c

I	c
think	c
I	c
should	i
become	i
crazy	c
without	c
them	c
,	c
not	c
only	c
me	c
but	c
the	c
majority	c
of	c
us	c
.	c

But	c
sometimes	c
I	c
'd	c
rather	c
to	i
switch	i
them	c
off	c
and	c
think	c
of	c
what	c
I	c
could	i
waste	i
,	c
like	c
love	c
and	c
friendship	c
.	c

I	c
wish	c
all	c
the	c
world	c
would	c
do	c
the	c
same	c
.	c

Vico	c
says	c
that	c
progress	c
gives	i
up	i
when	c
Man	c
have	i
noticed	c
that	c
he	c
have	i
been	c
wasting	c
those	c
values	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
we	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
say	c
you	i
thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
organised	i
our	c
tour	c
around	c
London	c
and	c
our	c
programme	c
wich	i
is	c
considered	c
for	i
us	i
especially	i
good	i
for	i
the	c
places	c
we	c
will	c
visit	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
we	c
saw	c
last	c
Saturday	c
in	c
the	c
Oxfor	c
News	c
one	i
advertisement	c
about	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
and	c
we	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
if	c
could	i
be	c
posible	i
to	c
inclued	i
this	c
show	c
in	c
our	c
tour	c
.	c

The	c
show	c
is	c
going	c
to	c
take	c
place	c
in	c
the	c
Gernal	i
Exhibition	c
Hall	c
in	c
London	c
,	c
the	i
thurday	i
14	c
of	c
March	c
,	c
so	c
could	i
be	c
a	c
good	c
idea	c
to	c
see	c
this	c
show	c
intead	i
of	c
go	i
to	c
Science	i
Museum	c
.	c

We	c
think	c
that	c
it	c
could	c
be	c
great	i
opportunity	c
because	c
in	c
one	c
day	c
we	c
can	c
see	c
every	i
thing	i
about	i
fashion	i
clothes	c
,	c
new	c
makes	i
up	i
and	c
hayrstyles	i
.	c

Furthermore	c
is	i
student	i
free	i

I	i
you	c
would	c
like	c
more	c
information	c
do	c
not	c
hesitate	c
to	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
for	i
you	i

Dear	c
Ms	i
,	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
take	c
my	c
holiday	c
only	c
the	i
two	i
first	i
week	i
of	c
july	i
because	c
of	c
my	c
work	c
.	c

The	c
activities	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
chosen	c
are	c
sailing	c
and	c
climbing	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
never	c
sailed	c
but	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
well	i
swimmer	c
.	c

Last	c
summer	c
I	c
took	c
a	c
course	i
of	i
one	i
week	i
in	i
Switzerland	i
of	i
climbing	i
so	c
I	c
have	i
good	i
knowledge	i
of	i
this	c
sport	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
earing	i
from	c
you	c
soon	c
and	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
send	c
me	c
a	c
brochure	c
of	c
this	c
holiday	c
I	c
would	c
be	c
grateful	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c

A	c
lot	c
of	c
people	c
like	c
shopping	c
and	c
everybody	c
goes	c
on	c
saturday	i
because	c
for	i
lots	c
of	c
people	c
they	i
do	c
n't	c
go	c
to	c
work	c
and	i
is	i
the	c
only	c
day	c
off	c
of	i
the	c
majority	c
of	c
people	c
.	c

In	i
the	i
street	c
is	c
so	c
crowded	c
that	c
you	c
ca	c
n't	c
walk	c
like	c
usually	i
and	c
if	c
you	c
go	c
with	c
some	c
friends	c
you	c
can	c
be	c
sure	c
that	c
you	c
will	c
lost	i
them	c
.	c

at	c
the	c
fitting	c
room	c
and	c
after	c
that	c
20	c
min	i
more	c
at	c
the	c
cash	c
desk	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
supermarket	c
is	i
the	c
same	c
.	c

When	c
you	c
buy	c
food	c
or	c
drink	c
they	c
give	c
you	c
plastic	i
bag	c
for	i
carry	i
it	c
and	i
this	i
bags	c
broke	i
every	c
time	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
,	c

The	c
reason	c
of	i
my	c
letter	c
,	i
is	c
that	c
our	c
class	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
suggest	c
a	c
few	c
changes	c
on	i
our	c
programme	c
of	i
London	c
,	c
because	c
we	c
have	c
seen	c
an	c
advertisement	c
about	c
an	c
interesting	c
activity	c
that	c
we	c
could	c
include	c
in	c
our	c
programme	c
.	c

We	c
think	c
that	c
perhaps	c
in	i
Tuesday	c
March	c
14	c
,	i
we	c
could	c
change	c
the	c
time	c
of	i
going	i
to	c
Science	i
Museum	c
,	c
and	c
(	i
we	i
)	i
go	c
earlier	i
to	i
the	i
Museum	i
,	c
such	i
as	i
half	c
past	c
eight	c
on	i
the	c
morning	c
,	c
so	c
we	c
could	c
go	c
after	i
,	c
at	c
ten	c
o'clock	c
to	i
the	c
show	c
,	c
and	c
we	c
could	c
also	c
delay	c
going	c
shopping	c
on	c
that	c
afternoon	c
,	c
because	c
the	c
show	c
lasts	c
til	i
seven	c
o'clock	c
on	i
the	c
evening	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
the	c
home	c
of	c
the	c
Future	c
would	c
probably	c
be	c
better	c
than	c
it	i
is	c
now	c
.	c

Computer	i
will	c
take	i
a	i
important	c
part	c
in	c
our	c
daily	c
life	c
,	c
so	c
that	c
we	c
wo	c
n't	c
go	c
shopping	c
,	c
because	c
in	i
the	c
computer	c
we	c
would	i
buy	i
whatever	c
we	c
want	c
.	c

Books	c
will	c
gradually	c
disappear	c
,	c
and	c
instead	c
we	c
will	c
read	c
all	c
the	c
things	c
we	c
want	c
in	i
our	c
computer	c
.	c

Although	c
computers	c
will	c
give	c
us	c
all	c
the	c
material	c
things	c
,	c
it	i
could	i
not	c
give	c
us	c
things	c
like	c
the	c
feeling	c
of	c
being	c
in	c
your	c
home	c
,	c
have	i
,	c
etc.	c
That	i
things	c
wo	c
n't	c
change	c
in	c
our	c
home	c
.	c

We	c
will	c
live	c
in	c
our	c
homes	c
with	c
our	c
family	c
,	c
who	c
will	c
give	c
us	c
love	c
.	c

.	c
.	c
,	i
that	c
kind	c
of	c
things	i
will	c
never	c
change	c
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
home	c
our	c
conditions	i
of	i
life	i
will	c
approve	i
,	c
and	c
computer	i
will	c
be	c
very	c
important	c
for	c
us	c
,	c
but	c
is	i
wo	c
n't	c
control	c
us	c
,	c
because	c
we	c
still	c
have	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
thing	c
of	i
a	c
home	c
=	i
have	i
,	i
that	i
will	c
be	c
the	c
same	c
as	c
now	c
.	c

I	c
received	c
your	c
letter	c
which	i
says	c
I	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
-	c
two	c
weeks	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
in	c
the	c
U.S.A.	c
I	c
apreicate	i
it	i
and	c
I	c
thank	c
you	c

chosen	c
me	c
as	c

I	c
acxepted	i
it	i

I	c
want	c
to	c
inform	c
you	c
that	c
I	c

only	c
on	i
July	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
booked	c
my	c
anual	i
leave	c
that	i
period	c
.	c

Every	c
years	i
my	c
parents	c
used	c
to	c
sent	i
me	c
for	i
holidays	i
at	i
Camps	c
on	i
the	c
mountains	c
so	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
stay	c
for	c
a	c
while	c
in	c
the	c
same	c
accommodation	i
,	i
and	c
environment	c
.	c

My	c
parents	c
brought	i
me	c
to	c
the	c
sea	i
side	i
every	c
weekend	c
so	c
I	c
was	i
used	c
to	c
be	i
inside	i
the	c
water	c
all	c
the	i
seasons	c
.	c

Do	c
I	c
need	c
something	c
special	c
or	c
ordinary	i
clothes	c
?	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

It	c
took	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
to	c
testifite	i
the	c
speakers	c
and	c
the	c
microphones	c
.	c

I	c
helped	c
them	c
to	c
the	i
music	c
and	c
to	i
the	c
songs	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
a	i
quite	i
difficult	c
assiment	i
but	c
I	c
got	c
very	i
good	c
experience	c
.	c

I	c
understood	i
it	c
when	c
the	c
concert	c
had	c
finished	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
some	i
thing	i
that	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
expect	c
.	c

I	c
still	c
have	c
the	c
sound	c
of	c
the	c
music	c
in	c
my	c
ears	c
and	c
the	c
voices	c
of	c
the	c
young	c
people	c
who	c
were	c
accompaning	i
our	c
songs	c
.	c

I	c
enjoyed	c
very	i
much	c
and	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
tranfere	i
my	c
enjoyment	i
to	c
you	c
though	i
this	c
letter	c

sincerely	c

I	c
am	c
happy	c
to	c
visit	c
the	c
United	c
States	c
under	i
your	c
organisation	c

Actually	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
Camp	c
California	c
next	c
July	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
got	c
two	c
weeks	i

then	c
.	c

I	c
also	c
will	c
be	c
pleased	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
log	i

Surfing	c
is	c
something	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
ever	i
wanted	c
to	c
try	c

As	i
you	i
can	i
see	i

I	c
have	c
abosolutly	i
no	c
experience	c
in	c
it	c
.	c

Will	c
it	c
be	c
possible	c
to	c
join	c
a	c
surf	i
school	c
?	c

For	c
the	c
second	c
activity	c
I	c
have	c
chosen	c
photography	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

Mr	c
Oliver	c
Herre	c

So	c
many	c
happy	c
people	c
in	c
the	c
crowds	c
,	c
that	c
the	c
atmosphere	c
was	c
infectious	c
.	c

Anyway	c
,	c
what	c
you	c
wanted	c
to	c
know	c
was	c
what	c
has	i
been	i
my	i
job	i
.	c

Actually	c
my	c
job	c
was	c
not	c
really	c
stressful	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
had	c
contact	c
and	i
access	c
to	c
all	c
the	c
famous	c
Pop	i
Stars	i
.	c

I	c
had	c
to	c
bring	c
them	c
refreshments	c
.	c

They	c
did	c
n't	c
really	c
appreciate	c
my	i
service	c
.	c

Apart	c
from	c
that	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
an	c
amazing	c
experience	c
.	c

I	c
liked	c
to	i
see	i
their	c
way	c
of	c
life	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
will	c
write	c
me	i
very	c
soon	c
and	c
I	c
hope	c
you	i
know	i
more	c
about	c
my	c
concert	c
experience	c
in	c
the	c
backstage	c
area	c

Mr	c

Mrs	c
Manager	c

Circle	c
Theatre	c

Hi	c
.	c

I	c
recently	c
had	c
a	c
week	c
's	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

The	c
advertisement	c
that	c
you	c
distributed	c
through	c
all	c
the	c
magazines	c
wee	i
totally	c
untrue	c
.	c

Which	i
so	i
called	i
"	i
Rip	i
off	i
"	i
.	i

Secondly	c
about	i
the	c
time	c
.	c

How	i
ever	i
the	i
point	c
that	c
it	i
am	c
trying	c
to	c
say	i
is	c
you	i
just	c
ruined	c
my	c
hoilday	i
.	c

Let	c
me	c
make	c
it	c
clear	c
,	c
you	c
blew	i
my	c
time	c
and	c
money	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
thing	i
your	c
play	c
worth	c
£	c
20.00	c
.	c

Your	c
advertisment	i
was	c
un	i
fair	i
.	c

As	c
you	c
are	c
a	c
manager	c
,	c
you	c
have	c
resposbillity	i
to	i
justify	i
this	c
problem	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
not	c
asking	c
for	c
full	c
payment	c
but	c
minimum	i
50	c
%	c
that	i
it	i
paid	c
for	c
nothing	c
but	c
the	c
disappoint	i
.	c

Thank	c
you	c

Yours	c

Fashion	c
,	c
what	c
is	c
fashion	c
?	c

In	c
particular	i
time	c
?	c

But	c
I	c
say	c
fashion	c
is	c
Artistic	c
insperation	i
which	c
expressed	i
by	c
fabric	c
and	c
all	c
sort	i
of	c
material	c
.	c

Now	i
a	i
days	i
fashion	c
play	i
big	i
roll	i
in	c
our	c
daily	c
life	c
.	c

Million	i
kinds	c
of	c
fashion	c
magazines	c
and	c
News	i
paper	i
tells	i
you	c
how	c
much	c
people	c
are	c
interested	c
in	c
fashion	c
.	c

Development	i
of	i
science	i
produce	c
new	c
materials	c
like	c
water	i
proof	i
or	c
fire	i
proof	i
fabrics	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
Castum	i
of	i
Astronuts	i
.	c

These	c
days	c
we	c
are	c
very	c
intrested	i
in	c
space	c
and	c
millenium	i
and	c
things	c
and	c
many	c
designers	c
showed	i
millenium	i
looks	c
recently	c
.	c

But	c
we	c
do	c
n't	c
wear	c
them	c
.	c

But	c
what	c
about	c
100	c
year	i
later	c
?	c

I	c
think	c
people	i
'll	i
wear	c
those	c
spacy	i
and	c
Ciber	i
looking	i
cloth	i
after	c
a	c
centry	i
.	c

What	c
do	c
you	c
think	c
?	c

Can	c
you	c
imagin	i
you	c
and	c
your	c
friends	c
going	c
picnic	i
to	c
the	c
Moon	c
with	c
silvery	i
skirt	c
with	c
Astronut	i
boots	c
with	c
fire	c
coming	c
out	c
at	c
the	c
bottom	c
of	c
your	c
boots	c
?	c

Endless	c
imagination	c
and	c
development	c
of	c
technology	c
will	c
lead	c
us	c
to	c
future	c
fashion	c
.	c

It	c
came	c
as	c
a	c
nice	c
surprise	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
let	c
you	c
know	c
that	c
I	c
can	c
only	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
that	c
is	c
the	c
only	c
time	c
I	c
can	c
take	c
leave	i
from	c
work	c
.	c

I	c
used	c
to	c
play	c
Tennis	c
at	c
tournament	c
level	c
and	c
now	c
I	c
play	c
it	c
for	c
enjoyment	c
instead	c
.	c

Since	c
all	c
accommodation	c
and	c
travel	c
costs	c
are	c
paid	c
for	c
,	c
Are	i
there	c
any	c
other	c
expenses	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
pay	i
?	c

How	c
much	c
money	c
I	i
should	i
have	c
with	c
me	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
cover	c
all	c
other	c
expenses	c
?	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
what	c
type	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	i
should	i
bring	c
?	c

I	c
would	c
be	c
grateful	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
let	c
me	c
know	i
the	c
above	c
information	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c
.	c

As	c
I	c
'm	c
a	c
compulsive	c
buyer	c
,	c
I	c
'd	c
probably	c
ended	i
up	c
buying	c
other	c
things	c
as	c
well	c
.	c

At	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
the	c
day	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
not	c
only	c
be	c
carrying	c
pile	i
of	c
shopping	c
bags	c
but	c
also	c
trying	c
to	c
squeeze	c
in	c
between	c
other	c
passengers	c
on	c
the	c
train	c
on	c
my	c
way	c
home	c
.	c

SECONDLY	c
,	c
AS	c
I	c
WROTE	c
BEFORE	c
,	c
THE	c
PLAY	c
STARTED	c
LATE	c
,	c
AND	c
FOR	c
ME	c
IT	c
WAS	c
TERRIBLE	c
TO	c
WAIT	c
FORTY	i
FIVE	i
MINUTES	c
.	c

THIRDLY	c
,	c
I	c
WAS	c
VERY	c
EMBARASED	i
TO	c
DISCOVER	c
THERE	c
WERE	c
NOT	i
DISCOUNTS	c
AT	c
THE	c
ENTRANCE	c
.	c

IN	c
FACT	c
THE	c
RESTAURANT	c
WAS	c
CLOSED	c
,	c
VERY	i
FAR	i
FROM	i
MY	i
THOUGHTS	i
.	c

FOR	c
THESE	c
REASONS	c
I	c
WOULD	c
LIKE	c
TO	c
ASK	c
FOR	c
MY	c
MONEY	c
BACK	c
.	c

BECAUSE	c
FOR	c
ME	c
IT	c
WAS	c
NOT	c
A	c
"	c
PERFECT	c
EVENING	c
OUT	c
"	c
.	c

I	c
AM	c
SURE	c
THIS	c
LETTER	c
WILL	c
RECEIVE	c
YOUR	c
PROMPT	c
ATTENTION	c
.	c

YOURS	c
FAITHFULLY	c

UNFORTUNATELY	c
,	c
PAT	c
WAS	c
NOT	c
VERY	c
GOOD	c
AT	c
KEEPING	c
SECRETS	c
.	c

THIS	c
WAS	c
LIKE	c
AN	c
ILLNESS	c
FOR	c
HIM	c
.	c

SO	c
MANY	c
TIME	i
HE	c
WAS	c
TOLD	c
:	c
"	c
PAT	c
I	i
SAY	i
THIS	c
SECRET	c
ONLY	c
TO	c
YOU	c
"	c
.	c

HE	c
WANTED	c
TO	c
DIE	c
FOR	i
THIS	c
.	c

THE	c
WORST	c
THING	c
IS	i
THAT	c
HE	c
COULD	c
NOT	c
IMPROVE	c
THIS	c
BEHAVIOUR	c
.	c

ONE	c
DAY	c
THE	i
FORTUNE	c
HELPED	c
OUR	c
POOR	c
PAT	c
.	c

ON	c
THE	c
BUS	c
HE	c
SAW	c
A	c
ROBBER	i
WHILE	c
HE	c
WAS	c
STEALING	c
A	c
WALLET	c
,	c
HE	c
WANTED	c
TO	c
SCREAM	c
,	c
BUT	c
HE	c
WAS	c
ASTONISHED	c
.	c

PAT	c
,	c
AS	c
HE	c
ALWAYS	c
DID	c
,	c
COULD	c
N'T	c
KEEP	c
THE	c
SECRET	c
,	c
EVEN	c
IF	c
HE	c
WAS	c
SCARED	c
.	c

Dear	c
sir	c
,	c
I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
express	c
my	c
complaint	i
about	c
the	c
organization	c
of	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
last	c
Saturday	c
evening	c
.	c

And	c
what	c
about	c
the	c
starting	c
time	c
?	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
annoyed	c
about	c
it	c
:	c
I	c
only	c
expected	c
the	c
discounts	c
you	c
had	c
promised	c
on	i
the	c
advertisement	c
and	c
,	c
as	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
university	c
student	c
,	c
I	c
would	i
have	c
a	c
right	c
on	i
it	i
.	c

At	i
the	i
top	i
of	i
everything	i
,	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
being	c
restructurated	i
,	c
so	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
have	c
my	c
dinner	c
either	c
!	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
terrible	c
evening	c
out	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
ask	c
you	c
for	c
a	c
refund	c
for	c
all	c
the	c
troubles	i
you	c
caused	c
me	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

My	c
personal	c
theory	c
is	c
completely	c
different	c
.	c

We	c
live	c
in	c
the	c
age	c
of	c
personal	c
computers	c
,	c
of	c
internet	i
,	c
of	c
the	c
mobile	c
phones	i
,	c
and	c
now	c
for	c
me	c
it	c
's	c
impossible	c
to	c
think	c
of	c
a	c
world	c
without	c
them	c
.	c

When	c
,	c
for	c
example	c
,	c
I	c
go	c
abroad	c
I	c
feel	c
closer	c
to	c
my	c
friend	i
and	c
to	c
my	c
family	c
than	c
before	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
now	c
I	c
'm	c
writing	c
my	c
thesis	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
use	c
my	c
pc	i
everytime	i
I	c
have	c
to	c
write	c
a	c
document	c
in	i
a	i
perfect	i
form	i
.	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
noticed	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
watching	c
it	c
that	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
was	c
performing	c
.	c

I	c
have	i
expected	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
to	c
perform	c
and	c
it	c
was	c
extremely	c
disappointing	c
.	c

I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
19:30	c
show	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
did	c
not	c
start	c
until	c
it	c
was	c
20:15	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
my	c
evening	c
planned	c
out	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
not	c
pleased	c
that	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
forty-five	c
minutes	c
late	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
there	c
to	c
buy	c
a	c
ticket	c
,	c
there	c
were	c
no	c
discounts	c
available	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
would	i
give	c
these	c
problems	c
your	c
immediate	c
attention	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

One	c
minute	c
I	c
told	c
her	c
the	c
biggest	c
secret	c
of	c
my	c
life	c
,	i
the	c
next	c
she	c
had	c
told	c
someone	c
all	c
about	c
it	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
overheard	c
girls	c
from	c
other	c
forms	c
gossiping	c
about	c
me	c
and	c
my	c
latest	c
crush	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
furious	c
.	c

Once	c
in	c
a	c
while	c
my	c
old	c
schoolmates	c
came	c
and	c
visited	c
me	c
and	c
we	c
had	c
lots	c
of	c
fun	c
together	c
,	c
just	c
like	c
the	c
old	c
times	c
.	c

However	c
I	i
felt	c
I	c
could	c
not	c
talk	c
to	c
them	c
about	c
the	c
problems	c
I	c
was	c
having	c
,	c
the	i
one	i
problem	i
about	i
my	c
parents	c
getting	c
a	c
divorce	c
.	c

My	c
dad	c
began	c
packing	c
his	c
things	c
the	c
very	c
next	c
day	c
,	c
to	i
his	c
new	c
apartment	c
where	c
he	c
would	c
live	c
while	c
waiting	c
for	c
the	c
divorce	c
papers	c
and	i
signing	i
them	i
.	c

That	c
period	c
of	c
my	c
life	c
was	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
worst	c
.	c

She	c
showed	c
up	c
on	c
my	c
doorstep	c
just	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
having	c
one	c
of	c
my	c
worst	c
days	c
.	c

She	c
told	c
me	c
she	c
heard	i
about	c
my	c
parents	c
'	c
divorce	c
and	c
wanted	c
to	c
help	c
.	c

She	c
let	c
me	c
pour	c
out	c
my	c
feelings	c
,	c
a	c
thing	c
I	c
did	c
not	c
do	c
to	i
anyone	c
.	c

Ever	c
since	c
,	c
she	c
gained	i
my	c
trust	c
and	c
told	i
her	c
my	c
feelings	c
and	c
secrets	c
.	c

Eventually	c
,	c
I	c
got	c
over	c
my	c
parents	c
'	c
divorce	c
and	c
lived	c
like	c
a	c
normal	c
,	c
happy	c
teenager	c
.	c

My	c
happiness	c
was	c
short	i
lived	i
.	c

She	c
had	c
been	c
killed	c
by	c
a	c
speeding	c
car	c
.	c

The	c
news	c
shook	c
me	c
to	c
the	c
very	c
core	c
.	c

I	c
cried	c
for	c
days	c
straight	i
,	c
eating	c
and	c
sleeping	c
very	c
little	c
.	c

I	c
am	i
still	i
missing	i
Pat	c
,	c
but	c
my	c
pain	c
is	c
nearly	c
over	c
now	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
only	c
comfort	c
myself	c
by	c
reminding	c
myself	c
that	c
at	c
least	c
she	c
died	c
knowing	c
I	c
had	c
forgiven	c
her	c
for	c
telling	c
my	c
secret	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
read	c
the	c
programme	c
and	c
I	c
find	c
it	c
very	c
appealing	c
,	c
specially	i
because	c
of	c
the	c
River	c
trip	c
to	c
Greenwich	c
.	c

There	i
will	i
be	i
shown	i
the	c
latest	c
fashions	c
,	c
leisure	i
and	c
sportwear	i
,	c
some	c
make	i
up	i
and	c
also	c
different	c
hairstyles	c
.	c

We	c
all	c
think	c
this	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
to	c
learn	c
more	c
about	c
London	i
daily	i
life	c
and	c
what	c
people	c
like	c
to	c
wear	c
.	c

We	c
all	c
hope	c
you	c
would	i
consider	c
our	c
suggestion	c
.	c

Yours	c
Sincerely	c
,	c

Almost	c
everyone	c
hates	c
other	c
people	c
gossip	i
in	i
their	c
private	c
things	i
.	c

It	c
's	c
a	c
natural	c
reaccion	i
to	c
be	c
angry	c
with	c
somebody	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
trust	c
for	c
gossiping	c
and	i
bothering	i
your	i
personal	i
thoughts	i
.	c

So	c
I	c
think	c
famous	c
people	c
,	c
no	c
matter	c
if	c
they	c
are	c
politicians	c
or	c
films	i
stars	c
do	i
n't	c
deserve	c
being	i
followed	c
by	c
journalists	c
every	c
time	c
they	c
are	c
trying	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
good	c
time	c
.	c

Dear	c
Manager	c
,	c

I	c
saw	c
your	c
advertisment	i
of	i
your	c
show	c
in	i
the	c
circle	c
theatre	c
,	c
over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
.	c

I	c
went	c
to	c
it	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
was	c
really	c
disappointed	c
about	c
some	i
thing	i
.	c

First	c
the	c
musical	i
show	c
,	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
started	i
at	c
20:15	c
,	c
and	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
was	i
written	c
at	i
19:30	c
,	i
then	i
also	i
was	i
written	c
that	c
the	c
actor	c
was	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
but	c
in	c
the	c
show	c
appeared	i
a	i
different	i
actor	i
,	c
that	c
was	c
really	c
disappointing	c
.	c

And	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
time	c
that	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
went	i
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

Mr	i
,	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
disappointed	c
with	c
the	c
show	c
so	c
I	c
want	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
sure	c
you	c
will	c
understand	c
my	c
reasons	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
,	c
and	c
she	c
went	c
to	c
her	c
house	c
to	c
speak	i
about	c
the	c
things	c
I	c
had	c
told	c
her	c
.	c

First	c
she	c
said	c
to	c
her	c
father	c
,	c
then	c
to	c
her	c
mother	c
and	c
finally	c
to	c
her	c
brother	c
,	c
that	c
I	c
was	c
from	c
another	c
planet	c
called	c
Orion	c
,	c
that	c
was	c
a	c
billion	c
kilometer	i
distance	i
of	i
Earth	c
and	c
that	i
I	c
was	c
so	c
ashamed	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
his	i
boyfriend	c
since	c
I	c
have	i
came	i
to	c
Earth	c
.	c

My	c
confession	c
caused	c
a	c
disaster	c
in	c
the	i
life	i
of	i
her	i
and	i
her	c
family	c
,	c
and	c
they	c
called	c
the	c
police	c
to	c
take	c
me	c
out	i
of	c
the	c
planet	c
or	c
arrested	i
,	c
so	c
that	c
I	c
ca	i
n't	i
see	c
her	c
again	c
.	c

After	c
they	c
caught	c
me	c
I	c
think	c
they	c
brought	c
me	c
to	c
the	i
Area	c
57	c
,	c
were	i
the	c
police	c
do	c
experiments	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
now	c
when	c
I	c
and	i
going	c
to	c
be	c
free	c
,	i
for	i
going	i
to	c
my	c
planet	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
congratulate	c
you	c
for	i
the	c
idea	c
,	i
I	c
think	c
that	c
it	i
's	i
very	i
important	i
the	i
development	i
of	i
the	i
arts	i
and	c
that	c
everybody	c
could	c
assist	i
without	c
paying	c
too	c
much	c
.	c

Having	c
a	i
ticket	c
for	c
all	c
the	c
events	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
method	c
because	c
it	c
's	c
an	i
organised	i
way	c
of	c
paying	c
and	c
you	c
win	i
time	c
.	c

Other	i
thing	c
,	i
is	c
that	c
the	c
artists	c
come	c
only	c
from	c
six	c
countries	c
,	c
so	c
do	c
n't	c
cheat	i
the	i
people	c
by	c
saying	c
that	c
they	c
are	c
from	c
all	c
the	i
world	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
you	c
should	c
call	i
more	c
artist	i
from	c
other	c
countries	c
and	c
have	c
some	c
concert	i
halls	i
bigger	i
or	c
may	i
be	i
change	c
the	c
distribution	c
.	c

Well	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
everything	i
is	i
told	i
but	c
could	c
you	c
tell	c
me	c
,	c
if	c
it	i
's	i
possible	c
,	c
if	c
there	c
will	c
be	c
more	c
plays	c
and	c
films	c
next	c
year	c
?	c

Faithfully	i
,	c

Dear	c
Jane	c
,	c

Thanks	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
,	i
it	c
was	c
nice	c
to	c
hear	c
from	c
you	c
again	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
want	i
me	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
how	i
about	i
the	i
rules	i
are	i
here	i
,	c
I	c
'll	c
start	c
.	c

You	c
must	c
pay	i
attention	i
always	i
because	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
if	c
the	c
teacher	c
will	c
ask	c
you	c
some	c
question	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
home	c
I	c
can	c
avoid	c
that	i
rules	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
go	c
dancing	c
whenever	c
I	c
want	c
but	c
telling	i
her	c
previously	i
.	c

So	c
,	c
I	c
'm	c
free	c
when	c
I	c
'm	c
out	c
of	c
the	i
school	c
.	c

Dear	c
Helen	c

hear	i
from	c
you	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

Last	c
month	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
great	c
time	c
in	c
Derby	c
.	c

As	c
I	c
told	c
you	c
two	c
month	i
ago	c
I	i
saw	c
the	c
advertisment	i
in	c
the	c
newspepper	i
.	c

They	c
did	c
not	c
new	i
each	c
one	i
.	c

I	c
really	c
liked	c
.	i

I	c
had	c
to	c
run	c
all	c
the	c
times	i
.	c

This	c
was	c
my	c
job	c
and	c
I	c
like	i
what	c
I	c
am	i
doing	c
.	c

The	c
consert	i
was	c
briliant	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
to	i
hear	i
the	c
new	i
from	i
yours	i
group	c
.	c

With	c
Love	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
received	c
your	c
letter	c
congratulating	c
me	c
on	c
having	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
extremely	c
excited	c
about	c
the	c
opportunity	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
your	c
camp	c
in	c
the	c
USA	c
.	c

It	c
does	c
not	c
matter	c
to	c
me	c
whether	c
I	c
stay	c
in	c
tent	i
or	c
log	i
cabin	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
tent	i
to	i
be	c
much	i
more	i
in	i
contact	c
with	c
wild	i
life	i
and	c
nature	c
.	c

The	c
activities	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
do	c
most	c
are	c
playing	c
basketball	c
and	c
Climbing	c
.	c

The	c
first	c
one	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
played	i
basketball	c
since	c
the	c
age	c
of	c
twelve	c
and	c
the	c
second	c
one	c
because	c
there	c
are	c
not	c
many	c
places	c
where	i
to	c
go	c
climbing	c
in	c
my	c
city	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

I	c
received	c
your	c
letter	c
last	c
week	c
in	c
which	c
you	c
told	c
me	c
that	c
you	c
want	c
to	c
hear	c
about	c
my	c
experience	c
at	c
the	c
pop	c
concert	c
.	c

We	c
have	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
problems	c
from	c
the	c
beggining	i
.	c

Another	c
problem	c
was	c
the	c
band	c
.	c

They	c
did	c
n't	c
want	c
to	c
play	c
until	c
the	c
room	i
were	i
crowded	c
.	c

Looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

Love	c
,	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Jane	i
Clark	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
express	c
my	c
dissatisfaction	c
with	c
International	i
Arts	c
Festival	c
,	c
which	c
was	c
organised	c
by	c
you	c
last	c
year	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
written	c
on	i
the	c
advertisment	i
that	c
there	c
would	c
be	c
stars	c
and	c
artist	i
from	c
around	c
the	c
world	c
I	i
believe	c
that	c
it	c
's	c
difficult	c
to	c
arrange	c
meetings	c
with	c
foreign	c
stars	c
but	c
there	c
were	c
artist	i
from	c
only	c
six	c
countries	c
and	c
in	c
my	c
opinion	c
there	c

should	c
be	c
more	c
.	c

That	c
was	c
the	c
reason	c
why	c
some	c
people	c
were	c
complaining	c
.	c

Lastly	c
,	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
a	c
piece	c
of	c
advice	c
.	c

I	c
suggest	c
you	c
invite	c
some	c
film	c
stars	c
,	c
because	c
they	c
are	c
very	c
famous	c
and	c
people	c
like	c
them	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c

There	c
are	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
possibilities	c
to	i
earn	i
some	c
money	c
but	c
of	c
course	c
the	c
young	c
are	c
not	c
able	c
to	c
get	c
well-paid	i
job	c
,	c
because	c
they	c
are	c
not	c
enough	i
experienced	i
and	i
educated	i
.	c

They	c
have	c
to	c
think	c
about	c
some	i
season	i
jobs	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
the	i
good	c
way	c
to	c
earn	c
money	c
is	c
,	i
to	c
help	c
the	c
old	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
you	c
can	c
find	c
an	c
easy	c
job	c
in	c
a	c
shopping	c
centre	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
are	c
good	i
mathematic	i
you	c
can	c
be	c
a	c
seller	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
pleased	c
to	i
that	c
I	c
've	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
at	i
camp	i
california	i
in	i
the	i
U.S.A	i
during	i
two	i
weeks	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
travel	i
on	i
July	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
going	c
to	c
finish	c
the	i
college	c
at	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
June	c
and	c
I	c
will	c
work	c
the	i
first	c
of	c
august	i
.	c

About	i
the	c
accomodation	i
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
,	i
I	c
think	c
that	c
will	c
be	c
more	i
safety	i
about	i
all	c
my	c
stuff	i
.	c

Also	c
,	c
I	c
choose	c
surfing	c
,	i
I	c
love	c
this	c
sport	c
.	c

I	c
've	c
know	i
idea	c
what	c
kind	i
of	i
weather	i
it	i
is	i
in	c
USA	i
could	i
you	c
let	c
me	c
know	c
what	c
type	c
of	c
clothes	c
should	i
I	i
bring	c
with	c
me	c
.	i

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
last	c
letter	c
,	i
I	i
'm	i
really	c
envy	c
you	c
holiday	i
under	i
the	c
sun	c
.	c

Last	c
month	c
was	c
amazing	c
for	c
me	c
,	i
I	c
was	c
helping	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
.	c

All	c
right	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
n't	c
able	c
to	c
do	c
all	c
the	c
stuff	c
like	c
the	c
lights	c
the	i
stereo	i
,	c
the	c
sound	c
but	c
I	i
've	i
been	i
helping	i
to	c
built	i
the	c
stage	c
and	c
the	i
installation	i
of	i
micros	i
.	c

The	c
stage	c
was	c
gigantesque	i
the	c
crowed	i
could	i
be	i
all	i
around	i
.	c

I	c
keep	i
a	i
very	c
good	c
souvenir	i
about	i
this	c
experience	c
.	c

Do	c
you	c
want	c
join	i
me	c
?	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

I	c
address	c
this	c
letter	c
to	c
the	c
manager	c
of	c
the	c
theatre	c
.	c

I	c
want	c
to	c
talk	c
to	c
you	c
about	c
an	c
evening	c
I	c
had	c
in	c
your	c
theatre	c
:	i
OVER	c
THE	c
RAINBOW	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
very	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
and	c
it	c
was	c
because	c
many	i
points	i
.	c

I	c
was	i
coming	i
to	c
see	c
him	c
but	c
there	c
was	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
.	c

Second	c
point	c
,	c
the	c
musical	i
show	c
had	i
to	c
begin	c
at	c
7:30	c
PM	c
but	c
we	c
have	i
waited	i
for	c
fourty	i
five	i
minutes	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
show	c
started	i
.	c

Fourth	c
point	c
,	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
visit	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
and	c
no	c
one	c
did	i
n't	i
know	i
why	c
!	c

Well	c
,	c
as	c
you	c
see	c
it	i
was	c
n't	c
a	c
"	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
!	c
"	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
you	c
could	c
give	c
to	i
me	c
some	c
money	c
back	c
because	c
I	c
really	c
have	c
the	c
impression	c
that	c
your	c
advertisement	c
is	c
wrong	c
.	c

How	c
has	c
modern	c
technology	c
changed	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
?	c

Everyday	i
at	c
7:00	c
a.m	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
woken	c
up	c
by	c
my	c
radio	c
.	c

After	i
,	c
when	c
I	c
take	i
my	c
breakfast	c
,	c
I	c
use	c
my	c
toaster	c
for	c
my	c
bread	c
and	c
,	c
as	c
I	c
want	c
a	i
hot	c
milk	c
,	c
I	c
use	c
my	c
modern	c
oven	i
too	c
.	c

This	c
little	c
paragraph	i
shows	c
that	c
I	c
depend	c
of	i
technology	c
and	c
,	c
more	i
over	i
,	c
because	c
I	c
'm	c
in	c
an	c
electronic	c
eegenering	i
school	c
,	c
I	c
'm	c
keen	c
on	c
technology	c

Dear	c

Festival	c

I	c

one	c
of	c

last	c
International	c
Arts	c
Festival	c

Most	c
of	c
attractions	i
are	i
excellent	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
point	c
out	c
that	c
"	i
quality	i
is	i
high	i
,	i
but	i
quantity	i
is	i
not	i
enough	i

First	c

I	c
suppose	c

I	c
'd	c

for	i
your	c
question	c

AT	i

Japan	c
,	c
generally	c
school	c
rules	c

more	c
strictly	i

action	i
which	c
is	i
prohibitted	i
at	c
school	c
is	i
no	c

at	c

down	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
rules	c
at	c

"	c
Whenever	c
the	c
students	c

am	c
writing	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
the	c
good	c
programme	c
,	c
especially	c
on	i
Wednesday	c
,	c
because	c
the	c
other	c
student	i
and	c
I	c
like	c
Art	i
Galleries	i
.	c

But	c
,	i
the	i
last	c
Friday	c
,	c
we	c
have	i
seen	i
an	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
"	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
.	i

Now	c
,	c
we	c
want	c
to	c
know	c
if	c
it	c
is	c
possible	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
watch	i
this	c
Show	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
14th	c
March	c
in	c
the	c
Central	c
Exhibition	c
Hall	c
between	c
10.00	c
and	c
19.00	c
.	c

We	c
think	c
that	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
just	c
one	i
time	i
per	c
year	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
free	c
for	c
stundents	i
.	c

We	c
think	c
that	c
Monday	c
and	c
Wednesday	c
are	c
good	c
,	c
but	c
we	c
ask	c
you	c
to	c
change	c
the	c
programme	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
.	c

We	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
dangerous	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
knew	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
.	c

We	c
lived	i
in	i
my	c
aunt	c
's	c
house	c
who	i
was	c
in	c
the	c
center	i
of	c
the	c
village	c
.	c

My	c
aunt	c
told	c
me	c
it	c
was	c
the	i
famous	c
French	c
singer	c
's	c
house	c
.	c

One	c
night	c
,	c
I	c
heard	c
a	c
strange	c
sound	c
.	c

They	c
went	c
into	c
the	c
house	c
through	c
a	c
window	c
.	c

I	c
went	c
near	c
the	c
house	c
and	c
waited	c
to	c
look	i
what	c
it	i
would	c
happen	c
.	c

When	c
the	c
other	c
man	c
came	c
out	c
,	c
I	c
caught	c
him	c
and	c
fighted	i
him	c
.	c

During	c
my	c
visit	c
there	c
occurred	i
some	i
problems	i
,	i
that	c
made	c
my	c
evening	c
completely	c
disappointing	c
.	c

Not	i
only	i
the	i
play	i
started	c
45	c
minutes	c
after	c
it	c
was	c
planned	c
,	c
but	c
as	i
the	c
actors	c
eventually	c
appeared	c
at	i
the	c
stage	c
,	c
have	i
I	i
also	i
seen	i
,	i
that	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
was	i
replaced	c
by	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
,	c
who	c
was	c
very	c
disappointing	c
in	c
his	c
role	c
.	c

To	c
make	c
matters	c
even	c
worse	c
,	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
without	c
any	c
information	c
given	i
about	c
the	c
reason	c
of	i
it	i
's	i
closure	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
see	c
,	c
my	c
evening	c
in	c
your	c
theatre	c
absolutely	i
was	c
n't	c
perfect	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

Have	c
you	c
ever	c
thought	c
of	c
a	i
year	c
2100	c
?	c

Do	c
you	c
think	c
,	i
that	c
world	i
will	c
be	c
different	c
from	c
current	i
world	c
then	c
?	c

And	c
if	c
I	c
were	c
asked	c
,	c
what	i
will	c
be	c
completely	c
different	c
in	c
year	i
2100	c
,	c
I	i
would	c
say	c
:	c
clothes	c
.	c

Most	c
of	c
the	c
scientists	c
,	c
when	c
asked	c
about	c
the	c
Earth	c
in	c
a	c
hundred	c
years	c
claim	i
,	i
that	c
it	c
is	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
absolutely	c
scorching	c
here	c
then	c
.	c

What	c
is	c
more	c
,	c
ground	i
will	c
be	c
so	c
hot	c
,	i
that	c
going	i
will	c
only	c
be	c
possible	c
in	c
huge	c
shoes	c
,	c
which	c
should	i
be	c
massive	c
,	c
but	c
not	c
heavy	c
at	c
all	c
.	c

Another	c
effect	c
of	c
the	c
scorching	c
weather	c
could	c
be	c
,	i
that	c
people	c
wo	c
n't	c
be	c
allowed	c
to	c
get	i
out	c
of	c
the	c
building	c
unless	c
they	c
wear	c
specially	c
designed	c
caps	c
or	c
hats	c
,	c
made	c
of	c
materials	c
,	i
that	c
are	c
n't	c
known	c
yet	c
.	c

But	c
in	c
case	c
my	c
predictions	c
are	c
right	c
,	c
maybe	c
you	c
should	c
buy	c
a	c
new	c
pair	c
of	c
shorts	c
?	c

Dear	c
Jane	c
Clark	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
this	c
letter	c
to	c
give	c
my	c
opinion	c
on	c
the	c
last	c
International	c
arts	i
festival	i
.	c

Firstly	c
I	i
found	c
amazing	i
the	i
number	i
of	i
starts	i
and	i
artist	i
who	i
came	i
to	i
the	i
festival	i
although	c
they	c
where	i
from	c
only	c
six	c
countries	c
around	c
the	c
world	c
.	c

The	c
concerts	c
and	c
the	c
dance	c
show	c
were	c
incredable	i
,	c
except	c
for	c
the	c
classical	c
concert	c
that	c
halled	i
to	c
small	c
.	c

I	c
suggest	c
to	i
do	i
a	c
couple	c
more	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

The	c
art	c
exhibition	c
showed	c
us	c
a	c
new	c
life	i
style	i
and	c
society	c
,	i
it	i
was	c
totaly	i
different	c
from	c
ours	c
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
I	c
am	i
impresed	i
on	i
all	c
the	c
good	c
organisation	c
,	c
the	c
service	c
and	c
the	c
cost	c
of	c
the	c
weekend	c
ticket	c
for	c
all	c
events	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
that	c
you	c
organice	i
this	c
festival	c
for	c
all	c
the	c
following	i
years	c
.	c

Your	i
Sincerely	c

How	c
are	c
you	c
?	c

I	i
'm	i
pleased	c
to	c
hear	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

The	c
rules	c
in	c
my	c
country	c
are	c
standart	i
,	c
I	c
mean	c
,	c
the	c
rules	c
are	c
very	c
similar	c
to	c
other	c
countries	c
in	c
Europe	c
.	c

At	c
school	c
you	c
are	c
n't	c
allowed	c
to	c
bring	c
connected	i
movil	i
phones	c
although	c
there	c
are	i
more	c
than	c
one	c
student	c
that	c
does	c
it	i
.	c

As	i
well	i
you	i
are	i
n't	i
allowed	c
to	c
bring	c
drugs	c
or	c
arms	c
,	c
to	c
smoke	c
or	c
to	c
drink	c
alcohol	c
inside	c
the	c
school	c
.	c

I	c
can	c
go	c
out	c
at	c
night	c
once	c
a	c
week	c
if	c
I	c
tell	c
them	c
were	i
I	c
'm	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
.	c

In	i
case	i
I	c
lie	c
them	i
or	c
do	c
n't	c
explain	c
my	i
plans	c
that	c
my	c
friends	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
I	c
want	i
be	c
able	c
to	c
go	c
out	c
.	c

As	c
well	c
have	i
the	c
responsability	i
to	i
look	i
after	c
my	c
brother	c
in	i
case	i
they	c
are	c
n't	c
at	c
home	c
.	c

I	c
can	c
only	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
,	c
because	c
the	c
Hospital	c
I	c
work	c
for	c
has	c
accepted	i
my	c
holidays	c
on	i
that	c
month	c
.	c

Regarding	c
the	c
accommodation	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
staying	c
in	c
log	i
cabins	i
.	c

I	c
have	c
never	c
liked	c
staying	c
in	c
tents	c
because	c
I	c
think	c
they	c
are	c
uncomfortable	c
,	c
especially	c
if	c
the	c
stay	c
is	c
going	c
to	c
last	c
more	c
than	c
two	c
or	c
three	c
days	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
never	c
been	c
good	c
at	c
team	c
sports	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
really	c
like	c
basketball	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
can	c
be	c
very	c
interesting	c
to	c
meet	c
other	c
people	c
by	c
means	c
of	c
this	c
team	c
sport	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
be	c
very	c
grateful	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
give	c
me	c
some	c
aditional	i
information	c
.	c

What	c
type	c
of	c
clothes	c
must	c
I	c
take	c
?	c

Is	c
it	c
necessary	c
to	c
take	c
dressed	i
cloth	i
for	c
any	c
formal	c
events	c
?	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

Thanks	c
for	c
your	c
last	c
letter	c
.	c

I	c
can	c
understand	c
why	c
you	c
are	c
impatient	c
to	c
hear	c
about	c
my	c
experience	c
at	c
the	c
concert	c
last	c
month	c
.	c

She	c
is	c
wonderful	c
.	c

When	c
we	c
finished	c
clearing	i
,	c
some	c
of	c
us	c
offered	c
our	i
help	i
to	c
enter	i
the	c
sound	c
equipment	c
into	c
the	c
stadium	c
.	c

They	c
said	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
necessary	c
and	c
we	c
sat	c
down	c
on	c
the	c
grass	c
and	c
observed	c
how	c
the	c
scenary	i
was	c
being	c
prepared	c
for	c
the	c
concert	c
.	c

And	c
then	c
,	c
when	c
all	i
was	c
prepared	i
,	c
Celine	c
appeared	c
in	i
the	c
scenary	i
to	c
make	i
some	i
sound	c
tests	i
.	c

I	c
was	c
astonished	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
incredible	c
!	c

I	c
was	c
so	c
near	c
her	c
!	c

She	c
gave	c
it	c
to	c
me	c
with	c
a	c
great	c
smile	c
and	c
gave	c
permission	c
to	c
take	c
a	c
photograph	c
of	c
both	c
of	c
us	c
.	c

And	c
she	c
dedicated	c
the	c
photograph	c
to	c
me	c
!	c

We	c
will	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
talk	c
bout	i
the	c
concert	c
and	c
we	c
will	c
listen	c
together	c
to	c
the	i
last	i
Celine	i
Dion	i
's	i
C.D	i
.	i

Let	c
me	c
know	c
if	c
you	c
are	c
going	c
to	c
come	c
so	c
that	c
I	c
prepare	i
the	c
bedroom	c
to	c
put	c
you	c
up	c
.	i

Please	c
,	c
come	c
!	c

Best	c
wishes	c
,	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

Anyway	c
,	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
buy	c
my	c
ticket	c
,	c
since	c
I	c
thought	c
the	c
play	c
was	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
good	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
sitted	i
in	c
my	c
chair	c
and	c
waited	c
for	c
45	c
minutes	c
until	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
,	c
that	i
is	c
an	c
unacceptable	c
delay	c
.	c

The	c
night	c
had	i
been	i
terrible	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
could	c
be	i
saved	c
by	c
a	c
nice	c
dinner	c
in	c
your	c
restaurant	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
been	i
closed	c
because	c
the	c
heater	c
was	c
not	c
working	c
due	c
to	c
leaking	i
.	c

As	c
you	c
can	c
see	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
the	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
your	c
advertisement	c
talked	c
about	c
.	c

How	c
has	c
modern	c
technology	c
changed	c
your	c
daily	c
lief	i
.	i

Modern	c
technology	c
has	c
brought	c
many	i
discoveries	i
which	c
have	c
made	c
our	c
daily	c
lives	c
much	c
easier	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
internet	i
has	c
given	c
us	c
the	c
possibility	i
of	i
acessing	i
reliable	c
information	c
very	c
fast	c
.	c

I	c
guess	c
science	c
is	c
about	c
solving	c
our	c
daily	c
problems	c
with	c
technological	c
advances	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
was	c
younger	c
I	i
remember	c
that	c
when	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
study	c
or	c
to	c
work	c
on	c
a	c
school	c
project	c
I	c
would	c
take	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
time	c
researching	c
on	i
libraries	c
,	c
looking	c
for	c
old	c
books	c
.	c

Today	c
I	c
can	c
connect	c
to	c
the	c
Internet	c
and	c
find	c
all	c
the	c
information	c
I	c
need	c
faster	c
than	c
you	c
can	c
imagine	c
.	c

But	c
technology	c
is	c
not	c
just	c
about	c
studying	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
entertainment	c
too	c
!	c

everything	c
in	c
a	c
zap	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
.	i

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
you	i
about	c
our	c
journey	i
which	c
you	c
have	c
already	i
orginesed	i
.	c

We	c
saw	c
your	i
details	c
and	c
enjoyed	i
them	i
.	c

One	c
more	c
thing	c
about	c
show	i
is	c
,	i
it	i
's	c
free	c
for	c
students	c
.	c

This	c
changing	i
,	i
give	i
us	c
an	i
opportunity	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
show	i
on	c
Tuesday	c
afternoon	c
.	c

We	c
hope	c
you	c
an	i
accept	c
our	c
suggestion	c
.	c

A	c
PRIVATE	c
LIFE	c

All	c
people	c
have	c
some	c
difficulties	c
about	i
their	c
job	i
but	c
some	c
of	i
them	i
have	c
more	c
than	c
the	i
others	c
.	c

Reason	i
for	c
this	c
;	i
they	i
are	c
famous	c
and	c
everybody	c
wants	c
to	c
learn	i
about	c
them	c
.	c

Having	c
a	c
private	c
life	c
is	c
important	c
for	c
everybody	c
.	c

if	i
you	c
are	c
a	c
famous	c
person	c
,	c
for	c
example	c
singer	i
,	c
film	c
star	c
,	c
politician	c
or	c
well-know	i
footballer	c
,	c
you	c
have	c
n't	c
get	i
any	c
choice	c
.	c

so	i
journalists	c
are	i
following	i
you	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
.	c

I	c
know	c
,	i
they	c
are	c
not	c
like	c
us	c
.	c

They	c
nead	i
to	c
be	c
with	c
their	c
family	c
in	c
silence	i
.	c

We	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
to	c
learn	i
their	i
every	c
second	c
.	c

We	c
have	c
to	c
remember	c
that	c
,	i
they	c
need	c
a	c
private	c
life	c
like	c
us	c
.	c

We	c
can	c
love	c
them	c
without	c
disturbing	c
too	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
latest	c
musical	c
show	c
you	c
played	i
in	c
Circle	i
Theatre	c
.	c

It	c
is	i
a	c
wasting	i
of	c
time	c
.	c

Moreover	c
the	i
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
show	c
says	c
that	c
the	c
main	c
role	c
in	c
the	c
musical	c
plays	i
great	i
Danny	c
Brook	c
.	c

I	c
must	c
admit	c
I	c
'd	c
been	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
see	i
him	c
.	c

Also	c
discounts	i
for	c
tickets	c
was	i
n't	i
available	c
.	c

After	c
the	c
show	c
together	i
with	c
my	c
friends	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
romantic	c
supper	c
,	i
unfortunately	i
it	c
was	c
closed	c
without	i
any	i
sensible	i
reason	c
.	c

At	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
my	c
letter	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
if	c
it	c
is	c
possible	c
to	c
have	c
some	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

Besides	c
this	c
little	c
thing	c
she	c
is	c
actually	c
perfect	c
.	c

But	c
to	c
make	c
everything	c
clear	c
I	c
'll	c
start	c
from	c
the	c
beggining	i
.	c

It	c
was	c
two	c
years	c
ago	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
old	c
enough	c
to	c
go	c
somewhere	c
only	c
with	c
my	c
friends	c
.	c

Parents	i
were	c
very	c
pleased	c
and	c
happy	c
we	c
are	i
so	c
ambisious	i
.	c

We	c
promised	c
to	c
keep	c
it	c
in	i
secret	c
.	c

Two	c
days	c
before	c
going	c
Pat	i
was	c
packing	c
her	c
luggage	c
and	c
asked	c
her	c
mother	c
to	c
help	c
her	c
.	c

As	c
a	c
result	c
we	c
were	c
grouded	i
for	c
all	c
holidays	i
and	c
all	c
because	c
our	i
almost	c
perfect	c
Pat	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Clark	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
because	c
,	c
as	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
visitors	c
of	c
the	c
International	c
Arts	c
Festival	c
which	c
took	c
place	c
two	c
weeks	c
ago	c
in	c
our	c
city	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
let	c
you	c
know	c
some	c
of	c
my	c
opinions	c
-	c
and	c
suggestions	c
,	c
as	c
well	c
-	c
related	c
with	i
what	c
I	c
saw	c
in	i
the	c
festival	c
and	c
what	c
I	c
could	c
not	c
see	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
would	c
have	c
liked	c
to	c
find	c
.	c

It	i
is	i
known	i
of	i
all	i
the	i
lack	i
of	i
art	i
festivals	i
and	i
cultural	i
activities	i
in	i
general	i
that	i
shows	i
our	i
city	i
.	c

And	c
what	c
a	i
belter	i
thing	i
to	c
solve	c
this	c
than	c
to	c
give	c
the	c
festival	c
an	c
international	c
character	c
.	c

Another	c
important	c
thing	c
is	c
that	c
,	c
despite	c
the	c
number	c
and	c
quality	c
of	c
films	c
,	c
there	c
were	c
,	c
from	c
my	c
point	c
of	c
view	c
,	c
not	c
many	c
plays	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
talk	c
about	c
the	c
success	c
among	i
most	i
visitors	i
of	i
the	i
weekend	i
ticket	i
,	c
due	c
to	c
its	c
economical	c
price	c
and	c
because	c
of	c
its	c
comodity	i
in	i
use	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	i
,	c

Who	c
does	c
n't	c
want	c
to	c
earn	c
some	c
money	c
?	c

The	i
topic	i
says	c
that	c
young	c
people	c
have	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
problems	c
,	c
but	c
without	c
any	c
doubt	c
,	c
money	c
is	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
of	c
them	c
.	c

Another	c
thing	c
that	c
can	c
be	c
useful	c
is	c
to	c
make	c
some	c
pottery	c
or	c
do	c
original	c
paintings	c
and	c
sculptures	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
if	c
anything	i
of	c
the	c
above	c
result	i
,	c
you	c
can	i
prepare	i
the	i
classical	i
parties	c
in	c
discos	c
or	c
work	c
as	c
a	c
babysitter	c
It	i
does	c
n't	c
matter	c
how	c
,	c
the	c
aim	c
is	c
always	c
money	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
the	c
assistent	i
of	c
the	c
responsible	i
person	i
for	c
the	c
clothes	c
and	c
make-up	c
of	c
the	c
pop-group	i
,	i
realy	i
I	c
was	c
very	c
nervous	c
about	c
that	c
because	c
was	i
the	i
first	c
time	c
with	c
so	i
famous	c
people	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
happy	c
that	c
all	c
the	c
things	c
went	c
very	c
well	c
Kim	i
what	i
realy	i
particularly	c
liked	c
was	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
asked	c
to	c
do	c
the	c
make-up	c
on	c
my	c
on	i
realy	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
nervous	c
but	c
at	c
same	i
moment	i
very	c
happy	c
,	c
but	c
every	i
thing	i
when	i
well	c
and	c
everyboby	i
was	c
very	c
hapy	i
with	c
my	c
work	c
.	c

Best	c
Regards	i

Dear	c
Ms	c
Clark	c
,	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
great	c
idea	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
think	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
make	c
some	c
points	c
about	c
the	c
things	c
that	c
I	c
found	c
unsatisfactory	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
disappointed	c
that	c
the	c
artists	c
invited	c
were	c
from	c
only	c
six	c
countries	c
.	c

They	c
were	c
cold	c
and	c
moist	i
,	c
too	c
,	c
because	c
the	c
air-conditioning	c
system	c
was	c
insufficient	i
.	c

Thirdly	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
more	c
plays	c
and	c
films	c
should	c
be	c
shown	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

Dec	c
16th	c
,	c
2000	c

Dear	c
Mary	c
,	c

I	c
'm	c
glad	c
to	c
have	c
received	c
your	c
letter	c
and	c
I	c
'd	c
really	c
like	c
to	c
talk	c
about	c
the	c
school	c
and	c
family	c
rules	c
here	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
the	c
weirdest	c
rule	c
in	c
our	c
schools	c
is	c
that	c
we	c
must	c
wear	c
uniforms	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
.	c

Another	c
thing	c
different	i
from	c
your	c
schools	c
is	c
that	c
we	c
do	c
n't	c
change	c
classrooms	c
between	c
periods	c
.	c

Also	c
,	c
as	c
most	c
of	c
us	c
live	c
in	c
flats	c
,	c
we	c
're	c
not	c
allowed	c
to	c
listen	c
to	c
loud	c
music	c
or	c
run	c
or	c
play	c
ball	c
games	c
in	c
the	c
house	c
!	c

But	c
we	c
are	c
legally	c
allowed	c
to	c
play	c
instruments	c
like	c
the	c
piano	c
until	c
10	c
p.m	c
.	c

Anyway	c
,	c
I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
your	c
comments	c
about	c
our	c
rules	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
asked	c
by	c
the	c
class	c
to	c
propose	i
you	i
another	i
visit	i
.	c

Everybody	c
in	c
the	c
class	c
is	c
interested	c
in	c
this	c
show	c
,	c
and	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
for	c
us	c
to	c
see	c
it	c
,	c
especially	c
because	c
many	c
of	c
us	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
work	c
later	c
in	c
the	c
fashion	c
.	i

Consequently	c
,	c
I	c
proposed	i
to	i
change	i
the	c
programme	c
as	c
follows	c
;	i
on	c
Tuesday	c
afternoon	c
,	c
instead	c
of	c
shopping	c
,	c
we	c
could	c
go	c
to	c
this	c
show	c
and	c
we	c
could	c
go	c
shopping	c
on	c
Wednesday	c
afternoon	c
,	c
during	c
our	c
free	c
time	c
.	c

What	c
do	c
you	c
think	c
about	c
that	c
?	c

On	c
one	i
hand	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
true	c
because	c
famous	c
people	c
have	c
to	c
do	c
their	c
jobs	c
,	c
that	c
means	c
being	c
interviewed	c
,	c
giving	c
news	c
to	c
the	c
audiance	i
,	c
and	c
soon	i
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
especially	c
for	i
film	c
stars	c
,	c
lots	c
of	c
people	c
are	c
hoping	c
to	c
see	c
them	c
on	c
the	c
Tv	i
or	c
in	c
the	c
newspapers	c
,	c
and	c
this	c
is	c
really	c
good	c
for	c
their	c
fame	i
.	c

However	c
,	c
on	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
it	c
must	c
be	c
so	c
annoying	c
to	c
be	c
followed	c
by	c
journalists	c
or	c
photographs	i
all	c
the	c
time	c
.	c

You	c
ca	c
n't	c
go	c
outside	c
quietly	i
,	c
and	c
there	c
is	c
all	i
the	i
time	i
a	c
crownd	i
of	c
people	c
who	c
stands	i
in	c
front	c
of	c
your	c
house	c
waiting	c
for	c
you	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
sure	c
that	c
nobody	c
would	c
like	c
this	c
.	c

We	c
have	c
seen	c
it	c
in	c
the	i
advertisment	i
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

I	c
should	i
be	c
more	i
grateful	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
change	c
the	c
programme	c
so	c
as	c
to	i
go	c
to	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c
.	c

All	c
the	i
people	c
have	c
the	c
right	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
private	c
life	c
without	c
others	i
people	c
to	i
disturb	i
them	c
following	i
all	i
the	c
time	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
the	c
government	c
I	i
responsible	c
for	c
the	c
private	c
life	c
of	c
the	c
people	c
.	c

All	c
the	i
people	c
have	c
the	c
right	c
to	c
live	c
free	i
without	i
to	i
be	i
disturbed	c
by	c
other	c
.	i

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
Musical	c
Show	i
'	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
'	c
permormed	i
on	i
the	c
Circle	c
theatre	c
last	c
week	c
.	c

To	c
begin	c
with	c
,	c
there	c
were	c
no	c
discounts	c
available	c
,	c
and	c
nobody	c
seemed	c
to	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
explain	c
the	c
reason	c
.	i

The	c
new	c
actor	c
was	c
not	c
as	c
good	c
as	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
and	c
he	c
did	c
not	c
perform	c
the	i
show	c
as	c
he	c
should	c
have	c
done	c
.	c

What	c
was	c
suppoused	i
to	c
be	c
a	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
turned	c
to	i
be	c
disappointing	i
one	c
instead	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
receiving	c
your	c
response	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

However	c
,	c
technology	c
has	c
also	c
brought	c
many	c
problems	c
to	c
Society	c
.	c

Technology	c
brings	i
me	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
new	c
possibilities	c
every	c
day	c
,	c
and	c
it	c
also	c
makes	c
everything	c
easier	c
.	c

If	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
know	c
how	c
a	c
friend	c
is	c
,	c
I	c
just	c
have	c
to	c
phone	c
him	c
;	c
I	c
can	c
see	c
how	c
the	c
world	c
is	c
going	i
on	c
only	i
by	c
switching	c
on	c
the	c
television	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
can	c
cook	c
in	c
some	i
minutes	c
using	c
the	c
Microvelle	i
oven	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
negative	c
aspects	c
in	i
the	c
way	c
that	c
technology	c
affects	c
my	c
life	c
.	c

As	c
technology	c
develops	c
so	c
fast	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
always	c
new	c
things	c
to	c
buy	c
,	c
and	c
it	c
also	c
reduces	c
the	c
amount	c
of	c
jobs	c
available	c
,	c
so	c
it	c
is	c
getting	c
hard	c
to	c
find	c
a	c
job	c
.	c

In	c
conclussion	i
,	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
technology	c
has	c
two	c
faces	c
which	c
affects	i
my	c
life	c
as	c
well	c
as	c
everybody	c
else	c
's	c
life	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
,	c

I	c
bought	c
a	c
ticket	c
at	c
the	c
box	c
office	c
but	c
there	c
were	c
not	c
any	c
discounts	c
for	c
student	i
like	c
you	c
said	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
show	c
and	c
also	c
the	c
show	c
had	i
to	c
start	c
at	c
19.30	c
but	c
on	c
that	c
day	c
it	c
delaied	i
about	c
45	c
minutes	c
.	c

There	c
are	i
Robert	c
Alan	c
and	c
Jack	c
Ruby	c
instead	c
of	c
them	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c

The	c
sun	c
was	c
shining	c
and	c
wind	i
were	i
breezing	i
like	c
we	c
had	c
imaged	i
.	c

Eventhrough	i
we	i
could	i
spend	i
our	i
holiday	i
there	i
but	i
with	i
my	i
mum	i
and	i
I	i
just	i
found	i
that	i
it	i
was	i
fantasy	i
time	i
which	i
I	i
had	i
never	i
though	i
about	i
it	i
.	c

From	c
now	c
on	c
I	i
do	c
n't	c
want	c
to	c
tell	i
something	i
secrets	i
to	i
Pat	i

always	c
tell	i

Dear	c

I	c
would	c

I	c
would	c

the	i
lesson	i
and	c
some	c
other	c
rooms	c
while	c
activities	c
were	c
taking	c
place	c

I	c
think	i
also	i
that	c
will	i
be	c
a	c
good	c
idea	c
to	c
take	c
some	c
general	c
plans	i
of	c
the	c
school	c
area	c
as	c
there	c
is	c
a	c

Hi	c
Kim	c
!	c

It	c
's	c
great	c
to	c
hearing	i
from	c
you	c
!	c

The	c
singer	c
was	c
fabulous	c
and	c
the	c
musicians	c
played	c
fantastic	c
songs	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
employed	c
in	c
the	i
security	i
service	i
.	c

I	c
had	c
to	c
look	c
after	c
people	c
near	c
the	c
stage	c
.	c

The	c
organiser	c
gave	c
me	c
a	c
radio	c
and	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
advise	c
the	c
other	c
staff	c
members	c
in	c
case	c
of	c
disorder	i
.	c

I	c
suggest	c
you	c
to	i
try	i
this	c
kind	c
of	c
experience	c
.	c

You	c
should	c
be	c
pride	i
of	c
you	i
helping	i
people	c
who	c
suffers	i
,	c
and	c
at	c
the	c
same	c
time	c
you	c
may	i
enjoy	c
yourself	c

Love	c

For	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
I	c
wish	i
I	i
came	i
to	c
Camp	c
California	c
,	c
and	c
now	c
my	c
dream	c
is	c
about	c
to	c
become	i
true	c
.	c

Since	c
this	c
stay	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
is	c
a	c
good	c
occasion	i
to	c
discover	i
new	c
activities	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
sail	c
and	c
climb	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
beginner	c
in	i
both	c
activities	c
.	c

Then	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
will	c
need	c
there	c
,	c
and	c
if	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
bring	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
money	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

What	c
a	c
great	c
experience	c
that	c
was	c
!	c

The	c
first	c
one	c
is	c
that	c
the	c
band	c
I	c
have	c
helped	c
,	c
although	c
it	c
has	c
n't	c
met	i
success	c
yet	c
,	c
is	c
really	c
good	c
.	c

I	c
already	c
know	c
them	c
,	i
I	c
have	c
even	c
helped	c
them	c
at	c
one	c
of	c
their	c
concert.	i
"	c

Moreover	c
,	c
the	c
work	c
I	i
've	i
had	i
to	c
do	c
,	c
apart	c
from	c
carrying	c
material	i
,	c
was	c
essentially	c
to	c
sell	c
tickets	c
for	c
the	c
concert	c
,	c
which	c
has	i
allowed	c
me	c
to	c
meet	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
nice	c
people	c
and	c
to	c
become	c
friend	i
with	c
some	c
of	c
them	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Ryan	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
concerning	c
your	c
letter	c
about	c
my	c
win	i
in	i
your	i
competition	i
for	i
two	i
weeks	i
at	i
Camp	i
California	i
.	c

I	c
'm	c
very	c
happy	c
to	c
be	c
the	c
winner	c
from	i
your	c
competition	c
.	c

And	c
in	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
when	c
you	c
live	i
in	c
a	c
tent	c
,	c
you	c
have	i
more	i
from	i
the	i
nature	i
and	i
the	i
adventure	i
.	c

I	c
used	i
to	i
be	i
a	c
member	c
in	i
a	c
swimming	c
club	c
for	c
about	c
10	c
years	c
.	c

Lastly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
if	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
money	c
with	c
me	c
,	c
for	i
example	i
for	i
the	i
food	i
.	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
begin	c
this	c
composition	c
by	c
saying	c
that	c
,	i
not	i
for	i
everyone	i
is	i
shopping	i
the	i
same	i
.	c

For	c
some	c
people	c
it	c
's	c
great	c
fun	c
,	c
but	c
for	c
some	c
other	i
it	c
's	c
a	c
"	c
must	i
"	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
shopping	c
is	c
like	c
relaxing	c
.	c

I	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
very	c
often	c
,	c
to	c
look	c
around	c
and	c
to	c
buy	c
some	c
new	c
clothes	c
.	c

As	c
long	c
as	c
I	c
am	c
not	c
searching	c
for	c
something	c
specific	c
.	c

Then	c
it	c
is	c
perhaps	c
better	c
,	i
when	c
you	c
make	c
an	c
appointment	c
in	c
one	c
hour	c
and	c
everybody	c
enjoys	i
the	i
shopping	c
alone	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
,	c

The	c
students	c
in	c
my	c
class	c
have	c
seen	c
an	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
and	c
we	c
would	c
all	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
dangerous	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
knew	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
.	c

Otherwise	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
keep	c
walking	c
untill	i
the	c
train	c
start	i
.	c

When	c
I	c
did	c
that	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
traveling	i
around	c
Japan	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
windy	c
spring	c
day	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
sitting	c
under	c
a	c
full-bloomed	c
cherry	c
blossam	i
tree	c
.	c

Inside	c
the	c
dark	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
alone	c
and	c
only	c
the	c
moon	i
light	i
helped	c
me	c
to	c
see	c
the	i
things	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
give	c
my	c
opinion	c
about	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
called	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
advertisement	c
,	c
it	c
was	i
written	i
that	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
London	c
's	c
newest	c
and	c
best	c
musical	c
show	c
.	c

Well	c
,	c
it	c
might	c
be	c
the	c
newest	c
one	c
but	c
certainly	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
the	c
best	c
one	c
.	c

The	c
actor	c
was	c
somebody	c
else	c
and	c
this	c
was	c
something	i
disappointing	c
.	c

The	c
show	c
should	c
have	c
started	c
at	c
19:30	c
but	c
,	i
it	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
.	c

Which	c
means	i
,	i
I	c
had	c
to	c
wait	c
there	c
for	c
45	c
minutes	c
.	c

And	c
also	c
,	c
it	c
was	i
written	i
that	c
the	i
discounts	c
were	c
available	c
but	c
they	c
were	c
not	c
.	c

After	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
visit	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

I	c
had	i
given	i
£	c
20	c
and	c
now	c
,	i
I	c
would	c
be	c
pleased	c
if	c
you	c
give	i
some	c
of	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
terrible	c
evening	c
out	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
the	c
next	c
musical	c
show	c
would	i
be	i
a	c
better	c
one	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	i
,	c

MODERN	c
TECHNOLOGY	c

In	c
the	c
past	c
,	c
everything	c
was	c
very	c
different	c
.	c

People	c
had	c
completely	c
different	c
life-styles	i
.	c

People	c
were	i
using	i
candles	c
to	c
see	c
around	c
them	c
.	c

Modern	c
technology	c
has	c
changed	c
our	c
daily	c
life	c
a	c
lot	c
.	c

You	c
can	c
communicate	c
with	c
other	c
people	c
any	c
time	c
you	c
want	c
.	c

Nearly	c
90	c
per	c
cent	c
of	c
people	c
know	c
how	c
to	c
use	c
a	c
computer	c
and	c
computers	c
are	c
used	c
in	c
every	c
section	i
of	c
our	c
lives	c
.	c

It	c
has	c
a	c
very	c
big	c
role	c
in	c
developing	c
a	c
country	c
.	c

When	c
you	c
look	c
around	c
,	c
you	c
can	c
easily	c
understand	c
that	c
modern	c
technology	c
is	c
used	c
in	i
everything	c
.	c

Dear	c
Jane	c
Clark	c
,	c

I	c
had	c
a	c
wonderful	c
time	c
at	c
the	c
International	c
Arts	c
Festival	c
.	c

The	c
performances	c
were	c
great	c
,	c
but	c
some	c
halls	c
were	c
too	c
small	c
to	c
accomodate	i
so	i
many	i
people	c
there	i
were	i
that	c
day	c
.	c

A	c
crowded	c
hall	c
is	c
not	c
good	c
to	i
enjoy	i
musics	i
.	c

Overall	c
,	c
however	c
,	c
the	c
festival	c
was	c
definitely	c
a	c
great	c
success	c
.	c

The	c
special	c
tickets	c
were	c
excellent	c
because	c
we	c
could	c
enjoy	c
arts	i
without	c
worrying	c
about	c
money	c
.	c

So	c
all	c
you	c
need	c
to	c
improve	c
is	i
to	i
have	i
larger	c
concert	c
halls	c
.	c

I	c
also	c
suggest	c
that	c
you	c
should	c
make	c
it	c
easier	c
to	c
find	c
out	c
where	c
and	c
what	c
is	c
being	i
held	i
using	c
more	c
notice	i
boards	i
.	c

I	c
have	c
no	c
doubt	c
that	c
you	c
will	c
succeed	c
in	i
next	c
year	c
's	c
festival	c
.	c

Sincerely	c
Yours	c
,	c

The	c
best	c
advantage	c
of	c
this	c
job	c
is	c
the	c
payment	i
.	c

It	c
is	c
very	c
good	c
considering	c
how	c
less	i
time	c
we	c
spend	c
on	c
it	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
about	c
3,000	c
yen	c
per	c
hour	c
in	c
my	c
district	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
also	c
attractive	c
that	c
this	c
job	c
rarely	c
affects	c
our	c
university	c
studies	c
.	c

Students	c
who	c
want	c
home	c
teachers	i
are	c
usually	c
primary	c
school	c
,	c
junior	c
high	c
school	c
,	c
or	c
senior	c
high	c
school	c
students	c
,	c
and	c
it	i
means	c
they	c
take	c
lessons	c
after	c
school	c
,	c
not	c
in	c
a	i
daytime	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
in	c
a	i
daytime	c
,	c
we	c
can	c
focus	c
in	i
our	c
studyings	i
.	c

It	c
is	c
not	c
so	c
easy	c
for	c
every	c
student	c
,	c
though	c
.	c

Because	c
teaching	c
requires	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
knowledge	c
.	c

You	c
have	c
to	c
be	c
much	c
smarter	c
than	c
your	c
student	c
,	c
and	c
you	c
also	c
need	c
to	c
prepare	c
for	c
lessons	c
,	c
for	i
it	c
is	c
your	c
responsibility	c
to	c
provide	c
your	c
student	c
right	i
information	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
see	c
,	c
teaching	c
is	c
a	i
hard	c
work	c
in	c
some	c
respect	i
.	c

What	c
I	c
am	c
most	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
,	i
is	c
the	c
River	c
trip	c
to	c
Greenwich	c
;	c
but	c
I	c
would	c
also	c
really	c
like	c
to	c
visit	c
the	c
Science	c
Museum	c
as	c
well	c
as	c
the	c
National	c
Gallery	c
!	c

We	c
thought	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
great	c
experience	c
for	c
us	c
since	c
we	c
quite	i
do	c
n't	c
have	c
such	c
opportunities	c
in	c
our	c
everyday	c
life	c
!	c

It	c
was	c
dangerous	c
but	c
I	c
knew	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
.	c

Someone	c
had	c
to	c
react	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
to	c
react	c
!	c
...	c
otherwise	c
I	c
would	c
have	c
felt	c
responsible	c
for	c
his	c
death	c
,	c
for	c
the	c
rest	c
of	c
my	c
life	c
.	c

George	c
was	c
leaning	i
on	c
the	c
floor	c
,	c
surrounded	c
by	c
his	c
own	c
lake	c
of	c
blood	c
.	c

He	c
had	c
just	c
been	c
beaten	c
by	c
a	c
ground	i
of	c
white	c
men	c
.	c

And	c
yet	i
,	i
he	c
was	c
too	c
weak	c
to	c
resist	c
the	c
rats	c
,	i
coming	c
from	c
everywhere	c
and	c
eating	c
his	c
face	c
,	c
his	c
legs	c
and	c
his	c
arms	c
,	c
waiting	c
with	c
great	c
impatience	c
for	c
his	c
death	c
.	c

No	c
one	c
was	c
garding	i
him	c
.	c

They	c
were	c
all	c
celebrating	c
their	c
victory	c
with	c
a	c
gorgeous	c
dinner	c
around	c
the	c
fire	i
place	i
.	c

I	c
delivered	i
him	c
and	c
we	c
were	c
about	c
to	c
flee	c
,	c
taking	c
back	c
our	c
dignity	c
and	c
freedom	c
overwhelmed	i
with	c
join	i
,	c
when	c
we	c
saw	c
a	c
whiteman	i
,	c
targelting	i
his	c
gun	c
at	c
us	c
,	c
and	c
about	c
to	c
shoot	c
.	c

.	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
some	c
suggestion	i
about	i
next	c
year	i
festival	c
,	c
and	c
if	c
it	c
is	c
possible	c
I	c
can	i
give	i
you	c
some	c
opinions	c
about	c
this	c
year	i
festival	c
.	c

I	c
very	i
enjoy	i
on	i
it	i
,	c
but	c
some	c
of	c
the	c
halls	c
are	c
too	c
small	c
.	c

I	c
saw	c
that	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
people	c
were	c
unsatisfied	c
.	c

Another	c
thing	c
,	c
plays	i
and	c
films	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
ca	c
n't	c
consider	c
all	c
of	c
then	i
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
only	c
one	c
:	c
more	c
and	c
once	i
more	c
plays	c

Thank	c
you	c

your	c

I	c
'm	c
sorry	c
I	c
did	i
n't	i

I	c
have	i
examinations	c

but	c
now	c
I	c
have	c
plenty	c
of	c
time	c
and	c
I	c
can	c
write	c
a	c
letter	c
to	c
you	c

In	c
your	c
letter	c
you	c
ask	c
me	c
about	c
rules	i
in	i
school	i

home	i
I	i
have	i

I	c
think	c
that	c
they	c
are	c
the	c
same	c
as	c
yours	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
'm	c
not	c
sure	i
at	i
100	i
per	i
cent	i
so	c
I	c
vrite	i
:	i

I	c
often	c
go	c
shopping	c
and	c
help	c
my	c
mother	c
clean	c
windows	c

There	c
is	c
one	c
thing	c
I	c
like	i
to	c
change	c

the	i
treatment	c

by	i
teachers	c

That	c
's	c
all	c

I	c
hope	c
that	c
I	c
give	i
you	c

for	c
all	c

Give	c
my	c

I	c
'm	c
writting	i

to	c
answer	c
the	c
letter	c
in	c
which	c
,	c
as	c
you	c
probably	c
know	c
,	c
you	c
congratulated	c
me	c
for	c
having	c
won	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
and	c
tried	c
to	c
encourage	c
me	c
to	c
travel	c
to	c
California	c
and	c
attend	c
that	c
Camp	i

I	c
'm	c
going	c
to	c

you	c
all	c
the	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c

staying	c
wherever	c
you	c
want	c
me	c
to	c

They	c
're	c
more	c
comfortable	c

The	c
other	c
activities	c
do	c

appeal	c
me	i
much	c

but	c
I	c
'm	c
quite	c
good	c

I	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

I	c
'm	c
writting	i
to	c
you	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
how	c
much	c
I	c
enjoyed	c
last	c
Saturday	c
.	c

Unforgetable	i
.	c

I	c
had	c
always	c
dreamt	c
of	c
being	c
near	c
"	c
The	c
Cranberies	c
"	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
had	c
never	c
thought	c
that	c
the	c
dream	c
could	c
became	i
reallity	i
.	c

During	c
the	c
afternoon	c
,	c
Tim	c
and	c
me	i
spent	c
the	c
hours	c
before	c
the	c
concer	i
laying	i
on	i
the	c
park	c
next	c
to	c
the	c
sport	i
hall	i
where	c
the	c
concert	c
was	c
to	c
be	c
held	c
.	c

We	c
bought	c
the	c
tickets	c
and	c
then	c
we	c
sit	i
down	c
to	c
rest	c
.	c

After	c
a	c
few	c
minutes	c
the	c
dream	c
happened	c
:	c
Kare	c
-	c
the	c
guitarrist	i
-	c
appeared	c
over	c
there	c
.	c

And	c
then	c
we	c
bring	i
his	c
guitar	c
for	c
him	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
great	c
to	c
help	c
him	c
.	c

Finally	c
he	c
said	c
how	c
thankful	i
he	c
was	c
and	c
alowed	i
us	c
to	c
stay	c
with	c
them	c
till	c
the	c
concert	c
started	c
.	c

That	c
's	c
all	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Ryan	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
in	c
connection	c
with	c
the	c
competition	c
I	c
entered	c
a	c
month	c
ago	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
travel	c
only	c
after	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
my	c
exams	c
which	c
are	c
taking	c
place	c
in	c
June	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
July	c
would	c
suit	c
me	c
best	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
enjoy	i
a	i
lot	i
playing	c
tennis	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
sport	c
I	c
love	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
really	c
good	c
in	i
it	c
.	c

I	c
got	c
your	c
letter	c
yesterday	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
really	c
glad	c
to	c
hear	c
from	c
you	c
...	c
it	c
's	c
been	c
ages	c
since	c
you	c
last	c
wrote	c
to	c
me	c
!	c

It	i
lasted	c
three	c
days	c
and	c
I	i
've	i
had	i
the	c
best	c
fun	c
of	c
my	c
life	c
.	c

I	c
went	c
as	c
a	c
voluntier	i
staff	i
in	c
order	c
to	c
go	c
for	c
free	c
.	c

Our	c
duty	c
was	c
to	c
work	c
eight	c
ours	i
each	c
day	c
and	c
then	c
we	c
were	c
free	c
to	c
enjoy	c
the	c
rest	c
of	c
the	c
day	c
as	c
we	c
liked	c
.	c

It	c
has	i
been	i
the	c
best	c
experience	c
you	c
can	c
Imagine	i
.	c

No	c
matter	c
how	c
hard	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
work	c
,	c
everyone	c
had	i
always	c
humor	i
and	c
a	i
positive	c
mood	c
.	c

Lots	c
of	c
love	c

KANG	c
OFF	c
WOO	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

After	c
the	c
concert	c
I	c
had	c
got	i
an	c
opportunity	c
to	c
join	c
them	c
to	i
the	c
party	c
.	c

The	c
best	c
thing	c
was	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
learned	c
how	c
to	c
control	i
their	c
expensive	c
instruments	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
sung	c
my	c
favorite	i
songs	c
with	c
them	c
.	c

Especially	i
,	c
Mike	c
who	i
is	c
a	c
member	c
of	c
Metal	c
Potato	c
told	c
me	c
I	c
had	i
got	c
a	c
talent	c
to	i
play	i
the	c
electric	c
guitar	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
impossible	c
to	c
explain	c
all	c
my	c
experience	c
without	c
this	c
word	c
,	c
"	c
Brilliant	c
!	c
!	c
!	c
"	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
invite	c
you	c
to	c
their	c
next	c
concert	c
and	c
share	c
my	c
experience	c
with	c
you	c
.	c

Hello	i
,	c

Secondly	c
I	c
am	c
going	c
to	c
answer	c
your	c
questions	c
.	c

I	c
prefer	c
to	c
live	i
in	c
tents	c
,	c
where	c
it	c
is	c
easier	c
to	c
make	i
contacts	i
with	i
other	c
people	c
than	c
in	c
log	c
cabins	c
.	c

That	i
is	c
a	c
sport	c
that	c
I	i
always	i
want	i
to	c
practise	i
but	c
in	c
France	c
it	c
is	c
to	i
expansive	i
.	c

So	c
if	c
I	c
have	c
this	c
opportunity	c
,	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
want	c
to	c
fail	i
it	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
photograph	i
too	i
.	c

Could	c
you	c
send	c
me	c
more	c
informations	i
about	c
clothes	i
to	c
take	c
with	c
?	i

Finally	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
,	i
if	c
I	c
need	c
some	i
money	c
because	i
you	c
say	c
all	c
accomodation	i
and	c
travel	c
costs	c
are	c
paid	c
for	c
.	c

Charles	c
Dumaux	c

It	c
was	c
marvellous	c
!	c
!	c
!	c

I	c
was	c
in	i
the	i
backstage	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
could	c
speak	c
with	c
the	c
singer	c
before	c
the	c
concert	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
to	c
serve	c
glasses	c
of	c
water	c
to	c
the	c
group	c
before	c
and	c
during	c
the	c
concert	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
contact	c
with	c
them	c
.	c

What	c
I	c
particularly	c
liked	c
about	c
this	c
experience	c
is	c
that	c
I	c
saw	c
that	c
famous	c
people	c
are	c
like	c
us	c
and	c
have	c
the	c
same	c
interest	i
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
this	c
experience	c
is	c
something	c
that	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
live	c
too	c
.	c

Perhaps	c
in	i
the	c
next	c
concert	c
we	c
will	c
go	c
together	c
.	c

See	c
you	c
later	c
.	c

I	c

about	i

Do	c

Alak	c
Liyana	c

Dear	c
,	i
Kim	c
,	c

I	c
have	c
n't	c
written	c
to	c
you	c
since	i
last	i
two	c
months	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
very	c
busy	c
to	i
helped	i
and	c
organizing	c
the	c
pop	c
concert	c
which	c
took	c
place	c
near	c
my	c
town	c
.	c

Let	c
me	c
tell	c
you	c
more	c
about	c
what	c
I	c
have	i
done	i
last	c
month	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
helped	c
them	c
to	c
prepared	i
the	c
clothes	c
and	c
the	c
custom	i
during	c
the	c
concert	c
,	i
although	i
I	c
never	i
experience	i
about	i
clothes	c
and	c
art	c
before	c
,	c
but	i
I	c
enjoyed	c
it	c
very	c
much	c
.	c

What	c
I	c
liked	c
most	c
about	c
my	c
experienced	i
from	i
the	c
concert	c
was	c
a	i
great	c
atmosphere	c
behind	c
the	c
state	i
and	c
live	i
music	c
made	i
me	c
felt	i
great	c
and	c
happy	c
,	i
what	i
's	i
more	c
,	c
I	c
have	i
opportunity	i
to	c
meet	c
a	c
singer	c
who	c
I	c
loved	i
and	c
I	c
dream	c
about	c
.	c

He	c
also	c
gave	c
me	c
his	c
adress	i
and	c
telephone	c
number	c
if	c
I	c
need	c
help	c
from	c
him	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
.	c

I	c
'll	c
show	c
you	c
when	c
you	c
come	c
around	c
to	c
see	c
me	c
.	c

Anyway	c
,	c
I	c
'd	c
better	c
go	c
now	c
.	c

Best	c
wishes	c
,	c

I	c
saw	c
your	c
advertisement	c
yesterday	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
visited	c
the	c
circle	i
theatre	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
I	c
am	c
not	c
satisfied	c
of	i
it	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
there	c
were	c
any	i
different	c
actor	i
.	c

I	c
was	c
disappointed	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
it	c
is	i
said	c
the	c
show	c
starts	i
at	c
19.30	c
but	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
twenty	c
pounds	c
are	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
money	c
for	c
such	c
a	c
organization	i
,	i
on	i
the	i
other	i
hand	i
it	c
is	i
said	c
that	c
discount	i
is	i
available	c
.	c

It	c
is	i
false	i
,	i
I	c
have	i
paid	i
twenty	c
pounds	c
.	c

But	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
there	c
were	i
not	c
anything	c
to	c
drink	c
or	c
to	c
eat	c
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
I	c
really	c
did	c
not	c
like	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

For	c
instance	c
,	c
TV-set	i
,	c
stereo	c
,	c
microwave	c
oven	c
and	c
others	c
.	c

Another	c
point	c
is	c
that	c
with	c
the	c
help	c
of	c
the	i
technology	c
we	c
can	c
communicate	c
with	c
the	c
whole	c
world	c
.	c

Without	c
doubt	c
,	c
discovering	i
of	c
the	c
computer	c
is	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
technological	c
event	c
.	c

Almost	c
everything	c
is	c
connected	i
to	i
the	i
computers	c
.	c

Another	c
thing	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
say	c
is	c
that	c
modern	c
technology	c
help	i
us	c
to	c
go	i
anywhere	c
rapidly	i
.	c

The	c
most	c
suitable	i
examples	i
are	c
the	i
planes	c
.	c

We	c
research	i
our	c
plant	i
,	c
other	c
planets	c
and	c
many	c
other	c
things	c
with	c
the	i
help	i
of	i
it	i
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
no	c
one	c
can	c
do	c
without	c
modern	c
technology	c
.	c

It	c
go	i
on	i
to	c
develop	c
and	c
always	c
will	c
be	c
the	c
most	c
importand	i
think	i
in	c
our	c
life	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
this	c
letter	c
to	c
want	i
you	c
to	i
know	i
that	i
what	c
I	c
think	c
about	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
which	c
you	c
(	c
The	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
)	c
present	i
.	c

Because	c
we	i
were	i
7	i
people	i
.	c

When	c
I	c
asked	c
something	i
about	i
"	i
discount	i
"	i
,	i
your	i
staf	i
said	i
that	i
it	i
is	i
impossible	i
.	c

Becouse	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
see	c
this	c
show	c
.	c

Becouse	c
my	c
favorite	i
actor	c
plays	i
in	c
it	c
.	c

We	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
bulding	i
at	c
18:30	c
.	c

We	c
waited	i
to	i
start	i
the	i
show	i
about	i
one	c
hour	c
and	c
fourty-five	i
minutes	c
.	c

Becouse	c
you	c
said	i
lie	i
to	i
us	i
.	c

After	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
w	i
were	c
still	c
angry	c
,	i
we	i
wanted	c
to	c
eat	c
something	c
in	c
your	c
theater	i
restaurant	c
.	c

When	c
we	c
came	i
to	c
the	c
restaurant	c
,	c
we	c
saw	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
close	i
.	c

We	c
were	c
hungry	c
and	c
angry	c
in	i
this	c
time	c
.	c

We	c
could	c
n't	c
see	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
in	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

We	c
were	c
hungry	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

But	c
we	c
could	c
n't	c
eat	c
something	i
and	c
we	c
could	c
n't	c
use	i
discount	i
.	c

They	i
are	c
your	c
mistakes	c
.	c

When	c
you	c
do	c
something	c
,	c
I	c
went	i
to	c
see	c
your	c
new	c
shows	c

unknown	c
actor	c
who	c
was	c
n't	c
so	c
great	c
as	c
I	c
expected	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
one	c
hour	c
late	c
and	c
I	c
hate	c
waiting	c
in	c
a	c
queue	c
more	i
than	c
it	i
's	i
necessary	c
.	c

I	c
felt	c
very	c
upset	c
and	c
my	c
enjoyable	c
night	c
became	c
a	c
stressed	i
and	i
very	c
expensive	c
one	c
,	c
too	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
to	c
this	c
,	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
we	c
looked	c
for	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
which	c
has	i
been	c
closed	c
for	c
repairing	i
since	i
one	c
month	c
ago	c
.	c

Modern	c
technology	c
can	c
affect	c
our	c
daily	c
life	c
transforming	c
our	c
relationship	c
and	i
the	c
ways	c
to	i
comunicate	i
to	i
other	c
people	c
as	c
well	c
as	c
our	c
life	c
expectancy	c
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
we	c
are	c
able	c
to	c
feel	c
or	c
to	c
recognize	c
the	c
benefits	c
of	c
the	c
modern	c
technologies	c
but	c
we	c
should	c
be	c
aware	c
about	i
how	c
they	c
are	c
introduced	c
in	i
our	c
lives	c
to	c
avoid	c
the	c
dangerous	c
side	c
of	c
the	i
TECHNOLOGY	c
.	c

Dear	c
sir	i
,	c

But	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
disappointed	c
when	c
I	c
realised	c
that	c
another	c
actor	c
was	c
taking	c
part	i
.	c

And	c
the	c
worst	c
was	i
that	c
he	c
was	c
n't	c
so	c
good	c
in	c
his	i
role	c
!	c

Another	c
thing	c
was	c
that	c
the	c
show	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
was	c
starting	i
at	c
19:30	c
but	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
!	c

But	c
when	c
I	c
went	c
there	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
you	c
said	c
that	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
our	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
.	c

Well	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
and	c
I	c
ask	i
for	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

The	c
party	c
was	c
on	c
Saturday	c
at	c
Sally	c
's	c
house	c
.	c

After	c
a	c
while	c
the	i
bell	c
rang	c
.	c

They	c
danced	c
a	c
lot	c
and	c
they	c
had	c
pizza	c
for	c
dinner	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
,	c

To	c
start	c
with	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
which	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
start	c
on	c
19:30	c
started	c
on	c
20:15	c
so	c
you	c
can	c
understand	c
that	c
we	c
were	c
45	c
minutes	c
late	c
getting	c
out	c
as	c
well	c
.	c

Then	c
,	c
they	i
were	c
not	c
any	c
discounts	c
available	c
for	c
the	c
tickets	c
as	c
it	i
was	c
written	c
on	c
the	c
advertisement	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
sorry	c
but	c
this	c
was	c
n't	c
my	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
for	c
some	i
refund	c
because	c
the	c
whole	c
evening	c
was	c
very	c
disappointing	c
and	c
it	c
did	i
not	c
worth	c
the	c
money	c
given	i

As	c
we	c
can	c
understand	c
by	c
observing	c
the	c
fashion	c
of	c
each	c
century	c
,	c
the	c
style	c
of	c
dressing	c
changes	c
rootly	i
through	i
the	c
years	c
.	c

So	c
we	c
can	c
easily	c
understand	c
how	c
different	c
the	c
style	c
of	c
dressing	c
will	c
be	c
like	i
100	c
years	c
from	c
now	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
two	c
possible	c
fashions	c
for	c
the	c
future	c
.	c

If	c
humans	c
turn	i
to	c
be	c
more	c
free	c
from	c
social	c
rules	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
their	c
dressing	i
will	c
also	c
be	c
very	c
extreme	c
and	c
unlimited	c
.	c

Everybody	c
will	c
wear	c
anything	c
he/she	c
likes	c
,	c
choosing	c
clothes	c
from	c
any	c
century	c
they	c
wishe	i
without	c
this	c
being	c
strange	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
if	c
human	c
society	c
turns	i
to	c
be	i
stricher	i
and	c
more	c
limited	c
,	c
there	c
will	c
be	c
only	c
2	c
or	c
3	c
types	c
of	c
clothing	c
,	c
formed	c
by	c
the	c
needs	c
of	c
the	i
society	c
.	c

Perhaps	c
the	c
style	c
of	c
their	c
dressing	i
will	c
indicate	c
their	c
position	c
in	c
society	c
too	c
.	c

This	c
is	c
how	i
I	c
think	c
fashion	i
of	c
the	c
future	c
will	c
be	c
like	c
.	c

Then	c
when	c
the	c
show	c
finally	c
started	c
I	c
got	i
very	c
disappointed	c
because	c
,	i
I	c
really	c
wanted	c
to	c
see	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
but	c
instead	c
of	c
him	c
there	c
was	c
any	i
other	i
actor	c
.	c

Lately	i
when	c
the	c
show	c
finished	c
,	c
I	c
planed	i
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
restorant	i
and	c
get	c
some	c
food	c
,	c
but	c
I	i
was	c
close	i
,	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
being	c
repaired	c
.	c

I	c
will	i
be	c
very	c
thankfull	i
if	c
your	c
could	c
return	c
me	i
half	c
or	c
some	c
of	c
my	c
money	c
,	c
or	c
even	c
to	i
make	i
the	c
corresponding	i
discount	i
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
,	c
every	c
time	c
I	c
tell	i
something	i
to	i
her	i
,	c
finally	i
everyone	c
knew	i
about	c
it	c
.	c

Now	c
I	c
'm	c
very	c
happy	c
because	c
I	c
learned	c
that	c
friends	c
are	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
thing	c
in	c
the	c
hole	i
world	c
.	c

xxxx	c

It	c
is	c
always	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
to	c
enjoy	c
a	c
musical	c
when	c
you	c
go	c
on	c
your	i
holiday	c
to	c
London	c
.	c

London	c
is	c
one	c
of	c
Europe	c
's	c
biggest	c
centre	i
and	c
you	c
can	c
always	c
get	i
the	c
best	c
in	c
show	c
business	c
.	i

Furthermore	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
shooked	i
when	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
main	c
persons	i
entered	i
the	c
stage	c
.	c

He	c
was	c
n't	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
resons	i
for	c
my	c
choice	c
.	i

Finally	c
,	c
the	c
Theatre	c
Restaurant	c
was	c
under	i
reparation	i
so	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
find	c
another	c
one	c
for	c
the	i
evening	c
supper	i

A	c
century	c
ago	c
,	c
when	c
a	c
farmer	c
took	c
the	c
horses	c
out	c
of	c
the	c
stable	c
and	c
put	c
the	c
plouge	i
behind	c
them	c
,	c
we	i
've	i
got	i
the	c
word	c
"	c

I	c
visited	c
an	c
airport	c
some	c
days	c
ago	c
and	c
in	c
nearly	c
every	c
crowded	c
corner	c
,	i
I	c
could	c
see	c
those	c
busy	c
people	c
always	i
on	c
their	c
way	c

I	c
can	c
send	c
and	c
save	c
information	c
and	c
the	c
possibilities	c
are	c
uncountless	i

In	c
nearly	c
every	c

you	c
can	c
find	c

and	c
the	c
users	c
now	c
and	c
in	c
the	c

are	c

I	c
must	c
say	c
a	c
few	c
words	c
about	c
the	c
new	c
electrical	c

which	c
surely	c
will	c
have	c
a	c
central	c
role	c

today	c

appropriate	i
and	c
helpful	c
for	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
differences	c
between	c
what	c
the	c
advertisement	c
of	i
The	i
Circle	c
theater	i
said	c
about	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
called	c
'	c
Over	c
The	c
Rainbow	c
'	c
and	c
the	c
things	c
I	c
noticed	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
there	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
the	c
most	c
annoying	c
thing	c
for	c
me	c
was	c
the	c
absence	c
of	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
because	c
in	c
my	c
country	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
the	c
chance	c
to	c
enjoy	c
his	c
excellent	c
performance	i
.	c

Another	c
actor	c
standed	i
for	i
him	c
,	c
without	c
any	c
advice	i
.	c

But	c
for	i
our	c
surprise	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
out	i
of	i
order	i
.	c

Owing	c
to	c
the	c
great	c
speed	c
of	c
technological	c
development	c
,	c
people	c
need	c
to	c
lead	c
a	c
faster	c
life	c
.	c

When	c
this	c
technological	c
aspect	i
changes	c
so	c
quickly	c
,	c
I	c
obviously	c
feel	c
that	c
my	c
life	c
changes	c
too	c
in	c
many	c
fields	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
say	c
that	c
the	c
worst	c
thing	c
of	i
this	c
development	c
for	c
me	c
is	c
that	c
more	i
and	i
more	i
I	i
experience	i
stress	c
in	c
almost	c
every	c
aspect	c
of	c
my	c
life	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
to	c
this	c
,	c
there	c
is	c
less	c
comunication	i
between	c
members	c
of	c
my	c
family	c
,	c
because	c
when	c
we	c
arrive	c
at	i
home	c
after	c
an	c
exhausted	i
day	c
racing	c
with	i
the	i
time	c
,	c
the	c
only	c
thing	c
we	c
want	c
to	c
do	c
is	c
lying	i
in	i
the	c
sofa	c
while	c
watching	c
television	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
and	i
as	i
a	i
conclusion	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
this	c
development	c
has	c
made	c
my	c
life	c
more	c
comfortable	c
living	i
sourrended	i
by	i
lots	i
of	i
gadgets	i
with	i
differents	i
functions	i

Dear	c

In	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

I	c
believe	c
that	c
famous	c
people	c
,	c
such	c
as	c
politicians	c
and	c
film	c
stars	c
,	c
deserve	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
private	c
life	c
without	c
journalists	c
following	c
them	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
for	c
some	c
reasons	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
they	c
are	c
the	c
same	c
as	c
ordinary	c
people	c
even	c
if	c
they	c
are	c
treated	c
as	c
celebrity	i
.	c

Some	c
people	c
might	c
say	c
that	c
we	c
all	c
have	c
the	c
right	c
to	c
know	c
everything	c
happening	c
in	c
the	c
world	c
as	c
one	c
of	c
the	i
human	c
rights	c
.	c

Therefore	c
,	c
I	c
strongly	c
believe	c
that	c
famous	c
people	c
deserve	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
private	c
life	c
without	c
journalists	c
following	c
them	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
,	c

To	c
begin	c
with	c
,	c
the	c
actor	c
the	c
advertisement	c
showed	c
did	c
not	c
come	i
,	c
which	c
I	c
found	c
it	i
in	i
very	i
bad	i
taste	i
,	c
disappointing	i
.	c

I	c
paid	c
twenty	c
pounds	c
for	c
my	c
ticket	c
because	c
,	c
as	c
you	c
may	c
know	c
,	c
there	c
were	c
not	c
discounts	i
available	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
its	c
owner	c
had	c
decided	c
to	c
go	c
on	c
holiday	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
nobody	c
told	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
you	c
would	i
have	i
to	i
take	i
it	i
into	i
consideration	i
to	c
avoid	c
it	c
happens	i
again	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

I	c
explained	i
her	c
everything	c
it	i
happened	c
to	c
me	c
and	c
vice	c
versa	c
.	c

We	c
had	c
many	c
points	i
in	c
common	c
and	c
we	c
knew	c
each	c
other	c
as	c
if	c
we	c
were	c
sisters	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
one	c
day	c
our	c
friendship	c
was	c
broken	c
down	i
.	c

In	c
your	c
letter	c
you	c
asked	c
me	c
when	c
I	c
would	c
rather	i
travel	i
,	i
I	c
will	c
be	c
able	c
only	i
on	i
July	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
work	c
and	c
I	c
can	c
take	c
some	c
days	c
off	c
on	i
this	i
month	c
.	c

About	c
the	c
I	i
have	c
to	c
choose	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
something	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
tennis	c
and	c
photography	c
but	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
practice	i
new	c
ones	c
,	c
if	c
it	c
is	c
possible	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
if	c
there	c
is	c
any	c
place	c
where	c
I	c
can	c
buy	c
some	c
souvenirs	c
,	c
so	i
to	i
take	c
some	c
money	c
with	c
me	c
and	i
I	c
would	c
be	c
very	c
grateful	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
send	c
me	c
a	c
list	c
of	c
clothes	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
travelling	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
like	i
if	c
they	c
lose	c
their	c
concience	i
while	c
they	c
are	c
shopping	c
.	c

You	c
can	c
do	i
shopping	c
alone	c
,	c
with	c
friends	c
or	c
with	c
your	c
kids	c
,	c
but	c
the	c
best	c
thing	c
of	i
it	c
is	c
that	c
you	c
feel	c
that	c
you	c
have	c
all	i
the	i
power	i
while	c
you	c
are	c
buying	c
things	c
.	c

But	c
my	c
advise	i
for	c
people	c
,	i
who	c
like	c
it	c
so	c
much	c
that	c
can	i
not	i
help	c
doing	c
it	c
,	i
is	c
to	c
try	c
shopping	c
in	c
the	c
afternoon	c
,	i
at	i
this	c
hour	i
no-one	c
do	i
shopping	c
and	c
if	c
there	c
are	c
some	c
shops	c
that	c
are	c
closed	c
you	c
can	c
always	c
go	c
to	c
a	c
shopping	c
mall	c
.	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

Is	c
it	c
possible	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
?	c

And	c
also	c
I	c
like	c
to	c
camp	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
,	c
because	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
more	c
interesting	c
than	c
log	c
cabins	c
.	c

You	c
need	c
to	c
do	c
everything	c
by	c
yourself	c
.	c

Taking	c
a	i
photography	i
during	c
the	c
holiday	c
is	c
very	i
good	c
memory	c
for	c
me	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
can	c
share	c
my	c
adventures	c
to	i
my	c
friends	c
.	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c

Shopping	c
sounds	c
very	c
enjobleable	i
and	c
fantastic	i
for	c
women	c
.	c

Some	c
people	c
enjoy	c
window	c
shopping	c
,	c
but	c
some	c
people	c
enjoy	c
spending	c
their	c
money	c
on	c
their	i
clothes	c
or	c
shoes	c
.	c

Nowadays	c
in	i
a	c
family	c
shopping	i
is	c
n't	c
women	i
's	i
job	c
.	c

In	i
other	i
hand	i
,	c
after	c
shopping	c
you	c
'll	c
get	c
tired	c
and	c
maybe	c
you	c
ca	c
n't	c
afford	c
your	c
credit	c
card	c
.	c

For	c
instance	c
,	c
you	c
want	i
to	c
buy	c
everything	c
which	c
you	c
saw	c
,	c
and	c
after	c
that	c
,	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
how	c
much	c
you	c
have	c
spent	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
are	c
going	c
shopping	c
someone	c
can	c
easily	c
steal	c
your	c
wallet	c
which	i
you	c
are	c
looking	c
at	c
some	c
interesting	c
things	c
.	c

I	c
enjoy	c
shopping	c
very	c
much	c
,	i
it	i
can	c
let	i
me	c
know	c
what	c
's	c
going	c
on	c
in	c
the	c
world	c
.	c

But	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
good	c
idea	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
break	c
during	c
the	c
shopping	c
,	i
you	i
wo	c
n't	c
feel	c
so	c
tired	c
.	c

Dear	c
Ms.	c
Ryan	c
,	c

The	c
main	c
reason	c
is	c
that	c
I	c
love	c
wood	c
.	c

With	i
contrast	i
to	i
this	c
,	c
I	c
can	i
swim	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
six	c
.	c

Lastly	c
,	c
could	c
you	c
please	c
tell	c
me	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
and	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
should	c
prepare	i
and	c
do	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
buy	c
insurance	c
myself	c
?	c

You	c
can	c
find	c
students	c
use	i
traditional	c
chinese	i
ink	c
to	c
draw	c
and	c
write	c
.	c

Some	c
are	c
held	c
once	c
a	c
year	c
and	c
some	c
are	c
held	c
every	c
term	c
.	c

You	c
will	c
experience	c
a	c
different	c
life	c
in	c
them	c
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
besides	c
all	c
mentioned	i
,	c
I	c
highly	c
recommond	i
you	c
video	c
students	i
'	c
daily	c
life	c
and	c
interview	c
them	c
.	c

That	c
will	c
make	i
it	i
defenitely	i
a	c
successful	c
video	c
.	c

In	i
fact	i
it	c
was	c
quite	c
different	c
from	c
the	c
one	c
I	c
had	c
expected	c
to	c
see	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
angry	c
because	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
instead	c
of	c
19.30	c
,	c
too	c
.	c

I	c
suggest	c
you	c
should	c
solve	c
these	c
problems	c
quickly	c
.	c

Thanks	c
to	c
you	c
,	c
I	c
've	c
had	c
the	c
most	c
dreadful	c
experience	c
of	c
my	c
life	c
.	c

Write	c
back	c
soon	c

As	c
Modern	c
technology	c
is	c
changing	c
the	c
world	c
rapidly	c
I	c
think	c
we	c
are	c
all	c
involved	c
in	c
the	c
revolution	c
it	c
's	c
causing	c

New	c
technologies	c

affected	c
people	c

way	c
of	c

for	c
ages	c

by	c
offering	c
them	c
better	c
tools	c

I	i

very	c
plesant	i
joining	i
the	i
holliday	i
.	c

As	i
a	i
regard	i
for	i
activities	c
I	c
would	c
choose	c
singing	c
and	c
surfing	c
,	i
surfing	i
because	c
it	c
is	c
my	c
favourit	i
sport	c
,	i
I	c
have	c
been	c
surfing	c
since	c
I	c

a	c
child	c
so	c
I	c
am	c
pretty	c
good	c
on	i
it	c
,	i
and	i
singing	c
because	c
I	c
really	c
love	c

,	i
I	c
am	c
not	c
as	c
good	c
on	i
singing	c
as	c
I	c

surfing	c
but	c
I	c
like	c

it	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hear	i
from	c
you	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Dear	c
Kin	c
,	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
breeze	c
to	c
help	c
them	c
and	c
was	c
very	c
cool	c
as	c
well	c
,	i
those	c
guys	c
really	c
know	c
how	c
to	c
play	c
rock	c
.	c

I	c
had	i
only	i
to	c
stay	c
behind	c
the	c
drummer	c
suppling	i
them	c
with	c
water	c
whenever	c
they	c
wanted	c
.	c

Afterwards	c
,	c
the	c
Ramones	c
had	c
a	c
short	c
break	c
and	c
when	c
they	c
went	i
back	c
from	c
their	c
break	c
they	i
've	i
just	i
went	i
of	i
.	i

I	c
had	c
a	c
really	c
nice	c
time	c
with	c
them	c
even	c
tought	i
I	c
would	c
've	c
prefered	i
to	c
stay	c
at	c
the	c
front	c
with	c
the	c
others	i
people	c
,	c
but	c
anyway	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
great	c
experience	c
for	c
me	c
,	c
I	c
holp	i
to	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
help	c
them	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
would	c
rather	c
be	c
accommodated	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
because	c
I	c
already	c
have	c
the	c
necessary	c
material	i
for	c
camping	c
.	c

While	c
I	c
am	c
at	c
the	c
Camp	i
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
play	c
tennis	c
and	c
do	c
photography	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
a	c
few	c
questions	c
:	c

What	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
should	c
I	c
bring	c
?	c

Will	c
you	c
give	i
clothes	c
for	c
activities	i
?	c

How	c
much	c
money	c
should	c
I	c
bring	c
there	c
?	c

Although	c
many	c
people	c
enjoy	c
shopping	c
,	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

Sometimes	c
the	c
seller	i
might	c
even	c
ignore	c
you	c
as	c
he	c
or	c
she	c
is	c
talking	c
to	c
another	c
sellor	i
.	c

Then	c
,	c
one	c
of	c
them	c
serves	c
you	c
but	c
half	c
listens	c
to	c
you	c
because	c
he	c
or	c
she	c
is	c
still	c
talking	c
to	c
the	c
other	c
sellor	i
.	c

There	c
is	c
nothing	c
more	c
disagreable	i
than	c
that	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
,	c

Further	c
to	c
the	c
umpleasent	i
fact	i
that	c
took	c
place	c
last	c
week	c
I	i
am	i
in	i
my	c
right	c
of	i
complaining	i
about	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
I	c
saw	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

It	c
had	i
not	i
been	c
such	c
a	c
terrible	c
thing	c
if	c
the	c
new	c
actor	c
would	i
have	i
acted	c
as	c
well	c
as	c
the	c
other	c
one	c
.	c

After	c
explaining	i
you	i
my	i
complains	i
I	c
hope	c
you	c
to	i
send	c
me	c
some	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
our	c
last	c
school	c
year	c
,	c
so	c
we	c
decided	c
to	c
organize	c
a	c
trip	c
to	c
celebrate	c
we	i
had	c
finally	c
finished	c
it	i
.	c

We	c
knew	c
that	c
our	c
parents	c
would	c
n't	c
let	c
us	c
to	i
travel	i
alone	c
so	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
invent	c
a	c
story	c
to	c
avoid	c
they	i
could	i
realize	i
what	c
happened	i
.	c

Kim	c
,	c
Kate	c
and	c
Pat	c
told	c
their	c
parents	c
they	c
were	c
going	c
to	c
travel	c
with	c
the	c
school	c
and	c
so	c
,	i
did	c
I.	c
We	c
were	c
excited	c
and	c
we	c
started	c
to	c
organized	i
everything	c
.	c

We	c
booked	c
some	c
rooms	c
in	c
a	c
hotel	c
,	c
next	c
to	c
the	c
beach	c
and	i
we	c
bought	c
all	c
the	c
useful	c
things	c
we	c
were	c
going	c
to	c
need	c
.	c

It	c
seemed	c
the	i
perfect	c
holiday	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
.	c

Pat	c
told	c
him	c
our	c
idea	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
choosing	c
me	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
for	c
first	c
prize	c
.	c

I	c
feel	c
very	c
happy	c
a	i
I	c
answer	i
immidiatly	i
to	i
your	i
letter	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
good	c
in	i
swimming	c
.	c

I	c
do	i
this	c
sport	c
since	c
I	c
was	c
child	i
and	c
I	c
really	c
enjoy	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
not	c
so	c
good	c
in	i
tennis	c
but	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
play	c
it	c
for	i
practise	i
.	c

It	i
is	i
all	i
about	i
me	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
something	c
.	c

I	c
never	i
liked	i
shopping	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
like	c
to	c
have	c
many	c
things	c
in	c
my	c
house	c
,	i
I	c
do	c
n't	c
like	c
to	c
have	c
many	c
clothes	c
and	c
shoes	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
what	c
else	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
the	c
people	c
who	c
are	i
enjoying	i
shopping	c
they	i
are	c
greede	i
for	c
materialistic	c
things	c
and	c
they	c
hav	i
n't	i
interests	i
for	i
spirit	i
(	c
?	c
)	c
,	c
intelect	i
life	c
.	c

They	c
are	c
loosing	i
time	c
of	i
their	c
life	c
for	c
nothing	c
.	c

We	c
must	c
do	c
something	c
for	i
help	i
other	c
people	c
to	c
feel	c
better	c
and	c
usefull	i
.	c

Dear	c
Madam	i
Ryan	c
,	c

It	c
is	c
a	c
wonderful	c
surprise	c

I	c
would	c
try	c
to	c
do	c
some	c
painting	c
,	c
too	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
have	c
never	c

Could	c

sort	c
of	c
material	i
I	c
will	c
have	c
to	c
bring	c

Do	c
you	c

last	i
week	c
I	c
have	i
been	i
to	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
to	c

my	c
uncle	c
,	c
who	c
is	c
the	c
director	c
of	c
the	c
stadium	c
of	c
Lugano	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
very	c
interresting	i
,	c
because	c
I	c
did	c
different	c
things	c
.	c

The	c
best	c
part	c
of	c
the	c
day	c
was	c
after	c
the	c
concert	c
,	c
when	c
I	c
met	c
the	c
group	c
"	c
U2	c
"	c

talk	i
with	c
Santana	c
,	c
the	c
best	c

the	c
world	c

I	c

What	c
a	c
great	c
day	c
it	c
was	c
.	c

The	c

Otherwise	c
I	c
will	c

to	c
travel	c
abroad	c

I	c
came	c
second	c
last	i
year	c
's	c
swimming	c
competition	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
enrolled	c
photography	i
classes	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
wondering	c
if	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
bring	c
some	c
extra	c
money	c
and	c
thick	c
clothes	c
with	c
me	c
in	c
case	c
there	c
is	c
an	c
emergency	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
terribly	c
sorry	c
not	c
to	c
drop	c
you	c
a	c
line	c
since	c
the	c
last	c
time	c
we	c
wrote	c
to	c
one	c
another	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
finally	i
got	i
around	c
writing	i
and	c
you	c
'll	c
see	c
that	c
it	i
's	i
definetly	i
worth	c
waiting	c
as	i
I	c
have	c
some	c
great	c
and	c
unbeliavable	i
news	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
.	c

However	c
this	i
term	c
has	c
been	c
a	c
far	c
cry	c
from	c
the	c
others	c
.	c

Couple	i
of	c
days	c
ago	c
I	c
bumped	c
into	c
my	c
best	c
friend	c
who	i
is	c
into	c
music	c
and	i
we	c
started	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
chat	c
about	c
what	c
we	c
had	c
both	c
been	c
doing	c
.	c

She	c
invited	c
me	c
to	c
the	c
rehearsal	c
of	c
a	c
huge	c
consert	i
whose	i
singer	c
was	i
a	c
well-known	c
pop	c
star	c
as	c
well	c
as	c
my	c
favorite	i
.	c

Can	c
you	c
believe	c
that	c
I	c
was	c
introduced	c
to	c
him	c
and	c
I	c
took	c
numerous	c
photographs	c
some	i
of	c
which	c
I	c
put	c
in	c
the	c
envelope	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
like	c
a	c
dream	c
come	c
true	c
,	c
and	c
was	c
the	c
best	c
part	c
of	c
the	c
experience	c
in	c
my	c
opinion	c
.	c

I	c
helped	c
out	c
my	c
friend	c
by	c
writing	c
huge	c
billboards	c
and	c
making	c
some	c
light	c
refreshments	c
.	c

Dear	c
director	c
of	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theater	i
!	c

Last	c
week	c
I	c
was	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

On	c
Friday	c
we	c
,	c
my	c
friend	c
and	c
I	c
visited	i
your	c
Theater	i
to	c
see	c
'	c
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
'	c
.	c

The	c
first	c
thing	c
that	c
happen	i
was	c
that	c
the	c
show	c
did	c
n't	c
start	c
on	c
time	c
.	c

Instead	c
of	c
730	i
am	c
as	c
your	c
advertisment	i
said	c
,	c
it	c
started	c
815	i
am	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
meantime	c
we	c
tried	c
to	c
get	c
our	c
money	c
back	c
to	c
do	c
something	c
else	c
,	c
but	c
that	c
was	c
impossible	c
.	c

We	c
are	c
both	c
big	c
faan	i
of	c
him	i

When	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
finished	c
we	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
resturant	i
to	c
have	c
something	c
to	c
eat	c
.	c

But	c
then	c
it	c
was	c
cloesed	i
because	i
of	i
reparations	i
.	c

Due	i
to	i
all	c
this	c
troubel	i
I	c
think	c
we	c
should	c
have	c
our	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

And	c
to	i
an	i
other	i
time	i
,	c
make	c
soure	i
that	c
your	c
advertisment	i
is	c
correkt	i
!	c

When	c
were	c
nine	c
years	c
old	c
and	c
were	c
in	c
thired	i
grade	c
we	c
had	c
a	c
'	c
House	c
'	c
where	c
we	c
used	c
to	c
play	c
all	c
afternones	i
.	c

But	c
we	c
used	c
to	c
call	c
it	c
'	c
Our	c
House	c
'	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
the	c
cast	c
,	c
which	c
you	c
"	c
offered	i
"	c
has	i
been	c
changed	c
.	c

The	c
man	c
who	c
played	c
the	c
main	c
male	c
role	c
was	c
different	i
than	i
this	i
one	i
,	i
who	c
was	c
mentioned	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
.	c

In	c
your	c
offer	i
I	c
noticed	c
an	i
information	c
about	c
discounts	c
which	c
were	c
supposed	c
to	c
be	c
available	c
-	c
no	c
,	c
they	c
were	c
not	c
!	c

Another	c
"	c
defect	c
"	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
was	c
an	c
"	c
invitation	c
"	c
to	c
the	c
restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
disappointed	c
about	c
the	c
musical	c
in	c
your	c
theatre	c
.	c

Neither	c
beautiful	i
surranding	i
near	c
your	c
theatre	c
nor	c
comfortable	i
sits	i
will	i
not	i
recompansate	i
my	i
horrible	c
evening	c
.	c

Therefore	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
you	c
to	c
send	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
think	c
I	c
deserve	c
it	c
as	c
a	c
viewer	i
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Technology	c
is	c
very	c
important	c
in	c
our	c
life	c
.	c

Mainly	c
,	c
because	c
it	c
makes	c
it	c
easier	c
and	c
more	c
comfortable	c
.	c

I	c
meet	c
her	i
"	c
at	c
every	c
corner	c
"	c
:	c
at	c
home	c
,	c
at	c
school	c
,	c
in	c
the	c
backyard	c
and	c
so	c
on	c
.	c

Every	c
morning	c
I	c
use	c
a	c
toaster	c
to	c
have	c
my	c
sandwiches	c
done	c
,	c
washing	i
machine	c
which	c
makes	c
my	c
clothes	c
clean	c
again	c
.	c

Recently	i
,	c
modern	c
technology	c
means	c
:	c
mobile	c
phones	c
,	c
computers	c
,	c
internet	i
,	c
super-fast	c
cars	c
etc.	c
These	c
improvements	c
helps	i
me	c
with	c
my	c
ordinary	c
dutes	i
.	c

However	c
,	c
technology	c
has	c
a	c
bad	c
influence	c
on	c
us	c
,	i
generally	c
on	c
our	c
healf	i
.	c

Also	c
fast	c
and	c
well-improved	i
car	i
increase	c
a	i
risk	i
of	c
pollution	c
of	i
our	c
air	c
and	c
mainly	c
lead	c
to	c
very	c
dangerous	c
accidents	c
.	c

Then	c
we	c
will	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
technology	c
is	c
something	c
we	c
should	c
be	c
proud	c
of	c
.	c

Now	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
to	c
ask	c
some	i
details	c
about	c
these	c
two	c
weeks	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
and	c
giving	i
some	i
answers	c
to	c
your	c
questions	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
if	c
you	c
have	c
some	c
vacancies	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
the	c
only	c
month	c
where	c
I	c
am	c
in	i
holidays	i
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
interesting	i
in	c
photography	c
because	c
my	c
father	c
is	c
a	c
photographer	c
and	c
we	c
are	c
used	c
to	c
spending	c
time	c
each	i
other	i
.	c

We	c
had	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
fun	c
during	c
our	c
last	c
holidays	i
and	c
we	c
took	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
pictures	c
.	c

As	c
the	i
instructions	c
about	c
clothes	c
and	c
money	c
were	c
not	c
enclosed	i
in	c
your	c
letter	c
,	c
I	i
request	i
about	i
it	i
and	i
ask	i
you	i
to	i
include	i
in	i
it	i
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
,	i
I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

And	c
nowadays	c
people	c
must	c
do	i
shopping	c
either	i
they	c
like	c
it	c
or	c
not	c
.	c

If	c
these	c
people	c
have	c
a	i
family	i
with	i
children	c
,	c
they	c
must	c
buy	c
some	c
food	c
to	c
feed	c
them	c
even	c
if	c
a	i
supermarket	c
is	c
full	c
of	c
people	c
.	c

And	c
now	c
for	c
them	c
shopping	c
can	c
be	c
considerated	i
like	i
a	i
contrariety	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
with	c
regard	c
to	c
your	c
advertisment	i
.	c

During	c
my	c
2	c
week	i
's	i
holiday	c
I	c
would	i
like	i
to	c
attend	c
a	c
musical	c
show	c
.	c

secondly	i
there	c
was	c
delay	i
which	c
got	c
me	c
into	c
trouble	c
,	i
After	c
the	c
show	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
catch	c
my	c
train	c
.	c

Because	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
have	c
any	c
plan	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
have	c
a	i
lunch	c
in	c
theatre	i
restaurant	c
.	c

The	c
worst	c
thing	c
is	c
that	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
watch	i
my	c
favorite	i
actor	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
n't	c
consentrate	i
on	c
the	c
play	c
any	c
more	c
.	c

Contrary	i
to	i
the	c
advertisment	i
everything	c
was	c
disapointing	i
.	c

I	c
regret	c
to	i
demand	c
all	c
my	c
expenses	i
.	i

Azami	c

On	c
the	c
one	c
hand	c
technology	c
has	c
made	c
our	c
lives	c
more	c
comfortable	c
and	c
easier	c
.	c

Nowadays	c
students	c
have	c
much	i
more	c
facilitis	i
in	c
education	c
than	c
before	c
.	c

These	c
days	c
we	c
can	c
use	c
computer	i
,	c
television	c
and	c
some	c
sophisticated	c
equipment	c
.	i

which	c
were	c
unusuall	i
before	i
.	c

We	c
can	c
get	c
some	i
information	c
more	c
quickly	c
.	c

Technology	c
has	c
a	c
huge	c
effect	c
on	c
our	c
spare	i
time	i
activities	c
as	c
well	c
.	c

Children	c
play	c
wit	i
computer	i
instead	c
of	c
usuall	i
plays	i
.	c

Despite	c
the	c
huge	c
facilities	i
technology	i
has	c
affected	c
our	c
lives	c
negatively	c
.	c

There	c
has	c
been	c
change	i
relatinships	i
between	c
people	c
.	c

People	c
are	c
getting	c
more	c
and	c
more	c
lonely	c
.	c

While	c
we	c
are	c
using	c
technology	c
,	c
we	c
should	c
take	c
into	c
consideration	c
environment	i
.	c

We	c
should	c
n't	c
allow	c
to	i
be	i
exploited	i
the	i
world	i
.	c

If	c
we	c
want	c
to	c
leave	c
a	c
good	c
world	c
to	c
the	c
next	c
generations	c
,	c
we	c
should	c
behave	c
more	c
respectfully	c
againgst	i
the	i
nature	c
.	c

We	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
organising	c
our	c
programme	c
.	c

The	c
programme	c
you	c
suggest	c
is	c
versatile	c
and	c
full	c
of	c
interesting	c
activities	c
.	c

We	c
are	c
eager	c
to	c
attend	c
National	i
Art	c
Gallery	c
and	c
Science	c
Museum	c
.	c

But	c
we	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
make	c
our	i
suggestion	c
,	c
if	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
mind	c
.	c

And	c
apart	c
from	c
it	i
,	c
this	c
activity	i
is	c
free	c
of	c
charge	c
.	c

Faithfully	i
yours	c
,	c

It	c
is	c
quite	c
obvious	c
,	i
that	c
celebreties	i
ca	c
n't	c
lead	c
a	c
normal	c
life	c
,	c
as	c
they	c
are	c
constantly	c
followed	c
by	c
reporters	c
,	c
what	i
makes	c
their	c
life	c
miserable	c
.	c

The	c
first	c
point	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
make	c
is	c
that	c
a	i
private	c
life	c
of	c
a	c
celebrity	c
is	c
open	c
to	c
public	i
.	c

It	c
is	c
common	c
knowledge	c
,	i
that	c
such	c
an	i
attention	c
inevitably	c
tells	c
on	c
relationships	c
in	c
the	c
family	c
.	c

Another	c
aspect	c
is	c
that	c
children	i
of	c
famous	c
people	c
suffer	c
a	c
lot	c
from	c
this	c
attention	c
.	c

They	c
ca	c
n't	c
communicate	c
with	c
ordinary	c
children	c
and	i
attend	c
ordinary	c
schools	c
.	c

And	c
last	c
,	c
but	c
not	c
least	c
is	i
the	c
fact	c
that	c
famous	c
people	c
ca	c
n't	c
express	c
their	c
emotions	c
,	c
show	i
their	c
real	c
feelings	c
to	c
public	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
stress	c
that	c
very	c
often	c
famous	c
people	c
become	c
reserved	c
,	c
bad-tempered	c
and	c
angry	c
with	c
the	c
world	c
for	c
interfering	c
into	i
their	c
lives	c
.	c

The	c
show	c
was	c
called	c
'	c
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	i
'	c
I	i
was	c
not	c
pleased	c
with	c
the	c
way	c
that	c
was	i
set	i
out	i
.	c

Nowaday	i
,	c
people	c
look	c
at	c
fashion-magesins	i
or	c
get	c
opinions	c
from	c
their	c
friends	c
to	i
decide	c
what	c
to	c
wear	c
in	i
different	c
occasions	c

Will	c
they	c
still	c
do	c
the	c
same	c
100	c
years	c
later	i
?	c

In	i
my	i
opinion	i
,	i
I	i
think	i
clothes	c
will	c
be	c
a	c
lot	c
differente	i
100	i
years	i
later	i
compare	i
to	i
now	i
.	c

and	i
people	c
nowadays	c
still	c
use	c
jeans	i
as	i
a	i
common	i
material	i
.	c

From	i
my	i
point	i
of	i
view	i
,	c
I	c
think	c
people	c
will	c
wear	c
more	c
clothes	c
that	c
are	c
see-through	c
in	c
particular	c
.	c

As	c
people	c
are	c
wearing	c
thinner	c
and	c
thinner	c
clothings	i
to	c
show	c
off	c
their	c
figure	c
They	i
might	c
as	c
well	c
just	c
wear	c
clothes	c
that	c
are	c
see	i
through	i
to	i
give	i
it	i
a	i
better	i
effect	i
!	c
so	i
if	c
you	c
want	c
to	c
know	c
what	c
clothes	c
will	c
be	c
like	c
100	c
year	i
later	i
,	c
the	c
only	c
thing	c
you	c
can	c
do	c
is	c
to	c
WAIT	c
!	c

For	c
the	c
activities	c
,	c
I	c
chose	c
climbing	c
because	c
I	c
took	c
cours	i
during	i
2	c
weeks	c
last	c
year	c
and	c
now	c
I	c
have	c
a	c
good	c
level	c
,	i
for	i
the	c
other	c
one	c
I	c
chose	c
photography	c
but	c
I	c
am	c
not	c
a	c
proffesional	i
,	c
I	c
just	c
take	c
some	c
pictures	c
in	i
my	c
holiday	c
!	c

I	c
have	c
a	c
little	c
question	c
,	i
could	i
you	c
tell	c
me	c
if	i
and	i
how	c
money	i
I	c
need	c
to	c
take	c
with	c
me	c
,	c
and	c
which	i
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
?	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
this	c
letter	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
my	i
good	c
experience	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
,	c
last	c
month	c
.	c

My	c
second	c
was	i
to	c
take	c
the	c
money	c
at	i
the	c
bars	c
and	c
to	c
bring	i
them	i
in	i
a	c
little	c
room	c
where	c
I	c
could	c
see	c
the	c
pop	i
star	i
walked	i
in	c
the	c
corridor	c
.	c

Best	c
wishes	c

Dear	c
Mrs.	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
about	c
the	c
competition	c
you	c
organised	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
just	c
received	c
a	c
letter	c
from	c
you	c
where	c
you	c
say	c
I	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
you	c
competition	c
.	c

Before	c
and	c
after	c
this	c
period	c
is	c
impossible	c
for	c
me	c
:	c
I	c
have	c
classes	c
and	c
I	c
also	c
have	c
to	c
work	c
.	c

About	c
the	c
accommodation	c
,	c
I	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
tents	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
this	c
way	c
is	c
better	c
to	c
keep	c
in	c
touch	c
with	c
the	i
nature	c
.	c

I	c
love	c
to	c
take	c
photos	c
but	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
techinique	i
.	c

I	c
have	c
always	c
swam	i
and	c
I	c
can	c
say	c
I	c
'm	c
good	c
on	i
it	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
will	c
need	c
to	c
take	c
,	c
if	c
it	c
's	c
cold	c
out	c
there	c
and	c
about	c
the	c
money	c
.	c

Do	c
you	c
have	c
any	c
idea	c
about	c
how	c
much	c
we	c
spend	c
per	c
day	c
?	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c

Is	i
a	c
kind	c
of	c
relief	c
for	c
them	c
.	c

Specially	i
if	c
we	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
to	c
worry	c
about	c
money	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
good	c
to	c
walk	c
around	c
looking	c
all	i
the	c
news	i
in	c
the	c
stores	c
.	c

It	c
can	c
stress	c
you	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
when	c
the	c
place	c
is	c
crowded	c
and	c
noisy	c
and	c
you	c
ca	c
n't	c
even	c
move	c
easily	c
to	c
look	c
around	c
.	c

When	c
you	c
buy	c
something	c
you	c
were	c
looking	c
for	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
and	c
,	c
when	c
you	c
arrive	c
at	c
home	c
,	c
you	c
discover	c
some	c
deffect	i
on	c
it	c
and	c
have	c
to	c
go	c
back	c
to	c
the	c
store	c
to	c
complain	c
.	c

.	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
after	c
all	c
this	c
,	c
I	c
suggest	c
that	c
before	c
you	c
decide	c
to	c
go	c
shopping	c
to	c
feel	c
better	c
you	c
should	c
think	c
of	c
all	c
the	c
problems	c
you	c
may	c
have	c
while	c
you	c
are	c
shopping	c
or	c
the	c
big	c
headache	c
you	c
can	c
have	c
after	c
it	c
.	c

It	c
can	c
be	c
very	c
unpleasant	c
sometimes	c

Dear	c
Madam	c

First	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
only	i
July	i
,	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
got	c
a	c
job	c
and	c
only	i
July	i
is	i
the	i
time	c
I	c
can	c
have	c
a	c
vacation	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
choose	c
swimming	c
and	c
photography	c
for	i
activities	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
a	i
planty	i
of	c
experience	c
and	c
knowledge	c
of	c
both	c
aspect	i
of	i
part	i
.	c

One	c
of	c
them	c
is	c
that	i
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
suitable	i
on	c
this	c
camp	c
.	c

I	c
will	i
be	c
greatfull	i
if	c
you	c
could	c
inform	c
me	c
.	c

Your	i
sincerely	i

I	c
helped	c
a	i
pop	c
concert	c
as	c
a	c
charity	i
.	c

My	c
jobs	c
were	c
collecting	c
a	i
ticket	i
,	c
saling	i
goods	c
and	c
refreshment	i
,	c
guiding	c
people	c
to	c
a	i
right	c
seat	c
and	c
cleaning	c
up	c
the	c
concert	c
hole	i
after	c
finish	i
a	i
concert	i
.	c

I	c
was	c
n't	c
allowed	c
to	c
help	c
a	i
heavy	c
work	c
,	c
even	c
though	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
do	i
,	c
because	c
I	c
'm	c
woman	i
.	c

What	c
I	c
particularly	c
liked	c
about	c
the	c
experience	c
was	c
the	c
concert	c
had	i
achived	i
by	i
our	c
supports	i
.	c

If	c
I	c
have	c
chance	i
,	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
help	c
a	i
concert	c
again	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
never	c
felt	c
such	c
as	i
satisfaction	c
.	c

I	c
really	c
recomend	i
you	c
to	c
help	c
them	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
this	c
is	c
a	c
good	c
oppotunity	i
and	c
I	c
want	c
you	c
understand	i
my	c
feeling	c
well	c
.	c

I	c
've	c
got	c
lots	c
of	c
things	c
about	c
the	c
concert	c
to	c
talk	c
to	c
you	c
.	i

I	c
want	c
to	c
know	c
your	c
openion	i

Bye	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
say	c
thank	c
you	c
to	c
you	c
Mr	i
Robertson	c
for	i
planning	c
to	c
take	i
us	i
to	i
spend	i
three	i
days	i
in	i
London	i
.	c

However	c
,	c
we	c
have	c
seen	c
an	c
advertisement	c
on	i
the	i
English	c
magazine	c
for	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
.	c

The	c
best	c
thing	c
is	c
that	c
it	c
is	c
free	c
because	c
we	c
are	c
students	c
.	c

We	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
whether	c
we	c
can	c
change	c
some	c
programme	i
.	c

Our	c
suggestion	c
is	c
that	c
we	c
can	c
go	c
shopping	c
on	c
Wednesday	c
15	c
March	c
so	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
afternoon	c
we	c
can	c
go	c
to	c
The	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
.	c

We	c
wo	c
n't	c
miss	c
any	c
programme	i
that	c
you	c
have	c
planned	c
and	c
we	c
could	c
also	c
have	c
great	i
opportunity	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

We	c
're	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

"	c
Famous	c
people	c
,	c
such	c
as	c
politicians	c
and	c
film	c
stars	c
,	c
deserve	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
private	c
life	c
without	c
journalists	c
following	c
them	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
"	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
everybody	c
wants	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
happy	c
life	c
in	c
our	c
own	i
world	c
,	i
we	i
want	c
to	c
do	c
whatever	c
we	c
want	c
,	i
sometimes	i
we	c
do	c
the	c
right	c
things	c
and	c
sometimes	c
we	c
do	c
the	c
wrong	c
things	c
.	c

We	c
are	c
ordinary	c
people	c
,	i
we	i
work	c
and	c
come	i
home	c
to	c
have	i
activities	c
with	c
our	c
family	c
or	c
go	c
out	c
together	c
.	c

The	i
politicians	i
and	c
film	c
stars	c
also	c
want	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
normal	c
life	c
after	c
work	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
their	c
story	i
always	c
make	c
them	c
embarras	i
because	c
most	c
of	c
the	c
journalists	c
create	c
their	c
own	c
story	c
base	i
on	c
the	c
true	c
story	c
just	c
to	c
get	c
attraction	i
from	i
people	i
.	c

They	c
deserve	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
private	c
life	c
as	i
everybody	c
.	i

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

This	c
is	c
nothing	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
said	c
that	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
was	c
starring	c
.	c

However	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
starred	c
and	c
we	c
were	c
all	c
disappointed	c
.	c

The	c
last	c
disappointing	c
thing	c
is	c
that	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
so	c
we	c
could	c
not	c
visit	c
it	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

As	c
well	i
as	i
you	c
can	c
understand	c
I	i
did	c
not	c
enjoy	c
myself	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
I	c
spent	c
my	c
money	c
for	i
a	c
nonsense	i
thing	c
.	c

Therefore	c
,	c
if	c
avaliable	i
,	c
can	c
you	c
play	i
my	c
money	c
back	c
please	c
?	c

My	i
address	i

very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c

Pandora	c
had	c
done	c
something	c
very	c
bad	c
like	c
a	c
robbery	c
and	c
one	c
day	c
told	c
this	c
to	c
Pat	c
because	c
she	c
was	c
very	c
shy	i
and	c
regretful	c

However	c
,	c
she	c
did	c
n't	c

that	c

One	c

there	c
and	c
talking	c
,	c
Pat	c
told	c
everyone	c
that	c
Pandora	c

She	c
became	c
very	c
shy	i
and	c
engry	i
She	i
could	c

with	c
people	c
and	c
she	c
just	i
was	i
very	c
sad	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
;	i

Yesterday	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	i
play	c
called	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
which	i
I	c
saw	c
the	c
advertisement	c
in	c
todays	i
Guardian	c
.	c

And	c
so	i
far	i
there	c
was	i
n't	i
any	c
discounts	c
available	c
which	c
is	i
written	i
to	c
be	c
"	c
available	c
"	c
in	c
the	c
advirtisement	i
.	c

You	c
should	c
have	c
written	c
it	c
in	c
the	c
advirtisement	i
.	c

And	c
after	c
all	c
no	i
one	c
can	c
say	c
that	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
!	c

Absolutely	i
it	c
was	c
very	c
dissapointing	i
.	i

Yours	c
Faithfully	i

It	c
is	c
over	c
50	c
years	c
since	c
the	c
production	i
of	c
the	c
computer	c
and	c
television	c
.	c

Our	c
lifes	i
changed	i
since	c
then	c

I	c
ca	c
n't	c
go	c
out	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
or	c
be	c
with	c
my	c
friends	c
to	c
have	c
fun	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
watch	c
Tv	i
at	c
home	c
instead	c
of	c
sitting	c
in	c
a	c
chair	c
looking	c
out	c
of	c
a	c
window	c
.	c

I	c
play	c
computer	i
more	c
than	c
watching	c
Tv	i
when	c
I	c
get	c
bored	c
.	c

The	c
internet	i
is	c
the	c
world	c
's	c
largest	c
communication	c
system	c
ever	i
made	i
.	c

I	c
can	c
do	c
anything	c
I	c
want	c
such	i
as	c
buy	c
Cd	i
's	i
watch	i
film	i
or	c
even	c
buy	c
food	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
really	c
enjable	i
when	c
I	c
chat	c
with	c
pupil	i
.	c

It	c
is	c
easy	c
and	c
very	c
useful	c
.	c

Techology	i
is	c
also	c
important	c
in	c
one	i
subject	i
for	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
ca	i
n't	i
have	c
to	c
walk	c
to	c
school	c
everyday	i
for	c
8	c
months	c
,	i
Cars	c
,	c
busses	i
and	c
trains	c
are	c
very	c
useful	c
in	c
daily	c
life	c
.	c

Lots	c
of	c
thing	i
would	c
be	c
hard	c
and	c
boring	c
in	c
my	c
life	c
I	i
was	c
living	c
in	c
a	c
different	c
time	c
than	c
now	c
.	c

Technology	c
brought	i
simple	c
solutions	c
to	c
my	c
life	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
:	c

I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
your	c
'	c
Best	i
'	c
musical	c
show	c
that	i
I	c
went	c
to	c
when	c
I	i
'd	i
a	c
week	c
's	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

I	c
felt	c
really	c
disappointed	c
because	c
the	c
things	c
you	c
said	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
was	i
n't	i
true	c
.	c

I	c
went	c
there	c
at	c
19.00	c
because	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
at	c
19.30	c
as	c
the	c
advertisement	c
said	c
but	c
I	c
queued	c
for	c
at	c
least	c
an	c
hour	c
because	c
the	c
ticket	c
machine	c
broke	c
down	c
.	c

However	c
I	i
bought	c
the	c
ticket	c
even	i
it	i
was	c
more	i
expensive	i
because	i
I	c
'd	c
been	c
queuing	c
for	c
ages	c
and	c
I	c
really	c
wanted	c
to	c
see	c
my	c
favourite	i
idol	c
,	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
.	c

But	c
when	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
,	c
they	c
said	c
Danny	c
was	c
n't	c
there	c
because	c
of	c
his	c
illness	c
and	c
I	c
felt	c
very	c
upset	c
and	c
dismayed	c
about	c
it	c
because	c
the	c
situation	i
I	c
had	c
was	c
unlike	c
what	c
the	c
advertisement	c
said	i
.	c

After	c
the	c
boring	c
show	c
finished	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
hungry	c
and	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
but	c
the	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
after	c
19.00	c
.	c

So	c
what	c
's	c
the	c
point	c
to	i
say	i
'	c
visit	c
our	c
restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
'	c
?	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

He	c
went	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
headmaster	c
and	c
told	c
him	c
all	i
the	i
truth	c
.	c

This	c
happened	c
in	i
the	i
Thursday	c
afternoon	c
.	c

But	c
some	c
naughty	c
students	c
in	c
my	c
class	c
were	c
throwing	c
paper	c
aeroplanes	c
when	c
the	c
teacher	c
was	c
writting	i
something	c
on	c
the	c
board	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
paper	c
planes	c
flew	c
out	c
of	c
the	c
window	c
and	c
hit	c
directly	i
to	i
the	c
headmaster	c
's	c
head	c
.	c

Everyone	c
was	c
laughing	c
and	c
the	c
headmaster	c
's	c
face	c
was	c
full	c
of	c
anger	c
.	c

They	c
both	c
got	c
into	c
trouble	c
because	c
of	c
him	c
.	c

They	c
do	i
hate	c
him	c
so	c
much	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
become	i
your	i
's	i
advertisment	i
concerning	c
the	c
show	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
I	c
thought	c
that	c
I	i
'll	i
have	c
a	c
great	c
evening	c
,	c
but	c
unfortunatelly	i
it	c
was	c
a	c
big	c
disappointment	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

Maybe	c
I	c
start	i
for	i
the	c
beginning	c
.	c

The	c
show	c
had	c
a	c
45	i
minutes	i
delay	c
-	c
what	c
a	c
shame	c
!	c

I	c
have	i
n't	i
seen	i
any	c
!	c

Becouse	i
the	c
show	c
was	c
very	c
long	c
,	c
we	c
were	c
getting	c
hungry	c
but	c
of	c
course	c
your	i
's	i
theatre	c
restaurants	i
was	c
closed	c
because	c
of	c
holiday	i
.	c

Hereby	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
ask	c
for	c
money	i
back	c
or	c
another	i
discounts	i
for	c
me	c

Waiting	c

The	c

begaun	i
last	c

West-Europe	i
for	c
one	c
month	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
really	i
a	i
good	c
plan	c
but	c
any	i
good	c
friends	c
.	c

I	c
become	i
quite	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
money	c
and	c
I	c
left	c
home	c
.	c

During	i
one	c
week	c
I	c
was	i
really	i
travelling	c
with	c
my	c
friends	c
but	c
then	c
I	c
was	c
getting	c
boring	c
with	c
them	c
and	c
I	c
started	c
to	c
travel	c
alone	c
.	c

Now	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
think	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
good	c
idea	c
.	c

Now	c
my	c
parents	i
'	i
do	c
n't	c
belive	i
my	c
words	i
.	c

The	c
reason	c
for	i
which	i
I	c
decided	c
to	c
write	c
you	c
a	c
letter	c
,	c
will	c
,	c
I	c
guess	c
,	c
surprise	c
you	c
.	c

How	c
rude	c
!	c

We	c
could	c
n't	c
even	c
have	c
a	c
drink	c
,	c
because	c
,	c
obviously	c
,	c
the	c
restaurant	c
you	c
talked	c
about	c
was	c
closed	c
!	c

Really	c
,	c
what	c
a	c
mess	c
in	i
the	c
administration	c
.	c

Sincerely	c
yours	c
,	c

The	c
more	c
I	c
think	c
of	c
it	c
,	c
the	c
more	c
I	c
realise	c
I	c
use	c
modern	c
technology	c
a	c
lot	c
.	c

The	c
first	c
I	i
think	c
of	c
is	c
internet	i
.	c

What	c
a	c
great	c
invention	c
!	c

It	c
allows	c
me	c
to	c
learn	c
anything	c
without	c
having	c
to	c
travel	c
through	i
many	i
libraries	c
as	c
I	c
used	c
to	c
do	c
.	c

It	c
also	c
makes	i
me	c
write	i
to	c
my	c
friends	c
by	c
e-mail	c
.	c

I	c
did	c
not	c
to	i
write	i
at	i
all	i
to	i
people	i
until	c
I	c
have	i
got	c
internet	i
.	c

By	i
this	c
procedure	c
,	c
you	c
only	c
type	c
and	c
send	c
,	c
no	c
need	c
to	c
going	i
to	c
the	c
post-office	i
!	c

Of	c
course	c
this	c
is	c
just	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
lazy	c
,	c
I	c
actually	c
could	c
force	c
me	i
a	c
little	c
,	c
and	c
then	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
library	c
and	c
to	c
the	c
post-office	i
,	c
but	c
internet	i
just	c
makes	c
it	c
easier	c
!	c

I	c
am	c
also	c
very	c
fond	c
of	c
cell-phones	c
.	c

These	c
are	c
also	c
such	i
a	c
relief	c
.	c

Modern	c
technology	c
changed	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
by	c
making	c
it	c
easier	c
and	c
by	c
turning	c
me	c
into	c
a	c
lazy	c
woman	c
.	c

Although	i
I	c
am	c
thankful	c
to	c
modern	c
technology	c
!	c

Really	c
,	c
this	i
prize	i
is	i
wonderful	i
to	i
have	i
a	i
healthy	i
life	i
.	c

I	c
hope	c
my	c
reply	c
has	c
been	c
suitable	i
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

How	c
are	c
you	c
doing	c
?	c

It	c
have	i
been	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
since	c
the	c
last	c
time	c
I	c
wrote	c
you	i
...	c

I	c
was	c
training	c
to	c
be	c
a	c
personal	c
assistance	i
to	c
Madonna	c
herself	c
.	c

My	c
first	c
job	c
was	c
in	i
the	c
Hillsborough	i
's	i
concert	c
(	c
I	c
think	c
,	i
you	c
heard	c
about	c
it	c
)	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
running	c
all	i
the	i
show	i
,	i
my	i
responsability	i
was	c
to	c
get	i
dress	c
her	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
n't	c
alone	c
,	i
I	c
worked	c
with	c
a	c
staff	c
of	c
ten	c
people	c
.	c

We	c
had	c
to	c
take	c
of	i
some	c
clothes	c
and	i
then	c
to	c
put	c
on	c
others	i
ones	i
completly	i
different	i
,	i
in	c
just	c
few	i
minutes	c
(	c
similar	c
to	c
Formula	c
One	c
)	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
exhausted	c
when	c
the	c
concert	c
finished	c
,	i
anyway	i
it	c
has	c
been	c
one	c
of	c
my	c
best	c
experience	i
and	c
I	c
'll	c
remember	c
for	i
life	i
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
send	c
you	c
all	c
my	c
positive	c
energy	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
receiving	c
your	c
letter	i
back	i
.	c

all	c
the	c
best	c
.	c

I	c
spent	c
two	c
days	c
at	c
annual	i
international	c
arts	c
festival	c
from	c
21	c
to	c
22	c
of	c
November	c
.	c

There	c
were	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
activities	c
for	c
everyone	c
.	c

I	c
relly	i
liked	c
exhibitions	i
.	c

I	c
had	c
a	c
chance	c
to	c
see	c
amazing	c
pictures	c
with	i
wezy	i
painted	c
by	c
Russian	c
painters	c
.	c

The	c
Band	i
"	c
Three	c
Kings	c
"	c
apresented	i
new	i
stily	i
of	c
music	c
.	c

I	c
relly	i
liked	c
to	i
speak	i
with	c
them	c
.	c

Nowadays	c
many	c
people	c
fond	i
of	c
classical	c
music	c
,	c
but	c
this	c
concert	c
was	c
too	c
small	i
that	i
's	i
why	c
many	c
people	c
had	i
to	i
miss	i
this	c
classical	c
concert	c
.	c

You	c
wrote	c
an	c
advertisment	i
that	i
people	c
from	c
more	c
than	c
15	c
deferent	i
countries	c
were	c
going	c
to	c
visit	c
this	c
concert	c
,	c
but	c
there	c
were	c
artists	c
only	i
from	i
6	c
countries	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
relly	i
pity	i
because	c
I	c
expected	c
to	c
see	c
artists	c
from	c
France	c
and	c
Italy	c
.	c

The	c
International	c
Arts	c
Festival	c
was	c
organised	c
quite	c
well	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
only	c
recomended	i
you	c
to	i
have	i
more	c
artists	c
and	c
a	i
classical	c
concert	c
should	c
be	c
in	c
bigger	i
hall	c
than	i
it	i
was	i
.	c

One	c
man	c
and	c
one	c
woman	c
lived	c
in	c
small	i
house	c
beside	c
the	c
sea	c
.	c

There	i
names	c
were	c
Ivan	c
and	c
Maria	c
.	c

They	c
were	c
so	c
pour	i
that	c
somitimes	i
they	c
hardly	c
had	c
something	i
to	c
eat	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
n't	c
usual	i
fish	c
,	i
it	i
was	c
Gold	i
Fish	c
and	c
it	c
asked	i
him	c
as	i
human	i
;	i
'	c
Please	c
,	c
let	c
me	c
go	c
and	c
I	c
can	c
do	c
for	i
you	i
anything	i
you	i
want	i
'	c
.	c

Afterwards	c
he	c
came	c
back	c
home	c
.	c

He	c
told	c
her	i
wife	c
about	i
this	c
story	c
.	c

She	c
persuide	i
him	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
sea	c
to	c
ask	c
a	i
lot	c
of	c
things	c
for	c
her	c
.	c

Ivan	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
what	c
she	c
said	c
.	c

Gold	c
Fish	c
did	c
everything	c
what	i
Ivan	c
asked	c
.	c

She	c
said	c
that	c
it	i
was	i
n't	i
enough	i
what	i
Gold	i
Fish	i
had	i
done	i
for	i
her	i
.	c

She	c
said	c
that	c
Ivan	c
should	c
bring	c
Gold	c
Fish	c
to	i
home	c
and	c
Ivan	c
could	c
leave	c
this	i
house	c
because	c
she	c
did	c
n't	c
need	c
him	c
anymore	c
.	c

Maria	c
and	c
Ivan	c
were	c
again	i
poor	i
.	c

...	c

I	c
am	i
working	i
as	c
an	c
actor	c
for	c
The	c
Spanish	c
Royal	c
Theatre	c
.	c

Sunday	c
night	c
we	c
went	c
to	c
your	c
theatre	c
.	c

Despite	c
we	i
are	i
actors	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
pay	c
a	i
full	i
ticket	c
because	c
the	c
discounts	c
you	c
promise	c
are	c
not	c
available	c
on	c
Sundays	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
we	c
decided	c
to	c
get	i
into	i
the	c
show	c
.	c

Danny	c
Brook	c
is	c
a	c
good	c
friend	c
of	c
mine	c
and	c
our	c
purpose	i
was	c
to	c
give	c
him	c
a	c
surprise	c
.	c

You	c
can	c
imagine	c
how	i
were	i
our	i
faces	i
like	i
when	c
we	c
saw	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
Danny	c
,	c
but	c
Peter	c
Fox	c
,	c
who	c
was	c
on	c
the	c
stage	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
sure	c
that	c
the	c
restaurant	c
closed	c
at	c
its	c
closing-hour	i
but	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
remember	c
that	c
the	c
show	c
began	c
45	c
minutes	c
late	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
really	c
disappointed	c
.	c

I	c
realize	c
that	c
managing	c
a	c
theatre	c
is	c
a	i
hard	c
work	c
but	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
the	i
money	c
of	i
the	c
tickets	c
back	c
.	c

HOW	c
HAS	c
MODERN	c
TECHNOLOGY	c
CHANGED	c
YOUR	c
DAILY	c
LIFE	c
?	c

Technology	c
makes	c
easier	i
the	i
work	i
at	i
home	i
.	c

During	c
the	c
winter	c
,	c
when	c
it	c
is	c
raining	c
,	c
you	c
can	c
have	c
your	c
clothes	c
dry	c
in	c
less	c
that	i
thirty	c
minutes	c
.	c

That	c
's	c
fantastic	c
.	c

You	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
have	c
some	c
further	c
information	c
from	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
answer	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

Therefore	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
try	i
some	i
kind	i
of	i
experience	i
.	c

In	c
addition	c
swimming	c
would	c
be	c
good	i
activity	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

While	c
I	c
was	c
studying	c
at	c
the	c
high	c
school	c
and	c
the	c
university	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
in	c
the	c
swimming	c
team	c
of	i
the	i
school	i
.	c

When	c
I	c
go	c
there	c
,	c
can	c
I	c
use	c
credit	i
card	c
or	c
should	c
I	c
have	c
cash	c
?	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
your	c
answer	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

However	c
now	i
if	c
someone	c
asks	c
me	c
the	c
same	c
question	c
my	c
answer	c
will	c
be	c
"	i
yes	i
,	c
I	c
like	c
it	c
"	c
.	c

There	c
are	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
shopping	c
style	i
on	i
the	c
world	c
I	i
am	c
sure	c
everybody	c
prefer	i
one	c
of	c
them	c
.	c

You	c
only	c
need	c
to	c
discover	c
what	c
you	c
like	c
,	c
and	c
how	c
you	c
can	c
have	c
fun	c
with	c
shopping	c
.	c

Circle	c
Theater	i

My	c
girlfriend	c
and	c
I	c
read	c
an	c
advertisement	c
about	i
the	c
show	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
which	i
is	c
very	c
popular	c
.	c

She	c
is	c
fond	c
of	c
the	c
actor	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
so	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
buy	c
two	c
tickets	c
,	c
provided	c
there	c
were	c
discounts	c
available	c
.	c

We	c
took	c
our	c
places	c
,	c
and	c
began	c
chatting	c
with	c
other	c
people	c
.	c

We	c
had	c
to	c
wait	c
8.15	i
pm	c
before	c
it	c
started	c
whereas	i
the	c
show	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
start	c
at	c
9.30	c
pm	c
!	c

My	c
girlfriend	c
was	c
very	c
upset	c
and	c
so	c
was	c
I	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

Your	c
children	i
clothes	c
in	c
100	c
years	c

Fashion	c
is	c
changing	c
so	c
quickly	c
that	c
all	c
our	c
dreams	c
about	c
clothes	c
can	c
become	i
true	c
.	c

But	c
let	c
's	c
see	c
my	c
point	c
of	c
view	c
.	c

But	c
maybe	c
the	c
shape	c
of	c
the	c
clothes	c
will	c
changed	i
:	c
large	c
pants	i
as	i
"	i
baggy	i
"	i
,	c
or	c
trousers	c
with	c
many	c
pockets	c
as	c
we	c
see	c
today	c
.	c

For	c
women	c
,	c
clothes	c
change	c
more	c
than	c
for	c
men	i
's	i
.	c

Maybe	c
Luc	c
Besson	c
's	c
"	i
Fifth	i
Element	i
"	i
movie	i
is	c
quite	c
a	c
good	c
example	c
.	c

The	c
clothes	c
were	c
designed	c
by	c
the	c
famous	c
Jean-Paul	c
Gaultier	c
.	c

And	c
it	c
really	c
is	c
an	c
interesting	c
point	c
of	c
view	c
.	c

To	c
conclude	c
,	c
in	c
the	c
end	c
clothes	c
wo	c
n't	c
be	c
what	c
we	c
think	c
about	i
today	c
,	c
and	c
it	c
's	c
a	c
good	c
thing	c
because	c
we	c
can	c
only	c
imagine	c
and	c
follow	c
the	c
trend	c
of	c
fashion	c
that	c
makes	c
us	c
feel	c
pretty	c
and	c
happy	c
.	c

I	c
noticed	c
that	c
the	c
artists	c
were	c
from	c
only	c
six	c
countries	c
insted	i
that	i
from	c
around	c
the	c
world	c
.	c

This	c
choice	i
does	c
n't	c
give	c
many	c
artists	c
the	c
possibility	i
to	c
expresse	i
themself	i
.	c

Some	c
concert	c
halls	c
were	c
too	c
small	c
and	c
often	c
people	c
could	c
n't	c
see	c
the	c
performances	c
.	c

Maybe	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
better	c
put	i
more	c
of	c
them	c
in	c
the	c
programme	c
because	c
they	i
like	i
so	i
much	i
to	i
young	i
people	i
.	c

I	c
think	c
a	c
good	c
way	c
to	c
get	c
money	c
it	i
's	i
work	i
in	c
a	c
fast-food	c
.	i

Maybe	c
the	c
first	c
impression	c
is	c
n't	c
positive	c
but	c
from	i
my	c
personal	c
experience	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
say	c
that	c
this	c
kind	c
of	c
job	c
is	c
right	i
for	c
get	i
some	c
money	c
.	c

For	c
six	c
months	c
I	c
've	c
worked	c
in	c
a	c
McDonald	c
's	c
restaurant	c
in	c
Italy	c
and	c
I	c
've	c
got	c
lots	c
of	c
money	c
.	c

In	i
the	c
staff	c
you	c
can	c
also	c
find	c
young	c
people	c
and	c
getting	i
fun	c
with	c
them	c
during	c
the	i
work	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
need	c
money	c
and	c
you	c
need	c
time	c
for	c
yourself	c
try	c
a	c
job	c
like	c
that	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

According	c
to	c
the	c
advertisement	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
was	c
the	c
male	c
actor	c
.	c

However	c
he	i
did	c
not	c
act	c
,	c
and	c
his	c
sustitute	i
was	c
not	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
acting	c
.	c

The	c
play	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
instead	c
of	c
19.30	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
I	c
could	c
not	c
get	c
a	c
discount	c
although	c
I	c
think	c
I	c
was	c
entitled	c
to	c
it	c
.	c

(	c
I	c
have	c
a	c
special	c
youth	c
card	c
)	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
not	c
available	i
because	c
of	c
the	c
waiters	c
'	c
strike	c
.	c

That	c
is	c
why	c
I	c
ask	c
you	c
for	i
refunding	i
my	c
money	c
,	c
or	c
at	c
least	c
part	c
of	c
it	c
.	c

Faithfully	c
,	c

Now	c
I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
because	c
a	c
story	c
of	i
Agatha	c
Christie	c
is	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
read	c
on	c
the	c
radio	c
.	c

Firstly	c
the	c
main	c
character	c
is	c
Evans	c
,	c
a	c
retired	c
police	c
captain	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
sure	c
you	c
'll	c
agree	c
with	c
me	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
about	c
a	c
woman	c
who	c
poisoned	c
her	c
first	c
husband	c
.	c

Not	c
only	c
is	c
the	c
plot	c
interesting	c
but	c
also	c
it	c
catchs	i
your	c
attention	i
since	i
the	c
first	c
moment	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
you	c
should	c
pay	c
attention	c
to	c
the	c
ending	c
which	i
is	c
surprising	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

I	i
've	i
recently	i
visited	i
London	c
for	i
holidays	i
and	c
during	c
my	c
stay	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
your	c
theatre	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
it	c
says	c
that	c
the	c
main	c
actor	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
be	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
instead	i
of	c
Brook	c
I	c
saw	c
another	c
actor	c
,	c
totally	c
stranger	i
to	c
me	c
.	c

Secondly	c
in	i
the	c
advertisement	c
the	i
starting	c
time	c
of	c
the	c
musical	c
was	c
said	c
to	c
be	c
at	i
19:30	c
,	c
but	c
the	c
theatre	i
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
.	c

Another	c
thing	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
mention	c
is	c
the	c
discount	c
that	c
we	c
were	c
supposed	c
to	c
have	c
on	c
the	c
tickets	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
closing	c
this	c
letter	c
by	c
saying	i
you	c
that	c
that	c
night	c
was	c
the	c
most	c
terrible	c
night	c
of	c
my	c
holidays	c
and	c
that	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
have	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
,	i
please	c

Regards	i

XX	c

As	c
a	c
result	c
of	c
all	c
these	i
advanced	c
technological	i
methods	i
,	c
I	c
became	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
daily	c
users	c
of	c
modern	c
technology	c
.	c

Of	c
course	c
using	c
modern	c
technology	c
has	c
both	c
advantages	c
and	c
disadvantages	c
.	c

Of	c
course	c
this	c
sometimes	i
is	i
an	c
advantage	c
,	c
when	c
for	c
example	c
the	c
computer	c
helps	c
me	c
to	c
do	c
my	c
job	c
easier	i
,	c
but	c
some	c
other	c
times	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
disadvantage	c
because	c
it	c
keeps	c
me	c
away	c
from	c
my	c
friends	c
.	c

But	c
unfortunately	c
I	c
cannot	c
live	c
without	c
a	c
computer	c
.	c

The	i
computer	c
has	c
become	c
my	i
second	c
nature	c
.	c

I	c
always	c
carry	c
with	c
me	c
my	c
mobile	c
phone	c
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
modern	c
technology	c
is	i
offering	i
to	i
the	i
humanity	c
to	i
many	c
things	c
,	c
some	c
of	c
them	c
are	c
good	c
and	c
some	c
others	c
are	c
not	c
so	c
good	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
up	c
to	c
us	c
if	c
we	c
can	i
use	c
those	c
technological	c
achievements	c
in	c
the	c
right	c
way	c
,	c
and	c
make	c
our	c
lives	c
easier	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
is	i
going	c
to	c
destroy	c
you	c
.	c

Your	c
programme	c
is	c
excellent	c
because	c
it	c
tries	c
to	c
offer	c
to	i
the	c
students	c
the	c
best	c
way	c
to	c
spend	c
our	i
time	c
without	c
wasting	c
time	c
in	i
silly	c
places	c
or	c
events	c
.	c

We	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
because	c
the	i
kind	c
of	c
happening	i
shows	c
how	c
you	i
are	i
dedicated	i
with	i
our	c
school	c
and	c
the	c
students	c
that	c
study	c
there	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
for	c
us	c
because	c
there	c
will	c
be	c
expositions	i
of	c
the	c
latest	c
fashions	c
,	c
of	c
the	c
new	c
hairstyles	c
,	c
of	i
the	c
new	c
leisure	c
and	c
sports	c
clothes	c
and	c
people	c
teaching	c
how	c
to	c
make	i
up	i
.	c

Our	c
suggestion	c
is	c
that	c
you	c
could	c
change	c
the	i
day	i
of	i
the	i
leisure	i
time	i
to	i
the	i
shopping	i
in	i
the	i
afternoon	i
.	c

Thanks	c
for	c
the	i
attention	c
and	c
we	c
're	c
waiting	c
for	c
your	c
answer	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	i
,	c

Nowadays	c
,	c
the	c
media	c
is	c
expanding	c
its	c
ways	i
of	c
communication	c
so	c
they	c
need	c
more	c
information	c
.	c

If	c
the	c
famous	c
person	c
does	c
n't	c
mind	c
in	i
being	c
filmed	c
in	c
his	c
personal	c
life	c
there	c
's	c
no	c
problem	c
.	c

But	c
if	c
the	c
politicians	c
or	c
the	c
film	c
stars	c
ask	c
for	c
privacity	i
the	c
media	c
has	c
to	c
respect	c
.	i

Everybody	c
likes	c
to	c
be	c
with	c
your	i
family	c
without	c
any	c
reporter	c
or	c
photographer	c
.	i

In	c
summary	c
,	c
the	c
best	c
thing	c
to	c
do	c
is	c
try	c
to	c
extract	c
from	c
these	c
people	c
their	c
best	c
qualities	c
and	c
not	c
try	c
to	c
find	c
things	c
that	c
could	c
irritate	c
them	c
like	c
familiar	i
problems	c
or	c
personal	c
problems	c
.	c

The	i
respect	i
is	c
essential	c
.	c

They	c
deserve	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
private	c
life	c
like	c
any	c
common	i
person	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
you	i
to	c
show	i
my	c
disagree	i
about	i
the	c
musical	c
show	c
'	c
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
.	c

First	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
dissapointed	i
with	i
the	c
starring	i
.	c

I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
musical	c
to	c
see	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
acting	c
and	c
singing	c
,	c
but	c
he	c
did	c
n't	c
appear	c
.	c

That	c
is	c
why	c
,	c
it	i
finished	c
later	c
and	i
I	c
arrived	c
late	c
to	c
a	c
basketball	c
match	i
.	c

Another	c
thing	c
is	c
that	c
there	c
were	c
not	c
any	c
discounts	c
in	i
the	c
entrance	c
fee	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
closed	c
all	i
sundays	i
,	i
you	c
have	c
to	c
say	c
it	i
.	c

That	c
is	c
why	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
pleased	c
if	c
you	c
give	c
my	i
money	c
back	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
worried	c
because	c
if	c
my	c
parents	c
knew	c
that	c
I	c
had	c
failed	c
,	c
before	c
we	c
were	c
on	c
holidays	i
,	c
they	c
will	i
cancelled	i
the	c
trip	c
to	c
Africa	c
.	c

But	c
,	c
I	c
need	i
to	c
say	i
it	i
to	i
someone	i
,	c
so	c
I	c
told	i
it	i
to	i
Pat	i
.	c

The	c
next	c
day	c
,	c
all	c
the	c
class	c
knew	c
it	i
.	c

But	c
,	c
when	i
my	c
mother	c
was	i
talking	i
with	i
Pat	c
's	c
mother	c
and	c
she	c
mentioned	c
it	c
,	c
my	i
mother	c
cancelled	c
the	c
trip	c
to	c
Africa	c
.	c

Not	c
only	c
were	c
there	c
Jazz	c
and	c
Rock	c
but	c
there	c
were	c
clasics	i
as	c
well	c
.	c

They	c
were	c
very	c
small	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
pushed	c
by	c
everyone	c
.	c

There	c
were	c
wonderful	c
plays	c
and	c
films	c
which	c
I	c
hope	c
that	i
there	c
would	i
have	i
been	i
more	c
.	i

All	c
the	c
other	c
shows	c
such	c
as	c
dance	c
shows	c
,	c
art	c
exhibition	i
and	c
talks	c
by	c
writers	c
were	c
very	c
amusing	i
.	c

Yours	c
Sincerely	c

On	c
the	c
way	c
they	c
were	c
thirsty	c
so	c
when	c
they	c
looked	c
into	c
the	c
lake	c
,	c
they	c
saw	c
a	c
long	c
bar	c
of	c
gold	c
.	c

The	c
widower	c
told	c
the	c
widow	c
leave	c
it	c
alone	c
as	c
they	c
could	c
n't	c
share	c
it	c
when	c
the	c
widow	c
told	c
him	c
.	c

They	c
kept	c
going	c
on	c
until	c
they	c
met	c
a	c
fat	c
,	c
small	c
man	c
.	c

He	c
came	c
and	c
said	c
to	c
the	c
widower	c
that	c
he	c
was	c
to	c
bring	i
him	c
on	c
his	c
back	c
.	c

The	c
widow	c
who	i
was	c
afaid	c
told	i
the	c
man	c
of	i
the	c
gold	c
.	c

When	c
the	c
man	c
hurriedly	c
ran	c
to	c
the	c
lake	c
,	c
all	c
he	c
found	c
was	c
a	c
long	c
snake	c
.	c

The	c
widower	c
was	c
confused	c
and	c
they	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
lake	c
.	c

AND	c
IT	c
WAS	c
REALLY	c
SPECIAL	c
!	c
!	c
!	c

NOBODY	c
TELL	i
US	c
ANYTHING	c
ABOUT	c
THE	c
CHANGES	c
,	c
AND	c
WE	c
WANT	c
THAT	i
YOU	c
GIVE	i
US	c
BACK	c
THE	c
MONEY	c
.	i

I	c
WAIT	c
YOUR	i
ANSWER	c
,	c
AND	c
OUR	i
MONEY	c
BACK	c
AS	c
SOON	c
AS	c
POSSIBLE	c
.	c

Your	i
's	i
faithfully	c
,	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

He	c
was	c
shy	c
,	c
reserved	c
and	c
a	c
very	c
closed	c
person	c
.	c

Despite	c
his	c
way	c
of	c
live	i
,	c
his	c
best	c
friend	c
was	c
Anna	c
,	c
the	c
most	c
popular	c
girl	c
in	c
the	c
school	c
.	c

When	c
Pat	c
was	c
16	c
,	c
he	c
decided	c
to	c
change	c
his	c
way	c
of	c
live	i
,	c
spending	i
more	c
time	c
with	c
friends	c
,	c
but	c
what	c
he	i
could	i
do	c
to	c
have	i
some	c
friends	c
?	c

Definately	i
the	i
worse	i
.	c

He	c
was	c
very	c
happy	c
,	c
because	c
he	c
felt	c
that	c
everybody	c
loved	c
him	c
.	c

Everyone	c
,	i
less	i
Anna	c
.	c

She	c
did	c
n't	c
tell	c
him	c
anything	c
more	i
,	c
and	c
Pat	c
did	c
n't	c
have	c
any	c
secret	i
to	c
sell	c
to	c
his	c
"	c
new	c
friends	c
"	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
NO	i
!	c

And	c
you	c
?	c

My	c
name	c
is	c
Veronika	c
.	c

And	i
I	c
visited	c
your	c
theatre	c
to	c
see	c
a	c
musical	c
show	c
"	i
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
there	c
were	c
the	i
different	c
actors	c
in	c
a	i
show	c
,	c
but	c
you	c
did	c
n't	c
say	c
anything	c
about	c
it	c
before	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

As	c
a	c
result	c
I	i
missed	c
my	c
train	c
.	c

The	c
third	c
problem	c
was	c
the	c
discounts	c
.	c

There	c
were	c
no	c
ay	i
discount	i
at	c
all	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
student	c
and	c
I	c
know	c
that	c
I	c
can	c
get	c
tickets	c
with	c
the	i
discount	c
.	c

And	c
the	c
last	c
disappointment	c
was	c
your	c
restaurant	i
after	i
the	c
show	c
.	c

So	c
as	i
a	i
conclusion	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
one	c
piece	c
of	c
advice	c
-	c
try	c
to	c
organise	c
your	c
shows	c
more	c
carefully	c
.	c

With	c
the	i
best	c
wishes	c

How	c
has	c
modern	c
technology	c
changed	c
your	c
daily	c
life	c
?	c

We	c
know	c
that	c
everything	c
is	c
changing	c
.	c

Not	c
so	c
long	c
ago	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
many	c
things	c
by	c
our	i
hand	c
,	c
but	c
now	c
there	c
re	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
machines	c
to	c
do	c
the	c
same	c
.	c

And	c
it	c
makes	c
our	c
life	c
easier	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
earlier	i
I	i
used	c
to	c
wash	c
my	c
clothes	c
by	c
hand	c
,	c
but	c
now	c
I	c
have	c
the	c
last	i
version	c
of	c
wash	i
machine	i
and	c
now	c
there	c
are	c
no	c
any	i
reasons	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
by	c
hand	c
.	c

Earlier	i
it	i
took	c
me	c
3	c
hours	c
,	c
but	c
now	c
it	c
is	c
my	i
free	c
time	c
and	c
I	c
can	c
go	c
for	c
a	c
walk	c
with	c
my	c
friends	c
.	c

And	c
it	c
takes	c
bout	i
1	c
minute	c
to	c
make	c
a	c
copy	c
but	i
not	c
1	c
hour	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
modern	c
technology	c
gives	c
us	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
opportunities	c
to	c
do	c
the	i
really	i
important	i
for	i
our	i
life	i
things	i
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
organising	c
the	c
trip	c
to	c
London	c
.	c

The	c
purpose	i
that	c
I	c
am	c
writing	c
due	i
to	i
the	i
fact	i
that	c
my	c
class	c
has	c
seen	c
an	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
.	c

This	c
is	c
great	i
opportunity	c
for	c
the	c
student	i
to	c
learn	c
the	i
changing	i
in	c
fashion	c
and	c
leisure	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
free	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
wondering	c
if	c
you	c
would	c
consider	c
our	c
suggestion	c
about	c
changing	c
the	c
programme	c
.	c

We	c
agreed	i
all	i
that	c
the	c
programme	c
on	c
Monday	c
March	c
13th	c
is	c
wonderful	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
we	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
change	c
the	c
plans	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
and	c
Wednesday	c
in	c
the	c
morning	c
.	c

On	c
Tuesday	c
morning	c
,	c
we	c
will	c
visit	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
show	c
instead	c
of	c
visiting	c
Science	i
Museum	c
and	c
we	c
will	c
go	c
there	c
tomorrow	i
morning	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

The	c
discussion	c
about	c
whether	c
or	c
not	c
the	i
famous	c
people	c
deserve	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
private	c
life	c
without	c
journalists	c
following	c
them	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
is	c
the	i
controversial	c
one	c
.	c

There	c
is	c
evidence	i
that	i
these	c
people	c
's	c
life	i
should	c
be	c
advertised	i
by	c
the	c
media	c
.	c

Obviously	c
,	c
they	c
have	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
fans	c
and	c
their	c
fans	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
what	c
happened	i
to	c
them	c
.	c

Sometime	i
,	c
many	i
people	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
what	c
to	c
do	c
and	c
they	c
should	c
the	i
person	i
who	i
they	i
admire	i
to	i
immitate	i
.	c

However	c
,	c
there	c
is	i
other	i
disadvantages	c
that	c
we	c
should	c
consider	c
.	c

Eventhough	i
,	c
the	i
famous	c
people	c
can	c
be	c
the	i
good	c
example	c
,	c
they	c
should	i
be	i
the	i
bad	i
habit	i
for	i
public	i
.	c

A	c
lot	c
of	c
people	c
try	c
to	c
be	c
like	c
people	c
who	c
they	c
admire	c
,	c
For	i
example	c
,	c
buying	c
the	c
clothes	c
that	c
famous	c
people	c
wear	c
.	c

To	c
Prevent	i
many	i
people	c
from	c
copying	c
too	c
much	c
we	c
should	c
n't	c
inform	c
all	i
aspects	c
of	c
life	i
of	c
famous	c
people	c
.	c

I	c
agree	c
that	c
the	i
famous	c
people	i
life	i
should	c
be	c
in	i
private	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madame	i
,	c

I	c
think	c
I	c
could	c
leave	c
for	c
the	c
camp	c
in	c
July	c
.	c

Because	c
I	c
'm	c
supposed	c
to	c
attend	c
an	c
English	c
course	c
in	c
Weymouth	c
,	c
England	c
until	c
June	c
and	c
then	c
I	c
'm	c
going	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
Europe	c
with	c
my	c
sister	c
who	c
came	c
from	c
my	c
country	c
4	c
weeks	c
ago	c
for	c
this	c
trip	c
.	c

We	c
are	c
planning	c
to	c
spend	c
2	c
weeks	c
travelling	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
can	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
camp	c
in	c
the	c
middle	c
of	c
the	i
July	c
.	c

And	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
.	c

I	c
've	c
had	c
unpleasant	c
experience	i
from	i
my	c
last	c
holidays	c
when	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
.	c

I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
practice	i
golf	c
and	c
tennis	c
.	c

Both	c
of	c
them	c
are	c
my	c
favorite	i
sports	c
and	c
I	c
'm	c
quite	c
good	c
.	c

I	i
'll	i
be	c
grateful	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
send	c
me	c
further	c
information	c
.	c

I	c
'll	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
your	c
reply	c
.	c

Yours	i
Sincerely	i

I	c
'm	c
very	c
extroverted	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
like	c
spend	c
my	c
energy	c
doing	c
sports	c
or	c
some	c
kinds	c
of	c
energetic	c
activity	c
.	c

Especially	c
when	c
I	c
visit	c
somewhere	c
for	c
the	c
first	c
time	c
or	c
I	c
have	c
nothing	c
to	c
do	c
,	c
but	c
lots	c
of	c
time	c
,	c
I	c
naturally	c
and	c
automatically	c
look	c
for	c
a	c
decent	c
shopping	c
centre	c
.	c

But	c
nowadays	c
I	c
found	i
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

Since	c
I	c
started	c
living	c
in	c
England	c
,	c
I	c
've	c
worked	c
two	c
part	c
time	c
jobs	c
as	c
a	c
cleaner	c
.	c

I	c
ca	c
n't	c
make	c
enough	c
money	c
for	c
my	c
living	c
expense	i
.	c

I	c
really	c
wanted	c
to	c
buy	c
it	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
afford	c
to	c
buy	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
refer	c
to	c
your	c
letter	c
in	c
which	c
you	c
informed	c
me	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
prise	i
in	c
the	c
competition	c
.	c

You	c
asked	c
me	c
for	c
some	c
further	c
information	c
and	c
hear	i
are	c
my	c
"	c
desirs	i
"	c
:	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
only	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
in	c
August	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
study	c
for	c
an	c
exam	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
do	c
painting	c
,	c
because	c
one	c
of	c
my	c
greatest	c
hobbies	c
is	c
silk-painting	i
and	c
so	c
I	c
think	c
I	c
can	c
improve	c
my	c
abilities	c
.	c

The	c
second	c
activity	c
,	i
which	c
I	c
choose	c
is	c
playing	c
basketball	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
love	c
this	c
wonderful	c
sport	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
that	c
you	c
are	c
now	c
well	c
informed	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
which	i
clothes	c
and	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
should	c
bring	c
with	c
me	c
.	c

Your	i
sincerely	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
are	c
fine	c
.	c

My	c
first	c
task	c
was	c
to	c
open	c
the	c
doors	c
to	c
let	c
in	c
all	c
the	c
fans	i
of	i
Britney	i
Spears	i
.	c

I	c
stood	c
at	c
the	c
entry	i
and	c
theire	i
I	c
had	c
to	c
check	c
the	c
tickets	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
to	c
tell	c
one	c
of	c
them	c
,	i
that	c
she	c
had	c
to	c
leave	c
.	c

Summing	c
up	c
I	i
can	c
say	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
fantastic	c
day	c
,	c
because	c
Britney	c
sang	c
so	c
beautiful	i
and	c
the	c
performance	c
was	c
also	c
super	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
,	c
on	i
the	i
name	i
of	i
all	c
my	c
English	c
class	c
,	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
the	c
opportunity	c
you	c
give	i
us	c
to	c
spend	c
three	c
days	c
in	c
London	c
,	c
but	c
also	c
to	c
suggest	c
some	c
modifications	c
in	i
the	c
programme	c
.	c

The	c
programme	c
you	c
has	i
already	c
organised	c
is	c
very	c
interesting	c
,	c
especially	c
because	c
it	c
provides	c
a	c
good	c
combination	c
between	i
cultural	c
visits	c
and	c
more	c
relaxed	c
activities	c
.	c

The	c
only	c
day	c
we	c
can	c
attend	c
to	i
this	c
show	c
is	c
the	i
Tuesday	c
14th	c
March	c
from	c
10	c
am	c
to	c
7	c
pm	c
in	c
the	c
Central	c
Exhibition	c
Hall	c
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
I	c
suggest	c
that	c
we	c
go	c
directly	c
after	i
the	i
Science	i
Museum	i
to	i
the	i
show	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
waiting	c
for	c
your	c
answer	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	i

Famous	c
people	c
have	c
always	c
been	c
the	c
center	i
of	c
interest	c
for	c
number	i
of	c
people	c
.	c

But	c
do	c
we	c
think	c
enough	c
about	c
the	c
right	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
private	c
life	c
?	c

We	c
can	c
watch	i
this	c
problem	c
from	c
two	c
different	c
points	c
of	c
view	c
.	c

But	c
from	i
the	i
other	i
,	c
everybody	c
has	c
the	c
right	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
secret	c
garden	c
,	c
the	c
right	c
to	c
be	c
with	c
his/her	c
family	c
without	c
be	i
disturbed	c
by	c
journalists	c
and	c
photographers	c
.	c

The	c
case	c
of	c
the	i
Princess	c
Diana	c
showed	c
how	c
this	c
problem	c
can	c
reach	c
such	i
extremities	i
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
say	c
that	c
both	c
parts	i
,	c
famous	c
people	c
and	c
journalists	c
,	c
have	c
to	c
respect	c
some	c
rules	c
.	c

As	c
public	c
people	c
,	c
stars	c
and	c
politicians	c
have	c
to	c
accord	i
some	c
time	c
to	c
their	c
public	c
but	c
fans	c
and	c
press	c
people	c
have	c
to	c
respect	c
their	c
private	c
life	c
and	c
to	c
stay	c
polite	c
and	c
respectful	c
.	c

Fortunately	c
,	c
there	c
is	c
the	c
London	c
fashion	c
and	c
leisure	c
show	c
which	i
is	c
held	c
once	c
a	c
year	c
.	c

We	c
will	c
be	c
on	c
time	c
for	c
the	c
second	c
show	c
at	c
13.30	c
P.M	c
and	c
we	c
can	c
enjoy	c
the	c
show	c
until	c
19.00	c
P.M	c
.	c

I'am	i
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
your	c
opinion	c
on	i
my	c
suggestion	c
.	c

Your	i
sincerely	c
,	c

It	c
does	c
n't	c
mater	i
who	c
they	c
are	c
,	c
where	c
they	c
are	i
coming	i
from	c
,	c
which	i
color	i
of	i
their	i
skin	c
they	c
have	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
think	c
of	c
"	c
the	c
Home	c
of	c
the	c
Future	c
"	c
.	i

Home	i
made	c
out	c
of	c
plastic	c
also	i
windows	c
made	c
out	c
of	c
plastic	c
therefore	i
we	c
can	i
have	c
our	c
home	c
for	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
.	c

We	c
have	c
more	c
time	c
to	c
stay	c
together	c
at	c
home	c
,	c
watching	c
TV	c
,	c
playing	c
games	c
,	c
etc	c
....	c
because	c
we	c
can	c
access	c
to	i
internet	i
at	c
home	i
we	i
can	c
have	c
all	c
informations	i
from	c
internet	i
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
the	c
best	c
way	i
of	c
education	c
and	c
working	c
when	c
we	c
can	c
stay	c
and	c
learn	c
or	c
work	c
from	c
home	c
.	c

We	c
have	c
more	c
time	c
for	c
the	c
family	c
who	i
need	i
mostly	i
care	c
and	c
love	c
.	c

It	i
will	c
be	c
a	c
numer	i
of	c
Developments	c
in	c
Technology	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
,	c
which	c
can	i
make	c
our	c
life	c
easier	c
to	c
live	c
but	c
what	c
should	c
remain	c
the	c
same	c
is	c
feeling	i
of	c
being	c
together	c
and	c
love	c
.	c

This	i
2	c
feelings	c
can	i
not	i
be	c
replaced	c
by	c
any	c
Technology	c
but	c
we	c
can	c
use	c
them	c
to	c
make	c
a	c
better	c
home	c
of	i
the	c
future	c
.	c

Dear	c
J.	c
Clark	c
,	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
in	c
response	c
to	c
your	c
advertisement	c
about	c
the	c
annual	c
international	c
arts	c
festival	c
.	c

I	c
really	c
think	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
great	c
idea	c
to	c
organize	c
such	c
a	c
festival	c
in	c
our	c
city	c
as	c
there	c
are	c
lots	c
of	c
people	c
fond	c
of	c
art	c
over	c
here	c
.	c

I	c
've	c
already	c
been	c
to	c
the	c
festival	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
's	c
really	c
important	c
to	c
let	c
people	c
see	c
artists	c
from	c
all	c
over	c
the	c
world	c
.	c

I	c
also	c
think	c
the	c
places	c
you	c
have	c
chosen	c
for	c
the	c
classical	c
concerts	c
were	c
not	c
good	c
sometimes	c
,	c
some	c
of	c
the	c
halls	c
seemed	c
to	c
be	c
too	c
small	c
.	c

But	c
your	c
idea	c
about	c
the	c
weekend	c
ticket	c
is	c
just	c
excellent	c
,	c
people	c
from	c
the	c
whole	c
country	c
get	c
the	c
opportunity	c
to	c
visit	c
your	c
festival	c
and	c
see	c
all	c
the	c
events	c
you	c
are	c
offering	c
.	c

I	c
've	c
got	c
just	c
one	c
more	c
suggestion	c
for	c
next	c
year	c
's	c
festival	c
.	c

You	c
could	c
probably	c
show	c
a	c
little	i
bit	i
more	c
films	c
and	c
interviews	c
with	c
the	c
most	c
interesting	c
artists	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
sure	c
it	c
would	c
attract	c
lots	c
of	c
young	c
people	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

Thank	c
you	c
so	c
much	c
for	c
your	c
lovely	c
letter	c
,	c
it	c
's	c
always	c
great	c
to	c
get	c
something	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Howe	i
are	c
things	c
going	c
over	c
there	c
?	c

It	c
's	c
quite	c
difficult	c
to	c
talk	c
bout	i
our	c
school	c
rules	c
actually	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
'll	c
try	c
to	c
help	c
you	c
somehow	c
.	c

Our	c
teaches	i
do	c
n't	c
let	c
us	c
smoke	c
of	i
course	c
,	c
but	c
you	c
can	c
always	c
see	c
some	c
students	c
smoking	c
outside	c
,	c
so	c
it	c
's	c
not	c
that	c
strict	c
to	c
be	c
honest	c
.	c

We	c
're	c
not	c
allowed	c
to	c
drink	c
alcohol	c
as	c
well	c
and	c
quarrel	c
with	c
any	c
of	c
the	c
teaches	i
.	c

As	c
for	c
our	c
rules	c
at	c
home	c
,	c
it	c
's	c
always	c
different	c
and	c
depends	i
just	i
on	c
your	c
family	c
.	c

My	c
parents	c
are	c
not	c
very	c
strict	c
as	i
you	c
know	c
and	i
I	c
appreciate	c
them	c
for	c
giving	c
me	c
freedom	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
the	c
only	c
rule	c
in	c
my	c
house	c
is	c
to	c
care	c
bout	i
each	c
other	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
to	c
hear	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c

Dear	c
Mr	i
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

Because	c
I	c
go	c
on	c
holiday	c
in	c
July	c
naturally	i
,	c
and	c
I	c
have	i
two	i
terms	i
in	i
June	c
and	c
August	c
.	c

Because	c
I	c
grew	c
up	c
in	c
my	i
home	i
town	i
that	c
is	c
a	c
seaside	c
city	c
.	i

I	c
was	i
starting	i
trainning	i
since	i
1996	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
give	i
it	c
up	c
.	c

Esepically	i
,	c
it	c
is	i
really	c
good	c
for	c
my	c
healthy	i
during	i
the	i
growth	i
period	i
.	c

Photography	c
is	c
my	c
hobby	c
that	i
is	i
taken	i
in	i
my	i
spare	i
time	i
.	c

It	c
must	i
be	c
nice	c
for	i
my	i
memories	i
when	c
I	c
am	c
older	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
,	c
it	c
could	c
showed	i
people	c
how	c
nice	c
the	c
places	c
are	i
and	c
the	c
views	i
I	i
have	i
got	i
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
the	i
weather	c
in	c
California	c
.	c

Do	c
I	c
need	c
take	i
too	i
much	i
clothes	c
?	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
!	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c

It	i
seems	i
a	i
human	i
activity	i
during	i
their	i
spare	i
time	i
.	c

It	c
is	c
new	c
for	c
customers	i
by	i
technology	c
they	c
can	c
switch	c
on	c
the	c
computer	c
and	c
click	c
everything	c
they	c
want	c
.	c

Therefore	c
,	c
it	c
looks	i
like	i
a	i
service	i
and	c
also	i
boring	c
for	c
customer	i
.	c

They	c
are	c
always	c
waiting	c
for	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
after	i
women	c
finish	i
their	c
shopping	c
.	c

Therefore	c
,	c
they	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
use	c
"	c
e-shopping	c
"	c
which	i
is	c
getting	i
better	i
for	i
their	i
time	i
.	c

The	c
life	i
style	i
has	c
change	i
already	c
from	c
past	i
.	c

Shopping	c
is	c
common	i
activity	c
in	c
their	c
life	c
.	c

We	c
must	c
focus	c
on	c
the	c
specific	c
life	i
style	i
,	c
which	c
will	c
make	c
us	c
enjoyable	i
.	c

And	i
you	i
could	i
n't	i
get	i
back	i
any	i
more	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
because	c
there	c
were	c
deviations	c
from	c
the	c
advertisement	c
which	c
is	i
published	c
on	i
the	c
newspaper	c
.	c

According	i
to	i
the	i
advert	i
,	i
it	i
says	i
clearly	i
that	c
discounts	c
are	c
available	c
,	c
but	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
buying	c
the	c
tickets	c
,	c
I	c
did	i
not	i
have	i
this	i
offer	i
.	c

As	c
a	c
result	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
pay	c
the	c
full	c
price	c
of	c
£	c
15	c
.	c

The	c
second	c
point	c
is	c
that	c
the	c
show	c
had	i
a	i
delay	i
of	i
about	c
30	c
minutes	c
.	c

Apart	c
from	c
that	c
,	c
the	c
most	c
disappointing	c
fact	c
is	c
that	c
there	c
were	c
different	c
actors	c
instead	c
of	c
Danny	c
brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
,	c
for	i
whom	c
I	c
was	i
coming	i
.	c

After	c
the	c
show	c
we	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
Theatre	i
restaurant	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
due	i
to	i
the	i
refurbishment	c
.	c

I	c
therefore	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
compensation	i
of	c
£	i
30	c
which	c
I	c
spent	c
on	c
the	c
tickets	c
.	c

Although	c
failing	c
in	c
the	c
exams	c
was	c
n't	c
really	c
a	c
big	c
deal	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
awful	c
that	c
people	c
kept	c
mentioning	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
thought	i
I	i
was	i
not	i
going	c
to	c
survive	c
after	c
failing	c
the	c
exams	c
and	c
my	c
best	c
friend	c
had	c
been	c
untrustful	i
.	c

but	i
this	i
idea	i
was	i
soon	i
be	i
put	i
off	i
since	c
I	c
noticed	c
on	i
the	c
newspaper	c
that	c
I	c
had	c
won	c
the	c
writing	c
competition	c
.	c

The	i
last	c
few	c
days	c
,	c
we	c
spent	c
our	c
time	c
on	i
sightseeing	c
and	c
shopping	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
last	c
day	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
packing	c
and	c
getting	c
ready	c
to	c
leave	c
,	c
I	c
realised	c
I	c
had	c
lost	c
my	c
passport	c
and	c
tickets	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
,	c

Last	c
week	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
week	c
's	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
,	c
where	c
I	c
have	i
n't	i
been	c
for	c
2	c
years	c
.	c

At	c
first	c
,	c
you	c
said	c
that	c
,	i
if	c
we	c
had	i
bought	i
5	c
tickets	c
,	c
we	c
would	c
have	i
had	i
a	c
discount	c
,	c
but	c
we	c
did	c
n't	c
have	i
anything	i
.	c

Thirdly	c
,	c
someone	i
on	c
stage	c
was	c
very	c
strenge	i
for	i
me	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
expected	c
to	c
see	c
"	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
"	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
no	c
idea	c
what	i
your	i
business	i
is	i
,	i
I	c
have	c
never	c
seen	c
something	i
like	c
this	c
.	c

By	c
the	c
way	c
,	c
I	c
want	c
you	c
to	c
pay	i
my	i
money	c
back	c
for	i
the	c
waste	i
time	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
you	c
understand	c
.	c

Try	c
it	c
,	i
it	i
does	i
n't	i
need	i
to	i
take	i
a	i
long	i
time	i
to	i
live	i
in	i
that	i
place	i
,	i
but	i
it	i
will	i
give	i
you	i
many	i
things	i
,	c
which	c
are	c
different	c
from	c
your	c
lifestyle	c
in	c
city	i
.	c

How	i
much	c
the	i
technology	c
gives	c
to	c
you	c
,	c
it	c
take	i
from	i
you	i
more	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
never	c
expected	i
that	c
I	c
could	c
be	c
so	c
decepted	i
.	c

This	c
is	c
not	c
the	c
firt	i
time	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
in	i
your	c
theatre	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
I	c
have	c
enjoyed	c
many	c
other	c
plays	c
,	c
but	c
be	c
sure	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
"	c
will	c
be	c
the	c
last	c
one	c
.	c

As	c
I	c
am	c
specially	c
fond	c
of	c
musicals	c
,	c
I	c
even	c
travel	c
abroad	c
to	c
see	c
what	c
's	c
new	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
probably	c
one	c
of	c
the	i
most	c
devoted	c
customers	c
.	c

We	c
both	c
know	c
this	c
is	c
not	c
true	c
,	c
or	c
shoud	i
n't	i
be	c
.	c

There	c
was	c
no	c
reason	c
either	c
for	c
the	c
delay	c
.	c

Almost	c
an	c
hour	c
!	c

Even	c
listening	i
some	c
music	c
to	c
help	c
us	c
take	c
it	c
easy	c
would	c
had	i
been	c
better	c
than	c
nothing	c
!	c

The	c
bar	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

Well	c
,	c
I	c
will	c
not	c
comment	c
that	i
point	c
.	c

Of	c
course	c
,	c
you	c
shoud	i
make	i
a	c
refund	c
of	i
the	c
money	c
,	i
not	c
only	c
to	c
me	c
but	c
to	c
all	c
the	c
public	i
.	c

But	c
I	c
can	c
say	c
that	c
you	c
will	c
never	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
give	c
my	c
appreciation	c
for	c
your	c
theatre	c
back	c
,	c
at	c
least	c
till	i
you	c
continue	c
as	c
its	c
manager	c
.	c

Expecting	c
your	c
news	c
,	c

New	c
fabrics	c
create	c
new	c
textures	c
,	c
all	c
kind	i
of	c
accesories	i
are	c
added	c
to	c
create	c
new	c
versions	c
,	c
to	c
refresh	c
old	c
ideas	c
,	c
to	c
make	c
new	c
proposals	c
that	c
will	c
last	c
,	c
like	i
always	c
,	c
just	c
some	i
weeks	c
.	c

All	i
in	i
fashion	c
pass	i
away	c
in	c
a	c
couple	c
of	c
months	c
and	c
has	c
to	c
be	c
created	c
again	c
.	c

Fashion	c
is	c
a	c
part	c
of	c
our	c
lives	c
,	c
even	c
for	c
those	c
who	c
will	c
never	c
reconize	i
it	c
.	c

Have	c
you	c
notice	i
that	c
all	c
the	c
classic	c
gentlemen	c
wear	c
same	i
tipe	i
of	c
suit	c
?	c

And	c
what	c
about	c
this	i
kind	i
of	c
intellectual	c
and	c
progressive	c
people	c
,	c
do	c
n't	c
they	c
wear	i
all	i
the	c
same	c
model	i
of	c
ugly	c
but	c
confortable	i
shoes	c
?	c

I	c
am	c
sure	c
that	c
fashion	c
will	c
survive	c
for	c
ages	c
,	c
even	i
it	i
will	i
change	c
to	c
become	c
easier	c
to	c
use	c
and	c
clean	i
,	c
because	c
we	c
all	c
need	c
to	c
feel	c
a	c
part	c
of	c
our	c
society	c
,	c
comunicate	i
our	c
way	c
of	c
living	c
and	c
thinking	c
,	c
be	c
part	c
of	c
a	c
group	c
and	c
,	c
at	c
the	c
same	c
time	c
be	i
different	c
.	c

The	c
future	c
will	c
bring	c
to	c
us	c
new	c
concepts	c
,	c
adapted	c
to	c
our	c
lives	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
the	c
actors	c
were	c
different	c
from	c
those	c
who	c
were	c
advertised	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
my	c
dream	c
to	c
see	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
,	c
so	c
it	c
is	c
still	c
my	c
dream	c
because	c
of	c
your	c
show	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
no	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
and	c
I	c
want	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
'll	c
understand	c
my	c
situation	c
and	c
if	c
you	c
want	c
other	c
people	c
to	c
visit	c
your	c
show	c
,	c
you	c
should	c
return	c
my	c
money	c
.	c

How	c
has	c
modern	c
techology	i
changed	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
.	i

Fifty	c
years	c
ago	c
people	c
even	i
did	i
n't	i
think	c
that	c
after	c
2000	c
years	c
they	c
would	c
have	c
another	c
life	c
.	c

When	c
Thomas	c
Adison	c
invented	c
an	i
electric	c
light	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
the	c
greatest	c
invention	c
for	c
people	c
of	c
that	c
centure	i
.	c

And	c
nowadays	c
modern	c
technology	c
can	c
change	c
all	c
our	c
life	i
.	c

My	c
life	c
is	c
changing	c
too	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
now	i
I	c
can	c
phone	c
my	c
friends	c
and	c
parents	c
from	c
every	c
place	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
chat	c
with	c
other	c
foreign	c
teenagers	c
with	c
the	c
help	c
of	c
the	c
internet	i
.	c

Second	c
modern	i
technology	c
helps	c
me	c
in	c
the	c
kitchen	c
.	c

Further	i
more	i
,	c
yesterday	c
I	i
've	i
heard	i
that	c
every	c
man	c
could	c
fly	c
to	i
the	i
space	c
without	c
any	c
experience	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
great	c
,	c
from	c
my	c
point	c
of	c
view	c
in	i
2050	i
year	i
everybody	c
will	c
fly	c
to	i
the	i
space	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
people	i
can	c
atrophided	i
of	c
all	c
this	i
inventions	c
.	c

He	i
become	c
lazy	c
because	c
they	c
know	c
that	c
they	c
can	c
seat	i
on	c
the	c
sofa	c
and	c
turn	i
the	c
chances	i
on	c
the	c
TV	c
by	c
pressing	c
a	c
boton	i
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
:	c

I	c
am	c
afraid	c
but	i
I	c
think	c
that	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
not	c
as	c
good	c
as	c
I	c
expected	c
:	c
the	c
reason	i
were	c
many	c
.	c

-	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
and	c
not	c
at	c
19.30	c
.	c

Yours	c
Faithfully	c
,	c

Manuel	c
Juan	c
Sargo	c

But	c
in	i
the	i
other	i
hand	i
we	c
have	c
the	c
disadvantages	c
.	c

The	i
technology	i
makes	c
your	c
life	c
easier	c
but	c
,	i
until	i
when	i
?	c

Because	c
too	c
many	c
cars	c
mean	i
too	c
much	c
CO2	c
in	c
the	c
air	c
.	c

To	c
summarize	c
,	c
the	c
modern	c
technologies	c
give	c
and	i
permit	i
you	c
may	i
things	c
wich	i
would	c
be	c
impossible	c
in	c
other	i
times	i
but	c
also	c
gives	i
you	i
many	c
problems	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
the	c
starring	c
actor	c
was	c
different	c
from	c
the	c
one	c
who	c
had	c
been	c
mentioned	c
on	i
the	c
advertisement	c
for	c
this	c
musical	c
show	c
as	c
"	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
"	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
,	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
the	c
reason	c
why	c
the	c
actor	c
was	c
changed	i
.	c

As	i
the	i
third	c
point	c
,	i
our	c
tickets	c
were	c
not	c
discounted	i
at	c
all	c
!	c

The	c
Ad	i
.	i

says	c
that	c
TICKETS	i
:	i
Discounts	i
Available	i
.	c

Lastly	c
,	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
had	i
been	i
closed	i
already	i
when	c
the	c
show	c
was	i
finished	i
,	c
because	c
the	c
time	i
of	i
begining	i
of	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
late	c
.	c

As	c
above	i
mentioned	i
,	c
it	c
can	i
not	i
be	c
a	c
"	c
perfect	c
evening	c
"	c
.	c

There	c
are	c
lots	c
of	c
reasons	c
why	c
I	c
was	c
so	c
disappointed	c
,	c
and	c
could	c
not	c
enjoy	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
you	c
see	c
!	c
!	c

Therefore	c
,	c
would	i
be	c
grateful	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
give	c
me	c
back	c
some	c
money	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

How	c
foolish	c
!	c

Considering	c
her	c
loneliness	c
,	c
we	c
made	c
every	c
effort	c
to	c
please	c
her	c
and	c
to	c
encourage	c
her	c
;	c
because	c
she	c
was	c
loved	c
by	c
everybody	c
for	c
her	c
gentle	c
,	c
kind	c
and	c
lovely	c
character	c
.	c

She	c
was	c
not	c
so	c
lucky	c
in	c
her	c
life	c
.	c

Her	c
parents	c
already	i
died	i
when	c
she	c
was	c
in	c
the	i
high-school	i
.	c

On	c
June	c
2	c
,	c
because	c
of	c
Pat	c
's	c
fault	i
,	c
Sally	c
already	c
knew	c
our	c
plan	c
.	c

We	c
were	c
enjoying	c
at	i
home	i
celebrating	c
her	c
birthday	c
.	c

"	c
Oh	c
!	c

You	c
came	c
back	c
for	c
me	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

The	i
last	i
week	c
I	c
have	i
been	i
to	c
London	c
for	c
a	c
holiday	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
advertisement	c
you	c
told	c
me	c
I	c
would	c
have	i
discounts	i
.	c

This	c
was	c
not	c
the	c
worst	c
thing	c
because	c
when	c
I	c
arrived	c
at	c
the	c
theatre	c
I	c
was	i
waiting	i
fourty	i
five	i
minutes	c
because	c
the	c
show	c
should	c
start	c
at	c
19:30	c
and	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
when	c
the	c
main	c
actor	c
can	i
not	i
do	c
the	c
show	c
it	c
is	c
better	c
not	c
do	i
the	c
show	c
than	c
do	i
it	c
with	c
a	c
horrible	c
actor	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
you	c
should	c
refuse	i
my	c
money	c
because	c
the	c
evening	c
and	c
the	c
show	c
were	c
so	c
terrible	c
.	c

Your	i
faithfully	c

When	c
Sally	c
came	c
out	c
the	i
dyscotheque	i
I	c
was	c
very	c
nervous	i
and	c
I	c
started	c
to	c
shout	c
her	i
.	c

Paul	c
ask	i
Pat	c
what	c
had	c
happened	c
and	c
she	c
told	c
him	c
my	c
secret	c
.	c

One	c
friend	c
of	c
mine	c
told	c
me	c
that	c
Pat	c
had	c
told	c
Paul	c
my	c
secret	c
and	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
speak	c
with	c
her	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
organizing	c
this	c
trip	c
to	c
London	c
,	c
and	c
for	c
taking	c
care	c
of	c
the	c
programme	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
we	c
saw	c
an	c
advertisement	c
,	c
and	c
we	c
are	c
keen	c
on	c
the	c
idea	c
of	c
going	c
to	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
dangerous	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
knew	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
listen	i
the	c
crowd	c
shouting	c
'	c
Go	c
,	c
Go	i
'	c
.	c

That	c
was	c
my	c
only	c
chance.	c
.	i

The	c
clock	c
was	c
running.	c

tic	i
,	c

...	c

Fortunatelly	i
,	c
I	c
was	c
n't	c
alone	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
the	c
good	c
programme	c
you	c
organised	i
for	c
our	c
trip	c
to	c
London	c
.	c

But	c
we	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
suggest	i
you	i
something	i
:	c
There	i
is	c
a	c
trendy	c
event	c
about	c
the	c
latest	c
fashions	c
,	c
leisure	c
and	c
sports	c
wear	c
;	i
make	i
up	i
and	c
hairstyles	c
on	i
the	c
14th	c
of	c
March	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
called	c
,,The	i
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show.	c
"	c

This	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
because	i
we	c
are	c
all	c
intrested	i
in	c
clothes	c
,	c
sports	c
and	c
fashion	c
.	c

I	c
have	i
almost	i
forgotten	i
to	c
mention	c
that	c
it	c
is	c
free	c
for	c
students	c
!	c

The	c
show	c
lasts	c
nine	c
hours	c
,	c
from	c
10.00-19.00	c
,	c
the	c
whole	c
day	c
!	c

We	c
could	c
maybe	c
change	c
Tuesday	c
's	c
programme	c
to	c
Wednesday	c
.	c

Thanks	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	i

Therefore	c
I	c
read	c
Agatha	c
Christie	c
's	c
,,Best	i
Detective	c
Stories	c
of	c
Agatha	c
Christie	c
"	c
.	c

I	c
can	c
really	c
recommend	i
you	i
this	i
book	i
,	i
it	i
is	c
fabulous	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
also	c
a	c
suitable	c
present	c
for	c
your	c
cousin	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
.	c

One	c
story	c
is	c
about	c
ten	c
persons	i
who	c
stay	c
together	c
in	c
a	c
hotel	c
on	c
a	c
lonely	c
island	c
.	c

There	c
is	c
a	c
storm	c
and	c
they	c
can	i
not	i
leave	c
.	c

There	c
is	c
also	c
Hercule	c
Poirot	c
,	c
the	c
famous	c
detective	c
and	i
he	c
finally	c
solves	c
the	c
mistery	i
.	c

Unfortunately	c
it	c
is	c
quite	c
expensive	c
,	c
£	c
32	c
.	c

But	c
do	c
not	c
worry	c
about	c
the	c
price	c
because	c
your	c
cousin	c
will	c
love	c
it	c
!	c

Have	c
a	c
good	c
time	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Dear	c
Mr	c

The	c
thing	c
is	c
that	c

The	c
Home	c

the	c
Future	c

Dear	c
Reader	c
,	c

I	c
have	c
decided	c
to	c
describe	c
my	c
home	c
of	c
the	c
future	c
or	c
,	c
in	c
other	c
words	c
,	c
the	c
place	c
where	c
people	c
will	c
live	c
in	c
100	c
years	c
.	c

Well	c
,	c
I	c
suppose	c
that	c
almost	c
everything	c
in	c
future	i
house	c
will	c
be	c
automatic	c
and	c
will	c
obey	i
to	c
what	c
people	c
say	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
they	c
will	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
create	c
a	c
special	c
climate	c
for	c
each	c
room	c
.	c

All	c
the	c
rubbish	c
,	c
dust	c
,	c
dirty	c
dishes	c
,	c
plates	c
,	c
caps	i
will	c
be	c
washed	i
and	i
cleaned	i
automaticly	i
.	c

It	c
is	c
possible	c
that	c
only	c
one	c
computer	c
will	c
do	c
this	i
all	i
and	c
it	c
will	c
have	c
its	c
own	c
personality	c
,	c
voice	c
,	c
eyesight.	c
.	c

This	c
will	c
be	c
your	c
home	c
,	c
another	c
member	c
of	c
your	c
family	c
and	c
your	c
house	c
or	c
flat	c
together	i

AS	c
IF	c
THIS	c
WERE	c
NOT	c
ENOUGH	c
,	c
I	c
DID	c
NOT	c
OBTAIN	c
A	c
DISCOUNT	c
IN	i
THE	c
PRICE	c
OF	c
THE	c
TICKET	c
,	c
ALTHOUGH	c
THIS	c
WAS	c
POSSIBLE	c
ACCORDING	c
TO	c
YOUR	c

ON	c
TOP	c
OF	c
EVERYTHING	c
,	c
I	c
COULD	c
NOT	c
VISIT	c
THE	c
RESTAURANT	c
OF	i
THIS	c
PLACE	c
,	c
BECAUSE	c
IT	c
WAS	c
CLOSED	c
AFTER	c
THE	c

I	c
AM	c
VERY	c
DISAPPOINTED	c
,	c
BECAUSE	c
THAT	c

OUT	c
WAS	c
NOT	c
PERFECT	i
AS	c
I	c
HAD	c

BEEN	c
INVENTED	c
AND	c
THE	i

AS	c
A	c

OF	c
THIS	c
PEOPLE	c
'S	c
DAILY	c
LIFE	i
HAS	i
BEEN	c
CHANGING	c
AS	c

IN	c
THE	c

WAY	c
,	c
WE	c
CAN	c
TRAVEL	c
INSIDE	c
OUR	c
COUNTRY	c
QUICKLY	c
AND	c
SAFELY	c
.	c

FINALLY	c
,	c
WE	c
CAN	i
CONSIDER	c
,	c
TOO	c
,	c
THAT	c
THE	i
TECHNOLOGY	c
HAS	c
BEEN	c
PROVIDING	c
US	c
WITH	c
IMPORTANT	c
DISCOVERIES	c

MAINLY	c
IN	c

Dear	i
Sir/Manager	i
,	c

During	c
my	c
visit	c
to	c
London	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
the	c
opportunity	c
to	c
visit	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
and	c
to	c
see	c
'	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
'	c
.	c

To	c
my	c
dismay	c
the	c
musical	c
was	c
nothing	c
compared	c
to	c
what	c
I	c
had	c
expected	c
,	c
as	c
it	c
completely	c
contradicted	c
to	i
the	c
advertisement	c
.	c

However	c
by	i
the	c
time	c
the	c
show	c
had	c
ended	c
the	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
,	c
as	i
a	i
way	i
of	i
compensation	i
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
refund	c
,	c
and	c
justification	i
for	c
such	i
a	i
show	i
.	c

Yours	c
Sincerely	i
,	c

How	c
has	c
modern	c
technology	c
change	i
your	c
daily	c
life	c
?	c

The	c
invention	c
of	c
cars	c
planes	i
,	c
trains	c
and	c
other	c
similar	c
forms	c
of	c
transportation	c
have	i
enabled	c
us	c
to	c
go	c
from	c
one	c
place	c
to	c
another	c
with	i
no	i
time	i
.	c

This	c
compared	i
to	c
the	c
traditional	c
bicycle	c
is	i
less	c
physically	c
painstaking	i
and	c
less	c
time	i
consuming	i
and	c
therefore	c
lets	c
me	c
travel	c
to	c
my	c
destination	c
in	i
small	i
amount	i
of	i
time	i
with	c
hardly	c
no	i
effort	c
at	c
all	c
.	c

Another	c
significant	c
technological	c
developement	i
is	c
the	c
creation	i
of	c
electrical	c
appliances	c
.	c

What	c
changed	c
my	c
life	c
most	c
is	i
portal	c
computers	c
.	c

Before	c
I	c
used	c
computers	c
generally	i
,	c
It	i
took	c
so	c
much	c
time	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
looking	i
up	c
words	c
in	c
a	c
dictionary	c
and	c
looking	i
up	c
for	i
information	c
.	c

However	c
if	i
we	c
rely	c
on	c
it	c
too	c
much	c
,	c
we	c
could	c
become	c
lazy	c
and	c
apathetic	c
and	c
as	i
a	c
result	c
,	c
would	i
not	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
live	c
without	c
them	i
once	c
they	i
are	i
gone	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
telling	c
me	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
and	c
now	c
I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
tell	i
you	c
the	c
information	c
you	c
have	c
requested	c
.	c

Then	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
choose	c
the	c
tents	c
for	c
my	c
accommodation	c
when	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
sleeping	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
is	c
funnier	i
than	c
others	i
.	i

And	c
the	i
other	c
one	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
painting	c
will	c
be	c
a	c
good	c
idea	c
;	c
Painting	i
is	c
one	c
of	c
my	c
hobbies	c
and	c
I	c
've	c
been	c
learning	i
it	c
since	c
I	c
was	c
5	c
years	c
old	c
and	c
now	c
I	c
'm	c
still	c
doing	c
it	c
once	i
I	c
have	c
free	i
time	c
.	c

Above	c
are	i
all	c
the	c
information	c
you	c
asked	c
,	i
however	i
,	c
here	i
are	c
something	i
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
;	c
first	i
is	c
about	c
the	c
clothes	c
,	i
what	i
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	i
need	c
to	c
take	c
with	c
?	i

And	c
another	c
question	c
is	c
what	c
is	i
the	c
prices	c
of	c
things	c
like	c
in	i
there	c
,	c
so	i
that	c
I	c
can	c
make	c
a	c
better	c
buget	i
of	i
my	c
trip	c
.	c

Look	i
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
:	c

The	c
place	c
we	i
worked	c
was	c
a	c
football	c
pitch	c
;	c
we	c
spent	c
3	c
days	c
on	i
setting	c
up	c
the	c
stage	c
,	c
the	c
equitment	i
,	c
and	c
the	c
lights	c
.	c

In	c
fact	c
,	c
there	c
is	i
nothing	c
very	c
important	c
I	c
did	c
,	c
because	c
we	c
are	i
not	c
the	c
right	c
people	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
only	c
put	c
the	c
speakers	c
in	c
the	c
right	c
places	c
,	c
or	c
helping	i
engieners	i
tested	i
the	c
lights	c
.	c

Then	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
chance	c
to	c
speak	c
with	c
them	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
the	c
date	i
of	c
concer	i
came	c
.	c

After	c
the	c
concer	i
finished	c
successfully	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
happier	c
than	c
ever	c
because	c
the	c
succeed	i
inclueded	i
my	c
work	c
and	c
that	c
was	c
the	c
most	c
enjoyable	c
moment	c
in	c
my	c
life	c
.	c

Anyway	c
,	c
now	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
stop	c
to	c
finish	c
my	c
homework	c
.	c

Best	c
wishes	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
I	i
was	c
expecting	c
to	c
see	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
starring	i
but	c
I	c
felt	c
very	c
disappointed	c
when	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
appeared	c
.	c

Then	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
buying	c
my	c
ticket	c
I	c
asked	c
for	c
discount	i

they	c
were	c

yours	c

Comparing	c

changed	i
very	i
much	i
our	i
daily	i
life	i

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c

I	c
am	c
replying	c
in	i
response	i
of	i
the	i
competition	i
I	i
won	i
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
on	i
July	c
,	c
because	c
during	i
the	c
other	c
months	c
,	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
studying	c
,	c
preparing	c
myself	c
for	c
other	i
exams	c
or	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
out	i
travelling	c
somewhere	c
else	c
with	c
my	c
relatives	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
been	c
thinking	c
and	c
I	c
decided	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
tents	i
,	c
simply	c
because	c
it	c
's	c
a	c
new	c
experience	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
try	c
everything	c
new	c
.	c

For	i
the	c
two	c
activities	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
choose	c
,	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
choose	c
a	c
new	c
activitie	i
that	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
done	c
before	c
,	c
which	c
is	c
Sailing	c
,	i
so	i
I	c
am	c
a	c
totally	i
begginer	i
at	c
this	c
.	c

Is	c
there	c
any	c
place	c
that	i
I	c
can	c
wash	c
my	c
clothes	c
?	c

Do	c
you	c
have	c
any	c
kind	c
of	c
souvenirs	c
that	c
I	c
can	c
buy	c
?	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

I	c
'm	c
sorry	c
it	c
took	c
so	c
long	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
answer	c
your	c
letter	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
've	c
been	c
too	c
busy	c
with	c
my	c
school	c
,	c
papers	c
and	c
everything	c
.	c

There	c
were	c
about	c
a	c
hundred	c
people	c
that	c
wanted	c
to	c
help	c
,	c
but	c
only	c
two	c
would	c
be	c
chosen	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
arrived	c
to	c
help	c
them	c
,	c
they	c
welcomed	c
me	c
and	c
were	c
so	c
nice	c
with	i
me	c
that	c
it	c
seemed	c
we	c
had	c
known	c
each	c
others	i
in	i
ages	c
!	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
exactly	c
how	c
I	c
felt	c
,	i
sometimes	i
I	c
wake	c
up	c
and	c
think	c
it	c
was	c
nothing	c
but	c
a	c
dream	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
liked	c
everything	c
I	c
said	c
and	c
I	c
hope	c
an	i
answer	i
as	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
services	c
that	c
you	c
are	c
offering	c
during	i
the	c
shows	c
at	c
your	c
theatre	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
that	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
forty	i
five	i
minutes	c
later	i
.	c

In	i
order	i
to	c
the	c
tickets	c
,	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
they	c
are	c
very	c
expensive	c
.	c

To	c
sum	i
up	i
,	c
the	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c

Looking	i
for	c
your	c
repley	i

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
not	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c

That	c
is	c
why	c
she	c
could	c
no	i
be	c
a	c
spy	c

Her	c
mother	c
gave	c
a	i
book	c
about	i
how	i
to	i
become	i
a	i
spy	i
for	i
her	i

She	c
had	c
watched	c
all	c
Mission	i
Impossible	c
and	c

the	c
inspector	c

But	c
things	c
changed	c

discover	c
how	c
some	c
people	c
from	c
government	i
gave	c
money	c
to	c

Dear	c
Ms	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
pleased	c
about	c
the	c
prize	c
I	c
just	c
won	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
choosing	c
me	c
.	c

As	c
my	c
family	c
's	c
new	c
restaurant	c
is	c
about	c
to	c
open	c
in	c
August	c
,	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
help	c
with	c
the	c
restaurant	c
,	c
which	c
is	c
expected	c
to	c
be	c
rather	c
busy	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
terribly	i
attacked	c
by	c
a	c
been	i
and	c
it	c
still	c
gives	c
me	c
nightmares	c
!	c

I	c
spend	c
one	c
third	c
of	c
my	c
spare	c
time	c
playing	c
basketball	c
.	c

As	c
a	c
result	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
an	c
important	c
position	c
in	c
our	c
local	c
basketball	c
team	c
.	c

How	c
much	c
money	c
is	c
appropriate	i
to	c
carry	i
?	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

I	c
really	c
wish	c
you	c
were	i
there	c
with	c
me	c
at	i
that	i
one	c
of	c
the	c
exciting	c
nights	c
in	c
my	c
life	c
.	c

Now	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
wait	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
every	c
detail	c
.	c

A	c
few	c
minutes	c
after	c
the	c
concert	c
began	c
,	c
a	c
backstage	c
assistant	c
called	c
in	c
sick	c
who	c
was	c
responsible	c
for	c
checking	c
wether	i
everything	c
is	i
going	c
well	c
according	c
to	c
the	c
timetable	c
,	i
if	i
something	c
comes	c
up	c
,	c
she	c
should	c
inform	c
other	i
staff	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
then	c
taken	c
in	i
to	c
cover	c
her	c
job	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
given	c
lots	c
of	c
paper	c
with	c
many	c
different	c
time	i
on	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
did	c
manage	c
to	c
"	c
study	c
"	c
them	c
though	c
,	c
thanks	c
to	c
other	i
staff	c
.	c

They	c
were	c
very	c
helpful	c
and	c
nice	c
.	c

I	c
saw	c
all	c
the	c
members	c
of	c
the	c
band	c
backstage	c
,	c
how	c
did	i
they	c
change	i
their	c
make-up	c
,	c
hairstyle	c
etc.	c
They	c
were	c
even	c
talking	i
jokes	c
with	c
me	c
and	c
other	c
staff	c
.	c

Indeed	c
,	c
they	c
can	i
not	i
succeed	c
without	c
their	c
help	c
,	c
can	c
they	c
?	c

I	c
was	c
lucky	c
to	c
have	c
this	c
chance	c
and	c
able	c
to	c
know	i
how	c
they	c
work	c
behind	c
the	c
scene	i
.	c

All	c
in	c
all	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
once-a-lifetime	i
experience	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
named	c
OVER	c
THE	c
RAINBOW	c
.	c

Regarding	i
your	c
advertisement	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
the	i
LONDON	c
'S	c
NEWEST	c
AND	c
BEST	c
MUSICAL	c
SHOW	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
was	c
deeply	c
disappointed	c
at	i
it	c
.	c

According	c
to	c
your	c
advertisement	c
,	c
the	c
starrings	i
were	c
DANNY	c
BROOK	c
AND	c
TINA	c
TRUELOVE	c
.	c

I	c
decided	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
see	c
this	c
show	c
because	c
of	c
its	c
starrings	i
,	c
but	c
at	i
the	c
day	c
I	c
saw	c
it	c
,	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
played	i
.	c

He	c
was	c
not	c
DANNY	c
BROOK	c
.	c

Moreover	c
there	c
was	i
no	c
discount	c
ticket	i
.	c

I	c
had	c
to	c
buy	c
a	c
£	c
20	c
ticket	c
.	c

To	c
make	c
matters	c
worse	c
,	c
the	c
time	i
that	i
the	i
show	i
started	i
was	i
delayed	i
.	c

It	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
,	c
fourty	i
five	i
minutes	c
later	i
!	c

That	c
's	c
why	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
have	c
a	i
dinner	c
at	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

It	c
had	c
already	c
closed	c
,	i
when	c
the	c
show	c
finished	c

yours	c
faithfully	c

Modern	c
technology	c
has	c
changed	c
my	c
life	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
only	c
two	c
or	c
three	c
years	c
since	c
I	c
have	i
used	i
a	c
computer	c
at	c
home	c
,	c
but	c
now	c
I	c
wonder	c
how	c
I	c
can	i
live	c
without	c
it	i
.	c

I	c
open	c
my	c
e-mail	i
box	i
every	c
night	c
.	c

However	c
I	i
've	c
found	c
e-mail	c
is	c
better	c
than	c
them	i
.	c

In	i
the	i
other	i
word	i
,	c
I	c
can	c
also	c
receive	c
their	c
reply	c
soon	i
.	c

Overmore	i
when	c
I	c
send	c
e-mail	c
,	c
I	c
need	i
not	i
worry	i
about	c
the	c
time	c
.	c

Thanks	c
to	c
modern	c
technology	c
,	c
I	c
enjoy	c
chatting	c
with	c
my	c
friend	i
in	c
other	c
countries	c
and	c
my	c
family	c
in	c
Japan	c
almost	c
every	c
day	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
happy	c
to	c
hear	c
that	c
I	c
've	c
won	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
.	c

As	c
for	c
accomodation	i
I	i
would	c
prefer	c
log	c
cabins	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
belive	i
they	c
are	c
more	c
comfortable	c
then	i
tents	c
.	c

I	c
never	i
tried	i
those	c
sports	c
,	c
because	c
they	c
are	c
quite	c
expensive	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
two	c
questions	c
.	c

Am	c
I	c
supposed	c
to	c
take	c
an	c
outfit	c
for	c
sports	c
as	c
well	c
?	c

The	c
other	c
question	c
is	c
about	c
money	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Some	c
people	c
may	c
think	c
that	c
school	c
is	c
boring	c
and	c
nothing	c
interesting	c
ever	c
happens	c
there	c
.	c

The	c
chemistry	c
lesson	c
should	c
be	c
filmed	c
because	c
we	c
do	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
interesting	c
experiments	c
there	c
.	c

As	c
for	c
other	c
activities	c
,	c
there	c
is	c
a	c
Jiu-Jitsu	c
class	c
after	c
regular	c
lessons	c
.	c

Martial	c
arts	c
are	c
realy	i
exciting	c
and	c
are	c
a	c
great	c
thing	c
to	c
film	c

to	c
your	c
advertisement	c
it	c
was	i
at	c
19:30	c

and	c
,	i
what	c
a	c
surprise	c
when	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
wait	c
almost	c
an	c
hour	c
until	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
!	c

You	c
had	c
promised	c
discounts	c
on	c
the	c
cost	c
which	i
was	c
from	c
£	c
10	c
to	c
£	c
20	c
,	c
but	c
despite	c
my	i
thoughts	i
I	c
had	c
to	c

THE	c
OLD	c
MAN	c
AND	c
THE	c
SEA	c

Ernest	c
Hemingway	c

As	c
I	c
see	c
it	c
,	c
the	c
Old	c
Man	c
and	c
the	c
Sea	c
is	c
a	c
really	c
exiting	i
book	c

It	c
describes	c
a	c
challenge	c
,	c
the	c
challenge	c
of	c
life	c

The	c
major	i

is	c
the	c
old	c
man	c
who	c
has	c
to	c
fight	c
against	c
the	c
sea	c
to	c
keep	i
alive	c

By	c
surprise	c
he	c
comes	c
across	c
the	c
biggest	c
fish	c
he	c
has	c
ever	c
seen	c
,	c
a	c
beautiful	c
marlin	c

I	c
think	c
they	c
're	c
really	c
brothers	c
,	c
they	c
feel	c
the	c
same	c
pain	c
and	c
fear	c
during	c
the	c
battle	c

If	c
the	c
marlin	c
could	c

would	c
have	c
told	c

Dear	c

and	c
I	c

Although	c
the	i
photography	c

not	c
as	c
good	c
as	c
the	i
singing	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
very	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
,	i
sometimes	i
have	i
a	c
long	c
quare	i
or	c
a	c
mechine	i
was	i
broken	c
.	c

A	c
lot	c
of	c
circumsenses	i
will	c
have	i
been	i
happening	i
.	c

It	c
was	c
in	i
lunch	i
time	i
.	c

I	c
was	c
quare	i
in	i
the	i
middle	i
of	i
row	i
.	c

I	c
choose	i
this	c
row	i
because	c
I	c
though	i
it	c
was	c
quicker	c
than	c
other	i
.	c

Although	i
there	i
were	i
finished	i
two	i
people	i
,	i
next	i
was	i

,	i
something	i

The	c

it	c

Abviously	i
,	c
I	c
have	i
to	c
chance	i
other	i

Shopping	c
would	i
be	i
enjoyable	c
,	c
if	c
you	c
were	i
good	i
luck	i
.	c

Even	c
though	c
I	c
think	c
it	i
most	i
of	i
time	i
is	c
very	c
interesting	c
,	c
sometimes	c
make	i
people	c
upsent	i
.	c

Dear	c
Jane	c
Clark	c
,	c

Firstly	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
good	c
idea	c
that	c
the	c
Festival	c
is	c
International	i
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
the	c
classical	c
concerts	c
were	c
excellent	c
and	i
the	c
halls	c
were	c
so	c
crowded	c
that	c
nobody	c
could	c
walk	c
.	c

Thirdly	c
,	c
I	c
noticed	c
that	c
the	c
plays	c
and	c
the	c
films	c
were	c
a	i
good	c
entertainment	c
.	c

It	i
attracted	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
people	c
and	c
they	c
were	c
really	c
joyous	i
after	c
that	c
.	c

I	c
also	c
think	c
that	c
you	c
should	c
put	i
a	c
Snack-Bar	i
or	c
a	c
little	c
restaurant	c
so	c
as	i
the	c
people	c
are	c
not	c
too	c
hangry	i
and	c
morever	i
you	c
can	c
realise	i
big	i
benefits	i

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
in	i
the	c
whole	c
the	c
Festival	c
was	c
a	c
success	c
,	c
but	c
these	c
suggestions	c
can	c
maybe	c
help	c
you	c
to	c
improve	c
.	i

Dear	c
Andrew	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
happy	c
to	c
hearing	i
from	c
you	c
and	c
I	c
hope	c
that	c
you	c
are	c
fit	i
.	c

As	i
expected	i
,	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
talk	c
at	i
first	i
about	c
my	c
school	c
and	c
then	c
about	c
my	c
home	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
know	c
,	c
I	c
finished	c
school	c
two	c
years	c
ago	c
.	c

So	c
the	c
rules	c
are	c
clear	c
,	c
you	c
need	c
to	c
participate	c
to	i
the	c
lessons	c
and	c
also	c
be	i
successful	i
at	i
the	c
exam	c
of	i
June	c
2000	c
.	c

In	c
our	c
class	c
,	c
we	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
problem	i
with	c
students	c
who	c
dislike	c
to	i
work	i
,	c
because	c
we	c
are	c
all	c
there	c
for	c
the	c
same	c
reasons	c
and	c
nobody	c
wants	c
to	c
say	i
there	c
years	i
and	c
years	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
also	c
expensive	c
and	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
afford	c
to	c
stay	c
there	c
too	c
long	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
sweet	i
home	c
,	c
my	c
parents	c
let	c
me	c
do	c
what	c
I	c
want	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
an	c
adult	c
now	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
the	c
same	c
in	c
our	c
family	i
and	i
for	i
example	c
my	i
parents	c
dislike	c
hearing	c
music	c
in	i
the	c
whole	c
house	c
or	i
that	i
I	i
let	i
dust	i
everywhere	i
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
want	c
to	c
change	c
something	i
in	c
my	c
house	c
or	c
at	c
school	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
totaly	i
agree	c
with	c
the	c
few	c
rules	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
these	c
few	c
information	i
can	c
help	c
you	c
and	c
I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
with	c
reference	c
to	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
musical	i
show	c
which	i
I	c
went	c
to	c
see	c
at	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
last	c
night	c
.	c

Being	c
a	c
theatre	c
lover	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
always	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
seeing	c
new	c
musicals	c
,	c
but	c
unfortunately	c
,	c
this	c
particular	c
one	c
was	c
very	c
disappointing	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
was	c
not	c
starring	c
,	c
even	c
it	i
was	c
stated	c
in	c
your	c
advertisement	c
,	i
but	c
the	c
main	c
role	c
was	c
played	c
by	c
an	c
unknown	c
actor	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
wait	c
for	c
forty	i
five	i
minutes	c
for	c
the	c
show	c
to	c
start	c
,	c
and	c
it	c
was	c
20:15	c
(	c
not	c
19:30	c
)	c
when	c
the	c
curtain	c
went	c
up	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
can	c
see	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
very	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
-	c
the	c
worst	c
one	c
during	i
my	c
week	c
's	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

to	c

Let	c

to	c
imagine	c

what	c
will	i

There	c
will	c
be	c

different	c
times	c
of	i
the	c
past	c
,	c
so	c
if	c
you	c
feel	c
like	c
a	c
medieval	c
princess	c
,	c
you	c
can	c
dress	c
like	c
one	c
.	c

A	i
new	i
technology	c
and	c
science	c
will	c
change	c
fabrics	c
,	c
so	c
they	c
will	c
change	c
their	c
colour	i
during	c
the	c
day	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
future	c
people	c
will	c
be	c
even	c
more	c
concerned	c
with	i
pollutions	i
and	c
harmful	c
UV-rays	c
.	c

So	c
their	c
clothes	c
will	c
have	c
built-in	c
protective	c
filters	c
to	c
help	c
them	c
keep	c
healthy	c
.	c

With	c
so	c
many	c
choices	c
shopping	i
for	c
clothes	c
is	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
even	c
greater	i
fun	c
than	c
it	c
is	c
now	c
.	c

Fashion	i
of	c
the	c
future	c
will	c
not	c
be	c
the	c
same	c
as	c
today	c
's	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
more	c
exciting	c
and	c
fun	c
!	c

I	c
am	c
glad	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c

You	c
ask	c
me	c
in	c
your	c
letter	c
when	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
.	c

The	c
answer	c
is	c
the	c
following	c
one	c
:	c
I	c
only	i
can	i
travel	c
July	i
because	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
work	c
all	c
August	c
.	c

I	c
prefer	c
the	c
tents	c
because	c
I	c
never	c
use	c
such	i
kind	c
of	c
accommodation	c
.	c

I	c
love	c
water	c
but	c
I	c
never	i
try	i
this	c
sport	c
before	c
.	c

How	c
much	c
money	c
do	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
with	c
me	c
for	c
these	c
two	c
weeks	c
and	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
do	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
bring	c
with	c
me	c
?	c

I	c
'll	c
be	c
very	c
happy	c
to	c
see	c
you	c
soon	c

Yours	c
sincerly	i

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
because	c
of	c
different	c
problems	c
.	c

The	c
second	c
thing	c
is	c
that	c
you	c
need	c
to	c
go	c
shopping	c
when	c
the	c
supermarkets	c
are	c
open	c
.	c

Everybody	c
do	i
their	c
shopping	c
at	c
the	c
same	c
moment	i
and	c
often	c
in	c
the	c
same	c
place	c
.	c

People	c
are	c
often	c
nervous	i
and	c
agressive	i
.	c

Sometimes	c
you	c
can	c
see	c
fights	c
between	c
two	c
men	c
or	c
women	c
.	c

There	c
is	c
one	c
more	c
thing	c
.	c

When	c
you	c
are	c
a	c
man	c
and	c
your	c
wife	c
asks	c
you	c
to	c
come	i
for	i
shopping	c
,	c
be	c
patient	c
!	c

Because	c
women	c
loves	i
shopping	c
and	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
follow	c
them	c
everywhere	c
and	c
always	c
giving	i
your	c
opinion	c
about	c
clothes	c
,	c
music	c
,	c
parfums	i
...	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
:	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
the	c
information	c
it	i
was	c
ask	i
in	c
the	c
letter	c
you	c
had	i
sent	i
me	c
.	c

Secondly	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
sleeping	c
in	c
log	i
cabins	i
because	c
I	c
fell	i
much	c
more	c
comfortable	c
.	c

One	c
reason	c
is	c
the	c
cold	c
,	c
and	c
the	c
other	c
is	c
that	c
I	c
cannot	c
sleep	c
on	c
the	c
floor	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
problems	c
in	i
my	c
back	c
.	c

The	c
first	c
one	c
because	c
I	c
think	c
I	c
am	c
good	c
at	c
it	c
and	c
also	c
I	c
love	c
singing	c
loudly	c
with	c
other	c
people	c
.	c

The	c
last	c
one	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
tried	c
it	i
but	c
I	c
think	c
I	c
can	i
do	i
it	c
well	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
tall	c
and	c
that	c
could	c
make	c
things	c
easier	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

your	i
sincerily	i

Dear	c
Kim	c
:	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
wonderful	c
experience	c
but	c
at	c
the	c
same	c
time	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
work	c
very	c
hard	c
.	c

The	c
things	c
I	c
did	c
were	c
:	c
Prepearing	i
and	c
controling	i
the	c
equipment	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
clean	c
all	c
the	c
stadium	c
,	c
make	i
sure	c
that	c
all	c
the	c
lights	c
were	c
in	c
perfect	c
condition	i
,	c
that	c
the	c
singers	c
were	c
confortable	i
and	c
relaxed	c
,	c
etc	c
.	c

The	c
most	c
exciting	c
thing	c
was	c
talking	c
with	c
the	c
band	c
,	c
asking	i
questions	i
to	i
them	i
and	c
of	c
course	c
listening	c
the	i
music	c
and	c
enjoying	c
the	c
incredible	c
show	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
the	c
most	c
exciting	c
experience	c
I	c
've	c
ever	c
had	c
in	c
my	c
life	c
.	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

It	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
great	c
plessure	i
to	c
spend	c
two	c
weeks	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
and	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
find	c
any	c
suitable	c
words	c
to	c
express	c
my	c
enthusiasm	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
as	c
a	c
reply	c
for	i
your	c
letter	c
,	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
say	c
,	c
that	c
I	c
can	c
only	c
go	c
on	c
this	c
camp	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
a	c
full-time	c
job	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
essential	c
not	c
to	c
leave	c
it	c
for	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
.	c

In	c
July	c
I	c
can	c
make	c
an	c
exception	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
mind	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
some	c
vital	c
questions	c
.	c

Do	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
warm	c
clothes	c
?	c

How	c
much	c
money	c
would	c
you	c
recommend	c
me	c
to	c
take	c
?	c

I	c
would	c
appreciate	c
if	i
you	c
send	i
me	c
a	c
reply	c
for	i
my	c
Questions	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c

,,Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
"	c
.	c

From	c
my	c
point	c
of	c
view	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
very	c
controversial	c
issue	c
,	c
and	c
we	c
ca	c
n't	c
just	c
easily	c
claim	c
whether	c
it	c
is	c
enjoyable	c
or	c
not	c
.	c

Some	c
people	c
do	c
n't	c
like	c
doing	c
shopping	c
at	c
all	c
and	c
they	c
can	c
well	c
explain	c
to	c
everyone	c
why	c
it	c
is	c
n't	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

Luckily	c
,	c
I	c
'm	c
one	c
of	c
these	c
people	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
shopping	c
is	c
a	c
waste	c
of	c
time	c
.	c

During	c
the	c
rush	c
hour	c
,	c
shopping	c
is	c
almost	c
impossible	c
due	c
to	c
big	c
queues	c
in	c
every	c
single	c
shop	c
in	c
the	c
nearby	c
area	c
.	c

I	c
just	c
ca	c
n't	c
understand	c
people	c
who	c
with	i
smile	i
on	c
their	c
faces	c
spend	i
their	c
last	c
money	c
on	c
unnecessary	c
but	c
expensive	c
things	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
as	c
a	c
conlusion	i
,	c
I	c
might	c
say	c
that	c
shopping	c
is	c
n't	c
enjoyable	c
at	c
all	c
and	c
I	c
'd	c
rather	c
stay	c
at	c
home	c
instead	c
.	c

Dear	c
Manager	c
of	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c

I	c
recently	c
had	c
a	c
week	c
's	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

During	c
my	c
stay	c
,	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
to	c
see	c
your	c
musical	c
show	c
called	c
'	c
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
'	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
actually	c
very	c
disappointing	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
I	c
want	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
as	c
you	c
said	c
'	c
your	c
pefect	c
evening	c
'	c
out	c
in	c
your	c
advertisement	c
and	c
I	c
rally	i
do	c
think	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
the	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
disappointed	c
.	c

It	c
says	c
that	c
the	c
show	c
starts	c
at	c
14:30	c
and	c
19:30	c
but	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
which	c
was	c
45	c
minutes	c
late	c
.	c

The	c
price	c
of	c
ticket	i
was	c
another	c
problem	c
.	c

Your	c
advertisement	c
says	c
'	c
discounts	c
available	c
'	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
available	c
.	c

Yours	c

Lun	c

My	c
daily	c
life	c
also	c
got	i
affected	c
by	c
modern	c
technology	c
a	c
lot	c
.	c

I	c
can	c
do	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
things	c
using	c
the	c
computer	c
.	c

The	c
main	c
advantage	c
of	c
modern	c
technology	c
is	c
getting	c
more	c
informations	i
in	c
shorter	i
time	c
.	c

I	c
can	c
go	c
on	c
internet	i
in	c
my	c
house	c
using	c
computers	c
or	c
from	c
outside	c
using	c
mobile	c
phones	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
library	i
and	c
read	c
hundred	i
's	i
of	c
books	c
to	c
find	c
informations	i
anymore	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
TV	c
's	c
and	c
radios	c
so	c
I	c
can	c
watch	c
or	c
listen	c
to	c
various	c
newses	i
and	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
football	c
pitches	i
to	c
see	c
how	c
the	c
players	c
are	c
playing	c
.	c

Nowadays	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
too	c
easy	c
to	c
get	c
lazy	c
because	c
of	c
modern	c
technology	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
not	c
have	c
to	c
walk	c
or	c
run	c
a	c
lot	c
to	c
go	c
somewhere	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
modern	c
techonology	c
has	c
changed	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
a	c
lot	c
and	c
I	c
hope	c
it	c
will	c
develop	c
even	c
more	c
to	c
change	c
my	c
life	c
even	c
more	c
.	c

Sir	c
,	c
Madame	i

But	c
I	c
was	c
not	c
very	c
satisfied	c
after	c
my	c
"	c
perfect	c
evening	c
"	c
out	c
.	c

The	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
Musical	c
Show	c
was	c
very	c
good	c
,	c
but	c
the	c
information	c
was	c
not	c
correct	c
.	c

Because	c
of	c
the	c
advertisement	c
I	c
thought	c
that	c
I	c
can	i
discount	i
the	i
tickets	c
available	c
but	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
.	c

So	c
you	c
can	c
see	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
a	c
so	c
perfect	c
evening	i
for	c
me	c
then	i
I	c
thought	i
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secretes	i
.	c

Sometimes	c
it	c
finished	c
like	i
this	i
that	i
the	c
others	c
only	c
said	i
:	c
"	c
Hello	c
,	c
how	c
are	c
you	c
?	c
"	c
and	i
then	c
went	i
away	c
without	c
listening	c
the	i
answer	c
.	c

This	c
made	c
Pat	c
sad	c
and	c
she	c
became	c
very	c
quiet	c
.	c

But	c
at	c
night	c
,	c
when	c
it	c
became	c
dark	c
the	c
dreams	c
were	i
coming	i
.	c

She	c
dreamed	c
about	c
good	c
friends	c
,	c
time	i
that	c
was	i
long	c
passed	c
by	c
and	c
she	c
dreamed	c
from	i
someone	c
who	c
she	c
can	i
tell	c
her	c
own	c
secrets	c
.	c

Then	c
one	c
day	c
she	c
met	c
this	c
person	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c
I	c
recently	c
went	c
to	c
The	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
see	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
,	c
and	c
it	c
has	c
been	c
quite	c
deceiving	i
.	c

To	c
begin	c
with	c
,	c
as	c
far	c
as	c
the	c
starring	i
is	c
concerned	c
,	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
should	c
have	c
performed	c
the	i
main	c
character	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
saw	c
at	c
the	c
very	c
beginning	c
of	c
the	c
show	c
that	c
he	c
did	c
not	c
.	c

Personnaly	i
speaking	c
,	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
saw	i
it	i
and	c
even	i
did	i
n't	i
heard	i
of	c
it	i
:	c
I	c
have	i
asked	i
about	c
it	c
,	c
but	c
nobody	c
seemed	c
to	c
know	c
anything	c
concerning	c
discounts	c
.	c

On	c
top	c
of	c
that	c
,	c
the	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
for	c
renovations	i
!	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hear	i
from	c
you	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

If	c
only	c
Paul	c
had	c
knew	i
it	i
before	c
...	c

He	c
went	c
through	c
valleys	i
,	c
plains	c
and	c
mountains	c
of	c
the	c
Dream	c
Landscape	c
.	c

He	c
finally	c
arrived	c
in	c
Faerie	c
,	c
a	c
country	c
of	c
elder	c
elves	c
and	c
strong	c
white-bearded	c
dwarves	c

All	c
of	c
a	c
sudden	c
,	c
a	c
weird	c
creature	c
popped	c
into	c
his	c
dream	c
.	c

She	c
was	c
taller	c
than	c
a	c
dwarf	c
and	c
as	c
thin	c
as	c
a	c
dying	c
tree	c
.	c

Paul	c
was	c
wandering	i
wether	i
this	c
beast	c
could	c
be	c
offensive	i
when	c
the	c
creature	c
said	c
these	c
words	c
"	i
I	c
am	c
glad	c
to	c
meet	c
you	c
,	c
Paul.	c
"	c

Relieved	c
,	c
he	c
thought	c
that	c
bringing	c
the	c
creature	c
in	i
his	c
world	c
would	c
have	c
revealed	c
the	c
existence	c
of	c
Faerie	c
,	c
and	c
with	c
it	c
,	c
threatened	c
the	c
ecology	c
of	c
the	c
Dream	c
Landscape	c
,	c
when	c
he	c
heard	c
a	c
creepy	c
sound	c
under	c
his	c
bed	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
...	c
one	c
our	i
after	c
,	i
a	c
local	c
zoo	c
arrived	i
and	c
caught	c
the	c
creature	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
put	c
her	c
in	c
a	c
cage	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
really	c
disappointed	c
because	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
far	c
from	c
what	c
I	c
expected	c
.	c

Secondally	i
the	c
show	c
started	c
late	c
and	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
wait	c
for	c
45	c
minutes	c
without	i
doing	c
anything	i
.	c

Furthur	i
more	i
,	c
the	c
restaurant	c
in	c
the	c
theatre	c
was	c
closed	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
delay	c

I	c
have	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
the	c
evening	c
was	c
terrible	c
.	c

If	c
I	c
had	c
known	c
all	i
of	i
them	i
,	c
I	c
would	c
have	c
changed	c
my	c
plan	c
and	c
could	c
have	i
a	c
better	c
time	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
this	c
matter	c
will	c
receive	c
your	c
prompt	c
attention	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

Fashion	c
in	c
100	c
years	c

If	c
you	c
compare	c
the	c
fashion	c
now	c
with	c
that	c
of	c
100	c
years	c
ago	c
,	c
you	c
'll	c
notice	c
that	c
there	c
are	c
incredably	i
big	c
difference	i
between	c
them	c
.	c

People	c
have	c
become	c
more	c
informal	c
,	c
casual	c
and	c
practical	c
than	c
before	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
'll	c
also	c
be	c
very	c
different	c
from	c
now	c
.	c

But	c
in	c
which	i
way	c
?	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
people	c
might	c
think	c
more	c
about	c
the	c
function	c
of	c
clothes	c
than	c
the	c
design	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
they	c
'll	c
wear	c
a	i
cloth	i
which	c
protect	i
themselves	i
from	c
air	c
pollution	c
,	c
sunshine	c
etc	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
like	c
a	c
joke	c
,	c
but	c
a	c
bit	c
scarely	i
.	c

Imagine	c
that	c
all	c
the	c
people	c
have	c
hats	c
with	c
big	i
edges	i
to	c
protect	c
their	c
faces	c
from	c
sun-burn	i
,	c
and	c
it	c
's	c
the	c
most	i
trendy	i
fashion	c
of	c
the	c
year	c
!	c

It	c
's	c
funny	c
.	c

The	c
show	c
was	c
called	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
"	c
and	c
should	c
be	c
,	c
in	i
refer	i
to	i
the	c
advertisment	i
,	c
London	c
's	c
newest	c
and	c
best	c
musical	c
show	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
disappointed	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
saw	c
that	c
you	c
had	c
changed	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
to	i
someone	c
else	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
disappointed	c
.	c

The	c
perfect	c
evening	c
you	c
promised	c
in	c
your	c
advertisment	i
was	c
the	c
complete	c
opposite	c
and	c
that	c
is	c
what	i
I	c
want	c
to	c
get	c
some	c
money	c
back	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Herman	c
Ruter	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

Pat	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
friends	c
for	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
.	c

He	c
told	c
me	c
two	i
hours	c
what	c
could	c
happen	c
if	c
I	c
would	i
do	i
that	c
.	c

The	c
next	c
day	c
Pat	c
told	c
me	c
that	c
he	c
wanted	c
to	c
be	c
admired	c
by	c
some	c
girls	c
and	c
so	c
he	c
had	c
to	c
tell	c
them	c
our	c
secret	c
.	c

I	c
felt	c
very	c
disappointed	c
in	i
this	i
moment	i
but	c
I	c
have	c
learned	c
something	c
new	c
about	c
humans	c
;	c
is	i
you	i
can	c
only	c
trust	c
yourself	c
.	c

Sir	c
,	c

I	c
have	c
seen	c
your	c
musical	c
show	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
I	i
have	i
been	i
attracted	c
by	c
the	c
actors	c
-	c
Danny	c
Brooks	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
-	c
and	c
not	c
by	c
the	c
actors	c
who	c
played	i
effectly	i
that	c
evening	c
.	c

This	i
actors	c
appeared	c
with	i
fourty-five	i
minutes	c
later	i
refering	i
which	i
is	c
written	c
on	i
your	c
advertisement	c
.	c

This	c
late	i
forbid	i
me	c
to	i
dinner	c
in	c
your	c
restaurant	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
just	c
closing	c
!	c

For	c
all	c
this	i
reasons	c
I	c
do	i
wish	c
that	c
I	c
would	i
not	i
have	i
been	i
gone	c
see	i
that	c
show	c
,	c
for	c
which	c
the	c
tickets	c
were	c
not	c
available	c
.	c

And	c
as	i
a	i
conclusion	i
I	c
want	c
you	c
to	c
give	c
me	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
,	c
(	c
I	c
have	i
still	i
the	c
advertisement	c
if	c
you	c
want	c
the	i
prooth	i
what	i
I	c
say	c
)	c
.	c

You	c
have	c
the	c
choice	c
,	c
either	c
you	c
make	i
what	c
I	c
want	c
,	c
or	c
I	c
attack	c
you	c
in	c
justice	i
.	c

Yours	c
sincerly	i

When	c
I	c
have	i
read	i
this	c
book	c
,	c
I	c
have	i
been	i
fascinated	c
by	c
the	c
will	i
of	c
the	c
old	c
fisher	i
.	c

His	c
boat	c
is	c
so	c
small	c
and	c
poor	c
,	c
he	c
is	c
old	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
hot	c
and	c
he	c
is	c
alone	c
without	c
any	c
chance	c
to	i
meet	i
someone	i
who	c
could	c
help	c
him	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
think	c
he	c
would	c
want	c
to	c
.	c

He	c
doe	i
n't	i
want	c
because	i
he	c
wants	c
to	c
prove	c
the	i
little	c
and	i
himself	c
that	c
he	c
is	c
not	c
really	c
old	c
,	c
even	c
if	c
he	c
has	c
a	i
big	i
age	i
.	c

I	c
think	c
this	i
are	c
the	c
reasons	c
of	i
his	c
will	i
.	c

The	c
reasons	c
for	c
my	c
choice	c
are	c
that	c
I	c
am	c
having	c
my	c
graduation	c
exams	c
in	c
June	c
and	c
my	c
entrance	c
exams	c
in	c
August	c
.	c

As	c
regards	c
accomodation	i
,	c
I	c
would	c
rather	i
choose	c
staying	i
in	c
tents	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
quite	c
romantic	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
.	c

As	c
to	c
the	c
activities	c
offered	c
I	i
would	c
love	c
to	c
go	c
in	c
for	c
swimming	c
and	c
photography	c
while	c
camping	c
,	c
although	c
I	c
am	c
not	c
quite	i
good	c
at	c
the	c
last	c
one	c
.	c

Actually	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
take	c
up	c
photography	c
as	c
a	c
hobby	c
and	c
if	c
you	c
can	c
provide	c
me	c
with	c
an	c
opportunity	c
to	c
study	c
in	c
this	c
area	c
,	c
I	c
will	c
accept	c
it	c
with	c
pleasure	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
much	c
about	c
the	c
weather	c
down	c
there	c
,	c
in	c
California	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
am	c
rather	c
puzzeled	i
about	c
what	c
to	c
wear	c
there	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

XAVA	c
SURGANOVA	c

I	c
have	c
made	i
a	c
little	c
survey	c
on	c
the	c
subject	c
of	c
my	c
report	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
elucidaded	i
that	c
most	c
of	c
the	c
pupils	c
of	c
our	c
school	c
consider	i
that	c
the	c
region	c
and	c
the	c
area	c
around	c
school	c
should	c
be	c
filmed	c
first	c
.	c

Next	i
things	c
to	c
be	c
shot	c
,	c
by	i
the	c
majority	c
of	c
students	c
was	i
said	i
to	i
be	i
the	c
teaching	c
process	c
and	c
the	c
breaks	c
.	c

Obviously	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
interesting	c
to	c
find	c
out	c
what	c
methods	c
are	c
used	c
by	c
our	c
teachers	c
to	c
help	c
pupils	c
understand	c
their	c
subject	c
better	c
.	c

Here	c
I	c
should	c
also	c
mention	c
the	c
decoration	i
of	c
our	c
classrooms	c
and	c
atmosphere	i
in	c
them	c
.	c

And	c
as	c
regards	c
breaks	c
student	i
consider	c
them	c
being	i
a	c
very	c
important	c
part	c
of	c
school	c
life	c
,	c
despite	c
all	c
their	i
mess	c
and	c
noise	c
.	c

And	c
the	c
last	c
but	c
not	c
least	c
thing	c
we	c
should	c
include	c
in	c
the	c
film	c
are	c
the	c
outdoor	c
activities	c
,	c
which	c
our	c
student	i
are	c
provided	c
with	c
in	c
our	c
school	c
.	c

We	c
can	c
make	i
some	i
short	i
shots	i
about	i
the	c
school	c
theatre	c
and	c
it	i
's	i
performances	i
and	c
also	c
about	c
the	c
sport-clubs	i
and	c
their	c
competitions	c
and	c
awards	c
.	c

Conclusion	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
will	c
consider	c
this	c
information	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
,	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
the	i
chance	c
to	c
do	i
such	c
a	c
gorgeous	c
trip	c
.	c

We	c
are	c
really	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
visiting	c
the	c
city	c
and	c
going	c
to	c
the	c
Museum	i
and	c
Gallery	i
.	c

However	c
,	c
there	c
is	c
one	c
point	c
that	c
we	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
change	c
in	c
the	c
programme	c
.	c

The	c
show	c
is	c
very	c
interesting	c
because	c
we	c
could	c
see	c
the	c
latest	c
fashion	c
,	c
hairstyles	c
and	c
make	i
up	i
,	c
and	c
also	c
leisure	i
and	c
sports	c
wear	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
is	i
totally	c
free	c
for	c
students	c
.	c

This	c
one	c
could	c
be	c
translate	i
to	c
15th	i
evening	i
.	c

It	c
is	c
also	c
possible	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
show	c
in	c
the	c
morning	c
but	c
we	c
are	i
totally	c
agree	c
that	c
we	c
do	c
n't	c
want	c
to	c
lose	c
our	c
visit	c
to	c
the	c
Science	c
Museum	c
.	c

We	c
truly	c
believe	i
you	c
will	c
consider	c
our	c
change	c
.	c

Almost	c
everyone	c
relation	i
famous	c
people	c
with	c
photographers	c
,	c
articles	c
,	c
money	c
,	c
fans	c
,	i
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
are	i
the	c
ones	c
that	c
are	c
also	c
respectabled	i
but	c
,	c
appart	i
from	c
their	c
relation	i
with	c
journalists	c
because	c
of	c
their	c
work	c
,	c
they	c
really	c
need	c
to	c
be	c
constantly	c
seek	i
by	c
photographers	c
.	c

Dear	c
Miss	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
wish	c
that	c
I	c
could	c
describe	c
how	c
ecstatic	c
I	c
felt	c
when	c
I	c
found	c
that	i
I	c
won	c
the	c
competition	c
.	c

Here	c
I	c
enclose	c
some	c
information	c
which	c
you	c
requested	c
in	c
the	c
letter	c
I	c
received	c
.	c

This	c
trip	c
will	c
give	c
me	c
a	c
chance	c
to	c
relax	c
during	c
my	c
holidays	c
,	c
as	c
well	c
as	c
allow	i
me	c
to	c
gain	c
valuable	c
knowledge	c
and	c
experience	c
.	c

Between	c
the	c
tent	c
and	c
log	c
cabin	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
the	c
tent	c
.	c

It	c
will	c
let	c
me	c
get	c
up	c
and	i
close	c
with	i
nature	c
,	c
and	c
experience	c
life	c
in	c
the	c
wild	c
.	c

Living	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
will	c
also	c
enhance	c
my	c
survival	c
skills	c
,	c
making	c
this	c
a	c
trip	c
to	c
remember	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
among	c
all	c
of	c
them	c
I	c
like	c
swimming	c
and	c
tennis	c
the	c
best	c
.	c

Last	i
before	i
least	i
,	c
I	c
wonder	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
inform	c
me	c
of	c
the	c
clothes	c
I	c
should	c
bring	c
to	c
America	c
.	c

As	c
I	c
have	c
not	c
been	c
there	c
before	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
rather	c
unsure	c
of	c
what	c
to	c
wear	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
also	c
trying	c
to	c
decide	c
on	c
the	c
amount	c
of	c
money	c
I	c
should	c
bring	c
.	c

Will	c
I	c
be	c
going	c
out	c
much	c
,	c
or	c
just	c
stay	i
in	c
Camp	c
California	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
?	c

I	c
hope	c
the	c
weather	c
is	c
holding	c
up	c
.	c

I	c
hear	c
that	c
it	c
can	c
be	c
terrible	c
at	c
times	c
.	c

Guess	c
what	c
?	c

Last	c
month	c
,	c
I	c
got	c
to	c
help	c
out	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
.	c

All	c
the	c
students	c
had	c
to	c
help	c
to	c
brighten	c
up	c
the	c
place	c
,	c
and	c
boy	c
did	c
we	c
work	c
.	c

I	c
helped	c
to	c
decorate	c
the	c
walls	c
.	c

My	c
friends	c
and	c
I	c
managed	c
to	c
paint	c
a	c
smart	c
navy	c
blue	c
on	c
the	c
old	c
,	c
faded	c
green	c
.	c

Besides	c
that	c
,	c
I	c
also	c
helped	c
to	c
do	c
banners	c
and	c
signs	c
to	c
inform	c
other	c
people	c
about	c
the	c
concert	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
hard	c
work	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
saw	c
wood	c
and	c
paint	c
all	c
day	c
long	c
.	c

I	c
also	c
helped	c
in	i
the	c
lighting	c
and	c
studio	c
equipment	c
.	c

I	c
also	c
got	c
to	c
fix	i
new	c
speakers	c
so	c
that	c
the	c
music	c
could	c
be	c
heard	c
clearly	c
throughout	c
the	c
hall	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
whole	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
fun	c
experience	c
to	c
work	c
with	c
friends	c
,	c
fixing	i
bulbs	c
,	c
attaching	c
lights	c
and	c
adding	c
speakers	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
reading	c
what	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
say	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
keen	c
on	c
joinning	i
Camp	c

U.S.A	c
.	c

According	i
to	i
your	c
activities	c
at	c
the	c
Camp	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
choose	c
singing	c
and	c
painting	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
a	i
lead	c
singer	c
in	c
the	c
university	c
band	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
I	c

To	c
make	c
matters	c
worse	c
,	c
you	c
forget	i
to	c
buy	c
something	c
when	c
you	c
get	c
back	c

Sometimes	c
when	i
you	c
meet	i
a	c
nice	c

and	c
you	c
think	c
you	c
are	c
going	c
to	c
buy	c
it	c

when	c
you	c

it	c

conclusion	c
,	c
I	c
believe	c
that	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
if	c
you	c
accidently	i
meet	i
a	c
bad	c
situation	c
or	c
you	c
can	i
not	i
control	c
your	c
expenditure	c
carefully	c

Dear	c
Mister	i
,	c

My	c
wife	c
an	i
I	c
spent	c
a	c
couple	c
of	c
days	c
in	c
London	c
two	c
weeks	c
ago	c
.	c

No	c
reasons	c
or	c
excuses	c
were	c
given	c
.	c

The	c
worst	c
was	c
to	c
come	c
.	c

The	c
great	c
Danny	c
Brooks	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
be	c
the	c
main	c
character	c
.	c

After	c
the	c
show	c
we	c
had	c
planned	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
.	c

But	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

Perhaps	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
luck	i
!	c

So	c
we	c
want	c
you	c
to	c
give	c
us	c
our	c
money	c
back	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
did	i
n't	i
worth	c
the	c
price	c
.	c

And	c
now	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
wondering	c
if	c
I	c
had	c
not	c
made	c
a	c
mistake	c
.	c

My	c
brother	c
was	c
too	c
talkative	c
!	c

Two	c
days	c
before	c
,	c
I	c
told	c
him	c
that	c
our	c
father	c
was	c
about	c
to	c
buy	c
a	c
brand	c
new	c
car	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
be	c
a	c
gift	c
for	c
twenty	c
years	c
of	c
marriage	c
.	c

A	c
car	c
only	c
for	c
her	c
.	c

The	c
first	c
thing	c
Pat	c
did	c
was	c
to	c
tell	c
our	c
young	c
sister	c
the	c
secret	c
.	c

Her	c
reaction	c
was	c
not	c
the	c
one	c
we	c
were	c
expecting	c
.	c

Really	c
angry	c
!	c
!	c

According	c
to	c
her	c
,	c
this	c
car	c
would	c
have	c
been	c
useless	c
.	c

She	c
suspected	c
our	c
father	c
to	i
want	i
to	c
please	c
himself	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
the	c
colour	c
my	c
father	c
had	c
chosen	c
for	c
the	c
car	c
!	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
that	i
I	c
received	c
yesterday	c
.	c

It	i
is	i
convenient	i
for	i
me	i
the	i
last	i
two	i
weeks	i
of	i
July	i
.	c

After	c
my	c
school	c
exams	c
I	c
will	c
have	c
time	c
to	c
prepare	c
myself	c
for	c
the	c
trip	c
.	c

In	c
your	c
letter	c
you	c
are	i
asking	i
me	c
to	c
chose	i
which	c
accomodation	i
I	c
prefer	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
very	c
much	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
tents	i
.	c

Last	c
year	c
I	c
stay	i
in	c
tents	i
with	c
some	c
friends	c
in	c
England	c
and	c
I	c
really	c
enjoyed	c
it	c
.	c

Summer	i
time	i
the	c
weather	c
is	c
good	c
and	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
see	c
any	i
problem	c
anywhere	i
I	c
will	i
stay	i
.	c

It	c
is	c
my	c
favourite	c
sport	c
.	c

Can	c
you	c
let	c
me	c
know	c
if	c
there	c
is	i
any	c
facilities	c
for	c
washing	c
my	c
clothes	c
If	i
not	c
I	c
will	c
bring	c
with	c
me	c
enough	c
to	c
last	c
for	c
two	c
weeks	c
.	c

Please	c
give	c
me	c
a	c
rough	c
idea	c
how	c
much	c
spending	c
money	c
I	c
will	c
need	c
.	c

Please	c
write	c
soon	c

Yours	c
Sincerely	c

Shoping	i
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

As	c
a	c
housewife	c
I	c
have	c
a	c
good	c
idea	i
about	i
it	i
.	c

Sometimes	c
I	c
go	c
two	i
days	i
We	i
all	c
have	c
to	c
do	c
our	c
shopping	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
unavoidable	c
Sometimes	i
it	c
is	c
pleasant	c
,	c
and	c
sometimes	c
it	c
's	c
not	c
.	c

I	c
often	c
shop	c
with	c
no	c
problems	c
,	c
but	c
on	c
Saturday	c
is	i
not	c
the	c
same	c
.	c

Spending	i
long	i
hours	i
shopping	i
it	i
is	i
tiring	i
for	i
some	i
people	i
.	c

I	c
find	c
it	c
very	c
tiring	c
sometimes	c
.	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
because	c
we	c
spend	c
money	c
.	c

Usually	c
much	i
more	i
money	i
we	i
spend	i
than	c
we	c
expect	c
.	c

We	c
ca	c
n't	c
do	c
anything	c
about	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c

I	c
have	c
just	c
received	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
glad	c
to	c
know	c
I	c
had	c
won	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
the	c
competition	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
reply	c
for	i
the	c
camp	c

Yours	c

Freedom	c

The	c
main	c
characters	c
of	c
this	c
book	c
are	c
Stephen	c
Biko	c
,	c
a	c
black	c
leader	c
,	c
and	c
Donald	c
Woods	c
who	c
is	c
a	c
white	c
newspaper	c
editor	c
.	c

Woods	c
is	c
thought	c
to	c
stand	c
for	c
all	c
of	i
white	c
peope	i
and	c
this	c
book	c
could	c
have	c
an	c
influence	c
on	c
them	c
.	c

Woods	c
thought	c
he	c
knew	c
the	c
black	c
society	c
quite	c
well	c
and	c
understood	c
their	c
ordeals	c
,	c
but	c
after	c
he	c
had	c
met	c
Biko	c
and	c
visited	c
a	c
black	c
township	c
,	c
he	c
realized	c
he	c
had	c
been	c
completely	c
unaware	c
of	c
the	c
way	c
they	c
had	c
to	c
live	c
.	c

The	c
people	c
and	c
the	c
circumstances	c
he	c
experienced	c
in	c
the	c
black	c
township	c
were	c
such	c
a	c
new	c
world	c
to	c
him	c
.	c

Finally	c
he	c
changed	c
his	c
ideas	c
and	c
started	c
to	c
work	c
for	c
the	c
blacks	c
using	c
his	c
skill	c
as	c
a	c
journalist	c
,	i
in	i
other	c
words	c
,	c
he	c
became	c
an	c
activist	c
for	c
the	c
black	c
people	c
of	c
South	c
Africa	c
.	c

Although	c
Biko	c
was	c
killed	c
and	c
Woods	c
himself	c
was	c
declared	c
a	c
banned	c
person	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
dare	c
to	c
say	c
their	c
sacrifices	c
were	c
worthwhile	c
because	c
Woods	c
succeeded	c
in	c
escaping	c
from	c
South	c
Africa	c
which	c
would	c
enable	c
him	c
to	c
publish	c
his	c
book	c
revealing	c
the	c
truth	c
about	c
South	c
Africa	c
to	c
the	c
world	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
ask	i
for	c
your	c
prompt	c
reply	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
can	c
start	c
organizing	c
myself	c
.	c

Dear	c
Kim	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
are	c
doing	c
fine	c
,	i
I	c
am	c
writing	c
this	c
letter	c
,	i
to	c
tell	c
you	c
about	c
my	c
experience	c
of	i
helping	c
a	i
pop	c
concert	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
you	c
need	c
to	c
know	c
,	i
and	i
be	i
counscious	i
of	i
what	c
you	c
are	c
doing	c
.	c

The	c
day	c
of	c
the	c
concert	c
,	c
everyone	c
,	c
including	c
the	c
artists	c
and	c
managers	c
were	c
nervous	c
and	c
were	c
tired	c
,	i
however	i
,	c
when	c
the	c
concert	c
started	c
,	c
we	c
saw	c
that	c
all	c
our	c
efforts	c
were	i
worthy	i
,	i
the	i
crow	i
and	c
artists	c
thanked	c
the	c
staff	c
.	c

What	c
I	c
personally	c
liked	c
the	c
most	c
was	c
all	c
our	c
teamwork	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
see	c
the	c
staff	c
,	c
managers	c
,	c
artists	c
and	c
even	c
the	c
director	c
,	c
all	c
like	i
a	c
big	c
team	c
,	c
working	c
together	c
.	c

Try	c
it	c
,	c
I	c
recommend	c
it	c
.	c

Write	c
back	c
soon	c
,	c

Love	c

Carmen	c
Dolores	c
Rossell	c

I	c
am	c
writting	i
this	c
letter	c
because	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
week	c
in	c
London	c
last	c
month	c
and	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
see	c
your	c
show	c
called	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
"	c
with	c
my	c
wife	c
and	c
children	c
.	c

The	c
children	c
could	c
not	c
stand	c
waiting	c
outside	c
in	c
the	c
cold	c
.	c

We	c
did	c
not	c
see	c
any	c
discounts	c
!	c

I	c
understand	c
them	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
if	c
you	c
take	i
care	i
more	i
of	c
the	c
public	c
,	c
your	c
show	c
would	c
catch	c
on	c
because	c
the	c
singers	c
and	c
songs	c
are	c
really	c
impressive	c
.	c

Modern	c
technology	c
is	c
everywhere	c
in	c
our	c
society	c
.	c

We	c
use	c
it	c
daily	c
and	c
sometimes	c
do	c
n't	c
realize	c
that	c
things	c
are	c
changing	c
in	c
our	c
daily	c
life	c
.	c

The	c
ways	c
of	i
transport	i
are	c
improving	c
a	c
lot	c
this	i
times	i
.	c

The	i
cars	i
are	c
really	c
useful	c
and	c
a	c
lot	c
more	i
faster	i
than	c
waking	i
or	c
cycling	c
.	c

But	c
cars	c
created	i
pollution	c
:	c
for	c
exemple	i
the	c
green	i
house	i
effect	c
.	c

Technology	c
allows	c
us	c
to	c
improve	c
our	c
knowledge	c
in	c
sciences	i
like	c
medecine	i
so	c
as	c
to	c
cure	c
more	c
illnesses	c
or	c
to	c
make	c
people	c
live	c
older	i
.	c

I	c
think	c
there	c
is	c
a	c
link	c
between	c
technology	c
and	c
sciences	i
because	c
they	c
need	c
each	c
other	c
:	c
sciences	i
discover	c
technologies	c
and	c
technologies	c
make	c
possible	i
new	i
searches	i
in	i
sciences	i
.	c

I	c
chat	c
with	c
other	c
people	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
exchange	c
our	c
points	c
of	c
view	c
or	c
I	c
look	c
for	c
informations	i
I	c
need	c
for	c
my	c
studies	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
it	c
's	c
a	c
lot	c
better	c
than	c
the	c
dictionnary	i
because	c
it	c
's	c
faster	c
and	c
you	c
really	c
find	c
what	c
you	c
need	c
.	c

Technology	c
is	c
necessary	c
to	c
our	c
society	c
but	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
could	c
be	i
also	i
dangerous	c
if	c
we	c
do	c
n't	c
use	c
it	c
in	c
the	i
good	c
way	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr.	c
Smith	c
,	c

I	c
was	c
waitting	i
45	c
minutes	c
for	c
anything	i
!	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

How	c
has	c
modern	c
technology	c
changed	c
your	c
daily	c
life	c
?	c

In	i
my	i
point	i
of	i
vue	i
,	c
Internet	i
is	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
discover	i
of	c
the	c
2000	c
centery	i

You	c
have	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
things	c
to	c
do	c
,	c
to	c
see	c
,	c
to	c
learn	c

It	c
is	c
too	c
big	c
to	c
tell	c
everybody	c
about	c
what	c
you	c
can	c
do	c
!	c

I	c
hope	c
I	c
will	c
help	c
them	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
sure	c
I	c
will	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
your	c
musical	c
show	c
"	c
OVER	c
THE	c
RAINBOW	c
"	c
,	c
which	c
I	c
recently	c
saw	c
at	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
the	c
only	c
disappointment	c
during	c
my	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
,	c
since	c
several	c
points	i
did	c
n't	c
worked	i
out	c
as	c
promised	c
in	c
your	c
advertisement	c
.	c

His	c
acting	c
and	c
singing	c
was	i
horrible	c
.	c

At	i
last	i
,	c
after	c
all	c
these	c
disadvantages	i
,	c
I	c
was	c
not	c
able	c
to	c
have	c
diner	i
in	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
.	c

Therefor	i
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
for	c
at	c
least	c
half	c
of	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c

The	c
pressure	c
of	c
secrets	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

Sometimes	c
he	c
had	c
liked	c
to	c
surprise	c
his	c
class	c
with	c
a	c
test	c
to	c
see	c
how	c
good	c
they	c
would	c
be	c
when	c
they	c
could	c
not	c
have	c
learned	i
for	c
it	c
in	c
advance	c
.	c

What	c
was	c
the	c
reason	c
?	c

Pat	c
used	c
to	c
show	c
the	c
test	c
to	c
his	c
friend	c
Nick	c
,	c
when	c
he	c
had	c
finished	c
it	c
to	i
get	c
his	c
opinion	c
.	c

Nick	c
now	i
had	i
taken	i
a	c
copy	c
of	c
the	c
test	c
to	c
archive	i
it	c
.	c

She	c
was	c
quite	c
clever	c
and	c
had	c
known	c
everything	c
about	c
this	c
,	c
so	c
she	c
had	c
taken	i
copies	c
for	c
her	c
classmates	c
and	c
everybody	c
was	c
prepared	c
.	c

Or	c
can	c
you	c
keep	c
a	c
secret	c
?	c

Dear	c
Mr.	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
n't	c
the	c
first	c
time	c
for	i
me	i
to	i
visit	i
this	c
show	c
in	c
your	c
theatre	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
the	c
worsed	i
one	c
.	c

At	c
first	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
great	c
plessure	i
for	c
me	c
to	c
get	c
a	c
ticket	c
therefor	i
becauses	i
I	c
'm	c
one	c
of	c
the	i
greatest	i
fan	i
of	i
Danny	i
Brook	i
.	c

When	c
musical	i
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
(	c
not	c
at	c
19:30	c
as	c
showed	i
)	c
I	c
was	c
realy	i
shokked	i
when	c
I	c
realised	c
that	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
was	c
playing	c
.	i

I	c
could	c
n't	c
stay	c
any	c
more	i
and	c
had	c
to	c
leave	c
the	c
theatre	c
.	c

In	c
past	i
new	c
technologies	c
mostly	i
followed	c
by	c
ground-	c
,	c
water-	c
or	c
air	c
pollution	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
one	c
hand	c
there	c
are	c
the	c
materials	c
from	c
which	c
the	c
PC	i
's	i
are	c
made	c
of	i
,	c
on	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
is	c
the	c
uge	i
waste	c
problem	c
situated	i

Now	c
I	c
try	c
to	c
show	c
,	c
in	c
my	c
daily	c
work	c
,	c
how	c
the	c
airborn	c
chlororganics	c

which	c

Sometimes	c
it	c
seems	c
to	c
me	c
like	c
joke	i
if	c
I	c
remember	i
all	c
the	c
daungerous	i
materials	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
do	c
my	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
answer	c
your	c
letter	c
,	c
which	c
I	c
have	i
recieved	i
yesterday	c
.	c

I	c
could	i
travel	c
only	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
my	c
exam	i
will	c
be	c
finished	c
in	i
the	c
beginning	c
of	c
that	c
month	c
and	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
great	c
if	c
I	c
could	c
set	c
off	c
my	i
journey	c
on	c
15th	c
July	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
log	c
cabins	c
because	c
the	c
weather	c
is	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
rainy	c
according	i
to	c
the	c
forecast	c

I	c
have	c
been	c
playing	c
them	c
for	c
more	c
than	c
3	c
years	c
in	i
which	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
trained	c

3	c
years	c

Yours	c
Sincerely	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
suitable	c
for	c
children	c
whose	c
age	i
is	i
under	c
18	c
!	c

This	c
is	c
quite	c
a	c
strong	c
opinion	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
know	i
it	c
from	c
my	c
real-life	c
experiences	c
of	c
shopping	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
was	c
15	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
starting	c
to	c
look	c
for	c
new	c
clothes	c
,	c
shoes	c
,	c
and	c
everything	c
I	c
could	i
find	c
now	c
unneccessary	i
.	c

I	i
'm	i
not	c
dare	c
to	c
culculate	i
how	c
much	c
I	c
have	c
spent	c
for	i
those	c
things	c
without	c
thinking	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
about	c
the	c
International	c
Arts	c
Festival	c
which	c
took	c
place	c
these	i
21	c
and	c
22	c
November	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
idea	c
to	c
have	c
this	c
kind	c
of	c
festival	c
in	c
our	c
region	c
and	c
I	c
really	c
enjoyed	c
most	c
of	c
the	c
events	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
feel	c
that	c
it	c
could	c
be	c
even	c
better	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
according	c
to	c
your	c
advertisement	c
,	c
the	c
'	c
Stars	c
and	c
artists	c
from	c
around	c
the	c
world	c
'	c
came	c
from	c
only	c
six	c
countries	c
.	c

I	c
felt	c
quite	c
disappointed	c
as	c
everybody	c
knows	c
that	c
"	c
our	c
"	c
world	c
is	c
full	c
of	c
different	c
cultures	c
.	c

Maybe	c
not	c
enough	c
were	c
represented	c
.	c

In	c
spite	c
of	c
the	c
fact	c
that	c
the	c
classical	c
concerts	c
were	c
really	c
good	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
some	c
concert	c
halls	c
were	c
too	c
small	c
and	c
so	c
not	c
everybody	c
could	c
appreciate	c
the	c
good	i
quality	c
of	c
the	c
music	c
.	c

May	c
I	c
suggest	c
you	c
to	i
think	i
about	c
doing	c
the	c
festival	c
over	c
one	i
week	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

Dear	c
Magda	c
,	c

Thanks	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
asked	c
me	c
in	c
it	c
,	c
here	c
are	c
some	c
school	i
and	c
home	c
rules	c
in	c
my	c
country	c
,	c
France	c
.	c

Of	c
course	c
when	c
you	c
're	c
in	c
class	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
behave	c
yourself	c
,	i
be	c
polite	c
with	c
the	c
teacher	c
and	c
the	c
other	c
school	i
children	i
.	c

During	c
the	c
break	c
too	i
,	c
usually	c
some	c
teachers	c
stay	c
out	c
and	c
keep	c
an	c
eye	c
on	c
you	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
nowadays	c
,	c
children	c
are	c
more	c
free	c
and	c
heard	i
,	i
I	c
mean	c
the	i
contact	c
between	c
them	c
and	c
adults	c
.	c

At	c
home	c
is	i
different	c
,	i
each	i
family	c
has	c
its	c
own	c
rules	c
.	c

As	i
I	i
am	i
concerned	i
,	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
child	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
not	c
allowed	c
to	c
stay	c
very	i
late	c
with	c
my	c
parents	c
and	c
sometimes	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
because	c
I	c
was	c
not	c
tired	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
wise	i
child	c
,	i
so	i
!	c

Usually	c
,	c
at	c
home	c
,	c
like	c
at	c
school	c
,	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
behave	c
yourself	c
but	c
differently	c
,	c
because	c
you	c
're	c
at	c
home	c
so	c
you	c
feel	c
more	c
confident	c
.	c

There	c
are	c
some	c
rules	c
like	i
"	c
do	c
n't	c
speak	c
with	c
a	c
full	c
mouth	c
"	c
;	c
"	c
do	c
n't	c
put	c
your	c
finger	c
in	c
your	c
noise	i
"	c
;	c
"	c
say	c
please	c
and	c
thank	c
you	c
"	c
;	c
"	c
do	c
n't	c
fight	c
with	c
your	c
brother	c
"	c
;	c
and	c
so	c
on	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
's	c
the	c
same	c
everywhere	c
.	c

With	c
lots	c
of	c
love	c
,	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
disappointed	c
with	c
it	c
,	i
I	c
was	c
expected	i
opposit	i
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
the	i
advertisement	c
where	c
you	c
have	i
advertised	i
your	c
program	i
and	c
what	c
the	c
theatre	c
was	i
providing	i
for	i
you	i
is	c
totaly	i
wrong	c
.	c

And	c
I	c
think	c
you	c
know	c
how	c
it	c
is	c
just	c
sit	i
and	c
wait	i
for	c
45min	i
.	i

befor	i
the	c
beggining	i
?	c

So	c
,	c
after	c
all	c
of	c
that	c
,	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
nice	c
relaxing	c
diner	i
in	c
your	c
restaurant	c
,	i
I	c
was	c
very	c
angry	c
when	c
I	c
apeared	i
infrant	i
of	c
closed	c
doors	c
and	c
there	c
was	c
a	c
notice	c
,	i
that	c
the	c
restaurant	c
was	c
n't	c
working	i
.	c

In	c
fact	c
writing	i
to	c
you	c
just	i
with	i
one	c
main	c
reason	i
.	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forword	i
hearing	i
from	c
you	c
.	c

Lena	c
Jarova	c

Begin	c
at	c
the	c
begining	i
.	c

Look	c
at	c
historical	i
books	c
400-600	i
years	c
ago	c
,	c
or	c
even	c
in	i
time	i
of	c
First	i
and	c
Second	c
World	c
War	i
,	c
how	i
are	i
sociaty	i
changed	i
,	c
just	c
because	c
we	c
did	i
step	i
up	c
in	i
the	c
science	i
and	c
technology	c
.	c

More	c
and	c
more	c
people	c
died	i
from	c
some	c
illness	i
wheres	i
long	i
time	c
ago	c
less	i
people	c

from	c
illneses	i
,	c
dispite	i
that	i
fact	c
that	c
they	c
had	c
less	i
medisent	i
.	c

Everyday	i
scientist	i
and	c
technologyst	i
discover	c
and	c
produce	c
more	c
and	c
more	c
new	c
things	c
and	c
it	i
is	c
good	c
,	i
it	i
has	c
to	c
be	c
like	c
that	c
,	c
we	c
have	c
to	c
do	i
forword	i
not	c
behind	i
from	c
the	c
point	c
where	c
we	c
are	c
now	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
in	c
reply	c
to	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
I	i
want	c
to	c
give	i
you	c
the	i
thanks	i
for	c
this	c
prize	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
excited	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
won	c
a	c
prize	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
never	c
been	c
in	i
the	c
USA	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
this	c
travel	i
will	c
be	c
an	c
unforgetable	i
experience	c
.	c

In	c
August	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
be	c
in	c
Madrid	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
going	c
to	c
work	c
as	c
a	c
trainee	c
in	c
a	c
travel	c
agency	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
because	c
I	c
like	c
very	i
much	i
the	i
nature	i
and	i
camping	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
better	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
than	c
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
.	c

Although	c
all	c
the	c
activities	c
that	c
you	c
mention	c
are	c
very	c
interesting	c
,	c
I	c
prefer	c
swimming	c
and	c
tennis	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
good	c
in	i
swimming	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
not	c
so	c
good	c
in	i
tennis	c
because	c
I	c
began	c
to	c
play	c
only	c
two	c
years	c
ago	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
foward	i
to	c
receiving	c
your	c
reply	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

Silvia	c
Torroja	c
.	c

An	c
argument	c
in	c
favour	c
of	c
this	c
statement	c
is	c
that	c
shopping	c
is	c
very	c
tiring	c
.	c

You	c
can	c
be	c
walking	c
for	c
hours	c
and	c
finally	c
you	c
ca	c
n't	c
find	c
anything	c
that	c
you	c
like	c
.	c

Also	c
,	c
you	c
can	c
spend	c
hours	c
trying	c
to	c
decide	c
between	c
a	c
wonderful	c
blue	c
trousers	i
or	c
a	c
beautiful	c
black	c
dress	c
,	c
for	c
example	c
.	c

Despite	c
shopping	c
is	i
boring	c
I	i
think	c
that	c
it	c
is	c
necessary	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
important	c
for	c
people	c
to	c
have	c
several	c
clothes	i
and	c
also	c
suitable	c
clothes	c
for	c
a	c
very	c
important	c
meeting	c
or	c
appointment	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
enjoyable	c
,	c
but	c
necessary	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
,	c

At	i
first	i
,	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
programme	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
very	c
various	i
and	c
interesting	c
.	c

But	c
last	c
week	c
we	c
have	i
seen	i
an	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
.	c

This	c
presentation	c
will	c
show	c
the	c
latest	c
fashions	c
and	c
the	i
leisure	c
and	c
sports	c
wear	c
.	c

We	c
would	c
be	c
very	c
interesting	i
in	c
seeing	c
the	i
english	i
fashion	c
.	c

At	c
this	c
show	c
we	c
could	c
see	c
different	c
new	c
make	i
up	i
and	c
hairstyles	c
.	c

The	c
event	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
on	c
the	c
14th	c
of	c
March	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
free	c
for	c
students	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
not	c
too	c
far	c
and	c
the	c
openning	i
hours	c
fit	i
us	c
.	c

About	c
the	c
programme	c
,	c
we	c
suggest	c
to	i
see	i
the	c
show	c
on	c
the	c
Tuesday	c
morning	c
and	c
after	i
to	i
do	i
shopping	c
.	c

As	c
far	c
as	c
we	c
are	c
concerned	c
we	i
prefer	c
seeing	i
the	c
Science	c
Museum	c
rather	c
than	c
the	c
National	c
Art	c
Gallery	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
wo	c
n't	c
be	c
too	c
angry	c
for	i
this	c
changing	i
but	c
we	c
would	c
all	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

For	i
the	c
class	c

People	c
's	c
homes	c
will	c
build	i
more	c
economically	c
by	c
using	c
natural	c
energies	i
like	c
solar	c
or	c
wind	c
energy	c
.	c

About	c
the	c
size	c
of	c
hous	i
,	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
in	c
cities	c
houses	c
will	c
be	c
more	c
and	c
more	c
little	i
because	c
of	c
the	i
over	i
population	i
.	c

We	c
also	i
will	i
see	c
very	c
high	i
buildings	c
which	c
contains	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
narrow	c
flats	c
.	c

But	c
about	c
differences	i
between	c
rich	i
's	i
and	i
poor	i
's	i
homes	i
will	i
be	c
the	c
same	c
in	c
the	c
futur	i
.	c

New	c
technologies	c
and	c
facilities	c
wo	c
n't	c
improve	c
the	c
relationship	c
between	c
people	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
people	c
will	c
be	c
as	c
alone	c
and	c
julous	i
as	c
today	c
.	c

Mr./Mrs	c
Manager	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
a	c
musical	c
show	i
I	c
went	c
one	i
week	c
ago	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
really	c
disappointed	c
when	c
I	c
realised	c
that	c
the	c
actor	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
was	c
not	c
performing	c
due	i
to	i
personal	c
reasons	c
,	i
I	c
like	c
this	c
actor	c
very	c
much	c
and	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
the	c
same	c
without	c
him	c
.	c

To	c
make	c
matters	c
worse	c
,	c
there	c
were	c
not	i
ticket	i
discounts	i
as	i
you	c
advertised	c
.	c

Looking	c
forward	c
to	c
receiving	c
your	c
prompt	c
reply	c
.	c

Sincerely	c
,	c

Well	c
,	c
it	c
's	c
pretty	c
simple	c
to	c
answer	c
this	c
.	c

Everything	c
started	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
eight	c
years	c
old	c
and	c
my	c
family	c
bought	c
a	c
Personal	c
Computer	c
,	i
I	c
did	c
n't	c
paid	i
attention	c
to	c
it	c
at	i
that	i
moment	i
but	c
as	c
soon	i
as	c
I	c
grew	c
older	c
I	c
started	c
to	c
like	c
and	c
play	c
Computer	c
games	c
.	c

The	c
years	c
went	c
by	c
and	c
after	c
buying	c
a	c
newer	c
,	c
faster	c
and	c
better	c
PC	c
I	c
found	c
myself	c
writing	c
letters	c
,	c
doing	c
School	i
homework	c
and	c
evening	i
learning	c
with	c
my	c
Computer	c
.	c

In	c
spite	c
of	c
my	c
family	c
telling	c
me	c
to	c
turn	c
the	c
PC	c
off	c
and	c
talk	c
with	i
them	c
,	c
I	c
kept	c
on	c
stucked	i
in	c
front	c
of	c
the	c
screen	c
.	c

Nowadays	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
fact	c
that	c
my	c
life	c
would	c
n't	c
be	c
the	c
same	c
without	c
my	c
PC	c
.	c

I	c
spend	c
my	c
free	c
time	c
building	c
my	c
Personal	c
Web	c
Page	c
with	c
which	c
I	c
intend	c
to	c
earn	c
money	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
;	c
and	c
I	c
also	c
check	c
the	c
weather	c
forecast	c
,	c
buy	c
food	c
and	c
pay	c
bills	c
through	c

Mr.	i
Robertson	c
:	c

After	c
reading	c
the	c
hole	i
organized	i
programme	c
,	c
we	c
all	c
agreed	c
about	c
the	c
sightseeing	c
by	i
bus	c
around	c
London	c
wich	i
will	c
give	c
us	c
the	c
knowledge	c
about	i
this	c
fantastic	c
city	c
we	c
all	i
want	i
to	c
meet	i
since	c
time	i
ago	c
.	c

We	c
found	c
the	c
advertisment	i
in	c
a	c
local	c
newspaper	c
article	i
and	c
have	c
been	c
thinking	c
it	c
could	c
be	c
such	c
a	c
good	c
opportunity	c
,	c
because	c
the	c
show	c
consists	c
on	i
these	c
topics	c
:	c

.	c

Latest	c
Fashions	c

.	c

Hairstyles	c
.	c

After	c
being	i
discussing	c
,	i
we	c
want	c
to	c
suggest	c
how	c
we	c
think	c
the	c
programme	c
should	c
be	c
re-arranged	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincirely	i

Not	c
only	c
because	c
she	c
's	c
famous	c
or	i
wrote	c
lots	c
of	c
books	c
,	c
but	c
she	c
knows	c
how	c
to	c
introduce	c
caracthers	i
or	i
how	c
to	c
tell	c
a	c
good	c
story	c
us	i
though	i
decieving	i
the	c
readers	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
train	c
,	c
all	c
the	c
passangers	i
seem	c
to	c
be	c
involved	c
in	c
a	c
crime	c
.	c

The	c
mistery	i
is	c
kept	i
until	c
the	c
last	c
page	c
of	c
the	c
book	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
sure	c
you	c
'll	c
read	c
this	c
letter	c
,	i
with	c
the	c
intention	c
of	c
explaining	c
the	c
problems	c
had	i
during	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
of	i
his	i
theatre	c
.	c

One	c
of	c
the	c
causes	c
of	c
my	c
disappointing	i
was	c
the	c
different	i
actor	c
that	c
played	c
the	i
show	c
.	c

You	c
'll	c
be	i
agree	c
with	c
me	c
that	c
45	c
minutes	c
to	i
waiting	i
for	c
the	c
starting	i
of	c
the	c
show	c
is	c
a	i
too	i
long	i
time	c
.	c

The	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
'	i
cause	i
of	c
illness.	c
.	c

For	c
those	c
reasons	c
I	c
ask	c
you	c
for	c
some	c
money	c
back	c
,	c
sure	c
of	c
my	c
good	c
reasons	c

for	c
that	c
very	c
interesting	c
competition	c

I	c
am	c
only	c

I	c
am	c
studying	c
in	i

engineering	c

and	c
I	c
'll	c
work	c
until	c

no	c

for	c

I	c
am	c
used	c
to	c
spend	i
summer	c
holiday	i

I	c
like	c
it	c

LACOSTE	c

Sometimes	c
it	c
is	c
necessary	c
and	c
sometimes	c
not	c
and	c
overall	c
it	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

Sometimes	c
it	c
is	c
necessary	c
but	c
you	c
spend	c
four	c
or	c
five	c
hours	c
in	c
the	c
supermarket	c
because	c
there	c
is	i
too	c
much	i
people	c
.	c

But	c
sometimes	c
you	c
go	c
shopping	c
for	c
pleasure	c
and	c
you	c
have	c
all	i
your	i
time	i
(	c
the	i
girls	i
know	i
what	i
it	i
is	i
)	c

Dear	c
Mrs.	c
Ryan	c
,	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
this	c
prize	c
and	c
the	c
fact	c
that	c
you	c
wrote	c
me	i
asking	c
for	c
my	c
preferences	c
about	c
the	c
Camp	c
.	c

About	i
the	c
information	c
you	c
needed	i
,	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
that	c
I	c
can	c
only	c
go	c
in	c
July	c
,	c
because	i
of	i
work	c
reasons	c
.	c

Once	c
there	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
staying	c
in	c
tents	i
,	c
because	c
that	c
is	c
a	c
way	c
to	c
remember	c
my	c
childhood	c
as	c
a	c
boyscout	i
and	c
go	i
against	i
the	c
routine	c
.	c

One	c
of	c
my	c
hobbies	c
is	c
the	i
photography	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
think	c
I	c
am	c
rather	c
good	c
at	c
it	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
will	c
take	c
painting	c
only	i
to	c
learn	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
not	c
very	c
talentive	i
at	c
it	c
.	c

Please	c
reply	c
soon	i

sincerely	c

Dear	c
Kim	c

You	c
are	c
not	c
going	c
to	c
believe	c
what	c
I	c
am	c
about	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
!	c

A	c
couple	c
of	c
months	c
ago	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
told	c
that	c
Britney	c
Spears	c
was	c
coming	c
to	c
perform	c
in	c
our	c
city	c
.	c

But	c
it	c
was	c
worthy	i
.	c

But	c
when	c
Britney	c
came	c
out	i
of	i
the	c
stage	c
,	c
she	c
passed	c
by	c
me	c
,	c
saw	c
my	c
tired	c
face	c
and	c
invited	c
me	c
to	i
her	c
personal	c
changing	i
room	i
.	c

Write	c
me	i
soon	c
to	c
tell	c
me	c
your	c
impression	i

what	c
happened	c
to	c
me	c

For	c
de	i
accommodation	c
I	c
prefer	i
a	c
long	i
cabin	c
because	c
it	i
's	i
more	c
comfortable	c
.	c

I	c
recognise	i
that	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
sleep	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
but	c
in	i
this	c
moment	c
I	c
have	c
a	c
little	c
problem	c
with	c
my	c
right	c
leg	c
and	c
it	c
's	c
better	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
sleep	c
in	c
a	c
bed	c
.	c

I	c
know	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
the	c
chance	c
to	c
do	c
two	c
activities	c
during	c
this	c
time	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
surfing	c
or	c
climbing	c
but	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
think	c
in	i
my	c
helth	i
.	c

In	c
your	c
letter	c
you	c
explain	c
me	i
that	c
all	c
accommodation	c
and	c
travel	c
costs	c
are	c
paid	c
for	c
but	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
know	c
if	c
the	c
life	c
in	i
Camp	c
California	c
is	c
expensive	c
or	c
not	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
bring	c
money	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
very	c
enthousiastic	i
and	c
I	c
attend	i
your	i
answer	i
as	i

is	i
possible	i

In	c
our	c
society	c
the	i
money	c
is	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
aspect	i
to	i
have	i
power	i

If	c
we	c
thing	i
about	c

we	c
will	c
realise	c
that	c
we	c
need	c
money	c
all	c
the	i
day	c

Sometimes	c
,	c
they	c
have	c
to	c
buy	c
something	c
that	c
they	c
need	c
but	c
frequently	i
,	c
they	c
buy	c
only	i
to	c
spend	c
money	c

This	c
is	c
a	c
big	c
problem	c

of	c
families	c
have	i
n't	i
money	c

however	i

We	c
have	c
to	c

to	i
our	c
children	c
the	c
value	c
of	c
the	i
money	c
,	c
to	c
explain	c
the	c
difficulties	c
to	i
earn	i
money	c

I	c
like	c
to	c
sleep	c
in	c

tent	c
under	c
the	c
free	i

since	c
I	c

therfore	i
I	c
would	c

a	c
tent	c

Singing	c
is	c
good	c
for	c
my	c

I	c
choose	c
singing	c

is	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
,	c

I	c
recently	c
had	c
a	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
and	c
had	i
been	i
to	c
your	c
musical	c
show	c
'	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
'	c
but	c
found	c
it	c
very	c
disappointing	c
.	c

It	c
is	i
said	i
that	i
the	i
singers	i
are	i
Danny	i
Brook	i
and	i
Tina	i
Truelove	i
in	i
the	i
advertisement	i
.	c

There	c
was	c
no	c
discount	c
at	c
all	c
which	i
is	i
in	c
contrast	c
with	c
'	c
Discounts	c
Availabe	i
'	c
.	c

After	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
have	c
something	c
in	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
and	c
found	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	i
of	i
no	c
reason	c
.	c

The	c
real	c
show	c
on	i
it	i
owns	i
is	c
really	c
very	c
different	c
to	c
what	c
are	i
mentioned	i
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
unsatisfied	c
and	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
for	c
some	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
a	c
very	c
hard	c
thing	c
to	c
predict	c
.	c

The	c
fashion	c
of	i
nowaday	i
clothings	i
is	i
just	c
keep	i
on	c
changing	c
.	c

They	c
can	c
wear	c
different	c
kinds	c
of	c
clothing	c
,	c
like	i
they	i
design	i
for	i
themselves	i
or	i
those	i
like	i
history	i
can	i
wear	i
those	i
of	i
victorian	i
time	i
and	i
in	i
different	i
countries	i
.	c

As	c
different	c
kinds	c
of	c
farbics	i
will	i
be	i
invented	i
&	i
the	i
clothings	i
will	i
never	i
be	i
just	i
cotton	i
as	i
always	i
been	i
seen	i
.	c

Maybe	c
paper	c
can	c
also	c
be	i
a	i
farbic	i
use	i
for	i
make	i
clothings	c
and	c
for	c
those	c
who	c
like	c
to	c
wear	c
new	c
clothes	i
everyday	i
.	c

They	c
can	c
be	c
thrown	c
away	c
after	c
wearing	i
it	c
and	i
light	c
enough	c
to	c
be	c
carried	c
around	c
whenever	c
you	c
want	c
to	c
change	i
your	c
wearing	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
let	c
you	c
know	c
our	i
unbelievable	c
experiences	c
which	c
we	c
had	c
when	c
we	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
'	c
OVER	c
THE	c
RAINBOW	c
.	c
'	c

Moreover	c
,	c
he	c
made	c
many	c
mistakes	c
.	c

The	c
show	c
supposed	i
to	c
start	c
at	c
19:30	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
.	c

Because	c
of	c
that	c
,	c
we	c
missed	c
the	c
train	c
and	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
stay	c
one	c
more	c
night	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

We	c
would	c
like	c
you	c
to	c
pay	i
back	i
the	c
fee	i
of	c
the	c
show	i
and	c
pay	c
us	c
that	i
hotel	i
's	i
fee	i
as	c
well	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
recommend	c
you	c
to	i
show	i
that	c
the	c
restaurant	c
is	c
closed	c
on	c
Monday	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
not	c
have	c
dinner	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

Fashion	c
of	c
the	c
Future	c

If	c
you	c
asked	c
the	c
young	c
people	c
what	c
they	c
spend	i
their	i
money	i
the	i
most	i
in	i
,	c
most	c
of	c
them	c
would	c
answer	c
'	c
clothes	c
'	c
.	c

In	i
these	i
days	i
,	c
new	c
fashions	c
have	i
been	i
passing	i
by	i
very	c
quickly	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
short	c
skirts	c
and	c
tops	c
like	c
an	i
under-wear	i
.	c

I	c
suppose	c
that	c
a	c
scientist	c
could	c
invent	c
new	c
kinds	c
of	c
materials	c
which	c
are	c
warm	c
and	c
thick	c
.	c

Next	c
,	c
I	c
predict	c
about	i
patterns	i
of	i
clothes	i
.	c

All	c
our	c
class	c
like	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
beautiful	c
pictures	c
which	c
were	c
drawn	c
by	c
brilliant	c
artists	c
and	c
painters	c
.	c

We	c
saw	c
an	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
and	c
our	c
class	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

It	c
starts	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
March	c
14	c
and	c
we	c
can	c
go	c
there	c
instead	c
of	c
visiting	c
the	c
Science	c
Museum	c
or	c
go	i
shopping	c
.	c

Anyway	c
we	c
can	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
Science	c
Museum	c
on	c
Wednesday	c
afternoon	c
because	c
we	c
have	c
a	i
free	c
time	c
.	c

All	c
our	i
class	i
and	i
me	i
would	c
like	c
to	c
see	c
this	c
show	c
.	c

You	c
know	c
what	c
else	c
?	c

It	c
's	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
because	c
in	c
our	c
fast	i
developing	i
world	c
we	c
have	c
to	c
look	c
fashionable	c
and	c
this	c
kind	c
of	c
show	c
happens	c
quite	c
rare	i
.	c

I	c
think	c
you	c
'll	c
agree	i
that	i
we	i
have	i
changed	i
your	i
programme	i
.	c

As	c
I	c
said	c
we	c
can	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
Science	c
Museum	c
on	c
Wednesday	c
instead	c
of	c
having	c
a	i
free	c
time	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
more	c
and	c
more	c
people	c
will	c
have	c
at	c
least	c
one	c
flat	c
,	i
does	i
n't	i
matter	c
if	c
you	c
are	c
rich	c
or	c
not	c
.	c

The	c
rooms	c
will	c
be	c
designed	c
in	c
a	c
future	i
fashion	i
like	i
less	c
furniture	c
and	c
everything	c
is	i
compact	c
,	i
even	i
TV-set	i
will	c
be	c
on	c
the	c
ciling	i
.	c

The	c
rooms	c
will	c
be	c
much	c
bigger	c
and	c
wider	c
than	c
now	c
,	c
and	c
you	c
can	i
have	c
up	c
to	c
twenty	c
rooms	c
in	c
your	c
own	c
flat	c
,	c
and	c
even	c
swiching	i
on	c
the	c
light	c
by	c
saying	c
only	i
;	i
"	c
light	i
"	c
.	c

If	c
course	c
if	c
you	c
have	c
enough	c
money	c
to	i
let	i
your	i
self	i
live	i
in	c
such	c
apartments	i
,	c
then	c
you	c
can	c
afford	c
it	c
.	c

Well	c
as	c
I	c
said	c
if	i
you	c
're	c
poor	c
,	c
the	c
government	c
still	i
give	i
you	c
the	i
flat	c
but	c
very	i
ugly	c
one	c
,	c
probably	c
with	c
rats	c
in	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
and	c
I	c
wish	i
that	c
the	c
future	c
will	c
bring	c
us	c
a	i
good	c
moments	c
of	i
life	c
where	c
everybody	c
will	c
have	c
home	i
and	c
a	i
warm	c
,	c
friendly	c
family	c
relationships	c
.	c

There	i
problems	c
were	c
;	i
Firstly	i
,	c
the	c
famous	c
actors	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
were	c
n't	c
there	c
for	i
your	c
musical	i
show	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
unhappy	c
to	c
constat	i
that	c
it	i
was	i
different	c
actors	c
this	i
evening	c
.	c

That	c
's	c
why	c
I	c
ask	c
you	c
to	c
give	c
my	i
money	c
back	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

The	i
technology	i
is	c
the	c
future	c
,	c
and	c
the	c
present	c
.	c

All	i
the	i
world	c
is	c
now	c
connected	c
on	i
it	c
.	c

Internet	i
is	c
the	c
"	c
new	c
"	c
revolution	c
of	c
the	i
communication	i
and	c
knowledge	c
.	c

It	i
is	i
now	i
ten	i
years	i
that	i
Internet	i
exists	i
,	c
but	c
we	c
only	c
used	i
it	c
for	c
army	c
and	c
government	c
.	i

The	i
technology	i
means	i
too	i
,	i
every	i
electrical	c
machines	c
,	c
which	c
do	c
n't	c
stop	c
to	i
be	i
developped	i
.	c

Another	c
example	c
,	c
computers	c
,	c
every	c
six	c
months	c
,	i
something	c
better	c
is	c
discovered	i
.	c

Five	c
minutes	c
in	c
the	c
micro-waves	i
and	c
it	c
's	c
ready	c
.	c

The	i
machines	i
have	c
replaced	c
the	c
work	c
of	c
the	i
humains	i
.	c

All	i
our	i
life	c
is	c
symplifying	i
by	c
the	i
machines	c
for	i
not	i
waste	i
the	i
time	i
to	i
work	i
on	i
their	i
developpment	i
.	c

I	c
write	c
you	c
this	c
letter	c
because	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
my	i
experiences	c
of	i
the	c
festival	c
.	c

I	c
have	i
spent	i
two	c
days	c
at	c
the	c
"	c
International	c
Arts	c
Festival	c
"	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
good	c
event	c
but	c
I	c
think	c
some	c
details	i
could	c
be	c
better	c
the	c
next	c
time	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
on	c
the	c
leaflet	c
it	c
was	c
written	c
that	c
there	c
will	i
be	c
stars	c
and	c
artists	c
from	c
around	c
the	c
world	c
but	c
they	c
were	c
only	c
from	c
six	c
different	c
countries	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
small	c
offer	i
;	c
I	c
hope	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
larger	c
the	c
next	c
time	c
.	c

There	c
have	i
also	i
taken	i
place	i
very	c
good	c
attractions	i
like	c
dance	i
shows	c
,	c
the	c
art	c
exhibition	c
and	c
listening	i
to	i
talks	i
by	i
writers	c
,	i

The	c
reasonably-priced	c
weekend	c
ticket	c
was	c
a	c
very	c
good	c
idea	c
.	c

At	i
last	i
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
suggest	i
a	c
"	c
pony-ride	c
"	c
for	c
children	c
,	c
to	c
attract	c
families	c
.	c

Best	c
regards	c

I	c
think	c
there	c
are	c
some	c
possibilities	i
for	c
earning	c
money	c
.	c

To	i
teach	i
pupils	c
is	c
not	c
easy	c
,	c
of	c
course	c
.	c

So	c
it	c
would	i
be	c
easier	c
for	c
the	c
teacher	c
!	i

It	i
is	i
also	i
not	c
a	i
dirty	c
work	c
,	i
I	c
mean	c
you	c
do	c
not	c
have	c
to	c
clean	c
rooms	c
or	c
toilets	i
of	i
other	i
people	i
!	c

To	c
be	c
a	c
good	c
teacher	c
you	c
especially	i
need	c
patient	i
and	c
good	c
nerves	c
!	c

And	c
the	c
money	c
you	c
get	c
is	c
not	c
less	i

So	c
,	c
if	c
you	c
like	c
to	c
b	i
with	c
people	c
and	c
help	c
them	c
and	c
if	c
you	c
have	c
talent	i
to	c
explain	c
good	i
then	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
the	i
best	c
,	i
if	c
you	c
offer	i
your	c
help	c
to	c
the	c
people	c
!	c

Here	c
I	c
will	c
answear	i
all	c
the	c
questions	c
that	c
you	c
ask	i
me	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
will	c
ask	c
you	c
other	i
things	c
that	c
you	c
dind't	i
mention	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
free	c
time	c
I	c
like	c
to	c
play	c
golf	c
and	c
swim	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
I	c
'm	c
good	c
playing	i
golf	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c

Most	c
of	c
the	c
time	c
when	c
we	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
shopping	c
Center	i
we	c
have	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
fun	c
,	i
we	i
go	c
to	c
stores	c
to	c
see	i
cloth	i
,	c
we	c
also	c
eat	c
something	c
like	c
ice	c
cream	c
or	c
French	c
Fries	c
,	c
but	c
not	i
all	i
the	i
time	i
shopping	i
is	i
enjoyable	i
.	c

In	i
that	i
cases	i
is	i
when	i
we	c
do	c
n't	c
enjoy	c
shopping	c
because	c
we	c
ca	c
n't	c
find	c
what	c
we	c
are	c
looking	c
for	c
and	c
we	c
have	c
a	c
bad	c
time	c
in	c
the	c
shopping	c
center	i

Dear	c
Mrs.	c
Ryan	c
.	i

I	c
'm	c
very	c
happy	c
to	c
know	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
the	c
only	c
month	c
available	c
from	i
me	c
to	c
travel	c
is	c
July	c
.	c

I	c
finish	c
my	c
classes	c
on	c
the	c
25th	c
of	c
June	c
and	c
August	c
is	c
for	i
going	c
with	c
my	c
parents	c
to	c
France	c
.	c

This	c
has	i
been	i
scheduled	i
3	c
months	c
ago	c
.	c

While	c
I	c
'm	c
stayin	i
there	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
practise	c
tennis	c
and	c
basketball	c
,	c
as	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
playing	c
both	c
sports	c
all	c
my	c
life	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
both	c
.	c

There	c
is	c
one	c
question	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
about	c
the	c
Camp	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

From	c
my	c
point	c
of	c
view	c
,	c
the	c
real	c
question	c
is	c
:	c
Who	c
said	c
that	c
is	c
enjoyable	c
?	c

Maybe	c
for	c
women	c
,	c
but	c
not	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
know	c
that	c
this	c
sounds	c
horrible	c
,	c
but	c
sometimes	c
it	c
's	c
what	c
really	c
happens	c
.	c

Sometimes	c
that	c
means	c
a	c
complete	c
tour	c
around	c
all	c
the	c
fashion	c
shops	c
in	c
town	c
.	c

The	c
Sports	i
Shop	i
.	c

You	c
cannot	c
lose	i
the	i
time	c
because	c
all	c
the	c
other	c
shops	c
could	c
be	c
closed	c
when	c
you	c
arrive	c
.	c

That	c
's	c
men	c
's	c
intention	c
.	c

Another	c
point	c
is	c
to	c
go	c
a	i
big	c
area	c
.	c

A	c
huge	c
que	i
that	c
lasts	c
half	c
an	c
hour	c
or	c
more	c
and	c
finishes	c
with	c
you	c
completely	c
freaked	c
out	c
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
for	c
me	c
to	i
go	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
enjoyable	c
at	c
all	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

According	c
to	c
the	c
advertisement	c
you	c
gave	i
,	c
there	c
have	i
been	c
some	c
important	c
differents	i
.	i

I	c
would	c
be	c
grateful	c
if	c
you	c
do	i
it	i
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
that	c
it	c
is	c
not	c
useful	c
for	c
you	c
and	c
your	c
theather	i
to	c
cheat	c
to	i
your	c
customers	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
fordwad	i
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c

It	c
affects	c
everyone	c
who	c
live	i
in	i
this	c
planet	c
and	c
every	c
activity	c
made	i
in	i
it	c
.	c

I	c
use	c
technology	c
every	c
moment	i
but	c
I	c
did	c
not	c
realise	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
to	c
this	c
we	c
use	c
the	c
net	c
to	c
comunicate	i
with	c
some	c
friends	c
we	c
have	c
in	c
U.S.A.	i
It	c
's	c
really	c
amazing	c
.	c

Apart	c
from	c
this	c
,	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
spent	c
my	c
free	c
time	c
in	i
technology	c

Dear	c
Mister	i
,	c

I	c
recently	c
had	c
the	c
opportunity	c
to	c
see	c
"	c
over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
"	c
which	i
was	c
played	i
last	c
week	c
in	c
the	c
Circle	c

In	c
fact	c
,	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
did	c
n't	c
play	i
or	c
appear	c
on	c
stage	c
last	c
Tuesday	c
,	c
the	i
role	c
was	c
played	c
by	c
another	c
-	c
a	c
quite	c
bad	c
-	c
actor	c
,	c
less	c
famous	c
than	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
.	c

I	c
ca	c
n't	c
accept	c
waiting	c
so	c
long	c
for	c
the	c
result	c
I	c
had	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
apparently	c
closed	c
and	c
I	c
'm	c
asking	c
you	c
why	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
can	c
see	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
some	c
(	c
volontary	i
?	c
)	c
mistakes	c
on	i
the	c
advertisment	i
you	c
made	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
sure	c
we	c
'll	c
find	c
a	c
compromise	c
and	c
I	c
'm	c
really	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
,	c
and	c
half	c
a	c
week	c
later	c
,	c
all	c
the	c
school	c
knew	c
about	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
a	c
strange	c
feeling	c
then	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
just	c
amazing	c
to	c
notice	i
how	c
money	c
can	c
attract	c
so	c
much	i
people	c
.	c

I	c
started	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
new	c
friends	c
,	c
they	c
all	c
wanted	c
to	c
be	c
my	c
best	c
friend	c
.	c

Actually	c
,	c
my	i
best	i
friend	i
would	i
still	i
remain	i
Pat	i
,	c
even	c
if	c
he	c
failed	c
me	c
.	c

They	c
did	c
n't	c
stop	c
giving	c
me	c
advice	c
or	c
telling	c
me	c
what	c
to	c
do	c
with	c
my	c
money	c
.	c

I	c
always	c
has	i
been	c
involved	c
in	c
many	c
differents	i
associations	c
,	c
which	c
are	c
fighting	c
against	c
AIDS	c
or	c
cancer	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
:	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
ask	c
about	c
your	c
advertisement	c
and	c
theatre	c
show	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
a	c
student	c
in	c
Liverpool	c
,	c
and	c
recently	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
week	c
's	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
there	c
was	c
only	c
one	c
actor	c
that	c
was	c
different	c
from	c
your	c
advertisement	c
.	c

Second	c
,	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
exactly	i
seven	c
thirty	c
in	c
the	c
evening	c
.	c

I	c
wasted	c
time	i
too	i
much	i
for	i
waiting	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
not	c
good	c
to	i
me	c
,	c
cause	i
I	c
had	c
only	c
one	c
week	i
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
absolutely	i
different	c
from	c
your	c
leaflet	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

Lo	c
Son	c
Lin	c
.	c

Have	c
you	c
ever	c
seen	c
the	c
film	c
star	c
wars	c
?	c

I	c
think	c
the	c
people	c
will	c
wear	c
convenient	c
clothes	c
with	c
simple	i
design	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
.	c

And	c
they	c
will	c
use	c
soft	c
cozy	c
cloths	i
like	c
cotton	c
and	c
silk	c
.	c

Just	c
imagine	c
the	c
way	i
of	i
future	i
people	i
's	i
life	i
.	c

And	c
you	c
can	c
see	c
the	i
their	c
clothes	c
also	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c

Your	c
letter	c
contains	c
few	i
questions	c
about	c
detailes	i
of	c
my	c
holiday	c
which	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
clarify	i
for	c
you	c
.	c

The	c
first	c
is	c
time	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
only	c
able	c
to	c
go	c
on	c
holiday	c
in	c
July	c
,	c
because	c
the	i
other	i
time	c
I	c
have	c
college	c
,	c
which	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
be	i
missed	i
.	c

I	c
old	i
rather	c
prefer	i
stay	c
in	c
log	c
cabins	c
than	c
live	c
in	c
tents	c
.	c

What	i
about	i
basketball	i
is	i
.	c

Can	c
you	c
inform	c
me	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
should	i
I	i
have	c
and	c
can	c
I	c
have	c
some	c
information	c
about	c
prices	c
to	i
visit	i
local	c
places	c
of	c
interests	i
.	c

At	i
the	i
end	i
I	c
would	c
like	c
ones	i
more	c
to	c
say	c
thanks	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
and	c
I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
by	c
post	c
with	c
all	c
detailes	i
about	c
holiday	i
.	c

Yours	c
faithfyly	i

And	c
what	c
you	i
have	c
.	i

You	c
've	c
got	c
more	c
stress	c
,	c
you	c
feel	c
fed	c
up	c
and	c
finaly	i
when	c
you	c
got	i
home	c
you	c
think	c
that	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
that	i
enjoyable	c
as	c
you	c
thought	c
.	c

You	c
should	i
walk	i
miles	c
around	c
store	i
to	c
find	c
what	c
you	c
wanted	i
.	c

Yes	c
,	c
there	c
is	c
big	i
plus	c
for	i
big	i
store	c
of	c
course	c
.	c

You	c
can	c
find	c
everything	c
in	c
one	c
place	c
,	c
instead	i
of	i
small	c
shops	c
which	c
is	i
specialised	i
on	i
one	c
product	c
.	c

Internet	i
is	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
issue	i
at	i
this	c
problem	c
.	c

Dear	c
Ryan	c

I	c
have	c
discussed	c
it	c
with	c
my	c
boss	c
but	c
he	c
allowed	c
me	c
to	c
go	c
on	c
a	c
holiday	c
only	c
in	c
July	c
.	c

And	c
about	c
accommodation	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
.	c

I	c
know	c
that	c
staying	c
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
is	c
more	c
convinient	i
but	c
I	c
just	c
want	c
to	c
feel	i
wilder	i
experience	c
.	c

While	c
I	c
am	c
at	c
the	c
camp	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
enjoy	i
swimming	c
and	c
photography	c
.	c

It	c
will	c
be	c
a	c
wonderful	c
experience	c
to	c
swim	c
in	c
a	c
lake	c
and	c
I	c
can	c
relax	c
and	c
enjoy	c
fresh	i
air	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
about	c
the	c
weather	c
in	c
the	c
camp	c
area	c
because	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
what	c
kinds	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
bring	c
.	c

Clark	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
travel	c
only	c
July	i
because	c
my	c
son	c
's	c
school	c
is	c
going	c
to	c
finish	c
at	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
June	c
,	c
so	c
it	c
is	c
impossible	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
travel	c
during	c
on	i
June	c
.	c

Apart	c
from	c
that	c
I	i
work	c
in	c
an	c
international	c
tourism	c
agency	c
and	c
August	c
is	c
the	c
busiest	c
month	c
of	c
the	c
year	c
so	i
July	c
is	c
the	c
best	c
choice	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

My	c
favourite	c
hobby	c
is	c
photography	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
it	c
.	c

Besides	c
,	c
I	c
really	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
,	i
approxiametely	i
how	c
much	c
money	c
should	i
I	i
take	c
with	c
me	c
?	i

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
very	c
successful	c
concert	c
and	c
probably	c
you	c
have	c
heard	c
the	c
singer	c
's	c
name	c
before	c
who	i
is	c
called	c
Tina	c
.	c

Everyday	i
I	c
worked	c
for	c
two	c
hours	c
in	c
a	c
shop	c
to	i
sale	i
tickets	c
.	c

I	c
also	c
helped	c
the	i
singer	i
's	i
some	i
special	i
demands	i
which	c
were	c
n't	c
so	c
difficult	c
to	c
do	i
.	c

She	c
was	c
very	c
nice	c
and	c
friendly	c
.	c

After	c
the	c
concert	c
I	i
was	c
absolutely	c
exhausted	c
but	c
the	c
thing	c
is	c
I	c
will	c
never	c
forget	c
this	c
experience	c
.	c

The	c
best	c
thing	c
was	c
of	c
course	c
Tina	i
.	c

So	c
,	c
my	i
news	i
are	i
finished	i
.	c

Write	c
me	i
back	c
soon	c
.	c

Love	c
from	c
,	c

Dear	c
Helen	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
my	c
prize	c
!	c

I	c
can	c
only	c
have	c
some	c
holidays	i
in	c
July	c
from	c
the	c
3rd	c
to	c
the	c
17th	c
with	c
my	c
husband	c
at	c
the	c
same	c
time	c
,	i
that	i
is	c
why	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
during	c
those	c
two	c
weeks	c
.	c

For	c
the	c
accommodation	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
have	c
tents	i
because	c
I	c
used	i
to	i
travel	i
in	i
Campsites	i
and	c
I	c
love	c
it	c
during	c
summer	c
,	c
just	i
to	i
change	i
the	i
customs	i
!	c
!	c

My	c
second	c
activity	c
is	c
painting	c
because	c
I	c
love	c
art	c
and	c
art	c
history	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
is	i
better	c
to	c
join	i
one	c
sport	c
and	c
one	c
"	i
soft	i
leisure	i
"	i
and	c
I	c
do	c
not	c
really	c
want	c
to	c
involve	c
myself	c
in	c
a	c
new	c
activity	c
that	c
I	c
do	i
n't	i
know	i
for	i
my	c
holidays	c
.	c

See	c
you	c
soon	c
!	c

Yours	c
Sincerely	i

You	i
decide	c
to	i
go	i
in	i
town	i
or	i
during	i
holidays	i
to	i
move	i
in	i
a	i
"	i
shopping	i
destination	i
"	i
,	c
that	c
is	i
mean	i
that	c
you	c
need	c
something	c
special	c
for	c
you	i
or	c
someone	c
else	c
.	c

That	c
's	c
why	c
it	c
should	c
be	c
a	c
great	c
day	c
!	c

Save	c
some	c
money	c
to	c
go	c
for	i
shopping	c
in	c
Paris	c
or	c
Roma	c
and	c
see	c
how	c
is	i
the	c
French	c
or	c
Italian	c
fashion	c
on	i
yourself	i
!	c
and	i
after	c
that	c
you	c
can	c
make	i
a	i
stop	i
in	i
the	c
Duty-free	i
and	i
buy	c
some	c
chipper	i
souvenirs	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
have	c
no	c
money	c
and	c
a	c
friend	c
ask	i
you	c
to	c
come	i
for	i
shopping	c
,	c
it	c
should	c
be	c
boring	c
!	c
and	i
you	c
become	i
jealous	c
against	i
him	c
and	c
want	c
him	c
to	c
do	c
that	i
quickly	c
!	c
or	i
you	c
are	i
going	i
to	i
get	c
nervous	i
!	c

And	c
you	c
can	c
find	c
too	i
much	i
people	c
in	c
shops	i
,	c
it	c
is	c
too	c
hot	c
or	c
you	c
can	i
not	i
have	i
your	i
right	c
size	c
or	c
the	c
right	c
colour	c
or	c
flavour	c
--	c
-	c
then	c
you	c
get	c
angry	c
!	c
or	i
you	c
decide	c
to	i
not	i
spend	i
money	i
in	i
shopping	c
today	c
,	c
but	c
in	i
front	i
of	i
the	i
shop	i
.	c

What	c
is	c
going	c
on	c
?	c
?	c

So	c
,	c
you	c
'd	c
better	c
to	i
stay	i
home	i
today	c
...	c

Firstly	c
,	c
your	c
advertisement	c
said	c
the	c
actor	c
would	c
be	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
boring	c
that	c
nothing	c
happend	i
such	i
a	c
long	c
time	c
on	c
the	c
stage	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
not	c
believe	c
that	c
.	c

This	i
are	c
too	c
many	c
negatives	i
points	c
for	c
one	c
evening	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
afraid	c
,	i
but	i
I	c
want	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

Your	i
faithfully	c

This	c
is	c
not	c
a	c
tabu	i
by	i
me	c
and	c
my	c
friends	c
.	c

Maybe	c
in	c
500	c
years	c
,	c
some	c
people	c
will	c
live	c
on	c
the	i
Mars	c
and	c
then	c
,	i
they	c
have	i
to	c
wear	c
other	c
kind	i
of	c
clothes	c
.	c

They	c
just	c
look	c
funny	c
!	c

I	c
have	c
been	c
working	c
hard	c
here	c
in	c
Portugal	c
and	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
on	c
holiday	c
just	c
in	i
next	c
july	i
.	c

Because	c
of	c
it	i
I	c
believe	c
it	i
is	c
the	c
best	c
date	i
for	c
travel	i
You	c
asked	c
me	c
about	c
accommodations	i
or	i
Camp	c
California	c
.	c

Another	c
question	c
that	c
you	c
asked	c
me	c
was	c
about	c
two	c
activities	c
I	c
will	c
have	c
the	c
chance	c
to	c
do	c
there	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
something	c
about	c
money	c
and	c
clothes	c
.	c

Are	c
they	c
inclued	i
in	c
the	c
prize	c
?	c

I	c
'd	c
prefere	i
if	i
you	c
give	i
me	c
this	c
information	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
you	c
can	c
.	c

Rui	c
Veloso	c

I	c
suppose	c
you	c
know	c
about	c
"	i
Portugal	c
Pop	c
Concert	c
"	c
that	c
happened	c
here	c
in	c
Rio	c
de	c
Mouro	c
last	c
month	c
,	c
are	i
n't	i
you	c
?	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
marvellous	c
concert	c
and	c
there	c
were	c
about	c
100,000	c
people	c
there	c
.	c

I	c
worked	c
as	c
a	c
receptionist	c
in	c
the	c
Vip	i
room	c
and	c
I	c
needed	c
to	c
look	c
very	c
happy	c
during	i
all	c
time	i
,	c
what	i
was	c
n't	c
very	c
difficult	c
.	c

You	c
will	i
ca	i
n't	i
believe	c
how	c
many	c
famous	c
people	c
I	c
known	i
.	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
dream	c
and	c
she	c
was	c
amazing	c
with	i
me	i
.	c

I	c
did	c
n't	c
tell	c
you	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
helped	c
in	i
this	c
concert	c
just	c
by	i
a	i
chance	i
.	c

I	c
said	c
"	c
yes	c
"	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
sure	c
it	c
was	c
the	c
best	c
decision	c
of	c
my	c
life	c
.	c

Rui	c

Dear	c
Mr./Mrs	c
:	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
excited	c
about	c
it	c
!	c

Fortunately	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
heard	c
that	c
weather	i
is	c
beautiful	c
in	c
California	c
during	c
that	c
month	c
.	c

Singing	c
is	c
something	c
I	c
have	c
enjoyed	c
since	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
little	c
child	c
.	c

Is	c
it	c
better	c
to	c
take	c
cash	c
or	c
a	c
credit	c
card	c
?	c

Cordially	i
yours	i
,	i

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c

The	c
best	c
way	c
to	c
go	c
shopping	c
is	c
when	i
you	i
think	i
in	c
advance	c
what	i
you	c
really	c
want	c
to	c
buy	c
and	c

Recommendations	c

June	c
2000	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
:	c

I	c
will	c
be	c
very	c
happy	c
to	c
travel	c
on	i
july	i
because	c
in	c
that	c
date	i
I	c
am	c
going	c
to	c
have	c
my	c
holidays	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
will	c
not	c
have	c
to	c
ask	c
permition	i
from	c
my	c
work	i
.	c

At	c
the	c
same	c
time	c
,	c
on	i
july	i
is	i
my	i
birthday	i
,	c
so	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
nice	c
to	c
celebrated	i
there	i
.	c

I	c
will	i
prefer	c
to	c
have	i
my	i
accomodation	i
in	c
a	c
tent	c
,	c
couse	i
in	c
that	c
way	c
I	c
can	c
feel	c
more	i
clouse	i
to	c
the	i
nature	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
can	c
remember	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
scout	i
girl	i
.	c

Sleeping	c
in	c
tent	i
is	c
much	c
more	c
exiting	i
and	c
clousy	i
than	c
a	i
log	c
cabin	c
.	c

The	c
reason	c
of	i
my	c
option	i
for	i
singing	c
is	c
couse	i
I	c
feel	c
embarrest	i
about	c
my	c
voice	c
,	c
so	c
maybe	c
I	c
could	c
get	i
it	i
better	i
.	c

I	c
will	i
like	c
to	c
have	c
more	c
information	c
about	c
the	c
prices	c
of	c
the	c
clothes	c
and	c
souvenires	i
.	c

Thankeaw	i
for	c
givin	i
me	c
this	c
oportunity	i
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
that	c
has	c
been	c
presented	i
in	c
the	c

As	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
anxious	c
to	c
see	c
that	c
show	c
,	c
I	c
planned	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
in	i
the	i
last	c
holiday	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
completely	c
disappointed	c
with	c
that	i
.	c

Then	c
,	c
to	c
complete	c
this	c
terrible	c
night	c
,	c
the	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c

I	c
wonder	c
you	i
could	c
explain	c
me	i

Every	c

the	c
growth	c
of	c
the	i
modern	c

increases	c
in	c
the	c
whole	c
world	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
becoming	c
essential	c
in	c
everybody	c
's	c
life	c

The	c
huge	c
growth	c
of	c
technology	c
has	c
brought	c
lots	c
of	c
good	c
aspects	i
to	i
my	c
life	c
,	c
like	c
the	c
facility	i
to	c
be	c
informed	c
about	c
everything	c
that	c
is	c
happening	c
around	c
the	c
world	c
with	c
the	c
best	c
image	c
in	i
my	c
cab	c
TV	c
and	c
in	i
my	c
computer	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
the	c
excess	c
of	c
comodity	i
can	c
led	i
us	c
,	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
,	c
to	c
a	c
completely	c
"	c
cold	c
"	c
world	c
,	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
distance	c
between	i
people	i
that	i
can	i
be	i
caused	i
.	c

Even	c
worse	c
it	i
was	c
the	c
delay	c
,	i
the	i
Show	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
instead	c
of	c
19:30	c
,	c
that	i
drove	c
me	c
mad	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
a	c
student	c
visiting	c
London	c
for	c
one	c
week	c
only	c
and	c
I	c
asked	c
for	c
discount	i
ticket	c
,	i
I	c
could	c
not	c
get	c
it	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
really	c
unfair	c
,	i
I	c
paid	c
normal	i
price	c
.	c

Also	c
there	c
was	c
another	c
problem	c
,	i
I	c
planned	c
to	c
visit	c
the	c
Theatre	c
restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
I	c
could	c
not	c
,	c
was	i
closed	c
because	c
it	c
has	i
been	i
refurbished	c
and	c
redecorated	c
.	c

The	c
only	c
thing	c
to	c
do	c
is	c
:	c
to	c
compensate	c
me	c
,	c
send	c
my	i
money	c
back	c
,	i
I	c
am	c
sending	c
my	c
ticket	c
for	c

Hope	c
you	c

be	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
pleased	c
that	c
I	c
born	i
under	i
such	c
good	c
tecnologies	i
like	i
my	c
parents	c
did	c
n't	c
have	c
the	c
same	c
luck	c
.	c

My	c
life	c
is	c
much	c
easier	c
with	c
all	c
these	i
stuffs	i
above	i
mentioned	i
-	c
tecnology	i
and	c
science	c
.	c

Computers	c
have	c
changed	c
people	c
's	c
life	i
,	i
many	i
of	c
them	c
can	c
work	c
from	c
home	c
,	c
they	c
do	c
n't	c
need	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
their	c
offices	c
.	c

Internet	i
is	c
very	c
handy	c
,	c
you	c
can	c
buy	i
,	c
send	c
e-mail	c
messages	c
,	c
or	c
even	c
have	c
sex	c
,	c
that	i
is	c
really	c
funny	c
.	c

There	c
is	c
ambiguity	i
about	c
technology	c
-	c
can	i
bring	i
good	c
things	c
and	c
terrible	c
things	c
as	c
well	c
.	c

The	c
bad	c
side	c
is	c
to	i
use	i
tecnology	i
for	c
war	c
-	c
missiles	c
,	c
weapons	c
,	c
etc	c
....	c

I	c
believe	c
that	c
people	c
should	c
take	c
just	i
good	i
advantages	i
that	i

Sometimes	c
I	c
think	c

Thanks	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c

I	c
have	c
reading	i
the	c
letter	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
surprised	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c

About	c
the	c
time	c
when	c
I	c
like	i
to	c
travel	c
is	i
only	i
July	c
,	c
because	c
in	c
the	c
summer	c
is	i
it	i
very	c
busy	c
at	c
work	c
.	c

At	i
second	i
,	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
like	c
tents	c
and	c
I	c
do	i
n't	i
get	c
used	c
to	c
it	i
,	c
so	c
I	c
prefer	c
log	c
cabins	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
summer	c
I	c
'm	c
sailing	c
races	i
almost	c
every	c
weekend	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
my	c
own	c
sailing	c
clothes	c
.	c

Thanks	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

With	i
me	i
is	i
everything	i
fine	i
and	c
the	c
pop	c
concert	c
was	c
great	c
.	c

You	c
always	c
walk	c
from	c
side	c
to	c
side	c
to	i
move	i
things	c
and	c
there	c
's	c
no	c
break	c
.	c

Some	c
other	c
work	c
what	i
I	c
have	i
done	i
was	c
to	c
lead	c
the	c
people	c
to	c
there	i
places	c
.	c

We	c
have	i
worked	i
the	c
whole	c
day	c
and	c
luckily	c
at	c
least	c
we	c
had	c
some	c
food	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
see	c
the	c
famous	c
singers	c
in	i
reality	i
they	c
are	c
different	c
and	c
the	i
most	c
singers	c
they	i
have	i
n't	i
time	i
for	i
you	i
.	c

Another	c
thing	c
I	c
have	i
done	i
was	c
the	c
make	i
up	i
only	i
for	c
about	c
fifteen	c
minutes	c
.	c

That	c
was	c
very	c
nice	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
expected	i
that	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
very	c
nice	c
day	c
with	i
great	c
experience	c
.	c

At	i
first	i
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
go	i
travel	c
on	i
July	c
,	c
because	c
before	c
them	i
I	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
time	c
to	c
travel	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
to	c
finish	c
my	c
study	i
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
log	i
cabin	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
more	c
convenient	c
than	c
in	c
tents	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
to	i
draw	i
some	c
beautiful	c
sceanary	i
and	c
to	i
take	i
some	c
picture	i
are	i
very	i
good	c
experience	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
so	c
much	i
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
invitation	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Do	c
you	c
like	c
the	i
shopping	c
?	c

Generally	c
many	c
women	c
would	i
like	i
the	i
shopping	c
include	i
me	c
.	c

Perhaps	c
you	c
have	c
an	c
experience	i
unpleased	i
.	c

You	c
could	c
go	c
shopping	c
for	c
some	c
rest	c
to	c
the	c
high	c
street	c
or	c
a	c
department	c
store	c
.	c

Then	c
you	c
could	c
find	c
the	c
cheapest	c
good	i
and	c
in	c
that	c
case	c
,	c
you	c
probably	c
buy	c
it	c
needlessly	c
.	c

Both	c
cases	c
are	i
often	i
happened	i
in	i
shopping	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
want	c
to	c
regret	c
about	i
shopping	c
,	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
make	c
a	c
shopping	c
list	c
firstly	i
before	c
going	c
shopping	c
.	c

Then	c
you	c
should	c
check	c
the	c
price	c
and	c
the	c
quality	c
of	c
the	c
good	i
.	c

One	c
more	c
thing	c
I	c
recommend	c
you	c
is	c
to	c
leave	c
your	c
credit	c
card	c
at	c
home	c
if	c
you	c
are	c
going	i
only	i
a	i
window	c
shopping	c

manger	c

Circle	c

Mr	c

Caen	c
,	c
Saturday	c
June	c
17th	c

It	c
seemed	c
very	c
attractive	c
and	c
the	c
different	i
informations	i
on	c
the	c
ad	c
pushed	c
me	c
into	c
going	c
to	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
not	c
keen	c
on	c
liars	c
Mr	i
Smith	c
and	i
I	c
think	c
that	c
you	c
've	c
lied	c
to	c
such	i
naive	c
tourist	i
like	c
us	c
:	c
some	c
brilliant	c
actors	c
were	c
supposed	c
to	c
play	c
the	c
part	i
and	c
we	c
only	c
had	c
different	c
and	i
pityful	i
ones	c
.	c

I	c
ought	c
not	c
to	c
talk	c
about	c
the	c
restaurant	c
closed	i
for	c
no	c
apparent	c
reasons	c

You	c
had	c
promised	c
a	c
perfect	c
evening	c
but	c
I	c
spend	i
an	i
horrible	c
one	c
and	i
you	c
ruined	c
my	c
holiday	c
!	c

What	i
are	i
you	i
mistaken	i
us	i
for	i
,	c
Mr	c
Smith	c
?	c

Foolish	c
idiots	c
?	c

That	c
's	c
why	c
I	c
want	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
!	c

Now	c
!	c

Otherweise	i
I	c
'll	c
have	c
to	c
put	c
some	c
others	i
ads	c
in	i
London	c
saying	c
that	c
your	c
show	c
is	c
just	c
a	c
fake	i
!	c

To	c
begin	c
with	c
,	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
underline	c
how	c
the	c
place	i
of	c
technology	c
has	c
increased	c
since	i
a	c
couple	c
of	c
years	c
.	c

With	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
the	c
Second	c
world	c
war	c
and	c
the	c
economic	i
prosperity	c
many	i
goods	c
like	c
TV	i
,	c
washing-machine	i
,	c
etc.	c
became	c
cheaper	c
and	c
available	i
.	c

Do	c
they	c
affect	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
?	c

I	c
spend	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
free	i
time	c
watching	c
TV	c
,	c
or	c
surfing	c
on	c
the	c
Internet	c
or	c
playing	c
the	i
computer	c
.	c

Maybe	c
it	c
change	i
me	c
into	c
a	c
kind	c
of	c
self-centered	i
person	c
,	c
a	c
loner	c

Furthermore	c

In	c

Hi	c
Kim	c
!	c

How	c
are	c
you	c
?	c

It	c
has	c
been	c
so	c
long	c
since	c
I	c
wrote	c
to	c
you	c
for	i
last	c
time	c
...	c

It	c
was	c
great	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
got	c
my	c
entrance	i
for	c
free	c
!	c

This	c
was	c
the	c
best	c
part	c
because	c
when	c
everyone	c
was	c
gone	c
,	c
Billy	c
Joel	c
arrived	c
to	c
give	c
his	c
support	c
to	c
the	c
beginers	i
!	c
!	c
!	c

What	c
was	c
a	c
fella	i
like	c
that	c
doing	c
in	c
such	c
a	c
place	c
?	c

I	c
could	c
n't	c
belive	i
my	c
very	i
eyes	c
...	c

Jane	c

I	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
the	c
discount	c
for	c
the	c
tickets	c
were	i
not	c
available	c
,	c
and	c
especially	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
people	c
were	c
disappointed	c
that	c
they	c
can	i
not	i
visit	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
,	c
due	c
to	c
the	c
cleaner	c
forgotten	i
to	c
clean	c
up	c
the	c
mess	c
from	c
the	c
previous	c
party	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
,	i
although	i
he	c
's	c
one	c
of	c
my	c
best	c
friend	i
,	c
but	i
sometimes	c
,	c
he	c
's	c
a	c
real	c
pain	i
in	i
a	i
butt	i
.	c

Pat	c
and	c
I	c
knew	c
each	c
other	c
very	c
well	c
,	c
because	c
we	c
are	c
neighbours	c
,	c
so	c
since	c
we	c
've	c
met	c
,	c
Pat	c
and	c
I	c
always	i
got	i
on	c
very	c
well	c
.	c

Even	c
though	c
Pat	c
has	c
got	c
a	c
great	c
sense	c
of	c
humour	c
and	c
wonderful	c
personality	c
,	c
he	c
'll	c
never	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
keep	c
any	c
secreats	i
for	i
anyone	c
,	c
even	c
himself	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
everything	c
was	c
not	c
performed	c
as	c
you	c
had	c
advertised	c
.	c

Even	c
though	c
they	c
performed	c
their	c
parts	c
excellently	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
disappointed	c
about	c
your	c
incorrect	c
advertisement	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
the	c
musical	c
was	c
not	c
started	c
on	c
time	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
It	c
was	c
started	c
45	c
minutes	c
later	c
.	c

thirdly	i
,	c
there	c
was	c
no	c
discount	c
about	i
my	c
ticket	c
and	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
of	c
being	c
repaired	c
.	c

Finally	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
perfectly	i
terrible	c
evening	c
out	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
do	c
that	c
,	c
I	c
will	c
tell	c
public	i
what	i
you	c
are	c
wrong	c
in	c
your	c
advertisement	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
yong	i
child	c
,	c
I	c
used	c
to	c
be	c
interested	c
in	c
reading	c
a	i
scientific	i
fiction	i
.	c

Interestingly	c
,	c
nowadays	c
,	c
I	c
live	c
in	c
the	c
scientific	c
world	c
which	c
I	c
read	c
in	i
the	c
book	i
.	c

Probably	c
,	c
I	c
started	c
useing	i
mobile-phone	i
5	c
years	c
ago	c
.	c

I	c
used	c
to	c
write	c
a	c
letter	c
to	c
my	c
friends	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
After	i
appearing	i
Internet	i
,	c
I	i
've	i
sent	i
e-mail	c
to	c
my	c
friends	c
.	c

I	c
just	c
check	c
my	c
e-mail	c
before	c
going	c
to	c
bed	c
everyday	i
.	c

When	c
I	c
received	c
your	c
letter	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
surprised	c
and	c
happy	c
because	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
remember	c
that	i
I	i
did	i
this	c
competition	c
.	c

First	c
I	c
can	c
travel	c
only	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
,	i
I	c
will	c
finish	c
school	c
at	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
June	c
and	c
I	c
will	c
pass	i
my	c
exam	c
in	c
Septemeber	i
;	c
so	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
repeat	i
it	i
a	c
lot	c
during	c
the	c
month	c
of	c
August	c
.	c

To	c
answer	c
your	c
second	c
question	c
,	c
I	c
choose	c
the	i
accomodation	i
in	c
tents	i
because	c
I	c
like	c
to	c
sleep	c
outside	c
.	c

I	c
tried	i
the	i
golf	c
twice	c
,	i
I	c
'm	c
really	c
bad	c
but	c
I	c
hope	c
to	c
do	i
much	c
progress	c
.	i

Can	c
I	c
wash	c
any	c
clothes	c
there	c
?	c

How	c
many	i
money	c
will	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
with	c
me	c
?	c

Please	c
phone	c
me	c
to	c
answer	c
my	c
two	c
questions	c
.	c

Thanks	c
for	c
all	i

Hello	c
Kim	c

As	c
you	c
asked	c
me	c
I	c
will	c
tell	c
you	c
about	c
the	c
pop	c
concert	c
of	i
last	c
month	c
.	c

With	c
my	c
friend	c
Miko	c
we	i
looked	c
for	c
a	i
little	i
job	i
during	i
a	i
week-end	i
and	c
one	c
evening	c
we	c
met	c
a	c
guy	c
who	c
wanted	c
to	c
buy	i
some	i
drinks	c
in	i
the	c
pop	c
concert	c
and	c
so	c
we	c
told	c
him	c
that	c
we	c
were	i
agree	i
to	c
help	c
him	c
at	c
the	c
bar	c
.	c

At	c
the	c
end	c
we	c
have	i
1200.	i
-	i
of	i
benefice	i
and	c
each	c
us	i
take	i
400.	i
-	i
for	c
himself	c

I	c
particulary	i
like	i
seeing	c
all	c
this	i
people	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
meet	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
new	c
friend	i
there	c
.	c

Write	c
to	c
me	c
soon	c
and	c
tell	c
me	c
if	c
you	c
want	c
to	c
join	c
us	c
for	c
2001	c
.	c

July	c
17	c
,	c
2000	c

I	c
felt	c
very	c
upset	c
about	c
you	i
advertisement	c
was	c
totaly	i
different	c
between	i
the	i
musical	c
show	c
.	c

How	c
dared	i
you	i
could	i
show	i
"	c
You	i
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
"	c
in	c
you	i
advertisement	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
very	i
rediculous	i
!	c

To	c
be	c
honestly	i
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
you	c
could	i
return	i
the	c
money	c
back	i
to	c
me	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
she	c
got	i
many	c
friend	i

Lily	c
was	c
one	c
of	c
her	c
best	c
friend	i
before	i
three	c
year	i
.	c

She	c
told	c
to	i
Pat	c
about	c
what	c
had	c
happened	c
in	c
her	c
family	c
.	c

Of	c
course	c
,	c
she	c
knew	c
Nick	c
did	c
n't	c
like	c
her	c
to	c
tell	c
other	c
what	i
about	c
his	c
private	c
.	i

Pat	c
also	c
promised	c
not	c
to	c
tell	c
other	c
people	c
.	c

But	c
in	i
one	i
gathering	i
party	c
,	c
their	c
friend	i
want	i
to	c
show	c
their	c
concern	c
,	c
they	i
went	c
to	c
ask	c
about	c
Nick	c
and	c
send	i
him	c
sympathy	i
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
they	c
got	c
seperated	i
.	c

Today	c
,	c
Pat	c
and	c
Lily	c
still	i
are	i
friend	i
.	c

But	c
Lily	c
never	c
tell	i
her	c
what	c
she	c
really	c
want	i
and	i
what	c
her	i
really	c
thought	i
the	i
thing	i
.	c

Pat	c
felt	c
very	c
sorry	c
about	c
that	c
was	i
too	c
late	c
.	c

.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
to	c
be	c
sure	c
it	c
would	c
not	c
rain	c
during	c
the	c
trip	c
which	i
is	i
boring	i
?	c
!	c

And	c
when	c
the	c
sun	c
is	c
shining	c
you	c
are	c
relax	i
and	c
you	c
feel	c
good	c
.	c

You	c
are	c
in	c
communication	c
with	c
the	i
nature	c
and	c
you	c
can	c
hear	c
the	c
insects	c
.	c

And	c
we	c
only	c
need	c
to	c
sleep	c
and	c
not	c
to	c
cook	c
or	c
watch	c
T.V	c
...	c

It	c
is	c
very	c
nice	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
tents	c
wich	i
are	c
strong	c
and	c
confortable	i
.	c

.	c

From	c
the	c
list	c
below	c
,	c
the	c
two	c
activities	c
I	c
will	c
choose	c
are	c
Tennis	i
and	c
sailing	c
.	c

I	c
like	c
very	i
much	i
Tennis	i
because	c
it	c
is	c
a	i
technical	i
and	c
physical	c
sport	c
.	c

You	c
can	c
do	c
it	c
alone	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
questions	c
:	c
Must	i
I	c
take	c
with	i
me	i
my	i
clothes	i
?	c

In	c
fact	c
,	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
because	c
sometimes	c
you	c
want	c
to	c
buy	c
articles	i
but	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
enough	c
money	c
!	c

You	c
do	c
n't	c
find	c
anything	c
interesting	c
in	c
the	c
shop	c
.	c

You	c
can	c
hesitate	c
to	i
choose	i
an	c
article	i
.	c

The	c
seller	i
can	c
be	c
not	c
very	c
nice	c
and	c
watch	c
you	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
.	c

You	c
do	c
n't	c
find	c
your	i
size	i
or	i
the	i
good	i
color	i
in	i
the	i
article	i
.	c

Your	i
must	c
test	i
several	c
shops	c
and	c
compare	c
the	c
price	c
,	i
the	c
quality	c
of	c
the	c
articles	i
.	c

So	c
you	c
must	c
walk	c
all	c
the	i
day	c
or	c
go	c
by	c
car	c
.	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
if	c
there	c
is	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
people	c
in	c
the	c
shops	c
because	c
you	c
ca	c
n't	c
move	c
and	i
choose	i
the	c
article	i
and	c
be	i
cool	c
!	c

Dear	c
Madam	c
,	c

I	c
will	c
try	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
some	c
information	c
about	c
me	c
.	c

About	c
accommodation	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
a	c
tent	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
slept	c
in	c
the	i
tent	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
try	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
swimming	c
because	c
I	c
very	i
like	c
it	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
trying	c
to	c
swim	c
anywhen	i
I	c
have	c
got	c
some	c
time	c
,	c
and	c
painting	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
finished	c
painting	i
course	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
some	c
practice	c
with	c
this	c
.	c

That	c
is	c
very	c
nice	c
that	c
every	i
costs	c
are	c
paited	i
for	c
but	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
should	c
to	i
take	i
with	c
me	c
because	c
I	c
do	c
not	c
now	i
anything	c
about	c
prizes	c
in	c
the	c
U.S.A.	c
and	c
please	c
to	i
tell	i
me	c
if	c
I	c
need	c
anything	c
to	c
paint	c
because	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
difficult	c
to	c
take	c
it	c
with	c
me	c
,	c
so	c
if	c
I	c
will	c
need	c
to	c
take	c
everything	c
I	c
will	c
just	c
change	c
this	c
activite	i
.	c

My	c
life	c
is	c
a	c
little	c
bit	c
changed	c
after	c
that	c
concert	c
on	i
last	c
month	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
never	c
before	c
met	c
so	c
many	c
people	c
and	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
now	c
that	c
is	c
so	c
hard	c
to	c
keep	c
everything	c
in	c
order	c
during	c
the	i
concert	c
.	c

Now	c
I	c
now	i
that	c
everything	c
need	i
patient	i
,	c
time	c
and	c
hard	c
work	c
before	c
someone	c
will	i
sing	i
any	c
record	c
on	c
scene	i
.	c

The	c
people	c
were	c
wonderfull	i
,	c
they	c
was	i
helping	c
each	c
other	c
with	c
everything	c
and	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
lot	c
of	i
easier	c
to	c
do	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
very	i
nice	c
feeling	c
when	c
you	c
need	c
help	c
and	c
is	i
so	c
many	c
people	c
which	i
want	c
to	c
help	c
you	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
,	c

At	c
first	c
when	c
I	c
came	c
I	c
hoped	c
to	c
see	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
on	c
the	c
stage	c
,	c
but	c
there	c
was	c
totally	i
different	c
actor	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
not	i
still	i
very	c
disappointed	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
hoped	c
that	c
I	c
will	i
have	c
a	c
good	c
meal	c
with	c
glass	i
of	c
wine	c
in	c
the	c
restaurant	c
,	c
according	i
to	c
your	c
advertisment	i
but	i
what	c
did	i
I	i
realised	i
,	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
,	c
because	c
the	c
chef	c
was	c
in	c
the	i
hospital	c
.	c

I	c
did	c
not	c
have	c
a	c
perfect	c
evening	c
at	c
all	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
to	c
return	c
my	c
money	c
back	i
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

We	c

hairdryers	c
to	c

in	c
15	c
minutes	c
,	c
we	c
have	c
different	c
things	c
that	c

our	c

easier	c

Such	c

Madam	c
,	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
on	i
july	i
because	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
studant	i
therefore	i
I	c
only	c
have	c
holidays	c
in	c
this	c
part	c
of	c
the	c
year	c
.	c

About	c
the	c
acomodations	i
I	i
would	c
like	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
used	c
to	c
stay	i
in	c
it	i
when	c
I	c
travel	c
.	c

The	c
activities	c
that	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
do	c
in	i
the	c
camp	c
are	c
Basketball	c
and	c
Surfing	c
.	c

Basketball	c
is	c
the	c
sport	c
that	c
I	c
really	c
like	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
tall	c
as	i
well	i
as	i
I	c
use	i
to	c
play	c
it	c
very	c
well	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
about	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
will	c
need	c
to	c
go	c
out	c
at	c
night	c
,	c
to	c
spend	c
with	i
food	c
and	c
this	i
kind	c
of	c
thing	c
.	c

There	c
are	c
people	c
that	c
loves	i
going	c
to	i
the	i
shopping	c
.	c

They	c
live	c
,	c
work	c
and	c
only	c
think	c
about	c
it	c
.	c

He	c
ca	c
n't	c
stop	c
buying	c
things	c
,	i
he	i
spend	i
all	c
his	c
money	c
buying	c
things	c
that	c
he	c
sometimes	c
do	i
n't	i
use	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
this	c
one	i
bad	c
side	c
of	c
shopping	c
and	c
many	c
people	c
have	c
this	c
problem	c
.	c

Sometimes	c
,	c
shopping	c
can	c
be	c
really	c
bore	i
especially	i
in	i
important	c
dates	c
when	c
the	c
shop	i
are	c
absolutaly	i
crowded	c
and	c
you	c
ca	c
n't	c
see	c
somethings	i
as	i
you	c
wanted	c
with	i
carefull	i

13th	c
June	c
2000	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
was	c
really	c
surprised	c
and	c
very	c
happy	c
when	c
I	c
read	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
been	c
to	c
California	c
and	c
second	c
because	c
it	c
's	c
the	c
first	c
time	c
I	c
have	c
ever	c
won	c
something	c
.	c

For	c
my	c
stay	c
in	c
California	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
the	i
accommodation	i
in	i
tents	i
because	c
this	c
gives	c
me	c
a	c
feeling	c
of	c
freedom	c
and	c
adventure	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
quite	c
different	c
to	c
my	c
live	i
here	c
in	c
Greece	c
.	c

The	c
activities	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
mot	i
to	i
do	i
are	c
climbing	c
and	c
surfing	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
'	c
surfed	c
'	c
in	c
my	c
live	i
,	c
so	c
that	c
is	c
an	c
activity	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
learn	i
.	c

Last	c
but	c
not	c
least	c
there	c
are	c
some	c
things	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
:	c
What	c
kind	c
of	c
wheather	i
do	c
you	c
have	c
in	c
California	c
?	c

And	c
what	c
about	c
money	c
?	c

How	c
much	c
money	c
Should	i
I	c
take	c
with	c
me	c
?	c

Are	c
there	c
any	c
activities	c
which	c
are	c
not	c
included	c
?	c

If	c
you	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
centre	c
of	c
every	i
big	c
town	c
you	c
will	c
see	c
people	c
walking	c
from	c
store	c
to	c
store	c
searching	c
for	c
something	c
to	c
wear	c
or	c
to	c
buy	c
to	c
eat	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
big	i
variety	c
in	c
the	c
store	c
.	c

Very	c
often	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
what	c
to	c
buy	c
because	c
we	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
only	c
three	c
or	c
four	c
different	c
sport	i
shoes	c
to	c
choose	c
from	c
,	c
not	i
,	c
we	c
have	c
to	c
choose	c
out	c
of	c
twenty	c
or	c
thirty	c
such	c
as	c
Nike	c
,	c
adidas	i
or	c
Fila	c
.	c

And	c
very	c
often	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
pay	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
money	c
for	c
the	c
product	c
you	c
want	c
.	c

Another	c
cause	i
is	c
that	c
shops	c
and	c
stores	c
are	c
often	c
overcrowded	c
.	c

And	c
many	c
people	c
are	c
in	c
a	c
hurry	c
,	c
so	c
do	c
n't	c
wonder	i
if	c
other	c
people	c
have	i
not	i
tolerance	i
and	c
patience	c
to	c
wait	c
and	c
hit	c
you	c
with	c
their	c
shopping	c
cars	i
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
Brown	c
,	c
I	c
'm	c
writing	c
this	c
letter	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
that	c
I	c
saw	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
did	c
n't	c
act	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
to	c
,	i
the	c
show	c
did	c
n't	c
start	c
at	c
20.15	c
;	c
so	c
it	c
ended	c
at	c
23.45	c
and	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
go	c
to	c
a	c
meeting	c
.	c

Your	c
theatre	c
is	c
very	c
disorganized	c
!	c

The	c
ticket	c
's	c
price	c
was	c
£	c
20	c
and	c
there	c
was	i
n't	i
any	c
discount	i
!	c

After	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
eat	c
something	c
,	c
but	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
the	c
chef	c
was	c
in	c
Italy	c
for	c
a	c
special	c
course	c
.	c

I	c
had	i
n't	i
a	i
great	c
fun	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
ask	c
for	c
money	i
back	c
.	c

In	c
fact	c
,	c
some	c
days	c
before	c
Karin	c
,	c
a	c
friend	c
of	c
hers	c
,	c
had	c
told	c
Pat	c
that	c
she	c
had	c
fallen	c
in	c
love	c
with	c
John	c
,	c
her	c
science	i
's	i
teacher	c
.	c

The	c
teacher	c
was	c
40	c
years	c
old	c
,	c
and	c
Karla	c
was	c
only	c
16	c
(	c
years	c
old	c
)	c
.	c

This	c
age	i
's	i
difference	c
was	c
too	c
big	c
!	c

So	c
she	c
decided	c
to	c
tell	c
Hill	c
all	i
the	i
story	i
.	c

Hill	c
like	i
Pat	c
very	c
much	c
,	c
but	c
only	c
as	c
a	c
friend	c
.	c

He	c
was	c
19	c
(	c
years	c
old	c
)	c
,	c
so	c
Pat	c
thought	c
,	i
that	c
he	c
had	i
to	i
know	i
what	c
was	c
the	c
best	c
thing	c
to	c
do	c
.	c

So	c
they	c
went	c
to	c
talk	c
with	c
her	c
about	c
the	c
situation	c
,	c
but	c
when	c
she	c
knew	c
that	c
they	c
had	i
know	i
her	c
feelings	c
to	i
Mr.	c
Beek	c
,	c
she	c
decided	c
not	c
to	c
tell	c
Pat	c
anything	c
forever	i
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

I	c
write	i
to	c
you	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
dreadful	c
evening	c
I	c
had	c
when	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
see	c
your	c
show	c
at	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
the	i
9th	c
june	i
.	c

To	c
start	c
with	c
the	i
famous	c
actors	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
did	c
n't	c
perform	c
as	c
told	i
.	c

If	c
I	c
had	c
only	c
one	c
reason	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
for	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
;	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
the	i
latter	i
.	c

But	c
to	c
add	c
to	c
this	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
make	i
a	c
long	c
queue	c
to	c
get	c
a	c
full	i
price	i
ticket	c
when	c
instead	i
I	c
had	c
brought	c
my	c
student	c
card	c
on	i
the	c
purpose	c
of	c
getting	c
a	i
discount	c
which	c
had	c
been	c
advertised	c
but	c
did	c
n't	c
in	c
fact	c
exist	c
.	c

The	c
show	c
which	c
was	c
to	c
start	c
at	c
19.30	c
only	c
began	c
at	c
20.15	c
and	c
therefore	c
me	i
and	c
my	c
friends	c
were	c
n't	c
able	c
to	c
find	c
a	c
restaurant	c
when	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
because	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
on	i
sanitary	c
reasons	c
.	c

This	c
feature	i
did	c
n't	c
allow	c
you	c
to	c
tell	c
him	c
much	c
about	c
yourself	c
.	c

He	c
was	c
n't	c
really	c
wicked	c
,	c
he	c
merely	c
did	c
n't	c
understand	c
to	i
keep	c
his	c
mouth	c
shut	c
,	c
especially	c
at	c
school	c
where	c
every	c
little	c
unimportant	c
thing	c
about	c
your	c
so	i
called	i
"	c
private	c
life	c
"	c
runs	c
three	c
laps	c
around	c
the	c
schoolyard	c
before	c
you	c
learn	c
it	c
although	c
you	c
are	c
the	c
most	c
concerned	c
about	c
it	c
and	c
did	c
n't	c
even	c
know	c
.	c

There	c
is	c
one	c
point	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
make	c
clear	c
,	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
begrudge	c
Pat	c
anything	c
.	c

I	c
believe	c
this	c
is	c
a	c
rule	c
of	c
society	c
,	c
it	c
's	c
a	c
sort	c
of	c
group	c
behaviour	c
,	c
and	c
belongs	c
to	c
the	i
childhood	c
and	c
the	c
teenage	c
.	i

We	c
all	c
speak	c
or	c
have	c
spoken	c
of	c
our	c
neighbours	c
,	c
family	c
,	c
classmates	c
,	c
workmates	c
,	c
friends	c
in	c
bad	c
terms	c
.	c

That	c
is	c
only	c
human	c
.	c

According	i
to	i
me	i
what	c
is	c
more	c
to	i
regret	i
is	c
when	c
now	i
we	c
full-growns	i
continue	c
to	i
act	i
with	i
this	c
bad	c
habit	c
.	c

The	c
criticism	i
spirit	c
has	c
to	c
be	c
preserved	c
but	c
we	c
must	c
keep	c
our	c
secrets	c
.	c

What	c
allows	c
us	c
to	c
reveal	c
parts	c

Dear	c
Ms	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
really	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
it	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
been	c
to	c
the	c
U.S.A.	c
before	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
be	c
grateful	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
put	c
me	c
into	c
the	c
tent	i
side	i
of	i
accomodation	i
because	c
I	c
have	c
had	c
all	c
holidays	i
with	c
my	c
parents	c
in	c
luxury	c
hotels	c
before	i
.	c

As	c
all	c
the	c
travel	c
expenses	c
are	c
paid	c
already	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
appreciate	c
it	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
tell	c
what	i
kind	c
of	c
clothing	c
also	i
how	c
much	c
pocket	c
money	c
I	c
need	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
in	c
due	c
course	c
.	c

The	c
concert	c
I	c
helped	c
last	i
week	c
was	c
the	c
greatest	c
experience	c
I	c
've	c
ever	c
had	c
.	c

First	c
,	c
they	c
asked	c
me	c
to	c
put	c
those	c
instruments	c
on	c
the	c
stage	c
.	c

I	c
left	c
the	c
hi-fi	i
system	i
on	c
the	c
left	c
side	c
(	c
it	c
should	c
be	i
on	c
the	c
other	c
side	c
)	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
'd	c
never	c
met	i
him	c
before	c
.	c

I	c
told	c
him	c
I	c
loved	c
his	c
songs	c
,	i
he	i
was	c
very	c
happy	c
.	c

Then	c
,	c
we	c
stroke	i
a	c
lovely	c
conversation	c
.	c

Afterwards	c
,	c
he	c
gave	c
his	i
pen	c
for	c
my	c
enthusiasm	c
.	c

London	c
,	c
June	c
17th	c
,	c
2000	c

At	c
first	c
I	c
became	c
worried	c
because	c
there	c
was	i
n't	i
any	c
discounts	c
available	c
,	c
like	i
your	c
advertisement	c
say	i
.	i

It	c
's	c
necessary	c
to	c
start	c
on	c
time	c
,	c
and	c
your	c
paper	i
was	i
informing	i
that	i
it	c
would	c
begin	c
at	c
19:30	c
.	c

It	c
did	c
n't	c
happen	c
.	c

To	c
complete	c
my	c
sadness	c
,	c
the	c
main	c
actor	c
was	c
replaced	c
by	c
another	c
one	c
who	c
I	i
've	i
never	c
heard	c
anything	c
from	i
,	c
and	c
did	c
not	c
have	c
the	c
same	c
talent	c
that	c
the	c
one	c
shown	c
on	c
the	c
advertisement	c
do	i
.	c

It	c
is	c
n't	c
fair	c
not	c
returning	c
the	c
money	c
for	i
a	c
person	c
who	c
bought	c
tickets	c
to	c
watch	c
a	c
show	c
that	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
be	c
great	c
,	c
but	c
actually	c
was	c
a	c
shame	i
.	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
your	c
answer	c
.	c

Secrets	c
between	c
friends	c

And	c
because	c
of	c
that	c
,	c
everyone	c
at	c
school	c
happened	i
to	c
know	c
that	c
Ali	c
was	c
dating	c
Nick	c
,	c
that	i
used	i
to	i
be	i
Caroline	c
's	c
boyfriend	c
at	c
the	c
time	c
.	c

Pat	c
was	c
Ali	c
's	c
best	c
friend	c
,	c
and	c
because	c
of	c
that	c
,	c
Ali	c
told	c
her	c
that	c
she	c
was	c
going	c
out	c
with	c
Caroline	c
's	c
boyfriend	c
,	c
but	c
asked	c
her	c
to	c
keep	c
the	i
secret	c
.	c

Caroline	c
discovered	c
everything	c
,	c
and	c
argued	c
with	c
the	c
infidel	i
couple	c
.	c

One	c
more	c
week	c
has	i
passed	i
,	c
and	c
things	c
became	c
calm	c
:	c
Ali	c
decided	c
to	i
never	i
look	c
Pat	c
on	i
the	i
fact	i
anymore	c
.	c

Poor	c
Ali.	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
it	c
's	c
very	c
important	c
to	c
be	c
a	c
person	c
than	i
can	c
keep	c
secrets	c
,	c
even	c
your	c
own	c
secrets	c
,	c
or	c
a	c
friend	c
's	c
one	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
this	c
letter	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
a	c
musical	c
show	c
which	c
I	i
've	i
seen	i
on	i
last	c
Saturday	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
about	c
fourty	c
five	c
minutes	c
later	c
than	c
original	i
starting	c
time	c
.	c

The	c
actor	c
should	c
be	i
Danny	c
Brook	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
another	c
man	c
who	c
I	c
have	c
n't	c
seen	c
before	c
.	c

After	c
finished	i
watching	c
the	c
show	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
restaurant	c
which	c
you	c
advertised	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
about	c
21:00	c
,	c
I	c
thought	c
it	c
was	c
bit	i
later	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
my	c
falt	i
anyway	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
went	c
there	c
the	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

We	c
could	c
n't	c
even	c
get	c
any	c
sandwiches	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
before	c
I	c
do	i
my	i
futher	i
reaction	i

Fashion	c
of	c
the	c
future	c
.	c

Nowadays	c
,	c
we	c
have	c
millions	c
styles	i
of	c
fashion	c
and	c
every	c
single	c
person	c
has	c
their	c
own	c
fashion	c
.	c

Fashion	c
became	i
a	c
part	c
of	c
our	c
life	c
and	c
some	c
people	c
think	c
that	c
what	c
clothes	c
you	c
wear	c
is	c
most	i
important	c
thing	c
.	c

Women	c
worn	i
dresses	c
and	c
men	c
worn	i
suits	c
in	c
England	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
very	c
formal	c
fashion	c
,	c
but	c
now	c
people	c
wear	c
more	c
sexy	c
clothes	c
than	c
100	c
years	c
ago	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
people	c
will	c
wear	c
metal	c
clothes	c
like	c
Robotcap	i
.	c

The	c
enviroment	i
will	c
be	c
very	c
polluted	c
and	c
finally	c
we	c
'll	c
get	c
desease	i
.	c

We	c
will	c
need	c
helmets	c
to	c
cover	c
our	c
head	i
and	c
we	c
will	c
also	c
need	c
air-supplyer	i
.	c

May	i
be	i
,	c
science	c
will	c
be	c
developed	c
and	c
make	c
our	c
enviroment	i
clean	c
,	c
we	i
will	c
not	c
wear	c
anything	c
at	c
all	c
!	c
!	c
!	c
(	c
except	c
under	i
wear	i
)	c
.	c

We	c
should	c
try	c
hard	c
to	c
create	c
new	c
fashion	c
and	c
suitable	c
fashion	c
in	c
further	i
days	i
.	c

Dear	c
Jane	c
Clark	c

I	c
went	c
the	i
international	c
arts	c
festival	c
which	c
you	c
organized	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
may	c
I	c
give	c
you	c
my	c
suggestions	c
and	c
opinions	c
?	c

I	c
think	c
the	c
International	c
Arts	c
Festival	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
idea	c
!	c

But	c
the	c
stars	c
and	c
artists	c
who	c
are	c
from	c
around	c
the	c
world	c
were	c
from	c
only	c
six	c
countries	c
.	c

You	c
had	c
better	c
invite	c
more	c
nationarities	i
'	i
people	i
.	c

And	c
some	c
concert	c
halls	c
were	c
too	c
small	c
,	c
so	c
you	c
had	c
better	c
have	c
larger	c
concert	c
halls	c
and	c
also	c
you	c
had	c
better	c
have	c
more	c
plays	c
and	c
films	c
in	i
the	i
next	c
year	c
than	c
this	c
year	i
's	i
.	c

I	c
think	c
the	c
idea	c
of	c
one	c
reasonably	i
-	i
priced	i
weekend	c
ticket	c
for	c
all	c
events	c
is	c
excellent	c
!	c

Dear	c
Johnny	c

My	c
school	c
's	c
rules	c
are	c
n't	c
strict	c
.	c

We	c
are	c
allowed	c
many	i
things	c
.	c

And	c
it	c
does	c
n't	c
matter	c
if	c
we	c
enter	c
the	c
classroom	c
in	i
any	c
time	c
.	i

Of	c
course	c
we	c
can	c
go	c
out	c
the	i
classroom	c
in	i
any	c
time	c
.	c

But	c
some	c
schools	c
in	c
my	c
country	c
do	c
n't	c
allow	c
many	i
things	c
.	c

And	c
the	c
students	c
have	c
to	c
wear	c
the	i
uniforms	c
,	c
so	c
they	c
ca	c
n't	c
chose	i
their	c
clothes	c
.	c

Also	c
,	c
there	c
is	c
one	c
strict	c
rule	c
at	c
my	c
home	c
.	c

I	c
really	c
want	c
to	c
change	c
this	c
rule	c
.	c

How	c
about	c
in	c
your	c
country	c
?	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
with	c
reference	c
to	c
a	c
musical	c
show	c
I	c
saw	c
recently	c
in	c
your	c
theatre	c
.	c

The	c
advertisement	c
promised	c
there	c
would	c
be	c
my	c
favorite	i
star	c
Danny	i
Brook	c
,	c
but	c
there	c
was	c
an	i
other	i
actor	c
who	c
could	c
not	c
play	c
his	c
part	c
as	c
well	c
as	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
In	i
addition	c
,	c
the	c
performance	c
started	c
45	c
minutes	c
later	i
,	c
so	c
we	c
could	c
n't	c
visit	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
because	c
it	c
had	i
been	i
closed	c
already	c
.	c

More	i
over	i
,	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
buying	c
our	c
tickets	c
,	c
there	c
were	c
n't	c
any	c
discounts	c
in	c
spite	c
of	c
the	c
fact	c
that	c
my	c
wife	c
and	c
me	i
are	c
both	c
on	c
pension	i
.	c

As	c
a	c
result	c
our	i
evening	c
was	c
completely	c
spoiled	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
am	c
sure	c
you	c
will	c
understand	c
why	c
I	c
so	i
annoyed	c
and	c
frustrated	c
with	c
the	c
whole	c
incindent	i
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

One	c
day	c
Maria	c
and	c
her	c
mother	c
returned	c
home	c
and	c
found	c
a	c
letter	c
.	c

How	c
he	i
could	i
have	c
done	c
it	c
to	c
them	c
?	c

So	c
she	c
decided	c
to	c
tell	c
Pat	c
,	c
her	c
lovely	c
Pat	c
.	c

She	c
was	c
so	c
understanding	c
.	c

Now	c
everyone	c
knows	c
about	c
her	c
sad	c
story	c
that	i
makes	c
her	c
feel	c
even	c
more	i
worse	i

Dear	c

Which	i
I	c

was	c
not	c

with	c
your	c

Please	c

But	c
the	c

and	c
finally	c
I	c
helped	c

It	c
was	c
amazing	c

I	c

March	c
,	c
2000	c

Dear	c
Mr.	c
Robertson	c
,	c

There	c
are	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
activities	c
that	c
all	c
of	c
my	c
classmates	c
are	c
interested	c
in	c
and	c
especially	i
they	i
are	i
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
sightseeing	c
by	c
bus	c
and	c
visiting	c
National	i
Art	c
Gallery	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
suggest	c
a	c
special	c
activity	c
while	c
we	c
are	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

There	c
will	c
be	c
The	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
in	c
Central	c
Exhibition	c
Hall	c
on	c
the	c
14th	c
of	c
March	c
.	c

It	c
starts	c
10:00	i
am	c
and	c
finishes	c
9:00	i
p.m	c
.	c

All	c
of	c
my	c
classmates	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
there	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
chance	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
latest	c
fashions	c
,	c
leisure	c
and	c
sports	c
wear	c
,	c
make	i
up	i
and	c
hairstyles	c
.	c

The	c
fashion	c
show	c
is	c
only	c
on	c
the	c
14th	c
of	c
March	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
would	c
be	c
grateful	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
allow	c
all	c
of	c
my	c
classmates	c
to	c
go	c
there	c
after	c
visiting	c
Science	i
Museum	c
instead	c
of	c
going	c
shopping	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Yours	c
Sincerely	c
,	c

Many	c
people	c
think	c
that	c
it	c
is	c
natural	c
for	c
famous	c
people	c
to	c
be	c
followed	c
by	c
journalists	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
because	c
they	c
are	c
famous	c
and	c
everybody	c
is	c
curious	c
about	c
their	c
life	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
too	c
cruel	c
for	c
them	c
to	c
be	i
monitored	i
their	i
feelings	i
at	c
that	c
time	c
.	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
nobody	c
wants	c
to	i
be	i
revealed	i
their	i
private	i
life	i
on	i
public	c
.	c

Therefore	c
,	c
even	c
famous	c
people	c
need	c
their	c
own	c
life	c
apart	c
from	c
the	c
media	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr.	c
Robertson	c
,	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
we	c
want	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
having	c
organised	c
a	c
very	c
good	c
programme	c
for	c
the	c
three	i
days	i
trip	c
to	c
London	c
.	c

Indeed	c
,	c
we	c
are	c
especially	c
interested	c
in	c
the	c
sightseeing	c
by	i
bus	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
we	c
could	c
n't	c
go	c
there	c
without	c
visiting	c
the	c
Science	c
Museum	c
and	c
the	c
National	c
Art	c
Gallery	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
could	c
we	c
make	c
a	c
suggestion	c
?	c

How	c
wonderful	c
it	c
could	c
be	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
latest	c
fashions	c
and	c
leisure	c
and	c
sports	c
wear	c
in	c
this	c
city	c
,	c
so	c
famous	c
for	c
it	i
!	c

Besides	c
,	c
as	c
there	c
are	c
more	c
girls	c
than	c
boys	c
in	c
the	c
class	c
,	c
they	c
would	c
certainly	c
enjoy	c
attending	c
on	i
live	i
make-up	i
and	i
hairstyles	i
.	c

Lastly	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
free	c
for	c
students	c
,	c
which	c
is	c
fantastic	c
!	c

We	c
may	i
go	c
shopping	c
on	c
Wednesday	c
afternoon	c
,	c
as	c
we	c
should	c
have	i
had	i
freetime	i
.	c

On	c
the	c
one	c
hand	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
some	c
famous	c
people	c
are	c
looking	c
for	c
the	i
media	c
attention	c
.	c

Indeed	c
,	c
it	c
can	c
be	c
useful	c
for	c
their	c
career	c
.	c

The	c
more	c
they	c
are	c
in	c
the	c
media	c
,	c
the	c
more	c
they	i
will	i
be	i
famous	i
.	c

According	i
to	i
me	i
,	c
some	c
of	c
them	c
need	c
to	c
be	c
appreciated	c
by	c
fans	c
,	c
they	c
need	c
to	c
be	c
loved	c
and	c
see	c
themselves	c
on	c
television	c
.	c

They	c
need	c
to	c
be	c
famous	c
again	c
.	c

Besides	c
,	c
I	c
consider	i
that	c
some	c
stars	c
sometimes	c
call	c
journalist	i
to	c
tell	c
them	c
where	c
they	c
will	c
be	c
,	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
have	c
free	c
advertisement	i
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
according	i
to	i
me	i
,	c
it	c
is	c
also	c
a	c
good	c
way	c
for	c
them	c
to	c
earn	c
money	c
.	c

Famous	c
people	c
are	c
so	c
often	c
asked	c
to	c
give	c
interview	i
that	c
the	c
outcome	c
is	c
that	c
they	c
want	c
to	c
be	c
paid	c
for	c
it	c
,	c
either	c
in	c
the	c
newspapers	c
or	c
on	c
television	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
for	c
other	c
famous	c
people	c
,	c
being	c
followed	c
by	c
journalists	c
is	c
the	c
worst	c
element	c
of	c
the	c
fame	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
it	c
must	c
be	c
so	c
stressful	c
to	c
endure	c
the	c
pressure	c
they	c
have	i
to	c
be	c
perfect	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
because	c
they	c
could	c
be	c
followed	c
by	c
a	c
photograph	i
.	c

They	c
would	c
really	c
like	c
a	c
normal	c
life	c
,	c
either	c
because	c
it	i
is	i
their	c
temper	c
,	i
a	i
regarding	i
to	i
their	c
children	c
.	c

Nevertheless	c
,	c
they	c
are	c
never	c
let	i
alone	c
,	c
which	c
is	c
a	c
shame	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	i
Jane	i
Clark	c

I	c
am	c
writeing	i
to	c
you	c
to	c
"	c
help	c
"	c
you	c
with	c
your	c
festival	c
next	c
year	c
,	i
last	i
year	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
so	c
maybe	c
we	c
can	c
make	c
it	c
more	c
atracite	i
this	c
year	c
?	i

the	i
first	i
I	i
think	c
we	c
shoul	i
rent	c
biger	i
hall	i
for	i
that	i
so	i
we	c
could	i
make	c
better	i
sound	c
and	c
give	c
more	c
space	c
for	c
viewers	i
!	c

If	c
we	c
will	c
make	i
one	c
reasonably-priced	c
weekend	c
ticket	c
for	c
all	c
events	c
we	c
can	c
make	c
intrestede	i
more	i
people	i
.	c

Art	i
exhibitions	i
is	i
good	i
idea	c
too	c
,	c
to	c
introdus	i
how	c
the	c
music	c
is	c
making	i
and	c
show	c
how	c
the	c
instruments	c
lode	i
.	c

Afterward	i
we	c
could	c
let	c
people	c
talk	c
with	c
artists	i
so	c
they	c
can	i
get	c
knoe	i
theyr	i
privacy	i
.	c

Mr.	i
Jane	i
if	i
you	c
want	c
get	i
more	c
of	c
my	c
suggestions	c
and	c
opinions	c
about	c
it	c
pleace	i
contact	c
with	i
me	c
on	c
my	c
calle	i
phone	i

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
it	i
was	c
so	c
nice	c
to	c
hear	c
from	c
you	c
gain	i
and	c
I	c
am	c
glad	c
you	c
have	c
meant	i
this	c
subject	c
.	c

What	c
rules	c
do	c
we	c
have	c
in	c
our	c
schools	c
?	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
now	c
Polish	c
schools	c
are	c
going	i
foward	i
but	c
they	c
still	c
have	c
lots	c
of	c
bad	c
habits	c
.	c

Conneat	i
between	c
students	c
and	c
their	c
teachers	c
or	c
principals	c
is	c
very	c
poor	c
!	c

School	c
supose	i
to	c
be	c
our	c
second	c
home	c
but	c
it	c
's	c
not	c
we	i
work	c
hard	c
and	c
for	i
the	c
end	c
our	i
education	c
we	c
still	c
have	c
nothing	c
.	c

Maybe	c
Polish	i
system	c
is	c
not	c
bad	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
's	c
conftyble	i
too	c
.	c

I	c
know	c
that	c
that	i
letter	c
will	c
not	c
change	c
anything	c
but	c
you	c
can	c
see	c
how	c
compliated	i
is	i
Polish	i
studen	i
's	i
life	i

Dear	c
,	i
Helen	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
please	i
when	c
I	c
knew	c
that	c
I	c
had	c

.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
there	c
only	c
in	c
July	c
,	c
please	c
.	c

Because	c
I	c
have	c
a	c
holiday	c
in	c
July	c
.	c

For	c
accommodation	c
I	c
would	c
rather	i
prefer	c
log	c
cabins	c
because	c
it	i
's	i
more	c
comfortable	c
than	c
tents	c
.	c

For	c
two	c
activities	c
,	c
the	i
first	c
one	c
can	i
I	c
have	i
Tennis	c
,	c
please	c
.	c

Because	c
I	c
'm	c
very	c
good	c
with	i
tennis	c
.	c

I	c
used	c
to	c
play	c
a	c
lot	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
student	c
.	c

The	i
second	c
one	c
can	i
I	c
have	i
Photography	c
,	c
please	c

Because	c
this	i
's	i
my	c
hobby	c

And	c
my	c
dad	c
just	c
bought	c
me	c
a	c
new	c

Can	c

I	c
need	c

please	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
really	c
good	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
glad	c
I	c
went	c

It	c
was	c
good	c
to	c
work	c
with	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
people	c
and	c
shared	i
experiences	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
feel	c
sad	c
if	c
I	c
did	i
n't	i

From	i

Take	c

and	c
do	c
n't	c
work	c
too	c
hard	c
.	c

Please	c
send	i
my	c
love	c
to	c
your	c
family	c

Dear	c
Manager	c
,	c

Last	c
week	c
I	c
was	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

I	c
attended	c
to	i
your	c
activity	i
.	c

I	c
'm	c
sorry	c
but	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
have	c
a	c
good	c
remark	i
of	c
your	c
activity	i
when	c
I	c
left	c
.	c

I	c
know	c
the	c
quality	c
of	c
your	c
organization	c
.	c

First	i
time	c
,	c
when	c
I	c
saw	c
the	c
advertisement	c
on	i
the	c
newspaper	c
,	c
I	c
really	c
appreciated	i
.	c

I	c
wanted	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
play	c
as	c
quickly	c
as	c
possible	c
.	c

Coming	i
an	i
hour	i
earlier	i
is	i
the	i
proof	i
of	i
my	i
feeling	i
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
time	c
passed	c
and	c
it	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
begin	c
.	c

But	c
it	c
did	c
n't	c
.	c

Because	c
,	i
I	c
believe	c
that	c
if	c
you	c
want	c
to	c
get	c
a	i
satisfaction	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
sacrifice	c
a	c
little	c
bit	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

But	c
Beatrice	c
did	c
n't	c
think	c
so	c
.	c

That	c
's	c
why	c
she	c
came	i
across	i
with	i
so	c
many	c
problems	c
.	c

They	c
were	c
best	c
friends	c
.	c

When	c
she	c
came	c
to	c
school	c
,	c
first	i
,	c
we	c
wanted	c
to	c
warn	c
her	c
.	c

Yes	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
a	i
strange	c
behaviour	c
.	c

Beatrice	c
was	c
18	c
and	c
she	c
could	c
manage	c
.	c

But	c
her	c
father	c
did	c
n't	c
have	c
the	c
same	c
opinion	c
.	c

That	c
's	c
all	c
I	c
knew	c
about	c
her	c
.	c

One	c
day	c
Beatrice	c
came	c
me	i
with	c
some	c
tears	c
on	c
her	c
face	c
.	c

She	c
was	c
crying	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
n't	c
believe	c
.	i

Because	c
I	c
got	i
used	c
to	c
seeing	c
her	c
every	i
time	i
cheerful	c
and	c
laughing	c
.	c

But	c
this	c
time	c
the	c
situation	c
was	c
inversed	i
.	c

When	c
she	c
came	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
studying	c
for	c
my	c
final	c
exam	c
.	c

She	c
asked	c
if	c
we	c
spoke	i
a	c
little	c
bit	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
shocked	c
.	c

She	c
had	c
told	c
Pat	c
that	c
her	c
father	c
had	i
n't	i
let	c
them	c
to	i
be	i
friends	c
anymore	c
.	c

After	c
that	c
,	c
Pat	c
had	c
told	c
everyone	c
that	c
Beatrice	c
's	c
father	c

On	i
the	c
advertisement	c
,	i
that	c
I	c
have	i
received	i
,	c
it	c
was	c
written	c
that	c
the	c
show	c
would	c
start	c
at	c
19:30	c
but	c
I	c
kept	c
wainting	i
for	c
it	c
to	c
start	c
for	c
half	c
an	c
hour	c
.	c

There	c
was	c
no	c
notice	c
about	c
it	c
in	c
your	c
advertisement	c
.	c

Because	c
of	c
all	c
these	c
reasons	c
,	c
which	c
I	c
have	c
listed	c
above	c
,	c
my	c
evening	c
which	i
should	c
have	c
been	c
perfect	c
,	c
turned	c
into	c
a	c
disaster	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

On	i
one	i
side	i
it	c
was	c
her	c
best	c
friend	c
who	c
wanted	c
her	c
to	c
keep	c
this	c
secret	c
.	c

But	c
on	i
the	i
other	i
side	i
it	c
was	c
her	c
best	c
friend	c
's	c
family	c
,	i
that	c
she	c
must	c
lie	c
to	c
.	c

So	c
Pat	c
could	c
not	c
decide	c
what	c
to	c
do	c
.	c

Of	c
course	c
,	c
her	c
best	c
friend	c
would	c
never	c
trust	c
her	c
again	c
and	c
never	c
share	c
any	c
secrets	c
,	c
but	c
she	c
was	c
doing	c
this	c
for	c
her	c
best	c
friends	i
sake	c
,	c
was	c
n't	c
she	c
?	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
,	c

That	c
evening	c
,	c
the	c
problems	c
started	c
with	c
the	c
tickets	c
...	c

Secondly	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
has	i
started	i
with	i
a	c
delay	c
of	c
45	c
minutes	c
,	c
and	c
because	c
of	c
this	c
all	c
my	c
arrangements	c
for	c
that	c
night	c
were	c
delayed	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
I	c
did	c
not	c
have	c
the	c
"	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
"	c
as	c
stated	c
in	c
your	c
advertisement	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
you	c
owe	c
me	c
an	c
excuse	i
and	c
a	c
full	c
refund	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c

Clothes	c
of	c
the	c
Future	c

Because	c
,	i
the	i
clothes	c
have	i
a	c
crucial	c
part	c
in	c
our	c
everyday	c
lives	c
.	c

This	c
evolution	c
has	c
never	c
stopped	c
and	c
it	c
will	c
continue	c
.	c

Of	c
course	c
,	c
the	i
technology	c
will	c
change	c
too	c
.	c

Actually	c
,	c
some	c
clothes	c
like	c
that	c
are	c
being	c
developed	c
today	c
;	i
but	c
only	c
as	c
prototypes	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
possible	c
to	c
see	c
that	c
they	c
will	c
be	c
widely	c
used	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
.	c

In	c
fact	c
,	c
we	c
can	i
not	i
know	c
,	i
what	c
will	i
the	i
time	i
give	c
and	c
take	c
away	c
,	c
so	c
let	c
's	c
wait	c
and	c
see	c
:	i
the	c
clothes	c
of	c
the	c
future	c
.	c

I	c
appriciated	i
to	i
this	c
big	c
news	c
.	c

Please	c
,	c
let	c
me	c
tell	c
you	c
my	c
answer	c
now	c
.	c

Because	i
my	c
college	c
will	c
finish	c
in	i
the	c
end	c
of	c
June	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
going	c
to	c
go	c
back	c
to	c
Japan	c
in	c
August	c
.	c

Second	c
,	c
I	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
a	i
log	c
cabin	c
.	c

Actually	c
,	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
like	c
tent	i
so	c
much	c
.	c

Therefore	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
interested	c
in	c
staying	c
a	i
log	c
cabin	c
.	c

Specially	i
,	c
I	c
like	c
water	c
painting	c
.	c

Also	c
,	c
I	c
belonged	c
to	c
golf	i
club	c
when	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
university	c
in	c
Japan	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
you	c
to	c
advise	c
about	i
clothes	c
and	c
pocket	c
money	c
,	c
which	c
I	c
will	c
take	c
.	c

Thanking	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
time	c

Shopping	c
is	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
never	c
feel	c
tired	c
during	c
shopping	c
.	c

Especially	i
,	c
I	c
prefer	c
to	c
go	c
department	i
stores	c
.	c

In	c
fact	c
,	c
they	c
have	c
many	c
kind	i
of	c
products	c
which	c
make	c
me	c
happy	c
.	c

Some	c
people	c
does	i
n't	i
like	c
to	c
go	c
shopping	c
with	c
a	c
friend	c
who	c
takes	c
long	i
time	c
to	c
decide	c
.	c

By	c
the	c
way	c
,	c
shopping	c
is	c
a	c
sort	c
of	c
therapy	c
.	c

I	c
sometimes	c
go	c
shopping	c
when	c
I	c
have	c
stress	c
.	c

But	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
things	i
to	c
enjoy	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
to	c
use	i
every	i
money	i
which	c
you	c
have	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
in	c
reply	c
to	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
absolutely	c
delighted	c
with	c
the	c
news	c
.	c

It	c
really	c
took	c
me	c
by	c
surprise	c
this	i
prize	c
,	i
I	c
did	c
n't	c
think	c
I	c
would	c
be	c
so	c
lucky	c
to	i
win	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
about	c
your	c
enquires	i
,	c
the	c
only	c
time	c
suitable	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
travel	c
is	c
in	c
July	c
.	c

The	c
other	c
thing	c
I	c
'd	c
love	c
to	c
do	c
is	c
sailing	c
.	c

Finally	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
some	c
questions	c
,	c
there	i
are	c
mainly	c
small	i
details	c

Dear	c

My	c
dear	c
friend	c
I	i
hope	c
you	c
are	c
very	c
well	c
and	c
just	c
as	c
happy	c
as	c
I	c
am	c

The	c
concert	c
was	c
a	c
huge	c
success	c
,	i
lots	i
of	c
people	c
came	c
and	c
enjoyed	c
the	c
music	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
proud	c
of	c
myself	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
way	c
I	c
managed	c
the	c
whole	c
experience	c
,	c
although	c
there	c
were	c
moments	c
when	c
I	c
thought	c
I	c
was	c
n't	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
cope	c
with	c
all	c
the	c
pressure	c
.	c

Especially	c
when	c
the	c
musicians	c
arrived	c
,	i
they	i
can	c
be	c
very	c
demanding	c
people	c
and	c
sometimes	c
they	c
came	i
up	c
with	c
very	c
odd	c
requests	c
.	c

My	c
tasks	c
were	c
very	c
especifics	i
.	c

However	c
,	c
what	c
I	c
liked	c
the	c
most	c
about	c
it	c
was	c
seeing	c
so	c
many	c
people	c
dancing	c
,	c
jumping	c
and	c
enjoying	c
frenetically	c
of	i
something	c
that	c
I	c
had	c
been	c
part	c
of	c
and	c
helped	c
to	c
make	c
it	i
happened	i
.	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
surprise	c
to	c
know	i
that	c
I	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
.	c

The	c
reasons	i
I	c
am	c
really	c
writing	c
,	c
However	i
,	c
is	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
some	c
details	c
of	i
my	c
trip	c
to	c
California	c
.	c

I	c
'll	c
be	c
taking	c
an	c
English	c
Examination	c
at	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
June	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
good	c
idea	c
if	c
I	c
can	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
it	c
's	c
the	c
only	c
month	c
I	c
can	c
spend	c
abroad	c
this	c
year	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
tents	i
so	c
that	c
I	c
will	c
have	c
the	c
chance	c
to	c
be	c
in	c
contact	c
with	c
the	i
nature	c
as	c
well	c
as	c
the	c
scenery	c
around	c
.	i

Another	i
thing	i
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
choose	c
from	c
the	c
activity	c
list	c
is	i
singing	c
(	c
because	c
I	c
take	i
part	i
in	i
a	c
chorus	i
at	c
school	c
)	c
and	c
photography	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
really	c
good	c
taking	i
pictures	c
,	i
it	i
's	i
a	c
way	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
express	c
my	c
feelings	c
.	c

I	c
wonder	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
send	c
me	c
more	c
information	c
about	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
have	i
we	i
bring	i
.	c

Do	c
you	c
think	c
you	c
could	c
also	c
let	c
me	c
know	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
we	c
will	c
need	c
during	c
our	c
stay	c
at	c
the	c
Camp	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
be	c
grateful	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
send	c
me	c
a	c
brochure	c
and	c
a	c
map	c
showing	c
where	c
the	c
camp	c
is	c
.	c

thanking	c
you	c
in	c
anticipation	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

This	c
is	c
just	c
to	c
let	c
you	c
know	c
with	c
whom	c
I	c
worked	c
.	c

In	c
order	c
to	c
celebrate	c
the	c
125	i
aniversary	i
of	c
the	c
city	c
,	c
the	c
Coun	i
Council	c

K.	c
if	i
you	c
want	c
to	c
help	c
,	c
here	c
is	c
a	c
list	c
of	c
what	c
you	c
can	c

My	c
job	c
was	c
to	c
leave	c
some	c
leaflets	c
on	i
shops	c
,	c
restaurants	c
and	c
streets	i
.	c

What	c
I	c
really	c
enjoyed	c
was	c
been	i
part	c
of	c
the	c
staff	c
.	c

Although	c
I	c
was	c
too	i
nervious	i
,	c
I	c
knew	c
I	c
could	c
do	c
the	c
job	c
well	c
.	c

Perhaps	c
I	c
could	c
show	c
you	c
the	c
pictures	c
I	c
took	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c

I	c
was	c
spending	c
some	c
days	c
in	c
London	c
and	c
enjoyed	i
a	i
lot	i
the	i
idea	i
of	i
seeing	i
this	i
show	i
.	c

All	i
my	i
disappointment	c
started	c
when	c
we	c
noticed	c
that	c
there	c
were	c
no	c
discounts	c
available	c
for	c
the	c
tickets	c
,	c
but	c
as	c
we	c
wanted	c
to	c
see	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
's	c
performance	c
,	c
we	c
decided	c
to	c
buy	c
them	c
anyway	c
.	c

The	c
show	c
was	c
scheduled	c
for	c
19:30	c
but	c
it	c
only	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
.	c

Besides	c
the	c
boredom	c
of	c
having	c
waited	i
for	c
forty-five	c
minutes	c
,	c
we	c
were	c
not	c
allowed	c
to	c
visit	c
the	c
restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
since	c
it	c
was	c
already	c
closed	c
by	c
the	c
time	c
the	c
show	c
finished	c

As	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
our	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
,	c
as	c
you	c
suggested	i
in	c
your	c
advertisement	c

we	c
would	c
like	c
to	c

Dear	c
Ted	c
,	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
about	c
a	c
great	c
book	c
I	c
've	c
just	c
finished	c
reading	c
,	c
and	c
which	c
I	c
'm	c
sure	c
you	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
read	c
too	c
.	c

Agatha	c
Christie	c
presents	c
situations	c
that	c
make	i
us	i
break	i
up	i
our	i
minds	i
.	c

I	c
thought	c
about	c
you	c
while	c
reading	c
the	c
book	c
because	c
I	c
remembered	c
you	c
have	c
booked	c
a	c
place	c
in	i
a	c
Detective	c
course	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
estimulating	i
to	c
read	c
them	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
sure	c
that	c
if	c
you	c
listen	c
to	c
it	c
you	c
will	c
start	c
reading	c
the	c
book	c
immediately	c
,	c
and	c
find	c
out	c
there	c
many	i
challenges	c
for	i
your	c
new	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
congratulate	c
you	c
for	i
the	c
excellent	c
programme	c
that	c
you	c
have	c
prepared	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
is	i
such	c
a	c
good	c
programme	c
especially	i
because	c
the	c
places	c
that	c
we	c
visit	c
,	c
like	c
the	c
Science	c
Museum	c
,	c
are	c
very	c
interesting	c
.	c

There	c
we	c
will	c
have	c
the	c
chance	c
to	c
be	c
maked	i
up	c
or	c
to	c
try	c
new	c
hairstyles	c
,	c
too	c
.	c

We	c
think	c
that	c
,	c
if	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
any	c
problem	c
,	c
we	c
could	c
visit	c
the	c
Science	c
Museum	c
on	c
Wednesday	c
after	c
visiting	c
the	c
National	c
Art	c
Gallery	c
so	c
that	c
we	c
can	i
go	c
to	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
show	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Although	c
many	c
people	c
think	c
that	c
the	c
home	c
of	c
the	c
future	c
will	c
be	c
something	c
like	c
an	i
UFO	c
,	c
in	c
my	c
opinion	c
the	c
changes	c
wo	c
n't	c
be	c
very	c
important	i
,	c
they	c
will	c
probably	c
consist	c
on	i
making	c
the	c
houseworks	i
easier	c
.	c

The	c
cleanest	i
example	c
is	c
to	c
compare	c
a	c
house	c
from	c
the	c
beginings	i
of	c
the	c
20th	c
century	c
with	c
our	c
house	i
Both	i
are	c
very	c
similar	c
but	c
now	c
we	c
have	c
new	c
technologies	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
this	c
letter	c
to	c
inform	c
you	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
recieved	i
your	c
letters	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
going	c
to	i
the	c
trip	c
.	c

The	c
weather	c
condition	i
will	c
be	c
suitable	c
for	c
camping	c
.	c

I	c
'll	c
have	c
to	c
be	c
aware	i
about	c
insects	c
so	c
I	c
've	c
bought	c
so	c
many	c
insects	i
repellant	i
.	c

I	c
can	c
choose	c
to	c
do	c
2	c
activities	c
so	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
play	c
tennis	c
and	c
swimming	i
.	c

When	c
I	c
was	c
in	c
fourth	i
form	c
,	c
I	c
got	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
swimming	i
competition	c
and	c
third	c
prize	c
in	c
tennis	c
.	c

Lastly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
questions	i

And	c
do	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
bring	c
some	c
money	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

How	c
are	c
you	c
.	i

At	c
first	c
I	c
was	c
surprised	c
but	c
in	i
a	c
few	c
secound	i
later	c
,	c
when	c
I	c
relised	i
that	c
,	i
I	c
did	i
n't	i
allow	i
to	c
go	c
,	c
I	c
tried	c
to	c
persuade	c
my	c
teacher	c
to	c
let	c
me	c
go	c
.	c

At	i
last	i
,	c
she	c
allowed	c
me	c
.	i

I	c
was	i
really	c
enjoy	i
at	i
the	c
concert	c
.	c

I	c
really	c
want	c
to	c
have	c
that	c
experience	c
again	c

That	c
is	c
my	c
story	c
.	c

Tell	c
me	c
yoors	i

Best	c
wishes	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
inconnection	i
with	c
your	c
programme	c
of	i
spending	c
three	c
days	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
inform	c
you	c
about	c
The	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
show	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
14th	c
March	c
at	i
10.00	c
-	c
19.00	c
.	c

Most	c
of	c
the	c
shows	c
are	c
about	c
fashinable	i
things	c
for	c
the	i
students	c
in	i
my	c
age	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
good	c
programme	i
and	c
suitable	c
for	c
all	c
of	c
us	c
because	c
there	c
are	c
many	c
different	c
kinds	c
of	c
the	i
shows	i
for	i
instance	c
latest	i
fashions	c
,	c
leisure	c
and	c
sports	c
wear	c
,	c
how	c
to	c
make	i
up	i
and	c
how	c
to	c
have	i
propiate	i
hairstyles	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opionion	i
,	c
I	c
think	c
you	c
should	c
organised	i
this	c
programme	i
in	c
the	c
afternoon	c
instead	c
of	c
going	c
for	i
shopping	c
and	c
move	c
the	c
shoping	i
time	i
in	i
the	c
afternoon	c
on	c
Wednesday	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

I	c
closed	c
my	c
eyes	c
,	c
tooke	i
a	c
deep	c
breath	c
and	c
jumed	i
out	c
of	c
the	c
tower	c
.	c

There	c
were	c
hundrend	i
of	c
Thai	c
students	c
were	i
waiting	c
for	i
doing	i
this	c
test	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
afraid	c
of	c
the	c
hieght	i
and	c
was	c
very	c
nervous	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
just	c
received	c
your	c
letter	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
happy	c
about	c
this	c
.	c

Accommodation	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
is	c
in	c
tents	c
or	c
log	c
cabins	c
,	i
I	c
think	c
I	c
prefer	i
both	c
of	c
them	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
've	c
never	c
been	c
there	c
before	c
,	c
and	c
never	c
heard	c
of	c
these	c
two	c
places	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
interested	c
in	c
both	c
places	i
but	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
just	c
choose	c
one	c
place	i
,	i
I	c
think	c
I	c
will	c
choose	c
log	c
cabins	c
,	i
it	i
's	i
sounds	i
good	c
and	c
if	c
I	c
have	c
time	c
,	c
maybe	c
I	c
can	c
go	i
to	i
tents	c
next	c
time	c
(	c
maybe	c
next	c
year	c
.	i
)	i

Another	c
thing	c
is	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
some	c
questions	c
about	c
journey	i
,	i
What	c
's	c
the	c
weather	c
like	c
?	c

What	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
shall	c
I	c
take	c
?	c
and	i
how	c
much	c
does	c
it	c
cost	c
per	c
night	c
live	i
in	c
a	c
Hotel	c
?	c

Thanks	c
for	c
your	c
help	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c

But	c
sometimes	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
very	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
student	c
,	i
I	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
job	i
,	c
so	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
asked	i
money	i
from	c
my	c
parents	c
.	c

I	c
ca	c
n't	c
asked	i
too	i
much	i
that	i
's	i
very	c
bad	c
for	c
my	c
parents	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
go	c
shopping	c
.	i

(	c
although	i
I	c
got	i
part-time	i
job	c
,	c
it	c
just	i
enough	c
to	c
pay	c
my	c
rent	c
.	c
)	c

Secondly	c
,	c
if	c
you	c
live	c
in	c
a	c
big	c
city	c
,	c
the	i
things	c
always	i
expensive	c
.	c

You	c
should	i
spend	c
more	c
money	c
on	c
buying	c
clothes	c
and	c
food	c
,	c
you	i
will	c
very	i
happy	c
when	c
you	c
buy	i
it	i
,	c
but	c
,	i
when	c
you	c
come	c
back	c
home	c
take	i
out	c
you	i
purse	c
,	c
you	c
must	i
be	c
feel	i
sad	c
,	i
you	i
purse	c
nearly	i
empty	c
,	i
(	c
when	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
enough	c
money	c
.	i
)	i

Sometimes	c
,	c
when	c
you	c
shopping	i
on	i
the	i
street	i
,	c
you	c
will	c
see	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
things	c
that	c
you	c
like	c
,	c
and	c
you	c
ca	c
n't	c
buy	c
it	i
once	i
,	c
you	i
will	i
feel	i
very	i
sad	i
maybe	i
.	c

And	i
then	i
,	i
you	i
may	i
save	i
money	i
for	i
the	i
things	i
you	i
like	i
,	i
nothing	i
to	i
do	i
,	i
just	i
for	i
the	i
poor	i
things	i
what	i
you	i
like	i
so	i
funny	c
is	i
n't	c
it	c
?	c

Another	c
thing	c
is	c
when	c
you	c
shopping	i
in	i
a	c
busy	c
street	c
,	c
seem	i
like	c
oxford	i
st	i
in	c
London	c
.	i

a	c
lot	c
of	c
thief	i
there	i
,	i
they	i
will	c
steal	c
you	i
money	c
,	i
that	i
's	i
so	c
dangerous	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
in	c
my	c
opinion	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
really	c
enjoyable	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

It	i
will	c
stop	c
when	c
I	c
get	c
a	c
good	c
job	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
,	c

When	c
I	c
saw	c
your	c
advertisement	c
on	i
yesterday	c
's	c
newspaper	c
,	c
I	c
thought	c
that	c
I	c
would	c
have	c
a	c
perfect	c
evening	c
as	c
you	c
have	i
written	i
on	i
your	c
advertisement	c
.	c

Moreover	c
it	c
was	c
written	c
that	i
the	c
musical	c
was	c
between	c
14:30-19:30	i
.	c

Suprisingly	i
the	c
show	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
,	i
all	c
of	c
these	c
disappointments	c
are	c
too	c
much	c
for	c
one	c
evening	c
.	c

That	c
was	c
also	c
my	c
fault	c
.	c

This	c
was	c
the	c
most	c
wonderful	c
suggestion	c
I	c
have	c
ever	c
had	c
.	c

Going	c
to	c
cinema	i
with	c
the	c
boy	c
I	c
love	c
.	c

She	c
came	c
near	i
to	c
me	c
and	c
said	c
"	c
Ready	c
for	c
this	c
evening	c
?	c

Do	c
n't	c
forget	c
bringing	i
your	c
history	c
books.	c
"	c

She	c
was	c
very	c
nervous	c
because	c
she	c
was	c
about	c
to	c
fail	c
.	c

I	c
told	c
her	c
that	c
I	c
want	i
to	c
tell	c
her	c
something	c
.	c

Then	c
I	c
explained	c
what	c
has	i
happened	c
that	c
morning	c
.	c

You	c
choose	i
Larry	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
thought	c
that	c
I	c
was	c
your	c
best	c
friend.	c
"	c

After	c
hearing	c
this	c
,	c
I	c
told	c
her	c
that	c
I	c
am	c
deeply	c
in	c
love	c
with	c
Larry	c
.	c

She	c
said	c
OK	c
angrily	c
.	c

After	c
school	c
Larry	c
and	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
cinema	c
,	c
but	c
on	i
the	c
enterance	i
there	c
was	c
a	c
beautiful	c
girl	c
waiting	c
for	c
us	c
.	c

When	c
they	c
asked	c
me	c
the	c
reason	c
I	c
told	c
that	i
I	c
promised	c
my	c
Mom	c
to	c
be	i
with	c
her	c
.	c

Next	c
morning	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
school	c
again	c
.	c

Everyone	c
at	c
the	c
school	c
was	i
knowing	i
about	c
my	c
love	c
to	i
Larry	c
including	c
him	c
.	c

Pat	c
was	c
the	c
only	c
person	c
who	c
knew	i
it	i
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
very	c
surprise	i
,	i
to	c
won	i
this	c
prize	c
.	c

About	c
the	c
information	c
,	c
I	c
like	i
to	c
travel	c
on	i
July	c
because	c
it	c
's	c
only	c
the	c
month	c
I	i
have	c
vacation	i
.	c

It	c
's	c
very	c
difficult	c
to	c
change	c
it	c
.	c

About	c
the	c
accommodation	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
I	i
will	i
prefer	c
tents	c
because	c
I	c
like	c
the	c
nature	i
and	c
I	c
like	c
to	c
listen	c
the	i
birds	c
.	c

At	c
the	c
camp	c
I	c
will	i
like	c
to	c
practise	i
tennis	c
and	c
golf	c
.	c

How	c
many	i
money	c
take	i
us	i
?	c
or	i
is	i
necessary	c
?	c

In	i
the	i
first	i
prize	i
you	i
including	i
a	i
second	i
person	i
like	i
my	i
husband	i
?	i

It	i
's	i
necessary	c
for	i
the	i
activities	i
to	i
wear	i
special	i
clothes	i
?	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

When	c
we	c
arrived	c
to	i
the	c
shopping	c
center	i
,	c
I	c
saw	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
people	c
.	c

There	c
are	i
four	c
gays	i
,	c
in	c
this	c
shop	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
a	c
girl	i
very	i
friendly	i
came	c
with	c
us	c
.	c

We	c
bought	c
some	c
trousers	c
,	c
tee-shirts	c
,	c
and	c
one	c
pair	c
of	c
shoes	c
.	c

Not	i
all	i
the	i
time	i
the	i
people	i
are	i
not	i
friendly	i
in	i
the	i
shops	i
.	c

Dear	c
Mr.	c
Robertson	c
,	c

Specially	i
,	c
I	c
would	c
have	c
to	c
name	c
the	c
great	c
opportunity	c
you	c
offer	c
to	c
us	c
with	c
the	c
visit	c
to	c
the	c
National	c
Art	c
Gallery	c
which	c
is	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
art	c
galleries	c
all	i
around	i
the	c
world	c
.	c

The	c
suggestion	c
is	c
to	c
move	c
the	c
Tuesday	c
shopping	c
to	c
Wednesday	c
afternoon	c
,	c
which	c
is	c
free	c
,	c
and	c
place	c
there	c
the	c
visit	c
to	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
And	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
,	c
that	c
is	c
,	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
afternoon	c
.	c

I	c
want	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
Sir	i
for	i
your	c
time	c
.	c

Nowadays	c
I	c
remember	c
those	c
exciting	c
days	c
in	c
which	c
danger	c
is	i
knocking	c
at	c
your	c
door	c
every	c
day	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
20	c
years	c
ago	c
we	i
were	i
friends	c
since	c
10	i
.	c

In	c
those	c
days	c
we	c
decide	i
to	c
be	c
friends	c
forever	c
and	c
work	c
for	c
the	i
NASA	c
.	c

I	c
remember	c
it	c
as	c
if	c
it	c
were	c
yesterday	c
.	c

We	c
were	c
both	c
18	c
,	c
and	c
we	c
had	c
the	c
university	c
access	c
test	c
already	c
done	c
.	c

Of	c
course	c
we	c
had	c
n't	c
got	c
enough	c
points	c
in	c
the	c
test	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
so	i
.	c

This	c
way	c
we	c
could	c
obtain	c
seldom	i
places	c
at	c
NASA	c
university	c
.	c

It	c
took	c
us	c
two	c
weeks	c
to	c
modify	c
the	c
results	c
in	c
a	c
very	c
complex	c
operation	c
in	c
which	c
we	c
should	c
take	c
care	c
of	c
hiding	i
all	c
our	c
fingerprints	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
confirm	c
that	c
we	c
have	c
received	c
your	c
programme	c
for	c
our	c
class	c
for	c
the	c
three	c
days	c
,	i
during	i
our	c
stay	c
in	c
London	c
,	i
and	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
the	c
whole	c
class	c
is	c
very	c
pleased	c
with	c
the	c
programme	c
,	c
especially	c
with	c
the	c
visit	c
to	c
the	c
National	c
Art	c
Gallery	c
.	c

As	i
we	i
have	c
been	c
told	c
,	i
there	c
are	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
interesting	c
paintings	c
and	c
ancient	c
sculptures	c
in	i
which	c
we	c
all	i
are	i
keen	c
to	c
see	c
it	i
.	c

The	c
show	c
includes	c
the	c
latest	c
fashion	i
wear	i
,	c
sports	i
wear	i
for	i
spare	i
time	i
,	c
make	i
up	i
and	c
hairstyles	c
.	c

At	c
the	c
same	c
time	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
for	c
most	c
of	c
us	c
because	c
we	c
are	c
going	c
to	c
study	c
"	c
Art	c
and	c
Design	c
"	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

We	c
agreed	c
in	c
the	c
class	c
to	i
visit	c
this	c
show	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
14	c
March	c
in	c
the	c
afternoon	c
after	c
lunch	c
instead	c
of	c
shopping	i
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

Just	c
think	i
that	c
you	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
shopping	c
,	c
clubbing	c
or	c
to	c
a	c
restaurant	c
with	c
friends	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
one	c
hand	c
I	c
can	c
understand	c
how	c
important	c
it	c
is	c
for	c
the	c
journalists	c
to	c
take	c
pictures	c
for	c
the	c
newspaper	c
or	c
magazines	c
they	c
work	c
for	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
the	c
way	c
how	i
they	c
earn	c
money	c
,	c
of	c
course	c
.	c

But	c
on	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
mention	c
that	c
they	c
are	i
going	i
too	c
far	c
sometimes	c
to	c
take	i
a	c
picture	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
Lady	i
Diana	c
.	c

Well	c
,	c
this	c
will	i
be	i
an	c
open	c
question	c
to	c
anyone	c
.	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
go	i
to	c
Camp	c
California	c
in	c
the	c
USA	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
further	c
information	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
only	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
this	c
is	c
the	c
only	c
month	c
that	c
I	c
am	c
on	c
holiday	c
each	c
year	c
.	c

About	c
accommodation	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
tents	i
because	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
a	c
new	c
experience	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
pleasant	i
to	c
have	c
the	c
opportunity	c
to	c
practice	i
sports	c
as	c
well	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
need	c
some	c
more	c
information	c
let	c
me	c
know	c
.	c

Despite	c
the	c
fact	c
that	c
it	i
love	c
shopping	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
agree	c
that	c
it	c
is	c
not	c
"	c
always	c
"	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
want	c
to	c
buy	c
a	c
Christmas	c
present	c
buy	c
it	c
some	c
days	c
before	c
Christmas	c
.	c

Another	c
point	c
is	c
now	i
you	c
do	c
n't	c
need	c
to	c
go	c
out	c
just	i
for	i
shopping	c
.	c

You	c
can	c
buy	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
products	c
by	i
Internet	i
.	c

I	c
believe	c
if	c
you	c
choose	c
the	c
best	c
way	c
or	c
the	c
best	c
day	c
to	c
go	c
shopping	c
you	c
will	c
love	c
it	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sirs	c
,	c

Two	c
weeks	c
ago	c
,	c
I	c
came	c
to	c
London	c
for	c
a	c
week	c
's	c
holiday	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
this	c
show	c
.	c

Then	c
,	c
even	c
if	c
we	c
could	c
enter	c
in	i
the	c
room	i
,	c
the	c
show	c
did	c
n't	c
start	c
before	c
20:15	c
,	c
which	c
is	c
45	c
minutes	c
later	c
than	c
expects	i
.	c

Indeed	c
,	c
we	c
are	c
still	c
waiting	c
on	i
Danny	c
Brook	c
who	c
was	c
not	c
in	c
the	c
piece	i
.	c

And	c
last	c
,	c
at	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
the	c
program	i
,	c
we	c
would	c
like	i
to	c
have	c
a	c
drink	c
in	c
the	c
theatre	c
Restaurant	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
already	c
closed	c
due	c
to	c
the	c
poor	c
attendance	c
.	c

As	c
this	c
evening	c
was	c
for	c
my	c
family	c
and	c
I	i
a	c
wasted	c
one	c
,	c
I	c
permit	c
myself	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
for	c

REPORT	c
ON	c
DAILY	c
LIFE	c
AT	c
MY	c
SCHOOL	c
,	c
FOR	c
MY	c
ENGLISH	c
TEACHER	c

After	c
our	c
English	c
class	i
'	i
decision	c
to	c
make	c
a	c
short	c
film	c
about	c
daily	c
life	c
in	c
my	c
school	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
asked	c
to	c
write	c
a	c
report	c
about	c
interesting	c
lessons	c
and	c
activities	c
that	c
should	c
be	c
filmed	c
.	c

As	c
all	c
the	c
students	c
are	c
different	c
from	c
each	c
other	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
essential	c
to	c
show	c
many	c
aspects	c
of	c
the	c
school	c
.	c

One	c
event	c
that	c
should	c
not	c
be	c
missed	c
to	i
film	i
,	i
is	c
the	c
weekly	c
football	c
game	c
between	c
teachers	c
and	c
students	c
,	c
which	c
shows	c
how	c
well	c
they	c
get	c
along	c
with	c
each	c
other	c
.	c

The	c
cooks	c
are	c
very	c
friendly	c
and	c
excellent	c
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
I	c
suggest	c
that	c
our	c
English	c
class	c
seriously	c
takes	c
into	c
consideration	c
my	c
suggestions	c
when	c
making	c
the	c
video	c
.	c

Because	c
the	c
above	c
mentioned	c
events	c
are	c
the	i
most	i
praised	i
or	i
criticised	i
ones	i
by	i
all	i

INDIAN	c
DEMURO	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
believe	c
I	c
have	c
the	c
appropriate	c
qualification	i
to	c
stay	c
two	c
weeks	c
at	c
camp	c
California	c
.	c

It	c
could	i
be	c
wonderful	c
to	c
see	c
you	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c
.	c

I	c
get	i
experience	c
in	i
the	i
last	c
summer	c
.	c

Specially	c
at	i
sailing	c
and	c
swimming	c
.	c

Anyway	c
I	c
am	c
hard	i
working	i
for	i
the	i
word	i
cup	i
at	i
sailing	i
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
how	c
is	i
the	i
weather	i
in	c
July	c
?	c

Because	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
prepare	c
all	c
my	c
staf	i
and	c
I	c
am	c
sure	c
it	c
would	i
be	c
a	c
great	c
experience	c
despite	c
the	i
cost	i
of	i
living	i
.	c

Hi	c
,	c
how	c
are	c
you	c
?	c

Anyway	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
fantastic	i
you	i
ca	c
n't	c
imagine	c
how	i
was	i
the	i
concert	i
like	c
?	c

However	i
,	i
I	c
was	c
responsible	c
for	c
check	i
in	i
for	i
the	c
entrance	c
then	i
I	c
must	i
gave	i
a	c
sit	i
to	c
everyone	c
.	c

Anyway	c
I	c
enjoed	i
so	i
much	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
n't	c
been	c
to	c
a	c
concert	c
before	c
so	c
the	c
atmosphier	i
was	c
really	c
good	c
.	c

I	c
should	i
n't	i
forgot	i
my	c
experience	c
in	c
my	c
life	i
.	c

So	c
keep	c
in	c
touch	c
.	c

A	i
lot	i
of	i
love	i
,	c

Dear	c
Ms	c
Jane	c
Clark	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
that	c
I	c
enjoyed	c
the	c
International	c
Arts	c
Festival	c
held	c
on	c
21-22	c
November	c
this	c
year	c
.	c

I	c
liked	c
the	c
plays	c
and	c
the	c
films	c
most	c
.	c

You	c
had	c
picked	c
up	i
unknown	c
but	c
talented	c
directors	c
'	c
films	c
and	c
they	c
were	c
really	c
worth	c
watching	c
.	c

And	c
the	c
concerts	c
were	c
also	c
excellent	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
found	i
some	c
things	c
which	c
I	c
think	c
I	c
should	c
point	c
out	c
.	c

Some	c
concert	c
halls	c
were	c
not	c
big	c
enough	c
to	c
have	i
the	c
audience	c
.	c

To	c
make	c
it	c
more	c
enjoyable	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
be	c
grateful	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
welcome	i
my	c
comments	c
on	i
it	c
.	c

A	c
Japanese	c
folk	c
story	c
"	i
a	i
bamboo	i
princess	i
"	c

and	c
asked	c
them	c
to	c
do	c
impossible	c
things	c
because	c
she	c
did	c
n't	c
want	c
to	c
get	c
married	c
.	c

One	c
day	c
,	c
the	c
old	c
couple	c
saw	c
the	c
princess	c
crying	c
.	c

When	c
they	c
asked	c
her	c
,	i
she	c
said	c
"	i
I	c
am	c
from	c
the	c
moon	c
and	c
I	c
will	c
have	c
to	c
go	c
back	c
soon	c
"	c
.	c

They	c
really	c
loved	c
her	c
and	c
they	c
asked	c
a	c
prince	c
who	c
loved	c
the	c
princess	c
to	c
protect	c
her	c
.	c

But	c
,	c
one	c
the	i
day	c
,	c
the	c
princess	c
went	c
back	c
to	c
the	c
moon	c
with	c
guards	c
from	c
the	c
moon	c
although	c
the	c
prince	c
and	c
his	c
army	c
tried	c
hard	c
to	c
protect	c
her	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
the	c
letter	c
which	c
brought	c
me	c
such	c
good	c
news	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
will	c
give	c
you	c
with	c
pleasure	c
some	c
information	c
about	c
myself	c
you	c
need	c
to	c
have	c
.	c

To	c
be	c
honest	c
,	c
the	c
only	c
suitable	c
time	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
travel	c
is	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
my	c
session	c
at	c
the	c
University	c
will	c
have	c
finished	c
only	c
in	i
the	c
end	c
of	c
June	c
.	c

As	c
I	c
have	c
a	c
chance	c
to	c
do	c
2	c
activities	c
while	c
I	c
am	c
at	c
the	c
Camp	c
,	c
I	c
will	c
choose	c
singing	c
which	i
I	c
am	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
and	i
swimming	c
which	i
I	c
am	c
fond	c
of	c
but	c
unfortunately	i
,	c
not	c
a	c
professional	c
.	c

Eternal	c
crowds	c
,	c
high	c
prices	c
,	c
long	c
hours	c
of	c
choosing	c
a	c
suitable	c
thing	c
,	c
that	c
is	c
what	c
shopping	c
means	c
to	c
me	c
.	c

Especially	i
,	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
support	i
to	c
do	i
shopping	c
with	c
my	c
mother	c
:	c
it	c
takes	c
so	c
much	c
time	c
that	c
later	c
I	c
regret	c
of	i
agreeing	c
to	c
go	c
with	c
.	i

Shopping	c
is	c
a	c
personal	c
art	c
and	c
everybody	c
has	c
his	c
own	c
way	c
to	i
do	i
it	c
.	c

Some	c
go	c
just	c
to	c
kill	i
the	i
time	i
others	i
-	i
to	c
look	c
at	c
something	c
new	c
,	i
I	c
am	c
in	c
the	c
third	c
group	c
-	c
previously	i
I	c
think	c
of	c
what	c
I	c
will	c
buy	c
and	c
go	c
straight	c
to	c
the	c
department	c
I	c
need	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
's	c
a	c
great	c
idea	c
.	i

Advertisement	i
is	i
written	i
that	c
you	c
invite	c
stars	c
and	c
artist	i
from	c
around	c
the	c
world	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
you	c
should	c
invite	c
from	i
ten	c
countries	c
because	c
there	c
are	c
more	c
and	c
more	c
stars	c
and	c
artists	c
in	c
the	c
world	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
a	c
good	c
idea	c
but	c
some	c
concert	c
halls	c
are	c
too	c
small	c
.	c

Because	c
of	c
these	i
,	c
people	c
are	c
bored	c
quickly	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
we	c
know	i
a	c
writer	i
life	c
or	c
how	c
is	i
he	i
writing	c
it	i
?	i
it	i
's	i
very	i
significant	c
thing	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
excellent	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
!	c

I	c
miss	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
and	c
sorry	c
about	i
did	i
n't	i
write	i
you	c
some	i
letters	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
forgive	c
me	c
.	c

My	c
school	c
opened	c
yesterday	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
very	c
difficult	c
because	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
anybody	c
.	c

However	c
;	i
today	c
I	c
used	i
to	c
my	c
school	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
got	i
two	c
sweet	c
girls	c
.	c

But	c
this	c
school	c
has	c
got	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
rules	c
and	c
in	c
our	c
class	c
,	i
we	c
have	c
been	c
talking	c
about	c
Rules	i
,	c
both	c
at	c
home	c
and	c
at	c
school	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
very	c
boring	c
.	c

You	c
continuously	c
must	c
study	c
hard	c
.	c

I	c
feel	c
very	c
bad	c
because	c
what	c
you	c
are	c
allowed	c
I	c
are	i
n't	i
allowed	c
to	c
do	c
at	c
home	c
.	c

Are	i
you	c
understand	c
me	c
?	c

Can	c
I	c
change	c
my	c
school	c
?	c

Please	c
you	i
will	i
write	c
me	c
a	c
letter	c
quickly	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
"	i
Over	c
The	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
I	i
saw	c
in	c
your	c
theatre	c
last	c
week	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
you	c
did	c
not	c
tell	c
the	c
truth	c
about	c
starring	i
.	c

The	c
advertisement	c
of	i
the	c
musical	c
said	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	i
unfortunately	i
there	c
was	c
someone	c
else	c
-	c
an	c
actor	c
which	i
I	c
do	c
not	c
like	c
and	c
if	c
I	c
have	i
known	c
that	c
he	c
was	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
I	i
woud	i
not	c
have	c
come	i
to	c
see	c
him	c
.	c

Forty	i
five	i
minutes	c
later	c
!	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
could	c
be	c
your	c
nice	c
apologise	i
for	c
all	c
my	c
problems	c
and	c
disappointments	c
.	c

Contemporary	i
modern	i
technology	c
is	c
a	c
very	c
important	c
aspect	c
of	c
our	c
lives	c
.	c

In	c
fact	c
modern	i
technology	c
was	c
already	c
very	c
popular	c
and	c
comonly	i
used	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
born	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
cannot	c
say	c
that	c
it	c
changed	c
my	c
life	c
rapidly	i
.	c

For	c
example	c
I	i
am	c
woken	c
up	c
by	c
my	c
electronic	c
alarm-clock	c
,	c
then	c
I	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
bathroom	c
and	c
there	c
is	c
hot	c
and	c
cold	c
water	c
,	i
next	i
I	c
eat	c
my	c
breakfast	c
and	c
listen	c
to	c
the	c
radio	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
we	c
cannot	c
talk	c
only	c
about	c
changes	i
which	c
the	i
modern	c
technology	c
has	c
brought	c
to	c
our	c
lives	c

I	c

it	c
would	c
be	c

Dear	c
Ms.	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
answer	c
about	i
your	c
invitation	c
which	c
I	c
have	c
receved	i
as	c
a	c
first	c
winner	i
.	c

I	c
am	i
very	i
delighted	c
to	c
visit	c
the	i
two	c
weeks	c
Camp	c
California	c
in	c
the	c
U.S.A.	c
.	c

This	c
would	c
be	c
an	c
ideal	c
opportunity	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
visit	c
the	c
United	c
States	c
to	c
learn	c
the	i
American	c
way	c
of	c
life	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
'd	c
like	i
to	i
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
tents	c
,	i
that	i
would	c
be	c
the	c
first	c
chance	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
sleep	c
on	c
the	c
outskirts	c
of	c
California	c
.	c

It	c
could	c
be	c
very	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

Last	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
no	c
experience	c
in	i
abroad	i
.	c

Which	c
clothes	c
should	c
I	c
take	c
?	c

May	i
be	i
there	c
are	c
some	c
occasions	c
which	i
I	c
have	c
to	c
pay	c
myself	i
.	c

As	c
above	i
mentioned	i
,	c
please	c
take	i
care	i
to	c
give	c
me	c
more	c
information	c
,	c
and	c
if	c
you	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
more	c
,	c
please	c
telephone	c
me	c
for	c
further	c
discussion	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
a	c
largish	c
city	c
and	c
has	c
a	c
population	c
of	c
over	c
eight	c
million	c
.	c

I	c
went	c
to	c
school	c
there	c
for	c
twelve	c
years	c
.	c

There	c
are	c
all	c
kinds	c
of	c
facilities	c
what	i
you	c
can	c
imagine	c
.	c

Most	c
of	c
the	c
people	c
,	i
they	i
like	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
centre	i
of	c
City	i
that	i
's	c
Meong-Dong	c
where	c
is	i
the	i
uderground	i
acade	i
and	c
several	c
businesses	c
have	c
their	c
head	i
quarter	i
there	c
.	c

That	c
does	c
n't	c
cost	c
much	c
.	c

If	c
I	c
go	c
to	c
visit	c
my	c
family	c
in	c
Korea	c
,	c
I	c
usually	c
walk	c
along	c
the	c
Meong-Dong	c
streets	c
,	c
and	c
am	i
enjoying	i
to	i
have	i
eye-shopping	i
.	c

But	c
there	c
are	i
alwalys	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
traffic	c
at	c
all	c
times	c
,	c
and	c
the	c
air	c
is	c
so	c
polluted	c
that	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
even	c
breathe	c
.	c

I	c
always	c
feel	c
very	c
tired	c
after	c
the	c
shopping	c
because	c
of	c
unfrendly	i
people	c
who	c
are	c
too	c
busy	c

This	c

The	c
man	c
was	c

and	c
his	c

and	c
they	c
left	c
the	c

They	c

When	c
the	c

about	c

These	c
days	c
people	c
have	i
been	i
shopping	c
more	c
often	c
than	c
they	c
used	c
to	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
shopping	c
can	c
be	c
a	c
good	c
thing	c
if	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
possibility	i
to	c
forget	c
about	c
all	c
the	c
problems	c
you	c
have	c
,	c
even	c
if	c
it	c
is	c
just	c
for	c
a	c
moment	c
.	c

It	c
relieves	c
you	c
from	c
the	c
pressure	c
of	c
life	c
while	c
you	c
are	c
looking	c
for	c
something	c
to	c
buy	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
sometimes	c
you	c
can	i
not	c
find	c
a	c
variety	c
of	c
goods	c
and	c
you	c
eventually	c
buy	c
a	c
low	c
quality	c
product	c

Dear	c

I	c
recived	i
your	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
excited	c
about	c

One	c
of	c
the	c
activities	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
do	c
is	c
Climbing	c
,	i
I	c
have	c
n't	c
done	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
it	c
but	c
I	c
've	c
always	c
found	c
it	c
interesting	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
this	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
good	c
opportunity	c
to	c
become	c
better	c
in	i
it	c

Hello	c
girl	c
how	i
are	c
you	c
doing	c
this	i
days	c
.	i

It	c
was	c
so	c
exciting	c
.	c

The	c
next	c
second	c
I	c
was	c
in	c
front	c
of	c
more	c
than	c
2	c
thousand	c
people	c
dancing	c
with	c
The	c
Backstreet	c
Boys	c
.	c

Well	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
go	c
now	c
.	c

Hope	c
to	c
hear	c
from	c
you	c
later	c
on	i
.	c

At	i
first	i
,	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
say	c
how	c
I	i
am	i
happy	i
to	c
have	c
won	c
this	c
prize	c
and	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
because	c
I	c
can	i
not	i
sleep	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
(	c
it	c
is	c
too	c
hot	c
and	c
the	c
floor	c
is	c
too	c
hard	c
for	c
my	c
back	c
)	c
.	c

Concerning	c
the	c
two	c
activities	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
choose	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
swim	c
and	c
play	c
tennis	c
(	c
I	c
have	c
a	c
good	c
level	c
in	i
each	c
sports	i
)	c
.	c

Finally	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
prepare	i
and	c
which	i
sorts	c
of	c
clothes	c
are	c
usually	c
weared	i
in	c
California	c
.	c

Pablo	c
Fernandez	c

It	c
use	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
technics	i
that	c
we	c
learn	c
in	c
other	c
classes	c
.	c

It	c
gives	c
us	c
the	i
knowledge	c
usefull	i
for	c
many	c
school	c
club	i
like	i
the	c
"	c
marathon	c
shell	c
"	c
club	c
or	c
the	c
robotich	i
club	c
.	c

Besides	c
it	c
gives	i
all	c
the	c
areas	c
covered	c
by	c
a	c
mecanic	i
ingenier	i
and	c
it	c
is	c
very	c
important	c
in	c
a	c
school	c
where	c
you	c
will	c
probably	c
become	c
a	c
mecanic	i
ingenier	i
It	i
lets	c
us	c
specify	i
our	c
abilities	c
in	i
the	c
part	c
of	c
mecanics	i
that	c
we	c
prefer	c
.	c

Actually	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
a	c
regret	c
,	i
there	c
is	c
no	c
ethic	i
lessons	i
,	i
It	c
would	c
show	c
us	c
how	c
use	i
our	c
knowledge	c
.	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
you	i
to	c
give	c
you	c
the	c
information	c
you	c
need	c
,	c
but	c
first	c
of	c
all	c
I	c
would	i
say	c
that	c
I	c
am	c
really	c
delighted	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
thank	i
you	c
.	c

I	c
expect	c
that	c
these	c
two	c
weeks	c
will	c
be	c
as	i
a	c
big	c
rest	c
.	c

Third	c
,	c
you	c
need	c
to	c
know	c
which	c
sport	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
to	i
practise	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
choice	i
photography	c
and	c
tennis	c
.	c

To	c
finish	c
,	c
I	c
wonder	c
if	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
bring	c
some	c
money	c
or	c
if	c
all	i
has	c
been	c
already	c
payed	i
and	i
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
should	c
I	c
bring	c
?	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Our	c
engineer	i
school	c
is	c
specealized	i
in	c
mecanics	i
and	c
thermodynamics	c
.	c

Needless	i
to	i
said	i
that	i
we	c
must	c
faces	i
our	c
attention	c
to	c
these	c
fields	c
.	c

First	c
,	c
we	c
could	c
film	c
fluid	i
mecanics	i
lessons	c
and	c
general	i
mecanics	i
lessons	c
.	c

I	c
wonder	c
if	c
we	c
could	c
not	c
feet	i
between	i
some	i
short	i
view	i
of	c
the	c
laboratories	c
,	c
in	c
which	c
we	c
could	c
show	c
student	i
making	i
experimentations	i
.	c

In	c
order	c
to	c
strike	i
people	c
who	c
will	c
watch	c
the	c
film	c
,	c
we	c
could	c
record	i
student	i
drawing	c
on	c
the	c
big	c
drawing	c
tables	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
do	c
the	c
same	c
for	c
thermodynamics	c
.	c

We	c
have	c
to	c
show	c
sports	c
at	c
school	c
and	c
all	c
activities	i
that	c
we	c
are	c
offered	c
.	c

Futur	i
students	c
could	c
appreciate	c
to	i
come	i
if	c
they	c
could	c
still	c
practise	i
their	c
sport	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
want	c
further	c
information	c
or	c
if	c
you	c
disagree	c
,	c
tell	c
me	c
it	i

on	c

I	c

Furthermore	c

Some	c
questions	c

What	i
about	i
the	c
average	c
temperature	c
at	c
the	c

on	i
July	c
?	c

What	c
are	c
the	c
better	i
clothes	c
to	c

at	c
the	c
camp	c
?	c

In	c
the	c
former	c
some	c
of	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
physical	c
laws	c
are	c
experimentally	c
verified	c

Dear	c
Mr.	c
Robertson	c
,	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
say	c
"	c
thank	c
you	c
"	c
for	c
this	c
London	i
trip	i
plan	i
.	c

It	c
seems	c
it	c
's	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
a	i
great	c
fun	c
.	c

The	c
show	c
's	c
date	c
is	c
very	c
convinient	i
-	c
March	c
14	c
-	c
,	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
on	c
Central	i
Exhibition	c
Hall	c
so	c
I	c
do	c
not	c
think	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
problem	c
to	c
get	c
there	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
know	c
,	c
we	c
all	c
come	c
from	c
different	c
countries	c
and	c
we	c
are	c
keen	c
on	i
learning	i
some	c
other	c
things	c
about	c
English	c
culture	c
besides	c
the	c
language	c
itself	c
.	c

Joining	i
this	c
fashion	c
and	c
leisure	c
show	c
,	c
we	c
will	c
get	c
the	c
chance	c
to	c
see	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
enjoyable	c
and	c
different	c
things	c
,	c
such	c
as	c
new	c
hair	c
styles	c
and	c
make	i
up	i
ways	i
,	c
or	c
what	c
is	i
fashion	i
in	i
London	i
recently	i
.	c

Briefly	c
,	c
we	c
would	c
be	c
happy	c
if	c
we	c
could	c
see	c
this	c
show	c
instead	c
of	c
the	c
Science	c
Museum	c
.	c

We	c
can	c
find	c
another	c
chance	i
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
Science	c
Museum	c
in	i
any	c
other	c
day	c
,	c
but	c
this	c
show	c
is	c
just	c
for	i
this	c
Tuesday	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
,	i
it	c
would	i
n't	i
cause	c
a	c
trouble	i
to	c
change	c
the	c
programme	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

It	c
can	c
be	c
a	c
lover	c
,	c
a	c
hobby	c
or	c
a	c
habit	c
.	c

Thinking	c
about	c
famous	c
people	c
,	c
we	c
generally	c
tend	c
to	c
ignore	c
this	c
need	c
.	c

Consequently	c
we	c
demand	c
to	c
know	c
every	c
single	c
detail	c
about	c
them	c
and	c
their	c
lives	c
.	c

Because	c
they	c
have	c
to	c
spend	c
too	i
much	c
time	c
in	c
front	c
of	c
other	c
people	c
,	c
they	c
are	c
even	c
more	c
sensitive	c
about	c
their	c
privacy	c
.	c

The	c
situation	c
much	i
be	c
much	c
worse	c
for	c
the	c
ones	c
who	c
have	c
become	c
famous	c
without	c
desiring	c
this	i
.	c

Obviously	c
,	c
there	c
is	c
no	c
point	c
in	c
saying	c
"	c
famous	c
people	c
have	c
a	c
right	c
to	c
their	c
own	c
live.	i
"	c

Dear	c
manager	c
,	c

My	c
name	c
is	c
Marcia	c
Fomalar	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
writting	i
to	c
make	i
you	c
know	c
how	c
disappointed	c
I	c
felt	c
when	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
musical	c
show	i
of	i
the	c
London	c
theatre	c
.	c

This	c
was	c
my	c
first	c
problem	c
.	c

At	c
19:15	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
impatient	c
waiting	i
for	c
the	c
show	c
begins	i
and	i
a	c
man	c
anounced	i
that	c
the	c
show	c
will	i
start	c
at	c
20:15	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
to	c
wait	c
more	c
that	c
an	c
hour	c
outside	c
the	c
theatre	c
because	c
to	c
make	c
matters	c
worse	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
spend	c
the	c
time	c
in	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
.	c

The	c
reason	c
they	c
gave	c
me	c
it	i
was	c
closed	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
being	c
repaired	c
.	c

Finaly	i
the	c
show	c
started	c
and	c
to	c
my	c
sorprise	i
my	c
favourite	c
actor	c
Danny	c
Brooke	c
had	c
been	c
replaced	c
by	c
another	c
actor	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

My	c
grandmother	c
loves	c
the	i
parties	c
and	c
when	c
she	c
was	c
young	c
she	c
used	c
to	c
organise	c
big	c
parties	c
for	c
all	c
the	i
family	c
and	c
friends	c
.	c

It	c
seems	i
to	i
be	c
the	c
bigger	i
party	c
of	c
her	c
life	c
.	c

She	c
loved	c
the	c
idea	c
and	c
said	c
she	c
had	c
differents	i
shows	c
so	c
to	i
decide	i
which	c
could	i
be	c
the	c
most	c
suitable	c
.	c

But	c
after	i
all	i
the	i
party	i
was	i
great	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
reply	c
on	i
your	c
letter	c
concerned	i
about	c
the	c
holidays	i
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
in	c
the	c
U.SA	c
as	i
a	i
first	c
prize	c
in	c
the	c
competition	c
which	c
I	c
fortunately	c
won	c
last	c
month	c
.	c

The	c
other	c
activity	c
that	c
I	c
chose	c
is	c
painting	c
,	i
I	c
am	c
not	c
as	c
well	i
as	c
I	c
want	c
,	c
nevertheless	c
I	c
think	c
I	c
can	c
inprove	i
my	c
skills	c
during	c
this	c
course	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
rather	c
tends	i
than	c
log	i
cabins	i
for	c
accommodation	i
because	c
the	i
last	c
summer	c
I	c
had	c
the	c
great	c
opportunity	c
to	c
be	i
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
and	c
now	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
know	c
the	i
other	c
one	i
.	i

I	c
am	c
sure	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
thrilling	c
to	c
stay	c
near	i
the	i
nature	i
and	c
at	i
the	c
same	c
time	c
,	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
new	c
experience	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

will	c

interested	c
on	i

about	c

The	i
least	i
but	i
not	i
the	i
last	i
,	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
students	c
(	c
almost	c
85	c
%	c
)	c
think	c
that	c
the	c
extra-activities	i
organised	c
by	c
the	c
social	c
programme	c
,	i
has	i
became	i
really	c
exciting	c
,	i
so	i
they	c
suggest	c
filming	c
these	c
activites	c
during	c
the	c
weekend	c
,	c
for	c
example	c
"	c
the	c
full	c
day	c
in	c
Oxford	c
"	c
because	c
for	i
those	c
that	i
did	c
not	c
have	c
the	c
opportunity	c
to	c
go	c
there	c
,	i
could	c
see	c
how	c
great	c
it	c
was	c
and	c
then	c
they	c
can	c
attend	c
the	c
next	c
time	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
can	c
see	c
,	c
my	c
clasemates	i
and	c
almost	c
everybody	c
in	c
the	c
school	c
are	c
happy	c
with	c
the	c
facilities	c
and	c
activities	c
that	c
we	c
have	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
need	c
more	c
information	c
and	i
the	c
sheets	c
that	c

To	c

Manager	c
of	c
the	c
Theatre	c

During	c
the	c
week	c
we	c
descide	i
where	c
we	c
want	i
to	c
go	c
,	i
we	i
all	c
agree	i
to	c
listen	c
to	c
music	c
so	c
than	i
we	c
descide	i
to	c
come	i
to	c
your	c
musical	c
show	c
and	c
listen	c
to	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c

That	c
evening	c
we	c
do	i
n't	i
want	c
to	c
have	c
our	c
supper	c
before	c
the	c
show	c
Anyway	i
I	c
though	i
it	c
will	i
be	c
too	c
early	c
to	c
eat	c
and	c
also	c
because	i
the	i
time	i

you	i

have	i
say	i
:	c
"	c

after	c
the	c

"	c
.	c

so	i
we	c
did	c
,	c
but	c
unforturnily	i
it	c
was	c
close	i
and	c
I	c
was	c
so	c
dissapointed	i
about	c
it	c
,	c
nor	i
only	c
that	i
we	c
have	i
expected	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
to	c
be	i
the	i
actor	i
of	i
starring	i
.	c

Why	c
is	c
it	c
every	i
thing	i
that	c
on	i
the	i
canidates	i
were	i
wrong	c
and	c
different	c
what	i
we	c
had	i

We	c
do	c
n't	c
expect	c
much	i
bad	i
to	c
happened	i
in	i
our	c
hoilday	i

but	c
this	c
was	i
perfectic	i
show	i
as	i
well	i

it	c
was	c
the	c
worstest	i
show	c
and	c
theatre	c
I	c
have	c
never	i
been	c
in	i
my	c
life	c

P.S.	c
please	i
would	c
you	c
like	i
to	i
explain	i
why	c
?	i

We	c
would	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c

Accommodation	i
in	i
log	c
cabins	c
would	c
be	c
better	c
for	c
me	c
,	c
because	c
they	c
are	c
more	c
comfortable	c
.	c

One	c
of	c
the	c
activities	c
I	c
will	c
do	c
is	c
tennis	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
am	c
just	c
a	c
beginner	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
someone	c
to	c
teach	c
me	c
.	c

The	c
other	c
activity	c
will	c
be	c
photography	c
,	c
which	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

Bradley	c
Tudela	c
.	c

The	c
good	c
side	c
of	c
this	c
activity	c
is	c
that	c
it	c
can	c
be	c
a	i
good	i
leisure	i
,	c
provided	c
you	c
are	c
not	c
in	c
a	c
hurry	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
when	c
the	c
shops	c
are	c
crowded	c
(	c
for	c
instance	c
,	c
just	c
before	c
Christmas	c
)	c
,	c
going	c
shopping	c
can	c
be	c
very	c
stressful	c
,	c
as	c
you	c
cannot	c
walk	c
freely	i
and	c
have	c
to	c
bear	i
endless	c
queues	c
.	c

Another	c
problem	c
is	c
the	c
shortage	c
of	c
trolleys	c
in	c
supermarkets	c
,	c
which	c
is	c
very	c
common	c
when	c
they	c
are	c
full	c
of	c
people	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

Last	c
Saturday	c
evening	c
me	c
and	c
my	c
family	c
went	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
"	c
at	c
your	c
theatre	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
this	c
letter	c
to	c
express	i
the	c
reasons	c
of	i
our	c
disappointment	c
about	i
that	c
evening	c
.	c

The	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
show	c
said	c
that	c
there	c
was	i
discounts	c
available	c
for	c
children	c
so	c
we	c
brought	c
them	c
and	c
when	c
we	c
bought	c
the	c
tickets	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
pay	c
the	c
maximum	c
price	c
for	c
everyone	c
.	c

Then	c
,	c
when	c
we	c
got	c
in	c
,	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
wait	c
because	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
forty-five	c
minutes	c
late	c
.	c

When	c
the	c
show	c
had	c
finished	c
we	c
decided	c
to	c
go	c
for	c
a	c
snack	c
to	i
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
and	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
without	c
giving	i
any	c
reason	c
for	i
it	i
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
reasonable	c
if	c
we	c
could	c
have	c
our	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
and	c
this	c
was	c
the	c
reason	c
why	c
the	c
party	c
was	c
n't	c
as	c
succesful	i
as	c
we	c
thought	c
.	c

My	i
and	c
my	c
friends	c
,	c
including	c
Pat	c
,	c
were	c
preparing	c
a	c
surprise	c
for	c
Sam	c
's	c
birthday	c
.	c

We	c
decided	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
his	c
place	c
(	c
I	c
've	c
got	c
a	c
copy	c
of	c
the	c
key	c
)	c
the	c
evening	c
before	c
his	c
birthday	c
while	c
he	c
was	c
at	c
work	c
and	c
decorate	c
the	c
lounch	i
,	c
then	c
turn	c
off	c
the	c
lights	c
and	c
wait	c
for	c
him	c
in	c
silence	c
until	c
he	c
arrived	c
.	c

Two	c
days	c
before	c
the	c
event	c
Carol	c
,	c
Albert	c
,	c
Sam	c
and	c
me	c
went	c
to	c
visit	c
Pat	c
in	c
her	c
house	c
and	c
she	c
invited	c
us	c
to	c
stay	c
for	c
dinner	c
.	c

Sam	c
look	i
at	c
us	c
surprised	c
and	c
said	c
"	i
What	c
's	c
going	c
on	c
?	c
"	c

Everybody	c
had	c
to	c
change	c
plans	i
and	c
the	c
party	c
became	c
a	c
normal	c
party	c
.	c

We	c
were	c
a	c
bit	c
disappointed	c
but	c
we	c
enjoyed	c
anyway	i

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
,	c

With	c
reference	c
to	c
our	c
trip	c
in	i
London	c
,	c
in	i
name	i
of	i
all	c
of	c
us	c
,	c
English	i
class	c
in	c
this	c
college	c
,	c
we	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
special	c
atention	i
in	c
have	i
organised	i
a	c
good	c
programme	c
to	c
know	i
interesting	i
and	c
cultural	c
points	i
in	c
London	c
.	c

We	c
have	i
thought	i
that	c
The	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
to	c
give	c
us	c
more	c
information	c
about	c
the	c
main	c
transformation	i
in	i
nowdays	i
in	c
England	c
about	i
fashions	i
,	c
Leisure	i
,	c
sports	c
and	c
style	i
of	i
life	i
.	c

However	c
your	i
decision	c
in	i
changing	i
a	i
little	i
bit	i
our	i
programme	i
,	i
we	i
would	c
suggest	c
just	c
on	i
Tuesday	i
afternoon	i
no	i
doing	i
shop	i
,	c
everything	i
else	c
could	c
stay	c
the	c
same	c
.	c

We	c
are	c
really	c
satisfied	c
in	i
sightseeing	i
by	c
bus	c
,	c
in	i
go	i
to	c
the	c
National	c
Gallery	c
,	c
but	c
the	c
whole	c
class	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
The	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	i
will	i
be	c
free	c
.	c

We	c
are	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
your	c
answer	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
dangerous	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
kew	i
I	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
.	c

Everything	c
was	c
going	c
so	c
bad	i
and	c
I	c
knew	c
,	c
I	c
could	c
die	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
I	c
've	c
got	c
a	c
brother	c
who	c
likes	c
to	c
live	c
in	c
dangerous	i
and	c
poor	i
way	c
and	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
how	c
,	c
but	c
he	c
could	i
persuade	c
me	c
to	c
go	c
with	c
him	c
to	c
get	c
some	c
drugs	c
,	c
in	i
my	c
25th	c
birthday	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
at	c
home	c
making	i
me	i
up	i
before	c
to	i
go	i
to	c
a	c
restaurant	c
with	c
my	c
friends	c
and	c
,	c
sudenlly	i
,	c
he	c
rang	c
the	c
bell	c
,	i
he	i
was	c
so	c
nervous	i
with	c
a	c
gun	c
in	c
his	c
hands	c
and	c
no	i
longer	i
I	i
could	i
speak	i
he	c
took	c
me	c
out	c
with	c
him	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
tried	c
to	c
think	c
in	i
stopping	c
him	c
,	c
but	c
he	c
was	c
stronger	c
than	c
me	c
and	c
he	c
had	c
used	c
all	c
his	c
power	c
to	c
scared	i
me	c
and	c
he	c
forced	c
me	c
to	c
buy	c
cocain	i
using	c
my	c
cheques	c
.	c

I	c
did	c
n't	c
want	c
,	i
I	i
've	c
never	c
approve	i
his	i
deal	i
with	i
the	i
drug	i
,	c
but	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
do	c
it	c
different	i
.	c

If	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
do	c
it	c
,	c
I	c
knew	c
I	c
would	c
die	c
,	i
my	i
option	c
was	c
my	c
life	c
,	c
but	c
now	c
I	c
have	c
n't	c
any	i
chance	c
to	c
live	c
because	c
I	c
'm	c
in	c
the	i
prison	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
,	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
there	c
were	c
many	c
problems	c
with	c
the	c
musical	i
show	c
.	c

The	c
first	c
problem	c
concerned	c
the	c
main	c
actor	c
of	i
the	c
show	c
.	c

Although	c
it	c
was	c
written	c
in	c
the	c
show	c
's	c
addvertisement	i
that	c
the	c
main	c
actor	c
was	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
it	c
,	c
unfortunately	c
,	c
was	c
not	c
him	c
.	c

The	c
show	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
have	c
started	c
at	c
19:30	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
only	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
,	c
so	c
the	c
public	i
,	c
including	c
me	c
,	c
was	c
forced	c
to	c
wait	c
for	c
fourty	i
five	i
minutes	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
also	c
written	c
in	c
the	c
show	c
's	c
addvertisement	i
that	c
there	c
would	c
be	c
discounts	c
available	c
for	i
the	c
tickets	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
there	c
was	i
not	c
any	c
.	c

Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c

I	i
all	c
happened	c
a	c
year	c
ago	c
,	c
when	c
Pat	c
and	c
I	c
were	c
still	c
best	c
friends	c
and	c
used	c
to	c
tell	c
each	c
other	c
everything	c
.	c

I	c
asked	c
Pat	c
not	c
to	c
tell	c
anyone	c
,	c
and	c
she	c
promised	c
me	c
she	c
would	c
n't	c
.	c

I	c
believed	c
in	c
her	c
and	c
trusted	c
her	c
blindly	c
.	c

I	c
went	c
home	c
that	c
day	c
after	c
having	c
told	c
Pat	c
my	c
deepest	c
secret	c
with	c
a	c
weird	c
feeling	c
in	c
my	c
heart	c
.	c

Suddenly	c
,	c
an	c
enourmous	i
saddness	i
caught	c
me	c
,	c
because	c
Philip	c
had	c
begged	c
me	c
not	c
to	c
tell	c
anyone	c
,	c
so	c
he	c
would	c
definately	i
brake	i
up	c
with	c
me	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
knew	c
I	c
was	c
going	c
to	c
stop	c
talking	c
to	c
Pat	c
,	c
because	c
she	c
had	c
just	c
ruined	c
my	c
happiness	c
and	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
trust	c
her	c
anymore	c
.	c

Now	c
,	c
unfortunately	c
,	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
a	c
boyfriend	c
or	c
a	c
best	c
friend	c
,	c
all	c
because	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
,	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
very	c
disappointing	c
for	c
me	c
that	c
the	c
starring	i
was	c
not	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
as	c
your	c
company	c
had	c
published	i
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
the	c
musical	i
show	c
was	c
said	c
to	c
start	c
at	c
19:30	c
but	c
it	c
really	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
.	c

As	c
a	c
result	c
,	c
we	c
came	c
back	c
home	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
eat	c
some	c
fast	c
food	c
.	c

An	i
other	i
thing	c
is	c
that	c
there	c
was	c
any	i
discount	c
available	c
so	c
we	c
spend	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
money	c
in	i
such	i
a	c
bad	c
show	c
.	c

Before	c
this	c
week	c
ends	c
,	c
I	c
want	c
your	c
company	c
to	c
give	c
me	c
the	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

One	c
day	c
,	c
while	c
I	c
was	c
studying	c
maths	c
,	c
one	c
of	c
my	c
friends	c
,	c
called	c
Pat	c
,	c
asked	c
me	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
coffe	i
with	c
her	c
.	c

We	c
went	c
to	c
a	c
place	c
called	c
'	c
Deli	c
'	c
where	c
we	c
talked	c
a	c
lot	c
about	c
our	c
school	c
,	c
the	c
exams	c
and	c
,	c
as	c
we	c
usually	c
did	c
,	c
about	c
our	c
friends	c
and	c
boy	i
friends	i
.	c

The	c
problem	c
started	c
when	c
I	c
confesed	i
her	i
that	c
I	c
had	c
fall	i
in	c
love	c
with	c
Larry	c
,	c
who	c
was	c
my	c
cousin	c
's	c
boyfriend	c
.	c

In	c
spite	c
of	c
the	c
fact	c
that	c
I	c
told	c
her	c
to	c
keep	c
it	c
as	i
a	c
secret	c
,	c
she	c
went	c
to	c
my	c
cousin	c
's	c
house	c
and	c
made	i
the	i
retelling	i
of	i
what	i
I	i
had	i
exactly	i
told	c
her	c
.	c

As	c
I	c
solved	i
the	c
trouble	i
with	c
my	c
cousin	c
,	c
I	c
understood	c
why	c
my	c
mother	c
had	c
told	c
me	c
that	c
'	c
friends	c
'	c
sometimes	c
were	c
n't	c
as	i
you	c
expected	c
them	c
to	c
be	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
The	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
manager	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
your	c
product	i
.	c

DANNY	c
BROOK	c
is	c
one	c
of	c
my	c
favorite	i
actor	i
so	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
buy	c
a	c
ticket	c
even	i
if	i
I	c
cancel	i
my	c
apointment	i
on	c
that	c
day	c
at	c
18=30	i
and	c
aslo	i
notice	i
of	i
price	i
discount	i
impressed	i
me	i
.	c

In	c
addition	c
different	i
actor	c
appeared	c
on	c
the	c
stage	c
and	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
have	c
dinner	c
about	i
the	c
musical	c
because	c
the	c
restrant	i
had	i
been	i
closed	c
.	c

It	c
made	c
me	c
so	c
dissapoint	i
and	c
angry	c
.	c

You	c
should	c
back	i
my	c
money	c
immedeastry	i
because	c
that	c
night	c
was	c
far	c
from	c
parfect	i
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

He	c
always	c
tried	c
to	c
say	c
nothing	c
and	c
did	c
.	c

But	c
everyone	c
always	c
noticed	i
he	i
had	i
secrets	i
from	i
his	i
face	i
.	c

Whenever	c
he	c
has	c
secrets	i
,	c
his	c
nose	c
moves	c
quickly	c
.	c

He	c
had	i
not	i
liked	i
this	c
habit	c
and	c
had	c
thought	c
it	c
was	c
wrost	i
of	c
him	c
until	c
he	c
solved	c
a	c
big	c
crime	c
.	c

Bank	i
robbers	c
said	i
him	c
if	c
Pat	c
told	c
the	i
fact	i
somebody	i
they	c
killed	i
him	c
.	c

Pat	c
did	c
n't	c
say	c
anything	c
.	c

Then	c
police	i
realized	c
who	c
were	i
bank	i
robbers	i
and	c
arested	i
them	c
.	c

Thanks	c
to	c
his	c
habit	c
,	c
he	c
is	c
still	c
alive	c
and	c
all	c
money	i
were	i
backed	i
to	c
the	c
bank	c
.	c

To	c
the	c
manager	c
of	c
The	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c

I	c
had	c
looked	c
forward	c
to	c
go	i
and	c
see	i
"	c
London	c
's	c
newest	c
and	c
best	c
musical	c
show	c
"	c
-Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
.	c

Very	c
disappointing	c
!	c

For	c
some	c
unknown	c
reason	c
it	c
did	c
not	c
start	c
until	c
20:15	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
take	i
benefit	i
from	i
the	c
discounts	c
available	c
,	c
but	c
when	c
I	c
came	c
to	c
buy	c
my	c
ticket	c
I	c
was	c
told	c
there	c
were	c
no	c
discounts	c
available	c
.	c

After	c
the	c
show	c
I	c
had	c
planned	c
to	c
have	c
dinner	c
at	c
the	c
Theatre	c
Restaurant	c
.	c

Unfortunatly	i
the	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

Indeed	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
a	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
.	c

Therefore	c
I	c
think	c
the	c
least	c
I	c
can	c
ask	c
from	c
you	c
is	c
to	c
give	c
me	c
the	c
money	c
back	c
for	c
the	c
ticket	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
heard	c
that	c
they	c
will	i
read	c
"	c
The	c
Old	c
Man	c
and	c
the	c
Sea	c
"	c
on	c
the	c
radio	c
P1	i
on	i
Wednesday	c
next	c
week	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
really	c
recommend	c
you	c
to	c
listen	c
to	c
it	c
.	c

The	c
basic	c
story	c
of	c
the	c
book	c
is	c
in	c
fact	c
quite	c
simple	c
.	c

He	c
is	c
only	c
aiming	i
for	c
the	c
biggest	c
fishes	c
and	c
he	c
has	c
been	c
unsuccesfull	i

a	c
big	c

hooked	c
and	c
after	c
a	c
long	c

On	c

Mr.	c

this	c
simple	c

This	c
tale	c
is	c
very	c
amazing	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
no	c
surprise	c
Mr.	c
Hemingway	c
was	c
awarded	c

I	c
really	c

you	c
should	c
take	i
your	i
time	i

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
'	c
OVER	c
THE	c
RAINBOW	c
'	c
I	c
attended	c
three	c
days	c
ago	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
the	c
start	i
time	c
was	i
at	i
19.30	c
p.m	c
,	c
but	c
the	c
play	c
started	c
at	c
20.15	c
p.m.	c
People	c
were	c
fed	c
up	c
with	c
waiting	c
so	c
long	c
and	c
most	c
of	c
them	c
apart	i
from	c
me	c
were	i
rather	c
nervous	i
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
the	c
well-known	c
star	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
was	c
n't	c
there	c
,	c
but	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
I	i
had	c
never	c
heard	c
from	i
him	c
.	c

From	c
my	c
point	c
of	c
view	c
I	c
think	c
he	c
was	c
such	c
a	c
very	c
bad	c
actor	c
that	c
was	i
impossible	c
to	c
fine	i
another	c
with	c
the	c
same	c
features	i
.	c

The	c
evening	c
was	c
a	c
disaster	c
and	c
I	c
wonder	c
if	c
I	c
have	c
not	c
the	c
right	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
for	i
returning	i
my	c
money	c
,	c
as	c
I	c
think	c
it	i
is	i
fair	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

I	c
relyied	i
on	c
her	c
and	c
our	c
relationship	c
was	c
excellent	c
.	c

She	c
has	c
given	c
away	i
to	c
my	c
mother	c
that	c
I	c
told	c
her	c
a	c
lie	c
as	c
far	c
as	c
the	c
weekend	c
was	c
concerned	c
.	c

Pat	c
told	c
her	c
I	c
had	c
n't	c
spent	c
those	c
days	c
with	c
her	c
,	c
but	c
with	c
my	c
boyfriend	c
in	c
the	c
mountain	i
.	c

Moreover	c
I	c
was	c
punished	c
hardly	i
by	c
my	c
father	c
and	c
now	c
we	c
do	c
n't	c
talk	c
each	i
other	c
.	c

Since	c
then	c
I	c
have	c
n't	c
seen	c
Pat	c
anymore	c
and	c
she	c
seems	i
not	i
regret	i
that	i
happened	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
'll	c
try	c
to	c
forget	c
her	c
and	c
carry	c
on	c
my	i
life	c
that	i
's	c
all	c

I	c

in	c

no	i
,	i
I	c
know	c
this	c
is	c
other	i
country	c

I	c
was	c
disappointed	c
because	c
you	c
wrote	c
about	c
it	c
!	c

This	c
was	c
a	c
waste	c
of	c
time	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
suppresed	i
when	c
I	c
saw	c

What	c
will	c
clothes	c
be	c
like	c
100	c
years	c
from	c
now	c
?	c

This	c
is	c
very	i
interesting	c
question	c
for	c
us	c
and	c
maybe	c
very	c
important	c
too	c
.	c

We	c
think	c
and	c
speak	i
about	c
it	c
in	c
our	c
families	c
.	c

The	i
people	i
will	c
wear	c
clothes	c
from	i

like	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
,	c

The	c
programme	c
seems	c
to	c
be	c
really	c
interesting	c
,	c
especially	c
visiting	c
the	c
Science	c
Museum	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
the	c
students	c
in	c
my	c
class	c
have	c
seen	c
an	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
,	c
which	c
is	c
going	c
to	c
take	c
place	c
on	c
14th	i
of	c
March	c
at	c
Central	i
Exhibition	c
Hall	c
.	c

What	c
is	c
more	c
,	c
admittion	i
for	c
students	c
is	c
free	c
.	c

It	c
would	c
not	c
be	c
a	c
problem	c
to	c
go	c
shopping	c
on	c
Wednesday	c
in	c
our	c
free	c
time	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Your	i
sincerely	c
,	c

Journalists	c
should	c
not	c
follow	c
them	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
,	c
trying	c
to	c
make	i
an	c
interview	c
or	c
taking	i
an	c
'	c
interesting	c
'	c
picture	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
we	c
could	c
say	c
that	c
they	c
decided	c
to	c
have	c
such	i
kind	c
of	c
life	c
.	c

Maybe	c
sometimes	c
they	c
need	c
to	c
sacrifice	c
their	c
privacy	c
?	c

However	c
,	c
we	c
have	c
got	c
a	c
suggestion	c
:	c
we	c
saw	c
an	c
advertissement	i
for	c
"	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
"	c
which	c
is	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
March	c
14	c
from	c
10:00	c
to	c
19:00	c
.	c

Our	c
request	c
is	c
to	c
change	c
the	c
programme	c
,	c
either	c
you	c
can	c
cancel	c
all	i
the	i
Tuesday	i
and	c
we	c
can	c
enjoy	c
all	c
the	c
exhibition	c
or	c
if	c
you	c
cannot	c
cancel	c
the	c
Museum	c
,	c
we	c
can	c
go	c
there	c
right	c
after	c
because	c
we	c
will	c
have	c
full	i
of	c
time	c
to	c
shopping	i
during	c
our	c
free	c
time	c
on	c
Wednesday	c
.	c

Hoping	c
that	c
you	c
will	c
think	c
about	c
it	c
carefully	c
because	c
we	c
are	c
all	c
very	c
exciting	i
.	c

thanks	c
in	c
advance	c

Does	i
famous	c
people	c
deserve	c
to	c
keep	c
their	c
own	i
life	c
secret	c
?	c

According	i
to	i
me	i
,	c
you	c
ca	i
n't	i
deserve	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
private	c
life	c
when	c
you	c
're	c
famous	c
because	c
when	c
to	i
start	i
you	i
career	c
you	c
know	c
that	c
medias	i
will	c
be	c
hunting	c
you	c
everywhere	c
and	c
more	i
famous	c
you	c
get	c
worst	i
it	c
is	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
because	c
that	c
the	i
life	i
style	i
people	c
wants	i
to	c
know	c
everything	c
,	i
for	c
instance	c
,	c
about	c
their	c
favourite	c
actor	c
or	c
about	c
their	c
president.	c
.	i

therefore	i
,	c
even	c
if	c
I	c
agree	c
sometimes	c
Medias	i
are	i
going	i
too	c
far	c
and	c
write	c
really	c
bad	c
things	c
.	i

And	c
if	c
Medias	i
are	c
too	c
awful	c
they	c
have	c
got	c
law	i
to	c
protect	c
themself	i
.	c

I	c
was	c
pleased	c
to	c
recieve	i
you	i
letter	c
ricently	i
.	c

Now	c
I	c
'm	c
going	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
some	c
information	c
,	i
you	c
asted	i
about	c
.	c

The	c
next	c
thing	c
-	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
spend	c
all	c
nights	i
in	c
tent	i
,	c
so	c
I	c
can	c
move	c
it	c
to	c
the	c
place	c
will	i
better	i
suite	i
me	i
.	c

-	i
I	c
like	c
to	c
wake	c
up	c
with	c
a	c
view	c
to	i
mountains	c
,	c
wich	i
remind	i
me	c
about	i
my	c
5	c
years	i
experience	c
in	i
climbing	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
is	c
it	c
posible	i
,	i
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
continue	c
doing	c
my	c
favorite	i
hobbies	c
in	c
the	c
Camp	c
.	c

And	c
the	c
last	c
question	c
I	c
have	c
-	c

Do	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
bring	c
any	c
special	c
clothes	c
or	c
gize	i
?	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

If	c
you	c
need	c
something	c
you	c
have	c
a	c
choice	c
to	i
borrow	i
it	c
from	c
friends	c
or	c
library	i
,	c
or	c
to	i
bye	i
it	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
the	c
better	i
time	c
for	c
shoping	i
is	c
weekdays	c
,	c
preferably	c
in	c
the	c
morning	c
.	c

To	c
Manager	c
.	c

Then	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
receive	c
my	c
money	c
for	c
the	c
ticket	c
.	c

I	c
went	c
to	c
your	c
theatre	c
to	c
see	c
'	c
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
'	c
last	c
night	c
.	c

But	c
everything	c
was	c
terrible	c
and	c
different	c
from	i
your	c
advertisement	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
the	c
actor	c
was	c
different	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
was	c
disappointed	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
wanted	c
to	c
see	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
in	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

You	c
wrote	c
'	c
discouts	i
available	c
'	c
but	c
they	c
did	c
n't	c
discount	i
.	c

After	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
have	c
my	c
dinner	c
in	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
.	c

You	c
advertised	c
for	i
my	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
.	c

But	c
I	i
was	c
unpleasent	i
because	c
of	c
these	c
things	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
ask	c
you	c
to	c
return	c
some	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

The	c
number	c
is	c
577-6277	c
.	c

(	c
Hotel	c
number	c
)	c
.	c

I	c
wait	c
to	c
hear	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

I	i
think	i
there	i
is	i
nothing	i
not	i
to	i
be	i
influenced	i
by	i
science	i
and	i
technology	i
affects	i
in	i
our	i
daily	i
life	i
nowadays	i
.	c

I	c
always	c
use	c
many	c
electric	c
products	i
;	c
washing	c
machine	c
,	c
dish-washer	c
,	c
vacuum	c
cleaner	c
,	c
blender	c
,	c
juice	i
,	c
fridge	c
.	c

Then	c
it	c
takes	c
about	c
1	c
hour	c
or	c
one	c
and	c
a	c
half	c
to	c
wash	c
.	c

During	i
the	c
washing	c
machine	c
is	c
whirring	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
get	i
my	c
time	c
.	c

Also	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
imagine	c
my	c
life	c
without	c
car	i
.	c

Now	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
live	c
without	c
them	c
.	c

Owing	c
to	c
all	c
of	c
them	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
live	c
very	c
comfortbly	i
.	c

These	c
things	c
provide	c
me	c
all	i
convenience	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
because	c
I	c
receive	i
your	c
letter	c
concerning	c
the	c
prize	c
of	c
two	c
weeks	c
in	c
California	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
the	i
first	c
two	c
weeks	c
of	c
July	c
because	c
in	c
June	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
working	c
and	c
at	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
July	c
I	c
am	c
planing	i
to	c
go	c
to	c
Paris	c
to	c
attend	c
a	c
course	i
of	i
French	i
.	c

In	c
your	c
letter	c
you	c
wrote	c
that	c
I	c
will	c
I	i
the	c
chance	c
to	c
do	c
two	c
activities	c
;	c
First	i
of	c
all	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
play	c
tennis	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
plaing	i
for	c
seven	c
years	c
,	i
secondly	i
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
attend	c
a	c
course	i
of	i
surf	i
but	c
I	c
have	c
just	c
some	c
elementary	c
knowledge	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
also	c
to	c
have	c
more	c
information	c
about	c
the	c
cost	c
and	c
which	i
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
you	c
suggest	c
to	i
bring	i
with	c
me	c
.	c

Your	i
faithfully	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
important	c
to	i
concentrate	i
this	i
video	i
in	i
few	i
but	i
interesting	c
part	i
of	c
our	c
daily	c
life	c
at	c
school	c

Interesting	i
will	i
be	i
to	c
show	c
how	c
the	c
lessons	c
are	c
organize	i
,	c
saing	i
that	c
we	c
are	c
never	c
doing	c
just	c
one	c
activitie	i
during	c
the	c
class	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
great	c
that	c
I	c
could	c
win	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
,	c
which	c
means	c
that	c
I	c
will	c
have	c
the	c
possibility	i
to	c
spend	c
two	c
weeks	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
in	c
the	c
U.S.A.	c
I	c
am	c
sure	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
an	c
exciting	c
experience	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

As	c
request	i
following	i
you	c
will	c
find	c
the	c
information	c
you	c
need	c
.	i

First	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
my	c
company	c
is	c
going	c
to	c
close	c
for	c
holiday	i
at	c
that	c
period	i
and	c
it	c
would	c
suits	i
me	c
very	c
well	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
an	i
accomodation	i
in	c
tent	i
because	c
I	c
enjyoi	i
being	c
outside	c
close	c
to	c
the	i
nature	c
.	c

As	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
tennis	c
and	c
swimming	c
I	c
will	c
choose	c
these	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
two	c
questions	c
.	c

Please	c
let	c
me	c
know	c
which	i
clothes	c
do	i
I	c
need	c
then	i
and	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
in	c
cash	c
and	c
as	i
travellers	c
cheque	i
shall	i
I	c
take	c
with	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

His	i
title	c
was	c
:	c
"	c
The	c
Mistery	i
of	c
Hunter	c
's	c
Lodge	c
"	c
.	c

The	c
charachter	i
which	i
I	c
liked	c
most	c
was	c
that	c
of	c
Mrs.	c
Havering	c
,	c
the	c
mistress	c
.	c

Although	c
from	c
my	c
point	c
of	c
view	c
she	c
planned	c
the	c
murder	c
of	c
his	c
uncle	c
and	c
was	c
able	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
.	i

I	c
think	c
that	c
her	c
husband	c
only	c
followed	c
what	i
she	i
ordered	i
him	i
.	c

She	c
was	c
the	c
head	i
in	c
this	c
story	c
.	c

The	c
plan	c
was	c
almost	c
perfectly	i
and	c
the	c
police	c
had	i
n't	i
discovered	i
the	c
murderer	c
without	c
the	c
help	c
of	c
Mr.	c
Poirot	c
.	c

Moreover	c
she	c
must	c
have	c
had	c
an	i
"	i
ice	i
blood	i
"	i
and	c
strong	c
nerves	c
to	c
handle	c
in	i
that	c
way	c
.	c

As	c
far	c
as	c
I	c
am	c
concerned	c
I	c
would	c
appreciate	c
to	i
have	i
myself	i
some	i
of	i
her	i
characteristics	i
,	c
like	i
take	i
a	i
decision	i
and	i
handle	i
.	c

First	i
off	i
all	i
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
it	c
has	i
started	i
later	c
than	c
it	c
should	c
to	i
,	i
I	c
had	c
to	c
wait	c
for	c
about	c
fourty-five	i
minutes	c
.	c

Why	c
did	c
you	c
write	c
that	c
they	c
were	c
available	c
?	c

I	c
would	c
to	i
add	i
that	c
I	c
was	c
hungry	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
not	c
such	c
a	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
.	c

First	i
off	i
all	i
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
modern	c
technology	c
has	c
changed	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
very	c
much	c
.	c

I	c
use	c
them	c
very	c
often	c
in	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

Firstly	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
the	c
two	c
weeks	c
that	c
I	c
am	c
going	c
to	c
stay	i
in	i
the	i
Camp	c
California	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
travel	c
on	i
July	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
manager	c
so	c
I	c
can	i
not	i
travel	c
another	c
time	c
.	c

Now	c
I	c
am	c
going	c
to	c
answer	c
a	c
few	c
questions	c
:	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
better	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
terrible	c
backaches	c
so	c
I	c
can	i
not	i
sleep	c
on	c
the	c
floor	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
which	i
type	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
will	i
wear	c
there	c
,	i
would	i
you	c
check	c
the	c
weather	c
forecast	c
for	c
me	c
,	c
please	c
?	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Maria	c
Sophia	c
Candoso	c
.	c

the	c
lost	c
wallet	c

A	c
long	c
time	c
ago	c
,	c
when	c
I	c
started	c
working	c
,	c
I	c
received	c
my	c
first	c
pay	i
and	c
went	c
to	c
a	c
shopping	c
center	c
to	c
spend	c
my	c
money	c
with	i
my	c
credit	c
card	c
.	c

Finaly	i
the	c
day	c
to	c
pay	c
my	c
credit	c
card	c
arrives	i
and	c
where	c
was	c
my	c
money	c
?	c

I	i
've	i
asked	i
my	c
mom	c
and	c
my	c
friends	c
and	c
everybody	i
did	i
n't	i
know	i
where	c
it	c
was	c
.	c

I	c
started	c
to	c
look	c
for	c
my	c
wallet	c
and	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
find	c
it	c
,	c
lighter	i
.	c

Now	c
I	c
was	c
without	c
my	c
money	c
and	c
my	c
wallet	c
.	c

What	c
could	c
I	c
do	c
?	c

Suddenly	c
the	c
door	c
bell	c
rang	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
and	i
old	c
woman	c
asking	c
who	c
was	i
Maria	i
.	c

I	c
said	c
.	c

You	c
may	c
be	c
surprised	c
to	c
receive	c
a	c
letter	c
from	c
us	c
.	c

All	c
the	c
students	c
are	c
happy	c
that	c
we	c
will	c
have	c
othe	i
oppurtinatey	i
,	i
to	c
visit	c
London	c
for	c
three	c
days	c
.	c

This	c
trip	c
would	c
gives	i
us	c
the	c
change	i
to	c
see	c
London	c
and	c
to	c
improve	c
the	i
english	i
language	i
.	c

We	c
all	c
agree	i
to	i
the	c
daily	c
programme	c
during	i
the	c
three	c
days	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
afternoon	c
,	c
the	c
River	i
trip	c
to	c
Greenwich	c
would	i
also	c
be	c
a	c
fantastic	c
experience	c
for	c
us	c
.	c

The	c
reason	c
I	c
write	c
to	c
you	c
,	i
is	c
that	c
we	c
have	c
seen	c
an	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
,	c
for	i
a	i
fiew	i
days	i
.	c

The	c
show	c
includes	c
the	c
latest	c
fashions	c
in	c
the	i
sports	c
clothing	c
and	c
the	c
most	c
fashionable	c
make	i
up	i
and	c
hairstyles	c
.	c

We	c
all	c
think	c
that	c
the	c
London	c
fashion	i
and	c
Leisure	c
show	i
will	c
be	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
for	c
us	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
also	c
normally	c
,	i
that	i
the	c
journalists	c
are	c
after	c
them	c
.	c

They	c
want	c
to	c
get	c
from	c
them	c
all	c
the	c
details	c
of	c
their	c
life	c
,	c
especially	c
from	i
their	c
private	c
.	i

Who	c
got	c
married	c
,	c
who	c
got	c
divorsed	i
or	c
who	c
had	i
a	c
remarkeable	i
changing	i
of	i
his	c
complexion	c
,	c
these	c
are	c
questions	c
,	i
who	i
most	c
journalists	c
are	c
interested	c
in	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
sometimes	c
a	c
real	c
fight	c
who	c
will	c
take	c
the	c
first	c
picture	c
of	c
a	c
film	c
star	c
or	c
a	c
politician	c
.	c

Famous	c
people	c
diserve	i
also	i
to	c
have	c
a	c
private	c
life	c
.	c

Is	i
it	i
normally	i
when	c
you	c
are	c
a	c
star	c
,	i
that	c
everybody	c
wants	c
to	c
know	c
all	c
about	c
you	c
.	c

We	c
shoud	i
n't	i
forget	c
,	i
that	c
for	c
this	c
reason	c
the	c
stars	c
want	c
to	c
keep	c
their	c
private	c
life	c
away	c
from	c
the	c
media	c
!	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
a	c
musical	c
show	c
called	c
'	c
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	i
,	i
that	c
took	i
place	i
in	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
disappointed	c
when	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
see	c
them	c
on	c
the	c
stage	c
.	c

The	c
second	c
problem	c
was	c
the	c
time	c
of	c
the	c
play	c
.	c

The	c
advertisment	i
said	c
that	c
the	c
show	c
would	c
start	c
at	c
19:30	c
but	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
.	c

The	c
advertisment	i
said	c
that	c
they	c
would	c
be	c
available	c
but	c
they	c
were	c
not	c
.	c

The	c
last	c
problem	c
was	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
written	c
in	c
the	c
advertisment	i
that	c
I	c
could	c
visit	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
but	c
unfortunatelly	i
it	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

There	c
are	c
many	c
different	c
creatures	c
on	c
Earth	c
:	c
animals	c
,	c
insects	c
,	c
plants	c
.	c

The	c
modern	c
technology	c
,	c
on	c
the	c
one	c
hand	c
,	c
made	i
our	c
life	c
easier	c
.	c

We	i
use	i
different	i
electric	i
kettle	i
.	c

We	c
communicate	c
with	c
other	c
people	c
by	c
telephone	c
,	i
mail	i
,	c
we	c
read	c
newspapers	c
,	c
we	c
watch	c
television	c
,	c
get	i
different	c
information	c
from	c
internet	i
.	c

For	c
example	c
:	i
cancer	c
occured	i
in	c
Africa	c
after	c
American	c
nuclear	c
tests	c

All	c
in	c
all	c
,	c
technology	c
made	i
our	c
life	c
better	c
by	c
destroying	c
the	c
environment	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
reply	c
your	i
letter	c
in	c
which	c
you	c
let	c
me	c
know	c
I	c
had	i
won	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
currently	c
attending	c
University	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
exams	c
all	c
term	c
long	c
.	c

For	i
accommodation	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
a	c
tent	c
,	c
as	c
I	c
love	c
nature	c
and	c
I	c
like	c
going	c
camping	c
a	c
lot	c
.	c

But	c
,	c
on	i
the	i
other	i
side	i
,	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
good	c
basketball	c
player	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
practise	i
it	i
three	c
or	c
four	c
times	c
a	c
week	c
as	c
I	c
play	c
in	c
the	c
University	c
team	c
.	c

There	c
are	c
some	c
things	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
first	c
of	c
all	c
,	i
the	i
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
should	c
take	c
with	c
me	c

Dear	c
Kim	c

Hi	c

How	c

you	c
?	c

I	c
have	c
a	c
terrible	c
cold	c
but	c
I	c
feel	c
OK	c
anyway	c
.	c

A	c
friend	c
of	c
mine	c
was	c
organising	c
a	i
pop	c
concert	c
,	c
and	c
as	c
he	c
knew	c
me	c
well	c
,	c
he	c
asked	c
me	c
if	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
design	c
the	c
clothes	c
the	c
pop	c
singers	c
would	c
wear	c
in	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

Of	c
course	c
,	c
I	c
accepted	c
immediately	c
very	i
pleased	c
.	c

And	c
,	c
as	c
if	c
it	i
was	c
n't	c
enough	c
,	c
doing	i
what	c
I	c
love	c

And	c
tell	c
me	c
,	c
are	c
you	c
planning	c
coming	i
back	c
to	c
visit	c
me	c
?	c

Write	c

soon	c
!	c
love	c

I	c
'm	c
writeng	i
with	c
reference	c
to	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

I	i
've	i
being	i
very	i
thrilled	c
,	c
when	c
I	i
've	i
known	i
,	i
that	c
I	c
won	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
.	c

I	c
always	c
dreamed	c
about	c
going	c
to	c
the	i
California	c
and	c
now	c
my	c
dreams	c
are	c
coming	c
truth	i
.	c

If	c
it	c
's	c
possible	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	i
to	i
travel	i
only	i
July	i
,	c
because	c
my	c
school	c
wo	c
n't	c
be	c
finished	c
earlier	c
.	c

I	c
ca	c
n't	c
imagine	c
real	c
holidays	c
without	c
a	c
tent	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
things	c
for	c
me	c
,	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
chance	c
to	c
forget	c
about	c
all	c
my	c
present	c
,	c
luxurious	c
life	c
and	c
try	c
doing	c
something	c
different	c
.	c

I	c
've	c
always	c
wanted	c
to	c
learn	c
singing	i
professionaly	i
,	c
but	c
I	c
've	c
never	c
had	c
an	c
occasion	i
.	c

Normally	c
,	c
I	c
live	c
in	i
the	c
seaside	c
and	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
live	c
without	c
this	c
sport	c
.	c

Last	c
year	c
I	c
was	c
even	c
champion	c
of	c
my	c
school	c
in	c
crawl	c
for	c
one	c
hundred	c
meters	c
.	c

Should	c
I	c
take	c
with	c
me	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
money	c
?	c

You	c
know	c
,	c
I	c
'm	c
only	c
a	c
student	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

I	c
'm	c
sorry	c
I	c
have	c
n't	c
rewritten	i
sooner	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
busy	c
.	c

I	c
must	c
tell	c
you	c
that	c
helping	c
at	c
pop	c
concerts	c
is	c
very	c
exciting	c
,	c
but	c
very	c
tiring	c
too	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
rest	c
.	c

You	c
asked	c
me	c
about	c
my	c
experiences	c
.	c

Well	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
the	c
best	c
time	c
of	c
my	c
life	c
!	c

When	c
she	c
tried	c
to	c
answear	i
me	c
,	c
one	c
small	c
child	c
made	i
her	c
a	i
picture	c
with	c
flesh	i
.	c

I	c
've	c
met	c
here	i
so	i
many	i
new	i
people	i
!	c

The	c
hardest	c
was	c
,	c
when	c
I	c
brought	c
a	c
pepperoni	c
pizza	c
for	c
kubulska	c
,	c
but	c
she	c
does	c
n't	c
eat	c
meat	c
!	c

But	c
,	c
for	i
luck	i
,	c
it	i
was	i
n't	i
achieved	i
with	i
succes	i
of	i
our	i
concert	i
.	c

You	c
have	c
to	c
admit	c
,	c
that	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
magnificent	c
.	c

O.K.	c
That	c
's	c
all	c
for	c
today	c
.	c

Give	c
my	c
best	c
to	c
your	c
parents	c

Hugs	c
and	c
kisses	c

I	c
see	c
that	c
you	c
has	i
already	c
organised	c
the	c
programme	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
the	c
students	c
in	c
my	c
class	c
have	c
seen	c
an	c
advertisement	c
for	c
"	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
"	c
and	c
they	c
would	c
all	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

The	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
show	c
is	c
a	c
special	c
event	c
that	c
is	c
realized	i
once	c
a	c
year	c
,	i
there	i
are	c
the	c
latest	c
Fashions	c
,	c

wear	c
,	c
make	i
up	i

hair	i
styles	i
,	i
all	c
things	c
that	c
a	i
young	c
people	c
wants	i
to	c
see	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
suggesting	c
how	c
programme	i
could	c
be	c
changed	c
.	c

That	c
was	c
my	c
situation	c
at	c
the	c
moment	i
.	c

"	c
The	c
Honorable	c
men	c
's	c
group	c
"	c
,	i
Dick	c
,	c
Nick	c
and	c
I	c
,	i
has	i
formed	c
this	c
group	c
.	c

And	c
she	c
broke	c
up	c
the	c
relationship	c
with	c
Dick	c
and	c
we	c
had	i
a	i
conclusion	c
that	c
stealing	c
panties	c
from	c
young	c
girls	c
was	c
very	c
difficult	c
.	c

So	c
we	c
tried	c
to	c
stole	i
adult	i
's	i
panties	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
my	c
grand	i
mother	i
's	i
house	c
and	c
try	c
to	c
steal	c
some	c
panties	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
quickly	c
,	i
entered	c
in	i
my	c
grandmother	c
's	c
room	c
and	c
started	c
to	c
get	c
some	c
panties	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
nervous	c
that	i
I	c
forgot	c
my	c
shoes	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
and	c
for	c
this	c
competition	c
.	c

First	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
answer	c
your	c
questions	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
only	c
available	c
on	i
July	c
,	i
is	i
it	i
fine	i
for	c
you	c
?	c

Because	i
,	i
the	c
only	c
time	c
I	c
can	c
take	c
holiday	i
is	c
July	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
log	c
cabins	c
,	i
I	c
think	c
they	c
are	c
more	c
comfortable	c
and	c
safer	c
than	c
tents	c
.	c

About	i
the	c
two	c
activities	c
I	i
choose	c
swimming	c
and	c
painting	c
.	c

I	c
took	c
swimming	c
courses	i
for	c
four	c
years	c
.	c

Do	c
you	c
reccomend	i
me	c
to	c
take	c
only	c
summer	c
clothes	c
or	c
some	c
winter	c
clothes	c
as	c
well	c
?	c

Is	c
it	c
very	i
expensive	c
area	c
?	c

I	c
mean	c
would	c
£	c
700	c
be	c
enough	c
for	c
me	c
for	c
one	c
week	c
?	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
your	c
interest	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

And	c
at	c
the	c
time	c
of	c
concert	i
we	c
wore	c
a	i
big	c
funny	c
costume	i
,	c
and	c
danced	c
with	c
people	c
.	c

Oh	c
,	c
my	c
God	c
they	i
're	c
so	i
nice	c
,	c
talkative	c
,	c
funny	c
,	c
people	c
.	c

But	c
you	c
know	c
they	c
're	c
a	c
bit	c
spoilt	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
to	c
finish	c
or	c
I	c
'll	c
miss	c
the	c
last	c
post	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr.	c
Robertson	c
,	c

We	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
this	c
show	c
.	c

There	c
will	c
be	c
the	c
latest	c
fashions	c
and	c
leisure	c
and	c
sports	c
wear	c
.	i

We	c
think	c
that	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
for	c
us	c
to	c
see	c
this	c
show	c
because	c
we	c
are	c
all	c
interested	c
in	c
fashion	c
.	c

You	c
can	c
give	c
the	c
possibility	i
to	c
the	c
students	c
too	i
choose	c
between	c
go	i
shopping	c
or	c
go	i
to	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
even	c
free	c
for	c
students	c
!	c
!	c

I	c
hope	c
that	c
this	c
change	c
will	c
not	c
cause	c
to	i
you	c
too	c
many	c
problems	c
.	c

I	c
agree	c
with	c
this	c
statement	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
famous	c
people	c
deserve	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
private	c
life	c
like	c
all	c
the	c
normal	c
people	c
,	c
without	c
journalists	c
following	c
them	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
.	c

A	c
famous	c
person	c
should	c
have	c
the	c
chance	c
to	c
go	c
on	c
his	c
own	c
for	c
a	c
walk	c
without	c
having	c
the	c
annoying	c
impression	c
of	c
being	c
followed	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
the	c
journalists	c
should	c
have	c
more	c
respect	c
for	c
the	c
private	c
life	i
of	c
the	i
famous	c
people	c
.	c

In	c
this	c
occasion	i
we	c
can	c
say	c
that	c
the	c
journalists	c
have	c
,	c
of	c
course	c
indirectly	c
,	c
caused	c
her	c
death	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
the	i
famous	c
people	c
have	c
to	c
understand	c
that	c
the	i
people	c
are	c
interested	c
in	c
their	c
lives	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
view	c
Prince	c
Charles	c
is	c
a	c
good	c
example	c
of	c
how	c
famous	c
people	c
have	c
to	c
deal	c
with	c
the	c
media	c
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
there	c
must	c
be	c
more	c
compehension	i
and	c
respect	c
between	c
famous	c
people	c
and	c
the	c
media	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
really	c
pleased	c
to	c
hear	c
from	c
you	c
I	i
won	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
the	c
competition	c
.	c

How	i
I	c
am	c
going	c
to	c
answer	c
the	c
questions	c
you	c
asked	c
me	c
in	c
the	c
letter	c
.	c

So	c
July	c
is	c
the	c
only	c
month	c
I	c
can	c
take	c
part	c
in	c
your	c
activities	c
.	c

Second	c
,	c
regarding	c
accomodation	i
,	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
sensitive	c
to	c
noise	c
especially	c
at	c
night	c
and	c
tend	c
to	c
catch	c
a	c
cold	c
even	c
in	c
summer	c
.	c

So	c
this	c
time	c
I	c
am	c
really	c
keen	c
on	c
learning	c
that	c
.	c

I	c
expect	c
you	c
have	c
lovely	c
nature	i
in	c
California	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
draw	c
on	c
my	c
canvas	c
.	c

What	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
do	c
I	c
need	c
and	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
do	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
.	i

I	c
am	c
really	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
going	c
there	c
and	c
your	i
reply	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

Sandra	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
any	i
shops	c
are	c
too	c
busy	c
to	c
enjoy	c
shopping	c
in	c
at	c
weekends	c
.	c

Sometimes	c
customers	c
'	c
trolleys	c
run	c
into	c
each	c
other	c
and	c
they	c
have	c
to	c
wait	c
ages	c
to	c
go	c
through	c
check-ins	c
.	c

What	c
's	c
worse	c
,	c
there	c
is	c
usually	c
traffic	i
jam	c
around	c
or	c
along	c
roads	c
to	c
a	c
big	c
supermarket	c
and	c
a	c
shopping	c
mall	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
people	c
ca	c
n't	c
have	c
a	c
good	c
time	c
even	c
at	i
weekdays	c
while	c
shopping	c
.	c

Otherwise	c
they	c
can	c
have	c
lots	c
of	c
problem	i
and	c
difficult	i
to	c
live	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
express	c
my	c
dissapointment	i
about	i
the	c
play	c
"	c
over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
"	c
which	i
is	c
performing	i
at	c
Circle	i
Theatre	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
the	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
show	c
announced	c
Mr.	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
as	c
the	c
principal	c
actor	c
.	c

Surprisingly	c
,	c
he	c
never	c
appeared	c
on	c
the	c
stage	c
,	i
during	c
the	c
play	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
when	c
I	c
asked	c
about	c
the	c
discounts	c
,	c
an	c
agressive	i
employee	c
refused	c
to	c
answer	c
me	c
.	c

He	c
stayed	c
looking	c
at	c
me	c
and	c
laughing	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
incredible	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

I	c
knew	c
that	c
but	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
trust	c
her	c
so	c
I	c
told	c
everything	i
about	c
Lynne	c
Harter	c
,	c
our	c
new	c
collegue	i
at	c
school	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
admit	c
that	c
I	c
told	c
her	c
my	c
own	c
opinion	c
.	c

Well	c
,	c
it	i
was	c
the	c
beginning	c
of	c
my	c
tragedy	c
.	c

Two	c
days	c
after	i
,	c
when	c
Pat	c
came	c
back	c
to	c
my	c
school	c
and	i
she	c
met	c
Mr	c
Harter	c
,	c
our	c
head	c
teacher	c
,	c
she	c
told	c
everything	i
about	c
Ann1	c
.	c

But	c
,	c
well	c
,	c
unhappiness	i
started	c
with	c
Pat	c
and	c
my	c
reveilled	i
secrets	c

!	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
only	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
tests	i
at	c
school	c
and	c
they	c
are	c
Very	i
important	c
to	c
me	c
and	c
I	c
hope	c
you	c
Will	i
understand	c
my	c
problem	c

I	c
also	c
Want	i

I	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
when	c
you	c
buy	c
something	c
,	c
you	c
might	c
lose	c
it	c
and	c
never	c
again	i
see	i
it	i
,	c
or	c
you	c
could	c
be	c
robbed	c
,	c
or	c
even	i
if	c
the	c
product	c
has	c
something	c
wrong	c
with	c
it	c
,	c
then	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
swap	c
it	c
and	c
that	c
takes	c
time	c
.	c

That	c
makes	c
those	c
people	c
frustrated	c
and	c
they	c
do	c
n't	c
enjoy	c
theirselves	i
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs.	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
pleased	c
to	c
learn	c
that	c
I	c
had	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
!	c

To	c
answer	c
your	c
questions	c
,	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
only	c
on	i
July	c
,	c
as	c
it	c
is	c
the	c
only	c
moment	i
when	c
I	c
can	c
take	c
my	c
holidays	c
.	c

I	c
'd	c
prefer	c
to	c
sleep	c
in	c
tents	c
rather	c
than	c
log	c
cabins	c
:	c
sleeping	c
in	c
tents	c
seems	c
to	c
correspond	c
to	c
a	c
"	c
spirit	c
of	c
adventure	c
"	c
to	c
me	c
,	c
what	i
I	c
particularly	c
like	c
;	c
in	i
the	i
opposite	i
,	c
log	c
cabins	c
are	c
more	c
"	c
traditional	c
"	c
and	c
a	c
less	c
interesting	c
experience	c
.	c

As	i
I	c
was	c
a	c
child	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
basketball	c
,	c
even	i
one	i
of	i
the	i
best	i
of	i
my	i
class	i
.	c

These	c
reasons	i
are	c
why	c
I	c
'd	c
also	c
like	c
sailing	i
.	c

Sailing	c
means	c
an	c
ever	c
renewed	c
adventure	c
as	c
you	c
cannot	c
control	c
the	c
atmospherical	i
conditions	c
.	c

Please	c
,	c
do	c
n't	c
forget	c
to	c
tell	c
me	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
need	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c

Finally	c
,	c
you	c
find	c
the	c
right	c
one	c
but	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
enough	c
money	c
.	c

But	c
now	c
,	c
you	c
are	c
very	c
tired	c
and	c
need	c
a	c
good	c
rest	c
!	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
in	c
connection	c
with	c
the	c
information	c
requested	c
,	c
concerning	c
the	c
two-week	c
trip	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
in	c
the	c
competition	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
asked	c
the	i
time	i
my	c
trip	c
would	c
be	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
come	c
to	c
a	i
conclusion	c
that	c
the	c
only	c
time	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
go	c
is	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
during	c
this	i
very	i
month	c
I	c
have	c
my	c
winter	c
break	c
both	c
from	c
work	c
and	c
school	c
and	c
that	c
is	c
when	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
free	c
to	c
go	c
.	c

Now	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
request	c
some	c
information	c
about	c
clothes	c
and	c
money	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
receiving	c
your	c
reply	c
and	c
hope	c
the	c
information	c
above	c
will	c
helpful	i
towards	c
the	c
preparation	c
for	c
the	c
weeks	c
in	c
subject	i

Finally	c
,	c
you	i
always	i
talk	i
yourself	i
into	i
some	i
piece	i
of	i
clothing	i
but	i
that	i
ended	i
up	i
being	i
a	i
tiring	i
day	i
of	c
going	c
in	c
and	c
out	c
of	c
fitting	c

out	c

Dear	c
Jane	c
Clark	c
,	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
to	c
give	c
my	c
opinion	c
of	c
that	c
great	c
festival	c
you	c
organiced	i
the	i
last	c
21	c
and	c
22	c
of	c
November	c
.	c

Yours	c
Sincerely	c
,	c

They	c
only	c
want	c
to	c
know	c
where	c
I	c
am	c
and	c
when	c
I	c
go	c
out	c
at	i
what	c
time	c
I	c
came	c
home	c
.	c

At	c
school	c
is	i
complete	i
different	c
because	c
the	c
teachers	c
do	c
n't	c
foregive	i
you	c
nothing	i
.	c

You	c
have	c
to	c
be	c
quiet	c
an	i
attention	i
in	c
class	c
if	c
you	c
would	i
n't	i
to	i
be	c
punished	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
happy	c
because	c
my	c
parents	c
allow	c
me	c
to	c
do	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
things	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
n't	c
like	c
to	c
change	c
anything	c
because	c
we	c
all	c
need	c
some	c
dicipline	i
to	c
make	i
the	c
right	c
things	c
.	c

Love	c
,	c

What	c
a	c
terrible	c
evening	c
!	c

So	c
I	c
payed	i
the	i
ticket	c

After	c
the	c
show	c
I	c
was	c
hungry	c
so	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
restaurant	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
!	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
so	c
he	c
told	c
his	c
mother	c
how	c
his	c
brother	c
Jim	c
lost	c
her	c
suit	c
suitcase	c
on	c
the	c
train	c
.	c

Jim	c
's	c
mum	c
did	c
n't	c
want	c
him	c
to	c
take	c
her	c
suitcase	c
,	c
but	c
he	c
did	c
it	i
.	c

Then	c
he	c
waited	c
for	c
the	c
next	c
train	c
to	c
London	c
and	c
he	c
caught	c
it	c
.	c

Even	c
though	i
,	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
understand	c
the	i
actor	i
of	c
this	c
play	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
does	i
n't	i
appeared	i
in	c
the	c
play	c
and	c
there	c
was	c
another	c
actor	c
instead	c
of	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
.	c

After	c
all	c
this	c
I	i
wanted	c
to	c
make	c
my	c
evening	c
pleasant	c
however	i
for	i
my	c
surprise	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
some	i
problems	i

Dear	c
Miss	c
Clark	c
,	c

I	c
went	c
to	c
your	c
annual	c
international	c
arts	c
festival	c
.	c

I	c
really	c
enjoyed	c
it	c
,	c
although	c
I	c
feel	c
it	c
could	c
have	c
been	c
better	c
.	c

But	c
firstly	c
I	i
want	c
to	c
congratulate	c
you	c
for	i
organizing	c
such	c
a	c
huge	c
festival	c
,	c
people	c
need	c
this	c
kind	c
of	c
events	i
.	c

Secondly	c
I	i
would	c
like	c
to	c
make	c
some	c
remarks	c
about	c
your	c
festival	c
so	c
that	c
you	c
can	c
improve	c
it	c
.	c

However	c
the	c
concerts	c
were	c
great	c
,	c
but	c
unfortunately	c
,	c
some	c
concert	c
halls	c
were	c
too	c
small	c
and	c
it	c
was	c
as	c
hot	c
as	c
a	i
micro-wave	i
inside	c
.	c

One	c
of	c
the	c
most	c
positive	c
aspect	i
of	c
your	c
festival	c
is	c
the	c
price	c
of	c
your	c
weekend	c
ticket	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
make	c
one	c
big	i
suggestion	c
:	c
you	c
should	c
find	c
a	c
place	c
for	c
a	c
camping	i
so	c
that	c
people	c
who	c
come	c
from	i
a	c
long	c
way	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
to	c
spend	c
money	c
on	c
accomodation	i
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

They	c
need	c
money	c
to	c
pay	c
their	i
studies	c
or	c
for	c
going	c
out	c
,	c
but	c
how	c
to	c
find	c
a	c
job	c
which	c
is	c
good	c
and	c
not	c
under-paid	i
?	c

Furthermore	c
departement	i
stores	c
are	c
always	c
looking	c
for	c
students	c
who	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
work	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
it	i
's	c
not	c
possible	c
unless	c
you	c
can	c
rest	c
in	c
the	c
morning	c
.	c

It	c
will	c
be	c
a	c
good	c
opportunity	c
for	i
visiting	i
London	c
and	c
its	i
interesting	c
places	c
like	c
the	c
Science	c
Museum	c
.	c

The	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
show	i
is	c
an	c
amaizing	i
show	c
because	c
there	c
are	c
parades	i
with	c
the	c
latest	c
fashions	c
,	i
we	i
could	c
know	i
some	c
famous	c
top	c
models	c
Besides	i
there	c
are	i
a	c
variety	c
of	c
clothes	c
either	i
sport	i
wear	i
as	i
elegant	i
desings	i
.	c

Not	i
only	i
we	c
could	c
see	c
the	c
latest	c
trend	c
in	c
make-up	c
but	i
hairstyles	i
performed	i
by	i
important	i
coiffeurs	i
.	c

Maybe	c
we	c
could	c
go	c
on	i
shopping	c
on	c
Wednesday	c
afternoon	c
and	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
we	c
could	c
go	c
to	c
The	i
Show	i
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	i
,	c

I	c
have	i
never	i
imagined	i
I	c
had	i
to	c
face	c
this	c
situation	c
.	c

We	c
planned	c
a	c
programme	i
.	c

Every	i
thing	i
was	c
marvellous	c
,	i
I	c
got	c
on	c
well	c
with	c
all	c
the	c
partners	i
.	c

The	c
landscapes	i
were	i
the	c
most	c
beautiful	c
that	c
I	c
had	c
ever	c
seen	c
before	i
.	c

The	c
weather	c
was	c
delightful	c
,	c
except	c
this	i
afternoon	c
when	c
started	i
to	c
rain	c
and	c
we	c
decide	i
to	c
stay	c
during	i
the	c
night	c
inside	c
a	c
hole	c
in	c
the	c
wall	i
of	c
the	c
mountain	c
.	c

I	c
realised	c
that	c
my	c
bag	c
was	c
outside	c
and	c
I	c
went	c
out	c
to	c
look	c
for	c
it	c
,	c
when	c
a	c
rain	i
of	c
stones	c
covered	c
the	c
entrace	i
of	c
the	c
hole	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
terrified	c
,	c
I	c
knew	c
that	c
the	c
only	c
solution	c
was	c
to	c
ask	c
for	c
helping	i
.	c

I	c
walked	c
alone	c
a	c
long	c
distence	i
until	c
I	c
found	c
a	c
telephone	c
,	i
I	c
called	c
the	c
police	c
and	c
they	i
ask	i
for	i
a	i
rescue	i
.	c

Thanks	i
to	i
God	i
everything	i
finished	c
in	c
a	c
good	c
way	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

Although	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
was	c
there	c
,	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
to	c
see	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
.	c

Another	c
problem	c
I	c
had	c
was	c
the	i
time	c
.	i

I	i
was	c
going	c
to	c
begin	c
at	c
19.30	c
but	c
It	c
began	c
at	c
20.15	c
and	c
the	c
problem	c
was	c
that	c
It	c
was	c
raining	c
.	c

I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
explain	c
too	c
that	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
see	c
that	i
you	c
made	i
discounts	i
to	c
no	i
one	i
.	c

I	c
was	c
queuing	c
for	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
and	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
see	c
it	c
.	i

And	c
I	c
went	c
with	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
friends	c
and	c
we	c
did	c
n't	c
have	i
any	c
discount	c
.	c

Another	c
question	i
is	c
that	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
you	c
advised	i
we	c
could	c
visit	c
your	c
restaurant	c
but	c
as	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
we	c
could	c
n't	c
do	i
it	i
.	c

And	c
we	c
were	c
very	c
hungry	c
after	c
being	c
three	c
hours	c
in	c
the	c
theatre	c
.	c

And	c
,	c
because	c
of	c
these	c
faults	i
,	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
have	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

I	c
met	c
Pat	c
when	c
we	c
were	c
children	c
.	c

We	c
went	c
at	i
the	c
same	c
school	c
and	c
at	i
the	c
same	c
class	c
.	c

I	c
told	c
her	c
that	c
and	c
she	c
assured	c
me	c
that	c
she	c
would	c
n't	c
say	c
it	i
to	c
him	c
.	c

When	c
we	c
finished	c
our	i
primary	c
school	c
we	c
went	c
at	i
the	c
same	c
secundary	i
school	c
too	c
,	c
but	c
we	c
were	c
in	c
different	c
classes	c
.	c

We	c
went	c
out	c
every	c
weekends	i
.	c

When	c
I	c
finished	c
I	c
return	i
to	c
my	c
city	c
to	c
find	c
a	c
job	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
,	c

However	c
,	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
did	c
not	c
appear	c
in	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
another	c
actor	c
.	c

This	c
was	c
really	c
disappointing	c
.	c

It	c
started	c
at	c
20.15	c
,	c
not	c
at	c
19.30	c
as	c
it	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
be	i
.	c

And	c
,	c
although	c
you	c
have	i
promised	c
in	i
your	c
advertisement	c
,	c
there	c
were	c
no	c
discounts	c
available	c
.	c

To	c
make	c
things	c
worst	i
,	c
the	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

The	c
manager	c
said	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
they	c
had	c
not	c
been	c
informed	c
that	c
there	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
show	c
in	i
that	c
date	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hear	i
from	c
you	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
we	c
will	c
not	c
use	i
formal	c
clothes	c
anymore	c
.	c

People	c
will	c
prefer	c
to	c
use	i
confortable	i
clothes	c
,	c
even	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
office	c
.	c

The	c
clothes	c
will	c
be	c
more	c
colourful	c
and	c
consequently	c
more	c
funny	i
.	c

This	c
way	c
,	c
people	c
tend	c
to	c
be	c
happier	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
the	c
clothes	c
will	c
not	c
be	c
as	i
teenagers	i
use	i
to	i
wear	i
nowadays	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
"	c
raves	c
"	c
.	c

It	i
will	c
be	c
more	c
beautiful	c
and	c
clean	c
.	c

This	c
is	c
a	c
very	c
embarrassed	i
situation	c
.	c

This	c
story	c
started	c
when	c
I	c
arrived	c
to	i
this	c
town	c
with	c
family	i
.	c

We	c
come	i
here	c
to	c
build	c
our	c
own	c
house	c
because	c
my	c
father	c
had	c
been	c
fired	c
and	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
sell	c
our	c
house	c
in	c
Buenos	c
Aires	c
.	c

My	c
mother	c
suggested	c
to	i
come	i
here	c
because	c
one	c
of	c
her	c
brothers	c
was	c
established	c
here	c
and	c
he	c
could	c
help	c
us	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
n't	c
known	i
all	c
of	c
us	i
(	c
my	c
uncle	c
,	c
my	c
aunt	c
and	c
my	c
beautiful	c
cousin	c
)	c
up	i
to	i
that	c
day	c
.	c

My	c
uncle	c
,	c
called	c
Paul	c
,	c
offered	i
us	c
to	c
stay	c
with	c
his	c
family	c
up	i
to	i
we	c
could	i
build	i
our	c
house	c
.	c

Cassually	i
my	c
cousin	c
had	i
the	c
same	c
age	c
as	c
me	c
,	c
sixteen	c
,	c
that	c
's	c
the	c
reason	c
for	i
we	c
started	c
a	i
friendly	c
relationship	c
.	c

This	c
"	c
friendly	c
"	c
relationship	c
was	c
starting	c
to	c
make	i
hot	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
wonderful	c
.	c

In	c
fact	c
,	c
I	c
did	i
.	c

We	c
made	c
love	c
...	c

We	c
are	c
really	c
interested	c
in	c
latest	i
fashions	c
and	c
new	c
hairstyles	c
,	c
but	i
also	c
we	c
are	c
keen	c
on	c
knowing	c
about	c
leisure	c
and	c
sports	c
clothes	c
and	c
especially	i
girls	i
enjoy	c
seeing	c
the	c
different	c
kinds	c
of	c
making	i
up	i
.	c

This	c
event	c
takes	c
place	c
in	c
Central	i
Exhibition	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
your	c
answer	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

I	c
had	c
to	c
hit	c
a	c
human	c
being	c
and	c
unfortunately	c
,	c
although	c
I	c
respect	c
every	c
form	c
of	c
life	c
humans	i
,	c
animals	c
and	c
plants	c
,	c
I	c
managed	c
to	c
hit	c
a	c
burglar	c
.	c

Three	c
months	c
ago	c
,	c
I	c
cannot	c
forget	c
this	c
day	c
,	c
my	c
parents	c
visited	c
my	c
aunt	c
at	i
hospital	c
as	c
she	c
was	c
ill	c
.	c

Immediately	c
I	c
opened	c
my	c
door	c
and	c
...	c

I	c
could	c
not	c
believe	c
my	c
eyes	c
!	c

A	c
short	c
man	c
stood	i
in	c
front	c
of	c
me	c
!	c

Without	c
any	c
warning	c
he	i
pushed	c
my	c
arms	c
.	c

I	c
shouted	c
as	c
I	i
pained	i
.	c

I	c
realised	c
that	c
he	c
was	c
very	c
strong	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
was	c
faster	c
and	c
more	c
intelligent	c
than	c
him	c
.	c

I	c
ran	c
quickly	c
and	c
I	c
managed	c
to	c
escape	c
from	c
him	c
,	c
I	c
found	c
one	i
hidden	c
wooden	c
spoon	c
and	c
while	c
he	c
was	c
passing	c
in	c
front	c
of	c
me	c
I	c
hit	c
him	c
.	c

To	c
my	c
relief	c
I	c
managed	c
to	c
survive	c
!	c

My	c
name	c
is	c
Yakimo	c
Nashoto	c
,	i
I	c
study	c
in	c
France	c
and	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
London	c
just	c
to	c
see	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
because	c
all	c
my	c
friends	c
told	c
me	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
"	c
great	c
"	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
when	c
I	c
saw	c
it	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
really	c
disapointed	i
and	c
I	c
ask	i
you	c
some	i
money	c
back	c
.	c

The	c
reasons	c
why	c
I	c
was	c
disappointed	c
were	i
:	i

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
was	c
not	c
there	c
,	i
I	c
was	c
very	c
upset	c
because	c
he	c
is	c
my	c
favorite	i
singer	c
and	c
it	i
was	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
reasons	c
why	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
see	c
this	c
show	c
.	c

Then	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
t	i
20.15	i
pm	i
instead	c
of	c
19.30	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
buy	c
something	c
to	c
drink	c
,	c
the	i
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
on	i
a	c
bank	c
holiday	c
!	c

As	i
a	i
conclusion	i
,	c
it	c
was	c
the	c
worse	i
evening	c
I	c
have	c
ever	c
had	c
in	c
my	c
life	c
so	c
I	c
ask	i
you	c
for	c
money	i
back	c
.	c

The	i
modern	i
technology	c
has	c
changed	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
a	c
lot	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
Internet	i
makes	c
my	c
life	c
easier	c
.	c

Some	c
of	c
my	c
friends	c
live	c
in	i
overseas	c
,	i
we	i
keep	c
in	c
touch	c
by	i
e-mails	c
,	i
it	i
is	c
a	c
very	c
good	c
way	c
for	i
communicating	i
because	c
it	c
is	c
much	c
cheaper	c
than	c
a	c
phone	c
call	c
and	c
we	c
can	c
re-read	c
mails	i
and	c
keep	c
them	c
forever	c
.	c

Then	i
,	c
nine	c
persons	i
out	c
of	c
ten	c
have	c
a	c
mobile	c
phone	c
in	c
our	c
society	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
one	c
too	c
!	c

It	c
is	c
very	c
useful	c
for	c
several	c
reasons	c
:	c

when	c
I	c
go	c
out	c
,	c
sometimes	c
my	c
parents	c
are	c
worried	c
so	c
they	c
phone	c
to	i
me	c
if	i
everything	c
is	c
going	i
alright	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
there	c
is	c
a	c
TV	c
in	c
my	c
parent	i
's	i
car	c
.	c

We	c
can	c
watch	c
TV	c
,	i
there	i
is	c
also	c
a	c
map	c
so	c
when	c
we	c
get	c
lost	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
very	c
east	i
to	c
find	i
out	i
the	i
place	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
writting	i
in	c
order	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
"	c
.	c

In	i
order	i
to	i
the	c
times	c
,	i
the	c
show	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
start	c
at	c
19.30	c
and	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
20.15	c
,	i
nobody	i
likes	c
to	c
wait	c
45	c
minutes	c
just	c
watching	c
empty	c
scenary	i
.	c

Another	c
thing	c
,	c
the	c
tickets	c
.	c

The	c
advertisement	c
said	c
that	c
there	c
were	c
discounts	c
available	c
,	i
that	i
was	c
false	c
,	c
there	c
were	i
not	c
any	c
kind	c
of	c
discounts	i
.	c

They	c
had	c
closed	c
it	c
because	c
they	c
had	c
found	c
the	c
food	c
in	c
bad	i
conditions	i
.	c

Just	c
to	c
finish	c
,	c
the	c
advertisement	c
said	c
that	c
the	c
show	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
,	c
let	c
me	c
tell	c
that	i
it	c
was	i
n't	i
not	c
.	c

I	c
paid	c
a	i
full	i
ticket	c
without	c
discounts	i
to	c
wait	c
45	c
minutes	c
,	c
to	c
see	c
a	c
musical	c
show	c
with	c
a	c
bad	c
actor	c
and	c
after	c
all	c
could	i
not	c
have	c
a	c
sandwich	c
because	c
the	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
.	c

Technology	c
.	c

Technology	c
is	c
improving	c
every	c
day	c
,	c
soon	c
everything	c
will	c
be	c
done	c
by	c
a	c
machine	c
.	c

More	c
and	c
more	c
people	c
are	c
connecting	c
through	i
the	c
net	c
.	c

Soon	c
we	c
wo	c
n't	c
need	c
to	c
get	i
out	i
from	i
our	c
homes	c
.	c

Our	c
lifes	i
are	c
very	c
different	c
from	c
our	c
grandparent	i
's	i
lifes	i
and	c
that	c
's	c
because	c
the	i
technology	c
.	c

This	c
show	c
was	c
presented	c
by	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
so	c
disappointed	c
.	c

Thirdly	c
,	c
there	c
was	i
no	c
discounts	c
available	c
but	c
it	i
was	i
printed	i
on	i
the	i
poster	i
.	c

If	c
there	c
was	i
no	c
discounts	c
,	c
do	c
n't	c
write	i
it	i
on	c
the	c
poster	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
have	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

It	c
just	c
takes	c
you	c
a	c
few	c
minutes	c
.	c

There	c
are	c
also	c
much	i
more	c
advantages	c
,	i
you	i
can	c
buy	c
somethings	i
in	c
a	c
supermarket	c
by	i
only	i
a	i
mail	i
order	i
,	i
you	i
do	c
n't	c
need	c
to	c
go	i
out	i
of	i
your	c
home	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
we	c
know	c
much	c
more	c
about	c
our	c
universe	c
.	c

Some	c
modern	c
technology	c
is	c
also	c
put	i
into	i
the	i
transport	i
system	i
.	c

The	i
modern	i
technology	c
has	c
changed	c
our	c
daily	c
life	c
.	c

But	c
that	c
evening	c
became	c
a	c
real	c
nightmare	c
!	c

Discounts	c
available	c
?	c
?	c

Then	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
late	c
,	i
we	c
had	c
been	c
waiting	c
for	c
a	c
long	c
long	c
time	c
before	c
it	c
started	c
.	c

Danny	c
Brook	c
was	c
n't	c
on	c
the	c
stage	c
!	c

I	c
saw	c
a	c
young	c
actor	c
who	c
I	c
've	c
never	c
seen	c
and	i
who	c
seemed	i
not	i
to	c
know	c
by	i
heart	i
his	i
role	i
!	c

After	c
that	c
"	c
show	c
"	c
we	c
were	c
starving	c
and	c
we	c
had	c
planned	c
to	c
eat	c
in	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurand	i
but	c
what	c
a	c
surprise	c
!	c

I	c
would	c
weep	c
if	c
I	c
was	c
n't	c
so	c
angry	c
.	c

To	c
summarize	c
I	i
want	c
that	i
you	c
hang	i
me	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
and	c
very	c
quickly	c
.	c

How	c
has	c
modern	c
technology	c
changed	c
your	c
daily	c
life	c
?	c

Let	c
's	c
take	c
the	c
mobil	i
phone	c
.	c

Our	c
parents	c
used	c
the	c
phone	c
to	c
make	c
an	i
important	c
appointment	i
.	c

Nowadays	c
everybody	c
has	c
got	c
a	c
phone	c
which	c
is	c
"	c
mobil	i
"	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
the	c
same	c
with	c
Internet	i
and	c
that	c
's	c
a	c
very	c
new	c
thing	c
.	c

I	c
can	c
chat	c
with	c
my	c
sister	c
or	c
friends	c
without	c
speaking	c
when	c
I	c
'm	c
working	c
because	c
it	c
take	i
up	i
just	c
some	i
minutes	c
.	c

With	c
Internet	i
and	c
according	i
to	i
me	i
the	i
world	c
is	c
become	i
smaller	c
and	c
bigger	c
at	c
the	c
same	c
time	c
.	c

Yes	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
has	c
been	i
changed	i
and	c
it	c
's	c
a	c
good	c
thing	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
in	i
your	c
show	c
advertisement	c
sais	i
that	c
Danny	c
Brooks	c
starts	i
in	c
the	c
play	c
.	c

The	c
show	c
has	i
begun	i
later	i
,	c
much	c
more	i
later	i
than	c
your	c
advertisement	c
writes	i
,	c
at	c
about	c
20:15	c
.	c

This	c
made	c
me	c
get	i
bored	c
.	c

You	c
also	c
refer	i
to	i
your	c
advertisement	c
that	c
there	c
are	c
some	c
discounts	c
available	c
but	c
there	c
were	c
n't	c
any	c
.	c

At	c
the	c
end	c
you	c
have	i
written	i
that	c
there	i
is	i
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
after	i
the	c
show	c
but	c
there	i
was	c
n't	c
.	c

Modern	c
technology	c
changed	i
not	c
only	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
but	c
also	c
the	c
life	i
of	c
many	c
people	c
.	c

Now	c
let	c
's	c
talk	c
about	c
me	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
I	i
do	c
n't	c
have	c
to	c
worry	c
n	i
the	c
morning	c
if	i
I	i
miss	i
the	c
bus	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
my	c
alarm	c
clock	c
to	c
wake	c
me	c
in	c
time	c
.	c

So	i
I	c
turn	c
on	c
the	c
aircondition	i
with	c
timer	i
so	c
when	c
I	c
get	i
sleep	i
to	i
turn	i
off	c
by	c
itself	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
wake	c
up	c
if	i
I	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
homework	c
I	c
sit	c
on	i
my	c
computer	c
and	c
play	c
different	c
games	c
to	c
spend	i
my	c
time	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
go	c
to	c
bed	c
because	i
there	c
are	c
many	c
mosquitoss	i
I	i
turn	c
on	c
a	c
special	c
machine	c
with	c
pile	i
like	i
thing	c
in	c
it	c
which	c
kills	c
them	c
.	c

I	c
belive	i
that	c
modern	c
technology	c
has	c
effected	i
possitive	i
our	c
lives	c
.	c

Dear	c
Ms	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
really	c
pleased	c
hearing	i
from	c
you	c
,	i
I	c
won	c
the	c
prize	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
can	c
go	c
camping	c
for	c
two	c
weeks	c
.	c

As	c
regards	c
your	c
questions	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
at	c
the	c
moment	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
student	c
and	c
my	c
summer	c
holiday	c
will	c
start	c
on	c
27th	c
June	c
so	c
I	c
can	c
go	c
to	c
U.S.A	i
in	c
July	c
and	c
I	c
prefer	c
staying	c
in	c
tents	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
experienced	c
camping	c
in	c
the	i
tent	c
.	c

In	c
case	i
of	c
swimming	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
really	c
good	c
at	c
it	c
but	c
I	c
just	c
started	c
playing	c
tennis	c
before	i
3	i
weeks	i
.	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
very	i
enjoying	c
playing	c
tennis	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
really	c
expecting	i
going	c
camping	c

It	c

really	i
good	c
programme	c
,	c
especially	i
visiting	c
Science	i
Museum	c

National	i
Art	c

be	c
great	i
opportunity	c
to	c
learn	c
about	c

and	c
latest	i
improvements	i
in	c
science	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
my	c
classmates	c
and	c
I	c
saw	c
the	c
advertisement	c
with	i
regarding	c
the	c
London	c
fashion	c
and	c
leisure	c
show	c
,	c
which	c
is	c
enclosed	c
,	c
and	c
want	c

this	c

to	c
visit	c
it	c
,	c
if	c
you	c
allow	c
us	c
.	c

It	c
takes	c
place	c
in	c
Central	i
Exhibition	c
Hall	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
14	c
March	c
.	c

It	c
will	c
be	c
great	i
opportunity	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
free	c
for	c
students	c
and	c
we	c
will	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
see	c
the	c

in	c
leisure	c
and	c
sports	c
wear	c
,	c
new	c

and	c
make	i
up	i

Would	c
it	c
be	c
possible	c
to	c
visit	c
Science	i
Museum	c
and	c
go	c
shopping	c
in	c
our	c
free	c

leisure	c
show	c
,	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
between	c
10.00	c
and	c
19.00	c
hours	c
.	c

We	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
relating	i
to	i
this	c
matter	c

Yours	c

In	c
order	c
to	c
fullfill	i
their	c
readers	c
'	c
requirements	c
they	c
always	i
follow	c
them	c
.	c

This	c
is	c
the	c
most	c
argueing	i
point	c
.	c

Do	c
they	c
have	c
to	c
ask	c
for	c
their	c
permission	c
or	c
not	c
.	i

May	i
be	i
they	c
have	i
to	c
pay	c
for	c
this	i
kind	i
of	c
pictures	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c

famous	c
people	c
have	c

if	c
they	c
do	c
not	c
allow	c

July	c
is	c
really	c
the	c
only	c
available	c
time	c
I	c
have	c

If	c
possible	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c

You	c
offered	c
me	c
a	c
really	c
wide	c
range	c
of	c
activities	c
to	c
choose	c
from	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
would	c
have	c
to	c

tennis	c

It	c
seems	c
like	c
a	c
good	c
oportunity	i
to	c
practice	i
it	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
a	c
little	c
concerned	c
about	c
the	c
clothes	c
that	c
I	c
should	c
take	c

How	c
much	c
money	c
do	c
you	c

take	c
with	c
me	c

I	c
look	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

In	c
my	c
humble	c
opinion	c
,	c
shopping	c
is	c
one	c
of	c
he	i
most	c
stressful	c
and	c
boring	c
activities	c
people	c
do	c
in	c
life	c
.	c

If	c
I	c
was	c
asked	c
to	c
choose	c
the	c
least	c
attractive	c
thing	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
do	c
on	c
everyday	i
basis	c
,	c
shopping	c
would	c
most	c
definitely	c
be	c
placed	c
somewhere	c
on	i
top	i
of	c
the	c
list	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr.	c
Robertson	c
,	c

It	c
was	c
dangerous	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
knew	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
climed	i
up	c
the	c
tree	c
.	c

I	c
went	c
on	c
climbing	c
until	c
I	c
saw	c
my	c
friend	c
's	c
model	c
aeroplane	c
.	c

I	c
stressed	i
my	c
arm	c
,	c
the	c
branch	c
I	c
was	c
standing	c
on	c
broke	c
and	c
I	c
fell	c
down	c
on	c
my	c
leg	c
.	c

I	c
ca	c
n't	c
remember	c
anything	c
else	c
until	c
I	c
woke	c
up	c
at	c
a	c
hospital	c
,	c
lying	c
on	c
a	c
bed	c
with	c
my	c
leg	c
in	c
plaster	c
.	c

I	c
want	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
your	c
advertisment	i
about	i
the	c
theatre	i
'	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
'	c
I	i
had	c
a	c
very	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
I	i
wanted	c
so	c
much	c
to	c
see	c
my	c
favourite	c
actor	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
as	c
he	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
be	c
in	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
but	c
he	c
was	c
n't	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
have	c
the	c
money	c
back	c
that	c
I	c
spent	c
on	c
the	c
tickets	c
I	c
bought	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

She	c
had	c
always	c
been	c
like	c
that	c
,	c
said	i
my	i
best	i
friend	i
Ann	i
to	c
me	c
when	c
I	c
told	c
her	c
that	c
I	c
had	c
told	c
Pat	c
a	c
secret	c
yesterday	i
.	c

People	c
started	c
to	c
whrite	i
things	c
on	c
the	c
board	c
and	c
pointing	i
at	c
me	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
lunchbreak	i
I	c
went	c
to	c
Pat	c
and	c
asked	c
her	c
why	c
she	c
had	c
told	c
him	c
the	c
secret	c
,	c
but	c
she	c
just	c
ignored	c
me	c
like	c
she	c
did	c
n't	c
know	c
me	c
.	c

After	c
that	c
I	c
never	c
went	c
back	c
to	c
the	c
course	c
again	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
for	i
the	c
musical	c
show	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
.	c

I	i
've	i
been	i
recently	i
seeing	i
in	i
your	c
theatre	c
during	c
my	c
week	c
's	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
I	i
must	c
say	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
very	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
!	c

Firstly	c
,	c
the	c
play	c
started	c
nearly	c
an	c
hour	c
later	c
as	i
I	c
expected	c
!	c

Then	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
read	c
that	c
there	c
would	c
have	i
been	i
discounts	c
available	c
,	c
but	c
it	i
was	c
n't	c
true	c
!	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
hoped	c
that	c
,	c
after	c
these	c
incidents	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
enjoy	c
myself	c
,	c
but	c
there	c
was	c
another	c
change	c
of	i
programme	i
:	c
starring	i
!	c

For	c
all	c
these	c
reason	i
,	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
ask	c
for	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
and	c
I	c
hope	c
to	c
hear	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
!	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

Technology	c
is	c
a	c
wide	c
field	c
which	c
increases	i
very	c
quickly	c
.	c

Nowadays	c
,	c
we	c
make	i
a	c
phone	c
call	c
with	c
an	c
astonish	i
rapidity	c
,	c
instead	i
at	i
my	c
grandparents	c
'	c
time	c
it	c
took	c
one	c
month	c
or	c
more	c
to	c
have	i
contact	i
with	c
people	c
abroad	c
,	c
because	c
the	c
only	c
means	c
of	c
communication	c
was	c
the	c
post	c
and	c
its	c
service	c
was	c
very	c
slow	c
!	c

Before	c
that	c
,	c
people	c
travelled	c
by	c
horse	c
or	c
worse	c
.	c

Fortunately	c
today	c
everyone	c
can	c
take	c
an	c
aeroplane	c
and	c
go	c
to	c
America	c
,	c
Australia	c
or	c
wherever	c
else	c
he	i
wants	i
!	c

It	c
allows	c
us	c
to	c
keep	i
connections	c
with	c
the	c
other	c
states	c
of	c
the	c
world	c
,	c
improves	c
our	c
knowledge	c
,	c
offers	c
us	c
news	c
,	c
advises	c
us	c
about	c
events	c
which	c
happened	i
or	c
will	c
happen	c
.	c

In	c
the	i
not	c
very	c
far	i
1914	i
,	c
parent	i
sent	c
their	c
sons	c
in	i
war	c
and	c
it	c
was	c
very	c
difficult	c
to	c
know	c
if	c
they	c
were	c
still	c
alive	c
or	c
dead	c
!	c

It	c
's	c
terrible	c
!	c

Despite	c
this	c
,	c
I	c
'm	c
convinced	c
all	c
this	c
progress	c
caused	i
some	c
damages	i
at	i
the	c
community	c
,	c
not	c
only	c
phisically	i
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
a	c
fan	c
of	c
him	i
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
the	c
restarant	i
were	i
I	c
would	c
like	i
to	c
have	c
dinner	c
with	c
friends	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
closed	c
against	i
what	c
was	c
announced	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

Is	i
the	c
life	i
style	i
or	c
necessities	i
from	i
people	c
what	i
make	c
technology	c
develop	c
.	c

All	c
kind	i
of	c
industrial	c
machines	c
are	c
created	c
to	c
solve	c
problems	c
,	c
improve	c
other	c
machines	c
or	c
to	c
do	i
n't	i
waste	i
so	i
many	i
time	c
.	c

But	c
these	c
ones	i
bring	c
new	c
problems	c
that	c
must	c
be	c
solved	c
by	c
others	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
mind	c
staying	c
in	c
log	c
cabins	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
prefer	c
camping	c
because	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
be	c
really	c
near	i
the	i
nature	c
.	c

Well	c
,	c
about	c
the	c
activities	c
,	c
I	c
love	c
Photography	c
,	i
I	c
made	i
a	c
course	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
take	c
beautiful	c
photos	c
of	c
the	c
Camp	c
.	c

And	c
I	c
always	c
was	c
good	c
at	c
swimming	c
,	i
now	i
I	c
'll	c
be	c
at	c
the	c
Camp	c
during	c
the	c
summer	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
good	c
idea	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
'll	c
need	c
to	i
the	c
trip	c
and	i
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
'll	c
need	c

of	c

Dear	c
sir	i
or	i
madam	i
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
in	i
response	i
of	i
your	c
advertisement	c
about	i
the	c
show	c
of	i
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
.	c

On	i
your	c
advertisement	c
you	c
say	c
that	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
are	c
starring	c
in	c
the	c
play	c
but	c
I	c
am	c
sure	c
that	c
they	c
never	c
appear	i
on	c
the	c
stage	c
that	c
night	c
.	c

Secondly	c
another	i
ploblem	i
was	c
about	i
the	c
starting	c
time	c
,	i
according	i
to	c
your	c
advertisement	c
the	i
play	c
starts	c
at	c
19.30	c
and	i
instead	c
it	c
started	c
on	i
20:15	c
,	c
this	c
is	c
about	i
almost	c
an	c
hour	i
delay	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
there	i
were	i
several	i
prices	i
about	i
the	i
tickets	i
and	i
an	i
available	i
discount	i
,	c
Something	i
that	c
was	c
n't	c
true	c
.	c

We	c
did	c
n't	c
get	c
any	c
discount	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
On	i
your	c
advertisement	c
you	c
say	c
that	c
visitors	c
can	c
visit	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
play	c
,	c
but	c
the	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
and	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
why	c
.	c

Technology	c
-	c
along	c
with	c
science	c
-	c
has	c
made	c
huge	c
steps	c
and	c
has	c
turned	c
into	c
a	i
growing	i
monster	i
which	i
does	i
n't	i
have	i
an	i
ending	i
.	c

All	c
thease	i
play	c
a	i
serious	i
role	c
in	c
our	c
daily	c
life	c
with	i
out	i
ever	i
understanding	c
it	i
.	c

Those	c
things	c
can	c
and	c
do	c
make	c
our	c
lifes	i
easier	c
and	c
more	c
comfortable	c
,	c
but	c
the	i
call	i
us	c
away	c
from	c
our	c
friends	c
,	c
our	c
families	c
and	c
more	i
over	i
they	c
lead	c
us	c
to	c
madness	c
and	c
cut	c
any	i
relantionship	i
with	c
everything	c
that	c
suround	i
us	c

Respect	i
to	c
the	c

that	c
I	c
would	c
like	c

must	i
be	c
only	i
on	i
July	c
15th	c
because	c
my	c

I	c
'm	c

since	i
this	c
date	c
until	c
early	c
August	c
that	i
I	c
will	c
start	c
to	c
work	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
spend	c
my	c
time	c
at	c
your	c
Camp	c
site	c
in	c
log	i
cabins	i
.	c

I	c
think	c
is	i
going	c
to	c
be	c
more	c
confortable	i
for	c
me	c
due	c
that	i
I'am	i
very	c
sensitive	c
to	c
changes	c
of	c
temperature	c
and	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
take	c
the	c
risk	c
to	i
catch	i
a	c
cold	c
as	i
you	c
know	c
I	i
'm	c
going	c

Looking	c

from	c
you	c

Hello	c
Kim	c

How	c
are	c
you	c
?	c

If	c
you	c
have	c
the	c
opportunity	c
to	c
do	c
this	c
do	c
n't	c
missed	i
out	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
to	c
see	c
you	c
soon	c
to	c
tell	i
you	c
more	c
details	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writting	i
you	i
for	i
complaining	i
about	c
the	c
last	c
saturday	i
evening	c
performance	c
in	i
your	c
theatre	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
the	c
principal	c
character	c
was	c
not	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
but	c
a	c
substitute	c
,	c
and	c
the	c
theatre	c
had	c
not	c
notified	c
the	c
audience	c
about	c
this	c
changing	i
before	c
.	i

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
very	c
soon	c
.	c

Modern	c
technology	c
has	c
changed	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
,	c
making	c
it	c
easy	c
,	c
with	c
less	c
effort	c
and	c
time	c
spent	c
.	i

A	c
simple	c
example	c
,	c
we	c
can	c
at	i
the	c
same	c
time	c
wash	i
our	c
clothes	c
with	i
a	c
washing	c
machine	c
,	c
record	c
a	c
tv	i
program	i
and	c
talk	c
to	c
someone	c
on	c
the	c
other	c
side	c
of	c
the	c
world	c
.	c

Technology	c
allows	c
to	i
have	c
more	c
time	c
to	i
distractions	i
or	c
to	i
other	c
things	c
we	c
really	c
like	c
to	c
.	i

We	c
can	c
take	c
care	c
of	c
whom	i
we	c
love	c
and	c
give	c
them	c
more	c
attention	c
,	i
time	c
is	c
not	c
a	i
really	i
problem	c
.	c

We	c
will	c
see	c
people	c
differently	c
,	c
with	i
more	c
calm	i
,	c
because	c
we	c
have	i
no	c
stress	c
and	c
we	c
are	c
not	c
in	c
a	c
hurry	c
to	c
do	c
something	c
else	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
the	c
first	c
step	c
for	i
a	c
true	c
fraternity	c
.	c

Of	c
course	c
,	c
everything	c
can	i
not	i
be	c
completely	c
perfect	c
.	c

All	c
this	c
modern	c
technology	c
increase	i
the	c
level	c
of	c
polluted	i
products	c
that	c
can	i
not	i
be	c
easily	c
destructed	i
.	c

Living	c
better	c

people	c
live	c
longer	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
necessary	c
to	c
product	i
more	c

more	c

Conclusion	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
have	c
answers	c
to	c
your	c
questions	c
.	c

I	c
love	c
basketball	c
because	c
I	c
'm	c
good	c
at	c
it	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
my	c
favourite	c
sport	c
.	c

The	c
other	c
thing	c
I	c
'm	c
good	c
at	c
is	c
tennis	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
been	c
practcing	i
tennis	c
for	c
2	c
years	c
and	c
I	c
won	c
the	c
Under	c
16	i
U.S	c
open	c
tour	i
last	c
summer	c
.	c

Would	i
I	c
have	c
to	c
bring	c
many	c
clothes	c
e.g.	i
would	i
we	c
do	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
outdoor	c
activities	c
,	c
get	c
dirty	c
etc.	i
Would	i

lot	c
of	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

The	c
more	c
stuff	c
we	c
buy	c
the	i
more	c
we	c
throw	c
away	c

Shopping	c
with	c
some	c
friends	c
may	c
be	c
fun	c
but	c
you	c
must	c
also	c
remember	c
that	c
you	c
are	c
spending	c
money	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
this	c
is	c
all	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
say	c
to	c
make	c
you	c
think	c
that	c
shopping	c
is	c
n't	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
and	c
change	c
your	c
view	i
in	i
looking	i
at	i
shopping	c
.	c

I	i
have	i
no	i
idea	i
from	i
where	i
to	i
start	i
.	c

The	c
main	c
character	c
of	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
,	c
which	i
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
say	c
was	c
n't	c
the	c
"	c
BEST	c
"	c
,	c
was	c
awfull	i
.	c

After	c
the	c
horrible	i
act	i
of	c
your	c
star	c
,	c
it	i
comes	c
the	c
starting	c
ours	i
.	c

And	c
then	c
,	c
when	c
I	c
arrived	c
at	c
the	c
theatre	c
I	i
expected	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
discount	c
but	c
unfortunatly	i
I	c
did	c
n't	c
.	c

Among	i
all	i
these	i
the	i
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
,	i
because	c
the	c
shef	i
and	c
the	c
waiters	c
where	i
on	c
holiday	c
.	c

Yours	c
sensirly	i

It	c
all	c
started	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
about	c
10	c
years	c
old	c
,	c
like	i
my	c
brother	c
now	i
,	c
and	c
I	c
overheard	c
my	c
mother	c
talking	c
about	c
my	c
father	c
and	c
his	c
problems	c
,	i
to	c
my	c
aunt	c
.	c

All	c
these	c
years	c
I	c
believed	c
that	c
my	c
father	c
was	c
killed	c
in	c
a	c
car	c
accitend	i
.	c

I	c
was	c
leaving	i
in	i
a	c
lie	c
.	c

I	c
knew	c
that	c
she	c
is	i
close	c
to	c
my	c
brother	c
and	c
that	c
she	c
loves	i
him	c
a	c
lot	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
never	c
thought	c
that	c
things	c
could	i
turn	c
like	i
this	c
.	c

When	c
,	i
one	c
day	c
Pat	c
came	c
over	c
to	c
my	c
house	c
we	i
started	c
arguing	c
about	c
common	i
things	c
and	c
in	i
our	c
fite	i
suddenly	i
came	i
about	i
the	i
subject	i
of	i
my	i
father	i
and	i
his	i
problems	i
.	c

My	c
brother	c
could	c
n't	c
stay	c
away	c
.	c

He	c
stand	i
outside	c
my	c
door	c
and	c
heard	c
every	c
single	c
word	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
realised	c
it	i
,	c
it	c
was	c
too	c
late	c
.	c

that	i
I	c

only	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

Sometime	i
when	c
I	c
'm	c
boring	i
and	c
ca	c
n't	c
find	c
something	c
else	c
to	c
do	c
.	i

When	c
I	c
see	c
some	c
clothes	c
in	c
the	c
window	c
I	c
like	c
,	c
I	c
would	i
go	c
in	c
and	c
try	c
them	c
.	i

All	c
the	c
shops	c
are	c
full	c
of	c
people	c
,	c
and	c
people	c
treat	c
the	c
articals	i
like	c
rubbish	c
.	c

Also	c
in	i
the	i
weekend	c
shopping	c
.	c

You	c
do	i
ca	c
n't	c
find	c
some	i
where	i
to	c
sit	c
down	c
comfortaly	i
to	c
have	c
a	c
cup	c
of	c
tea	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

According	c
to	c
your	c
advertisement	c
,	c
it	c
stars	c
DANNY	c
BROOK	c
AND	i
TINA	c
TRUELOVE	c
,	c
but	c
surprisinggly	i
,	c
it	i
was	i
proformed	i
by	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
who	i
I	c
even	i
did	i
n't	i
know	c
the	c
name	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	i
be	i
started	i
at	c
19:30	c
but	c
it	c
was	i
half	c
hour	i
later	c
,	c
until	i
20:15	c
.	c

The	c
last	c
thing	c
is	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
because	c
it	c
only	c
opened	c
until	c
9	c
o'clock	c
at	c
night	c
.	c

You	c
can	c
imagine	c
how	c
disappointed	c
I	c
am	i
when	i
spending	c
money	c
on	c
such	c
a	c
terrible	c
evening	c
.	c

Nowadays	c
,	c
we	c
use	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
modern	c
technology	c
both	c
at	c
home	c
and	c
office	i
but	c
it	c
has	c
its	c
aventage	i
and	c
disaventage	i
.	c

The	c
first	c
and	c
most	c
important	c
thing	c
is	c
that	c
modern	c
technology	c
have	i
made	c
our	c
life	c
easier	c
,	c
for	c
instance	c
ricer	i
cooker	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
invention	c
,	c
all	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
do	c
is	c
putting	i
rice	c
on	i
it	c
and	c
switch	c
on	i
,	c
it	c
makes	c
cooking	c
more	c
effeciently	i
.	c

Wherever	c
you	c
are	c
,	c
you	c
can	c
get	c
in	c
touch	c
with	c
people	c
whenever	c
you	c
want	c
.	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
I	c
believe	c
that	c
modern	c
technology	c
could	c
help	c
our	c
daily	c
life	c
but	c
we	c
should	c
not	c
alway	i
rely	c
on	c
it	c
.	c

Mr	c
Smith	c
,	c

Indeed	c
,	c
firstly	i
,	c
the	c
play	i
did	c
n't	c
start	c
at	c
19:30	c
as	c
it	c
was	c
planned	i
on	i
the	c
advertisement	c
but	c
45	c
minutes	c
later	c
(	c
20:15	c
)	c
.	c

There	c
were	c
different	c
actors	c
who	c
took	c
the	i
role	i
.	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
on	i
the	c
advertisement	c
I	c
got	c
,	c
was	i
written	c
that	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
opened	i
.	c

The	c
customers	c
were	c
n't	c
told	c
why	c
they	c
could	c
n't	c
have	c
a	c
meal	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
can	c
notice	i
,	c
my	i
perfect	c
evening	c
I	c
had	c
supposed	i
,	i
was	c
a	c
nightmare	c
;	c
that	c
's	c
why	c
I	c
would	c
please	i
you	i
to	i
give	i
my	i
money	c
back	c
because	c
I	c
cannot	c
tolerate	c
such	c
a	c
thing	c
!	c

Indeed	c
,	c
the	i
modernism	i
helps	c
us	c
to	c
lead	c
a	c
confortable	i
and	c
better	c
life	c
than	c
before	c
.	c

People	c
could	c
n't	c
think	i
of	c
such	c
innovation	c
in	c
our	c
world	c
and	c
yet	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
created	c
.	c

Everyone	c
gets	i
a	c
television	c
at	c
home	c
.	c

"	c
A	c
machine	c
which	c
talks	c
and	c
shows	c
pictures	c
!	c
"	c

It	c
's	c
a	c
revolution	c
,	c
something	c
which	c
was	c
unbelievable	c
a	c
few	c
centuries	c
ago	c
.	c

Although	c
there	c
are	c
new	c
machines	c
etc	c
,	c
the	i
health	i
makes	c
many	c
discoverts	i
thanks	c
to	c
the	i
searching	i
on	i
different	c
diseases	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
make	c
the	c
population	c
lived	i
older	i
.	c

Of	c
course	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
child	c
we	c
were	i
often	i
camping	i
.	c

There	c
are	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
interesting	c
activities	c
and	c
it	i
makes	c
hard	i
to	c
choose	c
only	c
two	c
.	c

Given	c
the	c
circumstances	c
I	i
would	c
like	c
to	c
learn	c
more	c
about	c
Photograhy	i
and	c
Painting	i
.	c

I	c
have	c
same	i
skills	c
in	c
drawing	i
landscape	i
but	c
I	c
have	c
no	c
idea	c
about	c
photography	c
.	c

What	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
would	c
you	c
recommend	c
taking	c
with	c
me	c
?	c

Yours	c
faithfully	i

Artemis	c

I	c
could	c
n't	c
write	c
you	i
because	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
busy	c
.	c

Last	c
month	c
I	c
enjoyed	c
helping	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
in	c
my	c
town	c
.	c

You	c
can	c
imagine	c
how	c
disappointed	c
I	c
was	c
.	c

But	c
it	c
turned	c
out	c
as	i
a	c
funny	i
and	c
interesting	c
job	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
to	c
prepare	c
the	c
ingredians	i
for	c
every	c
meal	c
.	c

It	i
means	i
I	c
had	c
to	c
read	c
the	c
recipies	i
very	c
carefully	c
.	c

And	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
controll	i
that	c
nothing	c
will	i
be	i
missed	c
.	c

On	i
the	i
other	i
hand	i
I	c
had	c
a	c
lot	c
to	c
do	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
never	c
bored	c
.	c

And	c
what	c
about	c
you	c
?	c

I	c
am	c
interested	c
to	c
hear	c
about	c
your	c
new	c
dog	c
?	c

Your	c
friend	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
to	c
complate	i
about	c
the	c
show	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
at	c
your	c
theatre	c
"	c
The	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
"	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
deeply	c
disapointed	i
with	c
the	c
service	c
and	c
the	c
unrealiable	i
notice	i
,	i
at	c
your	c
theartre	i
.	c

I	i
've	i
attened	i
your	c
shown	i
on	i
one	c
of	i
the	i
evening	c
,	c
during	c
my	c
stay	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
disapointed	i
by	c
this	c
.	c

You	c
also	c
mention	c
that	c
your	c
show	c
would	c
starts	i
at	c
19.30	c
but	c
to	c
my	c
knowleage	i
it	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
and	c
that	c
is	i
fourty-five	i
minutes	c
of	c
waiting	c
.	c

And	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
a	c
refun	i
,	i
You	c
have	c
wasted	c
my	c
evening	c
and	c
money	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
to	c
hear	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

Now	i
a	i
day	i
clothes	c
is	i
designed	c
to	c
be	c
more	c
comfortable	c
.	c

You	c
can	c
just	c
"	c
pop	c
down	c
the	c
road	c
"	c
and	c
go	c
shopping	c
.	c

Clothes	c
are	c
now	c
mass	i
producted	i
and	c
desing	i
by	c
desingers	i
.	c

Desingres	i
are	c
unique	c
in	c
the	i
way	c
but	c
their	c
desings	i
are	c
some	i
times	i
more	c
,	i
a	c
pirce	i
of	c
art	c
and	c
not	c
for	c
realistic	i
perposoe	i
.	c

Scinetis	i
might	c
discover	c
a	c
new	c
way	c
to	c
make	c
clothes	c
more	c
fixalde	i
.	c

It	c
could	c
be	c
that	c
you	c
would	i
carry	c
a	c
small	c
round	c
box	c
.	c

It	c
would	c
provide	c
you	c
with	c
a	c
new	c
type	c
of	c
material	c
to	c
cover	c
you	i
body	c
and	c
you	c
can	i
chosse	i
what	c
you	c
want	c
to	c
wear	c
by	c
pressing	c
bottons	i
.	c

This	c
would	c
be	c
very	c
easy	c
to	c
mantage	i
but	c
that	i
mean	i
no	c
shopping	i
for	c
girls	c
.	c

It	c
would	c
be	c
scarly	i
to	c
live	c
in	i
the	i
new	i
100	i
years	i
,	c
but	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
interesting	c
to	c
see	c
what	c
will	c
happen	c
.	c

Hopefully	c
it	i
would	i
n't	i
be	i
verybody	i
walking	i
around	i
neaked	i
.	c

About	c
the	c
activities	c
during	i
the	c
Camp	i
I	i
can	c
tell	c
you	c
,	i
that	c
I	c
like	c
to	c
play	c
Tennis	i
and	c
I	c
do	i
it	c
very	c
good	i
.	c

It	c
's	c
a	c
very	c
favourite	i
sport	c
also	i
in	i
our	i
region	i
(	i
area	i
)	i
,	c
but	c
I	c
did	i
never	c
found	c
time	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
.	c

Another	c
question	c
-	c
what	c
sorts	i
of	c
clothes	c
shall	c
I	c
bring	c
with	c
me	c
?	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hear	i
from	c
you	c
,	c

sorry	i
,	c
I	c
'm	c
late	c
I	c
know	c
,	c
but	c
now	c
I	c
will	c
tell	c
you	c
something	c
about	c
my	c
experience	c
last	c
month	c
.	c

The	c
concert	c
started	c
on	c
the	c
15th	c
of	c
may	i
and	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
real	i
great	c
session	c
in	c
our	c
valley	c

I	c
was	c
so	c
happy	c
when	c
they	c
told	i
me	c
to	c
help	c
them	c
with	c
the	c
organisation	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
realy	i
a	c
new	c
job	c
for	c
me	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
think	c
,	i
I	c
have	i
done	i
good	i
.	c

I	c
've	c
learned	c
a	c
lot	c
about	c
management	c
and	c
especially	c
-	i
how	c
stars	c
are	i
living	i
.	c

One	c
evening	c
we	c
went	i
all	i
together	i
out	c
for	c
diner	i
and	c
after	c
we	c
visited	i
our	i
new	c
disco	c
.	c

...	c

A	c
good	c
idea	c
at	i
least	i
-	c
you	c
come	c
here	c
and	c
I	c
tell	i
you	c
some	c
other	c
story	i

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
,	c

The	c
advertisement	c
provided	c
false	c
information	c
,	c
e.g.	c
the	c
names	c
of	c
the	c
actors	c
were	c
incorrect	c
-	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
was	c
not	c
performing	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
to	c
say	c
,	c
this	c
fact	c
disappointed	c
me	c
very	c
much	c
.	c

There	c
were	c
two	c
other	c
problems	c
:	c
there	c
were	c
no	c
discounts	c
contrary	i
to	c
the	c
information	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
,	c
and	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
repairement	i
works	i
.	c

This	c
evening	c
,	c
as	c
you	c
can	c
see	c
,	c
proved	c
to	c
be	c
far	c
from	c
perfect	c
.	c

My	c
daily	c
life	c
has	c
been	c
changed	c
much	c
by	c
modern	c
technology	c
without	c
me	c
noticing	c
it	c
up	c
to	c
this	c
point	c
.	c

This	c
made	i
my	c
life	c
easier	c
,	c
and	c
at	c
the	c
same	c
time	c
saved	i
some	c
trees	c
in	c
a	c
rainforest	i
from	c
being	c
cut	c
.	i

When	c
I	c
am	c
too	c
tied	i
to	c
go	c
out	c
but	c
want	c
to	c
meet	c
some	c
new	c
people	c
,	c
computer	c
technology	c
provides	c
me	c
with	c
this	i
opportunity	c
.	c

With	c
all	c
the	c
resources	c
on	c
the	c
Net	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
need	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
library	c
as	c
often	c
as	c
I	c
used	c
to	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
say	c
thank	c
to	i
you	c
for	c
this	c
good	c
programme	c
,	c
especially	c
the	i
decision	c
of	i
going	i
to	c
visit	c
in	i
London	c
.	c

All	c
of	c
us	c
is	i
appreciated	i
that	i
we	i
could	i
have	i
this	c
opportunity	c
.	c

This	c
show	c
takes	c
place	c
at	c
Central	i
Exhibition	c
Hall	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
from	c
10:00	c
to	c
19:00	c
.	c

In	i
this	c
show	c
,	c
not	c
only	c
can	c
we	c
see	c
latest	i
fashions	c
,	c
leisure	c
and	c
sports	c
wear	c
,	c
make	i
up	i
and	c
hairstyles	c
,	c
but	c
we	c
also	i
can	i
enter	c
for	c
free	c
.	c

Moreover	c
some	c
students	c
think	c
that	c
they	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
do	c
fashion	c
studies	c
in	c
future	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
would	i
accept	c
and	c
would	c
n't	c
mind	c
this	c
idea	c
,	c
we	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
visit	c
it	c
instead	c
of	c
shopping	c
in	c
the	c
afternoon	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Nowadays	c
,	c
quite	c
a	c
few	c
famous	c
people	c
suffer	c
their	i
private	c
life	c
from	c
disturbers	c
such	c
as	c
journalists	c
or	c
reporters	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
think	i
how	c
media	i
effect	i
to	i
famous	c
people	c
.	c

Few	i
years	c
ago	c
,	c
we	c
had	c
a	i
terrible	c
news	c
of	c
death	i
of	c
Lady	c
Diana	c
.	c

It	c
must	c
be	c
a	c
good	c
example	c
of	c
media	i
disaster	c
.	c

However	c
she	i
definetely	i
deserve	i
to	c
have	c
a	c
private	c
life	c
as	c
one	i
of	i
citizen	c
.	c

Human	c
right	i
must	c
be	i
existed	i
for	c
all	c
people	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
few	i
famous	c
people	c
desire	i
to	c
be	c
watched	c
by	c
media	i
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
many	c
people	c
love	c
to	c
watch	c
a	c
gossip	c
programme	c
on	c
TV	c
or	c
in	i
a	c
magazine	c
.	c

On	c
balance	c
,	c

Dear	c
Ms.	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
:	c

I	c
think	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
only	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
at	c
that	c
time	c
I	c
am	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
free	c
to	c
travel	c
because	c
of	c
my	c
holidays	i
in	i
the	i
school	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
rather	c
to	i
stay	i
in	c
tents	i
,	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
stayed	c
in	c
tents	c
before	c
and	c
I	c
liked	c
,	i
it	i
is	c
more	c
pleasent	i
than	c
stay	i
in	c
log	c
cabins	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
such	c
a	c
wonderful	c
experience	c
.	c

Refering	i
about	i
sports	c
I	i
would	c
choose	c
swimming	c
and	c
basketball	c
,	c
because	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
child	c
I	c
used	c
to	c
swim	c
a	c
lot	c
,	c
I	c
won	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
prizes	c
and	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
competitions	c
.	c

About	c
basketball	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
say	c
I	c
like	c
it	i
to	i
play	i
as	c
well	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
my	c
favourite	c
sport	c
in	c
highschool	c
,	i
I	c
was	c
not	c
as	c
good	c
as	i
in	i
swimming	c
but	c
I	c
like	c
it	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
.	c

I	c
remember	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
younger	c
I	c
used	c
to	c
go	c
with	c
my	c
mom	c
shopping	i
to	i
the	i
stores	i
but	c
I	c
did	c
not	c
like	c
it	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
found	c
boring	i
to	c
buy	c
clothes	c
spending	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
hours	c
in	c
a	c
commercial	i
centre	i
.	c

Another	c
bad	c
thing	c
could	i
be	i
the	c
enormous	c
queues	c
in	c
the	c
supermarkets	c
,	i
it	i
is	c
incredible	c
how	c
many	i
time	c
you	c
can	c
spend	c
in	c
there	c
.	c

The	i
last	i
month	c
was	i
a	c
robbery	c
in	c
a	c
commercial	i
centre	i
next	c
to	c
my	c
house	c
,	i
somebody	i
stole	c
a	c
lady	c
's	c
purse	c
with	c
all	c
her	c
identifications	i
,	c
credit	c
cards	c
and	c
cash	c
,	c
even	c
more	i
her	c
flight	i
ticket	c
.	c

Unlucky	c
lady	c
.	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
I	c
would	c
say	c
that	c
even	c
when	i
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	i
enjoyable	c
we	c
have	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
because	c
we	c
do	c
not	c
have	c
another	c
option	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
and	c
for	c
having	c
inform	i
me	c
about	c
the	c
results	c
of	c
the	c
competition	c
.	c

While	c
in	c
California	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
sleep	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
can	c
live	i
closer	c
to	c
the	i
nature	c
.	c

Anyway	c
the	c
accommodation	c
is	c
not	c
a	c
big	c
problem	c
for	c
me	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
away	c
most	c
of	c
the	c
time	c
.	c

Moreover	c
would	i
like	c
if	i
it	c
is	c
possible	c
to	c
have	c
an	c
opportunity	c
to	c
play	c
tennis	c
and	c
basketball	c
.	c

Before	c
ending	c
my	c
letter	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
and	i
be	i
told	i
specialy	i
in	i
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
should	i
I	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
with	c
me	c
and	c
also	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
change	c
some	c
money	c
of	c
mine	c
in	i
Dollars	i
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c

It	c
was	c
really	c
an	c
unforgettable	c
experience	c

DEAR	c
SIR	c

FIRSTLY	c
,	c
IN	c
THE	c
ADVERTISEMENT	c
FOR	c
THE	c
SHOW	c
IT	c
SAID	c
THAT	c
THE	c
STAR	c
WAS	c
DANNY	c
BROOK	c
,	c
AND	c
THAT	c
WAS	c
FALSE	i
BECAUSE	c
THERE	c
WAS	c
A	c
DIFFERENT	c
ACTOR	c
.	c

IT	c
IS	c
ALSO	c
ADVERTISED	c
THAT	c
THERE	c
WERE	c
DISCOUNTS	c
AVAILABLE	c

HOWEVER	c
,	c
THAT	c
WAS	c
ANOTHER	c
LIE	c

LASTLY	c
,	c
AFTER	c
THAT	c
AWFULL	i
EXPERIENCE	c
I	c
TRIED	c
TO	c
VISIT	c
YOUR	c
THEATRE	c
RESTAURANT	c
,	c
OF	c
COURSE	c
,	c
I	c
COULD	c
N'T	c

BECAUSE	c
IT	c
WAS	c
CLOSE	i

YOURS	c
FAITHFULLY	c

INGO	c
SANOU	c

LAST	c
WEEK	c
I	c
HAD	c
AN	c
ARGUE	i
WITH	c
MY	c
MOTHER	c
.	c

SHE	c
TOLD	c
ME	c
THAT	c
I	c
WAS	c
SPENDING	c
TOO	c
MUCH	c
TIME	c
WITH	c
MY	c
FRIENDS	c
,	c
SO	c
MY	c
QUALIFICATIONS	i
WERE	c
GOING	c
TO	c
BE	c
VERY	c
BAD	c
.	c

I	c
REALLY	c
WANTED	c
TO	c
GO	c
,	c
AND	c
I	c
KNEW	c
THAT	c
MY	c
EXAM	c
WAS	i
NO	i
GOOD	i
,	c
SO	c
I	c
TOLD	c
MY	c
MOTHER	c
THAT	c
I	c
WOULD	c
GET	c
MY	c
QUALIFICATIONS	i
THE	c
NEXT	c
MONDAY	c
,	c
SO	c
MY	c
MOTHER	c
ALLOWED	c
ME	c
TO	c
GO	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
to	c
explain	i
some	c
problems	c
about	i
your	c
theatre	c
's	c
show	c
,	i
first	i
I	c
have	c
to	c
say	c
to	c
you	c
that	c
there	c
was	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
starring	i
the	i
act	i
.	c

For	c
all	c
those	c
reasons	c
I	c
give	i
to	i
you	c
,	c
I	c
ask	c
for	c
the	c
money	c
I	c
had	i
payed	i
to	i
you	i
back	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
my	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
sorry	c
if	c
I	c
make	i
any	i
problem	i
to	i
you	i
,	c
but	c
I	c
'm	c
very	c
angry	c
and	c
it	c
was	c
your	c
fault	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
fourteen-year-old	i
and	c
I	c
was	c
with	c
my	c
bestfriend	i
,	c
Pat	c
.	c

Our	c
parents	c
took	c
us	c
there	c
because	c
they	c
wanted	c
that	i
we	i
became	i
good	c
and	i
polite	c
girls	c
.	c

I	c
thought	c
that	i
was	c
good	i
idea	c
told	i
to	i
Pat	c
because	c
we	c
could	c
use	c
to	i
look	c
for	c
exams	c
,	c
and	c
then	c
we	c
could	c
pass	c
all	c
of	c
them	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
told	c
to	i
her	c
,	c
she	c
promised	c
to	i
me	c
that	c
she	c
kept	i
the	c
secret	c
.	c

All	c
our	c
mates	c
wanted	c
to	c
enjoy	c
our	c
fantastic	c
and	i
secret	c
path	c
to	c
look	c
for	c
exams	c
.	c

Then	c
somebody	c
told	c
to	i
a	c
teacher	c
and	c
the	c
teachers	c
went	c
to	c
talk	c
to	c
our	c
parents	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
,	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
should	c
say	c
that	c
I	c
had	c
read	c
fantastic	c
reviews	c
of	c
it	c
in	c
several	c
newspapers	c
,	c
specially	c
regarding	c
the	c
starring	c
actors	c
'	c
superb	c
performances	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
nothing	i
was	i
further	i
from	i
what	i
really	i
happened	i
.	c

Then	c
,	c
the	c
audience	c
had	c
to	c
wait	c
45	c
minutes	c
over	i
the	c
announced	c
timetable	i
for	c
the	c
show	c
to	c
get	c
started	c
.	c

And	c
finally	c
,	c
when	c
it	i
went	i
on	c
,	c
we	c
realised	c
that	c
there	i
was	c
not	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
performing	c
,	c
which	c
was	c
really	c
disappointing	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
realise	c
this	c
was	c
totally	c
different	c
from	c
what	c
you	c
advertised	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
in	c
the	c
very	c
near	c
future	c
offering	c
me	c
some	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

Nowadays	c
we	c
can	c
see	c
a	c
very	c
different	c
world	c
from	c
the	c
one	c
our	c
grandparents	c
,	c
or	c
even	c
our	c
parents	c
,	c
were	c
living	c
in	c
.	c

Actually	c
,	c
whereas	c
they	c
used	c
to	c
talk	c
about	c
how	c
their	c
daily	c
life	i
had	c
changed	c
in	c
comparison	c
with	c
previous	c
generations	c
'	c
,	c
we	c
remain	c
astonished	c
looking	i
how	i
our	c
lifes	i
are	c
changing	c
frenetically	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
instead	c
of	c
enjoying	c
this	c
fantastic	c
opportunity	c
,	c
people	c
have	c
become	c
hooked	c
on	c
technological	c
advances	c
,	c
feeding	c
back	c
their	c
development	c
in	c
an	c
accelerating	c
,	c
non-stopping	i
race	c
.	c

People	c
spend	c
more	c
and	c
more	c
time	c
working	c
,	c
searching	c
for	c
new	c
inventions	c
that	c
will	c
make	c
life	c
easier	c
,	c
but	c
then	c
fail	c
to	c
profit	c
all	i
the	c
obtained	i
benefits	i
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
taking	i
us	c
to	c
London	c
.	c

This	c
is	c
a	c
big	c
opportunity	c
to	c
discover	c
the	c
capital	c
.	c

Thoug	i
,	c
a	c
few	c
of	c
us	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
consider	i
the	c
"	c
London	c
fashion	c
and	c
leisure	c
show	c
"	c
.	c

Could	c
you	c
,	c
if	c
we	c
may	c
ask	i
so	i
,	c
re-organise	i
our	c
visit	c
to	c
the	c
museum	c
and	c
also	c
to	c
the	c
shopping	c
center	i
.	c

This	c
is	c
a	c
very	c
important	c
stay	c
over	c
three	c
days	c
.	c

Every	c
one	c
hopes	c
to	c
enjoying	i
himself	c
and	c
comes	i
back	c
with	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
knowledge	c
.	c

I	c
thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
hearing	c
my	c
request	c
.	c

I	i
am	i
certain	i
you	i
would	i
think	i
over	i
about	i
that	c
particular	c
visit	c
to	c
"	c
the	c
London	c
fashion	c

Do	c
they	c
want	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
to	c
complaint	i
about	c
the	c
problem	c
that	c
happened	c
in	c
the	c
play	c
called	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
"	c
,	c
and	c
for	i
this	i
reason	i
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
get	c
some	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
the	c
play	c
was	c
advertised	c
at	i
19.30	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

How	c
has	c
modern	c
technology	c
changed	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c

If	c
I	c
had	i
not	i
it	c
,	c
I	c
could	c
not	c
do	c
most	c
part	i
of	c
the	c
things	c
that	c
I	c
do	c
today	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
if	c
I	c
had	i
not	i
it	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
not	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
move	i
out	c
of	c
my	i
city	c
because	c
I	c
would	c
not	c
have	c
car	i
.	c

But	c
we	c
have	c
it	c
,	c
and	c
the	c
thing	c
that	c
have	i
changed	c
more	i
my	i
life	i
has	i
been	i
the	c
internet	i
.	c

Another	c
thing	c
apart	c
from	c
the	c
internet	i
and	c
the	c
car	c
that	c
has	c
changed	c
my	c
life	c
is	c
the	c
TV	c
.	c

With	c
the	c
TV	c
I	c
can	c
know	i
all	c
the	c
information	c
at	i
the	i
moment	i
,	c
moreover	c
I	c
can	c
see	c
films	c
throw	i
it	c
.	c

And	c
the	c
best	c
thing	c
is	c
that	c
it	c
entertaints	i
me	c
alone	c
or	c
with	c
people	c

The	c
reason	c
is	c
that	c
all	c
students	c
are	c
interested	c
in	c
it	c
and	c
the	c
teacher	c
is	c
so	c
good	c
in	i
explaing	i
problems	c
that	c
the	c
whole	c
class	c
takes	c
part	c
in	c
discussions	c
about	c
specific	c
aspects	c
of	c
the	c
subject	c
.	c

Also	c
the	c
sports-activities	i
should	c
be	c
filmed	c
;	c
they	c
express	c
an	c
aggregative	i
and	c
social	c
way	c
of	c
living	c
school-life	i
and	c
can	c
be	c
useful	c
to	c

The	c
manager	c

The	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c

Sir	c
,	c
I	c
returned	c
very	c
unhappy	c
from	c
my	c
holidays	c
.	c

The	c
reason	c
is	c
that	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
that	c
I	c
had	c
seen	c
with	c
my	c
wife	c
,	c
first	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
started	c
late	c
.	c

We	c
were	c
interested	c
on	i
see	i
the	c
actors	c
that	c
appeard	i
on	c
the	c
tickets	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
disappointed	c
when	c
,	c
in	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
we	c
saw	c
another	i
actors	c
.	c

With	c
all	c
this	i
problems	c
,	c
the	c
only	c
thing	c
that	c
led	i
us	i
,	i
was	c
to	i
eat	i
something	c
.	c

When	c
the	c
show	c
finished	c
we	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
and	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
people	i
did	c
n't	c
arrived	i
to	c
work	c
that	c
day	c
.	c

When	c
it	c
was	c
time	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
party	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
escape	c
home	i
without	c
telling	c
my	c
sister	c
,	i
unfortunately	i
when	c
I	c
arrived	i
she	c
was	c
waiting	c
me	i
in	c
my	c
room	c
.	c

At	i
sunday	i
night	c
,	c
when	c
my	c
parents	c
arrived	c
,	c
they	c
asked	c
her	c
if	c
I	c
had	c
stayed	c
at	c
home	c
on	c
saturday	i
,	i
my	i
sister	c
beheave	i
silence	i
for	c
a	c
minute	c
and	c
then	c
started	c
laughing	c
;	c
so	c
my	c
parents	c
,	c
with	c
her	c
laugh	c
,	c
know	i
that	c
I	c
had	c
go	i
out	c
that	c
Saturday	c
;	c
and	c
punished	c
me	c
for	c
a	c
year	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
congratulate	c
you	c
on	c
your	c
wonderful	c
"	c
Arts	c
Festival	c
"	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
fun	c
to	i
go	i
there	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
will	c
not	c
angry	i
if	c
I	c
give	c
you	c
some	c
advice	c
?	i

This	c
section	c
is	c
really	c
great	c
and	c
attract	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
people	c
.	c

From	c
my	c
point	c
of	c
view	c
,	c
it	c
will	c
better	c
if	c
you	c
have	c
some	c
"	c
Stars	c
and	c
Artists	c
"	c
from	c
only	c
six	c
countries	c
.	c

Because	c
the	c
spectators	c
will	c
probably	c
more	i
interested	c
in	c
your	c
festival	c
if	c
they	c
know	c
the	c
celebrities	c
.	c

I	c
also	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
talk	c
about	c
your	c
concerts	c
.	c

The	c
concerts	c
are	c
fabulous	c
but	c
the	c
problems	i
are	i
the	c
halls	c
.	c

Could	c
you	c
do	c
something	c
for	i
these	c
problems	c
?	c

All	c
the	c
sections	c
of	c
your	c
festival	c
were	c
great	c
but	c
I	c
think	c
there	c
were	c
not	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
"	c
Plays	c
and	c
films	i
"	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
a	c
good	c
idea	c
to	c
have	c
reasonably-priced	c
for	i
weekends	c
.	c

Dear	c
Phil	c
,	c

I	c
'm	c
really	c
happy	c
to	c
receive	c
your	c
letter	c
and	c
I	c
hope	c
you	c
are	c
fine	c
.	c

Alright	c
,	c
I	c
'm	c
going	c
to	c
answer	c
your	c
questions	c
.	c

At	i
first	i
;	c
.	c

You	c
are	c
not	c
allowed	c
to	c
smoke	c
,	c
drink	c
or	c
to	c
take	c
some	i
drugs	c
in	c
my	c
school	c
.	c

You	c
must	c
to	i
be	i
outside	c
during	c
the	c
break	c
.	c

You	c
must	c
sign	i
your	c
notebook	c
to	c
your	c
parents	c
every	c
week	c
.	c

You	c
are	c
not	c
allowed	c
to	c
argue	c
with	c
your	c
teacher	c
after	c
you	c
receive	i
an	c
exam	c
.	c

You	c
must	c
to	i
be	i
on	c
time	c
at	c
school	c
or	c
you	c
have	i
a	c
punishment	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
so	c
many	c
other	c
rules	c
but	c
these	c
are	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
.	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
you	i
in	c
order	c
to	c
answer	c
your	c
questions	c
and	c
to	c
get	c
some	c
information	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
have	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
I	i
want	c
you	c
to	c
know	c
I	c
am	c
really	c
happy	c
about	c
the	c
prize	c
.	c

The	c
only	c
problem	c
is	c
that	c
like	i
I	c
am	c
a	c
student	c
I	c
can	c
travel	c
only	c
during	c
holidays	i
,	c
in	c
July	c
.	c

If	c
I	c
have	i
to	c
be	c
honest	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
say	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
practised	i
none	i
of	c
them	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
appreciate	c
if	i
you	c
could	c
tell	c
me	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
and	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
should	c
take	c
.	c

Besides	i
,	c
I	c
wonder	c
if	c
I	c
will	c
share	c
the	i
tend	i
or	c
not	c
and	c
if	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
take	i
it	c
from	i
here	i
or	c
if	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
provided	c
by	c
you	c

If	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
told	i
you	c
the	i
experience	c
of	i
the	c
pop	c
concert	c
in	c
detail	c
in	c
my	c
last	c
letter	c
was	i
because	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
have	c
time	c
.	c

Please	c
do	c
n't	c
be	c
angry	c
.	c

We	c
started	c
mailing	c
each	c
other	c
and	c
became	c
good	c
friends	c
.	c

The	c
problem	c
was	c
that	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
technics	i
was	c
from	c
England	c
and	c
nobody	c
there	c
spoke	c
nor	i
a	c
word	c
in	i
English	c
so	c
I	c
was	c
asked	c
to	c
be	c
the	c
interpreter	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
so	c
great	c
!	c
!	c

Not	c
only	c
because	c
I	c
learnt	c
a	c
lot	c
about	c
concerts	c
and	c
music	c
,	c
but	c
also	c
because	c
I	c
practised	c
my	c
English	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
are	c
not	c
angry	c
any	c
more	c
after	c
this	c
letter	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
just	c
recived	i
your	c
letter	c
and	c
I	c
'm	c
very	c
happy	c
for	i
it	c
,	c
especially	c
becouse	i
the	c
competition	c
was	c
so	c
hard	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
could	c
to	i
pass	i
this	i
two	c
weeks	c
during	c
next	c
July	c
only	c
,	c
because	c
,	c
before	c
and	c
after	c
it	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
working	i
as	c
a	c
waiter	c
here	c
in	c
my	c
town	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
seeing	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

This	c
is	c
a	c
precise	i
letter	c
that	c
I	c
write	c
you	i
now	c
.	c

Last	c
month	c
I	c
visited	c
Tom	c
,	c
another	c
old	c
friend	c
,	c
and	c
he	c
told	c
me	c
if	i
I	i
had	i
worked	i
with	c
him	c
like	i
musician	i
at	c
the	c
XZY	c
pop	c
concert	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
embaracing	i
during	c
the	c
concert	c
,	c
but	c
all	c
the	c
staff	c
were	c
very	c
kindly	i
with	i
me	c
and	c
Tom	c
too	c
.	c

This	c
is	i
the	c
most	c
important	c
experience	c
in	c
my	c
life	c
,	c
I	c
knew	c
all	c
the	c
people	c
,	c
in	c
a	i
particular	c
the	c
famous	c
singer	c
"	c
Kos	c
"	c
.	c

He	c
is	c
funny	c
and	c
easy-going	i
.	c

I	c
can	c
only	c
tell	c
that	i
had	i
been	c
an	c
important	c
experience	c
for	c
me	c
and	c
for	c
my	c
new	c
songs	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
to	c
hearing	i
you	i
soon	c

WE	c
ASKED	c
ABOUT	c

THE	c
DISCOUNTS	c

THAT	c

THE	c

THE	c
LADY	c
WHO	c
WAS	c
SELLING	c
COULD	i
SAY	c
WAS	c
:	c
WHAT	c
DISCOUNTS	c

THEN	c
,	c
WE	c
MOVED	c
INSIDE	c
THE	c
THEATRE	c
AND	c
WE	c
HAD	c
TO	c
WAIT	c
45	c
MINUTES	c
UNTIL	c
THE	c
SHOW	c
BEGAN	c
!	c
!	c
,	c
WHILE	c

AND	c
THEN	c
,	i
WE	c

BY	c
THE	c
TIME	c
THE	c

STARTED	c
,	c
WE	c
WERE	c
SO	c
ANGRY	c
THAT	c
THE	c
ONLY	c
THING	c
I	c
REMEMBER	c
IS	c
THAT	c
DANNY	c

I	c
THINK	c
YOU	c
HAVE	c
ALREADY	c
REALIZED	c
THAT	c
IT	c
WAS	c
N'T	c
A	c
PLEASURE	c
FOR	c
US	c
TO	c
SEE	c
THE	c
SHOW	c

SO	c
I	c
HOPE	c
YOU	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

A	c
few	c
days	c
ago	c
,	c
as	c
I	c
was	c
having	c
a	c
week	c
's	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
,	c
I	c
read	c
your	c
advertisement	c
which	i
convinced	c
me	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
see	c
your	c
show	c
:	c
Over	c
The	c
Rainbow	c
.	c

I	c
must	c
tell	c
you	c
that	c
this	c
show	c
was	c
the	c
worst	c
one	c
I	c
had	c
ever	c
been	c
to	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
disappointed	c
by	c
the	c
fact	c
that	c
the	c
actors	c
who	c
played	i
were	c
not	c
the	c
ones	c
who	c
were	c
supposed	c
to	c
do	i
it	i
!	c

I	c
was	c
all	c
the	c
more	c
angry	c
as	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
instead	c
of	c
19:30	c
as	i
it	i
was	c
written	c
in	c
your	c
ad	c
!	c

Another	c
problem	c
:	c
there	c
was	c
no	c
discount	c
available	c
!	c

Finally	c
,	c
at	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
this	c
very	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
,	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
-	c
which	c
was	c
also	c
mentioned	c
in	c
your	c
ad	c
-	c
but	c
I	c
was	c
told	c
that	c
this	c
latter	i
was	c
closed	c
because	i
of	i
a	c
private	c
party	c
!	c

I	c
look	c
forwards	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

In	c
fact	c
,	c
she	c
knew	c
that	c
even	c
if	c
Sally	c
was	c
her	c
best	c
friend	c
,	c
she	c
would	c
not	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
keep	c
such	c
a	c
secret	c
.	c

Pat	c
was	c
totally	c
upset	c
.	c

But	c
when	c
she	c
saw	c
the	c
phone	c
that	c
she	c
used	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
call	c
her	c
friends	c
,	c
she	c
started	c
to	c
cry	c
since	c
she	c
knew	c
that	c
she	c
would	c
use	c
it	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
excited	c
with	i
the	c
idea	c
of	c
going	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
did	c
n't	c
work	c
out	c
as	c
I	c
thought	c
it	c
will	i
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
the	i
starring	c
actors	c
were	c
supposed	c
to	c
be	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
,	i
Tina	c
did	c
act	c
,	c
but	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
was	c
replaced	c
by	c
an	c
awful	c
actor	c
whose	c
name	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
recall	c
.	c

Second	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
the	c
play	c
was	c
suposed	i
to	c
start	c
at	c
19:30	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
not	c
used	c
to	c
waste	i
my	c
time	c
sitting	c
on	c
a	c
chair	c
waiting	c
,	c
I	c
do	c
have	c
better	c
things	c
to	c
do	c
with	c
it	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
having	c
some	c
family	c
problems	c
,	c
so	c
my	c
marks	c
were	c
getting	i
down	c
and	c
down	c
.	c

Pat	c
was	c
worried	c
,	c
she	c
did	c
n't	c
know	c
what	c
to	c
do	c
.	c

It	c
consisted	c
in	c
stealing	c
the	c
school	c
list	i
from	c
the	c
computer	c
,	c
in	c
other	c
words	c
,	c
hack	i

I	c
was	c
punished	c

nearly	c

but	c
Pat	c
did	c
n't	c
receive	c
any	c
punishment	c

I	c
have	c
just	c
received	c
your	c
letter	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
so	c
pleased	c
with	c
the	c
news	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
really	c
worry	c
about	c
the	c
accommodation	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
,	c
but	c
if	c
I	c
can	c
tell	i
you	i
wich	i
one	i
I	i
prefer	i
I	c
'll	c
choose	c
in	i
tent	i
.	c

This	c
is	c
because	c
is	i
more	c
exciting	c
and	c
fun	c
than	c
not	i
in	c
log	c
cabins	c

From	c
the	c
list	c
of	c
activities	c
to	i
do	i
at	c
the	c
Camp	c
I	c
will	c
enjoy	c
singing	c
and	c
swimming	c

I	c
used	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
a	c
swimming	c
pool	c
twice	c
every	c
week	c
and	c
also	c
I	c
love	c
music	c
and	c
sing	c
all	c

Dear	c

How	c

I	c
am	c
so	c
glad	c
to	c
know	c
that	c
you	c

It	c

And	c

The	c
concert	c
was	c
in	c
a	c
massive	c
club	c
and	c
the	c
tickets	c

sold	c
out	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
,	c

Two	c
days	c
before	c
I	c
read	c
the	i
advertisment	i
for	c
this	c
show	c
,	c
where	i
Danny	i
Brook	c
was	c
starring	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
last	i
evening	c
there	c
was	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
and	c
that	c
was	c
very	c
disappointing	c
.	c

Apart	c
from	c
that	c
the	i
show	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
not	i
at	c
19:30	c
,	c
as	c
it	c
is	i
written	i
in	c
the	c
advertisment	i
and	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
when	c
the	c
show	c
finished	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
receive	i
your	c
reply	c
with	c
my	c
money	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

Yesterday	c
afternoon	c
,	c
when	c
I	c
went	c
home	c
,	c
my	c
mother	c
want	i
to	c
talk	c
me	i
for	i
something	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
went	c
in	i
her	c
bedroom	c
to	c
speak	c
with	i
her	c
.	c

She	c
told	c
me	c
that	c
she	c
knew	c
that	c
last	c
Saturday	c
I	c
went	c
in	i
a	c
party	c
without	c
asked	i
her	c
and	c
that	c
she	c
had	c
to	c
punish	c
me	c
for	c
that	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writting	i
in	c
order	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
which	i
name	i
is	i
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
that	i
I	c
could	i
see	i
in	c
your	c
theatre	c
recently	c
.	c

I	c
like	c
very	i
much	i
this	i
musical	i
and	c
while	c
I	c
was	c
spending	c
some	c
days	c
in	c
London	c
I	c
could	i
see	i
you	i
advertisement	c
so	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
see	c
it	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
pitty	i
but	c
it	c
did	c
not	c
annoye	i
me	c
because	c
I	c
thought	c
that	c
the	c
musical	c
was	c
good	c
enough	c
to	c
pay	c
£	c
20	c
.	i

So	c
I	c
entered	c
to	i
the	c
theatre	c
to	c
enjoy	c
the	c
musical	c
but	c
I	c
do	c
not	c
know	c
the	c
reason	c
why	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
a	c
quarter	c
past	c
eight	c
(	c
three	c
quarters	c
delayed	i
)	c
.	c

Then	c
I	c
got	c
nervous	i
and	c
I	c
thought	c
that	c
the	c
organization	c
was	c
very	c
bad	c
because	c
nobody	c
explained	c
us	i
the	c
reasons	c
.	i

Finally	c
,	c
when	c
the	c
musical	c
started	c
I	c
realized	c
that	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
my	c
favourite	c
actor	c
,	c
was	c
not	c
there	c
.	c

After	c
the	c
show	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
drink	i
a	c
coffee	c
and	c
to	c
smoke	c
a	c
cigarrete	i
to	c
try	c
calm	i
myself	c
and	c
suddenly	c
I	c
could	c
see	c
that	c
the	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
the	c
free	i
day	i
for	i
the	i
barman	i
.	c

If	c
you	c
do	c
not	c
return	c
my	c
money	c
I	c
will	c
send	c
a	c
letter	c
to	c
a	c
lawyer	c
.	c

HOW	c
HAS	c
MODERN	c
TECHNOLOGY	c
CHANGED	c
YOUR	c
DAILY	c
LIFE	c
?	c

Change	c
were	i
n't	i
a	i
normal	i
situation	i
and	c
Governments	c
did	c
n't	c
invest	c
enough	c
money	c
on	i
it	c
.	c

Nowadays	c
,	c
technology	c
is	c
changing	c
our	c
life	c
every	c
day	c
.	c

My	c
computer	c
is	c
faster	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
able	c
to	c
do	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
things	c
on	i
that	i
I	i
wasted	i
a	i
lot	i
of	i
time	i
before	c
.	c

Not	c
only	c
are	c
the	i
computers	c
useful	c
for	c
keep	i
information	c
but	c
also	c
computers	c
can	c
give	c
you	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
information	c
due	i
to	c
Internet	i
.	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
modern	c
technology	c
is	c
changing	c
my	c
work	c
,	c
my	c
life	c
,	c
and	c
my	c
friends	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
end	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
disappointed	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
did	c
not	c
mind	c
anymore	c
because	c
I	c
knew	c
that	c
a	c
show	c
with	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
would	c
be	c
worth	c
this	c
.	c

At	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
the	c
musical	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
"	c
rescue	c
"	c
this	c
evening	c
by	c
visiting	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
.	c

"	c
The	c
Old	c
Man	c
and	c
the	c
Sea	c
"	c

What	c
makes	c
the	c
situation	c
difficult	c
is	c
that	c
none	i
of	c
the	c
two	c
characters	c
wants	c
to	c
give	c
up	c
.	c

It	c
becomes	c
a	c
fight	i
about	i
life	i
or	i
death	i
.	c

He	c
is	c
old	c
and	c
he	c
wants	c
to	c
win	c
this	c
last	c
competition	c
between	c
him	c
and	c
the	i
nature	c
.	c

So	c
he	c
bares	i
everything	c
:	c
the	c
days	c
and	c
nights	c
on	c
the	c
sea	c
,	c
without	c
any	c
food	c
or	c
water	c
,	c
the	c
terrible	c
summer	c
sun	c
,	c
the	i
being	c
injured	c
from	c
keeping	c
to	i
the	c
line	c
where	i
the	c
fish	c
is	c
on	i
.	c

The	c
reader	c
feels	c
with	i
him	c
,	c
wants	c
to	c
know	c
if	c
he	c
will	c
win	c
or	c
wonders	c
why	c
he	c
will	c
not	c
give	c
up	c
.	c

17th	c
of	c
June	c
of	c
2000	c
Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
writing	c
for	i
complaining	i
about	c
different	i
points	i
which	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
disappointing	i
.	i

I	c
was	i
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
called	c
'	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
'	c
.	c

There	c
I	c
was	i
many	i
problems	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
.	c

The	c
worst	c
thing	c
of	c
all	c
was	c
that	c
at	c
the	c
beggining	i
of	c
the	c
show	c
I	c
realized	c
that	c
the	c
actors	c
were	c
totally	c
different	c
.	i

They	c
were	c
worst	i
than	c
the	c
previst	i
actors	c
.	c

We	c
decided	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
to	c
eat	c
something	c
and	c
to	c
relax	c
.	c

The	c
surprise	c
was	c
that	c
the	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
absolutely	i
annoyed	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
give	c
back	i
money	i
because	c
everything	c
what	i
you	c
wrote	c
in	c
your	c
advertisement	c
was	c
not	c
true	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
your	i
answer	c
soon	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
CAROLINA	c
RODRIGEZ	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
going	c
to	c
write	c
about	c
what	c
clothes	c
will	c
be	c
worn	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
gone	c
out	c
to	i
the	c
street	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
asked	c
to	i
people	c
for	i
this	c
question	c
.	c

Most	c
of	i
people	c
think	c
that	c
character	c
people	i
and	c
clothes	c
are	c
together	i
.	c

I	c
really	c
think	c
that	c
living	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
will	c
be	c
like	c
living	c
in	i
the	c
moon	c
,	i
very	c
exciting	c
.	c

From	c
my	c
point	c
of	c
view	c
,	c
they	c
will	c
be	i
more	i
enjoyable	i
than	c
people	c
now	i
because	c
they	c
will	c
have	c
many	c
things	c
to	c
do	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
most	c
of	i
people	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
will	c
wear	c
glasses	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
a	c
point	i
very	i
interesting	i
.	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
,	c

Well	c
,	c
to	c
answer	c
to	i
your	c
questions	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
attend	c
at	i
this	c
camp	c
during	c
the	c
month	c
of	c
July	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
the	c
only	c
time	c
when	c
I	c
can	c
get	i
vacations	i
.	c

It	i
is	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
an	c
apprentice	c
,	c
so	c
they	c
let	i
me	i
have	i
my	i
vacations	i
only	i
in	i
July	i
!	c
!	c

Well	c
,	c
for	i
the	c
accomodation	i
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
staying	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
more	c
like	c
adventure	i
being	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
,	c
and	c
you	c
are	c
closer	c
to	c
the	i
nature	c
,	c
and	c
the	c
animals	c
!	c

And	c
I	c
am	c
really	c
good	c
at	c
it	c
,	i
I	c
used	c
to	c
do	i
some	i
competitions	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
younger	c
.	c

And	c
for	c
the	c
other	c
I	i
will	c
chose	i
tennis	c
,	i
I	c
really	c
enjoy	c
this	c
sport	c
,	i
I	c
am	c
not	c
really	c
a	c
good	c
player	c
but	c
I	c
like	c
to	c
practice	i
tennis	c
during	i
my	c
free	c
time	c
!	c

How	c
much	c
should	c
I	c
take	c
?	c

And	c
is	c
it	c
better	c
to	c
have	c
change	i
or	c
checks	i
?	c

Best	c
Regards	i
,	c

Helen	c

And	c
then	c
they	c
have	c
and	i
you	c
have	c
to	c
wait	c
to	c
try	c
on	c
the	c
pants	c
or	c
the	c
skirt	c
you	c
choose	i
.	c

And	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
wait	c
after	c
to	i
buy	c
it	c
,	c
so	c
finally	c
you	c
waited	i
so	c
long	c
that	c
you	c
are	i
getting	i
late	c
,	c
so	c
you	c
get	c
stressed	c
to	i
.	c

So	c
you	c
are	i
getting	i
a	c
headache	c
because	c
you	c
hear	c
the	c
kids	c
crying	c
,	c
the	c
mothers	c
yelling	c
,	i
if	i
I	c
can	c
give	c
you	c
an	i
advice	c
:	c
DO	c
N'T	c
GO	c
SHOPPING	c
ON	c
SATURDAY	c
!	c
!	c

I	c
recived	i
your	c
letter	c
recently	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
really	c
happy	c
learning	i
that	c
I	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
that	c
my	c
only	c
chance	c
is	i
go	i
there	i
in	c
July	c
,	i
it	i
does	i
not	i
matter	i
the	i
dates	i
,	c
but	c
it	c
is	c
important	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
be	c
back	c
before	c
the	c
1st	c
of	c
August	c
,	c
because	c
that	c
day	c
I	c
will	c
start	c
a	c
summer	c
job	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
I	c
had	i
a	c
photography	c
course	c
five	c
years	c
ago	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
took	c
part	c
in	c
several	c
competitions	c
.	c

Can	c
we	c
get	c
there	c
by	c
public	c
transport	c
?	c

Looking	c
forward	c
for	i
your	c
answer	c

Shopping	c
,	c
what	c
an	c
exciting	c
thing	c
!	c

Going	c
out	c
to	c
spend	c
a	c
day	c
shopping	c
is	c
something	c
very	c
popular	c
,	i
the	i
shopping	c
centers	i
are	c
always	c
busy	c
,	c
people	i
going	c
up	c
and	c
down	c
carrying	c
bags	c
and	c
looking	c
at	i
window	i
shops	i
,	i
seems	i
everbody	i
is	c
happy	c
.	c

Really	c
?	c

Sometimes	c
things	c
can	c
be	i
wrong	c
and	c
the	c
situations	i
changes	c
and	c
becomes	c
a	c
nightmare	c
.	c

Firstly	c
is	i
the	c
parking	c
problem	c
,	i
if	i
you	c
go	c
to	i
shopping	c
late	c
at	c
weekends	c
for	c
instance	c
,	c
it	c
's	c
really	c
difficult	c
to	c
find	c
a	c
place	c
to	c
park	c
your	c
car	c
,	c
and	c
when	c
you	c
get	c
the	i
place	c
,	c
pay	i
for	c
it	c
!	c

Then	c
the	c
search	c
for	c
a	c
nice	c
cloth	i
starts	c
,	c
and	c
when	c
eventually	c
you	c
get	c
it	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
n't	c
your	c
size	c
,	c
but	i
also	c
the	c
colour	c
that	c
you	c
like	c
is	c
not	c
available	c
.	c

With	i
the	c
hurries	i
you	c
've	c
forgotten	c
to	c
bring	c
any	c
cash	c
,	c
but	c
you	c
can	c
use	c
the	i
plastic	c
money	c
,	i
the	i
shop	c
assistant	c
pass	i
the	c
credit	c
card	c
through	c
the	c
machine	c
,	c
after	c
few	i
seconds	c
again	i
,	c
and	c
another	i
time	c
more	i
,	i
suddenly	i
his	c
face	c
changes	c
and	c
says	i
you	c
that	c
the	c
card	c
is	c
fault	i
!	c

No	c
choice	c
,	i
you	c
have	c
to	c
leave	c
your	c
nice	c
clothes	c
and	c
go	c
away	c
feeling	c
bad	c
and	c
sad	c
.	c

I	c
can	c
only	c
travel	c
on	i
July	c
because	c
these	i
is	c
the	c
mounth	i
when	c
I	c
have	c
holidays	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
some	c
problems	c
with	c
my	c
kidneys	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
stay	c
in	c
on	i
of	c
the	c
tents	c
,	c
and	c
it	i
also	i
must	c
be	c
very	c
comfortable	c
to	i
stay	i
a	i
log	c
cabin	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
really	c
good	c
at	c
Golf	c
and	c
Tennis	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
choose	c
these	c
two	c
activities	c
.	c

I	c
've	c
been	c
doing	c
these	c
activities	c
for	c
a	c
very	c
long	c
time	c
.	c

I	c
've	c
been	c
playing	c
Golf	c
for	c
five	c
years	c
,	c
and	c
I	i
'm	i
a	c
handidate	i
cup	i
of	c
sixteen	c
,	c
but	c
the	c
problem	c
is	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
n't	c
been	c
playing	c
Golf	c
for	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
because	c
I	c
work	c
every	c
day	c
.	c

I	c
've	c
been	c
playing	c
tannis	i
since	c
I	c
was	c
seven	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
've	c
been	c
studying	c
how	c
to	c
play	c
tannis	i
for	c
a	c
very	c
long	c
time	c
,	c
nine	c
years	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
cloths	i
do	i
I	c
need	c
to	c
take	c
with	c
me	c
,	c
and	c
can	c
you	c
write	c
me	i
back	i
what	i
kind	c
of	c
weather	c
it	i
's	i
going	i
to	i
be	i
there	c
,	c
for	c
the	c
time	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
staying	c
there	c
.	c

Also	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
should	i
I	i
take	c
with	c
me	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
'm	c
not	c
sure	c
how	c
much	c
I	c
'll	c
need	c
to	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
would	i
be	i
grateful	i
to	c
except	i
this	c
prize	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
,	i
at	i
present	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
doing	c
an	c
art	c
course	c
at	c
college	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
rather	c
stay	c
in	c
log	c
cabins	c
than	c
tents	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
a	c
member	c
of	c
college	i
Basketball	i
Team	i
which	i
became	c
the	c
best	c
Basketball	i
Team	i
of	c
last	c
year	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
do	c
painting	c
which	i
I	c
am	c
really	c
interested	c
in	c
and	i
as	c
a	c
student	c
of	i
Art	i
College	i
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
which	i
I	c
received	c
yesterday	c
and	i
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
reply	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c
.	c

I	c
know	c
you	c
want	c
to	c
learn	i
what	c
I	c
did	c
and	c
how	c
I	c
helped	c
people	c
at	c
the	c
pop	c
concert	c
last	c
month	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
know	c
,	c
our	c
college	c
was	c
chosen	c
to	c
be	c
there	c
and	c
help	c
the	c
singers	c
and	c
the	c
musicians	c
out	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
first	c
arrived	c
there	c
I	c
was	c
pretty	c
nervous	c
and	c
excited	c
.	c

I	c
even	c
go	i
a	c
bunch	c
of	c
flowers	c
from	c
them	c
with	c
a	c
"	c
thank	c
you	c
"	c
letter	c
.	c

I	c
particularly	c
liked	c
listening	c
their	i
musicians	c
when	c
they	c
played	c
the	c
piano	c
,	c
clarinet	c
,	c
drums	c
,	c
violen	i
etc.	i
Which	i
was	c
unbelievably	i
great	c
and	i
also	c
to	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
meet	c
these	c
famous	c
singers	c
made	c
me	c
realise	c
we	c
can	c
achieve	c
whatever	c
we	c
want	c
.	c

Dear	c
sir	c
,	c

Firstly	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
disappointed	c
in	i
finding	i
out	c
that	c
not-ever-heard	i
actors	c
were	c
playing	c
instead	c
of	c
the	c
ones	c
we	c
all	c
expected	c
.	c

Besides	c
this	c
,	c
no	c
discounts	c
for	c
students	c
were	c
available	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
very	c
sorry	c
to	c
let	c
you	c
know	c
that	c
not	c
only	c
was	c
the	c
show	c
really	c
boring	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
started	i
also	i
45	c
late	i
-	c
This	i
should	c
n't	c
happen	c
!	c

I	c
've	c
been	c
told	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
of	c
a	c
waiters	c
'	c
strike	c
.	c

This	c
show	c
might	c
be	c
the	c
newest	c
in	c
London	c
,	c
but	c
not	i
the	i
best	i
at	i
all	i
.	c

I	i
do	i
eventually	i
think	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
fair	c
to	c
give	c
the	c
spectators	i
their	c
money	c
back	c
-	c
So	i
ask	i
you	c
a	i
complete	c
refund	c
(	c
cash	c
)	c
of	c
the	c
ticket	c
price	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

We	c
all	c
know	c
that	c
she	c
is	c
n't	c
good	c
in	i
keeping	c
her	c
mouth	c
shut	c
at	c
all	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
should	c
have	c
been	c
better	c
this	c
time	c
.	c

Her	c
brother	c
Philip	c
had	c
just	c
passed	c
his	c
last	c
exam	c
at	c
the	c
university	c
and	c
was	c
going	c
to	c
graduate	c
in	c
a	c
few	c
days	c
.	c

This	c
should	c
be	i
a	c
big	c
surprise	c
for	c
him	c
:	c
the	c
car	c
was	c
bought	c
and	c
everything	c
was	c
prepared	c
in	c
a	c
very	c
hush-hush	c
atmosphere	c
.	c

Pat	c
promised	c
not	c
to	c
speak	c
to	c
anyone	c
about	c
the	c
car	c
,	c
but	c
one	c
evening	c
Philip	c
overhead	c
her	c
speaking	c
about	c
this	c
with	c
her	c
boyfriend	c
"	i
It	c
will	c
be	c
delievered	i
on	c
Thursday	c
!	c

The	c
car	c
was	c
already	c
parked	c
near	c
the	c
rear	c
door	c
and	c
there	c
was	c
an	c
unusual	c
activity	i
all	c
over	c
the	c
house	c
.	c

Everyone	c
seemed	c
to	c
be	c
looking	c
for	c
something	c
.	c

"	c
Are	c
you	c
looking	c
for	c
these	c
?	c
"	c
asked	c
Philip	c
showing	i
the	c
keys	c
of	i
the	c
car	c
.	c

And	c
disappeared	i
heading	i
for	c
the	c
rear	c
door	c
.	c

In	c
response	c
to	c
the	c
letter	c

I	c
am	c
sending	c
mine	c
to	c
state	c
the	c
options	i
and	i
choice	i
that	c
I	c

concerning	c
the	c

of	c
the	c

the	c
place	c
where	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
staying	c
and	c
the	c
two	c
activities	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
chosen	c
along	i
with	c
some	c
questions	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
to	i
the	c
question	c
of	c
lodging	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
chosen	c
tents	c

I	c
enjoy	c
camping	c
in	c
them	c
very	c
much	c

Hi	c
Kim	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
so	c
much	c
fun	c
helping	c
my	c
friends	c
'	c
band	c
having	i
their	c
concert	c
.	c

The	c
concert	c
was	c
a	c
hit	c
and	c
the	c
stage	c
looked	c
fabulous	c
!	c

The	c
audience	c
seemed	c
pretty	c
impressed	c
as	c
well	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
not	c
sure	c
of	i
what	c
part	c
you	c
're	c
interested	c
in	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
think	c
drawing	c
the	c
background	c
for	c
the	c
stage	c
was	c
the	c
best	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
suggest	c
that	c
you	c
try	c
doing	c
it	c
too	c
.	c

I	c
wish	c
you	c
the	c
best	c
of	c
luck	c
and	c
hope	c
you	c
have	c
fun	c
helping	c
the	c
singers	c
as	c
much	c
as	c
I	c
did	c

Lots	c
and	c
lots	c
of	c
kisses	c

Dear	c
sir	c
,	c

As	c
a	c
result	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
disappointing	c
performance	c
.	c

To	c
make	c
matters	c
worse	c
,	c
when	c
the	c
show	c
finished	c
we	c
could	c
n't	c
visit	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
fact	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
(	c
since	c
it	c
was	c
being	c
painted	c
)	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
surprised	c
that	c
such	c
a	c
reputable	c
theatre	c
like	c
yours	c
has	c
been	c
able	c
to	c
break	c
all	c
promises	i
that	c
appeared	i
in	c
the	c
advertisment	i
.	c

I	c
imagine	c
it	i
will	c
be	c
very	c
different	c
.	c

Sciencist	i
will	c
invented	i
new	c
materials	c
that	c
will	c
keep	c
the	c
temperature	i
in	c
a	c
suitable	c
range	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
these	c
new	c
material	i
wo	i
n't	i
weight	i
hardly	c
anything	c
.	c

As	i
well	i
,	c
people	c
wo	c
n't	c
be	c
as	c
worried	c
about	c
fashion	c
as	c
nowaday	i
,	c
however	c
it	i
will	c
be	c
very	c
important	c
that	c
clothes	c
are	c
comfortable	c
and	c
suitable	c
for	c
your	c
work	c
and	c
daily	c
duties	c
as	c
well	c
as	c
sport	c
or	i
everything	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
do	c
.	c

Of	c
course	c
,	c
the	c
resources	c
used	c
and	c
manufacturing	i
will	i
be	c
completely	c
harmless	c
for	c
the	c
enviroment	i
because	c
people	c
will	c
be	c
more	c
aware	c
of	c
the	c
neccesity	i
of	c
taking	c
care	c
of	c
the	c
world	c
we	c
live	c
in	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
modern	c
technology	c
change	i
my	c
daily	c
life	c
.	c

But	c
it	c
will	c
make	c
me	c
lazy	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
one	c
hand	c
technology	c
is	c
a	c
good	c
thing	c
seeing	c
that	c
we	c
've	c
got	c
more	c
and	c
more	c
possibilities	i
to	c
enjoy	c
ourselves	c
since	c
she	i
invents	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
products	c
.	c

But	c
on	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
technology	c
's	c
products	c
are	c
sometimes	c
cheap	i
and	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
afford	c
it	i
.	c

In	c
fact	c
,	c
I	c
like	c
technology	c
but	c
sometimes	c
I	c
wish	c
it	c
had	i
n't	i
existed	c
since	c
there	c
are	c
too	c
many	c
things	c
on	c
market	i
.	c

Indeed	c
,	c
when	c
you	c
want	c
to	c
buy	c
a	c
television	c
,	c
for	c
example	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
different	c

I	c
'm	c
bound	c
to	c
feel	c
nervous	i
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
:	c

The	c
first	c
problem	c
we	c
had	c
was	c
that	c
the	c
discounts	c
announced	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
were	c
not	c
available	c
and	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
pay	c
the	c
full	c
ticket	i
.	c

Another	c
problem	c
was	c
that	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
45	c
minutes	c
late	c
and	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
surprise	c
when	c
I	c
saw	c
that	c
the	c
main	c
character	c
was	c
not	c
played	c
by	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
who	c
is	c
one	c
of	c
my	c
favourite	c
actors	c
.	c

Finally	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
.	c

We	c
read	c
that	c
we	c
could	c
visit	c
it	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
the	c
waiters	c
were	c
on	c
strike	c
.	c

Fashion	c
news	c
are	i
followed	c
by	c
lots	c
of	c
people	c
.	c

We	c
want	c
to	c
know	c
what	c
we	c
will	c
have	c
to	c
wear	c
next	c
year	c
but	c
we	c
want	c
to	c
know	c
it	c
now	c
.	c

But	c
have	c
you	c
thought	c
about	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
we	c
will	c
wear	c
100	c
years	c
from	c
now	c
?	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
this	c
tendence	i
will	c
not	c
change	c
but	c
what	c
will	c
change	c
is	c
life	c
.	c

We	c
tend	c
to	c
a	i
society	c
that	c
wants	c
more	c
free	c
time	c
so	c
people	c
will	c
need	c
more	c
comfortable	c
clothes	c
to	c
enjoy	c
it	c
.	c

Scientists	c
are	c
looking	c
for	c
new	c
materials	c
that	c
will	c
made	i
our	c
clothes	c
more	c
comfortable	c
stronger	i
.	c

With	c
regard	c
to	c
your	c
International	c
Arts	c
Festival	c
advertisment	i
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
share	c
with	c
you	c
the	c
pleasure	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
be	c
part	c
of	c
the	c
event	c
and	c
some	i
suggestions	c
for	c
next	c
year	c
's	c
festival	c
that	c
you	c
might	c
take	c
in	i
consideration	c
.	c

The	c
International	c
Arts	c
Festival	c
is	c
a	c
beautiful	i
idea	c
.	c

In	c
your	c
advertisment	i
you	c
mentionned	i
that	c
there	c
is	i
artists	c
and	c
stars	c
from	i
all	i
around	i
the	i
world	i
coming	i
,	c
unfortunately	c
I	c
found	c
out	c
only	c
six	c
countries	c
were	c
represented	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
suggest	c
that	c
more	c
countries	c
should	c
be	c
part	c
of	c
the	c
Festival	i
if	c
it	c
is	c
possible	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
a	c
very	c
good	c
opportunity	c
to	c
listen	c
to	c
different	c
kind	i
of	c
music	c
and	c
to	c
discover	c
different	c
culture	i
.	c

Hoping	c
that	c
I	c
did	i
not	i
offend	i
you	c
in	c
any	c
ways	i
and	c
that	c
you	c
might	c
take	c
in	i
consideration	c
my	c
suggestion	i
,	c
I	c
wish	c
you	c
all	c
the	c
best	c
for	c
next	c
year	c
's	c
festival	c
organisation	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	i

It	c
's	c
a	c
story	c
of	c
a	c
special	c
person	c
who	c
was	c
born	c
in	c
my	c
country	c
and	c
who	c
is	c
now	c
known	c
worldwide	c
.	c

Only	c
the	c
one	i
who	c
knew	c
how	c
to	c
read	c
stars	c
could	c
actually	c
tell	c
that	c
a	c
great	c
king	c
was	i
born	c
.	c

When	c
the	c
three	c
men	c
saw	c
him	c
they	i
fell	c
on	c
their	c
knees	c
to	c
worship	c
him	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
musical	c
'	c
OVER	c
THE	c
RAINBOW	c
'	c
.	c

To	c
begin	c
with	c
,	c
according	c
to	c
your	c
advertisement	c
,	c
discount	c
tickets	c
were	i
availabe	i
.	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
could	c
not	c
get	c
them	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
modern	c
technology	c
has	c
changed	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
greatly	i
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
when	c
I	c
do	c
not	c
want	c
anybody	c
to	c
disturb	c
my	i
time	i
,	c
the	c
phone	c
annoys	c
me	c
.	c

Last	c
week	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
on	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
,	c
and	c
reading	i
the	c
advertisement	c
for	c
your	c
musical	c
show	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
planned	c
(	c
like	i
it	c
is	i
said	c
)	c
"	c
a	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
"	c
.	c

But	c
it	i
turned	c
out	c
,	c
it	c
really	c
was	c
n't	c
a	c
pleasant	c
evening	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
enjoy	c
myself	c
.	c

On	c
top	c
of	c
this	c
,	c
the	c
advertisement	c
was	c
n't	c
correct	i
at	c
all	c
,	c
or	c
I	c
must	c
have	c
been	c
to	c
the	c
wrong	c
show	c
!	c

According	c
to	c
the	c
advertisement	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
should	c
have	c
started	c
at	c
19.30	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
did	c
n't	c
begin	c
before	c
20.15	c
.	c

The	c
actors	c
were	c
not	c
the	c
ones	c
expected	c
:	c
there	c
was	c
no	c
sign	c
of	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
and	c
the	c
person	c
who	c
played	c
his	c
part	c
was	c
very	c
disappointing	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets.	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
found	c
out	c
afterwards	c
and	c
it	c
was	c
too	c
late	c
.	c

Pat	c
was	c
my	c
friend	c
,	c
I	c
trusted	c
her	c
and	c
we	c
got	c
on	c
very	c
well	c
untill	i
she	c
had	i
repeated	i
to	c
everyone	c
the	c
secret	c
I	c
had	c
told	c
her	c
.	c

There	c
was	c
only	c
one	c
thing	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
like	c
with	i
her	c
:	c
she	c
could	i
do	c
anything	c
to	c
have	c
friends	c
,	c
even	c
betray	c
me	c
.	c

No	c
one	c
knew	c
apart	c
from	c
me	c
and	c
my	c
mother	c
.	c

I	c
kept	c
lying	c
when	c
somebody	c
asked	c
where	c
my	c
dad	c
was	c
.	c

Since	c
everyone	c
knew	c
the	c
truth	c
,	c
things	c
were	c
n't	c
the	c
same	c
.	c

Everyone	c
,	c
even	c
my	c
friends	c
,	c
looked	c
at	c
me	c
in	c
a	c
strange	c
kind	c
of	c
way	c
.	c

What	c
did	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
do	c
with	c
this	c
?	c

I	c
knew	i
,	c
now	c
,	c
why	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
hide	c
the	c
truth	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
very	c
happy	c
to	c
have	c
won	c
in	i
your	c
competition	c
.	c

I	i
'm	i
never	i
going	i
in	i
the	c
U.S.A	c
than	i
I	c
'm	c
very	c
exciting	i
to	c
travel	i
at	i
Camp	c
California	c
.	c

As	i
accomodation	i
I	c
'd	c
prefer	c
to	c
sleep	c
in	c
tents	i
becaose	i
I	c
like	c
beeing	i
outside	c
and	c
earing	i
the	c
noises	c
of	c
the	c
sea	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
one	c
question	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
a	c
little	c
brother	c
and	c
I	c
want	c

I	c

My	c

that	c
I	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c

I	c
'm	c
sorry	c
that	c
I	c
've	c
taken	c
such	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
to	c
reply	c
your	i
letter	c
because	c
I	c
'm	c
really	c
busy	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
study	c
harder	c
.	c

Lucky	c
me	c
!	c

I	c
really	c
enjoyed	c
helping	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
know	c
,	c
I	c
'm	c
crazy	c
about	c
pop	c
music	c
.	c

Before	c
the	c
concert	c
I	c
was	c
really	c
exciting	i
.	c

I	c
could	c
n't	c
sleep	c
well	c
and	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
know	c
what	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
in	i
the	c
concert	c
.	c

There	c
were	c
lots	c
of	c
singers	c
and	c
band	i
.	c

First	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
in	c
front	c
of	c
the	c
entrance	c
door	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
to	c
check	c
tickets	c
.	c

After	c
that	c
,	c
I	c
went	c
to	i
the	i
back	c
stage	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
sorry	c
that	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
ask	c
them	i
to	i
take	i
any	i
pictures	i
for	c
you	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
to	c
take	c
care	c
of	c
them	c
and	c
did	c
everything	c
they	c
want	i
.	c

For	c
instance	c
,	c
taking	c
them	c
to	c
toilet	i
,	c
making	c
coffee	c
for	c
them	c
,	c
helping	c
them	c
find	c
their	c
stuff	c
.	c

I	c
learnt	c
lots	c
of	c
thing	c
from	i
here	i
that	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
learn	c
from	c
school	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
to	c
be	c
more	c
patient	c
.	c

I	c
knew	i
lots	c
of	c
people	c
from	i
different	c
job	i
.	c

It	i
was	i
a	c
great	c
time	c
.	c

Take	c
care	c
of	c
yourself	c
and	c
I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Best	c
wishes	c
,	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
,	c

But	c
nevertheless	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
your	c
show	c
.	c

The	c
show	c
started	c
t	i
20.15	c
instead	c
of	c
19.30	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
to	c
wait	c
in	c
overcrowded	i
hall	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
you	c
could	c
understand	c
how	c
disappointed	c
I	c
was	c
.	c

In	c
fact	c
there	c
were	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
mistakes	c
in	c
your	c
advertisment	i
and	c
I	c
would	c
be	c
gratefull	i
if	c
you	c
could	c
give	c
me	c
back	c
a	c
part	c
of	c
my	c
money	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
at	c
present	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
technologies	c
are	c
computer	c
and	c
Internet	i
technologies	c
.	c

Both	c
computer	i
and	c
Internet	i
influence	c
people	c
's	c
life	i
.	c

Dear	c
Jane	c
Clark	c

Hello	c
!	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
appreicate	i
you	c
for	c
organizing	c
such	c
an	c
exciting	c
festival	c
.	c

By	c
the	c
way	c
,	c
according	c
to	c
the	c
advertisement	c
,	c
lots	c
of	c
stars	c
and	c
artists	c
from	c
around	c
the	c
world	c
were	c
supposed	c
to	c
be	c
invited	c
for	c
the	c
festival	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
was	c
able	c
to	c
meet	c
them	c
just	i
from	c
only	c
six	c
countries	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
'll	c
get	c
much	c
bigger	c
concerts	i
hall	i
next	c
year	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
mention	c
reasonably-priced	i
weekend	c
ticket	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
brillient	c
,	c
because	c
if	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
pay	c
all	i
things	c
each	i
I	c
would	c
n't	c
have	c
attended	c
it	c
,	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
very	c
expensive	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
helpful	c
and	c
useful	c
for	c
you	c
.	c

Faithfully	c
yours	c

Long	i
time	c
ago	c
,	c
there	c
were	c
two	c
brothers	c
,	c
whose	c
parents	c
were	c
dead	c
.	c

By	c
the	c
way	c
,	c
the	c
elder	c
brother	c
,	c
Nolbu	c
was	c
a	c
so	i
greedy	c
man	c
.	c

Hungbu	c
had	c
nothing	c
but	c
his	c
twelve	i
family	i
.	c

But	c
,	c
Nolbu	c
always	c
made	c
people	c
annoyed	c
,	c
and	c
enjoyed	c
other	c
people	c
's	c
misfortune	c
.	c

This	c
story	c
happened	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
ago	c
.	c

My	c
name	c
is	c
Molly	c
Menbrook	c
.	c

But	c
the	c
time	c
was	c
n't	c
kept	c
.	c

So	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
keep	c
myself	c
occupied	c
for	c
a	c
while	c
,	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
restaurant	c
except	i
it	c
was	c
n't	c
open	c
.	c

No	c
one	c
.	c

The	c
show	c
it	i
self	i
was	c
quite	c
disappointing	c
.	c

Anyway	c
,	c
after	c
watching	c
the	c
musical	c
,	c
I	c
felt	c
a	c
bit	c
peckish	c
so	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
restaurant	c
again	c
with	c
hope	i
that	c
it	c
might	c
be	c
open	c
,	c
but	c
still	c
,	c
nobody	c
was	c
in	c
.	c

They	c
had	c
been	c
closed	c
for	c
3	c
days	c
according	c
to	c
him	c
.	c

So	c
you	c
see	c
my	c
point	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
am	c
going	c
to	c
ask	c
for	c
a	c
refund	c
...	c

Reply	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c
,	c

I	c
think	c
the	c
clothes	c
in	c
future	c
will	c
be	c
similar	c
in	c
shape	c
as	c
the	c
clothes	c
that	c
exist	c
now	c
.	c

Just	c
like	c
sweaters	c
,	c
shoes	c
,	c
t-shirts	c
etc	c
...	c

When	c
it	c
comes	c
down	c
to	c
color	i
,	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
'll	c
be	c
much	c
brighter	c
and	c
maybe	c
glittery	c
.	c

Maybe	c

as	c

and	c
green	c

All	c
suitable	c
for	c

I	c
think	c
they	c
'll	c
be	c
based	c
on	c
some	c
kind	c
of	c
space	c

I	c
'll	c

baseball	c

They	c
'll	c

I	c
mean	c

I	c
wo	c
n't	c
get	c

Though	c
some	c
people	c
may	c
fancy	c
the	c
glitter	c

the	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c

it	c

I	c
hope	c
it	c
really	c
is	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Ryan	c
,	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
I	i
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
the	i
perfect	i
organisation	i
of	i
the	c
competition	c
which	c
I	c
luckely	i
won	c
,	i
I	c
have	c
been	c
really	c
very	c
impressed	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
I	c
became	i
your	c
letter	c
with	i
two	c
weeks	c
late	c
so	c
I	c
can	c
travel	c
only	c
between	c
the	c
5th	c
and	c
the	c
20th	c
July	c
.	c

So	c
stay	i
in	c
a	c
log	i
cabins	i
will	c
probably	c
evite	i
me	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
problems	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
your	c
attencion	i
on	i
my	i
regard	i

Your	i
sincerely	c

The	c
verb	c
"	c
have	c
"	c
is	c
probably	c
the	c
most	c
used	c
and	c
loved	c
by	c
the	c
human	c
species	c
.	c

We	c
are	c
always	c
trying	c
to	c
have	c
more	c
things	c
,	c
that	i
in	i
spite	i
of	i
care	i
after	i
us	i
family	c
,	c
us	i
future	c
,	c
or	i
other	c
things	c
which	c
are	c
probably	c
more	c
important	c
than	c
a	c
new	c
perfum	i
.	c

Maybe	c
you	c
can	i
think	c
I	c
am	c
excessive	i
but	c
recent	c
studies	c
prouves	i
that	c
this	c
mania	c
can	c
be	c
really	c
dangerous	c
.	c

Certenly	i
the	i
only	i
fact	i
of	i
have	i
something	c
can	c
helps	i
people	c
to	c
be	c
more	c
sure	c
of	c
himself	i
.	c

Probably	c
when	c
Oscar	c
Wilde	c
said	c
:	c
"	c
Superficiality	c
is	c
the	c
suprem	i
vice	c
"	c
he	c
was	c
right	c
.	c

We	c
still	c
look	c
at	c
what	c
people	c
look	c
like	c
and	c
not	c
at	c
what	c
they	c
really	c
are	c
.	c

It	c
started	c
at	c
20.15	c
.	c

I	c
got	c
bored	c
.	c

Not	c
only	c
me	c
but	c
also	c
the	c
others	c
got	c
bored	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
wrote	i
in	c
the	c
newspaper	c
that	c
Danny	c
Brock	c
took	i
place	i
in	c
the	c
play	c
.	c

If	c
there	c
had	c
been	c
a	c
problem	c
,	c
it	i
would	i
have	i
been	i
told	i
us	i
.	c

I	c
wanted	c
to	c
see	c
him	c
but	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
see	c
.	i

But	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
without	c
any	c
reason	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
would	i
not	i
continue	i
like	c
this	c
.	c

TECHNOLOGICAL	c
ADVANTAGES	c

Technology	c
is	c
the	c
thing	c
that	c
makes	c
our	c
life	c
easy	c
.	c

But	c
if	c
they	c
were	c
n't	c
made	c
,	c
we	c
would	c
have	c
to	c
walk	c
or	c
go	c
by	c
a	i
horse	c
or	c
donkey	c
.	c

With	c
the	c
help	c
of	c
technology	c
,	c
we	c
do	c
our	c
works	i
in	c
less	c
time	c
.	c

But	c
now	c
we	c
use	c
planes	c
to	c
go	c
far	i
places	i
.	c

Not	c
only	c
as	c
a	c
hobby	c
.	c

They	c
write	c
their	c
secret	c
notes	c
into	i
the	i
computers	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
;	i
wars	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
bad	c
for	c
the	i
world	i
's	i
piece	i
.	c

I	c
think	c
we	c
should	c
use	c
the	i
technology	c
for	c
the	i
piece	i
and	c
use	c
it	c
for	c
our	c
fortune	i
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
have	c
the	c
two	c
tickets	c
refunded	c
considering	i
also	c
that	c
there	c
were	c
no	c
discounts	c
available	c
,	c
as	i
instead	i
it	i
was	c
stated	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
.	c

Yours	c
Faithfully	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
actually	c
say	c
that	c
if	c
it	c
had	c
n't	c
been	c
for	c
Mr.	c
White	c
she	c
would	c
have	i
never	i
passed	c
her	c
exam	c
to	c
enter	c
University	c
.	c

Mr	c
White	c
came	c
to	c
our	c
school	c
when	c
he	c
was	c
40	c
year-old	i
but	c
still	c
well-looking	i
and	c
all	c
my	c
girls	i
school-mates	c
fell	c
suddenly	c
in	c
love	c
with	c
him	c
;	c
he	c
was	c
always	c
so	c
kind	c
and	c
generous	c
towards	c
his	c
pupils	c
that	c
any	c
girls	i
felt	c
herself	c
loved	c
by	c
him	c
:	c
Pat	c
certainly	c
was	c
one	c
of	c
them	c
.	c

She	c
was	c
so	c
angry	c
and	c
felt	c
so	c
betrayed	c
by	c
Mr	c
White	c
that	c
without	c
any	c
exitation	i
she	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
school	c
Headmaster	c
to	c
report	c
everything	c
she	c
had	c
seen	c
.	c

The	c
next	c
day	c
Mr	c
White	c
was	c
charged	c
for	i
abuses	i
and	c
obliged	c
to	c
resign	c
.	c

Competition	c
Organiser	c

Dear	c
Sir	c

However	c
there	c
are	c
some	c
problems	c
that	c
I	c
hope	c
to	c
solve	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
the	c
only	c
suitable	c
time	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
go	c
is	c
July	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
the	c
only	c
time	c
when	c
I	c
am	c
free	c
from	c
my	c
duties	c
-	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
doctor	c
so	c
you	c
see	c
that	c
I	c
can	i
not	i
let	c
my	c
patients	c
down	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
chance	c
to	c
practice	i
both	c
of	c
theme	i
at	c
'	c
Camp	c
California	c
'	c
.	c

The	c
question	c
is	c
:	c
Do	c
I	c
need	c
some	c
extra	c
money	c
and	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
should	c
I	c
take	c
for	c
this	c
trip	c
?	c

Unconected	i
part	i
of	i
every	i
people	i
lifes	i
is	i
shopping	i
.	i

We	c
buy	c
everything	c
from	c
clothes	c
to	c
food	c
and	c
the	c
only	c
thing	c
that	c
could	c
stop	c
us	c
from	c
this	c
are	i
money	c
.	c

As	c
a	c
teenager	c
I	c
must	c
addmit	i
that	c
there	c
is	c
nothing	c
more	c
enjoyable	c
from	i
shopping	c
.	c

Choosing	c
gave	i
me	c
such	c
big	i
pleasure	c
because	c
I	c
never	c
have	c
to	c
worry	c
from	i
vere	i
do	i
I	c
take	i
money	c
for	c
my	c
wishes	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
,,having	c
is	c
a	c
dream	c
''	c
of	i
all	c
of	c
us	c
.	c

Another	c
situation	c
is	c
when	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
buy	c
somebody	c
a	c
present	c
.	c

Everybody	c
know	i
that	c
,,present	c
presents	c
a	c
problem	c
''	c
You	c
know	c
your	c
own	c
task	i
but	c
what	c
vith	i
a	i
task	i
of	c
the	c
other	c
person	c
?	c

However	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
agree	c
with	c
opinion	i
that	c
,,Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
''	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
everybody	c
like	i
to	c
buy	c
but	c
not	c
everybody	c
like	i
to	c
see	i
pleasure	c
in	c
it	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs/Ms	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

My	c
name	c
is	c
Manuel	c
P.	c
Martinez	c
and	c
I	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
rather	c
than	c
in	c
tents	i
,	c
because	c
I	c
find	c
it	c
more	c
confortable	i
to	c
sleep	c
in	c
beds	i
,	c
but	c
it	c
would	c
n't	c
be	c
a	c
problem	c
if	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
sleep	c
in	c
tents	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
love	c
to	c
do	c
climbing	c
and	c
surfing	c
just	c
because	c
those	c
are	c
sports	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
praticed	i
before	c
,	i
that	i
means	c
I	c
do	c
not	c
have	c
any	c
experience	c
on	i
the	i
subject	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c

from	c
you	c

June	c
13th	c
,	c
2000	c
Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c
As	c
you	c
already	c
know	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
last	c
month	c
.	c

My	c
job	c
was	c
to	c
set	c
the	i
stage	c
where	c
the	c
bands	c
played	c
.	c

The	c
part	c
that	c
I	c
enjoyed	c
the	c
most	c
was	c
that	c
I	c
felt	c
I	c
was	c
doing	c
something	c
worthly	i
for	c
the	c
community	c
and	c
also	c
that	c
I	c
got	c
to	c
meet	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
people	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
so	c
happy	c
to	c
win	c
the	c
prize	c
and	c
come	i
true	i
my	c
dream	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
never	c
used	c
it	i
and	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
more	c
exciting	c
than	c
tents	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
heard	c
that	c
the	i
Camp	c
California	c
is	c
famous	c
for	c
surfing	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
hope	c
that	c
I	c
will	c
enjoy	c
surfing	c
for	c
the	c
first	c
time	c
.	c

Besides	c
,	c
I	c
will	c
take	c
the	c
chance	i
to	c
play	c
golf	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
my	c
only	c
favorite	i
hobby	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
what	c
the	c
weather	c
is	c
like	c
,	c
and	c
you	c
are	c
paid	c
for	c
travel	c
costs	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
am	c
wondering	c
that	i
it	c
is	i
included	i
two	c
activities	c
.	c

Dear	c
Kim	c

Also	c
,	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
I	i
'll	i
want	i
to	c
be	c
an	c
organizer	c
like	c
this	i
concert	c
,	c
so	c
it	c
'll	c
be	c
useful	c
the	i
experience	c
to	i
me	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
applied	c
to	c
a	c
concert	c
agency	c
to	c
help	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
had	c
the	c
experience	c
before	c
and	c
I	c
knew	c
how	c
to	c
organize	c
and	c
what	c
to	c
do	c
.	c

In	i
the	c
pop	c
concert	c
,	c
there	c
were	c
many	c
people	c
,	c
so	c
before	c
starting	c
the	c
pop	c
concert	c
,	c
I	c
arranged	c
the	c
seats	c
and	c
carried	c
some	c
musical	c
instruments	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
somewhat	c
hard	c
to	i
me	c
.	c

After	c
the	c
concert	c
,	c
I	c
cleaned	c
all	c
the	c
ground	c
with	c
other	c
helpers	c
and	c
we	c
moved	c
the	c
seats	c
again	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Ryan	c
,	c

On	i
August	c
I	c
am	c
going	c
to	c
apply	c
for	c
a	c
new	c
job	c
.	c

Also	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
rather	c
than	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
be	c
most	c
greatful	i
if	c
you	c
could	c
let	c
me	c
know	i
some	c
information	c
:	c

-	c
What	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
would	c
you	c
recommend	c
me	c
to	i
bring	i
with	c
me	c
?	c

Introduction:-	c

The	c
aim	c
of	c
this	c
report	c
is	c
to	c
summarize	c
the	c
pupil	c
's	c
attituds	i
about	i
video	i
they	c
have	c
to	c
be	i
made	i
and	c
to	c
suggest	c
which	c
lessons	c
and	c
other	c
activities	c
should	c
be	c
filmed	c
.	c

The	c
report	c
is	c
based	c
on	c
opinion	i
of	c
more	c
than	c
300	c
pupils	c
.	c

What	c
would	c
the	c
pupils	c
prefer	c
to	c
film	c
?	c

According	c
to	c
the	c
answer	i
there	i
are	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
activities	c
pupils	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
film	c
(	c
80	c
per	c
cent	c
of	c
those	c
questioned	c
)	i

-	c
lessons	c
in	c

-	c
pupils	i

London	c
,	c

Conclusion	c
:	c
It	c
is	c
clear	c
,	i
that	c
the	c
filming	i
of	c
video	i
is	c
very	i
important	c
event	c
for	c
children	i

prefer	c
to	c
film	c
only	c
positive	i
events	c
of	c
their	c
life	c
at	c
school	c
as	i
I	c
have	c
written	c
above	c

booked	c
this	c
month	c
as	c
a	c

Besides	i
,	i
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c

since	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
had	c
the	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
helped	c
selling	c
tickets	c
and	c
drinks	c
and	c
there	c
I	c
realized	c
how	c
bad	c
my	c
maths	c
is	c
-	c
I	c
took	c
such	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
to	c
give	c
back	c
the	c
change	c
!	c

Before	c
the	c
performance	c
I	c
introduced	i
the	c
spectators	c
to	c
their	c
seats	c
and	c
then	c
a	i
instructor	c
showed	c
me	c
how	c
to	i
lead	i
the	c
spotlights	c
.	c

But	c
the	c
cherry	c
on	c
the	c
cake	c
was	c
that	c
I	c
met	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
handsome	c
singers	c
back	i
stage	i
!	c

He	c
asked	c
me	c
what	c
I	c
was	c
doing	c
and	c
so	c
on	c
and	c
finally	c
invited	c
me	c
for	i
his	c
next	c
concert	c
!	c

Of	c
course	c
I	c
agreed	c
-	c
I	c
would	c
n't	c
want	c
to	c
miss	c
the	c
chance	c
to	c
gain	c
experience	c
while	c
having	c
fun	c
!	c

Perhaps	c
I	c
could	c
help	c
regularly	c
in	c
the	c
lightening	i
area	c
-	c
it	c
would	c
help	c
me	c
for	i
my	c
studies	i
of	i
photography	i
.	c

I	c
can	c
hardly	c
await	i
your	c
reply	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

If	c
I	c
had	c
known	c
that	c
I	c
won	i
,	c
I	c
would	c
not	c
have	c
arranged	c
my	c
english	i
course	c
in	c
Britain	c
.	c

The	c
next	c
point	c
is	c
the	c
accommodation	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
staying	c
in	c
tents	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
close	c
to	c
the	i
nature	c
,	c
so	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
a	c
pleasure	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
interested	c
in	c
tennis	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
am	c
also	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
photography	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
even	c
won	c
competion	i
once	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Generally	c
,	c
most	c
people	c
like	c
shopping	c
,	c
but	c
there	c
are	c
some	c
advantages	c
and	c
disadvantages	c
.	c

When	c
discribing	i
the	c
advantages	c
,	c
we	c
should	c
remember	c
that	c
most	c
people	c
like	c
doing	c
shopping	c
.	c

Next	c
,	c
it	c
can	c
be	c
very	c
good	c
for	c
your	c
wallet	c
to	c
save	c
some	c
money	c
,	c
when	c
you	c
will	i
find	c
a	c
bargain	c
or	c
sales	c
.	c

As	c
well	c
as	c
that	c
,	c
some	c
shop-assistance	i
can	c
give	c
you	c
a	c
lower	c
price	c
,	c
because	c
you	c
always	c
do	c
shopping	c
at	c
their	c
shop	c
.	c

such	c
as	c
playing	c
sports	c
or	c
reading	c
a	c
book	c
.	c

Very	c
often	c
people	c
go	c
to	c
a	c
shop	c
-	c
usually	c
a	c
big	c
departament	i
store	c
and	c
buy	c
things	c
which	c
they	c
do	c
not	c
need	c
.	c

On	c
balance	c
some	c
people	c
still	c
like	c
shopping	c
even	c
if	c
it	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
and	c
they	c
have	c
to	c
stand	c
in	c
a	c
long	c
queue	c
to	c
buy	c
something	c
.	c

From	c
my	c
point	c
of	c
view	c
it	c
depands	i
on	c
us	c
if	i
shopping	c
will	c
be	c
enjoyable	c
or	c
not	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Ryan	c
,	c

First	c
,	c
you	c
asked	c
abut	i
the	i
travel	i
time	i
and	c
the	c
only	c
possible	c
time	c
for	c
me	c
is	c
in	c
July	c
,	c
because	c
my	c
company	c
only	c
gave	c
me	c
holidays	i
in	i
this	c
period	c
.	c

I	c
want	c
to	c
feel	c
the	c
real	c
nature	c
and	c
spirit	c
of	c
Camp	c
California	c
.	c

Further	i
more	i
,	c
I	c
should	c
choose	c
between	c
two	c
activities	c
and	c
how	i
good	c
I	c
am	c
at	c
each	c
one	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

I	c
can	c
say	c
that	c
this	c
was	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
best	c
experiences	c
of	c
my	c
life	c
.	c

Different	c
"	c
stars	c
"	c
gave	c
me	c
signatures	i
and	c
talk	i
really	c
nice	i
and	c
normal	i
with	c
me	c
.	c

The	c
after	i
show	i
dinner	c
party	c
was	c
very	c
nice	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
thought	c
that	c
popular	i
people	i
like	c
Elton	c
John	c
dances	i
on	c
the	c
table	c
if	c
he	i
likes	i
the	c
music	c
and	c
if	c
he	i
have	c
made	i
a	c
great	c
show	c
on	c
stage	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
just	c
great	c
and	c
after	c
this	c
event	c
I	c
can	c
say	c
that	c
popular	i
people	i
are	c
normal	c
humans	c
like	c
everyone	c

Love	c

My	c
name	c
is	c
Manu	c
Roddos	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
somethings	i
that	c
happened	c
in	i
the	c
performance	c
of	c
the	c
show	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
,	c
wich	i
took	c
place	c
in	c
your	c
stablishment	i
,	c
The	c
Circle	c
Theater	i
,	c
that	i
made	c
me	c
feel	c
very	c
upset	c
.	c

After	c
that	c
,	c
I	c
became	c
even	c
more	c
angry	c
because	c
,	c
as	c
far	c
as	c
I	c
concerne	i
,	c
the	c
show	c
must	c
begin	c
on	c
time	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
started	c
forty	i
five	i
minutes	c
late	c

Yours	c
Sincerelly	i
,	c

In	i
our	i
days	i
,	c
technology	c
has	c
become	c
a	c
very	c
common	c
thing	c
,	c
even	c
among	c
children	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
such	c
an	c
evolution	c
for	c
human	i
race	c
,	c
however	c
we	i
can	i
not	i
forget	c
that	c
it	c
can	c
cause	c
some	c
problems	c
too	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
the	c
great	c
boom	c
of	i
massive	i
comunication	i
wich	i
happened	c
in	i
the	c
beginning	c
of	c
our	c
decade	c
,	c
with	c
the	c
devellopment	i
of	c
telephones	c
,	c
radio	c
stations	c
,	c
television	c
and	c
even	c
satelites	i
,	c
and	c
of	c
course	c
,	c
the	c
internet	i
,	c
gave	c
common	i
people	c
the	c
chance	c
to	c
take	c
off	c
on	c
a	c
trip	c
all	c
over	c
the	c
world	c
,	c
and	c
this	c
provided	i
health	c
and	c
education	c
researches	i
to	c
increase	c
as	c
well	c
.	c

In	i
the	i
other	i
hand	i
,	c
technology	c
has	c
made	i
the	c
differences	c
between	c
-	i
poor	c
and	c
rich	c
people	c
to	c
grow	i
at	i
a	i
high	i
level	i
,	c
and	c
this	c
is	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
biggest	c
causes	c
of	c
violence	c
in	c
all	c
countries	c
.	c

Thanks	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
,	i
I	c
am	c
so	c
glad	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
.	c

And	c
thanks	c
again	c
for	c
offer	i
me	c
two	c
weeks	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
in	c
the	c
U.S.A	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
asked	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
only	c
in	c
July	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
quite	c
busy	c
with	c
my	c
job	c
.	c

July	c
is	c
the	c
only	c
free	c
time	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
.	c

And	c
I	c
prefer	c
tents	c
to	c
log	c
cabins	c
,	c
as	c
I	c
know	c
tents	c
better	c
than	c
log	c
cabins	c
.	c

I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
have	i
climbing	c
and	c
sailing	c
.	c

Actually	c
I	c
am	c
quite	c
good	c
at	c
climbing	c
.	c

How	c
much	c
do	c
you	c
think	c
that	c
I	c
will	c
need	c
.	i

By	c
the	c
way	c
what	i
kinds	c
of	c
clothes	c
do	c
you	c
think	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
get	i
with	c
me	c
?	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

I	c
think	c
most	c
people	c
will	c
agree	c
with	i
"	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
"	c
.	c

Because	c
so	c
far	c
as	c
I	c
know	c
nothing	c
is	c
enjoyable	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
.	c

Yes	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
true	c
,	i
this	i
is	c
only	c
because	c
nowadays	c
people	c
have	c
more	c
money	c
than	c
even	i
before	c
,	c
and	c
some	c
women	c
do	c
n't	c
earn	c
money	c
,	i
they	i
have	c
no	c
idea	c
how	c
diffcult	i
to	i
earn	c
the	i
money	c
.	c

For	i
me	c
,	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
think	c
shopping	c
is	c
enjoyable	c
at	c
all	c
.	c

Shopping	c
is	c
just	c
like	c
a	c
nightmare	c
to	c
me	c
,	i
I	c
think	c
I	c
will	c
never	c
understand	c
why	c
people	c
love	c
shopping	c
.	c

Those	c
are	c
only	c
my	c
opinions	c
,	i
you	i
do	c
n't	c
need	c
to	c
agree	c
with	c
it	i
,	c
but	c
one	c
day	c
you	c
might	c
found	i
out	c
that	c
what	c
I	c
have	c
said	c
is	c
not	c
totally	c
wrong	c
.	c

Dear	c
Jane	c
Clark	c
,	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
great	c
idea	c
and	c
I	c
had	c
the	c
pleasure	c
of	c
resting	c
and	c
relaxing	c
,	c
plus	c
of	c
getting	i
some	c
important	c
knowledge	c
from	c
it	c
.	c

Stars	i
and	c
artists	c
wee	i
only	i
from	i
six	c
countries	c

Some	c
concert	c
halls	c
were	c
too	c
small	c
.	c

So	c
it	c
was	c
impossible	c
to	c
get	c
tickets	c
there	c
.	c

It	c
would	c
be	c
wonderful	c
to	c
buy	c
some	c
books	c
or	c
programms	i
with	c
signatures	i
of	c
all	c
the	c
stars	c
and	c
artists	c
taking	c
part	c
in	c
the	c
festival	c
.	c

Also	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
dance	i
shows	c
should	c
include	c
different	c
styles	c
of	c
dancing	c
(	c
e.g.	c
national	i
dancing	i
of	c
all	c
the	c
countries	c
)	c
to	c
impress	c
audience	i
and	c
not	i
to	i
bore	i
with	i
the	i
similar	i
scenes	i
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	i

Hello	c
Philip	c

In	c
our	c
school	c
we	c
have	c
the	c
following	c
rules	c

which	i

I	c
do	c

Truely	i
speaking	c
I	c
am	c
not	c
sure	c
about	c
home	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
in	c
our	c
family	c
everything	c
is	c
based	c
on	c
mutual	c
understanding	c

We	c
do	c

I	c

in	c

and	c
the	c
weather	c
shall	i
be	c
really	c
nice	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c

so	c
than	i
we	c
can	c
have	c
a	c
nice	c
time	c
at	c

and	c
find	c
many	c
interesting	c
games	c
to	c
play	c
in	i
.	c

Despite	c
the	i
small	i
expereance	i
in	c

I	c
do	c
want	c
to	c
try	c
this	c
type	c
of	c

Dear	c
Ms	c
Jane	i
Clark	c

As	c
a	c
matter	c
of	c
fact	c
,	c
I	c
consider	c
one	c
reasonably-priced	c
weekend	c
ticket	c
for	c
all	c
events	c
to	c
be	c
brilliant	c
as	c
it	c
offers	c
a	c
unique	c
opportunity	c
to	c
pay	c
for	c
everything	c
all	c
together	c
and	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
attend	c
different	c
events	c

Wuthering	c
Heights	c
-	c
Emily	c
Brontë	c

For	i
a	i
start	i
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
books	c
offer	c
us	c
a	c
wide	c
range	c
of	c
different	c
life	c
stories	c
,	c
both	c
realistic	c
and	c
unusual	c
,	c
they	c
make	c
us	c
thoughtful	c
and	c
form	c
our	c
outlook	c
,	c
they	i
make	c
us	c
feel	c
and	c
think	c
.	c

Stories	c
that	c
are	c
realistic	c
help	c
us	c
to	c
understand	c
better	i
our	i
own	i
life	i
and	i
people	i
around	i
us	i
.	c

However	c
,	c
reading	c
an	c
unusual	c
,	c
sometimes	c
fantastic	i
story	c
we	c
could	c
dream	c
about	c
fairy	c
lands	c
and	c
observe	c
our	c
world	c
from	c
another	c
point	c
of	c
view	c
.	c

I	c
consider	c
"	c
Wuthering	c
Heights	c
"	c
by	c
Emily	c
Brontë	c
to	c
be	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
books	c
that	c
wash	c
away	c
from	c
the	c
soul	c
the	c
dust	c
of	c
everyday	i
's	i

It	c
contributes	c
to	c
the	c
world	i
treasurehouse	i
of	c
literature	c
and	c
arouses	c
irresistable	i
fascination	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

Then	c
you	c
ask	c
me	c
which	c
two	c
activities	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
choose	c
.	c

To	c
tell	c
you	c
the	c
truth	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
do	c
swimming	c
and	c
singing	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
good	c
in	i
both	c
of	c
these	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
ask	i
you	c
about	c
the	c
weather	c
.	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

how	c
are	c
you	c
?	c

Thanks	c
for	c
you	i
letter	c
.	c

The	c
group	c
which	c
was	c
singing	c
was	c
very	c
famous	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
able	c
to	c
meet	c
them	c
and	c
to	c
chat	c
about	c
their	c
plans	c
for	c
the	c
future	c
.	c

But	c
the	c
thing	c
I	c
particularly	c
liked	c
about	c
my	c
experience	c
,	i
was	c
the	c
feeling	c
when	c
you	c
are	c
near	c
and	c
when	c
you	c
talk	c
with	c
the	i
people	i
so	i
famous	i
.	c

That	c
's	c
all	c
for	c
now	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
waiting	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

See	c
you	c
soon	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
've	c
just	c
received	c
your	c
letter	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
very	i
delighted	c
to	c
be	c
the	c
winner	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
have	c
informed	c
me	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
activities	c
that	c
we	c
can	c
do	c
.	c

The	i
swimming	i
is	c
my	c
best	i
sport	c
.	c

The	c
sea	c
is	c
part	c
of	c
myself	i
.	c

Furthermore	c
I	c
will	c
have	c
the	c
opportunity	c
to	c
play	c
basketball	c
,	c
despite	c
the	c
fact	c
that	c
I	c
am	c
not	c
too	i
tall	c
for	c
this	c
kind	c
of	c
sport	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
would	c
you	c
mind	c
to	i
send	i
me	c
more	c
information	c
about	c
the	c
amount	c
of	c
money	c
that	c
I	c
should	c
have	i
.	c

Also	c
,	c
what	c
about	c
the	c
life	i
out	i
of	c
the	c
camp	c
?	c

Could	c
you	c
send	c
me	c
some	c
brochures	c
for	c
the	c
place	c
where	c
we	c
will	c
stay	c
in	i
?	c

The	c
aim	c
of	c
this	c
report	c
is	c
to	c
give	c
some	c
suggestions	c
about	c
the	c
short	c
video	c
which	c
my	c
college	c
is	c
going	c
to	c
make	c
about	c
the	c
daily	c
life	c
of	c
our	c
school	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
of	c
the	c
opinion	c
that	c
the	c
morning	c
English	c
lessons	c
with	c
our	c
teacher	c
George	i
are	i
worth	c
filming	c
and	c
showing	c
for	c
many	c
reasons	c
.	c

Above	c
all	c
,	c
they	c
are	c
enjoyable	c
and	c
interesting	c
.	c

All	c
of	c
us	c
participate	c
effectively	i
.	c

Nobody	c
is	c
yawning	c
or	c
feeling	c
bored	c
.	c

I	c
want	i
this	i
opinion	i
wo	i
n't	i
imply	i
that	c
the	c
other	c
lessons	c
of	c
other	c
teachers	c
are	c
n't	c
interesting	c
.	c

There	c
are	c
many	c
activities	c
that	c
they	i
could	c
be	c
filmed	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
clean	c
,	c
neat	c
and	c
tidy	c
with	c
helpful	c
staff	c
.	c

The	c
gym	c
is	c
good	i
choice	c
for	c
filming	c
with	c
the	c
sophisticated	c
equipments	i
that	c
owns	i
.	c

Books	c
of	i
various	c
interest	i
,	c
with	c
up-to-date	c
facilities	c
such	c
as	c
computers	c
internet	i
,	c
CD	i
and	c
cassettes	c
.	c

We	c
should	c
n't	c
disregard	i
and	c
neglect	c
to	c
film	c
the	c
buildings	c
and	c
the	c
gardens	c
of	c
our	c
beautiful	c
college	c
,	c
especially	c
when	i
we	c
take	c
into	c
our	i
consideration	c
the	c
fact	c
that	c
it	c
is	c
in	c
the	c
city	c
of	c
Shakespear	i
.	c

It	c
will	c
be	c
a	i
good	c
advertising	c
,	c
and	c
will	c
help	c
to	c
make	c
the	c
reputation	c
of	c
our	c
college	c
even	c
more	i
better	c
.	c

To	c
Whom	c
It	c
May	c
Concern	c
,	c

For	c
the	c
camp	c
,	c
you	c
need	c
some	c
information	c
from	c
me	c
,	c
do	c
n't	c
you	c
?	c

First	c
,	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
on	i
July	c
because	c
my	c
friend	c
,	c
who	c
is	c
French	c
,	c
is	c
coming	c
to	c
Toronto	c
on	i
August	c
.	c

Second	c
,	c
I	c
prefer	c
log	c
cabins	c
than	i
tents	c
.	c

The	c
reason	c
is	c
that	c
the	c
camp	c
will	c
be	c
two	c
weeks	c
and	c
log	c
cabins	c
are	c
more	c
comfortable	c
than	c
tents	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
if	c
the	c
log	c
cabins	c
are	c
not	c
available	c
at	c
the	c
moment	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
stay	c
in	c
the	c
tents	c
.	c

And	c
I	c
always	c
wanted	c
to	c
learn	c
how	c
to	c
paint	c
.	c

And	c
if	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
bring	c
some	c
money	c
could	c
you	c
suggest	c
me	i
the	c
amount	c
?	c

Also	c
,	c
could	c
you	c
suggest	c
me	i
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
should	c
bring	c
,	c
please	c
?	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
reading	c
this	c
letter	c
.	c

Truly	c
,	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

How	c
are	c
you	c
?	c

I	c
'm	c
fine	c
,	c
thanks	c
.	c

Anyway	c
,	c
I	c
really	c
enjoyed	c
helpying	i
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
last	c
month	c
so	c
that	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
write	c
them	i
down	i
!	c

After	c
working	c
30	c
minute	i
,	c
a	c
singer	c
appeared	c
.	c

We	c
could	c
listen	c
for	c
free	c
!	c

I	c
just	c
imagined	c
what	c
it	c
was	c
like	c
to	c
be	c
a	c
singer	c
.	c

If	c
only	c
I	c
could	c
sing	c
beautifully	c
!	c

Everybody	c
looked	c
very	c
excited	c
about	c
the	c
concert	c
.	c

During	c
the	c
concert	c
,	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
stand	c
to	c
protect	c
this	c
singer	c
.	c

Actually	c
,	c
they	c
were	c
well-behaved	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
great	c
experience	c
for	c
me	c
and	c
my	c
friend	c
.	c

I	c
wish	c
you	c
were	i
there	c
with	c
us	c
!	c

Please	c
take	c
care	c
and	c
please	c
write	c
to	c
me	c
,	c
right	c
?	c

Organiser	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
I	i
'd	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
the	c
prize	c
,	c
I	c
will	c
enjoy	c
it	c
abosolutly	i
.	c

Well	c
,	c
as	c
you	c
demand	i
,	c
I	c
tell	i
you	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
July	c
begins	c
,	c
I	c
'm	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
able	c
only	c
this	i
summer	i
month	c
because	c
my	i
job	c
responsabilities	i
.	c

As	c
well	c
as	c
this	c
one	i
I	c
'll	c
take	i
painting	c
,	c
I	c
'm	c
very	c
keen	c
on	c
art	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
I	c
'm	c
good	c
at	c
making	i
portraits	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
hope	c
the	c
information	c
above	c
would	i
be	c
sufficient	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c

"	c
Wuthering	c
Heights	c
"	c
by	c
Emile	c
Brönte	c
I	c
think	c
this	c
statement	c
is	c
a	c
very	c
truly	i
afimation	i
in	c
the	c
case	c
of	c
my	c
book	c
because	c
the	c
main	c
character	c
of	i
the	c
story	c
is	c
a	c
very	c
wicked	c
man	c
.	c

Besides	c
that	c
,	c
this	c
character	c
is	c
more	c
interesting	c
than	c
others	i
due	c
to	c
his	c
complex	c
mind	c
and	c
his	c
deep	c
evil	i
manners	i
.	c

It	i
's	i
the	c
richest	c
character	c
at	i
all	c
,	c
his	c
name	c
is	c
Heathcliff	c
,	c
and	c
he	c
's	c
the	c
reason	c
of	i
whatever	c
happens	c
to	c
the	c
others	i
characters	c
.	c

This	c
revenge	c
links	c
the	c
story	c
so	i
without	c
it	c
we	c
would	c
not	c
have	c
such	c
"	c
Wuthering	c
Heights	c
"	c
.	c

I	c
sympathize	c
with	c
Heathcliff	c
because	c
I	c
think	c
every	c
bad	c
character	c
is	c
a	c
very	c
important	c
point	i
of	c
every	c
book	c
,	c
film	c
or	c
play	c
and	c
if	c
they	c
were	c
missing	c
we	c
would	c
not	c
love	c
those	c
stories	c
we	c
enjoyed	c
while	c
we	c
were	c
reading	c
them	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
sleep	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
think	c
is	i
a	i
great	c
fun	c
and	c
a	c
bit	c
more	c
adventurous	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
not	c
too	c
much	i
confortable	i
,	c
but	c
it	i
is	c
not	c
a	c
problem	c
for	c
me	c
,	i
I	c
like	c
this	c
kind	c
of	c
holliday	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
keen	c
on	c
photography	c
so	c
I	c
would	c
love	c
to	c
participated	i
at	i
this	c
activity	c
,	i
I	c
am	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
that	i
and	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
pleasure	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
help	c
the	c
others	c
.	c

I	c
also	i
will	i
take	c
painting	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
always	c
dream	c
about	c
painting	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
never	c
try	c
to	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
good	c
occasion	i
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
to	i
ask	i
me	c
my	i
taste	i
and	c
to	i
be	i
preoccupated	i
about	i
it	i
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

Audrey	c
Gillett	c

Like	i
you	c
know	c
last	i
month	c
,	i
I	c
had	i
helped	i
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
and	c
I	c
enjoyed	c
it	c
a	c
lot	c
.	c

Firstly	i
I	c
had	c
to	c
make	c
the	c
decor	i
of	i
the	c
scene	i
,	c
so	c
I	c
made	c
in	i
the	c
background	c
a	c
sky	c
with	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
bright	c
stars	c
.	c

Then	c
I	c
put	c
some	i
blue	c
lights	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
wonderful	c
experience	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
like	i
a	i
dream	i
who	i
becomes	i
tru	i
.	c

I	c
wish	c
you	c
had	c
been	c
there	c
with	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
stayed	c
with	c
him	c
until	c
the	c
concert	c
begun	i
and	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
I	c
had	c
the	c
opportunity	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
his	c
private	c
room	c
with	c
him	c
and	c
the	c
other	c
dansers	i
.	c

See	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

Love	c
,	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Brown	c
,	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
the	c
play	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
start	c
at	c
7:30	c
P.M.	c
but	c
it	c
actually	c
started	c
only	i
at	c
8:15	c
P.M.	c
so	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
wait	c
forty-five	c
minutes	c
.	c

When	c
the	c
play	c
finally	c
started	c
,	c
and	c
the	c
two	c
actors	c
entered	c
the	c
stage	c
,	c
I	c
could	c
see	c
that	c
the	c
male	c
one	c
was	c
not	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
differently	i
from	i
what	c
the	c
advertisement	c
sign	i
says	c
,	c
what	i
really	c
disappointed	c
me	c
since	c
he	c
was	c
the	c
only	c
reason	c
that	c
I	c
came	c
to	c
this	c
play	c
.	c

There	c
was	c
only	c
a	c
small	c
sign	c
stamped	i
on	c
the	c
door	c
,	c
saying	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
"	c
closed	c
for	c
repairs	c
"	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
unfortunately	c
,	c
I	c
must	c
say	c
that	c
last	c
night	c
was	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
worst	c
nights	c
I	c
ever	c
had	c
,	c
and	c
given	i
the	c
reasons	c
,	c
I	c
expect	c
to	i
count	c
with	i
your	c
sense	c
of	c
responsability	i
,	c
so	c
,	c
I	c
feel	c
that	c
I	c
must	c
ask	c
for	c
my	c
20	c
pounds	c
spent	i
on	c
that	c
terrible	c
night	c
.	c

yours	c
faithful	i
,	c

As	c
we	c
all	c
know	c
,	c
technology	c
had	i
a	i
gigantic	i
improvement	i
over	c
the	c
last	c
20	c
years	c
,	c
and	c
today	c
,	c
it	c
affects	c
us	c
in	c
many	c
ways	c
.	c

Also	c
,	c
with	c
today	c
's	c
machines	c
,	c
factories	c
have	c
significantly	c
increased	c
their	c
production	c
,	c
what	i
brings	c
progress	c
to	c
humanity	c
,	c
but	c
also	c
,	c
with	c
the	c
continous	i
replacement	c
of	c
men	c
by	c
machines	c
,	c
the	i
unemployment	c
is	c
increasing	c
too	c
,	c
and	c
today	c
,	c
it	c
worries	c
every	c
single	c
citizen	c
of	c
the	c
world	c
,	c
specially	c
the	c
ones	c
who	c
lives	i
in	c
third	c
world	c
country	i
.	c

So	c
,	c
men	c
have	c
invented	c
machines	c
to	c
help	c
him	i
on	i
his	i
tasks	c
,	c
but	c
nowadays	c
,	c
we	c
our	i
becoming	c
slaves	c
of	i
them	i
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

It	c

As	c
for	c
the	c
accommodations	i
I	i
would	c
prefer	c
a	c
tent	c
,	i
there	i
's	i
nothing	c
like	c
hearing	c
raindrops	c
on	c
canvas	c
at	c
night	c
!	c

Last	c
but	c
not	c
least	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
sailing	c
and	c
climbing	c
.	c

It	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
fun	c
experiance	i
!	c

Will	c

any	c
money	c

of	c
all	c

on	c
who	c
is	c
with	c
you	c
and	c
what	c
the	c
other	c
person	c
likes	c
to	c
shop	c
for	c

Why	c
would	c
anyone	c

with	c
that	c
type	c

Well	c
,	c
I	c
really	c

Women	c
,	c
in	c

the	c
annoying	c
habit	c
of	c
always	c
having	c
to	c
touch	c
everything	c
they	c
see	c

Seeing	c
or	c
imagining	c
a	c

the	c
cloths	i
she	c
chooses	c
can	c
at	c
least	c
help	c
when	c
being	i
bored	c
,	c
but	c
shoes	c
are	c
just	c
shoes	c
.	c

Shopping	c
for	c
them	c
is	c
a	c
very	c
long	c
and	c
tiring	c
experiance	i

Shopping	c
for	i
me	i
is	c
supposed	c
to	c
be	c
a	c
very	c
fast	i
experiance	i

As	c
soon	c
as	c
someone	c
else	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c

This	c
made	i
me	i
really	i
disappointed	i
.	c

We	c
arrived	c
at	c
the	c
theatre	c
at	c
19,00	c
since	c
the	c
play	c
should	i
start	c
at	c
19:30	c
but	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
wait	c
until	c
20:15	c
then	i
it	c
started	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
also	c
said	c
that	c
discounts	c
was	i
available	c
but	c
this	c
was	c
wrong	c
,	c
because	c
we	c
could	c
n't	c
get	c
any	c
discounts	c
.	c

The	c
theatre	c
Restaurant	c
that	c
should	c
be	c
open	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
the	c
chief	i
was	c
ill	c
and	c
there	c
was	c
no	c
food	c
in	c
the	c
fridge	c
.	c

This	c
should	c
have	c
been	c
our	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

Pat	c
's	c
sister-in-law	c
was	c
having	c
a	c
baby	c
but	c
she	c
wanted	c
to	c
wait	c
and	c
tell	c
the	c
rest	c
of	c
the	c
family	c
.	c

She	c
realised	c
that	c
telling	c
Pat	c
was	c
a	c
very	c
bad	c
idea	c
but	c
now	c
it	c
was	c
done	c
.	c

Which	c
was	c
very	c
chooking	i
for	c
her	c
mother	c
.	c

-	c
"	c
Maria	c
and	c
Peter	c
are	c
going	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
baby	c
"	c

I	c
have	c
just	c
recieved	i
your	c
letter	c
saying	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
the	c
competition	c
,	i
I	c
must	c
say	c
I	c
was	c
really	c
surprise	i
and	c
happy	c
to	c
have	i
the	c
oportunity	i
to	c
join	c
the	c
Camp	c
for	c
two	c
weeks	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
at	c
the	c

at	c
that	c
time	c
,	i
I	c
will	c
be	c
finishing	c
a	c
degree	c
in	c
Arts	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
concerned	c
that	c
you	c
offer	c
me	c
the	c
chance	c
to	c
choose	c
two	c
activities	c
,	c
while	c
I	c
am	c
there	c
,	i
because	i
of	c
my	c
studies	c
,	c
I	c
will	c
take	c
painting	c
as	i
this	c
is	c
the	c
subject	c

I	c
am	c
finishing	c

College	i

allways	i
with	i
important	i
cualificaitons	i
,	c
and	c
photography	c
subject	i
which	c
has	c
been	c
my	c
hobby	c
since	c
I	c
discover	i
that	c
I	c

It	c
happened	c
to	c

once	c

However	c
,	c

most	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

This	c
show	c
was	c
for	i
me	i
very	i
disappointing	i
for	c
many	c
reasons	c
:	i
First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
surprised	c
by	c
the	c
no	i
presence	i
of	c
the	c
famous	c
actor	c
,	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
who	c
was	c
one	c
of	c
my	c
reasons	c
to	i
book	i
a	c
sit	i
.	c

Also	c
,	c
I	c
'm	c
unhappy	c
about	c
the	c
bad	i
informations	i
of	i
your	c
advertisement	c
,	c
which	c
clearly	c
says	c
,	i
the	c
play	c
begins	c
at	c
19.30	c
instead	i
of	c
20.15	c
as	i
my	c
evening	i
'	i
show	c
.	c

That	c
's	c
why	c
,	c
in	c
return	i
of	i
all	c
those	i
problems	c
,	c
I	c
'm	c
asking	c
you	c

back	c
some	c
money	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c

It	c
was	c
clear	c
that	c
Pat	c
had	c
to	c
change	c
and	c
show	c
to	i
his	c
friend	i
that	c
they	c
can	i
believe	c
in	c
him	c

For	c

do	c
his	c
best	c
to	c
be	c
the	i

I	c

I	c
would	c
preffer	i

only	c
these	i
time	c

because	c
my	c
summer	c
holidays	c
during	i
these	c
days	c

A	c
cabin	c
remember	i
me	c
too	c
much	c
to	i
my	c
home	c
and	c
is	c
too	c
confortable	i
,	i
that	i
is	c
n't	c
what	c

Vadim	c
Titov	c

You	c
ca	i
n't	i
believe	c
what	c
I	c
did	c
last	c
month	c
.	c

You	c
had	i
always	i
some	c
problems	c
because	i
like	c
not	c
having	c
enough	c
wire	c
or	c
the	c
lamps	c
were	i
broken	c
by	c
the	c
transport	c
.	c

The	c
experience	c
that	c
I	c
made	i
was	c
,	i
that	c
I	c
had	c
never	c
worked	c
in	c
a	i
such	i
perfect	c
team	c
.	c

After	c
the	c
hard	c
work	c
we	c
took	i
cool	c
drinks	c
,	c
sat	c
down	c
on	c
the	c
ground	c
and	c
enjoyed	c
the	c
pop	c
concert	c
.	c

And	c
as	c
the	c
pop	c
stars	c
thanked	c
us	c
for	c
our	c
hard	c
job	i
we	c
all	c
were	c
a	c
little	c
proud	c
to	c
be	c
here	c
.	c

Love	c
,	c
Vadim	c

As	i
I	i
saw	i
from	i
your	i
advertisement	i
in	i
the	i
newspaper	i
,	i
it	i
said	i
'	c
Starring	c
:	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
'	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
disappointed	c
when	c
I	c
found	c
the	c
actor	c
was	c
n't	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
!	c

And	c
from	i
your	c
advertisement	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
should	c
start	i
at	c
19.30	c
but	c
it	c
did	c
n't	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
45	c
minutes	c
late	c
!	c

And	c
also	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
buy	c
tickets	c
with	c
my	c
credit	c
card	c
but	c
on	c
the	c
advertisement	c
,	i
it	c
said	c
'	c
discounts	c
available	c
'	c
I	i
was	c
really	c
annoyed	c
by	c
that	c
!	c

After	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
we	c
expacted	i
to	c
eat	c
something	c
in	c
your	c
restaurant	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
closed	i
!	c

I	c
have	c
no	c
idea	c
why	c
!	c

We	c
had	c
a	c
really	c
unenjoyable	c
time	c
at	c
your	c
theatre	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
and	c
I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hear	i
from	c
you	c

Unfortunately	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

So	c
one	c
week	c
later	c
all	c
student	i
in	c
my	c
class	c
knew	c
that	c
I	c
was	c
an	c
angle	i
.	c

But	c
it	c
's	c
true	c
...	c

I	c
'm	c
an	c
angle	i
and	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
visit	c
the	c
earth	c
.	c

Pat	c
was	c
the	c
only	c
person	c
who	c
I	c
told	c
my	c
secret	c
but	i
now	c
it	c
has	c
become	c
a	c
joke	c
!	c

I	c
would	c
have	c
to	c
kill	c
her	c
!	c

I	c
offered	c
to	c
wait	c
...	c

Her	c
brother	c
and	c
I	c
began	c
to	c
talk	c
...	c

He	c
's	c
such	c
a	c
nice	c
boy	c
.	c

I	c
liked	c
him	c
very	c
much	c
and	c
I	c
guessed	c
he	c
liked	c
me	c
too	c
...	c

We	c
started	c
to	c
go	c
out	c
in	i
the	c
same	c
time	c
as	c
I	c
started	c
to	c
change	c
my	c
mind	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
want	c
to	c
go	c
back	c
to	c
the	i
heaven	c
anymore	c
as	c
long	c
as	c
I	c
am	c
with	c
him	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
reply	c
for	i
your	c
letter	c
about	c
competition	i
.	c

Secondly	c
you	i
asked	c
me	c
,	i
when	c
I	c
have	c
time	c
for	c
travel	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
can	c
go	i
only	i
in	c
July	c
,	c
because	c
only	i
in	i
July	i
I	i

And	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
in	c
the	c
first	c
part	c
of	c
this	c
month	c
,	c
socond	i
part	c
I	c
spend	c
with	c
my	c
familly	i
.	c

If	c
you	c
do	c
not	c
mind	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c

because	c
in	c

very	i
exciting	c

wonderful	c
for	c

the	c
opportunitie	i
to	c
visit	c
the	i
Camp	c
California	c
in	c
the	c
U.S.A	c
.	c

And	c
for	c
the	c
second	c
question	c
.	c

About	c
accommodation	c
during	c
these	c
two	c
weeks	c
at	c
the	c
Camp	c
I	i
would	c
prefer	c
log	i
cabins	i
;	c
because	c
maybe	c
is	i
more	c
interesting	c
to	c
share	c
with	c
other	c
people	c
.	c

In	i
other	i
hand	i
you	c
ask	i
me	c
I	c
have	c
the	c
chance	c
for	i
to	c
choose	c
two	c
activities	c
while	c
I	c
am	c
at	c
the	c
camp	c
.	c

but	i
is	i
no	i
easy	i
,	c
because	c
all	c
is	i
very	c
interesting	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

Meanwhile	i
,	i
these	i
activities	i
are	i
develop	i
.	c

Is	c
possible	i
to	c
get	c
there	i
?	c

At	i
the	i
same	i
situation	i
for	i
climbing	i
I	i
need	c
special	i
equipment	c
and	c
then	i
there	i
are	i
available	i
in	c
the	c
Camp	c
and	c
what	c
about	c
the	c

these	c
activities	c

I	i
need	c
extra	i
money	c
?	c

Thanks	c
very	c
much	c

because	c
is	c
new	c
stimulation	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

Because	c
sometimes	c
the	c
article	c
for	i
to	i
buy	i
is	c
not	c
really	c
necessary	c
.	c

We	c
must	c
to	i
accept	i
that	c
media	i
have	c
so	i
important	c
effect	c
in	i
our	c
life	i
in	i
special	i
the	c
T.V	c
.	c

In	i
the	i
other	i
hand	i
the	c
facilities	c
for	c
access	c
to	c
mall	i
center	i
is	i
not	c
good	c
.	c

Otherwise	c
shopping	c
will	i
be	c
more	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
in	c
the	c
nearly	i
future	c
we	c
need	c
to	c
decide	c
with	c
the	c
goverment	i
.	i

which	c
is	i
special	c
place	c
in	c
the	c
town	c
we	i
lefet	i
just	c
for	i
comerical	i
area	c
,	c
but	c
of	c
course	c
with	c
all	c
the	c
facilities	c
to	c
get	c
there	c
like	i
a	c
big	c
supermarket	c
,	i
and	c
mall	c
centre	c
in	i
different	c
areas	c
of	c
the	c
city	c
.	c

A	c
few	c
days	c
ago	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
London	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
nice	c
holiday	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
expecting	c
to	c
have	c
fun	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
play	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
,	c
thats	i
now	c
presenting	i
in	c
your	c
theatre	c
.	c

I	c
read	c
the	c
advertisement	c
and	c
I	c
thought	c
it	c
was	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
a	c
plesent	i
evening	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
buy	c
the	c
ticket	c
I	c
tried	c
to	c
get	c
a	c
discount	c
with	c
my	c
student	c
card	c
,	c
but	c
that	c
was	c
not	c
posible	i
.	c

I	c
let	c
this	c
pass	c
and	c
I	c
bought	c
it	c
anyway	c
,	c
thinking	c
that	c
was	i
posible	i
that	c
it	i
was	c
only	c
a	c
mistake	c
in	c
your	c
advertisement	c
.	c

But	c
the	c
play	c
started	c
fourty-five	i
minutes	c
late	c
,	c
and	c
the	c
star	c
of	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
of	c
whom	c
I	c
'm	c
a	c
great	c
fan	c
an	i
who	c
was	c
the	c
mainly	i
reason	c
of	i
why	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
play	c
,	c
was	i
changed	i
for	c
another	c
actor	c
,	c
how	i
turned	c
out	c
to	c
be	c
really	c
bad	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
you	c
realized	i
why	c
I	c
'm	c
writting	i
this	c
letter	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
to	c
give	c
my	i
money	c
back	c
.	c

All	c
the	c
thing	i
that	c
were	c
promised	c
in	c
your	c
advertisement	c
were	c
not	i
true	i
,	c
and	c
it	c
was	c
definitly	i
NOT	c
the	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
.	c

Specting	i
that	c
you	c
will	c
solve	i
this	c
misunderstanding	c
.	c

There	c
's	c
no	c
doubt	c
that	c
modern	c
tecnology	i
has	c
changed	c
our	c
lives	c
,	c
but	c
how	c
?	c

First	c
the	c
telegraph	c
and	c
the	c
radio	c
an	i
now	c
TV	c
,	c
the	c
telephone	c
and	c
the	c
Internet	c
allowed	i
people	c
be	i
in	c
contact	c
with	c
others	c
really	c
quickly	c
and	i
distances	c
arent	i
now	c
so	c
difficult	c
of	i
overcome	i

Dear	c
Madam	i
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
have	i
received	i
your	c
letter	c
yesterday	c
.	c

The	i
date	c
that	i
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
,	c
that	i
will	c
be	c
nice	c
to	c
go	c
on	c
1st	i
of	c
July	c
.	c

The	i
activities	c
that	c
you	c
have	c
listed	c
forms	i
.	c

Some	c
of	c
the	i
them	c
I	c
really	i
interested	c
in	c
it	i
,	c
especially	c
painting	c
.	c

Since	c
I	c
was	c
young	c
,	c
my	c
dad	c
he	i
alway	i
took	i
me	c
out	i
to	i
have	i
live	i
drawings	i
,	c
so	c
now	c
it	c
became	i
my	i
hobbies	c
.	c

And	c
I	c
think	c
,	i
it	c
is	i
nice	c
to	c
draw	c
the	i
beautiful	c
landscapes	c
of	c
the	c
place	c
.	c

Beside	c
drawings	i
,	c
swimming	c
is	c
my	c
favourite	c
as	c
well	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
was	c
in	c
highschool	i
,	c
I	c
have	i
joined	i
in	i
the	c
swimming	c
club	c
.	c

And	c
I	c
also	c
participated	c
in	c
a	c
few	c
swimming	c
competition	i
.	c

Although	c
I	c
'm	c
not	c
the	c
best	c
,	c
but	i
I	c
have	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
confident	i
in	i
it	c
.	c

I	c
agree	c
!	c

Sometimes	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

For	i
most	i
of	i
the	i
people	c
might	c
think	c
,	c
why	c
would	c
I	c
say	c
that	c
,	i
because	c
shopping	c
is	c
a	c
very	c
good	c
entertainment	c
especially	i
for	c
female	i
,	c
as	i
me	c
.	c

I	c
like	c
to	c
have	i
window	c
shopping	c
that	i
is	i
good	i
to	i
go	i
arround	i
the	c
shopping	c
area	i
.	c

It	c
would	i
help	i
you	c
up	i
to	c
the	i
date	c
.	c

What	c
fashion	c
is	c
hit	i
now	c
.	c

Then	c
I	c
can	c
say	c
I	i
'm	i
definatly	i
does	i
n't	i
feel	c
any	i
enjoyable	c

thank	i
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c

You	c
have	i
had	i
some	c
questions	c
which	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
answer	c
now	c
:	c

-	c
Accomodation	i
:	c
Log	i
cabins	i
would	c
be	c
nice	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
when	c
I	c
am	c
in	c
California	c
.	c

-	c
Activities	c
:	c
During	i
my	c
stay	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
do	c
swimming	c
and	c
surfing	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
a	c
good	c
swimmer	c
and	c
hope	c
to	c
improve	c
my	c
swimming	c
style	c
,	c
too	c
.	c

On	i
the	i
other	i
side	i
I	c
have	c
no	c
experience	c
in	i
surfing	c
,	i
-	c
I	c
am	c
an	c
absolute	c
beginner	c
with	c
high	c
motivation	c
.	c

-	c
Additional	c
question	c
:	c
Could	i
you	c
tell	c
me	c
how	c

is	c
usually	c
needed	c
for	c

Shopping	c
'	c
stands	i

buying	c
goods	c
for	c
your	c
daily	c
requirements	c
,	c
e.g.	c
food	c
,	c
clothes	c

In	c
this	c
contest	i
,	c
shopping	c
means	c
a	c
compulsory	c
exercise	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
do	c
regularly	c
and	c
frequently	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
not	c
enjoyable	c
if	c
you	c
look	c
at	i
it	c
as	c
a	c
duty	c
.	c

Try	c
the	c
internet	i
and	c
use	c
e-business	c
and	c
online-shopping	i
to	c
order	c
your	c
pants	c

Another	c
solution	i
to	c
get	c
a	c
friendlier	c
service	c
is	c
of	c
course	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
another	c
shop	c

You	c
have	c
been	c
presented	c
some	i
causes	i
why	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

There	c
are	c
ways	c
of	c
behaviour	i
to	i
make	i
more	i
fun	i
of	i
it	i
.	c

Dear	c
Madam/Sir	c
,	c

Recently	c
I	c
am	i
interested	c
in	c
musical	c
shows	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
seen	c
it	i
in	c
my	c
country	c
.	c

As	c
I	c
arrived	c
there	c
after	c
5	c
P.M.	c
,	c
I	c
missed	c
the	c
first	c
performance	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
19:30	c
p.m	c
performance	c
.	c

The	c
worst	c
one	i
was	c
that	c
the	c
actor	c
and	c
actress	c
were	c
not	c
the	c
person	i
who	c
had	c
been	c
written	c
in	i
the	c
advertisement	c
,	c
because	c
of	c
that	c
I	c
was	c
extremely	c
disappointed	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
I	c
could	c
not	c
concentrate	c
on	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

After	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
when	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
restaurant	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
,	c
because	c
it	c
usually	c
opens	c
between	c
afternoon	c
and	c
evening	c
shows	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
am	c
asking	c
for	c
some	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
receiving	c
your	c
prompt	c
reply	c
.	c

How	c
has	c
modern	c
technology	c
changed	c
your	c
daily	c
life	c
?	c

It	c
could	c
be	c
difficult	c
to	c
feel	c
how	c
many	c
things	c
has	i
been	c
changed	c
in	c
our	c
daily	c
life	c
.	c

The	c
modern	c
technology	c
is	c
developing	c
toward	c
convenience	c
for	c
human	i
.	c

So	c
,	c
we	i
can	c
be	i
connected	i
other	c
people	c
with	c
a	c
mobile	c
phone	c
no	c
matter	c
where	c
you	c
are	c
and	c
you	c
can	c
correspond	c
to	i
other	i
contry	i
people	i
in	c
real	c
time	c
by	c
using	c
internet	i
.	c

However	c
not	i
only	c
this	c
advantage	c
but	c
also	i
there	i
are	i
lots	c
of	c
disadvantages	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
say	c
the	i
science	c
and	c
techology	c
changed	c
our	c
daily	c
life	c
more	i
convenience	c
it	i
also	c
could	c
be	c
dangerous	c
.	c

Dear	c
Ms.	c
Helen	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	i
confirming	c
about	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
pleased	c
as	i
I	c
got	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
I	c
'll	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
travel	c
on	i
July	c
.	c

I	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
log	c
cabins	c
,	c
therefore	i
I	c
'm	c
going	c
to	c
travel	c
with	c
2	c
children	c
and	c
my	c
dog	c
.	c

I	c
wonder	c
if	c
I	c
can	c
take	c
them	c
as	c
well	c
.	c

Then	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
join	c
the	c
activities	c
,	c
swimming	c
and	c
Singing	c
.	c

I	c
love	c
swimming	c
and	c
also	c
I	c
've	c
got	c
a	c
scubar	i
diving	c
licence	c
.	c

Hana	c
Soma	c

Nowadays	c
,	c
most	c
product	i
's	i
prices	c
has	i
gone	c
up	c
with	c
our	c
own	c
country	c
's	c
economy	i
development	c
.	c

So	c
their	c
attitude	c
sometimes	c
seems	c
to	c
be	c
bossy	c
and	c
pushy	c
.	c

I	c
sometimes	c
loose	i
my	c
desire	c
to	c
buy	c
a	c
thing	c
because	c
of	c
their	c
badly	i
behaviers	i
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
for	c
our	c
jobs	c
supecial	i
ceremonys	i
and	i
so	c
on	c
.	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
for	c
us	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
your	c
advertisement	c
concerning	c
the	c
Musical	c
show	c
:	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
"	c
.	c

To	c
make	c
matters	c
worse	c
the	c
musical	c
started	c
almost	c
one	c
hour	c
later	c
than	c
it	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
start	c
.	c

Your	c
advertisement	c
also	c
failed	c
to	c
mention	c
the	c
fact	c
that	c
there	c
was	i
no	c
discounts	c
what	i
so	i
ever	i
and	c
finally	i
,	c
because	c
of	c
a	c
shortage	c
of	c
staf	i
,	c
your	c
restaurant	c
was	c
not	c
available	i
for	i
us	i
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

But	c
now	c
when	i
the	c
story	c
was	c
out	c
,	c
it	i
was	i
just	c
to	i
start	i
to	c
accept	c
it	c
.	c

At	c
once	c
I	c
felt	c
more	c
assertive	c
and	c
a	c
big	c
smile	c
appeared	c
in	i
my	c
face	c
.	c

I	c
decieded	i
to	c
thank	c
Pat	c
,	c
and	c
maybe	c
,	c
if	c
possible	c
,	c
teach	c
her	c
a	c
lession	i
.	c

I	c
pretended	c
to	c
be	c
totaly	i
miserable	c
.	c

Finally	c
I	c
smiled	c
.	c

After	c
huging	i
eatch	i
other	c
we	c
promised	c
never	c
to	c
tell	c
others	c
about	c
our	c
secrets	c
.	c

Also	i
it	i
made	c
me	c
very	c
disappoint	i
.	c

There	c
are	c
several	c
reasons	c
that	c
I	c
was	c
not	c
happy	c
about	c
the	c
musical	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
not	c
see	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
during	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
the	c
times	c
,	c
it	c
's	c
available	i
14.30	i
and	c
19.30	c
so	c
I	c
choose	i
19.30	c
.	c

However	c
it	i
was	c
deleied	i
it	i
started	c
20.15	i
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
it	c
's	c
difficult	c
say	c
what	c
exactly	c
modern	c
technology	c
is	c
now	c
but	c
I	c
can	c
say	c
for	c
sure	c
it	i
's	i
keep	i
developing	c
and	c
much	c
better	c
than	c
the	c
past	c
.	c

Think	c
about	c
the	c
conputer	i
,	c
the	c
speed	c
of	c
conputer	i
is	c
much	c
faster	c
than	c
before	c
.	c

I	c
even	i
could	i
n't	i
imagine	c
our	c
p.c	c
can	i
be	c
that	c
fast	c
.	c

T.V	c
colour	c
only	c
consist	i
of	c
white	c
and	c
black	c
.	c

You	c
can	c
have	i
a	i
shopping	c
on	c
the	c
internet	i
and	c
it	c
might	c
the	i
fastest	c
way	c
to	c
gather	c
any	c
information	c
you	c
would	c
like	c
to	c

Dear	c
the	i
manage	i
of	c
theatre	i
,	c

I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
circle	c
theatre	c
to	c
see	c
a	c
musical	c
show	c
,	c
OVER	c
THE	c
RAINBOW	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
to	c
wait	c
45	c
minutes	c
,	c
wasting	c
time	c
.	c

Thirdly	c
,	c
tickets	c
were	c
£	c
10	c
,	c
£	c
15	c
and	c
£	c
20	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
knew	c
that	c
these	c
were	c
available	c
to	i
discount	c
,	c
following	c
the	c
advertisement	c
.	c

But	c
it	c
was	c
impossible	c
.	c

You	c
said	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
perfect	i
evening	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
upset	i
evening	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
n't	c
be	c
satisfied	c
your	i
theatre	c
.	c

With	i
hopeness	i
you	i
understand	c
me	c
.	c

Unfortunely	i
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

At	c
first	c
when	i
he	c
had	c
a	c
girlfriend	c
,	c
they	c
talked	c
to	c
each	c
other	c
franckly	i
.	c

But	c
he	c
forgot	c
it	c
and	c
told	c
his	c
friends	c
.	c

Actually	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
on	c
his	i
purpose	c
.	c

Though	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
on	c
his	i
purpose	c
,	c
it	c
makes	c
his	c
friends	c
leave	c
him	c
.	c

Pat	c
also	c
regrets	c
about	i
his	c
speaking	i
.	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
very	c
unpleasent	i
evening	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
it	c
had	c
read	i
on	i
the	c
advertisement	c
that	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
was	c
starring	c
at	i
this	c
show	c
.	c

It	c
began	c
at	c
20:15	c
and	c
not	c
at	c
19:30	c
!	c

That	c
's	c
almost	c
an	c
hour	c
later	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
n't	c
a	c
perfect	c
evening	c
at	c
all	c
.	c

In	i
our	i
days	i
,	c
nobody	c
can	c
live	c
without	c
technology	c
.	c

My	c
day	c
,	c
for	c
example	c
,	c
begins	c
with	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
noise	c
.	c

I	c
use	c
it	c
to	c
make	i
compositions	i
,	c
to	c
print	c
some	c
pictures	c
or	c
to	c
surf	c
on	i
the	c
internet	i
.	c

After	c
school	c
I	c
relax	c
in	c
front	c
of	c
the	c
TV	c
and	c
talk	c
a	c
lot	c
with	c
my	c
friends	c
per	i
telephone	i
.	c

Without	c
these	i
technology	c
I	c
would	c
get	c
realy	i
bored	c
.	c

Now	c
,	c
I	c
loose	i
less	c
of	i
time	c
and	c
can	c
use	c
the	i
technology	c
to	c
enjoy	c
myself	c
.	c

DEAR	c

I	c
AM	c
WRITING	c

ABOUT	c
A	c
MUSICAL	c
SHOW	i
THAT	c
IS	c
TAKING	c
PART	i
IN	i
THE	c
CIRCLE	c
THEATRE	c

I	c
WAS	c
WORRIED	c
WHEN	c
I	c
SAW	c
THE	c
ADVERTISEMENT	c
OF	i
THE	c
PLAY	i
IN	c
A	c
NEWSPAPER	c
ON	c
SUNDAY	c

THE	c
FIRST	c
PROBLEM	c
WAS	c
WHEN	c
I	c
READ	c
THE	i
STARRING	c
.	c

ANOTHER	c
PROBLEM	c
WAS	c
THE	c
TIME	c
THAT	c
I	c
HAD	c
TO	c
WAIT	c
.	c

I	c
THOUGHT	c
IT	c
WILL	i
BE	c
AT	c
19.30	c
AND	c
I	c
HAVE	i
BEEN	i
WAITING	i
FOR	c
FORTY	i
FIVE	i
MINUTES	c
!	c
!	c

TO	c
SUM	c
UP	c
,	c
I	c
DID	c
NOT	c
SPEND	i
A	c
PERFECT	c
EVENING	c
.	c

I	c
THINK	c
THAT	c
IT	c
WAS	c
THE	c
WORST	c
I	c
HAVE	c
EVER	c
HAD	c
.	c

ON	i
THE	i
WHOLE	i
,	c
I	c
WOULD	c
LIKE	c
TO	c
HAVE	c
MY	c

JUST	c
BE	c
YOURSELF	c

IN	c

THE	c
FUTURE	c
,	i
PEOPLE	c
WILL	c
BE	c
WEARING	c
FASHIONABLE	c
CLOTHES	c
LIKE	c
NOW	c

THIS	i
PEOPLE	c
WILL	c
BE	c

ABOUT	c
WHAT	c
THEY	c
LOOK	c
LIKE	c

ON	c
THE	c
OTHER	c
HAND	c

THERE	c
WILL	c

NOWADAYS	c
,	c
PEOPLE	c
SEEM	i
TO	i
BE	i
ALWAYS	i
WORRIED	c

IN	c
MY	c
OPINION	c
,	c
PEOPLE	c
WILL	c
GIVE	i
IMPORTANCE	c
TO	c
HOW	c
THEIR	c
PERSONALITY	i
DEVELOP	c
AND	c
THEY	c
WILL	c
GIVE	c
UP	c
WORRYING	c
ABOUT	c
WHAT	c

THEY	c
WILL	c
HAVE	c
ENOUGH	c
MONEY	c
TO	c
BUY	c
WHAT	c
THEY	c
NEED	c
AND	c
TO	c
BE	c
HAPPY	c
WITH	c
IT	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
decided	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
visit	c
Camp	c
California	c
only	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
already	c
organized	c
an	i
other	i
trip	c
for	c
the	c
month	c
of	c
august	i
.	c

I	c
have	c
also	c
chosen	c
as	c
activities	c
the	c
ones	i
of	c
Golf	c
and	c
tennis	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
rather	c
good	c
at	c
these	c
sports	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
practised	i
them	c
since	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
little	c
girl	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
also	c
several	c
simple	c
questions	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
and	c
what	c
type	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
need	c
.	c

Do	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
with	i
me	i
my	i
tennis	i
raquet	i
and	i
my	i
golf	i
bag	i
?	c

I	c
would	c
be	c
very	c
thankful	i
to	c
recieve	i
answers	c
to	c
my	c
questions	c

thank	c
you	c

Dear	c
Kim	c

How	c
are	c
you	c

I	c

was	c
really	c
cool	c
.	c

Boy	c
,	c
He	i
's	i
really	c
really	c
handsom	i
!	c

Even	c
though	c
I	c
ended	c
terribly	i
tired	c
I	c
really	c
enjoyed	c
myself	c
.	c

I	c
even	c
got	c
the	c
chance	c
to	c
take	c
some	c
photographs	c
of	c
ricky	c
Martin	c
with	c
my	c
sister	c
and	c
I	c
've	c
got	c
one	c
photo	c
of	c
him	c
with	c
me	c
!	c
!	c

Well	c
,	c
its	c
an	c
experience	c
I	c
'll	c
never	c
forget	c
as	c
long	c
as	c
I	c
live	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

As	c
a	c
matter	c
of	c
fact	c
,	c
I	c
waited	i
for	i
seeing	i
Danny	c
Brook	c
who	i
I	c
appreciate	c
a	c
lot	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
disappointed	c
that	c
he	c
was	c
n't	c
here	i
.	c

Your	c
advertisement	c
mentioned	c
that	c
discounts	c
were	c
available	c
,	c
however	c
when	i
I	c
asked	i
for	i
them	i
to	i
the	i
staff	i
they	c
replied	c
to	i
me	i
that	c
they	i
were	c
n't	c
discounts	i
!	c

After	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
visit	c
your	c
restaurant	c
and	c
once	i
again	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
disappointed	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

Anybody	i
could	c
explain	c
to	c
me	c
why	c
!	c

I	c
can	c
assure	c
you	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
a	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
and	c
I	c
got	c
very	c
annoyed	c
about	c
this	c
evening	c
which	c
could	c
have	c
been	c
wonderful	c
.	c

That	c
is	c
the	c
reason	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
you	c
to	c
refund	c
my	c
money	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
to	c
work	c
out	c
all	c
my	c
figures	c
two	c
times	c
to	c
make	c
sure	c
that	c
my	c
accounts	c
were	c
accurate	c
.	c

Now	c
,	c
I	c
enter	c
datas	i
and	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
need	c
any	i
more	i
to	i
calculate	i
my	i
figures	i
,	c
the	c
work	c
is	c
completely	i
made	i
by	c
the	i
computer	c
and	c
in	c
addition	c
there	c
is	i
no	c
mistake	i
.	c

At	i
the	c
beginning	c
,	c
I	c
wasted	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
time	c
getting	c
some	c
information	c
I	c
needed	c
because	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
know	c
exactly	c
where	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
look	c
for	c
.	i

Another	c
thing	c
that	c
has	c
changed	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
is	c
the	c
mobil	i
phone	c
.	c

As	c
a	c
matter	c
of	c
fact	c
,	c
if	c
I	c
am	c
stuck	c
in	c
my	c
car	c
in	c
the	i
traffic	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
call	c
my	c
boyfriend	c
to	c
tell	c
him	c
that	c
I	c
would	i
be	c
late	c
.	c

Sometimes	c
the	c
ring	c
is	c
annoying	c
but	c
finally	i
,	c
the	c
mobil	i
phone	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
handy	i
object	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs.	c
Ryan	c
,	c

For	c
August	c
I	c
booked	c
a	c
journey	i
to	c
Greece	c
with	c
my	c
wife	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
not	c
quite	i
a	c
young	c
man	c
and	c
during	c
the	c
past	i
years	c
of	c
my	c
life	c
I	c
gothave	i
become	i
accostomed	i
to	c
some	i
more	i
comfort	c
.	c

Yours	c

-	c
I	c
start	c
the	c
day	c
by	c
greeting	c
the	c
children	c
and	c
they	c
answer	c
-	c
in	c
English	c
,	c
of	c
course	c
.	c

Then	c
I	c
tell	c
them	c
to	c
sit	c
down	c
.	c

I	c
will	c
show	c
pictures	c
of	c
animals	c
and	c
the	c
children	c
will	c
tell	c
me	c
the	c
name	i
of	c
that	i
animal	i
.	c

-	c
Later	c
on	c
we	c
'll	c
go	i
to	i
sing	i
the	c
song	c
of	i
"	c
Old	c
McDonald	c
had	c
a	c
farm	c
"	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
musical	c
show	i
"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
,	c
that	i
I	c
went	c
to	c
see	c
on	c
the	c
16th	c
of	c
June	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
the	c
actor	c
suppossed	i
to	c
be	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
but	c
he	c
was	c
not	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
another	c
actor	c
,	c
who	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
seen	c
before	c
,	c
so	c
,	c
as	c
you	c
can	c
imagen	i
,	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
disappointed	c
.	c

Now	c
,	c
about	c
the	c
tickets	c
,	c
the	i
were	c
different	c
prices	c
but	c
there	c
were	c
not	i
discounts	c
,	c
and	c
because	c
of	c
this	c
,	c
many	c
people	c
could	c
not	c
see	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
especially	c
students	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
when	c
the	c
musical	i
show	c
finished	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
say	c
,	c
a	c
bit	c
late	c
,	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
's	c
restaurant	c
to	c
eat	c
something	c
but	c
this	c
place	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
the	c
chef	c
had	c
already	c
gone	c
.	c

After	c
3	c
weeks	c
,	c
Maria	c
got	c
ill	c
so	c
she	c
was	c
not	c
available	i
to	c
go	c
to	c
school	c
.	c

Some	i
friends	i
phoned	c
her	c
everyday	i
,	c
except	c
Pat	c
,	c
the	c
only	c
friend	c
that	c
Maria	c
really	c
loved	c
,	i
despite	i
that	c
,	c
she	c
was	c
not	c
sad	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
recently	c
got	c
a	c
new	c
job	c
,	c
which	c
I	c
am	c
going	c
to	c
start	c
in	c
August	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
a	c
very	c
good	c
swimmer	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
choose	c
swimming	c
from	c
the	c
activities	c
you	c
listed	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
also	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
am	c
supposed	c
to	c
take	c
with	c
me	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
be	c
glad	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
give	c
me	c
an	c
answer	c
before	c
the	c
camp	c
begins	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

But	c
not	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
shopping	c
is	c
hard	c
,	c
exhausting	c
work	c
,	c
especially	c
when	c
you	c
are	c
trying	c
to	c
buy	c
yourself	c
some	c
new	c
clothes	c
.	c

Eventually	c
,	c
after	c
long	c
seeking	i
you	c
find	c
a	c
skirt	c
you	c
like	c
.	c

You	c
get	c
really	c
angry	c
trying	c
to	c
find	c
a	c
bigger	c
one	c
but	c
unfortunately	c
this	c
is	c
the	c
last	c
one	c
.	c

And	c
finally	c
,	c
after	c
a	c
few	c
more	c
hours	c
,	c
you	c
buy	c
the	c
skirt	c
of	c
your	c
dreams	c
.	c

Accident	i
like	c
that	c
can	c
really	c
make	c
you	c
livid	c
.	c

At	c
last	c
you	c
come	c
back	c
home	c
,	c
carrying	c
the	c
most	c
beautiful	c
skirt	c
in	c
the	c
whole	c
town	c
.	c

You	c
can	c
always	c
go	c
and	c
buy	c
a	c
new	c
one	c
.	c

Dear	c
Madam	c
,	c

In	c
August	c
I	c
'll	c
be	c
working	c

About	c
the	c
acommodation	i
,	c
out	i
of	i
the	c
two	c
possibilities	i
,	c
I	c
choose	c
sleeping	i
in	c
a	c
tent	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
is	c
n't	c
as	c
authentic	c
as	c
a	c
tent	c
,	c
at	c
the	c
camp	c
.	c

My	c
two	c
activities	c
chosen	c
from	c
the	c
list	c
are	c
climbing	c
and	c
surfing	c
.	c

My	c
skills	c
in	c
these	c
activities	c
are	i
very	i
different	i
:	c
while	c
in	i
climbing	c
,	c
this	c
will	c
be	c
the	c
first	c
time	c
I	c
climb	i
.	c

In	c
surfing	c
learning	i
wo	c
n't	c
be	c
a	c
problem	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
doing	c
it	c
since	c
I	c
was	c
ten	c
years	c
old	c

Do	c
you	c
remember	c
that	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
help	c
in	i
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
?	c

Well	c
the	c
concert	c
was	c
Friday	c
night	c
and	c
I	c
went	c
there	c
with	c
the	c
Red	c
Cross	c
volunteers	c
,	i
did	i
you	c
know	c
I	c
'm	c
one	c
of	c
them	c
?	c

During	c
the	c
two	i
hours	i
of	i
concert	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
attend	c
thirty-six	i
people	c
,	i
who	c
became	c
inconscious	i
after	c
being	c
trapped	c
in	c
the	c
first	c
line	i
by	c
the	c
other	c
people	c
.	c

Thirty-six	c
people	c
in	c
two	c
hours	c
!	c

If	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
help	c
in	i
a	c
concert	c
and	c
you	c
can	c
avoid	c
it	c
.	c

Well	c
,	c
I	c
hope	c
you	c
wo	c
n't	c
be	c
as	c
lazy	c
as	c
me	c
and	c
you	c
'll	c

Dear	c
Mrs.	c
Ryan	c

You	c
ought	c
to	c
know	c
that	c
is	i
possible	c
to	i
me	c
to	c
go	c
there	c
only	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
I	c
'm	c
going	c
to	c
work	c
the	c
whole	c
August	i
.	c

Providing	c
that	c
you	c
give	c
me	c
the	c
chance	c
to	c
chose	c
two	c
activities	c
I	i
would	c
love	c
to	c
do	c
swimming	c
and	c
singing	c
.	c

Where	c
will	c
we	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
wash	c
our	c
clothes	c
during	c
the	c
camp	c
?	c

Do	c
n't	c
hesitate	c
to	c
contact	c
me	c
for	i
any	c
more	c
question	i

Angeles	c

Nowadays	c
shopping	c
is	c
considered	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
most	c
usual	c
and	c
enjoyable	c
activities	c
,	c
especially	c
if	c
you	c
are	c
a	c
woman	c
and	c
you	c
are	c
out	c
to	c
buy	c
clothes	c
.	c

Basing	c
my	c
opinion	c
on	c
my	c
experience	c
I	i
'm	c
going	c
to	c
talk	c
mostly	c
about	c
clothes	c
shopping	c
.	c

There	c
are	c
some	c
points	c
that	c
give	i
me	i
the	i
reason	i
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
who	c
is	c
your	c
companion	c
?	c

In	i
the	c
other	c
,	c
you	c
have	c
always	c
to	c
count	c
on	c
unfriendly	c
shop	c
assistants	c
,	c
no	i
size	i
for	c
you	c
or	c
too	c
high	c
prices	c
.	c

Who	c
would	c
talk	c
now	c
about	c
enjoyable	c
shopping	c
journeys	i
?	c

I	c
'm	c
sure	c
there	c
would	c
be	c
plenty	c
of	c
people	c
ready	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
.	c

The	c
first	c
thing	c
was	c
,	i
that	c
it	c
started	c
45	c
minutes	c
late	c
.	c

There	c
was	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
and	c
he	c
was	c
really	c
bad	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
advertisement	c
you	c
wrote	c
that	c
discounts	c
are	c
available	c
but	c
they	c
were	c
n't	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
so	c
disappointed	c
!	c

I	c
wanted	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
pleasant	c
evening	c
while	c
I	c
'm	c
here	c
in	c
London	c
for	c
a	c
week	c
's	c
holiday	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
ask	c
you	c
sincearly	i
for	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
becaus	i
it	c
was	c
n't	c
a	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

I	c
told	c
her	c
that	c
my	c
parents	c
are	c
getting	c
divorsed	i
and	c
that	c
I	c
will	c
move	c
to	c
Chicago	c
with	c
my	c
mother	c
.	c

One	c
day	c
,	c
Pat	c
and	c
I	c
were	c
going	c
home	c
,	c
when	c
she	c
asked	c
me	c
,	i
if	c
I	c
will	i
give	c
a	c
party	c
befor	i
I	i
'll	i
go	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
,	c

We	c
are	c
all	c
extremely	c
excited	c
especially	i
because	c
of	c
the	c
trip	c
to	c
Greenwich	c
,	c
the	c
town	c
we	c
were	i
always	i
interested	c
in	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
in	i
the	c
time	c
of	c
our	c
visit	c
there	c
is	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
"	c
The	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
"	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
a	c
coinsidence	i
which	c
we	c
would	c
be	c
extremely	c
happy	c
to	c
take	c
advantage	c
on	i
.	c

This	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
for	c
us	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
latest	c
fashions	c
and	c
famous	c
fashion	c
models	c
who	c
we	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
have	c
authograps	i
from	c
.	c

We	c
hope	c
changing	c
the	c
excursion	c
program	i
a	c
little	c
will	c
not	c
cause	c
any	c
problems	c
.	c

The	c
show	c
starts	c
on	c
14th	c
March	c
at	c
10.00	c
and	c
ends	c
at	c
19.00	c
the	c
same	c
day	c
.	c

We	c
are	c
sorry	c
for	c
any	c
inconvenience	c
caused	c
by	c
our	c
request	c
.	c

The	c
biggest	c
commercial	c
gain	i
in	c
history	c
I	i
believe	c
,	c
but	c
celebrities	c
are	c
not	c
animals	c
although	c
they	c
may	c
be	c
sometimes	c
treated	c
the	c
same	c
way	c
.	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
I	c
believe	c
that	c
everyone	c
has	c
the	c
right	c
to	c
keep	i
privacy	i
of	c
their	c
own	c
homes	c
and	c
even	c
someone	c
extremely	c
famous	c
deserve	i
to	c
have	c
a	c
private	c
life	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
as	c
long	c
as	c
their	c
private	c
life	c
is	c
interesting	c
for	c
ordinary	c
people	c
and	c
it	c
brings	c
commercial	c
gain	c
to	c
publishers	c
,	c
journalists	c
and	c
photographers	c
,	c
famous	c
people	c
will	c
just	c
have	c
to	c
get	c
use	i
to	c
this	c
living	c

microscope	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
:	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
I	c
would	i
let	c
you	c
know	c

Also	c
I	c

to	c
choose	c
from	c
your	c
list	c
:	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c

others	i
sports	i
I	i
am	i
not	i

at	c
the	c
moment	c
,	c
and	c

painting	c
and	c
photography	c
very	c
good	i
at	c
the	i
school	c
.	c

Finally	c

studies	c
,	c
everything	c

He	c
was	c
really	c

and	c
friendly	c
but	c
really	c
what	c
I	c
really	c
most	i
enjoyed	i
of	i
it	c
,	i
was	c
when	c
he	c
invited	c

we	c
had	c
thirty-minutes	i
break	c

,	c

My	c
name	c
is	c

.	c
.	c

Actually	c
.	i

When	c
we	c
came	i
the	i
administration	c
of	c
the	c
theatre	c
said	c
that	c
discounts	c
are	c
not	c
available	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
May	c
,	i
15	c
-	c
our	c
english	i
teacher	c
's	c
birthday	c
.	c

There	c
were	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
proposals	c
from	c
the	c
students	c
:	c
one	c
proposed	i
a	c
vase	c
,	c
another	c
-	i
a	c
good	c
pen	c
(	c
he	c
said	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
useful	c
for	c
the	c
teacher	c
)	c
.	c

But	c
we	c
decided	c
to	c
buy	c
a	c
picture	c
,	c
because	c
she	c
has	i
always	i
told	i
us	c
about	c
art	c
galleries	c
with	c
a	i
great	c
exitement	i
.	c

That	c
's	c
why	c
he	c
disappointed	c
Marion	c
and	c
us	c
.	c

Dear	c
the	i
manager	c

I	c
went	c
to	c
see	c
a	c
musical	c
show	c
last	c
Wednesday	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
somebody	c
else	c
.	c

The	c
show	c
supposted	i
to	c
start	c
at	c
19.30	c
pm	c
but	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
20.15	c
pm.	c
It	c
was	c
very	c
late	c
.	c

We	c
had	c
to	c
wait	c
nearly	c
an	c
hour	c
.	c

Staff	c
did	c
not	c
tell	c
us	c
why	c
it	c
started	c
late	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
bought	c
tickets	c
,	c
they	c
did	i
not	i
discount	i
at	c
all	c
.	c

They	c
ignored	c
me	c
.	c

It	c
closed	c
at	c
11	c
pm.	c
It	c
was	c
not	c
our	c
fault	c
that	c
we	c
went	c
in	c
after	c
11	c
pm.	c
The	c
show	c
finished	c
late	c
.	c

The	c
restaurant	c
should	c
open	i
until	c
the	c
show	c
finish	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Yours	c
sinecerely	i

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

She	c
is	c
one	c
of	c
my	c
friend	i
at	c
school	c
.	c

She	c
is	c
very	c
nice	c
,	c
clever	c
,	c
polite	c
and	c
friendly	c
.	c

Everybody	c
love	i
her	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
have	c
any	c
problems	c
,	c
she	c
can	c
give	c
you	c
some	c
suggestion	i
.	c

She	c
always	c
tells	c
someone	c
else	c
about	c
it	c
.	c

Last	c
week	c
,	c
Tim	c
told	c
Pat	c
about	c
his	c
serious	c
problem	c
.	c

He	c
wanted	c
Pat	c
to	c
keep	c
it	c
between	c
them	c
but	c
Pat	c
did	c
not	c
keep	c
his	i
promise	c
.	c

She	c
told	c
us	c
about	c
it	c
.	c

When	c
Tim	c
found	c
out	c
that	c
we	c
knew	c
his	c
problem	c
and	c
tried	i
to	c
help	c
him	c
.	c

He	c
was	i
n't	i
talk	c
to	c
Pat	c
at	c
all	c
.	c

Basically	c
,	c
Tim	c
did	c
not	c
know	c
that	c
Pat	c
was	c
not	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

We	c
so	i
worry	i
about	c
her	c
in	i
the	i
future	c
.	c

She	c
has	c
not	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
friend	i
because	c
of	c
this	c
point	i
.	c

I	c
knew	c
,	i
I	c
would	c
not	c
come	c
this	i
world	c
again	c
,	c
everyone	c
has	c
only	c
one	c
change	i
to	c
do	c
whatever	c
they	c
want	c

I	c
come	c
from	c
very	i
ruler	i
family	c
.	c

I	c
was	i
saving	i
my	c
pocket	c
money	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
age	i
15	i
.	c

I	c
had	c
seen	c
her	c
every	c
morning	c
while	i
I	c
was	c
going	c
to	c
school	c
.	c

She	c
had	i
invited	i
me	c
her	i
play	c
to	i
the	c
theatre	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
went	c
to	i
her	i
play	i
to	i
see	i
,	c
I	c
realy	i
would	c
love	c
to	c
be	c
a	i
actress	c
.	c

I	c
had	i
had	i
a	i
exam	c
for	c
being	i
theatre	c
players	i
without	c
saying	i
my	c
family	c
.	c

Otherwise	c
my	c
father	c
could	i
kill	i
me	c
and	c
not	c
let	c
me	c
to	i
go	i
to	c
school	c

Now	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
theatre	c
actress	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
my	c
dream	c
I	i
wish	c
my	c
dady	i

I	c
am	c
shocked	c
that	c
I	c
won	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
this	c
competition	c
.	c

The	c
reason	c
is	c
that	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
full-time	c
student	c
on	i
Cracow	c
University	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
many	c
exams	c
at	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
semester	i
,	c
which	c
is	c
in	c
June	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
that	c
it	c
is	c
not	c
a	c
problem	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
you	c
to	c
know	c
that	c
I	c
prefer	c
a	c
tent	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
much	c
better	c
than	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
.	c

Aspecially	i
in	c
the	c
summer	c
when	c
tempereture	i
and	c
humidity	c
are	c
very	c
high	c

I	c
am	c
waiting	c
for	c
your	c
reply	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Dear	c
Kim	c

I	c
know	c
that	c
you	c
're	c
waiting	c
for	c
any	c
information	c
about	c
a	i
concert	c
.	c

I	c
love	c
his	c
music	c
and	c
I	c
collect	c
his	c
albums	c
so	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
happy	c
that	c
I	c
helped	c
his	c
crew	c
.	c

Our	c
job	c
was	c
to	c
prepare	c
the	c
scene	i
.	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
totally	c
new	c
experience	c
for	c
me	c
and	c
a	c
real	c
pleasure	c
of	i
working	c
with	c
professionalists	i
.	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
hard	c
and	c
complicated	c
job	c
but	c
we	c
all	c
had	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
satisfaction	c
during	c
the	c
concert	c
.	c

Even	c
Mr.	c
Sting	c
came	c
to	c
us	c
to	c
thank	c
for	i
our	c
help	c
.	c

Dear	c
Ms	c
Clark	c
,	c

I	c
think	c
International	i
Arts	c
Festival	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
idea	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
there	c
with	c
my	c
boyfriend	c
.	c

For	c
me	c
-	c
dances	i
shows	c
were	c
absolutelly	i
wonderful	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
there	c
were	c
no	c
Spanish	c
dancers	c
.	c

Maybe	c
next	c
year	c
?	c

We	c
also	c
listened	c
to	c
the	c
concerts	c
but	c
in	c
our	c
opinion	c
the	c
concert	c
halls	c
were	c
too	c
small	c
.	c

My	c
boyfriend	c
was	c
exciting	i
about	c
the	c
art	c
exhibitions	c
and	c
listening	c
to	c
the	c
writers	c
.	c

He	c
was	c
happy	c
because	c
he	c
was	c
able	c
to	c
talk	c
to	c
them	c
in	c
person	c
.	c

I	c
suggest	c
to	i
organize	i
next	i
IAF	c
in	c
the	c
summer	c
.	c

We	c
have	c
more	c
free	c
time	c
in	c
the	c
summer	c
.	c

Dear	c
Monte	c
,	c

They	c
're	c
horrible	c
.	c

Our	c
lessons	c
start	c
at	c
8	c
a.m	i
and	c
we	c
are	c
n't	c
allowed	c
to	c
be	c
late	c
.	c

We	c
have	c
to	c
change	c
our	c
shoes	c
.	c

Fortunately	c
we	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
to	c
wear	c
the	i
school	c
uniforms	c
.	c

Most	c
of	i
studenst	i
wear	c
jeans	c
and	c
sweaters	i
.	c

We	c
have	c
to	c
be	c
quiet	c
during	c
the	i
lessons	c
and	c
our	c
lessons	c
are	c
boring	c
because	c
of	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
leave	c
my	c
books	c
at	c
school	c
.	c

There	c
's	c
always	c
much	c
to	c
do	c
so	c
we	c
have	c
no	c
free	c
time	c
at	c
all	c
.	c

On	c
Sundays	c
we	c
have	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
bed	c
early	c
because	c
on	c
Monday	c
our	c
school	c
starts	c
at	c
8	c
in	c
the	c
morning	c
.	c

We	c
sometimes	c
help	c
in	c
the	c
house	c
but	c
it	c
is	c
n't	c
neccessary	i
.	c

We	c
are	c
n't	c
allowed	c
to	c
argue	c
with	c
our	c
parents	c
and	c
teachers	c
It	i
is	c
also	c
horrible	c
.	c

I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
change	c
it	i
.	c

Dear	c
:	i
Jane	c
Clark	c

Most	c
of	c
the	c
events	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
were	c
good	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
feel	c
that	c
the	c
festival	c
could	c
be	c
even	c
better	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

The	c
idea	c
of	c
"	i
International	c
Art	c
Festival	c
"	c
was	c
great	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
you	c
should	c
invite	c
more	c
than	c
ten	c
countries	c
.	c

The	c
other	c
problem	c
was	c
choosing	i
space	i
.	c

The	c
Dance	c
Shows	c
as	c
well	c
.	c

And	c
the	c
offer	c
of	c
"	i
weedend	i
ticket	c
"	c
was	c
an	c
excellent	c
idea	c
.	c

Because	c
the	i
price	i
was	i
cheaper	i
than	i
buy	i
it	i
sperate	i
and	i
more	i
convience	i
.	c

Yours	c
Sinicerely	i
,	c

One	c
day	c
,	c
a	c
little	c
girls	i
called	c
Sara	c
.	c

Sara.	c
.	c

look	c
down	c
to	c
the	c
river.	c
"	c

After	c
a	c
few	c
second	i
,	c
Sara	c
felt	c
that	c
golden	i
fish	c
was	c
lovely	c
.	c

She	c
never	i
seen	i
any	c
fish	c
had	i
that	c
wonderful	c
colour	c
and	c
can	i
talk	c
with	c
her	c
.	c

Therefore	c
,	c
she	c
came	c
river	i
everyday	i
and	c
talk	i
everything	i
to	i
the	c
golden	c
fish	c
.	c

They	c
were	c
very	c
close	c
friend	i
.	c

Sara	c
was	c
very	c
sad	c
.	c

look	c
at	c
me.	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
stand	i
on	c
your	c
left	i
hand	i
side	c

Sara	c
remembered	c
the	c
was	i
golden	c
fish	c
.	c

She	i
suddenly	i
become	i
a	i
human	c

a	c
little	c
boy	c

Both	i
together	i
had	i

wonderful	i
life	i

Dear	c
Jane	c
Clark	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
about	c
International	i
Arts	c
Festival	c
which	i
I	c
went	c
to	c
recently	c
.	c

In	c
spite	c
of	c
having	c
a	c
great	c
time	c
,	c
there	c
were	c
some	c
things	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
my	c
opinion	c
about	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
be	c
grateful	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
consider	c
my	c
opinion	c
above	i
,	i

Hello	c
.	c

I	c
've	c
been	i
also	i
considering	i
rules	c
at	c
home	c
with	c
my	c
friends	c
.	c

Is	c
n't	c
it	c
quite	c
interesting	c
to	c
talk	c
about	c
rules	c
?	c

At	c
home	c
I	c
'm	c
not	c
allowed	c
to	c
talk	c
on	c
the	c
phone	c
more	c
than	c
ten	c
minutes	c
,	c
which	c
annoys	c
me	c
very	c
much	c
.	c

I	c
really	c
want	c
to	c
change	c
this	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
we	c
're	c
allowed	c
to	c
drive	c
a	c
car	c
to	c
school	c
,	c
which	c
is	c
quite	c
unusual	i
rule	c
in	c
Japanese	i
school	c
because	c
students	c
might	c
crash	c
a	c
car	c
on	c
the	c
way	c
to	c
school	c
or	c
home	c
.	c

I	c
actually	c
love	c
this	c
rule	c
because	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
to	c
get	c
up	c
early	c
if	c
I	c
have	c
a	c
car	c
.	c

They	c
have	c
to	c
cut	c
their	c
hair	c
once	c
a	c
month	c
.	c

I	c
wish	c
I	c
could	c
change	c
this	c
rule	c
.	c

Best	c
wishes	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
in	c
response	c
to	c
the	c
letter	c
,	c
which	c
I	c
had	i
yesterday	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
afraid	c
that	c
I	c
am	c
available	c
to	c
travel	c
only	c
on	i
July	c
.	c

Because	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
work	c
all	c
year	c
except	c
one	c
month	i
holiday	c
on	i
July	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
be	i
appreciate	c
if	i
I	c
could	c
stay	c
in	c
log	c
cabins	c
at	c
Camp	c
.	c

I	c
feel	c
that	c
it	i
would	c
be	c
fabulos	i
places	c
with	c
western	i
design	c
.	c

Most	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
really	c
interested	c
in	c
doing	c
two	c
activities	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
Tennis	c
.	c

As	c
well	c
as	c
that	c
,	c
I	c
wonder	c
if	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
some	c
money	c
for	c
extra	c
activities	c
and	c
few	i
more	c
things	c
.	i

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
time	i
and	c
attention	c
.	c

yours	c
sincerely	c

Kim	c

There	c
was	c
a	c
meeting	c
to	c
talk	c
about	c
a	c
video	c
about	c
daily	c
life	c
at	c
our	c
school	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
thought	c
that	c
a	c
normal	c
,	c
regular	c
lesson	c
,	c
3	c
optional	c
lessons	c
and	c
a	c
great	c
deal	c
of	c
activities	c
should	c
be	c
filmed	c
.	c

Refering	i
to	c
optional	c
lessons	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
recommended	c
that	c
Speaking	c
and	c
listening	c
,	c
Computer	c
and	c
Business	c
English	c
are	c
suitable	c
for	c
filming	c
.	c

It	c
can	c
show	c
how	c
much	c
students	c
are	i
enjoying	i
their	c
life	c
in	c
our	c
school	c
.	c

As	c
well	c
as	c
that	c
,	c
if	c
we	c
filmed	c
famous	c
students	c
and	c
teachers	c
in	c
our	c
school	c
,	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
fantastic	c
video	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
students	c
can	c
learn	c
English	c
from	c
wide	c
activities	c
as	c
well	c
as	c
lessons	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
give	c
my	c
opinions	c
about	c
the	c
annual	c
International	c
Arts	c
Festival	c
I	c
have	c
visited	i
.	c

It	c
gives	c
an	c
opportunity	c
to	c
get	c
acquainted	c
with	c
the	c
cultures	i
'	i
variety	c
of	c
the	c
whole	c
world	c
.	c

Whereas	c
an	i
advertisement	c
promised	c
stars	c
from	c
around	c
the	c
world	c
.	c

Another	c
disadvatage	i
of	c
the	c
festival	c
's	c
programme	c
was	c
lack	i
of	c
plays	c
and	c
films	c
which	c
are	c
the	c
best	c
to	i
display	c
the	i
modern	c
county	i
's	i
culture	c
.	i

I	c
hope	c
there	c
will	c
be	c
more	c
of	c
them	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

All	c
the	c
guests	c
were	c
offered	c
a	c
weekend	c
ticket	c
for	c
all	c
events	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
reasonable-priced	i
.	c

In	c
conclusuon	i
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
in	c
spite	c
of	c
the	c
success	c
of	c
the	c
festival	c
some	c
improvements	c
still	c
can	c
be	c
done	i
.	c

The	c
programme	c
can	i
be	i
also	i
improved	c
by	c
adding	c
new	c
categories	c
such	c
as	c
folk	c
songs	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
kind	c
attention	c
.	c

Sincerely	c
yours	c
,	c

Fortunatelly	i
,	c
there	c
are	c
many	c
ways	c
to	c
earn	c
some	c
money	c
nowadays	c
.	c

Of	c
course	c
,	c
young	c
people	c
can	c
work	c
only	c
in	c
their	c
spare	c
time	c
.	c

This	c
job	c
does	c
n't	c
demand	c
much	c
abilities	i
,	c
but	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
patience	c
though	c
.	c

This	c
job	c
requires	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
energy	c
however	i
.	c

But	c
you	c
can	c
earn	c
more	c
.	c

But	c
if	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
like	c
children	c
and	c
are	c
not	c
easy-going	c
enough	c
to	c
work	c
as	c
a	c
waiter	c
you	c
may	c
chose	i
a	i
more	c
pieceful	i
job	c
of	c
a	c
typist	c
at	c
home	c
.	c

There	c
are	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
people	c
not	c
willing	c
to	c
type	c
essays	c
and	c
reports	c
themselves	c
or	c
just	c
not	c
having	c
a	c
computer	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
you	c
can	c
help	c
them	c
and	c
earn	c
quiete	i
enough	i
.	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
there	c
is	c
no	c
problem	c
without	c
a	c
solution	c
and	c
if	c
you	c
are	c
an	c
active	c
and	c
broad-minded	c
person	c
,	c
you	c
will	c
surely	c
find	c
a	c
way	c
to	c
earn	c
money	c
even	c
in	c
Arctic	i
.	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

For	i
the	c
accommodation	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
can	i
not	i
sleep	c
in	c
tent	i
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
weather	i
is	c
very	c
hot	c
and	c
that	c
the	c
nights	c
are	c
not	c
cold	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
do	c
not	c
know	c
if	c
I	c
must	c
take	c
lot	i
of	c
pullovers	c
.	c

Best	c

"	c
Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
"	c
is	c
a	c
statement	c
of	i
men	c
in	c
general	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
men	c
prefer	c
to	c
do	c
sports	c
,	c
because	c
the	i
shopping	c
loses	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
time	c
controry	i
to	i
women	i
,	c
because	c
if	c
they	c
have	c
a	i
free	c
time	c
,	c
they	c
will	c
go	c
to	i
do	i
shopping	c

He	i
goes	i
to	i
do	i
shopping	c
only	c
if	c
he	i
has	i
not	i
clothes	i
.	c

To	c
conclude	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
"	c
Shopping	c

not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
"	c

a	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
express	i
my	i
enjoyment	i
that	c
I	c
had	c
at	c
the	c
International	c
Arts	c
Festival	c
the	i
next	i
week	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
this	c
festival	c
is	c
really	c
good	c
and	c
I	c
hope	c
it	c
will	c
have	i
every	c
year	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
the	c
attractions	i
were	i
beautiful	i
such	i
as	i
shows	i
,	i
exhibitions	i
and	i
concerts	i
.	c

I	c
liked	c
all	c
the	c
different	c
kind	i
of	c
atmosphere	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
the	c
plays	c
and	c
movies	c
were	c
marvellous	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
disappointed	c
by	c
the	c
number	c
of	c
that	i
.	c

It	c
will	i
be	c
great	c
if	c
there	c
were	c
would	i
have	i
more	c
choice	c
the	i
next	c
year	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
will	i
be	c
interested	c
in	c
meet	i
artists	c
from	c
everywhere	c
in	c
the	c
world	c
not	c
only	c
Europeen	i
artists	c
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
an	c
unforgetable	i
time	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
eat	c
some	c
different	c
kind	c
of	c
foods	i
,	c
if	c
it	i
is	c
possible	c
.	c

Dear	c
Monique	c
,	c

In	i
fact	i
,	c
at	c
school	c
we	c
have	c
n't	c
so	c
many	c
rules	c
.	c

Of	c
course	c
,	c
we	c
must	c
respect	c
the	c
teacher	c
and	c
do	c
what	c
he	c
says	c
.	c

I	c
ca	c
n't	c
remember	c
,	c
because	c
now	c
I	c
'm	c
19	c
,	c
then	i
I	c
can	c
do	c
what	c
I	c
want	c
.	c

I	c
want	i
to	i
change	i
nothing	i
,	i
I	c
was	c
happy	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madame	i
,	c

I	c
must	c
say	c
that	c
your	c
musical	c
show	c
was	c
very	c
disappointing	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
I	i
expected	c
to	c
see	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
saw	c
different	i
actor	c
and	c
that	c
was	c
big	i
disappointment	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

Secondly	c
the	i
show	c
started	c
at	c
quarter	c
past	c
eight	c
.	c

This	c
is	c
fourty-five	i
minutes	i
delay	c
.	c

Out	i
the	c
end	c
your	i
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
from	i
unknown	c
reasons	c
,	c
but	c
on	i
an	i
advertisement	c
was	i
clearly	c
sign	i
:	c

"	c
Visit	c
our	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
"	c
.	c

I	c
will	c
be	c
very	c
pleased	c
if	c
so	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Twentieth	i
century	c
was	c
a	c
century	c
of	c
inventions	c
.	c

Often	c
people	c
do	c
not	c
see	c
how	c
it	c
effects	i
our	c
life	i
style	i
.	c

Useful	c
things	c
like	c
TV	c
sets	c
,	c
radios	c
,	c
computers	c
,	c
Hi-Fi	i
stereos	c
and	c
cars	c
-	c
we	c
are	c
dealing	c
with	c
them	c
every	c
day	c
.	c

They	c
help	c
us	c
with	c
daily	c
life	c
and	c
make	c
it	c
more	c
pleasant	c
.	c

We	c
know	c
our	c
world	c
from	c
TV	c
screens	c
and	c
computer	c
monitors	c
.	c

On	i
the	i
second	i
hand	i
people	c
are	c
suffering	c
from	c
modern	c
diseases	c
like	c
addiction	c
to	c
television	c
or	c
computers	c
.	c

It	c
saves	c
our	c
lives	c
from	c
ancient	c
and	c
modern	c
diseases	c
.	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
modern	i
technology	c
changed	c
our	c
daily	c
life	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
questioning	i
myselfs	i
-	c
am	c
I	c
sick	i
man	c
?	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	i
some	c
informations	i
about	c
the	c
advertisement	c
of	i
the	c
show	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
why	c
the	i
show	c
began	i
at	c
20:15	c
,	c
not	c
at	c
19:30	c
as	c
indicated	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
.	c

I	c
waited	c
quite	i
one	c
hour	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
and	c
what	c
happened	c
with	c
the	c
actor	c
?	c

I	c
came	c
to	c
that	c
show	c
only	c
for	i
see	i
him	c
and	c
when	c
the	c
actor	c
appear	i
,	c
it	c
was	c
another	c
one	c
.	c

The	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
there	c
was	c
n't	c
electricity	i
you	i
should	c
close	c
the	c
theatre	c
untill	i
the	c
restaurant	c
get	i
appropriate	i
to	i
use	i
.	c

I	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
read	i
my	c
letter	c
,	i
I	c
hope	c
you	c
write	c
for	i
me	i
back	i
,	c
and	c
do	c
n't	c
forget	c
my	c
money	c
!	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
what	c
I	c
think	c
what	i
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
will	i
people	i
wear	c
100	c
years	c
from	c
now	c
.	i

As	c
we	c
see	c
the	i
clothes	i
are	c
changing	c
every	c
hour	c
.	c

In	c
each	c
country	c
,	c
each	c
people	c
wear	i
differents	i
kinds	c
of	c
clothes	c
,	c
like	i
,	c
people	c
in	c
Brazil	c
wear	c
shorts	c
,	c
T-shirts	c
or	c
only	i
without	c
them	c
,	i
in	c
Saudi	c
Arabian	c
they	c
wear	c
strange	c
clothes	c
,	c
if	c
you	c
analyse	c
the	i
point	c
of	c
view	c
who	i
does	c
n't	c
live	c
in	c
Saudi	c
Arabia	c
.	c

Dear	c
misses	i
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
'm	c
surprised	c
to	c
read	c
that	c
I	c
've	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
.	c

I	c
've	c
got	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
work	c
and	c
my	c
boss	c
did	i
n't	i
allowed	i
me	c
to	c
leave	c
my	c
job	i
any	i
other	c
time	c
.	c

I	c
prefer	i
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
because	c
it	c
's	c
more	c
like	c
a	c
camp	c
.	c

I	c
chose	i
painting	c
and	c
photography	c
.	c

I	c
like	c
painting	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
talent	c
,	i
I	c
could	c
paint	c
all	c
the	i
day	c
.	c

I	c
take	c
very	c
good	c
photos	c
!	c

I	c
would	i
ask	c
you	c
about	c
clothes	c
and	c
money	c
.	c

And	c
what	c
about	c
money	c
?	c

And	c
for	c
food	c
,	c
drinks	c
etc	c
?	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
hearing	i
news	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Yours	c

We	c
people	c
are	c
often	c
depressed	c
or	c
have	i
stress	i
.	c

What	c
are	i
we	i
doing	i
then	c
?	c

We	c
go	c
shopping	c
.	c

That	c
makes	i
often	i
women	c
feel	c
better	c
.	c

They	c
go	c
out	c
with	c
friends	c
or	c
alone	c
.	c

A	c
friend	c
of	c
mine	c
was	c
depressed	c
because	c
her	c
friend	i
leave	i
her	c
.	c

She	c
phone	i
me	c
and	c
asked	c
me	c
what	i
about	c
going	c
shopping	c
.	c

We	c
were	i
lucky	c
that	c
we	c
are	c
in	i
life	i
now	c
.	c

But	c
you	c
can	c
be	c
carefull	i
when	c
you	c
speak	c
with	c
him	i
or	c
her	i
that	i
will	i
stolen	i
your	c
thinks	i
.	c

Dear	c
Ms.	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
'll	c
have	c
to	c
pass	i
several	c
exams	c
in	c
June	c
,	i
in	i
August	c
my	c
family	c
going	i
to	c
visit	c
our	c
relatives	c
in	c
Austria	c
.	c

I	c
am	i
really	i
enjoying	i
swimming	c
.	c

Far	i
the	c
best	c
swimmer	c
in	c
my	c
school	c
.	c

I	c
like	c
taking	c
pictures	c
and	c
want	c
to	c
share	c
my	c
interest	c
with	c
the	i
others	c
.	c

Finally	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
some	c
questions	c
.	c

What	c
will	c
be	c
better	i
to	c
take	c
with	c
me	c
,	c
what	c
I	i
'll	i
need	c
at	c
Camp	c
?	c

How	c
much	c
money	c
should	c
I	c
take	c
,	i
will	i
it	i
be	c
any	c
guided	c
tours	c
?	c

Hope	c
to	c
hear	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	i

She	c
will	i
prefer	i
shopping	c
to	c
everything	c
else	c
.	c

She	c
thinks	c
that	c
it	c
is	c
the	c
most	c
pleasant	c
spending	i
of	i
time	c
,	c
when	c
you	c
going	i
from	c
one	c
shop	c
to	c
another	c
,	c
watching	c
other	c
people	c
,	c
looking	c
at	c
beautiful	c
clothes	c
,	c
getting	c
some	c
fashionable	c
ideas	c
.	c

And	c
it	i
's	i
so	c
many	c
people	c
like	c
her	c
.	c

Not	c
so	c
many	c
people	c
thinking	i
about	c
going	c
fishing	c
or	c
playing	c
sport	i
games	c
with	c
their	c
families	c
any	c
more	c
.	c

They	c
forgot	i
how	c
beautiful	c
could	i
be	i
the	i
countryside	i
,	c
and	c
only	i
tourists	i
you	i
can	i
meet	i
in	c
the	c
castles	c
or	c
museums	c
.	c

People	c
are	i
not	i
smiling	i
to	i
each	c
other	c
,	c
not	i
talking	i
to	c
each	c
other	c
at	c
the	c
shops	c
.	c

They	c
look	c
like	c
a	i
robotes	i
who	c
have	c
to	c
do	c
their	c
duties	i
-	c
to	c
buy	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
shopping	c
is	c
just	c
to	i
cover	c
our	c
basic	c
needs	c
.	c

It	c
feels	c
much	c
more	i
better	c
.	c

Dear	c
Ms	c
Ryan	c

I	c
'm	c
so	c
happy	c
to	c
received	i
your	c
letter	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
tell	i
you	c
the	c
information	c
you	c
need	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
the	c
travel	i
start	i
only	i
july	i
if	c
possible	c
,	i
because	i
this	c
is	c
my	c
Hoilday	i
start	i
,	i
at	c
the	c
Camp	c
California	c
I	i
would	c
like	c
my	c
accommodation	i
in	c
tents	i
,	c
because	c
I	c
work	c
in	c
Army	i
and	c
in	i
the	c
camp	c
I	c
usually	c
stay	c
in	c
tent	i
at	c
night	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
will	c
feel	c
more	c
comfortable	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
video	c
I	c
think	c
we	c
should	c
take	c
part	i
to	c
talk	c
about	c
,	i
what	c
we	c
doing	i
in	c
feel	i
time	c
and	c
study	c
period	i
.	c

This	c
is	c
another	c
important	c
part	c
of	c
our	c
school	c
life	c
,	c
and	c
we	c
should	c
make	i
a	c
section	c
to	i
talk	i
about	c
lunch	c
and	c
where	i
are	i
the	i
people	i
go	i
to	i
eat	i
their	i
lunch	i
or	i
what	i
they	i
do	i
?	i

After	c
we	c
talk	c
about	c
lunch	c
,	c
we	c
should	c
take	i
about	c
activities	i
we	c
are	c
doing	c
and	c
the	i
systems	i
about	i
the	i
activities	i
in	i
school	i
or	i
outside	i
school	i
and	i
make	i
a	i
little	i
section	i
of	i
the	i
School	i
term	i
,	i
and	i
what	i
kind	i
of	i
sport	i
the	i
people	i
like	i
the	i
most	i
.	c

Dear	c
Jane	c
Clark	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
great	i
idea	c
to	c
have	c
a	i
this	c
kind	c
of	c
festival	c
.	c

I	c
enjoyed	c
it	c
so	c
much	c
.	c

There	c
were	c
stars	c
and	c
artists	c
from	c
only	c
six	c
countries	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
actually	c
liked	c
Jazz	i
,	c
rock	c
and	c
classical	c
concerts	c
very	c
much	c
.	c

thirdly	i
.	i

I	c
would	c

to	i
you	c
to	c
consider	c
about	i
having	c
more	c
plays	c
and	c
films	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

It	c
would	c
be	c
nicer	c
.	c

Otherwise	c
,	c
the	c
price	c
was	c
really	c
reasonable	c
for	c
all	c
:events	i
the	i
weekend	i
.	c

And	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c

Yours	c

It	c
's	c

.	c

It	c
's	c
quite	c
interesting	c
.	c

We	c
have	c
quite	c
strict	c
rules	c

When	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
student	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
n't	c
allowed	c
to	c
wear	c
any	c
fashionable	c
clothes	c

Only	i
It	i
was	i
like	i
a	i
formal	i
clothes	i
.	i

At	c
home	c
.	c

There	c
is	c
one	c
thing	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
change	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
not	c
allowed	c
to	c
sleep	c
at	c
my	c
friend	c
's	c
house	c
.	c

I	c
really	c
like	c
chatting	c
all	c
night	c
with	c
my	c
friends	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
it	i
.	c

The	c
school	c
rules	c
in	c
my	c
country	c
are	c
more	c
strict	c
than	c
your	i
country	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
want	c
to	c
know	c
about	c
something	c
of	c
our	c
country	c

I	c
'm	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
so	c
excited	c
by	c
the	c
news	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
I	c
can	c
take	c
this	c
opportunity	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
I	c
run	c
my	c
shop	c
all	c
year	c
round	c
except	c
three	c
weeks	c
in	c
July	c
.	c

Besides	c
golf	c
,	c
taking	c
wonderful	c
photographs	c
of	c
sceneries	i
has	c
been	c
my	c
dream	c
,	c
even	c
though	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
beginner	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
going	c
on	c
this	c
fantastic	c
holiday	c
.	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

My	c
classmate	c
Cecilia	c
persuaded	c
me	c
to	c
try	c
whole	i
new	c
experience	c
of	c
helping	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
.	c

I	c
thought	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
the	c
last	c
thing	c
I	c
wanted	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
.	c

I	c
've	c
really	c
enjoyed	c
this	c
opportunity	c
.	c

We	c
delivered	c
so	c
many	c
fantastic	c
and	c
gorgeous	c
costumes	c
which	c
had	c
been	c
designed	c
exclusively	c
by	c
top	c
designers	c
.	c

The	c
most	c
difficult	c
work	c
was	c
to	c
arrange	c
coach	i
trip	c
to	c
the	c
concert	c
hall	c
as	c
there	c
were	c
many	c
audience	i
from	c
countryside	i
.	c

Of	c
course	c
,	c
I	c
've	c
enjoyed	c
being	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
in	c
response	c
to	c
your	c
advertisment	i
in	c
Today	i
's	i
newspaper	c
.	c

I	c
recently	c
spent	c
two	c
days	c
at	c
the	c
International	c
arts	i
festival	i
and	c
I	c
found	c
it	c
very	c
entertaining	c
.	c

A	c
friend	c
of	c
mine	c
went	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
play	c
"	c
Hamlet	c
"	c
and	c
the	c
film	c
"	c
Gladiators	c
"	c
.	c

He	c
told	c
me	c
how	c
great	c
it	i
was	i
and	c
I	c
was	c
thinking	c
that	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
a	i
good	c
to	c
have	c
more	c
plays	c
and	c
films	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
to	c
this	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
wondering	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
organize	c
the	c
same	c
festival	c
in	c
sommer	i
.	c

Two	c
sisters	c
,	c
Alex	c
and	c
Daniela	c
were	i
sitting	c
in	c
front	c
of	c
the	c
fireplace	c
thinking	c
of	i
what	c
they	c
could	c
do	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
near	c
Christmas	c
and	c
the	c
two	c
girls	c
had	c
n't	c
found	c
any	i
present	c
for	c
their	c
mother	c
.	c

Alex	c
suggested	c
that	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
good	c
idea	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
city	c
to	c
buy	c
that	c
present	c
.	c

Anyway	c
,	c
Alex	c
was	c
too	c
stubborn	c
to	c
give	c
up	c
and	c
it	c
was	c
like	c
talking	c
to	c
a	c
brick	c
wall	c
:	c
she	c
did	c
n't	c
listen	c
to	c
her	c
sister	c
.	c

After	c
forty	c
minutes	c
,	c
the	c
weather	c
became	c
very	c
bad	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
such	c
a	c
pain	c
to	c
walk	c
in	c
the	c
snow	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
Alex	c
was	c
not	c
worried	c
at	c
all	c
despite	c
the	c
fact	c
that	c
her	c
sister	c
was	c
tired	c
and	c
cold	c
.	c

In	i
deep	i
of	i
herself	c
,	c
Alex	c
knew	c
they	c
were	c
lost	c
in	c
the	c
middle	c
of	c
nowhere	c
,	c
but	c
she	c
did	c
n't	c
want	c
to	c
admit	c
it	c
.	c

Alex	c
began	c
to	c
cry	c
and	c
to	c
pray	c
and	c
when	c
Daniela	c
was	c
about	c
to	c
die	c
an	c
angle	i
appeared	c
.	c

The	c
answer	c
was	c
obvious	c
and	c
the	c
angel	c
saved	c
Daniela.	c
.	i

This	c
story	c
happend	i
a	c
long	c
time	c
ago	c
.	c

For	i
the	c
time	c
that	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
must	i
be	c
on	i
July	c
only	c
.	c

This	c
is	c
because	c
my	c
A-levels	i
exams	c
is	i
coming	c
up	c
so	c
I	c
really	c
need	c
times	i
to	c
revise	c
,	c
and	c
July	c
is	c
the	c
only	c
month	i
and	i
time	i
that	c
I	c
am	c
free	c
.	c

This	c
is	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
my	c
first	c
time	i
to	c
see	c
an	i
outside	c
world	c
by	c
myself	c
so	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
gather	c
up	c
new	c
experiences	c
.	c

Also	c
I	c
tried	i
how	i
to	c
sail	c
before	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
am	c
not	c
perfectly	i
good	c
at	c
it	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
love	i
to	c
sail	c
more	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
about	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
do	i
I	c
need	c
to	c
bring	c
?	i
and	i
the	i
money	c
,	c
do	c
I	c
need	c
much	c
of	c
them	i
?	c

Please	c
,	c
give	c
me	c
a	i
suggestion	i
about	c
these	c
.	i

Your	i
faithfully	c

Dear	c
,	i
Kim	c

How	c
are	c
you	c
?	c

I	c
could	c
n't	c
believed	i
how	c
close	c
I	c
was	c
to	c
the	c
band	c
.	c

People	c
at	i
the	i
backstage	c
including	i
me	c
were	i
helping	c
to	c
clean	c
up	c
all	c
the	c
stuff	c
and	c
ready	i
for	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
the	c
concert	c
.	c

The	i
time	i
has	i
come	i
,	i
when	i
the	c
band	c
finished	c
the	c
concert	c
,	c
we	c
have	i
to	c
served	i
them	c
drinks	c
again	c
and	c
helped	i
to	c
clear	i
up	i
the	c
stage	c
.	c

From	i
this	c
letter	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
sure	c
that	c
you	c
should	i
be	c
able	c
to	c
share	c
this	c
experience	c
with	c
me	c
.	c

My	c
name	c
is	c
Anne	c
Singler	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
already	i
watched	c
the	c
musical	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
"	c
in	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
.	c

In	c
your	c
advert	c
for	c
the	c
musical	c
show	i
you	c
promised	c
the	c
newest	c
and	c
best	c
musical	c
show	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
.	c

First	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
disappointed	c
about	c
the	c
price	c
of	c
the	c
ticket	c
because	c
I	c
expected	c
to	c
pay	c
a	c
smaller	i
pice	i
than	c
£	c
20	c
for	c
my	c
six	i
year	i
old	i
daughter	c
.	c

Then	c
the	c
show	c
already	i
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
and	c
not	c
at	c
19:30	c
!	c

For	c
me	c
the	c
most	c
disappointing	c
problem	c
was	c
that	c
the	c
starring	i
Danny	c
Brook	c
was	c
n't	c
there	c
.	c

The	c
actor	c
which	i
acted	c
instead	c
of	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
was	c
n't	c
as	c
good	c
as	c
Mr.	c
Brook	c
.	c

After	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
which	c
was	c
n't	c
really	c
the	c
best	c
I	c
have	c
ever	c
seen	c
,	c
my	c
family	c
and	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
get	c
some	c
snacks	c
in	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
.	c

When	c
we	c
arrived	c
at	c
the	c
restaurant	c
we	c
had	i
to	i
realize	i
that	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
the	c
cook	c
was	c
ill	c
.	c

After	c
this	c
last	c
point	i
of	i
troubles	i
we	c
went	c
home	c
with	c
only	c
bad	c
remembers	i
of	c
this	c
evening	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
understand	c
my	c
point	c
of	c
view	c
and	c
write	c
back	c
.	c

The	c
secret	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

Pat	c
was	c
really	c
shocked	c
to	c
hear	c
this	c
but	c
she	c
had	c
to	c
promise	c
Sally	c
to	c
keep	c
quiet	c
.	c

Pat	c
really	c
liked	c
chatting	c
about	c
others	c
and	c
so	c
she	c
was	c
n't	c
able	c
to	c
keep	c
quiet	c
about	c
Sally	c
's	c
secret	c
.	c

She	c
told	c
it	c
to	c
her	c
boyfriend	c
Paul	c
.	c

After	c
that	c
Paul	c
got	i
white	c
in	c
his	i
face	c
,	c
he	c
was	c
pale	c
like	c
a	c
wall	c
and	c
it	c
seemed	c
as	i
he	c
would	i
be	i
very	c
nervous	c
.	c

Now	c
Pat	c
realized	c
what	c
was	c
going	c
on	c
and	c
could	c
undstand	i
why	c
her	c
boyfriend	c
got	c
so	c
nervous	c
about	c
the	c
secret	c
.	c

He	c
was	c
Sally	c
's	c
lover	c
!	c

16th	c

Dec.	c
2000	c

Dear	c
Mr.	c
Clark	c
,	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
this	c
letter	c
to	c
complain	c
and	c
to	c
suggest	c
something	c
about	c
your	c
"	c
International	c
Arts	c
Festival	c
"	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
visited	c
the	c
festival	c
,	c
of	c
course	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
really	c
good	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
impressed	c
of	i
the	c
idea	c
of	c
the	c
festival	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
enjoy	c
different	c
culture	i
and	c
also	c
I	c
could	c
expand	c
my	c
knowledge	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
the	c
weekend	c
ticket	c
was	c
fantastic	c
because	c
I	c
spent	c
two	c
days	c
the	i
festival	c
-	c
Saturday	c
and	c
Sunday	c
.	c

The	c
ticket	c
price	c
was	c
not	c
too	c
expensive	c
for	c
student	i
too	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
exaggerated	c
.	c

Except	c
these	i
two	c
things	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
quite	c
good	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
,	c
most	c
of	c
the	c
people	c
in	c
the	c
festival	c
liked	c
that	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
run	c
more	c
plays	c
and	c
films	c
in	c
next	c
year	c
's	c
festival	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

Before	c
that	c
you	i
have	c
to	c
think	c
why	i
you	c
need	c
to	c
earn	c
money	c
and	c
how	c
you	c
do	c
that	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
really	c
important	c
because	c
making	c
money	c
needs	c
a	c
proper	c
purpose	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
did	c
newspaper	c
delivery	c
.	c

I	c
earned	c
easily	c
and	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
control	c
myself	c
at	c
that	c
time	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
only	c
12	c
years	c
old	c
.	c

Also	c
I	c
was	c
leader	c
of	c
the	c
computer	i
user	i
circle	c
in	c
the	c
school	c
so	c
I	c
needed	c
some	c
money	c
for	c
managing	c
the	c
circle	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
also	c
hard	i
and	i
difficult	i
,	c
but	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
was	c
easy	i
way	c
to	c
make	c
money	c
.	c

I	c
forgot	c
many	c
skills	c
and	c
knowledge	c
during	c
the	c
time	c
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
if	c
you	c
want	c
to	c
earn	c
a	c
bit	c
of	c
money	c
,	c
then	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
choose	c
proper	i
part-time	c
job	c
.	c

You	c
must	c
consider	c
the	c
purpose	c
too	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
have	c
n't	c
purpose	i
,	c
you	c
would	i
waste	c
money	c
easily	c
and	c
quickly	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Jane	i
Clark	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
with	c
reference	c
to	c
the	c
International	c
Arts	c
Festival	c
I	i
have	c
recently	c
been	c
to	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
my	c
opinions	c
about	c
it	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
to	c
this	c
some	i
concert	c
halls	c
were	c
too	c
small	c
to	c
host	c
all	c
the	c
people	c
who	c
were	c
there	c
fro	i
the	c
occasion	c
and	c
,	c
personally	c
speaking	c
the	i
show	c
could	c
be	c
done	c
at	i
the	c
open	c
air	c
next	c
year	c
,	c
so	c
that	c
music	i
would	c
also	c
create	c
a	c
fantastic	c
atmosphere	c
all	c
around	c
.	c

Plays	i
and	c
films	c
had	i
a	c
great	c
success	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
if	c
there	c
will	c
be	c
more	c
next	c
year	c
because	c
in	c
my	c
opinion	c
people	c
would	c
appreciate	c
it	c
.	c

The	c
other	c
events	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
,	c
dance	c
shows	c
,	c
art	c
exhibitions	c
and	c
talk	i
by	c
writers	c
,	c
were	c
well	i
organised	i
and	c
extremely	c
interesting	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
the	c
weekend	c
ticket	c
was	c
reasonably-priced	c
and	c
this	c
was	c
excellent	i
decision	c
because	c
it	c
gave	c
the	c
opportunity	c
to	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
people	c
,	c
adults	c
but	c
also	c
students	c
,	c
to	c
take	c
part	c
to	i
the	c
Festival	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

We	c
ca	c
n't	c
talk	c
during	c
lessons	c
and	c
we	c
only	c
have	c
a	c
en	i
minutes	i
break	c
at	c
10.30	c
a.m.	c
If	c
we	c
're	c
late	c
,	c
we	c
have	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
principal	c
and	c
ask	c
for	c
his	c
signature	c
to	i
go	c
to	c
class	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
hard	c
to	c
be	c
extremely	c
quite	i
for	c
five	c
hours	c
but	c
I	c
reckon	c
it	c
's	c
a	c
good	c
way	i
of	c
education	c
.	c

I	c
help	c
doing	c
cleaning	i
or	c
the	c
washing	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
do	c
it	c
because	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
,	c
not	c
because	c
my	c
parents	c
make	c
me	c
do	c
it	c
.	c

Best	c
wishes	c
.	i

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
got	c
summer	i
holidays	c
from	c
July	c
to	c
August	c
and	c
I	c
work	c
as	c
a	c
bank	c
clerk	c
in	c
August	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
been	c
playing	c
basketball	c
for	c
8	c
years	c
and	c
today	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
member	c
of	c
an	c
Austrian	c
basketball-team	i
.	c

At	c
first	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
clean	c
the	c
three	c
private	c
rooms	c
of	c
the	c
stars	c
.	c

This	c
was	c
very	c
boring	c
but	c
after	c
I	c
left	c
the	c
third	c
room	c
I	c
met	c
Brunner	c
and	c
Brunner	c
.	c

O.K.	c
I	c
am	c
just	c
kiding	i
.	c

I	c
also	c
had	c
to	c
clean	c
the	c
washing	i
rooms	i
.	c

I	c
will	c
never	c
ever	c
help	c
anybody	c
to	c
organice	i
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
.	i

But	c
after	c
this	c
serville	i
work	c
I	c
met	c
Eminem	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
greatest	c
moments	c
in	c
my	c
life	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
a	c
nineteen	i
year	i
old	i
gild	i
who	c
is	c
still	c
attending	c
classes	c
at	c
Saint	c
John	c
's	c
School	c
.	c

As	c
far	c
as	c
accommodation	c
is	c
concern	i
,	c
I	c
prefer	c
staying	c
in	c
a	c
long	i
cabin	c
.	c

I	c
believe	c
it	c
is	c
better	c
than	c
a	c
tent	c
because	c
this	i
one	i
would	i
not	i
shelter	i
enough	i
.	c

As	c
I	c
said	c
before	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
playing	c
tennis	c
for	c
four	c
years	c
.	c

It	c
would	c
be	c
very	c
kind	c
of	c
you	c
to	c
let	c
me	c
know	c
about	c
the	c
clothes	c
you	c
think	c
it	c
would	i
be	c
necessary	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
take	c
and	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
will	c
need	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c

All	i

teacher	c
told	c
me	c
that	c
Mano''s	i
group	c
were	c
going	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
concert	c
here	c
,	c
in	c
Argentina	c
.	c

You	c
know	c
that	c
last	c
year	c
I	c
organise	i
the	c
lights	c
in	i
our	c
performance	c
.	c

I	c
will	c
never	c
forget	c
that	c
wonderful	c
experience	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
thank	c
for	i
the	c
letter	c
with	c
the	c
result	c
of	c
the	c
competition	c
and	c
also	c
to	c
ask	c
some	c
questions	c
.	c

The	c
reason	c
for	c
it	i
,	i
is	c
that	c
,	i
July	c
is	c
the	c
only	c
month	c
in	c
which	c
,	i
I	c
am	c
on	c
holidays	i
so	c
I	c
will	c
not	c
have	c
to	c
miss	c
any	c
classes	c
.	c

Next	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
stay	i
in	c
tents	i
rather	c
than	c
stay	c
in	c
log	i
cabins	i
because	c
I	c
appreciate	c
having	c
straight	i
contact	c
with	c
nature	c
.	c

I	c
can	c
say	c
I	c
am	c
good	c
at	c
swimming	c
,	c
because	c
in	c
the	c
club	c
I	c
used	c
to	c
be	c
the	i
first	c
in	c
all	c
the	c
competitions	c
and	c
climbing	i
I	c
used	c
to	c
climb	c
trees	c
,	c
walls	c
everything	i
in	c
my	c
childhood	c
without	c
falling	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
an	i
answer	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Adriana	c

Starting	c
with	c
good	c
points	c
,	c
I	c
could	c
say	c
that	c
you	c
can	i
talk	c
face	i
to	i
face	i
with	c
the	c
pop	c
stars	c
.	c

Despite	c
of	i
being	c
tiring	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
rewarding	c
because	c
I	c
noticed	c
that	c
all	c
the	c
singers	c
are	c
ordinary	c
people	c
who	c
want	c
to	c
see	c
their	c
fans	c
happy	c
and	c
satisfied	c
and	c
that	i
is	c
true	c
I	c
experienced	c
that	c
.	c

Kim	c
,	c
summing	c
up	c
it	i
was	c
the	c
most	c
interesting	c
experience	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
ever	c
had	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Adriana	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
about	c
my	c
preference	c
.	c

To	c
start	c
with	c
I	i
would	c
rather	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
because	c
two	c
weeks	c
might	c
be	c
too	c
long	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
and	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
would	c
be	c
more	c
convenient	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
started	c
surfing	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
12	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
am	c
quite	c
confident	c
with	i
this	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
your	c
time	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
visiting	c
there	c
.	c

Yours	c
Faithfully	c
,	c

Those	c
who	c
love	c
shopping	c
are	i
usually	c
suffer	c
from	c
serious	c
stress	c
and	c
may	c
seek	c
out	c
satisfaction	c
by	c
shopping	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
things	c
which	c
you	c
can	c
get	c
by	i
money	c
necessarily	i
fill	i
your	c
unsatisfaction	i
or	c
even	c
as	c
you	c
buy	c
something	c
more	c
and	c
more	c
,	c
your	c
emptiness	c
might	c
be	c
bigger	i
.	c

And	c
shopping	c
is	c
also	c
a	c
difficult	c
hobby	c
to	c
go	c
along	c
with	c
your	c
friends	c
or	c
your	c
pertners	i
.	c

What	c
you	c
want	c
is	c
often	c
different	c
from	c
what	c
your	c
friend	c
wants	c
.	c

Unless	c
either	c
you	c
or	c
your	c
partner	c
is	c
really	c
tolerant	c
,	c
shopping	c
could	c
result	c
in	c
another	c
stress	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
whole	c
,	c
shopping	c
can	c
be	c
harmful	c
rather	c
than	c
enjoyable	c
because	c
you	c
migh	i
be	c
extravacant	i
,	c
lose	c
your	c
friends	c
and	c
have	c
what	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
need	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
you	i
because	c
I	c
had	i
been	i
asked	i
to	c
make	c
a	c
little	c
suggestion	c
about	c
the	c
programme	c
your	i
have	c
organised	c
to	i
our	c
English	c
class	c
travel	i
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
the	c
programme	c
,	c
we	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
very	c
good	c
,	c
especially	c
the	c
river	c
trip	c
to	c
greenwich	i
,	c
we	c
believe	c
we	c
will	c
enjoy	c
a	i
lot	c
going	c
to	c
greenwich	i
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
in	c
our	c
opinion	c
,	c
this	c
travel	i
is	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
very	c
interesting	c
for	c
us	c
.	c

We	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
good	c
opportunity	c
because	c
london	i
fashion	c
is	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
over	i
the	c
world	c
,	c
and	c
we	c
all	c
learn	i
a	c
lot	c
about	c
London	c
style	c
going	c
to	c
this	c
show	c
.	c

We	c
think	c
we	c
could	c
change	i
shooping	i
for	i
going	i
to	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

The	c
show	c
is	c
free	c
,	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
only	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
14th	c
of	c
March	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
open	c
from	c
10.00	c
until	c
19.00	c
,	c
and	c
we	c
could	c
go	c
there	c
on	i
the	c
afternoon	c
.	c

We	c
are	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
your	c
answer	c
,	c

Thinking	c
about	c
the	c
media	c
's	c
treatment	c
of	c
famous	c
people	c
,	c
I	c
've	c
realised	c
of	i
some	c
things	c
.	c

On	i
my	i
point	i
of	i
view	i
the	c
media	c
's	c
treatment	c
of	c
famous	c
people	c
is	c
very	c
bad	c
.	c

They	c
are	c
not	c
trying	c
to	c
give	c
information	c
,	c
they	c
are	c
only	c
looking	c
to	c
get	c
money	c
,	c
and	c
to	c
entertain	c
the	c
public	c
.	c

The	i
society	i
is	i
who	i
increases	c
the	c
audience	c
of	c
the	c
media	c
,	c
if	c
nobody	c
gave	i
attention	c
to	c
the	c
famous	c
people	i
private	c
lifes	i
,	c
this	c
treatment	c
would	c
finish	c
.	c

As	c
in	c
another	c
you	i
may	c
know	c
what	c
could	c
happen	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
you	c
this	c
letter	c
to	c
complain	i
about	c
you	i
have	c
organized	c
us	i
for	c
our	c
trip	c
to	c
London	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
activity	c
programme	c
.	c

I	c
find	c
it	c
really	c
good	c
,	c
specially	i
because	c
of	c
the	c
visit	c
to	c
the	c
Science	c
Museum	c
and	c
the	c
National	c
Art	c
Gallery	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
you	c
to	c
know	c
that	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
March	c
14th	c
in	c
London	c
,	c
there	c
is	c
a	c
show	c
,	c
which	c
is	c
free	c
for	c
students	c
,	c
about	c
the	c
latest	c
fashions	c
,	c
leisure	c
and	c
sports	i
wear	i
,	c
make	i
up	i
and	c
hairstyles	c
called	c
The	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
.	c

We	c
know	c
that	c
you	c
have	c
planned	c
a	c
very	c
complete	c
programme	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
considering	c
our	c
petition	i
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

But	c
,	c
how	c
does	c
fame	c
affect	c
to	i
their	c
lifestyle	c
?	c

It	c
is	c
certain	c
that	c
these	c
people	c
have	c
fame	c
,	c
fortune	c
and	c
success	c
,	c
and	c
that	c
many	c
of	c
them	c
are	c
rich	c
,	c
very	c
rich	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
'm	c
sure	c
that	c
all	c
these	c
things	c
can	i
not	i
give	c
them	c
back	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
most	c
needed	c
things	c
:	c
a	c
private	c
life	c
.	c

And	c
believe	c
me	c
,	c
there	c
is	c
no	c
money	c
in	c
the	c
world	c
to	i
pay	i
that	c
.	c

But	c
obviously	c
,	c
if	c
these	c
people	c
are	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
in	c
the	c
newspaper	c
,	c
on	c
TV	c
and	c
so	c
on	c
,	c
is	i
because	c
,	c
although	c
we	c
do	c
n't	c
want	c
to	c
accept	c
it	c
,	c
we	c
love	c
following	c
their	c
lifes	i
.	c

Dear	c
Ms	c
clark	i
:	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
give	c
suggestion	i
for	i
the	c
international	c
art	c
festival	c
,	c
which	c
I	c
have	i
been	i
to	c
one	c
weeks	i
before	i
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
say	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
idea	c
to	c
have	c
this	c
international	c
arts	c
festival	c
,	i
it	i
is	c
very	c
interesting	c
,	c
especially	c
for	c
the	i
young	c
people	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
said	c
that	c
stars	c
and	c
artists	c
from	c
around	c
the	c
world	c
on	i
the	c
advertisement	c
,	c
but	c
in	c
fact	c
they	c
are	i
from	c
only	c
six	c
different	c
countries	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
hope	c
there	c
will	c
be	c
artists	c
from	c
more	c
different	i
countries	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

Although	c
the	c
jazz	c
,	c
rock	c
and	c
classical	c
music	c
was	c
great	c
,	c
some	c
concerts	i
and	c
halls	c
are	i
too	c
small	c
,	i
could	i
you	c
consider	c
making	c
them	c
bigger	c
next	c
year	c
.	i

The	c
plays	c
and	c
films	c
were	c
really	c
wonderful	c
,	i
people	i
liked	c
them	c
very	c
much	c
,	c
so	c
could	c
you	c
play	i
more	c
next	c
year	c

The	c
last	c
thing	c
is	c
about	c
the	c
ticket	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
excellent	c
about	i
one	c
reasonably-priced	i
weekend	c
ticket	c
for	c
all	c
events	c
,	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
convenient	c
and	c
normally	c
young	c
people	c
do	c
not	c
have	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
money	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
hope	c
next	c
year	c
the	c
ticket	c
will	c
be	i
also	i
like	c
this	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
that	c
you	c
can	c
consider	c
my	c
suggestions	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
:	c

I	c
'm	c
very	c
glad	c
to	c
hear	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
really	c
sorry	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
write	i
you	i
back	i
immediately	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
was	c
preparing	c
my	c
exam	c
at	c
that	c
moment	c
,	c
so	c
can	c
you	c
forgive	c
me	c
?	c

We	c
should	c
keep	c
in	c
touch	c
with	c
each	c
other	c
,	c
because	c
you	c
know	c
I	c
'm	c
very	c
happy	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
friend	c
like	c
you	c
.	c

I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
that	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
too	c
strickt	i
,	i
I	c
do	c
n't	c
like	c
it	c
.	c

If	c
I	c
can	i
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
change	c
this	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
think	c
everyone	c
can	c
success	i
at	c
once	c
,	i
we	i
should	c
give	c
them	c
second	i
chance	c
to	c
try	i
.	c

Anyway	c
,	c
in	c
my	c
country	c
,	c
generally	c
,	c
children	c
are	c
free	c
at	c
home	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
also	c
depends	c
on	c
their	c
parents	c
.	c

OK	i
,	i
just	i
here	i
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

All	i
the	i
best	i
wishes	i
and	c
good	c
luck	c
.	c

The	c
purpose	c
of	c
this	c
letter	c
is	c
to	c
congratulate	c
you	c
on	c
the	c
International	c
Arts	c
Fesival	i
I	c
attended	c
last	c
weekend	c
.	c

I	c
believe	c
that	c
the	c
event	c
was	c
good	c
,	i
however	i
I	i
feel	c
that	c
the	c
festival	c
can	i
be	c
improved	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
understand	c
that	c
it	c
must	c
be	c
difficult	c
to	c
get	c
these	c
people	c
to	c
go	i
to	c
the	c
festival	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
nice	c
if	c
next	c
year	c
we	c
could	c
meet	c
other	i
personalities	c
.	c

Last	c
but	c
not	c
least	c
I	i
would	c
like	c
you	c
to	c
know	c
that	c
I	c
think	c
the	c
idea	c
of	c
the	c
weekend	c
ticket	c
for	c
all	c
events	c
was	c
excellent	c
because	c
in	c
the	c
end	c
it	c
was	c
cheaper	c
than	c
paying	c
for	c
each	c
event	c
separatelly	i
.	c

tips	i
to	i
earn	i
money	c

there	i
are	c
several	c
ways	c
to	c
earn	c
a	c
bit	c
of	c
money	c
in	c
your	c
spare	c
time	c
.	c

Lots	c
of	c
people	c
would	c
pay	c
you	c
to	c
take	c
their	c
dog	c
for	c
a	c
walk	c
.	c

In	c
this	c
case	c
you	c
need	c
to	c
buy	c
the	c
materials	c
you	c
will	c
work	c
with	c
,	c
but	c
do	c
n't	c
worry	c
,	c
soap	c
is	c
not	c
very	c
expensive	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
find	c
anything	c
good	c
enough	c
for	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
worry	c
,	c
you	c
should	c
always	c
remember	c
:	c
It	c
's	c
not	c

Dear	c
Ms	c
Ryan	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
proud	c
that	c
I	c
won	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
extremely	c
happy	c
to	c
spend	c
two	c
weeks	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
in	c
the	c
U.S.A	c
.	c

The	c
most	c
appropriate	i
month	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
travel	c
is	c
July	c
because	c
my	c
boss	c
promised	c
to	c
give	c
me	c
this	c
month	c
off	c
(	c
I	c
am	c
in	c
charge	c
of	c
project	i
which	c
starts	c
in	c
June	c
so	c
I	c
am	c
sure	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
go	c
later	c
)	c
.	c

As	c
I	c
was	c
requested	c
I	c
should	c
choose	c
two	c
activities	c
from	c
the	c
list	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
choose	c
climbing	c
and	c
photography	c
.	c

These	c
two	c
are	c
easy	c
to	c
connect	c
,	c
I	c
could	c
climb	c
and	c
make	c
pictures	c
at	c
the	c
same	c
time	c
.	c

Last	c
year	c
I	c
took	c
part	c
in	c
photograher	i
's	i
contest	c
and	c
I	c
won	c
a	c
second	c
prize	c
in	c
Poland	c
in	c
cathegory	i

Climbing	c

in	c
contrast	c

is	c
something	c
I	c
started	c
few	i
months	c

I	c
have	c
not	c
gained	c
any	c

Do	c
I	c
need	c
any	c
formal	c

I	c
would	c
like	i
also	i
to	c
know	c
what	c
the	c
cost	c

Juliana	c
Piotrowska	c

Have	c
you	c
ever	c
been	c
to	c
a	c
big	c
supermarket	c
and	c
tried	c
to	c
find	c
something	c
you	c
really	c
like	c
or	c
want	c
,	c
looking	c
throug	i
shelves	c
and	c
not	c
finding	c
that	c
in	c
the	c
end	c
.	c

What	c
did	c
you	c
feel	c
?	c

There	c
is	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
situations	c
which	c
could	c
make	c
you	c
feel	c
similar	c
while	c
you	c
do	c
shopping	c
.	c

You	c
might	c
spend	c
too	c
much	c
money	c
and	c
buy	c
something	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
really	c
need	c
.	c

So	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
it	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
you	c
could	c
face	c
an	c
agressive	i
and	c
maybe	c
even	c
drunk	c
shop	c
assistant	c
or	c
manager	c
.	c

This	c
leads	c
to	c
an	c
escalation	c
of	c
your	c
anger	c
.	c

Sometimes	c
you	c
could	c
find	c
a	c
bargain	c
.	c

You	c
are	c
happy	c
to	c
buy	c
a	c
dress	c
or	c
a	c
suit	c
for	c
a	c
good	c
price	c
.	c

So	c
if	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
want	c
to	c
feel	c
deceived	c
or	c
offended	c
,	c
think	c
twice	c
before	c
you	c
decide	c
to	c
go	c
shopping	c
.	c

(	c
A	c
very	c
depressing	c
point	c
of	c
view	c
,	c
is	c
n't	c
it	c
?	c
)	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
have	c
several	c
precisions	i
to	c
tell	c
you	c
and	c
some	c
questions	c
about	c
the	c
camp	c
.	c

Then	c
,	c
about	c
accommodation	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
a	c
tent	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
used	c
to	c
.	i

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
what	c
sort	c
of	c
clothes	c
do	c
advise	i
me	c
to	c
bring	c
to	c
be	c
at	i
ease	i
during	c
my	c
activities	c
and	c
as	i
nearly	c
everything	c
is	c
already	c
paid	c
,	i
do	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
take	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
money	c
with	c
me	c
?	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

It	c
was	c
really	c
an	c
amazing	c
experience	c
.	c

I	c
tried	c
to	c
play	c
the	c
drums	c
but	c
I	c
was	c
expelled	i
from	i
the	c
stage	c
by	c
a	c
member	c
of	c
the	c
group	c
who	c
was	c
in	c
a	c
bad	c
mood	c
.	c

That	c
was	c
the	c
best	c
.	c

Looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
an	c
excellent	c
actor	c
,	c
who	c
(	c
according	c
to	c
the	c
play	c
advertisement	c
)	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
perform	c
,	c
was	c
replaced	c
for	i
a	c
disappointing	c
actor	c
.	c

Sir	c
,	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
believe	c
in	i
that	i
,	c
everything	c
that	c
was	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
was	c
a	c
fraud	i
.	c

That	c
's	c
why	c
I	c
am	c
writting	i
to	c
ask	c
for	c
some	c
money	c
back	c
,	i
I	c
believe	c
I	c
have	c
this	c
right	c
.	c

Some	c
people	c
glorify	c
technology	c
as	c
if	c
it	c
was	c
the	c
best	c
thing	c
could	i
ever	c
happened	c
in	c
their	c
lives	c
.	c

Unfortunatly	i
my	c
parents	c
did	c
not	c
realize	c
how	c
TV	c
was	c
creating	i
a	i
role	i
among	c
us	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
due	c
to	c
science	i
development	i
,	c
I	c
am	c
getting	c
better	c
,	c
recovering	c
from	c
ahsma	i
.	c

When	c
I	c
knew	i
it	i
was	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
an	c
international	c
festival	c
,	c
I	c
got	c
really	c
excited	c
because	c
I	c
would	c
finally	c
have	c
the	c
opportunity	c
to	c
meet	c
stars	c
and	c
artists	c
from	c
around	c
the	c
world	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
felt	c
rather	c
disappointed	c
when	c
I	c
found	c
out	c
that	c
was	c
not	c
at	c
all	c
true	c
.	c

Besides	c
this	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
some	c
of	c
the	c
concert	c
halls	c
were	c
too	c
small	c
that	i
I	c
felt	c
very	c
uncomfortable	c
.	c

I	c
wish	c
you	c
could	c
perform	i
more	c
plays	c
and	c
films	c
,	c
and	c
there	c
should	c
be	c
more	c
varied	c
art	c
exhibitions	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
really	i
appreciate	i
it	c
if	c
you	c
would	i
take	i
into	c
consideration	c
the	c
problem	c
with	c
the	c
lack	c
of	c
space	c
in	c
the	c
concert	c
halls	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

It	c
is	c
really	c
nice	c
to	c
hearing	i
from	c
you	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
we	c
will	c
learn	c
so	c
many	c
interesting	c
facts	c
from	c
each	c
other	c
.	c

Personally	c
,	c
I	c
can	i
not	i
imagine	c
human	c
life	c
without	c
rules	c
,	c
especially	c
those	c
that	c
have	c
to	c
do	c
with	c
respecting	c
other	c
people	c
.	c

As	c
a	c
consequence	c
,	c
most	c
mates	i
used	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
those	c
rules	c
but	c
all	c
of	c
us	c
tried	c
to	c
put	c
up	c
with	c
them	c
.	c

At	c
home	c
it	c
is	c
the	c
other	c
way	c
about	i
.	c

Fortunately	c
,	c
rules	c
are	c
made	c
by	c
every	c
member	c
of	c
the	c
family	c
so	c
that	c
no	c
one	c
complains	c
about	c
them	c
.	c

I	c
must	c
admit	c
that	c
I	c
am	c
able	c
to	c
do	c
whatever	c
I	c
want	c
,	c
such	c
as	c
inviting	i
friends	c
,	i
watching	i
TV	c
until	c
midnight	c
and	c
so	c
on	c
.	c

In	c
fact	c
,	c
the	c
only	c
strong	c
rule	c
is	c
to	c
cooperate	i
with	c
house-keeping	i
and	c
meal	i
.	c

Hope	i
you	c
enjoy	c
my	c
experiences	c

Best	c
wishes	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c

Supposedly	c
it	c
was	c
to	c
start	c
at	c
19:30	i
well	i
it	c
did	c
n't	c
,	i
it	i
started	c
45	c
minutes	c
late	c
,	c
at	c
exactly	c
20:15	c
.	c

And	c
By	i
the	c
way	c
may	c
I	c
ask	c
you	c
how	c
up	i
to	i
date	i
your	c
leaflets	c
are	c
because	c
in	c
spite	c
of	c
the	c
ad	i
vert	i
saying	c
the	c
staring	i
actor	c
was	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
well	i
it	c
was	c
n't	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
an	i
other	i
actor	c
I	i
had	c
never	c
heard	c
of	c
.	c

That	c
was	c
a	c
dissapointment	i
for	c
my	c
whole	c
family	c
,	i
infact	i
all	c
the	c
viewers	i
where	i
very	c
dissappointed	i
.	c

Anyway	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
nowhere	i
as	i
good	c
as	c
it	c
was	c
mentioned	i
to	c
be	c
and	c
it	c
was	c
definately	i
worse	c
than	c
I	c
had	c
expected	c
it	c
to	c
be	c
,	i
I	c
did	c
n't	c
enjoy	c
it	c
at	c
all	c
so	c
I	c
was	c
relying	c
on	c
the	c
food	c
to	c
fill	c
me	c
up	c
and	c
relieve	c
some	c
of	c
my	c
stress	c
.	c

So	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
over	c
we	c
walked	c
out	c
and	c
followed	c
all	c
the	c
signs	c
for	c
about	c
5	c
minutes	c
desparately	i
searching	c
for	c
your	c
restaurants	i
our	i
stomaches	i
rumbling	c
for	c
food	c
.	c

And	c
your	c
booking	c
staff	c
did	c
n't	c
know	c
this	c
obviously	c
as	c
they	c
took	c
our	c
booking	c
,	c
with	c
no	c
problems	i
whatsoever	c
.	c

they	i
even	c
gave	c
us	c
a	c
table	c
number	c
.	c

And	c
I	c
am	c
demanding	c
a	c
refund	c
.	c

Yours	c
Sincerely	i
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

Another	c
bad	c
thing	c
about	c
this	c
school	c
was	c
that	c
there	c
where	i
different	c
types	c
of	c
students	c
that	c
formed	c
groups	c
.	c

This	c
whent	i
on	c
and	c
on	c
,	c
got	c
more	c
and	c
more	c
serious	c
but	i
it	c
was	c
so	c
secret	c
that	c
teachers	i
did	c
n't	c
notice	c
.	c

But	c
Pat	c
was	c
so	c
exited	i
that	c
he	c
forgot	c
all	c
about	c
the	c
secret	c
and	c
told	c
all	c
of	c
his	c
best	c
mates	c
.	c

Everyone	c
in	c
the	c
year	c
was	c
anoyed	i
,	c
but	c
not	c
with	c
Pat	c
,	c
oh	c
,	c
no	c
!	c

With	c
the	c
group	c
having	c
the	c
party	c
.	c

No	c
one	c
could	c
do	c
anything	c
about	c
it	c
.	i

That	c
night	c
the	c
party	c
commenced	c
.	c

Everyone	c
was	c
enjoying	c
themselves	c
exept	i
Pat	c
who	i
had	c
heard	c
about	c
the	c
raid	c
.	c

Time	c
was	c
ticking	c
away	c
.	c

he	i
new	i
the	c
attack	c
was	c
coming	c
anyminute	i
.	c

The	c
time	c
had	c
come	i
the	i
who	i
groups	c
had	c
comdined	i
their	c
forces	c
and	c
where	i
ready	c
to	c
strike	c
.	c

They	c
had	c
water	c
bombs	c
and	c
water	c
pistols	c
at	c
the	c
ready	c
.	c

they	i
started	c
charging	c
down	c
the	c
field	c
towards	c
the	c
fire	c
and	c
once	c
in	c
range	c
everyone	c
thew	i
their	c
balloon	i
as	c
far	c
as	c
they	c
could	c
.	c

they	i
all	c
exploded	c
with	c
loud	c
splashes	c
.	c

But	c
he	c
felt	c
awfull	i
because	c
he	c
new	i
that	c
all	c
this	c
had	c
happened	c
because	c
of	c
him	c
.	c

To	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
,	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
the	c
programme	c
that	c
you	c
provided	i
.	c

It	c
was	i
very	i
good	c
programme	c
,	c
especially	c
the	c
river	c
trip	c
to	c
Greenwich	c
,	c
which	c
I	c
am	c
sure	c
the	c
whole	c
class	c
would	i
enjoy	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
our	c
class	c
has	c
spotted	c
an	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
and	c
would	i
all	c
wish	c
to	c
attend	c
.	c

It	c
will	c
be	c
held	c
at	c
the	c
Central	c
Exhibition	c
Hall	c
in	c
London	c
on	c
the	c
14th	c
March	c
.	c

It	c
will	c
be	c
from	c
10.00	c
till	c
7.00pm	c
.	c

The	c
show	c
will	c
be	c
about	c
all	c
the	c
latest	c
fashion	i
,	c
leisure	c
and	c
sports	c
wear	c
,	c
make	i
up	i
and	c
hairstyles	c
.	c

We	c
could	c
do	c
as	c
planned	c
for	c
Monday	c
and	c
move	c
going	c
to	c
the	c
Science	c
Museum	c
from	c
Tuesday	c
to	c
Wednesday	c
afternoon	c
.	c

Lastly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
be	c
very	c
grateful	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
give	c
us	c
your	c
permission	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
would	i
consider	c
this	c
matter	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

Everyday	i
,	c
something	c
changes	c
and	c
we	c
become	c
more	c
modern	i
companies	i
use	c
computers	c
instead	c
of	c
books	c
,	c
dentist	i
use	c
modernized	c
electrical	i
item	i
instead	c
of	c
just	c
a	c
plier	i
,	i
even	i
homes	c
are	c
effected	i
.	c

No	c
,	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
,	c
the	c
present	c
will	c
be	c
the	c
past	c
and	c
these	i
things	c
now	c
new	c
to	c
use	i
will	c
be	c
old	c
,	c
outdated	c
and	c
changed	c
.	c

We	c
might	c
even	c
be	c
using	c
voice	c
identification	c
and	c
fingerprints	c
instead	c
of	c
keys	c
.	c

We	c
might	c
even	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
open	c
the	c
door	c
without	c
getting	i
out	i
from	i
the	c
living	c
room	c
.	c

Cameras	c
will	c
be	c
something	c
usual	c
in	c
every	c
house	c
instead	c
of	c
that	c
little	c
peephole	c
in	c
your	c
door	c
.	c

Although	c
all	c
that	c
may	c
change	i
our	c
houses	c
may	c
be	c
still	c
the	c
same	c
.	c

The	c
rooms	c
and	c
size	i
should	c
remain	c
as	c
it	i
was	i
and	c
the	c
living	c
rooms	c
and	c
all	i
may	c
still	c
be	c
decorated	c
in	c
the	c
same	c
style	c
.	c

The	c
furniture	c
should	c
not	c
change	c
that	c
much	c
on	c
the	c
outside	c
and	c
the	c
amount	i
of	c
rooms	c
should	c
not	c
change	c
too	i
.	c

And	c
instead	c
of	c
going	c
to	c
school	c
,	c
why	c
not	c
let	c
school	c
come	c
to	c
you	c
?	c

Never	i
have	i
to	c
leave	c
the	c
house	c
or	c
wake	c
up	c
so	c
early	c
.	c

Another	c
way	c
our	c
home	c
could	c
be	c
different	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
is	c
probably	c
the	c
utilitles	i
we	c
are	i
using	c
.	c

We	c
might	c
not	c
need	c
maids	c
to	c
do	c
housework	c
anymore	c
as	c
they	c
can	c
easily	c
be	c
replaced	c
with	c
a	c
robot	c
,	c
a	c
machine	c
,	c
or	c
something	c
other	i
with	c
the	c
same	c
purpose	c
.	c

Our	c
homes	c
will	c
still	c
be	c
the	c
same	c
in	c
terms	c
of	c
the	c
kitchen	i
,	i
it	i
will	c
still	c
be	c
filled	c
with	c
vegetables	c
and	c
meat	c
.	c

Lastly	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
all	c
this	i
changes	c
wo	c
n't	c
really	c
be	c
noticed	c
as	c
we	c
change	c
it	i
daily	c
and	c
slowly	c
instead	c
abruptedly	i
.	c

Dear	c
Jane	c
Clark	c
,	c

I	c
congratulated	i
with	i
you	c
because	c
it	c
has	i
been	i
a	c
great	c
idea	c
since	i
the	c
town	c
needed	c
a	c
cultural	c
event	c
.	c

You	c
probably	c
did	c
not	c
expect	c
such	c
a	c
big	c
audience	c
!	c

Being	c
very	c
fond	c
of	c
films	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
have	c
appreciate	i
seeing	c
more	c
of	c
them	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
make	c
a	i
really	c
international	c
festival	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
you	c
should	c
invite	c
artists	c
from	c
all	c
over	c
the	c
world	c
,	c
not	c
just	c
from	c
six	c
countries	c
like	c
this	c
year	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
that	c
you	c
will	c
appreciate	c
my	c
opinions	c
and	c
suggestions	c
,	c
which	c
I	c
have	c
shared	c
with	c
my	c
friends	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

You	c
could	c
move	c
from	c
children	c
to	c
pets	c
and	c
become	c
a	c
dog-sitter	c
,	c
spending	c
your	c
afternoons	c
walking	c
round	c
the	c
park	c
and	c
chatting	c
with	c
a	c
friend	c
.	c

Are	c
you	c
keen	c
on	c
music	c
and	c
you	i
love	c
going	c
to	c
disco	i
?	c

Work	c
out	c
your	c
own	c
idea	c
and	c
realise	i
it	i
:	c
money	c
wo	c
n't	c
be	c
a	c
problem	c
for	c
you	c
anymore	c
!	c

Dear	c
Clark	c
,	c

However	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
dissapointment	i
,	i
when	c
I	c
realised	c
that	c
not	c
many	c
countries	c
were	c
attending	c
to	i
the	c
event	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
n't	c
complicated	i
to	c
find	c
the	c
right	c
hall	c
to	i
the	c
shows	c
,	c
I	c
should	i
say	c
it	c
was	c
very	c
well	c
organised	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
preciate	i
your	c
organisation	i
and	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	i
the	c
next	c
International	c
Arts	c
Festival	c
.	c

Dear	c
Nico	c
,	c

Its	i
really	c
nice	c
to	c
hearing	i
from	c
you	c
and	c
thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
the	c
letter	c
with	i
photos	c
.	c

Its	i
a	c
good	c
idea	c
to	c
send	c
them	c
to	c
me	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
confess	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
lost	c
my	c
camera	c
and	c
also	c
the	c
films	c
.	c

What	c
a	c
pitty	i
!	c

I	c
must	c
say	c
that	c
our	c
school	c
rules	c
are	c
quite	c
different	c
than	i
yours	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
we	c
have	c
to	c
stand	c
up	c
,	i
when	c
we	c
speak	c
to	c
the	c
teacher	c
and	c
have	c
to	c
pay	c
full	c
attention	c
to	c
the	c
lessons	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
depends	c
on	c
the	c
school	c
.	c

Privat	i
schools	c
have	c
more	i
relaxed	c
atmosphere	c
that	i
the	c
state	c
school	i
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
in	c
the	c
state	c
schools	c
as	c
I	c
said	c
,	c
we	c
are	c
more	c
respectful	c
to	c
the	c
teacher	c
and	c
bad	c
behaviours	i
are	i
punished	c
.	c

My	c
Father	i
does	c
the	c
cooking	c
,	c
my	c
mother	c
does	c
the	c
cleaning	c
and	c
I	c
do	i
tidying	i
up	c
!	c

Anyway	c
it	i
think	c
that	c
's	c
it	c
for	c
now	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
to	c
hearing	i
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

Lots	c
of	c
Love	i

The	c
activities	c
that	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
do	c
:	c
First	i
one	c
it	i
would	c
be	c
basketball	c
and	c
to	c
be	c
honest	c
I	c
can	c
play	c
it	c
very	c
well	c
due	i
to	i
I	c
used	c
to	c
be	c
a	c
basketball	c
player	c
in	c
my	c
high	c
school	c
.	c

Second	c
activity	c
it	i
would	c
be	c
tennis	c
,	i
I	c
am	c
not	c
the	i
expert	c
in	i
this	c
one	i
because	c
I	c
've	c
played	c
it	c
only	c
twice	c
but	c
I	c
know	c
how	c
to	c
hit	c
the	c
ball	c
and	c
basic	c
stuff	c
like	c
;	i
serve	i
the	c
ball	c
,	c
back	i
hand	i
and	c
fore	i
hand	i
to	c
hit	c
the	c
ball	c
.	c

Do	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
bring	c
swimming	c
suit	i
if	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
swim	c
in	i
the	c
camp	c
?	c

This	c
information	c
should	c
enough	i
for	c
you	c
but	c
if	c
you	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
more	c
about	c
anything	c
please	c
ask	c
me	c
and	c
do	c
not	c
hesitate	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
it	c
and	c
I	c
hope	c
seeing	i
you	c
during	i
this	c
summer	c
.	c

The	i
typical	c
answer	c
would	c
be	c
'	c
I	c
'm	c
going	c
to	c
shop	i
because	c
I	c
like	c
it	c
even	i
windows	i
shopping	c
would	c
be	c
fine	c
'	c
.	c

Why	c
?	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
it	i
's	i
wasting	i
my	c
time	c
especially	i
when	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
find	c
the	c
thing	c
I	c
want	c
,	i
this	i
is	c
very	c
frustrating	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
,	c
it	c
's	c
so	c
tiring	c
to	c
walk	c
around	c
the	c
place	c
over	c
and	c
over	c
to	c
find	c
the	c
thing	c
you	c
want	c
.	c

Dear	c
the	i
competition	c
organiser	c
(	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
)	c

I	c
'm	c
as	i
happy	c
to	c
heard	i
that	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
.	c

Here	c
is	c
the	c
information	c
you	c
want	c
from	c
me	c
.	c

Finally	c
I	i
hope	c
the	c
information	c
I	c
've	c
gave	i
are	i
useful	c
for	c
you	c
,	c
and	c
hope	c
you	c
can	c
answers	i
my	c
questions	c
A.S.A.P	c
.	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c

Shopping	i
,	i
for	i
most	i
the	i
people	i
it	i
is	i
very	i
important	i
because	c
you	c
need	c
to	c
get	c
the	c
stuff	c
you	c
need	c
or	c
you	c
want	c
.	c

It	c
depends	c
on	c
what	i
is	i
the	i
place	i
and	i
the	i
aim	i
you	i
are	i
shopping	i
.	c

For	c
example	c
some	i
people	c
always	c
shopping	i
to	c
get	c
food	c
or	c
stuff	c
the	i
need	c
in	c
everyday	c
life	c
,	i
they	i
wo	c
n't	c
enjoy	c
this	c
kind	c
of	c
shopping	c
,	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
not	c
getting	c
what	c
they	c
want	c
.	c

The	c
place	c
where	c
you	c
are	c
shopping	c
also	i
very	c
important	c
.	c

Because	c
have	i
too	c
many	c
people	c
it	c
make	i
you	c
want	c
to	c
stay	c
home	c
wo	i
n't	c
enjoy	c
shopping	c
.	c

After	i
I	c
've	c
written	c
this	c
composition	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
you	c
will	c
enjoy	c
shopping	c
most	c
of	c
the	c
time	c
,	c
but	c
still	c
have	i
sometimes	c
you	c
wo	c
n't	c

Circle	c
Theatre	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
just	c
writing	c
this	c
letter	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
I	c
have	i
seen	i
last	c
Sunday	c
at	i
the	c
evening	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
become	i
very	c
disappointed	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
actor	c
,	c
who	c
was	c
different	c
from	c
your	i
advertisement	c
,	c
not	i
Danny	i
Brook	i
was	i
starring	i
.	c

Thus	i
,	c
you	c
can	i
n't	i
believe	c
what	i
was	i
my	i
disappointment	i
when	c
I	c
noted	i
that	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
,	c
without	i
no	i
explanation	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
modern	c
technology	c
have	i
changed	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
the	i
last	c
five	c
years	c
more	c
quickly	c
than	c
in	c
the	i
anchient	i
time	i
,	c
or	c
even	c
than	c
a	c
ten	i
years	i
ago	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
,	c
at	c
the	i
University	c
teachers	c
not	i
accepted	i
more	c
written	c
tasks	c
done	c
by	c
hand	c
,	c
but	c
only	c
they	i
should	i
be	i
written	c
by	i
computer	i
.	c

From	i
that	c
time	c
,	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
buy	c
my	c
own	c
computer	c
and	c
every	c
day	c
I	c
was	c
improving	c
my	c
knowledge	c
.	c

Nowadays	c
,	c
I	c
can	i
n't	i
stay	i
one	c
day	c
without	c
consulting	c
computers	i
communications	c
throught	i
e-mail	c
or	c
internet	i
.	c

My	c
life	c
would	c
n't	c
be	c
the	c
same	c
another	i
time	i
without	c
these	i
progress	c
.	c

The	c
Festival	i
on	c
its	c
own	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
idea	c
because	c
there	c
are	c
n't	c
many	c
of	c
these	c
events	c
dealing	c
with	c
art	c
but	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
instead	c
of	c
inviting	c
stars	c
and	c
artists	c
only	i
from	i
six	c
counties	c
they	c
could	c
be	c
invited	c
really	i
from	c
all	c
the	i
world	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
and	c
for	i
sure	i
it	c
is	c
not	c
your	c
fault	c
,	c
some	c
of	c
the	c
halls	c
for	c
the	c
concerts	c
were	c
too	c
small	c
and	c
that	c
prevented	c
me	c
from	c
enjoying	c
some	c
of	c
the	c
concerts	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
noise	c
but	c
also	c
prevented	c
many	c
people	c
from	c
entering	c
the	c
hall	c
that	i
was	c
often	c
two	i
crowded	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
next	c
year	c
plays	i
and	i
films	i
will	i
be	i
more	i
and	c
that	c
the	c
ticket	c
will	c
be	c
reasonably-priced	i
as	i
this	i
year	i
in	i
way	i
that	i
people	i
not	i
really	i
interested	i
in	i
arts	i
could	i
come	i
and	i
enjoy	i
the	i
festival	i
.	c

Rome	c
16th	c
December	c
2000	c

At	c
my	c
home	c
every	c
rule	c
must	c
be	c
respected	c
.	c

Even	c
if	c
my	c
parents	c
do	c
n't	c
look	i
after	i
me	i
for	i
all	i
the	i
matters	i
like	c
going	c
out	c
on	i
nights	i
or	c
studying	c
you	c
do	i
n't	i
have	i
to	i
think	i
that	c
living	c
in	c
my	c
house	c
is	c
like	c
living	c
in	c
heaven	c
because	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
play	c
the	c
guitar	c
or	c
listen	c
to	c
music	c
at	c
a	c
loud	c
volume	c
or	c
invite	c
my	c
friends	c
for	i
a	c
Saturday	c
night	c
party	c
.	c

These	c
are	c
the	c
things	c
that	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
chance	i
;	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
do	c
what	c
I	c
really	c
want	c
but	i
I	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
if	c
I	c
'm	c
really	c
ready	c
for	c
this	c
!	c
!	c

With	c
love	c

As	i
an	i
accomodation	i
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
sleeping	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
because	c
I	c
enjoy	c
the	c
closeness	c
to	c
the	i
nature	c
while	c
camping	c
a	c
lot	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
your	c
reply	c
at	c
your	c
earliest	c
convenience	c
and	c
to	c
get	i
to	c
know	c
you	c
personally	c
in	c
July	c
.	c

Esther	c
Meyer	c

thanks	i
a	c
lot	c
for	c
your	c
long	c
letter	c
!	c

It	c
was	c
great	c
to	c
hear	c
from	c
you	c
again	c
after	c
such	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
.	c

My	i
job	i
was	i
it	i
,	i
to	c
help	c
to	c
keep	c
all	c
the	c
little	c
kids	c
out	c
of	c
the	c
backstage	c
area	c
.	c

Therefore	c
I	c
got	c
to	c
stay	c
backstage	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
and	c
to	c
see	c
all	c
the	c
members	c
of	c
the	c
"	c
Backstreet	c
Boys	c
"	c
.	c

I	c
sort	c
of	c
felt	c
,	i
like	c
I	c
had	c
done	c
my	c
part	c
to	c
make	c
the	c
concert	c
a	c
sucess	i
.	c

Anyway	c
,	c
I	c
've	c
got	c
to	c
study	c
now	c
,	i
we	i
've	i
got	c
a	c
maths	c
exam	c
tomorrow	c
.	c

Hope	c
to	c
hear	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c

However	c
,	c
we	c
have	c
seen	c
an	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
and	c
we	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
suggest	c
to	i
including	i
this	c
point	i
in	c
the	c
programme	c
.	c

The	c
show	c
is	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
the	c
14	c
of	c
March	c
from	c
10.00	c
to	c
19.00	c
and	c
we	c
fained	i
it	c
very	c
interesting	c
,	c
because	c
we	c
will	c
have	c
the	c
opportunity	c
to	c
see	c
mews	i
,	c
firstly	c
about	c
the	c
latest	c
fashions	c
,	c
secondly	c
concerning	c
leisure	c
and	c
sports	c
wear	c
and	c
finally	c
about	c
make	i
up	i
and	c
hairstyles	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
of	i
this	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
for	c
all	c
of	c
us	c
,	c
because	c
for	c
the	i
students	c
it	c
is	c
completely	c
free	c
.	c

We	c
were	c
thinking	c
that	c
meaby	i
we	c
can	c
go	c
early	c
to	c
visit	c
the	c
Science	c
Museum	c
and	c
than	i
go	c
to	c
the	c
Central	c
Exhibition	c
,	i
where	c
the	c
event	c
is	c
going	c
to	c
have	i
place	c
!	c

We	c
really	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
receiving	c
your	c
answer	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c
!	c

Almost	i
the	c
time	c
they	c
have	c
journalists	c
following	c
them	c
everywhere	c
and	i
all	i
the	i
time	i
,	c
looking	c
for	c
great	i
news	i
or	c
interesting	c
pictures	c
to	c
put	c
on	c
the	c
first	i
page	c
of	c
the	c
newspaper	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
think	c
this	c
is	c
very	c
nice	c
,	c
but	c
is	i
the	c
price	c
that	c
famous	c
people	c
have	c
to	c
pay	c
,	c
just	c
becouse	i
they	c
are	c
popular	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr.	c
Robertson	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
representative	i
of	c
our	c
class	c
in	i
your	i
college	i
to	c
write	c
to	c
you	c
.	c

We	c
are	c
very	c
grateful	c
for	c
what	i
you	i
have	i
well-organised	i
the	i
programme	i
going	i
to	i
London	i
for	i
us	i
.	c

Therefore	c
,	c
if	c
it	c
is	c
possible	c
,	c
we	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
show	c
in	c
the	c
afternoon	c
on	c
14	c
March	c
instead	c
of	c
going	c
shopping	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
as	c
human	c
beings	c
,	c
almost	c
all	c
of	c
us	c
are	c
curious	c
.	c

We	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
and	c
chat	c
about	c
gossip	c
.	c

This	c
is	c
why	c
gossip	c
magazines	c
are	c
so	c
popular	c
.	c

There	i
,	c
it	c
is	c
impossible	c
for	c
journalists	c
to	c
stop	c
chasing	c
them	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
journalists	c
should	c
not	c
only	c
think	c
about	c
commercial	i
value	i
,	c
but	i
morality	c
and	c
priciples	i
are	i
also	i
being	i
concerned	c
.	c

Of	c
course	c
,	c
it	i
everyone	c
pays	i
less	c
attention	c
or	c
interest	i
,	c
the	c
situations	i
should	i
be	c
better	c
.	c

I	c
remember	c
in	c
August	c
1997	c
Princess	c
Diana	c
died	i
in	c
the	c
car	c
crash	c
was	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
most	c
disarster	i
examples	c
.	c

Although	c
we	c
can	i
not	i
deny	c
it	c
is	c
our	c
nature	c
-	c
curious	i
,	i
we	c
can	c
improve	c
our	c
sence	i
of	c
morality	c
and	c
try	c
to	c
think	c
about	c
the	c
importance	c
of	c
privacy	c
for	c
them	c
.	c

Actually	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
happy	c
to	c
hear	c
that	c
journalists	c
have	c
learned	c
their	c
lesson	c
from	c
the	c
death	c
of	c
Princess	c
Diana	c
and	c
try	c
to	c
let	c
her	c
children	c
and	c
Royal	i
family	c
have	c
more	c
privacy	c
.	c

Lets	i
all	c
leave	c
them	c
more	c
freedom	c
to	c
enjoy	c
their	c
private	c
lives	c

We	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
because	c
there	c

It	c
's	c
nice	c
to	c
hear	c
from	c
you	c
again	c
.	c

In	c
your	c
letter	c
,	c
you	c
asked	c
me	c
wheter	i
the	c
book	c
I	c
've	c
read	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
suitable	c
present	c
for	c
your	c

You	c

's	c
my	c
passion	c

They	c
are	c
great	c
I	c
tell	c
you	c
!	c

But	c
I	c
think	c
your	c
cousin	c
is	c
too	c
young	c
for	c
it	i
.	c

That	c
might	i
be	c
quiet	i
complicated	i
to	c
understand	c
,	c
especially	c
for	c
young	c
people	c
.	c

She	c
's	c
an	c
American	c
and	c
her	c
books	c
concentrate	c
on	c
crime	c
and	c
detective	c
stories	c
.	c

Her	c
books	c
are	c
n't	c
difficult	c
to	c
understand	c
.	c

She	c
especially	i
write	i
books	i
for	c
young	c
people	c
.	c

And	c
I	c
think	c
this	c
book	c
is	c
a	c
very	c
good	c
one	c
for	c
your	c
cousin	c
.	c

You	c
wrote	c
that	c
your	c

quite	c
intered	i
in	c
magic	c

Indeed	i
it	i

free	c
for	c

as	c
we	c
are	c
students	c

May	c
I	c
suggest	c
an	c
alternative	c
?	i

We	c
could	c
go	c
to	c
science	i
museum	c
on	c
wednesday	i
morning	c
and	c
to	c
the	c
National	c
Art	c
Gallery	c

We	c

take	c
part	c
of	c
the	c
lunchtime	c
to	c
do	c
both	c
the	c

,	c
but	c
that	c
would	c
leave	i

Dear	c
Annette	c
,	c

I	c
understood	i
that	c
you	c
're	c
looking	c
for	c
your	i
cousin	i
's	i
birthday	i
present	i
,	c
and	c
you	c
'd	c
like	c
give	i
to	i
him	i
a	c
book	c
,	c
which	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
,	c
it	i
's	i
a	c
good	c
idea	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
a	c
fantastique	i
book	c
,	c
which	c
I	c
recommend	c
to	c
everybody	c
keen	c
on	c
lovestories	i
.	c

It	c
's	c
a	c
perfect	c
combinaison	i
between	i
passion	c
and	c
life	i
difficulties	c
.	c

I	c
recone	i
that	c
it	c
's	c
quite	i
not	c
an	c
easy	c
reading	i
,	c
but	c
as	c
you	c
described	c
your	c
cousin	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
she	c
really	c
will	c
enjoy	c
it	c
,	c
she	c
's	c
such	i
good	c
in	i
litteracy	i
,	i
that	c
it	c
wo	c
n't	c
be	c
a	c
problem	c
for	c
her	c
.	c

Love	c
from	c
,	i

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

Danny	c
BROOK	c
,	c
who	c
should	c
play	i
according	c
your	i
advertisement	c
was	i
replaced	c
by	c
an	i
another	c
actor	c
and	c
it	i
disappointed	c
me	c
.	c

Also	c
,	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
you	c
have	i
mentioned	i
discounts	c
which	c
were	c
not	c
provided	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
whole	c
,	c
the	c
evening	c
was	c
boring	c
and	c
disappointing	c
.	c

Based	c
on	c
everything	c
listed	c
above	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
recieve	i
£	i
10	c
,	i
which	c
I	c
have	i
paid	i
,	i
back	c
.	c

The	c
ticket	c
for	c
the	c
show	c
is	c
included	i
.	c

There	c
are	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
arguments	c
about	c
the	i
weather	i
this	c
influence	c
is	c
negative	c
or	c
positive	c
.	c

Nevertheless	c
,	c
it	c
has	c
affected	c
every	c
person	c
and	c
hopefully	c
in	c
a	c
good	c
way	c
.	c

Using	c
microwave	i
oven	c
or	c
vacuum	c
cleaner	c
saves	c
me	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
time	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
many	c
people	c
,	i
insist	c
that	c
new	c
technologies	c
affect	c
people	c
in	c
a	c
negative	c
way	c
.	c

But	c
also	c
,	i
I	c
would	i
not	i
be	i
able	c
to	c
imagine	c
my	c
life	c
without	c
the	i
nice	c
way	c
of	c
reciving	i
news	c
with	c
help	i
of	i
it	i
.	c

Counting	c
pros	i
and	c
cons	c
,	c
I	c
tend	c
to	c
think	c
that	c
there	c
are	c
more	c
positive	c
points	c
in	i
working	i
out	i
and	c
manufacturing	c
new	c
technologies	c
than	c
negative	c
ones	c
anyway	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
,	c

We	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
there	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
very	c
popular	c
nowadays	c
.	c

I	c
've	c
heard	c
that	c
Leisure	i
and	c
sports	c
wear	c
,	c
make	i
up	i
and	c
hairstyles	c
are	c
really	c
wonderful	c
.	c

We	c
all	c
know	c
that	c
you	c
organised	i
everything	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
be	c
very	c
pleased	c
if	c
you	c
let	c
us	c
to	i
go	i
to	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

I	c
also	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
say	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
organising	c
the	i
good	i
program	i
for	c
us	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

A	c
DAY	c
OF	i
MY	c
LIFE	c

I	c
was	c
afraid	c
of	i
doing	i
it	c
but	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
the	c
first	c
time	c
I	c
had	c
robbed	c
a	c
bank	c
.	c

I	c
promised	c
her	c
to	i
find	i
a	i
money	c
for	c
her	c
operation	c
.	c

She	c
was	c
at	c
the	c
hospital	c
and	c
she	c
was	c
really	c
bad	c
.	c

That	i
time	c
,	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
imagine	c
how	c
my	c
life	c
would	c
change	c
.	c

After	c
I	c
had	c
had	c
my	c
breakfast	c
I	c
put	c
my	c
clothes	c
on	c
.	c

I	c
told	c
everybody	c
to	c
lie	c
down	c
.	c

They	c
did	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
asked	c
cashier	i
to	c
give	c
me	c
all	c
money	i
.	c

Before	c
I	c
took	c
money	i
one	c
of	c
the	c
cashier	i
had	c
pressed	c
a	c
button	c
to	c
call	c
a	i
police	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
it	c
did	c
n't	c
take	c
long	c
that	i
they	i
caught	i
me	c
soon	i
.	c

The	c
worst	c
thing	c
was	c
my	c
friend	c
died	c
after	i
10	i
days	i
I	c
was	c
arrested	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
about	c
our	c
class	c
trip	c
to	c
London	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
appreciate	c
you	i
well-organised	c
programme	c
,	c
especially	c
,	i
"	i
River	c
Trip	c
to	c
Greenwich	c
"	c
which	c
we	c
requested	c
.	c

It	c
would	i
be	c
the	c
most	c
excising	i
activity	c
in	i
this	c
trip	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
saw	c
the	c
advertisement	c
of	i
"	c
THE	c
LONDON	c
FASHION	c
AND	c
LEISURE	c
SHOW	c
"	c
in	c
the	c
newspaper	c
today	c
,	c
and	c
told	c
all	c
classmates	i
about	c
it	c
.	c

We	c
are	c
very	c
interested	c
in	c
going	c
this	i
show	c
.	c

This	c
show	c
is	i
held	c
in	c
Central	i
Exhibition	c
Hall	c
,	c
London	c
on	c
Tue	c
.	c

Therefore	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
great	i
idea	c
to	c
visit	c
the	c
show	c
for	c
our	c
knowledgement	i
.	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
the	i
addmission	i
is	c
free	c
for	c
students	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
our	c
programm	i
is	c
fixed	c
but	c
I	c
think	c
we	c
could	c
change	c
the	i
part	c
of	c
the	c
programme	c
.	c

So	c
we	c
will	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
use	c
the	c
time	c
at	i
the	c
afternoon	c
on	c
14	c
,	i
March	c
for	c
visiting	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

I	c
strongly	c
agree	c
with	c
this	c
.	c

If	c
she	c
was	i
not	i
followed	c
by	c
journalists	c
,	c
she	c
would	c
n't	c
die	i
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
is	c
the	c
reason	c
why	c
journalists	c
are	c
still	c
chasing	c
famous	c
people	c
after	c
"	c
Princess	c
Diana	c
's	c
"	c
accident	c
.	c

We	c
have	c
to	c
think	c
about	c
this	i
way	c
.	c

Dear	c
Ms	c
Clark	c
,	c

I	c
enjoyed	c
most	c
of	c
the	c
events	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
feel	c
that	c
the	c
festival	c
could	c
be	c
even	c
better	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

Here	c
are	c
some	c
opinions	c
and	c
suggestions	c
:	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
pity	c
for	c
me	c
that	c
there	c
were	c
fewer	c
plays	c
and	c
films	c
than	c
I	c
had	c
expected	c
.	c

I	c
suggest	c
to	i
you	i
that	c
you	c
should	c
organise	c
more	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

Sincerely	c
yours	c
,	c

One	c
day	c
,	c
the	c
woman	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
riverside	c
,	c
and	c
found	c
a	c
peach	c
floating	c
in	c
the	c
river	c
.	c

She	c
brought	i
it	c
to	c
her	c
house	c
,	c
cutting	c
it	c
with	i
her	c
husband	c
.	c

To	c
their	c
surprise	c
,	c
there	c
was	c
a	c
boy	c
in	c
the	c
peach	c
!	c

He	c
made	c
up	c
his	c
mind	c
to	c
defeat	c
them	c
,	c
and	c
asked	c
his	c
stepmother	c
for	c
some	c
kibidango	c
,	c
one	c
of	c
traditional	c
snacks	c
in	c
Japan	c
.	c

After	c
that	c
,	c
they	c
went	c
home	c
.	c

All	c
the	c
people	c
in	c
Bizen	c
including	c
his	c
stepparents	c
met	i
Momotaro	c
and	c
his	c
friends	c
with	c
a	i
great	c
joy	c

I	c
have	c
received	c
your	i
good	c
news	c
and	c
I	c
'm	c
very	c
happy	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
always	c
wished	i
go	i
to	c
California	c
and	c
now	c
it	c
's	c
real	i
,	i
so	c
,	c
thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
about	i
that	c
.	c

With	c
regard	c
to	c
the	c
activities	c
at	c
the	c
Camp	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
choose	c
basketball	c
and	c
photography	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
basketball	c
is	c
very	i
complete	i
sport	c
for	c
training	c
your	c
muscles	c
and	c
I	c
used	c
to	c
play	c
in	c
a	c
league	c
in	c
my	c
country	c
,	i
it	i
's	i
hard	c
but	c
at	c
the	c
same	c
time	c
lovely	c
.	c

The	c
other	c
selection	i
has	c
been	c
done	i
because	c
I	c
like	c
to	i
much	c
discover	i
different	c
places	c
and	c
with	c
a	c
camera	c
is	i
possible	c
to	c
do	c
it	i
easily	c
.	c

If	c
it	c
possible	i
for	c
you	c
to	c
help	c
me	c
in	i
some	c
doubts	c
I	c
have	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

I	c
have	c
heard	c
from	c
you	c
recently	c
and	c
I	c
'm	c
really	c
happy	c
,	c
I	c
hope	c
you	c
and	c
your	c
family	c
are	c
well	c
.	c

I	c
know	c
that	c
my	c
girlfriend	c
told	c
you	c
that	c
I	c
was	c
helping	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
and	c
enjoyed	c
it	c
very	c
much	c
.	c

During	c
the	c
concert	c
I	c
listened	c
the	i
band	c
like	c
everybody	c
,	i
besides	c
I	c
earned	c
money	i
so	i
,	i
was	i
a	c
wonderful	c
experience	c
.	c

Looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hear	i
from	c
you	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
,	c

On	c
behalf	c
of	c
our	c
class	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
some	c
information	c
about	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
show	c
,	i
that	c
we	c
saw	c
advertised	c
and	c
we	c
are	c
interested	c
indeed	i
.	c

In	c
addition	c
we	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
about	i
the	c
programme	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
some	c
details	c
about	c
this	c
show	c
.	c

The	c
most	c
important	c
thing	c
is	c
that	c
the	c
time	c
that	c
the	c
show	c
starts	c
is	c
perfect	c
and	c
is	c
suitable	i
as	c
well	c
with	c
our	c
programme	c
because	c
until	i
19:00	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
everyone	c
will	c
have	c
finished	c
their	c
shopping	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
more	c
details	c
about	c
the	c
show	c
and	c
particularly	c
what	i
does	i
it	c
include	i
.	c

The	c
latest	c
fashion	i
will	c
be	c
on	c
show	c
and	c
also	c
the	c
Leisure	c
and	c
sports	c
wear	c
.	c

Really	c
interesting	c
!	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
it	i
will	i
be	i
a	i
great	i
opportunity	i
to	i
all	i
of	i
us	i
to	i
be	i
on	i
this	i
show	i
while	c
we	c
are	c
going	i
to	i
be	i
in	c
London	c
.	c

But	c
,	i
if	c
there	c
is	c
a	c
problem	c
that	i
the	c
show	c
is	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
afternoon	c
,	c
the	c
same	c
hour	i
with	i
shopping	i
,	c
I	c
suggest	c
having	i
the	i
shopping	c
on	c
Wednesday	c
afternoon	c
that	i
we	c
will	c
not	c
have	c
anything	c
to	c
do	c
!	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
your	c
reply	c
,	c

Some	c
people	c
think	c
that	c
to	i
be	i
a	c
famous	c
person	c
is	c
very	i
excuiting	i
thing	c
,	c
that	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
this	c
makes	c
you	c
feel	c
completely	i
and	c
also	c
they	c
think	c
that	c
if	c
you	c
are	c
famous	c
you	c
are	c
special	c
as	c
well	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
the	i
politicians	c
the	i
have	c
choosed	i
their	c
careers	c
,	i
they	c
must	c
know	c
that	c
they	i
are	i
going	i
to	i
involved	i
with	i
everything	i
that	i
it	i
has	i
to	i
do	i
with	i
publicity	i
and	i
their	i
country	i
and	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
is	i
that	c
they	c
have	c
to	c
realize	c
that	c
they	c
should	c
be	c
extremely	c
careful	c
of	i
their	c
movements	c
or	c
else	c
they	c
are	c
going	c
to	c
have	c
bad	i
reputation	c
,	c
and	c
they	c
will	c
be	i
not	i
trustworthy	i
.	c

Another	i
succesfull	i
carreer	i
such	i
as	i
,	i
film	i
stars	i
must	i
also	i
be	i
balanced	i
.	c

If	c
somebody	c
wants	c
to	c
be	c
famous	c
of	c
cource	i
must	i
be	c
on	i
the	i
top	i
and	c
the	c
mass	c
media	c
will	c
be	c
following	c
him	c
or	c
her	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
the	i
are	c
limits	c
.	c

Everybody	c
deserve	i
to	c
have	c
a	c
private	c
life	c
even	c
if	c
he	c
is	c
a	c
plumber	c
or	c
even	c
if	c
she	c
is	c
a	c
famous	c
singer	c
.	c

And	c
finally	c
the	c
journalists	c
the	i
should	c
know	c
how	c
to	c
respect	c
the	c
private	c
life	i
of	c
everyone	c
and	c
not	c
trying	i
to	c
make	c
money	c
for	i
a	i
living	i
by	c
using	c
the	c
reputation	c
of	c
the	i
famous	c
people	c
.	c

Dear	c
Jane	c
Clark	c

Hello	c
,	c
I	c
spent	c
two	c
days	c
at	c
your	c
annual	c
international	c
arts	c
festival	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
International	i
Arts	c
Festival	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
idea	c
,	c
because	c
you	c
can	c
see	c
how	c
other	c
country	i
's	i
art	c
is	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
think	c
in	c
this	c
festival	c
,	c
there	c
were	c
too	i
many	i
country	i
's	i
people	i
.	c

I	c
think	c
your	c
country	c
and	c
our	c
country	c
's	c
rules	c
are	c
the	c
same	c
.	c

This	c
is	c
very	c
important	c
,	c
because	c
many	c
accidents	c
happen	c
because	c
of	c
running	c
.	c

When	c
we	c
need	c
to	c
go	c
upstairs	c
,	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
keep	c
left	c
and	c
when	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
go	c
downstairs	c
,	c
you	c
need	c
to	c
keep	c
left	c
as	c
well	c
.	c

You	c
ca	c
n't	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
toilet	c
during	c
the	c
class	c
,	c
because	c
you	c
are	c
interrupting	c
the	c
other	c
student	i
's	i
study	c
and	c
there	c
are	c
more.	c
.	c

like	c
when	c
the	c
class	c
starts	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
keep	c
quiet	c
and	c
you	c
ca	c
n't	c
say	c
anything	c
while	c
the	c
teacher	c
speaks	c
.	c

Second	c
,	c
at	c
home	c
we	c
all	c
have	c
different	c
rules	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
the	c
main	c
rule	c
is	c
when	c
you	c
can	c
play	c
computer	c
games	c
,	c
because	c
they	c
love	c
computer	c
games	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
curious	c
about	c
it	c
.	c

Your	i
best	c
wishes	c
from	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
:	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
being	i
organised	i
the	c
programme	c
for	c
our	c
class	c
,	i
I	c
think	c
you	c
may	i
think	i
about	i
a	i
long	i
time	i
that	i
how	c
shall	i
we	i
study	c
during	c
three	i
days	c
.	c

In	c
other	c
words	c
,	c
what	c
they	c
will	c
introduce	i
,	i
is	c
most	i
interested	i
in	i
us	c
,	i
I	i
mean	i
it	i
's	i
conflict	i
with	c
your	c
plan	c
,	i
what	i
a	c
pity	c
!	c

So	c
,	c
we	c
do	c
n't	c
want	c
lose	i
this	c
chance	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
we	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
get	c
your	c
permition	i
to	c
go	c
,	i
maybe	i
if	c
it	c
is	c
possible	c
that	c
you	c
change	i
your	c
programme	c
,	c
we	c
may	i
be	i
going	i
to	c
your	c
college	c
any	c
time	c
after	c
Tuesday	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
dangerous	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
knew	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
.	c

Personally	c
,	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
say	c
I	c
was	c
good	c
at	c
swimming	c
.	c

One	c
day	c
,	c
I	c
passed	c
by	c
a	c
river	c
in	i
accident	i
,	i
I	c
saw	c
there	c
were	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
people	c
playing	c
in	c
the	c
river	c
.	c

Suddenly	c
,	c
I	c
heard	c
of	i
"	c
help	i
,	c
help	c
"	c
in	c
my	i
distance	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
jumped	c
into	c
the	c
river	c
,	i
I	c
really	i
knew	c
that	c
was	c
dangerous	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
have	i
n't	i
think	c
about	c
anything	c
except	c
"	i
justify	i
"	i
this	i
word	i
.	c

When	c
I	c
went	i
the	c
river-side	i
bank	c
,	c
I	c
saw	c
some	c
red-faced	i
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
organising	c
an	c
International	c
Arts	c
Festival	c
was	c
a	c
great	c
idea	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
could	c
hardly	c
participated	i
in	i
all	c
of	c
the	c
concerts	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
really	c
a	c
reasonably-priced	i
weekend	c
for	c
me	c
,	c
but	c
you	c
should	c
also	c
recognise	i
new	c
activities	c
like	c
competitions	c
on	i
singing	c
songs	c
,	i
drawing	i
a	c
portrate	i
next	c
year	c
.	c

Thanks	c
for	c
everything	c
.	c

Dear	c
Ana	c
,	c

It	c
is	c
nice	c
to	c
hear	c
from	c
you	c
again	c
.	c

Everywhere	c
and	c
everytime	i
in	c
our	c
lives	c
we	c
face	i
with	c
the	i
rules	c
.	c

Some	c
find	i
them	c
as	c
a	c
source	c
of	c
protection	c
of	c
their	c
rights	c
and	c
others	c
as	c
a	c
limitation	c
of	c
them	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
these	c
are	c
international	c
rules	c
which	c
help	c
things	c
to	c
go	i
in	c
order	c
.	c

You	c
should	c
wear	c
the	c
same	c
things	c
every	c
time	c
,	c
no	c
changes	c
and	c
alternations	c
are	c
allowed	c
.	c

It	c
makes	c
us	c
like	c
robots	c
and	c
feel	i
bad	c
psychologically	c
,	c
because	c
we	c
want	c
to	c
be	c
different	c
and	c
free	c
in	c
wearing	i
.	c

Also	c
the	c
attendance	c
rules	c
put	c
a	c
strain	c
on	c
us	c
.	c

If	c
we	c
do	c
n't	c
come	c
to	c
school	c
for	c
10	c
days	c
,	c
then	c
we	c
ca	c
n't	c
pass	c
the	c
class	i
.	c

At	c
homes	i
we	c
have	i
again	i
rules	c
,	c
but	c
more	c
flexible	c
ones	c
.	c

You	c
should	c
be	c
punctual	c
when	c
coming	c
to	c
dining	i
table	c
,	c
respectful	c
,	c
do	c
your	c
home	i
works	i
and	c
watch	c
TV	c
less	c
and	c
not	c
too	c
loud	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
change	c
the	c
attendance	c
and	c
clothing	c
rules	c
in	c
school	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
the	i
enough	c
power	c
.	c

They	c
are	c
against	c
democracy	c
I	c
think	c
.	c

With	c
all	c
my	c
love	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
a	c
musical	i
show	c
that	c
I	c
saw	c
in	i
your	c
theatre	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
act	c
there	i
,	c
but	c
he	c
was	c
replaced	c
by	c
another	c
actor	c
.	c

This	c
situation	c
made	c
me	c
feel	c
very	c
disappointed	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
should	c
have	c
started	c
at	c
19:30	c
p.m.	c
,	c
and	c
it	c
began	c
fourty-five	i
minutes	c
later	i
.	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
coffe	i
after	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
but	c
when	c
I	c
tried	c
to	c
get	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

They	c
organized	c
everything	c
.	c

The	c
event	c
was	c
going	c
to	c
take	c
place	c
in	c
the	c
garden	c
of	i
Paula	c
's	c
house	c
.	c

The	c
others	c
had	c
to	c
bring	c
food	c
.	c

Ballons	i
and	c
coloured	c
lights	c
were	c
put	c
in	c
all	c
the	c
trees	c
.	c

Some	c
time	c
later	c
all	i
the	i
things	i
were	i
finally	c
prepared	c
.	c

The	c
garden	c
was	c
wonderful	c
.	c

But	c
things	c
did	c
n't	c
happen	c
as	c
they	c
had	i
been	i
planned	i
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
happy	c
to	c
know	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
you	i
competition	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
all	c
the	c
details	c
that	c
you	c
need	c
from	c
me	c
.	c

Let	c
me	c
tell	c
you	c
that	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
sing	c
and	c
play	c
tennis	c
.	c

As	c
a	c
matter	c
of	c
fact	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
both	c
of	c
them	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
the	i
great	c
opportunity	c
you	c
give	i
us	c

especially	c
in	c
planing	i
all	c
this	c
programme	c
in	c
a	i
such	i
acurate	i
way	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
this	c
programme	c
has	i
a	i
good	i
organisation	i
,	c
as	c
you	c
know	c

due	i
to	i
we	c
have	c
enough	c
time	c
to	c
visit	c
plenty	c
of	c
local	c
interest	c
points	c
.	c

But	c
,	i
I	c
was	c
wondering	c
,	c
like	i
a	c
student	c
of	c
this	c
college	c
,	c
if	c
we	c
would	i
change	c
part	c
of	c
this	c
programme	c
.	c

.	c
.	c

we	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
.	c

In	c
this	c
way	c
,	c
we	c
can	c
go	c
to	c
visit	c
the	c
Science	c
Museum	c
earlier	c
in	c
the	c
morning	c
and	c
the	i
,	i
we	c
can	c
go	c

What	c
do	c
you	c
expect	c
about	i
the	c
future	c
?	c

Well	c
,	c
you	c
can	c
look	c
at	c
your	c
house	c
.	c

.	c
.	c

Nowadays	c
,	c
we	c
have	c
all	c
kind	i
of	c
instruments	c
to	i
washing	c
up	c
the	c
dishes	c
,	c
to	i
cook	i
to	c
be	c
more	c
comfortable	i
,	c
for	c
example	c
the	i
TV	c
,	c
the	c
video	c
recorder	c
,	c
etc	c
.	c

We	c
will	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
accelerate	i
the	c
process	i
of	c
the	i
computer	i
's	i
games	c
for	i
example	c
...	c

But	c
not	c
in	c
the	i
strange	c
way	c
you	c
can	c
imagine	c
...	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
I	c
strongly	c
believe	c
that	c
the	i
the	c
house	c
of	c
the	c
future	c
will	c
be	c
the	c
house	c
of	c
a	c
new	c
mindness	i
it	c
will	c
be	c
a	c
very	c
positiu	i
point	c
for	c
opening	c
our	i
lifes	i
.	c

Think	c
about	c
it	c
.	c

Dear	c
Principal	c
,	c
First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
we	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
good	i
programme	c
which	c
provides	c
us	c
3	i
days	i
stay	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
certain	c
that	c
the	c
programme	c
will	c
give	c
the	c
students	c
considerable	c
enjoyment	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
we	c
have	c
found	c
an	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
show	c
,	c
which	c
will	c
be	c
held	c
at	c
Central	c
Exhibition	c
Hall	c
on	c
14th	c
of	c
March	c
.	c

All	c
of	c
us	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
attend	c
the	c
show	c
because	c
young	c
people	c
,	c
particularly	c
girls	c
are	i
interested	c
in	c
fashion	c
and	c
make	i
up	i
,	c
so	c
we	c
are	c
expecting	c
the	c
show	c
will	i
be	i
the	i
great	c
opportunity	c
to	c
see	c
what	c
the	c
new	c
trend	i
in	c
fashion	c
will	c
be	c
like	c
.	c

It	c
seems	c
to	c
be	c
good	c
to	c
change	c
the	c
programme	c
of	c
14th	c
into	i
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
show	c
,	c
instead	c
of	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c

We	c
think	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
a	c
very	c
interesting	c
trip	c
,	c
especially	c
the	c
sightseeing	c
by	c
bus	c
.	c

In	c
our	c
class	c
,	c
we	c
have	c
read	c
an	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
"	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
"	c
,	c
which	c
will	c
take	c
place	c
at	c
the	c
Central	c
Exhibition	c
Hall	c
in	c
London	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
14	c
March	c
from	c
10:00	c
to	c
19:00	c
.	c

As	c
we	c
are	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
in	c
London	c
on	c
this	c
date	c
,	c
we	c
think	c
,	i
it	c
could	c
be	c
a	c
great	c
oppurtunity	i
for	c
us	c
to	c
go	c
there	c
because	c
we	c
are	c
very	c
interested	c
in	c
the	c
latest	c
fashions	c
,	c
make	c
up	c
,	c
etc.	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
free	c
for	c
students	c
.	c

Because	c
of	c
this	c
reasons	i
,	c
we	c
would	c
kindy	i
ask	c
you	c
to	c
change	c
the	c
programme	c
,	i
so	c
that	c
we	c
could	c
go	c
to	c
this	c
especial	i
event	c
.	c

We	c
suggest	c
visiting	c
the	c
Science	c
Museum	c
in	c
the	c
afternoon	c
on	c
Wednesday	c
15	c
March	c
and	c
canceling	i

Yours	c
sincerely	c

It	c
was	c
dangerous	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
knew	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
having	c
holidays	i
with	c
my	c
parents	c
and	c
some	c
friends	c
in	c
India	c
and	c
we	c
were	c
enjoying	c
talking	c
to	c
people	c
and	c
eating	c
the	c
local	c
food	c
.	c

One	c
day	c
we	c
were	c
invited	c
from	i
locals	i
to	c
visit	c
a	c
little	c
town	c
five	c
hours	c
away	c
from	c
New	c
Dehli	c
.	c

Although	c
my	c
parents	c
were	c
very	c
happy	c
of	i
having	c
such	c
an	i
especial	i
opportunity	c
visiting	i
a	c
place	c
with	c
no	c
tourists	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
little	c
bit	c
scared	c
.	c

In	c
this	c
country	c
my	c
parents	c
used	c
to	c
buy	c
water	c
in	c
bottles	c
to	c
have	c
it	c
clean	c
,	c
but	c
in	c
the	c
little	c
town	c
we	c
did	c
n't	c
had	i
this	i
possibility	i
and	c
the	c
family	c
where	c
we	c
were	c
staying	c
with	i
,	i
kindly	c
boiled	c
the	c
water	c
for	c
us	c
.	c

The	c
first	c
week	c
was	c
find	i
,	c
but	c
on	i
the	c
second	c
week	c
I	c
got	c
very	c
seek	i
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
was	c
the	c
water	c
.	c

My	c
mother	c
tried	c
to	c
get	c
a	c
doctor	c
,	c
but	c
they	c
said	c
there	c
was	c
no	c
one	c
.	c

For	c
the	c
accommodation	c
I	c
prefer	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
some	c
problems	c
with	c
my	c
back	c
and	c
I	c
need	c
a	c
bed	c
to	c
sleep	c
in	c
.	c

I	c
can	c
do	c
two	c
activities	c
during	c
my	c
stay	c
at	c
the	c
camp	c
.	c

The	c
first	c
one	c
I	c
choose	i
is	c
swimming	c
.	c

One	c
question	c
,	c
I	c
just	c
want	c
to	c
know	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
do	c
I	c
take	c
with	c
me	c
?	c

And	c
how	c
many	i
money	c
do	c
I	c
need	c
?	c

I	c
thank	c
you	c
in	c
advance	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

You	c
want	c
to	c
hear	c
about	c
my	c
experience	c
in	i
helping	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
.	c

You	c
ca	c
n't	c
imagine	c
how	c
funny	i
it	c
was	c
!	c

You	c
could	c
do	c
so	c
many	c
things	c
because	c
you	c
received	c
a	c
free-pass	i
which	c
allowed	c
you	c
to	c
go	c
where	c
you	c
wanted	c
and	c
it	i
was	c
what	c
I	c
had	i
prefer	i
about	c
this	c
experience	c
.	c

I	c
really	c
enjoyed	c
to	i
serve	i
the	c
drinks	c
to	c
the	c
pop-stars	c
.	c

And	c
you	c
heard	c
the	c
concerts	c
too	c
.	c

One	c
more	c
word	c
!	c

I	c
did	c
n't	c
regret	c
it	c
and	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
again	c
!	c

Write	c
me	i
soon	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
providing	i
International	i
Arts	c
Festival	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
give	c
some	c
suggestions	c
for	c
next	c
year	c
as	c
I	c
have	c
read	c
the	c
advertisement	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
could	c
you	c
invite	c
stars	c
and	c
artists	c
from	c
more	c
than	c
only	c
six	c
contries	i
?	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
it	c
might	c
be	c
better	c
to	c
have	c
time	c
with	c
variety	i
nationallites	i
.	c

Lastly	c
,	c
it	c
could	c
be	c
nice	c
to	i
students	c
who	c
are	c
interested	c
in	c
arts	i
,	c
if	c
you	c
help	i
special	c
events	c
,	c
for	c
instance	c
,	c
song	i
contest	c
,	c
writing	c
competition	c
or	c
dance	c
lessons	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
do	c
,	c
make	i
sure	i
why	c
you	c
want	c
to	c
earn	c
money	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
recommending	c
you	c
to	i
check	i
your	c
possible	c
time	c
to	c
work	c
-	c
weekdays	c
or	c
weekend	c
?	c

before	c
you	c

a	c

If	c
you	c
just	c
decide	c
to	c
work	c
,	c
you	c
'd	c
better	c
to	i
find	i
a	c
job	c
in	i
your	c
place	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
go	c
to	c
your	c
school	c
or	c
local	c
council	c
.	c

They	c
will	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
help	c
to	c

for	c
students	c

you	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
make	c
a	c
complaint	c
about	c
the	c
show	c
'	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
'	c
.	c

During	c
my	c
stay	c
in	c
London	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
your	c
theatre	c
to	c
see	c
this	c
show	c
.	c

As	i
it	c
is	i
said	i
in	c
your	c
advertisement	c
,	i
the	c
show	c
is	i
starring	i
Danny	c
Brook	c
but	i
there	c
was	c
different	i
actor	c
.	i

It	i
is	c
not	c
the	c
only	c
problem	c
.	c

You	c
promised	c
that	c
there	c
will	i
be	c
discounts	c
,	c
but	c
when	c
I	c
came	i
,	c
I	c
found	c
out	c
,	i
that	c
they	c
were	c
not	c
available	c
.	c

I	c
wanted	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
your	c
restaurant	c
.	c

I	c
invited	c
a	c
friend	c
of	c
mine	c
and	c
promised	c
her	c
that	c
we	c
will	i
go	c
there	c
.	c

You	c
promised	c
that	c
if	c
we	c
go	i
to	c
your	c
show	c
we	c
will	i
have	c
a	c
perfect	c
evening	c
.	c

Everything	c
was	c
just	c
vice	i
versa	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
disappointed	c
,	i
that	i
is	c
why	c
I	c
am	c
asking	c
you	c
for	c
compensation	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
not	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

My	c
class	c
was	c
going	c
to	c
a	c
night	i
disco	i
and	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
go	c
there	c
too	c
.	c

But	c
all	c
they	c
have	i
done	i
is	i
told	i
me	c
that	c
I	c
am	c
to	c
young	c
for	c
it	i
and	c
I	c
can	c
go	c
there	c
only	c
when	c
I	c
am	c
20	c
years	c
old	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
such	c
a	c
desire	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
disco	c
,	i
that	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
go	c
even	c
without	c
parent	i
's	i
permission	c
.	c

But	c
she	c
told	c
it	c
to	c
very	i
kid	c
in	c
school	c
,	c
even	c
the	c
teachers	c
heard	c
it	c
.	c

It	c
occured	i
that	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
teachers	c
told	c
my	c
parents	c
about	c
it	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs.	c
Jane	c
X	c
,	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
make	c
some	c
appoitments	i
about	c
the	c
event	c
that	c
I	c
had	i
been	i
.	i

-	c
Art	c
exbitions	i
to	c
know	i
more	i
things	c
about	c
artist	i
's	c
lifestyle	c
;	c
and	c

-	c
talks	c
by	c
writers	c
to	c
say	c
how	c
good	c
is	i
his	i
latest	i
book	i
.	c

In	c
addictions	i
,	c
the	c
ticket	i
's	i
price	i
is	i
too	c
expensive	c
and	c
difficult	i
to	c
buy	c
another	i
one	c
every	c
day	c
,	i
so	i
,	c
I	c
think	c
is	i
more	c
effective	c
if	c
was	i
one	c
reasonably-priced	c
weekend	c
ticket	c
for	c
all	c
events	c
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
I	c
hope	i
will	i
be	c
better	c
next	c
year	c
if	c
these	c
points	c
was	i
observed	c
for	i
the	i
each	i
year	i
the	i
event	i
to	i
be	i
better	c
than	c
before	c
.	c

Sincerely	c

I	c
remember	c
these	i
time	c
in	c
our	c
class	c
when	c
us	i
talking	i
many	i
time	c
about	c
rules	c
and	c
I	i
am	i
missing	i
that	i
time	i
so	i
much	i
.	c

Well	c
,	c
about	c
rules	c
in	c
my	c
contry	i
,	c
is	i
not	c
different	c
than	i
another	i
countries	c
.	c

You	c
must	c
to	i
be	i
organise	i
,	c
clean	c
and	c
respect	c
the	c
right	i
of	c
other	c
people.	c
.	i

While	c
I	c
was	c
staying	c
in	c
London	c
for	c
a	c
holiday	c
,	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
to	c
see	c
OVER	c
THE	c
RAINBOW	c
in	c
the	c
evening	c
.	c

That	c
made	c
me	c
feel	c
disappointed	c
.	c

I	c
meant	i
he	c
was	c
not	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
it	i
took	i
times	i
to	i
wait	i
about	c
forty	i
five	i
minutes	c
,	c
because	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
.	c

It	c
should	c
be	c
on	c
time	c
at	c
19:30	c
.	c

Due	c
to	c
being	c
a	c
student	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
I	c
should	c
have	c
got	c
the	c
discount	c
from	i
your	c
ticket	c
with	i
ID	i
card	c
.	c

Besides	c
this	c
,	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	i
early	i
closed	i
.	c

Lastly	c
,	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
think	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
my	c
perfect	c
evening	c
.	c

Griffin	c
,	c
who	c
is	c
a	c
teacher	c
,	c
was	c
n't	c
surprised	c
at	c
our	c
preparation	c
.	c

She	c
has	i
just	i
learnt	i
with	c
us	c
for	c
three	c
weeks	c
.	c

She	c
is	c
not	c
talkative	c
,	c
kind	i
,	i
and	c
reserved	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
this	i
party	c
she	c
took	i
part	i
in	i
,	i
she	c
was	c
responsible	c
for	c
preparing	c
food	c
.	c

While	c
she	c
was	c
choosing	c
vegetables	c
in	i
a	c
market	c
,	c
she	c
came	c
across	c
him	c
.	c

When	c
he	c
asked	c
her	c
'	i
why	i
do	c
you	c
choose	c
deliberately	i
?	c
'	c
,	c
she	c
answered	c
without	c
thinking	c
.	c

Dear	c
Jean	c
Clark	c
,	c

I	c
recently	c
spent	c
two	c
days	c
at	c
your	c
Annual	c
International	c
Arts	c
Festival	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
express	c
my	c
opinion	c
about	c
it	c
.	c

But	c
it	c
is	c
also	c
true	c
I	c
could	c
just	c
see	c
stars	c
and	c
artists	c
on	c
stage	c
from	c
only	c
six	c
countries	c
,	c
not	c
stars	c
from	c
around	c
the	c
world	c
as	c
you	c
announce	i
in	c
your	c
advertisement	c
.	c

Secondly	c
I	i
really	c
enjoyed	c
the	c
jazz	c
and	c
classical	c
concerts	c
in	c
spite	c
of	c
the	c
fact	c
that	c
some	c
of	c
them	c
were	i
taken	i
place	c
in	c
too	c
small	c
concert	c
halls	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
good	c
idea	c
the	i
fact	i
to	i
buy	i
only	c
one	c
ticket	c
for	c
all	c
the	c
events	c
since	c
I	c
just	i
spent	c
the	c
time	c
watching	c
and	c
enjoying	c
all	c
of	c
them	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
hearing	i
from	c
you	c
.	c

Your	i
sincerely	c

Sorry	c
it	c
's	c
been	c
too	c
long	c
since	c
I	c
last	c
wrote	c
but	c
I	c
've	c
been	c
so	c
busy	c
at	c
school	c
that	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
answer	c
you	c
before	c
.	c

First	c
I	i
must	c
tell	c
you	c
that	c
teachers	i
are	c
strict	c
at	c
school	c
.	c

We	c
are	c
n't	c
allowed	c
to	c
eat	c
in	c
the	c
classrooms	c
and	c
in	c
addition	c
to	c
this	c
we	c
must	c
sit	c
down	c
in	i
individual	c
desks	c
.	c

How	c
boring	c
!	c

At	c
home	c
everything	c
is	c
quite	c
good	c
,	c
mum	i
and	c
dad	c
are	c
great	c
but	c
there	c
's	c
one	c
main	c
rule	c
I	i
must	c
tell	c
them	c
were	i
I	c
go	i
and	c
what	c
time	c
I	c
'll	c
come	c
back	c
.	c

Granny	c
is	c
the	c
problem	c
she	i
's	c
a	c
bit	c
bossy	c
!	c

Give	c
my	c
love	c
to	c
your	c
parents	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
the	c
excellent	c
organization	c
of	c
this	c
trip	c
which	c
seems	c
to	c
be	c
very	c
interesting	c
and	c
useful	c
for	c
the	c
students	c
.	c

Especially	i
I	i
believe	c
that	c
the	c
visit	c
to	c
the	c
National	c
Art	c
Gallery	c
will	c
be	c
a	c
really	c
exciting	c
experience	c
for	c
all	c
of	c
us	c
.	c

Under	i
the	i
circumstances	i
,	c
I	c
was	c
asked	c
by	c
the	c
class	c
to	c
inform	c
you	c
about	c
the	c
show	c
and	c
to	c
ask	c
if	c
it	c
could	i
be	c
possible	c
to	c
make	c
some	c
changes	c
in	i
the	c
programme	c
if	c
it	c
could	i
to	i
visit	i
the	c
Exhibition	i
.	c

It	c
will	c
take	c
place	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
from	c
10.00am	c
to	c
19.00pm	i
,	c
so	c
we	c
could	c
give	c
up	c
the	i
shopping	c
and	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
show	c
in	c
the	c
afternoon	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
will	c
consider	c
this	c
possibility	c
and	c
tell	c
us	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c
if	c
you	c
intend	c
to	c
accept	c
our	c
proposal	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	i

Being	c
famous	i
and	i
risk	i
is	c
something	c
all	c
of	c
us	c
have	c
dreamt	c
of	c
sometimes	i
.	c

But	c
not	i
always	i
famous	i
people	i
are	i
happy	c
of	i
their	c
condition	i
.	c

Whenever	c
they	c
go	c
out	c
they	c
are	c
suddenly	c
"	c
hounded	c
"	c
by	c
groups	c
of	c
journalists	c
and	c
photographers	c
who	c
want	c
an	c
interview	c
or	c
a	c
photo	c
.	c

They	c
can	i
not	i
even	c
have	c
a	c
pizza	c
with	c
friend	i
who	i
stops	c
them	c
and	c
asks	c
them	c
for	c
an	c
autograph	c
.	c

Also	c
the	c
most	c
famous	c
star	c
can	c
be	c
unhappy	c
and	c
depresed	i
:	c
not	i
always	i
,	i
in	i
fact	i
,	i
money	i
and	i
celebrity	i
being	i
happiness	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
just	c
recieved	i
the	c
letter	c
,	c
which	c
lets	c
me	c
know	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
proud	c
of	c
winning	c
it	c
and	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
say	c
how	c
thankful	i
I	c
am	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
student	c
and	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
.	c

Because	i
I	c
intend	c
to	c
take	c
examination	i
in	c
Septenber	i
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
at	i
log	c
cabins	c
rather	c
than	c
tents	c
.	c

The	c
next	c
consideration	c
is	c
the	c
activities	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
be	c
most	c
grateful	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
give	c
me	c
further	c
advicable	i
information	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

Hello	c
!	c

I	c
hope	c
everything	c
around	c
you	c
is	c
alright	c
.	c

which	i
I	c
must	c
have	c
set	c
thousands	c
chairs	i
correctly	c
and	c
after	c
finishing	c
I	c
put	c
them	c
back	c
nicely	c
.	c

Naturally	c
I	c
agreed	c
and	c
I	c
could	c
enjoy	c
their	c
gig	c
as	c
audience	i
.	c

It	c
was	c
absolutely	c
fantastic	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
suggest	c
you	c
should	c
try	c
as	c
I	c
did	c
if	c
you	c
have	c
any	c
opportunity	c
.	c

Love	c
,	c

The	c
show	c
is	c
opened	i
between	c
ten	c
and	c
seven	c
p.m	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
,	c
March	c
14	c
at	i
Central	i
Exhibition	c
Hall	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
,	c
the	i
addmission	i
for	c
students	c
is	c
free	c
.	c

Taking	c
the	c
programme	c
and	c
the	c
show	c
into	c
consideration	c
,	c
we	c
suggest	c
that	c
we	c
can	i
have	c
time	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
show	c
in	c
the	c
afternoon	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerily	i
,	c

It	i
is	c
no	c
doubt	c
that	c
functions	i
and	c
structures	c
of	c
the	c
home	c
have	c
been	c
changing	c
as	c
well	c
as	c
that	c
of	c
transformation	i
,	i
for	i
example	i
,	i
have	i
been	i
.	c

People	c
may	c
tend	c
to	c
avoid	i
from	i
living	i
in	i
a	i
large	i
number	i
of	i
families	i
in	i
an	i
expected	i
small	i
house	i
in	i
a	i
city	i
.	c

People	c
always	c
need	c
their	c
parents	c
,	c
children	c
and	c
so	c
on	c
.	c

The	c
longer	c
and	c
further	i
they	c
live	c
on	c
their	c
own	c
,	c
the	c
more	c
they	c
may	c
feel	c
that	c
they	c
need	c
a	c
family	c
.	c

New	c
materials	c
will	c
surly	i
change	c
the	c
home	c
of	c
the	c
future	c
in	c
any	i
ways	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
surprised	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
's	c
more	c
exciting	c
to	c
be	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
than	c
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
do	c
Basketball	c
and	c
Painting	c
.	c

I	c
played	c
Basketball	c
at	c
school	c
for	c
about	c
two	c
years	c
.	c

I	c
like	c
painting	c
very	c
much	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
I	c
am	c
good	c
in	i
Painting	c
.	c

I	c
paint	c
a	c
lot	c
in	c
my	c
free	c
time	c
.	c

I	c
prefer	c
painting	c
landscapes	c
and	c
fantasy-pictures	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
,	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
will	c
we	c
need	c
?	c

I	c
hope	c
to	c
hear	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

I	c
think	c
first	c
of	c
all	c
we	c
should	c
film	c
an	c
english	i
lesson	c
,	c
where	c
pupils	c
could	c
prepare	c
some	c
group	c
work	c
or	c
information-boards	i
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
also	c
important	c
to	c
present	c
a	c
comercial	i
english	i
lesson	c
,	i
maybe	i
the	c
pupils	c
could	c
write	c
"	c
offers	c
and	c
orders	c
"	c
or	c
enquiries	c
on	c
the	c
blackboard	c
.	c

It	c
would	c
be	c
funny	c
to	c
present	i
the	c
computers	c
,	c
which	c
are	c
often	c
overcharged	i
,	c
or	i
often	c
the	c
netserver	i
is	i
spinning	i
.	c

It	c
's	c
really	c
funny	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
helpless	c
teacher	c
,	c
who	c
wants	c
to	c
go	c
on	c
writing	i
in	c
excel	i
or	c
a	i
word	i
text	i
,	c
while	c
the	c
computers	c
do	c
not	c
work	c
or	c
brake	i
down	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
this	i
are	c
the	c
most	c
interesting	c
things	c
in	c
our	c
school	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
afraid	c
that	c
reality	c
had	c
nothing	c
common	c
with	c
the	c
things	c
I	c
suspected	i
to	c
meet	i
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
the	c
prices	c
were	c
n't	c
lower	i
in	i
any	i
cases	i
although	i
you	i
advertised	i
the	i
information	i
like	i
that	i
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
when	c
the	c
play	c
started	c
at	c
last	c
,	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
look	c
at	c
the	c
actors	c
.	c

Especially	i
I	c
was	c
disappointed	c
by	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
who	i
made	c
me	c
nervous	c
with	c
his	c
lack	c
of	c
talent	c
.	c

After	c
that	c
,	c
I	c
should	c
also	c
mention	c
,	i
that	c
this	c
evening	c
was	c
dull	c
,	c
boring	c
and	c
the	c
worst	c
in	c
my	c
life	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
and	c
I	c
insist	c
that	c
you	c
refund	c
my	c
lost	i
money	c
at	c
once	c
.	c

Come	i
back	i
to	c
paradise	c

There	c
is	c
no	c
doubt	c
that	c
fashion	c
affects	c
people	c
and	c
makes	c
them	c
obsessed	c
with	c
this	c
subject	c
,	c
but	c
what	c
can	i
be	i
designed	i
more	i
?	c

The	i
clothes	i
is	i
part	c
of	c
each	c
culture	c
and	c
one	c
of	c
these	i
things	c
which	c
expresses	i
our	c
taste	c
and	c
personality	c
.	c

Nowadays	c
it	i
's	c
getting	c
obvious	c
that	c
designers	c
sold	i
only	c
details	i
,	c
but	i
significant	c
changes	c
do	c
n't	c
turn	c
up	c
.	c

Styles	c
mix	c
,	c
colours	c
and	c
shapes	c
come	c
back	c
from	c
the	c
past	c
,	c
only	i
the	c
fabrics	c
are	c
different	c
.	c

People	c
look	c
for	c
something	c
new	c
but	c
it	c
is	c
not	c
so	c
easy	c
to	c
be	c
creative	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
.	c

As	c
it	i
was	c
previously	c
stated	c
I	i
am	c
convinced	c
that	c
the	c
reality	c
will	c
turn	c
out	c
to	c
be	c
a	c
paradise	c
where	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
will	i
be	c
body	i
and	c
purity	i
of	c
our	c
soul	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
in	c
connection	c
with	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
I	c
saw	c
in	c
your	c
theatre	c
a	c
week	c
ago	c
.	c

As	c
if	c
this	c
were	c
not	c
enough	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
forty	i
five	i
minutes	c
late	c
.	c

Your	c
leaflet	c
was	c
rather	c
misleading	c
on	c
this	c
subject	c
.	c

According	c
to	c
your	c
leaflet	c
,	c
tickets	c
were	c
supposed	c
to	c
be	c
a	c
bit	c
cheaper	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
was	c
refused	c
being	i
given	i
a	c
discount	c
.	c

On	c
top	c
of	c
everything	c
,	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

You	c
can	c
imagine	c
how	c
disappointed	c
I	c
must	i
be	i
to	c
spent	i
such	c
an	c
imperfect	c
evening	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
receiving	c
your	c
prompt	c
reply	c
.	c

Recently	c
,	c
we	c
have	i
had	i
a	c
very	c
interesting	c
discussion	c
about	c
how	c
science	c
and	c
technology	c
affects	c
our	c
lives	c
.	c

Nowadays	c
,	c
modern	c
technology	c
is	c
used	c
in	c
medicine	c
more	c
often	c
and	c
it	c
can	c
minimise	c
the	c
risk	c
of	c
the	c
death	c
of	c
the	c
patients	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
see	c
some	c
disadvantages	c
of	c
technological	c
progress	c
.	c

That	c
's	c
why	c
we	c
should	c
abandon	i
cars	c
from	c
city	c
centres	c
,	c
closed	i
down	c
factories	c
which	c
produce	c
too	c
much	c
sewage	i
.	c

Although	c
modern	c
progress	c
has	c
made	c
our	c
life	c
easier	c
,	c
it	c
may	c
be	i
also	i
harmful	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
giving	c
me	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
very	c
important	c
for	c
me	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
always	i
wanted	c
to	c
travel	c
to	c
the	c
U.S.A	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
travel	c
only	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
the	c
only	c
month	c
when	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
school	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
a	c
very	c
good	c
basketball	c
player	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
playing	c
basketball	c
since	c
I	c
was	c
six	c
years	c
old	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
last	c
letter	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
very	c
interesting	c
and	c
I	c
enjoyed	c
reading	c
it	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
know	c
,	c
I	c
enjoyed	c
helping	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
last	c
month	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
sell	c
tickets	c
for	c
the	c
concert	c
in	c
the	c
street	c
.	c

As	c
I	c
sold	c
all	c
the	c
tickets	c
that	c
the	c
organisers	c
gave	c
me	c
,	c
I	c
won	c
a	c
prize	c
of	c
ten	c
pounds	c
.	c

Do	c
n't	c
ask	c
me	c
how	c
the	c
concert	c
was	c
!	c

When	c
the	c
concert	c
was	c
finished	c
,	c
some	c
friends	c
and	c
I	c
went	c
for	c
a	c
drink	c
.	c

Looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

My	c
name	c
is	c
.	c

.	c
.	c

and	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
student	c
representative	c
.	c

I	c
read	c
it	c
and	c
found	c
it	c
very	c
good	c
,	c
specially	i
,	i
Science	i
Museum	c
and	c
National	c
Art	c
Gallery	c
as	c
I	c
am	c
interested	c
in	c
arts	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
a	c
great	c
proposition	c
for	c
you	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
will	c
consider	c
this	c
proposition	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
form	i
you	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

We	c
like	c
our	c
houses	c
that	i
is	c
why	c
are	i
always	c
trying	c
to	c
make	c
it	i
more	c
comfortable	c
and	c
useful	i
.	c

Many	c
people	c
think	c
that	c
we	c
will	c
resign	i
from	i
a	c
kitchen	c
which	i
is	c
a	c
useless	c
place	c
,	c
as	c
we	c
will	c
spend	c
most	c
of	c
the	c
time	c
at	c
work	c
and	c
will	c
eat	c
outside	c
.	c

Because	c
of	c
computers	c
we	i
will	c
have	c
the	c
possibility	c
of	c
working	c
at	c
home	c
,	c
therefore	c
,	c
home	c
will	c
be	c
very	i
important	c
place	c
worth	c
paying	c
attention	c
.	i

Take	c
care	c
of	c
your	c
home	c
,	c
do	c
not	c
hesitate	c
in	i
it	c
and	c
you	c
will	c
be	c
very	c
happy	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
tents	i
because	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
stay	i
in	c
tents	i
before	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
wondering	c
how	i
it	c
is	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
like	c
And	i
among	i
these	c
activities	c
I	c
am	i
choosing	i
basketball	c
and	c
swimming	c
.	c

And	c
finally	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
some	c
questions	c
.	c

Your	i
sincerely	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
,	c

Secondly	c
,	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
it	c
was	i
written	i
that	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
to	c
start	c
at	c
19:30	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
,	c
almost	c
an	c
hour	c
late	c
.	c

Thirdly	c
,	c
it	c
was	i
written	i
that	c
discounts	c
were	c
available	c
but	c
we	c
were	c
again	c
frustrated	c
,	c
seing	i
they	c
were	c
not	c
available	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
although	c
we	c
were	c
informed	c
that	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
would	c
be	c
open	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
the	c
show	c
had	c
started	c
late	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
can	c
see	c
,	c
most	c
of	c
the	c
offered	i
activities	i
in	c
the	c
advertisements	c
were	c
not	c
provided	c
.	c

We	c
did	c
not	c
have	c
"	c
a	c
perfect	c
evening	c
"	c
as	c
it	c
was	i
written	i
,	c
actually	c
we	c
had	c
an	c
evening	c
full	c
of	c
the	c
theatre	c
's	c
mistakes	c
and	c
were	c
extremely	c
disappointed	c
.	c

Yours	c
Sincerely	i
,	c

MY	c
LIFE	c
AND	c
MODERN	c
TECHNOLOGY	c

Here	c
we	c
are	c
,	c
in	c
the	c
21st	c
century	c
...	c

When	c
I	c
come	c
home	c
,	c
I	c
cook	c
my	c
meal	c
in	c
the	c
microwave	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
friends	c
in	i
the	c
internet	i
and	c
can	c
learn	c
anything	c
while	c
surfing	c
in	i
it	c
.	c

I	c
sometimes	c
get	c
bored	c
or	c
feel	c
isolated	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
know	c
I	c
am	c
living	c
in	c
a	c
virtual	c
world	c
.	c

Modern	c
technology	c
has	c
changed	c
my	c
life	c
completely	c
.	c

Dear	c
Ms.	c
Jane	c
Clark	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
give	c
my	c
opinion	c
about	c
the	c
International	c
Arts	c
Festival	c
which	c
was	c
held	c
21st	i
and	c
22nd	c
November	c
.	c

I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
rock	c
concert	c
by	c
U2	c
and	c
the	i
Chinese	c
film	c
"	c
Chung	c
King	c
Express	c
"	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
greater	i
if	c
there	c
were	c
more	c
famous	c
people	c
who	i
have	i
various	c
nationalities	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
be	c
glad	c
if	c
you	c
consider	i
my	c
suggestions	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
some	c
good	c
ways	c
for	c
you	c
to	c
earn	c
enough	c
money	c
to	c
enjoy	c
yourself	c
.	c

Not	c
only	c
it	i
's	i
a	c
simple	c
job	c
,	c
but	c
also	c
you	c
can	c
enjoy	c
working	c
with	c
many	i
colleague	i
at	i
your	c
age	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
say	c
that	c
the	c
wage	c
is	c
far	c
from	c
satisfaction	i
,	c
why	c
do	c
n't	c
you	c
teach	c
younger	c
students	c
as	c
a	c
private	c
teacher	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
also	c
really	i
popular	c
job	c
among	c
university	c
students	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
good	c
salaly	i
.	c

You	c
'll	c
find	c
that	c
your	c
life	c
is	c
becoming	c
more	c
and	c
more	c
enjoyable	c
!	c

Dir	i
Madam	c

I	c
look	c
forword	i
to	c
going	c
to	c
the	c
Camp	c
California	c
in	c
the	c
USA	c
.	c

I	c
prefer	c
staying	c
in	c
tens	i
to	c
staying	c
in	c
log	c
cabins	c
.	c

Because	c
it	c
remainds	i
me	c
my	i
childhood	c
.	c

I	c
used	c
to	c
going	i
with	c
my	c
friends	c
to	c
the	i
camp	c
,	c
wich	i
was	c
situeded	i
on	i
a	i
seaside	c
.	c

We	c
had	i
always	c
enjoying	i
ourselves	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
keen	c
on	c
sailing	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
my	c
favourite	c
sport	c
.	c

I	c
find	c
it	c
very	c
atractive	i
.	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
taken	c
part	c
in	c
any	c
competitions	c
connected	c
with	c
this	c
sport	c
.	c

For	c
me	c
it	c
is	c
only	c
a	c
hobby	c
.	c

Last	c
year	c
I	c
took	c
up	c
climbing	c
and	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
carry	c
on	c
learning	c
this	c
sport	c
.	c

and	c
I	c
wonder	c
if	c
prizes	i
are	c
high	c
there	c
.	c

I	c
used	c
to	c
like	c
shopping	c
,	c
but	c
recently	c
I	c
came	c
across	c
many	c
disadvantage	i
of	c
this	c
activity	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
n't	c
true	c
.	c

We	c
like	c
them	c
because	c
everything	c
is	c
on	i
one	c
place	c
.	c

The	c
most	c
suitable	c
time	c
for	c
shopping	c
is	c
weekand	i
when	c
parents	c
do	c
n't	c
work	c
and	c
children	c
have	c
n't	c
got	c
a	i
school	c
.	c

However	c
such	c
centers	i
are	c
very	c
useful	c
and	c
necessary	c
.	c

Afterwards	c
you	c
are	c
all	c
in	c
.	c

On	c
balance	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
shopping	c
should	c
be	c
a	c
nice	c
thing	c
so	c
if	c
you	c
have	i
bad	i
mood	c
do	c
n't	c
go	c
shopping	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr.	c
Robertson	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
in	i
the	i
name	i
of	i
the	c
class	c
for	c
your	c
good	i
organisation	i
and	c
programme	c
,	c
Especially	i
for	c
the	c
fact	c
that	c
you	c
are	c
giving	c
us	c
some	c
free	c
time	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
we	c
have	c
seen	c
an	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
.	c

As	c
well	c
as	c
this	c
,	c
the	i
entrance	c
for	c
students	c
is	c
free	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
can	c
see	c
this	c
is	c
the	c
best	c
time	c
to	c
go	c
there	c
.	c

Instead	c
of	c
visiting	c
the	c
Science	c
Museum	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
we	c
could	c
go	c
there	c
on	c
Wednesday	c
afternoon	c
and	c
instead	c
of	c
going	c
shopping	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
afternoon	c
we	c
could	c
maybe	c
stop	c
at	c
some	c
places	c
during	c
the	c
sightseeing	c
tour	c
and	c
buy	c
there	i
something	i
.	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
this	c
is	c
a	c
really	c
great	c
opportunity	c
for	c
us	c
and	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
think	c
that	c
the	c
changes	c
are	c
so	c
big	c
.	c

The	i
man	i
is	c
a	c
being	c
that	c
need	i
to	c
live	c
close	c
to	c
other	c
human	c
beings	c
and	c
to	c
create	c
a	c
society	c
around	c
him	i
.	c

As	c
well	c
as	c
this	c
he	c
needs	c
his	c
own	c
free	c
space	c
and	c
privacy	c
.	c

In	c
our	c
society	c
some	c
people	c
are	c
treated	c
like	c
animals	c
in	c
the	c
zoo	c
by	c
the	c
press	c
.	c

The	c
newspapers	c
print	c
everything	c
about	c
them	c
.	c

The	c
photographers	c
are	c
chasing	c
these	c
people	c
,	i
just	c
to	c
take	c
a	c
picture	c
of	c
them	c
on	i
how	c
they	c
eat	c
or	c
with	c
who	i
the	i
meat	i
.	c

The	c
photos	c
will	c
be	c
on	i
tomorrow	c
's	c
press	c
and	c
so	c
rumours	c
are	c
born	c
.	c

The	c
fans	c
and	c
the	c
press	c
are	c
those	c
who	c
have	c
made	c
them	c
rich	c
and	c
famous	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
"	c
,	c
wich	i
I	c
visited	i
on	c
Friday	c
the	c
16th	c
of	c
June	c
in	c
your	c
theatre	c
.	c

There	c
are	c
several	c
points	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
complain	c
wich	i
made	i
the	c
evening	c
not	i
nice	c
at	c
all	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
n't	c
go	c
to	c
have	i
a	i
refreshment	c
because	i
of	i
two	c
reasons	c
,	c
the	c
first	c
one	c
is	c
that	c
there	c
was	c
no	c
information	c
how	i
much	i
time	i
the	c
start	c
of	c
the	c
show	c
is	i
going	c
to	c
be	c
late	c
.	i

The	c
second	c
reason	c
is	c
that	c
the	c
restaurant	i
of	i
the	i
theatre	i
was	c
closed	c
because	i
of	i
building	i
plans	i
for	i
the	i
next	i
two	i
month	i
.	c

On	c
your	c
ticket	i
information	c
is	c
written	c
out	i
that	c
discounts	c
are	c
available	c
,	c
when	c
I	c
ask	i
at	c
the	c
ticket	c
reception	i
I	c
could	c
n't	c
get	c
any	c
discount	c
for	c
beeng	i
student	i
.	c

To	c
make	i
an	i
result	i
the	c
evening	c
in	c
your	c
theatre	c
and	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
very	c
disappointing	c
and	c
not	c
like	c
promised	i
.	c

reasently	i

Miss.	c
Winkler	c

What	c
is	c
the	c
prize	c
?	c

He	c
did	c
n't	c
want	c
to	c
say	c
what	c
Sarah	c
just	i
had	i
told	c
him	c
,	c
it	c
just	c
came	c
over	i
his	i
mouth	c
,	c
when	c
he	c
talked	c
to	c
James	c
.	c

"	c
Sarah	c
has	c
won	c
in	c
a	c
quiz	c
show	c
?	c
"	c

Everybody	c
was	c
interested	c
in	c
what	c
she	c
had	c
won	c
but	c
knowbody	i
wanted	c
to	c
ask	c
Sarah	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
told	c
in	i
a	c
secret	c
to	c
them	c
.	c

Sarah	c
realized	c
that	c
everybody	c
was	c
nice	c
and	c
friendly	c
to	c
her	c
but	c
something	c
was	c
going	c
on	c
in	c
the	c
class	c
,	c
when	c
she	c
turned	c
around	c
a	i
talking	c
and	c
wispering	i
started	c
.	c

Pat	c
told	c
her	c
everything	c
.	c

Sarah	c
looked	c
at	c
him	c
for	c
a	c
while	c
,	c
than	i
she	c
stood	c
in	c
front	c
of	c
the	c
class	c
and	c
explaind	i
to	c
the	c
others	c
,	i
that	c
she	c
won	i
a	c
prize	c
for	c
20	c
people	c
to	c
travel	c
for	c
1	c
week	c
to	c
the	c
sea	i
of	c
southern	c
France	c
and	c
everybody	i
of	c
the	c
19	c
pupils	c
was	c
invited	c
,	c
except	c
Pat	c
who	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c

Dear	c
Mrs.	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
take	c
part	c
in	c
a	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
get	c
to	c
know	c
how	c
to	c
handle	c
a	c
camera	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
I	c
do	c
not	c
have	c
an	i
own	c
camera	c

Could	c
you	c
please	c
tell	c

I	c
will	c
need	c
some	c
extra	c
money	c

I	c
want	c
to	c

if	c
I	c

I	c
am	c

Yours	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

It	c
was	c
nice	c
to	c
hear	c
from	c
you	c
recently	c
.	c

Then	c
a	c
young	c
man	c
told	c
me	c
what	c
to	c
do	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
really	c
hard	c
work	c
.	c

At	c
this	c
time	i
I	c
promised	c
that	i
I	c
would	c
never	c
do	c
this	c
awful	c
job	c
again	c
.	c

Then	c
at	c
five	c
o'clock	c
my	c
favourite	c
band	c
"	c
Tristania	c
"	c
arrived	c
.	c

I	c
talked	c
to	c
them	c
and	c
to	c
many	c
other	c
groups	c
that	c
arrived	c
later	c
.	c

Give	c
my	c
regards	c
to	c
your	c
family	c
.	c

Most	c
of	c
the	c
events	c
were	c
wonderful	c
and	c
well-organised	i
.	c

In	c
addition	c
to	c
it	i
,	c
one	c
weekend	c
ticket	c
for	c
all	c
events	i
was	c
only	c
£	c
10	c
,	i
this	i
was	c
excellent	c
,	i
it	i
made	i
people	c
only	c
spend	i
pocket-money	i
,	c
and	c
then	c
they	c
could	c
watch	c
all	c
the	c
events	c
at	c
the	c
weeked	i
,	i
for	i
them	c
it	c
is	c
really	i
economical	c
to	i
spent	i
their	c
weekend	c
.	c

This	i
are	c
only	c
my	c
inmature	i
views	c
,	i
if	i
it	i
is	i
considerable	i
for	i
you	i
,	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
very	c
pleased	c
,	i
thank	i
you	c
very	c
much	c
.	c

yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

At	c
my	c
school	c
,	c
we	c
are	c
n't	c
allowed	c
to	c
smoke	c
inside	c
the	c
building	c

because	c
the	c
building	c
is	c
made	c
of	c
wood	c
,	i
it	i
tend	i
to	c
catch	c
fire	c
easily	c

and	c
we	c
are	c

there	i
are	c
only	c
ten	c
computers	c
in	c
the	c
school	c
,	i
only	i
teachers	c
can	c
use	c
it	i
,	i
if	i
we	c
used	c
,	i
we	c
would	c
be	c
sent	c
to	c
the	c

of	c
the	c
school	c
.	c

Lots	c
of	c
love	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
make	c
a	c
complain	i
about	c
your	c
theatre	c
and	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
,,Over	i
the	c
rainbow	i
"	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
very	c
uncamfortable	i
for	c
me	c
.	c

You	c
promised	c
me	c
perfect	i
evening	c
out	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
most	c
terrible	c
in	c
my	c
life	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

Her	c
boss	c
was	c
rich	i
man	c
,	c
really	c
rich	c
.	c

His	c
name	c
was	c
Timson	c
White	c
.	c

He	c
was	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
most	c
famous	c
person	i
in	c
his	i
city	c
,	c
but	c
he	c
was	c
n't	c
honest	c
with	c
his	c
clients	c
.	c

Pat	c
had	c
worked	c
for	c
him	c
for	c
two	c
years	c
.	c

One	c
of	c
them	c
was	c
about	c
her	c
boss	i
'	i
private	c
life	c
:	c
he	c
had	c
got	i
illegal	i
son	c
.	c

Timson	c
's	c
wife	c
,	c
who	c
was	c
good	i
looking	i
and	c
young	c
,	c
could	c
n't	c
know	c
about	c
this	c
,	c
but	c
one	c
beautiful	c
day	c
she	c
asked	c
him	c
how	c
his	c
son	c
was	c
and	c
where	c
he	c
was	c
at	c
that	c
moment	c
.	c

Timson	c
was	c
really	c
shocked	c
!	c

He	c
even	i
could	i
n't	i
say	c
a	c
word	c
.	c

Of	c
course	c
,	c
only	c
one	c
person	c
had	i
known	i
this	c
except	i
his	c
best	c
friends	c
.	c

Only	c
Pat	c
has	c
problems	c
,	c
she	c
should	i
earn	i
her	i
living	i
in	i
other	i
company	i
again	i
!	c

I	c
am	c
so	c
please	i
that	c
I	c
won	c
this	c
prize	c
,	i
that	c
I	c
can	i
not	i
explain	c
how	c
greateful	i
I	c
am	c
.	c

I	c
wase	i
n't	i
expecting	c
this	c
prize	c
because	c
was	i
to	i
good	c
to	c
be	c
true	c
.	c

Because	c
this	i
situation	c
I	c
be	i
very	c
busy	c
on	i
the	c
first	c
week	c
of	c
july	i
,	c
and	c
I	c
apreciate	i
if	i
you	c
can	i
give	c
me	c
the	c
choice	i
to	c
start	i
my	c
"	c
Camp	c
California	c
"	c
from	i
July	c
10th	c
.	c

About	c
the	c
Accomodation	i
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
sleep	c
on	i
the	i
tents	i
,	c
because	c
I	c
never	i
been	i
in	c
one	c
,	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
lot	c
more	c
fun	c
than	c
log	c
cabins	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
ameaising	i
how	c
people	c
change	c
during	i
the	i
years	i
,	i
for	i
example	i
now	c
shopping	c
for	c
me	c
is	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
most	c
entertaining	c
things	c
,	c
and	c
every	c
week	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
buy	c
something	c
.	c

But	c
in	i
this	i
days	i
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
,	c
because	c
if	c
you	c
decide	c
to	c
buy	c
a	c
very	c
expensive	c
designer	c
and	i
you	c
pay	c
full	i
price	c
,	c
on	i
the	c
end	c
of	c
the	c
season	c
it	c
is	c
half	c
price	c
,	i
I	c
find	c
very	i
anfair	i
for	c
people	c
who	c
pay	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
money	c
on	i
their	c
clothes	c
.	c

Anyway	c
,	c
shopping	c
is	c
allways	i
a	i
satisfation	i
for	c
rich	c
people	c
,	c
because	c
they	c
can	c
afforded	i
and	i
they	c
do	c
n't	c
main	i
to	i
spend	i
full	i
price	c
on	i
their	c
clothes	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
enthusiatic	i
about	c
receiving	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

I	c
will	c
give	c
you	c
all	c
the	c
necessary	c
information	c
.	c

Moreover	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
are	c
the	c
best	c
for	c
living	c
in	c
the	c
camp	c
and	c
if	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
bring	c
with	c
me	c
a	c
large	c
amount	c
of	c
money	c
.	c

I	c
want	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
this	c
prize	c
,	i
let	i
me	c
know	c
if	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

I	c
've	c
always	c
loved	c
music	c
so	c
working	c
in	i
a	c
concert	c
was	c
great	c
.	c

You	c
ca	c
n't	c
imagine	c
how	c
many	c
people	c
are	c
involved	c
in	c
the	c
organization	c
of	c
a	c
concert	c
,	i
apart	i
from	c
the	c
musicists	i
and	c
the	c
singers	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
people	c
who	c
work	c
with	c
lights	c
,	c
who	c
organize	c
the	c
security	i
service	i
...	c
it	c
was	c
so	c
exciting	c
!	c

Sometimes	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
people	c
never	c
grow	c
up	c
,	i
if	i
they	c
had	c
been	c
a	c
class	c
of	c
children	c
,	c
they	c
would	c
have	c
made	c
less	c
noise	c
!	c
!	c

Bianca	c

I	c
write	c
you	i
because	c
last	c
friday	i
I	c
had	c
a	c
very	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
in	i
your	c
theatre	c
.	c

Last	c
week	c
I	c
was	c
in	c
London	c
with	c
my	c
friends	c
and	c
we	c
decided	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
to	c
see	c
how	i
the	c
famous	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
act	c
.	c

But	c
when	c
we	c
arrived	c
at	c
2.00	c
pm	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
show	i
of	i
2.30	i
p.m.	i
,	c
we	c
could	c
n't	c
enter	c
in	i
the	c
theatre	c
because	c
the	c
discounts	c
were	c
n't	c
available	c
.	c

I	c
ask	c
you	c
if	c
is	i
it	i
possible	c
to	c
have	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
,	c
please	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
forgot	i
that	c
expense	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
.	c

Modern	c
technology	c
ca	c
n't	c
not	c
transforme	i
our	c
daily	c
life	c
.	c

The	c
inventions	c
of	c
the	c
airplane	i
,	c
of	c
the	c
train	c
and	c
of	c
the	c
car	c
,	c
have	c
reduced	c
the	c
distances	c
of	c
the	c
world	c
,	c
so	c
we	c
can	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
other	c
side	c
of	c
the	c
world	c
in	c
half	c
a	c
day	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
have	c
must	i
more	c
interestings	i
things	c
to	c
do	c
in	c
my	c
life	c
.	c

But	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
innovation	c
of	i
technology	i
development	c
is	c
the	c
computer	c
.	c

Sadly	c
,	c
there	c
is	c
also	c
a	c
negative	c
aspect	c
.	c

Dear	c
Manager	c
,	c

There	c
is	c
some	c
disagreement	c
a	i
between	c
your	c
advertisement	c
and	c
show	i
,	i
which	c
I	c
could	i
see	i
at	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
.	c

The	c
Musical	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
not	c
at	c
14:30	c
-	c
as	c
you	c
have	i
mentioned	i
.	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
there	c
was	c
no	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
at	i
the	c
stage	c
.	c

She	i
is	c
my	c
famous	i
artist	c
and	c
I	c
was	i
coming	i
there	c
mainly	c
because	c
of	c
him	c
.	c

Another	c
point	c
,	i
I	c
want	c
you	c
to	c
consider	c
,	i
is	c
restaurant	i
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
say	c
that	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
disappointed	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
for	c
giving	i
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Yours	c

THE	c

It	c

a	c

it	c
is	c
n't	c
even	c
a	c
picture	c
from	c
mysterious	c

.	c

Fashion	c
.	c

I	c
say	i
it	i
to	i
you	c
-	c
black	c
and	c
grey	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
,	i
there	c
will	c
be	c
times	c
,	i
when	c
women	c
would	i
like	c
to	i
be	i
again	i
thought	c
as	i
delicate	c
and	c
sensible	i
human	c
beings	c
.	c

Showing	c
their	c
figure	c
,	c
they	c
would	c
have	c
possibility	i
to	c
show	c
their	c
sexuality	c

And	c
it	i
will	c
be	c
the	i
past	c

of	c
21st	i

will	c
be	c

So	c
,	c
are	c
you	c

in	c
that	c

These	c
are	c
the	c

FUTURE	c

Dear	c
Manager	c
,	c

Recently	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
week	c
's	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
and	c
during	c
my	c
stay	c
,	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
your	c
theatre	c
to	c
see	c
"	c
Over	c
The	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
really	c
disillusioned	i
.	c

I	c
could	c
not	c
see	c
any	c
portion	c
of	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
's	c
performance	c
at	i
him	c
.	c

Since	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
student	c
and	c
not	c
as	c
rich	c
as	c
Bill	c
gates	i
,	c
I	c
was	c
short	c
of	c
money	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
pleased	c
to	c
hear	c
that	c
there	c
were	c
discounts	c
available	c
for	c
the	c
tickets	c
;	c
but	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
give	c
the	c
exact	i
price	c
of	c
the	c
ticket	c
,	c
which	c
I	c
consider	c
as	i
a	i
fault	c
of	c
your	c
theatre	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
to	c
these	i
,	c
it	c
was	c
mentioned	c
that	c
your	c
restaurant	c
was	c
open	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
because	c
there	c
was	c
no	c
food	c
to	c
be	c
served	c
.	c

Yours	c
Sincerely	i
,	c

Until	c
1996	c
,	c
I	c
used	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
school	c
on	c
foot	c
or	c
by	c
public	c
bus	c
;	c
but	c
since	c
1996	c
;	c
I	c
take	c
the	c
underground	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
school	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
not	c
have	c
to	c
wait	c
for	c
a	c
letter	c
for	c
days	c
and	c
I	c
gain	c
so	c
much	c
time	c
again	i
.	c

But	c
despite	c
this	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
happy	c
with	c
the	c
facilities	i
of	i
technology	i
in	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
.	c

This	c
change	c
will	c
give	c
opportunity	i
to	c
create	i
some	i
different	i
performance	i
.	c

I	c
suppose	i
that	c
some	c
concert	c
halls	c
are	c
too	c
small	c
,	c
so	c
you	c
should	c
be	c
sure	c
about	c
it	i
in	i
advance	c
.	c

From	c
my	c
point	c
of	c
view	c
,	c
there	c
should	c
be	c
more	c
films	c
because	c
this	c
part	c
of	c
the	c
festival	c
is	c
interesting	c
for	c
people	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
will	c
consider	c
my	c
proposals	c
.	c

Thanks	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
and	c
postcard	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
really	c
nice	c
.	i

At	i
first	i
,	c
about	c
school	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
awfull	i
!	c

And	c
the	c
problem	c
is	c
that	c
nobody	c
wants	c
to	c
wear	c
it	c
.	c

That	c
's	c
why	c
our	c
headmaster	c
is	c
really	c
angry	c
.	c

What	c
should	c
I	c
say	c
you	i
about	c
home	c
...	c

I	c
miss	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
.	c

Write	c
me	i
what	i
do	i
you	c
think	c
about	c
it	c
.	c

A	c
different	c
actor	c
has	i
appeared	i
,	c
but	i
I	c
must	c
say	c
that	c
he	c
was	c
very	c
disappointing	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
you	c
have	c
written	c
that	c
the	c
musical	c
starts	c
at	c
19:30	c
.	c

You	c
have	i
also	i
placed	i
a	c
note	c
about	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
opened	i
after	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

I	c
wanted	c
to	c
drink	i
a	c
coffee	c
but	c
,	i
unfortunately	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
,	c
because	c
the	c
waiter	c
went	i
out	c
!	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
I	c
must	c
say	c
that	c
this	c
evening	c
out	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
be	c
perfect	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
not	c
of	i
course	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
kindly	i
for	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
,	c
because	c
some	c
information	c
placed	c
in	c
your	c
advertisement	c
about	c
the	c
musical	c
was	c
not	c
true	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
modern	c
technology	c
has	c
changed	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
very	c
much	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
:	c
a	c
fridge	c
,	c
a	c
cooker	c
or	c
just	c
an	i
electricity	c
.	c

We	c
could	c
n't	c
imagine	c
our	c
life	c
without	c
them	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
thanked	i
to	c
the	i
technology	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
many	c
ways	c
of	c
travelling	c
today	c
.	c

We	c
produce	c
cars	c
,	c
trains	c
and	c
plains	i
which	c
are	c
better	c
and	c
better	c
.	c

What	c
is	c
more	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
many	c
new	c
ways	c
to	c
produce	c
medicines	c
and	c
modern	c
hospital	c
equipement	i
.	c

It	c
can	c
really	c
help	c
a	c
lot	c
to	c
cure	c
people	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
the	i
modern	c
technology	c
has	c
some	c
disadvantages	c
.	c

The	c
main	c
is	i
the	c
ozone	c
hole	c
that	c
affects	c
all	c
the	c
people	c
in	c
the	c
world	c
.	c

The	c
second	c
is	c
the	i
nuclear	c
weapon	i
and	c
many	i
wars	c
,	i
in	c
which	c
modern	c
equipement	i
is	c
used	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

For	c
the	c
accommodation	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
because	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
probably	c
more	c
comfortable	c
.	c

You	c
also	c
asked	c
me	c
about	c
two	c
activities	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
would	c
take	c
the	c
opportunity	c
to	c
improve	c
myself	i
.	c

In	c
addition	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
some	c
questions	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
which	i
sort	c
of	c
clothes	c
we	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
with	c
us	c
and	c
also	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
is	c
necessary	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
in	c
the	c
near	c
future	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c

You	c
always	c
find	c
more	c
shops	c
and	c
they	c
are	c
open	c
even	c
more	i
late	i
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
if	c
you	c
try	c
to	c
do	c
your	c
shopping	c
during	c
the	c
rush	c
hour	c
,	c
it	c
could	c
be	c
very	c
difficult	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
not	c
comfortable	i
at	c
all	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
,	c
everything	c
is	c
now	c
so	c
expensive	c
that	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
compare	c
the	c
prices	c
.	c

You	c
have	c
to	c
find	c
which	c
shop	c
offers	c
you	c
good	c
quality	c
products	c
for	c
a	c
good	c
price	c
.	c

Most	c
of	c
the	c
time	c
the	c
shop	c
assistant	c
does	c
n't	c
believe	c
you	c
.	c

Dear	c
Manager	c
,	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
the	c
tickets	c
were	c
too	c
expensive	c
.	c

The	c
day	c
of	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
we	c
got	c
to	c
the	c
theather	i
at	c
19:30	c
.	c

Third	c
,	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
the	c
cheff	i
did	c
not	c
show	c
up	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

Pat	c
knew	c
something	c
was	c
wrong	c
because	c
she	c
had	c
known	c
Sally	c
since	c
they	c
were	c
five	c
years	c
old	c
,	c
but	c
she	c
did	c
not	c
why	i
she	c
was	c
acting	c
so	c
strange	i
.	c

Sally	c
did	c
not	c
want	c
to	c
tell	c
anybody	c
about	c
her	c
problem	c
,	c
but	c
she	c
knew	c
she	c
could	c
trust	c
Pat	c
.	c

So	c
Sally	c
started	c
to	c
talk	c
.	c

She	c
had	c
seen	c
her	c
stepfather	c
hitting	c
her	c
mother	c
everytime	i
he	c
was	c
drunk	c
.	c

Sally	c
was	c
so	c
scared	c
,	c
and	c
at	c
the	c
same	c
time	c
mad	c
at	c
Pat	c
because	c
she	c
knew	c
the	c
only	c
person	c
who	c
could	c
have	c
told	c
the	c
police	c
was	c
her	c
best	c
friend	c
.	c

Dear	c
Ms	c
Ryan	c

I	c
have	c
never	c
been	c
in	i
California	c
yet	i
.	c

Now	c
I	c
will	c
give	c
you	c
the	i
further	c
information	c
:	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
I	c
had	i
to	c
make	c
sure	c
that	c
I	c
can	c
have	c
holiday	i
this	c
year	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
the	i
only	c
possebility	i
!	c

I	c
am	c
not	i
well	i
in	i
both	i
activities	i
,	c
but	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
a	c
pleasure	c
to	c
try	c
it	i
espacially	i
surfing	c
,	i
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
feel	c
the	c
air	i
in	c
my	c
hair	c
,	c
and	c
enjoy	c
how	c
quick	i
the	c
board	c
goes	c
over	c
the	c
sea	c
.	c

Another	i
question	i
I	i
have	i
;	c
the	c
live	i
there	c
,	c
is	c
it	c
as	c
expensive	c
as	c
I	c
think	c
?	c

In	i
the	i
other	i
hand	i
it	c
is	c
not	c
as	c
important	c
,	c
the	c
main	c
reason	c
is	c
I	c
really	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
go	i
at	i
this	c
Camp	i
and	c
one	i
more	c
time	c
,	c
thanks	c
a	c
lot	c
!	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

We	c
have	c
recently	c
had	c
a	c
discussion	c
in	c
our	c
class	c
about	c
this	c
statement	c
,	i
we	i
have	c
had	c
a	c
great	c
argueing	i
.	c

Certainly	c
it	c
is	c
great	c
to	c
buy	c
new	c
clothes	c
and	c
have	c
a	c
great	c
variety	c
at	c
home	c
,	i
to	c
wear	c
,	c
but	c
mostly	c
you	c
will	c
have	i
allways	i
not	i
enough	i
.	c

When	c
I	c
decided	i
to	c
go	c
for	i
a	i
shopping	c
,	c
first	c
I	c
will	c
make	c
sure	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
enough	c
time	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
not	c
a	c
typical	c
women	i
because	c
I	c
hate	c
shopping	c
!	c

I	c
am	c
lucky	c
if	c
I	c
will	i
find	i
something	c
which	c
fits	c
.	c

The	c
main	c
reason	c
I	c
hate	c
,	i
there	c
are	c
too	c
many	c
people	c
who	c
are	c
always	c
standing	c
in	c
my	c
way	c
(	c
or	c
maybe	c
I	c
think	i
in	i
that	i
way	i
)	c
and	c
I	c
begin	c
to	c
be	i
angry	c
,	i
normally	i
I	i
am	i
looking	i
those	i
people	i
with	i
evil	i
eyes	i
!	c

I	c
mean	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
too	c
crowdy	i
,	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
wait	c
such	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
before	c
you	c
can	c
pay	c
,	c
and	c
mostly	i
all	i
the	c
things	c
are	c
too	c
expensive	c
!	c

Lastly	c
,	c
you	c
can	c
see	c
,	c
my	c
opinion	c
about	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
very	c
good	c
,	c
then	i
I	c
think	c
shopping	c
is	c
never	c
enjoyable	c
!	c

I	c
've	c
recived	i
your	c
letter	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
pleased	c
to	c
have	c
won	c
because	c
I	c
needed	c
some	c
days	c
to	c
relax	c
myself	i
and	c
to	c
leave	c
the	c
city	c
,	c
which	c
is	c
very	c
extressing	i
.	c

To	i
spend	i
the	i
two	i
weeks	i
I	i
would	i
prefer	i
to	i
live	i
in	c
tents	i
,	c
that	c
's	c
in	i
my	c
opinion	c
a	i
way	c
to	c
be	c
nearer	c
the	c
enviroment	i
and	c
the	c
animals	c
,	c
although	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
mind	c
living	i
in	c
log	c
cabins	c
.	c

In	c
spite	c
of	c
liking	c
all	c
the	c
sports	c
you	c
wrote	c
in	i
your	c
letter	c
I	i
am	c
only	c
good	c
at	c
climbing	c
and	c
sailing	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
am	i
used	i
to	i
practise	i
them	c
with	c
my	c
father	c
since	i
I	c
was	c
a	c
child	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
the	c
prize	c
.	c

Eliza	c
Vasquez	c
.	c

In	c
that	c
way	c
shopping	c
can	c
be	c
as	c
funny	i
as	c
you	c
want	c
,	c
although	c
if	c
you	c
do	c
it	c
very	c
often	c
,	c
it	c
will	c
be	i
as	i
an	i
obligation	i
in	i
the	i
future	i
.	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
all	i
you	c
make	i
in	c
small	c
cuantities	i
is	c
good	c
and	c
funny	i
,	c
but	c
do	c
n't	c
encrease	i
them	i
if	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
want	c
to	c
feel	c
uncomfortable	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c

Yours	c
faithfuly	i
,	c

Modern	c
technology	c
is	c
affecting	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
a	c
lot	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
even	c
say	c
changed	i
it	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
write	c
letters	c
to	c
my	c
friends	c
anymore	c
,	c
and	c
wait	c
weeks	c
before	c
receiving	c
answers	c
,	c
I	c
just	c
send	c
an	c
electronic	c
mail	c
through	i
the	c
internet	i
and	c
the	c
person	c
received	i
it	c
within	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
need	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
stores	c
anymore	c
,	i
if	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
want	c
to	c
:	c
I	c
can	c
just	c
stay	c
at	c
home	c
and	c
buy	c
almost	c
everything	c
through	c
it	c
:	c
books	c
,	c
video	c
tapes	c
,	c
clothes	c
and	c
even	c
groceries	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
also	c
possible	c
to	c
read	c
the	c
news	c
or	c
play	c
games	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir/MADAME	i
,	c

Also	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
says	i
,	i
that	c
the	c
show	c
will	i
begin	c
at	c
19.30	c
and	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
20.15	c
;	c
that	c
mean	i
that	c
I	c
have	i
to	c
cancelled	i
a	c
date	c
that	c
I	c
had	c
at	c
21:00	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
coud	i
n't	i
make	c
it	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
present	i
a	c
show	c
you	c
must	c
be	c
on	c
time	c
.	c

Thank	c
for	i
your	c
time	c

your	i
sincerelly	i

Also	i
change	i
my	c
free	c
time	c
,	i
they	c
had	i
invented	c
great	c
games	c
like	c
play	c
station	c
,	c
and	c
you	c
can	c
have	c
a	c
really	c
good	c
time	c
with	i
your	i
friend	i
playing	i
.	c

In	c
the	c
early	i
day	i
,	c
on	c
a	c
raining	i
day	c
you	c
could	c
n't	c
play	c
because	c
most	c
of	i
game	i
were	c
outside	i
the	c
house	c
but	c
now	c
with	c
the	i
technology	c
you	c
can	c
make	i
many	c
things	c
in	c
your	c
house	c
.	c

Another	c
aspect	c
is	c
,	i
on	i
the	i
house	i
artefacts	i
,	i
microwaves	c
,	c
laundrymachine	i
,	i
make	c
life	c
easily	i
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
technology	c
have	i
made	c
human	i
life	i
easily	i
,	c
funier	i
and	c
more	c
comfortable	c
.	c

I	c
had	i
been	c
to	c
London	c
recently	c
for	c
a	c
week	c
's	c
holiday	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
to	c
a	c
musical	c
show	c
in	i
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
saw	c
the	c
advertisement	c
about	i
the	c
show	c
I	c
got	c
very	c
excited	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
always	c
wanted	c
to	c
see	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
had	c
some	c
problems	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
want	c
you	c
to	c
know	c
about	c
that	i
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
when	c
I	c
bought	c
the	c
tickets	c
I	c
had	i
no	c
discount	c
,	c
and	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
it	c
was	c
mentioned	i
that	c
people	c
would	c
have	i
some	c
,	c
and	c
when	c
I	c
got	c
in	i
the	c
theatre	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
play	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
wait	c
for	c
almost	c
an	c
hour	c
until	c
the	c
show	c
begun	c
.	c

Then	c
,	c
I	c
got	c
very	c
disappointed	c
because	c
the	c
actors	c
in	c
the	c
play	c
were	c
not	c
those	c
ones	c
mentioned	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
.	c

Afterwards	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
expecting	c
to	c
have	c
at	c
least	c
a	c
nice	c
dinner	c
in	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
already	c
closed	c
because	c
the	c
show	c
ended	c
too	c
late	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
reading	c
this	c
letter	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

We	c
cannot	c
deny	c
that	c
technology	c
has	c
changed	c
our	c
lives	c
.	c

We	c
can	c
communicate	c
with	c
people	c
in	c
distant	c
countries	c
in	c
real	c
time	c
,	c
using	c
the	c
internet	i
.	c

Also	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
communicate	c
with	c
some	c
friends	c
who	c
live	c
in	c
other	c
countries	c
by	c
e-mail	c
almost	c
every	c
day	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
save	c
some	c
money	c
because	c
I	c
pay	c
for	c
a	c
local	c
call	c
,	c
and	c
not	c
for	c
an	c
international	c
call	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
in	c
reply	c
to	c
your	c
letter	c
asking	c
for	c
further	c
information	c
from	c
me	c
.	c

Besides	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
preffer	i
to	c
stay	c
in	c
tents	i
,	c
because	c
I	c
got	c
used	c
to	c
being	c
in	c
tents	c
since	c
each	i
summer	i
I	i
spent	i
my	i
holidays	i
with	c
my	c
friends	c
at	i
the	c
hills	c
.	c

In	c
adittion	i
,	c
I	c
would	c
rather	i
playing	c
tennis	c
.	c

I	c
also	c
like	c
surfing	c
,	i
I	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
dangerous	c
sport	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
know	c
how	c
to	c
practice	i
it	c
,	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
fact	c
that	c
last	c
year	c
a	c
proffessional	i
surfer	c
tought	i
me	c
.	c

From	c
my	c
point	c
of	c
view	c
,	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
,	c
because	c
sometimes	c
when	c
you	c
are	c
looking	c
for	c
a	c
special	c
good	i
you	c
never	c
find	c
it	c
.	c

Besides	c
,	c
I	c
do	c
not	c
like	c
to	c
waste	c
my	c
time	c
just	c
seeing	i
at	c
a	c
wide	c
variety	c
of	c
products	c
,	c
that	c
make	i
you	c
feel	c
confused	c
and	i
you	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
which	c
one	i
fits	c
you	c
,	c
instead	c
of	c
being	c
with	c
my	c
friends	c
or	c
doing	c
something	c
else	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
when	c
you	c
want	c
to	c
buy	c
something	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
be	c
sure	c
of	c
what	c
you	c
really	c
need	c
,	c
if	c
not	c
the	c
shop	c
assistant	c
has	c
the	c
ability	c
to	c
persuade	c
you	c
to	c
buy	c
something	c
you	c
do	c
not	c
want	c
.	c

Moreover	i
in	c
the	c
shops	c
that	c
sales	i
fashionable	c
clothes	c
.	c

If	c
not	i
shopping	c
never	i
be	c
enjoyable	c
,	c
but	c
also	i
tiring	c
and	c
boring	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
.	i

I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
.	c

Because	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
university	c
student	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
got	c
classes	c
until	c
the	c
midle	i
of	c
June	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
attend	c
to	i
a	c
'	c
Development	i
&	i
Research	i
Conference	c
'	c
at	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
June	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
.	c

Accommodation	c
is	c
very	c
important	c
for	c
me	c
as	c
well	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
staying	c
in	c
log	c
cabins	c
.	c

I	c
've	c
got	c
some	c
skin	c
trouble	c
and	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
sleep	c
very	c
well	c
in	c
tents	c
.	c

I	c
have	i
ever	i
slept	c
in	c
tents	c
when	c
I	c
went	c
camping	c
.	c

That	c
time	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
sleep	i
in	c
tent	c
.	c

Whole	c
night	c
,	c
I	c
felt	c
backache	i
ands	i
shoulder	c
ache	c
so	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
sleep	c
very	c
well	c
.	c

And	c
I	c
've	c
never	c
stayed	c
in	c
log	c
cabins	c
.	c

It	c
sounds	c
wonderful	c
!	c

Especially	c
I	c
love	i
water-painting	i
.	c

It	c
will	i
be	c
fantastic	c
experience	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

Actually	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	i
swimming	i
at	c
all	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
afraid	c
of	c
water	c
.	c

That	i
why	i
I	i
could	i
n't	i
have	i
swimmed	i
yet	c
.	c

You	c
pay	c
for	c
all	c
costs	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
think	c
I	c
'll	c
need	c
some	c
money	c
for	i
clubing	i
or	c
evening	c
events	c
.	c

And	c
please	c
let	c
me	c
know	c
How	c
the	c
weather	c
is	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	i
Your	i
sincerely	c

I	c
always	c
want	c
to	c
buy	c
T-shirts	c
,	c
Jeans	c

Skirts	c
,	c
cosmetic	i
,	c

,	c

earings	i

hats	c
,	c
bags	c
,	c
fancy	c
stationeries	i
,	c
interior	c
stuffs	i
and	c
CD	i
.	c

But	c
it	c
is	c
impossible	c
to	c
buy	c
everything	c
at	c
the	c
same	c
time	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
to	c
chose	i
some	c
of	c
them	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
give	c
up	c
buying	c
most	c
of	c
them	c
.	c

Before	c
I	c
go	c
out	c
home	i
,	c
I	c
make	c
a	c
plan	c
.	c

I	c
feel	c
depressed	c
.	c

I	c
'll	c
think	c
why	i
I	c
'm	c
so	c
poor	c
.	c

Insead	i
of	c
buying	c
something	c
,	c
I	c
buy	c
some	c
fresh	c
food	c
and	c
Ice-cream	c
.	c

They	c
make	c
me	c
happy	c
and	c
rich	c
.	c

I	c
can	c
try	c
every	i
shoes	i
,	c
clothes	c
,	c
hats	c
,	c
accessories	c
and	c
jakect	i
on	c
.	c

They	c
are	c
mine	c
!	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

Dear	c
Ms.	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
pleased	c
to	c
be	c
the	c
winer	i
in	c
your	c
competition	c
.	c

I	c
almost	c
could	c
not	c
believe	c
it	c
when	c
I	c
received	c
the	c
letter	c
you	c
had	i
sent	i
.	c

I	c
have	c
never	c
won	c
a	c
prize	c
like	c
this	c
.	c

During	c
this	c
exciting	c
holiday	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
staying	c
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
.	c

The	c
reason	c
for	c
this	c
is	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
got	i
a	i
difficulty	c
in	i
sleeping	c
in	c
tents	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
is	c
because	c
of	c
my	c
long	c
legs	c
.	c

I	c
don	i
know	c
exactly	c
what	c
is	i
California	i
's	i
weather	i
lime	i
.	c

What	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	i
need	c
to	c
bring	c
with	c
me	c
?	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

I	c
can	c
clearly	c
remember	c
my	c
childhood	c
and	c
our	c
only	c
local	c
shop	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
really	c
astonished	c
by	c
all	c
these	c
shopping	c
centers	i
like	i
ASDA	c
,	c
HOMEBASE	c
,	c
ex	i
.	c

One	c
day	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
shopping	c
center	i
which	c
is	c
only	c
40	c
meters	i
from	c
our	c
house	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
could	c
not	c
find	c
the	c
entrance	c
.	c

I	c
'd	c
walked	c
arround	i
about	i
15	c
minutes	c
until	c
I	c
found	c
the	c
door	c
.	c

I	c
realized	c
that	c
I	c
'd	c
walked	c
so	c
many	c
times	c
in	c
front	c
of	c
the	c
entrance	c
but	c
the	c
door	c
had	c
looked	c
like	c
a	c
window	c
.	c

There	i
were	i
written	i
all	i
things	i
I	i
had	i
to	i
buy	i
.	c

I	c
started	c
looking	c
for	c
the	c
food	c
products	c
written	i
on	c
the	c
paper	i
but	c
I	c
found	c
only	c
the	c
eggs	c
,	c
milk	c
and	c
bread	c
.	c

Nothing	c
else	c
.	c

Later	c
somebody	c
told	c
me	c
that	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
look	c
at	c
the	c
labels	c
on	c
the	c
top	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
announced	c
that	c
there	c
would	c
be	c
discount	c
tickets	c
available	c
,	c
but	c
there	c
were	c
not	c
.	c

Several	c
technological	c
advances	c
in	c
the	c
past	c
five	c
years	c
have	c
changed	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
.	c

Information	c
is	c
spread	c
quickly	c
and	c
you	c
can	c
access	c
in	c
minutes	c
a	c
wide	c
range	c
of	c
data	c
,	c
that	i
would	c
take	c
a	c
much	c
longer	c
time	c
to	i
be	c
found	c
by	c
traditional	c
means	c
.	c

Celular	i
phone	c
can	c
be	c
inconvenient	c
sometimes	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
can	c
be	c
very	c
useful	c
in	c
certain	c
situations	c
:	c
when	c
your	c
car	c
is	i
broken	c
on	i
the	c
road	c
,	c
when	c
you	c
need	c
to	c
be	c
found	c
anywhere	c
and	c
at	c
any	c
time	c
(	c
if	c
you	c
are	c
a	c
doctor	c
,	c
a	c
lawyer	c
or	c
a	c
journalist	c
,	c
for	c
instance	c
)	c
,	c
and	c
so	c
forth	c
.	c

Dear	c
Ms	c
Ryan	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

So	c
if	c
I	c
could	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
,	c
and	c
coming	i
back	c
before	c
6th	i
of	c
August	c
,	c
that	c
would	c
be	c
great	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
living	i
in	c
tents	c
to	c
log	c
cabins	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
never	c
had	c
any	c
experience	c
to	i
live	i
in	c
a	c
tent	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
give	c
it	c
a	c
go	c
.	c

I	c
love	c
swimming	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
am	c
not	c
any	c
good	c
at	c
swimming	c
.	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

It	c
was	c
great	c
to	c
hear	c
from	c
you	c
,	c
have	c
n't	c
seen	c
you	c
since	c
last	c
summer	c
holiday	c
,	c
hope	c
everything	c
is	c
fine	c
in	i
your	c
place	c
.	c

I	c
must	c
say	c
that	c
was	c
a	i
great	c
fun	c
,	i
I	i
've	i
never	c
had	c
this	c
kind	c
of	c
experience	c
before	c
.	c

After	c
that	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
help	c
people	c
who	c
had	c
a	c
ticket	c
but	c
ca	i
n't	i
find	c
their	c
seat	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
excited	c
that	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
closer	c
look	c
at	c
so	c
many	c
famous	c
pop	c
stars	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
&	c
Madam	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
this	c
letter	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
some	c
further	c
information	c
that	c
you	c
need	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
work	c
except	i
that	c
month	c
.	c

Also	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
have	c
the	c
chance	c
to	c
play	c
tennis	c
and	c
sailing	i
at	c
the	c
camp	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
never	c
had	c
a	c
chance	c
to	c
enjoy	c
sailing	c
.	c

I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
try	c
this	c
time	c
.	c

Now	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
two	c
questions	c
about	c
camping	c
.	c

I	c
've	c
never	c
been	c
to	c
California	c
,	c
therefore	c
please	c
let	c
me	c
know	c
about	c
the	c
weather	c
there	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
n't	c
a	c
clue	c
about	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
waiting	c
for	c
your	c
reply	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

It	c
was	c
so	c
nice	c
to	c
hear	c
from	c
you	c
last	c
time	c
.	c

As	c
I	c
mentioned	c
before	c
,	c
I	c
really	c
enjoyed	c
helping	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
last	c
month	c
,	i
the	i
artist	c
's	c
name	c
was	c
"	c
Bonny	c
Pink	c
"	c
who	i
is	c
famous	c
in	c
my	c
country	c
.	c

I	c
guided	c
her	c
to	c
a	c
rest	c
room	c
and	c
served	c
her	c
a	c
cup	c
of	c
tea	c
,	c
and	c
so	c
on	c
.	c

I	c
thought	c
it	c
was	c
most	i
exciting	c
job	c
.	c

Actually	c
,	c
I	c
could	c
have	c
a	c
chance	c
to	c
ask	c
her	c
about	c
music	c
,	c
her	c
favorite	i
artist	c
and	c
her	c
hobby	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
impressed	c
when	c
I	c
heard	c
that	c
she	c
liked	c
playing	i
puzzle	i
alone	c
.	c

She	c
seemed	c
to	c
be	c
very	i
active	c
woman	c
when	c
she	c
was	c
singing	c
but	c
at	c
the	c
same	c
time	c
she	c
had	c
very	i
gentle	c
attitude	c
when	c
she	c
spoke	c
to	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
can	c
enjoy	c
.	i

I	c
'm	c
waiting	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

,	c
I	c
helped	c
to	c
prepare	c
the	c
stage	c
before	c
the	c
band	c
arrived	c
.	c

The	c
music	i
instruments	c
were	c
transported	c
from	c
the	c
lorries	c
(	c
three	c
big	c
lorries	c
!	c
)	c
into	c
the	c
concert	c
hall	c
and	c
I	c
helped	c
to	c
put	c
them	c
at	i
the	c
right	c
position	c
on	c
the	c
stage	c
.	c

They	c
were	c
very	c
heavy	c
and	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
carry	c
them	c
with	c
care	c
because	c
they	c
were	c
very	c
important	c
for	i
the	c
band	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
a	c
fan	c
of	c
this	c
band	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
seen	c
them	c
in	c
flesh	i
.	c

The	c
most	c
exciting	c
thing	c
about	c
my	c
experience	c
was	c
that	c
the	c
band	c
spoke	c
to	c
me	c
after	c
the	c
concert	c
.	c

The	c
band	c
was	c
very	c
satisfied	c
with	c
the	c
stage	c
and	c
appreciated	c
our	c
work	c
.	c

I	c
want	c
to	c
help	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
again	c
!	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c

16th	c
November	c
2000	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
an	c
evening	c
I	c
spent	c
in	c
your	c
theatre	c
to	i
see	i
a	c
musical	c
show	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
the	c
actors	c
were	c
n't	c
those	c
announced	c
.	c

Indeed	c
,	c
instead	c
of	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
;	i
we	c
had	c
mean	i
actors	c
.	c

To	c
end	c
,	c
in	i
spite	i
of	i
being	c
opened	i
,	c
the	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
for	c
reparations	i
.	c

Because	c
of	c
all	c
those	i
inconvenients	i
,	c
I	c
ask	c
you	c
a	i
total	c
refund	c
.	c

You	c
may	c
contact	c
me	c
at	c
my	c
home	c
address	c
whenever	c
you	c
wish	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

When	c
poor	c
Caroline	c
arrived	c
at	c
school	c
on	c
Wednesday	c
morning	c
all	c
the	c
students	c
of	i
her	c
class	c
knew	c
about	c
what	c
she	c
had	c
just	i
said	i
the	c
day	c
before	c
to	c
Pat	c
.	c

After	c
a	c
long	c
conversation	c
they	c
eventually	c
decided	c
to	c
split	c
up	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c

All	c
of	c
the	c
students	c
in	c
my	c
class	c
have	c
read	c
through	c
the	c
programmes	c
that	c
you	c
have	c
set	i
,	i
they	i
are	c
quite	c
interesting	c
,	c
especially	c
the	c
river	c
trip	c
to	c
Greenwich	c
,	c
because	c
some	c
of	c
us	c
may	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
university	c
there	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

So	c
we	c
can	c
walk	c
around	c
and	c
see	c
how	i
it	i
looks	i
like	i
in	i
Greenwich	i
.	c

All	c
of	c
us	c
want	c
to	c
go	c
to	i
this	c
trip	c
,	c
but	c
some	c
of	c
my	c
classmates	c
saw	c
an	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
,	c
and	c
we	c
all	i
would	i
like	c
to	c
go	c
there	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
from	c
10	c
am	c
to	c
7	c
p.m.	c
,	i
it	i
is	i
about	i
the	c
latest	c
fashion	c
,	c
leisure	c
and	c
sports	c
wear	c
,	c
make	i
up	i
and	c
hairstyles	c
,	i
all	i
of	c
us	c
are	c
really	c
interesting	i
,	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
free	c
for	c
student	i
to	c
get	c
in	c
as	c
well	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
a	c
really	c
good	c
opportunity	c
to	c
go	c
because	c
most	c
of	c
us	c
are	c
studying	c
fashion	c
design	c
,	c
and	c
we	c
can	c
learn	c
loads	c
of	c
things	c
in	i
there	c
.	c

So	c
may	i
you	c
please	c
change	i
the	c
visit	c
of	i
the	c
Science	c
Museum	c
to	i
Wednesday	c
afternoon	c
,	c
and	c
we	c
can	c
cancel	c
our	c
shopping	c
and	c
free	c
time	c
,	c
so	c
we	c
can	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
fashion	c
show	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
dangerous	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
knew	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
two	c
years	c
ago	c
,	i
me	i
and	i
my	i
classmates	i
went	c
to	i
a	c
leadership	c
trip	c
in	i
London	c
.	c

This	c
trip	c
was	c
organised	c
by	c
our	c
form	c
tutor	c
,	i
he	i
wanted	c
to	c
test	c
us	i
if	c
we	c
trust	i
each	c
other	c
and	c
worked	c
in	c
a	c
team	c
,	c
and	c
the	c
trip	c
last	i
for	c
3	c
days	c
.	c

The	c
first	c
days	c
was	i
going	i
fine	c
,	i
we	i
just	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
some	c
teamwork	c
things	c
.	c

In	i
the	c
second	c
day	c
,	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
climb	c
up	c
a	c
twenty	i
metres	i
hill	c
with	c
our	c
hands	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
so	c
difficult	c
for	c
me	c
because	c
I	c
was	i
really	c
scared	c
to	c
stand	c
in	i
a	c
high	c
place	c
since	c
I	c
was	c
young	c
.	c

I	c
did	c
not	c
want	c
to	c
climb	c
up	c
but	c
I	c
did	c
not	c
have	c
any	c
choice	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
:	i
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
,	c
presented	c
in	c
your	c
theatre	c
on	c
15th	c
of	c
June	c
.	c

I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
to	c
buy	c
the	c
ticket	c
and	c
expected	c
to	c
have	i
a	c
discount	c
as	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
student	c
.	c

At	i
last	i
,	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
it	c
needed	c
cleaning	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
was	c
definitely	c
not	c
a	i
perfect	c
evening	c
as	i
garenteed	i
in	c
your	c
advertisement	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
having	c
a	c
full	c
refund	c
in	c
the	c
very	c
near	c
future	c
as	c
I	c
did	c
not	c
enjoy	c
it	c
at	c
all	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
so	c
sad	c
about	c
it	c
and	c
did	c
not	c
forgive	c
Pat	c
even	c
though	c
she	c
apologise	i
for	i
thousands	c
of	c
times	c
.	c

A	c
week	c
later	c
,	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
still	c
in	c
a	c
bad	c
mood	c
,	c
my	c
form	c
teacher	c
,	c
Mrs	c
Brown	c
,	c
talked	c
about	c
jobs	c
in	c
our	c
English	c
lesson	c
.	c

She	c
told	c
us	c
there	c
were	c
numerous	c
types	c
of	c
job	c
in	c
the	c
world	c
.	c

She	c
asked	c
.	c

Many	c
students	c
raised	c
their	c
hands	c
.	c

'	c
If	c
there	c
were	c
no	c

would	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

Being	c
on	c
a	i
holiday	c
trip	i
in	c
London	c
,	c
I	c
dreamed	c
to	i
go	i
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
for	i
a	c
musical	c
show	c
.	c

In	c
fact	c
,	c
your	c
musical	c
show	c
was	c
attractive	c
:	c
actors	c
,	c
time	c
,	c
restaurant	c
,	c
discount	c
tickets	c
,	c
and	c
also	c
the	c
title	c
!	c

But	c
all	i
was	c
disappointing	c
!	c

First	c
,	c
as	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
found	i
of	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
I	c
have	i
been	i
surprised	c
he	i
totally	i
changed	i
his	c
voice	c
,	c
face	c
,	c
and	c
so	c
on	c
!	c

It	c
was	c
not	c
Danny	c
on	c
the	c
scene	i
!	c

There	c
were	c
no	c
discount	c
places	i
because	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
planed	i
like	i
this	i
by	i
the	i
theatre	i
.	c

What	c
was	c
written	c
on	i
the	c
advertisement	c
?	c

The	c
summum	i
was	c
reached	c
when	c
I	c
saw	c
the	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
for	c
"	c
holidays	c
"	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
terribly	c
ennoyed	i
!	c

So	c
I	c
need	i
now	i
a	c
"	c
perfect	c
-	c
money	i
back	i
-	c
"	c
for	i
replacement	c
of	i
your	c
"	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
"	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
hope	c
you	c
will	c
accept	c
and	c
understand	c
this	c
request	c
.	c

"	c
How	c
has	c
modern	c
technology	c
changed	c
your	c
daily	c
life	c
?	c
"	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
"	c
daily	c
life	c
"	c
concerns	c
(	c
as	c
far	c
as	c
I	c
am	c
concerned	c
)	c
my	c
life	c
everywhere	c
,	c
and	c
more	c
precisely	c
at	c
home	c
,	c
at	c
the	c
university	c
and	c
at	c
work	c
.	c

Up	i
to	i
two	c
years	c
ago	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
working	c
with	c
a	c
written	i
booknote	i
or	c
agenda	i
,	c
and	c
I	c
used	c
to	c
phone	i
with	i
a	c
wired	c
phone	c
system	c
.	c

Nowaday	i
,	c
I	c
organise	c
my	c
activities	c
with	c
an	c
electronic	c
organizer	c
that	c
authorizes	i
me	c
to	c
connect	c
to	c
Internet	i
by	c
infra-red	c
link	c
with	c
my	c
mobile	c
phone	c
to	c
get	c
informations	i
and	c
electronic	c
mails	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
always	c
joinable	i
with	i
my	c
mobile	c
phone	c
,	c
that	i
is	c
also	c
sometimes	i
boring	i
!	c

I	c
often	c
go	c
on	c
Internet	i
to	c
find	c
informations	i
for	i
studying	c
a	c
precise	i
subject	c
more	c
accutely	i
(	c
university	c
technology	c
sites	c
)	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
which	c
is	c
called	c
OVER	c
THE	c
RAINBOW	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
bought	c
a	c
second	c
musical	c
show	c
ticket	c
which	c
start	i
at	c
19:30	c
but	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
turned	c
up	c
the	i
show	c
,	c
there	c
was	c
another	c
actor	c
instead	c
of	c
him	c
.	c

But	i
I	i
could	i
go	i
evening	i
out	i
.	i

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
I	c
believe	c
your	c
advertisement	c
completely	c
misled	c
.	i

yours	c
faithfully	c

Nowadays	i
,	c
mordern	c
technology	c
has	c
increasingly	i
been	i
developing	i
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
the	c
main	c
advantage	c
is	c
developing	i
of	c
medical	c
technology	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
if	c
you	c
were	c
hurt	c
seriously	c
like	c
cutting	c
leg	i
,	i
the	c
new	c
medical	c
technology	c
could	c
rebuilit	i
part	c
of	c
your	c
body	c
.	c

Another	c
advantage	c
is	c
sharing	c
information	c
.	c

So	c
at	c
the	c
same	c
time	c
many	c
people	c
can	c
share	c
some	c
information	c
even	c
though	c
they	c
live	c
in	c
different	c
country	i
.	c

In	c
contrast	c
,	c
the	c
technology	c
can	c
cause	c
a	i
pollution	c
.	c

By	c
developing	c
of	i
transport	c
,	c
we	c
can	c
get	c
wherever	c
you	i
want	c
to	c
go	c
easily	c
,	c
however	c
it	c
could	c
cause	c
serious	c
air	c
pollution	c
like	c
acid-rain	c
and	c
smog	c
.	c

In	c
conculsion	i
,	c
I	i
conciderly	i
said	i
we	i
has	i
been	i
charged	i
by	i
morder	i
technology	i
in	c
two	c
way	i
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

When	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
forty-five	c
minutes	c
later	i
,	c
I	c
realised	c
that	c
the	c
main	c
actor	c
had	c
been	c
changed	i
.	c

That	c
change	i
really	c
disappointed	c
me	c
.	c

Another	c
problem	c
was	c
that	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
have	i
any	c
discount	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
n't	c
alone	c
,	c
we	c
were	c
five	c
persons	i
.	c

Our	c
idea	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
,	i
was	c
to	c
visit	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

I	c
invited	c
my	c
best	c
friends	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
asked	c
Christian	c
to	c
bring	c
some	c
videos	c
.	c

I	c
thought	c
of	c
the	c
idea	c
of	c
telling	c
our	c
parents	c
that	c
we	c
had	c
a	i
camping	c
with	c
the	c
school	c
.	c

We	c
were	c
all	c
agree	i
.	c

We	c
were	c
very	c
calm	c
,	c
discussing	c
the	c
last	c
details	c
of	c
our	c
weekend	c
,	c
when	c
we	c
heard	c
a	c
noise	c
that	c
came	c
out	i
from	c
a	c
room	c
that	c
was	c
near	c
us	c
.	c

Manuel	c
opened	c
the	c
door	c
,	c
and	c
there	c
she	c
was	c
,	c
Pat	c
with	c
Ramiro	c
's	c
sister	c
hearing	i
all	c
our	c
conversation	c
.	c

Thanks	c
a	c
lot	c
for	c
your	c
briefly	i
and	c
nice	c
letter	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
pleased	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
the	c
information	c
required	c
:	c

Firstly	c
,	c
the	c
most	c
suitable	c
month	c
would	c
be	c
in	i
July	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
busy	c
in	i
my	c
work	c
now	c
,	c
and	c
my	c
children	c
are	c
in	i
holiday	c
then	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
log	c
cabins	c
,	c
because	c
they	c
are	c
more	c
comfortable	c
.	c

The	c
activities	c
are	c
really	c
interesting	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
take	c
part	c
on	i
Painting	c
and	c
Climbing	c
.	c

Thanks	c
in	c
advance	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Ryan	c

Thank	c
you	c
a	i
lot	i
for	c
your	c
kind	c
letter	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
surprised	c
on	i
the	c
result	c
of	c
the	c
competition	c
.	c

Now	c
I	c
am	c
happy	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
all	c
the	c
information	c
you	c
need	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
better	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
travel	c
on	i
July	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
more	c
confortable	i
and	c
I	c
am	c
afraid	c
about	i
wild	c
animals	c
.	c

I	c
saw	c
,	i
you	c
offer	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
activities	c
,	i
that'is	i
fantastic	c
!	c

The	c
other	c
activity	c
I	c
like	c
very	c
muche	i
is	c
swimming	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
I	c
have	c
give	i
to	c
you	c
all	c
the	c
information	c
you	c
needed	i
and	c
I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

I	c
had	c
to	c
start	c
very	c
early	c
in	c
the	c
morning	c
,	c
at	c
7.30	c
.	c

Then	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
put	i
on	i
the	c
night	i
lights	i
and	c
decorate	c
the	c
whole	c
room	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
afternoon	c
the	c
singers	c
cames	i
in	c
and	c
I	c
also	c
could	c
have	c
an	c
interview	c
with	c
Ricky	c
Martin	c
.	c

He	c
is	c
very	c
beatiful	i
!	c

Fortunatly	i
we	c
had	c
no	c
problem	c
.	c

The	c
concert	c
was	c
a	c
success	c
.	c

We	c
went	c
to	c
a	c
nice	c
restaurant	c
and	c
enjoyed	c
dinner	c
together	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
sure	c
my	i
dear	c
Kim	c
,	c
I	c
will	c
never	c
forget	c
that	c
wonderful	c
experience	c
.	c

lot	i
of	c
kisses	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	i
've	i
read	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
that	c
the	c
actors	c
who	c
were	c
playing	c
that	c
night	c
were	c
D.	c
Brook	c
and	c
T.	c
Truelove	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
started	c
at	c
20.15	c
instead	c
of	c
19.30.	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
really	c
hungry	c
because	c
I	c
had	c
n't	c
had	c
my	c
dinner	c
that	c
evening	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
be	c
on	c
time	c
for	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

I	c
'd	c
rather	c
say	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
catastrophe	c
!	c

And	c
I	c
am	c
really	c
sorry	c
,	c
but	c
consequently	c
I	c
would	c
ask	c
you	c
for	c
some	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

Modern	c
technology	c
has	c
completly	i
changed	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
,	c
which	c
became	i
more	c
comfortable	c
,	c
and	c
easier	c
.	c

For	c
instance	c
,	c
my	c
discman	c
gives	c
me	c
the	c
possibility	c
to	c
listen	c
to	c
music	c
or	c
to	c
the	c
radio	c
everywhere	c
:	c
in	c
the	c
underground	c
,	c
or	c
when	c
I	c
walk	c
in	c
the	c
city	c
.	c

Another	c
simple	c
example	c
is	c
my	c
mobile	c
telephone	c
;	c
A	c
few	c
years	c
ago	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
buy	c
a	c
telephone	c
card	c
and	c
then	c
to	c
find	c
a	c
telephone	c
box	c
to	c
call	c
my	c
parents	c
and	c
to	c
tell	c
them	c
that	c
I	c
would	c
be	c
late	c
for	c
dinner	c
,	c
or	c
other	c
stuff	c
like	c
that	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
,	c

However	c
we	i
have	c
send	i
an	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
"	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
"	c
,	c
which	c
will	c
take	c
place	c
on	c
the	i
Tuesday	c
14th	c
March	c
from	c
10.00	c
am	c
to	c
19.00	c
pm	c
during	c
our	c
trip	c
in	i
London	c
and	c
in	c
which	c
the	c
follow	i
topics	c
will	c
be	c
showed	i
:	c

Latest	c

Make	i
up	i

Thank	c
you	c
in	i
advanced	i
for	c
your	c
comprehention	i
and	c
we	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
for	i
you	c
.	c

The	c
private	c
life	c
of	c
famous	c
people	c
!	c

They	c
have	i
always	i
to	c
be	c
careful	c
about	c
what	c
they	c
say	c
and	c
what	c
they	c
do	c
.	c

In	i
my	i
opinion	i
I	i
think	i
that	c
if	c
famous	c
people	c
is	i
always	c
followed	c
by	c
journalists	c
it	c
is	c
not	c
the	c
responsability	i
of	c
the	c
media	c
but	c
of	c
the	c
huge	c
quantity	i
of	c
people	c
who	c
are	c
interested	c
in	c
famous	c
people	i
life	i
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
because	i
they	c
have	c
admiration	i
for	c
them	c
and	c
lastly	c
because	c
they	c
want	c
dreams	i
and	c
see	c
what	c
a	c
"	c
star	i
life	c
"	c
look	i
like	c
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
people	c
who	c
are	c
to	i
much	i
interested	c
in	c
other	c
people	i
life	i
have	i
not	i
an	c
interesting	c
life	c
and	c
are	c
unhappy	c
!	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Smith	c
,	c

What	c
a	c
surprise	c
!	c

Your	c
advertisement	c
was	c
a	c
quite	c
lie	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
my	i
disappointment	c
.	c

Every	c
point	i
were	i
wrong	c
.	c

At	i
first	i
,	c
from	i
your	c
advert	c
Danny	i
Brook	c
(	c
who	c
is	c
a	c
very	c
good	c
singer	c
I	c
appreciate	c
very	c
much	c
)	c
was	i
not	c
here	i
.	c

An	c
unknown	c
man	i
was	c
singing	c
,	c
not	c
in	c
tone	i
-	c
awful	c
for	c
my	c
ears	c
-	c
(	c
poor	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
!	c
such	c
a	c
professional	c
singer	c
with	c
a	c
beginner	c
!	c
)	c

At	i
second	i
,	c
to	c
go	c
on	c
with	i
the	c
beginning	c
,	c
your	c
show	c
started	c
not	c
at	c
19.30	c
but	c
nearly	c
one	c
hour	c
later	c
(	c
20.15	c
to	c
be	c
more	c
precise	c
!	c
)	c

It	c
was	c
closed	c
for	c
some	i
improvements	i
!	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
will	c
understand	c
my	i
evening	c
was	c
detestable	c
and	c
you	c
will	c
give	c
me	c
back	c
my	c
money	c
.	c

I	c
join	i
this	i
letter	c
my	c
two	c
tickets	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
!	c

Poor	i
of	i
I	i
,	c
I	c
thought	c
it	c
was	c
nice	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
friend	c
and	c
to	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
share	c
lots	c
of	c
things	c
!	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
young	c
when	c
this	c
story	c
happened	c
but	c
though	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
child	c
's	c
adventure	c
I	c
remember	c
it	c
yet	i
.	c

I	c
was	c
just	c
thirteen	c
years	c
old	c
!	c

I	c
had	c
read	c
a	c
very	c
good	c
book	c
about	c
pirates	c
and	c
I	c
know	c
I	c
got	i
a	c
very	c
creative	c
imagination	c
.	c

To	i
make	i
to	i
profit	i
my	i
ideas	i
my	c
parents	c
lived	c
in	c
a	c
small	c
village	c
near	c
a	i
wonderful	c
country	i
.	c

Like	c
my	c
heros	i
I	i
would	c
like	i
to	c
live	c
in	c
a	c
ship	c
and	c
decided	c
to	c
build	c
something	c
in	c
a	c
tree	c
.	c

The	c
highest	c
tree	c
near	c
a	c
river	c
I	c
have	c
ever	c
seen	c
.	c

With	c
my	c
friend	c
Pat	c
(	c
I	i
put	i
him	i
in	i
the	i
confidence	i
)	c
I	c
started	c
to	c
work	c
and	c
my	c
idea	c
became	c
real	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
our	c
fortress	c
and	c
every	c
day	c
we	c
could	c
improve	c
it	c
.	c

He	c
had	c
a	c
fault	c
:	c
he	c
talked	c
a	c
lot	c
and	c
told	c
an	i
other	i
friend	c
our	c
story	i
.	c

What	c
a	c
catestrophee	i
!	c

All	c
children	i
went	i
from	i
the	c
village	c
and	c
wanted	c
to	c
play	c
with	c
us	c
.	c

There	c
was	i
lots	c
of	c
fights	c
between	c
us	c
and	c
we	c
were	c
naughty	c
like	c
child	i
could	i
be	c
with	c
other	c
child	i
.	c

The	c
result	c
was	c
my	c
ship	c
was	c
destroyed	c
and	c
never	c
more	i
I	i
could	i
trust	c
in	c
any	c
friend	c
!	c

Dear	c
Miss	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
in	c
reply	c
to	c
your	c
letter	c
,	i
informing	c
me	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
the	i
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
which	c
is	c
two	c
weeks	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
in	c
the	c
U.S.A	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
really	c
pleased	c
to	c
hear	c
that	c
the	c
prize	c
includes	c
accommodation	c
.	c

Singing	c
has	c
been	c
my	c
only	c
hobby	c
since	c
I	c
was	c
5	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
say	c
that	c
I	c
am	c
quite	c
good	c
at	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
whether	c
going	c
there	c
in	c
July	c
is	c
possible	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

I	c
'm	c
sorry	c
I	c
have	c
n't	c
written	c
for	c
so	c
long	c
.	c

Last	c
month	c
,	c
I	c
helped	c
at	i
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
which	i
I	c
really	c
enjoyed	c
.	c

The	c
singer	c
,	i
who	c
took	i
place	i
,	i
was	c
n't	c
one	c
of	c
my	c
favourites	c
,	c
but	c
having	c
the	c
opportunity	c
to	c
experience	c
being	c
stuff	i
there	c
,	i
was	c
just	c
amazing	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
help	c
my	c
friend	c
with	c
the	c
lights	c
,	c
so	c
that	i
I	c
could	c
see	c
all	c
that	i
screaming	i
like	i
made	i
crowd	i
.	c

Do	c
you	c
know	c
what	c
Kim	c
,	c
I	c
've	c
never	c
thought	c
before	c
,	i
that	c
enjoying	c
yourself	c
like	c
this	c
,	i
could	c
be	c
weirdly	c
.	i

But	c
I	c
'm	c
really	c
happy	c
,	i
that	c
I	c
had	c
even	c
small	i
role	c
in	c
making	i
people	c
enjoying	i
themselves	c
.	c

I	c
mean	c
,	c
all	c
that	i
flashing	c
lights	c
,	c
the	i
changing	i
colours	i
of	i
them	i
,	c
I	c
believe	c
they	c
helped	c
much	i
.	c

Even	c
though	c
I	c
was	c
just	c
telling	c
my	c
friend	c
what	c
the	c
next	c
composition	c
of	c
colours	c
was	c
,	c
I	c
consider	c
myself	c
being	i
very	c
successful	i
.	c

And	c
finally	c
,	c
the	c
greatest	c
news	c
.	i

I	c
was	c
introduced	c
to	c
the	c
singer	c
by	c
my	c
friend	c
,	c
who	c
works	c
for	c
him	c
.	c

This	c
was	c
maybe	c
the	c
best	c
part	c
of	c
being	c
there	c
.	c

Lots	c
of	c
love	c
,	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

When	c
I	c
read	c
the	c
advertisment	i
for	c
the	c
show	c
I	c
was	c
really	c
excited	c
but	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
I	c
was	c
not	c
very	c
happy	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
following	c
problems	c
.	c

The	c
advertisment	i
also	c
says	c
that	c
there	c
are	c
discounts	c
available	c
but	c
this	c
is	c
not	c
true	c
,	c
there	c
were	c
none	c
.	c

Why	c
do	c
you	c
give	c
those	i
information	c
in	c
an	c
advertisment	i
.	i

Because	c
of	c
these	c
problems	c
I	c
had	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
for	c
a	i
compensation	c
,	c
maybe	c
to	c
get	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

I	c
grew	c
up	c
in	c
a	c
world	c
with	i
full	c
of	c
technology	c
and	c
for	c
me	c
the	c
development	i
in	c
the	i
technology	c
is	c
not	c
very	c
big	i
.	c

Of	c
course	c
,	c
it	c
changes	c
,	c
it	c
became	c
normal	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
mobile	c
phone	c
or	c
to	i
use	i
mainly	i
the	c
computer	c
and	c
the	c
internet	i
.	c

It	c
becomes	c
more	i
and	i
more	i
easier	i
to	c
use	c
the	c
computer	c
for	c
everything	c
.	c

That	i
goes	i
quicker	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
easier	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
think	c
in	i
my	c
generation	c
it	i
is	c
not	c
a	c
really	c
big	c
difference	c
.	c

The	c
second	c
reason	c
is	c
the	c
weather	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
a	c
baby	c
and	c
three	c
dogs	c
,	c
so	c
it	c
should	c
be	c
better	c
in	c
log	i
cabins	i
.	c

I	c
'd	c
like	c
spend	c
all	c
of	c
time	i
in	c
a	c
swimming-pool	i
because	c
I	c
love	c
swimming	c
.	c

I	c
like	i
also	i
surfing	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
love	c
the	c
wind	c
in	c
the	i
hair	c
and	c
the	i
fresh	i
on	i
my	i
body	i
.	c

May	c
I	c
have	c
a	c
babysitter	c
?	c

Best	c

Dear	c

Me	c

and	c
when	c
I	c

happing	i
on	c
the	c
stage	c

I	c
decided	c
to	c
help	c

.	c

Of	c
course	c
you	c
know	c
,	i
I	c
'm	c
a	c
singer	c

I	c
picked	c
my	i
microphone	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
handed	c
it	c
to	c
the	c
singer	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
so	c
glad	c

Dear	c
Sir	c

Re	c
:	c
The	c
Musical	c
Show	c
Presented	c
by	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c

With	i
the	i
reference	i
of	i
the	c
advertisement	c
published	c
in	c
the	c
New	c
Strait	c
Times	c
newspaper	c
on	c
the	c
22nd	c
of	c
MAY	c
2000	c
,	c
I	c
,	c
as	c
a	c
consumer	i
,	c
who	c
is	c
a	c
musical	i
show	i
avid	i
and	c
a	c
great	c
fans	i
of	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
who	c
is	i
said	c
to	c
be	c
stared	i
in	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
presentation	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
really	c
furious	c
of	i
watching	c
a	c
show	c
starring	c
by	i
a	c
different	c
actor	c
,	c
instead	c
of	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
.	i

Besides	c
this	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
almost	c
45	c
minutes	c
later	c
than	c
what	i
it	c
was	c
said	i
to	c
be	i
.	c

.	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
completely	i
disappointed	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
told	c
that	c
there	c
were	c
not	c
any	c
discounts	c
for	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

I	c
also	c
found	c
out	c
that	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
not	c
opened	i
after	c
the	c
show	c
due	c
to	c
the	i
shortage	i
of	i
food	i
sold	i
.	c

I	c
was	c
really	c
hungry	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
and	c
was	c
pissed	i
off	i
.	c

With	i
all	c
the	c
above	c
points	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
for	c
some	c
money	c
return	i
.	c

I	c
would	i
consider	c
to	i
bring	i
this	c
complains	i
to	c
the	i
court	c
if	c
I	c
do	c
not	c
receive	c
any	i
agreeable	i
explaination	i
from	c
the	c
theatre	c
.	c

Thank	c
You	c
.	c

Fashion	c
is	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
most	c
popular	c
topics	c
people	c
discuss	c
about	i
in	i
the	i
past	i
,	i
now	i
and	i
also	i
in	i
the	i
future	i
.	c

However	c
,	c
things	c
re	i
recycling	i
from	c
time	c
to	c
time	c
.	c

So	i
do	i
the	i
objective	i
of	i
wearing	i
clothes	i
.	c

I	c
will	i
imagine	i
that	c
,	i
people	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
,	c
for	c
example	c
100	c
years	c
from	c
now	c
,	c
will	c
wear	c
clothes	c
for	c
protection	c
like	c
people	c
did	c
in	c
the	c
past	c
.	c

The	i
people	i
in	c
the	c
past	c
wear	i
clothes	c
to	c
protect	c
themselves	c
from	c
the	c
cold	c
air	c
,	c
hot	c
weather	c
and	c
strong	c
wind	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
people	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
will	c
likely	i
to	i
wear	i
helmets	c
with	c
oxygen	i
gas	i
well	i
provided	i
.	c

It	c
is	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
increasing	c
number	i
of	c
population	i
and	c
the	c
shortage	c
of	c
the	i
oxygen	c
gas	c
in	c
the	c
atmosphere	c
.	c

They	c
will	c
also	c
wear	c
water-proof	c
,	c
ultra-violet	i
proof	i
and	c
other	c
dangerous	i
liquid-proof	i
clothes	c
to	c
protect	c
themselves	c
These	i
clothes	c
have	c
to	c
be	c
made	c
of	c
something	c
light	c
,	c
suitable	i
to	c
wear	c
and	c
protective	c
.	c

All	c
the	c
above	c
ideas	c
are	c
needed	c
to	c
make	i
them	i
bare	i
no	i
burden	i
when	c
wearing	c
these	c
special	i
designed	c
clothes	c
.	c

The	c
future	c
is	c
a	i
hope	c
and	c
a	i
dream	c
for	c
everyone	c
in	i
the	c
earth	c
.	c

Therefore	c
,	c
I	c
will	c
suggest	c
that	c
we	c
all	c
nov	i
to	c
keep	c
the	c
enviroment	i
clean	c
and	c
healthy	c
for	c
the	c
next	c
generation	c
.	c

2000	c

Dear	c
Miss	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
really	c
pleased	c
to	c
be	c
the	c
winner	c
of	c
your	c
competition	c
and	c
I	c
cannot	c
help	c
thinking	c
about	c
the	c
two	c
weeks	c
in	c
the	c
USA	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
only	c
in	c
June	c
given	i
that	c
my	c
wife	c
will	c
come	c
with	c
me	c
:	i
her	c
holiday	i
are	c
only	c
in	c
June	c
.	c

In	c
fact	c
,	c
this	c
activity	c
seems	c
to	c
be	c
very	c
interresting	i
.	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
what	c
sort	c
of	c
clothes	c
must	c
we	c
have	c
for	c
the	c
different	c
activities	c
?	c

I	c
hope	c
my	c
answers	c
will	c
satisfy	c
you	c
.	c

I	c
thank	c
you	c
again	c
.	c

Tom	c
Turner	c

After	c
having	c
thought	c
about	c
this	c
video	c
and	c
asked	c
different	i
people	c
so	c
as	c
to	c
know	c
what	c
they	c
suggested	c
,	c
I	c
reached	c
the	c
following	c
conclusions	c
:	c
we	c
must	c
film	c
the	c
lessons	c
which	c
are	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
and	c
the	c
activities	c
which	c
take	c
a	i
great	c
part	c
in	i
a	c
day	c
at	c
school	c
;	c
this	c
being	c
in	c
three	c
parts	c
.	c

Then	c
,	c
we	c
should	c
film	c
the	c
English	c
class	c
so	c
as	c
to	c
show	c
who	c
makes	i
the	c
film	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
as	c
Mathematics	i
are	i
the	c
main	c
lesson	c
in	c
the	c
morning	c
,	c
we	c
ought	c
to	c
film	c
a	i
time	c
where	i
we	c
are	c
in	c
MathClass	i

The	c
better	i
to	i
do	c
would	c
be	c
to	c
present	i
the	c
cooking	c
personnal	i
for	i
they	c
are	c
very	c
nice	c
.	c

the	c
afternoon	c

I	c
advise	c
to	i
finish	i
with	c
a	c
lesson	i
of	i
Chemistry	i
so	c
that	c
people	c
see	c
the	c
laboratery	i
.	c

Before	c
that	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
have	c
showed	i
the	c
break	c
at	c
3	c
o'clock	c
which	i
is	c
important	c
for	c
us	c
.	c

Dear	c
Manager	c
:	c

Another	c
point	c
that	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
comply	i
about	c
,	i
is	c
the	c
time	c
that	c
the	c
musical	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
start	c
(	c
19:30	c
)	c
but	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
,	c
so	c
there	c
was	c
a	i
mayor	i
unsatisfaction	i
about	i
it	i
,	c
but	c
the	c
last	c
and	c
worst	c
thing	c
was	c
that	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
the	c
British	c
health	c
institute	c
considered	c
that	i
your	c
food	c
was	i
unhealthy	c
,	c
and	c
not	i
considering	i
many	c
other	c
points	c
like	c
unsatisfactory	c
service	c
,	c
and	c
uncomfortable	c
seats	c
.	c

In	i
consequence	i
of	i
the	c
reasons	c
I	c
have	c
already	c
explained	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
if	c
I	c
can	c
have	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
,	c
but	c
this	c
is	c
not	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
to	i
me	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
want	c
your	c
theatre	c
to	c
change	c
and	c
become	c
the	c
best	c
.	c

Science	c
and	c
Technology	c
is	c
a	c
theme	c
very	c
discussed	i
nowdays	i
,	c
most	c
of	c
the	c
comunity	i
of	c
our	c
city	c
,	c
and	c
of	c
the	c
world	c
,	c
were	i
technology	c
has	c
arrived	c
,	c
confirms	c
that	c
it	c
has	c
in	c
some	c
way	c
improved	c
their	c
way	c
of	c
life	c
.	c

But	c
not	c
all	i
about	c
technology	c
and	c
computers	c
is	c
good	c
,	c
because	c
many	c
people	c
,	c
and	c
me	c
in	c
a	c
control	i
way	c
,	c
had	i
become	c
computer	i
's	i
an	i
thechnologic	i
's	i
slaves	c
,	c
and	c
we	c
can	i
not	i
do	c
anything	c
without	c
a	c
machine	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
not	c
saying	c
that	c
it	c
's	c
wrong	c
or	c
bad	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
accept	c
that	c
they	c
make	c
easier	i
our	i
daily	i
tasks	i
,	c
but	c
we	c
have	c
to	c
mantain	i
our	c
independence	c
as	c
humans	c
.	c

Dear	c
Miss	c
Ryan	c
.	i

In	c
addition	c
I	c
am	c
keen	c
on	c
swimming	c
but	c
actually	c
I	c
am	c
not	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
swimming	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
just	c
started	c
to	c
learn	c
swimming	i
but	c
I	c
have	c
really	c
been	c
enjoying	c
it	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
good	i
chance	c
to	c
improve	c
my	c
swimming	c
.	c

In	c
fact	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
some	c
questions	c
that	i
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
will	c
need	c
,	c
what	c
else	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
bring	c
with	c
and	i
if	i
I	i
have	i
a	i
emergency	i
what	i
you	i
can	i
do	i
for	i
.	c

It	c
is	c
not	c
,	c
however	c
,	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
that	i
there	c
are	c
both	c
advantages	c
and	c
disadvantages	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
quite	c
many	i
advantages	c
of	i
shopping	c
are	i
that	c
it	c
can	c
be	c
the	c
solvation	i
of	i
our	c
stress	c
and	c
boring	i
.	c

Also	c
shopping	c
makes	c
people	c
happier	c
by	c
using	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
money	c
and	c
it	c
influnce	i
even	i
economic	i
situation	i
more	i
flexably	i
.	i

There	c
are	c
,	c
in	c
contrast	c
,	c
disadvantages	c
at	c
the	c
same	c
time	c
.	c

When	c
we	c
are	c
having	i
a	i
shopping	c
,	c
we	c
often	c
find	c
that	c
the	c
place	c
where	c
people	c
often	c
go	c
for	c
a	i
shopping	c
is	c
too	c
crowed	i
and	c
it	c
makes	c
us	c
more	c
tired	c
.	c

Also	c
there	c
are	c
plenty	c
of	c
dangerous	i
that	i
lots	c
of	c
people	c
have	c
wallet	i
stollen	i
because	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
public	c
place	c
and	c
there	c
are	c
too	c
many	c
people	c
.	c

Tuesdy	c
13th	c
,	c
June	c
,	c
2000	c

I	c
am	c
very	i
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
going	c
to	c
California	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
in	c
July	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
going	c
to	c
have	c
my	c
summer	c
holidays	c
in	c
that	c
month	c
.	c

About	c
accommodation	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
log	i
cabins	i
,	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
a	c
problem	c
in	i
my	c
back	c
.	c

Therefore	c
,	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
sleep	c
in	c
a	c
bed	c
.	c

Also	c
tents	c
are	c
not	c
fairly	i
comfortable	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
wondering	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
wear	c
in	c
California	c
?	c

In	c
addition	c

could	c
you	c
advice	i
me	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
need	c
for	c
the	c
trip	c
?	c
and	c
is	c
there	c
anything	c
else	c
do	i
I	c
have	c
to	c
know	c
?	c

I	c
went	c
to	c
Madrid	c
last	c
week	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
walking	c
in	c
the	c
street	c
when	c
somebody	c
asked	c
me	c
an	i
address	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
n't	c
believe	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
explained	c
to	c
him	c
where	c
was	i
the	i
street	i
that	c
he	c
was	c
looking	c
for	c
and	c
we	c
carried	c
out	i
with	c
the	c
conversation	c
for	c
a	c
while	c
.	c

Yeah	c
!	c

lot	c
of	c
activities	c

I	c
play	c
basketball	c
and	c
tennis	c
very	c
well	c
.	c

I	c
went	i
to	c
try	c
surfing	c
and	c
climbing	c
because	c
I	c
've	c
never	c
done	c
it	c

How	c
much	c
money	c
I	i
need	c
to	c

at	c
Camp	c
California	c
and	c
what	c
kind	c

Thank	c

I	c
'm	c

You	c
'd	c

how	c

the	i
Top-Pop	i
Concert	i
,	c
which	c
I	c
helped	c
to	c
organise	c
last	c
month	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
absolutlly	i
great	c
!	c

I	c
was	c
responsible	c
about	i
a	i
security	c
of	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
sectors	c
.	c

Although	c
I	c
worked	c
I	c
watched	c
the	c
concert	c
.	c

People	c
danced	c
,	c
screamed	c
and	c
sung	i
with	c
a	i
singer	c
.	c

OK	c

I	c
'd	c

stop	c
now	c
because	c
I	c
'm	c
going	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
a	i
library	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
so	c
suprise	i
to	c
hear	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
n't	c
believe	c
that	c
I	c
had	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
on	i
the	c
competition	c
.	c

Here	c
it	i

I	c
would	c
like	c
if	i
you	i
could	c
to	i
have	i
my	c
vacation	c
trip	i
on	i
July	c
because	c
is	i
the	c
only	c
time	c
of	c
the	c
year	c
that	c
my	c
job	i
could	i
let	c
me	c
have	c
a	c
vacation	c
.	c

As	c
for	c
the	c
accommodation	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
the	c
tent	c
because	c
it	c
is	i
my	i
first	c
time	c
that	c
I	i
'm	i
going	i
to	i
camping	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
see	c
how	i
the	i
real	i
life	i
is	i
.	c

I	c
was	c
so	c
thrilled	c
when	c
I	c
saw	c
that	c
I	c
could	c
do	c
some	c
activities	c
also	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
choose	c
swimming	c
and	c
the	i
climbing	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
a	c
very	c
good	c
swimmer	c
but	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
anything	c
about	c
climbing	i
that	i
's	i
why	c
I	c
choose	i
it	c
because	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
try	c
something	c
knew	i
.	c

That	c
is	c
all	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
making	c
my	c
dream	c
come	c
true	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

There	c
is	i
times	c
that	i
you	c
have	c
to	c
do	c
something	c
even	c
if	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
like	c
it	c
,	c
and	c
times	c
that	i
you	c
are	c
doing	c
what	c
you	c
like	c
but	c
not	c
the	i
time	c
you	c
like	i
it	i
.	c

What	c
I	c
'm	c
trying	c
to	c
say	c
is	c
that	c
I	c
like	c
to	c
shop	c
but	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
do	c
that	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
.	c

Nothing	c
in	c
life	c
is	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
even	i
the	c
things	c
we	c
enjoy	c
to	i
do	i
,	c
and	c
that	c
's	c
how	c
life	c
is	c
.	c

You	c
say	c
you	c
enjoy	c
shopping	c
I	i
understand	c
but	c
life	c
goes	c
on	i
you	i
ca	c
n't	c
do	c
the	c
same	c
things	c
every	c
day	c
.	c

You	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
to	c
be	c
bored	c
with	c
the	c
same	c
old	c
things	c
.	c

Because	c
as	c
I	c
said	c
to	i
do	i
what	c
you	c
like	c
is	c
good	c
only	c
if	c
you	c
do	c
it	c
when	c
you	c
like	c
it	i
and	c
how	c
you	c
like	c
it	i
and	c
remember	c
if	c
you	c
have	c
long	i
time	c
to	c
do	c
something	c
the	i
you	c
enjoy	c
it	c
more	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
really	c
greatful	i
when	c
I	c
recieved	i
your	c
letter	c
which	c
informed	c
me	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
make	c
this	c
trip	c
the	c
first	c
week	c
or	c
the	c
last	c
week	c
of	c
July	c
.	c

Unfortunetley	i
I	c
am	c
not	c
good	c
at	c
both	i
of	c
them	c
.	c

Could	c
you	c
tell	c
me	c
what	c
sort	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
would	c
need	c
to	c
bring	c
with	c
me	c
and	c
will	c
I	c
need	c
any	c
extra	c
money	c
for	c
this	c
holiday	c
.	i

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
where	c
to	c
start	c
but	c
I	c
can	c
say	c
it	c
was	c
the	c
greatest	i
time	c
I	c
have	c
ever	c
had	c
.	c

Next	c
day	c
when	i
I	c
went	c
there	c
I	i
have	i
met	i
lots	c
of	c
people	c
very	i
famous	c
and	c
very	c
friendly	c
.	c

It	c
took	c
us	c
almost	c
a	c
month	c
to	c
prepare	c
for	c
this	c
concert	c
.	c

the	i
stage	c
was	c
covered	c
with	c
all	c
sort	i
of	c
light	c
and	c
we	c
made	c
it	c
look	c
like	c
a	c
waterfall	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
lots	c
of	c
memory	i
which	c
I	c
could	c
never	c
forget	c
.	c

I	c
wish	c
you	c
were	c
there	c
.	c

With	c
attendance	i
to	c
the	c
annual	c
international	c
arts	c
festival	c
which	c
you	i
took	c
place	c
on	c
21	c
and	c
22th	i
November	c
2000	c
,	c
I	c
spend	i
tremendous	i
two	c
days	c
enjoying	c
some	c
features	i
.	c

Then	c
,	c
I	c
discovered	c
some	c
points	i
and	c
I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
express	i
my	c
suggestion	i
and	c
recommendations	c
.	c

Next	c
,	c
One	i
reasonably-priced	c
weekend	c
ticket	c
for	c
all	c
events	c
is	c
also	c
fantastic	i
idea	c
,	c
because	c
everyone	c
could	c
enjoy	c
everything	c
by	i
the	i
ticket	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
according	c
to	c
my	c
notes	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
some	c
doubt	i
in	i
the	c
festival	c
.	c

The	c
number	c
of	c
plays	c
and	c
films	c
were	i
also	c
very	c
few	i
.	c

In	c
addition	c
to	c
that	c
some	c
concert	c
halls	c
were	c
too	c
small	c
to	i
enjoy	c
the	c
concerts	c
.	c

I	c
also	c
suggest	c
that	c
more	c
plays	c
and	c
films	c
should	c
be	i
taken	i
place	i
.	c

Dear	c
Albert	c

Thanks	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
,	i
it	i
was	c
great	c
to	c
hear	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

I	c
know	c
you	c
're	c
fine	i
,	c
but	c
I	c
've	c
been	c
very	c
busy	c
studying	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
exam	i
next	c
month	c
.	c

So	c
this	c
is	c
quick	i
note	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
what	c
you	c
want	c
to	c
know	c
,	c
as	c
you	c
asked	c
about	c
school	c
rules	c
and	c
house	c
ones	c
.	c

At	c
school	c
,	c
the	c
most	c
horrible	c
one	c
is	c
school	i
uniform	c
.	c

I	c
really	c
hate	c
it	c
,	c
because	c
we	c
're	c
not	c
allowed	c
to	c
wear	c
casual	c
and	c
fashonable	i
clothes	c
,	c
colourful	c
shoes	c
and	i
colourful	c
socks	c
.	c

We	c
're	c
also	c
not	c
allowed	c
to	c
get	c
part-time	c
jobs	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
at	c
home	c
I	c
'm	c
quite	c
free	c
.	c

These	c
are	i
not	c
so	c
strict	c
that	c
I	c
can	i
stand	c
them	c
.	c

Write	c
soon	c
,	i
I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

According	i
to	i
your	c
letter	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
infrom	i
you	c
about	i
the	c
information	c
you	c
need	c
to	c
know	c
for	i
my	c
trip	i
two	c
weeks	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
in	c
the	c
U.S.A	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
excited	c
and	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
the	c
new	c
experiance	i
I	c
am	c
going	c
to	c
have	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
tents	c
because	c
I	c
love	c
atmosephere	i
of	c
camping	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
would	c
n't	c
mind	c
to	i
stay	i
in	c
log	c
cabins	c
.	c

For	c
the	c
two	c
activities	c
I	c
can	c
choose	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
have	i
swimming	c
and	c
Basketball	c
.	c

I	c
first	c
started	c
playing	c
basketball	c
and	c
swimming	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
aged	c
9	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
doing	c
it	i
up	c
till	c
now	c
.	c

I	c
also	i
used	i
to	i
be	i
in	c
a	c
basketball	c
team	c
in	c
school	c
for	c
3	c
years	c
.	c

One	c
thing	c
,	i
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
is	c
how	c
many	c
clothes	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
with	c
me	c
and	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
cloth	i
they	c
are	c
?	i

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c

Vanida	c
Montri	c

It	c
is	c
base	i
on	c
information	c
made	c
availble	i
by	c
student	i
from	c
each	c
class	c
at	c
school	c
.	c

Most	c
student	i
who	c
were	c
interviewed	c
suggested	c
to	i
have	i
a	c
speaking	c
part	c
of	i
the	c
lesson	c
to	i
be	c
on	c
film	c
.	c

It	c
seemed	c
to	c
be	c
the	c
most	c
interesting	c
lesson	c
,	c
because	c
student	i
always	c
make	c
some	c
mistake	i
while	c
they	c
are	c
practising	c
with	c
thier	i
partner	c
,	c
in	c
spite	c
of	c
having	i
told	i
from	i
teacher	i
ten	c
times	c
.	c

It	c
felt	i
to	c
be	c
a	c
good	c
memory	c
to	c
be	c
remember	i
and	c
remind	i
our	i
sleves	i
to	c
speak	c
in	c
a	c
correct	c
way	c
.	c

This	c
lesson	c
will	c
give	i
us	c
to	c
be	c
relaxed	c
and	c
have	c
laugh	i
.	c

Lesson	i
and	c
activities	c
,	i
which	c
most	c
student	i
suggested	c
are	c
very	c
interesting	c
and	c
it	i
is	i
not	c
seem	c
to	c
be	c
boring	c
for	c
the	c
student	i
.	c

I	c
learnt	c
from	c
you	i
letter	c
that	c
I	c
've	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
.	c

I	c
felt	i
how	i
luck	i
I	i
was	i
.	c

I	c
understood	i
you	c
want	c
to	c
know	c
when	c
am	i
I	i
available	c
to	c
set	c
off	c
and	c
where	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
stay	c
.	c

I	c
'd	c
prefer	c
staying	i
in	c
log	i
cabins	i
because	c
I	c
need	c
a	c
proper	c
place	c
to	c
say	i
and	c
study	c
.	i

I	c
used	c
to	c
climb	c
mountains	c
and	c
am	c
good	c
at	c
climbing	c
.	c

I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
some	c
questions	c
which	i
I	c
want	c
to	c
know	c
.	c

Do	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
bring	c
any	c
special	c
clothes	c
?	c

Do	c
you	c
have	c
any	c
idea	c
what	c
is	i
the	i
weather	i
going	c
to	c
be	c
?	i

I	c
look	c

Dear	c

How	c

How	c

I	c

each	c
other	c
's	c

Last	c
month	c
I	c
helped	c
the	c
service	c
crew	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
unbelievable	c
and	i
tiring	c
as	c
well	c
.	c

I	c
heard	c
them	c
talking	c
behind	i
the	i
stage	i
.	c

They	c
signed	c
my	c
diary	c
and	c
took	i
a	i
photo	i
with	c
me	c
.	c

Being	c
a	c
security	c
guard	c
was	c
the	c
hardest	c
task	c
.	c

Especially	i
I	i
liked	c
that	c
time	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c

Yours	c

Dear	c

to	c
know	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
such	c
amazing	i
prize	c
in	c
your	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
at	i
log	i
cabins	i
rather	c
than	c
tents	i
.	c

I	c
love	c
swimming	c
and	c
also	c
I	c
should	c
say	c
that	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
this	c
sport	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
doing	c
that	i
for	c
long	i
time	c
.	c

Could	c
I	c
need	c
some	c
extra	c
money	c
?	c

Do	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
bring	c
something	i
else	c
?	c

If	c
is	i
so	c
,	c
please	c
let	c
me	c
know	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

My	c
job	c
it	i
was	c
to	c
accomodate	i
to	i
the	i
people	i
of	i
the	i
main	i
sit	i
of	i
the	i
theathre	i
.	c

At	c
first	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
bit	c
scare	i
,	c
I	c
mean	c
I	i
was	c
afraid	c
not	i
be	i
good	c
enough	c
to	c
have	i
a	i
good	i
performance	i
as	c
assistant	i
;	c
but	c
finally	c
every	i
thing	i
went	c
well	c
.	c

I	c
should	c
say	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
the	c
easiest	c
and	c
more	i
interesting	c
job	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
ever	c
done	c
.	c

I	c
really	c
enjoyed	c
it	c
and	c
also	c
I	c
did	c
not	c
miss	c
the	c
opportunity	c
to	c
ask	c
the	c
artist	c
to	c
take	i
a	i
photho	i
with	c
me	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
I	c
hope	c
to	c
see	c
you	c
earliest	i
to	c
show	c
all	i
my	c
phothos	i
.	c

Looking	c
forward	c
to	c
getting	c
your	c
reply	c
and	c
to	c
seeing	c
you	c
soon	c

lots	c
of	c
love	c

In	c
addition	c
to	c
this	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
instead	c
19:30	i
,	c
more	c
45	i
minutes	c
in	i
late	c
...	c

Moreover	c
,	c
there	c
were	c
n't	c
discounts	i
available	c
like	i
writting	i
in	c
your	c
advertisement	c
.	c

There	c
was	c
well	i
a	c
restaurant	c
,	c
even	i
though	c
,	i
it	c
was	c
closed	c
for	c
reparations	i
,	c
also	i
2	c
hours	c
30	c
without	c
drinking	c
or	c
eating	c
something	c
,	i
was	c
quite	c
difficult	c
for	c
the	c
children	c
.	c

It	c
should	c
be	i
a	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
the	c
opposite	c
.	c

It	i
's	i
why	c
,	c
it	i
would	c
be	c
grateful	c
,	i
if	c
you	c
could	c
give	c
me	c
my	c
money	c
back	c

How	c
has	c
modern	c
technology	c
changed	c
your	c
daily	c
life	c
?	c

Nowadays	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
could	i
be	c
impossible	c
for	c
us	c
to	c
live	c
like	c
our	c
grand-parents	i
or	c
great	i
grand-parents	i
lived	c
...	c
we	c
are	c
too	c
lazy	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
's	c
not	c
our	c
mistake	i
,	c
this	c
revolution	c
is	c
called	c
"	c
progress	c
"	c
!	c

It	c
seem	i
be	i
incredible	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
's	c
commun	i
habits	i
for	c
us.	c
.	c

we	c
do	c
n't	c
think	c
that	c
there	i
is	i
less	c
of	i
a	c
hundred	c
years	c
,	i
nothing	i
of	c
that	c
existed	c
.	c

I	c
will	c
always	c
said	i
thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
to	c
the	c
inventor	c
who	c
has	c
invented	c
the	c
maschines	i
wich	i
make	i
the	c
washing	c
and	c
the	c
washing-up	c
,	c
before	c
this	c
,	c
the	i
women	c
spent	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
had	i
done	i
this	i
tasks	c
.	c

And	c
it	i
's	i
not	i
ending	i
,	i
I	c
hope	c
that	c
for	i
my	c
thirties	c
I	c
'll	c
go	c
to	c
Mars	c
on	c
holidays	i

The	c
scientists	c
are	i
again	i
ten	c

the	c
solution	c

Dear	c
Miss	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
suggest	c
some	c
idea	i
for	c
the	c
International	c
Art	i
Festival	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
the	c
festival	c
was	c
a	c
great	c
idea	c
.	c

There	c
were	c
a	c
number	c
of	c
stars	c
and	c
artists	c
from	c
around	c
the	c
world	c
,	c
but	c
from	i
only	i
six	c
countries	c
.	c

We	c
would	c
be	c
pleased	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
have	c
more	c
.	c

Fourthly	c
,	c
everyone	c
seems	c
to	c
have	c
enjoyed	c
seeing	c
dance	i
shows	c
and	c
the	c
art	c
exhibitions	c
and	c
listening	c
to	c
the	c
talks	c
.	c

Lastly	c
,	c
the	c
weekend	c
ticket	c
was	c
excellent	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
quite	c
reasonable	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sharyl	c
,	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

It	c
does	c
n't	c
bother	i
studying	c
,	c
does	c
it	c
?	c

And	c
also	c
we	c
're	c
not	c
allowed	c
to	c
bring	c
any	c
sweets	c
.	c

I	c
know	c
some	c
rules	c
are	c
necessary	c
to	c
control	c
the	c
students	c
.	c

And	c
the	c
advantage	c
of	c
this	c
is	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
need	c
to	c
think	c
about	c
what	c
to	c
put	c
on	c
every	c
morning	c
!	c

I	c
want	c
to	c
go	c
dancing	c
sometimes	c
.	c

That	c
's	c
wonderful	c
!	c

Take	c
care	c
.	c

Love	c

June	c
2000	c

I	c
am	c
delighted	c
that	c
finally	i
,	i
I	i
have	i
won	c
the	i
first	c
prise	i
in	c
your	c
Competition	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
only	c
in	c
June	c
because	c
I	c
will	c
start	c
working	c
in	c
July	c
that	i
means	c
I	c
will	c
not	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
come	c
there	c
later	i
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
rather	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
than	c
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
because	c
I	c
always	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
when	c
I	c
am	c
on	c
holidays	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
not	c
comfortable	c
but	c
it	i
still	c
like	c
it	c
.	c

Could	c
you	c
please	c
tell	c
me	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
bring	c
with	c
me	c
?	c
(	c
like.	c
.	c

specific	c
equipment	c
or	c
anything	c
else	c
)	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forwards	i
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

Is	c
it	c
true	c
or	c
not	c
?	c

There	c
are	c
new	c
products	c
which	c
you	c
could	c
not	c
imagine	c
that	i
could	c
be	c
so	c
interesting	c
.	c

for	i
example	c
if	c
you	c
are	c
a	c
working	c
mother	c
with	c
three	c
children	c
,	c
that	i
means	c
you	c
are	c
always	c
n	i
a	c
hurry	c
,	c
going	c
shopping	c
is	c
really	c
unenjoyable	c
.	c

You	c
go	i
shopping	i
in	c
a	c
big	c
supermarket	c
because	c
you	c
know	c
you	c
will	c
find	c
everything	c
there	c
and	c
you	c
need	c
15	c
minutes	c
to	c
find	c
the	c
goods	c
and	c
20	c
minutes	c
to	c
pay	c
for	c
them	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
big	c
queue	c
.	c

You	c
need	c
to	c
buy	c
essential	c
items	c
like	c
food	c
and	c
you	c
get	c
tired	c
because	c
it	c
very	i
crowded	c
and	c
you	c
spend	c
more	c
time	c
thank	i
you	c
prefer	i
to	c
.	c

You	c
should	c
avoid	c
the	c
peak	c
times	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
which	c
said	c
I	c
had	i
won	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
afraid	c
I	c
can	c
only	c
make	c
it	c
on	i
July	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
taking	c
exams	c
this	c
month	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
I	c
'll	c
prepare	c
everything	c
for	c
going	c
to	c
University	c
on	i
August	c
.	c

The	c
accommodation	c
I	c
prefer	c
is	c
tent	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
how	c
interesting	c
it	c
is	c
to	c
live	c
in	c
tents	c
.	c

If	c
I	c
can	c
only	c
choose	c
two	c
activities	c
while	c
I	c
am	c
at	c
the	c
Camp	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
climbing	c
and	c
Basketball	c

About	c
the	i
Basketball	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
played	i
it	c
for	c
seven	c
years	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
play	c
basketball	c
with	c
local	c
people	c
at	c
the	c
Camp	c
to	c
see	c
how	c
good	c
they	c
are	c
,	c
if	c
I	c
can	c
.	c

Would	i
you	c
give	c
me	c
some	c
pocket-money	c
during	c
the	c
trip	c
.	i

Also	c
,	c
may	c
I	c
take	c
a	c
friend	c
with	c
me	c
,	i
how	i
much	c
will	i
she	c
pay	c

Subject	c
:	c
a	c
short	c
video	c
about	c
daily	c

I	c
found	c
that	c
most	c
of	c

had	i
suggested	i
that	c
four	c

should	c
be	c

In	c
Conclusion	c
,	c
the	c
short	c
video	c
is	c
only	c
60	c

I	c
've	c
never	c

before	c
so	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
'll	c
be	c
an	c
exciting	c
trip	c

I	c
've	c
practised	i

since	c
an	c
early	c
age	c
and	c
I	c
perfectly	i
manage	i
the	i

I	c

I	c
'm	c
a	c
shopaholic	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
admit	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

My	c
friends	c
lent	c
me	c
some	c
money	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
more	c
than	c
120	c
pounds	c
.	c

I	c
felt	c
really	c
bad	c
seeing	c
my	c
friends	c
buy	c
the	c
latest	c
fashion	c
while	c
the	c
only	c
thing	c
I	c
could	c
do	c
was	c
tell	c
them	c
how	c
great	c
their	c
clothes	c
were	c
and	c
of	c

window-shop	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Ryan	c

I	c
have	c
just	c
received	c
your	c
letter	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
really	c
delighted	c
and	c
thrilled	c
to	c
win	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
.	c

For	c
the	c
trip	c
to	c
California	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
only	c
go	c
in	c
July	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
afraid	c
,	c
because	c
my	c
English	c
course	c
finishes	c
in	c
June	c
and	c
it	c
starts	c
again	c
in	c
August	c
.	c

In	c
your	c
letter	c
you	c
mentioned	c
that	c
I	c
could	c
choose	c
between	c
sleeping	c
in	c
tents	c
or	c
log	i
cabin	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
sleep	c
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
please	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
take	c
part	c
in	c
surfing	c
and	c
swimming	c
please	c
.	c

Although	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
done	c
surfing	c
before	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
quite	c
advanced	c
swimmer	c
.	c

Finally	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
some	c
questions	c
.	c

What	c
is	c
the	c
weather	c
like	c
over	c
there	c
and	c
what	c
should	c
I	c
wear	c
?	c

How	c
much	c
money	c
would	c
I	c
need	c
?	c

How	c
big	c
is	c
the	c
camp	c
?	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerly	i

The	c
feeling	c
of	c
buying	c
new	c
things	c
is	c
wonderful	c
.	c

We	c
all	c
go	c
shopping	c
,	c
maybe	c
not	c
every	c
day	c
,	c
but	c
certainly	c
at	c
least	c
once	c
a	c
week	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
food	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
buying	c
things	c
needed	c
and	c
planned	c
could	c
be	c
enjoyable	c
but	c
buying	c
things	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
need	c
or	c
unplanned	c
,	c
might	c
make	c
you	c
feel	c
sad	c
after	c
sometime	i
.	c

It	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
pleasure	c
to	c
us	c
and	c
to	c
your	c
husband	c
to	c
come	c
at	i
the	c
party	c
.	c

We	c
would	c
like	c
you	c
to	c
come	c
and	c
if	i
you	c
can	c
to	i
help	c
us	c
in	i
an	c
important	c
decision	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
the	c
party	c
will	c
take	c
place	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
16th	c
of	c
June	c
at	i
College	i
Canteen	i
.	c

We	c
think	c
the	i
suitable	c
time	c
will	c
be	c
3-6	c
p.m.	c
You	c
can	c
come	c
earlier	c
,	c
if	c
you	c
want	c
.	c

On	i
the	i
other	i
hand	i
,	c
we	c
do	c
not	c
know	c
what	c
to	c
give	c
him	c
as	c
a	c
present	c
.	c

Can	c
you	c
help	c
us	c
?	c

We	c
want	c
something	c
that	c
it	i
would	i
like	i
him	i
or	c
would	i
be	c
necessary	c
.	c

Please	c
try	c
to	c
come	c
and	c
help	c
us	c
to	i
this	c
problem	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

John	c

some	c

and	c
we	c
were	c
waiting	c
for	c
the	c

The	c
first	c
good	c
new	i
was	c
that	c
we	c
both	c
had	c
passed	c
the	c
exams	c

He	c
would	c
earn	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
money	c
,	c
in	c

they	c
wanted	c
an	i
another	c
person	c

We	c
had	c
the	c
greatest	c
day	c

At	c
the	c
end	c
of	c

we	c
are	c
planning	c
to	c

I	c
'm	c
fine	c

I	c
really	c
like	i
to	c

you	c
all	c
my	i
experience	c

In	c

it	c
was	c

nine	c

the	c
different	c
spot	c
and	c
houndreds	i
of	c
Coblights	c
on	i
the	c
right	c
place	c

We	c
spent	c
hours	c
till	i
it	c
was	c
good	c
enough	c
for	c
the	c
Technical-manger	i

Moreover	c

about	i
this	c

For	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

As	c
you	c
asked	c
me	c
some	c
questions	c
,	c
here	c
are	c
the	c
answers	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
agree	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
tent	c
as	i
accommodation	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
stayed	c
in	c
one	c
and	c
I	c
wonder	c
this	i
might	c
be	c
a	c
great	c
feeling	c
and	c
that	i
this	c
way	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
in	c
a	i
deeper	i
contact	c
with	c
the	c
animals	c
that	c
live	c
in	c
the	c
area	c
.	c

Surfing	c
would	c
be	c
another	c
good	c
option	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
stepped	c
on	c
a	c
surfboard	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
this	c
is	c
a	c
beautiful	c
sport	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
butterflies	i
of	i
excitement	i
and	c
I'am	i
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c
.	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

Some	c
people	c
usually	c
spend	c
more	c
money	c
than	c
they	c
have	c
and	c
end	c
up	c
broken	i
,	c
with	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
bills	c
to	c
pay	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
if	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
those	c
spending	c
sprees	c
very	c
often	c
,	c
shopping	c
can	c
be	c
a	c
pleasant	c
experience	c
and	c
a	c
chance	c
to	c
spend	c
some	c
quality	c
time	c
with	c
your	c
family	c
.	c

Going	c
to	c
the	c
shopping	c
centre	c
with	c
you	i
family	c
can	c
be	c
a	c
good	c
experience	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
a	c
moment	c
in	c
that	i
you	c
can	c
talk	c
to	c
your	c
relatives	c
and	c
use	c
this	c
conversation	c
to	c
know	i
more	c
about	c
yourselves	c
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
if	c
you	c
go	c
shopping	c
reasonably	c
,	c
have	c
a	c
good	c
time	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c

about	c
the	c

which	i
I	c
saw	c
at	c
your	c

as	c
a	c

At	c
the	c

I	c
also	c
asked	c
for	c
a	c

they	c

this	c
was	c

possible	c

instead	i
your	c

said	i
clearly	i
there	c
were	c

I	c
look	c

to	c

Paul	c
could	c
n't	c
put	c
up	c
anymore	c
with	c
Pat	c
always	c
revealing	c
his	c
secrets	c
,	c
so	c
decided	i
to	c
play	c
a	c
trick	c
on	c
him	c
.	c

Since	c
Paul	c
ran	c
a	c
very	c
popular	c
hotel	c
in	c
London	c
,	c
he	c
told	c
Pat	c
that	c
on	c
Sunday	c
the	c
superstar	c
Madonna	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
be	c
staying	c
there	c
with	c
her	c
new	c
misterious	i
lover	c
.	c

Paul	c
told	c
Pat	c
not	c
to	c
tell	c
anyone	c
about	c
Madonna	c
and	c
especially	c
to	i
the	c
press	c
.	c

My	c
name	c
is	c
Manuel	c
Olmez	c
and	c
last	c
week	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
'	c
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
'	c
to	i
the	c
Circle	c
theatre	c
.	c

Everything	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
wrong	i
.	c

The	c
actors	c
I	c
saw	c
in	c
the	c
show	c
were	c
not	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
.	c

I	c
went	c
at	c
19.30	c
and	c
the	c
show	c
did	c
n't	c
begin	c
until	c
20:15	c
so	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
wait	c
a	c
lot	c
and	c
I	c
arrived	c
late	c
to	c
a	c
meeting	c
I	c
had	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

So	c
in	c
very	i
few	c
days	c
all	c
the	c
College	c
knew	c
that	c
me	c
and	c
my	c
friends	c
were	c
who	i
had	c
crashed	c
headmaster	i
's	c
car	c
.	c

We	c
put	c
him	c
in	c
my	c
car	c
and	c
we	c
left	c
him	c
inside	c
a	c
closed	c
room	c
.	c

When	c
he	c
woke	c
up	c
he	c
started	c
shouting	c
and	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
make	i
him	i
calm	i
.	c

He	c
accepted	c
and	i
we	c
left	i
him	c
free	i
.	c

We	c
need	i
to	c
do	c
something	c
like	c
that	c
to	c
make	c
him	c
change	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
,	c

Thank	c

much	c

Accommodation	i

Tents	c
are	c
very	c
easy	c
to	c
take	i
and	c
go	i
everywhere	c
.	c

What	c
's	c
more	c
,	c
in	c
my	c
opinion	c
it	i
is	i
very	c
romantic	c

I	c

good	c
at	c

and	c
photography	c

I	c
like	c

In	c

Conclusion	c
:	c

Dear	c
Manager	c
,	c

I	c
'm	c
Francesco	c
Schein	c
,	c
I	c
'm	c
18	c
years	c
old	c
and	c
I	c
went	c
last	c
week	c
to	c
see	c
your	c
musical	c
show	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
upset	c
because	c
the	c
show	c
had	c
many	c
problems	c
.	c

Then	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
began	c
45	c
minutes	c
later	i
,	c
so	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
wait	c
very	i
long	c
.	i

The	c
advertisement	c
said	c
there	c
were	c
discounts	c
available	c
,	c
which	c
were	c
not	c
.	i

I	c
hope	c
you	c
understand	c
your	c
faults	i
and	c
I	c
'm	c
asking	c
you	c
for	c
the	i
money	c
back	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
if	c
technology	c
has	c
totally	c
changed	c
my	c
life	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
was	c
born	c
with	c
it	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
learned	c
it	i
since	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
little	c
boy	c
.	c

Many	c
industries	c
throw	c
their	c
contaminated	c
air	c
away	c
,	c
without	c
cleaning	c
it	c
before	i
.	c

Technology	c
has	c
to	c
move	c
further	c
so	c
it	c
can	c
solve	c
problems	c
as	i
pollution	c
,	c
so	c
we	c
can	c
live	c
better	c
and	c
longer	c
.	c

Dear	c
Helen	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
surprised	c
for	i
have	i
received	c
your	c
letter	c
in	c
which	c
you	c
explained	c
to	c
me	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
won	c

your	c
competition	c
.	c

After	c
that	c
,	c
I	c
would	c

to	c
say	c
Thanks	c
,	c
I	c
never	i
have	i

In	c
reference	c
about	i
the	c
date	c
of	c
the	i
travel	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c

I	c
am	c

at	c
the	i
University	c
and	c
I	c
only	c
have	c
July	c
to	c
take	c
my	c
holidays	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c

because	c
since	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
child	c
I	c

this	c
type	c

I	c
used	c
to	c
go	c
to	i
campings	i
.	c

I	c
have	c
choosen	i
these	c
activities	c
because	c
actually	i
I	c
am	c
playing	c
with	i
university	i
team	c
,	c
and	c
photography	c
is	c
my	c
favoorate	i
hobby	c

I	c
have	c
recently	c
bought	c
a	c
new	c

Finally	c
let	c
me	c
know	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
will	c
be	c
the	c
most	c
suitable	c
at	c

.	c

Is	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c

I	c
am	c
writen	i
to	c
you	c
telling	i
about	i
my	c
experience	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
.	c

It	c
began	c
when	c
ours	i
common	i
friends	i
Martha	c
,	i
ofered	i
me	c
to	i
be	i
a	i
organization	i
member	i
at	i
the	c
concert	c
,	i
obviously	i
I	c
accepted	c
.	c

The	c
following	c
day	c
I	c
was	c
the	c
person	c
who	c
provide	i
the	c
meals	c
for	c
all	c
the	c
organization	i
staff	c
and	c
besides	i
every	c
day	c
I	c
was	c
at	i
the	i
back-stage	i
supporting	c
the	c
catering	c
staff	c
.	c

Particularly	i
I	i
am	i
pleased	c

popular	c

stars	c
in	c
the	c
world	c

Hopping	i
to	c
hear	c
from	c
you	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
see	c
last	c
Wednesday	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
told	c
I	c
would	c
have	c
the	c
most	c
perfect	c
evening	c
in	c
London	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
bought	c
my	c
ticket	c
I	c
expected	c
to	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
take	c
advantage	c
of	c
those	c
discounts	c
you	c
announced	c
in	c
the	c
newspaper	c
advertisement	c
but	c
when	i
I	c
had	c
to	c
pay	c
the	c
most	c
expensive	c
price	c
.	c

I	c
went	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
performance	i
at	i
19:30	i
but	c
it	c
did	c
not	c
start	c
until	c
20:15	c
!	c

At	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
the	c
show	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
but	c
when	c
I	c
arrived	c
I	c
realized	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
the	c
musical	i
show	c
had	c
finished	c
too	c
late	c
!	c

All	c
I	c
am	c
asking	c
for	c
is	c
a	c
full	c
refund	c
of	c
the	c
money	c
I	c
spent	c
in	i
the	c
musical	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

Some	c
days	c
ago	c
Pat	c
met	c
her	c
friend	c
Paul	c
,	c
the	c
editor	c
of	c
the	c
school	c
's	c
newspaper	c
.	c

Paul	c
asked	c
her	c
some	c
questions	c
about	c
her	c
childhood	c
and	c
her	c
toys	c
because	c
he	c
was	c
going	c
to	c
write	c
an	c
article	c
about	c
children	c
.	c

While	c
Pat	c
was	c
talking	c
she	c
remembered	c
playing	c
with	c
her	c
dolls	c
and	c
spending	i
a	c
good	c
time	c
with	c
them	c
.	c

Then	c
Paul	c
asked	c
her	c
if	c
she	c
knew	c
something	c
about	c
Marion	c
's	c
childhood	c
.	c

Pat	c
told	c
him	c
some	c
unimportant	c
things	c
such	c
as	c
she	c
learnt	c
to	c
swim	c
at	c
the	c
age	c
of	c
five	c
or	c
that	c
she	c
loved	c
ants	c
.	c

She	c
told	c
Paul	c
she	c
had	c
a	c
special	c
toy	c
called	c
Max	c
and	c
that	c
she	c
slept	c
with	c
him	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
following	c
edition	c
the	c
headline	c
was	c
:	c
"	c
Why	c
a	i
teenager	c
sleeps	i
with	c
a	c
toy	c
called	c
Max	c
?	c
"	c

Everybody	c
laughted	i
at	c
her	c
.	c

They	c
became	c
friends	c
again	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
only	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
I	c
will	c
take	i
some	c
hollydays	i
at	c
this	i
time	c
.	c

.	c

I	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
log	c
cabins	c
than	i
in	c
tentes	i
,	c
because	c
log	c
cabins	c
has	i
much	i
esctructure	i
,	c
that	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
stay	c
for	c
a	c
few	c
days	c
.	c

last	c
year	c
.	c

The	c
students	c
at	c
school	c
shoud	c
n't	c
be	c
shy	c
,	c
because	c
they	i
have	i
estercotipie	i
inside	i
in	i
some	i
issues	i
,	i
that	i
confuses	i
them	i
the	i
means	i

When	c
you	c
are	c
ready	c
to	c
shopp	i
,	c
some	i
times	i
you	c
know	c
before	i
what	c
is	c
your	c
priority	c
to	i
buy	i
,	c
because	c
probaly	i
you	c
need	c
one	c
thing	c
than	i
others	i

But	c
the	c
best	c
thing	c
that	c
we	c
do	c
,	c
when	c
we	c
make	i
shopp	i
is	c
spend	c
the	i
time	c
having	c
lunch	c
at	c
snack	i
bar	c
,	c
watching	c
cinema	i
and	c
play	i
games	i

Last	c
month	c

I	c
work	i
like	i
roadie	i
at	c
Rolling	i

Pop	i
Concert	i

I	c
was	c
responsable	i
of	i

Now	c

I	c
have	c

Dear	c

I	c
was	c

that	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
the	c
first	c

in	c
your	c

and	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
a	c
good	c
opportunity	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
U.S.A	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
sleep	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
,	c
because	c
,	c
in	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
easier	c
to	c
make	c
friends	c
and	c
I	c
like	c
camping	c
as	c
well	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
chosen	c
photography	c
and	c
climbing	c
for	i
activities	i

I	c
am	c
a	c
beginner	c
in	c
photography	c
but	c
I	c
am	c
really	c
interested	c

Can	c
you	c
tell	c
me	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
take	c

if	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
winter	c
clothes	c
and	c
if	c
it	c
is	c
possible	c
to	c
rent	c
a	c

Thank	c
you	c

this	c
opportunity	c

Some	c
people	c
when	c
they	c
are	c
tired	c
relax	c
spleeping	i
,	c
reading	c
a	c
book	c
or	c
watching	c
television	c
but	i
not	c
me	c

There	c
were	i
always	c
,	c
at	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
the	c
afternoon	c
,	c
some	c
well-dressed	c
women	c
coming	c
from	c
their	c
offices	c
and	c
they	c
just	c
spent	i
one	c
hour	c
in	c
the	c
shop	c
whithout	i
buying	c
anything	c

In	c
these	c
periods	c
of	c
the	c
year	c
,	c
the	c
supermarkets	c
and	c
the	c
shops	c
are	c
full	c
of	c
stressed	c
adults	c
and	c
tired	c
children	c
trying	i
to	i
walk	i
in	c
a	c
warm	i
and	c
noisy	c
place	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

I	c
did	c
not	c
expect	c
to	i
find	i
all	c
the	c
problems	c
that	c
I	c
had	c
.	c

After	c
the	c
musical	i
show	c
,	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
but	c
I	c
could	c
not	c
have	i
had	i
dinner	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

I	c
think	c
when	c
you	c
explain	i
a	c
secret	c
you	c
must	c
be	c
sure	c
that	c
you	c
have	c
chose	i
the	c
best	c
person	c
to	c
keep	c
it	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
child	c
my	c
friends	c
were	c
my	c
companions	i
of	i
class	i
and	i
,	c
especially	c
my	c
neighbours	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
was	c
fourteen	c
years	c
old	c
some	c
things	c
changed	c
.	c

But	c
,	c
until	c
you	c
are	c

Dear	c
Manager	c
,	c

I	c
found	c
the	c
advertisement	c
about	c
this	c
show	c
in	c
a	c
newspaper	c
and	c
thought	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
fun	c
.	c

But	c
,	c
instead	c
there	c
was	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
,	c
who	c
I	c
never	i
heard	i
about	i
before	c
!	c

The	c
show	c
should	c
start	i
at	c
19.30	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
did	c
n't	c
start	c
until	c
20.15	c
!	c

So	c
,	c
because	c
of	c
that	c
,	c
I	c
missed	c
my	c
last	c
bus	c
home	c
!	c

In	i
fact	i
,	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
the	c
whole	c
evening	c
,	c
because	c
of	c
some	c
work	c
.	i

As	c
I	c
'm	c
a	c
student	c
,	c
I	c
usually	c
get	c
discounts	c
on	c
different	i
things	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
was	c
so	c
disappointed	c
when	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
get	c
it	i
here	i
!	c

yours	c
sincerely	c

Karol	c
Johannes	c

How	c
has	c
modern	c
technology	c
changed	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
?	c

What	c
I	c
'm	c
talking	c
about	c
are	c
the	c
computer	i
,	c
which	c
now	c
can	c
be	c
found	c
in	c
almost	c
every	c
home	c
and	i
of	i
course	c
,	c
the	c
mobile	c
phone	c
!	c

I	c
tought	i
I	c
would	c
never	c
need	c
a	c
mobile	c
phone	c
,	c
but	c
my	c
mum	c
and	c
dad	c
gave	c
me	c
one	c
for	c
Christmas	c
last	c
year	c
and	c
now	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
live	c
without	c
it	c
!	c

But	c
the	c
discovery	i
that	c
I	c
'm	c
most	c
thankful	c
to	i
is	c
the	c
computor	i
and	c
the	c
Internet	c
!	c

Thanks	c
to	c
it	i
,	c
I	c
can	c
easy	i
communicate	c
with	c
my	c
family	c
and	c
friends	c
at	c
home	c
when	c
I	c
'm	c
here	c
in	c
England	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
so	c
quick	c
and	c
not	c
too	c
expensive	c
either	c
.	c

To	c
use	c
the	c
mobile	c
phone	c
by	i
the	c
way	c
,	c
is	c
very	c
expensive	c
.	c

I	c
usually	c
use	c
it	c
for	c
sending	c
SMS	c
Messages	c
to	c
my	c
friends	c
.	c

Last	c
month	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
with	c
my	c
husband	c
to	c
see	c
OVER	c
THE	c
RAINBOW	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
the	c
play	c
started	c
45	c
minutes	c
later	i
.	c

I	c
felt	c
so	c
angry	c
about	c
that	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
the	c
actor	c
was	c
n't	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
.	c

I	c
wanted	c
to	c
see	c
him	c
!	c

He	c
is	c
a	c
good	c
actor	c
but	c
I	c
saw	c
a	c
very	c
bad	c
one	c
.	c

Such	c
a	c
bad	c
night	c
!	c

If	c
you	c
could	i
n't	i
do	c
that	c
,	c
we	c
will	c
accept	c
to	i
go	c
to	c
another	c
play	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

And	c
Lorca	c
knew	c
it	c
.	c

Let	c
me	c
explain	c
it	c
.	c

In	c
1874	c
Lorca	c
was	c
the	c
most	c
beautiful	c
white	c
girl	c
in	c
her	c
city	c
(	c
a	c
small	c
town	c
near	c
Savannah	c
)	c
.	c

Her	c
family	c
was	c
very	c
rich	c
and	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
men	c
wanted	c
to	c
marry	c
to	c
her	c
.	c

In	c
few	i
hours	c
everyone	c
knew	c
it	c
.	c

Then	c
,	c
she	c
cried	c
and	c
cried	c
holding	i
him	c
.	c

(	c
If	c
she	c
had	c
n't	c
do	i
it	c
,	c
Lorca	c
's	c
father	c
would	c
had	i
made	i
the	c
same	c
)	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
shock	c
for	c
Lorca	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs.	c
Ryan	c
:	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
suitable	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
only	c
,	c
because	c
that	c
is	c
when	c
I	c
am	c
on	c
holiday	c
from	c
work	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
golf	c
and	c
surfing	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
n't	c
played	c
golf	c
for	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
,	c
so	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
pleasent	i
to	c
do	c
so	c
.	c

About	c
surfing	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
an	c
amateur	c
at	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
been	c
surfing	c
for	c
five	c
years	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
competed	c
in	c
two	c
championships	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
would	c
you	c
recommend	c
me	i
to	i
take	i
.	c

Also	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
if	c
I	c
will	c
need	c
any	c
money	c
there	c
.	c

Hi	c
!	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
about	c
my	c
experience	c
at	c
the	c
concert	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
start	c
at	c
ten	c
,	c
but	c
when	c
the	c
band	c
was	c
going	c
on	c
stage	c
,	c
the	c
leader	i
of	i
it	i
fell	c
down	c
on	c
some	c
wires	c
that	c
gave	c
the	c
power	c
to	c
all	c
the	c
instruments	c
and	c
all	c
the	c
lights	c
!	c

Suddenly	c
,	c
everything	c
got	c
very	c
dark	c
.	c

I	c
happened	c
to	c
be	c
near	c
him	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
help	c
him	c
.	c

What	c
I	c
liked	c
was	c
that	c
I	c
had	c
the	c
chance	c
to	c
help	c
my	c
idol	c
and	c
to	c
talk	c
to	c
him	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
regarding	c
to	i
our	c
visit	c
to	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
the	i
17th	c
June	c
.	c

There	c
was	i
in	c
our	c
opinion	c
two	c
reasons	c
for	c
that	c
,	c
our	c
favourite	c
actor	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
the	c
opportunity	c
to	c
visit	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
afterwords	i
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
was	c
not	c
acting	c
,	c
there	c
was	c
another	c
unknown	i
actor	c
and	c
he	c
was	c
not	c
good	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
start	c
19.30	i
,	c
but	c
did	c
not	c
start	c
until	c
20.15	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
therefore	c
asking	c
for	c
a	i
compensation	c
for	c
our	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
and	c
hope	c
we	c
can	c
reach	c
a	c
sollution	i
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerelly	i

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

However	c
I	i
was	c
n't	c
sure	c
if	c
my	c
decision	c
was	c
right	c
and	c
therefore	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
discuss	c
it	c
with	c
Pat	c
.	c

I	c
really	c
like	c
Pat	c
,	c
she	c
's	c
funny	c
,	c
has	c
a	c
good	c
sence	i
of	c
humor	i
and	c
like	c
me	c
she	c
loves	c
to	c
discuss	c
everything	c
.	c

She	c
really	c
listen	i
to	c
me	c
and	c
told	c
me	c
that	c
I	c
did	i
the	c
right	c
thing	c
and	c
persuaded	c
me	c
to	c
send	c
in	c
my	c
application	c
for	i
an	i
language	c
course	c
in	c
England	c
.	c

Choosing	c
only	c
two	c
activities	c
in	i
such	c
a	c

About	c

,	c
we	c
met	c
the	c

and	c
recieved	i
tickets	c
to	c
backstage	i
,	i
that	i
was	c
wonderful	c
,	c
maybe	c

than	c
the	c
concert	c
itself	c
!	c

And	c
the	c
next	c
morning	c
,	i
I	c
was	c
here	i
again	c

First	c

Yours	c

I	c
found	c
this	c
opportunity	c
through	c
the	c
Radio	c
in	c
an	c
advertisement	c

On	i
the	i
one	i
hand	i
at	i
first	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
little	c
insure	i
about	c
if	i
I	c
was	c
able	c
to	c
do	c
this	c
job	c
,	c
because	c
they	c
needed	c
people	c
with	c
some	c
skills	c
and	c
experience	c
.	c

According	i
to	i
my	i
job	i
,	i
I	c
had	c
to	c

of	i

it	i
had	i

at	i
the	i
end	i
I	c
felt	c
a	i
member	i
of	c
them	c

because	c
they	c
were	c
so	c
kind	c
to	c
me	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
could	c
colaborated	i
a	c
lot	c
of	i
and	c
I	c
learnt	c
a	c
lot	c
with	c
this	c
project	c

I	c
hope	c
to	c
hear	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c

Dear	c
manager	c

My	c
name	c
is	c
Lisa	c
and	c
I	c
'm	c
21	c
years	c
old	c
.	c

I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
last	c
Friday	c
to	c
see	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
and	c
I	c
felt	c
disappointed	c
about	c
the	c
musical	c
.	c

I	c
expected	c
more	c
from	c
it	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
the	c
actor	c
was	c
the	c
same	c
since	i
last	c
semester	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
really	c
like	c
to	c
see	c
a	c
new	c
one	c
such	c
as	c
Markin	c
Davis	c
,	c
he	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
actor	c
and	c
he	c
would	c
fit	c
well	c
this	i
musical	c
.	c

Then	c
I	c
was	c
sitted	i
with	c
my	c
friend	c
just	c
waiting	c
for	c
the	c
start	c
that	i
lasted	c
forever	c
and	c
was	i
supposed	c
to	c
start	c
at	c
19:30	c
.	c

By	c
the	i
time	c
I	c
thought	c
:	c
"	c
I	c
want	c
my	c
money	c
back.	c
"	c

That	i
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
be	c
a	c
perfect	c
evening	c
turned	c
out	c
to	c
be	c
the	c
most	c
hateful	c
musical	c
I	c
've	c
ever	c
seen	c

The	c
most	c
suitable	c
time	c
for	c

the	c

of	c
my	c
summer	c
holidays	c

On	i

that	c
's	c
the	c
only	c
time	c
when	c
I	c
can	c

An	i
accommodation	c
at	c
the	c

I	c

choosed	i
two	c
activities	c
,	c
swimming	c

These	c

they	c
have	c
a	c
lot	c
to	c
do	c
with	c
water	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
like	c
them	c

enjoyable	c

I	c
agree	c
with	c
this	c
statement	c
especially	c
when	c
we	c
talk	c
about	c
small	c
shop	i
in	c
the	c
center	i
of	c
a	c
big	c
town	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
replying	c
to	c
your	c
letter	c
for	i
the	c
first	c
prize	c
of	i
the	c
competition	c
,	i
that	c
I	c
won	c
and	c
there	c
are	c
a	c
number	c
of	c
thinks	i
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
make	c
clear	c
.	c

You	c
asked	c
me	c
in	c
your	c
last	c
letter	c
when	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
the	c
best	c
time	c
is	c
the	c
first	c
two	c
weeks	c
of	c
July	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
free	c
then	c
.	c

I	c
cannot	c
travel	c
earlier	c
because	c
I	c
take	i
an	c
examination	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
study	c
for	c
it	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
not	c
used	c
to	c
sleeping	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
,	c
so	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
very	c
difficult	c
for	c
me	c
.	i

at	c
the	c
beginning	c
You	i
state	c
in	c
your	c
last	c
letter	c
that	c
I	c
will	c
have	c
the	c
chance	c
to	c
do	c
two	c
activities	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
was	c
younger	c
I	c
attend	i
I	i
local	c
basketball	c
team	c
and	c
we	c
became	c
local	c
champions	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
am	c
good	c
at	c
basketball	c
and	c
have	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
experience	c
.	c

Last	c
year	c
I	c
entered	c
a	c
swimming	c
championship	c
and	c
won	c
the	c
silver	c
medal	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
there	c
is	c
one	c
think	i
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
.	c

Could	c
you	c
tell	c
me	c
what	c
sort	c
of	c
clothes	c
and	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
should	c
have	c
with	c
me	c
?	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

It	c
was	c
great	c
to	c
hear	c
from	c
you	c
again	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
know	c
,	c
I	c
helped	c
at	i
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
last	c
month	c
.	i

Let	c
's	c
start	c
from	c
the	c
beginning	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
to	c
iron	c
them	c
,	c
put	i
them	c
in	c
order	c
,	c
so	c
that	c
the	c
pop	c
stars	c
,	c
who	c
will	i
sing	i
at	c
the	c
concert	c
,	c
look	i
impressive	c
.	i

and	c
handsome	c
.	c

The	c
most	c
exciting	c
things	c
happened	c
later	c
.	c

That	c
was	c
very	c
responsible	i
but	c
fortunately	c
I	c
had	c
help	c
from	c
other	i
person	c
.	c

I	c
must	c
say	c
that	c
being	c
in	i
a	c
concert	c
is	c
very	c
nice	c
.	c

But	c
helping	c
in	i
a	c
concert	c
is	c
much	c
nicer	c
.	c

At	c
the	c
end	c
I	c
realized	c
that	c
all	c
your	i
need	c
is	c
co-operation	c
and	c
do	i
n't	i
think	c
selfishly	c
.	c

Hope	c
to	c
hear	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

Yours	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Ryan	c
,	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

This	c
trip	c
will	c
,	c
undoubtedly	c
be	i
a	c
wonderful	c
experience	c
.	c

As	c
far	c
as	c
the	c
dates	i
of	i
travelling	i
are	c
concerned	c
,	c
the	c
only	c
period	c
available	c
would	c
be	c
in	c
July	c
as	c
I	c
am	c
fully	c
booked	c
for	c
the	c
remaining	i
summer	i
.	c

The	c
only	c
problem	c
would	c
be	c
that	c
my	c
drawing	c
is	c
pretty	c
bad	c
.	c

Concerning	c
Singing	c
activities	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
I	c
'm	c
quite	c
good	c
as	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
in	c
my	c
school	c
's	c
choir	c
for	c
3	c
years	c
.	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

As	c
you	c
asked	c
me	c
,	c
I	c
write	i
you	i
about	c
my	c
experience	c
at	c
the	c
Pop	i
Concert	i
.	c

Well	c
,	c
on	c
the	c
whole	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
pretty	c
cool	c
.	c

The	c
only	c
thing	c
I	c
was	c
asked	c
to	c
do	c
was	c
to	c
help	c
carry	c
the	c
lunches	c
of	c
the	c
singers	c
and	c
to	c
help	c
with	c
light	c
and	c
sound	c
management	c
,	c
when	c
the	c
guy	c
there	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
something	c
else	c
.	c

The	c
woman	c
had	c
to	c
deliver	c
something	c
.	c

There	c
were	c
963	c
persons	i
in	i
the	c
"	c
Armaggedon	i
"	c
that	c
night	c
!	c

But	c
,	c
Kim	c
,	c
can	c
you	c
see	c
an	i
other	i
way	c
to	c
meet	c
the	c
"	c
New	c
Bentley	c
"	c
for	c
free	c
,	c
talk	c
to	c
them	c
and	c
even	c
get	c
paid	c
?	c

That	c
was	c
my	c
best	c
day	c
ever	c
,	c
the	c
one	c
I	i
shared	c
a	c
meal	c
with	c
Paul	c
McPartney	c
.	c

Do	c
n't	c
worry	c
they	c
still	c
organise	c
these	c
"	c
youth	c
work	c
"	c
programs	i
.	c

With	c
love	c

John	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

That	c
's	c
why	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
only	c
in	c
July	c
.	c

There	i
are	c
warmer	c
and	c
drier	c
and	c
I	c
'm	c
afraid	c
of	c
insects	c
and	c
spiders	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
really	c
great	c
that	c
you	c
can	c
suggest	c
how	c
to	c
spend	c
the	c
rest	c
time	i
,	c
because	c
I	c
enjoy	c
swimming	c
and	c
it	c
does	c
n't	c
matter	c
where	c
in	i
the	c
lake	c
or	c
swimming-pool	i
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
's	c
very	i
usefull	i
and	c
helpful	c
thing	c
for	c
my	c
health	c
especially	i
when	c
I	c
do	c
it	c
with	c
pleasure	c
.	c

How	c
much	c
money	c
I	i
need	c
and	c
if	i
I	c
have	c
to	c
have	c
them	i
in	c
cash	c
or	c
I	i
can	i
use	c
a	c
credit	c
card	c
.	i

Would	c
you	c
send	c
me	c
your	c
answer	c
as	c
fast	i
as	c
it	c
possible	i
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
seeing	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c

Hi	c
,	c
Kim	c
!	c

I	c
'm	c
fine	i
soon	i
I	c
'll	c
have	c
my	c
holiday	c
and	c
I	c
look	c
forward	c
for	i
them	i
but	c
now	c
I	c
have	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
exams	c
and	c
if	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
pass	c
them	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
learn	c
a	c
lot	c
.	c

Now	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
about	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	i
as	i
you	c
have	i
already	i
knowen	i
I	c
helped	c
my	c
father	c
to	c
organize	c
this	c
concert	c
.	c

Sometimes	c
I	c
gave	c
some	c
advices	i
about	c
suits	c
and	c
dresses	c
.	c

We	c
have	c
a	c
good	c
and	c
rich	c
sponsor	c
,	i
that	i
's	i
why	c
we	c
could	c
buy	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
different	c
materials	c
with	c
different	c
colours	c
and	c
we	c
tried	c
to	c
be	c
polite	c
with	c
actors	c
even	c
if	c
they	c
did	c
n't	c
want	c
to	c
wear	c
that	c
part	i
of	c
cloth	i
which	c
we	c
thought	c
was	c
more	i
similar	i
to	i
their	c
style	c
.	c

We	c
always	c
explained	c
them	i
and	c
at	i
the	i
end	i
they	c
agreed	c
with	c
us	c
.	c

These	c
days	c
were	c
so	c
busy	c
.	c

Best	c
wishes	c

Katerina	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c

I	c
'm	c
writting	i
to	c
you	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
musical	c
show	i
that	c
I	c
saw	c
when	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
on	i
my	c
holidays	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

For	i
my	i
surprise	i
Danny	c
Brook	c
never	c
apeard	i
.	c

There	c
was	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
instead	c
and	c
it	c
put	i
me	c
very	c
nervous	i
.	c

He	c
is	c
my	c
favorite	i
actor	c
and	c
I	c
pay	i
to	c
saw	i
him	c
not	c
to	c
saw	i
a	c
different	c
actor	c
.	c

Finally	c
at	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
the	c
sow	i
I	c
decided	c
to	c
went	i
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
it	c
was	i
n't	i
been	c
repeard	i
yet	i
.	c

I	c
enclose	c
my	c
postal	c
addresses	c
and	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
a	c
completly	i
refound	i

We	i
could	i
see	i
all	i
over	i
the	i
human	i
being	i
How	c
the	i
fashion	c
change	i
in	c
its	c
colours	c
and	c
styles	c
,	c
Since	c
the	c
first	c
men	c
on	c
the	c
earth	c
started	c
to	c
wear	c
kind	i
of	c
clothes	c
because	c
they	c
were	c
a	c
bit	c
cold	c

Adults	c
think	c
that	c
new	i
coloured	c
clothes	c
,	i
that	c
young	c
people	c
wear	c
are	c
horrible	c
an	i
very	c
untraditional	c
.	c

They	c
think	c
that	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
they	c
will	c
change	c
and	c
start	c
to	c
wear	c
more	c
formal	c
clothes	c
.	c

Carol	c
,	c
16	i
years	i
old	i
girl	c
,	c
said	c
"	i
I	c
imagine	c
clothes	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
very	i
strang	i
.	c

May	i
be	i
they	c
would	i
have	i
many	i
colors	i
and	c
they	c
would	i
be	c
very	c
thight	i
.	c

They	c
would	i
be	c
sinthetic	i
clothes	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
made	i
of	c
plastic	c
or	c
something	c
similar.	c
"	c

Dear	c
Mrs.	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
happy	c
to	c
be	c
the	c
winner	c
of	c
the	c
competition	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
come	i
to	c
Camp	c
California	c
.	c

From	i
August	c
,	c
in	i
fact	i
,	c
I	c
will	c
start	c
with	i
a	c
new	c
job	c
and	c
I	c
will	c
not	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
live	i
Rome	c
for	c
a	c
long	c
period	i
.	c

So	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
decided	c
to	c
chose	i
photography	c
and	c
surfing	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
an	c
absolute	c
beginner	c
at	c
both	c
of	c
them	c
.	c

It	c
would	c
be	i
also	i
useful	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
know	c
if	c
there	c
will	c
be	c
some	i
extra	c
expenses	c
,	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
take	c
enough	c
money	c
for	c
two	c
weeks	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

Being	c
a	c
woman	c
,	c
I	c
naturally	c
love	c
shopping	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
a	c
few	c
moments	i
in	i
which	i
you	c
cannot	c
enjoy	c
shopping	c
.	c

Shops	c
are	c
incredibly	c
crowded	c
.	c

You	c
cannot	c
try	c
on	c
a	c
dress	c
and	c
decide	c
to	c
buy	c
it	c
or	i
not	c
in	c
peace	c
,	c
because	c
outside	c
there	c
is	c
a	c
queue	c
of	c
people	c
waiting	c
for	c
their	c
turn	c
.	c

In	c
many	c
cases	c
,	c
you	c
do	c
not	c
even	c
find	c
the	c
things	c
you	c
want	c
,	c
because	c
shops	i
run	c
out	c
of	c
products	c
very	c
quickly	c
.	c

A	c
man	c
will	c
try	c
to	c
prevent	c
you	c
from	c
trying	c
more	c
than	c
one	c
dress	c
and	i
will	c
refuse	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
the	c
same	c
shop	c
for	c
more	c
than	c
five	c
minutes	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
recently	c
been	c
in	i
London	c
for	c
spending	i
a	c
week	c
's	c
holiday	c
.	c

As	c
I	c
am	c
an	i
enthusiasmic	i
of	c
musicals	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
see	c
this	c
musical	i
show	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
writen	i
that	c
the	c
stars	c
would	c
be	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
.	c

I	c
felt	c
abosolutly	i
disapointed	i
.	c

As	c
you	c
say	c
in	c
your	c
advertisment	i
it	i
was	c
not	c
my	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
and	c
therefore	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
have	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

How	c
has	c
modern	c
technology	c
changed	c
our	c
daily	c
life	i
?	c

Modern	c
technology	c
has	c
changed	c
a	i
lot	i
our	i
daily	i
life	i
.	c

In	c
the	c
past	c
it	c
was	c
impossible	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
Paris	c
from	c
Barcelona	c
and	c
come	c
back	c
in	c
one	c
day	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
the	i
main	c
disadvantage	c
is	c
that	c
using	c
modern	c
machines	c
it	i
can	c
be	c
very	c
difficult	c
for	c
ederly	i
people	c
;	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
very	c
pratitable	i
if	c
the	c
modern	c
industries	c
train	i
people	c
about	i
using	i
modern	c
technologies	c
.	c

If	c
it	c
's	c
possible	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
on	i
July	c
because	c
of	c
my	c
job	c
.	c

It	i
's	i
incredible	i
the	i
large	i
list	i
of	i
interesting	i
activities	i
that	i
you	i
offer	i
.	c

It	c
's	c
difficult	c
just	c
to	c
try	i
two	c
but	c
if	c
I	c
have	c
the	c
chance	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
practice	i
sailing	c
and	c
photography	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
mind	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
are	c
apropriate	i
for	c
the	c
camp	c
and	c
for	c
the	c
weather	i
of	i
California	i
.	c

Luna	c
Juarez	c
.	c

I	c
completely	c
agree	c
with	c
the	c
following	c
statement	c
:	c

From	i
my	i
point	i
of	i
view	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
people	c
believe	c
that	c
it	c
's	c
very	i
fun	c
to	c
go	c
shopping	c
and	c
it	c
's	c
a	c
great	c
way	c
to	c
spend	c
Saturday	c
afternoons	c
and	c
that	c
's	c
true	c
but	i
in	c
my	c
opinion	c
go	i
shopping	c
can	c
be	c
stressing	i

Secondly	c
you	c

in	i
a	c
shop	c
if	c
you	c
're	c
going	c

I	c
mean	c
that	c
you	c

know	c

he	c

And	c
after	c

it	c

I	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
California	c
in	c
the	c
U.S.A.	c
in	c
July	c
.	c

About	i
the	c
accommodation	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
,	c
I	c
prefer	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
.	c

It	c
would	c
be	c
nice	i
and	i
safe	i
for	c
me	c
than	c
the	c
tents	c
.	c

It	c
could	c
be	c
fun	c
for	c
me	c
because	c
I	c
like	c
swimming	c
and	i
sailing	c
could	c
be	c
exciting	c
too	c
.	c

Is	c
it	c
hot	c
or	c
raining	c
?	c

I	c
would	c
be	c
greatful	i
if	c
you	c
could	c
send	c
me	c
the	c
full	c
details	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
following	c
paragraps	i
I	c
will	c
discuss	c
the	c
advantages	c
and	c
disadvantages	c
about	i
shopping	c
.	c

Everyone	c
needs	c
to	c
shopping	i
everyday	i
.	c

It	c
is	c
very	i
important	c
thing	c
for	c
our	c
life	c
.	c

We	c
could	c
buy	c
mostly	i
all	c
we	c
need	c
in	c
one	c
store	c
.	c

Sometime	i
,	c
it	i
's	i
so	c
many	c
people	c
and	c
they	c
are	c
not	c
friendly	c
at	c
all	c
or	c
you	c
are	c
hurry	i
while	c
you	c
are	c
in	c
the	i
long	c
queu	i
.	c

We	c
have	c
seen	c
then	c
,	i
shopping	i
is	c
very	c
important	c
for	c
our	c
life	c
.	c

Most	c
people	c
enjoy	c
shopping	c
because	c
it	c
more	i
convenien	i
for	i
today	c
but	c
if	c
you	c
found	c
the	i
busy	c
place	c
for	c
shopping	c
or	c
it	c
is	i
not	c
as	c
good	c
as	c
you	c
expect	i
.	c

It	c
would	c
not	c
enjoyable	i
for	c
you	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c
With	c
reference	c
to	c
your	c
advertisment	i
regarding	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
"	c
I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
with	i
the	c
intention	c
to	i
give	i
you	c
an	c
impression	c
of	c
our	c
experiences	c
visiting	i
the	c
above	i
mentioned	i
show	c
.	c

According	c
to	c
your	c
advertisment	i
the	c
play	c
should	c
have	c
started	c
at	c
19:30	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
there	c
was	c
an	c
unexplained	c
delay	c
of	c
45	c
minutes	c
.	c

The	c
audience	c
had	c
to	c
sit	c
and	c
wait	c
until	c
20:15	c
.	c

What	c
made	c
the	c
situation	c
worse	c
is	c
that	c
no	c
explanation	c
for	c
the	c
delay	c
was	c
given	c
;	c
not	c
even	c
an	c
apologation	i
.	c

We	c
had	c
been	c
told	c
that	c
discounts	c
to	i
the	c
ticket-prices	i
were	c
possible	i
but	c
at	i
the	c
evening	c
of	c
the	c
show	c
no	c
discounts	c
or	c
special	c
offers	c
whatsoever	c
were	c
offered	c
.	c

We	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
if	c
there	c
is	c
any	c
chance	c
to	i
get	i
our	c
money	c
back	c
of	i
or	c
if	c
you	c
can	c
offer	c
any	c
other	c
alternative	c
for	i
our	i
convenience	i

Dear	c
Tim	c
,	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
regarding	c
the	c
radio	c
programme	c
next	c
Saturday	c
where	c
"	c
The	c
old	c
man	c
and	c
the	c
Sea	c
"	c
by	c
Earnest	c
Hemingway	c
will	c
be	c
read	c
.	c

I	c
recommend	c
you	c
listen	c
to	c
it	c
!	c

As	c
you	c
know	c
we	c
have	c
already	c
had	c
several	c
discussions	c
about	c
literature	c
and	c
what	c
it	c
can	c
tell	c
or	c
teach	c
us	c
.	c

Therefore	c
Hemingway	c
is	c
a	c
very	c
good	c
example	c
.	c

These	c
experiences	c
influenced	c
him	c
so	c
deeply	c
that	c
he	c
described	c
his	c
feelings	c
in	c
several	c
books	c
.	c

One	c
of	c
the	c
most	c
interesting	c
ones	c
is	c
"	c
The	c
old	c
man	c
and	c
the	c
Sea	c
"	c
.	c

A	c
story	c
of	c
an	c
old	c
seaman	c
leaving	c
his	c
town	c
to	c
proove	i
that	c
he	c
is	c
still	c
able	c
to	c
catch	c
the	c
biggest	c
fish	c
ever	c
caught	c
.	c

So	c
did	c
he	c
finally	c
win	c
or	c
loose	c
?	c

An	c
interesting	c
story	c
-	c
demanding	c
in	c
a	c
way	c
-	c
which	c
can	c
give	c
you	c
an	c
impression	c
of	c
Hemingway	c
's	c
work	c
and	c
what	c
he	c
meant	c
by	c
"	c
pace	c
under	c
pressure	c
"	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
will	c
enjoy	c
it	c
!	c

Please	c

I	c
just	c
got	c
your	c
letter	c
yesterday	c

You	c
had	i
ask	i
me	c
a	c
question	c
about	c
my	c
experience	c
helping	i
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
.	c

You	c
wanted	c
me	c
to	c

?	c

Well	c

have	i
to	c
get	c

the	c
stair	i

Then	c
I	c
can	i
take	c
rest	i
about	i
30	c
mins	c

The	c
concert	c
begin	i
...	c
that	i
mean	i
i	i
can	i

We	c

so	c
tried	i
but	c
it	i
's	i
good	c
fun	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
this	c
experience	c

quite	c
interesting	c

If	c
somebody	c

It	c
was	c
such	c
a	c
wonderful	c
story	c
that	c
I	c
remember	c
the	c
old	c
man	c
speaking	c
about	c
human	c
's	c
life	c
between	c
the	c
sea	c
and	c
the	c
man	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
your	c
musical	c
show	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
.	c

Last	c
week	c
I	c
was	c
on	c
holiday	c
at	i
London	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
dissappointed	i
when	c
I	c
visited	c
your	c
theatre	c
.	c

That	c
is	c
why	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
request	c
full	i
refund	c
of	c
my	c
money	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
,	c
but	c
she	c
was	c
her	c
best	c
friend	c
and	c
she	c
had	c
to	c
trust	c
her	c
.	c

Anna	c
told	c
her	c
again	c
:	c
"	c
Pat	c
do	c
n't	c
tell	c
it	i
to	i
anyone	c
please	c
,	c
especially	c
to	i
my	c
brother	c
everything	i
will	i
be	i
ruin	i
then	c
"	c
.	c

The	c
big	c
secret	c
was	c
that	c
Anna	c
was	c
prearing	i
a	c
suprice	i
party	c
for	c
her	c
brother	c
,	i
John	c
and	c
she	c
did	c
n't	c
want	c
anyone	c
to	c
know	c
about	c
it	c
.	c

She	c
had	c
told	c
it	i
to	i
Pat	c
though	c
and	c
that	c
was	c
extremely	c
dangerous	c
!	c

The	c
party	c
was	c
set	c
up	i
to	c
be	c
in	c
two	c
days	c
.	c

The	c
two	c
days	c
passed	c
really	c
fast	c
and	c
Anna	c
was	c
happy	c
because	c
Pat	c
had	c
n't	c
told	c
anything	i
to	i
her	i
brother	i
,	c
or	c
so	c
she	c
thought	c
!	c

Pat	c
went	c
to	c
Anna	c
's	c
and	c
she	c
seemed	c
really	c
unhappy	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
n't	c
help	c
it	c
!	c
,	i
I	c
'm	c
so	c
sorry	c

I	c
would	c

book	c

beginning	c
of	c
July	c

The	c
3rd	c
of	c
July	c
will	c
suit	c
to	i
me	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
more	c
convinient	i
for	c
me	c

I	c
am	c
good	i
diffender	i

I	c
've	c
never	c
done	c
it	c
before	c

I	c
'd	c

Every	c
new	c
day	c
is	c
not	c
the	c
same	c
.	c

Some	i
times	i
we	c
have	c
to	i
have	i
deal	i
with	c
not	i
good	i
service	c
or	c
for	i
example	c
could	i
you	c
imagine	c
it	i
on	i
your	i
way	i
to	i
shop	i
you	i
have	i
met	i
wrong	i
people	i
or	c
someone	c
told	i
you	c
bad	c
news	c
.	c

Situations	i
are	c
variously	i
.	c

Maybe	c
you	c
will	c
spend	c
all	c
your	c
money	c
for	i
a	c
new	c
thing	c
and	c
a	c
few	c
hours	c
later	c
your	c
best	c
friend	c
will	c
invite	c
you	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
night-club	i
but	c
you	c
are	i
short	c
of	c
money	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
wish	c
you	c
have	i
a	i
good	i
enjoyable	c
shopping	c
all	i
your	i
way	i

During	c
my	i
prior	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
I	c
came	c
across	c
an	c
encourageing	i
advertisment	i
for	c

decided	c
to	c
see	c
it	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
dissappointed	i
to	c
find	c
out	c
that	c
there	c
were	c
no	c
discounts	c
available	c
!	c

Therefore	c
,	c
it	c
cost	c
me	c
more	c
money	c
then	c
usual	c

Moreover	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
unable	c
to	c
use	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
as	c
it	c
had	c
been	c
closed	c
due	i
to	i
redecoration	c
!	c

Having	c
noticed	c
that	c
this	c
was	c
not	c
'	c
a	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
'	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
for	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

I	c
feel	c
as	i
if	i
I	c
had	i
been	c
lied	c
to	c
and	c
thus	c
I	c
demand	c
my	c
money	c
to	i
be	i
returned	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

This	c
was	c
the	c
kind	c
of	c
association	c
everybody	c
knew	c
of	i
but	c
nobody	c
talked	c
about	c
.	c

Everyone	c
was	c
aware	c
that	c
telling	i
aloud	c
about	c
'	i
Secret	c
Society	c
'	c
could	c
get	c
you	c
in	c
trouble	c
,	c
serious	c
trouble	c
.	c

There	c
had	c
been	c
cases	c
when	c
somebody	c
entered	c
the	c
club	c
but	c
never	c
came	c
back	c
afterwards	c
.	c

I	c
guess	c
it	c
was	c
that	c
thrill	c
that	c
actually	c
made	c
me	c
anxious	c
to	c
know	c
what	c
really	c
was	c
going	c
on	c
inside	c
the	c
dodgy-looking	c
old	c
house	c
guarded	c
by	c
a	c
man	c
with	c
an	c
unfriendly	c
hound	c
.	c

Especially	c
now	c
,	c
when	c
'	c
big-mouth	c
'	c
Pat	c
spread	i
the	c
news	c
to	c
litterally	i
everyone	c
.	c

Therefore	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
escape	c
.	c

What	c
I	c
've	c
learned	c
from	c
this	c
situation	c
is	c
to	c
never	c
trust	c
people	c
again	c
.	c

Dear	c
Miss	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
glad	c
for	i
my	c
first	c
place	c
in	c
the	c
competition	c
,	i
I	c
am	c
going	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
the	i
things	c
that	c
you	c

on	i
your	c
letter	c
.	c

I	c
would	c

is	i
the	c
perfect	c
time	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
camp	c
and	c
is	i
summer	c
.	c

Accommodation	i
at	c
camp	c
I	i
would	c
like	c
to	c
choose	c
cabins	c
because	c
I	c
think	c
I	c
would	c
be	c
protected	c
from	c
the	c
animals	c
and	c
the	c
cold	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
for	i
the	c
activities	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
select	c
Tennis	c
and	c
Basketball	c
because	c
I	c
haves	i
been	c
playing	c
tennis	c
since	c
I	c
was	c
young	c
and	c
basketball	c
because	c
I	c
played	c
for	c
the	c
team	c
in	c
my	c
college	c
like	i
the	c
capitan	i
.	c

I	c
want	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
one	c
more	c
thing	c
I	i
do	c
not	c
have	c
any	c
idea	c
about	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
and	c
clothes	i
I	c
have	c
to	c
bring	i
would	i
you	c
give	c
me	c
an	i
advice	c
to	i
know	i
how	c
much	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
bring	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
heard	i
from	c
you	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
about	c
my	c
experience	c
when	i
I	i
was	i
helping	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
,	i
well	i
first	c
let	c
me	c
tell	c
you	c
that	c
my	c
job	c
was	c
helping	c
the	c
artist	i
if	c
they	c
need	i
something	c
,	c
for	c
example	c
give	i
them	c
water	c
or	c
snacks	c
.	c

any	i
way	i
,	c
this	c
was	c
my	c
own	i
experience	c
working	c
at	c
the	c
concert	c
,	i
if	i
you	c
have	c
any	i
oportunity	i
to	c
help	c
at	c
any	c
concert	c
you	c
should	c
help	c
because	c
you	c
have	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
fun	c
as	c
well	c
ok	i
.	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Best	c
wishes	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
,	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
prefer	c
staying	c
in	c
log	c
cabins	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
easyer	i
for	c
me	c
to	c
keep	c
my	c
personal	c
belongings	c
clean	c
and	c
tidy	c
apart	i
from	c
the	c
fact	c
that	c
I	c
am	c
terribly	c
afraid	c
of	c
insects	c
such	c
as	c
spiders	c
and	c
ants	c
.	c

In	c
your	c
letter	c
you	c
settled	i
the	c
possibility	c
to	i
choose	i
two	c
activities	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
let	c
you	c
know	c
that	c
I	c
would	c
be	c
pleased	c
if	c
I	c
could	c
join	c
to	i
basketball	c
and	c
climbing	c
,	c
as	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
both	c
of	c
them	c
due	i
to	i
I	i
've	i
played	i
in	i
my	c
secondary	c
scholl	i
as	c
leader	i
of	c
my	i
team	c
and	c
due	c
to	c
my	c
long	c
training	c
periods	i
in	i
lifting	c
weights	c
.	c

Lastly	c
,	c
do	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
take	c
with	c
me	c
any	c
special	c
staff	i
of	c
clothes	c
?	c

Do	c
I	c
need	c
some	c
money	c
?	c
and	c
if	c
it	i
is	i
so	c
,	c
how	c
much	c
?	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c

If	c
this	c
was	c
n't	c
enough	c
you	i
strength	c
and	c
mental	c
health	c
can	c
be	c
completely	c
destroyed	c
when	c
despite	i
having	c
been	c
stolen	i
,	c
having	c
spent	c
hours	c
walking	c
around	c
and	c
being	c
tired	c
and	c
hungry	c
you	i
finally	c
buy	c
something	c
you	c
really	c
liked	i
with	c
your	c
credit	c
card	c
and	c
after	i
having	c
walked	c
a	c
few	c
blocks	c
you	i
see	c
the	c
same	c
item	c
at	c
half	c
price	i
in	c
another	c
shop	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
the	c
winner	c
of	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competion	i
and	c
I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
to	c
give	c
some	i
information	c
which	c
was	c
required	i
for	i
you	c
.	c

Well	c
,	c
it	c
's	c
only	c
possible	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
University	i
's	i
holiday	c
(	c
during	c
the	c
rest	c
of	c
the	c
year	c
I	c
'm	c
attending	c
to	i
the	i
classes	c
)	c
.	c

If	c
I	c
can	c
choose	c
accommodation	i
I	c
prefer	i
log	i
cabins	i
,	c
because	c
when	c
I	c
've	c
been	c
in	i
Camps	i
,	i
it	c
always	c
has	c
been	c
in	c
tents	c
,	c
then	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
change	c
and	c
try	c
this	c
other	c
kind	c
of	c
accommodation	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
really	c
difficult	c
choose	i
two	c
activities	c
from	c
that	c
list	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
shopping	c
is	c
a	c
subject	i
really	i
up	i
to	i
date	i
.	c

I	c
can	c
say	c
that	c
nowadays	c
is	i
growing	i
up	i
very	c
quickly	c
in	c
our	c
society	c
like	i
a	c
kind	c
of	c
sport	c
or	c
hobby	c
to	i
waste	c
or	c
spend	c
the	i
free	c
time	c
.	c

And	c
it	c
's	c
creating	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
adict	i
people	c
,	c
call	i
"	c
shopalcoholics	i
"	c
.	c

Otherwise	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

You	c
can	c
spend	c
hours	c
and	c
hours	c
going	i
shopping	c
and	c
not	c
find	c
what	c
you	c
were	i
looking	c
for	c
,	c
perhaps	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
not	c
your	i
size	c
or	c
the	c
colour	c
that	c
you	c
like	c
,	c
or	c
just	c
nothing	c
is	c
suitable	c
to	i
you	c
.	c

After	c
that	c
,	c
the	i
unfriendly	c
and	c
sometime	i
's	i
unpolite	i
shop	c
assistance	i
who	c

17th	c
June	c
,	c
2000	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
:	c

Or	c
to	i
whom	i
it	i
main	i
concern	i
:	c

I	c
am	c
writting	i
to	c
you	c
because	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
very	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
at	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
.	c

Well	c
I	i
seems	c
to	c
me	c
that	c
you	c
should	c
know	c
what	c
had	i
happened	i
there	c
.	c

Do	c
n't	c
you	c
think	c
it	i
is	i
a	c
lack	c
of	c
respect	c
?	c

Really	c
it	c
was	i
.	c

I	c
forgot	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
that	c
there	c
were	c
no	c
available	i
discounts	i
.	c

And	c
tickets	i
were	c
too	c
expensive	c
!	c

Most	c
people	c
could	c
n't	c
afford	c
them	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
went	c
there	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
have	c
something	c
to	c
eat	c
.	c

But	c
can	c
you	c
believed	c
it	c
,	i
it	i
was	c
closed	c
.	c

Absolutely	i
closed	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
asked	c
someone	c
who	c
seemed	c
to	c
be	c
in	c
charge	c
,	c
and	c
he	c
told	c
me	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
too	c
late	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
meal	c
.	c

This	c
really	c
disappoint	i
me	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
both	c
hungry	c
and	c
angry	c
.	c

Looking	c
forward	c
hearing	i
from	c
you	c
.	c

Secrets	c

He	c
was	c
really	c
a	c
good	c
friend	c
,	c
until	c
something	c
had	i
happened	i
.	c

I	c
was	c
attending	c
college	c
,	c
as	c
I	c
normally	c
do	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
keen	c
on	c
English	c
lessons	c
,	c
maybe	c
because	c
I	c
was	c
sitting	c
near	c
the	c
Boy	c
I	c
loves	i
.	c

But	c
far	i
from	i
that	i
,	c
he	c
was	c
a	c
very	c
kind	c
person	c
.	c

Pat	c
told	c
me	c
that	c
he	c
was	c
also	c
in	c
love	c
with	c
me	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
know	c
what	c
to	c
do	c
.	c

He	c
did	c
n't	c
kept	i
my	c
secret	c
.	c

This	c
was	c
my	c
secret	c
and	c
now	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
.	c

But	c
so	i
,	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
was	c
for	c
the	c
best	c
,	c
he	c
was	c
also	c
in	c
love	c
with	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
will	c
not	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
travel	c
on	i
August	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
found	c
a	c
job	c
for	c
that	c
month	c
.	c

Secondly	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
be	i
accommodate	i
in	c
log	i
cabins	i
.	c

I	c
play	i
basketball	c
since	c
I	c
was	c
twelve	c
years	c
old	c
and	c
I	c
am	i
member	i
of	c
the	c
basketball	i
school	i
team	c
for	c
four	c
years	c
.	c

Finaly	i
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
for	c
some	c
further	c
informations	i
about	c
the	c
clothes	c
and	c
the	c
money	c
we	c
will	c
need	c
.	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

As	c
you	c
already	c
know	c
,	c
last	c
month	c
I	c
was	c
helping	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
.	c

I	c
did	c
n't	c
have	c
to	c
do	c
something	i
very	c
difficult	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
only	c
responsable	i
for	c
the	i
property	i
of	i
the	i
back	i
stages	i
.	c

But	c
if	c
anyone	c
was	i
been	i
asking	i
for	c
some	c
help	c
I	c
was	c
always	c
there	c
.	c

The	c
most	c
exciting	c
about	i
this	c
experience	c
was	c
to	i
meet	i
all	c
these	c
well-known	c
people	c
.	c

If	c
I	c
have	c
the	c
opportunity	c
next	c
month	c
I	c
really	c
want	c
to	c
go	c
back	c
.	c

I	c
will	c
definitely	c
apply	c
for	c
a	c
place	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
problems	c
were	i
exist	i
on	i
the	i
musical	c
show	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
you	c
said	c
that	c
the	c
starring	i
would	c
be	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
but	c
there	i
was	c
not	c
.	c

People	c
have	i
been	i
started	c
to	c
complain	c
.	c

They	c
were	i
not	c
exist	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

He	c
told	c
him	c
,	i
that	c
he	c
was	c
in	c
love	c
with	c
Jane	c
,	c
a	c
girl	c
in	c
their	c
class	c
.	c

Jane	c
was	c
a	c
very	c
good	c
girl	c
and	c
she	c
liked	c
Brian	c
.	c

He	c
did	c
n't	c
told	i
the	i
secret	c
because	c
he	c
wanted	c
to	c
heard	i
Brian	c
but	c
because	c
he	c
wanted	c
to	c
help	c
him	c
.	c

Brian	c
learm	i
what	c
was	i
happened	c
and	c
at	c
first	c
he	c
was	c
angry	c
with	c
Pat	c
but	c
then	c
he	c
thanked	c
him	c
.	c

Jane	c
and	c
Brian	c
were	c
very	c
happy	c
.	c

Brian	c
and	c
Pat	c
had	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
arguments	c
about	c
this	c
because	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
the	c
time	c
for	c
the	c
second	c
session	c
was	c
meant	c
to	c
be	c
at	c
19.30	c
,	c
but	c
somehow	c
it	c
began	c
at	c
20.15	c
,	c
which	c
was	c
a	c
45	c
minutes	c
delay	c
.	c

But	c
my	c
complain	i
does	c
not	c
finish	c
here	c
.	c

And	c
what	c
is	c
more	c
,	c
I	c
could	c
not	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
as	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
the	c
main	c
chef	c
was	c
ill	c
and	c
could	c
not	c
come	c
to	c
work	c
.	c

Definetely	i
,	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
my	c
perfect	c
evening	c
at	c
all	c
and	c
under	c
these	c
circumstances	c
I	c
really	c
believe	c
you	c
should	c
give	c
me	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

Alessandra	c
Lane	c
.	c

She	c
also	c
told	c
her	c
not	c
to	c
tell	c
anybody	c
about	c
it	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
secret	c
.	c

I	c
did	c
n't	c
know	c
it	c
was	c
published	c
as	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
read	c
the	c
paper	c
and	c
no	c
one	c
told	c
me	c
anything	c
,	c
either	c
.	c

At	c
first	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
realise	c
what	c
was	c
happening	c
,	c
but	c
then	c
a	c
friend	c
of	c
mine	c
told	c
me	c
that	c
everyone	c
knew	c
that	c
I	c
was	c
going	c
out	c
with	c
the	c
most	c
popular	c
boy	c
in	c
the	c
school	c
and	c
that	c
we	c
had	c
kissed	c
eachother	i
in	c
the	c
park	c
last	c
friday	i

That	c
day	c
I	c
swore	c
to	c

that	c
I	c
would	c
never	c
trust	c
anybody	c
again	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c

Competition	c
Organiser	c

I	c
recived	i
your	c
letter	c
about	c
I	i
won	i
two	i
weeks	i
at	c
camp	c
California	c
in	c
the	c
U.S.A	c
.	c

About	c
the	c
accommodation	c
at	c
camp	c
,	c
I	c
prefer	c
in	i
tents	i
because	c
I	c
love	c
sleep	i
in	c
tents	c
,	i
is	i
more	c
interesting	c
than	c
sleep	i
in	c
log	c
cabins	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
worried	c
about	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
will	c
need	c
in	c
the	c
camp	c
?	c
and	i
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
carry	i
for	c
the	c
trip	c
?	c

Could	c
you	c
answer	c
my	c
questions	c
please	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
you	c
can	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
'm	c
nervous	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
need	c
your	c
soon	i
answer	i
,	c
and	c
I	c
will	c
have	c
talk	i
with	c
my	c
parents	c
about	c
camp	i
.	c

Yours	c
Sincerely	c

I	c
agree	c
with	i
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

Nowadays	c
,	c
the	i
people	c
are	c
always	c
buying	c
anythings	i
maybe	i
they	c
do	c
n't	c
need	c
this	i
things	c
,	c
only	i
buy	c
because	i
is	i
in	c
fashion	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
first	c
place	c
,	c
when	c
the	i
people	c
think	c
only	c
in	i
go	i
to	i
the	i
shopping	c
forgot	i
others	i
things	c
:	c
play	i
with	c
their	c
children	c
,	c
talk	i
with	c
than	i
parents	c
,	c
friends	c
.	c

I	c
my	c
view	c
,	c
is	i
more	c
enjoyable	c
do	i
others	i
things	c
than	c
go	i
to	i
shopping	c
because	c
,	c
maybe	c
"	i
you	c
lose	i
your	c
money	c
"	c
.	c

We	c
paid	c
to	c
see	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
my	c
son	c
's	c
favorite	i
actor	c
,	c
but	c
we	c
seems	i
quite	c
disappointing	i
,	i
my	i
son	c
was	c
very	c
happy	c
because	c
he	c
would	c
see	c
for	i
the	i
first	i
time	i
his	i
favorite	i
actor	i
.	c

However	c
it	i
's	i
just	c
the	c
begining	i
of	c
the	c
problems	c
we	c
had	c
.	c

Expecting	c
the	i
britan	i
pontuality	i
we	i
went	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
at	c
19:00	c
to	c
wath	i
the	c
19:30	c
section	i
but	c
it	c
only	c
starts	i
at	c
20:15	c
,	i
it	i
finished	c
later	c
than	c
it	c
was	c
suposed	i
to	c
and	c
then	c
we	c
missed	c
the	c
train	c
.	c

In	i
spite	i
of	i
this	c
,	c
less	i
you	c
can	c
do	c
for	c
us	c
is	c
to	c
give	c
my	i
money	c
back	c
and	c
work	c
hard	c
so	c
that	c
this	c
theater	i
that	i
is	c
famouis	i
about	i
its	c
beauty	c
and	c
pontuality	i
do	i
n't	i
become	c
famous	c
about	i
it	i
desorganized	i
shows	c
.	c

People	c
have	c
seen	c
in	c
the	c
last	c
10	c
years	c
how	c
diferent	i
our	c
clothes	c
had	i
become	c
to	i
.	c

It	c
is	c
a	c
revolution	c
in	c
the	i
fashion	c
that	c
is	c
starting	c
now	c
.	c

Nowadays	c
we	c
have	c
drifit	i
a	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
that	c
keep	c
the	c
temperature	c
of	c
our	c
body	i
,	i
clothes	i
that	c
do	c
n't	c
get	c
wet	c
or	c
even	c
dirty	c
.	c

Computers	c
that	i
make	i
some	i
little	c
things	c
for	i
us	i
nowadays	c
,	c
but	c
at	c
the	c
speed	c
at	c
tecnology	i
goes	i
in	i
the	c
next	c
century	c
those	i
clothes	c
will	c
tell	c
our	c
doctors	c
our	i
healt	i
at	c
any	c
moment	c
,	c
any	c
time	c
,	c
any	i
where	i
,	c
people	c
will	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
locate	c
us	c
arround	i
the	c
world	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
very	c
surprised	c
about	c
the	c
good	c
news	c
and	c
I	c
'm	c
sure	c
I	c
'll	c
really	c
have	c
a	c
good	c
time	c
in	c
California	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
happy	c
to	c
answer	c
to	i
your	c
questions	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
my	c
boss	c
wo	c
n't	c
let	c
me	c
free	i
in	c
August	c
.	c

Regarding	c
to	i
the	c
activities	c
,	c
I	c
choose	c
swimming	c
and	c
tennis	c
.	c

There	c
is	c
something	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
.	c

And	c
what	c
about	c
money	c
?	c

I	c
ca	c
n't	c
?look	i
forward	i
to	c
start	c
this	c
adventure	c
.	c

Carla	c
Reale	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c

I	c
'm	c
a	c
woman	c
and	c
they	c
say	c
that	c
shopping	c
is	c
women	c
's	c
best	i
activity	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
have	c
a	c
particular	c
problem	c
.	c

And	c
if	c
this	c
is	c
a	c
problem	c
to	i
me	c
,	c
imagine	c
how	c
bad	c
a	c
very	c
fat	c
woman	c
(	c
or	c
man	c
)	c
should	i
feel	c
.	c

Often	c
they	c
must	c
go	c
in	i
special	c
shops	c
to	c
by	i
their	c
clothes	c
.	c

It	c
looks	c
like	c
a	c
sort	c
of	c
racism	c
and	c
unfortunately	c
our	c
society	c
looks	c
for	c
beauty	c
.	c

Just	c
think	c
about	c
commercials	c
.	c

They	c
're	c
full	c
of	c
perfect	c
people	c
.	c

The	c
sort	c
of	c
people	c
you	c
will	c
never	c
find	c
in	c
real	c
life	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
so	c
,	c
but	c
,	c
in	c
the	c
meantime	c
,	c
I	c
'm	c
on	c
a	c
diet	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Brown	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
information	c
about	c
Mr	c
Brown	c
's	c
surprise	c
party	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
the	c
reason	c
that	c
we	c
decided	c
to	c
do	i
this	c
party	c
was	c
because	c
Mr	c
Brown	c
helped	c
to	i
the	c
organisation	c
of	c
our	c
trip	c
to	c
France	c
.	c

And	c
we	c
preciate	i
to	i
not	i
tell	i
him	c
about	c
our	c
party	c
.	c

As	c
concerned	i
the	c
food	c
,	c
our	c
mothers	c
they	i
will	c
help	c
about	i
that	c
.	c

Also	c
,	c
the	i
drinks	i
we	i
will	i
take	i
them	i
from	c
our	c
canteen	c
and	c
there	c
will	c
be	c
a	c
group	c
of	c
mucisians	i
for	c
our	c
entertainment	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

He	c
also	c
tell	i
that	c
I	c
must	c
be	c
the	i
next	i
day	i
at	i
7:00	i
p.m.	i
in	i
the	i
company	i
.	c

I	c
was	c
surpised	i
because	c
I	c
did	c
not	c
know	c
what	c
he	c
wanted	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
went	c
his	i
wants	i
to	c
tell	c
me	c
that	c
from	c
the	c
next	c
month	c
I	c
will	i
be	c
his	c
personal	c
secratary	i
and	c
my	c
salary	c
it	i
will	i
be	c
the	i
double	i
how	i
the	i
previous	i
.	c

Now	c
,	c
my	c
life	c
it	i
is	c
in	i
the	c
best	c
way	i
it	i
would	i
be	c
thought	i
about	i
.	c

I	c
recently	c
had	c
a	c
week	c
's	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
and	c
went	c
to	c
see	c
a	c
musical	c
show	c
in	i
your	c
theatre	c
.	c

With	c
a	c
friend	i
we	i
had	c
seen	c
your	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
witch	i
was	i
very	c
attractive	c
.	c

The	c
starring	i
had	c
been	c
changed	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
had	c
started	c
only	i
at	c
20:15	c
,	c
and	c
there	c
were	c
no	c
discounts	c
available	c
.	c

Also	c
the	c
Theatre	c
Restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
for	c
some	i
working	i
inside	i
.	c

And	c
your	c
last	c
phrasal	i
of	i
the	c
advertisement	c
"	i
Your	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
"	c
!	c
it	i
was	c
n't	c
at	i
all	c
,	c
like	i
I	c
have	c
explain	i
you	i
above	c
in	c
this	c
letter	c
.	c

At	i
the	i
began	c
of	i
my	i
work	i
in	c
a	i
Insurance	c
Company	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
only	c
a	i
old	c
writting	i
machine	i
,	c
witch	i
makes	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
noise	c
and	c
was	c
very	c
difficult	c
to	c
write	c
with	c
it	i
because	c
the	c
switch	i
were	c
hard	c
for	i
my	c
small	c
fingers	c
.	c

Now	c
I	c
have	c
a	c
new	c
computer	c
,	c
witch	i
is	c
very	c
easy	c
to	c
use	c
,	c
and	c
confortable	i
for	c
my	c
fingers	c
also	i
more	i
farrster	i
.	c

But	c
wen	i
the	c
computer	c
do	i
n't	i
work	c
,	c
I	c
got	i
a	c
big	c
problem	c
to	i
do	i
my	c
work	c
.	c

Also	c
now	c
for	i
write	i
a	i
letter	i
to	i
a	i
friend	i
overland	i
it	i
is	i
better	i
with	i
Internet	i
.	c

It	c
is	c
so	c
practical	c
,	c
in	c
five	c
minuts	i
my	c
friend	c
can	c
read	c
my	c
letter	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
,	i
it	c
is	c
now	c
the	c
futur	i
for	i
the	i
big	c
company	i
for	i
work	i
with	c
the	c
Internet	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
getting	c
sun-tanned	c
under	c
the	c
sun	c
in	c
California	c
.	c

Also	c
my	c
kids	c
have	c
school	c
holidays	c
during	c
this	c
month	c
therefore	c
I	c
hope	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
mid	c
of	i
July	c
.	c

Because	c
our	c
family	c
had	c
some	c
bad	c
experiences	c
with	c
using	c
tents	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
very	c
difficult	c
to	c
choose	c
only	c
two	c
of	c
those	c
fascinating	c
activities	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
made	c
a	c
decision	c
,	c
which	c
is	c
Golf	c
and	c
Photography	c
.	c

Even	c
though	c
I	c
'm	c
poorly	c
skilled	c
.	c

Especially	i
I	c
wonder	c
what	c
else	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
pack	c
to	c
go	c
there	c
.	c

I	c
wish	i
you	c
are	c
fine	c
.	c

I	c
remember	c
that	c
you	c
asked	c
me	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
about	c
that	c
job	c
.	c

Can	c
you	c
imagine	c
that	c
I	c
touched	c
all	c
of	c
the	c
costumes	c
the	c
singer	c
wore	c
?	c

But	c
it	c
was	c
terrific	c
enough	c
to	c
hear	c
the	c
band	c
performing	c
and	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
audience	c
's	c
reactions	c
,	c
meanwhile	c
the	c
backstage	c
could	c
n't	c
even	c
join	i
that	c
fantastic	c
atmosphere	c
.	c

And	c
that	c
mad	i
the	c
concert	c
absolutely	c
perfect	c
.	c

Stay	c
pretty	c
and	c
lovely	c
!	c

Kisses	c
from	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
.	i

I	c
am	c
writting	i
to	c
inform	c
some	i
problems	c
we	c
had	c
.	c

I	c
want	i
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
to	c
see	c
"	c
over	i
the	i
rainbow	i
"	c
at	i
17th	c
June	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
we	c
went	c
to	c
ticket	i
office	c
to	c
get	c
the	c
tickets	c
.	c

I	c
thought	c
we	c
can	i
buy	c
discounts	c
tickets	c
according	i
to	i
the	c
advertisement	c
.	c

To	c
tell	c
the	c
truth	c
,	c
we	c
could	c
n't	c
enjoy	c
our	c
evening	c
.	c

Would	c
it	c
be	c
possible	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
back	i
money	i
for	c
tickets	i
.	i

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
you	i
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
.	c

We	c
had	c
a	c
secret	c
.	c

After	c
we	c
finish	i
school	c
,	c
we	c
usually	c
gathered	c
the	i
place	c
.	c

Where	c
do	c
you	c
think	c
?	i

It	c
was	c
ship	c
!	c
!	c

One	c
day	c
,	c
Freddie	c
found	c
it	c
there	c
.	c

it	i
was	c
old	c
and	c
little	i
broken	i
.	c

But	c
it	c
was	c
most	i
important	c
place	c
in	c
the	c
world	c
.	c

We	c
worried	c
about	c
it	c
and	c
we	c
tryed	i
to	c
pull	i
it	c
.	c

It	c
seemed	c
to	c
sank	i
into	c
the	c
sea	c
,	c
but	c
fourtunately	i
,	c
storm	i
went	i
soon	i
.	c

Our	c
ship	c
left	i
on	c
the	c
beach	c
.	c

Because	c
Pat	c
called	i
them	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
a	c
secret	c
!	c
!	c

I	c
have	c
recently	c
been	c
on	c
a	c
holiday	c
in	i
London	c
.	c

During	c
my	c
stay	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
musical	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
.	c

Now	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
a	c
few	c
things	c
which	c
made	c
me	c
very	c
disappointed	c
.	c

Secondly	c
I	c
also	i
would	i
like	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
the	c
musical	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
start	c
at	c
19.30	c
but	c
it	c
did	c
not	c
start	c
until	c
20.15	c
.	c

Finally	c
when	c
it	c
started	c
we	c
noticed	c
to	c
our	c
suprisement	i
that	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
the	c
right	c
actor	c
.	i

Very	c
disappointing	c
as	i
Danny	c
Brook	c
is	c
my	c
favourite	c
actor	c
.	c

Afterwards	c
we	c
wanted	c
to	c
go	c
for	c
a	c
pleasent	i
dinner	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
certainly	c
not	c
a	c
perfect	c
night	c
out	c
.	c

Fashion	c
of	c
the	c
future	c

In	c
what	c
way	c
will	c
they	c
change	c
?	c

I	c
gave	c
it	c
a	i
thought	c
the	c
other	c
day	c
and	c
when	c
I	c
think	c
about	c
future-clothing	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
take	c
my	c
mind	c
from	i
plastic-fabrics	i
.	c

My	c
conclusion	c
is	c
that	c
people	c
will	c
wear	c
less	c
and	c
thinner	c
clothes	c
.	c

I	c
mean	c
when	c
the	c
earth	i
's	i
getting	c
warmer	c
and	c
warmer	c
because	c
of	c
an	i
pollution	c
that	c
we	c
people	c
cause	i
the	i
world	c
.	c

Maybe	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
they	c
'll	c
find	c
out	i
a	c
new	c
fabric	c
which	c
protects	c
you	c
from	c
dirt	c
and	c
dangerous	c
sunshine	c

Maybe	c
everybody	c
will	c
end	c
up	c
wearing	c
shorts	c
and	c
skirts	c

Anyway	c
we	i
defenately	i
now	i
that	c
they	c
're	c
going	c
to	c
change	c

If	c
we	c
live	c
long	c
enough	c
we	c
'll	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
find	c
out	c
,	i
so	c
keep	c
living	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

Last	c
weekend	c
,	c
I	c
have	i
been	i
in	c
London	c
with	c
my	c
friend	c
and	c
I	c
saw	c
your	c
musical	c
show	c
"	c
over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
.	c

I	c
write	c
this	c
letter	c
to	c
you	c
for	i
explain	i
my	i
very	c
bad	c
evening	c
I	c
have	c
passed	i
in	c
theatre	i
.	c

On	i
the	c
paper	c
it	c
was	c
writting	i
the	i
principal	c
actor	c
is	c
"	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
"	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
him	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
that	i
we	c
have	i
never	c
seen	c
,	c
and	i
heard	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
's	c
really	c
not	c
correct	i
.	c

After	c
this	c
bad	c
show	c
we	c
had	c
want	i
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
Restaurant	c
for	c
drunk	i
and	c
ate	i
something	c
and	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
and	c
nobody	c
had	i
explained	i
us	i
why	c
the	c
Restaurant	c
was	c
n't	c
open	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
I	c
'm	c
very	c
angry	c
when	c
I	c
think	c
about	c
this	c
evening	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
have	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
,	c
this	c
sentance	i
is	c
very	c
popular	c
in	c
our	c
school	c
.	c

Pat	c
is	c
not	c
an	c
angry	i
girl	c
.	c

I	c
asked	c
my	c
parents	c
and	c
they	c
said	i
alright	i
you	c
can	c
go	c
to	c
Pat	i
for	i
sleeping	i
.	c

I	c
passed	i
a	c
really	c
beautiful	c
evening	c
with	c
Pat	c
and	c
my	c
boyfriend	c
in	c
the	c
cinema	c
,	c
but	c
on	c
Sunday	c
my	c
mother	c
phone	i
Pat	c
's	c
mother	c
and	c
Pat	c
's	c
mother	c
explain	i
all	i
the	i
story	c
to	c
my	c
mother	c
.	c

Since	c
this	i
Saturday	c
evening	c
I	c
had	i
never	c
speaking	i
with	i
Pat	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
Camp	i
California	c
on	c
Monday	c
,	c
6th	c
July	c
,	c
because	c
my	c
school	c
's	c
holiday	c
will	c
begin	c
at	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
June	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
could	c
you	c
make	c
an	c
arrangement	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
,	c
because	c
it	c
seems	c
that	c
living	c
in	c
log	c
cabins	c
is	c
more	c
exciting	c
than	c
in	c
tents	c
.	c

Also	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
go	c
swimming	c
and	c
surfing	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
used	c
to	c
be	c
an	c
assistant	c
in	c
a	c
Korean	c
national	c
pool	c
so	i
that	i
I	c
am	c
good	c
at	c
swimming	c
.	c

That	c
is	c
why	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
do	c
that	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
could	c
you	c
tell	c
me	c
if	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
bring	c
some	c
clothes	c
,	c
towels	c
and	c
extra	c
money	c
?	c

I	c
would	c
be	i
appreciated	i
it	c
if	c
you	c
supply	i
some	c
towers	i
,	c
if	c
possible	c
.	c

Thanks	c
for	c
your	c
attention	c
.	c

I	c
really	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
receiving	c
your	c
reply	c
soon	c
.	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

How	c
have	c
you	c
been	c
?	c

Anyway	c
,	c
I	c
'll	c
tell	c
you	c
about	c
my	c
wonderful	c
experience	c
which	c
I	c
enjoyed	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
.	c

I	c
helped	c
to	c
guide	c
foreginers	i
who	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
take	i
participated	i
in	c
that	c
.	c

You	c
know	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
studied	c
English	c
for	c
two	c
years	c
in	c
England	c
.	c

That	c
's	c
why	c
I	c
could	c
attend	c
to	i
that	c
concert	c
as	c
a	c
volunteer	c
,	c
because	c
they	c
needed	c
people	c
who	c
could	c
speak	c
English	c
very	c
well	c
.	c

What	c
I	c
really	c
enjoyed	c
was	c
meeting	c
famous	c
World	c
singers	c
such	c
as	c
Madona	c
,	c
Bon	c
Jovi	c
,	c
Ena	c
and	c
so	c
on	c
.	c

I	c
really	c
hope	c
to	c
see	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

Tuesday	c
13th	c
june	i

to	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c

But	c
I	c
think	c
(	c
it	c
's	c
difficult	c
to	c
choose	c
)	c
I	c
'll	c
choose	c
golf	c
and	c
basketball	c
,	c
golf	c
because	c
I	c
'm	c
quiet	i
good	c
.	c

Can	c
I	c
change	c
money	c
on	c
the	c
campus	i
?	c

Are	c
some	i
party	i
organized	c
during	c
the	c
holidays	c
?	c

Is	c
there	c
only	c
one	c
teatcher	i
for	c
each	c
sport	c
,	c
and	c
how	c
many	c
are	c
we	i
in	c
each	c
group	c
of	i
activities	i
?	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hear	i
from	c
you	c
.	c

Report	c
about	c
which	c
lessons	c
and	c
activities	c
we	c
should	c
film	c
.	c

Just	c
after	c
,	c
to	c
make	c
a	c
contrast	c
,	c
we	c
may	c
film	c
the	c
break	c
,	c
because	c
it	c
's	c
the	c
other	c
part	c
of	c
a	c
daily	i
school	i
!	c

It	c
's	c
the	c
place	c
where	c
you	c
can	c
meet	c
your	c
friends	c
,	c
where	c
you	c
can	c
talk	c
free	i
,	c
there	i
are	c
no	c
teatchers	i
,	i
it	i
could	c
be	c
a	c
good	c
contrast	c
to	c
the	c
serious	i
of	c
the	c
lessons	c
.	c

Finally	c
we	c
should	c
film	c
the	c
lunch	c
,	c
which	c
is	c
also	c
a	c
moment	c
to	i
relax	i
for	i
the	i
students	i
,	i
and	i
for	i
the	i
teatchers	i
,	i
we	i
must	c
n't	c
forget	c
to	c
film	c
the	c
teatcher	i
room	c
because	c
if	c
a	c
school	c
is	c
made	c
of	c
students	c
,	c
it	c
's	c
also	c
made	c
of	c
teatchers	i
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Ryan	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
you	c
recently	c
sent	c
me	c
concerning	c
the	c
competiton	i
of	i
two	c
weeks	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
in	c
the	c
U.S.A	c
.	c

This	c
august	i
I	c
will	c
start	c
a	c
new	c
job	c
so	c
the	c
only	c
possible	c
month	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
join	c
in	i
the	c
Camp	i
is	c
July	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
glad	c
that	c
you	c
offer	c
for	i
accommodation	c
not	c
only	c
tents	i
but	c
also	c
log	i
cabins	c
.	c

Because	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
light	c
sleeper	c
and	c
have	c
problems	c
with	c
my	c
back	c
I	c
prefer	c
to	c
sleep	c
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
with	c
a	c
comfortable	c
bed	c
.	c

Although	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
easy	c
to	c
choose	c
two	c
activities	c
from	c
your	c
list	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
do	c
Singing	i
and	i
Surfing	i
.	c

It	c
is	c
difficult	c
to	c
say	c
how	c
good	i
I	c
can	c
sing	c
but	c
I	c
really	c
like	c
it	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
I	c
am	c
not	c
too	c
bad	c
.	c

I	c
never	i
did	i
Surfing	i
in	c
my	c
life	c
but	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
very	c
good	c
Snowboarder	i
and	c
this	c
could	c
be	c
an	c
advantage	c
.	c

There	c
is	c
something	c
I	c
like	i
to	c
know	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Should	c
I	c
bring	c
some	c
special	c
clothes	c
(	c
surfing	c
)	c
with	c
me	c
?	c

Last	c
saturday	i
evening	c
I	c
spent	i
a	c
wonderful	c
time	c
.	c

The	c
motor	i
bike	i
club	c
of	i
our	c
town	c
organized	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
.	c

I	c
did	c
not	c
hesitate	c
one	c
moment	c
.	c

Some	c
people	c
came	c
from	c
Germany	c
some	i
from	c
Austria	c
and	c
some	c
came	c
from	c
England	c
or	c
the	c
U.S.A	c
.	c

They	c
were	c
all	c
very	c
kind	c
and	c
with	c
some	c
of	c
them	c
I	c
spent	c
the	c
rest	c
of	c
the	c
evening	c
and	c
also	c
the	c
following	c
day	c
.	c

That	i
I	i
reached	i
a	i
lot	i
of	i
money	i
for	i
doing	i
something	i
I	i
like	i
very	i
much	i
was	i
very	i
nice	i
but	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
thing	c
for	c
me	c
was	c
meeting	c
people	c
,	c
having	c
fun	c
and	c
using	c
the	c
English	c
language	c
.	c

I	c
will	c
never	c
forget	c
this	c
evening	c
.	c

Rosalinde	c
Schulz	c

I	c
have	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
that	c
I	c
'd	c
prefer	c
tents	i
.	c

For	c
me	c
tents	c
are	c
a	c
kind	c
of	c
back	i
to	i
basic	i
living	c
and	c
I	c
like	c
this	c
very	c
much	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
people	c
should	c
become	c
more	c
familiar	c
with	c
the	c
rules	c
of	c
nature	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
glad	c
to	c
read	c
that	c
it	c
is	c
possible	c
to	c
do	c
activities	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
also	c
used	c
to	c
sing	i
in	c
front	c
of	c
a	c
large	c
number	c
of	c
people	c
'	i
couse	i
I	c
did	i
it	c
several	c
times	c
.	c

There	c
are	c
two	c
further	c
questions	c
which	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
.	c

I	c
'd	c
be	c
very	c
happy	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
give	c
me	c
a	c
call	c
and	c
answer	c
this	i
questions	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	i

Dear	c
Kim	c
!	c

Last	c
month	c
I	c
received	c
a	c
letter	c
which	c
told	c
me	c
that	c
I	i
've	i
entered	i
a	c
competition	c
.	c

But	c
it	c
was	c
true	c
.	c

My	c
price	i
was	c
the	c
chance	c
to	c
meet	c
a	c
pop	c
group	c
and	c
to	c
help	c
at	c
the	i
concert	c
.	c

But	c
now	c
to	c
the	c
concert	c
itself	c
.	c

It	c
took	c
place	c
on	c
the	c
10th	c
of	c
June	c
in	c
Salzburg	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
so	c
excited	c
that	c
I	i
also	i
was	i
not	i
able	i
to	i
eat	i
anything	i
.	c

At	c
7	c
p.m.	c
the	c
first	c
group	c
started	c
.	c

They	c
were	c
unknown	c
and	c
not	c
very	c
good	c
but	c
when	c
I	c
met	c
them	c
afterwards	c
I	c
recognised	i
that	c
they	c
are	i
very	c
nice	c
.	c

Questions	c
like	c
you	c
and	c
I	c
usually	c
ask	c
each	c
other	c
.	c

You	c
know	c
what	c
I	c
mean	c
,	i
they	i
were	c
not	c
conceited	c
or	c
something	i
like	c
this	i
.	c

Lots	c
of	c
hugs	c
and	c
kisses	c

I	c
have	c
just	c
received	c
your	c
letter	c
,	c
and	c
thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
your	c
reply	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
available	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
from	c
1st	c
to	c
20th	c
because	c
my	c
university	c
will	c
be	c
closed	c
during	c
this	i
month	c
.	c

Thirdly	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
interested	c
in	c
swimming	c
and	c
also	c
climbing	c
.	c

I	c
took	c
up	c
climbing	c
five	c
years	c
ago	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
keen	c
on	c
.	i

I	c
have	c
asked	i
to	c
write	c
a	c
composition	c
regarding	c
the	c
questionit	i
is	c
believed	c
that	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

In	c
fact	c
,	c
to	i
do	i
shopping	c
can	c
be	i
some	c
disavantages	i
for	c
different	c
reasons	c
:	c

Secondly	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
easy	c
to	c
spend	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
money	c
in	c
few	i
minutes	c
and	c
as	i
soon	i
as	i
you	i
can	i
regret	i
to	i
buy	i
all	c
these	i
clothes	c
,	i
which	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
really	c
need	c
.	c

Thirdly	c
,	c
some	c
clothes	c
can	c
have	c
some	c
stains	c
on	c
and	c
you	c
have	c
n't	c
noticed	c
this	c
before	c
buying	c
,	i
so	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
go	c
back	c
to	c
the	c
shop	c
.	c

Thirdly	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
choosen	i
Sailing	c
and	c
Photography	c
from	c
the	c
list	c
you	c
gave	c
me	c
because	c
both	c
of	c
them	c
are	c
my	c
favorite	i
hobbies	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
enjoying	c
Sailing	c
and	c
Photography	c
for	c
several	c
years	c
so	c
I	c
am	c
quite	c
good	c
at	c
both	c
of	c
them	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
ask	i
you	c
whether	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
prepare	c
any	c
speacial	i
clothes	c
for	c
camping	c
or	c
the	i
camp	i
will	i
provide	c
them	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
receiving	c
the	c
details	c
of	i
travelling	i
soon	c
and	c
joining	i
your	c
camp	c
in	c
July	c
.	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
not	c
only	c
a	i
good	c
fun	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
new	c
fashions	c
and	c
things	c
but	c
also	i
decrease	i
the	c
money	i
in	c
my	c
pocket	c
.	c

Sometime	i
shopping	c
does	c
n't	c
give	i
anything	c
to	i
you	c
but	c
always	i
waste	i
all	c
your	c
free	c
time	c
.	c

It	c
seems	c
to	c
me	c
that	c
more	c
people	c
in	c
my	c
hometown	c
tend	c
to	c
go	c
shopping	c
in	c
their	c
free	c
time	c
because	c
the	c
shopping	c
complexs	i
nowadays	c
are	c
more	c
attractive	c
and	c
combine	c
every	c
facilities	i
inside	c
.	c

From	c
my	c
point	c
of	c
view	c
,	c
someone	c
goes	c
shopping	c
just	c
because	c
he/she	c
wants	c
to	c
show	c
off	c
that	c
he/she	c
is	c
wealthy	c

Keeping	c

between	c
daily	c

and	c

life	c
may	c

more	c
enjoyable	c
rather	c
than	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
service	c
you	i
'd	i
offered	i
me	c
last	c
Saturday	c
evening	c
at	c
The	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
.	c

I	i
've	i
read	c
your	c
advertisement	c
and	c
it	c
did	c
n't	c
say	i
the	c
truth	c
.	c

There	c
were	c
n't	c
any	c
discount	i
available	c
as	c
you	c
'd	c
assured	c
in	i
the	c
add	i
.	c

I	c
think	c
you	c
should	c
check	c
the	c
information	c
before	c
print	i
it	c
!	c

I	c
arrived	c
at	c
the	c
right	c
time	c
(	c
19.30	c
)	c
that	c
evening	c
but	c
the	c
play	c
,	c
which	c
was	c
'	c
Over	c
The	c
Rainbow	c
'	c
,	c
started	c
almost	c
an	c
hour	c
later	i
.	c

Why	c
did	c
n't	c
you	c
say	c
something	c
about	c
it	c
?	c

I	c
did	c
n't	c
have	c
the	c
'	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
'	c
you	c
'd	c
promised	c
so	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
ask	c
for	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
because	c
your	c
service	c
was	c
terrible	c
.	c

Please	c
answer	c
my	c
letter	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c
.	c

I	c
'll	c
be	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c

Yours	c

I	c
did	c
n't	c
have	c
a	c
computer	c
until	c
I	c
was	c
eight	c
.	c

Then	c
my	c
brother	c
and	c
I	c
started	c
to	c
develop	c
a	c
new	c
ability	c
.	c

In	i
that	c
time	c
I	c
used	c
the	c
computer	c
only	c
to	c
play	c
with	i
its	i
video	c
games	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
was	c
thirteen	c
I	c
discovered	c
a	c
completely	c
different	c
use	c
for	c
my	c
computer	c
.	c

It	c
became	c
scencial	i
to	c
do	i
my	c
homework	c
.	c

And	c
years	c
later	c
it	c
enabled	c
me	c
to	c
get	c
a	c
very	c
good	c
job	c
.	c

She	c
had	c
to	c
be	c
operated	c
on	c
and	c
my	c
family	c
and	c
I	c
were	c
very	c
scared	c
.	c

But	c
when	c
we	c
talked	c
to	c
the	c
doctor	c
we	c
felt	c
more	c
relaxed	c
because	c
he	c
answered	i
us	c
that	c
the	c
operation	c
was	c
a	c
very	c
simple	c
one	c
.	c

The	i
modern	i
technology	c
is	c
better	c
now	c
than	c
what	i
it	c
used	c
to	c
be	c
.	c

Now	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
have	c
your	c
point	c
of	c
view	c

However	i
it	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
,	c
people	c
are	c
shopping	c
more	c
and	c
more	c
,	i
it	i
is	c
very	c
fashionable	c
those	i
times	i

Enjoying	c
shopping	c
is	c
n't	c
the	i
reason	c
for	c
doing	c
that	i

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
Over	c

.	c

Not	c
only	c
was	c
the	c
show	c
late	c
and	c
awful	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
expensive	c
too	c
.	c

The	c
advertisement	c
said	c
there	c
were	c
discounts	c
available	c
but	c
when	c
we	c
arrived	c
there	c
the	c
woman	c
who	c
sells	c
the	c
tickets	c
told	c
us	c
the	c
discounts	c
were	c
only	c
available	c
on	c
Monday	c
evenings	c
.	c

Despite	c
the	c
terrible	c
evening	c
we	c
decided	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
to	c
relax	c
and	c
have	c
dinner	c
,	c
but	c
we	c
found	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
its	c
floor	c
was	c
being	c
repaired	c

I	c
look	c

from	c
you	c

Dear	c
Sirs	c

We	c
are	c
writting	i
to	c
you	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
,	c
we	i
saw	c
last	c
week	c
in	c
your	c
Theatre	c
.	c

We	c
have	c
spent	c
a	c
week	c
's	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
and	c
wanted	c
to	c
see	c
a	c
musical	c
show	i
.	c

We	c
read	c
an	c
advertisement	c
about	c
your	c
musical	i
show	c
,	c
starred	i
by	i
the	c
well-known	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
in	i
a	c
local	c
newspaper	c

We	c
were	c
very	c
disappointed	c
to	c
hear	c
that	c
the	c
actor	c
was	c
replaced	c
by	c
other	i
at	i
the	c
last	c
minute	c
.	c

Yours	c
Sincerely	c

How	c
has	c
modern	c
technology	c
changed	c
your	c
daily	c
life	c
?	c

Could	c
you	c
figure	c
out	c
how	c
your	c
life	c
will	i
be	c
without	c
all	i
the	i
modern	c
technology	c
?	c

Were	c
the	i
people	c
happier	c
in	c
a	i
past	c
than	c
to	i
day	i
?	c

Nowadays	c
,	c
the	i
technology	c
takes	c
a	i
large	c
place	i
in	i
your	c
daily	c
life	c
and	c
improves	c
the	c
speed	c
of	c
the	i
achievement	i
.	c

The	i
cars	i
are	c
able	c
to	c
reach	c
300	i
km	i
per	i
hours	i
speed	i
and	c
are	c
more	c
reliable	c
than	c
in	c
the	c
past	c
.	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
all	c
the	c
improvements	c
have	i
a	i
price	i
to	i
pay	i
;	i
The	i
condition	c
of	c
the	c
environement	i
.	c

We	c
are	c
too	c
reliable	i
at	i
technology	c
today	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
if	c
you	c
go	c
to	c
a	c
play	c
and	c
you	c
are	c
watching	c
to	c
see	c
your	c
favourite	c
actor	c
playing	c
a	c
good	c
play	i
and	c
then	c
appears	i
a	c
silly	c
one	c
,	c
who	c
does	c
n't	c
know	c
what	c
to	c
do	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
disappoint	i
at	i
all	i
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
all	i
the	i
spectators	i
were	c
waiting	c
the	i
begining	i
of	c
the	c
play	c
at	c
19.30	c
and	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
20.15	c
then	i
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
why	c
do	i
you	c
say	c
one	c
time	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
why	i
do	i
you	c
do	c
what	c
you	c
want	c
.	c

Another	c
thing	c
that	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
know	c
is	c
why	c
you	c
did	c
n't	c
do	i
any	c
discount	c
if	i
it	i
was	c
showed	i
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
.	c

Maybe	c
,	c
I	i
could	i
be	i
a	c
good	c
way	c
to	c
get	c
spectators	i
but	c
I	c
'm	c
going	c
to	c
comunicate	i
that	i
to	i
my	c
travel	c
office	i
.	c

When	c
the	c
play	c
was	c
finished	c
I	c
was	c
looking	c
for	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
like	i
on	i
the	i
paper	i
that	i
was	i
on	i
the	i
door	i
was	i
writen	i
,	c
it	c
was	c
too	c
late	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

All	i
started	c
when	c
she	c
was	c
fifteen	c
,	c
when	c
started	i
a	c
new	c
course	c
on	i
the	c
institute	c
and	c
met	c
some	c
girls	c
that	c
passed	i
the	i
time	c
they	i
would	c
became	i
her	c
friends	c
.	c

Three	c
years	c
passed	c
and	c
like	i
is	c
normal	c
between	c
friends	c
,	c
she	c
knew	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
things	c
about	c
them	c
like	i
her	c
friends	c
knew	c
a	c
lot	c
about	c
her	c

When	c
it	c
was	c
time	c
to	c
do	i
the	c
final	c
exam	c
,	c
she	c
became	c
ill	c
and	c
she	c
could	c
n't	c
do	c
it	c
so	c
teachers	i
decided	c
to	c
allow	c
her	c
to	c
pass	c
the	c
course	c
because	c
she	c
had	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
good	c
marks	c
but	i
on	i
the	i
other	i
hand	i
the	c
principal	c
desagreeded	i
with	i
it	i
and	c
did	c
n't	c
give	c
the	i
permision	i
to	c
pass	c
her	c
.	c

She	c
had	c
to	c
repeat	c
that	c
course	c
and	c
all	c
her	c
friends	c
passed	c
and	c
like	i
is	c
usuall	i
girls	i
from	c
the	c
last	c
course	c
became	c
popular	c
.	c

I	c
saw	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
in	i
your	i
advertisment	i
in	i
my	c
holiday	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
disappointed	c
with	c
it	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
really	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
seeing	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
but	c
actually	i
,	c
starting	i
was	i
not	i
Danny	c
Brook	c
but	c
another	c
person	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
starting	i
time	c
was	c
not	c
19:30	c
but	c
20:15	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
restaurant	i
in	c
your	c
theatre	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
,	i
I	c
could	c
n't	c
eat	c
anything	c
.	c

'	c
Fashion	c
of	c
the	c
future	c
,	i

If	i
I	i
pick	i
up	i
the	i
example	c
,	c
Kimono	i
(	c
Japanese	i
traditional	i
cloth	i
)	c
will	c
wear	i
on	i
not	i
only	i
Japan	c
but	c
also	c
another	i
countries	c
in	c
generally	i
.	c

Also	c
it	i
will	i
be	i
only	i
wear	i
but	i
its	i
design	i
,	i
shape	i
might	i
take	i
in	i
casual	i
cloth	i
.	c

If	i
it	i
came	i
true	i
,	i
imagination	i
to	i
make	i
cloth	i
would	i
bigger	i
and	i
could	i
think	i
various	i
design	i
and	i

By	i
one	c
country	c
's	c
traditional	c

it	i
can	i

and	i

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
there	i
might	i
vanish	i
personality	i
(	i
character	i
)	i
of	i
each	i
country	i
.	c

However	c
,	c
thinking	i
way	i
that	i
simple	i
is	i
the	i
best	i
will	i
not	i
change	i

Dear	c

Recently	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
week	c

in	c

During	c
my	c
stay	c
I	c
went	c
to	c

Over	c

,	c
the	i
"	c
London	c

"	c

Never	c
before	c
had	c
I	c
such	i
a	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
.	c

To	c
make	c
matters	c
worse	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
at	c
20.15	c
,	c
although	c
the	c
advertisement	c
was	i
saying	i
it	c
would	c
begin	c
at	c
19.30	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
there	c
were	c
n't	c
any	c
discounts	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
pay	c
much	c
more	c
for	c
my	c
ticket	c
than	c
I	c
had	c
expected	c
.	c

You	c
can	c
imagine	c
how	c
upset	c
I	c
am	c
at	c
having	c
suffered	c
such	c
discomfort	c
and	c
disappointment	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
n't	c
a	c
"	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
"	c
at	c
all	c
!	c

Otherwise	c
I	c
'll	c

as	c
it	i
was	c
expected	c
so	i

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c

Computers	c
,	c
radio	c
,	c
CD	i
's	i
,	c
sattelite	i
television	c
and	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
other	c
things	c
have	c
changed	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
.	c

Modern	c
technology	c
affects	c
the	c
way	c
things	c
are	c
done	c
and	c
many	c
aspects	c
in	i
my	c
life	c
,	c
and	c
it	c
has	c
some	c
advantages	c
as	c
some	i
disadvantages	c
.	c

And	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
even	c
think	c
about	i
how	i
it	c
would	c
be	c
not	i
having	c
a	c
computer	c
.	c

Another	c
advatage	i
is	c
that	c
,	c
for	c
example	c
sattelite	i
television	c
,	c
which	c
is	c
an	c
example	c
of	c
modern	c
technology	c
,	c
makes	i
me	c
be	i
informed	c
about	c
what	c
is	c
happening	c
on	i
the	c
whole	c
world	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
admit	c
that	c
technology	c
makes	c
things	c
so	c
easy	c
that	c
when	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
do	c
them	c
without	c
it	c
I	c
find	c
it	c
very	c
difficult	c

In	c
addition	c
to	c
that	c
,	c
technology	c
does	i
n't	i
sometimes	i
let	c
me	c
develop	c
my	c
imagination	c
and	c
creative	c
skills	c
.	c

To	c
sump	i
up	c
,	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
think	c
about	i
how	i
my	c

June	c
,	c
the	c
13th	c
2000	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Ryan	c
,	c

You	c
can	c
guess	c
how	c
an	i
enjoyable	i
surprise	i
receiving	c
your	c
letter	c
was	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
must	c
precise	i
that	c
I	c
can	c
only	c
leave	c
during	c
the	c
month	c
of	c
July	c
owing	c
to	c
the	i
job	c
I	c
obtained	i
for	c
August	c
.	c

After	c
considering	c
your	c
accomodation	i
offers	c
,	c
I	c
'd	c
rather	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
if	c
possible	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
I	c
must	c
recognize	i
that	c
the	c
activities	c
offered	c
are	c
really	c
attractive	c
so	c
it	c
's	c
hard	c
to	c
make	c
up	c
my	c
mind	c
.	c

Therefore	c
,	c
the	c
film	c
will	c
manage	c
to	c
be	c
a	c
success	c
if	c
it	c
does	c
n't	c
forget	c
the	c
main	c
times	i
that	c
make	c
our	c
life	c
.	c

It	c
would	c
not	c
only	c
emphasize	c
the	c
sharp	c
contrast	c
with	i
the	i
classroom	c
atmosphear	i
but	c
also	c
show	c
how	c
they	c
are	c
as	c
young	c
people	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
two	c
moments	c
could	c
have	c
a	c
role	c
.	c

Then	c
,	c
the	c
opposite	c
situation	c
,	c
that	c
is	c
to	c
say	c
the	c
scene	i
of	c
this	c
crowd	c
disappearing	c
at	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
the	c
day	c
can	c
make	i
a	c
parallel	i
.	c

Dear	c
sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

At	i
first	i
,	c
the	c
advertisement	c
said	c
that	c
there	c
were	c
discounts	c
availables	i
,	c
but	c
when	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
buy	c
the	c
tickets	c
there	c
were	c
not	c
any	c
discounts	c
.	c

As	c
if	c
this	c
was	c
not	c
enough	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
instead	c
of	c
starting	c
at	c
half	c
past	c
seven	c
as	c
the	c
advertisement	c
said	c
,	c
started	c
at	c
a	c
quarter	c
past	c
eight	c
and	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
main	c
actors	c
,	c
who	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
be	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
was	c
someone	c
else	c
.	c

You	c
can	c
imagine	c
how	c
dissappointed	i
I	c
felt	c
after	c
that	c
evening	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
for	c
a	c
further	i
return	i
of	c
part	c
of	c
the	c
money	c
.	c

In	c
music	c
,	c
before	c
having	i
a	c
computer	c
I	c
could	c
only	c
write	c
my	c
compositions	c
and	c
'	c
listen	c
'	c
to	c
them	c
into	i
my	c
mind	c
,	c
because	c
,	c
of	c
course	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
n't	c
got	c
an	c
orchestra	c
to	c
play	c
them	c
,	c
but	c
now	c
I	c
just	i
can	i
record	c
one	c
part	c
,	c
and	c
then	c
another	c
part	c
,	c
and	c
then	c
another	c
one.	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
happily	c
received	c
your	c
reply	c
letter	i
and	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
this	c
marvelous	i
prize	c
you	c
have	c
given	c
me	c
.	c

Would	c
$	c
200	c
be	c
enough	c
?	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

The	c
concert	c
began	c
at	c
8:00	c
p.m	c
but	c
my	c
friends	c
and	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
be	c
there	c
by	c
2:00	c
pm	c
to	c
help	c
set	c
up	c
the	c
stage	c
.	c

We	c
started	c
by	c
putting	c
up	c
the	c
lights	c
.	c

We	c
had	c
to	c
climb	c
up	c
to	c
15m	c
to	c
put	c
up	c
those	c
lights	c
and	c
afterwards	c
the	c
band	c
did	c
n't	c
even	c
use	c
them	c
.	c

They	c
were	c
extremely	c
heavy	c
and	c
there	c
were	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
them	c
on	c
the	c
bus	c
.	c

I	c
'll	c
never	c
wash	c
my	c
hands	i
again	c
.	c

Well	c
that	c
's	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
I	c
've	c
got	c
for	c
you	c
now	c
.	c

Hope	c
to	c
hear	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

Basilio	c
Romero	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Redford	c
,	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
problems	c
which	c
were	i
shown	i
at	c
the	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
musical	c
show	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
advertisement	c
I	c
read	c
that	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
started	i
in	c
the	c
show	c
but	c
when	c
I	c
got	c
there	c
I	c
realised	c
there	c
was	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
in	c
his	c
place	c
whose	c
acting	c
was	c
n't	c
good	c
enough	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
also	c
read	c
that	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
start	c
at	c
19:30	c
but	c
it	c
did	c
n't	c
.	c

It	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
leaving	c
us	c
writing	i
for	c
fourty	i
five	c
minutes	c
.	c

You	c
have	c
also	c
advertised	c
that	c
there	c
would	c
be	c
discounts	c
available	c
but	c
there	c
were	c
n't	c
and	c
that	c
we	c
could	c
visit	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
they	c
were	c
redecorating	c
it	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
are	c
the	c
manager	c
of	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
you	c
should	c
try	c
to	c
avoid	c
this	i
sort	i
of	c
problems	c
in	c
future	c
shows	c
.	c

I	c
also	c
ask	c
to	i
return	c
me	i
some	c
of	c
my	c
money	c
for	c
the	c
unpleasant	c
evening	c
I	c
passed	i
at	c
your	c
show	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
future	c
people	c
will	c
wear	c
clothes	c
made	c
of	c
polyseer	i
and	c
nylon	c
because	c
cotton	c
and	c
wool	c
will	c
be	c
rare	c
and	c
expensive	c
.	c

Also	c
I	c
think	c
clothes	c
will	c
have	c
many	c
gadgets	c
on	c
them	c
like	c
a	c
small	c
oxygen	c
mask	c
in	c
case	c
someone	c
goes	c
in	c
a	c
place	c
with	c
extended	i
pollution	c
-	c
I	c
think	c
there	c
will	c
be	c
many	c
such	c
places	c
in	c
a	c
hundred	c
years	c
-	c
and	c
a	c
hat	c
designed	c
to	c
protect	c
people	c
from	c
the	c
strong	c
sunrays	i
of	c
the	c
sun	c
at	c
midday	c
because	c
the	c
ozone	c
layer	c
will	c
be	c
destroyed	c
in	c
a	c
hundred	c
years	c
and	c
the	c
sunrays	c
will	c
make	i
damage	c
to	c
the	c
human	c
skin	c
.	c

Also	c
the	c
clothes	c
in	c
a	c
hundred	c
years	c
will	c
have	c
the	c
ability	c
to	c
cool	c
down	c
the	c
people	c
who	c
wear	c
them	c
in	c
the	c
summer	c
and	c
the	c
same	c
clothes	c
will	c
keep	c
them	c
warm	c
in	i
cold	c
winters	c
'	c
days	c
.	c

The	c
place	c
I	c
'd	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
is	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
,	c
where	c
I	c
'm	c
sure	c
I	c
'd	c
feel	c
more	c
confortable	i
than	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
very	c
nice	c
of	c
you	c
to	c
let	c
me	c
choose	c
my	c
favourite	c
activities	c
.	c

The	c
ones	c
I	c
'm	c
most	c
keen	c
on	c
are	c
Tennis	i
,	c
in	i
which	c
I	c
think	c
I	c
'm	c
pretty	c
good	c
since	c
I	c
took	c
some	c
classes	c
last	c
year	c
,	c
and	c
Painting	i
,	c
which	c
is	c
one	c
of	c
my	c
favourite	c
hobbies	c
,	c
and	c
helps	c
me	c
to	c
relax	c
myself	i
and	c
forget	c
about	c
problems	c
.	c

Anyway	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
some	c
questions	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
:	c
What	i
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
would	c
be	c
the	c
most	c
suitable	c
for	c
California	c
weather	c
in	c
summer	c
,	c
and	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
do	c
you	c
think	c
I	c
'll	c
need	c
?	c

I	c
'm	c
waiting	i
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

As	c
I	c
told	c
you	c
in	c
my	c
last	c
letter	c
,	c
last	c
month	c
I	c
worked	c
for	c
a	c
pop	c
band	c
,	c
and	c
helped	c
them	c
at	c
a	c
concert	c
in	c
Barcelona	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
such	c
a	c
great	c
experience	c
!	c

Basically	c
my	c
work	c
was	c
carrying	c
the	c
instruments	c
,	c
the	c
speakers	c
and	c
the	c
lights	c
from	c
the	c
vans	c
to	c
the	c
stage	c
,	c
which	c
is	c
not	c
an	i
easy	c
work	c
because	c
,	c
as	c
you	c
can	c
imagine	c
,	c
it	c
's	c
not	c
exactly	c
light	c
stuff	c
.	c

I	c
'd	c
better	c
leave	i
now	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
write	c
again	c
soon	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
happy	c
to	c
win	c
this	c
prize	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
going	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
some	c
information	c
from	i
me	i
that	i
you	i
need	i
to	c
make	i
me	i
have	c
a	c
good	c
time	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
.	c

I	i
want	i
if	i
it	i
is	i
possible	i
a	c
log	i
cabins	i
like	i
accommodation	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
suffering	c
from	i
my	c
back	c
since	c
my	c
childhood	c
,	c
therefore	c
I	c
need	c
a	c
confortable	i
accommodation	i
.	c

I	c
will	c
be	c
pleased	c
to	c
swim	c
and	c
paint	c
when	c
I	c
am	c
at	c
the	c
camp	c
.	c

I	c
selected	c
swimming	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
cure	c
against	i
my	c
backace	i
and	c
I	c
have	c
not	c
practiced	i
since	i
I	c
started	c
my	c
new	c
job	c
five	c
years	c
ago	c
.	c

I	c
also	c
choosed	i
painting	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
done	c
before	i
,	i
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
learn	c
and	c
moreover	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
do	c
a	c
calm	i
activity	c
.	c

Otherwise	i
,	i
could	i
you	c
tell	c
me	c
approximately	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
for	c
the	i
food	c

please	c

Sometimes	c
,	c
they	c
are	c
happy	c
to	c
do	i
shopping	c
.	i

Shopping	c
is	c
enjoyable	c
when	c
you	c
want	c
to	c
offer	i
some	i
thing	i
to	c
someone	c
.	c

Shopping	c
is	c
also	c
good	c
,	i
when	c
you	c
know	c
what	c
you	c
want	c
.	c

In	i
the	i
opposite	i
,	c
shopping	c
can	c
be	c
disenjoyable	i

That	c
is	c
to	c
say	c
,	c
they	c
are	c
never	c
happy	c
with	c
what	c
they	c
get	c
and	i
see	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
enjoyable	c
with	c
people	c
who	c
just	c
look	c
around	c
the	c
shops	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
stupid	c
,	i
they	i
do	c
not	c

any	c
goal	c

Even	c
if	c
I	c
like	c
to	c
do	i
shopping	c
with	c
some	c
people	c
and	c
kind	i
of	c
shops	c
I	c
will	c
kill	c
myself	c
because	i
I	c
waste	c
my	c
time	c

This	c
show	c
is	c
a	c
good	c
opportunity	c
to	c
know	i
the	c

topics	i
like	i
make	i
up	i
,	c
Hairstyles	i
and	c
leisure	c
and	c
sports	c

We	c
think	c
that	c
it	c
could	c
be	c
a	c
great	c
chance	c
in	i
order	i
to	c
know	i
British	c
fashion	c
and	c
probably	c
it	c
would	c
give	c
us	c
good	c

This	c

June	c

Referring	c
to	c
the	c
possibilities	c
of	c
accommodation	c
,	c
I	c
'd	c
prefer	c
log	c
cabins	c
to	c
tents	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
log	c
cabins	c
are	c
more	c
comportable	i
than	c
tents	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
do	c
not	c
like	c
tents	c
.	c

Last	i
not	i
least	i
,	c
I	c
always	c
have	c
backache	c
after	c
sleeping	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
for	c
a	c
couple	c
of	c
days	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
never	c
played	c
Golf	c
actually	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
would	c
love	c
to	c
try	c
something	c
new	c
.	c

As	c
for	c
singing	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
keen	c
on	c
singing	c
as	c
I	c
get	i
lessons	c
in	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
whether	c
there	c
is	i
some	c
facilities	c
for	c
washing	c
the	i
Clothes	c
.	c

If	c
not	c
,	c
I	c
will	c
have	c
to	c
bring	c
some	c
with	c
me	c
.	c

Is	c
there	c
a	c
possibility	c
of	c
exchanging	c
different	c
currancies	i
to	c
US	c
dollar	i
?	c

It	c
sounds	c
nice	c
and	c
shopping	c
is	c
great	c
fun	c
-	c
or	c
it	c
should	c
be	c
.	c

Nowadays	c
shopping	c
can	c
be	c
very	c
stressful	c
.	c

Nevertheless	c
,	c
the	c
nightmare	c
starts	c
when	c
you	c
enter	c
the	c
shopping	c
mall	c
or	c
the	c
passage	c
,	c
which	c
is	c
terribly	c
crowded	c
.	c

You	c
cannot	c
make	c
a	c
step	c
without	c
"	c
touching	c
"	c
the	i
others	c
.	c

It	c
gets	c
enormously	c
unbearable	c
in	i
hot	c
summer	c
days	c
,	c
when	c
the	c
temperature	c
increases	c
.	c

In	c
such	c
a	c
situation	c
your	c
friends	c
or	c
the	c
people	c
you	c
are	c
shopping	c
with	c
get	c
lost	c
very	c
easily	c
and	c
looking	c
for	c
them	c
can	c
be	c
very	c
tiring	c
.	c

Of	c
course	c
,	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
so	c
unpleasant	c
,	c
but	c
sometimes	c
it	c
is	c
simply	c
better	c
to	c
stay	c
at	c
home	c
.	c

Last	c
week	c
I	i
and	i
my	i
family	i
had	c
a	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

At	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
a	i
holiday	c
we	c
decided	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
.	c

I	c
insisted	c
on	c
going	c
to	c
your	c
theatre	c
,	c
to	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
heard	c
that	c
it	c
is	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
best	c
theatres	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

how	i
you	c
have	c
written	c
at	i
the	c
advertisement	c
:	c
it	c
is	c
the	i
London	c
's	c
newest	c
and	c
best	c
musical	c
show	c
.	c

And	c
he	c
played	i
awful	i
,	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
hear	c
him	c
.	c

Then	c
at	i
the	c
adverstisement	i
stood	i
that	c
performance	i
begin	i
at	c
19.30	c
.	c

I	i
and	i
my	i
family	i
came	c
to	i
that	c
time	c
and	c
had	c
to	c
wait	c
till	c
20:15	c
,	c
because	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
only	c
at	c
that	c
time	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
nervious	i
.	c

What	c
is	c
more	c
you	i
wrote	c
that	c
discounts	c
available	i
,	c
but	c
it	i
was	c
also	c
lie	i
.	c

After	c
the	c
show	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
disappointed	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
spent	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
money	c
for	c
nothing	c
and	c
my	c
husband	c
decided	c
to	c
make	i
me	i
a	i
pleasure	i
.	c

He	c
suggested	c
to	i
have	i
a	i
supper	c
in	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
.	c

But	c
when	c
we	c
came	i
to	c
it	c
,	c
we	c
saw	c
that	c
the	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
,	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
reconstructed	i
.	c

So	c
this	c
evening	c
was	c
terriable	i
.	c

It	c
broke	i
all	c
my	c
impression	c
about	i
London	c
.	c

And	c
now	c
I	c
requere	i
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

Because	c
of	i
nothing	i
what	i
was	i
mentioned	i
at	i
the	i
advertisement	i
I	i
did	i
n't	i
get	i
.	c

There	c
are	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
new	c
modern	c
technologies	c
around	c
the	c
world	c
,	c
which	c
appear	i
not	c
long	c
ago	c
.	c

Among	c
them	c
a	i
mobile	c
telephone	c
,	c
computers	c
,	c
telefaxes	c
,	c
different	c
mashiens	i
for	c
kitchen	i
,	c
mashiens	i
which	c
helps	i
housekeeper	i
to	c
do	c
any	c
work	c
about	c
the	c
house	c
.	c

All	c
of	c
them	c
play	c
a	c
very	c
great	c
role	c
in	c
people	c
's	c
daily	c
life	c
.	c

The	c
first	c
change	c
is	c
that	c
they	c
very	i
simplify	c
the	c
life	c
of	c
people	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
now	c
women	c
do	c
n't	c
spend	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
time	c
at	i
the	c
kitchen	c
,	c
preparing	c
the	c
meal	c
or	c
washing	c
up	i
dishes	c
.	c

The	c
computer	c
also	c
plays	c
a	c
very	c
important	c
role	c
in	c
daily	i
life	c
of	c
people	c
.	c

Some	c
years	c
ago	c
people	c
especially	i
students	c
had	i
to	c
run	c
to	c
lubraries	i
in	c
order	c
to	c
find	c
a	c
book	c
about	c
something	c
.	c

But	c
now	c
they	c
can	c
use	c
Internet	i
,	c
where	c
you	c
can	c
find	c
any	c
information	c
you	c
need	c
.	c

If	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
say	c
something	c
important	c
to	c
my	c
parents	c
or	c
my	c
friends	c
,	c
of	i
if	c
something	c
terriable	i
has	c
happened	c
with	i
me	c
,	c
I	c
may	i
not	i
run	c
somewhere	c
to	c
find	c
a	c
telephone	c
box	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
say	c
that	c
modern	c
technologies	i
very	i
help	i
people	c
at	i
their	c
works	i
.	c

With	c
them	i
people	c
do	c
their	c
work	c
more	c
quikly	i
and	c
successfully	c
.	c

During	c
a	c
week	c
's	c
holiday	c
I	c
had	c
in	c
London	c
,	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
see	c
your	c
last	c
musical	c
show	c
called	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
"	c
at	c
The	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
.	c

I	c
saw	c
an	c
advertising	i
which	c
seemed	i
very	c
atractive	i
to	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
a	c
very	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
for	c
many	c
reasons	c
.	c

Another	c
thing	c
was	c
the	c
hours	i
.	c

It	c
's	c
enbelievable	i
to	i
be	i
late	i
with	i
45	i
minutes	i
.	c

When	c
I	c
got	c
to	c
the	c
tickets	i
desk	i
before	c
the	c
show	c
to	c
buy	c
my	c
ticket	c
I	c
asked	c
for	c
a	c
senior	c
discount	c
,	c
and	c
the	c
woman	c
told	c
me	c
there	c
were	c
no	c
discounts	c
available	c
as	i
I	c
read	i
on	c
the	c
advertising	i
.	c

After	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
restaurant	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
drink	c
after	c
all	c
of	c
these	c
disappointments	c
,	c
but	c
the	c
doors	c
were	c
close	c
because	c
of	c
renovations	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
you	c
will	c
understand	c
it	i
was	c
not	c
"	c
my	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
"	c
as	c
you	c
said	c
,	c
but	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
worth	i
.	c

Best	c
Regards	c
,	c

Once	c
I	c
was	c
on	c
vacation	c
with	c
her	c
in	c
America	c
,	c
in	c
Chicago	c
to	c
be	c
exact	c
.	c

We	c
spent	c
three	c
weeks	c
over	c
there	c
,	c
the	c
weather	c
was	c
great	c
,	c
the	c
people	c
we	c
met	c
very	i
interesting	c
so	c
everything	c
was	c
perfect	c
.	c

We	c
had	i
mostly	i
a	c
wonderful	c
time	c
.	c

We	c
went	c
there	c
3	c
years	c
ago	c
and	c
I	c
had	i
only	c
19	c
years	c
old	c
as	i
everyone	c
know	i
that	i
the	c
majority	i
for	i
beeing	i
able	c
to	c
go	c
out	c
in	c
the	c
USA	c
is	i
21	c
years	c
old	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
do	i
n't	i
have	c
the	i
majority	c
your	i
are	c
n't	c
allowed	c
to	c
drink	c
or	c
smoke	c
,	c
or	c
even	i
worth	i
to	i
go	c
in	i
a	c
bar	c
.	c

At	c
the	c
entrance	c
,	c
the	c
security	c
guard	c
asked	c
for	c
identity	i
card	c
,	c
Pat	c
gave	c
hers	c
and	c
told	c
him	c
that	c
I	i
've	i
forgot	i
it	c
home	i
.	c

The	c
man	c
said	c
it	c
was	c
OK	c
for	i
this	c
time	c
and	c
we	c
get	i
in	c
quite	c
easely	i
,	c
we	i
've	i
made	c
it	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
such	c
a	i
fun	c
,	c
we	c
met	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
different	c
people	c
,	c
we	c
danced	c
,	c
we	c
had	c
a	c
wonderful	c
time	c
.	c

We	c
went	c
at	i
the	c
bar	c
and	c
ask	i
for	c
drink	i
with	i
alcohol	i
.	c

The	c
barman	c
asked	c
me	c
my	c
age	c
and	c
Pat	c
told	c
him	c
without	c
thinking	c
any	i
time	i
19	c
years	c
old	c
!	c

The	c
manager	c
came	c
,	c
he	c
called	c
the	c
police	c
and	c
the	c
beginning	c
of	c
a	c
great	c
evening	c
,	i
ending	i
with	c
a	c
night	c
in	c
jail	c
and	c
an	c
expensive	c
fine	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
,	c

While	c
I	i
'll	i
be	i
at	c
the	c
Camp	i
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
play	c
tennis	c
and	c
swimming	i
.	c

If	c
possible	c
,	c
could	c
you	c
let	c
me	c
know	c
what	c
I	c
'll	c
need	c
for	i
example	c
which	i
clothes	c
I	c
must	c
take	c
and	c
how	c
much	c
I	c
can	c
expect	c
to	c
spend	c
.	i

I	c
'm	c
excited	c
to	c
go	i
on	c
holliday	i
there	c
and	c
thanks	i
to	c
you	c
,	c
I	c
will	c
realize	c
a	c
dream	c
that	i
I	i
always	i
wanted	i
to	i
do	i
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
about	c
my	i
good	c
experience	c
I	c
had	c
last	c
month	c
.	c

At	c
first	c
,	c
I	i
'd	i
helped	i
them	c
to	c
carry	c
the	c
material	i
and	c
we	c
had	i
fixed	i
everything	c
in	c
the	c
good	i
order	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
astonished	c
to	c
see	c
so	i
friendly	c
and	c
funny	c
they	c
were	c
and	c
we	c
got	i
good	c
friends	c
.	c

How	c
stupid	c
of	c
me	c
!	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
in	i
the	c
advertisement	c
was	i
written	c
,	c
as	c
I	c
had	c
read	c
that	i
before	c
,	c
that	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
would	c
be	c
starring	c
in	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
the	i
different	c
actor	c
stood	c
in	c
for	c
in	i
it	i
.	c

The	i
time	i
of	i
the	i
beginning	i
of	i
the	i
show	i
was	c
written	c
at	i
half	c
past	c
two	c
p.m.	c
and	c
at	i
half	c
past	c
seven	c
that	c
evening	c
,	c
again	c
.	c

And	c
unfortunately	c
again	c
,	c
from	i
some	c
reasons	i
it	i
was	c
postponed	i
to	i
quarter	c
past	c
eight	c
.	c

According	c
to	c
the	c
advertisement	c
,	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
anyone	c
could	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
for	c
a	c
drink	c
.	c

That	c
's	c
why	c
I	c
write	i
my	c
letter	c
to	c
you	c
and	c
I	c
ask	i
for	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

Yours	c
faitully	i

They	c
could	c
not	c
communicate	c
with	c
someone	c
living	c
in	c
other	i
country	c
,	c
often	i
located	c
far	c
away	c
from	c
his	i
own	c
.	c

Using	c
mobile	c
phones	c
,	c
e-mails	c
or	c
internet	i
,	c
we	c
have	c
a	i
better	c
access	c
to	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
different	c
news	i
.	c

I	c
think	c
,	i
we	c
are	c
more	c
addicted	c
to	c
do	i
some	c
things	c
,	i
which	c
are	c
not	c
concerned	c
with	c
human	c
nature	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
really	c
mind	c
them	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
think	c
and	c
strongly	c
believe	c
,	i
that	c
we	c
are	c
the	i
part	c
of	c
wildlife	i
.	c

It	c
's	c
a	c
good	c
programme	c
,	c
especially	c
the	c
visit	c
to	c
the	c
National	c
Art	c
Gallery	c
.	c

A	c
few	c
students	c
and	c
me	i
have	c
heard	c
about	c
a	c
fashion	c
and	c
leisure	c
show	c
.	c

That	i
show	c
takes	c
place	c
on	c
14th	c
March	c
from	c
10.00	c
-	c
19.00	c
.	c

They	c
show	i
the	c
latest	c
fashion	c
,	c
leisure	c
and	c
sportswear	c
ands	i
something	c
for	c
the	c
women	c
:	c
make	i
up	i
and	c
hairstyle	c
trends	c
.	c

I	c
know	c
that	c
it	c
is	i
a	c
change	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
have	c
thought	c
about	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
there	c
is	c
no	c
need	c
to	c
go	c
shopping	c
because	c
we	c
can	c
do	c
our	c
shopping	c
in	c
Cambridge	c
,	i
as	i
well	i
.	c

Who	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
be	c
famous	c
?	c

Are	i
you	i
dreaming	i
of	c
being	c
a	c
Star	i
?	c

It	c
must	c
be	c
wonderful	c
when	c
you	c
have	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
money	c
and	c
everybody	c
seems	c
to	c
know	c
you	c
.	c

Really	i
?	c

I	c
think	c
the	c
main	c
problem	c
is	c
that	c
you	c
would	c
lose	c
your	c
private	c
life	c
.	c

That	c
's	c
the	c
price	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
pay	c
nowadays	c
.	c

No	c
one	c
told	c
you	c
to	c
be	c
famous	c
.	c

Of	c
course	c
you	c
have	c
fame	c
and	c
poverty	i
.	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
I	i
think	c
,	i
if	c
you	c
well-known	i
you	c
have	c
to	c
deal	c
with	c
that	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
,	c

Besides	c
,	i
we	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c

For	c
Everyone	c
.	c

They	c
feel	c
exhausted	c
to	i
be	i
followed	c
by	c
journalists	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
some	c
people	c
need	c
journalists	c
to	c
be	i
more	c
famous	c
,	c
because	c
people	c
can	i
have	i
news	i
who	i
are	i
famous	i
through	c
journalists	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
unpleasent	i
evening	c
I	c
have	c
spent	i
recently	c
.	c

Ealyer	i
I	c
had	c
seen	c
an	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
show	c
but	c
the	c
informationes	i
on	c
it	c
caused	i
fals	i
.	c

The	c
second	c
think	i
is	c
that	c
the	c
play	c
did	c
not	c
start	c
at	c
19:30	c
but	c
at	c
20:15	c
!	c

I	c
could	c
not	c
get	c
a	c
discount	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
told	c
that	c
it	c
had	c
been	c
painted	c
but	c
nobody	c
had	c
written	c
it	i
on	c
an	i
advertisement	c
.	c

At	i
the	i
end	i
I	i
would	c
like	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
my	c
evening	c
out	c
two	c
days	c
before	i
was	c
not	c
perfect	c
and	c
I	c
wold	i
be	c
glad	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
pay	i
my	i
some	i
money	i
back	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
a	c
student	c
of	i
a	c
technical	c
univercity	i
.	c

Some	c
time	c
before	i
I	c
did	c
not	c
know	c
the	i
internet	i
.	c

Now	c
the	c
only	c
think	i
I	c
have	c
to	c
do	c
is	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
computer	i
room	c
and	c
turn	c
on	c
the	c
computer	c
.	c

The	c
computer	c
is	c
helpfull	i
when	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
contact	c
somebody	c
very	c
fast	c
.	c

Now	c
I	c
just	c
only	i
put	c
some	c
money	c
into	c
a	c
machine	c
and	c
I	c
can	c
take	c
the	c
card	c
from	c
there	c
!	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
in	i
behalf	c
of	c
my	c
class-	i
maid	i
about	c
the	c
programme	c
you	c
had	i
organised	c
for	c
us	c
.	c

We	c
are	c
especially	c
excited	c
about	c
the	c
river	c
trip	c
to	c
greenwich	i
which	c
will	c
be	c
in	i
the	c
first	c
day	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
particularly	c
like	c
to	c
talk	c
about	c
the	c
second	c
day	c
.	c

We	c
hope	c
you	c
accept	c
this	c
change	c
for	i
good	i
.	c

We	c
are	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

It	c
was	c
dangerous	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
knew	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
.	c

Last	c
summer	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
amazon	i
on	c
an	c
expedition	c
with	c
other	i
10	i
people	c
,	i
such	i
as	i
a	c
guide	c
,	c
a	c
doctor	c
,	c
a	c
scientist	c
&	c
all	c
the	c
rest	i
as	c
me	c
were	c
just	c
curious	c
.	c

We	c
walked	c
all	c
day	c
and	c
took	i
rest	i
in	c
the	c
evenings	c
.	c

One	c
day	c
at	c
five	c
o'clock	c
in	c
the	c
morning	c
I	c
stepped	c
out	c
of	c
my	c
tent	c
without	c
seen	i
and	c
started	c
walking	c
towards	c
the	c
river	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
want	i
take	i
some	c
photographs	c
of	c
the	c
sun	i
rise	i
.	c

I	c
was	c
petrified	c
because	c
it	c
looked	c
as	c
she	i
was	c
very	c
hungry	c
.	c

I	c
knew	c
I	c
could	c
not	c
do	i
any	c
moviment	i
for	c
my	c
safety	c
but	c
I	c
did	c
and	c
for	i
my	c
surprise	c
It	i
run	i
away	c
.	c

With	c
reference	c
to	c
your	c
letter	c
of	c
13th	i
of	c
June	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
the	c
prize	c
your	c
organisation	c
is	c
offering	c
me	c
.	c

Since	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
student	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
follow	c
the	c
vacation	c
programm	i
of	c
my	c
school	c
,	c
which	c
means	c
that	c
I	c
would	c
only	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
travel	c
during	c
the	c
month	c
of	c
July	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
be	c
grateful	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
book	c
a	c
tent	c
for	c
me	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
nature	c
lover	c
and	c
the	c
idea	c
of	c
outdoor-sleeping	i
really	c
makes	c
me	c
happy	c
.	c

Concerning	c
the	c
activities	c
,	c
as	i
a	i
matter	i
of	i
fact	i
tennis	c
is	c
my	c
favorit	i
sport	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
keen	c
on	c
it	c
,	i
for	i
the	c
second	c
activity	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
enroll	i
surfing	i
,	c
because	c
my	c
husband	c
,	c
who	c
is	c
already	c
a	c
proficient	c
,	i
keeps	c
telling	c
me	c
about	c
the	c
excitement	c
of	c
this	c
sport	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
worthwile	i
trying	c
,	c
therefore	c
I	c
'd	c
love	c
to	c
be	c
in	c
the	c
beginners	i
group	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
if	c
you	c
would	c
be	c
kind	c
enough	c
to	c
send	c
me	c
some	c
information	c
on	c
weather	c
conditions	c
for	c
that	c
period	i
of	i
time	i
,	c
the	c
kind	c
of	c
currency	c
I	c
should	c
take	c
with	c
as	i
well	c
as	c
the	c
vaccination	c
requirements	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
and	c
thank	c
you	c
in	c
advance	c
for	c
your	c
help	c
.	c

It	c
offers	c
a	c
wide	c
choice	c
of	c
courses	c
from	c
cooking	c
,	c
computer	i
,	c
make	i
up	i

Students	c
start	c
their	c
day	c
at	c
the	c
Gym	c
,	c
where	c
they	c
learn	c
the	c
importance	c
of	c
being	c
fit	c
,	c
that	c
is	c
way	i
I	c
suggest	c
to	i
film	i
this	c
activity	c
.	c

Once	c
students	c
have	c
taken	c
a	c
shower	c
after	c
a	i
hard	c
physical	c
training	c
they	c
come	i
to	i
real	c
life	c
,	i
depending	i
on	c
their	c
levels	c
they	i
have	c
to	c
study	c
for	i
instance	i
languages	c
wich	i
I	c
personally	c
find	c
very	c
important	c
for	c
a	c
person	c
working	c
in	c
the	c
tourism	c
field	i
because	c
these	i
enables	i
stuff	i
to	c
communicate	c
with	c
clients	c
in	c
a	c
proper	c
way	c
,	i
students	i
have	c
to	c
manage	c
to	c
speak	c
at	c
least	c
three	c
languages	c
.	c

Last	i
but	i
not	i
less	i
important	i
is	c
the	c
class	c
called	c
"	c
know-how	c
"	c
wich	i
shows	c
students	c
how	c
to	c
cope	c
with	c
unspected	i
problems	c
even	c
if	c
they	c
are	c
in	i
stress	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
tents	i
than	i
log	i
cabins	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
afraid	c
,	i
I	c
am	c
not	c
good	c
at	c
photography	c
but	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
improve	c
it	i
.	c

I	c
need	c
some	c
more	c
information	c
about	c
the	i
camp	c
life	c
and	c
also	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
what	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
take	c
with	c
me	c
.	c

For	c
exemple	i
,	c
how	c
much	c
pocket	c
money	c
will	c
be	c
enough	c
and	c
which	i
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
should	c
wear.	i

I	c
hope	c
to	c
receive	c
your	c

I	c

Lessons	c

It	c
is	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
most	c
popular	c
subject	i
in	c
the	c
school	c
.	c

Seeing	c
that	c
this	c
is	c
the	c
first	c
year	c
of	c
the	i
drama	c
lessons	c
,	c
it	c
is	c

Maths	c

Regarding	i
that	c
the	c
school	c
's	c
maths	c
team	c
won	c
the	i
this	c
year	c
's	c
city	i
's	i
maths	c
competition	c
and	c
is	c
going	c
to	i
the	c
national	c
school	i
's	i
maths	c
championship	c
,	c
it	c
will	i
be	c
good	i
idea	c
to	c
film	c
some	c
of	c
their	c
training	c
course	i
and	c
also	c
ordinary	c
maths	c
lesson	i
where	i
the	c
majority	c
of	c
the	c
students	c
attend	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
the	c
advertisement	c
told	i
that	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
was	c
going	c
to	c
starr	i
in	c
a	i
musical	c
but	c
it	c
turned	c
out	c
a	i
completely	c
different	c
person	c
which	i
was	c
very	c
disappointing	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
very	c
unprofessional	c
of	c
you	c
to	c
had	i
printed	i
a	i
wrong	c
starring	i
name	i
on	i
the	c
paper	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
according	c
to	c
the	c
advertisment	i
,	c
the	c
musical	c
was	c
supprsed	i
to	c
start	c
at	c
19.30	c
but	c
it	c
actually	c
started	c
at	c
20.15	c
which	i
caused	c
me	c
a	i
trouble	i
.	c

As	c
for	c
my	c
ticket	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
expecting	c
to	c
get	c
a	c
discount	c
as	c
a	c
student	c
,	c
as	c
it	c
said	c
so	i
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
,	i
however	i
,	c
it	i
was	i
not	i
actually	i
available	c
which	i
was	c
very	c
disappointing	c
again	c
.	c

With	c
all	c
the	c
dissatisfuction	i
above	c
,	c
therefore	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
for	c
some	c
of	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
as	c
my	c
evening	c
was	c
not	c
what	c
it	c
would	i
have	c
to	i
be	i
.	c

I	c
hope	c
that	c
you	c
will	c
consider	c
this	c
letter	c
seriously	i
and	c
try	c
to	c
improve	c
your	c
service	i
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

Molly	c
went	c
down	c
to	c
London	c
for	c
shopping	i
and	c
as	c
she	c
was	c
walking	c
the	i
street	c
.	c

She	c
found	i
familier	i
faces	c
on	c
the	c
other	c
side	c
of	c
the	c
street	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
Vance	c
and	c
Sally	c
whom	i
she	c
had	c
not	c
seen	c
for	c
ages	c
.	c

Pat	c
,	c
too	c
,	c
are	i
friend	i
of	c
them	i
and	c
has	c
seen	c
them	c
time	i
to	c
time	c
.	c

After	i
Molly	c
went	c
back	c
home	c
in	i
Aberdeen	c
,	c
she	c
told	c
Pat	c
that	c
she	c
had	c
met	c
Vance	c
and	c
Sally	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

Sally	c
must	c
have	c
a	c
new	c
boy	i
friend	i
'	c
.	c

As	c
Molly	c
did	c
n't	c
know	c
this	c
,	c
she	c
was	c
so	c
surprised	c
and	c
tried	c
to	c
ask	c
more	c
about	c
it	c
.	c

She	c
did	c
n't	c
mean	c
to	c
do	c
so	i
,	c
but	c
this	c
kind	c
of	c
thing	c
happens	c
a	c
lot	c
.	c

Now	c
Pat	c
is	c
feeling	c
so	c
guilty	c
about	c
what	c
she	c
has	c
done	c
because	c
Molly	c
is	c
n't	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
either	c
!	c

Everyone	c
is	c
going	c
to	c
know	c
that	c
Sally	c
has	c
been	c
cheating	c
both	c
on	c
Vance	c
and	c
her	c
new	c
boyfriend	c
and	c
the	i
Poor	i
Vance	c
is	c
always	c
the	c
last	c
person	c
to	c
know	c
it	i

it	c

I	c
would	c
rather	c

I	c

Frankly	c

if	c

Although	c

can	i

to	i

Science	c
and	c
technology	c
have	c
changed	c
man	c
's	c
life	c
:	c
that	c
's	c
true	c
,	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c

how	i
they	c
affect	c
the	c
lives	c

I	c
have	i
only	i
to	c

how	c
they	c
have	c
changed	c
my	c
life	c

It	c
's	c
incredible	c
but	c
if	c
I	c
think	c
of	c
the	c
key-word	c
of	c
mind	i
,	c
the	c
only	c
one	c
I	c
can	c
think	c

In	c
the	c
afternoon	c
I	c
stay	i
two	c
hours	c
listening	c
to	c
the	c

watching	c

instead	c
of	c
going	c
to	c
the	c

it	c
seems	c
I	c
prefer	c
staying	c
with	c

without	c

that	c

No	c

I	c
'm	c
only	c
a	c
daughter	c

Yesterday	c
my	c

asked	c
me	c
what	c
will	i
I	i
do	c
without	c

I	c

Dear	c
Mr.	c
Robertson	c
Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
good	c
programme	c
for	c
English	i
class	c
,	c
especially	c
it	i
is	c
well-organised	c
and	c
has	c
many	c
different	c
places	c
we	c
can	c
go	c
and	c
we	c
can	c
see	c
.	c

All	c
of	c
us	c
in	c
English	i
class	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
visiting	c
these	c
places	c
.	c

We	c
've	c
been	c
worried	c
about	c
our	c
future	c
career	c
and	c
we	c
believe	c
that	c
we	c
need	c
some	c
preparation	c
for	c
it	c
such	c
as	c
dress	i
and	c
hairstyle	c
for	c
an	c
interview	c
.	c

Especially	c
,	c
it	c
does	c
not	c
cost	c
at	i
all	c
for	c
students	c
.	c

But	c
the	c
only	c
problem	c
for	i
the	c
show	c
is	c
the	c
date	c
which	c
is	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
14	c
March	c
from	c
10.00	c
to	c
19.00	c
.	c

As	c
we	c
're	c
considering	c
your	c
programme	c
we	c
're	c
supposed	c
to	c
go	c
Science	i
Museum	c
and	c
shopping	c
.	c

We	c
're	c
thinking	c
that	c
we	c
can	c
go	c
to	c
these	c
place	i
the	c
next	i
following	c
day	c
.	c

But	c
Mr.	c
Robertson	c
,	c
these	c
our	i
suggestions	c
are	i
depended	i
on	c
your	c
programme	c
,	c
we	c
're	c
just	c
suggesting	c
.	c

Again	c
we	c
're	c
so	c
sorry	c
that	c
we	c
give	i
you	c
an	i
inconvience	i
for	i
your	c
plan	c
and	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
considering	c
us	c
.	c

We	c
are	c
look	i
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

The	c
Home	c
of	c
the	c
Future	c
.	c

But	c
we	c
could	c
have	c
everying	i
we	c
want	c
to	i
.	c

These	c
days	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
contries	i
have	c
been	c
worried	c
about	c
lands	i
that	i
ca	i
n't	i
have	i
enough	i
place	i
to	c
build	c
houses	c
.	c

The	c
prises	i
for	c
lands	i
are	c
getting	i
increasing	c
it	i
's	i
because	c
of	c
this	c
reason	i
.	c

But	c
what	c
my	i
imagination	i
is	c
that	c
these	c
flats	c
'll	c
have	c
many	c
functions	c
such	c
as	c
offices	c
,	c
leisure	c
centre	c
,	c
shopping	c
centre	c
even	c
school	c
.	c

Because	c
we	c
are	c
living	c
in	i
computerlised	i
life	c
,	c
so	i
we	c
'll	c
able	c
to	c
do	c
most	c
things	c
at	c
home	c
or	c
these	c
flats	c
'll	c
have	c
these	c
places	c
as	c
well	c
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
our	c
future	c
home	c
will	c
have	c
a	c
natural	c
view	i
like	c
these	i
days	i
home	i
and	c
give	c
people	c
a	c
new	c
technological	c
home	c
life	c
.	c

By	c
the	c
way	c
,	c
our	c
classmates	c
have	c
seen	c
an	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
leisure	c
show	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
,	c
make	i
up	i
and	c
hairstyles	i
shows	c
will	c
take	c
place	c
at	c
the	c
same	c
time	c
.	c

We	c
think	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
wonderful	c
chance	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
new	c
experience	c
.	c

It	c
takes	c
place	c
at	c
Central	c
Exhibition	c
hall	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

And	c
it	c
starts	c
from	c
10	c
to	c
19	c
on	c
14th	c
of	c
March	c
.	c

So	c
we	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
suggest	c
you	c
to	i
put	i
this	c
programme	i
into	c
the	c
morning	c
time	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
instead	c
of	c
Science	i
Museum	c
and	c
put	c
science	i
museum	c
into	c
free	c
time	c
on	c
Wednesday	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
will	c
consider	c
our	c
suggestion	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Our	c
homes	c
will	c
be	c
different	c
in	c
the	i
way	i
to	c
protect	c
our	c
family	c
from	c
theives	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
now	c
we	c
have	c
a	c
security	c
safety	i
like	c
a	c
bell	c
or	c
button	c
.	c

That	c
is	i
,	c
our	c
security	c
system	c
will	c
be	c
much	c
stronger	c
.	c

The	c
advertisement	c
outside	c
the	c
theatre	c
explained	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
interesting	c
things	c
to	c
enjoy	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
this	c
letter	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
had	c
a	c
very	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
.	c

Everything	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
has	c
been	c
done	c
in	c
the	c
Wrong	c
Way	c
.	c

Firstly	c
there	c
was	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
in	c
the	c
starring	c
;	i
you	c
have	i
written	c
DANNY	c
BROOK	c
and	c
he	c
was	c
absent	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
joined	i
the	c
show	c
because	c
I	c
like	c
DANNY	c
BROOK	c
a	c
lot	c
,	c
but	c
you	c
have	i
changed	c
the	c
program	i
.	c

The	c
changements	i
brought	c
by	c
modern	c
technology	c
are	c
so	c
important	c
that	c
today	c
no	c
one	c
can	c
live	c
without	c
this	c
technology	c
or	c
with	i
a	c
part	c
of	c
it	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
situation	c
for	c
example	c
cars	c
and	c
motorcycles	c
are	c
a	c
necessity	c
to	i
get	i
out	i
:	c
I	c
live	c
on	c
a	c
little	c
mountain	c
at	c
160	c
metres	c
of	i
altitud	i
so	c
I	c
cannot	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
city	c
using	c
a	c
bycicle	i
.	c

Because	c
of	c
my	c
"	c
isolation	c
"	c
telephone	i
is	c
very	c
important	c
and	c
I	c
need	c
a	c
good	c
personal	c
computer	c
with	c
a	c
modem	c
and	c
internet	i
so	i
study	i
or	c
do	c
researches	i
,	c
because	c
there	c
are	c
not	c
book	i
shops	c
to	c
buy	c
or	c
borrow	c
books	c
in	c
my	c
little	c
town	c
.	c

Moreover	c
without	i
a	i
cellular	i
phone	i
my	i
mother	i
does	i
not	i
let	i
me	i
go	i
out	i
with	i
my	i
friends	i
to	i
the	i
city	i
because	c
it	c
is	c
too	c
far	c
and	c
she	c
is	i
worried	c
.	c

Another	c
thing	c
that	c
I	c
appreciate	c
a	c
lot	c
is	c
the	c
electric	c
guitar	c
;	c
I	c
like	c
very	i
much	i
play	i
guitar	i
,	c
and	c
in	c
my	c
free	c
time	c
I	c
prefer	c
play	i
electric	c
,	c
than	c
acoustic	c
or	c
classic	i
guitar	c
using	i
distortion	c
and	c
gain	c
and	c
the	c
highest	c
volume	c
possible	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
part	c
in	c
basketball	c
competitions	c
all	c
year	c
long	c
,	c
except	c
during	c
July	c
,	c
so	c
it	i
is	c
the	c
only	c
month	c
in	c
which	c
I	c
can	c
travel	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
be	c
grateful	c
if	c
I	c
could	c
have	i
the	i
accomodation	i
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
:	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
not	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
because	c
of	c
my	c
height	c
,	i
I	c
am	c
so	c
tall	c
that	c
I	c
could	c
never	c
stand	c
up	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
play	c
basketball	c
because	c
my	c
trainer	c
said	c
that	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
suitable	i
not	c
to	c
stop	c
practising	i
it	i
during	c
July	c
.	c

I	c
can	c
play	c
basketball	c
very	c
well	c
I	i
would	c
be	c
grateful	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
teach	c
me	c
to	c
play	c
golf	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
you	c
suggest	c
to	i
bring	i
.	c

Saturday	c
17th	c
June	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
your	c
musical	c
show	c
.	c

Some	c
problems	c
of	c
organisation	c
seem	c
to	c
be	i
appeared	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
hoped	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
relaxing	c
entertainment	i
with	i
your	c
musical	i
show	c
but	c
it	i
was	i
not	i
the	i
case	i
.	c

In	c
your	c
advertisement	c
you	c
announced	c
the	c
actors	c
were	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
.	c

They	c
were	c
replaced	c
by	c
less	c
famous	c
actors	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
20.15	c
instead	c
of	c
19.30	c
as	c
you	c
had	c
written	c
on	i
it	i
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
furthermore	i
I	c
had	c
to	c
pay	c
full	c
price	c
whereas	c
you	c
granted	i
us	c
some	c
discount	c
prices	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
interested	c
in	c
visiting	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
but	c
it	c
seemed	c
to	c
me	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

Your	c
assistant	c
prevented	c
us	c
from	c
visiting	c
it	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
too	c
late	c
and	c
he	c
was	c
so	c
busy	c
.	c

Consequently	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
you	c
refund	i
my	c
bill	i
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Nowadays	c
,	c
we	c
need	c
modern	c
technology	c
to	c
improve	c
on	i
daily	c
life	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
without	c
using	c
internet	i
I	c
could	c
not	c
put	i
me	i
through	c
to	c
foreign	c
people	c
.	c

This	c
interactive	c
way	i
of	c
communication	c
allows	c
me	c
to	c
reach	c
everybody	c
everywhere	c
without	c
restrictions	c
.	c

I	c
feel	c
free	c
as	c
a	i
eagle	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
technology	c
has	c
changed	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
because	c
it	c
allows	c
me	c
to	c
do	c
much	i
more	c
things	c
than	c
before	c
.	c

There	c
are	c
links	c
between	c
the	c
greenhouse	i
,	c
technology	c
and	c
me	c
.	c

To	c
conclude	c
,	c
we	c
must	c
not	c
forget	c
that	c
science	c
and	c
technology	c
is	c
a	c
tool	c
to	i
live	c
better	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
and	c
give	c
some	c
information	i
you	c
asked	c
about	c
me	c
.	c

Re	c
accommodation	c
:	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
to	c
avoid	c
these	c
this	c
time	c
.	c

Re	c
activities	c
:	c
During	c
the	c
two	c
weeks	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
do	c
tennis	c
and	c
swimming	c
.	c

Swimming	c
is	c
another	c
sport	c
I	c
learned	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
six	c
.	c

Are	c
the	c
meals	c
free	c
or	c
do	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
pay	c
for	c
it	i
?	c

Do	c
you	c
have	c
a	c
choice	c
of	c
food	c
?	c

I	c
'm	c
vegetarian	c
and	c
ca	c
n't	c
eat	c
any	c
milk	c
products	c
.	c

Are	c
there	c
any	c
special	c
clothes	c
you	c
suggest	c
?	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
your	c
reply	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
glad	c
to	c
hear	c
that	c
you	c
have	c
found	c
a	c
job	c
.	c

Do	c
you	c
remember	c
the	c
concert	c
I	c
helped	c
at	c
.	i

My	c
job	c
was	c
checking	c
the	c
entry	c
tickets	c
and	c
the	c
bags	c
of	c
the	c
fans	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
to	c
tear	c
off	c
a	c
part	c
of	c
every	c
single	c
ticket	c
.	c

This	c
part	c
had	c
to	c
be	c
saved	c
for	c
later	c
because	c
the	c
concert	c
orginazer	i
wanted	c
to	c
know	c
the	c
exactly	i
number	c
of	c
visitors	c
.	c

Here	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
check	c
the	c
bags	c
and	c
couts	i
of	c
the	c
girls	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
great	c
experience	c
.	c

Love	c

Hello	c
,	c

I	c
'm	c
so	c
glad	c
I	c
won	c
this	c
prize	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
have	c
some	c
questions	c
for	c
you	c
,	c
and	c
of	c
course	c
,	c
the	c
answers	i
you	c
asked	c
me	c
.	i

I	c
think	c
it	c
's	c
because	c
the	c
last	c
time	c
I	c
travelled	c
(	c
with	c
my	c
friends	c
)	c
,	c
we	c
stayed	c
at	i
log	c
cabins	c
,	c
and	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
sleeping	c
felt	i
some	i
thing	i
moving	c
in	i
my	c
skin	c
,	c
then	c
I	c
work	i
up	c
frightened	c
and	c
when	c
I	c
openned	i
my	c
eyes	c
,	c
I	c
saw	c
lots	c
of	c
big	c
ants	c
!	c

After	c
that	c
day	c
,	c
I	c
've	c
never	c
stayed	c
at	i
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
.	c

Yeah	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
's	c
why	c
!	c

Is	c
that	c
enough	c
?	c

And	c
how	c
much	c
clothe	i
?	c

A	c
lot	c
,	c
or	c
few	i
?	c

And	c
what	c
about	c
money	c
?	c

Remember	c
when	c
I	c
told	c
you	c
I	c
helped	c
someone	c
important	c
?	c

Suddenly	c
,	c
I	c
saw	c
a	c
man	c
with	c
a	c
cap	c
covering	c
his	c
face	c
.	c

Then	c
I	c
said	c
"	i
OK	c
,	c
I	c
promise	c
!	c
"	c
(	c
frightened	c
,	c
of	c
course	c
)	c

Can	c
you	c
believe	c
it	c

Because	c

told	c
him	c
that	c
I	c
was	c

Is	c
n't	c
that	c
amazing	c
?	c

I	c
met	c

Dear	c
Ms	c
Clark	c
,	c

I	c
spent	c
two	c
days	c
at	c
the	c
last	c
annual	c
international	c
arts	c
festival	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
congratulate	c
on	i
the	c
organization	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
some	c
concert	c
halls	c
were	c
too	c
small	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
not	c
listen	c
to	c
one	c
of	c
my	c
favorite	i
classic	i
concert	i
,	c
"	c
La	c
Moldava	c
"	c
by	c
Smetana	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
glad	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
that	c
one	c
reasonably-priced	i
weekend	c
ticket	c
for	c
all	c
events	c
is	c
an	c
excellent	c
idea	c
because	c
also	i
people	c
who	c
do	c
not	c
have	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
money	c
can	c
enjoy	c
the	c
festival	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
give	i
a	c
suggestion	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
meeting	c
writers	c
,	c
dancers	c
,	c
musicians	c
and	c
artists	c
could	i
be	c
very	c
interesting	c
for	c
anybody	c
.	c

Dear	c
George	c
,	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
your	c
recent	c
letter	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
very	c
happy	c
that	c
you	c
are	c
well	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
read	c
your	c
letter	c
I	c
was	c
surprised	c
because	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
know	c
that	c
you	c
have	i
so	c
many	c
rules	c
both	c
at	c
school	c
and	c
at	c
home	c
.	c

In	c
Italy	c
there	c
are	c
n't	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
rules	c
at	c
school	c
and	c
they	c
are	c
n't	c
very	c
stricht	i
.	c

I	c
ca	c
n't	c
have	c
my	c
mobile	c
on	c
and	c
drinking	c
and	c
eating	c
in	c
the	c
classroom	c
is	c
a	i
bad	c
beheviour	i
.	c

I	c
can	c
do	c
what	c
I	c
like	c
doing	c
but	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
study	c
.	c

Write	c
soon	c

Love	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
,	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
telling	c
me	c
about	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
.	c

It	c
seems	c
so	c
exciting	c
.	c

I	c
really	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
taking	c
part	c
at	i
Camp	c
California	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
my	c
examination	i
will	c
be	c
finished	c
on	c
June	c
15th	c
.	c

And	c
I	c
have	c
a	c
plan	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
visit	c
my	c
parents	c
in	c
Bangkok	c
,	c
Thailand	c
,	c
in	c
the	c
middle	c
of	c
August	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
July	c
is	c
the	c
best	c
time	c
to	c
go	c
for	i
the	c
Camp	c
.	c

Because	c
I	c
'm	c
not	c
good	c
at	c
sporting	i
,	c
so	i
I	c
will	c
choose	c
singing	c
and	c
photography	c
as	c
my	c
activities	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
was	c
studying	c
in	i
the	i
university	c
I	c
joined	c
the	c
Photo	c
Club	c
where	c
I	c
got	i
the	i
knowledge	i
a	i
well	i
as	i
a	i
wide	i
variety	i
of	i
knowhow	i
in	i
taking	c
photo	i
.	c

As	c
I	c
love	c
singing	c
and	c
always	c
spend	c
my	c
free	c
time	c
in	i
Karaoke	c
to	c
practise	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
my	c
singing	c
is	c
not	c
too	c
bad	c
.	c

What	c
type	c
of	c
clothes	c
and	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
do	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
prepare	i
?	c

Yours	c

"	c
Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
"	c
.	c

I	c
bought	c
lots	c
of	c
new	c
fashion	i
clothes	c
,	c
bags	c
and	c
shoes	c
.	c

Now	c
,	c
I	c
hate	c
shopping	c
because	c
I	c
spent	c
a	c
lot	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
young	c
as	i
mentioned	i
so	i
it	i
came	c
to	c
the	c
conclusion	c
that	c
shopping	c
is	c
a	c
way	c
to	c
waste	c
the	i
time	c
and	c
money	c
.	c

I	c
found	c
that	c
it	c
's	c
not	c
worth	i
when	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
southern	c
part	c
of	c
Thailand	c
3	c
years	c
ago	c
where	c
I	c
met	c
an	c
old	c
man	c
and	c
his	c
little	c
grandson	c
.	c

The	c
money	c
that	c
I	c
spent	c
on	c
shopping	c
can	i
help	i
them	c
a	c
lot	c
if	c
I	c
would	i
not	c
do	i
it	c
before	i
.	c

Dear	c
Mr.	c
Smith	c
,	c

Unfortunatly	i
I	i
am	c
a	i
very	c
disappointed	c
about	c
organisation	i
in	i
your	c
company	c
.	c

I	c
paid	c
for	c
this	c
performance	c
the	c
full	c
price	c
£	i
20	c
because	c
discounts	c
were	c
not	c
available	c
although	c
on	i
your	c
advertisement	c
there	i
were	c
.	c

And	c
last	c
but	c
not	c
least	c
I	i
recognised	i
after	c
the	c
show	c
that	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
waiters	c
did	c
n't	c
come	c
...	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
it	i
is	c
a	c
typical	c
situation	c
in	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatrer	i
that	c
is	i
promised	i
much	c
more	c
then	c
the	c
people	c
can	c
get	c
for	c
their	c
money	c
,	c
or	c
it	i
was	c
on	c
June	c
7	c
(	c
my	c
visit	c
)	c
only	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
am	i
not	c
agree	i
with	i
such	c
situation	i
and	c
would	i
ask	c
you	c
for	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
-	c
my	c
bank	c
account	c
number	c
is	c
enclosed	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
it	c
changed	c
our	c
life-style	i
.	c

Because	c
the	i
people	c
have	c
fast	c
and	c
comfortable	c
cars	c
,	c
they	c
are	c
much	c
more	c
mobil	i
and	c
can	c
spend	c
their	c
free-time	i
more	c
aktiv	i
-	c
they	c
can	c
often	c
visit	c
their	c
friends	c
and	c
travel	c
much	c
more	c
.	c

Secondely	i
we	i
can	c
do	c
our	c
jobs	c
today	c
more	c
efficient	i
.	c

If	c
we	c
are	c
more	c
efficient	c
we	c
can	c
earn	c
more	c
money	c
and	c
spend	c
it	c
more	c
for	i
our	c
daily	c
life	c
-	c
for	i
better	c
clothes	c
,	c
furniture	c
,	c
spare	i
time	i
.	c

First	c
,	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
was	c
n't	c
the	c
star	c
that	c
night	c
,	c
he	c
was	c
replaced	c
by	c
an	c
actor	c
that	c
seemed	c
a	i
rookie	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
there	c
was	i
n't	i
any	c
discounts	c
availables	i
(	c
I	c
'm	c
student	i
but	c
I	c
paid	c
a	i
full	i
ticket	c
)	c
.	c

How	i
it	i
was	i
explained	i
above	i
,	i
I	i
'm	i
not	i
satisfied	i
and	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
be	c
refund	i
.	c

She	c
's	c
the	c
sister	c
of	c
my	c
ex-girlfriend	c
which	i
is	c
called	c
Eingrid	c
.	c

Last	c
weekend	c
we	c
diced	i
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
bach	i
with	c
Pat	c
and	c
Nick	c
(	c
her	c
boyfriend	c
)	c
.	c

Lyter	i
a	c
long	c
time	c
walking	c
we	c
decided	c
to	c
return	c
and	c
how	i
the	c
weather	c
was	c
so	c
hot	c
we	c
found	i
a	c
place	c
to	c
drink	c
something	c
.	c

We	c
had	c
a	c
little	c
conversation	c
and	c
suddenly	c
she	c
kissed	c
me	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
refused	c
to	c
continue	c
.	c

When	c
we	c
met	c
the	c
girls	c
Eingrid	c
was	c
furious	c
,	c
she	c
said	c
me	i
that	c
Pat	c
had	c
saw	i
me	c
kissing	c
another	c
girl	c
and	c
our	c
relationship	c
was	c
over	c
!	c

I	c
'm	c
really	c
very	c
unlucked	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
on	c
behalf	c
of	c
my	c
class	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
about	i
the	c
programme	c
you	c
organised	c
for	c
our	c
trip	c
to	c
London	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
you	c
might	c
not	c
know	c
what	c
this	c
show	c
is	c
.	i

It	c
would	c
be	c
interesting	c
for	c
us	c
to	c
see	c
all	c
that	c
"	c
live	c
"	c
,	c
rather	c
than	c
on	c
TV	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

We	c
were	c
there	c
,	c
alone	c
,	c
my	c
friend	c
with	c
his	c
broken	c
leg	c
and	c
myself	c
.	c

We	c
had	c
decided	c
to	c
climb	c
that	c
more	c
than	c
3'700-metre-high	i
mountain	c
near	c
Arolla	c
in	c
Switzerland	c
two	c
weeks	c
beforehand	c
.	c

It	c
all	c
went	c
as	c
expected	c
and	c
we	c
reached	c
the	c
summit	c
in	c
six	c
hours	c
.	c

My	c
friend	c
fell	c
down	c
and	c
badly	c
hit	c
his	c
leg	c
against	c
a	c
rock	c
.	c

I	c
finally	c
decided	c
to	c
carry	c
him	c
on	c
my	c
back	c
on	i
the	i
way	i
back	c
to	c
the	c
rescue	c
chalet	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
dangerous	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
steepness	c
of	c
the	c
slope	c
and	c
we	c
risked	c
falling	c
down	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
we	c
would	c
have	c
frozen	c
to	c
death	c
if	c
we	c
had	c
stood	i
where	c
we	c
were	c
.	c

After	c
ten	c
more	c
exhausting	c
hours	c
of	c
walking	c
we	c
finally	c
reached	c
the	c
chalet	c
,	c
from	c
which	i
we	c
were	c
able	c
to	c
call	c
a	c
helicopter	c
.	c

We	c
were	c
safe	c
!	c

Dear	c
Sirs	c
,	c

I	c
visited	c
your	c
Theatre	c
yesterday	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	i
to	c
see	c
the	c
best	c
musical	c
show	c
with	c
the	c
best	c
artists	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
instead	i
of	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
we	c
have	c
seen	c
unknown	i
actor	c
.	c

Moreover	c
this	i
show	c
did	c
not	c
start	c
at	c
19.30	c
,	c
but	c
45	c
minutes	c
later	c
.	c

Another	c
problem	c
-	c
the	c
tickets	c
for	c
students	c
according	c
to	c
your	c
advertisement	c
should	c
be	i
available	i
with	i
discounts	i
-	c
unfortunately	c
I	c
could	c
not	c
buy	c
such	c
ticket	i
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
,	i
why	c
?	i

I	c
no	i
thought	i
,	i
that	c
so	c
serious	c
theatre	i
makes	i
such	c
mistakes	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

Fashion	c
are	i
changing	c
every	c
year	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
in	i
the	c
future	c
people	c
will	c
wear	c
clothes	c
made	c
of	c
a	i
natural	c
fabrics	c
;	c
silk	c
,	c
cotton	c
,	c
leather	c
,	c
wool	c
.	c

All	c
syntetic	i
material	c
will	c
be	c
uncomfortable	c
for	c
these	c
people	c
.	c

Women	c
will	c
prefere	i
the	i
long	c
skirts	c
and	c
short	c
blouses	c
and	c
jackets	c
.	c

Of	c
course	c
,	c
it	i
will	i
be	i
smart	i

Dear	c
Mr.	c
Robertson	c
,	c

The	c
programme	c
has	c
already	c
been	c
organized	c
by	c
you	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
say	c
you	c
have	c
made	i
us	i
a	i
very	i
nice	i
schedule	i
.	c

The	c
river	c
trip	c
to	c
Greenwich	c
is	c
certainly	c
something	c
we	c
are	c
all	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
,	c
but	c
due	i
to	i
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
show	c
,	c
my	c
class	c
asked	i
me	c
to	c
propose	i
a	c
change	c
in	c
our	c
schedule	c
.	c

I	c
believe	c
it	c
could	c
be	c
an	c
enriching	c
experience	c
for	c
all	c
of	c
us	c
.	c

Our	c
free	c
time	c
on	c
Wednesday	c
could	c
be	c
spent	c
in	i
the	c
Museum	i

Best	c

Dear	c
Sarah	c

I	c
'm	c
sorry	c
it	c
took	c
me	c
so	c
long	c
to	c
write	i
you	i
back	i
,	c
but	c
I	c
have	c
being	i
very	c
busy	c
lately	c
:	i
Anyway	c
,	c
on	i
your	c
last	c
letter	c
you	c
asked	c
me	c
whether	c
.	i

Now	c
,	c
tell	c
me	c
more	c
about	c
you	c
.	c

Are	c
you	c
already	c
on	c
holidays	i
.	i

My	c
parents	c
and	c
I	c
will	c
spend	c
our	c
holidays	c
in	c
Australia	c
and	c
I	c
just	c
could	c
n't	c
be	c
happier	c
!	c

I	c
just	c
ca	c
n't	c
wait	c
to	c
go	c
abroad	c
for	c
the	c
first	c
time	c
!	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
's	c
all	c
about	c
it	c
.	c

Write	c
soon	c
.	c

Merry	c
Xmas	c
and	c
Great	i
New	c
Year	c
!	c

As	c
we	c
have	c
seen	c
the	c
advertisment	i
of	i
the	c
programmed	i
the	c
school	c
set	i
for	c
us	c
as	c
a	c
farewell	c
activities	i
,	c
we	c
are	c
very	c
appreciate	i
and	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
for	i
your	c
kindness	c
,	c
as	c
all	c
of	c
them	i
are	c
very	c
interesting	c
and	c
give	c
us	c
a	c
chance	c
to	c
meet	c
and	c
join	i
the	c
other	c
class	c
which	i
we	c
hardly	i
done	i
it	i
before	i
.	c

As	c
you	c
know	c
all	c
of	c
us	c
in	c
this	c
class	c
are	c
preparing	c
to	c
go	i
in	i
for	i
the	c
art	c
&	c
design	c
school	c
in	c
the	c
next	c
semester	c
.	c

So	c
this	c
is	c
a	c
great	i
oppotunity	i
for	c
us	c
to	c
get	c
used	c
to	c
the	c
real	c
world	c
of	c
fashion	c
design	c
,	c
because	c
in	c
this	c
show	c
there	c
will	i
have	i
a	c
fashion	c
show	c
,	i
a	i
demonstation	i
from	i
make	i
up	c
artists	c
,	c
and	c
a	c
contest	c
for	c
hair	i
stylist	i
.	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
most	c
of	c
the	i
famouse	i
brand	c
of	c
sport	c
were	c
companies	c
will	i
join	i
in	c
this	c
exhibition	c
with	c
their	c
new	i
product	i
for	c
the	c
coming	c
season	c
.	c

We	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
if	c
all	c
of	c
us	c
can	c
join	i
in	i
this	c
event	c
.	c

We	c
all	c
agree	c
that	c
we	c
are	c
going	c
to	i
join	i
the	c
school	c
trip	c
to	c
Science	i
Museum	c
,	c
which	c
is	c
the	c
most	c
interesting	c
trip	c
for	c
us	c
.	c

Anyway	c
,	c
intstead	i
of	c
go	i
shopping	c
in	c
the	c
afternoon	c
session	c
,	c
we	c
will	c
attend	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

This	c
is	c
the	c
solution	c
that	c
we	c
all	c
think	c
it	i
will	c
be	c
the	c
less	i
effected	i
to	c
the	c
other	c
students	c
,	c
as	c
the	c
school	c
do	c
not	c
need	c
to	c
re-arrange	c
all	i
the	i
trip	c
just	c
because	c
of	c
our	c
special	c
interesting	i
.	c

We	c
hope	c
much	i
that	c
you	c
understand	c
,	c
and	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
in	i
advance	c
for	c
your	c
cooperation	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
dangerous	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
know	i
I	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
.	c

Even	c
though	c
all	c
of	c
my	c
friends	c
who	c
were	c
with	c
me	c
in	i
that	c
day	c
all	i
said	c
"	i
Just	c
let	c
it	c
go	c
,	c
it	c
's	c
just	i
only	i
a	c
puppy	c
.	c

Why	c
do	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
a	c
risk	c
?	c
"	c

It	c
seemed	c
that	c
all	i
of	i
them	i
did	i
n't	i
have	i
any	c
sympathy	c
to	i
that	c
lovely	c
blue	i
eyes	i
puppy	c
that	c
somebody	c
who	c
have	i
no	c
mercy	c
just	i
left	i
it	i
there	c
,	c
in	i
a	c
highway	c
.	c

If	i
you	i
imagine	i
how	i
dangerous	i
you	i
were	i
while	i
you	i
had	i
to	i
stop	i
your	i
car	i
and	i
got	i
off	i
the	i
car	c
on	c
the	c
highway	c
where	c
there	i
were	i
only	i
car	i
at	i
least	i
120	i
km/hr	i
running	i
along	i
your	i
side	i
.	c

It	c
was	c
true	c
that	c
small	c
dog	c
were	i
in	c
danger	c
,	c
but	c
your	c
life	c
was	i
in	c
that	c
situation	c
as	c
well	c
once	c
you	c
decide	i
to	c
do	c
that	c
brave	c
thing	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
,	c

We	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
you	c
have	c
spend	i
for	i
us	i
in	c
order	c
to	c
organize	c
the	c
programme	c
that	c
we	c
should	i
follow	c
during	c
three	i
days	c
that	c
we	c
are	c
going	c
to	c
spending	i
London	i
.	c

We	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
inform	c
you	c
that	c
we	c
notice	i
an	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
London	c
fashion	i
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
.	c

This	c
show	c
is	c
going	c
to	c
take	c
place	c
in	c
the	c
Central	c
Exhibition	c
Hall	c
of	c
London	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
,	c
March	c
14	c
between	i
the	c
hours	c
10.00-19.00	c
,	c
and	c
we	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
if	c
it	c
is	c
possible	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
that	c
show	c
.	c

We	c
think	c
that	c
is	i
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
and	c
we	c
are	c
all	c
very	c
interesting	i
to	i
go	i
because	c
we	c
can	c
see	c
there	c
the	c
latest	c
fashions	c
,	c
leisure	c
and	c
sports	c
wear	c
,	c
lot	i
kinds	i
of	c
make	i
up	i
and	c
some	c
of	i
the	i
famous	c
hairstylers	i
.	c

As	c
a	c
class	c
we	c
suggest	c
to	i
go	i
to	c
this	c
show	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
,	c
March	c
14	c
morning	i
and	i
to	i
visit	i
the	c
Science	c
Museum	c
on	c
Wednesday	c
afternoon	c
during	c
our	c
free	c
time	c
.	c

They	c
do	c
n't	c
inform	i
people	i
about	i
news	c
,	c
education	c
or	c
documentaries	c
.	c

They	c
just	c
published	i
gossips	i
about	c
famous	c
people	c
,	c
such	c
as	c
politicians	c
,	c
musicians	c
and	c
film	c
stars	c
.	c

I	c
believe	c
all	c
the	i
people	c
famous	i
or	c
not	c
,	c
deserve	c
to	c
have	c
private	i
life	c
without	c
journalists	c
to	i
following	c
them	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
.	c

They	c
are	c
humans	c
like	c
all	c
of	c
us	c
with	i
their	c
problems	c
,	c
their	c
good	c
and	c
bad	c
times	c
and	i
of	c
course	c
they	c
do	c
n't	c
want	c
to	i
be	i
publish	i
them	c
in	c
front	c
of	c
millions	c
of	c
people	c
because	c
a	c
journalist	c
thought	c
that	c
this	c
is	i
right	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
the	c
only	c
way	c
of	c
change	i
that	c
is	c
,	i
the	i
people	i
,	i
If	i
the	c
people	c
shows	i
no	c
interest	c
the	i
journalist	c
would	c
have	c
no	c
goal	i
of	i
publish	i
any	c
gossips	i
because	c
is	i
not	i
going	i
to	i
be	i
watch	i
or	c
read	c
by	c
anyone	c
.	c

So	c
the	c
power	c
is	c
to	i
the	c
people	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr.	c
Robertson	c
.	i

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
,	i
because	c
we	c
saw	c
a	c
great	c
advetisement	i
for	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
and	c
we	c
really	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
see	c
that	c
show	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
we	c
can	c
have	c
a	c
great	c
time	c
there	c
,	c
and	c
entrence	i
is	c
free	c
of	c
charge	c
for	c
students	c
,	c
what	i
is	c
very	c
important	c
as	c
well	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
wondering	c
if	c
there	c
is	c
any	c
possibility	c
to	c
go	c
on	i
that	c
show	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
afternoon	c
,	c
and	c
move	c
our	c
shopping	c
to	c
next	i
day	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
'll	c
think	c
about	c
our	c
proposition	i
and	c
consider	c
to	i
change	i
the	c
programme	c
.	c

My	c
story	c
began	i
on	i
my	c
holiday	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
nice	i
,	c
hot	c
summer	c
so	c
I	c
and	c
two	c
friends	c
of	c
mine	c
have	i
decided	i
to	c
go	c
for	i
holiday	c
this	c
year	c
to	c
the	c
see	i
side	i
.	c

Everything	c
was	c
showing	i
,	i
today	c
was	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
a	c
good	c
,	c
sunny	c
day	c
.	c

We	c
went	c
for	i
swimming	c
.	c

I	c
look	i
around	c
and	c
I	c
relised	i
one	i
friend	c
of	c
mine	c
is	i
still	c
in	c
the	c
see	i
,	c
and	c
fighting	c
with	i
storm	i
,	c
trying	c
to	c
get	c
to	c
the	c
side	i
.	c

That	c
was	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
our	c
holiday	c
,	c
and	c
next	c
year	c
for	i
sure	i
we	i
wo	c
n't	c
be	c
going	c
to	c
the	c
see	i
side	i
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
"	c
performed	c
at	c
"	c
The	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
"	c
on	c
the	c
20th	c
of	c
May	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
it	c
would	c
not	c
have	c
been	c
such	c
a	c
great	c
problem	c
if	c
the	c
show	c
on	i
the	i
proved	i
to	c
be	c
as	c
good	c
as	c
they	c
promised	c
but	c
it	c
really	c
was	c
not	c
worth	c
seeing	c
,	c
especially	c
because	c
the	c
first	i
actor	c
was	c
not	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
as	i
we	c
expected	c
but	i
an	c
unknown	c
,	c
clearly	c
an	c
inexperienced	c
young	c
actor	c
,	c
named	c
Tom	c
Douglas	c
.	c

What	c
is	c
more	c
,	c
there	c
were	c
no	c
discounts	c
available	c
for	i
the	c
ticket	c
fees	i
nor	c
we	i
had	i
the	c
opportunity	c
to	c
visit	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
,	c
as	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
for	c
mourning	c
reasons	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
not	c
satisfied	c
with	c
the	c
service	c
we	c
received	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
therefore	c
writing	c
for	i
a	c
full	c
refund	c
and	c
I	c
expect	c
to	c
receive	c
by	i
post	i
a	i
cheque	i
for	c
£	c
20	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
21st	c
century	c
,	c
people	c
will	c
all	c
the	c
wearing	c
the	c
same	c
clothes	c
,	c
the	c
same	c
shoes	c
,	c
they	c
will	c
be	c
buying	c
the	c
same	c
accessories	c
.	c

We	c
'll	c
get	c
out	i
in	c
the	c
morning	c
and	c
find	c
out	i
that	c
our	c
neighbour	c
wears	c
our	i
same	c
jacket	c
and	c
he	c
's	c
boasting	c
about	c
a	c
pair	c
of	c
shoes	c
which	c
are	c
too	c
similar	c
to	c
ours	c
.	c

The	c
thing	c
is	c
we	c
are	c
too	c
fashion	c
conscious	c
,	c
too	c
fussy	c
about	c
our	c
appearance	c
and	c
we	c
'll	c
end	c
up	c
forking	i
out	i
for	i
smart	c
clothes	c
only	c
because	c
the	c
people	c
next	c
door	c
are	c
doing	c
so	c
!	c
!	c

The	c
reason	c
why	c
we	c
'll	c
do	c
this	c
is	c
that	c
we	c
need	c
to	c
be	c
accepted	c
by	c
the	c
elite	c
group	c
that	c
decide	c
who	c
you	c
must	c
be	c
and	c
how	c
you	c
must	c
behave	c
.	c

Anyway	c
,	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
really	c
mind	c
what	c
people	c
will	c
be	c
wearing	c
in	c
100	c
years	c
'	c
time	c
.	c

As	c
for	c
me	c
the	c
only	c
thing	c
I	c
care	c
for	i
in	c
the	c
morning	c
is	c
that	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
my	i
socks	i
mismatched	i
!	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
,	c

We	c
know	c
that	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
good	c
chance	c
for	c
us	c
to	c
learn	c
more	c
different	c
things	c
and	c
can	i
widen	c
our	c
knowledge	c
in	c
the	c
Science	c
Museum	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
,	c
we	c
can	c
appreciate	c
and	c
enjoy	c
the	c
art	c
in	c
National	i
Art	c
Gallery	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
I	c
know	c
that	c
most	c
of	c
the	c
students	c
have	c
already	c
visited	c
this	i
two	c
places	c
before	c
.	c

So	c
we	c
decide	i
to	c
choose	c
the	i
other	i
programme	i
which	i
have	i
seen	i
as	i
an	i
entertainment	i
.	c

It	c
is	c
the	c
LONDON	c
FASHION	c
AND	c
LEISURE	c
SHOW	c
.	c

It	c
shows	c
the	c
latest	c
fashions	c
including	i
leisure	c
and	c
sports	c
wear	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
because	c
it	c
holds	i
only	i
1	c
day	c
which	i
is	c
Tuesday	c
March	c
14	c
.	c

And	c
,	i
it	c
is	c
free	c
for	c
students	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
worth	c
visiting	c
.	c

Personally	i
,	c
here	c
is	i
my	i
some	c
suggestions	c
about	c
how	c
the	c
programme	c
could	c
be	c
changed	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
the	c
above	c
information	c
is	c
my	c
opinion	c
and	c
I	c
hope	c
you	c
can	c
accept	c
it	c
.	c

Your	i
sincerely	c
,	c

For	c
me	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
people	c
's	c
home	i
may	c
not	c
be	c
built	c
on	c
the	c
ground	c
.	c

It	c
will	c
save	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
electricity	c
as	c
solar	c
energy	c
is	i
used	c
.	c

And	c
,	i
there	c
should	c
be	c
a	i
electrical	i
servant	c
in	c
everyone	c
's	c
home	c
.	c

So	c
there	i
's	i
no	c
need	c
for	c
people	c
to	c
do	c
the	c
household	i
work	i
.	c

If	c
you	c
're	c
tire	i
,	c
the	c
pill	c
can	c
give	c
you	c
vitamin	i
,	c
protein	i
and	c
make	c
you	c
refresh	i

on	i
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
there	c
're	c
some	c
ways	i
that	c
remain	c
the	c
same	c
.	c

The	c
toilet	c
should	c
remain	c
the	c
same	c
as	c
people	c
need	c
to	c
use	c
daily	i
and	c
nothing	c
can	c
replace	c
it	c
.	c

Second	c
,	c
there	c
should	c
be	c
friends	c
and	c
family	c
members	c
in	c
the	c
home	c
to	c
provide	c
joyful	i
and	c
fun	c
.	c

I	c
really	c
wonder	c
how	c
the	c
home	c
of	c
the	c
future	c
will	c
be	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
!	c

Firstly	c
I	i
would	c
like	c
to	c
explain	c
you	i
where	i
the	c
problem	c
is	c
.	c

I	c
came	c
to	c
London	c
for	c
a	c
short	c
journey	i
to	c
meet	c
new	c
poeple	i
and	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
meeting	i
with	i
an	i
English	c
culture	c
.	c

I	i
've	i
seen	c
your	c
advertisment	i
which	c
had	i
recommended	i
the	c
play	c
'	c
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
'	c
and	c
I	c
enjoyed	i
it	c
very	c
much	c
.	c

I	c
heard	c
about	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
in	c
Poland	c
and	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
see	c
him	c
on	c
the	c
scene	i
but	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
hardly	i
possible	c
.	c

There	c
was	c
a	c
change	c
of	i
the	c
leader-actor	i
what	i
annoyed	c
me	c
indeed	i
.	c

Further	i
more	i
the	i
show	c
was	c
to	c
begin	c
at	c
about	c
19.30	c
but	c
it	c
didi	i
n't	i
.	c

On	i
the	c
advertisment	i
was	i
written	i
'	i
DISCOUNTS	i
AVAILABLE	i
'	i
shall	c
I	c
ask	c
you	c
one	c
question	c
?	c
-	c
Why	c
they	i
were	i
n't	i
available	c
?	c

I	c
didi	i
n't	i
expect	c
more	c
surprises	c
at	c
your	c
Theatre	c
.	c

Nevertheless	c
after	i
the	c
show	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
hungry	c
so	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
restarrant	i
and	c
what	c
I	i
've	i
seen	i
?	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
recieve	i
back	c
my	c
money	c
.	c

The	c
entrance	c
in	i
to	c
the	c
new	c
millennium	c
brought	c
us	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
changes	c
.	c

Many	c
things	c
have	c
been	c
replaced	c
by	c
the	i
others	c
which	c
are	c
more	c
helpful	c
and	c
useful	c
.	c

The	c
most	c
important	c
thing	c
for	c
me	c
is	c
using	c
a	c
computer	c
.	c

The	c
main	c
adventage	i
is	c
that	c
,	i
it	c
provides	c
you	c
all	i
the	c
informations	i
that	c
you	c
need	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
you	i
have	c
to	c
write	c
an	c
Essay	c
about	c
2-nd	i
world	c
war	c
.	c

You	c
get	c
into	i
the	c
internet	i
and	c
you	c
're	c
looking	c
for	c
those	c
facts	c
and	c
informations	i
which	c
will	c
help	c
you	c
to	c
do	c
your	c
homework	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
no	c
time	c
for	c
learning	c
and	c
for	c
domestic	c
works	i
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
playing	i
games	c
and	c
using	c
a	c
computer	c
wide	i
my	c
brain	c
so	c
as	i
you	c
can	c
see	c
this	i
modern	c
staft	i
has	c
got	c
many	c
advantages	c
and	c
disadvantages	c
.	c

The	c
next	c
thing	c
that	c
has	c
changed	c
my	c
life	c
is	c
a	c
mobile	c
telephone	c
.	c

This	c
little	c
thing	c
brings	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
satisfaction	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
no	c
problems	c
with	c
changing	c
the	c
time	c
of	c
meeting	i
because	c
I	c
can	c
always	c
phone	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
even	c
seen	c
in	c
the	i
domestic	c
works	i
.	c

My	c
mother	c
is	c
happy	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
happier	c
because	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
need	c
to	c
put	i
an	c
effort	c
to	c
iron	c
the	c
clothes	c
.	c

These	c
are	c
the	c
main	c
reasons	c
why	c
I	c
admit	c
that	c
technology	c
has	c
changed	c
my	c
life	c
and	c
other	c
people	c
's	c
life	c
.	c

I	c
admire	c
people	i
who	c
made	c
those	c
machines	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
give	c
them	c
the	i
tribute	c
.	c

Dear	c
Ms	c
Clark	c
,	c

As	i
I	c
saw	c
on	i
the	c
advertisement	c
,	i
there	c
were	i
stars	c
and	c
artists	c
from	c
around	c
the	c
world	c
but	c
this	c
year	c
there	c
were	c
only	c
six	c
countries	c
.	i

I	c
noticed	c
that	c
some	c
concert	c
halls	c
were	c
too	c
small	c
.	c

I	c
wonder	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
offer	i
outside	i
concerts	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
there	c
were	c
too	c
few	c
plays	c
and	c
films	c
.	c

Do	c
n't	c
you	c
think	c
you	c
could	c
create	i
dramatic	i
courses	c
?	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerly	i
,	c

Dear	c
George	c
,	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
when	c
we	c
failed	i
an	c
exam	c
in	c
June	c
,	c
we	c
can	c
have	i
it	c
in	c
September	c
.	c

At	c
home	c
,	c
we	c
must	c
wash	c
our	c
hands	c
before	c
the	i
lunch	c
.	c

And	c
we	c
must	c
n't	c
speak	c
during	c
the	i
lunch	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
's	c
not	c
a	c
good	c
thing	c
because	c
we	c
ca	c
n't	c
discuss	c
with	i
our	c
family	c
.	c

Dear	c
Jane	c
Clark	c
,	c

I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
"	c
International	c
Arts	c
Festival	c
"	c
on	c
21-22	c
November	c
.	c

The	c
festival	c
was	c
generally	c
good	c
but	c
I	c
have	c
some	c
suggestions	c
for	c
the	i
next	c
year	c
's	c
festival	c
.	c

However	c
there	c
were	c
things	c
that	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
like	c
.	c

You	c
said	c
that	c
stars	c
and	c
artists	c
would	c
come	c
from	c
around	c
the	c
world	c
but	c
there	c
was	i
only	c
starts	i
from	c
six	c
major	c
countries	c
.	c

I	c
suggest	c
you	c
to	i
increase	i
this	c
number	c
for	c
the	i
next	c
year	c
.	c

They	c
were	c
excellent	c
so	c
can	c
you	c
show	c
more	c
plays	c
next	c
year	c
?	c

Last	i
thing	c
that	c
I	c
will	c
say	c
is	c
"	c
one	c
reasonably-priced	c
weekend	c
ticket	c
"	c
.	i

I	c
hope	c
you	c
will	c
listen	c
my	i
suggestions	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
we	c
will	c
meet	c
next	c
year	c
in	i
the	c
festival	c
.	c

Dear	c
Emily	c
,	c

I	i
'm	i
glad	c
to	c
see	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
a	c
suprise	i
for	c
you	c
.	c

May	i
be	i
we	c
can	c
meet	c
there	c
...	c

However	c
we	c
are	c
allowed	c
to	c
eat	c
,	i
drink	i
during	c
the	c
breaks	c
.	c

I	c
must	c
be	c
in	i
home	c
untill	i
11pm	c
.	c

Other	c
things	c
are	c
allowed	c
to	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
want	c
to	c
change	c
school	i
uniform	c
rule	c
so	c
everybody	c
can	c
wear	c
what	c
they	c
want	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
you	i
advertisement	c
stated	c
that	c
the	c
second	c
show	c
should	c
start	c
at	c
19:30	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
hungry	c
after	c
waiting	c
for	c
the	c
show	c
and	c
wanted	c
to	c
order	c
something	c
to	c
eat	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
you	c
then	c
to	c
send	c
the	c
money	c
back	c
to	c
me	c
because	c
I	c
did	c
not	c
enjoy	c
the	c
show	c
at	c
all	c
and	c
the	c
ticket	c
costed	i
a	c
fortune	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

She	c
heard	c
from	c
her	c
friend	c
Jon	c
that	c
Paul	c
,	c
the	c
worst	c
pupil	c
at	c
school	c
,	c
had	c
thrown	c
an	c
enormous	c
frog	c
inside	c
the	c
desk	c
of	c
Miss	c
Colston	c
,	c
their	c
English	c
teacher	c
.	c

But	c
the	c
children	c
were	c
bored	c
during	c
her	c
lessons	c
and	c
Paul	c
was	c
very	c
disappointed	c
that	c
she	c
did	c
n't	c
read	c
any	c
funny	c
stories	c
.	c

There	c
's	c
a	c
frog	c

13	c
.	i

I	c
could	c
not	c
believe	c
my	c
eyes	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
incredible	c
!	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
some	c
information	c
.	c

This	c
time	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
try	c
something	c
different	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
also	c
like	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
about	c
my	c
free-time	c
activities	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
actually	c
not	c
so	c
good	c
at	c
climbing	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
like	c
the	c
fear	c
of	c
risks	c
and	c
dangers	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
happy`	c
,	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
will	c
have	c
the	c
chance	c
to	c
do	c
this	i
two	c
activities	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjeyable	i
.	c

If	c
I	c
had	c
the	c
possibility	i
,	c
I	c
would	c
never	c
go	c
shopping	c
to	i
the	c
big	c
supermarkets	c
.	c

You	c
buy	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
items	c
without	c
thinking	c
where	c
should	i
go	i
so	i
much	i
rubbish	i
.	c

For	i
instance	i
,	i
I	c
think	c
a	c
lot	c
about	c
this	c
issue	c
,	c
and	c
sometimes	c
I	c
do	c
not	c
even	c
want	c
to	c
spend	i
water	c
,	c
although	c
I	c
should	c
do	i
it	i
.	c

I	c
think	c
I	c
am	c
too	c
sensible	c
.	c

So	i
you	i
can	c
ask	c
about	c
the	c
qualities	i
and	c
prices	c
and	c
get	c
immediately	i
your	i
answers	i
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
small	c
and	i
the	c
markets	i
outsides	i
should	c
be	c
supported	c
,	i
on	i
the	c
other	c
hand	c
the	i
big	c
supermarkets	c
should	c
think	c
more	c
about	c
the	c
recyling	i
problem	c
,	c
which	c
will	c
be	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
problem	c
in	c
the	c
near	c
future	c
.	c

I	c
have	i
seen	i
a	c
musical	c
show	c
and	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
my	i
favourite	i
time	i
.	c

This	c
is	c
why	c
I	c
was	c
feeling	i
invited	i
to	c
your	c
restaurant	c
after	c
show	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
add	c
that	c
being	i
a	c
student	c
I	i
find	c
discounts	c
very	c
important	c
for	c
my	c
budget	c
.	c

Neither	i
without	i
any	c
reason	c
it	i
was	i
not	c
available	c
.	c

This	c
was	c
the	c
reason	c
whe	i
we	c
were	c
horrible	i
troubles	i
with	c
police	i
.	c

Let	c
's	c
back	i
to	c
the	c
beginig	i
of	c
this	c
story	c
.	c

We	c
called	c
this	c
place	c
like	i
this	c
,	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
land	i
in	c
the	c
middle	c
of	c
our	c
lake	c
.	c

There	c
was	c
no	c
light	c
during	i
nights	i
so	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
find	c
some	c
wood	c
to	c
make	c
a	c
fire	c
.	c

This	c
is	c
no	c
joke	c
!	c

There	c
was	c
a	c
secret	c
place	c
when	i
robber	i
keept	i
stolen	i
gold	i
from	c
bank	i
.	c

So	c
we	c
tried	c
to	c
keep	c
our	c
secret	c
for	c
2	c
days	c
but	c
...	c

I	c
think	c
you	c
are	c
able	c
to	c
imagine	c
what	c
was	i
happen	i
later	c
.	c

Our	c
class	c
really	c
appreciate	c
for	i
preparing	c
this	c
programme	c
,	c
especially	c
for	i
Monday	c
's	c
atraction	i
.	c

We	c
are	c
extremaly	i
interested	c
in	c
wisiting	i
London	c
.	c

The	i
idea	i
of	i
sightseeing	i
by	c
bus	c
would	i
be	c
a	c
great	c
possibility	i
for	c
us	c
to	c
know	i
better	i
our	i
wonderful	i
capitol	i
.	c

Although	c
we	c
are	c
excited	c
about	c
the	c
scientic	i
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
you	i
to	i
ask	i
,	i
if	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
possible	c
to	c
change	c
our	c
schedule	c
a	c
little	c
bit	c
.	c

In	c
last	i
edition	c
of	c
'	c
London	c
's	c

we	c
saw	c

hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Nowedays	i
famous	c
people	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
an	c
easy	c
life	c
.	c

They	c
are	c
always	c
attacted	i
by	c
naughty	c
journalists	c
,	c
which	c
have	c
aspiration	i
to	c
earn	c
big	c
money	c
for	c
writing	c
an	c
extremaly	i
good	c
report	c
,	i
or	c
article	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
we	c
are	c
fascinated	c
in	i
their	c
marriage	i
,	c
children	c
,	c
holidays	c
etc.	c
What	c
is	c
more	c
it	c
was	c
their	c
own	c
choice	c
to	c
become	c
popular	c
and	c
well-known	i
.	c

By	i
chosing	i
this	c
style	c
of	c
life	c
they	c
should	c
realise	c
,	i
how	i
their	i
life	i
would	i
look	i
like	i
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
their	c
life	c
has	c
no	c
privaty	i
.	c

In	c
spite	c
of	c
being	c
incredibly	c
famous	c
,	c
they	c
might	c
feel	c
very	c
anxiously	i
and	c
lonely	c
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
I	c
belive	i
that	c
we	c
have	c
right	i
to	c
be	c
informed	c
about	c
their	c
life	i
,	c
providing	c
that	c
journalists	c
respect	c
some	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c

Our	c
class	c
is	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
going	c
to	c
London	c
next	c
week	c
.	c

The	i
programme	i
which	i
you	i
've	i
organised	i
we	i
find	i
very	c
interesting	c
especially	i
the	c
river	c
trip	c
to	c
Greenwich	c
.	c

There	c
is	c
only	c
one	c
thing	c
that	c
we	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
change	c
,	c
if	c
you	c
would	c
n't	c
mind	c
.	c

The	c
latest	c
fashions	c
will	c
be	c
shown	c
there	c
and	c
many	c
useful	c
tips	c
about	c
make-up	c
and	c
hairstyles	c
will	c
be	c
given	c
.	c

So	c
we	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
a	c
disco	c
and	c
this	c
fashion	c
show	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
for	c
us	c
to	c
learn	c
something	c
about	c
styling	c
.	c

As	c
we	c
are	c
from	c
the	i
small	c
town	c
we	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
any	c
possibility	i
to	c
learn	c
about	c
this	c
.	c

It	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
good	c
solution	c
.	c

In	c
every	c
country	c
there	c
are	c
the	i
famous	c
people	c
who	c
are	c
in	i
the	c
middle	i
of	c
the	i
public	c
attention	c
.	c

They	c
are	c
always	c
expected	c
to	c
be	c
beautiful	c
,	c
intelligent	c
,	c
good-looking	c
.	c

This	c
is	c
very	c
stressful	c
.	c

That	c
's	c
why	c
it	c
's	c
very	c
important	c
for	c
these	c
people	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
private	c
life	c
without	c
journalists	c
where	c
they	c
can	c
relax	c
and	c
where	c
they	c
do	c
n't	c
need	c
to	c
be	c
superstars	c
.	c

Otherwise	c
they	c
can	c
get	i
soul	i
problems	c
,	c
fall	i
in	i
deep	c
depressions	i
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
it	c
must	c
be	c
awful	c
to	c
know	c
that	c
you	c
are	c
observed	c
by	c
journalists	c
or	c
other	c
people	c
,	c
your	c
fans	c
for	c
example	c
all	i
24	c
hours	c
in	i
a	c
day	c
,	c
and	c
the	i
all	i
things	c
you	c
do	c
in	c
your	c
life	c
are	c
published	c
and	c
the	c
whole	c
world	c
knows	c
who	c
is	i
your	i
friend	i
,	c
where	c
you	c
go	c
shopping	c
,	c
who	c
you	c
love	c
in	i
and	c
who	c
you	c
sleep	c
with	c
.	c

On	i
my	i
opinion	i
this	c
is	c
the	c
worst	c
thing	c
that	c
can	c
ever	c
happen	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
we	c
should	c
have	c
a	c
little	c
bit	c
respect	i
for	c
the	i
famous	c
people	c
and	c
let	i
them	c
some	c
time	c
for	c
their	c
private	c
life	i
.	c

It	c
had	i
been	i
a	c
real	c
joy	c
to	c
receive	c
your	c
and	i
I	c
still	c
ca	c
n't	c
believe	c
it	c
.	c

In	c
answer	c
to	c
your	c
letter	c
,	c
you	c
will	c
find	c
below	c
the	c
informations	i
you	c
need	c
.	c

I	c
start	c
my	c
first	c
job	c
on	c
August	c
1st	c
,	c
that	c
's	c
why	c
I	c
must	c
travel	c
on	i
July	c
.	c

I	c
ca	c
n't	c
change	c
anymore	i
the	c
date	c
of	i
umployment	i
because	c
I	c
signed	c
the	c
contract	c
a	c
month	c
ago	c
:	i
I	c
hope	c
it	i
will	c
not	c
make	i
problems	i
to	i
you	i
.	c

I	c
've	c
always	c
dreamed	c
about	c
climbing	c
but	c
I	c
never	i
have	i
the	c
opportunity	c
to	c
discover	i
this	c
sport	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
saw	c
you	i
propose	i
this	c
sport	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
really	c
excited	c
.	c

For	c
the	c
second	c
activity	c
,	c
I	c
will	c
choose	c
sailing	c
.	c

I	c
've	c
done	i
sailing	c
for	c
more	c
than	c
ten	c
years	c
and	c
I	c
really	c
enjoy	c
it	c
.	c

Moreover	c
I	c
was	i
sailing	i
teacher	c
on	i
summers	i
the	i
past	i
few	i
years	i
.	c

Or	c
can	c
I	c
retire	i
some	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
?	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
.	c

G	c
Morin	c

first	i
,	c
lessons	c
are	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
part	c
of	c
what	c
school	c
wants	c
to	c
provide	c
us	c
.	i

But	c
there	c
are	c
also	c
a	c
lots	i
of	c
clubs	c
and	c
activities	c
that	c
take	i
part	i
in	i
the	c
daily	c
life	c
of	c
pupils	c
.	c

That	c
's	c
why	c
they	c
both	c
have	c
to	c
be	c
taken	c
in	i
account	c
in	c
the	c
video	c
we	c
will	c
make	c
.	c

The	c
most	c
interesting	c
lessons	c
for	c
pupils	c
are	c
lessons	c
in	c
which	c
we	i
can	c
do	c
something	c
real	c
,	c
concrete	c
.	c

And	c
especially	c
the	c
practical	c
work	c
.	c

It	c
would	c
be	c
great	c
if	c
we	c
show	i
it	i
in	c
our	c
film	c
,	i
it	i
might	c
be	i
also	i
very	c
interesting	c
to	c
watch	c
it	c
.	c

After	c
all	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
not	c
important	c
the	i
one	c
we	c
will	c
show	c
.	i

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
,	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
seen	c
an	c
advertisement	c
in	c
the	c
times	i
about	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
.	c

It	c
will	c
be	c
attended	i
in	c
the	c
Central	c
Exhibition	c
Hall	c
in	c
London	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
14	c
.	c

On	c
Wednesday	c
we	c
could	c
enjoy	c
our	c
free	c
time	c
doing	i
shopping	c
,	c
so	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
afternoon	c
we	c
moved	i
have	c
time	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
visit	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
will	c
take	c
my	c
proposal	c
in	i
favoreable	i
consideration	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

What	c
was	c
so	c
dangerous	c
and	c
why	i
I	i
had	i
to	i
do	i
it	i
?	c

Now	c
I	c
will	c
tell	c
you	c
in	c
brief	c
what	i
exactly	i
happened	c
to	c
me	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
fantastic	c
sunny	c
day	c
of	i
August	c
and	c
my	c
friends	c
and	c
I	c
took	c
a	c
day	c
off	c
from	c
work	c
.	c

For	c
me	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
big	c
problem	c
because	c
I	c
had	c
never	c
had	c
swimming	c
lessons	c
before	i
and	c
my	c
friends	c
did	c
n't	c
know	c
about	c
that	c
.	c

I	c
did	c
n't	c
want	c
to	c
tell	c
them	c
because	c
I	c
was	c
sure	c
they	c
would	c
have	c
started	c
laughing	c
of	i
me	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
took	c
the	c
decision	c
to	c
go	c
and	c
join	c
them	c
also	i
if	i
I	c
knew	c
that	c
it	c
would	c
have	i
been	i
dangerous	c
for	i
my	i
life	i
.	c

I	c
walked	i
very	c
slowly	c
through	c
the	c
water	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
scared	c
but	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
because	c
if	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
go	c
my	c
friends	c
could	i
understand	i
that	c
something	c
was	c
wrong	c
with	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
been	i
recently	i
in	i
London	c
and	c
I	i
've	i
seen	i
the	c
art	i
"	c
Over	c
The	i
Rainbow	c
"	c
at	c
The	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
.	c

It	c
should	c
start	i
at	c
19.30	c
and	c
it	c
had	i
at	c
20:15	c
!	c

But	c
the	c
worst	c
thing	c
in	i
"	c
London	c
's	c
newest	c
and	c
best	c
musical	c
show	c
"	c
,	c
as	c
you	c
called	c
it	c
,	c
was	c
the	c
abscentness	i
of	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
.	c

The	c
actor	c
wich	i
was	c
"	c
dancing	c
"	c
was	c
horrible	c
.	c

He	c
had	i
been	i
mistakeing	i
all	c
the	c
time	c
.	c

At	i
the	c
advertisement	c
,	c
there	i
was	c
written	c
"	c
your	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
"	c
.	c

I	c
want	c
you	c
to	c
give	c
me	c
back	c
my	c
money	c
,	i
I	c
hope	c
that	c
in	c
future	c
you	c
will	c
corect	i
all	c
this	i
mistakes	c
.	c

One	c
day	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
going	c
to	c
school	c
by	c
bus	c
and	c
I	i
do	c
n't	c
know	c
why	c
I	i
went	c
to	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
looked	c
up	c
and	c
I	c
saw	c
her	c
,	c
standing	c
next	c
to	c
me	c
with	c
her	c
friend	c
.	c

Her	c
name	c
was	c
Sue	c
and	c
she	c
was	c
so	c
beautiful	c
that	c
I	c
still	c
ca	c
n't	c
find	c
words	c
which	c
could	c
be	c
good	c
to	c
describe	c
her	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
in	c
Love	c
but	c
that	c
was	c
n't	c
nice	c
.	c

That	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
be	c
a	c
joke	c
from	c
my	c
"	c
coleagues	i
"	c
!	c

The	c
worst	c
thing	c
in	c
this	c
story	c
is	c
,	i
that	c
Pat	c
told	c
this	c
to	c
everyone	c
at	c
school	c
.	c

Thanks	c
to	c
Pat	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
recently	c
taken	c
part	c
in	c
your	c
International	c
Arts	c
Festival	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
great	c
idea	c
to	c
put	c
together	c
different	c
countries	c
to	c
organise	c
this	c
Festival	i
.	c

Each	c
one	c
was	c
fantastic	c
and	i
fill	i
in	i
with	i
euration	i
,	c
but	c
I	c
'd	c
appreciate	c
more	c
place	i
,	c
because	c
unfortunately	c
some	c
concert	c
halls	c
were	c
too	c
small	c
!	c

You	c
certainly	c
saw	c
that	c
plays	i
and	c
films	c
had	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
success	c
.	c

It	c
could	c
be	c
an	c
advantage	i
!	c

An	i
other	i
excellent	c
thing	c
was	c
your	c
choice	c
for	c
the	c
entry	i
.	c

That	c
was	c
simpler	c
than	c
an	i
other	c
way	c
of	c
selling	c
tickets	c
(	c
practical	c
and	c
attractive	i
)	c
.	c

It	c
would	c
be	c
better	c
if	c
people	c
have	i
had	i
the	c
possibility	i
to	c
let	i
their	c
cars	c
very	c
near	c
to	c
the	c
Festival	i
during	c
the	c
week-end	i
!	c

I	c
am	c
sure	c
you	c
'll	c
pay	c
attention	c
to	c
my	c
suggestions	c
and	c
advice	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
seeing	c
you	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

That	i
was	c
a	c
Sunday	c
and	c
,	c
as	c
always	c
,	c
Mark	c
was	c
very	c
excited	c
.	c

They	c
were	c
near	c
a	c
little	c
house	c
,	i
built	c
in	i
wood	c
and	c
began	c
walking	c
.	c

The	c
sun	c
was	c
shining	c
and	c
Mark	c
was	c
really	c
happy	c
to	c
be	c
outside	c
with	c
his	c
family	c
.	c

They	c
ate	c
with	c
the	c
owner	c
of	c
the	c
little	c
house	c
,	c
whose	c
name	c
was	c
John	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
very	c
quiet	c
because	c
they	c
were	c
in	c
nature	i
;	c
they	c
could	c
just	c
hear	c
cows	i
and	c
John	c
's	c
two	c
dogs	c
.	c

Mark	c
was	c
very	c
interested	c
in	c
building	c
small	c
things	c
with	c
John	c
.	c

He	c
was	c
able	c
to	c
make	c
different	c
objects	c
in	i
wood	c
.	c

After	c
that	c
,	c
marks	i
father	c
who	i
had	i
fluent	c
traditional	c
Swiss	c
language	c
spent	i
time	c
with	c
an	c
old	c
woman	c
he	c
had	c
just	c
met	c
near	c
the	c
house	c
.	c

Mark	c
was	c
such	i
happy	c
but	c
very	c
exhausted	c
to	c
recognize	i
this	c
story	i
nevertheless	i
this	c
story	c
happened	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
ago	c
.	c

I	c
ca	c
n't	c
believe	c
it	c
but	c
I	c
'm	c
really	c
pleased	c
to	c
hear	c
that	c
I	c
won	c
first	c
prize	c
.	c

Firstly	c
I	i
can	c
travel	c
only	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
I	c
'm	c
studying	c
at	c
college	c
until	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
June	c
and	c
in	c
August	c
I	c
'm	c
travelling	c
Greece	i
for	c
one	c
months	i
.	c

I	c
'll	c
tell	c
you	c
two	i
activities	c
I	c
chose	c
.	c

I	c
go	c
swimming	c
once	c
a	c
week	c
.	c

I	c
like	c
swimming	c
because	c
I	c
can	c
relax	c
in	c
water	c
.	c

How	c
much	c
money	c
should	c
I	c
bring	c
?	c

Can	c
I	c
change	c
money	c
for	i
US	c
dollars	c
there	c
?	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

'	c
Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c
'	c

They	c
do	c
n't	c
fancy	c
going	c
into	c
the	c
crowdy	i
shop	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
very	c
boring	c
and	c
tiring	c
to	c
be	c
kept	c
waiting	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
;	c

I	c
recieved	i
your	c

letter	i
for	c
having	c
won	c
the	c
first	c

in	c
your	c

I	c

second	c
week	c
of	c
July	c
,	c
because	c
that	c
is	c
when	c
my	c
winter	c
holidays	c
starts	i
.	c

Answering	i
another	c
of	c
your	c
questions	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
more	c
likely	c
to	i
stay	c
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
considering	i
that	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
to	i
weeks	c
in	c
the	c
camp	c
.	c

They	c
are	c
much	c
more	c
confortable	i
than	c
tents	c
.	c

I	i
's	i
been	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
since	c
I	c
last	c
wrote	c
to	c
you	c
.	c

The	c
band	c
played	c
at	c
my	c
school	c
so	c
we	c
could	c
raise	c
money	c
for	c
our	c
graduation	c
trip	c
.	c

I	c
asked	c
them	c
if	c
they	c
could	c
play	c
at	c
our	c
school	c
and	c
they	c
told	c
me	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
350	c
pounds	c
.	c

"	c
The	c
Moicznos	c
"	c
are	c
so	c
popular	c
that	c
we	c
sold	c
our	i
every	c
ticket	c
and	c
end	i
up	c
wining	i
2000	c
pounds	c
.	c

I	c
can	c
tell	c
you	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
wonderfull	i
experience	c
.	c

The	c
band	c
thanked	c
me	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
calling	c
them	c
and	c
having	c
everything	c
so	c
well	c
organized	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

Although	c
it	c
was	i
written	i
19.30	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
,	c
the	c
play	c
began	c
at	c
20.15	c
.	c

I	c
also	c
went	c
to	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
being	c
redecorated	c
.	c

She	c
was	c
telling	c
secrets	i
of	c
her	c
friends	c
to	c
the	c
others	c
.	c

One	c
day	c
,	c
her	c
friends	c
got	c
fed	c
up	c
with	c
this	c
and	c
ended	c
their	c
friendship	c
.	c

Then	c
she	c
began	c
to	c
work	c
at	c
a	c
company	c
.	c

Life	c
and	i
harder	c
than	c
anytime	i
for	c
Pam	c
then	c
.	c

She	c
had	c
no	c
friends	c
.	c

One	c
day	c
,	c
she	c
moved	c
to	c
a	c
farm	c
and	c
nobody	c
has	c
heard	c
from	c
her	c
since	c
then	c
.	c

On	c
your	c
announcement	i
foil	i
I	c
read	c
that	c
the	c
actor	c
was	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
but	c
in	c
the	c
show	c
there	c
was	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
:	c
this	c
is	c
the	c
first	c
disappointing	c
thing	c
.	c

The	c
second	c
problem	c
was	c
that	c
the	c
show	c
should	c
have	c
started	c
at	c
19:30	c
;	c
but	c
it	c
did	c
not	c
;	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
!	c

This	c
is	c
a	c
very	c
disappointing	c
thing	c
!	c

So	c
,	c
now	c
I	c
ask	c
you	c
to	c
send	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
really	c
did	c
not	c
enjoy	c
that	c
night	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

Kim	c
,	c
her	c
friend	c
,	c
used	c
to	c
go	c
camping	c
at	c
Sunset	c
Village	c
every	c
year	c
,	c
and	c
that	c
year	c
Kim	c
,	i
asked	c
Pat	c
to	c
come	c
with	c
her	c
.	c

She	c
accepted	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
evening	c
Pat	c
and	c
Kim	c
used	c
to	c
walk	c
along	c
the	c
beach	c
and	c
they	c
used	c
to	c
stop	c
and	c
turn	c
at	c
the	c
Main	c
Rock	c
,	c
a	c
very	c
big	c
rock	c
.	c

Pat	c
was	c
a	c
little	c
bit	c
afraid	c
,	c
but	c
Kim	c
convinced	c
her	c
to	c
follow	c
her	c
saying	c
that	c
she	c
knew	c
the	c
street	c
.	c

But	c
,	c
when	c
they	c
heard	c
a	c
scream	c
,	c
they	c
stopped	c
and	c
,	c
when	c
they	c
saw	c
a	c
shadow	c
coming	c
forward	i
them	c
,	c
they	c
started	c
running	c
,	c
hearing	c
a	c
voice	c
saying	c
:	c
"	c
Our	c
secret	c
!	c
"	c

When	c
they	c
returned	c
to	c
Caan	c
,	c
their	c
town	c
,	c
they	c
promised	c
to	c
keep	c
silence	i
about	c
that	i
.	c

That	c
night	c
Kim	c
heard	c
another	c
scream	c
and	c
the	c
day	c
after	c
she	c
ran	c
to	c
Pat	c
to	c
tell	c
her	c
what	c
she	c
heard	c
.	c

But	c
Kim	i
,	i
and	i
no	i
one	i
else	c
found	c
Pat	c
.	c

To	c
the	c
manager	c
of	c
the	c

I	c
had	c
enjoied	i
to	c
see	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
that	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
presented	c
some	c
night	i
ago	c
;	c
and	c
the	c
actor	i
's	i
Danny	c
Brook	i
performance	c
.	c

The	c
star	c
,	c
the	c
actor	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
there	i
was	c
n't	c
in	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
but	c
there	c
was	c
an	i
other	i
actor	c
,	c
with	i
my	i
great	i
disappoint	i
.	c

Then	c
,	c
in	c
the	c
program	i
I	c
could	c
read	c
a	i
discount	c
available	c
for	i
the	c
tickets	c
,	c
for	c
the	i
groups	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
have	i
that	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
in	i
your	i
answer	i
and	i
in	i
your	i
explanation	i
about	c
this	c
.	c

Your	i
Sincerely	c

Some	c
days	c
ago	c
,	c
when	c
the	i
school	c
was	c
ending	i
,	c
Pat	c
and	c
her	c
friends	c
decided	c
to	c
make	i
a	c
party	c
for	c
their	c
friend	c
,	c
Frances	c
,	c
because	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
the	c
school	c
and	i
the	i
Francis	c
's	c
birthday	c
were	c
the	i
same	c
day	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
afternoon	c
she	c
had	c
phoned	c
at	i
a	i
Francis	c
's	c
mother	c
and	c
she	c
explained	i
her	c
the	c
secret	c
,	c
then	c
she	c
phoned	c
at	i
her	c
best	c
friend	c
and	c
she	c
speak	i
about	c
that	c
too	i
;	c
she	c
phoned	c
at	i
many	c
people	c
all	c
the	i
day	c
.	c

Now	c
many	i
people	c
knew	c
the	c
secret	c
but	c
Pat	c
said	i
everyone	c
:	c
"	c
I	c
tell	i
you	c
a	c
small	c
secret	c
,	c
but	c
you	i
do	i
n't	i
speak	c
,	i
please	c
!	c
"	c

In	c
the	c
night	c
Francis	c
was	c
invited	c
to	c
the	c
party	c
,	c
at	c
Pat	c
's	c
home	c
.	c

When	c
he	c
was	c
out	c
he	c
needed	c
to	c
buy	c
some	c
cigarettes	c
so	c
he	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
shop	c
where	c
the	c
owner	c
,	c
a	i
his	c
friend	c
,	c
ask	i
him	c
if	c
he	c
was	c
very	c
happy	c
about	c
his	c
present	c
,	c
the	c
new	c
gold	c
watch	c
,	c
he	c
was	c
very	c
lucky	c
to	c
have	c
best	c
friends	c
like	c
Pat	c
and	c
her	c
friends	c
.	c

The	i
Francis	i
's	i
secret	i
was	i
discovered	i
!	c

Now	c
all	i
the	i
Pat	i
's	i
friend	i
do	i
n't	i
tell	c
her	c
about	c
their	c
secrets	c
because	c
Pat	c
is	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

The	c
advirtisement	i
I	c
had	c
read	c
did	c
not	c
match	i
the	c
performance	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
unpleasantly	c
amazed	i
no	i
discounts	c
were	c
available	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
not	c
have	i
complained	i
if	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
had	c
been	c
open	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

How	c
has	c
modern	c
technology	c
changed	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
?	c

Today	c
it	c
is	c
used	c
practically	c
in	c
all	c
spheres	c
and	c
its	c
influence	c
on	c
people	c
is	c
not	c
unnoticable	i
.	c

With	c
the	c
help	c
of	c
"	i
Internet	c
"	c
it	c
is	c
possible	c
to	c
get	c
much	i
objective	c
and	c
useful	c
information	c
you	c
are	c
interested	c
in	c
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
modern	c
technology	c
affects	c
everybody	c
,	c
but	c
in	c
different	c
ways	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
delighted	c
to	c
answer	i
you	i
back	i
to	c
give	c
you	c
more	c
informations	i
about	c
me	c
since	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
such	c
a	c
nice	c
price	i
.	c

It	c
would	c
be	c
nice	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
tent	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
been	c
camping	c
and	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
try	c
it	c
,	c
at	c
least	c
once	c
.	c

The	c
list	c
of	c
activities	c
that	c
you	c
have	c
is	c
very	c
interesting	c
so	c
my	c
choice	c
was	c
very	c
difficult	c
to	c
make	c
but	c
I	c
have	c
finally	c
decided	c
to	c
chose	i
sailing	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
sailing	c
for	c
five	c
years	c
now	c
and	c
enjoy	c
it	c
very	c
much	c
.	c

Also	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
if	c
it	c
is	c
better	c
to	c
exchange	c
my	c
money	c
in	c
England	c
or	c
in	c
the	c
USA	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

What	c
you	c
expect	c
when	c
you	c
go	c
shopping	c
,	c
generally	c
with	c
a	c
friend	c
or	c
two	c
,	c
is	c
wandering	i
around	c
and	c
looking	i
at	c
everything	c
.	c

Having	c
money	c
and	c
be	i
able	c
to	c
spend	c
it	c
in	i
anything	c
you	c
want	c
is	c
brilliant	c
therefore	c
you	c
try	c
to	c
turn	c
it	c
in	i
an	c
enjoyable	c
moment	i
.	c

The	c
nightmare	c
starts	c
when	c
you	c
find	c
out	c
that	c
the	c
items	c
you	c
like	c
the	c
most	c
are	c
also	c
the	c
most	c
expensive	c
.	c

To	c
conclude	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
say	c
that	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
nice	c
moment	i
shopping	c
you	c
had	c
better	c
to	i
save	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
money	c
and	c
buy	c
something	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
you	c
see	c
it	c
or	c
be	c
very	c
patient	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
that	c
the	c
students	c
of	c
my	c
class	c
have	c
seen	c
an	c
advertisment	i
about	i
The	i
London	c
Fashion	c
And	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
making	c
such	c
a	c
good	c
plan	c
,	i
for	c
us	c
,	c
so	c
we	c
could	i
have	c
a	c
good	c
time	c
.	c

Then	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
explain	c
to	c
you	c
about	i
The	i
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
.	c

Finally	c
how	i
the	c
programme	c
could	c
be	c
changed	c
.	c

The	c
London	c
Fashion	c
And	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
is	c
taking	c
place	c
in	c
Central	i
Exhibition	c
Hall	c
in	c
London	c
and	c
happens	i
on	c
Tuesday	c
March	c
14	c
.	c

From	c
ten	c
o'clock	c
in	c
the	c
morning	c
till	c
seven	c
o'clock	c
in	c
the	c
afternoon	i
.	c

The	c
reason	c
that	c
I	c
suggest	c
that	c
we	c
go	c
is	c
that	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
because	c
we	c
can	c
see	c
the	c
latest	c
fashions	c
,	c
leisure	i
and	c
sports	c
wear	c
as	c
well	c
as	c
make	i
up	i
and	c
different	i
hairstyles	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

I	c
did	c
not	c
have	c
any	c
choice	c
since	c
my	c
brother	c
was	c
in	c
trouble	c
.	c

As	c
I	c
knew	c
the	c
teknics	i
to	c
break	c
in	i
a	c
place	c
without	c
being	c
noticed	c
,	c
I	c
should	c
not	c
be	i
afraid	c
but	c
tonight	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
steal	c
the	c
most	c
precious	c
diamond	c
in	c
the	c
country	c
which	i
was	c
very	c
well	c
secured	i
.	c

Then	c
I	c
approached	c
slowly	i
the	i
door	i
,	c
broke	c
the	c
lock	c
and	c
opened	c
the	c
door	c
.	c

There	c
were	c
laisers	i
all	c
over	c
the	c
place	c
,	c
with	i
which	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
be	c
careful	c
with	i
.	c

I	c
ran	c
towards	c
the	c
diamond	c
grabed	i
it	c
got	i
out	c
quickly	c
,	c
ran	i
out	c
of	c
the	c
back	c
door	c
.	c

By	c
surprise	i
I	c
saw	c
a	c
car	c
waiting	c
for	c
me	c
outside	c
.	c

I	c
got	c
into	c
the	c
car	c
gave	i
the	c
jewelry	i
in	c
exchange	c
of	i
my	c
brother	c
,	c
took	c
him	c
and	c
left	c
the	c
place	c
.	c

Dear	c

to	c
thank	c
you	c

us	c
.	c

We	c

The	c

what	i
is	c
very	i
esencial	i
for	c
young	c

However	c
,	c
we	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
