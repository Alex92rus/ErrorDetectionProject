Thirdly	c
,	c
it	c
mentioned	c
about	c
discounts	c
.	c

We	c
can	c
just	c
put	c
some	c
thin	c
pads	c
in	c
there	c

We	c
can	c

DECEMBER	c
12TH	c

I	c
WANT	c
TO	c
THAK	i
YOU	c
FOR	c
PREPARING	c
SUCH	c
A	c
GOOD	c
PROGRAMME	c
FOR	c
US	c
AND	c
ESPECIALLY	c
FOR	c
TAKING	c
US	c
TO	i
THE	c
RIVER	c
TRIP	c
TO	c
GREENWICH	c
.	c

That	c
is	c
why	c
I	c
think	c
the	c
trip	c
to	c
the	c
science	c
museum	c
is	c
a	c
good	c
idea	c
.	c

We	c
are	c
attracted	c
to	c
this	c
show	c
and	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
.	c

Apparently	c
,	c
this	c
show	c
is	c
free	c
to	c
all	c
students	c
,	c
which	c
means	c
if	c
we	c
went	c
,	c
the	c
cost	c
of	c
the	c
trip	c
will	i
be	c
cut	i
down	i
.	c

They	c
struggle	c
to	c
survive	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
as	c
we	c
approach	c
the	c
future	c
,	c
our	c
homes	c
will	c
start	c
to	c
change	c
.	c

Recently	c
I	c
was	c
at	c
the	c
annual	c
international	c
arts	c
festival	c
,	i
that	c
you	c
organized	c
.	c

Then	i
,	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
mark	i
,	i
that	c
concert	i
halls	c
were	c
too	c
small	c
,	c
that	c
is	c
why	c
they	c
were	c
overcrowded	c
during	c
some	c
concerts	c
.	c

May	i
be	i
you	c
should	c
make	i
more	c
next	c
year	c
?	i

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
,	c

I	c
was	i
to	c
Circle	i
Theatre	c
to	c
watch	c
'	i
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
'	c
musical	c
show	c
,	c
recently	c
.	c

My	c
expectations	c
were	c
high	c
after	c
I	i
've	i
read	c
your	c
leaflet	c
in	c
which	c
it	c
was	c
advertised	c
as	c
'	c
London	c
's	c
newest	c
and	c
best	c
musical	c
show	c
'	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	i
,	c

Paul	c
could	c
n't	c
stand	c
it	c
.	c

He	c
felt	c
very	c
ashamed	c
and	c
did	c
n't	c
know	c
what	c
to	c
do	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
a	c
dream	i
becames	i
true	i
and	c
was	c
really	c
unexpected	c
for	c
me	c
!	c

If	i
no	i
,	c
what	c
do	c
you	c
sugest	i
?	c

I	c
just	c
did	c
not	c
enjoyed	i
when	i
they	c
were	c
making	i
the	i
instruments	i
work	c
for	c
the	c
big	c
day	c
.	c

The	c
festival	c
was	c
excenent	i
in	c
many	c
ways	c
,	c
and	c
especially	i
it	c
being	c
an	c
international	c
festival	c
was	c
a	c
challenging	c
,	c
but	c
brilliant	c
idea	c
.	c

Also	c
,	c
some	c
of	c
the	c
concert	c
halls	c
where	c
the	c
musicians	c
performed	c
were	c
not	c
big	c
enough	c
for	c
the	c
vast	c
number	c
of	c
audiences	i
.	c

I	c
hope	c
that	c
next	c
year	c
's	c
festival	c
will	c
be	c
much	c
more	c
successful	c
that	i
this	c
year	c
's	c
one	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

The	c
carbon	i

are	i
growing	c
very	c
fast	c
and	c
people	c
cut	c
more	i

therefore	c
not	i
enough	c

In	c
answer	c
your	i
questions	c
:	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
tents	c
to	c
log	c
cabins	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
should	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
some	c
questions	c
.	c

What	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
should	c
I	c
pack	c
?	c

Also	c
supermarket	c
owners	c
have	c
put	i
in	i
a	c
vast	c
amount	c
of	c
money	c
to	c
find	c
out	c
the	c
best	c
way	c
to	c
place	c
goods	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
get	c
the	c
most	c
profit	c
.	c

The	i
second	i
,	c
the	i
time	i
is	i
late	i
from	i
19.30	i
,	i
it	i
started	i
20.15	i
.	c

It	c
would	c
be	c
fantastic	i
opportunity	c
to	i
the	c
students	c
who	c
study	c
a	i
fashion	c
.	c

Then	c
,	c
he	c
tried	c
to	c
go	c
over	c
the	c
wall	c
,	c
I	c
held	c
his	c
leg	c
.	c

He	c
fell	c
down	c
and	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
stare	c
at	c
each	c
other	c
.	c

But	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
police-man	i
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
I	c
'm	c
very	c
glad	c
to	c
have	c
been	c
choosen	i
and	c
I	c
will	c
do	c
my	c
best	c
for	c
this	c
competition	c
.	c

The	c
other	c
one	c
I	c
would	c
choose	c
is	c
basketball	c
becouse	i
I	c
'm	c
tall	c
and	c
very	c
fast	c
with	c
the	c
ball	c
.	c

Finally	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
are	i
we	i
supposed	c
to	c
wear	c
there	c
,	c
and	c
about	c
the	c
money	c
we	c
are	c
supposed	c
to	i
pay	c
for	c
food	c
and	c
things	c
like	c
that	c
.	c

Clara	c

It	c
was	c
very	c
well	c
organised	c
,	i
the	i
shows	i
started	c
in	i
the	i
exactly	c
time	i
and	c
the	c
group	c
were	i
well	i
performed	i
too	c
.	c

I	c
prefer	i
stay	i
in	c
cabin	i
because	c
I	c
have	i
some	c
experience	c
with	i
tents	c
from	i
my	c
childhood	c
and	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
very	i
good	c
experience	c
therefore	i
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
cabin	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
a	c
few	c
things	c
,	c
specialy	i
wheather	i
:	c
how	i
is	c
the	c
weather	c
in	i
July	c
in	c
the	c
U.S.A.	i
What	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	i
will	i
need	c
and	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	i
should	i
take	c
with	c
me	c
,	i
Because	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
been	c
U.S.A.	i
before	c
and	i
I	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
anything	c

Your	i
sincerely	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
with	c
reference	c
to	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
I	c
saw	c
last	c
week	c
in	c
your	c
theatre	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
must	c
complain	c
that	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
started	c
almost	c
an	c
hour	c
later	i
and	c
in	c
addition	c
to	c
this	c
anyone	i
did	i
n't	i
excuse	i
.	c

Moreover	c
I	i
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
why	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
which	i
is	c
my	c
favourite	c
actor	c
,	c
did	c
n't	c
play	i
in	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

I	c
really	c
like	c
Dora	c
and	c
Pat	c
and	c
I	c
just	c
wanted	c
to	c
help	c
them	c
to	c
be	c
together	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
such	c
a	c
good	c
idea	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
the	c
first	c
time	c
I	c
was	i
going	i
to	i
go	i
to	c
a	c
musical	c
show	c
but	c
I	c
guess	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
the	c
last	c
one	c
too	c
.	c

We	c
were	c
never	c
disappointed	c
so	i
far	i
and	c
especially	c
enjoyed	c
"	c
The	c
Drama	c
"	c
you	c
presented	c
last	c
year	c
.	c

Afterwards	i
we	i
are	c
used	c
to	c
eat	i
at	c
your	c
restaurant	c
which	c
is	c
not	c
only	c
well	c
known	c
for	c
it	c
's	c
good	c
price	i
value	c
but	c
also	c
for	c
it	c
's	c
original	c
decoration	i
.	c

yours	c
faithfully	c

Coming	c
back	c
,	c
I	c
noticed	c
that	c
my	c
clothes	c
were	c
missing	c
.	c

Of	c
course	c
she	c
told	c
everything	c
to	c
my	c
husband	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
a	c
famous	c
exhibition	c
,	c
where	c
are	i
showed	i
latest	i
fashions	i
,	i
leisure	i
and	i
sports	i
wear	i
,	i
make	i
up	i
and	i
hairstyles	i
.	c

My	c
dream	c

My	c
father	c
was	c
sitting	c
next	c
to	c
me	c
thinking	i
that	c
I	c
was	c
crazy	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
boring	c
for	c
everybody	c
.	c

O.	c
Labro	c

She	c
could	c
n't	c
keep	c
my	c
secret	c
and	c
everybody	c
knew	c
which	c
boy	c
I	c
was	c
in	c
love	c
with	c
.	c

She	c
did	c
n't	c
tell	c
me	c
yet	i
but	c
when	c
I	c
came	c
in	i
class	i
everybody	c
was	c
looking	c
at	c
me	c
and	c
this	c
boy	c
as	c
well	c
.	c

I	c
looked	c
at	c
her	c
and	c
she	c
became	c
pale	c
and	c
suddently	i
left	c
the	c
class	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
n't	c
go	c
back	c
to	c
the	c
class	c
so	c
I	c
went	c
home	c
.	c

There	c
are	c
some	c
things	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
:	i
the	c
tipe	i
(	c
and	c
quantity	c
)	c
of	c
Clothes	c
I	c
will	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
,	c
if	i
it	c
is	c
necessary	c
to	c
take	c
some	c
money	c
and	i
any	c
additional	c
stuff	c
(	c
like	c
raincoates	i
)	c
.	c

Well	c
,	c
that	c
would	i
be	i
all	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
receiving	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

But	c
is	c
n't	c
evil	c
interesting	c
?	c

On	i
the	c
tale	c
"	c
It	c
's	c
a	c
good	c
life	c
"	c
,	c
the	c
author	c
gives	c
much	c
more	c
emphasis	c
to	c
the	i
Witte	c
Anthony	c
than	c
to	c
anyone	c
else	c
in	c
the	c
story	c
.	c

He	c
is	c
the	c
main	c
character	c
,	c
although	c
he	c
is	c
mean	c
,	c
cruel	c
and	c
uningative	i
.	c

He	c
controls	c
the	c
other	c
people	c
using	c
the	c
power	c
of	c
his	c
mind	c
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
even	c
though	c
we	c
know	c
that	c
this	c
character	c
is	c
good	c
and	c
this	c
one	c
is	c
bad	c
,	c
sometimes	c
the	c
good	c
ones	c
are	c
quite	c
boring	c
,	c
and	c
we	c
find	c
the	c
bad	c
one	i
much	c
more	c
interesting	c
.	c

But	c
a	c
clerk	c
said	c
that	c
time	i
for	c
discounts	c
had	c
been	i
finished	i

I	c
was	c
very	c
upset	c
and	c
disappointed	c

At	c
this	c
time	c
,	c
our	c
nation	c
was	c
under	i
a	c

country	c

Now	c
I	c
am	c
in	c
England	c
.	c

Sometime	i
I	c
stay	i
alone	c
all	c
the	i
day	c
but	c
I	c
have	c
contacts	i
with	c
many	c
people	c
.	c

If	c
I	c
'm	c
too	c
tired	c
to	c
go	c
out	c
with	c
my	c
friends	c
I	c
finish	c
my	c
day	c
looking	i
a	c
programme	c
on	c
television	c
.	c

We	c
suggest	c
to	i
swop	i
shopping	c
on	c
tuesday	i
and	i
free	c
time	c
on	c
Wednesday	c
,	c
so	c
we	c
can	c
see	c
the	c
show	c
on	c
tuesday	i
afternoon	c
.	c

On	c
top	c
of	c
everything	c
,	c
the	c
performance	c
began	c
forty-five	c
minutes	c
late	c

Best	c
regards	c

Will	c
we	c
all	c
live	c
in	c
countryside	i
in	c
house	i
surrounded	c
by	c
forest	c
full	c
of	c
animal	c
life	c
?	c

It	c
is	c
already	c
predictable	i
,	i
that	c
very	c
soon	c
all	c
house	i
appliances	c
will	c
be	c
voice	i
controlled	i
.	c

it	i
will	c
be	c
on	c
the	c
14th	c
and	c
we	c
all	c
want	c
to	c
go	c
.	c

This	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
to	c
learn	c
something	c
else	i
because	c
most	c
of	c
us	c
have	c
not	c
been	c
to	c
this	c
kind	c
of	c
show	c
And	i
it	c
is	c
free	c
for	c
students	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
dangerous	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
knew	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
CANNOT	c
EXPRESS	c
HOW	c
THANFUL	i
I	c
AM	c
FOR	c
THIS	c
BEAUTIFUL	c
PRIZE	c
.	c

WELL	c
,	c
THE	c
TWO	c
ACTIVITIES	c
THAT	c
I	c
WOULD	c
TO	i
CHOOSE	c
ARE	c
BASKETBALL	c
AND	c
SINGING	c
.	c

FINALLY	c
,	c
I	c
WOULD	c
APPRECIATE	c
IF	i
YOU	c
LET	c
ME	c
KNOW	c
IF	c
I	c
WILL	c
HAVE	c
TO	c
TAKE	c
SOME	c
CLOTHE	i
OR	c

I	c
am	c

concerning	i
the	c
musical	c

:	c
OVER	c
THE	c
RAINBOW	c

I	c
had	c
a	c
very	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
.	c

Secondly	c
the	c
show	c
had	i
go	i
on	i
19.30	c
pm.	c
In	c
fact	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
20.15	c
pm	c
without	c
any	c
explanations	i
.	c

Everything	c
is	c
possible	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
fun	c
to	c
see	c
this	c
type	c
of	c
gadgets	i
with	i
old	c
clothes	c
,	c
like	c
a	c
dress	c
of	i
the	c
middle-Age	i
.	c

Dear	c
Ms	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
mentioned	c
it	c

but	c
they	c
told	c
me	c
that	c

had	c
ended	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
ago	c
.	c

There	c
were	c
couple	i
of	c
things	c
I	c
noted	c
down	c
during	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

The	c
only	c
way	c
they	c
could	c
move	c
was	c
their	i
feet	c

of	c
all	c
,	c
July	c
is	c
the	c
only	c
month	c

About	c

.	c

Everyone	c
has	c
is	i
own	c
style	c
but	c
it	c
's	c
obvious	c
that	c
many	c
of	c
us	c
is	i
wearing	c
the	c
same	c
clothes	c
like	i
others	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
about	c
plays	i
and	c
films	c
it	i
will	i
be	i
good	c
if	c
you	c
make	i
more	c
because	c
the	c
children	c
like	c
it	i
.	c

It	c
began	c
when	c
my	c
parent	i
sand	i
I	c
were	c
going	c
to	c
the	c
South	c
of	c
France	c
for	c
holidays	i
.	c

After	c
that	c
,	c
it	i
maked	i
a	i
long	i
time	i
that	i
he	i
drove	i
,	c
so	i
we	c
decided	c
to	c
stop	c
to	i
an	i
area	i
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
the	i
life	c
in	c
France	c
are	i
crasy	i
,	c
this	c
is	c
the	c
tradition	c
.	c

This	c
story	c
happened	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
ago	c
.	c

Your	i
Faithfully	c
,	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
thought	i
more	c
than	c
half	c
population	i
of	c
British	i
has	c
"	i
mobile	c
phone	c
"	c
,	i
it	i
is	i
small	c
and	c
compact	c
,	c
much	c
lighter	c
than	c
home	i
telephone	c
,	c
and	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
biggest	c
advantage	i
is	c
you	c
can	c
carry	c
it	c
,	c
so	c
that	c
easy	i
to	c
contact	c
your	c
friend	c
or	c
someone	c
who	i
other	i
,	i
even	i
they	c
can	c
easy	i
to	i
contact	i
you	c
as	c
well	c
,	c
so	c
you	c
can	c
phone	c
anytime	c
you	c
wants	i
,	c
whenever	c
you	c
wants	i
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
as	c
regards	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
due	c
to	c
problems	c
with	c
the	c
pipes	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c

you	c
how	i
my	c
experience	c
was	i
and	c
how	c
great	c

The	c
most	c
exciting	c
thing	c
when	c
you	c
help	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
is	c
that	c
you	c
can	c
meet	c

indeed	c
,	c
I	c
met	c

n't	c
worry	c
,	c
I	c
thought	c
about	c
you	c

he	c
signed	c
an	c
autograph	c
for	c
you	c
,	i
you	i
will	c
find	c
it	c
with	c
this	c
letter	c

Dear	c

Secondly	c

began	i

Althouth	i
with	i

and	c
with	c
the	c

I	c

I	c
could	c

another	c
way	c
to	c

and	c

with	i
others	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c

last	c
1st	c
of	c
May	c

In	c
addition	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
just	c
want	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
the	c
perfect	c
evening	c
that	c
the	c
advertisement	c
said	i
and	c
that	c
we	c
all	c
wished	i
turned	c
out	c
to	c
be	c
a	i
regret	i
for	i
the	c
wasted	c
money	c

I	c
'm	c
including	i
my	c

and	c
this	c
list	c

the	i

In	c

my	i

taking	i
the	i
most	i
out	i
of	i
the	c
discoveries	c

that	c
I	c
'm	c

I	c
was	c

Everything	c
in	c
the	c

the	c

Dear	c

Last	c

I	c
went	c
to	c
The	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
to	c
see	c
over	i

Also	c
the	c

it	i
was	c
late	i
thirty	i
minuts	i
.	c

We	c
just	c
sat	c
on	c
the	i
seat	i
and	i
nothing	c
to	c
do	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
advertisement	c
they	c
said	c
that	c
tickets	i
discounts	c

.	c

Could	c
you	c

I	c

My	c
life	c
have	i
been	c
changed	c
by	c
technological	c
improving	i

Nowadays	c

It	i
will	i
lack	i
of	i
communication	i

If	c
I	c
addicted	i
on	i
internet	i
,	c
it	c
will	i
be	c
problem	i
.	c

And	c
you	c
need	c
some	c
imformation	i
from	c

So	c
I	c
be	i
happy	c
to	c

Center	i
area	c
is	c
the	c
place	c
that	c
the	c
teenager	i
like	c
to	c
go	c
shopping	c
the	i
most	c
.	c

And	c
that	c
's	c
why	c
some	i
time	i
shopping	c
is	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

I	c
dont	i
know	c
why	c
but	c
the	c
summer	c
it	i
is	c
the	c
most	c
beautiful	c
season	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
reading	c
when	c
I	c
suddenly	c
hard	i
a	c
big	c
bang	c
.	c

I	c
only	c
need	c
to	c
touch	c
your	c
teacher	c
and	c
you	c
never	c
need	c
to	c
do	c
any	c
homework	c
again.	c
"	c

He	c
knew	c
everybody	c
,	c
especially	i
Mrs	c
Rilke	c
,	c
an	c
elderly	c
,	c
eagle-eyed	c
teacher	i
in	i
retirement	i
,	c
who	c
lived	c
in	c
a	i
old	c
cottage	c
with	c
her	c
five	c
bad-tempered	c
dogs	c
.	c

After	c
I	c
had	c
opened	c
her	c
gate	c
,	c
she	c
called	c
loudly	c
her	i
five	c
,	c
horrible	c
dogs	c
.	c

To	c
the	c
manager	c
,	c

I	c
also	c
got	i
recently	i
a	c
celular	i
phone	c
and	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
now	i
I	i
lived	c
so	c
long	c
without	c
one	c

because	c
it	c
help	i
to	c
solve	c
the	i
problems	c
so	c
quickly	c
,	c
it	c
's	c
really	c
amazing	c
.	c

But	c
for	c
me	c
,	c
the	c
best	c
thing	c
is	c
definatly	i
the	c
microwaver	i
.	c

For	c
the	c
accommodation	c

I	c
would	c

to	c
stay	c
in	c
tents	c
as	c
I	c
have	c
never	c

Would	c
the	c

quite	c
hot	c

Would	c

to	c
take	c

I	c
handed	c
out	c
refreshment	c
to	c
the	c
pop	c
group	c
's	c
members	c
during	c
breaks	c
-	c
my	c
friends	c
were	c
so	c
jealous	c
of	c
me	c
!	c

Moreover	c
,	c
despite	c
there	c
were	i
some	c
restaurants	c
in	c
the	c
theatre	c
,	c
they	i
had	i
already	i
closed	i
because	i
it	i
was	i
too	i
late	i
,	i
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
coffee	c
but	c
I	c
could	c
not	c
.	c

I	c
should	c
not	c
have	c
gone	c

One	c
year	c
ago	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
boyfriend	c
and	c
he	c
was	c
a	i
perfect	c
man	c
for	c
me	c

I	c
tried	c
to	c
avoid	c
thinking	c
about	c
it	c
but	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c

I	c
heard	c
they	c
were	c
looking	c
for	c
volunteers	c
to	c
help	c
at	c
the	c
pop	c
concert	c

Then	c
we	c

were	c
told	c

MY	c

A	c

FOR	i
IT	i
YOU	i

BELOW	c
MY	c
POINT	c
OF	c
VIEW	c
ABOUT	i
IT	i

ALTHOUGH	c
IT	c
MAY	c

BECAUSE	c

In	c
June	c

in	c
August	c
I	c
will	c

It	c

So	c
I	c
expect	c
nothing	c
less	c
than	c
a	c
full	c

paid	c
to	c

The	c

says	c
the	c

starts	c
at	c
19:30	c

2	c
I	c
was	i
expected	i
that	c
there	c
would	c
be	c
discount	i
available	c
for	c
people	c
who	c
have	c

as	c
it	c

but	c
there	c
was	c
not	c

4	c
I	c
have	i
also	i
thought	i
in	c
the	c
show	c
there	c
was	c
no	i
different	c
actor	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c

Dear	c

I	c
use	c

so	i
sometimes	c
I	c
feel	c

in	c
my	c

Could	c
you	c

should	c
be	c

,	i
are	c
our	i
daily	c
life	c
at	c
our	c

Maybe	c
,	c
this	c
was	c
the	c
worst	c
show	c
I	c
have	c
ever	c
seen	c
and	c
for	c
this	c
I	i

DEAR	c

I	c

THIS	i
TWO	c
ACTIVITIES	c
BECAUSE	c
I	c
USED	c
TO	c
PRACTICE	i
THEM	c
LONG	i
TIME	c
AGO	c
AND	c
BESIDES	c
I	c
WOULD	c
SAY	c
I	c
HAVE	c

TO	c
MAKE	i
THEM	c

IT	c

ARE	i
THE	i
IMAGE	i
OF	i
OUR	i
SCHOOL	i
,	i
I	c
THINK	c
THE	c
VIDEO	c
WOULD	c
ENCOURGE	i
STUDENTS	c
TO	c
DO	c
SPORTS	c
AND	c
BE	c
GOOD	c
ATHLETS	i
.	c

I	c
have	c
received	c
a	c
letter	c
from	c
you	c
saing	i
that	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
and	c
you	c
need	c
some	c
information	c
from	c
me	c

Yours	c

How	c
is	c
everything	c
?	c

I	c
bought	c
a	c
new	c
T.V.	c
,	i
it	i
's	i
very	c
big	c
and	c
I	c
love	c
it	c
!	c

and	i
its	i
one	c
of	c
my	c
favorites	i
and	c
as	c
you	c
know	c
I	c
have	c
a	c
cousin	c
that	c
works	c
as	c
a	i
organizer	c
for	c
all	c
the	c
bands	c
that	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
concert	c
in	c
brazil	i
and	c
when	c
my	c
cousin	c
knew	c
that	c
my	c
favorite	i
band	c
was	c
coming	c
he	c
called	c
me	c
and	c
told	i
me	c
that	i
if	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
help	c
them	c
to	c
install	c
the	c
speakers	c
,	c
microphones	c
etc	c
...	c

We	c
could	c
n't	c
believe	c
it	c
.	c

We	c
were	c
very	c
disappointed	c
because	c
before	c
this	c
happened	c
we	c
pouded	i
the	c
tickets	c
but	c
there	c
were	c
no	c
discounts	c
available	c
.	c

Then	c
we	c
expected	c
to	c
,	i
see	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
.	c

My	c
friends	c
and	c
I	c
demand	c
our	c
money	c
bacck	i
real	i
soon	c
.	c

And	c
please	c
do	c
not	c
be	c
very	c
suprised	i
If	i
you	c
recieve	i
more	c
letters	c
about	c
this	c

But	c
I	c
was	c
sure	c
he	c
would	c
tell	i
nothing	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
suggested	i
you	i
to	i
come	i
to	c
our	c
party	c
and	c
we	c
would	c
like	c
not	i
to	c
tell	i
anything	i
to	i
your	i
husband	i
because	c
the	c
party	c
is	c
a	c
surprise	c
.	c

Now	c
all	c
the	c
problems	c
will	c
finish	c
and	c
we	c
will	c
start	c
a	c
new	c
life	c
.	c

Concerning	c
accommodation	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
log	c
cabins	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
know	c
if	c
I	c
need	c
any	c
particular	c
clothes	c
or	c
if	c
there	c
could	c
be	c
any	c
extra	c
expenses	c
for	c
the	c
camp	c
.	c

Lots	c
and	c
lots	c
of	c
kisses	c
,	c

With	c
T.V	i
we	c
can	c
learn	c
,	i
what	c
is	c
going	c
on	c
all	c
over	c
the	c
world	c
.	c

All	c
these	i
may	c
be	i
sounds	i
great	c
,	c
but	c
they	i
are	i
n't	i
all	c
.	i

This	c
is	c
also	c
another	c
reason	i
of	c
heard	i
attacts	i
.	c

I	c
find	i
it	c
will	c
be	c
much	c
more	c
comfortable	c
than	c
a	c
tent	c
.	c

The	c
other	c
activity	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
try	c
is	c
photography	c
.	c

What	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
would	c
be	c
appropriate	c
,	c
winter	c
or	c
summer	c
?	c

Are	c
there	c
any	c
food	i
service	i
at	c
the	c
camp	c
?	c

Filming	c
lessons	c
such	c
as	c
grammar	c
lessons	c
and	c
speaking	i
either	i
theory	i
lessons	i
or	i
practice	i
would	c
give	c
a	c
general	c
idea	c
about	c
a	c
day	c
at	c
school	c
and	c
how	c
students	c
work	c
on	c
their	c
lessons	c
.	c

And	c
they	c
'll	c
certainly	c
feel	c
very	c
proud	c
of	c
being	c
at	i
the	c
video	c
.	c

The	c
show	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
when	c
it	c
actually	c
should	c
have	c
started	c
at	c
19:30	c
.	c

While	c
I	c
was	c
waiting	c
I	c
thought	c
I	c
should	c
inform	c
myself	c
about	c
the	c
discounts	c
available	c
,	i
the	i
shocking	c
thing	c
was	c
there	c
were	c
n't	c
any	c
!	c

to	c

out	c

Carlotta	c
never	c

It	c
supposed	i
to	c
start	c
at	c
19.30	c
pm	c
in	c
the	c
evening	c
but	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
wait	c
for	c
more	c
than	c
half	c
an	c
hour	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
n't	c
have	c
my	c
ticket	c
discounted	c
because	c
when	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
buy	c
it	c
they	c
told	c
me	c
that	c
was	c
untrue	c
.	c

Things	i
and	i

our	c

About	c
the	c
Accommodation	c
I	i
would	c
like	c
you	c
to	c
take	c
careful	c
consideration	c
that	i
I	c
am	c
ashmatic	i
so	i
,	i
I	c
would	c
appreciatte	i
it	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
reserve	c
a	c
bed	c
in	c
log	i
cabins	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
choose	c

are	c
my	c
favourites	i

Hi	c
.	c

The	c
first	c
day	c
we	c
have	i
to	c
move	i
to	c
the	c
airport	c
to	c
bring	c
all	c
the	c
equipment	c
by	c
lorries	i
to	c
the	c
camp	c
.	c

All	i
began	c
when	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
take	c
part	c
in	c
that	c
school	c
project	c
.	c

And	c
after	c
having	c
corrected	c
all	c
of	c
them	c
,	c
our	c
teacher	c
told	c
us	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
repeat	c
the	c
exam	c
because	c
he	c
realised	c
we	c
knew	c
what	c
the	c
answers	c
were	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

When	c
I	c
enquired	c
about	c
the	c
discounts	c
,	c
at	i
the	c
cashier	c
they	i
told	c
me	c
that	c
they	c
did	c
n't	c
have	c
any	c
information	c
about	c
it	i
.	c

Pat	c
is	c
n't	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

Last	c
year	c
,	c
Pat	c
and	c
I	c
were	c
driving	c
back	c
home	c
and	c
unfortunately	c
driving	i
too	c
fast	c
I	i
drove	c
through	c
the	c
front	c
gate	c
.	c

Eventually	i
I	i
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
,	i
are	i
about	c
money	c
and	c
clothes	c
.	c

Thirdly	c
if	i
you	c
're	c
fat	c
you	c
wo	c
n't	c
find	c
you	i
size	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
this	c
theatre	c
made	c
me	c
disappointing	i
from	c
starting	i
the	c
show	c
until	c
finishing	i
.	c

Moreover	c
the	i
show	c
was	c
awful	c
.	c

people	i
think	c
that	c
we	c
will	c
wear	c
a	i
simple	c
,	c
practical	c
,	c
light	c
clothes	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
it	c
says	c
in	c
your	c
advertisement	c
that	c
discounts	c
would	c
be	c
available	c
,	c
despite	c
the	c
fact	c
they	c
were	c
not	c
.	c

It	c
appears	c
that	c
people	c
are	c
more	c
aware	c
about	c
clothes	c
and	c
also	c
work	c
.	c

I	c
used	c
to	c
be	c
a	c
tennis	c
player	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
fifteen	c
.	c

The	c
other	c
activity	c
is	c
swimming	c
.	c

I	c
started	c
to	c
learnt	i
when	c
I	c
was	c
five	c
years	c
old	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
a	c
swimming	c
teacher	c
for	c
a	c
year	c
in	c
a	c
sports	c
club	c
.	c

What	c
type	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	i
should	i
bring	c
with	c
me	c
?	c
and	i
is	c
there	c
any	c
equipment	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
bring	c
with	c
me	c
.	i

Yours	c
sincerely	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
have	i
a	c
nice	c
summer	i
time	i
now	c
.	c

Well	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
going	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
about	c
it	c

Your	c
letter	c
which	c
says	c
I	c
won	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
has	c
just	c
been	i
arrived	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
answer	c
your	c
questions	c
about	c
this	c
trip	c

Meanwhile	c
,	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
some	i
questions	i
to	i
you	i

Your	i
sincerely	c

In	c
fact	c
their	i
would	c
be	c
only	c
one	c
possibility	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
I	c
will	c

I	c
am	c

very	c
fond	c

so	c
when	c
I	c
have	i
seen	i
that	c
it	c
is	c
among	c
your	c

it	c
has	i
been	i
a	c

I	c
have	c
just	c
received	c
the	c
letter	c
with	c
the	c
result	c
of	c
your	c
competition	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
lay	c
the	c
emphasis	c
on	c
the	c
fact	c
that	c
this	c
report	c
can	c
be	c
seen	c
by	c
the	c
director	i
of	i
the	i
school	i

Moreover	c
it	c
will	c
show	i

healthy	i
the	c
students	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

We	c
were	c
thinking	c
to	i
get	i
some	i
discount	c
on	c
our	c
tickets	c
,	c
because	c
we	c
had	c
already	i
read	c
from	i
the	c
advertisement	c
but	c
they	c
did	c
n't	c
discount	c
the	c
prices	c
so	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
pay	c
complete	i
money	i
for	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

This	c
would	c
be	c
the	c
first	c
good	c
memory	i
for	c
us	c
from	i
your	c
show	c
.	c

They	c
use	c
all	c
of	c
this	c
because	c
they	c
want	c
to	c
do	c
their	c
work	c
,	i
and	c
leisure	c
activities	c
with	c
this	i
helping	i
kits	i
.	c

Too	c
many	c

Technology	c
has	c
changed	c
our	c
life	c
forever	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
the	c
letter	c
.	c

I	c
must	c
sign	c
off	c
as	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
catch	c
the	c
post	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

I	c
'm	c
very	c
happy	c
for	i
winning	i
the	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
the	c
competition	c
.	c

About	c
accomodation	i
,	c
I	c
prefer	c
in	i
tents	c
to	c
log	c
cabins	c
.	c

Because	i
I	c
have	c
n't	c
used	c
tents	c
for	c
ages	c
so	c
this	c
time	c
,	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
have	c
tents	c
for	c
2	c
weeks	c
which	c
will	c
remind	c
me	c
of	c
my	c
childhood	c
with	c
my	c
family	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

We	c
've	c
been	c
thinking	c
about	c
the	c
plot	c
,	c
at	c
first	c
,	c
and	c
we	c
decided	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
the	c
best	c
way	c
,	c
the	c
flow	c
of	c
time	c
.	c

Every	i
students	i
keep	c
talking	c
about	c
he	i
theme	c
and	c
give	i
their	c
opinions	c
.	c

Because	c
we	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
pub	c
which	c
is	c
situated	c
near	c
to	c
the	c
school	c
quite	c
often	c
and	c
we	c
talk	c
more	c
about	c
personal	c
stories	c
that	c
make	c
us	c
closer	c
,	i
the	i
pub	c
after	c
the	c
lessons	c
will	c
be	c
interesting	c
.	c

Students	c
walking	c
and	c
talking	c
in	c
corridors	c
should	c
be	c
filmed	c
so	c
that	c
we	c
also	c
show	c
how	c
students	c
relax	c
between	c
two	c
lessons	c
.	c

Luckely	i
I	c
could	c
keep	c
my	c
secret	c
for	c
a	c
couple	c
of	c
days	c
but	c
then	c
,	i
it	c
became	c
urgent	c
and	c
I	c
needed	c
someone	c
to	c
talk	c
to	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
received	c
your	c
letter	c
bout	i
the	c
competition	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
glad	c
about	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
on	i
July	c
,	c
please	c
,	c
because	c
that	c
when	i
I	c
am	c
in	i
vacation	c
.	c

Unfortunalety	i
my	c
feelings	c
are	c
rather	c
bad	c
.	c

I	c
liked	c
all	c
the	c
stars	c
and	c
the	c
artists	c
who	c
came	c
from	c
around	c
the	c
world	c
,	c
even	c
if	c
the	c
number	c
of	c
countries	c
was	c
very	c
little	i
,	c
only	c
six	c
.	c

You	c
have	c
to	c
begin	c
your	c
lesson	c
at	c
8.25	c
and	c
wait	c
for	c
the	c
teacher	c
of	c
the	c
next	c
lesson	c
in	c
the	c
class	c
.	c

I	c
like	c
my	c
life	c
,	c
both	c
at	c
school	c
and	c
at	c
home	c
!	c

I	c
just	c
receive	i
your	c
letter	c
with	c
the	c
good	c
news	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
everything	c
looks	c
different	c
if	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
make	i
a	c
present	c
for	c
someone	c
in	c
my	c
family	c
.	c

Watching	c
the	c
show	c
plus	c
the	c
45	c
minutes	c
of	c
delay	c
made	c
us	c
hungry	c
of	c
course	c
so	c
we	c
decided	c
to	c
eat	c
at	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

The	c
best	c
bakery	c
was	c
at	i
the	c
other	c
side	c
of	c
the	c
town	c
so	c
there	c
was	c
no	c
danger	c
for	i
him	c
to	i
see	i
Alison	c
and	c
reveal	i
the	c
party	c
.	c

He	c
went	c
out	c
of	c
his	c
house	c
and	c
got	c
on	c
his	c
bike	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
bakery	c
.	c

But	c
the	c
problem	c
began	c
to	c
increase	i
because	c
all	c
her	c
friends	c
knew	c
her	c
secret	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
like	c
a	c
"	c
chain	c
reaction	c
"	c
,	c
until	c
Maria	c
did	c
n't	c
want	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
school	c
any	i
more	i
,	i
her	i
mother	c
talked	c
to	c
her	c
,	c
but	c
there	c
was	c
no	c
case	i
,	i
she	i
was	c
very	c
angry	c
and	c
hurt	c
.	c

Nowadays	c
,	c
our	c
home	c
life	c
allow	i
us	c
to	c
have	c
more	c
free	c
time	c
to	c
spend	c
doing	c
leisure	c
activities	c
like	c
practising	c
sports	c
or	c
going	c
out	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
one	c
hand	c
,	c
we	c
will	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
spend	c
more	c
time	c
with	c
our	c
family	c
and	c
not	c
to	i
be	i
worried	c
about	c
anything	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
really	c
surprised	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
.	c

My	c
second	c
complain	i
is	c
about	c
some	c
concert	i
halls	c
which	c
are	i
too	c
small	c
.	c

A	i
least	i
suggestion	c
for	c
next	c
year	c
's	c
festival	c
is	c
to	c
invite	c
some	c
"	c
salsa	c
"	c
band	i
,	i
It	c
would	c
be	c
great	c
to	c
listen	c
and	c
dance	c
in	i
the	c
same	c
time	c
"	i
salsa	c
"	c
music	c
.	c

Especially	i
the	i
date	c
was	c
very	c
suitable	c
for	c
me	c
,	c
as	c
I	c
have	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
free	c
time	c
.	c

When	c
it	c
goes	i
to	c
my	c
home	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
I	c
have	c
usual	i
duties	c
I	i
have	c
to	c
clean	c
my	c
room	c
,	c
wash	c
the	c
dishes	c
or	c
vacuum	c
the	c
carpets	c
,	c
but	c
they	c
're	c
not	c
exhausting	c
things	c
,	c
as	c
I	c
share	c
them	c
with	c
my	c
sister	c
and	c
brother	c
.	c

DEAR	c
MR	c
ROBERTSON	c

BUT	c
THAT	c
DAY	c
,	c
LIKE	i
I	c
WAS	c
KIND	c
OF	c
DRUNK	c
,	c
I	c
DID	c
N'T	c
REALISE	c
THAT	c
THE	c
BUS	c
TOOK	c
A	c
DIFFERENT	c
WAY	i
;	i
SO	c
WHEN	i
I	c
NOTICED	c
IT	c
THE	i
DRIVER	c
WAS	c
ALREADY	c
ASKING	c
ME	c
TO	c
GET	c
OFF	c
,	c
BECAUSE	c
WE	c
WHERE	i
IN	c
THE	c
GARAGE	c
IN	c
PORTOBELLO	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
with	c
reference	c
to	c
the	c
international	c
arts	c
festival	c
that	c
you	c
organise	c
every	c
year	c
.	c

As	c
a	c
result	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
impossible	c
for	c
al	i
the	c
audience	c
to	c
fit	c
in	c
there	c
.	c

Dear	c
Kathy	c
,	c

We	c
are	c
supposed	c
not	c
to	c
be	c
late	c
for	c
the	i
lessons	c
and	c
,	c
of	c
course	c
,	c
students	c
must	c
n't	c
smoke	c
at	c
school	c
.	c

After	c
that	c
they	c
changed	c
the	c
principal	c
actor	c
,	c
the	c
one	c
that	c
replaced	c
him	c
was	c
very	c
bad	c
,	c
that	c
made	c
us	c
realy	i
angry	c
.	c

This	c
technology	c
has	c
help	i
in	c
many	c
fields	c
,	c
like	c
medicine	c
,	c
entreteinment	i
,	c
work	c
and	c
other	c
thing	i
,	c
so	c
it	c
has	c
obviusly	i
change	i
the	c
life	i
of	c
many	c
people	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
suggest	i
some	c
requests	c
for	i
the	c
festival	c
.	c

She	c
grew	c
very	c
quick	i
and	c
was	c
so	c
beautiful	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
disappointed	c
because	c
I	c
was	c
longing	c
for	i
seeing	i
them	c
as	i
a	c
fan	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
the	c
developed	c
technology	c
and	c
science	c
will	c
make	c
our	c
life	c
more	c
convenient	c
than	c
now	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
we	c
have	c
to	c
consider	c
about	i
our	c
nature	i
.	c

Also	c
the	i
person	c
was	c
not	c
really	c
good	c
at	c
acting	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
our	c
fashion	i
style	c
at	c
the	c
moment	c
is	i
comes	c
from	c
70's	c
fashion	c
.	c

in	c
future	i
.	c

Firstly	c
I	i
must	c
say	c
that	c
I	c
'll	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
have	c
two	c
weeks	c
free	c
only	c
in	c
July	c
,	c
since	c
I	c
started	i
work	c
and	c
intitled	i
to	c
have	c
a	c
holiday	c
only	c
in	c
July	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
'd	c
prefer	c
to	c
accommodate	i
myself	i
in	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
log	c
cabins	c
,	c
as	c
they	c
are	c
more	c
comfortable	c
,	c
usually	c
have	c
central	c
heating	c
and	c
other	c
necessary	c
facilities	c
.	c

Despite	c
my	c
appriciation	i
of	c
all	c
kinds	c
of	c
sports	c
and	c
activities	c
,	c
I	i
'd	i
choose	i
my	c
favourite	c
ones	c
,	c
which	c
are	c
swimming	c
and	c
tennis	c
.	c

Sincerely	c
,	c
I	c
must	c
admit	c
,	i
that	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
like	c
shopping	c
in	c
supermarkets	c
and	c
big	c
stores	c
.	c

There	c
are	c
always	c
too	c
many	c
people	c
there	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
the	c
letter	c
that	c
conformed	i
first	c
prize	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
not	i
also	i
keen	c
on	c
preparing	c
it	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
going	c
to	c
choose	c
Golf	c
and	c
Tennis	c
.	c

How	c
are	c
you	c
?	c

I	c
could	c
enjoy	c
helping	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
in	i
last	c
week	c
which	c
is	c
"	c
The	c
Max	c
"	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
got	c
good	c
experience	c
and	c
fantastic	c
memory	i
.	c

Now	c
,	c
I	c
able	i
to	c
use	c
sound	i
effect	c
system	c
.	c

If	c
I	c
got	c
a	c
chance	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
work	c
for	c
creative	c
companies	c
,	c
I	c
hope	c
.	c

Answering	i
on	i
our	c
first	c
question	c
about	c
where	c
would	i
I	i
prefer	c
to	c
sleep	c
,	c
I	c
prefer	c
tents	c
because	c
it	i
is	i
closer	c
to	c
nature	c
and	c
I	c
like	c
sleepping	i
in	c
sleepping	i
bags	c
(	c
=BV	c
bags	c
)	c
.	c

Of	c
course	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
joke	c
,	c
but	c
as	c
I	c
have	c
chosen	c
swimming	c
and	c
surfing	c
I	c
will	c
tell	c
you	c
why	c
.	c

Also	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
t-shirt	c
with	c
your	c
signature	i
.	c

Yours	c
scinerly	i

I	c
have	c
always	c
been	c
interesed	i
arts	i
and	c
festivals	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
great	c
that	c
you	c
organised	c
Art	i
Festival	c
in	c
this	c
City	i
,	c
because	c
people	c
realy	i
needed	i
this	c
kind	c
of	c
sochibal	i
activities	i
here	c
.	c

I	c
have	i
spent	i
two	c
days	c
at	c
the	c
International	c
Arts	c
Festival	c
with	c
some	c
of	c
my	c
friend	i
and	c
I	c
must	c
say	c
we	c
realy	i
delighted	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
great	i
idea	c
to	c
do	c
that	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

We	c
alway	i
have	c
to	c
keep	c
clean	i
every	i
where	i
,	c
but	c
this	i
kind	i
of	c
rules	c
are	c
not	c
very	c
strict	c
I	c
believe	c
.	c

Firstly	c
I	i
've	i
to	c
keep	c
clean	i
my	i
room	i
and	c
hoover	c
once	c
a	c
week	c
.	c

Yours	c
Faithfully	i

That	c
is	c
why	c
we	c
have	c
to	c
single	c
out	c
wich	i
lessons	c
and	c
other	c
activities	c
should	c
be	c
filmed	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
we	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
in	i
consideration	i
our	i
enviroment	i
:	c
The	i
pollution	c
makes	c
more	i
and	i
more	i
the	i
atmosphere	i
warmer	i
.	c

"	c
Internet	i
on	c
our	c
body	c
"	c
.	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
with	c
a	c
request	c
for	c
a	c
change	c
in	c
the	c
scedule	i
of	c
our	c
trip	c
to	c
London	c
.	c

Everything	c
seams	c
very	c
interesting	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
sure	c
that	c
we	c
will	c
all	c
have	c
a	c
very	c
good	c
time	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
to	c
see	c
how	c
far	c
I	c
could	c
go	c
this	c
time	c
or	c
,	c
to	c
be	c
more	c
specific	c
,	c
how	c
high	c
!	c

We	c
know	c
that	c
we	c
will	c
spend	c
three	c
days	c
in	c
London	c
in	c
a	c
with	i
a	c
determinate	i
programme	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
a	c
student	c
in	c
English	i
class	c
which	c
going	i
to	c
spend	c
three	c
days	c
in	c
London	c
(	c
13th-14th	c
March	c
)	c
and	c
I	c
'm	c
a	i
representative	i
student	i
from	c
my	c
class	c
to	i
thanks	i
you	c
about	i
your	i
programme	c
that	c
you	c
've	c
already	i
organised	c
for	c
us	c
.	c

Anyway	c
,	c
we	c
still	c
want	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
Science	c
Museum	c
and	c
shopping	i
as	c
well	c
but	c
we	c
think	c
we	c
can	c
go	c
shopping	c
on	c
the	c
last	c
day	i
afternoon	c
of	c
our	c
trip	c
.	c

But	c
we	c
have	c
to	c
accept	c
that	c
everyone	c
has	c
their	c
private	c
life	i
for	i
example	c
when	i
we	c
get	c
married	c
or	c
when	c
policeman	i
stop	i
us	c
on	c
the	c
highway	c
,	c
we	c
do	c
n't	c
want	c
any	c
stranger	c
notice	i
that	i
what	c
is	c
happening	c
to	c
us	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
this	c
is	c
still	c
correct	c
.	c

and	c
I	c
am	c
waiting	c
for	c
your	c
reply	c
.	c

If	c
journalists	c
following	i
you	i
step	i
by	i
step	i
is	i
difficult	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
private	c
life	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
can	c
arrange	c
2	c
weeks	c
in	c
July	c
with	i
my	c
school	c
holidays	c
,	c
in	c
order	c
not	c
to	c
lose	i
classes	c
.	c

How	c
much	c
money	c
should	c
I	c
take	c
to	c
spend	c
in	c
those	c
two	c
weeks	c
?	c
and	c
also	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	i
should	i
take	c
?	c

The	c
Theatre	c
also	c
promised	c
discounts	c
,	c
which	c
were	c
not	c
available	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
pay	c
the	c
full	c
amount	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
not	c
like	c
to	c
take	c
legal	c
action	c
,	c
as	c
it	c
would	c
not	c
be	c
convenient	c
for	c
both	i
of	c
us	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
will	c
if	c
I	c
consider	c
it	c
necessary	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
to	c
help	c
back	i
stages	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
be	c
grateful	c
,	i
if	c
you	c
could	c
understand	i
our	c
concern	c
and	c
change	c
the	c
programme	c
on	c
14th	c
of	c
March	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
in	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
new	c
tecnology	i
has	c
changed	c
,	c
is	c
changeing	i
and	c
will	c
change	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
,	i
I	c
hope	c
that	c
after	i
my	c
life	c
is	i
better	c
.	c

I	c
'M	c
AFRAID	c
I	c
CAN	c
ONLY	c
GO	c
ON	i
JULY	c
BECAUSE	c
DURING	c
THAT	c
TIME	i
I	c
WILL	c
HAVE	c
HOLIDAYS	i
FROM	i
SCHOOL	i
,	c
SO	c
THAT	c
WILL	c
FOR	i
ME	c
THE	c
ONLY	c
POSSIBILITY	i
TO	i
TAKE	i
2	c
WEEKS	c
OFF	c
.	c

I	c
STILL	c
HAVE	c
SOME	c
QUESTIONS	c
:	c

-	c
MY	c
PARENTS	c
AND	c
ME	i
WE	i
ARE	c
NOT	c
SURE	c
HOW	c
MUCH	c
MONEY	c
DO	i
I	c
NEED	c
FOR	c
THE	c
TWO	c
WEEKS	c
,	c
CAN	c
YOU	c
GIVE	c
ME	c
A	c
LITTLE	c
HELP	c
?	c

YOURS	c
SINCERELY	c

H.	c
PENA	c
.	c

AT	c
ABOUT	c
FIVE	c
O'CLOCK	c
EVERYTHING	c
WAS	c
READY	c
AND	c
THE	c
BAND	c
CAME	c
IN	i
,	i
THERE	c
WERE	c
ALREADY	c
PLENTY	c
OF	c
'	i
FANS	i
'	i
WAITING	c
FOR	c
THE	c
CONCERT	c
TO	c
BEGIN	c
,	c
WHICH	c
STARTED	c
AT	c
7	c
O'CLOCK	c
.	c

We	c
all	c
are	c
interested	c
in	c
fashions	i
and	c
hairstyles	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
oppurtunity	i
for	c
as	i
because	c
students	c
have	i
not	i
to	c
pay	c
and	c
we	c
will	c
know	c
what	c
we	c
can	c
buy	c
on	c
our	c
shopping	c
tour	c
.	c

What	c
are	i
you	i
thinking	i
about	c
this	c
suggesten	i
?	c

Your	c
freezer	c
tells	c
you	c
when	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
buy	c
some	c
milk	c
,	c
eggs	c
or	c
chees	i

Or	c
never	i
living	i

office	c
you	i
are	c
able	c
to	c
heat	c
the	c
wather	i
for	c
a	c
hot	c
bath	c
.	c

This	c
was	c
her	c
only	c
fault	c
.	c

But	c
,	c
as	c
the	c
days	c
went	c
by	c
,	c
she	c
was	c
surprised	c
because	c
she	c
realized	c
she	c
was	c
getting	c
used	i
not	c
to	i
tell	i
secrets	c
any	i
more	i
.	c

The	c
morning	c
visiting	i
interesting	c
places	c
in	c
the	c
City	c
and	c
on	i
the	c
afternoon	c
make	i
a	c
trip	c
to	c
Greenwich	c
,	c
which	c
is	c
excellent	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Suddenly	c
I	c
heart	i
somebody	c
crying	c
for	c
the	i
help	c
.	c

Now	c
,	c
when	c
I	c
consider	c
about	i
the	c
events	c
it	i
's	c
clear	c
for	i
me	c
that	c
if	c
I	c
got	c
a	i
few	c
minutes	c
later	c
probably	i
would	i
be	i
to	i
late	c
.	c

The	c
two	c
activities	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
do	c
in	c
the	c
camp	c
are	c
swimming	c
and	c
photography	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
bits	c
from	c
the	c
whole	c
school	c
day	c
should	c
be	c
filmed	c
.	c

Maths	c
is	c
the	c
most	c
popular	c
subject	c
in	c
the	c
school	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
chemistry	c
lab	c
experiments	c
are	c
often	c
set	c
up	c
.	c

The	c
teacher	c
looks	c
after	c
the	c
pupil	i
while	c
they	c
are	c
investigating	c
the	c
topic	c
of	c
the	c
lesson	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
there	c
should	c
more	i
stars	c
and	c
artists	c
from	c
more	c
countries	c
because	c
this	c
year	c
,	c
I	c
believe	c
there	c
were	c
artists	c
only	i
from	i
six	c
countries	c
which	c
,	c
in	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
is	c
not	c
quite	c
from	c
all	c
over	c
the	c
world	c
.	c

Dear	c
Emily	c
,	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
change	c
the	c
rule	c
not	i
to	i
speak	i
in	c
Spanish	c
at	c
school	c
because	c
most	c
of	c
us	c
feel	c
more	c
comfortable	c
speaking	c
in	c
Spanish	c
but	i
I	c
guess	c
to	i
learn	c
.	i

your	c
Pal	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
delighted	c
and	c
already	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
spending	c
two	c
weeks	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
in	c
the	c
U.S.A.	c
.	i

I	c
hope	c
that	c
it	c
would	i
n't	i
be	c
a	c
problem	c
for	c
you	c
and	c
that	c
I	c
can	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
Camp	c
California	c
at	c
some	c
time	c
in	c
July	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
a	c
total	c
beginner	c
in	c
both	c
activities	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
these	c
two	c
weeks	c
will	c
be	c
a	c
good	c
opportunity	c
to	c
learn	c
something	c
about	c
them	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
go	c
shopping	c
again	c
,	c
because	c
the	c
fridge	c
is	c
empty	c
or	c
you	c
need	c
some	c
new	c
clothes	c
,	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
time	c
,	c
patience	c
and	c
straingth	i
are	c
needed	c
.	c

And	c
if	c
you	c
are	c
not	c
quick	c
enough	c
they	c
wo	c
n't	c
leave	c
anything	i
left	i
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
hearing	i
from	c
you	c
.	c

They	c
can	c
travel	c
around	c
the	c
world	c
,	c
buy	c
everything	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
good	c
life	c
,	c
but	c
at	c
the	c
same	c
time	c
,	c
they	c
must	c
be	c
a	i
very	c
good	c
peaple	i
,	c
because	c
"	c
the	i
Famous	i
"	c
is	c
just	c
for	c
a	c
few	i
time	c

nothing	c
is	i
forever	c
in	c
this	c

Your	i

They	c
try	i
so	c
many	c
things	c
to	c

for	i
one	i

everything	c

After	c
morning	c
class	c
they	c
have	c
a	c
lunch	c
time	c
for	c
1	c
hour	c
and	c
continue	c
to	c
study	c
for	c
afternoon	c
class	c
.	c

They	i
must	i
be	i
shown	i
the	i
most	i
well-class	i
in	i
our	i
school	i
.	i

I	c
had	c
to	c
take	c
taxi	i
.	c

She	c
always	c
talks	c
about	c
her	c
private	c
life	c
to	c
me	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
thought	c
we	c
understood	c
each	c
other	c
,	c
because	c
when	c
I	c
talked	c
about	c
my	c
private	c
life	c
to	c
her	c
,	c
she	c
seemed	c
very	c
understandable	i
.	c

I	c
appreciated	c
her	c
and	c
she	c
would	i
n't	i
mind	c
.	c

when	c
I	c
saw	c
that	c
the	c
actor	c
was	c
n't	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
but	c
a	c
different	c
one	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
disappointed	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	i
to	c
have	c
a	c
good	c
meal	c
in	c
the	c
"	c
famous	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
"	c
(	c
that	i
,	c
of	c
course	c
,	c
was	c
closed	c
for	c
a	c
free	i
night	i

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
,	c

But	c
there	c
is	c
something	c
else	c
which	c
we	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
see	c
.	c

I	c
thought	c
we	c
would	c
die	c
.	c

With	c
this	c
amount	c
I	c
could	c
buy	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
art	c
books	c
,	c
and	c
records	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
organising	c
this	c
event	c
was	c
a	c
great	c
idea	c
.	c

There	c
was	c
a	c
terrible	c
lack	c
of	c
room	c
and	c
fresh	c
air	c
inside	c
them	c
.	c

All	c
the	c
things	c
we	c
're	c
not	c
allowed	c
to	c
do	c
depend	c
on	c
them	c
.	c

You	c
ask	c
me	c
when	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
?	c

Finaly	i
I	c
've	c
got	c
a	c
question	c
:	c
What	c
clothes	c
must	c
I	c
bring	c
with	c
me	c
and	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
?	c

yours	c
faithfuly	i
,	c

Sometimes	c
it	c
's	c
very	i
awful	c
when	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
wait	c
very	i
long	c
until	i
it	c
's	c
your	c
turn	c
to	c
pay	c
or	c
to	c
try	c
some	c
clothes	c
on	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
make	c
a	c
suggestion	c
that	c
you	c
could	c
consider	c
for	c
it	c
.	c

The	c
second	c
point	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
make	c
is	c
about	c
the	c
concerts	c
which	c
showed	c
people	c
Jazz	c
,	c
rock	c
and	c
classic	i
,	i
which	c
were	c
fantastic	c
.	c

I	c
see	c
you	c
might	c
not	c
have	c
had	c
much	c
time	c
to	c
be	c
well-organised	c
.	c

As	c
well	c
as	c
that	c
,	c
I	i
expect	i
you	i
plays	i
and	i
films	i
are	i
performed	i
more	i
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

Becoming	c
more	c
strict	c
gradually	c
at	c
home	c
that	c
at	c
school	c
is	c
true	c
as	c
you	c
said	c
.	c

What	c
else	c
,	c
unless	c
they	c
pass	c
the	c
exam	c
they	c
have	c
to	c
get	i
extra	c
lesson	i
or	c
test	i
.	c

I	c
'm	c
writting	i
to	c
you	c
to	c
explain	c
my	i
problem	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
had	c
in	c
your	c
theatre	c
.	c

And	c
by	c
that	c
time	c
I	c
will	c
have	i
already	i
some	c
experience	c
,	c
so	c
that	c
I	c
will	c
more	i
easily	i
able	i
to	i
apply	i
for	c
a	c
really	c
good	c
job	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
which	c
was	c
very	c
disappointed	i
.	c

In	c
addition	c
the	c
concert	c
did	c
n't	c
start	c
on	c
time	c
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
it	i
was	c
n't	c
a	c
perfect	c
evening	c
,	i
I	c
did	c
n't	c
enjoy	c
it	c
at	c
all	c
due	c
to	c
the	c
failure	i
advertisement	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
your	c
show	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
"	c
and	c
the	c
conditions	c
in	c
which	c
it	c
is	c
held	i
.	c

Moreover	c
an	c
English	c
friend	c
of	c
mine	c
had	c
told	c
me	c
that	c
it	c
would	c
purely	i
be	c
a	c
good	c
show	c
as	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
was	c
a	c
very	c
good	c
actor	c
.	c

That	c
's	c
what	c
I	c
learned	c
from	c
my	c
own	c
experience	c
.	c

One	c
day	c
,	c
while	c
I	c
was	c
checking	c
my	c
weekly	c
ticket	c
,	c
I	c
found	c
out	c
that	c
I	c
had	c
five	c
numbers	c
out	c
of	c
six	c
so	c
that	c
I	c
would	c
surely	c
get	c
a	c
substancial	i
amount	c
of	c
money	c
.	c

We	c
had	c
the	c
opportunity	c
to	c
read	c
your	c
programme	c
and	c
we	c
are	c
happy	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
very	c
good	i
organized	c
.	c

We	c
are	c
young	c
and	c
we	c
all	i
are	i
interested	c
in	c
fashion	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
your	c
programme	c
,	c
it	i
's	i
sounds	c
very	c
interesting	c
and	c
everybody	c
is	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
it	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

Just	c
then	c
,	c
the	c
strange	c
man	c
took	c
out	c
his	c
gun	c
.	c

One	c
day	c
,	c
when	c
they	c
were	c
arguing	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
very	c
anxious	i
and	c
told	c
what	c
she	c
knew	c
to	c
police	i
.	c

It	c
is	c
excellent	c
to	c
have	c
won	c
this	c
prize	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
for	c
money	c
and	c
clothes	c
because	c
my	c
parents	c
are	c
travelling	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
impossible	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
have	i
money	i
because	c
my	c
sister	c
does	c
n't	c
want	c
me	c
to	c
go	c
because	c
I	c
'm	c
only	c
14	c
,	c
but	c
when	c
I	c
get	c
there	c
I	c
promise	c
to	c
return	c
you	i
all	c
the	c
money	c
because	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
cash	i
at	i
this	i
moment	i
.	c

Bye	c
and	c
think	c
on	i
this	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
inform	c
some	i
further	c
information	c
as	i
follow	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
also	c
interested	c
in	c
swimming	c
and	c
sailing	c
,	i
I	c
am	i
always	c
go	c
to	c
swimming	i
pool	c
when	c
I	c
have	c
time	c
,	i
our	i
family	c
used	c
to	c
live	c
near	c
the	c
sea	i
side	i
,	i
we	i
would	c
go	c
sailing	c
on	c
the	c
weekend	c
and	c
I	c
miss	c
it	c
very	c
much	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

I	c
read	c
your	c
advertissement	i
five	c
days	c
before	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
realy	i
impressed	c
by	c
it	c
.	c

But	c
,	c
the	c
quality	c
of	c
this	c
show	c
was	c
n't	c
what	c
you	c
let	i
understand	i
,	c
an	i
I	c
feel	c
realy	i
disappointed	c
by	c
it	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
hoped	i
that	c
I	c
could	c
have	c
a	i
diner	i
in	c
the	c
restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
but	c
,	c
to	c
make	c
my	i
totally	c
disappointed	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
find	c
another	c
restaurant	c
at	c
22.00	c
.	c

I	c
never	c
talked	c
about	c
this	c
project	c
to	c
anyone	c
,	c
exept	i
my	c
best	c
friend	c
Pat	c
.	c

During	c
this	c
party	c
,	c
Pat	c
drank	c
too	c
much	c
.	c

Then	c
,	c
the	c
teachers	c
made	c
copies	c
of	c
their	c
file	i
,	c
and	c
my	c
project	c
was	c
n't	c
possible	c
anymore	c
.	c

My	c
name	c
is	c
Marie	c
Bouchard	c
,	c
I	c
come	c
from	c
Switzerland	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
we	c
got	c
our	c
tickets	c
in	i
your	c
ticket	c
office	c
just	c
one	c
hour	c
before	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
we	c
are	c
not	c
the	c
only	c
people	c
to	c
be	c
so	c
upset	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
the	c
first	c
and	c
the	c
last	c
time	c
that	c
I	c
came	i
in	i
your	c
theatre	c
.	c

There	c
is	c
just	c
one	c
thing	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
;	i
Janine	c
and	c
Richey	c
have	c
seen	c
an	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
show	c
and	c
we	c
all	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
dangerous	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
knew	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
went	c
out	c
of	c
the	c
room	c
,	c
ran	c
as	c
much	i
as	c
I	c
could	c
and	c
started	c
thinking	c
what	i
this	c
man	c
was	c
doing	c
here	c
and	c
who	c
he	c
was	c
.	c

My	c
sister	c
was	c
standing	c
,	c
crying	c
and	c
showing	i
the	c
front	c
door	c
.	c

I	c
write	i
a	i
letter	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
your	c
advertisement	c
about	i
the	c
musical	c
show	c
"	c
over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
"	c
,	c
wich	i
is	c
misleading	c
in	c
a	c
number	c
of	c
way	i
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
and	c
the	c
rumours	c
describing	i
me	c
stealing	c
soon	c
reached	c
the	c
director	c
's	c
office	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
unable	c
to	c
image	i
what	c
would	c
happen	c
to	c
me	c
if	c
my	c
parents	c
knew	c
what	c
I	c
had	c
stolen	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
suprised	i
that	c
my	c
father	c
did	c
n't	c
watch	c
me	c
but	c
I	c
soon	c
understood	c
that	c
he	c
was	c
ignoring	c
me	c
.	c

Mother	c
,	c
on	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
looked	c
at	c
me	c
and	c
seemed	c
both	c
disappointed	c
and	c
betrayed	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
when	c
the	c
show	c
finished	c
,	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
visit	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
for	c
repairs	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs.	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
in	c
response	c
to	c
your	c
letter	c
which	c
I	c
received	c
two	c
days	c
go	c
and	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
answer	c
all	c
questions	c
I	c
was	c
asked	c
to	i
.	c

There	c
was	i
about	c
100	c
000	c
people	c
.	c

Acctually	i
,	c
they	c
put	c
me	c
very	c
close	c
to	c
the	c
stage	c
,	c
in	c
the	c
middle	c
of	c
the	c
real	c
hell	c
.	c

The	c
biggest	c
problem	c
was	c
connected	c
with	c
some	c
foreigners	c
who	c
could	c
n't	c
speak	c
Polish	c
or	c
English	c
and	c
we	c
did	c
n't	c
know	c
how	c
to	c
help	c
them	c
.	c

You	c
should	c
also	c
try	c
.	i

At	c
first	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
a	c
problem	c
because	c
if	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
the	c
best	c
it	i
would	c
cost	i
what	c
they	c
said	i
.	c

Since	c
the	c
creation	c
of	c
PCs	c
,	c
people	c
-	c
and	c
me	c
too	c
,	c
of	c
course	c
-	c
are	i
making	i
different	c
things	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
we	c
can	c
buy	c
food	c
,	c
clothes	c
and	c
whatever	c
we	c
need	c
by	c
internet	i
or	c
by	c
telephone	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
how	c
to	c
use	c
them	c
but	c
I	c
know	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
change	c
because	c
they	c
help	c
us	i
to	c
make	c
our	c
lives	c
easier	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

That	c
evening	c
was	c
n't	c
my	c
perfect	c
one	c
out	i
,	c
although	c
it	c
was	c
promised	c
to	c
be	c
so	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
.	c

This	c
is	c
the	c
main	c
reasone	i
,	i
why	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
ask	c
for	c
a	c
refund	c
.	c

During	i
the	c
centuries	c
man	c
's	c
clothes	c
has	i
been	c
changing	c
and	c
even	c
developing	c
in	c
some	c
way	i
.	c

That	c
's	c
why	c
I	c
suppose	c
,	i
that	c
man	c
's	c
clothes	c
will	c
be	c
becoming	c
more	i
and	i
more	i
light	i
.	c

I	c
think	c
,	c
that	c
different	c
tops	c
and	c
mini-skirts	c
will	c
become	c
more	c
popular	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
two	c
questions	c
more	c
:	c
I	c
wonder	c
if	c
I	c
can	c
change	c
my	c
french	i
money	c
in	c
the	c
Camp	i
and	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
buy	c
before	c
coming	c
?	c

Consequently	c
,	c
I	c
hope	c
I	c
will	c
play	c
an	c
instrument	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
,	c
especially	c
because	c
the	c
group	c
promises	c
me	i
to	c
help	c
me	c
to	c
learn	c
any	c
instrument	c
.	c

I	c
apologise	c
any	i
inconvenience	c
that	c
this	c
cause	i
you	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
,	c

HERE	c
ARE	i
THE	c
INFORMATION	c
YOU	c
ASKED	c
FOR	c
:	c

IT	c
IS	c
ONLY	c
POSSIBLE	c
FOR	c
ME	c
TO	c
TRAVEL	c
IN	c
JULY	c
BECAUSE	c
OF	c
MY	c
UNREGULAR	i
WORK	c
.	c

IN	i
JULY	i
WE	i
HAVE	i
GOT	i
LOW	c
SEASON	c
AND	c
IT	c
WILL	c
BE	c
EASIER	c
TO	c
GO	c
THEN	i
ON	i
HOLLYDAY	i
.	c

WE	c
WERE	c
A	c
GROUPE	i
!	c

ONE	c
TEAM	c
!	c

I	c
WAS	c
HAPPY	c
THAT	c
THERE	c
WAS	c
NO	c
DANGER	c
FOR	c
THE	c
PEOPLE	c
DURING	c
THE	c
CONCERT	c
.	c

Estelle	c

It	c
was	c
advertised	c
as	c
London	c
's	c
Newest	c
and	c
best	c
musical	c
show	c
.	c

This	c
really	c
upset	c
me	c
as	c
no	c
notice	c
were	i
given	c
before	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

Cook	c
Phatosub	c
.	c

We	c
would	c
n't	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
sort	i
out	i
informations	i
and	c
datas	i
this	i
quickly	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

I	c
stood	c
against	c
the	c
window	c
and	c
I	c
started	c
to	c
listen	c
.	c

Suddenly	c
someone	c
broke	c
my	c
window	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
just	c
coming	c
back	c
from	c
a	c
week	c
's	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
,	c
which	c
has	c
been	c
all	c
in	c
all	c
really	c
nice	c
.	c

Also	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
your	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
their	i
was	i
n't	i
enough	c
staff	c
.	c

Then	c
we	c
can	c
just	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
fridge	c
where	c
all	c
the	c
fresh	c
food	c
is	c
stored	c
ready	c
to	c
eat	c
.	c

Of	c
course	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
my	c
fault	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
made	c
a	c
mistake	c
and	c
I	c
told	c
her	c
.	c

I	c
immediately	c
knew	c
that	c
something	c
was	c
wrong	c
so	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
word	c
with	c
Pat	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
only	c
a	c
question	c
of	c
hours	c
before	c
my	c
life	c
would	c
collapse	c
.	c

His	c
father	c
was	c
a	c
shelter	i
,	c
He	i
had	c
one	c
hundred	c
sheeps	i
and	c
one	c
dog	c
,	c
and	c
he	c
used	c
to	c
take	c
the	c
animals	c
to	c
the	c
mountain	c
to	c
feed	c
them	c
.	c

At	c
the	c
beginning	c
he	c
was	c
excited	c
but	c
soon	c
he	c
got	c
bored	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
is	i
that	i
some	c
concert	c
halls	c
were	c
definitely	c
to	i
small	c
or	c
in	c
other	c
words	c
to	i
many	c
people	c
attended	c
those	c
concerts	c
.	c

Another	c
point	c
where	c
you	c
could	c
improve	c
is	c
when	i
you	c
show	c
more	c
plays	c
and	c
films	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

My	c
other	c
choise	i
is	c
painting	c
,	i
I	c
paint	i
since	c
I	c
was	c
ten	c
years	c
old	c
,	i
I	c
used	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
special	c
classes	c
and	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
mind	c
if	c
you	c
need	c
me	c
to	c
help	c
in	c
the	c
class	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
thing	i
that	c
I	i
'll	i
enjoy	c
it	c
,	c
all	c
the	c
people	c
knicking	i
you	c
,	c
you	c
ca	c
n't	c
walk	c
properly	c
or	c
buy	c
something	i
,	i
and	i
also	c
there	c
are	c
lot	i
of	c
cases	c
which	c
show	c
how	c
people	c
can	c
be	c
in	c
shops	c
,	i
I	c
mean	c
that	c
some	c
people	c
can	c
fight	c
to	c
get	c
something	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

Are	i
you	i
thinking	i
?	c

Finally	i
these	i
people	c
are	c
like	c
us	c
,	c
they	c
have	i
just	i
a	c
special	c
job	c
with	c
special	i
times	i
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
travel	c
only	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
I	c
go	c
to	c
univercity	i
and	c
I	c
normaly	i
spend	c
the	i
most	c
of	c
time	i
for	i
work	i
.	c

When	c
I	c
go	c
to	i
camp	i
,	c
I	c
stay	c
in	c
a	i
log	c
cabins	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
so	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
try	c
different	i
way	c
to	c
stay	i
,	c
this	c
time	c
.	c

And	c
I	c
choose	c
phtograghy	i
and	c
tennis	c
from	c
the	c
activities	c
list	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
lovely	c
letter	c
and	c
I	c
hope	c
you	c
are	c
well	c
.	c

Someone	c
says	c
it	c
is	c
maths	c
,	i
pratical	i
,	c
usefull	i
but	i
the	c
majority	c
says	i
it	c
is	c
boring	c
,	c
unless	c
you	c
're	c
chose	i
a	c
job	c
which	c
charges	i
all	c
your	c
math	i
's	i
knowledge	c
as	i
accounting	c
,	c
otherwise	c
you	c
can	c
use	c
a	c
calculator	c
or	c
a	c
computer	c
.	c

I	c
insist	c
you	c
should	i
refund	c
all	c
the	c
money	c
that	c
I	c
wasted	c
in	c
your	c
theatre	c
.	c

While	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
your	c
theatre	c
to	c
see	c
"	c
Over	c
The	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
very	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
.	c

Dear	c
Kim	c

You	c
should	c
come	c
on	i
3	i
pm	i
in	i
college	i
Canteen	i
.	c

Of	c
course	c
all	c
the	c
class	c
will	c
take	c
party	i
to	i
this	c
party	c
.	c

We	c
have	c
thought	c
to	i
buy	i
a	c
cd	i
or	c
a	c
book	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
friends	c
are	c
not	c
suitable	c
to	i
do	i
this	c
.	c

About	i
the	c
acomodation	i
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
instead	c
of	c
a	c
tent	c
so	c
as	c
to	c
get	c
a	c
better	c
rest	c
.	c

Anyway	c
,	c
to	c
participate	c
in	c
two-weeks	c
Camp	i
California	c
in	c
the	c
U.S.A	c
I	c
readily	c
give	c
you	c
my	c
personal	c
details	c
and	c
information	c
.	c

I	c
used	c
to	c
belong	c
to	c
a	c
swimming	c
club	c
and	c
practise	c
swimming	c
a	c
couple	c
of	c
times	c
a	c
week	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
found	c
that	c
hockey	c
is	c
the	c
most	c
popular	c
sport	c
among	c
students	c
.	c

London	c
17	c
June	c
2000	c

The	c
third	c
point	c
was	c
that	c
the	c
discounts	i
tickets	c
were	c
unavailable	c
and	c
finally	i
,	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
the	c
oven	c
was	c
broken	c
and	c
we	c
could	c
n't	c
enjoy	c
there	i
after	c
the	c
musical	c
show	i
.	c

In	c
fact	c
,	c
I	c
expect	c
a	c
full	c
refund	c
plus	c
compensation	c
for	c
the	c
dissatisfaction	i
suffured	i
.	c

What	c
will	c
it	c
be	c
like	c
in	c
2100	c
?	c

Of	c
course	c
,	c
technologies	i
will	c
have	c
developped	i
enough	c
to	i
invent	c
new	c
material	c
for	c
those	c
kind	i
of	c
clothes	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
,	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
you	i
are	c
not	c
very	c
respectful	i
and	c
responsible	c
.	c

We	c
lived	c
in	c
the	c
same	c
street	c
and	c
the	i
weekends	i
we	i
spent	i
together	i
.	c

Finally	c
we	c
had	i
no	i
perfect	i
evening	c
at	c
all	c
!	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

First	c
,	c
Pat	c
started	c
to	c
laugh	c
,	c
but	c
as	c
he	c
realized	c
,	i
that	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
stop	c
crying	c
,	c
he	c
comfort	i
me	c
until	c
I	c
was	i
calming	i
down	c
.	c

And	c
I	c
was	c
really	c
disappointed	c
when	c
I	c
saw	c
Jeremy	c
Brook	c
on	c
the	c
stage	c
.	c

Please	c
,	c
if	c
you	c
would	c
be	c
so	c
kind	c
and	i
mind	i
correct	c
this	c
mistake	c
.	c

Best	c
regardes	i
!	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
,	i
I	c
knew	c
that	c
he	c
's	c
very	i
talkative	c
person	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
nessesery	i
because	c
I	c
wanted	c
him	c
to	c
be	c
the	c
main	c
director	i
of	c
that	c
birthday	c
party	c
for	c
tenes	i
.	c

Towards	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
the	c
concert	c
I	c
hansled	i
a	c
bottle	c
of	c
wine	c
to	c
Poolo	c
Conte	c
.	c

We	c
started	c
talking	c
about	c
music	c
and	c
I	c
asked	c
Him	i
many	c
things	c
about	c
His	i
texts	i
,	c
which	c
are	c
beautiful	c
but	c
sometimes	c
difficult	c
to	c
understand	c
.	c

And	c
about	c
clothes	c
?	c

As	c
far	c
as	c
I	c
am	c
concerned	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
an	i
accomodation	i
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
,	c
but	c
in	c
case	c
there	c
are	c
no	c
cabins	c
left	c
I	c
can	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
tend	i
as	c
well	c
.	c

In	c
this	c
case	c
I	c
would	c
rather	c
do	c
some	c
climbing	c
,	c
which	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
done	c
before	c
.	c

Actualy	i
most	c
people	c
work	c
hard	c
to	c
earn	c
their	c
money	c
and	c
consequently	c
,	c
the	c
occasion	c
in	i
which	c
this	c
money	c
is	c
spent	c
to	c
buy	c
something	c
useful	c
,	c
or	c
simply	c
something	c
they	c
like	c
,	c
should	c
be	c
considered	c
a	c
very	c
pleasant	c
situation	i
.	c

I	i
've	i
seen	i
your	c
festival	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
my	c
suggestions	c
to	i
it	c
.	c

Jazz	c
,	c
rock	c
and	c
classical	c
concerts	c
are	c
amazing	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
some	c
concert	c
halls	c
are	c
too	c
small	c
,	c
so	c
not	c
everybody	c
can	c
come	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
will	c
continue	c
to	i
making	i
your	c
festivals	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
allowed	c
to	c
do	c
many	c
things	c
at	c
home	c
.	c

It	c
could	i
make	i
things	c
worse	c
that	c
the	i
visit	c
to	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
,	c
which	c
had	c
already	c
been	c
closed	c
because	c
of	c
lack	i
of	c
customers	c
,	c
was	c
canceled	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
and	c
your	c
organisation	c
for	c
giving	c
me	c
this	c
opportunity	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
a	i
captain	c
of	c
school	i
's	c
basketball	c
team	c
and	c
we	c
have	c
won	c
many	i
competitions	c
.	c

Remember	c
I	c
have	i
told	i
you	c
that	c
I	c
have	i
been	c
selected	c
to	c
help	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
of	c
a	c
local	c
band	c
?	c

how	c
are	c
you	c
?	c

Well	c
,	c
I	c
hope	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
country	c
there	c
are	c
some	c
rules	c
that	c
are	c
the	c
same	c
in	c
all	c
schools	c
.	c

Write	c
to	c
me	c
soon	c
about	c
news	c
in	c
your	c
life	c
.	c

My	c
holidays	c
will	c
finish	c
in	i
the	c
begining	i
of	c
September	c
and	c
will	i
be	c
good	c
to	c
travel	c
during	c
this	c
time	i
.	c

(	c
August-September	c
)	c
.	c

I	c
usualy	i
sing	c
in	c
my	c
spare	c
time	c
and	c
my	c
friends	c
love	c
when	i
I	c
sing	c
and	c
about	i
swimming	c
I	c
was	c
champion	c
last	c
year	c
in	c
my	c
city	c

Secondly	c
,	c
parts	c
of	c
our	c
life	c
like	i
breaks	c
,	c
lunch	c
time	c
,	c
spending	c
time	c
with	c
friends	c
will	i
be	c
good	c
to	c
make	c
the	c
video	c
interesting	c
.	c

The	c
students	c
in	c
this	c
class	c
have	c
lots	c
of	c
freedom	c
to	c
speak	c
and	c
we	c
can	c
travel	c
around	c
the	c
world	c
in	c
one	c
hour	c
and	c
fifteen	c
minutes	c
.	c

Also	c
the	i
introduction	c
of	c
different	c
cultural	c
experiences	c
is	c
a	c
good	c
idea	c
but	c
six	c
countries	c
ca	c

Dear	c
Kim	c

Hi	c
!	c

Yours	c
sincerelly	i
,	c

When	c
I	c
feel	c
me	i
comfortable	i
for	c
shopping	c
everything	c
will	i
be	i
closed	c
or	c
you	i
have	c
n't	c
enough	c
time	c
to	c
look	c
around	c
.	c

I	c
like	c
shopping	c
at	i
all	i
with	c
my	c
best	c
friend	c
.	c

Your	i
Faithfull	i
,	c

The	c
weather	c
was	c
cold	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
arrived	c
in	c
front	c
of	c
the	c
bank	c
,	c
my	c
heart	c
was	c
going	c
faster	c
.	c

When	c
all	c
the	c
family	c
get	i
up	i
,	c
I	c
told	c
us	i
the	c
true	i
and	c
all	i
promised	c
to	c
say	c
nothing	c
.	c

There	c
is	i
about	c
two	c
thousands	i
students	c
at	c
my	c
school	c
.	c

There	c
are	c
only	c
men	c
.	c

This	c
is	c
very	c
important	c
,	c
becouse	i
every	c
soldier	c
schould	i
be	c
strong	c
.	c

Then	c
you	c
should	c
schow	i
houe	i
ouer	i
school	c
looks	c
from	c
outside	c
.	c

Next	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
instead	c
of	c
19:30	c
.	c

Undoubtfully	i
,	c
modern	c
technology	c
changed	i
my	c
daily	c
life	c
.	c

Among	c
the	c
greatest	c
inventions	c
of	c
man	c
I	c
came	i
accross	i
dayly	i
are	c
telephone	i
,	c
computer	c
and	c
automobile	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
Would	i
you	c
give	c
me	c
an	c
explaination	c
about	c
the	c
London	c
fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
show	c
?	c

They	c
are	c
more	c
comfortable	c
and	c
really	i
match	i
with	i
the	c
enveiroment	i
.	c

In	c
addition	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
appreciate	c
if	i
you	c
let	c
me	c
know	c
what	c
is	c
the	c
kind	c
of	c
clothing	c
required	c
for	c
the	c
Camp	c
;	c
if	i
I	c
need	c
some	c
money	c
there	c
and	c
for	c
what	c
;	c
and	c
finally	c
if	i
the	c
prize	c
is	c
just	c
for	c
me	c
or	c
if	c
I	c
can	c
go	c
with	c
somebody	c
else	c
.	c

I	c
also	c
choose	c
the	i
Golf	i
I	i
have	c
never	c
played	i
this	c
sport	c
but	c
I	c
am	c
sure	c
I	c
will	c
enjoy	c
it	c
.	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
suggest	c
to	i
film	i
our	c
library	c
because	i
it	c
is	c
a	c
pleasant	c
place	c
that	c
students	c
really	c
like	c
and	i
the	c
English	c
course	i
which	i
will	c
help	c
foreign	c
students	c
for	i
their	c
future	c
choice	i

I	c
've	c
red	i
that	c
I	c
will	c
have	c
a	c
chance	c
to	c
do	c
two	c
extra	c
activities	c
while	c
I	c
will	i
be	i
at	c
Camp	c
.	c

In	i
that	i
occasion	i
I	c
had	c
n't	c
the	c
opportunity	c
for	i
giving	i
my	c
opinion	c
about	i
this	c
task	c
.	c

You	c
can	c
chose	i
the	c
price	c
more	i
suitable	i
for	c
you	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
you	c
this	c
letter	c
because	c
yesterday	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
musical	c
show	i
and	c
I	c
had	c
many	c
problems	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
demand	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

Manager	c
I	i
spect	i
that	c
you	c
considered	i
my	c
bad	c
experience	c
in	i
your	c
theatre	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
'm	c
asking	c
you	c
for	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
,	c
because	c
,	i
it	c
was	c
a	c
very	c
bad	c
evening	c
.	c

Pat	c
affected	i
with	i
this	c
situation	c
told	i
Nick	c
all	c
the	i
situation	c
and	c
the	c
secret	i
of	i
the	i
class	i
.	c

Believe	c
me	c
,	c
shopping	c
can	c
also	c
be	c
painful	c
.	c

In	c
spite	c
of	c
our	c
decadence	c
,	c
some	c
cheap	c
souls	c
still	c
have	c
the	c
courage	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
,	c
by	c
shopping	c
,	c
they	c
're	c
filling	c
their	c
empty	c
spaces	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
answer	c
the	c
questions	c
you	c
asked	c
me	c
in	c
the	c
last	c
letter	c
you	c
sent	c
me	c
.	c

That	c
was	c
n't	c
difficult	c
because	c
everybody	c
wanted	c
to	c
go	c
.	c

Eleonora	c
Jimenez	c

I	c
'm	c
not	c
looking	i
foward	i
to	c

I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
have	c
more	c
tests	c
during	c
the	c
whole	c
study	i
,	c
not	c
only	c
at	c
the	c
end	c
,	c
because	c
it	i
causes	i
that	i
I	i
'm	i
getting	i
very	c
lasy	i
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
the	c
advertisement	c
of	i
the	c
show	c
said	c
that	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
was	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
on	c
stage	c
.	c

Besides	i
,	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
had	c
closed	c
down	c
before	c
I	c
went	i
out	i
of	i
the	c
show	c
.	c

Both	c
Pat	c
and	c
Tim	c
were	c
very	c
disappointed	c
that	c
day	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c

Although	c
how	i
I	c
enjoyed	c
it	c
,	c
there	c
were	c
still	c
something	i
needed	i
to	c
be	c
improved	c
.	c

Comparing	i
to	c
my	c
experience	c
,	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
give	c
them	c
more	i
open	c
attitude	c
about	c
everything	c
.	c

Best	c
wishes	c

I	c
have	i
spent	i
my	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
recently	c
and	c
it	i
is	c
like	c
a	c
tradition	c
,	c
we	c
went	c
to	c
a	c
musical	c
.	c

But	c
firstly	c
when	c
we	c
bought	c
our	c
tickets	c
,	c
we	c
did	c
n't	c
get	c
any	c
discount	c
,	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
pay	c
the	c
full	c
price	c
.	c

We	c
sometimes	c
tried	c
to	c
make	i
surprise	c
parties	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
never	c
worked	c
because	c
of	c
him	c
.	c

We	c
told	c
Pat	c
we	c
could	c
n't	c
have	c
a	c
party	c
on	c
his	c
birthday	c
,	c
because	c
everyone	c
except	c
me	c
had	c
something	c
to	c
do	c
.	c

First	c
I	c
am	c
good	c
enough	c
at	c
both	c
of	c
them	c
.	c

Another	c
thing	c
I	c
am	c
interested	c
in	c
is	c
general	c
information	c
of	i
prices	c
in	c
the	c
USA	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
glad	c
to	c
hear	c
that	c
and	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
all	c
the	c
informations	i
you	c
need	c
to	c
know	c
from	c
me	c
.	c

Also	c
we	c
are	c
going	c
to	i
a	c
ferry	i
trip	i
with	c
my	c
relatives	c
.	c

I	c
really	c
wish	c
you	c
were	i
with	c
me	c
last	c
month	c
.	c

I	c
felt	c
like	c
I	i
'm	i
one	c
of	c
those	c
professional	i
too	c
because	c
they	c
always	c
called	c
me	c
and	c
my	c
friend	c
to	c
help	c
them	c
and	c
that	c
made	c
me	c
learn	c
lots	c
of	c
thing	i
from	c
doing	c
the	c
practical	c
work	c
.	c

At	i
the	i
end	i
of	i
the	i
day	i
,	c
my	c
ambition	c
is	c
to	c
be	c
like	c
one	c
of	c
the	i
professionals	c
.	c

I	c
will	c
write	c
to	c
you	c
again	c
soon	c
and	c
tell	c
you	c
how	c
I	c
getting	i
on	c
.	c

What	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
do	c
was	c
getting	i
into	c
the	c
house	c
by	c
climbing	c
up	i
the	c
roof	c
because	c
I	c
knew	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
windows	c
was	c
unlocked	c
.	c

16.12.00	c

For	c
example	c
if	i
you	c
do	c
n't	c
come	c
to	c
school	c
10	i
days	c
in	c
a	c
year	c
we	i
fail	c
that	c
year	c
.	c

My	c
family	c
allows	c
me	c
almost	c
every	i
thing	i
except	c
smoking	c
and	c
drinking	c
alchol	i
of	c
course	c
,	c
which	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
do	c
anyway	c
.	c

So	c
just	c
do	c
n't	c
think	c
about	c
them	c
.	c

At	c

I	c
would	c

to	c

how	c

ussually	i
take	c
and	c
how	c

Additionally	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
instead	c
of	c
19:30	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
pay	c
the	c
full	c
price	c
for	c
my	c
ticket	c
as	c
no	c
discount	c
was	c
available	c

This	c
latter	i
is	c
a	c
new	c
media	i
which	c
has	c
changed	c
my	c
life	c
,	c
as	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
marvellous	c
tool	c
to	i
communicate	i

At	c

Regarding	c
starting	c
time	c
and	c
the	c
theatre	c

,	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
musical	c
I	c
had	c

July	c

After	c
the	c
discussion	c
that	c
we	c
had	c
in	c
the	c
english	i
class	c
,	c
I	c
understood	c
that	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
people	c
sometimes	c
do	c
n't	c
enjoy	c
during	i
the	i
shopping	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
the	c
first	c
time	c
I	c
went	i
and	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
pleased	c
to	c
go	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
such	c
a	c
good	i
success	c
that	c
some	c
people	c
were	c
n't	c
able	c
to	c
have	i
tickets	c
!	c

Perhaps	c
,	i
you	c
could	c
possibly	c
meet	i
some	c
producers	c
,	i
who	c
come	c
from	c
others	i
countries	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
show	c
different	c
cultures	c
.	c

What	c
's	c
more	c
,	c
you	c
had	c
better	c
have	i
done	i
them	i
if	i
you	c
would	i
have	i
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
blackboard	c
!	c

I	c
am	c
sometimes	c
allowed	c
to	c
watch	c
the	c
television	c
when	c
I	c
have	c
finished	c
my	c
homeworks	i
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
really	c
want	c
to	c
change	c
that	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
just	i
like	c
this	c
.	c

At	c
home	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
a	c
video	c
game	c
so	c
I	c
play	c
it	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
and	c
I	c
'm	c
very	c
enjoy	i
that	c
make	i
my	c
daily	c
life	c
happy	c
so	c
it	c
's	c
excellent	c
but	c
on	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
I	c
did	i
n't	i
do	c
any	c
homework	c
or	c
study	c
at	c
all	c
.	c

That	i
is	c
really	c
intresting	i
.	c

This	c
is	c
the	c
reason	c
that	c
I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
.	c

I	c
guess	c
there	c
will	c
be	c
more	c
gadget	i
to	c
do	i
some	i
housework	c
easier	c
.	c

We	c
can	c
get	c
everything	c
we	c
want	c
to	c
know	c
from	c
computers	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
believe	c
human	i
will	c
never	c
forget	c
what	c
they	c
used	c
to	c
be	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
just	c
an	c
imagination	i
.	c

Like	c
everything	c
our	c
homes	c
will	c
change	c
as	c
well	c
.	c

I	c
send	i
you	c
some	c
pictures	c
,	c
the	c
best	c
ones	c
because	i
there	c
were	c
some	c
quite	c
embarrasing	i
.	i

As	c
you	c
offered	c
me	c
two	c
activities	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
on	i
swimming	c

I	c
thank	c
you	c
again	c
for	c
your	c
assistance	c
and	c
am	c
looking	c
forwards	c
to	c

Another	c
disappointing	c
thing	c
was	c
that	c

not	c

reason	c
why	c
it	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
pleased	c
to	c

that	c
I	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
the	c

And	c
also	c
the	c
reason	c
why	c
I	c
would	c

to	c
go	c

is	c
that	c
I	c
am	c
always	c

I	c

In	c
response	c
to	c
your	c
question	c
and	c
if	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
mind	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
I	c
've	c
already	c
chosen	i
my	c
holiday	c
and	c
my	c
boss	c
wo	c
n't	c
give	c
me	c
another	c
one	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
asked	c
me	c
,	c
my	c
favourite	c
activities	c
would	c
be	c
painting	c
and	c
climbing	c
.	c

I	c
like	c
very	i
much	i
the	i
moutains	i
and	c
would	c
particularly	c
enjoy	c
painting	c
them	c
after	c
a	c
walk	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
organising	c
the	c
programme	c
of	c
our	c
three	i
days	i
visit	c
to	c
London	c
.	c

We	c
would	c
suggest	c
to	i
replace	i
the	c
shopping	c
part	i
on	c
Tuesday	c
afternoon	c
by	i
the	c
visit	c
of	i
the	c
show	c
.	c

It	c
will	c
be	c
possible	c
to	c
connect	c
to	c
the	c
Internet	c
from	c
nearly	c
everywhere	c
in	c
the	c
house	c
or	c
flat	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
sure	c
all	c
the	c
things	c
which	c
are	c
based	c
on	c
electronic	c
parts	c
will	c
totally	c
change	c
.	c

How	c
are	c
you	c
my	c
lovely	c
penfriend	c
?	c

I	i
hope	i
good	i
.	c

So	c
let	c
's	c
answer	c
the	c
question	c
you	c
told	i
me	c
to	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
make	c
that	i
two	c
weeks	c
there	c
as	c
funnier	i
as	c
possible	c
.	c

If	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
choose	c
two	c
of	c
them	c
I	c
'll	c
take	c
tennis	c
first	c
.	c

Well	c
,	c
some	c
others	c
helped	c
me	c
in	i
the	c
task	c
,	c
but	c
that	c
did	c
not	c
make	c
it	c
much	c
easier	c
.	c

The	c
part	c
I	c
enjoyed	c
most	c
was	c
the	c
one	c
when	c
they	c
paid	c
me	c
.	c

They	c
also	c
gave	c
me	c
a	c
ticket	c
to	c
wotch	i
the	c
concert	c
live	c
.	c

You	c
offer	c
a	c
great	c
veriety	i
of	c
activities	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
qustions	i
to	i
.	c

If	c
you	c
had	c
wanted	c
something	c
special	c
for	c
example	c
for	c
a	c
gift	c
you	c
had	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
line	c
all	c
night	c
.	c

They	c
are	c
imported	c
from	c
enother	i
Western	c
Europe	i
country	c

Santigo	c
,	c
June	c
17th	c
,	c
2000	c

It	c
is	c
for	c
these	c
reasons	c
that	c
I	c
expect	c
a	c
full	c
refund	c
of	c
the	c
ticket	c
prize	i
,	i
it	i
is	c
my	c
right	c
as	c
a	c
paying	c
customer	c
to	c
get	c
what	c
I	c
have	c
paid	c
for	c
.	c

At	c
the	c
Camp	i
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
sailing	c
a	c
lot	c
.	c

According	c
to	c
the	c
advertisement	c
,	c
the	i
discounts	c
were	i
available	c
.	c

If	c
all	c
of	c
us	c
try	c
to	c
help	c
her	c
,	c
I	c
'm	c
sure	c
that	c
we	c
can	c
make	i
her	i
a	i
better	i
school	i
life	i
.	c

And	c
know	i
the	i
different	c
prices	c
for	c
the	c

Dear	c

Introduction	c

Interestingly	c
,	c
over	c
half	c
of	c
the	c
students	c
who	c
were	c
asked	c
enjoy	c
attending	c
history	c
class	c
,	c
while	c
30	c
per	c
cent	c
are	c
keen	c
to	c
take	c
an	c
art	c
and	c
music	c
class	c
,	c
and	c
a	c
small	c
number	c
of	c
the	c
student	c
(	c
less	c
than	c
15	c
per	c
cent	c
)	c
like	c
to	c
take	c
social	c
studies	c
class	c
.	c

Not	c
surprisingly	c
,	c
football	c
was	c
well-preferred	c
as	c
an	c
activity	c
which	c
students	c
do	c
after	c
school	c
generally	c
(	c
over	c
30	c
per	c
cent	c
)	c
and	c
also	c
about	c
25	c
per	c
cent	c
preferred	c
baseball	c
.	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
it	c
seems	c
that	c
there	c
are	c
so	c
many	c
interesting	c
lessons	c
and	c
activities	c
at	c
our	c
school	c
,	c

The	c
latest	c
fashions	c
,	c
leisure	c
and	c
sports	c
wear	c
,	c
make	i
up	i
and	c
hairstyles	c
will	c
be	c
shown	c
in	i
this	c
occasion	c
.	c

Owing	c
toe	i
the	c
summer	c
course	c
I	c
take	c
starting	c
in	c
August	c
,	c
July	c
is	c
the	c
only	c
month	c
I	c
have	c
free	c
time	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
if	c
you	c
want	c
to	c
buy	c
nice	c
dresses	c
,	c
the	c
first	c
thing	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
do	c
is	c
looking	i
around	c
all	c
shops	i
and	c
department	c
stores	c
in	c
a	c
city	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
tennis	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
profeshional	i
tennis	c
player	c
.	c

I	c
won	c
the	c
U.S.	c
Open	c
and	c
the	c
French	c
open	c
in	c
1986	c
and	c
1988	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
again	c
for	c
the	c
prize	c
that	c
you	c
give	i
me	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
very	c
interesting	c
and	c
fun	c
with	i
the	i
experement	i
.	c

I	c
was	c
also	c
wondering	c
if	c
I	c
will	c
need	c
any	c
money	c
.	c

I	c
know	c
how	c
impatient	c
you	c
are	c
about	i
it	c
and	c
I	c
just	c
want	c
to	c
let	c
you	c
know	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
something	i
amazing	c
!	c

There	c
was	c
a	c
large	c
stage	c
which	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
clean	i
by	i
sweeping	i
.	c

I	c
've	c
read	c
your	c
advertisment	i
and	c
in	i
reality	c
to	i
what	i
was	i
written	i
there	i
was	i
different	i
.	c

There	c
was	c
no	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
but	c
instead	c
of	c
him	c
was	i
a	c
different	c
actor	c
and	c
I	c
'm	c
very	c
dissapointed	i
about	c
it	i
because	c
I	c
'm	c
his	i
fan	i
.	c

The	c
theater	i
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
for	c
no	c
reason	c
availble	i
to	c
me	c
.	c

Vaisili	c
Solatov	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
for	c
me	c
Pat	c
at	c
the	c
time	c
went	i
to	c
toilet	i
and	c
saw	c
me	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
asked	c
him	c
to	c
keep	c
it	c
in	i
secret	c
.	c

For	c
that	c
reason	c
,	c
I	c
suggest	c
that	c
you	c
could	c
change	c
the	c
activities	c
.	c

your	i
sincerely	c
,	c

Instead	c
of	c
Wednesday	i
's	i
afternoon	i
free	c
time	c
we	c
could	c
visit	c
the	c
Science	c
Museum	c
.	c

What	c
does	c
it	c
means	c
?	c

We	c
intrsted	i
in	c
politicians	i
's	i
and	c
film	c
stars	i
's	i
wear	i
,	c
hobbys	i
,	c
passions	c
and	c
the	i
intrigues	c
.	c

Why	c
everybody	i
must	i
know	c
and	c
tolk	i
about	c
their	c
private	c
life	c
?	c

They	c
live	c
as	i
us	c
,	c
they	c
brief	i
and	c
eat	c
as	i
us	c
,	c
they	c
even	c
following	i
in	c
love	c
as	i
us	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
,	i
they	c
must	i
have	c
a	c
normal	c
,	i
private	c
life	c
without	c
journalists	c
following	c
them	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
and	c
without	c
any	c
exact	i
details	c
about	c
them	c
in	i
the	c
different	c
newspaper	i
's	i
curiouses	i
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
known	c
that	c
but	c
I	c
told	i
my	i
secret	i
to	i
her	i
,	c
which	c
was	c
a	c
big	c
mistake	c
.	c

To	c
make	c
the	c
evening	c
worse	c
the	i
tickets	i
were	i
not	i
discounts	i
available	i
,	c
and	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
so	c
late	c
when	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
over	c
.	c

The	c
only	c
problem	c
was	c
that	c
the	c
girl	c
was	c
to	i
shy	c
to	c
speak	c
to	c
him	c
,	c
she	c
wanted	c
to	c
keep	c
her	c
name	c
in	i
secret	c
,	c
and	c
if	c
Pat	c
tells	i
someone	c
something	c
about	c
the	c
letter	c
,	c
she	c
wo	i
n't	i
say	c
who	c
is	i
.	c

How	c
could	c
you	c
change	c
the	c
actors	c
without	c
saying	c
something	c
to	c
the	c
visitors	i
.	c

The	c
show	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
start	c
at	c
half	c
past	c
seven	c
and	c
started	c
a	i
quarter	c
past	c
eight	c
.	c

I	c
understand	i
who	c
told	i
my	c
secret	c
to	c
everyone	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
rather	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
than	c
a	c
tent	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
been	c
swimming	c
from	i
my	i
five	i
years	c
of	c
age	c
until	i
1993	c
as	i
a	c
member	c
of	c
school	i
team	c
.	c

Is	c
everything	c
free	c
?	c

Do	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
bring	c
money	c
for	c
anything	c
extra	c
?	c
but	i
also	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
learn	i
about	c
clothes	c
.	c

Will	c
you	c
provide	c
it	i
?	c
and	i
Do	i
I	c
have	c
to	c
pay	c
for	c
clothes	c
?	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c

SHOPPING	c
-	c

Having	c
decided	c
to	c
take	c
a	c
month	c
off	c
between	c
University	i
and	c
course	i
it	i
would	c
be	c
great	c
to	c
have	c
my	c
holidays	c
from	c
1st	c
to	c
15th	c
July	c
.	c

Besides	i
I	c
've	c
chosen	c
two	c
activities	c
from	c
the	c
list	c
:	c
Tennis	i
as	i
I	c
practice	i
this	c
sport	c
regularly	c
and	c
I	c
'm	c
very	c
good	c
in	i
this	c
activity	c
and	i
Golf	i
because	c
I	c
ignore	i
all	i
about	c
this	c
sport	c
and	c
I	c
wish	c
I	i
will	i
discover	i
it	c
thanks	i
to	i
you	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
travel	i
in	c
July	c
,	c
because	c
at	i
that	i
moment	i
,	i
is	i
stay	i
my	i
summer	i
holiday	i
,	c
so	c
I	c
had	i
more	c
freedom	i
time	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
live	i
in	c
tents	c
more	c
than	c
log	c
cabin	i
,	c
because	c
when	c
we	c
live	i
in	c
a	c
tent	c
,	i
usually	i
we	i
are	i
in	c
the	c
countryside	c
.	c

Do	c
you	c
mind	c
tell	i
me	c
what	c
is	i
the	i
weather	i
,	i
when	c
I	c
during	i
the	i
holiday	c
,	c
what	c
kind	c
the	i
money	c
I	c
should	c
bring	c
with	c
me	c
and	c
what	c
language	c
I	c
should	c
know	i
in	i
there	c
?	c

Unable	c
to	c
keep	c
a	c
secret	c
he	c
told	c
for	i
everyone	c
,	c
ended	c
his	c
friendship	c
with	c
Ted	c
,	i
now	i
Ted	c
is	c
rejective	i
for	i
everyone	c
,	c
no	c
one	c
talks	c
to	c
him	c
and	c
Pat	c
is	c
the	c
example	c
,	c
but	c
without	c
his	c
best	c
friend	c
and	c
his	c
honestity	i
.	c

The	c
other	c
lesson	c
that	c
I	c
think	c
is	c
very	c
important	c
is	c
physics	c
because	i
of	i
the	c
same	c
reason	c
as	i
maths	i
.	c

In	c
my	c
oppinion	i
you	c
have	c
to	c
give	c
some	c
money	c
back	c
to	c
me	c
.	c

Because	c
of	c
the	i
modern	c
technology	c
,	c
the	c
safety	c
level	c
in	i
my	c
car	c
is	c
very	c
high	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
the	c
only	c
time	c
of	c
the	c
year	c
I	c
have	c
two	c
weeks	i
holiday	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
watch	c
every	c
tournament	c
on	c
television	c
.	c

I	c
like	c
this	c
sport	c
very	c
much	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
always	c
the	c
same	c
.	c

Shopping	c
is	c
annoying	c
but	c
also	c
necessary	c
,	i
it	i
is	c
why	c
it	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

That	c
evening	c
was	c
n't	c
my	i
perfect	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
I	c
want	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
because	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
a	c
disaster	c
.	c

The	c
secret	c
was	c
about	c
our	c
friend	c
Maria	c
who	c
was	c
very	c
kind	c
with	i
everyone	c
I	i
told	c
her	c
that	c
I	c
have	i
heard	i
that	c
Maria	c
had	c
concern	i
.	c

Also	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
about	c
money	c
.	c

We	c
practice	i
our	c
English	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
we	c
have	c
to	c
film	c
our	c
English	c
lessons	c
,	c
so	c
others	c
can	c
see	c
that	c
to	c
study	c
this	c
way	c
is	c
better	c
than	c
to	c
study	c
the	c
way	c
how	i
they	c
do	c
.	c

Many	c
people	c
do	c
n't	c
like	c
Math	i
because	c
they	c
think	c
that	c
it	c
's	c
boreing	i
subject	c
.	c

teacher	c
knows	c
how	c
to	c
teach	c
so	c
we	c
do	c
n't	c
get	c
tired	c
of	c
his	c
lessons	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
to	c
pay	c
the	c
full	c
prize	i
for	c
them	c
,	c
which	c
was	c
quite	c
expencive	i
.	c

My	c
second	c
chose	i
is	c
painting	c
because	c
I	c
love	c
water	i
colour	i
painting	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
member	c
of	c
the	c
our	i
water	i
colour	i
painting	c
club	c
in	c
my	c
town	c
.	c

But	c
when	c
we	c
thing	i
properly	i
shopping	i
is	c
not	c
enjoyable	c
for	i
example	c
if	i
you	c
forget	c
something	c
that	c
need	i
for	c
salat	i
.	c

At	i
it	i
shows	c
shopping	i
is	i
become	c
our	i
dislikes	c
,	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
huge	c
supermarkets	c
.	c

I	i
was	c
wonderful	c
news	c
and	c
as	c
you	c
have	c
requested	c

here	c
is	c
some	c
further	c
information	c
and	c
details	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
as	c
it	c
is	c
my	c
summer	c
holiday	c
and	c
is	c
the	c
most	c
convenient	c
time	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

As	c
I	c
had	c
nothing	c
better	c
to	c
do	c
,	c
I	c
tried	c
it	c
on	c
.	c

I	c
said	i
she	i
looked	c
as	c
if	c
she	c
did	c
n't	c
want	c
to	c
talk	c
to	c
me	c
.	c

Sometimes	c
I	c
even	c
do	i
some	c
games	c
with	i
it	c
.	c

In	i
accordance	i
with	i
study	c
or	c
work	c
,	c
I	c
use	c
a	i
internet	i
,	c
which	c
is	c
the	c
easist	i
way	c
to	c
get	c
informations	i
all	i
around	c
the	c
world	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
never	c
traveled	i
abroad	c
and	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
if	c
I	c
should	c
bring	c
a	c
credit	c
card	c
with	c
me	c

To	c
make	c
things	c
worse	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
at	c
20.15	c
instead	c
of	c
19.30	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

I	c
'm	c
sure	c
he	c
did	c
it	c
not	c
because	c
he	c
wanted	c
to	c
spoil	c
everything	c
,	c
but	c
because	c
he	c
was	c
so	c
happy	c
and	c
excited	c
,	i
that	c
he	c
could	c
n't	c
act	c
in	c
a	c
different	c
way	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
in	c
July	c
after	c
taking	c
my	c
examination	c
at	c
the	i
college	c
in	i
the	c
end	c
of	c
June	c
.	c

I	c
just	c
wonder	c
how	c
much	c
time	c
we	c
spend	c
shopping	c
at	c
the	c
supermarket	c
or	c
how	c
much	c
time	c
we	c
spend	c
buying	c
cloths	i
.	c

Now	c
I	c
am	c
answering	c
your	c
questions	c
and	c
then	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
further	i
information	c
about	c
travel	c
and	c
accomodation	i
.	c

So	c
when	c
I	c
go	c
back	c
home	c
I	c
can	c
use	c
my	c
best	c
pictures	c
to	c
reproduce	c
them	c
as	c
a	c
painting	c
.	c

There	c
is	c
somebody	c
who	c
says	c
that	c
'	c
Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
'	i
and	c
who	c
is	c
happy	c
only	c
when	c
can	i
go	c
shopping	c
.	c

For	c
istance	i
,	c
it	c
is	c
funny	i
enter	i
a	c
clothes	c
shop	c
and	c
try	c
on	c
a	c
skirt	c
or	c
a	c
t-shirt	i
although	c
you	c
do	c
not	c
buy	c
anything	c
.	c

I	c
often	c
like	c
getting	i
gifts	c
for	c
my	c
relatives	c
and	c
friends	c
.	c

Because	c
my	c
course	c
finishes	c
at	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
June	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
going	c
to	c
work	c
for	c
a	c
Hotel	i
in	c
August	c
and	c
September	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
.	c

As	c
far	c
as	c
accommodation	c
is	c
concern	i
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
I	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
tents	c
.	c

From	c
:	c

Because	c
there	c
are	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
activities	c
which	c
students	c
take	c
part	c
in	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
just	c
received	c
your	c
letter	c
informing	c
me	c
that	c
I	c
won	c
a	c
two	c
week	c
holiday	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
to	c
indicate	i
my	i
preferences	c
for	c
the	c
travel	c
and	c
the	c
accomodation	i

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
also	c
what	c
I	c
will	c
have	c
to	c
pay	c
with	i
my	c
money	c
and	c
how	c
the	c
climate	i
is	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
decide	c
which	c
clothes	c
to	c
bring	c
.	c

In	c
this	c
case	c
,	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
long	c
queues	c
,	c
you	c
ca	c
n't	c
walk	c
without	c
being	c
pulled	c
or	c
pushed	c

and	c
you	c
often	c
have	c
to	c
spend	c
a	i
hour	c
to	i
buy	i
some	c
soap	c
or	c
a	c
packet	c
of	c
biscuits	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
in	c
the	c
future	c

Further	i

possible	c
to	c

many	c
patients	c
who	c

I	c

Well	c
I	c

I	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c

Recently	c
we	c
have	i
a	c
class	c
discussion	c
about	c
shopping	c
.	c

Sometimes	c
you	c
ca	c
n't	c
find	c
a	c
place	c
to	c
park	c
your	c
car	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
quite	c
good	c
in	i
tennis	c
,	c
especially	c
plaing	i
in	i
two	i
pairs	i
.	c

Sometimes	c
I	c
hate	c
it	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
am	c
with	c
my	c
children	c
I	c
can	c
lean	i
them	c
reading	i
,	c
counting	i
,	i
if	i
they	i
only	i
do	c
n't	c
run	c
away	c
from	c
me	c
to	c
educate	c
themself	i
in	c
the	c
huge	c
world	c
,	c
which	i
name	i
is	c
"	c
shopping	c
"	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
your	c
famous	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
that	c
I	c
will	c
enjoy	c
my	c
journey	c
!	c

Sometimes	c
shopping	c
can	c
relax	c
people	c
and	c
increase	c
people	c
's	c
working	c
express	i
.	c

But	c
is	c
it	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
?	c

Of	c
course	c
not	c
.	c

How	c
can	c
shopping	c
be	c
enjoyable	c
at	i
thoese	i
situation	c
!	c

I	c
arrived	c
at	c
the	c
theatre	c
at	c
19:30	c
,	c
found	c
my	c
seat	c
and	c
waited	c
for	c
forty-five	c
minutes	c
,	c
with	c
two	c
hundred	c
other	c
people	c
for	i
the	c
show	c
to	c
start	c
.	c

I	c
became	c
furious	c
when	c
I	c
saw	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
there	c
were	c
n't	c
any	c
employees	c
to	c
work	i
.	i

The	i
last	c
forty	c
years	c
,	c
technology	c
has	c
been	c
growing	c
very	c
fast	c
.	c

I	c
do	i
really	i
trusted	i
her	c
when	c
three	c
days	c
after	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
school	c
and	c
I	c
could	c
appreciate	i
I	c
was	c
catching	i
the	i
eyes	i
of	c
everybody	c
.	c

I	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
log	i
cabin	c
rather	c
than	c
in	c
tent	i
because	c
I	c
am	c
not	c
used	c
to	c
with	i
narrow	c
space	i
and	c
feel	c
more	c
comfortable	c
with	c
a	c
place	c
like	c
bedroom	i
.	c

Sorry	c
for	i
I	c
have	c
n't	c
written	c
to	c
you	c
for	c
such	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
've	c
got	c
a	c
good	c
excute	i
!	c

You	c
know	c
!	i
because	c
of	c
these	i
are	i
change	i
all	i
my	i
opinions	i
about	i
self-important	i
behavior	i
of	i
superstar	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
exciting	i
and	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
doing	i
camp	i
there	c
.	c

It	i
's	i
been	i
ages	i
to	i
write	i
letters	i
to	i
you	i
.	i

Can	c
you	c
believe	c
it	c
?	c

Moreover	c
,	c
I	c
bought	c
a	c
£	c
20	c
ticket	c
without	c
any	c
discount	c
even	i
the	c
advertisement	c
mentioned	c
discount	i
is	i
available	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
disappointed	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
the	c
actors	c
showed	c
up	c
on	c
stage	c
because	c
they	c
were	c
not	c
actors	i
who	c
you	c
advertised	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
receiving	c
your	c
cheque	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

I	c
used	c
to	c
write	c
letters	c
but	c
it	c
takes	c
time	c
to	c
arrive	c
there	c
or	c
sometimes	c
disappear	i
so	i
E-mail	c
is	c
brilliant	c
for	c
my	c
life	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
to	c
this	c
,	c
doing	i
internet	i
is	c
quite	c
useful	c
and	c
helpful	c
to	c
have	c
information	c
from	c
all	c
over	c
the	c
world	c
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
in	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
many	c
advantages	c
in	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
at	c
present	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
recommend	c
people	c
learn	c
computers	c
and	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
say	c
"	c
Enjoy	c
your	c
lives	c
"	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
really	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
my	c
stay	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
and	c
to	c
your	c
response	i
in	i
this	i
regard	i
.	c

Valverde	c

70	c
%	c
of	c
students	c
think	c
we	c
should	c
film	c
the	c
Speech	c
and	c
Drama	c
lesson	c
because	c
is	i
one	c
of	c
the	c
lessons	c
they	c
enjoy	c
the	c
most	c
.	c

It	c
will	c
be	c
called	c
"	c
A	c
day	c
in	c
the	c
life	c
of	c
the	c
mysterious	c
student	c
X.	c
"	c
It	c
will	c
be	c
shot	c
just	c
as	c
if	c
the	c
viewers	c
were	c
student	c
X	c
,	c
not	c
seeing	c
him	c
but	c
being	c

Student	c
X	c
will	c
answer	c
questions	c
,	c
speak	c
with	c
his	c
classmates	c
,	c
even	c
cheat	c
at	c
an	c
exam	c
!	c

The	c
tickets	c
were	c
a	c
little	c
expensive	c
but	c
I	c
was	c
with	c
other	i
TEN	c
people	c
,	c
so	c
when	c
we	c
read	c
"	c
Discounts	c
Available	c
"	c
we	c
expected	c
that	c
the	c
theatre	c
had	c
organised	c
a	c
special	c
discount	c
for	c
group	i
of	c
numerous	i
people	c
.	c

It	c
would	c
be	c
great	c
to	c
take	c
a	c
trip	c
to	c
Greenwich	c
by	c
boat	c
.	c

We	c
all	c
would	c
love	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
meeting	c
you	c
to	c
discuss	c
this	c
matter	c
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
both	c
advantages	c
and	c
disadvantages	c
of	i
covering	c
celebrities	c
.	c

I	c
see	c
people	c
who	c
run	c
the	c
camp	c
are	c
very	c
good	c
in	i
organize	i
a	i
social	c
life	c
of	c
their	c
guests	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
posibilities	i
for	c
spending	c
my	c
spare	c
time	c
.	c

The	c
aim	c
of	c
this	c
report	c
is	c
to	c
suggest	c
which	c
lessons	c
and	c
other	c
activities	c
should	c
be	c
place	i
at	i
video	i
film	c
about	c
daily	c
life	c
at	c
our	c
school	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
,	c

I	c
also	c
would	c
like	i
to	i
prefer	c
log	c
cabins	c
for	c
accommodation	c
.	c

Especially	i
it	i
is	i
one	i
of	i
the	i
hobbies	i
for	i
women	i
.	c

In	c
addition	c
,	c
a	c
shop	c
assistant	c
gives	c
them	c
a	i
wrong	c
advice	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
always	c
dreamt	c
about	c
sleeping	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
,	c
in	c
sleeping	c
bags	c
,	c
but	c
my	c
parent	i
always	c
took	c
me	c
to	c
expensive	c
hotels	c
,	c
so	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
nice	c
adventure	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
like	c
going	c
between	c
colourful	c
shelfs	i
and	c
picking	c
some	c
nice	c
things	c
for	c
dinner	c
or	c
for	c
decorating	c
our	c
house	c
with	c
.	c

Another	c
period	c
when	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
like	c
doing	c
shopping	c
is	c
when	c
there	c
is	c
a	c
huge	c
sale	c
!	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
to	c
see	c
at	i
what	c
time	c
was	i
the	i
show	i
,	c
19.30	c
,	i
it	i
was	c
O.K.	i
so	c
I	c
bought	c
a	c
ticket	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
difficult	c
for	c
us	c
to	c
realize	i
the	c
changes	c
in	c
our	c
live	i
,	c
but	c
we	c
can	c
think	c
about	c
it	i
.	c

Everything	c
is	c
faster	c
,	c
and	c
sometimes	c
technology	c
go	i
so	c
fast	c
that	c
I	c
'm	c
unable	c
to	c
follow	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
went	c
to	c
London	c
for	c
a	c
week	c
's	c
holiday	c
with	c
some	c
friends	c
and	c
every	c
evening	c
we	c
decided	c
something	i
to	i
do	i
in	c
order	c
to	c
enjoy	c
our	c
staying	i
in	c
that	c
beautiful	c
city	c
.	c

I	c
wish	c
we	c
had	c
never	c
chosen	c
your	c
show	c
.	c

In	c
fact	c
,	c
only	i
after	i
having	c
going	i
into	c
the	c
theatre	c
,	c
I	c
realized	c
that	c
the	c
advertisement	c
I	c
had	c
read	c
was	c
probably	c
about	c
another	c
show	c
.	c

Besides	c
,	c
when	c
we	c
decided	c
to	c
spend	c
the	c
evening	c
in	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
,	c
we	c
were	c
informed	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
the	c
chef	c
was	c
ill	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

So	c
,	c
when	c
Peter	c
,	c
who	c
has	c
been	c
a	c
friend	c
of	c
mine	c
since	c
we	c
were	c
children	c
invited	i
me	c
for	c
a	c
pizza	c
,	c
I	c
accepted	c
without	c
thinking	c
at	i
the	c
consequences	c
.	c

Nobody	c
informed	c
me	c
about	c
it	i
.	c

It	c
could	i
n't	i
allow	i
us	c
to	i
think	i
and	c
to	i
do	i
freely	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
really	c
glad	c
to	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
win	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
and	c
travel	c
to	c
the	c
U.S.A.	c
which	i
I	c
used	c
to	c
dream	c
.	i

Finally	c
,	c
what	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
is	c
what	c
sort	c
of	c
cloths	i
are	c
suitable	c
for	c
the	i
travelling	c
,	c
and	c
also	c
,	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	i
should	i
prepare	c
for	c
the	c
travelling	i
,	c
approximately	c
.	c

Takashi	c
Oshima	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
receive	i
further	c
information	c
about	c
which	i
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
should	c
put	i
off	i
during	c
my	c
holiday	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
know	i
if	c
I	c
should	c
bring	c
with	c
me	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
money	c
.	c

Your	i
sincerelly	i

Looking	c
forward	c
to	c
meeting	i
you	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c
.	c

This	i
period	c
the	c
days	c
are	c
sunny	c
and	c
the	c
weather	c
wo	c
n't	c
prevent	c
me	c
from	c
doing	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
activities	c
.	c

With	c
reference	c
to	c
the	c
accommodation	c
I	i
would	c
prefer	c
log	i
cabins	i
to	c
tents	i
.	c

I	c
feel	c
really	c
happy	c
that	c
I	c
participated	c
in	c
this	c
event	c
.	c

Last	c
week	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
see	c
a	c
musical	c
show	c
called	c
'	c
OVER	c
THE	c
RAINBOW	c
'	c
at	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

We	c
had	c
this	c
idea	c
first	c
,	i
when	c
we	c
watched	c
a	c
movie	c
about	c
the	c
Italian	c
mafia	c
in	c
an	c
English	c
lesson	c
in	c
school	c
.	c

Regarding	c
to	i
the	c
activities	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
rather	c
choose	c
singing	c
and	c
painting	c
,	c
as	c
unfortunately	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
not	c
good	c
at	c
sports	c
.	c

I	c
normally	c
bring	i
blushes	i
,	c
paints	c
and	c
paper	c
instead	c
of	c
camera	i
when	c
I	c
travel	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
receiving	c
your	c
reply	c
.	c

This	c
was	c
the	c
best	c
experience	c
.	c

13	c
.	c

By	c
the	c
way	c
,	c
I	c
'm	c
wondering	c
what	c
kinds	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
should	c
prepare	i
and	c
how	c
much	c
much	i
I	c
should	c
bring	c
with	c
myself	i
.	c

Additionally	c
,	c
15	c
%	c
of	c
students	c
answered	c
they	i
want	c
the	c
presentation	c
lesson	c
to	c
be	c
filmed	c
.	c

The	c
reason	c
why	c
they	c
choose	c
this	c
lesson	c
is	c
that	c
every	c
student	c
in	c
their	c
turn	c
of	i
presentation	c
does	c
his	c
or	c
her	c
best	c
.	c

She	c
liked	c
him	c
very	c
much	c
.	c

She	c
disappeared	c

We	c
called	c
the	c
police	c

I	i
am	i
wondering	i
that	i
I	c
will	c
be	i
only	i
able	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
finish	c
my	c
first	c
year	c
at	c
the	c
university	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
was	c
14	c
,	c
I	c
won	c
the	i
competition	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
fine	c
.	c

Now	c
,	c
I	c
know	c
how	c
difficult	c
to	i
sing	c
in	c
front	c
of	c
the	i
audience	c
and	c
behind	c
the	c
start	i
there	c
are	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
the	i
people	c
who	c
help	c
the	c
performance	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
want	c
take	i
too	c
much	c

jeans	c

swimming	c
costium	i

T-shirt	c
,	c

shoes	c
I	c
think	c
should	c
b	i
O.K	c
.	c

At	c
first	c
I	c
was	c
helping	c
to	c
seill	i
the	c
tickets	c
-	c
was	i
n't	c
difficult	c
.	c

Some	c
of	c
them	c
were	c
speaking	c
with	c
her	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
n't	c
this	c
lucky	c
person	c

but	c
still	c
I	c
'm	c
happy	c
,	c
that	c
I	c
could	c
be	c

I	c
have	c
some	c
doubts	i
about	c
my	c

Is	c
all	i
the	i

already	c
paid	c

There	c
was	c
a	c
concert	c
of	i
a	c
famous	c
band	c
here	c
in	c
my	c
city	c
.	c

He	c
asked	c
if	c
we	c
could	c
help	c
.	c

We	c
answered	c
:	c
"	c
Yes	c
!	c
"	c

We	c
started	c
to	c
put	c
everthing	i
on	c
the	c
stage	c
and	c
after	c
this	c
we	c
realized	c
that	c
the	c
band	c
was	c
entering	i
into	i
the	c
stage	c
near	c
us	c

GUSTAV	c

I	c
will	c
be	c
very	c
busy	c
in	c
June	c
so	c
let	c
me	c
tell	c
you	c
some	c
details	c
about	c
my	c
travel	i
.	c

And	c
there	c
are	c
few	i
questions	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
.	c

First	c
,	c
what	c
clothes	c
should	c
I	c
take	c
with	c
me	c
,	i
secondly	i
.	i

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

I	c
came	i
into	c
their	c
room	c
and	c
give	i
hot	c
Cheeseburgers	c
,	c
Coca-Cola	c
and	c
ice-cream	c
to	c
Peter	c
.	c

But	c
in	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
there	c
was	c
a	i
another	c
actor	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
note	c
also	i
says	c
that	c
the	c
show	c
start	i
at	c
19:30	c
,	c
and	c
so	c
I	c
went	c
in	c
at	c
19:25	c
.	c

The	i
note	i
says	i
that	i
your	i
perfect	i
evening	i
out	i
,	i
I	i
thought	i
I	i
could	i
get	i
my	i
money	i
back	i
,	i
with	i
your	i
poor	i
service	i
and	i
all	i
my	i
reasons	i
,	i
But	i
it	i
was	i
not	i
ask	i
for	i
money	i
back	i
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
before	i
people	c
have	i
to	c
walk	c
from	c
a	i
place	c
to	c
the	i
other	i
,	c
but	c
now	c
we	c
can	c
use	c
sciene	i
and	c
technology	c
to	c
produce	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
petrel	i
transport	i
and	c
we	c
can	c
transport	i
with	i
them	i
faster	i
.	c

We	c
also	i
can	i
produce	c
more	c
and	c
better	c
food	c
or	i
using	c
science	c
and	c
technology	c
.	i

Science	c
and	c
technology	c
can	c
give	c
us	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
good	c
thing	i
for	c
our	c
daily	c
life	c
,	c
make	i
us	i
easy	i
to	c
do	c
thing	i
or	c
work	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

We	c
spoke	i
with	i
Pat	c
many	c
times	c
to	c
keep	c
this	c
secret	c
,	c
not	c
to	c
tell	c
anyone	c
.	c

He	c
will	c
be	c
in	c
the	i
prison	c
5	i
years	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
read	c
the	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
festival	c
and	c
I	c
must	c
say	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
idea	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

I	c
will	c
explain	c
these	c
now	c
and	c
want	c
to	c
ask	c
to	c
get	c
some	i
of	i
the	i
money	i
I	i
have	i
given	i
you	i
back	i
.	c

When	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
buy	c
tickets	c
,	c
they	c
did	c
n't	c
accept	i
the	i
discounts	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
not	c
a	c
good	c
example	c
for	i
modern	c
technology	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
's	c
a	c
piece	c
of	c
technology	c
at	c
last	i
!	c

A	c
wonderful	c
example	c
for	i
modern	c
technology	c
:	c
Computer	i
!	c

And	c
Internet	i
.	c

You	c
can	c
have	c
information	c
about	c
all	c
the	i
things	c
,	c
go	i
everywhere	c

You	c
see	c
,	c
our	c
daily	c
life	c
consists	c
of	c
modern	c
technology	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
photography	c
as	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
photographer	c
in	c
a	c
club	c
while	c
I	c
was	c
in	c
the	i
college	c
.	c

I	c
like	c
ice	c
cram	i
,	c
sweets	c
and	c
beverage	i
very	c
much	c
especially	i
in	c
the	c
summer	c

Shin	c
Parade	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
to	c
make	c
complaints	i
for	i
the	c
very	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
I	c
had	c
at	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
found	c
that	c
there	c
were	c
no	c
discounts	c
as	c
it	i
was	i
announced	i
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
.	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

The	c
second	c
day	i
objective	c
was	c
to	c
install	c
the	c
scene	i
,	i
with	i
lights	i
,	i
loudspeakers	i
and	i
all	i
stuff	i
.	c

This	c
job	c
was	c
quite	c
hard	c
,	c
but	c
we	c
took	c
enough	i
time	c
to	i
be	i
not	i
exhausted	i
!	c

The	c
place	c
to	c
spend	c
the	c
night	c
will	c
still	c
be	c
the	c
bed	c
.	c

Also	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
do	c
two	c
activities	c
while	c
I	c
am	c
at	c
the	c
Camp	c
which	i
are	c
swimming	c
and	c
photography	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
known	i
,	c
I	c
like	c
drawing	c
and	c
painting	c
when	c
I	c
have	c
a	i
free	c
time	c
so	c
that	c
why	i
I	c
chose	c
to	c
paint	c
the	c
scence	i
of	i
the	i
background	i
.	c

I	c
was	c
pleasantly	c
surprised	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
.	c

As	c
I	c
am	c
doing	c
my	c
A-levels	i
exams	c
at	c
the	c
moment	c
and	c
they	c
continue	c
until	c
the	c
30th	c
of	c
June	c
and	c
my	c
further	c
studies	c
start	c
in	c
August	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
only	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
.	c

Hi	c
,	c
how	c
are	c
you	c
?	c

And	c
you	c
might	i
manage	i
to	c
speak	c
to	c
some	c
pop-stars	c
.	c

On	c
Saturday	c
,	c
June	c
5th	c
,	c
2000	c
my	c
wife	c
and	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
spend	i
a	c
nice	c
and	c
enjoyable	c
evening	c
and	c
decided	c
to	c
go	c
and	c
see	c
the	c
musical	c
.	c

yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

Firstly	c
,	c
the	c
material	c
of	c
which	c
clothes	c
are	c
made	c
has	i
a	i
wide	c
range	i
.	c

One	i
balance	i
fashion	c
in	c
100	c
years	c
time	c
will	c
be	c
confortable	i
and	c
colourful	c
.	c

There	c
will	c
be	c
clothes	c
for	c
everyones	i
tast	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hear	i
from	c
you	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
a	c
friend	c
and	c
she	c
knows	c
that	c
I	c
speak	c
English	c
so	i
she	c
offered	c
to	i
me	c
work	c
with	c
an	c
English	c
singer	c
so	i
I	c
said	i
"	i
yes	i
,	i
of	c
course	c
"	c
.	c

You	c
know	c
,	c
he	c
is	c
my	c
favourite	c
singer	c
.	c

He	c
was	c
very	c
kind	c
to	c
me	c
,	i
we	i
talked	c
many	i
things	c
and	c
after	c
the	c
concert	c
he	c
invited	c
all	c
the	c
team	c
to	c
have	c
a	i
dinner	c
,	i
yes	i
I	c
know	c
what	c
you	c
're	c
thinking	c
,	c
"	c
Dinner	c
and	c
Sting	c
"	i
yes	i
my	c
friend	c
it	i
was	c
the	c
best	c
thing	c
in	i
my	c
life	c
.	c

Pat	c
was	c
my	c
best	c
friend	c
.	c

I	c
told	c
her	c
all	c
my	c
problems	c
and	c
I	c
could	c
rely	c
on	c
her	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
been	c
asked	c
by	c
my	c
classmates	c
to	c
write	c
to	c
you	c
to	c
suggest	c
a	c
new	c
activity	c
which	c
you	c
could	c
include	c
in	c
the	c
London	c
programme	c
if	c
you	c
liked	i
it	c
.	c

Nevertheless	c
,	c
when	c
I	c
found	c
him	c
studying	c
harder	i
for	c
his	c
final	c
exams	c
I	c
realised	c
I	c
would	c
rather	c
her	i
girlfriend	c
explained	i
my	c
poor	c
brother	c
the	c
truth	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
the	c
truth	c
was	c
that	c
not	i
sooner	c
had	c
I	c
arrived	c
home	c
than	c
my	c
brother	c
asked	c
me	c
crying	i
why	i
I	c
had	c
told	i
his	i
girlfriend	i
's	i
affair	i
to	i
Pat	i
instead	c
of	c
discovering	i
him	i
the	i
truth	i

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

During	c
my	c
stay	c
in	c
that	c
beautiful	c
city	c
,	c
I	c
thought	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
good	c
idea	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
to	c
enjoy	c
a	c
Musical	c
show	i
,	c
so	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
your	c
theatre	c
to	c
see	c
"	c
over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
.	c

When	c
we	c
arrived	c
at	c
the	c
beach	c
,	c
we	c
saw	c
a	c
suspicious	c
light	c
and	c
two	c
persons	i
doing	c
something	c
we	c
could	c
n't	c
see	c
very	c
well	c
.	c

Yours	c

I	c
've	c

But	c
eventhough	i
all	c
of	c
these	c
desadventages	i
above	i
,	c
I	c
was	c
folling	i
my	c
dreams	c

objectives	c
and	c
inspite	i
of	c
everything	c
I	c
was	c
going	c

I	c
would	c

I	c

ticket	c
was	c
because	c
of	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Trulove	c
,	c
as	i
your	i
advertisement	i
had	i
shown	i
.	c

From	i
every	i
singular	i
things	i
I	i
have	i
complained	i
,	i
it	i
was	c
totally	c
different	c
from	c
what	c
your	c
advertisment	i
said	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
see	i
that	i
this	i
is	i
a	i
good	i
reason	i
,	c
please	c
telephone	c
me	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
not	c
good	c
at	c
all	c
and	c
my	c
evening	c
was	c
spoiled	c
in	c
spite	c
of	c
all	c
that	c
advertisement	i
promissed	i
.	c

I	c
was	c
so	c
scare	i
and	c
frighten	i
because	c
if	c
I	c
was	c
caught	c
I	c
would	c
be	c
punished	c
.	c

Over	i
these	i
the	i
tickets	i
were	i
not	i
discount	i
available	c
as	c
you	c
have	i
written	c
in	i
your	c
advertisement	c
.	c

After	c
she	c
came	c
home	c
her	c
mother	c
was	c
sitting	c
in	c
front	c
of	c
the	c
TV	c
and	c
looked	c
after	i
the	c
lottery-numbers	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
to	c
thank	c
for	i
so	i
good	c
organisation	c
of	c
International	i
Arts	c
Festival	c
,	c
where	c
I	i
'd	i
spent	i
two	c
exellent	i
days	c
recently	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
hope	c
that	c
next	c
year	c
visitores	i
of	i
festival	i
would	i
be	i
able	c
to	c
introduce	i
with	i
more	c
art	c
groups	c
from	c
all	c
over	c
the	c
world	c
.	c

All	c
that	i
discos	c
,	c
concerts	c
,	c
touristic	i
trips	c
have	c
to	c
be	c
paid	c
by	i
a	i
different	c
sum	i
of	c
those	c
small	c
coloured	c
pieces	c
of	c
paper	c
,	i
called	c
money	c

Firstly	c
,	c
there	c
were	c
stars	c
and	c
artists	c
only	i
from	i
six	c
countries	c
.	c

The	i
films	i
and	i
plays	i
were	i
not	i
so	i
many	i
.	c

If	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
,	c
you	c

The	i
modern	i
technology	c
like	c

for	i

has	i
changed	c
my	c
life	c
a	c
lot	c
both	c
in	c
good	c
and	c
bad	c
ways	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
think	c
that	c
I	c
had	i
been	i
going	c
to	c
Japan	c
if	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
because	i
of	i
internet	i

I	c
am	c
very	c
glad	c
that	c
all	c
accommodation	c
and	c
travel	c
costs	c
are	c
paid	c
,	c
but	c
even	i
though	i
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
do	i
I	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
with	c
me	c
.	c

Under	c
these	c
circumstances	c
,	c
as	c
your	c
Theatre	c
did	c
not	c
fullfil	i
its	c
commitments	c
,	c
I	c
ask	c
you	c
for	c
a	c
full	c
refund	c
and	c
I	c
expect	c
to	c
receive	c
a	c
cheque	c
of	i
£	c
15	c
,	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c
Yours	c
faithfully	c

However	c

I	c
could	c
enjoy	c
it	c

even	c
though	c
I	c
was	c
a	c

so	c
I	c
would	c

Introduction	c
:	c
The	c
aim	c
of	c
this	c
report	c
is	c
to	c
summerize	i
the	c
suitable	i
lessons	c
and	c
activities	c
be	i
filmed	c
.	c

Basketball	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
inform	c
you	c
that	c
I	c
am	c
able	c
to	c
travel	c
only	c
in	c
July	c
.	c

Also	c
Tennis	i
is	c
my	c
favourite	c
hobby	c
and	c
I	c
play	c
twice	c
every	i
week	c
with	c
my	c
friends	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c

Dear	c
Kim	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
spare	c
time	c
I	c
like	c
to	c
play	c
basketball	c
for	c
a	c
local	c
team	c
of	c
which	c
I	c
have	c
recently	c
been	c
made	c
captain	c
.	c

Is	c
there	c
an	c
extra	c
charge	c
for	c
some	c
trips	c
,	c
which	c
might	c
put	c
them	c
beyond	c
my	c
means	c
.	i

I	c
suggest	c
to	i
increase	i
the	c
number	c
of	c
them	c
,	c
because	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
more	c
exiting	i
to	c
film	c
.	c

I	c
know	c
I	c
will	c
have	c
the	c
chance	c
to	c
do	c
two	c
activities	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
have	c
choosen	i
two	c
from	c
your	c
list	c
:	c
Basketball	i
,	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
playing	c
it	c
since	c
I	c
was	c
eight	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
taking	i
part	i

in	c

realised	c
I	c
could	c

get	c
it	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
modern	c

could	c
affect	c
my	c
life	c
in	c
a	c
bad	c
way	c

Dear	c
Ms	c
Ryan	c
,	c

But	c
could	c
you	c
,	c
please	c
,	c
let	c
me	c
have	c
more	c
details	c
about	c
my	c
award	i
.	c

What	c
kind	c
of	c
people	c
will	c
be	c
invited	c
at	i
your	c
Camp	c
in	i
this	c
summer	c
?	c

I	c
have	c
been	c
written	i
to	c
you	c
that	c
my	c
life	c
in	c
London	c
was	i
a	c
little	c
bit	c
boring	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

My	c
Russian	c
friend	c
ivited	i
me	c
to	c
set	c
up	c
a	i
new	i
exiting	i
business	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
a	c
nice	c
expirience	i
as	c
manager	c
too	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

So	c
when	c
I	c
saw	c
the	c
show	c
I	c
felt	c
horrible	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
was	c
expecting	c
to	c
see	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
.	c

Please	c
be	c
comprehensive	i
and	c
realize	c
that	c
your	c
show	c
was	c
not	c
cheap	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

The	c
point	c
here	c
is	c
,	i
that	c
Caroline	c
choosed	i
the	c
worst	c
friend	c
to	c
told	i
this	c
.	i

He	c
could	c
n't	c
belived	i
what	c
Pat	c
had	c
told	c
him	c
,	c
so	c
he	c
broke	c
Pat	c
's	c
nose	c
.	c

The	c
students	c
in	c
my	c
class	c
have	c
seen	c
an	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
,	c
we	i
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
if	c
is	i
possible	c
to	c
make	c
some	c
changes	c
in	i
the	c
programme	c
?	i

All	c
students	i
will	i
be	c
very	c
greatful	i
.	i

After	c
hard	c
work	c
we	i
want	c
to	c
go	c
home	c
to	c
have	c
our	c
corner	c
where	c
we	c
are	c
all	i
able	c
to	c
rest	c
and	c
relax	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
now	c
writting	i
this	c
letter	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
further	c
information	c
about	c
myself	c
with	i
pleasure	i
.	c

In	c
addition	c
,	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
busy	c
with	c
my	c
cousework	i
in	c
August	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
choose	i
these	c
two	c
activities	c
while	c
I	c
am	c
at	c
the	c
Camp	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
more	c
and	c
more	c
people	c
are	c
now	c
asking	c
,	c
"	c
Is	c
shopping	c
always	c
so	c
enjoyable	c
?	c
"	c

She	c
felt	c
really	c
badly	i
after	c
that	c
.	c

There	c
are	c
many	c
things	c
that	c
can	c
go	c
wrong	c
in	c
the	c
process	c
of	c
adquiring	i
a	c
product	c
or	c
service	c
.	c

I	c
particularly	c
enjoy	c
making	c
lists	c
of	c
the	c
products	c
before	i
going	c
shopping	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerelly	i

First	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
accept	c
but	c
finally	c
she	c
conviced	i
me	c
.	c

I	c
enjoyed	c
very	i
much	c
.	c

This	c
sport	c
has	c
always	c
attracted	c
me	c
due	c
to	c
its	c
contact	c
with	c
the	c
sea	c
and	c
the	c
great	c
sensations	c
it	c
provides	c
and	c
I	c
believe	c
this	c
is	c
the	c
perfect	c
occasion	i
to	c
initiate	i
myself	c
to	c
the	i
exciting	c
sport	c
,	i
I	c
still	c
have	c
some	c
questions	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
:	c

Then	c
,	c
you	c
can	c
rest	c
a	c
little	c
and	c
examine	c
the	c
product	c
a	c
little	c
closer	c
but	c
unluckily	i
,	c
it	c
does	c
not	c
provide	c
the	c
satisfaction	c
you	c
may	c
have	c
wished	c
for	c
.	c

Dear	c
manager	i

You	c

a	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

When	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
child	c
my	c
parents	c
and	c
I	c
spent	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
time	c
at	c
camps	c
.	c

You	c
wrote	c
that	c
I	c
should	c
choose	c
two	c
activities	c
.	c

Your	i
sincerely	c

I	c
also	c
helped	c
to	c
serve	c
people	c
who	c
would	c
like	c
drink	i
,	i
I	c
was	c
like	c
a	c
barman	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
in	c
the	c
last	c
edition	i
there	i
were	i
artists	c
who	i
cames	i
from	c
only	c
six	c
countries	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
think	c
you	c
should	c
invite	c
artists	c
from	c
other	c
countries	c
,	c
for	c
example	c
from	c
Africa	c
.	c

I	c
saw	c
films	c
and	c
I	c
played	c
ping-pong	c
.	c

What	c
I	c
try	i
to	c
explain	c
is	c
that	c
in	c
every	c
book	c
there	c
are	c
characters	c
or	c
situations	c
really	i
different	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
look	c
at	c
this	c
book	c
like	c
a	c
painting	c
you	c
ca	c
n't	c
see	c
afumature	i
of	c
colours	c
,	c
you	c
see	c
only	c
primary	c
colours	c
.	c

There	c
are	c
some	c
differences	c
between	c
the	c
advertisement	c
and	c
the	c
real	c
show	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
waiting	c
for	i
your	c
reply	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c

Fashion	c
Of	c
the	c
Future	c

So	c
clothes	c
for	c
space	c
will	c
be	c
necessary	c
and	c
clothes	c
for	c
warmer	c
climates	c
will	c
be	c
necessary	c
.	c

I	c
need	c
to	c
know	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
should	c
take	c
with	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forwards	i
to	c
receiving	c
more	c
information	c
.	c

Some	c
people	c
are	c
in	c
a	c
hurry	c
other	i
are	c
agressive	i
and	c
most	c
of	c
the	c
other	i
are	c
very	c
stressed	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
which	i
I	c
went	c
to	c
see	c
last	c
week	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

We	c
had	c
to	c
come	c

this	c

we	c
had	c
to	c
sell	c
the	c
house	c
and	c
left	c
our	c
jobs	c
.	c

At	c
first	c
I	c
was	c
irritated	c
that	c
contrary	c
to	c
your	c
announcements	c
no	c
discounts	c
were	c
availlable	i
.	c

To	c
help	c
her	c
husband	c
she	c
works	c
out	c
a	c
plan	c
:	c
She	i
is	c
willing	c
to	c
be	c
witness	i
for	c
the	c
prosecution	c
and	c
states	c
that	c
her	c
husband	c
has	i
not	i
been	i
with	c
her	c
at	c
the	c
time	c
the	c
crime	c
was	c
committed	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
interesting	c
to	c
starts	i
to	c
think	c
about	c
this	c
point	c
.	c

Could	c
you	c
consider	c
this	c
for	c
us	c
?	c

Thank	c
you	c

your	c
students	c

Home	c
of	c

Future	c

In	c
Japan	c
,	c
crime	c
of	i
minority	i

increasing	c
.	c

Otherwise	i
as	i
producing	i

our	c

Regarding	c
of	i
the	c
accommodation	c
at	c
the	i
Camp	c
California	c
I	i
would	c
prefer	c
in	i
a	c
tent	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
very	i
nice	c
experience	c
and	i
I	c
love	c
to	c
share	c
with	c
other	c
people	c
.	c

Also	c
another	c
interesting	c
things	i
was	c
to	i
know	i
about	c
their	c
culture	c
,	c
because	c
all	c
of	c
them	c
come	c
from	c
Peru	c
,	c
Bolivia	c
,	c
Ecuador	c
,	c
Chile	c
and	i
Uruguay	c
.	c

The	c
main	c
problem	c
was	c
that	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
did	c
not	c
take	c
part	c
in	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
you	c
ought	c
to	c
have	c
postponed	c
the	c
show	c
and	c
have	i
reimbursed	c
me	c
a	i
ticket	c
price	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
I	c
live	c
in	c
Kursk	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
can	c
get	c
a	c
letter	c
from	c
my	c
friend	c
after	i
some	i
hours	i
since	i
he	c
has	c
written	c
it	c
.	c

Another	c
change	c
in	c
my	c
life	c
is	c
that	c
I	c
use	c
Internet	i
as	c
a	c
library	c
when	c
I	c
write	c
my	c
course	c
papers	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
is	i
very	c
cool	c
and	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
learn	c
.	c

As	c
for	c
my	c
activities	c
,	c
as	c
I	c
took	c
up	c
playing	c
golf	c
since	i
I	c
was	c
a	c
child	c
and	c
now	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
single-handicapped	c
player	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
have	c
chance	i
to	c
play	c
golf	c
at	c
camp	c
.	c

They	c
were	c
very	c
kind	c
,	c
soft	c
,	c
well-behaved	c
,	c
even	c
modest	c
.	c

People	c
are	c
getting	c
more	c
and	c
more	c
adicted	i
to	c
this	c
,	c
because	c
helps	i
every	i
day	i
life	c
to	i
be	i
easier	c
and	c
more	c
confortable	i

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

Despite	c
saying	c
it	c
will	i
start	c
at	c
19:30	c
,	c
it	c
done	i
at	c
20:15	c
which	i
I	c
think	c
is	c
to	i
much	i
late	c
for	c
a	c
good	c
theatre	c
like	c
yours	c
.	c

For	c
all	c
of	i
that	i
,	c
I	c
want	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
,	c
at	c
least	c
15	c
of	c
the	c
20	c
pounds	c
I	i
'd	i
paid	i
.	c

And	c
she	c
had	c
planned	c
with	c
my	c
friends	c
went	i
there	i
without	c
me	c
.	c

The	c
respect	i
of	c
Famous	c
people	c
's	c
private	c
life	i
has	c
always	c
been	c
a	c
hot	c
topic	c
...	c

On	c
the	c
one	c
hand	c
,	c
those	c
people	c
are	c
equal	i
to	i
us	c
in	c
the	c
way	c
that	c
they	c
had	c
a	c
childhood	c
,	c
thy	i
got	c
married	c
and	c
built	i
a	c
family	c
...	c

Well	c
,	c
some	c
people	c
would	c
agree	i
whereas	c
others	c
would	c
desagree	i
.	c

It	c
made	c
me	c
sad	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
found	c
very	i
expensive	c
to	c
buy	c
them	c
but	c
there	c
are	c
number	i
of	c
advantages	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
dishwashers	c
are	c
very	c
effecient	i
for	c
me	c
because	c
I	c
work	c
full	i
time	i
and	c
look	c
after	c
my	c
children	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
very	c
difficult	c
to	c
cook	c
and	c
wash	c
dishes	c
after	c
working	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c

some	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
the	c
advertisement	c
said	c
we	c
could	c
buy	c

but	c
when	c
I	c

to	c

it	i
your	c

a	c

Dear	c

Last	c
night	c
,	c
me	c
and	c
my	c
family	c
visited	c
your	c
theatre	c
,	c
and	c
we	c
had	c
a	c
very	c
disappointing	c
evening	c

It	c
was	c
last	i
poin	i
to	i
get	i
me	c
angry	c
.	c

From	c
small	i
village	c
to	c
town	i
was	c
very	i
long	c
way	c
becouse	i
the	i
people	c
used	c

wagon	c

New	c
techology	i
more	i
our	c
life	i
more	c
comfortable	c

We	c
have	c
had	c
a	c
quite	c
pleasant	c
time	c
except	c
the	i
evening	c
.	c

Actually	c
it	c
spoiled	c
our	c
time	c
.	c

Third	c
,	c
there	c
was	c
no	c
possibility	c
of	c
discount	i
.	c

How	c
could	c
you	c
arrange	c
work	c
like	c
that	c
?	c

It	c
was	c
most	i
imperfect	c
evening	c
out	c
I	c
ever	c
exprienced	i

Dear	c
Mrs.	c
Ryan	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

Love	c
from	c

Firstly	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
said	c
that	c
the	c
stars	c
who	c
were	c
invited	i
to	i
the	i
estatement	i
were	c
Dany	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
.	c

The	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
show	c
announced	c
that	c
we	c
were	i
able	c
to	c
visit	c
the	c
Theatre	c
restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
due	i
to	i
the	c
Chef	c
who	c
leaded	i
the	c
Restaurant	c
did	c
not	c
remember	c
to	c
bring	c
the	c
keys	c
to	c
open	c
it	c
.	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

Thanks	c
in	c
advance	c
for	c
you	i
advice	c
.	c

I	c
tried	c
to	c
take	c
a	c
photo	c
of	c
everyone	c
,	c
but	c
sometimes	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
possible	c
.	c

bye-bye	c
.	c

The	c
problem	c
came	c
.	c

You	c
can	c
say	c
they	c
wore	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
clothes	c
at	c
one	c
time	c
.	c

The	c
clothes	c
you	c
'll	c
wear	c
will	c
be	c
very	c
extraordinary	c
because	c
of	c
their	c
special	c
kind	i
of	c
producing	i
.	c

On	c
14th	c
June	c
2000	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
see	c
your	c
"	c
Over	c
The	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
musical	c
show	c
and	c
I	i
have	i
a	c
few	c
points	i
which	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
bring	c
to	c
your	c
attention	c
.	c

As	i
I	c
came	c
to	c
London	c
on	c
holidays	i
and	c
purchased	c
"	c
The	c
London	c
City	c
Guide	c
"	c
I	c
saw	c
your	c
advertisement	c
explaining	c
that	c
people	c
could	c
buy	c
discounted	c
tickets	c
for	c
£	c
5	c
in	c
advance	c
.	c

Two	c
days	c
ago	c
,	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
"	c
over	i
the	i
rainbow	i
"	c
at	c
your	c
theatre	c
.	c

The	c
audience	c
were	c
anxious	c
and	c
bored	c
.	c

What	c
made	c
things	c
even	c
worse	c
was	c
that	c
the	c
leading	c
actor	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
did	c
not	c
appear	c
at	i
the	c
stage	c
at	c
all	c
.	c

Modern	c
technology	c
has	c
changed	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
in	c
two	c
ways	c
.	c

But	c
the	c
question	c
is	c
:	c
Why	i
shopping	i
is	i
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
?	c
.	i

For	c
many	c
people	c
,	c
shopping	c
had	i
always	c
been	c
only	c
for	c
one	c
kind	c
of	c
elite	c
,	c
or	c
social	c
class	c
;	c
not	c
all	c
people	c
can	c
go	c
shopping	c
and	c
buy	c
hundreds	c
and	c
thousands	c
of	c
stuff	i
in	c
those	c
big	c
malls	c
as	c
distraction	i
.	c

The	c
tickets	i
discounts	c
was	i
not	c
available	c
under	c
any	c
subconstanses	i
and	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

About	c
accommodation	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
a	i
long	i
cabin	c
because	c
last	c
year	c
I	c
had	c
an	c
accident	c
and	c
my	c
back	c
is	i
enjure	i
,	c
so	c
sleeping	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
it	i
would	c
be	c
painful	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
play	c
basketball	c
at	c
university	c
and	c
my	c
level	i
is	c
quite	c
good	c
but	c
I	i
am	c
really	c
enjoying	c
is	c
being	c
a	c
referee	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
n't	c
a	c
nice	c
job	c
but	c
I	c
had	c
all	c
night	c
for	c
drinking	c
and	c
dancing	c
of	c
course	c
,	i
I	c
had	i
not	i
to	c
pay	c
for	i
getting	i
in	c
.	c

This	c
show	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
be	c
a	c
perfect	c
event	c
but	c
actually	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
very	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
.	c

How	c
could	c
that	c
happen	c
?	c

I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
know	i

Last	c

I	c
cam	i
to	c
your	c
musical	c
show	c
,	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
"	c
and	i
I	c
was	c
very	c
disappointed	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
what	i
you	c
writed	i
in	c
your	c
advertisement	c
.	c

They	i
were	c
Kevin	c
Starr	c
and	c
Jessica	c
Richmond	c
.	c

For	c
me	c
,	c
this	c
a	c
big	c
mistake	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
like	c
to	c
have	i
such	i
big	i
change	i
in	i
time	i
.	c

This	c
is	c
a	c
good	c
one	c
because	c
you	c
can	c
see	c
what	c
is	c
happening	c
around	c
you	c
and	c
everywhere	c
else	c
on	c
Earth	c

Dear	c
Ryan	c
,	c

In	c
addition	c
speaking	c
activity	c
include	i
everything	c
to	i
learn	i
English	c
such	c
as	c
listening	c
,	c
speaking	c
,	c
grammer	i
as	c
well	c
.	c

Having	c
fun	c
and	c
knowing	i
new	c
knowledge	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
really	c
good	c
at	c
playing	c
tennis	c
and	c
singing	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
do	i
shopping	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
think	c
about	c
any	c
problems	c
I	c
have	c
.	c

Imagine	c
you	c
have	c
three	c
children	c
and	c
you	c
are	c
going	c
shopping	c
with	c
them	c
.	c

Concerning	c
the	c
accommodation	c
,	c
I	c
'd	c
prefer	c
to	c
spend	c
my	c
nights	c
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
've	c
great	c
difficulty	c
sleeping	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
.	c

You	c
also	c
mentionned	i
the	c
activities	c
I	c
'll	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
do	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
to	c
this	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
be	c
grateful	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
send	c
me	c
information	i
on	c
these	c
few	c
details	i
:	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
is	i
required	c
?	c

And	c
should	c
I	c
take	c
some	c
money	c
with	c
me	c
?	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
you	c
ca	c
n't	c
understand	c
all	c
the	c
links	c
between	c
the	c
events	c
whitout	i
reading	c
the	c
book	c
more	c
than	c
one	i
time	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
show	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
,	c
which	c
was	i
played	i
in	c
the	c
"	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
"	c
,	c
because	c
the	c
information	c
which	c
was	c
given	c
in	c
your	c
advertisement	c
was	c
not	c
true	c
at	c
all	c
.	c

So	c
the	c
main	c
point	i
of	c
my	c
visit	c
had	c
dissappeared	i
.	c

But	c
there	c
is	c
still	c
another	c
point	c
:	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
where	c
I	c
had	c
decided	c
having	i
supper	c
was	c
closed	c
,	c
without	c
saying	i
the	c
reason	c
.	c

But..what	c

My	c
opinion	c
?	c

After	c
a	c
boring	c
play	c
,	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
go	c
an	i
theatre	c
restaurant	c
,	c
but	c
uncertainly	i
it	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

The	c
principal	c
reason	c
for	i
I	c
'm	c
writting	i
you	i
at	c
the	c
moment	c
is	c
that	c
I	c
want	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
felt	c
so	c
disappointing	i
with	c
the	c
theatre	c
and	c
also	c
with	c
the	c
play	c
.	c

An	c
extract	i
could	c
be	c
the	c
popular	c
chats	i
,	c
where	c
people	c
write	c
with	c
the	c
keyboard	c
what	c
they	c
want	c
to	c
tell	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
'm	c
available	c
for	i
travel	i
only	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
in	c
August	c
I	c
'm	c
going	c
to	c
attend	c
a	c
language	c
course	c
in	c
France	c
.	c

The	c
two	c
activities	c
I	c
have	c
chosen	c
are	c
basketball	c
and	c
tennis	c
.	c

This	c
report	c
shows	c
which	c
lessons	c
and	c
activities	c
are	c
better	i
to	c
be	i
filmed	i
in	c
order	c
to	c
make	c
a	c
short	c
video	c
about	c
daily	c
life	c
at	c
our	c
school	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
about	c
3	c
%	c
of	c
students	c
suggest	c
that	c
also	i
chemistry	i
lessons	i
should	i
be	c
filmed	c
,	c
because	c
they	c
often	c
take	c
place	c
in	c
the	c
laboratory	c
that	c
the	c
school	c
has	c
lately	i
built	c
;	c
in	c
fact	c
some	c
experiments	c
might	c
be	c
filmed	c
.	c

He	c
kept	c
forgetting	c

Unfortunately	c

Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c

But	c
he	c

How	c

you	c

I	c
hope	c
,	i
you	c
will	c
feel	c
better	c
when	c
you	c
finished	i
my	c
letter	c
.	c

Today	c
I	c
going	i
to	c
write	c
about	c
the	c
experience	c
of	c
helping	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
as	i
I	c
went	c
from	i
last	c
month	c
,	i
it	i
has	i
got	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
thing	i
to	c
talk	c
about	c
.	c

It	c
is	i
very	i
big	c
hall	c
including	i
the	i
sound	c
system	c
and	c
the	i
light	i
at	i
the	i
steat	i
.	c

They	c
are	i
very	c
cool	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
those	c
kinds	c
of	c
sports	c
and	c
think	c
that	c
I	c
could	c
be	c
the	c
winner	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
first	c
place	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
point	c
out	c
that	c
to	c
go	c
shopping	c
does	c
not	c
always	c
mean	c
to	c
buy	c
something	c
.	c

And	c
do	c
you	c
think	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
exchange	c
money	c
before	c
I	c
go	c
there	c

Because	c
the	i

repeated	i
many	i

I	c

It	c

I	c
saw	c
the	c

even	c

I	c
did	c
n't	c

what	c

2000	c

In	c
fact	c
everything	c
was	c
very	c
easy	c
,	c
the	c
instruments	c
were	c
already	c
clean	c
,	c
and	c
with	c
the	c
clothes	c
my	c
job	c
was	c
only	c
wait	i
there	c
and	c
give	c
them	c
what	c
they	c
asked	c
for	c
.	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
your	c
last	c
letter	c
.	c

However	c
this	i
year	c
was	c
n't	c
like	c
last	c
year	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
amazing	i
experience	c
.	c

What	c
I	c
particularly	c
liked	c
about	c
it	c
was	c
that	c
the	c
staff	c
was	c
like	c
a	c
big	c
family	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
organising	c
a	c
good	c
programme	c
for	c
us	c
.	c

The	c
show	c
include	i
the	c
latest	c
fashions	c
,	c
sports	i
wears	i
and	c
make	i
up	i
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
the	c
admittion	i
fee	c
is	c
free	c
for	c
students	c
.	c

It	c
would	i
be	i
come	c
true	c
in	c
the	c
near	c
future	c
.	c

They	c
can	c
clean	c
the	c
house	c
but	c
they	c
can	i
not	i
give	c
the	i
affection	c
to	c
the	c
family	c
.	c

And	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
try	c
golf	c
because	c
this	c
is	c
a	c
sport	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
practised	i
but	c
I	c
have	c
always	c
wanted	c
to	c
try	c
.	c

Many	c
people	c
leave	i
so	c
many	c
other	c
activities	c
for	c
the	c
pleasure	c
of	c
buying	c
as	c
many	c
things	c
as	c
they	c
can	c
afford	c
.	c

Nevertheless	c
the	c
worst	c
will	c
come	c
when	c
you	c
lose	c
the	c
youngest	c
member	c
of	c
your	c
family	c
and	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
spend	c
the	c
whole	c
day	c
looking	c
for	c
him/her	c
.	c

My	c
grand	i
father	i
used	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
when	c
he	c
was	c
a	c
student	c
.	c

After	c
he	c
has	i
got	i
a	c
job	c
,	c
he	c
became	c
busy	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
he	c
retired	c
his	i
job	c
last	c
year	c
so	c
he	c
has	c
had	c
his	c
own	c
time	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
the	c
hottest	c
place	c
in	c
England	c
.	c

I	c
ca	c
n't	c
explain	c
you	i
very	c
well	c
.	c

Dear	c
Helen	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
the	i
tends	i
because	c
I	c
'll	c
be	c
in	c

nature	c
and	c
I	c
could	c
listen	c
the	i
sounds	c
of	c
the	c
night	c
.	c

I	c
've	c
choosen	i
Photography	c
because	c
I	c
love	c
to	c
take	c
pictures	c
!	c

I	c
've	c
never	c
chose	i
any	c
classes	c
or	c

but	c
I	c
think	c
I	c
can	c
take	c
very	c
good	c
pictures	c

if	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
special	i

so	c
that	c
we	c

because	c
in	i

we	c

Dear	c
Mrs.	c

Swimming	c
is	c
my	c
best	i
way	c
of	c
excercise	i
and	c
keeping	c
fit	c

Thank	c
you	c

for	c
giving	c
me	c
good	i
news	c

As	c
you	c
can	c
see	c
,	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c

I	c
WAS	c
DISAPPOINTED	c
TO	c
FIND	c
OUT	c
THAT	c
THE	c
ACTOR	c
WAS	c
NOT	c
THE	c
ONE	c
YOU	c
WROTE	c
I	i
DISCOVERED	c
THIS	c
ONLY	c
WHEN	c
THE	c
PLAY	c
STARTED	c
,	c
AND	c
IT	i
WAS	c
VERY	c
LATE	c
!	c

SECONDLY	c
,	c
AS	c
I	c
WROTE	c
BEFORE	c
,	c
THE	c
PLAY	c
STARTED	c
LATE	c
,	c
AND	c
FOR	c
ME	c
IT	c
WAS	c
TERRIBLE	c
TO	c
WAIT	c
FORTY	i
FIVE	i
MINUTES	c
.	c

BECAUSE	c
FOR	c
ME	c
IT	c
WAS	c
NOT	c
A	c
"	c
PERFECT	c
EVENING	c
OUT	c
"	c
.	c

THIS	c
WAS	c
LIKE	c
AN	c
ILLNESS	c
FOR	c
HIM	c
.	c

HE	c
WANTED	c
TO	c
DIE	c
FOR	i
THIS	c
.	c

ONE	c
DAY	c
THE	i
FORTUNE	c
HELPED	c
OUR	c
POOR	c
PAT	c
.	c

Then	c
,	c
surfing	c
in	i
internet	i
is	c
becoming	c
my	c
passion	c
:	c
it	c
's	c
incredible	c
how	c
many	c
unthinkable	c
activities	c
you	c
can	c
do	c
with	c
it	c
.	c

On	i
your	c
advertisement	c
,	c
you	c
have	i
written	c
that	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
would	c
be	c
performing	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
noticed	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
watching	c
it	c
that	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
was	c
performing	c
.	c

I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
19:30	c
show	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
did	c
not	c
start	c
until	c
it	c
was	c
20:15	c
.	c

On	i
your	c
advertisment	i
,	c
it	c
said	c
that	c
discounts	c
were	c
available	c
for	c
the	c
tickets	c
.	c

She	c
showed	c
up	c
on	c
my	c
doorstep	c
just	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
having	c
one	c
of	c
my	c
worst	c
days	c
.	c

I	c
cried	c
for	c
days	c
straight	i
,	c
eating	c
and	c
sleeping	c
very	c
little	c
.	c

I	c
am	i
still	i
missing	i
Pat	c
,	c
but	c
my	c
pain	c
is	c
nearly	c
over	c
now	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
think	c
famous	c
people	c
,	c
no	c
matter	c
if	c
they	c
are	c
politicians	c
or	c
films	i
stars	c
do	i
n't	c
deserve	c
being	i
followed	c
by	c
journalists	c
every	c
time	c
they	c
are	c
trying	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
good	c
time	c
.	c

I	c
thing	i
that	c
journalit	i
's	i
only	c
aim	c
is	c
money	c
,	c
be	i
cause	i
they	c
know	c
that	c
if	c
they	c
publish	i
famous	c
people	c
's	c
private	c
life	i
they	c
would	i
earn	c
lot	i
's	i
of	c
money	c
selling	c
the	c
magazine	c
or	c
the	c
newspaper	c
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
no	c
matter	c
which	i
or	i
what	c
the	c
journalit	i
's	i
aims	c
are	c
,	c
famous	c
people	c
deserve	c
to	c
have	c
their	c
problems	c
,	c
their	c
affairs	c
,	c
their	c
private	c
life	i
just	c
as	c
normal	c
people	c
have	i
.	c

I	c
saw	c
your	c
advertisment	i
of	i
your	c
show	c
in	i
the	c
circle	c
theatre	c
,	c
over	c
the	c

Yours	c
Faithfully	c

The	c
police	c
caught	c
me	c
,	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
peacefully	c
in	c
my	c
room	c

and	c
put	c
me	c
covered	i
with	c

Dear	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c

I	c
must	c
tell	c
you	c
that	c
some	c
concert	c
halls	c
are	c
too	c
small	c
,	c
so	c
you	c
ca	c
n't	c
be	c
enough	i
confortable	i
to	c
apreciate	i
the	c

I	c
've	c
recently	c

all	c
the	c

were	c
given	c
to	c
us	c
,	c
like	i
you	c
know	c
,	c
the	i
first	c
day	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
I	c
'm	c
free	c
when	c
I	c
'm	c
out	c
of	c
the	i
school	c
.	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

I	c
received	c
your	c
letter	c
last	c
week	c
in	c
which	c
you	c
told	c
me	c
that	c
you	c
want	c
to	c
hear	c
about	c
my	c
experience	c
at	c
the	c
pop	c
concert	c
.	c

People	i
in	c
charge	c
of	c
security	c
did	c
n't	c
arrive	c
when	c
they	c
were	c
supposed	c
to	c
.	c

They	c
did	c
n't	c
want	c
to	c
play	c
until	c
the	c
room	i
were	i
crowded	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
can	c
see	c
,	c
hardly	c
anything	c
went	c
well	c
,	c
but	c
the	c
lights	c
and	c
the	c
sound	c
-	c
both	i
in	i
wich	i
I	c
helped	c
carrying	i
things	c
-	c
were	c
appropriate	c
for	c
the	c
concert	c
.	c

Fourthly	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
admit	c
that	c
a	c
big	c
advantage	c
was	c
your	c
idea	c
about	i
giving	c
one	c
reasonably-priced	c
weekend	c
ticket	c
for	c
all	c
events	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
'll	c
look	c
into	c
these	c
matters	c
and	c
improve	c
the	c
festival	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

Thirdly	c
if	i
you	c
are	c
good	i
looking	i
you	c
can	c
apply	c
for	c
a	c
job	c
in	c
restaurant	i
and	c
become	c
waiter	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
travel	i
on	i
July	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
going	c
to	c
finish	c
the	i
college	c
at	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
June	c
and	c
I	c
will	c
work	c
the	i
first	c
of	c
august	i
.	c

Also	c
,	c
I	c
choose	c
surfing	c
,	i
I	c
love	c
this	c
sport	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
last	c
letter	c
,	i
I	i
'm	i
really	c
envy	c
you	c
holiday	i
under	i
the	c
sun	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
I	c
will	c
go	c
back	c
the	i
next	c
year	c
.	c

Do	c
you	c
want	c
join	i
me	c
?	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

Well	c
,	c
as	c
you	c
see	c
it	i
was	c
n't	c
a	c
"	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
!	c
"	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
you	c
could	c
give	c
to	i
me	c
some	c
money	c
back	c
because	c
I	c
really	c
have	c
the	c
impression	c
that	c
your	c
advertisement	c
is	c
wrong	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
citizen	i
that	c
enjoyed	c
the	c
last	c
International	c
Arts	c
Festival	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

And	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
answer	c
for	i
your	c
question	c
.	c

Do	c
you	c
have	c
any	c
rules	c
at	c
school	c
that	c
make	c
you	c
upset	c
?	c

We	c
lived	i
in	i
my	c
aunt	c
's	c
house	c
who	i
was	c
in	c
the	c
center	i
of	c
the	c
village	c
.	c

My	c
aunt	c
told	c
me	c
it	c
was	c
the	i
famous	c
French	c
singer	c
's	c
house	c
.	c

I	c
went	c
near	c
the	c
house	c
and	c
waited	c
to	c
look	i
what	c
it	i
would	c
happen	c
.	c

During	c
my	c
visit	c
there	c
occurred	i
some	i
problems	i
,	i
that	c
made	c
my	c
evening	c
completely	c
disappointing	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
the	c
serious	c
problems	c
appeared	c
later	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
answer	c
"	c
yes	c
"	c
for	i
both	c
questions	c
.	c

Most	c
of	c
the	c
scientists	c
,	c
when	c
asked	c
about	c
the	c
Earth	c
in	c
a	c
hundred	c
years	c
claim	i
,	i
that	c
it	c
is	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
absolutely	c
scorching	c
here	c
then	c
.	c

I	c
suggest	c
to	i
do	i
a	c
couple	c
more	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

Answering	i
to	c
you	i
question	c
I	i
wo	i
n't	i
change	c
nothing	i
because	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
these	c
are	c
the	c
minimum	c
rules	c
that	c
a	c
theenager	i
have	i
to	c
have	c
to	c
be	c
responsable	i
in	c
a	i
future	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
mind	c
if	c
I	c
travel	c
during	c
the	c
first	c
fortnight	c
or	c
during	c
the	c
second	c
one	c
,	c
although	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
travelling	c
during	c
the	c
second	c
fortnight	c
,	c
if	c
it	c
is	c
possible	c
.	c

What	c
type	c
of	c
clothes	c
must	c
I	c
take	c
?	c

Must	c
I	c
take	c
cash	c
money	i
or	c
can	c
I	c
use	c
the	i
credit	c
cards	c
?	c

We	c
arrived	c
at	c
the	c
stadium	c
the	c
previous	i
evening	i
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
we	c
were	c
asked	c
to	c
clear	i
the	c
stadium	c
,	c
especially	c
the	c
seats	c
and	c
surroundings	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
incredible	c
!	c

When	c
she	c
finished	c
the	c
tests	i
,	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
meet	c
her	c
,	i
I	c
told	c
her	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
happy	c
for	i
staying	i
there	c
and	c
having	i
helped	c
at	c
the	c
concert	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
asked	c
her	c
an	i
authograph	i
.	c

Let	c
me	c
know	c
if	c
you	c
are	c
going	c
to	c
come	c
so	c
that	c
I	c
prepare	i
the	c
bedroom	c
to	c
put	c
you	c
up	c
.	i

It	c
will	i
make	c
us	c
so	c
happy	c
.	c

All	c
people	c
have	c
some	c
difficulties	c
about	i
their	c
job	i
but	c
some	c
of	i
them	i
have	c
more	c
than	c
the	i
others	c
.	c

I	c
know	c
,	i
they	c
are	c
not	c
like	c
us	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
be	c
very	c
pleased	c
if	c
you	c
answered	c
my	c
request	c
soon	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

Besides	c
this	c
little	c
thing	c
she	c
is	c
actually	c
perfect	c
.	c

Of	c
course	c
we	i
did	c
n't	c
wanted	i
to	c
go	c
there	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
just	c
a	c
"	c
cover	c
"	c
.	c

Pat	c
started	c
to	c
cry	c
and	c
told	c
about	i
everything	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Clark	c
,	c

Please	c
could	c
you	c
informy	i
what	i
do	i
you	c
meen	i
when	c
do	i
you	c
said	i
all	c
the	c
accommodotion	i
are	i
paid	c
for	c
,	i
that	i
is	i
including	c
foods	i
and	c
drinks	c
,	c
so	c
I	i
know	c
how	c
mutch	i
money	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
take	i
with	c
me	c
,	c
and	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
wather	i
it	i
's	i
during	c
this	c
period	c
of	c
the	c
year	c
so	c
I	i
know	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
.	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
found	c
the	c
idea	c
of	c
a	c
single	c
ticket	c
for	c
all	c
events	i
of	c
the	c
weekend	c
excellent	c
,	c
as	c
the	c
price	c
was	c
reasonable	c
and	c
access	c
to	c
a	c
wide	c
range	c
of	c
events	c
was	c
provided	c
.	c

This	c
month	c
has	c
been	c
full	c
of	c
exams	c
and	c
there	c
are	c
still	c
ones	i
coming	c
up	c
next	c
week	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
must	c
be	c
a	c
swot	c
as	c
you	c
see	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
asked	c
by	c
the	c
class	c
to	c
propose	i
you	i
another	i
visit	i
.	c

"	c
Famous	c
people	c
,	c
such	c
as	c
politicians	c
and	c
film	c
stars	c
,	c
deserve	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
private	c
life	c
without	c
journalists	c
following	c
them	c
all	c
the	c
time.	c
"	c

I	c
am	c
sure	c
that	c
nobody	c
would	c
like	c
this	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
we	i
shall	i
be	c
able	c
to	c
putoff	i
our	c
visit	c
at	i
the	c
science	c
museums	c
in	i
Thusday	i
morning	c
for	i
Wednesday	c
afternoon	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
found	c
that	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
there	c
had	c
been	c
problems	c
with	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
ovens	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
technology	c
has	c
also	c
brought	c
many	c
problems	c
to	c
Society	c
.	c

I	c
bought	c
a	c
ticket	c
at	c
the	c
box	c
office	c
but	c
there	c
were	c
not	c
any	c
discounts	c
for	c
student	i
like	c
you	c
said	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
show	c
and	c
also	c
the	c
show	c
had	i
to	c
start	c
at	c
19.30	c
but	c
on	c
that	c
day	c
it	c
delaied	i
about	c
45	c
minutes	c
.	c

There	c
are	i
Robert	c
Alan	c
and	c
Jack	c
Ruby	c
instead	c
of	c
them	c
.	c

She	c
told	c
me	c
Pat	c
had	c
phoned	c
her	c
while	c
we	c
were	c
going	i
and	c
my	c
mum	c
followed	c
us	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
so	c
dangerous	c
to	c
went	i
by	c
bicycle	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Ryan	c
,	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

As	c
requested	c
,	c
I	c
visited	c
some	c
classes	c
during	c
the	i
lesson	i
and	c
some	c
other	c
rooms	c
while	c
activities	c
were	c
taking	c
place	c
.	c

The	c
aim	c
of	c
this	c
report	c
is	c
make	i
a	c
series	c
of	c
suggestions	c
on	c
which	c
lessons	c
and	c
other	c
activities	c
should	c
be	c
filmed	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
on	i
July	c
;	c
that	c
is	c
for	c
me	c
the	c
only	c
possibility	c
because	c
I	c
will	c
finish	c
my	c
course	c
a	i
University	i
at	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
June	c
and	c
I	c
will	c
start	c
to	c
work	c
in	c
September	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
the	c
first	c
time	c
for	c
me	c
and	c
I	c
consider	c
this	c
experience	c
the	c
best	c
of	c
my	c
life	c
.	c

Concerning	c
the	c
accomodation	i
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
sleep	c
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
,	c
because	c
to	c
sleep	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
would	c
remind	c
me	c
of	c
the	c
bad	c
experience	c
I	c
had	c
in	c
Ireland	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
weather	c
...	c

Since	c
this	c
stay	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
is	c
a	c
good	c
occasion	i
to	c
discover	i
new	c
activities	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
sail	c
and	c
climb	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
beginner	c
in	i
both	c
activities	c
.	c

What	c
a	c
great	c
experience	c
that	c
was	c
!	c

Richard	c
Amelin	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Ryan	c

And	c
in	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
when	c
you	c
live	i
in	c
a	c
tent	c
,	c
you	c
have	i
more	i
from	i
the	i
nature	i
and	i
the	i
adventure	i
.	c

Lastly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
if	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
money	c
with	c
me	c
,	c
for	i
example	i
for	i
the	i
food	i
.	c

I	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
very	c
often	c
,	c
to	c
look	c
around	c
and	c
to	c
buy	c
some	c
new	c
clothes	c
.	c

All	c
my	c
class	i
mates	i
are	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
go	i
to	c
London	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
windy	c
spring	c
day	c
.	c

Their	c
hobies	i
were	c
listening	c
to	c
the	c
radio	c
,	c
reading	c
books	c
or	c
sitting	c
on	c
a	c
chair	c
without	c
doing	c
anything	c
.	c

Nearly	c
90	c
per	c
cent	c
of	c
people	c
know	c
how	c
to	c
use	c
a	c
computer	c
and	c
computers	c
are	c
used	c
in	c
every	c
section	i
of	c
our	c
lives	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
a	c
job	c
that	i
you	c
become	c
a	c
teacher	c
and	c
visit	c
your	c
student	c
at	c
his	c
or	c
her	c
house	c
.	c

Because	c
teaching	c
requires	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
knowledge	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
,	c

Anyway	c
,	c
we	c
were	c
to	i
go	i
shopping	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
afternoon	c
so	c
that	c
wo	c
n't	c
be	c
a	c
problem	c
to	c
my	c
mind	c
!	c

He	c
had	c
been	c
chained	c
and	c
no	c
way	c
could	c
he	c
escape	c
from	c
his	c
fate	c
without	c
some	c
help	c
!	c

I	c
tiptoed	c
as	c
far	c
as	c
the	c
house	c
,	c
carefully	c
opened	c
the	c
door	c
,	c
and	c
headed	c
to	c
George	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
some	c
suggestion	i
about	i
next	c
year	i
festival	c
,	c
and	c
if	c
it	c
is	c
possible	c
I	c
can	i
give	i
you	c
some	c
opinions	c
about	c
this	c
year	i
festival	c
.	c

They	c
want	c
too	c
much	c
forstudent	i
and	c
are	c
unkindly	i
for	i
them	c
.	c

The	c
other	c
activities	c
do	c
n't	c
appeal	c
me	i
much	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
'm	c
quite	c
good	c
at	c
Golf	i
.	c

We	c
bought	c
the	c
tickets	c
and	c
then	c
we	c
sit	i
down	c
to	c
rest	c
.	c

After	c
a	c
few	c
minutes	c
the	c
dream	c
happened	c
:	c
Kare	c
-	c
the	c
guitarrist	i
-	c
appeared	c
over	c
there	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
great	c
to	c
help	c
him	c

If	c
Danny	c
Brook	c

you	c

to	c

something	c

Dear	c
Manager	c
,	c

The	c
people	c
who	c
were	c
there	c
to	c
watch	c
the	c
show	c
were	c
very	c
ungry	i
and	c
they	c
were	c
shouting	c
because	c
they	c
were	i
waiting	i
for	i
too	c
long	c
,	i
And	c
I	c
absolutely	c
agree	i
with	c
them	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

But	c
although	c
she	c
was	c
acting	c
like	c
this	c
she	c
was	c
very	c
ungry	i
with	c
her	c
brother	c
Pat	c
,	c
because	c
he	c
did	c
n't	c
keep	c
the	c
secret	c
.	c

All	c
people	c
will	c
look	c
about	c
the	c
same	c
and	c
mostly	c
dark	c
colours	c
will	c
rule	c
around	i
.	c

It	c
is	c
always	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
to	c
enjoy	c
a	c
musical	c
when	c
you	c
go	c
on	c
your	i
holiday	c
to	c
London	c
.	c

A	c
century	c
ago	c
,	c
when	c
a	c
farmer	c
took	c
the	c
horses	c
out	c
of	c
the	c
stable	c
and	c
put	c
the	c
plouge	i
behind	c
them	c
,	c
we	i
've	i
got	i
the	c
word	c
"	c
time	c
"	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
as	c
I	c
had	c
read	c
the	c
advertisement	c
carefully	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
planned	c
to	c
invite	c
some	c
friends	c
to	c
have	c
dinner	c
at	c
the	c
theater	i
's	i
restaurant	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

Dear	c
Manager	c
,	c

Tecnology	i
improves	c
our	c
lives	c
,	c
we	c
have	c
tecnology	i
for	c
cook	i
,	c
for	c
work	c
,	c
for	c
study	c
,	c
well	c
hardly	i
for	c
everything	c
.	c

Tecnology	i
change	i
our	c
daily	c
life	c
,	c
it	c
makes	c
our	c
life	c
easily	i
to	c
live	c
and	c
of	c
courese	i
more	c
confortable	i
like	i
with	c
computers	c
,	c
televitions	i
,	c
radios	c
etcetera	i
and	c
some	i
times	i
more	i
secure	i
like	i
in	i
medicine	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
one	c
day	c
our	c
friendship	c
was	c
broken	c
down	i
.	c

I	c
entered	c
in	i
this	c
competition	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
always	c
wanted	c
to	c
do	c
these	i
kind	c
of	c
things	i
.	c

When	c
you	c
go	c
shopping	c
and	c
there	c
are	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
people	c
in	c
the	c
same	c
place	c
,	c
all	c
trying	c
to	c
find	c
the	c
best	c
prices	c
and	c
not	c
carying	i
about	c
anybody	c
,	c
this	c
could	c
get	i
crazy	i
to	i
anyone	i
.	c

But	c
my	c
advise	i
for	c
people	c
,	i
who	c
like	c
it	c
so	c
much	c
that	c
can	i
not	i
help	c
doing	c
it	c
,	i
is	c
to	c
try	c
shopping	c
in	c
the	c
afternoon	c
,	i
at	i
this	c
hour	i
no-one	c
do	i
shopping	c
and	c
if	c
there	c
are	c
some	c
shops	c
that	c
are	c
closed	c
you	c
can	c
always	c
go	c
to	c
a	c
shopping	c
mall	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

But	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
good	c
idea	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
break	c
during	c
the	c
shopping	c
,	i
you	i
wo	c
n't	c
feel	c
so	c
tired	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
,	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
the	c
only	c
month	c
that	c
I	c
am	c
free	c
.	c

Thirdly	c
,	c
from	c
the	c
activity	c
list	c
,	c
I	c
chose	c
swimming	c
and	c
tennis	c
as	c
my	c
favourite	c
ones	c
.	c

With	i
contrast	i
to	i
this	c
,	c
I	c
can	i
swim	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
six	c
.	c

Dear	c
sir	c
,	c

Write	c
back	c
soon	c

Neither	c
do	c
I.	c
In	c
particular	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
talk	c
about	c
Internet	i
.	c

In	c
fact	c
,	c
now	c
I	c
can	c
write	c
to	c
friends	c
who	c
live	c
in	c
foreign	c
countries	c
,	c
for	c
exemple	i
in	i
the	c
morning	c
and	c
receive	c
back	i
their	c
answer	c
in	c
the	c
evening	c
or	c
even	c
just	c
a	c
minute	c
after	c
writing	c
.	c

13th	c
JUNE	c
2000	c

Will	c
you	c
give	i
clothes	c
for	c
activities	i
?	c

Pat	c
told	c
him	c
our	c
idea	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
not	c
so	c
good	c
in	i
tennis	c
but	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
play	c
it	c
for	i
practise	i
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

I	c
think	c
the	c
people	c
who	c
are	i
enjoying	i
shopping	c
they	i
are	c
greede	i
for	c
materialistic	c
things	c
and	c
they	c
hav	i
n't	i
interests	i
for	i
spirit	i
(	c
?	c
)	c
,	c
intelect	i
life	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
a	c
wonderful	c
surprise	c
.	c

For	c
the	c
two	c
activities	c
I	c
can	c
choose	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
play	c
tennis	c
:	c
I	c
have	c
some	c
experience	c
in	i
this	c
sport	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
played	c
tennis	c
during	i
seven	c
years	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
still	c
my	c
favourite	c
activity	c
.	c

Do	c
you	c
know	c
last	i
week	c
I	c
have	i
been	i
to	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
to	c
help	c
my	c
uncle	c
,	c
who	c
is	c
the	c
director	c
of	c
the	c
stadium	c
of	c
Lugano	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
be	c
grateful	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
arrange	c
a	c
date	c
after	c
the	c
20th	c
of	c
July	c
,	c
due	c
to	c
the	i
problems	c
beyond	c
my	c
control	c
.	c

In	i
the	c
camp	c
I	c
can	c
practise	c
them	c
alot	i
.	c

I	c
was	c
wondering	c
if	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
bring	c
some	c
extra	c
money	c
and	c
thick	c
clothes	c
with	c
me	c
in	c
case	c
there	c
is	c
an	c
emergency	c
.	c

Couple	i
of	c
days	c
ago	c
I	c
bumped	c
into	c
my	c
best	c
friend	c
who	i
is	c
into	c
music	c
and	i
we	c
started	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
chat	c
about	c
what	c
we	c
had	c
both	c
been	c
doing	c
.	c

Can	c
you	c
believe	c
that	c
I	c
was	c
introduced	c
to	c
him	c
and	c
I	c
took	c
numerous	c
photographs	c
some	i
of	c
which	c
I	c
put	c
in	c
the	c
envelope	c
.	c

The	c
first	c
thing	c
that	c
happen	i
was	c
that	c
the	c
show	c
did	c
n't	c
start	c
on	c
time	c
.	c

We	c
both	c
have	i
£	c
15	c
tickets	c
.	c

When	c
were	c
nine	c
years	c
old	c
and	c
were	c
in	c
thired	i
grade	c
we	c
had	c
a	c
'	c
House	c
'	c
where	c
we	c
used	c
to	c
play	c
all	c
afternones	i
.	c

But	c
we	c
used	c
to	c
call	c
it	c
'	c
Our	c
House	c
'	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
secret	c
place	c
and	c
we	c
had	c
promissed	i
each	c
other	c
not	c
to	c
tell	c
anybody	c
about	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
a	c
musical	c
show	c
,	c
which	c
I	c
have	i
seen	i
in	c
your	c
theatre	c
,	i
in	c
London	c
during	c
my	c
holiday	c
.	c

For	c
unknown	c
for	i
me	i
reasons	c
,	c
I	c
found	c
the	c
restaurant	c
closed	c
(	c
there	c
was	c
no	c
information	c
telling	i
about	i
a	c
cause	i
of	i
closing	c
it	c
)	c
.	c

Neither	c
beautiful	i
surranding	i
near	c
your	c
theatre	c
nor	c
comfortable	i
sits	i
will	i
not	i
recompansate	i
my	i
horrible	c
evening	c
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
I	i
think	c
that	c
modern	c
technology	c
makes	c
our	c
life	c
easier	c
,	i
nevertheless	i
,	c
we	c
should	c
avoid	c
any	c
possible	c
risks	c
connected	c
with	c
these	c
improvements	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
if	c
you	c
have	c
some	c
vacancies	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
the	c
only	c
month	c
where	c
I	c
am	c
in	i
holidays	i
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
,	i
I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

But	c
there	c
were	c
many	i
things	c
which	c
went	c
wrong	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
waiting	c
for	c
a	c
satisfactory	c
answer	c

Children	c
play	c
wit	i
computer	i
instead	c
of	c
usuall	i
plays	i
.	c

We	c
are	c
eager	c
to	c
attend	c
National	i
Art	c
Gallery	c
and	c
Science	c
Museum	c
.	c

We	c
have	c
seen	c
an	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
and	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
this	c
exciting	c
show	c
.	c

We	c
sincerely	c
hope	c
that	c
you	c
will	c
consider	c
our	c
suggestion	c
.	c

We	c
tend	c
to	c
think	c
that	c
famous	c
people	c
,	c
such	c
as	c
politicians	c
and	c
film	c
stars	c
are	i
very	c
happy	c
and	c
satisfied	c
with	c
their	c
life	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
common	c
knowledge	c
,	i
that	c
such	c
an	i
attention	c
inevitably	c
tells	c
on	c
relationships	c
in	c
the	c
family	c
.	c

What	c
do	c
you	c
think	c
modles	i
will	c
wear	c
in	i
cat	i
walks	i
?	c

Nowaday	i
,	c
people	c
look	c
at	c
fashion-magesins	i
or	c
get	c
opinions	c
from	c
their	c
friends	c
to	i
decide	c
what	c
to	c
wear	c
in	i
different	c
occasions	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
this	c
letter	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
the	c
informations	i
you	c
need	c
and	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
one	c
or	c
two	c
questions	c
.	c

For	c
the	c
activities	c
,	c
I	c
chose	c
climbing	c
because	c
I	c
took	c
cours	i
during	i
2	c
weeks	c
last	c
year	c
and	c
now	c
I	c
have	c
a	c
good	c
level	c
,	i
for	i
the	c
other	c
one	c
I	c
chose	c
photography	c
but	c
I	c
am	c
not	c
a	c
proffesional	i
,	c
I	c
just	c
take	c
some	c
pictures	c
in	i
my	c
holiday	c
!	c

It	c
is	c
just	c
terrible	c
when	c
the	c
sellers	i
do	c
n't	c
treat	c
us	c
well	i
sometimes	i
we	c
just	c
give	c
up	c
and	c
never	c
come	c
back	c
to	c
that	c
store	c
.	c

Satomi	c
Fukao	c

One	c
of	c
them	c
is	c
that	i
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
suitable	i
on	c
this	c
camp	c
.	c

My	c
jobs	c
were	c
collecting	c
a	i
ticket	i
,	c
saling	i
goods	c
and	c
refreshment	i
,	c
guiding	c
people	c
to	c
a	i
right	c

and	c
cleaning	c
up	c
the	c
concert	c

after	c

a	i
concert	i

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
,	c

This	c
is	c
nothing	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
said	c
that	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
was	c
starring	c
.	c

And	c
also	c
it	c
should	c
be	i
started	c
at	c
19.30	c
,	c
as	c
I	c
saw	c
in	c
the	c
advirtisement	i
,	c
which	i
has	i
started	i
at	c
20.15	c
!	c

You	c
should	c
have	c
written	c
it	c
in	c
the	c
advirtisement	i
.	c

I	c
can	c
do	c
anything	c
I	c
want	c
such	i
as	c
buy	c
Cd	i
's	i
watch	i
film	i
or	c
even	c
buy	c
food	c
.	c

Internet	i
brought	i
a	c
new	c
way	i
to	c
my	c
live	i
since	c
I	c
started	c
to	c
use	c
it	c
.	c

Lots	c
of	c
thing	i
would	c
be	c
hard	c
and	c
boring	c
in	c
my	c
life	c
I	i
was	c
living	c
in	c
a	c
different	c
time	c
than	c
now	c
.	c

Technology	c
brought	i
simple	c
solutions	c
to	c
my	c
life	c
.	c

However	c
I	i
bought	c
the	c
ticket	c
even	i
it	i
was	c
more	i
expensive	i
because	i
I	c
'd	c
been	c
queuing	c
for	c
ages	c
and	c
I	c
really	c
wanted	c
to	c
see	c
my	c
favourite	i
idol	c
,	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
paper	c
planes	c
flew	c
out	c
of	c
the	c
window	c
and	c
hit	c
directly	i
to	i
the	c
headmaster	c
's	c
head	c
.	c

Waiting	c
for	c
you	i
replay	i
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

I	c
started	c
talking	i
with	i
my	c
parents	c
that	c
I	c
will	i
be	c
travelling	c
with	c
my	c
friends	c
through	c
West-Europe	i
for	c
one	c
month	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
think	c
,	i
this	c
was	c
a	c
good	c
lesson	c
for	c
me	c
and	c
I	c
lair	i
any	c
more	c
.	c

How	c
rude	c
!	c

If	c
more	c
and	c
more	c
ingenors	i
work	c
on	i
science	c
and	c
technology	c
,	c
it	c
must	c
be	c
that	i
it	c
is	c
really	c
usefull	i
:	c
but	c
in	c
what	c
particular	c
way	c
?	c

Of	c
course	c
this	c
is	c
just	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
lazy	c
,	c
I	c
actually	c
could	c
force	c
me	i
a	c
little	c
,	c
and	c
then	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
library	c
and	c
to	c
the	c
post-office	i
,	c
but	c
internet	i
just	c
makes	c
it	c
easier	c
!	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

I	c
was	c
n't	c
alone	c

I	c
worked	c
with	c
a	c

pity	i
because	c
I	c
expected	c
to	c
see	c
artists	c
from	c
France	c
and	c
Italy	c
.	c

The	c
International	c
Arts	c
Festival	c
was	c
organised	c
quite	c
well	c
.	c

Despite	c
we	i
are	i
actors	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
pay	c
a	i
full	i
ticket	c
because	c
the	c
discounts	c
you	c
promise	c
are	c
not	c
available	c
on	c
Sundays	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
really	c
disappointed	c
.	c

HOW	c
HAS	c
MODERN	c
TECHNOLOGY	c
CHANGED	c
YOUR	c
DAILY	c
LIFE	c
?	c

I	c
ca	c
n't	c
imagine	c
how	c
my	c
life	c
would	c
be	c
without	c
a	c
washing	c
machine	c
,	c
a	c
drier	c
or	c
a	c
fridge	c
.	c

But	c
,	c
on	i
my	i
opinion	i
,	c
the	c
best	c
thing	c
is	c
that	c
I	c
can	c
stay	c
at	c
home	c
or	c
going	i
on	c
holidays	i
,	c
and	c
send	c
my	c
work	c
to	c
the	c
office	c
everyday	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
because	c
I	c
used	c
to	c
go	c
camping	c
and	c
stay	c
in	c
the	i
tent	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
interested	c
in	c
tennis	c
but	c
I	c
am	c
not	c
so	c
good	c
tennis	i
player	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
about	c
clothes	c
and	c
the	i
money	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
your	c
answer	c
.	c

She	c
is	c
fond	c
of	c
the	c
actor	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
so	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
buy	c
two	c
tickets	c
,	c
provided	c
there	c
were	c
discounts	c
available	c
.	c

Finally	c
we	c
had	c
the	c
worst	c
evening	c
I	c
have	c
ever	c
imagined	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
definitely	c
not	c
the	c
"	c
perfect	c
evening	c
"	c
as	c
written	c
in	c
the	c
adverstiment	i
.	c

So	c
I	c
want	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
for	c
these	c
two	c
tickets	c
-	c
I	c
have	c
included	c
a	c
copy	c
-	i
and	c
I	c
hope	c
you	c
will	c
pay	c
more	c
attention	c
to	c
the	c
way	c
you	c
treat	c
your	c
customers	c
,	c
and	c
avoid	c
false	c
advertisement	i
.	c

It	c
maybe	c
because	c
they	c
are	c
more	c
likely	c
to	c
try	c
new	c
ways	c
of	c
clothes	i
.	c

I	c
guess	c
they	c
will	c
wear	c
a	c
sort	c
of	c
tunique	i
upon	i
a	c
shirt	c
and	c
a	c
skirt	c
,	c
or	c
more	c
male	i
clothes	c
because	c
they	c
want	c
to	c
change	c
.	c

However	c
he	i
did	c
not	c
act	c
,	c
and	c
his	c
sustitute	i
was	c
not	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
acting	c
.	c

Not	c
only	c
is	c
the	c
plot	c
interesting	c
but	c
also	c
it	c
catchs	i
your	c
attention	i
since	i
the	c
first	c
moment	c
.	c

How	c
has	c
modern	c
technology	c
changed	c
your	c
daily	c
life	c
.	i

One	i
of	c
the	c
greatest	c
technological	c
achievements	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
afraid	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
I	c
cannot	c
live	c
without	c
my	c
mobile	c
phone	c
.	c

The	c
trip	c
that	c
you	c
planned	i
for	c
us	c
,	i
students	c
,	i
it	i
's	i
a	c
great	c
chance	c
to	c
meet	c
new	c
people	c
and	c
visit	c
a	c
beautiful	c
city	c
like	i
London	i
.	c

If	c
the	c
famous	c
person	c
does	c
n't	c
mind	c
in	i
being	c
filmed	c
in	c
his	c
personal	c
life	c
there	c
's	c
no	c
problem	c
.	c

I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
musical	c
to	c
see	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
acting	c
and	c
singing	c
,	c
but	c
he	c
did	c
n't	c
appear	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
worried	c
because	c
if	c
my	c
parents	c
knew	c
that	c
I	c
had	c
failed	c
,	c
before	c
we	c
were	c
on	c
holidays	i
,	c
they	c
will	i
cancelled	i
the	c
trip	c
to	c
Africa	c
.	c

I	c
thought	c
it	c
was	c
worthwhile	c
to	c
have	c
spent	c
two	c
days	c
in	i
the	c
Arts	c
Festival	c
at	i
the	c
end	c
.	c

By	c
that	c
time	c
the	c
widow	c
could	c
not	c
walk	c
and	c
the	c
widower	c
could	c
not	c
see	c
.	c

When	c
the	c
widower	c
sensed	c
that	c
the	c
widow	c
badly	c
wanted	c
to	c
go	c
,	c
the	c
widow	c
clung	c
on	c
the	c
widower	c
's	c
back	c
and	c
set	c
off	c
telling	c
him	c
where	c
to	c
go	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
way	c
they	c
were	c
thirsty	c
so	c
when	c
they	c
looked	c
into	c
the	c
lake	c
,	c
they	c
saw	c
a	c
long	c
bar	c
of	c
gold	c
.	c

This	c
story	c
happened	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
ago	c
.	c

WHEN	c
THE	c
SHOW	c
WAS	c
FINISHED	c
,	c
WE	c
WANTED	c
TO	c
GO	c
TO	c
DINNER	c
,	c
AS	c
YOU	c
PUBLISHED	i
ON	i
THE	c
PROGRAMM	i
,	c
BUT	c
THE	c
RESTAURANT	c
WAS	c
CLOSED	c
BECAUSE	c
IT	c
WAS	c
ON	i
PUBLIC	i
WORKS	i
!	c
!	c
!	c

YOUR	c
ORGANISATION	c
WAS	c
A	c
GREAT	c
DISASTER	c
.	c

I	c
FEEL	c
YOU	c
LIE	i
ME	i
AND	c
YOUR	c
COMPANY	c
IS	c
NOT	c
SERIOUS	i
.	c

He	c
started	c
to	c
"	c
sell	c
"	c
the	i
secrets	i
of	i
Anna	i
to	c
all	c
the	c
boys	c
of	i
the	c
school	c
who	c
were	c
interested	c
in	c
her	c
.	c

Everyone	c
,	i
less	i
Anna	c
.	c

Another	c
example	c
is	c
that	c
earlier	i
we	c
had	c
to	c
rewrite	c
some	c
documents	c
by	c
hand	c
just	c
to	c
make	c
a	c
copy	c
.	c

The	c
show	c
is	c
established	i
on	c
Tuesday	c
March	c
14th	c
at	c
Central	i
Exhibition	c
Hall	c
London	i
from	i
10.00	c
to	c
19.00	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
the	i
benefit	c
for	i
themselves	c
and	c
the	c
public	c
.	c

Because	c
I	c
'm	c
supposed	c
to	c
attend	c
an	c
English	c
course	c
in	c
Weymouth	c
,	c
England	c
until	c
June	c
and	c
then	c
I	c
'm	c
going	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
Europe	c
with	c
my	c
sister	c
who	c
came	c
from	c
my	c
country	c
4	c
weeks	c
ago	c
for	c
this	c
trip	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
like	c
spend	c
my	c
energy	c
doing	c
sports	c
or	c
some	c
kinds	c
of	c
energetic	c
activity	c
.	c

Anyway	c
I	i
must	c
check	c
and	c
even	c
compare	c
the	c
prices	c
of	c
different	c
supermarkets	c
.	c

I	c
really	c
wanted	c
to	c
buy	c
it	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
afford	c
to	c
buy	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
refer	c
to	c
your	c
letter	c
in	c
which	c
you	c
informed	c
me	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
prise	i
in	c
the	c
competition	c
.	c

We	c
always	c
play	c
it	c
at	c
school	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
in	c
our	c
school-basketball-team	i
.	c

I	c
had	c
to	c
tell	c
one	c
of	c
them	c
,	i
that	c
she	c
had	c
to	c
leave	c
.	c

She	c
started	c
crying	c
.	c

Famous	c
people	c
have	c
always	c
been	c
the	c
center	i
of	c
interest	c
for	c
number	i
of	c
people	c
.	c

If	c
we	c
do	c
n't	c
want	c
to	c
be	c
in	c
the	c
newspapers	c
,	c
we	c
do	c
n't	c
do	i
politics	c
or	c
movies	i
!	c

On	i
your	i
program	i
of	i
Tuesday	c
is	c
very	c
interesting	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
because	c
we	c
will	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
learn	c
london	i
culture	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
agree	c
,	c
after	c
Science	i
Museum	c
,	c
we	c
can	c
have	c
lunch	c
at	c
restaurant	i
near	c
the	c
musuem	i
,	c
then	c
we	c
go	i
directly	c
from	c
the	c
restaurant	c
to	c
Central	i
Exhibition	c
Hall	c
.	c

Home	c
is	c
institution	i
that	c
create	i
human	i
and	c
make	i
them	c
as	i
a	i
person	i
and	c
a	i
good	c
member	i
in	i
their	c
communities	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

In	c
addition	c
,	c
there	i
should	c
not	c
too	i
hot	c
inside	c
during	c
July	c

It	c
must	i
be	c
nice	c
for	i
my	i

when	c
I	c

Shopping	i
is	i
concerned	i
that	i
people	i
exchange	i
from	i
money	i
to	i
their	i
demands	i
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
women	c
are	i
really	i
enjoying	i
shopping	c
.	c

They	c
are	c
always	c
waiting	c
for	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
after	i
women	c
finish	i
their	c
shopping	c
.	c

Therefore	c
,	c
they	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
use	c
"	c
e-shopping	c
"	c
which	i
is	c
getting	i
better	i
for	i
their	i
time	i
.	c

On	c
the	c
last	c
day	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
packing	c
and	c
getting	c
ready	c
to	c
leave	c
,	c
I	c
realised	c
I	c
had	c
lost	c
my	c
passport	c
and	c
tickets	c
.	c

Fashion	c
is	c
a	c
part	c
of	c
our	c
lives	c
,	c
even	c
for	c
those	c
who	c
will	c
never	c
reconize	i
it	c
.	c

Fifty	c
years	c
ago	c
people	c
even	i
did	i
n't	i
think	c
that	c
after	c
2000	c
years	c
they	c
would	c
have	c
another	c
life	c
.	c

I	c
mean	c
,	c
almost	c
everyone	c
has	i
now	i
a	c
car	c
,	c
a	c
computer	c
,	c
a	c
mobil	i
phone	c
and	c
even	c
an	c
airplane	c

To	c
summarize	c
,	c
the	c
modern	c
technologies	c
give	c
and	i
permit	i
you	c
may	i
things	c
wich	i
would	c
be	c
impossible	c
in	c
other	i
times	i

also	c
gives	i
you	i
many	c

TICKETS	i

Discounts	i
Available	i

But	c
,	c
Mark	c
,	c
Pat	c
and	c
I	c
were	c
planning	c
a	c
birthday-party	i
for	c
Sally	c
on	c
June	c
2	c
at	c
her	c
own	c
home	c
.	c

There	c
is	i
saw	c
the	c
advertisement	c
for	c
this	c
show	c
and	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
go	c
there	i
.	c

I	c
went	c
to	c
buy	c
the	c
tickets	c
but	c
when	c
I	c
paid	c
there	c
was	c
not	c
any	c
discount	c
avaible	i
.	c

Your	i
faithfully	c

I	c
had	c
also	c
told	c
Sally	c
my	c
secret	c
.	c

She	c
hit	c
me	c
and	c
I	c
decided	c
in	i
this	i
moment	i
that	c
I	c
never	i
should	i
speak	c
with	i
her	c
.	i

I	c
was	c
already	c
paralysed	c
,	c
and	c
that	c
would	c
n't	c
help	c
me	c
at	c
all	c
.	c

Those	c
minutes	c
,	i
up	c
in	c
the	c
air	c
,	c
feeling	c
the	c
wind	c
in	c
my	c
face	c
,	c
were	c
fantastic	c
....	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c

But	c
do	c
not	c
worry	c
about	c
the	c
price	c
because	c
your	c
cousin	c
will	c
love	c
it	c
!	c

Have	c
a	c
good	c
time	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

Moreover	c
,	c
they	c
will	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
create	c
a	c
special	c
climate	c
for	c
each	c
room	c
.	c

IN	c
THE	c
SAME	c
WAY	c
,	c
WE	c
CAN	c
TRAVEL	c
INSIDE	c
OUR	c
COUNTRY	c
QUICKLY	c
AND	c
SAFELY	c
.	c

Despite	c
this	c
the	c
ticket	c
vendors	c
explicitly	c
told	c
me	c
that	c
there	c
were	c
no	c
discounts	c
to	c
be	c
offered	i
.	c

I	c
was	c
further	c
humiliated	c
by	c
the	c
irony	c
of	c
the	c
advertisement	c
stating	i
that	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
my	c
'	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
'	c
,	c
when	c
it	c
was	c
totally	i
the	c
opposite	c
.	c

Another	c
significant	c
technological	c
developement	i
is	c
the	c
creation	i
of	c
electrical	c
appliances	c
.	c

And	c
the	i
other	c
one	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
painting	c
will	c
be	c
a	c
good	c
idea	c
;	c
Painting	i
is	c
one	c
of	c
my	c
hobbies	c
and	c
I	c
've	c
been	c
learning	i
it	c
since	c
I	c
was	c
5	c
years	c
old	c
and	c
now	c
I	c
'm	c
still	c
doing	c
it	c
once	i
I	c
have	c
free	i
time	c
.	c

I	c
only	c
put	c
the	c
speakers	c
in	c
the	c
right	c
places	c
,	c
or	c
helping	i
engieners	i
tested	i
the	c
lights	c
.	c

Comparing	c
these	c
too	i
realities	c
the	c
reader	c
can	c
notice	c
that	c
modern	c
technology	c
changed	i
very	i
much	i
our	i
daily	i
life	i

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c

The	c
other	c
activitie	i
is	c
Photography	c
,	i
I	c
am	c
not	c
an	c
expert	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
know	c
how	c
to	c
use	c
a	c
camera	c
,	i
all	i
I	c
want	c
is	c
to	c
improve	c
my	c
knowledge	c
.	c

Sara	c
Todi	c

There	c
were	c
about	c
a	c
hundred	c
people	c
that	c
wanted	c
to	c
help	c
,	c
but	c
only	c
two	c
would	c
be	c
chosen	c
.	c

All	c
I	c
could	c
think	c
was	c
"	c
Oh	c
my	c
god	c
,	c
I	c
'm	c
gonna	c
be	c
talking	c
and	i
helping	c
the	c
most	c
famous	c
pop	c
bands	c
!	c
"	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
exactly	c
how	c
I	c
felt	c
,	i
sometimes	i
I	c
wake	c
up	c
and	c
think	c
it	c
was	c
nothing	c
but	c
a	c
dream	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
that	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
forty	i
five	i
minutes	c
later	i
.	c

Her	c
mother	c
gave	c
a	i
book	c
about	i
how	i
to	i
become	i
a	i
spy	i
for	i
her	i
birthday	i
.	c

Obviously	c
the	c
man	c
realised	c
that	c
she	c
was	c
looking	c
for	c
him	c
and	c
said	c
that	c
she	c
was	c
really	c
crazy	c
!	c

As	c
a	c
result	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
an	c
important	c
position	c
in	c
our	c
local	c
basketball	c
team	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

That	i
was	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
of	i
Steps	c

M.E.N	i
Arena	c

I	c
could	c
n't	c
find	c
my	c
feet	c
at	c
first	c
as	c
I	c
was	c
so	c
nervous	c

In	i
the	i
other	i
word	i
,	c
I	c
can	c
also	c
receive	c
their	c

when	c
I	c
need	c
quick	i
reply	c

Could	c
you	c
tell	c
me	c
what	c
are	i
the	i
weather	i
conditions	i
in	i
California	i
at	c
that	c
time	c
of	c
year	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
know	c
what	c
clothes	c
to	c
take	c
.	c

Am	c
I	c
supposed	c
to	c
take	c
an	c
outfit	c
for	c
sports	c
as	c
well	c
?	c

Will	c
I	c
be	c
given	c
any	c
pocket-money	c
or	c
do	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
bring	c
my	c
own	c
money	c
to	c
cover	c
additional	c
expences	i
?	c

The	c
computer	c
class	c
can	i
be	c
also	c
there	c
,	c
because	c
program	i
and	c
internet	c
surfing	c
is	i
quite	c
interesting	c
.	c

By	c
the	c
way	c
,	c
what	c
really	c
upset	c
me	c
was	c
the	c
time	i
of	i
starting	i
.	c

The	c
major	i
characther	i
is	c
the	c
old	c
man	c
who	c
has	c
to	c
fight	c
against	c
the	c
sea	c
to	c
keep	i
alive	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
they	c
're	c
really	c
brothers	c
,	c
they	c
feel	c
the	c
same	c
pain	c
and	c
fear	c
during	c
the	c
battle	c
.	c

When	c
the	c
old	c
man	c
won	c
the	c
fight	c
he	c
felt	c
sorry	c
but	c
pleased	c
.	c

But	c
,	c
afterwards	c
,	c
the	i
life	c
's	c
rule	c
is	c
MORS	c
TUA	c
VITA	c
MEA	c
and	c
that	c
's	c
the	c
most	c
difficulty	i
to	i
face	c
to	i
.	c

I	c
choose	i
this	c
row	i
because	c
I	c
though	i
it	c
was	c
quicker	c
than	c
other	i
.	c

Although	i
there	i
were	i
finished	i
two	i
people	i
,	i
next	i
was	i
me	i
,	i
something	i
was	i
happened	i
.	c

It	c
is	c
also	c
expensive	c
and	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
afford	c
to	c
stay	c
there	c
too	c
long	c
.	c

I	c
have	i
been	i
very	c
surprised	c
winning	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
two	c
questions	c
.	c

The	c
third	c
thing	c
is	c
the	c
trouble	i
of	i
full	i
shops	i
.	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
:	c

your	i
sincerily	i

I	c
like	c
new	c
challenges	c
,	c
even	c
when	c
I	c
've	c
never	c
done	c
them	c
before	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
'm	c
really	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
gaining	c
this	c
new	c
kind	c
of	c
experience	c
.	c

Do	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
warm	c
clothes	c
?	c

Yours	c

Some	c
people	c
do	c
n't	c
like	c
doing	c
shopping	c
at	c
all	c
and	c
they	c
can	c
well	c
explain	c
to	c
everyone	c
why	c
it	c
is	c
n't	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

It	c
says	c
that	c
the	c
show	c
starts	c
at	c
14:30	c
and	c
19:30	c
but	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
which	c
was	c
45	c
minutes	c
late	c

Ring	c

Lun	c

I	c
can	c
play	c
games	c
,	c
listen	c
to	c
music	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
can	c
do	c
my	c
course	c
works	i
in	i
the	c
computer	c
.	c

This	c
was	c
the	c
only	c
reason	c
why	c
that	i
she	c
had	c
not	c
a	i
lot	c
of	c
friends	c
.	c

Sometimes	c
it	c
finished	c
like	i
this	i
that	i
the	c
others	c
only	c
said	i
:	c
"	c
Hello	c
,	c
how	c
are	c
you	c
?	c
"	c
and	i
then	c
went	i
away	c
without	c
listening	c
the	i
answer	c
.	c

On	c
top	c
of	c
that	c
,	c
the	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
for	c
renovations	i
!	c

She	c
was	c
taller	c
than	c
a	c
dwarf	c
and	c
as	c
thin	c
as	c
a	c
dying	c
tree	c
.	c

How	c
did	c
the	c
beast	c
knew	i
his	c
name	c
?	c

I	c
had	c
to	c
go	c
home	c
without	c
eating	c
a	i
dinner	c
,	c
though	c
I	c
was	c
really	c
hungry	c
.	c

When	c
we	c
were	c
15	c
years	c
old	c
we	c
decided	c
to	c
drive	c
with	i
my	c
mother	c
's	c
car	c
on	c
a	c
day	c
when	c
my	c
parents	c
were	c
absent	c
.	c

The	c
next	c
day	c
Pat	c
told	c
me	c
that	c
he	c
wanted	c
to	c
be	c
admired	c
by	c
some	c
girls	c
and	c
so	c
he	c
had	c
to	c
tell	c
them	c
our	c
secret	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
I	i
have	i
been	i
attracted	c
by	c
the	c
actors	c
-	c
Danny	c
Brooks	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
-	c
and	c
not	c
by	c
the	c
actors	c
who	c
played	i
effectly	i
that	c
evening	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
start	c
with	c
the	c
time	c
of	c
the	c
travelling	i
.	c

Please	c
contact	c

if	c
you	c

Communications	i
move	i
the	c
world	c
and	c
famous	c
people	c
use	c
them	i
to	c
improve	c
their	c
work	c
,	c
politicians	c
for	c
their	c
campain	i
and	c
film	c
stars	c
to	c
make	c
famous	i
their	i
last	i
movie	i
.	c

I	c
wish	c
that	c
I	c
could	c
describe	c
how	c
ecstatic	c
I	c
felt	c
when	c
I	c
found	c
that	i
I	c
won	c
the	c
competition	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
much	i
experience	c
in	i
swimming	c
and	c
have	c
represented	c
my	c
school	c
before	c
.	c

The	c
concert	c
was	c
held	c
at	i
our	c
school	c
hall	c
.	c

Several	c
other	c
students	c
helped	c
me	c
out	c
,	c
and	c
we	c
managed	c
to	c
make	c
some	c
eye-catching	c
advertisements	c
.	c

I	c
also	c
got	c
to	c
fix	i
new	c
speakers	c
so	c
that	c
the	c
music	c
could	c
be	c
heard	c
clearly	c
throughout	c
the	c
hall	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
a	c
tough	c
chore	c
!	c

When	c
a	i
bill	c
comes	c
to	c
£	c
1000	c
,	c
you	c
would	i
be	c
shocked	c
and	c
regret	c
what	c
you	c
had	i
done	c
.	c

And	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
pay	c
£	c
20	c
each	i
seat	c
.	c

But	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

And	c
he	c
did	c
not	c
want	c
our	c
mother	c
to	c
be	c
informed	c
.	c

She	c
suspected	c
our	c
father	c
to	i
want	i
to	c
please	c
himself	c
.	c

It	i
is	i
convenient	i
for	i
me	i
the	i
last	i
two	i
weeks	i
of	i
July	i
.	c

Also	c
we	c
got	i
to	c
face	c
a	c
long	c
queue	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
pay	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
return	c
to	c
my	c
University	c
in	c
the	c
middle	c
of	c
August	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
not	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
playing	c
tennis	c
,	c
so	c
could	c
you	c
tell	c
me	c
if	c
I	c
can	c
learn	c
at	c
the	c
camp	c
?	c

Finally	c
he	c
changed	c
his	c
ideas	c
and	c
started	c
to	c
work	c
for	c
the	c
blacks	c
using	c
his	c
skill	c
as	c
a	c
journalist	c
,	i
in	i
other	c
words	c
,	c
he	c
became	c
an	c
activist	c
for	c
the	c
black	c
people	c
of	c
South	c
Africa	c
.	c

The	c
day	c
of	c
the	c
concert	c
,	c
everyone	c
,	c
including	c
the	c
artists	c
and	c
managers	c
were	c
nervous	c
and	c
were	c
tired	c
,	i
however	i
,	c
when	c
the	c
concert	c
started	c
,	c
we	c
saw	c
that	c
all	c
our	c
efforts	c
were	i
worthy	i
,	i
the	i
crow	i
and	c
artists	c
thanked	c
the	c
staff	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
see	c
the	c
staff	c
,	c
managers	c
,	c
artists	c
and	c
even	c
the	c
director	c
,	c
all	c
like	i
a	c
big	c
team	c
,	c
working	c
together	c
.	c

However	c
the	i
man	c
who	c
took	c
his	c
place	c
made	i
a	c
good	c
performance	c
,	c
we	c
enjoy	i
listening	c
to	c
him	c
because	c
his	c
voice	c
was	c
amazing	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
you	c
did	c
not	c
apologise	c
as	i
if	c
it	c
was	c
usual	c
!	c

The	i
cars	i
are	c
really	c
useful	c
and	c
a	c
lot	c
more	i
faster	i
than	c
waking	i
or	c
cycling	c
.	c

But	c
cars	c
created	i
pollution	c
:	c
for	c
exemple	i
the	c
green	i
house	i
effect	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
surpprising	i
that	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
did	c
not	c
played	i
.	c

I	c
read	c
on	i
your	c
advertisment	i
in	c
Friday	c
's	c
edition	c
of	c
the	c
Times	c
that	c
the	c
show	c
should	c
start	c
at	c
19.30	c
but	c
the	c
representation	i
started	c
at	c
20.15	c
.	c

I	c
use	c
all	i
the	i
time	i
Internet	i
for	c
my	c
homework	c
and	c
in	c
the	c
futur	i
,	c
I	c
hope	c
,	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
use	c
it	c
for	c
my	c
own	c
work	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
I	c
will	c
help	c
them	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
sure	c
I	c
will	c
!	c

At	i
last	i
,	c
after	c
all	c
these	c
disadvantages	i
,	c
I	c
was	c
not	c
able	c
to	c
have	c
diner	i
in	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
,	c

When	c
musical	i
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
(	c
not	c
at	c
19:30	c
as	c
showed	i
)	c
I	c
was	c
realy	i
shokked	i
when	c
I	c
realised	c
that	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
was	c
playing	c
.	i

I	c
am	c
waiting	c
hearing	i
of	i
you	c
.	c

I	c
could	i
travel	c
only	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
my	c
exam	i
will	c
be	c
finished	c
in	i
the	c
beginning	c
of	c
that	c
month	c
and	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
great	c
if	c
I	c
could	c
set	c
off	c
my	i
journey	c
on	c
15th	c
July	c
.	c

This	c
is	c
quite	c
a	c
strong	c
opinion	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
know	i
it	c
from	c
my	c
real-life	c
experiences	c
of	c
shopping	c
.	c

Ireland	c
,	c
16	c
December	c
2000	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
idea	c
to	c
have	c
this	c
kind	c
of	c
festival	c
in	c
our	c
region	c
and	c
I	c
really	c
enjoyed	c
most	c
of	c
the	c
events	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
so	c
!	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
surprised	c
when	c
I	c
saw	c
them	c
in	c
your	c
country	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forword	i
hearing	i
from	c
you	c
.	c

Faithfuly	i
yours	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
because	c
I	c
like	c
very	i
much	i
the	i
nature	i
and	i
camping	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
better	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
than	c
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
.	c

Although	c
all	c
the	c
activities	c
that	c
you	c
mention	c
are	c
very	c
interesting	c
,	c
I	c
prefer	c
swimming	c
and	c
tennis	c
.	c

We	c
all	c
enjoy	i
it	c
.	c

This	c
presentation	c
will	c
show	c
the	c
latest	c
fashions	c
and	c
the	i
leisure	c
and	c
sports	c
wear	c
.	c

At	c
this	c
show	c
we	c
could	c
see	c
different	c
new	c
make	i
up	i
and	c
hairstyles	c
.	c

It	c
will	c
stay	i
in	c
the	c
Central	c
Exhibition	c
Hall	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

To	c
make	c
matters	c
worse	c
,	c
there	c
were	c
not	i
ticket	i
discounts	i
as	i
you	c
advertised	c
.	c

The	c
years	c
went	c
by	c
and	c
after	c
buying	c
a	c
newer	c
,	c
faster	c
and	c
better	c
PC	c
I	c
found	c
myself	c
writing	c
letters	c
,	c
doing	c
School	i
homework	c
and	c
evening	i
learning	c
with	c
my	c
Computer	c
.	c

You	c
'll	c
be	i
agree	c
with	c
me	c
that	c
45	c
minutes	c
to	i
waiting	i
for	c
the	c
starting	i
of	c
the	c
show	c
is	c
a	i
too	i
long	i
time	c
.	c

The	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
show	c
indicated	c
discounts	c
available	c
and	c
open	i
restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
in	i
this	i
way	i
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
how	i
to	c
do	c
.	c

MOREOVER	c
,	c
AFTER	c
THE	c
SHOW	c
,	c
I	c
HAD	i
INTENTION	i
TO	c
VISIT	c
YOUR	c
THEATRE	c
RESTAURANT	c
,	c
BUT	c
IT	c
WAS	c
CLOSED	c
AND	c
THERE	c
WAS	c
NO	c
EXPLANATION	c
FOR	c
THAT	c
.	c

Sometimes	c
it	c
is	c
necessary	c
and	c
sometimes	c
not	c
and	c
overall	c
it	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

From	c
the	c
list	c
of	c
activities	c
you	c
sent	c
me	c
,	c
I	c
stay	i
with	i
the	c
,	c
from	c
my	c
point	c
of	c
view	c
,	c
most	c
relaxing	c
activities	c
available	c
:	c
painting	c
and	c
photography	c
.	c

You	c
are	c
not	c
going	c
to	c
believe	c
what	c
I	c
am	c
about	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
!	c

A	c
couple	c
of	c
months	c
ago	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
told	c
that	c
Britney	c
Spears	c
was	c
coming	c
to	c
perform	c
in	c
our	c
city	c
.	c

I	c
found	i
my	c
reward	c
when	c
the	c
concert	c
finished	c
.	c

I	c
have	i
received	i
your	c
letter	c
this	c
morning	c
and	c
I	c
'm	c
very	c
happy	c
for	i
this	i
first	c
prize	c
.	c

I	c
recognise	i
that	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
sleep	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
but	c
in	i
this	c
moment	c
I	c
have	c
a	c
little	c
problem	c
with	c
my	c
right	c
leg	c
and	c
it	c
's	c
better	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
sleep	c
in	c
a	c
bed	c
.	c

The	i
weather	i
I	i
hope	i
will	c
be	c
good	c
so	c
I	c
suppose	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
bring	c
short	i
clothes	c
.	c

There	c
are	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
people	c
who	c
spend	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
money	c
because	c
they	c
like	c
shopping	c
.	c

I	c
'M	c

YOU	i

I	c

I	c
WENT	c
TO	c
THE	c
CIRCLE	c
THEATRE	c
AND	c
I	c
SAW	c
"	c
OVER	c
THE	c
RAINBOW	c

HE	i
HAD	i
BEEN	c
IN	c
A	c
PLAY	c

I	c
'M	c
LOOKING	c
FORWARD	c
TO	c
HEAR	i
FROM	c
YOU	c
IN	c
A	i
VERY	i
NEAR	i
FUTURE	i
.	c

AND	c
WHEN	c
SHE	c
KNEW	i
THAT	c
MARIA	c
WAS	c
GOING	c
OUT	c
WITH	c
TIM	c
(	c
A	c
CLASSMATE	c
)	c
,	c
SHE	c
TOLD	c

TO	i
EVERYONE	c
SHE	c
MET	c

MARIA	c
IS	c
STILL	c
GOING	c
OUT	c
WITH	c
TIM	c

Singing	c
is	c
good	c
for	c
my	c
emotion	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
a	c
beginner	c
in	i
swimming	c
and	c
also	c
in	i
singing	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
not	c
enjoyable	c
to	c
see	c
that	c
the	c
prize	i
for	i
food	c
are	i
going	c
more	i
and	i
more	i
higher	i

Also	c
I	c
will	c
buy	c
goods	i
which	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
need	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

For	i
the	c
fashion	c
of	c
the	c
future	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
depends	c
on	c
the	i
people	c
's	c
own	i
personalities	c
and	c
develope	i
their	c
own	c
styles	c
which	c
suits	i
them	c
the	c
most	c
.	c

As	c
different	c
kinds	c
of	c
farbics	i
will	i
be	i
invented	i
&	i
the	i
clothings	i
will	i
never	i
be	i
just	i
cotton	i
as	i
always	i
been	i
seen	i
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
although	c
we	c
had	c
booked	c
the	c
tickets	c
3	c
days	c
before	c
we	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
,	c
we	c
could	c
not	c
be	c
given	c
any	c
discounts	c
only	c
because	c
we	c
had	c
done	i
at	c
a	c
travel	c
agency	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

If	c
you	c
asked	c
the	c
young	c
people	c
what	c
they	c
spend	i
their	i
money	i
the	i
most	i
in	i
,	c
most	c
of	c
them	c
would	c
answer	c
'	c
clothes	c
'	c
.	c

Next	c
,	c
I	c
predict	c
about	i
patterns	i
of	i
clothes	i
.	c

I	c
think	c
fashion	c
changes	c
very	c
quickly	c
so	c
that	c
people	c
are	c
interested	c
in	c
those	c
changes	c
.	c

We	c
do	c
n't	c
need	c
to	c
pay	c
,	i
it	i
's	i
for	i
free	c
because	c
we	c
are	c
students	c
.	c

Hello	c

We	c
ca	c
n't	c
say	c
straight	i
away	i
how	c
the	i
people	c
's	c
homes	c
will	c
be	c
different	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
but	c
we	c
can	c
always	c
imagine	c
and	c
create	i
the	i
unbelievable	i
things	c
about	c
future	i
life	i
.	c

The	i
same	i
problem	i
will	i
be	i
with	i
homeless	i
people	i
who	i
does	i
n't	i
have	i
money	i
at	i
all	i
,	i
even	i
to	i
buy	i
a	i
food	i
for	i
themselves	i
.	c

Another	c
example	c
,	c
computers	c
,	c
every	c
six	c
months	c
,	i
something	c
better	c
is	c
discovered	i
.	c

That	c
was	c
disappointing	c
!	c

There	c
is	c
one	c
question	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
about	c
the	c
Camp	c
.	c

From	c
my	c
point	c
of	c
view	c
,	c
the	c
real	c
question	c
is	c
:	c
Who	c
said	c
that	c
is	c
enjoyable	c
?	c

I	c
know	c
that	c
this	c
sounds	c
horrible	c
,	c
but	c
sometimes	c
it	c
's	c
what	c
really	c
happens	c
.	c

Someone	c
could	c
be	c
injured	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
planned	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
great	c
dinner	c
with	c
my	c
family	c
in	c
your	c
restaurant	c
and	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
the	c
people	c
who	c
work	c
in	i
were	c
on	c
holidays	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
be	c
grateful	c
if	c
you	c
do	i
it	i
.	c

I	c
look	c
fordwad	i
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c

This	i
machines	c
are	c
connected	c
to	c
Internet	i
,	c
and	c
it	i
gives	c
to	i
my	c
family	c
too	c
much	c
facility	i
to	i
get	i
every	i
information	i
we	c
want	c
,	c
from	c
how	c
to	c
prepare	c
son	i
drink	c
to	c
what	c
was	c
the	c
result	c
of	c
the	i
Sunday	c
's	c
football	c
match	c
.	c

First	i
day	c
in	c
London	c
,	c
I	c
saw	c
your	c
advertisement	c
which	c
was	c
very	c
interesting	c
to	c
me	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
was	c
really	c
disappointed	c
it	i
.	c

Also	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
certain	c
to	i
me	c
to	i
bought	i
a	c
discount	c
tickets	i
cause	i
I	c
am	c
a	c
student	c
.	c

However	c
the	i
show	c
started	c
45	c
minutes	c
later	c
.	c

Moreover	c
the	i
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
with	c
the	c
word	c
"	c
Stuff	i
vacation	c
"	c
on	c
the	c
front	c
door	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
say	c
thanks	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
and	c
your	c
care	i
about	c
your	c
customers	c
.	c

And	c
what	c
you	i
have	c
.	i

Clark	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
always	c
loved	c
camping	c
.	c

I	c
took	c
some	c
lessons	c
and	c
after	c
that	c
I	c
have	i
really	i
improved	i
it	i
.	c

After	c
the	c
concert	c
I	i
was	c
absolutely	c
exhausted	c
but	c
the	c
thing	c
is	c
I	c
will	c
never	c
forget	c
this	c
experience	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
have	c
no	c
money	c
and	c
a	c
friend	c
ask	i
you	c
to	c
come	i
for	i
shopping	c
,	c
it	c
should	c
be	c
boring	c
!	c
and	i
you	c
become	i
jealous	c
against	i
him	c
and	c
want	c
him	c
to	c
do	c
that	i
quickly	c
!	c
or	i
you	c
are	i
going	i
to	i
get	c
nervous	i
!	c

But	c
how	c
can	i
it	i
be	i
,	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
!	c

Another	c
question	c
that	c
you	c
asked	c
me	c
was	c
about	c
two	c
activities	c
I	c
will	c
have	c
the	c
chance	c
to	c
do	c
there	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
something	c
about	c
money	c
and	c
clothes	c
.	c

I	c
suppose	c
you	c
know	c
about	c
"	i
Portugal	c
Pop	c
Concert	c
"	c
that	c
happened	c
here	c
in	c
Rio	c
de	c
Mouro	c
last	c
month	c
,	c
are	i
n't	i
you	c
?	c

I	c
'd	c
rather	c
sleep	c
in	c
tents	i
because	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
enjoy	c
this	c
wild	c
experience	c
!	c

Wait	c
for	c
a	c
sunny	c
day	c
,	c
take	c
a	c
look	c
into	i
your	c
wardrobe	c
,	c
some	c
money	c
,	c
ask	c
a	c
friend	c
to	c
go	c
with	c
you	c
,	c
and	c
enjoy	c
an	c
exciting	c
shopping	c
!	i

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
:	c

The	c
reason	c
of	i
my	c
option	i
for	i
singing	c
is	c
couse	i
I	c
feel	c
embarrest	i
about	c
my	c
voice	c
,	c
so	c
maybe	c
I	c
could	c
get	i
it	i
better	i
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

You	c
are	c
never	c
going	c
to	c
believe	c
what	c
I	c
did	c
last	c
month	c
I	i
was	c
walking	c
with	c
my	c
sister	c
in	c
Oxford	c
circus	c
,	c
when	c
sudently	i
a	c
man	c
stop	i
us	c
saying	c
that	c
he	c
was	c
looking	c
for	c
people	c
to	c
help	c
in	i
a	c
concert	c
and	c
they	c
was	i
going	c
to	c
pay	c
us	c
five	c
pounds	c
an	c
hour	c
.	c

Despite	c
the	c
bad	c
aspects	i
that	c
the	i
modern	c
technology	c
can	c
bring	c
,	c
in	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
if	c
the	c
governments	c
tryed	i
to	c
do	c
the	i
best	c
,	c
and	c
if	c
everybody	c
contribute	i
with	i
a	c
little	c
bit	c
,	c
we	c
can	i
solve	c
the	c
main	c
problems	c
and	c
only	c
take	c
advantage	c
of	c
the	c
benefits	c
to	c
our	c
lifes	i

I	c
am	c
very	c
pleased	c
that	c
I	c
born	i
under	i
such	c
good	c
tecnologies	i
like	i
my	c

did	c

Because	c
,	i
at	i

when	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
little	c
child	c
we	c
were	i
staying	i
every	i

I	c

I	c
enjoyed	c
helping	c
at	c
the	c
popconcert	i
,	c
but	c
it	c
's	c
very	c
stressful	c
work	c

The	c
most	i

were	c
that	c
we	c

He	c
's	c

and	c
very	c

Mr	c

I	c
ought	c
not	c
to	c
talk	c
about	c
the	c
restaurant	c

for	c
no	c

reasons	c

As	c

as	c
I	c

the	c

Hey	c
,	c
guess	c
what	c
:	c
I	c
gave	i
a	i
hand	i
to	i
a	c
friend	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
!	c

What	c
was	c
a	c
fella	i
like	c
that	c
doing	c
in	c
such	c
a	c
place	c
?	c

Even	c
though	c
they	c
performed	c
their	c
parts	c
excellently	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
disappointed	c
about	c
your	c
incorrect	c
advertisement	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
perfectly	i
terrible	c
evening	c
out	c
.	c

Interestingly	c
,	c
nowadays	c
,	c
I	c
live	c
in	c
the	c
scientific	c
world	c
which	c
I	c
read	c
in	i
the	c
book	i
.	c

However	c
,	c
nowadays	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
easy	c
to	c
find	c
me	c
because	c
of	c
mobile-phone	i
.	c

I	c
have	c
just	c
two	c
questions	c
.	c

Can	c
I	c
wash	c
any	c
clothes	c
there	c
?	c

I	c
felt	c
very	c
upset	c
about	c
you	i
advertisement	c
was	c
totaly	i
different	c
between	i
the	i
musical	c
show	c
.	c

To	c
be	c
honestly	i
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
you	c
could	i
return	i
the	c
money	c
back	i
to	c
me	c
.	c

She	c
told	c
to	i
Pat	c
about	c
what	c
had	c
happened	c
in	c
her	c
family	c
.	c

Pat	c
felt	c
very	c
sorry	c
about	c
that	c
was	i
too	c
late	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
to	c
be	c
sure	c
it	c
would	c
not	c
rain	c
during	c
the	c
trip	c
which	i
is	i
boring	i
?	c
!	c

.	c

It	c
is	c
nice	c
to	c
play	c
tennis	c
outside	c
in	i
the	c
court	c
when	c
the	c
weather	c
is	c
hot	c
.	c

But	c
you	c
ca	c
n't	c
play	c
if	c
there	c
is	c
too	c
much	c
wind	c
,	c
the	i
ball	c
becomes	c
incontrolable	i
!	c

Do	c
I	c
need	c
some	c
money	c
to	c
pay	c
the	i
meals	c
!	c

Which	c
is	c
the	c
best	c
article	i
to	c
take	i
?	c

It	c
looks	c
fragil	i
and	c
it	c
could	c
break	c
easily	c
.	c

My	c
life	c
is	c
a	c
little	c
bit	c
changed	c
after	c
that	c
concert	c
on	i
last	c
month	c
.	c

I	c
will	c
try	c
to	c
explain	c
you	i
why	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
good	c
experience	c
which	c
I	c
will	c
never	c
forget	c

I	c
hope	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
again	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c

I	c
had	i
10	c
years	c

About	c
the	c
acomodations	i
I	i
would	c
like	c
to	c

because	c
I	c
am	c
used	c
to	c
stay	i
in	c
it	i
when	c
I	c

I	c
decided	c
to	c
by	i
a	c
CD	i
room	i
driver	i
for	c
my	c
old	c

It	c
was	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
never	c

second	c
because	c
it	c
's	c
the	c
first	c
time	c
I	c
have	c
ever	c
won	c
something	c
.	c

For	c
my	c
stay	c
in	c
California	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
the	i
accommodation	i
in	i
tents	i
because	c
this	c
gives	c
me	c
a	c
feeling	c
of	c
freedom	c
and	c
adventure	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
quite	c
different	c
to	c
my	c
live	i
here	c
in	c
Greece	c
.	c

Very	c
often	c
you	c
can	c
hardly	c
move	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
crowds	c
of	c
people	c
.	c

That	c
is	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
reason	c
why	c
I	c
only	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
shopping	c
in	c
little	i
stores	c
,	c
where	c
I	c
have	c
peace	c
and	c
quiet	c
and	c
very	c
often	c
nothing	c
to	c
complaine	i
about	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
have	c
my	c
two	c
weeks	c
with	c
you	c
in	c
July	c
,	c
as	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
during	c
my	c
summer	c
holiday	i
in	i
addition	c
that	i
it	i
is	c
said	c
to	c
be	c
the	c
best	c
season	c
there	c
.	c

This	c
time	c
,	c
I	c
saw	c
him	c
in	c
person	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
this	c
show	c
,	c
and	c
to	c
ask	c
for	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

Pat	c
was	c
Ali	c
's	c
best	c
friend	c
,	c
and	c
because	c
of	c
that	c
,	c
Ali	c
told	c
her	c
that	c
she	c
was	c
going	c
out	c
with	c
Caroline	c
's	c
boyfriend	c
,	c
but	c
asked	c
her	c
to	c
keep	c
the	i
secret	c
.	c

Poor	c
Ali.	c
.	c

Ann	c
Kim	c
.	c

Because	c
it	c
does	i
not	c
complex	c
,	c
also	i
we	i
do	i
n't	i
confuse	i
.	c

My	c
school	c
's	c
rules	c
are	c
n't	c
strict	c
.	c

Many	c
of	c
my	c
friends	c
have	c
this	c
rule	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
,	c

She	c
was	c
so	c
understanding	c
.	c

My	i
last	c
holiday	c
in	c
tend	i
I	c
had	c
very	i
bad	c
experience	c
,	c
the	c
mosquitos	i
nearly	c
killed	c
me	c
.	c

With	c
reference	c
to	c
the	c
activities	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
been	c
climbing	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
log	c
cabins	c
because	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
sleep	c
outside	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
.	c

I	c
know	c
how	c
to	c
swim	c
and	c
dive	c
from	c
high	c
places	c
.	c

You	c
know	c
that	c
last	c
month	c
I	c
helped	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
and	c
I	i
've	i
enjoyed	i
it	c
very	c
much	c
.	c

There	c
will	c
be	c
The	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
in	c
Central	c
Exhibition	c
Hall	c
on	c
the	c
14th	c
of	c
March	c
.	c

Besides	c
,	c
students	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
to	c
pay	c
entrance	i
fee	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
free	c
for	c
students	c
.	c

The	c
fashion	c
show	c
is	c
only	c
on	c
the	c
14th	c
of	c
March	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
would	c
be	c
grateful	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
allow	c
all	c
of	c
my	c
classmates	c
to	c
go	c
there	c
after	c
visiting	c
Science	i
Museum	c
instead	c
of	c
going	c
shopping	c
.	c

Many	c
people	c
think	c
that	c
it	c
is	c
natural	c
for	c
famous	c
people	c
to	c
be	c
followed	c
by	c
journalists	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
because	c
they	c
are	c
famous	c
and	c
everybody	c
is	c
curious	c
about	c
their	c
life	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr.	c
Robertson	c
,	c

How	c
wonderful	c
it	c
could	c
be	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
latest	c
fashions	c
and	c
leisure	c
and	c
sports	c
wear	c
in	c
this	c
city	c
,	c
so	c
famous	c
for	c
it	i
!	c

Besides	c
,	c
as	c
there	c
are	c
more	c
girls	c
than	c
boys	c
in	c
the	c
class	c
,	c
they	c
would	c
certainly	c
enjoy	c
attending	c
on	i
live	i
make-up	i
and	i
hairstyles	i
.	c

The	c
more	c
they	c
are	c
in	c
the	c
media	c
,	c
the	c
more	c
they	i
will	i
be	i
famous	i
.	c

School	c
supose	i
to	c
be	c
our	c
second	c
home	c
but	c
it	c
's	c
not	c
we	i
work	c
hard	c
and	c
for	i
the	c
end	c
our	i
education	c
we	c
still	c
have	c
nothing	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
to	c
hear	c
back	i
from	c
you	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
feel	c
sad	c
if	c
I	c
did	i
n't	i
go	i
there	c
.	c

From	i
that	i
time	i
I	i
had	i
a	i
lot	i
of	i
friends	i
also	c
some	c
of	c
them	c
are	i
old	c
friends	c
from	c
college	c
.	c

That	c
's	c
why	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
write	c
you	i
.	c

I	c
waited	c
45	c
minutes	c
more	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
play	c
.	c

There	c
was	c
no	c
notice	c
about	c
it	c
in	c
your	c
advertisement	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
have	c
at	c
least	c
some	c
of	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c
.	c

She	c
did	c
not	c
trust	c
the	c
boy	c
,	c
and	c
it	c
was	c
very	c
hard	c
for	c
her	c
to	c
lie	c
to	c
people	c
,	i
that	c
she	c
liked	c
so	c
much	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
I	c
did	c
not	c
have	c
the	c
"	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
"	c
as	c
stated	c
in	c
your	c
advertisement	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hear	i
from	c
you	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
it	c
seems	c
to	c
me	c
that	c
,	i
the	c
clothes	c
of	c
tomorrow	c
will	c
be	c
quite	c
naturalist	i
and	c
minimalist	c
and	c
also	c
,	c
the	c
fabrics	c
that	c
are	c
used	c
will	c
change	c
too	c
.	c

Dear	c
Ms.	c
Ryan	c

Actually	c
,	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
like	c
tent	i
so	c
much	c
.	c

I	c
love	c
shopping	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
many	c
people	c
,	c
specially	i
women	c
,	c
had	i
same	i
experience	c
.	c

The	c
reason	c
is	c
that	c
my	c
academic	c
year	c
starts	c
in	c
August	c
therefor	i
I	c
need	c
to	c
be	c
here	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
rather	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
,	i
there	i
's	i
no	c
further	c
reason	c
is	i
just	i
that	c
would	i
be	c
a	c
new	c
experience	c
for	c
me	c
and	c
I	c
'm	c
very	c
excited	c
about	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
keen	c
on	c
photography	c
so	c
I	c
definetely	i
will	c
choose	c
this	c
as	c
one	c
of	c
my	c
activities	c
during	i
the	c
camp	c
.	c

Finally	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
some	c
questions	c
,	c
there	i
are	c
mainly	c
small	i
details	c
.	c

What	c
I	c
really	c
enjoyed	c
was	c
been	i
part	c
of	c
the	c
staff	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
your	c
response	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

Every	c
night	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
come	i
out	c
of	c
the	c
small	c
tent	c
to	i
the	c
nice	c
enviroment	i
outside	c
the	c
tent	c
.	c

I	c
was	i
really	c
enjoy	i
at	i
the	c
concert	c
.	c

I	c
really	c
want	c
to	c
have	c
that	c
experience	c
again	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
just	c
received	c
your	c
letter	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
happy	c
about	c
this	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
am	c
at	c
Camp	c
,	c
I	c
will	c
choose	c
singing	c
and	c
photography	c
I	i
can	c
sing	c
classic	i
music	c
and	c
pop	c
music	c
,	c
seem	i
like	c
rock	c
&	c
roll	c
.	c

And	c
I	c
can	c
also	i
make	i
very	c
good	i
photography	i
,	c
because	c
I	c
learned	i
this	c
in	c
China	c
two	c
years	c
ago	c
.	c

Another	c
thing	c
is	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
some	c
questions	c
about	c
journey	i
,	i
What	c
's	c
the	c
weather	c
like	c
?	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
,	c

But	c
now	c
I	c
am	c
thinking	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
waste	c
of	c
time	c
.	c

Of	c
course	c
I	c
accepted	c
immidiately	i
.	c

She	c
was	i
about	i
to	i
cry	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
closed	c
my	c
bedroom	i
's	i
door	c
I	c
burst	c
into	c
tears	c
.	c

That	c
showed	c
me	c
not	c
to	c
trust	c
anyone	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
very	c
difficult	c
to	c
change	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
understand	c
why	c
they	i
was	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
people	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
20	c
years	c
ago	c
we	i
were	i
friends	c
since	c
10	i
.	c

It	c
took	c
us	c
two	c
weeks	c
to	c
modify	c
the	c
results	c
in	c
a	c
very	c
complex	c
operation	c
in	c
which	c
we	c
should	c
take	c
care	c
of	c
hiding	i
all	c
our	c
fingerprints	c
.	c

I	c
can	c
imagine	c
,	i
how	c
annoying	c
it	c
can	c
be	c
sometimes	c
.	c

But	c
on	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
mention	c
that	c
they	c
are	i
going	i
too	c
far	c
sometimes	c
to	c
take	i
a	c
picture	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
go	i
to	c
Camp	c
California	c
in	c
the	c
USA	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
further	c
information	c
.	c

About	c
accommodation	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
tents	i
because	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
a	c
new	c
experience	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

Then	c
,	c
even	c
if	c
we	c
could	c
enter	c
in	i
the	c
room	i
,	c
the	c
show	c
did	c
n't	c
start	c
before	c
20:15	c
,	c
which	c
is	c
45	c
minutes	c
later	c
than	c
expects	i
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

i	i
'd	i
prefer	c
take	i
a	c
tent	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
more	c
romantic	c
and	c
exciting	c
spend	i
nights	c
in	c
the	i
tent	c
.	c

Because	c
i	i
think	c
it	c
is	c
teenagers	i
game	c
.	c

yours	i
sencerely	i
Gubin	c
.	c

Because	c
i	i
have	c
my	c
own	c
expirience	i
of	c
shopping	c
.	c

What	i
concerns	i
activities	c
at	c
the	c
camp	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
be	c
highly	c
delighted	c
if	c
I	c
could	c
play	c
basketball	c
and	c
tennis	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
a	c
little	c
unsure	c
about	c
some	c
things	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
be	c
very	c
grateful	c
to	c
you	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
answer	c
my	c
questions	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Therefore	c
,	c
to	c
show	c
the	c
good	c
aspects	c
,	c
I	c
suggest	c
to	i
film	i
Mr.	c
Clark	c
's	c
English	c
classes	c
,	c
because	c
they	c
are	c
highly	c
educative	i
and	c
because	c
the	c
students	c
participate	c
a	c
lot	c
.	c

Interesting	c
activities	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
keen	c
at	i
sports	c
.	c

I	c
did	c
n't	c
tell	c
you	c
about	c
my	c
last	c
job	c
,	i
you	i
remember	c
last	c
moth	i
I	i
've	i
helped	i
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
.	c

Did	i
you	c
remember	c
the	c
computer	c
curse	i
that	c
we	c
took	c
together	i
it	i
was	c
very	c
useful	c
to	c
clasifay	i
each	c
person	c
in	i
the	c
concert	c
.	c

For	c
next	c
year	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
you	c
should	c
take	c
this	c
matter	c
into	c
consideration	c
,	i
And	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
much	c
better	c
if	c
you	c
had	c
more	c
plays	c
and	c
films	c
.	c

A	c
Japanese	c
folk	c
story	c
"	i
a	i
bamboo	i
princess	i
"	c

When	c
they	c
asked	c
her	c
,	i
she	c
said	c
"	i
I	c
am	c
from	c
the	c
moon	c
and	c
I	c
will	c
have	c
to	c
go	c
back	c
soon	c
"	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
will	c
give	c
you	c
with	c
pleasure	c
some	c
information	c
about	c
myself	c
you	c
need	c
to	c
have	c
.	c

Especially	i
,	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
support	i
to	c
do	i
shopping	c
with	c
my	c
mother	c
:	c
it	c
takes	c
so	c
much	c
time	c
that	c
later	c
I	c
regret	c
of	i
agreeing	c
to	c
go	c
with	c
.	i

I	c
think	c
that	c
's	c
a	c
great	c
idea	c
.	i

It	c
's	c
excellent	c
.	c

You	c
continuously	c
must	c
study	c
hard	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
"	i
Over	c
The	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
I	i
saw	c
in	c
your	c
theatre	c
last	c
week	c
.	c

So	c
how	c
has	c
the	i
modern	c
technology	c
changed	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
?	c

I	c
am	i
very	i
delighted	c
to	c
visit	c
the	i
two	c
weeks	c
Camp	c
California	c
in	c
the	c
U.S.A.	c
.	c

This	c
would	c
be	c
an	c
ideal	c
opportunity	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
visit	c
the	c
United	c
States	c
to	c
learn	c
the	i
American	c
way	c
of	c
life	c
.	c

Yuna	c
ARNISTON	c

That	c
does	c
n't	c
cost	c
much	c
.	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

A	c
lot	c
of	c
people	c
could	c
visit	c
as	c
many	c
events	c
as	c
the	i
they	c
could	i
.	c

I	c
like	c
going	c
to	c
classical	c
concerts	c
but	c
at	c
this	c
festival	c
the	c
sounds	i
of	c
music	i
were	i
terrible	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
really	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
tents	i
because	c
I	c
love	c
sleeping	c
outdoors	c
and	c
listening	c
noises	i
from	c
outside	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
promised	c
that	c
after	c
show	i
I	c
could	c
go	c
to	c
theatre	i
restaurant	c
but	c
due	c
to	c
started	i
late	c
we	i
aslo	i
finished	c
late	c
therefore	i
,	c
when	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
restaurant	c
they	c
were	c
deffinately	i
closed	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
you	c
to	c
give	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c
.	c

We	c
were	c
stedy	i
at	i
the	c
same	c
class	c
at	c
school	c
and	c
he	c
also	c
knowed	i
Pat	c
as	c
well	c
.	c

Personally	c
,	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
keep	c
serets	i
because	c
I	c
afraid	i
that	c
we	c
might	c
have	i
splited	i
up	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
beginner	c
in	i
photography	c
skills	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
a	c
very	c
common	c
fact	i
these	c
days	c
and	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
be	c
patient	c
if	c
you	c
really	c
want	c
to	c
buy	c
something	c
.	c

Anni	c
Soler	c

I	c
had	c
a	c
great	c
time	c
that	c
day	c
.	c

Love	c
,	c

Concerning	c
the	c
two	c
activities	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
choose	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
swim	c
and	c
play	c
tennis	c
(	c
I	c
have	c
a	c
good	c
level	c
in	i
each	c
sports	i
)	c
.	c

Besides	c
it	c
gives	i
all	c
the	c
areas	c
covered	c
by	c
a	c
mecanic	i
ingenier	i
and	c
it	c
is	c
very	c
important	c
in	c
a	c
school	c
where	c
you	c
will	c
probably	c
become	c
a	c
mecanic	i
ingenier	i
It	i
lets	c
us	c
specify	i
our	c
abilities	c
in	i
the	c
part	c
of	c
mecanics	i
that	c
we	c
prefer	c
.	c

But	c
there	c
are	c
other	c
lessons	i
very	i
important	i
(	c
like	c
English	c
of	c
course	c
!	c
)	c

I	c
expect	c
that	c
these	c
two	c
weeks	c
will	c
be	c
as	i
a	c
big	c
rest	c
.	c

Third	c
,	c
you	c
need	c
to	c
know	c
which	c
sport	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
to	i
practise	i
.	c

Our	c
engineer	i
school	c
is	c
specealized	i
in	c
mecanics	i
and	c
thermodynamics	c
.	c

I	c
wonder	c
if	c
we	c
could	c
not	c
feet	i
between	i
some	i
short	i
view	i
of	c
the	c
laboratories	c
,	c
in	c
which	c
we	c
could	c
show	c
student	i
making	i
experimentations	i
.	c

In	c
order	c
to	c
strike	i
people	c
who	c
will	c
watch	c
the	c
film	c
,	c
we	c
could	c
record	i
student	i
drawing	c
on	c
the	c
big	c
drawing	c
tables	c
.	c

We	c
are	c
really	c
excited	c
about	c
it	c
.	c

Finaly	i
the	c
show	c
started	c
and	c
to	c
my	c
sorprise	i
my	c
favourite	c
actor	c
Danny	c
Brooke	c
had	c
been	c
replaced	c
by	c
another	c

would	c
be	i
the	c

Many	c
people	c
enjoy	c
going	c
shoppings	i
meeting	i
friends	c
and	c
mainly	c
spending	c
their	c
money	c
,	c
but	c
sometimes	c
shopping	c
can	c
be	c
a	c
terrible	c
experience	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
when	c
the	c
shops	c
are	c
crowded	c
(	c
for	c
instance	c
,	c
just	c
before	c
Christmas	c
)	c
,	c
going	c
shopping	c
can	c
be	c
very	c
stressful	c
,	c
as	c
you	c
cannot	c
walk	c
freely	i
and	c
have	c
to	c
bear	i
endless	c
queues	c
.	c

As	c
if	c
these	i
were	c
not	c
enough	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
always	c
impolite	c
assistants	c
,	c
who	c
make	c
your	c
day	c
even	c
worse	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
this	c
letter	c
to	c
express	i
the	c
reasons	c
of	i
our	c
disappointment	c
about	i
that	c
evening	c
.	c

Two	c
days	c
before	c
the	c
event	c
Carol	c
,	c
Albert	c
,	c
Sam	c
and	c
me	c
went	c
to	c
visit	c
Pat	c
in	c
her	c
house	c
and	c
she	c
invited	c
us	c
to	c
stay	c
for	c
dinner	c
.	c

We	c
were	c
a	c
bit	c
disappointed	c
but	c
we	c
enjoyed	c
anyway	i
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
,	c

We	c
have	c
been	c
very	c
excited	c
about	c
this	c
and	c
coincidentely	i
we	c
have	c
found	c
another	c
option	c
to	c
add	c
in	i
our	c
programme	c
,	c
certainly	c
if	c
your	i
agree	c
with	c
.	i

This	c
sad	c
and	c
unlucky	c
day	c
was	c
on	c
Friday	c
1998	c
,	c
it	i
was	c
n't	c
13th	c
even	c
it	c
look	c
liked	i
,	i
but	c
it	c
was	c
my	c
25th	c
birthday	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
at	c
home	c
making	i
me	i
up	i
before	c
to	i
go	i
to	c
a	c
restaurant	c
with	c
my	c
friends	c
and	c
,	c
sudenlly	i
,	c
he	c
rang	c
the	c
bell	c
,	i
he	i
was	c
so	c
nervous	i
with	c
a	c
gun	c
in	c
his	c
hands	c
and	c
no	i
longer	i
I	i
could	i
speak	i
he	c
took	c
me	c
out	c
with	c
him	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
tried	c
to	c
think	c
in	i
stopping	c
him	c
,	c
but	c
he	c
was	c
stronger	c
than	c
me	c
and	c
he	c
had	c
used	c
all	c
his	c
power	c
to	c
scared	i
me	c
and	c
he	c
forced	c
me	c
to	c
buy	c
cocain	i
using	c
my	c
cheques	c
.	c

If	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
do	c
it	c
,	c
I	c
knew	c
I	c
would	c
die	c
,	i
my	i
option	c
was	c
my	c
life	c
,	c
but	c
now	c
I	c
have	c
n't	c
any	i
chance	c
to	c
live	c
because	c
I	c
'm	c
in	c
the	i
prison	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
make	c
some	c
complaints	c
about	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
,	c
wich	i
you	c
are	c
the	c
manager	c
.	c

The	c
fourth	c
problem	c
concerned	c
the	c
Theatre	c
Restaurant	c
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
the	c
addvertisement	i
promised	c
this	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
for	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

I	c
asked	c
Pat	c
not	c
to	c
tell	c
anyone	c
,	c
and	c
she	c
promised	c
me	c
she	c
would	c
n't	c
.	c

In	c
spite	c
of	c
the	c
fact	c
that	c
I	c
told	c
her	c
to	c
keep	c
it	c
as	i
a	c
secret	c
,	c
she	c
went	c
to	c
my	c
cousin	c
's	c
house	c
and	c
made	i
the	i
retelling	i
of	i
what	i
I	i
had	i
exactly	i
told	c
her	c
.	c

As	c
I	c
solved	i
the	c
trouble	i
with	c
my	c
cousin	c
,	c
I	c
understood	c
why	c
my	c
mother	c
had	c
told	c
me	c
that	c
'	c
friends	c
'	c
sometimes	c
were	c
n't	c
as	i
you	c
expected	c
them	c
to	c
be	c

DANNY	c
BROOK	c
is	c
one	c
of	c
my	c
favorite	i
actor	i
so	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
buy	c
a	c
ticket	c
even	i
if	i
I	c
cancel	i
my	c
apointment	i
on	c
that	c
day	c
at	c
18=30	i
and	c
aslo	i
notice	i
of	i

Bank	i
robbers	c
said	i
him	c
if	c
Pat	c
told	c
the	i
fact	i
somebody	i
they	c
killed	i
him	c
.	c

Although	c
bank	i
robbers	c
complained	c
to	c
Pat	c
,	c
he	c
said	i
nothing	i
to	i
anybody	i

Mr.	c
Hemingway	c
.	c

Best	c
regards	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
disappointed	c
with	c
the	c
performance	c
and	c
apart	c
from	c
that	c
there	c
were	c
many	c
problems	i
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
the	c
start	i
time	c
was	i
at	i
19.30	c
p.m	c
,	c
but	c
the	c
play	c
started	c
at	c
20.15	c
p.m.	c
People	c
were	c
fed	c
up	c
with	c
waiting	c
so	c
long	c
and	c
most	c
of	c
them	c
apart	i
from	c
me	c
were	i
rather	c
nervous	i
.	c

From	c
my	c
point	c
of	c
view	c
I	c
think	c
he	c
was	c
such	c
a	c
very	c
bad	c
actor	c
that	c
was	i
impossible	c
to	c
fine	i
another	c
with	c
the	c
same	c
features	i
.	c

The	c
evening	c
was	c
a	c
disaster	c
and	c
I	c
wonder	c
if	c
I	c
have	c
not	c
the	c
right	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
for	i
returning	i
my	c
money	c
,	c
as	c
I	c
think	c
it	i
is	i
fair	c
.	c

She	c
has	c
given	c
away	i
to	c
my	c
mother	c
that	c
I	c
told	c
her	c
a	c
lie	c
as	c
far	c
as	c
the	c
weekend	c
was	c
concerned	c
.	c

Pat	c
told	c
her	c
I	c
had	c
n't	c
spent	c
those	c
days	c
with	c
her	c
,	c
but	c
with	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

In	c
advertisment	i
was	i
-	c
"	c
discounts	c
available	c
"	c
.	c

This	c
was	c
a	c
waste	c
of	c
time	c
.	c

In	i
these	i
days	c
,	c
when	c
we	c
can	c
see	c
picture	i
of	c
famous	i
person	c
almost	i
on	i
every	i
first	i
page	i
of	i
the	i
newspaper	c
,	c
it	c
's	c
a	i
quite	i
common	c
topic	c
.	i

Maybe	c
sometimes	c
they	c
need	c
to	c
sacrifice	c
their	c
privacy	c
?	c

According	i
to	i
me	i
,	c
you	c
ca	i
n't	i
deserve	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
private	c
life	c
when	c
you	c
're	c
famous	c
because	c
when	c
to	i
start	i
you	i
career	c
you	c
know	c
that	c
medias	i
will	c
be	c
hunting	c
you	c
everywhere	c
and	c
more	i
famous	c
you	c
get	c
worst	i
it	c
is	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
because	c
that	c
the	i
life	i
style	i
people	c
wants	i
to	c
know	c
everything	c
,	i
for	c
instance	c
,	c
about	c
their	c
favourite	c
actor	c
or	c
about	c
their	c
president.	c
.	i

I	c
wait	c
to	c
hear	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

Then	c
it	c
takes	c
about	c
1	c
hour	c
or	c
one	c
and	c
a	c
half	c
to	c
wash	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
can	c
read	c
my	c
book	c
or	c
do	c
another	c
thing	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
the	i
first	c
two	c
weeks	c
of	c
July	c
because	c
in	c
June	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
working	c
and	c
at	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
July	c
I	c
am	c
planing	i
to	c
go	c
to	c
Paris	c
to	c
attend	c
a	c
course	i
of	i
French	i
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
important	c
to	i
concentrate	i
this	i
video	i
in	i
few	i
but	i
interesting	c
part	i
of	c
our	c
daily	c
life	c
at	c
school	c

In	c
addition	c
I	c
think	c
should	i
be	i
reported	i
in	i
this	i
video	i
some	i
personal	i
opinion	i
about	i
the	i
school	i
asking	i
students	c
and	c
teachers	c
.	c

First	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
my	c
company	c
is	c
going	c
to	c
close	c
for	c
holiday	i
at	c
that	c
period	i
and	c
it	c
would	c
suits	i
me	c
very	c
well	c

and	c
I	c
am	c
able	c
to	c
swim	c
every	i
style	c

was	c

"	c
The	c
Mistery	i
of	c
Hunter	c

Lodge	c

It	c
was	c
very	c
exciting	c
because	c
she	c
could	c
play	c
at	i
the	i
same	i
time	i
two	i
people	i
:	c
herself	c
and	c
the	c
houskeeper	i

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
which	i
type	c
of	c

I	c
will	i
wear	c
there	c
,	i
would	i
you	c
check	c
the	c

In	c
the	c
afternoon	c

the	c
River	i

We	c

transport	c
that	c
makes	c
our	c
moving	i
faster	c
,	c
it	c
fastens	i
our	c
life	c

In	c
future	c
possibly	i
the	i
technology	c
would	i
n't	i
destroy	c
the	c
environment	c

but	c
we	c
have	c
to	c
do	c
something	c
now	c

because	c
tomorrow	c
can	i

Then	c

reccomend	i
me	c
to	c
take	c
only	c
summer	c
clothes	c
or	c
some	c
winter	c
clothes	c
as	c
well	c
?	c

I	c
am	c
a	c
student	c
of	i
the	c
FCE	c
class	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
in	i
name	i
of	i
my	c
class	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
the	c
programme	c
about	i
the	c
three	i
days	i
trip	c
to	c
London	c
that	c
you	c
have	c
prepared	c
for	c
us	c
.	c

We	c
think	c
that	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
for	c
us	c
to	c
see	c
this	c
show	c
because	c
we	c
are	c
all	c
interested	c
in	c
fashion	c
.	c

I	c
agree	c
with	c
this	c
statement	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
really	c
pleased	c
to	c
hear	c
from	c
you	c
I	i
won	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
the	c
competition	c
.	c

How	i
I	c
am	c
going	c
to	c
answer	c
the	c
questions	c
you	c
asked	c
me	c
in	c
the	c
letter	c
.	c

First	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
afraid	c
but	i
I	c
can	c
travel	i
only	i
in	c
July	c
.	c

I	c
've	c
got	c
three-month	i
holiday	c
from	c
June	c
to	c
August	c
but	c
I	c
've	c
already	c
promised	c
my	c
aunt	c
,	c
who	c
runs	c
a	c
small	c
nursing	c
home	c
in	c
Andover	c
,	c
to	c
help	c
her	c
during	c
June	c
and	c
in	c
August	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
quite	c
good	c
at	c
swimming	c
but	c
I	c
never	c
tried	c
to	i
do	i
surfing	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
really	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
going	c
there	c
and	c
your	i
reply	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
any	i
shops	c
are	c
too	c
busy	c
to	c
enjoy	c
shopping	c
in	c
at	c
weekends	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
prefer	c
shopping	c
at	i
weekdays	c
unless	c
I	c
am	c
busy	c
or	c
have	c
an	c
appointment	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
express	c
my	c
dissapointment	i
about	i
the	c
play	c
"	c
over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
"	c
which	i
is	c
performing	i
at	c
Circle	i
Theatre	c
.	c

The	c
evening	c
was	c
a	c
horrible	c
surprise	c
,	c
completely	c
different	c
from	c
the	i
promise	i
written	i
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
I	c
told	c
Pat	c
that	c
Lynne	c
was	c
ugly	c
,	c
fat	c
like	c
a	c
cow	c
,	c
and	c
extremely	c
agressive	i
.	c

For	c
the	c
activities	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
chose	i
the	c
Tennis	i
activities	i
,	c
which	c
I	c
am	c
not	c
too	c
bad	c
at	c
,	c
and	c
climbing	c
,	c
Which	i
I	c
have	c
never	c
done	c
but	c
must	i
be	c
interesting	c
.	c

But	c
of	c
course	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
some	c
exceptions	c
.	c

To	c
answer	c
your	c
questions	c
,	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
only	c
on	i
July	c
,	c
as	c
it	c
is	c
the	c
only	c
moment	i
when	c
I	c
can	c
take	c
my	c
holidays	c
.	c

I	c
'd	c
prefer	c
to	c
sleep	c
in	c
tents	c
rather	c
than	c
log	c
cabins	c
:	c
sleeping	c
in	c
tents	c
seems	c
to	c
correspond	c
to	c
a	c
"	c
spirit	c
of	c
adventure	c
"	c
to	c
me	c
,	c
what	i
I	c
particularly	c
like	c
;	c
in	i
the	i
opposite	i
,	c
log	c
cabins	c
are	c
more	c
"	c
traditional	c
"	c
and	c
a	c
less	c
interesting	c
experience	c
.	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c

So	c
,	c
you	c
run	c
to	c
the	c
bank	c
but	c
have	c
to	c
wait	c
for	i
the	c
queue	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
happy	c
because	c
my	c
parents	c
allow	c
me	c
to	c
do	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
things	c
.	c

Love	c
,	c

It	c
was	c
n't	c
my	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
so	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
have	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
!	c

All	c
this	c
story	c
was	c
a	c
secret	c
but	c
Pat	c
realived	i
to	i
his	c
mother	c
.	c

Yours	c
fainthfully	i

Another	c
activity	c
what	i
I	c
have	c
chosen	c
is	c
photography	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
,	c

We	c
arrived	c
to	i
the	c
place	i
in	c
the	c
morning	c
and	c
started	c
to	c
walk	c
.	c

Thanks	i
to	i
God	i
everything	i
finished	c
in	c
a	c
good	c
way	c
.	c

When	c
we	c
finished	c
our	i
primary	c
school	c
we	c
went	c
at	i
the	c
same	c
secundary	i
school	c
too	c
,	c
but	c
we	c
were	c
in	c
different	c
classes	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
finished	c
I	c
return	i
to	c
my	c
city	c
to	c
find	c
a	c
job	c
.	c

This	c
was	c
really	c
disappointing	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
really	c
late	c
.	i

The	c
manager	c
said	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
they	c
had	c
not	c
been	c
informed	c
that	c
there	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
show	c
in	i
that	c
date	c
.	c

Actually	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
the	c
clothes	c
will	c
be	c
really	c
simplier	i
in	c
100	c
years	c
and	c
I	c
hope	c
to	c
be	c
alive	c
until	c
then	c
.	c

I	c
felt	c
that	c
I	c
had	c
discovered	c
other	i
ways	i
.	c

We	c
are	c
really	c
interested	c
in	c
latest	i
fashions	c
and	c
new	c
hairstyles	c
,	c
but	i
also	c
we	c
are	c
keen	c
on	c
knowing	c
about	c
leisure	c
and	c
sports	c
clothes	c
and	c
especially	i
girls	i
enjoy	c
seeing	c
the	c
different	c
kinds	c
of	c
making	i
up	i
.	c

This	c
event	c
takes	c
place	c
in	c
Central	i
Exhibition	c
Hall	c
in	c
London	c
,	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
on	i
14th	i
of	c
March	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
dangerous	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
knew	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
switched	c
off	c
the	c
lights	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
sitting	c
in	c
bed	c
.	c

I	c
ran	c
quickly	c
and	c
I	c
managed	c
to	c
escape	c
from	c
him	c
,	c
I	c
found	c
one	i
hidden	c
wooden	c
spoon	c
and	c
while	c
he	c
was	c
passing	c
in	c
front	c
of	c
me	c
I	c
hit	c
him	c
.	c

After	c
all	c
I	i
just	c
wanted	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
restaurant	i
of	i
the	i
theatre	i
and	c
have	c
something	c
to	c
eat	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
the	c
police	c
had	c
closed	c
it	c
.	c

Now	c
we	c
can	c
cook	c
in	c
a	i
easier	c
way	c
than	c
ten	c
years	c
before	i
,	c
we	c
can	c
talk	c
with	c
somebody	c
who	c
is	c
10000	c
kilometres	c
from	c
us	c
and	c
we	c
can	c
know	c
what	c
's	c
happening	c
in	c
the	i
other	i
part	c
of	c
the	c
world	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
have	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

In	i
an	i
every	i
single	c
day	c
,	c
many	i
modern	i
technology	i
is	i
produced	i
and	c
it	c
really	c
affects	i
or	i
changes	i
our	c
daily	c
life	c
.	c

The	c
most	c
important	c
development	c
is	c
the	c
internet	i
system	i
which	i
is	c
connected	c
to	c
the	c
whole	c
world	c
's	c
computers	c
by	c
some	i
telephone	c
liens	i
.	c

It	c
just	c
takes	c
you	c
a	c
few	c
minutes	c
.	c

How	c
convenience	i
it	c
is	c
!	c

There	c
are	c
also	c
much	i
more	c
advantages	c
,	i
you	i
can	c
buy	c
somethings	i
in	c
a	c
supermarket	c
by	i
only	i
a	i
mail	i
order	i
,	i
you	i
do	c
n't	c
need	c
to	c
go	i
out	i
of	i
your	c
home	c
.	c

Some	c
modern	c
technology	c
is	c
also	c
put	i
into	i
the	i
transport	i
system	i
.	c

With	c
Internet	i
and	c
according	i
to	i
me	i
the	i
world	c
is	c
become	i
smaller	c
and	c
bigger	c
at	c
the	c
same	c
time	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

When	c
I	c
go	c
to	c
bed	c
because	i
there	c
are	c
many	c
mosquitoss	i
I	i
turn	c
on	c
a	c
special	c
machine	c
with	c
pile	i
like	i
thing	c
in	c
it	c
which	c
kills	c
them	c
.	c

Further	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
a	c
question	c
.	c

We	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
relating	i
to	i
this	c
matter	c
.	c

July	c
is	c
really	c
the	c
only	c
available	c
time	c
I	c
have	c
.	c

Does	c
it	c
rain	c
a	c
lot	c
there	c
?	c

Will	c
you	c
arrange	c
a	c
place	c
where	c
I	c
could	c
keep	c
the	c
money	c
secure	i
during	c
my	c
stay	c
at	c
the	c
camp	c
?	c

If	c
I	c
was	c
asked	c
to	c
choose	c
the	c
least	c
attractive	c
thing	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
do	c
on	c
everyday	i
basis	c
,	c
shopping	c
would	c
most	c
definitely	c
be	c
placed	c
somewhere	c
on	i
top	i
of	c
the	c
list	c
.	c

With	c
great	c
respect	c
,	c

I	c
went	c
on	c
climbing	c
until	c
I	c
saw	c
my	c
friend	c
's	c
model	c
aeroplane	c
.	c

If	c
I	c
had	c
n't	c
borrowed	c
it	c
from	c
him	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
n't	c
have	c
been	c
here	i
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

Yesterday	c
when	c
I	c
arrived	c
to	i
the	i
college	c
,	c
I	c
saw	c
Pat	c
standing	c
with	c
Peter	c
and	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
other	c
boys	c
and	c
they	c
were	c
looking	c
strange	i
at	c
me	c
and	c
laufhing	i
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

Nowadays	c
,	c
we	c
make	i
a	c
phone	c
call	c
with	c
an	c
astonish	i
rapidity	c
,	c
instead	i
at	i
my	c
grandparents	c
'	c
time	c
it	c
took	c
one	c
month	c
or	c
more	c
to	c
have	i
contact	i
with	c
people	c
abroad	c
,	c
because	c
the	c
only	c
means	c
of	c
communication	c
was	c
the	c
post	c
and	c
its	c
service	c
was	c
very	c
slow	c
!	c

We	c
pay	c
less	c
attention	c
to	c
our	c
life	c
,	c
to	c
those	c
things	c
which	c
give	c
us	c
happiness	c
,	c
that	c
are	c
n't	c
money	c
,	c
success	c
,	c
power	c
.	c

We	c
became	i
passive	c
people	c
,	c
we	c
follow	c
the	c
same	c
routine	c
every	c
day	c
and	c
we	c
live	c
in	c
a	c
society	c
where	c
rules	c
are	c
strongly	c
fixed	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
this	c
letter	c
to	c
complaint	i
about	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
that	c
Circle	i
Theatre	c
company	c
played	i
few	i
days	c
ago	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
get	c
the	c
ticket	c
,	c
and	c
the	c
women	i
said	i
me	c
that	c
the	c
discounts	c
were	c
not	c
available	c
I	c
knew	c
that	c
it	c
would	c
n't	c
be	c
a	c
good	c
night	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
writting	i
to	c
answer	c
your	c
questions	c
but	c
,	c
first	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
the	c
prize	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
mind	c
staying	c
in	c
log	c
cabins	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
prefer	c
camping	c
because	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
be	c
really	c
near	i
the	i
nature	c
.	c

Dear	c

Secondly	c
another	i
ploblem	i
was	c
about	i
the	c
starting	c
time	c
,	i
according	i
to	c
your	c
advertisement	c
the	i
play	c
starts	c
at	c
19.30	c
and	i
instead	c
it	c
started	c
on	i
20:15	c
,	c
this	c
is	c
about	i
almost	c
an	c
hour	i

Looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

I	c
really	c
enjoyed	c
the	c
opportunity	c
to	c
talk	c
with	c
well	i
known	i
starts	i
and	c
to	c
learn	c
how	c
to	c
set	c
up	c
everything	c
for	c
a	c
concert	c
.	c

We	c
would	i
not	c
have	i
had	i
discounts	i
on	c
price	i
and	c
any	i
worker	c
wanted	c
to	c
give	c
us	c
an	c
explanation	c
for	c
that	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
very	c
soon	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
a	c
college	c
student	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
going	c
to	c
study	c
in	i
university	c
this	c
year	c
.	c

From	c
:	c
Jolin	c

Quite	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
students	c
spend	c
their	c
free	c
time	c
there	c
for	i
relaxing	c
and	c
talking	c
.	c

This	c
composition	c
is	c
about	c
shopping	c
.	c

You	c
must	c
think	c
about	c
your	c
children	c
who	i
would	i
be	c
living	c
in	c
the	c
world	c
you	c
helped	c
to	c
destroy	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
this	c
is	c
all	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
say	c
to	c
make	c
you	c
think	c
that	c
shopping	c
is	c
n't	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
and	c
change	c
your	c
view	i
in	i
looking	i
at	i
shopping	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

I	c
could	c
n't	c
accept	c
it	c
.	c

My	c
brother	c
could	c
n't	c
stay	c
away	c
.	c

Dear	c
Ms	c
Ryan	c

Sometime	i
when	c
I	c
'm	c
boring	i
and	c
ca	c
n't	c
find	c
something	c
else	c
to	c
do	c
.	i

The	i
other	i
thing	i
I	i
do	i
n't	i
like	i
going	i
shopping	i
is	i
in	i
the	c
weekend	c
.	c

All	c
the	c
shops	c
are	c
full	c
of	c
people	c
,	c
and	c
people	c
treat	c
the	c
articals	i
like	c
rubbish	c
.	c

Mc	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
shopping	c
is	c
nice	i
to	c
spend	c
you	i
leisure	c
time	c
and	c
give	c
yourself	c
to	i
relax	c
sometimes	c
,	c
but	c
suggest	i
that	c
never	i
in	i
the	c
weekend	c
.	c

You	c
can	c
imagine	c
how	c
disappointed	c
I	c
am	i
when	i
spending	c
money	c
on	c
such	c
a	c
terrible	c
evening	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

It	c
is	c
often	c
suggested	c
that	c
,	i
modern	c
technology	c
makes	c
the	c
gap	c
bigger	c
between	c
peoples	i
,	c
they	c
get	c
used	c
to	c
communicating	c
with	c
the	c

Indeed	c

firstly	i
,	c
the	c
play	i
did	c
n't	c
start	c
at	c
19:30	c
as	c
it	c
was	c
planned	i
on	i
the	c
advertisement	c
but	c
45	c
minutes	c
later	c
(	c
20:15	c

Everyone	c

"	c
A	c

I	c
am	c
glad	c
to	c
hear	c
from	c
you	c

How	c
are	c
you	c
doing	c

Warm	c
whishes	i

I	c
am	c
deeply	c
disapointed	i
with	c
the	c
service	c
and	c
the	c
unrealiable	i
notice	i

at	c
your	c
theartre	i

You	c
also	c
mention	c
that	c
your	c
show	c
would	c
starts	i
at	c
19.30	c
but	c
to	c
my	c
knowleage	i
it	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
and	c
that	c
is	i
fourty-five	i
minutes	c
of	c
waiting	c

And	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
a	c
refun	i
,	i
You	c
have	c

It	c
could	c
be	c
that	c
you	c
would	i
carry	c
a	c
small	c

To	c
my	c
regret	c
,	c
the	c
evening	c
totally	c
failed	c
to	c
live	c
up	c
to	c
my	c
expectations	c

We	c
are	c
living	c
in	c
a	c
technologically	c
advanced	c
world	c
where	c
we	c
are	c

Dear	c
Mr	c

First	c
of	c
all	c

I	c
would	c

this	c
good	c
programme	c

especially	c
the	i
decision	c
of	i
going	i
to	c
visit	c
in	i
London	c

Few	i
years	c

,	c
we	c
had	c

news	c
of	c

of	c

Finally	c
,	c
after	c
chasing	i
for	c
long	i

she	c
was	c
dead	i
because	i
of	i
car	i
accident	c

It	c
is	c
one	c
of	i
fun	c
in	c
our	c
life	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c

DEAR	c
SIR	c
,	c

IF	c
I	c
HAD	c
KNOWN	c
THAT	c
BEFORE	c
,	c
I	c
WOULD	c
N'T	c
TOLD	i
HER	c
THAT	c
I	c
HAD	c
DISSAPROVE	i
MY	c
MATHEMATICS	c
EXAM	c
.	c

I	c
SAID	c
THAT	c
I	c
KNEW	c
WHAT	c
I	c
WAS	c
DOING	c
AND	c
THAT	c
MY	c
MARKS	c
WOULD	c
BE	c
GOOD	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
this	c
letter	c
to	c
you	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
complain	c
for	i
the	c
musical	c
show	c
(	c
'	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
'	c
)	c
that	c
was	c
performed	c
at	c
your	c
theatre	c
last	c
week	c
;	c
concretely	i
on	c
Friday	c
evening	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
nothing	i
was	i
further	i
from	i
what	i
really	i
happened	i
.	c

In	i
the	i
beginning	i
,	c
it	c
was	c
impossible	c
to	c
obtain	c
any	c
of	c
the	c
offered	c
discounts	c
,	c
even	c
though	c
I	c
presented	c
an	c
official	c
ISIC	c
card	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
realise	c
this	c
was	c
totally	c
different	c
from	c
what	c
you	c
advertised	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
in	c
the	c
very	c
near	c
future	c
offering	c
me	c
some	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

I	c
thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
hearing	c
my	c
request	c
.	c

I	c
apologise	c
for	c
any	c
inconvenience	c
it	c
could	i
make	i
.	c

Or	c
do	c
they	c
want	c
to	c
be	c
persecuted	c
buy	i
the	c
media	c
?	c

You	c
never	c
wished	c
to	c
be	c
famous	i
that	i
much	i
.	c

Nowadays	c
with	i
my	c
computer	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
travel	c
everywhere	i
in	c
the	c
world	c
,	c
just	c
with	i
it	c
connected	c
with	i
a	c
modem	c

With	c
all	c
this	i
problems	c
,	c
the	c
only	c
thing	c
that	c
led	i
us	i
,	i
was	c
to	i
eat	i
something	c

My	c
exams	c
start	c
the	i
next	c
month	c
that	i
's	c
why	c
I	c
have	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
work	c
.	c

In	c
your	c
letter	c
,	c
you	c
want	i
to	c
know	c
about	c
my	c
school	c
rules	c
in	c
France	c
and	c
you	c
also	c
want	i
to	c
know	c
what	c
I	c
am	c
or	c
I	c
am	c
not	c
allowed	c
to	c
do	c
at	c
home	c
.	c

You	c
must	c
to	i
be	i
outside	c
during	c
the	c
break	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
you	i
in	c
order	c
to	c
answer	c
your	c
questions	c
and	c
to	c
get	c
some	c
information	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
have	c
.	c

I	c
will	c
tell	c
you	c
everything	c
right	c
now	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
very	c
happy	c
and	c
lazy	c
at	c
the	c
same	c
time	c
.	c

This	c
is	i
the	c
most	c
important	c
experience	c
in	c
my	c
life	c
,	c
I	c
knew	c
all	c
the	c
people	c
,	c
in	c
a	i
particular	c
the	c
famous	c
singer	c
"	c
Kos	c
"	c
.	c

WE	c
ASKED	c
ABOUT	c
"	c
THE	c
DISCOUNTS	c
"	c
THAT	c
WERE	c
OFFERED	c
IN	c
THE	c
ADVERTISEMENT	c
AND	c
THE	c
ONLY	c
THING	c
THAT	c
THE	c
LADY	c
WHO	c
WAS	c
SELLING	c
COULD	i
SAY	c
WAS	c
:	c
WHAT	c
DISCOUNTS	c
?	c

I	c
look	c
forwards	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c

But	c
when	c
she	c
saw	c
the	c
phone	c
that	c
she	c
used	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
call	c
her	c
friends	c
,	c
she	c
started	c
to	c
cry	c
since	c
she	c
knew	c
that	c
she	c
would	c
use	c
it	c
.	c

Pat	c
was	c
worried	c
,	c
she	c
did	c
n't	c
know	c
what	c
to	c
do	c
.	c

Pat	c
could	c
n't	c
stand	c
the	c
pressure	c
of	c
the	c
"	c
crime	c
"	c
so	c
she	c
told	c
the	c
school	c
directors	c
that	c
I	c
stole	c
the	c
tests	c
.	c

I	c
never	c
accused	c
her	c
of	c
lying	c
,	c
and	c
I	i
you	c
ask	c
me	c
why	c
,	c
I	c
really	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
great	c
,	c
believe	c
me	c
!	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
receive	i
your	c
reply	c
with	c
my	c
money	c
.	c

I	c
know	c
that	c
some	c
people	c
need	c
them	c
to	c
work	c
but	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
understand	c
why	c
teenagers	c
need	c
it	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
convinced	c
to	i
have	i
the	c
right	c
to	i
get	i
some	c
money	c
back	c
from	c
you	c
because	c
none	c
of	c
your	c
promises	c
was	c
a	i
carried	c
out	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
your	i
answer	c
soon	c
.	c

They	c
believe	c
that	c
people	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
will	c
wear	c
confortable	i
clothes	c
because	c
they	c
will	c
be	c
outgoing	c
,	c
amused	i
,	c
etc	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
a	c
point	i
very	i
interesting	i
.	c

Helen	c

Well	c
this	c
is	c
abosolutly	i
true	c
,	c
espacially	i
when	c
you	c
go	c
shopping	c
on	c
Saturday	c
.	c

You	c
get	c
headaches	c
,	c
you	c
get	c
stressed	c
,	c
and	c
finally	c
you	c
get	c
bruses	i
because	c
of	c
the	c
woman	c
that	i
pushed	c
you	c
to	c
get	c
the	c
pretty	c
skirt	c
before	c
you	c
!	c
!	c
!	c

Shopping	c
,	c
what	c
an	c
exciting	c
thing	c
!	c

No	c
choice	c
,	i
you	c
have	c
to	c
leave	c
your	c
nice	c
clothes	c
and	c
go	c
away	c
feeling	c
bad	c
and	c
sad	c
.	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

Lastly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
learn	c
that	i
what	c
kinds	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
bring	c
with	c
me	c
and	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
(	c
American	c
currency	c
-	c
dollars	c
)	c
I	c
'll	c
need	c
to	c
have	c
while	c
I	c
'm	c
there	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
drink	c
a	c
cup	c
of	c
coffee	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
in	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
.	c

We	c
all	c
know	c
that	c
she	c
is	c
n't	c
good	c
in	i
keeping	c
her	c
mouth	c
shut	c
at	c
all	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
should	c
have	c
been	c
better	c
this	c
time	c
.	c

The	c
great	c
day	c
came	c
.	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
.	i

I	c
've	c
been	c
thrilled	c
eversince	i
I	c
received	c
your	c
letter	c
indicating	c
my	c
luck	c
of	c
having	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
the	c
competition	c
that	c
you	c
organized	c
recently	c
.	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

Of	c
course	c
,	c
the	c
resources	c
used	c
and	c
manufacturing	i
will	i
be	c
completely	c
harmless	c
for	c
the	c
enviroment	i
because	c
people	c
will	c
be	c
more	c
aware	c
of	c
the	c
neccesity	i
of	c
taking	c
care	c
of	c
the	c
world	c
we	c
live	c
in	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerelly	i

Fashion	c
news	c
are	i
followed	c
by	c
lots	c
of	c
people	c
.	c

Another	c
important	c
thing	c
will	c
be	c
the	c
use	c
of	c
technology	c
.	c

Scientists	c
are	c
looking	c
for	c
new	c
materials	c
that	c
will	c
made	i
our	c
clothes	c
more	c
comfortable	c
stronger	i
.	c

Clothes	c
will	c
have	c
a	c
strong	c
relation	c
to	c
the	c
new	c
technologies	c
and	i
modern	c
devices	c
will	c
be	c
included	c
in	c
our	c
daily	i
clothes	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
suggest	c
that	c
more	c
countries	c
should	c
be	c
part	c
of	c
the	c
Festival	i
if	c
it	c
is	c
possible	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
musical	c
'	c
OVER	c
THE	c
RAINBOW	c
'	c
.	c

To	c
begin	c
with	c
,	c
according	c
to	c
your	c
advertisement	c
,	c
discount	c
tickets	c
were	i
availabe	i
.	c

So	c
I	c
could	c
get	i
a	c
good	c
seat	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
to	c
give	i
some	i
money	i
back	i
to	i
me	i
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
as	c
far	c
as	c
I	c
am	c
concerned	c
,	c
the	c
computer	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
invention	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

I	c
purpose	i
that	c
we	c
should	c
be	i
filmed	i
five	c
topics	i
:	c

When	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
child	c
,	c
I	c
used	c
to	c
go	c
swimming	c
with	c
my	c
family	c
at	c
the	c
weekend	c
having	i
a	c
chat	c
,	c
making	c
a	c
barbecue	c
,	c
playing	c
games	c
.	c

How	c
much	c
money	c
should	c
I	c
bring	c
there	i
and	c
can	c
I	c
use	c
my	c
credit	c
card	c
at	c
the	c
camp	c
?	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

Lucky	c
me	c
!	c

As	c
you	c
know	c
,	c
I	c
'm	c
crazy	c
about	c
pop	c
music	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
to	c
be	c
more	c
patient	c
.	c

Best	c
wishes	c
,	c

To	c
make	c
matters	c
worse	c
the	i
restaurant	c
which	c
was	c
mentioned	c
in	c
your	c
advertisment	i
was	c
closed	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

It	c
helps	c
me	c
in	i
preparing	c
my	c
homeworks	i
.	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
great	c
idea	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
enjoyed	c
myself	c
to	i
this	c
festival	c
so	i
much	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
'll	c
get	c
much	c
bigger	c
concerts	i
hall	i
next	c
year	c
.	c

Long	i
time	c
ago	c
,	c
there	c
were	c
two	c
brothers	c
,	c
whose	c
parents	c
were	c
dead	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
kind	c
of	c
map	c
that	c
showed	c
the	c
place	i
for	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
money	c
which	c
robbers	c
hid	c
.	c

So	c
you	c
see	c
my	c
point	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
this	c
is	c
n't	c
affending	i
you	c
too	c
much	c
...	c

Or	c
asking	c
you	c
for	c
too	c
much	c
.	c

best	c
regards	c
,	c

Al	c
the	c
spacy	c
theme	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
your	c
attencion	i
on	i
my	i
regard	i

Maybe	c
you	c
can	i
think	c
I	c
am	c
excessive	i
but	c
recent	c
studies	c
prouves	i
that	c
this	c
mania	c
can	c
be	c
really	c
dangerous	c
.	c

We	c
still	c
look	c
at	c
what	c
people	c
look	c
like	c
and	c
not	c
at	c
what	c
they	c
really	c
are	c
.	c

And	c
their	c
life	c
passed	c
in	i
the	i
ways	i
.	c

And	c
computers	c
,	i
the	i
most	c
important	c
product	c
of	c
technology	c
.	c

Sometimes	c
they	c
do	c
n't	c
go	c
to	c
their	c
offices	c
.	c

She	c
was	c
so	c
angry	c
and	c
felt	c
so	c
betrayed	c
by	c
Mr	c
White	c
that	c
without	c
any	c
exitation	i
she	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
school	c
Headmaster	c
to	c
report	c
everything	c
she	c
had	c
seen	c
.	c

The	c
next	c
day	c
Mr	c
White	c
was	c
charged	c
for	i
abuses	i
and	c
obliged	c
to	c
resign	c
.	c

Choosing	c
gave	i
me	c
such	c
big	i
pleasure	c
because	c
I	c
never	c
have	c
to	c
worry	c
from	i
vere	i
do	i
I	c
take	i
money	c
for	c
my	c
wishes	c
.	c

Another	c
situation	c
is	c
when	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
buy	c
somebody	c
a	c
present	c
.	c

Please	c
let	c
me	c
know	c
the	i
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
we	c
will	c
be	c
wearing	c
,	i
would	i
I	c
need	c
to	c
take	c
a	c
suit	c
?	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
to	c
California	c
this	c
July	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
can	c
take	c
an	i
holiday	c
from	c
14th	c
to	c
27th	c
of	c
July	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
what	c
the	c
weather	c
is	c
like	c
,	c
and	c
you	c
are	c
paid	c
for	c
travel	c
costs	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
am	c
wondering	c
that	i
it	c
is	i
included	i
two	c
activities	c
.	c

This	c
letter	c
is	c
late	c
,	c
because	c
last	c
week	c
I	c
took	c
exams	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
busy	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
just	c
received	c
your	c
letter	c
and	c
feel	c
happy	c
about	c
winning	c
first	c
prize	c
.	c

On	i
August	c
I	c
am	c
going	c
to	c
apply	c
for	c
a	c
new	c
job	c
.	c

To	c
:	c
Mr	c
Clark	c

-	c
lessons	c
in	c
Mathematics	c
and	c
History	c
,	c
because	c
pupils	c
have	c
very	c
good	c
exam	i
's	i
result	i
.	c

I	c
really	c
had	c
butterflies	c
in	c
my	c
stomach	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
responsible	c
for	c
the	c
lightening	i
!	c

But	c
the	c
cherry	c
on	c
the	c
cake	c
was	c
that	c
I	c
met	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
handsome	c
singers	c
back	i
stage	i
!	c

Of	c
course	c
I	c
agreed	c
-	c
I	c
would	c
n't	c
want	c
to	c
miss	c
the	c
chance	c
to	c
gain	c
experience	c
while	c
having	c
fun	c
!	c

What	c
do	c
you	c
reckon	c
?	c

I	c
like	i
to	c
apologise	c
with	i
you	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
did	i
n't	i
wrote	i
to	c
you	c
recently	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
like	i
to	c
tell	c
you	c
what	c
hapend	i
to	c
me	c
in	i
the	i
last	c
weak	i
I	i
had	c
the	c
opportunity	c
to	c
help	c
in	i
one	c
of	c
the	c
most	c
pop	i
concert	i
in	c
my	c
city	c
,	i
so	i
imagen	i
,	c
I	c
fell	i
really	c
really	c
good	c
and	c
exating	i
for	i
that	i
I	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
words	c
for	i
describe	i
but	i
I	c
try	i
to	c
do	c
it	c
,	c
OK	c
?	c

I	c
really	c
enjoy	c
that	c
kind	c
of	c
day	c
what	i
about	c
you	c
?	c

I	c
need	c
to	c
know	c
if	c
my	c
travel	c
will	c
take	c
place	c
in	c
August	c
.	c

If	c
I	c
had	c
known	c
that	c
I	c
won	i
,	c
I	c
would	c
not	c
have	c
arranged	c
my	c
english	i
course	c
in	c
Britain	c
.	c

That	c
is	c
why	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
continue	c
doing	c
this	c
at	c
the	c
camp	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

When	c
discribing	i
the	c
advantages	c
,	c
we	c
should	c
remember	c
that	c
most	c
people	c
like	c
doing	c
shopping	c
.	c

As	c
well	c
as	c
that	c
,	c
some	c
shop-assistance	i
can	c
give	c
you	c
a	c
lower	c
price	c
,	c
because	c
you	c
always	c
do	c
shopping	c
at	c
their	c
shop	c
.	c

Very	c
often	c
people	c
go	c
to	c
a	c
shop	c
-	c
usually	c
a	c
big	c
departament	i
store	c
and	c
buy	c
things	c
which	c
they	c
do	c
not	c
need	c
.	c

Accordingly	c
I	c
will	c
give	c
you	c
the	c
further	c
information	c
that	c
you	c
wanted	c
.	c

Second	c
,	c
I	c
prefer	c
accommodation	i
in	c
tent	i
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
so	c
happy	c
about	c
it	c
.	c

Marlene	c

In	i
the	i
other	i
hand	i
,	c
technology	c
has	c
made	i
the	c
differences	c
between	c
-	i
poor	c
and	c
rich	c
people	c
to	c
grow	i
at	i
a	i
high	i
level	i
,	c
and	c
this	c
is	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
biggest	c
causes	c
of	c
violence	c
in	c
all	c
countries	c
.	c

Actually	c
I	c
am	c
quite	c
good	c
at	c
climbing	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
said	c
,	c
all	c
accommodation	c
and	c
travel	c
costs	c
are	c
paid	c
for	i
,	c
but	c
I	c
am	c
sure	c
I	c
still	c
need	c
some	i
money	c
with	c
me	c
.	c

Just	c
imagine	c
if	c
one	c
day	c
their	c
husbands	c
lost	c
their	c
jobs	c
,	i
will	i
those	c
women	c
still	c
thinking	i
shopping	c
is	c
enjoyable	c
!	c

Dear	c
Jane	c
Clark	c
,	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
great	c
idea	c
and	c
I	c
had	c
the	c
pleasure	c
of	c
resting	c
and	c
relaxing	c
,	c
plus	c
of	c
getting	i
some	c
important	c
knowledge	c
from	c
it	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
there	c
were	c
some	c
disadvantages	c
:	c
1	c
.	c

Some	c
concert	c
halls	c
were	c
too	c
small	c
.	c

I	c
think	i
that	i
there	i
were	i
not	i
enough	c
plays	c
and	c
films	c
.	c

Hello	c
Philip	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
it	i
is	c
all	c
what	i
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
.	c

Dear	c
Ms	c
Jane	i
Clark	c
,	c

However	c
,	c
the	c
festival	c
could	c
be	c
even	c
better	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

Actually	c
,	c
there	c
were	c
stars	c
and	c
artists	c
from	c
six	c
countries	c
and	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
wonderful	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
invite	c
artists	c
from	c
some	c
others	c
places	c
as	c
well	c
for	c
next	c
year	c
's	c
festival	c
.	c

OK	c

Margaret	c

As	c
regards	c
to	i
the	i
time	i
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
make	c
you	c
aware	c
that	c
I	c
can	c
only	c
on	i
July	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
very	i
tied	c
up	c
this	i
time	c
owing	c
to	c
he	i
exam	c
period	c
which	i
will	c
last	c
until	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
June	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
of	c
the	c
opinion	c
that	c
the	c
morning	c
English	c
lessons	c
with	c
our	c
teacher	c
George	i
are	i
worth	c
filming	c
and	c
showing	c
for	c
many	c
reasons	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
extremely	c
excited	c
about	c
the	c
camp	c
!	c

Third	c
,	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
choose	c
painting	c
and	c
surfing	c
for	c
the	c
activities	c
.	c

Because	i
I	c
've	c
started	i
surfing	c
since	c
1998	c
and	c
I	c
'm	c
keen	c
on	c
surfing	c
.	c

Hi	c
!	c

If	c
only	c
I	c
could	c
sing	c
beautifully	c
!	c

Actually	c
,	c
they	c
were	c
well-behaved	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
the	c
concert	c
finished	c
and	c
we	c
were	c
thanked	c
by	c
this	c
singer	c
.	c

I	c
wish	c
you	c
were	i
there	c
with	c
us	c
!	c

Maybe	c
next	c
time	c
!	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
of	c
13	c
June	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c
.	c

I	c
ca	c
n't	c
explain	c
how	c
supper	i
it	c
was	c
.	c

Well	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
leave	c
you	c
now	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
will	c
tell	i
you	c
more	c
details	c
when	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Brown	c
,	c

Also	c
,	c
your	c
advertisement	c
sign	i
says	c
that	c
discounts	c
are	c
available	c
.	c

After	c
having	c
read	c
your	c
letter	c
,	c
I	c
write	i
to	c
you	c
to	c
inform	c
you	c
that	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
.	c

It	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
fun	c
experiance	i
!	c

Why	c
would	c
anyone	c
shop	c
with	c
that	c
type	c
of	c
person	c
?	c

I	c
am	c
therefor	i
writing	c
to	c
ask	c
for	c
a	c
full	c
refund	c

I	c
am	c
expecting	c
to	c
receive	c
a	c
cheque	c
for	c
£	c
20	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

This	c
was	c
the	c
best	c
thing	c
that	c
ever	i
had	i
happend	i
in	i
years	i
for	i
the	i
Fennall	i
family	i
.	c

Many	c
weeks	c
went	c
by	c
and	c
Maria	c
and	c
Pat	c
did	c
n't	c
say	c
a	c
word	c
about	c
it	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
just	c
recieved	i
your	c
letter	c
saying	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
the	c
competition	c
,	i
I	c
must	c
say	c
I	c
was	c
really	c
surprise	i
and	c
happy	c
to	c
have	i
the	c
oportunity	i
to	c
join	c
the	c
Camp	c
for	c
two	c
weeks	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
thing	c
is	c
when	c
I	c
asked	c
them	c
to	c
take	c
that	c
adver	i
.	i

I	c
WOULD	c
PREFER	c
TRAVELLING	c
IN	c
JULY	c
,	c
BECAUSE	c
I	c
HAVE	c
MY	c
EXAMS	c
IN	c
JUNE	c
AND	c
I	c
'VE	c
SIGNED	c
FOR	i
A	c
CONTRACT	c
AS	i
A	c
SHOP	c
ASSISTANT	c
STARTING	i
IN	c
AUGUST	c

Angelo	c
.	c

And	c
according	i
to	c
the	c
question	c
of	i
wich	i
type	c
of	c
accommodation	c
I	c
prefer	c
,	c
I	c
choose	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
the	i
tent	c
is	c
more	i
messy	i
,	c
so	c
I	c
would	c
appreciate	c
if	i
you	c
give	c
me	c
the	i
cabin	c
.	c

Anyway	c
I	c
'm	c
not	c
very	c
good	c
doing	i
surfing	c
but	c
with	c
a	c
little	c
bit	c
of	c
help	c
I	c
know	c
I	c
can	c
make	i
it	c
.	c

Yours	c
trully	i

The	c
morality	i
of	c
the	c
story	c
is	i
here	i
very	c
clear	c
:	c
be	c
nice	c
with	i
the	i
people	c
and	c
the	i
people	c
will	c
respect	c
you	c
and	c
will	c
appreciate	c
you	c
as	c
a	c
friend	c
.	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

Yours	c
,	c
Vadim	c
Titov	c

It	c
was	c
45	c
minutes	c
late	c
!	c

And	c
also	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
buy	c
tickets	c
with	c
my	c
credit	c
card	c
but	c
on	c
the	c
advertisement	c
,	i
it	c
said	c
'	c
discounts	c
available	c
'	c
I	i
was	c
really	c
annoyed	c
by	c
that	c
!	c

I	c
have	c
no	c
idea	c
why	c
!	c

I	c
liked	c
him	c
very	c
much	c
and	c
I	c
guessed	c
he	c
liked	c
me	c
too	c
...	c

While	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
at	c
the	c
Camp	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
sailing	c
,	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
my	c
favorite	i
sport	c
.	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
I	c
must	c
say	c
that	c
every-one	i
should	c
read	c
this	c
book	c
.	c

And	c
now	c
to	c
be	i
the	i
first	i
winner	i
.	i

We	c
know	c
is	i
more	i
easy	i
for	c
these	i
busy	i
life	c
.	c

It	c
has	c
changed	c
the	c
ways	c
in	i
how	i
people	c
comunicate	i
.	c

The	i
weapons	i
and	c
the	i
factories	c
are	c
destroing	i
our	c
planet	c
and	c
we	c
need	c
to	c
realized	i
that	c
we	c
have	c
to	c
use	c
tecnology	i
to	c
impruve	i
our	c
lives	c
,	c
but	i
always	c
triying	i
to	c
respect	c
nature	c
.	c

Regarding	c
to	i
the	c
accommodation	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
tents	c
more	i
than	c
log	c
carbins	i
because	c
I	c
have	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
experiences	i
of	c
built	i
up	c
my	c
own	c
tents	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
was	c
in	c
highschool	i
,	c
I	c
have	i
joined	i
in	i
the	c
swimming	c
club	c
.	c

And	c
I	c
also	c
participated	c
in	c
a	c
few	c
swimming	c
competition	i
.	c

Try	c
the	c
internet	i
and	c
use	c
e-business	c
and	c
online-shopping	i
to	c
order	c
your	c
pants	c
for	c
example	c
.	c

This	c
is	c
even	c
an	i
appropriate	i
way	c
to	c
get	c
around	c
unfriendly	i
service	c
you	c
get	c
to	c
know	c
if	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
buy	c
something	c
in	c
a	c
shop	c
right	c
before	c
closing	c
time	c
.	c

You	c
have	c
been	c
presented	c
some	i
causes	i
why	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
London	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
I	c
could	c
not	c
concentrate	c
on	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
the	i
side	c
effect	i
of	c
artificial	c
farm	c
products	c
also	c
ca	c
n't	c
be	c
ignored	c
in	c
our	c
daily	c
life	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
say	c
the	i
science	c
and	c
techology	c
changed	c
our	c
daily	c
life	c
more	i
convenience	c
it	i
also	c
could	c
be	c
dangerous	c
.	c

Singing	c
is	c
the	c
most	c
favarite	i
hobby	c
for	c
us	c
.	c

Hana	c
Soma	c

Of	c
couse	i
,	c
the	c
shopkeepers	c
are	c
human	c
being	i
as	c
well	c
.	c

So	c
their	c
attitude	c
sometimes	c
seems	c
to	c
be	c
bossy	c
and	c
pushy	c
.	c

Dear	c
Manager	c

The	c
first	c
one	c
I	c
am	c
going	c
to	c
complaint	i
about	c
is	c
the	c
actor	c
.	c

I	c
ask	c
you	c
to	c
transfor	i
money	c
into	c
this	c
account	c
.	c

Dear	c
the	i
manage	i
of	c
theatre	i
,	c

Thirdly	c
,	c
tickets	c
were	c
£	c
10	c
,	c
£	c
15	c
and	c
£	c
20	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
knew	c
that	c
these	c
were	c
available	c
to	i
discount	c
,	c
following	c
the	c
advertisement	c
.	c

Even	c
if	c
one	c
of	c
your	c
woman	c
officer	c
annoyed	c
my	c
question	c
,	c
I	c
asked	c
that	c
why	c
they	c
did	c
n't	c
prepare	c
restaurant	c
,	c
as	c
if	c
they	c
advertised	c
like	c
that	c
.	c

You	c
said	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
perfect	i
evening	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
.	c

But	c
sometimes	c
,	c
Pat	c
mistakes	i
to	i
speak	i
someone	c
's	c
secrets	c
.	c

Pat	c
also	c
regrets	c
about	i
his	c
speaking	i
.	c

Poor	c
Pat	c
,	c
now	c
he	c
is	c
blamed	c
by	c
everyone	c
such	c
as	c
the	c
people	c
who	i
he	i
talked	i
their	i
secrets	i
to	c
everybody	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
very	c
unpleasent	i
evening	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
read	c
that	c
there	c
would	c
be	c
available	i
some	i
discounts	i
,	c
but	c
I	c
became	i
none	c
of	c
them	c
.	c

In	i
our	i
days	i
,	c
nobody	c
can	c
live	c
without	c
technology	c

The	c
timer	i
of	i
my	c
radio	c
wakes	c
me	c
up	c
at	c
half	c
past	c
six	c
.	c

After	c
school	c
I	c
relax	c
in	c
front	c
of	c
the	c
TV	c
and	c
talk	c
a	c
lot	c
with	c
my	c
friends	c
per	i
telephone	i
.	c

Without	c
these	i
technology	c
I	c
would	c
get	c
realy	i
bored	c
.	c

ANOTHER	c
PROBLEM	c
WAS	c
THE	c
TIME	c
THAT	c
I	c
HAD	c
TO	c
WAIT	c
.	c

JUST	c
BE	c
YOURSELF	c

I	c
am	c
better	c
at	c
tennis	c
that	c
at	c
golf	c
but	c
anyway	c
I	c
have	c
experience	c
in	c
both	c
these	c
sports	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
also	c
several	c
simple	c
questions	c
.	c

I	c
got	c
the	c
chance	c
to	c
meet	c
Ricky	c
Martin	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
would	i
take	c
notice	c
of	c
this	c
complaint	c
seriously	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c
.	c

Then	c
I	c
tell	c
them	c
to	c
sit	c
down	c
.	c

Each	c
part	c
of	c
the	c
film	c
mentioned	c
above	c
should	c
not	c
be	c
longer	c
than	c
5	c
to	c
10	c
minutes	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

I	c
would	c
also	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
am	c
supposed	c
to	c
take	c
with	c
me	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
be	c
glad	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
give	c
me	c
an	c
answer	c
before	c
the	c
camp	c
begins	c
.	c

The	c
most	c
annoying	c
thing	c
about	c
shopping	c
is	c
that	c
in	c
most	c
cases	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
search	c
for	c
a	c
particular	c
stuff	i
for	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
and	c
visit	c
several	c
shops	c
before	c
you	c
find	c
something	c
that	c
suits	c
you	c
.	c

Dear	c
Madam	c
,	c

Gil	c
Sanchez	c

Well	c
the	c
concert	c
was	c
Friday	c
night	c
and	c
I	c
went	c
there	c
with	c
the	c
Red	c
Cross	c
volunteers	c
,	i
did	i
you	c
know	c
I	c
'm	c
one	c
of	c
them	c
?	c

During	c
the	c
two	i
hours	i
of	i
concert	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
attend	c
thirty-six	i
people	c
,	i
who	c
became	c
inconscious	i
after	c
being	c
trapped	c
in	c
the	c
first	c
line	i
by	c
the	c
other	c
people	c
.	c

Well	c
,	c
I	c
hope	c
you	c
wo	c
n't	c
be	c
as	c
lazy	c
as	c
me	c
and	c
you	c
'll	c
write	c
soon	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
you	c
asked	c
when	c
would	i
I	i
be	c
able	c
to	c
travel	c
.	c

Sir	i
manager	c

She	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
surprised	c
and	c
soon	c
I	i
've	i
forgotten	c
her	c
question	c
.	c

The	c
year	c
was	c
getting	i
to	c
the	i
end	c
.	c

This	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
for	c
us	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
latest	c
fashions	c
and	c
famous	c
fashion	c
models	c
who	c
we	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
have	c
authograps	i
from	c
.	c

We	c
are	c
sorry	c
for	c
any	c
inconvenience	c
caused	c
by	c
our	c
request	c
.	c

The	c
biggest	c
commercial	c
gain	i
in	c
history	c
I	i
believe	c
,	c
but	c
celebrities	c
are	c
not	c
animals	c
although	c
they	c
may	c
be	c
sometimes	c
treated	c
the	c
same	c
way	c
.	c

It	c
may	c
in	i
many	c
cases	c
,	c
not	c
be	c
true	c
but	c
we	c
can	c
suspect	c
that	c
most	c
of	c
them	c
wanted	c
to	c
become	c
a	c
celebrity	c
and	c
they	c
had	c
to	c
know	c
there	i
is	i
no	i
private	i
life	i
unseparately	i
contected	i
to	i
it	i
.	c

Finally	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
if	c
I	c
need	c
a	i
special	c
clothes	c
and	c
Do	i
I	c
need	c
money	i
?	c

Anyway	c
now	i
I	c
am	c
going	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
everything	c
about	c
it	c
.	c

All	c
right	c
that	c
's	c
about	c
all	c
my	c
news	c
,	c
then	i
writte	i
soon	c
and	c
tell	c
me	c
about	c
you	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
that	c
it	c
is	c
only	c
possible	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
going	c
to	c
move	c
to	c
Spain	c
in	c
August	c
.	c

We	c
also	c
had	c
time	c
to	c
tell	c
jokes	c
and	c
play	c
with	c
water	c
balloons	c
.	c

During	c
our	c
stay	c
we	c
saw	c
a	c
bright	i
advertisement	c
of	i
your	c
theatre	c
and	c
decided	c
to	c
see	c
this	c
newest	i
and	c
best	c
musical	c
show	c
(	c
as	c
it	c
was	i
said	i
in	c
you	i
advertisement	c
)	c
.	c

The	c
show	c
had	i
to	c
begin	c
at	c
19.30	c
,	c
but	c
indeed	i
it	c
started	c
at	c
20.15	c
and	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
wait	c
for	c
45	c
minutes	c
in	i
a	i
great	i
noise	i
.	c

When	c
we	c
came	i
the	i
administration	c
of	c
the	c
theatre	c
said	c
that	c
discounts	c
are	c
not	c
available	c
.	c

My	c
name	c
is	c
Sally	c
Smith	c
.	c

After	c
the	c
show	c
we	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
but	c
it	c
closed	i
.	c

It	c
closed	c
at	c
11	c
pm.	c
It	c
was	c
not	c
our	c
fault	c
that	c
we	c
went	c
in	c
after	c
11	c
pm.	c
The	c
show	c
finished	c
late	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
disappointed	c
about	c
this	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
want	c
her	c
to	c
keep	c
it	i
secrets	i
,	c
do	c
not	c
tell	c
her	c
.	c

I	c
come	c
from	c
very	i
ruler	i
family	c
.	c

Despite	c
of	i
going	i
to	c
school	c
by	c
bus	c
easier	i
than	c
riding	i
bycyle	i
I	i
had	c
prefered	i
to	i
going	c
to	c
school	c
by	c
bycyle	i
to	c
by	i
bus	c
.	c

The	c
more	c
seeing	i
her	i
I	i
could	i
,	c
the	c
more	c
ambitious	i
I	c
became	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
went	c
to	i
her	i
play	i
to	i
see	i
,	c
I	c
realy	i
would	c
love	c
to	c
be	c
a	i
actress	c
.	c

The	c
reason	c
is	c
that	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
full-time	c
student	c
on	i
Cracow	c
University	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
many	c
exams	c
at	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
semester	i
,	c
which	c
is	c
in	c
June	c
.	c

My	c
friend	c
offered	c
me	c
a	c
job	c
as	c
a	c
member	c
of	c
techical	i
staff	c
on	i
Sting	c
's	c
concert	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
that	c
you	c
liked	c
my	c
story	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
International	i
Arts	c
Festival	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
idea	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
there	c
with	c
my	c
boyfriend	c
.	c

There	c
are	c
many	c
things	c
we	c
are	c
n't	c
allowed	c
to	c
do	c
at	c
school	c
.	c

Fortunately	c
we	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
to	c
wear	c
the	i
school	c
uniforms	c
.	c

At	c
home	c
we	c
have	c
to	c
do	c
our	c
homework	c
.	c

I	c
had	i
been	i
your	i
annual	c
international	c
art	c
festival	c
.	c

The	c
idea	c
of	c
"	i
International	c
Art	c
Festival	c
"	c
was	c
great	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
about	c
International	i
Arts	c
Festival	c
which	i
I	c
went	c
to	c
recently	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
go	c
out	c
wheneve	i
I	c
want	c
,	c
even	c
in	i
the	i
mid-night	i
.	c

Lastly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
be	c
grateful	c
if	c
I	c
could	c
have	c
following	i
informations	i
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
time	i
and	c
attention	c
.	c

It	c
can	c
show	c
how	c
much	c
students	c
are	i
enjoying	i
their	c
life	c
in	c
our	c
school	c
.	c

As	c
well	c
as	c
that	c
,	c
if	c
we	c
filmed	c
famous	c
students	c
and	c
teachers	c
in	c
our	c
school	c
,	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
fantastic	c
video	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
give	c
my	c
opinions	c
about	c
the	c
annual	c
International	c
Arts	c
Festival	c
I	c
have	c
visited	i
.	c

The	c
programme	c
can	i
be	i
also	i
improved	c
by	c
adding	c
new	c
categories	c
such	c
as	c
folk	c
songs	c
.	c

Especially	c
young	c
people	c
who	c
are	c
always	c
out	i
of	i
their	c
small	c
budget	c
.	c

Fortunatelly	i
,	c
there	c
are	c
many	c
ways	c
to	c
earn	c
some	c
money	c
nowadays	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
now	i
more	c
information	c
about	c
clothes	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
weather	i
is	c
very	c
hot	c
and	c
that	c
the	c
nights	c
are	c
not	c
cold	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
do	c
not	c
know	c
if	c
I	c
must	c
take	c
lot	i
of	c
pullovers	c
.	c

Women	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
to	i
do	i
shopping	c
,	c
but	c
not	c
alone	c
and	c
they	c
want	c
to	c
motivate	c
their	c
husbands	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
express	i
my	i
enjoyment	i
that	c
I	c
had	c
at	c
the	c
International	c
Arts	c
Festival	c
the	i
next	i
week	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
the	c
plays	c
and	c
movies	c
were	c
marvellous	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
a	c
suggestion	c
about	c
the	c
space	i
in	i
the	c
concert	c
rooms	c
.	c

Considering	c
the	c
crowded	i
,	c
it	i
should	c
have	i
more	c
rooms	c
.	c

Dear	c
Monique	c
,	c

What	c
about	c
the	c
rules	c
at	c
home	c
?	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
modern	i
technology	c
changed	c
our	c
daily	c
life	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
disappointed	c
with	c
that	c
!	c

It	c
is	c
difficult	c
to	c
say	c
how	c
people	c
will	c
be	c
wearing	c
clothes	c
100	c
years	c
from	c
now	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
surprised	c
to	c
read	c
that	c
I	c
've	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
.	c

I	c
like	c
painting	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
talent	c
,	i
I	c
could	c
paint	c
all	c
the	i
day	c
.	c

I	c
would	i
ask	c
you	c
about	c
clothes	c
and	c
money	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
hearing	i
news	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

You	i
ca	i
n't	i
be	i
carefull	i
because	i
you	i
do	i
n't	i
know	i
what	i
time	i
it	i
will	i
happens	i
.	c

And	c
it	i
's	i
so	c
many	c
people	c
like	c
her	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
the	c
travel	i
start	i
only	i
july	i
if	c
possible	c
,	i
because	i
this	c
is	c
my	c
Hoilday	i
start	i
,	i
at	c
the	c
Camp	c
California	c
I	i
would	c
like	c
my	c
accommodation	i
in	c
tents	i
,	c
because	c
I	c
work	c
in	c
Army	i
and	c
in	i
the	c
camp	c
I	c
usually	c
stay	c
in	c
tent	i
at	c
night	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
will	c
feel	c
more	c
comfortable	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
video	c
I	c
think	c
we	c
should	c
take	c
part	i
to	c
talk	c
about	c
,	i
what	c
we	c
doing	i
in	c
feel	i
time	c
and	c
study	c
period	i
.	c

It	c
would	c
be	c
nicer	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
the	c
next	c
one	c
will	c
be	c
better	c
.	c

Dear	c
Lula	c

It	c
's	c
really	c
strict	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
so	c
excited	c
by	c
the	c
news	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
I	c
can	c
take	c
this	c
opportunity	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
I	c
run	c
my	c
shop	c
all	c
year	c
round	c
except	c
three	c
weeks	c
in	c
July	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
have	c
accommodation	c
in	c
log	c
cabins	c
as	c
I	c
find	c
sleeping	c
in	c
tents	c
very	c
uncomfortable	c
thought	i
it	c
may	c
be	c
a	c
new	c
experience	c
.	c

I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
about	c
what	c
clothes	c
we	c
need	c
,	c
what	c
the	c
weather	c
is	c
like	c
and	c
whether	c
we	c
need	c
some	c
spending	c
money	c
or	c
not	c
.	c

But	c
the	c
rest	c
of	c
the	c
preparation	c
was	c
so	c
good	c
.	c

Of	c
course	c
,	c
I	c
've	c
enjoyed	c
being	c
around	c
famous	c
singers	c
,	c
too	c
.	c

Unfortuneatly	i
,	c
Daniela	c
fainted	c
.	c

You	c
will	c
not	c
believe	c
how	c
close	c
I	c
was	c
to	c
the	c
singers	c
.	c

People	c
at	i
the	i
backstage	c
including	i
me	c
were	i
helping	c
to	c
clean	c
up	c
all	c
the	c
stuff	c
and	c
ready	i
for	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
the	c
concert	c
.	c

After	c
that	c
Paul	c
got	i
white	c
in	c
his	i
face	c
,	c
he	c
was	c
pale	c
like	c
a	c
wall	c
and	c
it	c
seemed	c
as	i
he	c
would	i
be	i
very	c
nervous	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
visited	c
the	c
festival	c
,	c
of	c
course	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
really	c
good	c
.	c

Besides	c
,	c
some	c
concert	c
halls	c
were	c
too	c
small	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Jane	i
Clark	c
,	c

Best	c
wishes	c
.	i

I	c
do	c
n't	c
like	c
the	i
songs	i
of	i
Brunner	i
and	i
Brunner	i
because	c
this	c
kind	c
of	c
music	c
is	c
very	c
boring	c
.	c

I	c
will	c
never	c
ever	c
help	c
anybody	c
to	c
organice	i
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
.	i

For	c
the	c
past	c
four	c
years	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
playing	c
tennis	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
also	c
done	c
some	c
courses	c
about	i
painting	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Well	c
,	c
my	c
dream	c
come	i
true	c
.	c

Best	c
wishes	c
,	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
inform	c
that	i
I	c
prefer	c
travelling	c
in	c
July	c
to	c
travelling	c
in	c
another	i
month	c
.	c

Next	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
stay	i
in	c
tents	i
rather	c
than	c
stay	c
in	c
log	i
cabins	i
because	c
I	c
appreciate	c
having	c
straight	i
contact	c
with	c
nature	c
.	c

Do	c
n't	c
worry	c
because	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c

.	c

From	c
my	c
point	c
of	c
view	c
,	c
there	c
were	c
not	i
disadvantages	c
.	c

Finaly	i
,	c
I	c
must	c
choose	c
traveling	i
there	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
not	c
allowed	c
to	c
take	c
holidays	c
in	c
other	c
months	c
due	c
to	c
my	c
work	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
open	c
from	c
10.00	c
until	c
19.00	c
,	c
and	c
we	c
could	c
go	c
there	c
on	i
the	c
afternoon	c
.	c

Thinking	c
about	c
the	c
media	c
's	c
treatment	c
of	c
famous	c
people	c
,	c
I	c
've	c
realised	c
of	i
some	c
things	c
.	c

But	c
in	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
before	c
you	c
get	c
famous	c
you	c
know	c
which	i
are	c
the	c
consequences	c
.	c

As	c
in	c
another	c
you	i
may	c
know	c
what	c
could	c
happen	c
.	c

I	c
find	c
it	c
really	c
good	c
,	c
specially	i
because	c
of	c
the	c
visit	c
to	c
the	c
Science	c
Museum	c
and	c
the	c
National	c
Art	c
Gallery	c
.	c

The	c
plays	c
and	c
films	c
were	c
really	c
wonderful	c
,	i
people	i
liked	c
them	c
very	c
much	c
,	c
so	c
could	c
you	c
play	i
more	c
next	c
year	c

I	c
really	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
going	c
to	c
the	c
festival	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

Dear	c
Jacob	c
:	c

I	c
'm	c
really	c
sorry	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
write	i
you	i
back	i
immediately	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
was	c
preparing	c
my	c
exam	c
at	c
that	c
moment	c
,	c
so	c
can	c
you	c
forgive	c
me	c
?	c

We	c
should	c
keep	c
in	c
touch	c
with	c
each	c
other	c
,	c
because	c
you	c
know	c
I	c
'm	c
very	c
happy	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
friend	c
like	c
you	c
.	c

If	c
I	c
can	i
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
change	c
this	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
think	c
everyone	c
can	c
success	i
at	c
once	c
,	i
we	i
should	c
give	c
them	c
second	i
chance	c
to	c
try	i
.	c

Another	c
option	c
is	c
to	c
wash	c
your	c
neighbour	c
's	c
car	c
.	c

Do	c
I	c
need	c
any	c
formal	c
ones	c
?	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

But	c
at	c
home	c
you	c
noticed	i
that	c
there	c
is	c
a	c
tear	c
on	c
sleeve	i
.	c

Somebody	c
could	c
give	c
you	c
not	c
enough	c
change	c
.	c

First	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
the	c
only	c
free	c
month	c
I	c
have	c
in	c
the	c
summer	c
.	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
tired	c
but	c
when	c
the	c
concert	c
began	c
I	c
felt	c
excited	c
because	c
there	c
were	c
so	c
many	c
people	c
dancing	c
and	c
singing	c
in	c
front	c
of	c
the	c
stage	c
.	c

Brenda	c

Nowadays	c
,	c
I	c
barely	c
know	c
my	c
parents	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
do	c
know	c
exactly	c
what	c
is	c
happening	c
in	c
the	c
soap	c
operas	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

I	c
had	c
everythig	i
planned	c
,	i
I	i
and	i
my	i
family	i
where	i
coming	c
to	c
whatch	i
your	c
show	c
and	c
then	c
have	c
a	c
decent	c
meal	c
at	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
disasterous	i
.	c

That	c
was	c
a	c
dissapointment	i
for	c
my	c
whole	c
family	c
,	i
infact	i
all	c
the	c
viewers	i
where	i
very	c
dissappointed	i
.	c

But	c
Pat	c
was	c
so	c
exited	i
that	c
he	c
forgot	c
all	c
about	c
the	c
secret	c
and	c
told	c
all	c
of	c
his	c
best	c
mates	c
.	c

now	i
,	i

I	c
have	c
a	c
few	c
suggestion	i
on	c
how	c
the	c
programme	c
could	c
be	c
changed	c
to	c
fit	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
in	c
.	c

We	c
an	i
on	c
and	c
off	c
lights	c
with	c
touch	c
pads	c
and	c
remote	c
controllers	i
.	c

Another	c
way	c
our	c
home	c
could	c
be	c
different	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
is	c
probably	c
the	c
utilitles	i
we	c
are	i
using	c
.	c

Dear	c
Jane	c
Clark	c
,	c

Dear	c
Nico	c
,	c

Anyway	c
it	i
think	c
that	c
's	c
it	c
for	c
now	c
.	c

So	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
thing	c
you	c
will	c
enjoy	c
most	c
of	c
the	c
time	c
,	c
but	c
still	c
have	i
something	i
you	i
will	i
not	i
enjoy	i
it	i
.	c

The	c
place	c
where	c
you	c
are	c
shopping	c
also	i
very	c
important	c
.	c

After	i
I	c
've	c
written	c
this	c
composition	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
you	c
will	c
enjoy	c
shopping	c
most	c
of	c
the	c
time	c
,	c
but	c
still	c
have	i
sometimes	c
you	c
wo	c
n't	c
.	c

Circle	c
Theatre	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
say	i
you	c
that	c
I	c
am	c
asking	c
for	c
money	i
back	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
had	c
an	i
evening	i
totally	i
despleased	i
,	c
completely	c
different	c
that	i
you	c
have	i
anouced	i
in	c
your	c
advertisement	c
.	c

From	i
that	c
time	c
,	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
buy	c
my	c
own	c
computer	c
and	c
every	c
day	c
I	c
was	c
improving	c
my	c
knowledge	c
.	c

Firstly	i
I	c
become	i
to	c
write	c
letters	c
and	c
articles	c
,	c
next	c
I	c
learned	c
several	c
computers	i
plays	i
.	c

At	c
my	c
home	c
every	c
rule	c
must	c
be	c
respected	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	i
,	c

You	c
asked	c
me	c
,	i
how	i
the	c
pop	c
concert	c
was	c
like	c
which	c
I	c
told	c
you	c
I	c
was	c
going	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
in	c
my	c
last	c
letter	c
.	c

Therefore	c
I	c
got	c
to	c
stay	c
backstage	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
and	c
to	c
see	c
all	c
the	c
members	c
of	c
the	c
"	c
Backstreet	c
Boys	c
"	c
.	c

And	c
,	c
you	c
wo	c
n't	c
believe	c
it	c
,	c
I	c
actually	c
got	c
to	c
talk	c
to	c
Nick	c
Carter	c
!	c

In	c
fact	c
,	c
some	c
of	c
our	i
classmates	c
have	c
seen	c
an	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
'	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
'	c
.	c

And	c
everyone	i
of	c
us	c
is	c
interested	c
in	c
fashions	c
and	c
clothes	c
!	c

What	c
do	c
you	c
think	c
about	c
our	c
suggestion	c
?	c

For	c
me	c
,	c
his	c
books	c
are	c
great	c
.	c

And	c
I	c
think	c
this	c
book	c
is	c
a	c
very	c
good	c
one	c
for	c
your	c
cousin	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
,	c

Indeed	i
it	i
will	c
be	c
free	c
for	c
us	c
as	c
we	c
are	c
students	c
.	c

May	c
I	c
suggest	c
an	c
alternative	c
?	i

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
,	c
like	i
usual	c
,	c
it	c
's	c
a	c
pleisure	i
to	c
receive	c
a	i
word	i
from	c
you	c
.	c

Love	c
from	c
,	i

I	c
am	c
writing	c
you	i
to	c
complain	c
about	c
,,Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
musical	i
show	c
which	c
took	c
a	i
place	c
in	c
The	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
several	c
weeks	c
ago	c
.	c

But	c
also	c
,	i
I	c
would	i
not	i
be	i
able	c
to	c
imagine	c
my	c
life	c
without	c
the	i
nice	c
way	c
of	c
reciving	i
news	c
with	c
help	i
of	i
it	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
ask	c
permission	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
.	c

We	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
there	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
very	c
popular	c
nowadays	c
.	c

I	c
've	c
heard	c
that	c
Leisure	i
and	c
sports	c
wear	c
,	c
make	i
up	i
and	c
hairstyles	c
are	c
really	c
wonderful	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
afraid	c
of	i
doing	i
it	c
but	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
.	c

She	c
was	c
at	c
the	c
hospital	c
and	c
she	c
was	c
really	c
bad	c
.	c

Before	c
I	c
took	c
money	i
one	c
of	c
the	c
cashier	i
had	c
pressed	c
a	c
button	c
to	c
call	c
a	i
police	c
.	c

We	c
are	c
very	c
interested	c
in	c
going	c
this	i
show	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
that	c
you	c
would	i
give	c
us	c
an	c
opportunity	c
to	c
visit	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

So	c
they	c
can	c
be	c
just	c
ordinaly	i
people	c
like	c
us	c
.	c

I	c
spent	c
two	c
days	c
at	c
the	c
International	c
Arts	c
festival	c
you	c
organised	c
.	c

During	c
the	c
concert	c
I	c
listened	c
the	i
band	c
like	c
everybody	c
,	i
besides	c
I	c
earned	c
money	i
so	i
,	i
was	i
a	c
wonderful	c
experience	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
,	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
some	c
details	c
about	c
this	c
show	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
it	i
will	i
be	i
a	i
great	i
opportunity	i
to	i
all	i
of	i
us	i
to	i
be	i
on	i
this	i
show	i
while	c
we	c
are	c
going	i
to	i
be	i
in	c
London	c
.	c

You	c
must	c
control	c
your	c
behaviour	c
and	c
try	c
not	c
implove	i
so	c
much	c
yourself	c
.	c

First	c
,	c
In	i
school	c
,	c
we	c
are	c
not	c
allowed	c
to	c
run	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
we	c
do	c
n't	c
want	c
lose	i
this	c
chance	c
.	c

I	c
started	c
think	i
about	c
it	c
,	i
after	i
all	c
,	c
either	i
had	i
I	i
neve	i
done	i
this	i
task	i
before	i
,	i
or	i
trained	i
.	c

I	c
also	c
extremely	i
hated	c
those	c
people	c
who	c
stood	c
there	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
.	c

You	c
could	c
have	c
let	c
us	c
get	c
used	i
to	i
more	c
cultures	c
by	c
inviting	c
from	i
some	c
other	c
countries	c
too	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
could	c
hardly	c
participated	i
in	i
all	c
of	c
the	c
concerts	c
.	c

Yours	c
Sincerely	i
,	c

If	c
we	c
do	c
n't	c
come	c
to	c
school	c
for	c
10	c
days	c
,	c
then	c
we	c
ca	c
n't	c
pass	c
the	c
class	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
a	c
musical	i
show	c
that	c
I	c
saw	c
in	i
your	c
theatre	c
.	c

This	c
was	c
the	c
worst	c
night	c
that	c
I	c
had	c
during	c
my	c
stay	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

The	c
children	c
were	c
very	c
enthusiastic	c
because	c
they	c
thought	c
that	c
Maria	c
was	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
very	c
happy	c
with	c
this	c
surprise	c
.	c

If	c
the	c
answer	c
is	c
yes	c
,	c
could	c
you	c
tell	c
me	c
which	i
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
will	c
need	c
.	c

Students	c
using	c
the	c
computer	c
and	c
video	c
room	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
this	c
programme	c
has	i
a	i
good	i
organisation	i
,	c
as	c
you	c
know	c
,	c
due	i
to	i
we	c
have	c
enough	c
time	c
to	c
visit	c
plenty	c
of	c
local	c
interest	c
points	c
.	c

In	c
this	c
way	c
,	c
we	c
can	c
go	c
to	c
visit	c
the	c
Science	c
Museum	c
earlier	c
in	c
the	c
morning	c
and	c
the	i
,	i
we	c
can	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

Do	c
you	c
think	c
you	c
've	c
the	i
future	c
in	c
your	c
hands	c
?	c

Maybe	c
,	c
in	c
a	c
few	c
years	i
later	i
we	c
'll	c
have	c
a	c
bigger	c
TV	c
,	c
a	c
more	c
suitable	c
radio	c
but	c
,	c
from	i
my	i
point	i
of	i
view	i
,	c
I	c
think	c
these	c
facts	c
will	c
not	c
change	c
the	i
way	c
of	c
our	i
lifes	i
.	c

I	c
mean	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
think	c
we	c
'll	c
change	c
cars	c
by	i
aereoplanes	i
...	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
I	c
strongly	c
believe	c
that	c
the	i
the	c
house	c
of	c
the	c
future	c
will	c
be	c
the	c
house	c
of	c
a	c
new	c
mindness	i
it	c
will	c
be	c
a	c
very	c
positiu	i
point	c
for	c
opening	c
our	i
lifes	i
.	c

Hi	c
!	c

I	c
enjoyed	c
helping	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
last	c
month	c
.	c

His	c
voice	c
is	c
also	c
soulful	c
and	c
sometimes	c
even	c
gave	c
us	c
blissful	c
.	i

An	i
especiall	i
invitation	c

Some	c
days	c
later	c
we	c
went	c
back	c
to	c
Dehli	c
and	c
having	i
being	i
to	c
the	c
doctor	c
and	c
having	c
again	c
bottled	i
water	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
feeling	c
healthy	c
again	c
.	c

Now	c
I	c
can	c
realize	c
one	c
of	c
my	c
dream	i
.	c

I	c
can	c
do	c
two	c
activities	c
during	c
my	c
stay	c
at	c
the	c
camp	c
.	c

You	c
want	c
to	c
hear	c
about	c
my	c
experience	c
in	i
helping	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
.	c

After	c
the	c
concert	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
clean	c
the	c
area	c
and	c
it	c
took	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
because	c
people	c
were	i
like	c
pigs	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
was	c
chatting	c
and	c
laughing	c
with	c
other	c
workers	c
.	c

One	c
more	c
word	c
!	c

I	c
did	c
n't	c
regret	c
it	c
and	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
again	c
!	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
give	c
some	c
suggestions	c
for	c
next	c
year	c
as	c
I	c
have	c
read	c
the	c
advertisement	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
it	c
might	c
be	c
better	c
to	c
have	c
time	c
with	c
variety	i
nationallites	i
.	c

Thirdly	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
expecting	c
to	c
watch	c
more	c
films	c
and	c
plays	c
which	i
were	c
impressive	c
.	c

It	c
happened	c
at	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
school	i
year	c
.	c

It	c
occured	i
that	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
teachers	c
told	c
my	c
parents	c
about	c
it	c
.	c

-	c
talks	c
by	c
writers	c
to	c
say	c
how	c
good	c
is	i
his	i

book	i

Secondly	c
,	c
it	i
took	i
times	i
to	i
wait	i
about	c
forty	i
five	i
minutes	c
,	c
because	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
.	c

Especially	i
I	i
believe	c
that	c
the	c
visit	c
to	c
the	c
National	c
Art	c
Gallery	c
will	c
be	c
a	c
really	c
exciting	c
experience	c
for	c
all	c
of	c
us	c
.	c

What	c
is	c
more	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
is	c
free	c
for	c
all	c
the	i
students	c
.	c

Whenever	c
they	c
go	c
out	c
they	c
are	c
suddenly	c
"	c
hounded	c
"	c
by	c
groups	c
of	c
journalists	c
and	c
photographers	c
who	c
want	c
an	c
interview	c
or	c
a	c
photo	c
.	c

But	c
the	c
worst	c
thing	c
of	c
all	c
is	c
that	c
they	c
are	c
often	c
victim	i
of	c
malicious	c
gossips	i
,	c
which	c
most	c
of	c
the	c
times	i
are	i
not	c
even	c
true	c
.	c

The	c
next	c
consideration	c
is	c
the	c
activities	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
seeing	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

We	c
have	i
concerned	i
it	c
as	i
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
to	c
touch	c
a	c
part	c
of	c
latest	i
cultures	c
,	c
which	c
are	c
concentrated	c
and	c
sharpened	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

New	c
materials	c
will	c
surly	i
change	c
the	c
home	c
of	c
the	c
future	c
in	c
any	i
ways	c
.	c

I	c
paint	c
a	c
lot	c
in	c
my	c
free	c
time	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
also	c
important	c
to	c
present	c
a	c
comercial	i
english	i
lesson	c
,	i
maybe	i
the	c
pupils	c
could	c
write	c
"	c
offers	c
and	c
orders	c
"	c
or	c
enquiries	c
on	c
the	c
blackboard	c
.	c

It	c
would	c
be	c
funny	c
to	c
present	i
the	c
computers	c
,	c
which	c
are	c
often	c
overcharged	i
,	c
or	i
often	c
the	c
netserver	i
is	i
spinning	i
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
would	c
be	c
all	c
for	c
our	c
video	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
this	i
are	c
the	c
most	c
interesting	c
things	c
in	c
our	c
school	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
afraid	c
that	c
reality	c
had	c
nothing	c
common	c
with	c
the	c
things	c
I	c
suspected	i
to	c
meet	i
.	c

Can	c
you	c
imagine	c
the	i
trend	c
which	c
will	i
be	c
as	c
shocking	c
as	c
it	i
has	i
never	i
been	i
?	c

Teenagers	c
are	c
bored	c
with	c
casual	c
fashion	c
and	c
their	c
parents	c
laugh	c
at	c
them	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
fact	c
they	c
wear	c
common	i
clothes	c
.	c

You	c
can	c
imagine	c
how	c
disappointed	c
I	c
must	i
be	i
to	c
spent	i
such	c
an	c
imperfect	c
evening	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
modern	c
technology	c
has	c
made	c
our	c
environment	c
more	c
polluted	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
travel	c
only	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
the	c
only	c
month	c
when	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
school	c
.	c

I	c
wondered	c
which	i
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
should	c
take	c
to	c
the	c
camp	c
and	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
know	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
should	c
take	c
.	c

As	c
I	c
sold	c
all	c
the	c
tickets	c
that	c
the	c
organisers	c
gave	c
me	c
,	c
I	c
won	c
a	c
prize	c
of	c
ten	c
pounds	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
very	c
important	c
experience	c
for	c
me	c
because	c
I	c
learnt	c
all	c
about	c
the	c
organisation	c
of	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
.	c

.	c
.	c

I	c
read	c
it	c
and	c
found	c
it	c
very	c
good	c
,	c
specially	i
,	i
Science	i
Museum	c
and	c
National	c
Art	c
Gallery	c
as	c
I	c
am	c
interested	c
in	c
arts	c
.	c

Girls	i
should	i
like	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
latest	c
fashion	i
,	c
new	c
make-up	c
and	c
interesting	c
hairstyles	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

It	c
gives	c
you	c
safety	c
.	c

Take	c
care	c
of	c
your	c
home	c
,	c
do	c
not	c
hesitate	c
in	i
it	c
and	c
you	c
will	c
be	c
very	c
happy	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
we	c
were	c
informed	c
that	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
was	c
starring	c
but	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
was	c
starring	c
in	c
the	c
show	c
and	c
he	c
was	c
really	c
disappointing	c
.	c

MY	c
LIFE	c
AND	c
MODERN	c
TECHNOLOGY	c

Almost	c
everyone	c
has	c
televisions	c
,	c
computers	c
and	c
electronic	c
devices	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
look	c
at	c
my	c
life	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
understand	c
I	c
am	c
dependent	c
on	c
the	c
machines	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
greater	i
if	c
there	c
were	c
more	c
famous	c
people	c
who	i
have	i
various	c
nationalities	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
,	c
larger	c
halls	c
should	c
be	c
provided	c
for	c
concerts	c
since	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
people	c
could	c
not	c
get	c
tickets	c
for	c
those	c
by	c
big	c
stars	c
.	c

Of	c
course	c
,	c
you	c
ca	c
n't	c
afford	c
a	c
luxualy	i
car	c
and	c
a	c
large	c
apartment	c
unless	c
you	i
've	i
born	i
with	i
a	i
silver	i
spoon	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
only	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
my	c
family	c
is	c
going	c
to	c
visit	c
me	c
on	i
August	c
and	c
I	c
will	c
have	c
to	c
look	c
after	c
them	c
.	c

I	c
used	c
to	c
going	i
with	c
my	c
friends	c
to	c
the	i
camp	c
,	c
wich	i
was	c
situeded	i
on	i
a	i
seaside	c
.	c

You	c
ca	c
n't	c
buy	c
something	c
in	c
peacful	i
and	c
calm	c
athmospher	i
.	c

On	c
balance	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
shopping	c
should	c
be	c
a	c
nice	c
thing	c
so	c
if	c
you	c
have	i
bad	i
mood	c
do	c
n't	c
go	c
shopping	c
.	c

The	c
yellow	i
press	i
is	c
searching	c
for	c
every	c
little	c
information	i
they	c
can	c
get	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
"	c
,	c
wich	i
I	c
visited	i
on	c
Friday	c
the	c
16th	c
of	c
June	c
in	c
your	c
theatre	c
.	c

I	c
went	c
there	c
a	i
10	c
o'clock	c
in	c
the	c
morning	c
.	c

I	c
talked	c
to	c
them	c
and	c
to	c
many	c
other	c
groups	c
that	c
arrived	c
later	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
really	c
a	c
wonderful	c
day	c
.	c

Give	c
my	c
regards	c
to	c
your	c
family	c
.	c

Most	c
of	c
the	c
events	c
were	c
wonderful	c
and	c
well-organised	i
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
the	c
idea	c
of	c
holding	c
this	c
International	c
Arts	c
Festival	c
is	c
great	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
look	i
forward	c
to	c
hearing	i
your	c
replies	i
.	c

At	c
my	c
home	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
many	c
rules	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
'm	c
careless	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
am	i
n't	i
allowed	c
to	c
smoke	c
at	c
home	c
as	i
well	i
:	c
and	c
I	c
'm	c
not	c
allowed	c
to	c
use	c
telephone	i
,	c
because	c
last	c
year	c
I	c
made	i
£	i
1000	c
bill	c
for	c
one	c
month	c
,	i
my	i
parents	c
were	c
very	c
angry	c
with	c
it	i
,	c
so	c
they	c
told	c
me	c
I	c
am	c
not	c
to	c
use	c
telephone	i
any	c
more	c
,	i
oh	i
,	c
How	i
poor	i
!	c

She	c
was	c
25-years-old	i
secretary	c
in	c
one	i
big	c
company	c
.	c

This	c
was	c
his	c
secretary	c
Pat	c
,	c
however	c
,	c
he	c
could	c
n't	c
be	c
sure	c
and	c
decided	c
to	c
check	c
it	i
up	c
.	c

Next	i
day	c
he	i
understood	c
that	c
he	c
was	c
right	c
.	c

About	c
the	c
Accomodation	i
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
sleep	c
on	i
the	i
tents	i
,	c
because	c
I	c
never	i
been	i
in	c
one	c
,	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
lot	c
more	c
fun	c
than	c
log	c
cabins	c
.	c

But	c
in	i
this	i
days	i
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
,	c
because	c
if	c
you	c
decide	c
to	c
buy	c
a	c
very	c
expensive	c
designer	c
and	i
you	c
pay	c
full	i
price	c
,	c
on	i
the	c
end	c
of	c
the	c
season	c
it	c
is	c
half	c
price	c
,	i
I	c
find	c
very	i
anfair	i
for	c
people	c
who	c
pay	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
money	c
on	i
their	c
clothes	c
.	c

I	c
will	c
give	c
you	c
all	c
the	c
necessary	c
information	c
.	c

Mr	c
Smith	c
,	c

No	i
only	c
:	i
we	c
had	c
the	c
bad	c
surprise	c
that	c
Brook	c
had	c
been	c
substituded	i
by	c
another	c
actor	c
!	c

Sometimes	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
Musical	c
Show	c
,	i
I	c
have	i
seen	i
last	c
week	c
.	c

There	c
is	c
some	c
disagreement	c
a	i
between	c
your	c
advertisement	c
and	c
show	i
,	i
which	c
I	c
could	i
see	i
at	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
.	c

The	c
Musical	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
not	c
at	c
14:30	c
-	c
as	c
you	c
have	i
mentioned	i
.	c

It	c
was	c
very	c
surprising	c
for	c
me	c
and	c
I	c
had	c
got	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
trouble	c
with	c
coming	i
back	c
home	c
at	c
night	c
-	c
when	c
it	c
finished	c
.	c

The	c
place	c
you	c
have	i
offered	c
was	c
closed	c
and	c
there	c
was	c
nothing	c
to	c
eat	c
inside	c
the	c
theatre	c
at	c
all	c
.	c

Could	c
you	c
possibly	c
explain	c
why	c
you	c
did	c
n't	c
provide	c
us	c
anything	i
to	c
eat	c
?	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

Their	c
clothes	c
were	c
always	c
strictly	c
connected	c
with	c
their	c
lifestyle	c
,	c
climate	c
and	c
money	c
.	c

Do	c
you	c
agree	c
with	c
me	c
?	c

This	c
change	c
will	c
give	c
opportunity	i
to	c
create	i
some	i
different	i
performance	i
.	c

What	c
is	c
more	c
,	c
it	c
has	i
been	i
written	i
that	c
I	c
can	i
get	c
some	c
discounts	c
,	c
but	c
when	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
buy	c
a	c
cheaper	c
ticket	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
impossible	c
.	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c

You	c
have	c
to	c
find	c
which	c
shop	c
offers	c
you	c
good	c
quality	c
products	c
for	c
a	c
good	c
price	c
.	c

The	c
day	c
of	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
we	c
got	c
to	c
the	c
theather	i
at	c
19:30	c
.	c

Pat	c
knew	c
something	c
was	c
wrong	c
because	c
she	c
had	c
known	c
Sally	c
since	c
they	c
were	c
five	c
years	c
old	c
,	c
but	c
she	c
did	c
not	c
why	i
she	c
was	c
acting	c
so	c
strange	i
.	c

But	c
she	c
knew	c
that	c
Pat	c
did	c
it	c
because	c
she	c
loved	c
her	c
and	c
was	c
afraid	c
something	c
horrible	c
could	i
have	i
happened	i
to	c
her	c
or	c
to	c
her	c
mother	c
.	c

In	i
the	i
other	i
hand	i
it	c
is	c
not	c
as	c
important	c
,	c
the	c
main	c
reason	c
is	c
I	c
really	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
go	i
at	i
this	c
Camp	i
and	c
one	i
more	c
time	c
,	c
thanks	c
a	c
lot	c

Schwartz	c

We	c
have	c
recently	c
had	c
a	c
discussion	c
in	c
our	c
class	c
about	c
this	c
statement	c
,	i
we	i
have	c
had	c
a	c
great	c
argueing	i
.	c

In	c
spite	c
of	c
liking	c
all	c
the	c
sports	c
you	c
wrote	c
in	i
your	c
letter	c
I	i
am	c
only	c
good	c
at	c
climbing	c
and	c
sailing	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
am	i
used	i
to	i
practise	i
them	c
with	c
my	c
father	c
since	i
I	c
was	c
a	c
child	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
the	c
prize	c

If	c
you	c
present	i
a	c
show	c
you	c
must	c
be	c
on	c
time	c

is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

I	c
can	c
clearly	c
remember	c
my	c
childhood	c
and	c
our	c
only	c
local	c
shop	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
very	c
exciting	c

Would	c
you	c
tell	c
me	c
that	i
how	c
much	c
money	c
you	c
would	i
give	c
it	i
to	c
me	c
and	c
how	i
is	i
the	i
weather	i
like	c
in	c
U.S.A.	i
Thank	c
you	c
for	c
every	i
thing	i
!	c

Before	c
the	c
concert	c
actually	c
started	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
give	c
out	c
lots	c
of	c
leaflets	c
,	i
they	i
are	i
list	i
of	c
pop	c
band	i
and	c
group	i
which	c
will	i
appear	c
in	c
the	c
concert	c
in	c
order	c
,	c
and	c
some	c
information	c
about	c
their	c
performance	c

how	c
much	c
money	c

I	c
need	c

Dear	c
Kim	c

She	c
seemed	c
to	c
be	c
very	i
active	c
woman	c
when	c
she	c
was	c
singing	c
but	c
at	c
the	c
same	c
time	c
she	c
had	c
very	i
gentle	c
attitude	c
when	c
she	c
spoke	c
to	c
me	c
.	c

But	c
do	c
n't	c
worry	c
Kim	c
,	c
I	c
'll	c
send	c
you	c
a	c
copy	c
of	c
her	c
CD	c
for	c
you	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
an	c
evening	c
I	c
spent	c
in	c
your	c
theatre	c
to	i
see	i
a	c
musical	c
show	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
sure	c
you	c
will	c
accept	c
my	c
request	c
;	c
if	c
not	c
I	c
intend	c
to	c
take	c
legal	c
actions	i
against	c
your	c
company	c
.	c

All	c
of	c
the	c
students	c
in	c
my	c
class	c
have	c
read	c
through	c
the	c
programmes	c
that	c
you	c
have	c
set	i
,	i
they	i
are	c
quite	c
interesting	c
,	c
especially	c
the	c
river	c
trip	c
to	c
Greenwich	c
,	c
because	c
some	c
of	c
us	c
may	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
university	c
there	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

So	c
we	c
can	c
walk	c
around	c
and	c
see	c
how	i
it	i
looks	i
like	i
in	i
Greenwich	i
.	c

The	c
first	c
days	c
was	i
going	i
fine	c
,	i
we	i
just	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
some	c
teamwork	c
things	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
so	c
difficult	c
for	c
me	c
because	c
I	c
was	i
really	c
scared	c
to	c
stand	c
in	i
a	c
high	c
place	c
since	c
I	c
was	c
young	c
.	c

But	c
after	c
I	c
climbed	c
two	c
steps	c
more	c
,	c
my	c
right	c
feet	i
slipped	c
over	i
,	i
I	c
was	i
nearly	c
fell	c
down	i
,	c
but	c
luckly	i
my	c
hand	c
caught	c
a	c
rock	c
,	i
it	i
was	c
dangerous	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
had	i
any	c
choice	c
,	i
finally	i
I	c
did	c
it	c
.	c

Then	c
,	c
I	c
went	c
into	c
the	c
theatre	c
on	c
time	c
but	c
became	c
a	c
little	c
bit	c
angry	c
for	i
waiting	c
until	c
20:15	c
,	c
forty-five	c
minutes	c
after	c
the	c
expected	c
starting	c
time	c
.	c

'	c
Who	c
wants	c
to	c
be	c
a	c
doctor	c
?	c
'	c

I	c
was	c
terribly	c
ennoyed	i
!	c

Being	c
in	i
an	c
apprenticeship	c
,	c
I	c
go	c
both	i
work	c
and	c
university	c
.	c

I	c
often	c
go	c
on	c
Internet	i
to	c
find	c
informations	i
for	i
studying	c
a	c
precise	i
subject	c
more	c
accutely	i
(	c
university	c
technology	c
sites	c
)	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
bought	c
a	c
second	c
musical	c
show	c
ticket	c
which	c
start	i
at	c
19:30	c
but	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
am	c
fully	c
entitled	c
to	c
ask	c
for	c
refund	i
except	i
for	i
evening	i
out	i
.	i

For	c
example	c
,	c
if	c
you	c
were	c
hurt	c
seriously	c
like	c
cutting	c
leg	i
,	i
the	c
new	c
medical	c
technology	c
could	c
rebuilit	i
part	c
of	c
your	c
body	c
.	c

So	c
at	c
the	c
same	c
time	c
many	c
people	c
can	c
share	c
some	c
information	c
even	c
though	c
they	c
live	c
in	c
different	c
country	i
.	c

And	c
it	c
will	c
change	c
our	c
lives	c
,	c
also	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
.	c

That	c
change	i
really	c
disappointed	c
me	c
.	c

Next	c
time	c
,	c
be	c
more	c
careful	c
with	c
what	c
you	c
put	c
in	c
your	c
advertisement	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

I	c
invited	c
my	c
best	c
friends	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
asked	c
Christian	c
to	c
bring	c
some	c
videos	c
.	c

Manuel	c
opened	c
the	c
door	c
,	c
and	c
there	c
she	c
was	c
,	c
Pat	c
with	c
Ramiro	c
's	c
sister	c
hearing	i
all	c
our	c
conversation	c
.	c

Personally	c
,	c
Climbing	c
is	c
an	c
interesting	c
activity	c
,	c
where	c
you	c
need	c
concentration	c
and	c
you	c
are	c
working	c
with	c
your	c
whole	c
body	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
surprised	c
on	i
the	c
result	c
of	c
the	c
competition	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
better	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
travel	c
on	i
July	c
.	c

I	c
took	i
part	c
at	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
competitions	c
.	c

We	i
first	i
had	c
to	c
prapare	i
the	c
stands	c
with	c
food	c
and	c
drinks	i
and	c
buy	c
something	c
which	c
had	c
been	c
forgotten	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
afternoon	c
the	c
singers	c
cames	i
in	c
and	c
I	c
also	c
could	c
have	c
an	c
interview	c
with	c
Ricky	c
Martin	c
.	c

We	c
went	c
to	c
a	c
nice	c
restaurant	c
and	c
enjoyed	c
dinner	c
together	c
.	c

Now	c
you	c
can	c
guess	c
how	c
disappointed	c
I	c
was	c
when	c
I	c
saw	c
that	c
there	c
were	c
different	c
(	c
and	c
worse	c
)	c
actors	c
!	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

The	c
tree	c
was	c
our	c
ship	c
and	c
the	c
river	c
the	c
sea	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
our	c
secret	c
Pat	i
and	c
I.	c
Child	i
's	i
secret	c
.	c

There	c
was	i
lots	c
of	c
fights	c
between	c
us	c
and	c
we	c
were	c
naughty	c
like	c
child	i
could	i
be	c
with	c
other	c
child	i
.	c

Dear	c
Miss	c
Ryan	c
,	c

So	c
that	i
,	i
I	c
consider	c
myself	c
expirienced	i
enough	i
.	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

But	c
I	c
've	c
been	c
quite	c
busy	c
just	c
recently	c
.	c

I	c
can	c
just	c
switch	c
on	c
my	c
computer	c
and	c
order	c
everything	c
.	c

In	c
comparison	c
to	c
my	c
grandparents	c
they	i
have	c
really	i
problems	c
to	i
accept	i
these	c
changes	c
in	c
modern	c
technology	c
.	c

The	c
second	c
reason	c
is	c
the	c
weather	c
.	c

The	c
group	c
needs	i
to	c
found	i
a	c
good	c
microphone	c
for	c
the	c
concert	c
,	c
because	c
the	c
singer	c
lost	c
his	c
microphone	c
last	c
concert	c
.	c

Yours	c
Irene	c

I	c
thank	c
you	c
again	c
.	c

After	c
having	c
thought	c
about	c
this	c
video	c
and	c
asked	c
different	i
people	c
so	c
as	c
to	c
know	c
what	c
they	c
suggested	c
,	c
I	c
reached	c
the	c
following	c
conclusions	c
:	c
we	c
must	c
film	c
the	c
lessons	c
which	c
are	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
and	c
the	c
activities	c
which	c
take	c
a	i
great	c
part	c
in	i
a	c
day	c
at	c
school	c
;	c
this	c
being	c
in	c
three	c
parts	c
.	c

Science	c
and	c
Technology	c
is	c
a	c
theme	c
very	c
discussed	i
nowdays	i
,	c
most	c
of	c
the	c
comunity	i
of	c
our	c
city	c
,	c
and	c
of	c
the	c
world	c
,	c
were	i
technology	c
has	c
arrived	c
,	c
confirms	c
that	c
it	c
has	c
in	c
some	c
way	c
improved	c
their	c
way	c
of	c
life	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
inform	i
the	i
further	c
information	c
about	c
myself	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
great	c
to	c
have	c
a	i
fun	c
and	c
also	c
it	i
was	i
very	i
good	i
memorise	i
.	c

Han	c

Also	c
shopping	c
makes	c
people	c
happier	c
by	c
using	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
money	c
and	c
it	c
influnce	i
even	i
economic	i
situation	i
more	i
flexably	i
.	i

Also	c
there	c
are	c
plenty	c
of	c
dangerous	i
that	i
lots	c
of	c
people	c
have	c
wallet	i
stollen	i
because	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
public	c
place	c
and	c
there	c
are	c
too	c
many	c
people	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
shop	i
owner	i
often	c
cheat	c
their	c
customers	c
by	c
increasing	c
the	c
cost	c
secreatly	i
.	c

So	c
,	c
I	c
started	c
to	c
speak	c
in	c
English	c
with	c
him	c
.	c

I	c
liked	c
my	c
experience	c
with	c
him	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
the	c
best	c
part	c
was	c
when	c
he	c
gave	c
me	c
his	c
e-mail	c
address	c
.	c

I	c
play	c
basketball	c
and	c
tennis	c
very	c
well	c
.	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
!	c

I	c
'm	c
glad	c
you	c
're	c
doing	c
well	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
also	c
asked	c
about	c
a	i
timetable	c
of	c
the	c
concert	c
and	c
I	c
looked	c
for	c
drugs	c
,	c
knifes	i
and	c
so	c
on	c
in	c
bags	c
.	c

Dear	c
Miss	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c

That	c
is	c
all	c
.	c

First	c
because	c
I	c
'm	c
not	c
so	c
rich	c
and	c
second	c
because	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
enjoy	c
to	i
shop	i
all	c
the	c
time	c
.	c

Nothing	c
in	c
life	c
is	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
even	i
the	c
things	c
we	c
enjoy	c
to	i
do	i
,	c
and	c
that	c
's	c
how	c
life	c
is	c
.	c

Unfortunetley	i
I	c
am	c
not	c
good	c
at	c
both	i
of	c
them	c
.	c

Maybe	c
I	c
will	c
have	c
time	c
to	c
do	c
enough	c
practise	i
as	i
much	c
as	c
I	c
always	c
wanted	c
to	c
do	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
lots	c
of	c
memory	i
which	c
I	c
could	c
never	c
forget	c
.	c

With	c
attendance	i
to	c
the	c
annual	c
international	c
arts	c
festival	c
which	c
you	i
took	c
place	c
on	c
21	c
and	c
22th	i
November	c
2000	c
,	c
I	c
spend	i
tremendous	i
two	c
days	c
enjoying	c
some	c
features	i
.	c

In	c
addition	c
to	c
that	c
some	c
concert	c
halls	c
were	c
too	c
small	c
to	i
enjoy	c
the	c
concerts	c
.	c

Therefore	c
,	c
I	c
strongly	c
recommend	c
that	c
you	c
should	c
collect	i
artists	c
and	c
stars	c
more	i
than	c
six	c
countries	c
and	c
rebuild	i
larger	c
concert	c
halls	c
.	c

I	c
know	c
you	c
're	c
fine	i
,	c
but	c
I	c
've	c
been	c
very	c
busy	c
studying	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
exam	i
next	c
month	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
tents	c
because	c
I	c
love	c
atmosephere	i
of	c
camping	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
would	c
n't	c
mind	c
to	i
stay	i
in	c
log	c
cabins	c
.	c

It	c
felt	i
to	c
be	c
a	c
good	c
memory	c
to	c
be	c
remember	i
and	c
remind	i
our	i
sleves	i
to	c
speak	c
in	c
a	c
correct	c
way	c
.	c

Having	i
a	c
sport	c
after	c
class	c
it	i
also	c
fun	c
.	c

My	c
exams	c
will	c
have	c
finished	c
at	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
June	c
.	c

I	c
will	c
only	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
set	c
off	c
in	c
July	c
and	c
I	i
also	i
will	c
give	c
my	c
thesis	c
to	c
my	c
teacher	c
in	c
August	c
.	c

Is	c
there	c
any	i
toilet	c
and	c
shower	c
in	c
the	c
log	c
cabins	c
or	c
somewhere	c
nearby	c
?	c

How	c
is	c
your	c
new	c
school	c
and	c
parents	i
?	c

Believe	c
it	c
or	c
not	c
I	i
put	c
make	i
up	i
on	c
one	c
famous	c
singer	c
's	c
face	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
n't	c
believe	c
my	c
eyes	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
so	c
pleased	c
to	c
know	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
such	c
amazing	i
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
.	c

So	c
that	c
is	c
my	c
second	c
choice	c
.	c

Do	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
bring	c
something	i
else	c
?	c

I	c
am	c
writting	i
to	c
tell	c
you	c
about	c
my	c
experience	c
in	i
the	c
last	i
month	i
pop	i
concert	i
,	c
where	c
I	c
was	c
helping	c
my	c
friend	c
Nick	c
who	i
was	c
the	c
bouncer	c
of	i
the	c
place	i
.	c

I	c
should	c
say	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
the	c
easiest	c
and	c
more	i
interesting	c
job	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
ever	c
done	c
.	c

I	c
will	c
always	c
said	i
thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
to	c
the	c
inventor	c
who	c
has	c
invented	c
the	c
maschines	i
wich	i
make	i
the	c
washing	c
and	c
the	c
washing-up	c
,	c
before	c
this	c
,	c
the	i
women	c
spent	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
had	i
done	i
this	i
tasks	c
.	c

for	i
example	c
if	c
you	c
are	c
a	c
working	c
mother	c
with	c
three	c
children	c
,	c
that	i
means	c
you	c
are	c
always	c
n	i
a	c
hurry	c
,	c
going	c
shopping	c
is	c
really	c
unenjoyable	c

Dear	c

Moreover	c
,	c
I	c
'll	c
prepare	c
everything	c
for	c
going	c

should	c
include	c
all	c
those	c
points	c
lists	c
above	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
I	c
'll	c
do	c
sailing	c
and	c
tennis	c
.	c

Because	i
last	c
time	c
I	c
was	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
,	c
I	c
found	c
it	c
really	c
uncomfortable	c
and	c
when	c
it	c
rained	c
in	c
the	c
night	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
got	i
to	c
sleep	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
sound	c
of	c
water	c
hitting	c
the	c
tent	c
.	c

We	c
all	c
go	c
shopping	c
,	c
maybe	c
not	c
every	c
day	c
,	c
but	c
certainly	c
at	c
least	c
once	c
a	c
week	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
you	c
did	c
not	c
plan	c
to	c
buy	c
any	c
crisps	c
,	c
but	c
they	c
are	c
at	c
half	c
price	c
and	c
you	c
buy	c
them	c
without	c
thinking	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
the	c
party	c
will	c
take	c
place	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
16th	c
of	c
June	c
at	i
College	i
Canteen	i
.	c

As	c
a	c
result	c
I	c
had	c
a	i
work	c
too	c
.	c

We	c
would	c
have	c
much	i
money	c
from	c
the	c
work	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
we	c
happy	i
to	c
won	i
the	c
first	c
prize	c
on	i
your	c
competition	c
.	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

It	c
would	c
be	c
very	c
pleasant	c
if	c
I	c
could	c
join	c
your	c
basketball	c
team	c
,	c
since	c
I	c
used	c
to	c
play	c
it	i
in	c
my	c
school	c
's	c
team	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
I	c
'm	c
pretty	c
good	c
at	c
it	c
.	c

Surfing	c
would	c
be	c
another	c
good	c
option	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
stepped	c
on	c
a	c
surfboard	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
this	c
is	c
a	c
beautiful	c
sport	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

Firstly	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
how	c
disappointing	c
was	i
that	i
night	i
.	c

The	c
headmaster	c
wanted	c
to	c
tell	c
the	c
police	c
what	c
we	c
had	c
done	c
so	c
we	c
decided	c
to	c
close	i
him	c
in	c
a	c
little	c
house	c
,	i
we	c
had	c
twenty	c
kilometers	i
far	i
from	c
the	c
village	c
until	c
we	c
could	c
change	c
his	c
opinion	i
.	c

We	c
need	i
to	c
do	c
something	c
like	c
that	c
to	c
make	c
him	c
change	c
.	c

Ten	c
of	c
them	c
said	c
should	i
make	i
the	i
computing	c
.	c

Playing	c
football	c
is	c
good	c
for	c
health	i
.	c

Dear	c
Manager	c
,	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
understand	c
your	c
faults	i
and	c
I	c
'm	c
asking	c
you	c
for	c
the	i
money	c
back	c
.	c

Faithfully	c
Yours	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
tents	i
because	c
since	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
child	c
I	c
have	c
being	i
using	c
this	c
type	c
of	c
accommodation	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

They	c
became	c
friends	c
again	c
.	c

last	c
year	c
.	c

2	c
Most	c
part	i
of	i
students	c
are	c
very	c
shy	c
when	c
the	c
teachers	c
ask	c
them	c
if	c
they	c
have	c
one	i
doubt	i
in	i
some	i
subjects	i
at	i
the	i
classes	i
.	c

Dear	c
Madam	c
,	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
happy	c
to	c
know	i
that	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
and	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
a	c
good	c
opportunity	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
U.S.A	c
.	c

I	c
will	c
be	c
working	c
until	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
June	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
going	c
to	c
start	c
university	c
in	c
August	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
from	i
my	i
point	i
of	i
view	i
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
receive	i
the	c
money	c
that	c
I	c
payed	i
because	c
it	i
was	c
not	c
the	i
same	i
as	i
you	c
offered	i
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
.	c

I	c
prefered	i
going	i
by	i
motorbike	c
with	c
the	c
people	c
who	c
studyied	i
with	c
me	c
in	c
the	c
Institute	c
.	c

But	c
,	c
until	c
you	c
are	c
twenty	c
years	c
old	c
you	c
choose	c
your	c
best	c
friends	c
.	c

For	c
theses	i
reasons	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
you	c
should	c
know	c
well	i
the	i
person	i
who	i
wants	i
to	c
explain	i
a	c
secret	c
and	i
keep	i
it	c
.	c

I	c
like	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
as	c
an	c
actor	c
and	c
when	c
I	c
read	c
that	c
he	c
would	c
be	c
starring	c
,	c
I	c
booked	c
the	c
ticket	c
imagetly	i
.	c

I	c
belong	c
to	c
this	i
generation	c
who	c
had	i
grown	c
up	c
with	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
different	i
technolgy	i
.	c

And	c
we	c
could	c
n't	c
visit	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

Second	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
rather	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
tend	c
to	c
get	c
very	c
nervous	c
in	c
small	c
closed	c
places	c
,	c
so	c
a	c
tent	c
would	c
be	c
unapropriate	i
for	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
been	c
surfing	c
for	c
five	c
years	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
competed	c
in	c
two	c
championships	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerately	i
,	c

There	c
was	c
an	c
ambulance	c
behind	c
the	c
stage	c
,	c
so	c
the	c
paramedic	c
came	c
right	c
away	c
and	c
took	c
care	c
of	c
Bono	c
's	c
finger	c
.	c

Bye	c
!	c
see	c
you	c
soon	c
,	c

Andre	c
Michel	c

Lastly	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
for	i
some	c
questions	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
that	c
this	c
experience	c
was	c
wonderful	c
and	c
in	c
fact	c
I	c
enjoyed	c
a	i
lot	c
and	c
of	c
course	c
I	c
knew	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
people	c
there	c
.	c

By	c
the	i
time	c
I	c
thought	c
:	c
"	c
I	c
want	c
my	c
money	c
back.	c
"	c

Despite	c
the	c
fact	c
that	c
she	c
was	c
my	c
best	c
friend	c
I	c
could	c
never	c
count	c
on	c
her	c
or	c
she	c
would	c
tell	c
everybody	c
in	c
high	c
school	c
all	c
my	c
secrets	c
.	c

People	c
would	i
be	i
starring	i
at	c
me	c
and	c
laughing	c
.	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

As	c
you	c
know	c
,	c
I	c
helped	c
at	i
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
last	c
month	c
.	i

Concerning	c
the	c
proposed	c
activities	c
please	i
,	c
accept	i
me	i
for	c
Singing	c
and	c
Painting	c
.	c

Oh	c
yes	c
,	c
I	c
also	c
had	c
to	c
check	c
the	c
tickets	c
for	c
five	c
minutes	c
.	c

Then	c
I	c
'll	c
have	c
holiday	i
which	c
finish	i
in	c
August	c
.	c

I	c
've	c
played	c
tennis	c
for	c
ten	c
years	c
I	i
'm	c
a	c
profesional	i
and	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
be	c
good	c
at	c
it	c
,	c
in	i
any	i
time	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

Katerina	c

I	c
think	c
you	c
must	i
told	c
people	c
about	c
this	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
.	c

Adults	c
think	c
that	c
new	i
coloured	c
clothes	c
,	i
that	c
young	c
people	c
wear	c
are	c
horrible	c
an	i
very	c
untraditional	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
a	c
few	c
moments	i
in	i
which	i
you	c
cannot	c
enjoy	c
shopping	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
disappointed	c
because	c
the	c
things	c
that	c
were	c
writen	i
on	i
the	c
advertisment	i
were	c
not	c
really	c
true	c
.	c

The	c
musical	c
should	c
have	c
begun	c
at	c
19:30	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
;	c
it	i
is	c
inacceptable	i
!	c

Luna	c

I	c
have	i
just	i
received	i
it	c
yesterday	c
.	c

Is	c
it	c
hot	c
or	c
raining	c
?	c

Many	c
thanks	c

It	c
is	c
very	i
important	c
thing	c
for	c
our	c
life	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c
With	c
reference	c
to	c
your	c
advertisment	i
regarding	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
"	c
I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
with	i
the	c
intention	c
to	i
give	i
you	c
an	c
impression	c
of	c
our	c
experiences	c
visiting	i
the	c
above	i
mentioned	i
show	c

The	c
story	c
describes	c
his	c
feelings	c

thoughts	c

fears	c
and	c
emotions	c
during	c
a	c
struggle	c
with	c
a	c
giant	c
deep-sea	c
fish	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
will	c
enjoy	c
it	c
!	c

I	c
used	c
to	c
swim	c
for	c
the	c
school	c
team	c
.	c

I	c
have	i
to	c
get	c
everythings	i
that	c
they	c
need	i
up	c
to	i
the	c
stair	i
.	c

Then	c
I	c
can	i
take	c
rest	i
about	i
30	c
mins	c
.	c

We	c
were	c
so	c
tried	i
but	c
it	i
's	i
good	c
fun	c

Bye	c

Write	c
me	i
as	c
soon	c
as	c
you	c
can	c
.	c

Some	c
of	c
friends	i
would	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
British	c
Museum	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
not	c
been	c
there	c
before	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Love	c

Anna	c
told	c
her	c
again	c
:	c
"	c
Pat	c
do	c
n't	c

"	c
.	c

Anna	c
could	c
n't	c
do	c
anything	c
though	c
because	c
she	c
needed	c
her	c
help	c
to	c
give	c
the	i
invitations	c

I	c
could	c
n't	c
help	c
it	c
!	c
,	i
I	c
'm	c
so	c
sorry	c
!	c
"	c

With	i
pleasure	i
I	i
'll	i
give	i
all	c
information	i
wich	i
you	c
need	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
glad	c
I	c
can	c
chose	i
two	c
activities	c
while	c
I	c
will	i
at	c
the	c
Camp	c
.	c

Situations	i
are	c
variously	i
.	c

In	c
addition	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
annoyed	c
by	c
the	c
fact	c
that	c
the	c
event	c
had	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
-	c
not	c
19:30	c
as	c
mentioned	i
in	c
the	c
advertisment	i
.	c

Everyone	c
had	c
already	i
heard	c
of	i
me	c
getting	c
the	c
secret	c
access	c
code	c
for	c
the	c
'	c
Secret	c
Society	c
'	c
organisation	c
.	c

Everyone	c
was	c
aware	c
that	c
telling	i
aloud	c
about	c
'	i
Secret	c
Society	c
'	c
could	c
get	c
you	c
in	c
trouble	c
,	c
serious	c
trouble	c
.	c

I	c
want	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
one	c
more	c
thing	c
I	i
do	c
not	c
have	c
any	c
idea	c
about	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
and	c
clothes	i
I	c
have	c
to	c
bring	i
would	i
you	c
give	c
me	c
an	i
advice	c
to	i
know	i
how	c
much	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
bring	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
about	c
my	c
experience	c
when	i
I	i
was	i
helping	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
,	i
well	i
first	c
let	c
me	c
tell	c
you	c
that	c
my	c
job	c
was	c
helping	c
the	c
artist	i
if	c
they	c
need	i
something	c
,	c
for	c
example	c
give	i
them	c
water	c
or	c
snacks	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
I	c
want	c
you	c
to	c
know	c
that	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
due	c
to	c
the	c
exam	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
taking	c
in	c
June	c
and	c
,	c
afterwards	c
,	c
I	c
will	c
start	c
my	c
university	c
studies	c
in	c
September	c
which	c
means	c
lots	i
of	c
things	c
to	c
be	c
sorted	c
out	c
.	c

Lastly	c
,	c
do	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
take	c
with	c
me	c
any	c
special	c
staff	i
of	c
clothes	c
?	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

If	c
this	c
was	c
n't	c
enough	c
you	i
strength	c
and	c
mental	c
health	c
can	c
be	c
completely	c
destroyed	c
when	c
despite	i
having	c
been	c
stolen	i
,	c
having	c
spent	c
hours	c
walking	c
around	c
and	c
being	c
tired	c
and	c
hungry	c
you	i
finally	c
buy	c
something	c
you	c
really	c
liked	i
with	c
your	c
credit	c
card	c
and	c
after	i
having	c
walked	c
a	c
few	c
blocks	c
you	i
see	c
the	c
same	c
item	c
at	c
half	c
price	i
in	c
another	c
shop	c
.	c

I	c
forgot	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
that	c
there	c
were	c
no	c
available	i
discounts	i
.	c

So	c
I	c
asked	c
someone	c
who	c
seemed	c
to	c
be	c
in	c
charge	c
,	c
and	c
he	c
told	c
me	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
too	c
late	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
meal	c
.	c

He	c
did	c
n't	c
kept	i
my	c
secret	c
.	c

They	c
were	i
not	c
exist	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	i
return	i
to	i
me	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

Alessandra	c
Lane	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
soon	c
knew	c
it	c
because	c
when	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
school	c
canteen	c
everybody	c
was	c
staring	c
at	c
me	c
and	c
whispering	c
to	c
eachother	i
.	c

I	c
recived	i
your	c
letter	c
about	c
I	i
won	i
two	i
weeks	i
at	c
camp	c
California	c
in	c
the	c
U.S.A	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
travel	i
July	i
because	c
I	c
will	c
have	c
holidays	c
in	c
this	i
mounth	i
.	c

I	c
'm	c
very	c
surprised	c
about	c
the	c
good	c
news	c
and	c
I	c
'm	c
sure	c
I	c
'll	c
really	c
have	c
a	c
good	c
time	c
in	c
California	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
happy	c
to	c
answer	c
to	i
your	c
questions	c
.	c

Regarding	c
to	i
the	c
activities	c
,	c
I	c
choose	c
swimming	c
and	c
tennis	c
.	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c

He	c
also	c
tell	i
that	c
I	c
must	c
be	c
the	i
next	i
day	i
at	i

I	c

It	c

hear	c
the	c
news	c
from	c
you	c
that	c
I	c

I	c
would	c

Yours	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
we	c
went	c
to	c
ticket	i
office	c
to	c
get	c
the	c
tickets	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
ship	c

But	c
now	c
,	i
I	c
am	c
thinking	c
about	c
new	i
secret	i
our	i
place	i
.	c

We	c
saw	i
the	c
musical	c
in	c
sadness	c
.	c

I	c
mean	c
when	c
the	c
earth	i
's	i
getting	c
warmer	c
and	c
warmer	c
because	c
of	c
an	i
pollution	c
that	c
we	c
people	c
cause	i
the	i
world	c

lausanne	c
,	c
the	c
17th	c
of	c
June	c
2000	c

Last	c
weekend	c
,	c
I	c
have	i
been	i
in	c
London	c
with	c
my	c
friend	c
and	c
I	c
saw	c
your	c
musical	c
show	c
"	c
over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
.	c

After	c
this	c
bad	c
show	c
we	c
had	c
want	i
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
Restaurant	c
for	c
drunk	i
and	c
ate	i
something	c
and	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
and	c
nobody	c
had	i
explained	i
us	i
why	c
the	c
Restaurant	c
was	c
n't	c
open	c
.	c

Pat	c
is	c
not	c
an	c
angry	i
girl	c
.	c

Also	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
go	c
swimming	c
and	c
surfing	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
used	c
to	c
be	c
an	c
assistant	c
in	c
a	c
Korean	c
national	c
pool	c
so	i
that	i
I	c
am	c
good	c
at	c

I	c
helped	c

Report	c
about	c
which	c
lessons	c
and	c
activities	c
we	c
should	c
film	c
.	c

To	c
come	c
back	c
to	c
a	i
strict	i
(	i
a	i
little	i
beat	i
less	i
)	i
subject	c
,	c
I	c
suggest	c
that	c
we	c
film	c
the	c
sport	i
lesson	c
,	i
doing	i
that	c
will	c
allowed	i
the	c
spectator	c
to	c
see	c
how	c
does	i
the	c
students	c
behave	c
when	c
they	c
are	c
all	c
together	c
and	c
in	c
small	c
groups	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Ryan	c

Although	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
easy	c
to	c
choose	c
two	c
activities	c
from	c
your	c
list	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
do	c
Singing	i
and	i
Surfing	i
.	c

I	c
hope	c
I	c
gave	i
you	c
all	c
informations	i
you	c
need	c
.	c

Dear	c
Kim	c

I	c
did	c
not	c
hesitate	c
one	c
moment	c
.	c

My	c
price	i
was	c
the	c
chance	c
to	c
meet	c
a	c
pop	c
group	c
and	c
to	c
help	c
at	c
the	i
concert	c
.	c

I	i
started	c
at	c
8	c
pm	c
but	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
be	c
there	c
at	c
11	c
am	c
.	c

At	c
8	c
pm	c
Metallica	c
started	c
and	c
I	i
have	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
,	c
they	c
did	i
a	c
great	c
performance	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
if	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
mind	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
sleep	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
.	c

Thirdly	c
,	c
some	c
clothes	c
can	c
have	c
some	c
stains	c
on	c
and	c
you	c
have	c
n't	c
noticed	c
this	c
before	c
buying	c
,	i
so	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
go	c
back	c
to	c
the	c
shop	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
doing	i
shopping	c
bring	i
me	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
satisfaction	c
especially	c
I	i
am	c
depressed	c
,	i
nevertheless	i
it	c
could	c
be	c
very	c
dangerous	c
for	c
my	c
wallet	c
.	c

A	c
group	c
of	c
girls	c
can	c
spend	i
their	i
time	i
in	c
a	c
shopping	c
center	i
forever	c
.	c

Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
recommened	i
that	c
speaking	c
classes	c
and	c
school	c
trips	c
should	c
be	c
filmed	c
.	c

Misses	i
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
.	c

My	c
wife	c
and	c
me	i
went	c
to	c
The	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
last	c
Saturday	c
evening	c
because	c
we	c
love	c
the	c
main	c
actor	c
,	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
can	c
see	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
a	c
perfect	c
evening	c
at	c
all	c
!	c

There	c
should	c
be	c
no	c
problem	c
as	c
I	c
still	c
have	c
the	c
tickets	c
.	c

Dear	c
Matt	c
:	c

I	c
'm	c
always	c
very	c
busy	c
traveling	i
from	c
one	c
country	c
to	c
another	c
,	c
you	c
know	c
.	c

The	c
story	c
is	c
about	c
the	i
life	c
in	c
a	c
small	c
village	c
.	c

That	c
woman	c
is	c
supposed	c
to	c
have	c
killed	c
her	c
husbands	c
(	c
at	c
least	c
two	c
)	c
,	c
because	c
she	c
wanted	c
their	c
money	c
.	c

Listen	c
to	c
the	c
radio	c
if	c
you	c
want	c
to	c
know	c
how	c
it	c
ends	c
.	c

A	c
lot	c
of	c
money	c
are	i
involved	c
in	c
research	c
to	c
stop	c
the	c
increasing	i
of	i
polution	i
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c

Another	c
thing	c
that	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
know	c
is	c
why	c
you	c
did	c
n't	c
do	i
any	c
discount	c
if	i
it	i
was	c
showed	i
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
.	c

Three	c
years	c
passed	c
and	c
like	i
is	c
normal	c
between	c
friends	c
,	c
she	c
knew	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
things	c
about	c
them	c
like	i
her	c
friends	c
knew	c
a	c
lot	c
about	c
her	c

I	c
think	c
after	c
100	c
years	c
,	c
at	c
least	c
something	c
will	c
change	c
in	i
the	i
point	i
that	i
design	c
,	c
material	c
,	c
color	i
,	c
etc	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
,	c

On	c
the	c
one	c
hand	c
,	c
science	c
and	c
technology	c
have	c
been	c
developing	c
rapidly	c
,	c
and	c
God	c
knows	c
what	c
new	c
materials	c
will	c
be	c
invented	c
in	c
future	i
.	c

And	c
it	c
is	c
even	c
more	c
difficul	i
to	c
predict	c
how	i
the	i
clothes	c
of	i
the	c
future	c
will	c
look	c
like	c
.	c

Secondly	c
it	c
must	i
have	i
started	c
at	c
14.30	c
and	c
ended	c
by	c
19.30	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
would	c
be	c
greatful	i
if	c
you	c
payed	i
for	c
a	c
full	c
refund	c
of	c
the	c
money	c
I	c
spent	c
in	i
the	c
tickets	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
one	c
hand	c
,	c
I	c
own	c
a	c
camera	c
that	c
I	c
often	c
use	c
during	c
leisure	i
times	i
.	c

I	c
have	c
recently	c
had	c
a	c
week	c
's	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
and	c
,	c
during	c
my	c
stay	c
,	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
'	c
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
'	c
,	c
which	c
was	c
shown	c
at	c
your	c
theatre	c
.	c

As	c
if	c
this	c
was	c
not	c
enough	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
instead	c
of	c
starting	c
at	c
half	c
past	c
seven	c
as	c
the	c
advertisement	c
said	c
,	c
started	c
at	c
a	c
quarter	c
past	c
eight	c
and	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
main	c
actors	c
,	c
who	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
be	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
was	c
someone	c
else	c
.	c

But	c
,	c
in	c
other	c
things	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
modern	c
technology	c
has	c
n't	c
changed	c
my	c
way	i
of	i
living	i
too	c
much	c
:	c
I	c
do	c
more	c
or	c
less	c
the	c
same	c
as	c
I	c
did	c
some	c
years	c
ago	c
:	c
I	c
get	c
up	c
in	c
the	c
morning	c
,	c
go	c
to	c
school	c
,	c
have	c
lunch	c
,	c
study	c
and	c
go	c
out	c
with	c
my	c
friends	c
without	c
being	c
afected	i
by	c
microchips	c
or	c
nuclear	c
energy	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
happily	c
received	c
your	c
reply	c
letter	i
and	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
this	c
marvelous	i
prize	c
you	c
have	c
given	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
just	c
received	c
your	c
letter	c
and	c
let	c
me	c
tell	c
you	c
what	c
you	c
missed	c
over	c
here	c
.	c

They	c
were	c
extremely	c
heavy	c
and	c
there	c
were	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
them	c
on	c
the	c
bus	c
.	c

Hope	c
to	c
hear	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

The	c
ones	c
I	c
'm	c
most	c
keen	c
on	c
are	c
Tennis	i
,	c
in	i
which	c
I	c
think	c
I	c
'm	c
pretty	c
good	c
since	c
I	c
took	c
some	c
classes	c
last	c
year	c
,	c
and	c
Painting	i
,	c
which	c
is	c
one	c
of	c
my	c
favourite	c
hobbies	c
,	c
and	c
helps	c
me	c
to	c
relax	c
myself	i
and	c
forget	c
about	c
problems	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
so	c
sorry	c
I	c
have	c
n't	c
written	c
until	c
now	c
,	c
but	c
you	c
know	c
I	c
'm	c
always	c
very	c
busy	c
.	c

I	c
also	c
choosed	i
painting	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
done	c
before	i
,	i
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
learn	c
and	c
moreover	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
do	c
a	c
calm	i
activity	c
.	c

Shopping	c
is	c
enjoyable	c
when	c
you	c
want	c
to	c
offer	i
some	i
thing	i
to	c
someone	c
.	c

Even	c
if	c
I	c
like	c
to	c
do	i
shopping	c
with	c
some	c
people	c
and	c
kind	i
of	c
shops	c
I	c
will	c
kill	c
myself	c
because	i
I	c
waste	c
my	c
time	c
.	c

Yours	c

How	i
will	i

Some	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
,	c

To	c
begin	c
with	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
.	c

Last	i
not	i
least	i
,	c
I	c
always	c
have	c
backache	c

a	c

of	c

Yours	c

Mee-Yon	c
Areum	c

Nowadays	c
shopping	c
can	c
be	c
very	c
stressful	c
.	c

After	c
the	c
show	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
disappointed	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
spent	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
money	c
for	c
nothing	c
and	c
my	c
husband	c
decided	c
to	c
make	i
me	i
a	i
pleasure	i
.	c

Firstable	i
,	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
come	i
see	c
your	c
show	c
to	c
be	c
pleased	i
by	c
the	c
act	i
of	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
as	i
I	c
was	c
so	i
sad	c
to	c
find	c
an	i
other	i
actor	c
on	c
the	c
stage	c
.	c

Another	c
thing	c
was	c
the	c
hours	i
.	c

In	c
fact	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
instead	c
of	c
19:30	c
.	c

The	c
manager	c
came	c
,	c
he	c
called	c
the	c
police	c
and	c
the	c
beginning	c
of	c
a	c
great	c
evening	c
,	i
ending	i
with	c
a	c
night	c
in	c
jail	c
and	c
an	c
expensive	c
fine	c
!	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
,	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
it	c
's	c
the	c
only	c
month	c
I	c
have	c
two	c
weeks	i
holiday	c
during	c
the	c
summer	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
excited	c
to	c
go	i
on	c
holliday	i
there	c
and	c
thanks	i
to	c
you	c
,	c
I	c
will	c
realize	c
a	c
dream	c
that	i
I	i
always	i
wanted	i
to	i
do	i
.	c

I	i
'd	i
enjoyed	i
helping	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
and	c
it	c
has	i
been	i
fabulous	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
astonished	c
to	c
see	c
so	i
friendly	c
and	c
funny	c
they	c
were	c
and	c
we	c
got	i
good	c
friends	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
difficult	c
to	c
explain	c
what	c
I	i
'd	i
particularly	i
liked	i
about	c
my	c
experience	c
because	c
the	i
most	i
memories	i
are	i
in	i
my	i
heart	i
and	c
I	c
'd	c
never	c
thought	c
that	c
I	c
could	c
get	c
on	c
so	c
well	c
with	c
a	c
group	c
of	c
people	c
which	i
I	c
'd	c
known	c
only	c
for	c
few	i
days	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
in	i
the	c
advertisement	c
was	i
written	c
,	c
as	c
I	c
had	c
read	c
that	i
before	c
,	c
that	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
would	c
be	c
starring	c
in	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
the	i
different	c
actor	c
stood	c
in	c
for	c
in	i
it	i
.	c

The	c
reason	c
was	c
unknown	c
.	c

At	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
the	c
advertisement	c
as	i
I	c
noticed	c
it	c
was	i
said	i
something	c
of	i
perfect	i
evening	c
out	c
.	c

They	c
show	i
the	c
latest	c
fashion	c
,	c
leisure	c
and	c
sportswear	c
ands	i
something	c
for	c
the	c
women	c
:	c
make	i
up	i
and	c
hairstyle	c
trends	c
.	c

Who	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
be	c
famous	c
?	c

I	c
have	i
always	c
thought	c
that	c
plays	i
of	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
are	c
worth	c
of	i
seeing	c
,	c
but	c
two	c
days	c
before	i
I	c
was	c
very	c
disappointed	c
after	c
visiting	c
yours	i
theatre	c
.	c

With	c
reference	c
to	c
your	c
letter	c
of	c
13th	i
of	c
June	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
the	c
prize	c
your	c
organisation	c
is	c
offering	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
be	c
grateful	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
book	c
a	c
tent	c
for	c
me	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
nature	c
lover	c
and	c
the	c
idea	c
of	c
outdoor-sleeping	i
really	c
makes	c
me	c
happy	c
.	c

Well	c
,	c
it	c
all	c
begun	i
when	c
Pat	c
's	c
friend	c
,	c
Molly	c
,	c
went	c
down	c
to	c
London	c
...	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
at	c
your	c
earliest	c
convenience	c
.	c

Frankly	c
,	c
if	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
money	c
I	c
would	c
have	i
spend	c
my	c
entire	c
life	c
to	i
do	i
shopping	c
.	c

According	c
to	c
the	c
advertisement	c
,	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
actor	i
who	c
had	i
to	i
show	i
was	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
but	c
for	c
some	c
unknown	c
reasons	c
,	c
there	c
was	c
another	c
disappointing	i
actor	c
instead	c
of	c
him	c
.	c

Your	i
sincerely	c

We	c
would	c
appreciate	c
it	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
give	c
us	c
a	c
chance	c
to	c
go	c
there	c
while	c
we	c
are	c
visiting	c
in	i
London	c
.	c

Especially	c
,	c
it	c
does	c
not	c
cost	c
at	i
all	c
for	c
students	c
.	c

Because	c
we	c
are	c
living	c
in	i
computerlised	i
life	c
,	c
so	i
we	c
'll	c
able	c
to	c
do	c
most	c
things	c
at	c
home	c
or	c
these	c
flats	c
'll	c
have	c
these	c
places	c
as	c
well	c
.	c

What	c
is	c
better	i
,	c
all	i
students	c
can	c
participate	c
without	c
paying	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
be	c
grateful	c
if	c
I	c
could	c
have	i
the	i
accomodation	i
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
:	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
not	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
because	c
of	c
my	c
height	c
,	i
I	c
am	c
so	c
tall	c
that	c
I	c
could	c
never	c
stand	c
up	c
.	c

Some	c
problems	c
of	c
organisation	c
seem	c
to	c
be	i
appeared	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
hoped	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
relaxing	c
entertainment	i
with	i
your	c
musical	i
show	c
but	c
it	i
was	i
not	i
the	i
case	i
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
without	c
using	c
internet	i
I	c
could	c
not	c
put	i
me	i
through	c
to	c
foreign	c
people	c
.	c

I	c
can	c
take	c
advantage	c
of	c
those	i
technologies	c
as	c
mobile	c
phone	i
,	c
lap	c
top	c
computer	i
,	c
television	i
,	c
to	c
have	c
contacts	i
with	c
different	c
cultures	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
it	c
could	c
have	i
an	c
inconvenient	i
for	c
me	c
because	c
of	c
pollution	c
from	c
cars	c
,	i
factories	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
had	c
sleeping	c
and	c
breathing	c
problems	c
in	c
tents	c
which	c
were	c
serious	c
.	c

What	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
will	c
I	c
need	c
?	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
your	c
reply	c

This	c
part	c
had	c
to	c
be	c
saved	c
for	c
later	c
because	c
the	c
concert	c
orginazer	i
wanted	c
to	c
know	c
the	c
exactly	i
number	c
of	c
visitors	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
's	c
because	c
the	c
last	c
time	c
I	c
travelled	c
(	c
with	c
my	c
friends	c
)	c
,	c
we	c
stayed	c
at	i
log	c
cabins	c
,	c
and	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
sleeping	c
felt	i
some	i
thing	i
moving	c
in	i
my	c
skin	c
,	c
then	c
I	c
work	i
up	c
frightened	c
and	c
when	c
I	c
openned	i
my	c
eyes	c
,	c
I	c
saw	c
lots	c
of	c
big	c
ants	c
!	c

Dear	c
Tina	c
,	c

Then	c
I	c
said	c
"	i
OK	c
,	c
I	c
promise	c
!	c
"	c
(	c
frightened	c
,	c
of	c
course	c
)	c
.	c

Because	c
the	c
store	c
manager	c
told	c
him	c
that	c
I	c
was	c
the	c
best	c
hairdresser	c
in	c
the	c
city	c
!	c

And	c
his	c
hairdresser	c
was	c
sick	c
,	c
so	c
he	c
and	c
his	c
producers	c
were	c
looking	c
for	c
one	c

-	c
I	c
could	i
prefer	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
as	c
this	c
is	c
the	c
only	c
time	c
I	c
can	c
take	c
my	c
annual	c
leave	c
.	c

Generations	c
of	c
young	c
South	c
Africans	c
black	i
,	c
white	c
or	c
brown	c
will	i
be	c
reminded	c
of	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
worst	c
times	c
their	c
country	c
went	c
through	c
.	c

My	c
parents	c
are	c
very	c
good	c
.	c

This	c
is	c
the	c
only	c
condition	c
to	i
do	i
what	c
I	c
prefer	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
for	i
you	i
answering	i
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
modern	i
technology	c
changed	i
our	c
daily	c
life	c
tremendously	c
.	c

Another	c
problem	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
in	i
the	i
place	i
of	c
19:30	c
and	c
when	c
it	c
finished	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
have	c
a	i
dinner	c
because	c
the	c
theatre	c
's	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
(	c
it	c
closes	c
at	c
22:00	c
)	c
.	c

How	i
it	i
was	i
explained	i
above	i
,	i
I	i
'm	i
not	i
satisfied	i
and	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
be	c
refund	i

She	c
's	c
the	c
sister	c
of	c
my	c
ex-girlfriend	c
which	i
is	c
called	c
Eingrid	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
really	c
very	c
unlucked	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
on	c
behalf	c
of	c
my	c
class	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
about	i
the	c
programme	c
you	c
organised	c
for	c
our	c
trip	c
to	c
London	c

Terror	c
in	c
the	c
Alps	c

My	c
friend	c
fell	c
down	c
and	c
badly	c
hit	c
his	c
leg	c
against	c
a	c
rock	c
.	c

He	c
could	c
n't	c
move	c
any	c
more	c
and	c
my	c
mobilephone	i
was	c
not	c
able	c
to	c
find	c
a	c
proper	c
network	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
dangerous	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
steepness	c
of	c
the	c
slope	c
and	c
we	c
risked	c
falling	c
down	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
.	c

I	c
no	i
thought	i
,	i
that	c
so	c
serious	c
theatre	i
makes	i
such	c
mistakes	c
.	c

What	c
will	c
clothes	c
be	c
like	c
100	c
years	c
from	c
now	c
?	c

Young	c
people	c
will	c
wear	c
jeans	c
and	c
T-shirt	i
.	c

As	c
you	c
are	c
probably	c
aware	c
of	i
our	c
English	c
class	c
is	c
going	c
to	c
spend	c
three	c
days	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

Well	c
,	c
having	c
read	c
the	c
book	c
before	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
say	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
great	c
idea	c
!	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
's	c
all	c
about	c
it	c
.	c

As	c
we	c
have	c
seen	c
the	c
advertisment	i
of	i
the	c
programmed	i
the	c
school	c
set	i
for	c
us	c
as	c
a	c
farewell	c
activities	i
,	c
we	c
are	c
very	c
appreciate	i
and	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
for	i
your	c
kindness	c
,	c
as	c
all	c
of	c
them	i
are	c
very	c
interesting	c
and	c
give	c
us	c
a	c
chance	c
to	c
meet	c
and	c
join	i
the	c
other	c
class	c
which	i
we	c
hardly	i
done	i
it	i
before	i
.	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
most	c
of	c
the	i
famouse	i
brand	c
of	c
sport	c
were	c
companies	c
will	i
join	i
in	c
this	c
exhibition	c
with	c
their	c
new	i
product	i
for	c
the	c
coming	c
season	c
.	c

We	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
if	c
all	c
of	c
us	c
can	c
join	i
in	i
this	c
event	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
true	c
that	c
small	c
dog	c
were	i
in	c
danger	c
,	c
but	c
your	c
life	c
was	i
in	c
that	c
situation	c
as	c
well	c
once	c
you	c
decide	i
to	c
do	c
that	c
brave	c
thing	c
.	c

If	c
that	c
of	i
course	i
is	c
possible	c
.	c

'	c
It	c
was	c
dangerous	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
knew	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
'	c

We	c
thought	c
with	i
that	c
beutiful	i
weather	c
the	c
seeside	i
is	i
just	c
perfect	c
for	c
relax	i
,	c
sunbathing	c
and	c
joy	i
.	c

Then	c
again	i
in	c
a	c
few	c
minutes	c
the	c
weather	c
changed	c
and	c
strong	i
storm	c
begun	i
.	c

The	c
sky	c
went	c
completly	i
black	c
,	c
so	c
at	c
first	c
it	c
was	c
difficult	c
to	c
see	c
,	i
where	c
everybody	c
is	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
not	c
satisfied	c
with	c
the	c
service	c
we	c
received	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
therefore	c
writing	c
for	i
a	c
full	c
refund	c
and	c
I	c
expect	c
to	c
receive	c
by	i
post	i
a	i
cheque	i
for	c
£	c
20	c
.	c

LIKE	c
BLIND	c
SHEEP	c

The	c
thing	c
is	c
we	c
are	c
too	c
fashion	c
conscious	c
,	c
too	c
fussy	c
about	c
our	c
appearance	c
and	c
we	c
'll	c
end	c
up	c
forking	i
out	i
for	i
smart	c
clothes	c
only	c
because	c
the	c
people	c
next	c
door	c
are	c
doing	c
so	c
!	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
,	c

We	c
know	c
that	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
good	c
chance	c
for	c
us	c
to	c
learn	c
more	c
different	c
things	c
and	c
can	i
widen	c
our	c
knowledge	c
in	c
the	c
Science	c
Museum	c
.	c

So	c
we	c
decide	i
to	c
choose	c
the	i
other	i
programme	i
which	i
have	i
seen	i
as	i
an	i
entertainment	i
.	c

Personally	i
,	c
here	c
is	i
my	i
some	c
suggestions	c
about	c
how	c
the	c
programme	c
could	c
be	c
changed	c
.	c

On	i
the	c
advertisment	i
was	i
written	i
'	i
DISCOUNTS	i
AVAILABLE	i
'	i
shall	c
I	c
ask	c
you	c
one	c
question	c
?	c
-	c
Why	c
they	i
were	i
n't	i
available	c
?	c

Nevertheless	c
after	i
the	c
show	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
hungry	c
so	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
restarrant	i
and	c
what	c
I	i
've	i
seen	i
?	c

Many	c
things	c
have	c
been	c
replaced	c
by	c
the	i
others	c
which	c
are	c
more	c
helpful	c
and	c
useful	c
.	c

Further	i
more	i
you	c
can	c
play	c
with	c
the	c
computer	c
,	c
and	c
unfortunetly	i
this	c
advantage	i
has	i
especially	i
changed	c
my	c
life	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
there	c
were	c
too	c
few	c
plays	c
and	c
films	c
.	c

Visitors	c
could	c
learn	i
plays	c
with	c
professionals	c
.	c

I	c
suggest	c
you	c
to	i
increase	i
this	c
number	c
for	c
the	i
next	c
year	c
.	c

Last	i
thing	c
that	c
I	c
will	c
say	c
is	c
"	c
one	c
reasonably-priced	c
weekend	c
ticket	c
"	c
.	i

May	i
be	i
we	c
can	c
meet	c
there	c
...	c

We	c
must	c
n't	c
forget	c
the	c
books	c
for	c
the	c
classes	c
.	c

I	c
must	c
be	c
in	i
home	c
untill	i
11pm	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
also	c
like	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
about	c
my	c
free-time	c
activities	c
.	c

Although	c
we	c
are	c
excited	c
about	c
the	c
scientic	i
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
you	i
to	i
ask	i
,	i
if	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
possible	c
to	c
change	c
our	c
schedule	c
a	c
little	c
bit	c
.	c

Thing	i
which	c
attract	c
us	c
the	c
most	c
are	c
:	i
'	c
Make	i
up	i
'	c
and	c
'	c
Hairstyles	c
'	c
.	c

They	c
are	c
always	c
attacted	i
by	c
naughty	c
journalists	c
,	c
which	c
have	c
aspiration	i
to	c
earn	c
big	c
money	c
for	c
writing	c
an	c
extremaly	i
good	c
report	c
,	i
or	c
article	c
.	c

In	c
spite	c
of	c
being	c
incredibly	c
famous	c
,	c
they	c
might	c
feel	c
very	c
anxiously	i
and	c
lonely	c
.	c

We	c
've	c
read	c
an	c
advertisement	c
about	c
London	i
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
which	c
will	c
take	c
place	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
,	c
March	c
14	c
from	c
10	i
oo	i
to	c
19	i
oo	i

The	c
latest	c
fashions	c
will	c
be	c
shown	c
there	c
and	c
many	c
useful	c
tips	c
about	c
make-up	c
and	c
hairstyles	c
will	c
be	c
given	c
.	c

They	c
are	c
always	c
expected	c
to	c
be	c
beautiful	c
,	c
intelligent	c
,	c
good-looking	c
.	c

This	c
is	c
very	c
stressful	c
.	c

That	c
's	c
why	c
it	c
's	c
very	c
important	c
for	c
these	c
people	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
private	c
life	c
without	c
journalists	c
where	c
they	c
can	c
relax	c
and	c
where	c
they	c
do	c
n't	c
need	c
to	c
be	c
superstars	c

are	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
part	c
of	c
what	c
school	c
wants	c
to	c
provide	c
us	c
.	i

And	c
especially	c
the	c
practical	c
work	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
will	c
take	c
my	c
proposal	c
in	i
favoreable	i
consideration	c

I	c
am	c

When	c
we	c
got	c
there	c
we	c
were	c
wearing	c
our	c
costumes	c

So	c
I	c
took	c
the	c
decision	c
to	c
go	c
and	c
join	c
them	c
also	i
if	i
I	c
knew	c
that	c
it	c
would	c
have	i
been	i
dangerous	c

my	i

Yours	c
sincerely	i

I	c
was	c
in	c
Love	c
but	c
that	c
was	c

From	c
that	c
moment	c
I	c
feel	i

I	c
have	i
been	c
in	c
front	c
of	c
a	c
video	c
camera	c
and	c
the	c
operator	c
of	c
it	c
is	i
me	c

It	c
would	c
be	c
better	c
if	c
people	c
have	i
had	i
the	c
possibility	i
to	c
let	i
their	c
cars	c
very	c
near	c
to	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

Mark	c
and	c
his	c
family	c
decided	c
to	c
go	c
for	c
a	c
walk	c
in	c
the	c
Alps	c
.	c

After	c
that	c
,	c
marks	i
father	c
who	i
had	i
fluent	c
traditional	c
Swiss	c
language	c
spent	i
time	c
with	c
an	c
old	c
woman	c
he	c
had	c
just	c
met	c
near	c
the	c
house	c
.	c

Firstly	c
I	i
can	c
travel	c
only	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
I	c
'm	c
studying	c
at	c
college	c
until	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
June	c
and	c
in	c
August	c
I	c
'm	c
travelling	c
Greece	i
for	c
one	c
months	i
.	c

Generally	c
women	i
like	c
shopping	c
.	c

They	c
do	c
n't	c
fancy	c
going	c
into	c
the	c
crowdy	i
shop	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
very	c
boring	c
and	c
tiring	c
to	c
be	c
kept	c
waiting	c
.	c

They	c
are	c
much	c
more	c
confortable	i
than	c
tents	c
.	c

What	c
I	c
liked	c
the	c
most	c
about	c
it	c
is	c
not	c
the	c
fact	c
that	c
we	c
raised	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
money	c
,	c
but	c
that	c
we	c
enjoyed	c
of	i
an	c
amazing	c
show	c
in	c
which	c
I	c
took	c
active	i
part	c
.	c

The	c
band	c
thanked	c
me	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
calling	c
them	c
and	c
having	c
everything	c
so	c
well	c
organized	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
told	c
to	i
be	i
able	c
to	c
get	c
discounts	c
,	c
however	c
,	c
I	c
could	c
not	c
get	c
any	c
.	c

From	c
the	c
time	c
she	c
began	c
the	i
university	c
,	c
the	c
problems	c
began	c
.	c

One	c
day	c
,	c
her	c
friends	c
got	c
fed	c
up	c
with	c
this	c
and	c
ended	c
their	c
friendship	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
this	c
friend	c
told	c
this	c
to	c
some	c
other	c
people	c
and	c
when	c
it	c
was	c
understood	c
that	c
Pam	c
was	c
guilty	c
,	c
she	c
was	c
fired	c
.	c

She	c
had	c
no	c
friends	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
a	c
tourist	c
and	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
week	c
's	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
a	i
few	i
time	c
ago	c
.	c

I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
at	c
19.30	c
o'clock	i
but	c
,	c
with	i
my	i
surprise	i
,	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
and	c
so	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
remain	c
here	i
until	c
the	c
end	c
because	c
I	c
left	i
London	c
,	c
with	c
my	c
group	c
before	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

The	c
star	c
,	c
the	c
actor	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
there	i
was	c
n't	c
in	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
but	c
there	c
was	c
an	i
other	i
actor	c
,	c
with	i
my	i
great	i
disappoint	i
.	c

The	c
advirtisement	i
I	c
had	c
read	c
did	c
not	c
match	i
the	c
performance	c
.	c

That	c
was	c
very	c
disappointing	c
.	c

My	c
"	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
"	c
was	c
not	c
so	c
perfect	c
and	c
could	c
not	c
satisfy	c
me	c
in	c
any	c
way	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

Modern	c
technology	c
has	c
variety	i
of	c
uses	c
and	c
its	c
possibilities	c
are	c
being	c
widened	c
more	c
and	c
more	c
.	c

The	c
only	c
effect	c
on	c
me	c
is	c
more	c
often	i
disagreements	c
with	c
my	c
parents	c
.	c

It	c
would	c
be	c
nice	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
tent	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
been	c
camping	c
and	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
try	c
it	c
,	c
at	c
least	c
once	c
.	c

My	c
second	c
choice	c
is	c
climbing	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
climbed	c
and	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
go	c
at	c
it	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

What	c
you	c
expect	c
when	c
you	c
go	c
shopping	c
,	c
generally	c
with	c
a	c
friend	c
or	c
two	c
,	c
is	c
wandering	i
around	c
and	c
looking	i
at	c
everything	c

The	c
London	c
Fashion	c
And	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
is	c
taking	c
place	c
in	c
Central	i
Exhibition	c
Hall	c
in	c
London	c
and	c
happens	i
on	c
Tuesday	c
March	c
14	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
dangerous	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
did	c
not	c
have	c
any	c
choice	c
since	c
my	c
brother	c
was	c
in	c
trouble	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
got	c
close	c
to	c
the	c
shop	c
,	c
I	c
checked	c
if	c
anyone	c
was	c
around	c
and	c
luckily	c
was	i
not	i
.	c

I	c
got	c
into	c
the	c
car	c
gave	i
the	c
jewelry	i
in	c
exchange	c
of	i
my	c
brother	c
,	c
took	c
him	c
and	c
left	c
the	c
place	c
.	c

The	c
future	c
is	c
unexpectable	i
and	c
human	c
beings	c
are	c
afriad	i
of	c
dangers	c
,	c
such	c
as	c
tornado	i
or	c
earthquake	i
.	c

What	c
we	c
really	c
need	c
in	c
the	c
next	c
millenium	i
is	c
love	c
,	c
that	c
is	c
what	c
will	c
keep	c
all	c
family	i
together	c
and	i
forever	c
.	c

What	c
depends	c
on	c
us	c
,	c
is	c
how	i
atmospher	i
we	c
will	c
have	c
in	c
our	c
houses	c
.	c

We	c
cannot	i
aware	i
future	c
technologe	i
,	c
but	c
we	c
might	c
still	c
have	c
some	c
feelings	c
to	i
eachothers	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
learn	c
playing	i
golf	c
at	c
the	c
Camp	c
.	c

Dear	c
Kim	c

As	c
you	c
know	c

I	c
love	c
