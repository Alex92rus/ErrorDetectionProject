The	c
shopping	c
time	c
could	c
be	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
and	c
the	c
free	c
time	c
exchanged	c
for	c
the	c
science	c
museum	c
.	c

If	c
we	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
we	c
can	c
do	c
without	c
the	c
free	c
time	c
.	c

In	c
a	c
country	c
like	c
the	c
UK	c
,	c
we	c
are	c
all	c
bound	c
to	c
have	c
houses	c
.	c

Think	c
about	c
the	c
people	c
in	c
the	c
poor	c
countries	c
!	c

They	c
struggle	c
to	c
survive	c

For	c

the	c
future	c
homes	i
might	c
not	c
be	c
built	c
out	c

The	c
future	c
homes	c
will	c
also	c
have	c
many	c
similarities	c
,	c
such	c
as	c
having	c
a	c

not	c

It	c
has	c
been	c
a	c
pleasure	c

Recently	c
I	c
was	c
at	c
the	c
annual	c
international	c

that	c
you	c

I	c
think	c

you	c
should	c
make	i
some	c

May	i
be	i
you	c
should	c

Dear	c

Look	i
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
,	c

Now	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
assure	c
you	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c

'	c
I	c
had	i
heard	i
what	c

said	c
about	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
on	i
July	c
because	c
of	i
it	c
is	c
more	c
suitable	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Everything	c
were	i
new	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
just	c
did	c
not	c
enjoyed	i
when	i
they	c
were	c
making	i
the	i
instruments	i
work	c
for	c
the	c
big	c
day	c
.	c

The	c
festival	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
be	c
an	c
international	c
one	c
,	c
but	c
the	c
artists	c
and	c
stars	c
participated	i
in	c
it	c
were	c
from	c
six	c
countries	c
only	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
much	c
better	c
to	c
use	c
bigger	c
concert	c
halls	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
suggest	c
you	c
have	c
various	c
kinds	c
,	c
and	c
more	c
numbers	i
of	i
plays	c
and	c
films	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

The	c
Old	c
Man	c
and	c
the	c
Sea	c

When	c
he	c
caught	c
a	c
shark	c
which	c
was	c
bigger	c
than	c
the	c
ship	c
,	c
he	c
never	c
gave	c
up	c
taking	i
it	c
back	c
to	c
his	c
village	c
,	c
even	c
when	c
sharks	c
were	c
around	c
him	c
.	c

Real	c
stories	c
have	c
huge	c
impacts	c
on	c
me	c
,	c
and	c
affect	c
me	c
a	c
lot	c
,	c
often	c
in	c
good	c
ways	c
.	c

So	c
when	c
I	c
read	c
other	i
sharks	c
eating	c
the	c
shark	c
the	c
old	c
man	c
had	c
caught	c
,	c
I	c
got	c
very	c
angry	c
and	c
annoyed	c
.	c

We	c
all	c
learn	c
from	c
reading	c
books	c
,	c
but	c
realistic	c
stories	c
have	c
more	c
influence	c
on	c
me	c
and	c
develop	c
my	c
personality	c
.	c

That	c
's	c
why	c
I	c
prefer	c
realistic	c
stories	c
to	c
unusual	c
ones	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
seen	c
the	i
advertisement	c
that	c
the	c
actors	c
were	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
.	c

The	c
musical	c
should	c
started	i
at	c
19.30	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
20.15	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
seen	c
the	c
advertisement	c
say	i
that	c
discount	i
available	i
.	c

This	c
was	c
not	c
perfect	i
evening	c
for	c
me	c
,	c
so	c
if	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
give	c
my	i
money	c
back	c
,	c
I	c
will	c
tell	c
to	i
the	c
newspaper	c
about	c
it	c
.	c

IT	c
WAS	c
CLOSED	c
!	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
tents	c
to	c
log	c
cabins	c

Our	c
lives	c
are	c
getting	c
better	c
and	c
better	c
,	c
so	c
people	c
began	i
to	c
go	c
shopping	c
more	c
frequently	c

In	c
fashion	i
industry	c
,	c
sale	i
begins	i
at	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
each	c
season	c
and	c
just	c
lasts	i
a	c
short	c
time	c
,	c
because	c
those	c
owners	i
want	c
to	c
make	c
room	c
for	c
new	c
stock	c
.	c

Also	c
supermarket	c
owners	c
have	c
put	i
in	i
a	c
vast	c
amount	c
of	c
money	c
to	c
find	c
out	c
the	c
best	c
way	c
to	c
place	c
goods	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
get	c
the	c
most	c
profit	c

You	i

the	i

and	i
the	i

to	i

and	c
what	c

we	c

then	c
?	c

If	c

I	c
went	c
to	c
see	c
it	c
on	c
5th	c

2000	c

I	c
am	c
really	c
not	c
satisfied	c
with	c
the	c
show-organization	i
particularly	c
because	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
you	c
wrote	c
something	c
different	i

Anna	c
prepared	i
the	c

I	c

I	c
would	c

unkind	c
but	c
I	c
must	c
say	c
that	c
the	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c

included	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
false	c
information	c

Your	i
faithfully	c

Mr.	i
Manager	c
:	i

Firstly	c
when	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
show	c
it	c
was	c
writing	i
that	c
the	c
starting	i
time	c
was	c
19.30	c
but	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
quarter	c
past	c
eight	c
I	i
had	c
waitted	i
for	c
fourthey	i
five	i
minutes	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

She	c
saw	c
me	c
as	c
I	c
was	c
smoking	c
so	c
that	c
was	c
n't	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
very	c
good	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
really	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
a	c
police	c
car	c
drove	c
by	c
and	c
the	c
policeman	c
saw	c
me	c
standing	c
there	c
nude	c
.	c

There	c
I	c
called	c
Pat	c
who	c
picked	c
me	c
up	c
.	c

If	c
only	c
Pat	c
could	c
keep	c
secrets	c
!	c

My	c
dream	c

I	c
had	c
always	c
wanted	c
to	c
swim	c
in	i
the	i
middle	i
of	i
sharks	c
.	c

I	c
grew	c
up	c
through	i
the	i
water	i
world	i
and	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
live	c
whitout	i
it	c
.	c

Once	c
I	c
was	c
fishing	c
,	i
when	c
sharks	c
came	i
all	c
around	c
me	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
you	c
spoke	c
about	c
two	c
actors	c
Danny	i
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
,	c
instead	i
of	c
them	c
we	c
had	c
two	c
others	c
and	c
they	c
were	c
really	c
bad	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
to	c
this	c
you	c
started	c
the	c
show	c
45	c
minutes	c
late	c
.	c

No	c
discounts	c
were	c
available	c
.	c

Then	c
you	c
offered	i
people	c
to	c
visit	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
there	c
is	i
no	c
staff	c
to	c
welcome	c
the	i
people	c
.	c

yours	c
sincerely	c

O.	c
Labro	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

My	c
Mum	c
was	c
at	c
home	c
and	c
I	c
told	c
her	c
all	i
the	i
story	c
.	c

The	c
good	c
always	c
wins	i
,	c
and	c
we	c
are	c
told	c
that	c
the	c
other	c
part	c
is	c
bad	c
,	c
and	c
that	c
is	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
the	c
story	c
.	c

On	i
the	c
tale	c
"	c
It	c
's	c
a	c
good	c
life	c
"	c
,	c
the	c
author	c
gives	c
much	c
more	c
emphasis	c
to	c
the	i
Witte	c
Anthony	c
than	c
to	c
anyone	c
else	c
in	c
the	c
story	c
.	c

I	c
felt	c
nervous	c
.	c

When	c
it	c
comes	c
to	c
modern	c
technology	c
,	c
I	c
grately	c
appreciate	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
not	c
get	c
them	i
.	c

I	c
have	i
been	i
imagining	i
where	c
another	i
contries	i
are	c
like	c
England	c
.	c

Now	c
I	c
am	c
in	c
England	c

I	i
know	i
a	i
ship	i
but	i
an	i
airplane	i
made	i
an	i
arrival	i
to	i
here	i
be	i
quick	i
.	i

Whenever	c
I	c
do	c
not	c
know	c
about	c
something	c
,	c
I	c
phone	c
and	i
ask	c
it	i
.	c

I	c
arrived	c
at	c
the	c
theatre	c
at	c
19.00	c
and	c
I	c
thought	c
I	c
'd	c
have	c
waited	c
only	c
thirty	c
minutes	c
.	c

I	c
waited	c
more	c
than	c
one	c
hour	c
because	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
at	c
20.15	c
.	c

I	c
'd	c
like	c
not	c
only	c
to	c
reply	i
but	c
also	c
to	c
have	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
because	c
my	c
evening	c
was	c
n't	c
"	c
perfect	c
"	c
as	c
you	c
advertised	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
big	c
disaster	c
.	c

Every	c
aspect	c
of	c
our	c
daily	c
life	c
is	c
influenced	c
by	c
technology	c
.	c

Then	c
I	c
go	c
to	c
work	c
by	c
motorbike	c
.	c

Sometime	i
I	c
stay	i
alone	c
all	c
the	i
day	c
but	c
I	c
have	c
contacts	i
with	c
many	c
people	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
finish	c
to	i
work	i
I	c
come	c
back	c
home	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c

The	c
students	c
are	c
especially	c
very	i
happy	c
about	c
the	c
visit	c
to	c
the	c
Science	c
Museum	c
,	c
which	c
we	c
are	c
going	c
to	c
do	i
on	c
tuesday	i
morning	c
of	i
14th	c
March	c
.	c

I	i
'll	i
hope	i
that	c
this	c
matter	c
does	i
n't	i
going	c
to	c
cause	c
you	c
any	c
problems	c
and	c
we	c
hope	c
for	c
an	c
answer	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
everyone	c
should	c
not	i
think	i
just	c
about	c
the	c
positive	c
sides	i
with	i
technologi	i
but	c
also	c
the	c
negative	c
.	c

Consequently	c
,	c
I	c
ask	c
for	c
money	i
back	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
will	c
not	i
obviously	i
go	c
back	c
in	i
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
.	c

Over	c
the	c
last	c
five	c
years	c
,	c
she	c
had	i
caused	c
many	c
arguments	c
because	c
of	c
unkept	c
secrets	c
,	c
but	c
she	c
could	c
n't	c
help	c
speaking	c
to	c
everybody	c
.	c

Bobby	c
did	c
n't	c
use	c
to	c
commit	c
such	c
acts	c
and	c
the	c
story	c
looked	i
very	c
strange	c
.	c

Pat	c
knew	c
there	c
was	c
no	c
solving	c
the	c
problem	c
without	c
the	c
adults	i
'	i
help	i
.	c

It	c
was	c
the	c
first	c
time	c
she	c
had	c
saved	c
someone	c
telling	i
a	c
secret	c
,	c
and	c
she	c
realized	c
she	c
had	c
made	c
the	i
good	c
choice	c
.	c

We	c
have	c
seen	c
an	c
advertisment	i
for	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
in	c
a	c
newspaper	c
.	c

We	c
all	c
expect	c
the	c
trip	c
to	c
London	c
to	c
be	c
exiting	i
and	c
hope	c
to	c
get	i
unforgettable	c
memories	c

Our	c
life	c
is	c
changing	c
every	c
day	c
.	c

With	c
new	c
computer	c
technology	c
nothing	c
is	c
impossible	c
.	c

You	c
could	c
tell	c
your	c
wardrobe	c
what	c
clothes	c
you	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
wear	c
,	c
your	c
hob	c
will	c
cook	c
your	c
preferable	i
meals	c
and	c
your	c
refigerator	i
will	c
send	c
orders	c
to	c
the	c
supermarkets	c
to	c
buy	c
the	c
food	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
.	i

Recently	c
,	c
some	c
students	c
have	c
seen	c
an	c
advertisment	i
about	c
a	c
fashion	c
and	c
leisure	c
show	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

We	c
also	i
can	i
suggest	c
how	c
the	c
originally	i
programme	c
can	c
be	c
changed	c
.	c

We	c
will	c
have	c
free	c
time	c
on	c
Wednesday	c
afternoon	c
.	c

So	c
we	c
can	c
do	i
shopping	c
instead	c
.	c

Because	c
there	c
was	c
a	c
man	c
had	i
a	c
serious	c
car	c
accident	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
walking	c
pass	i
him	c
.	c

I	c
have	i
n't	i
got	c
my	c
mobile	c
phone	c
with	c
me	c
And	i
I	c
was	c
half	i
way	i
between	c
my	c
school	c
and	c
home	c
.	c

At	c
that	c
time	c
he	c
was	c
unconcious	i
,	i
I	c
kept	c
asking	c
myself	c
'	c
should	i
I	c
wake	c
him	c
up	c
or	c
try	c
to	c
use	c
my	c
unsure	i
first	c
aid	c
skill	i
to	c
deal	i
with	c
him	c
.	c

I	c
phoned	c
to	i
police	i
And	i
told	c
the	i
whole	c
story	c
.	c

I	c
AM	c
WRITIN	i
TO	c
YOU	c
IN	c
ORDER	c
TO	c
GIVE	c
A	c
REPLY	c
TO	c
THE	c
KIND	c
LETTER	c
I	c
RECEIVED	c
FROM	c
YOU	c
.	c

IN	c
YOUR	c
LETTER	c
YOU	c
ASKED	c
ME	c
WHETHER	c
I	c
WOULD	c
PREFER	c
,	i
IF	i
A	c
TENT	c
OR	c
A	c
LONG	i
CABIN	c
.	c

WELL	c
,	c
THE	c
ANSWER	c
IS	c
A	c
LONG	i
CABIN	c
,	c
BECAUSE	c
I	c
HAVE	c
A	c
PROBLEM	c
WITH	c
MY	c
BACK	c
.	c

WELL	c
,	c
THE	c
FIRST	c
THING	c
I	c
WANT	c
TO	c
TELL	c
YOU	c
IS	c
ABOUT	c
THE	c
POP	c
CONCERT	c
WE	c
HAD	c
,	c
LAST	c
FRIDAY	c
,	c
HERE	c
IN	c
OUR	c
CITY	c
.	c

AS	c
YOU	c
KNOW	c
,	c
I	c
AM	c
A	c
SOUND	c
TECHNICH	i
,	c
SO	c
I	c
HELP	i
THEM	c
TO	c
PUT	i
THE	c
SOUND	c
EQUIPMENTS	i
AND	c
THE	c
INSTRUMENTS	c
PROPERLY	c
.	c

I	i
WAS	c
ALREADY	i
SPECIAL	c
TIME	c
FOR	c
ME	c
!	c

THEN	c
,	c
WHEN	c
THE	c
CONCERT	c
STARTED	c
;	i
THE	c
ORGANISERS	c
GAVE	c
ME	c
AN	c
IDENTITY	c
CARD	c
,	c
ONLY	i
FOR	c
MEMBERS	c
OF	c
THE	c
STAFF	c
.	c

But	c
in	c
fact	c
it	c
is	c
not	c
!	c

I	c
had	c
a	c
very	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
.	c

I	c
supposed	i
to	c
see	c
the	c
famous	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
and	c
what	c
a	c
surprise	c
it	c
was	c
not	i
him	c
.	c

Secondly	c
the	c
show	c
had	i
go	i
on	i
19.30	c
pm.	c
In	c
fact	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
20.15	c
pm	c
without	c
any	c
explanations	i
.	c

So	c
please	c
,	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
fair	c
,	i
that	i
you	c
give	i
my	i
money	c
back	c
.	c

"	c
What	c
will	c
clothes	c
be	c
like	c
100	c
years	c
from	c
now	c
?	c
"	c

You	c
will	c
find	i
always	i
basic	i
clothes	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
the	c
materials	c
which	c
will	c
change	c
.	c

Fashion	c
is	c
always	c
the	c
same	c
!	c

Dear	c
Ms	c
Ryan	c
,	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
your	c

informed	c

that	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
for	i
two	c
weeks	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
in	c
the	c
U.S.A.	c
Here	c
are	i
some	c
information	c
as	c
requested	c
.	c

Please	c
noted	i
that	c
I	c
can	c
only	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
of	c
summer	i
holiday	c
shut	i
down	i
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hear	i
from	c
you	c
and	c
if	c
you	c
need	c
more	c
information	c
,	c
please	c
do	c
not	c
hesitate	c
to	c
contact	c
me	c
.	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

Why	c
do	c
you	c
put	c
on	i
the	c
paper	c
then	c
?	c

After	c
waiting	c
a	c
while	c
in	c
this	c
uncomfortable	c
place	i
the	c
show	c
started	c
,	i
I	c
waited	c
45	c
minutes	c
and	c
then	c
the	c
actors	c
appeared	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
find	i
myself	i
that	c
the	c
main	c
one	c
was	c
n't	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
an	c
impostor	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

But	c
there	c
was	c
a	c
little	c
problem	c
and	c
it	c
was	c
that	c
my	c
parent	i
's	i
did	c
n't	c
let	c
me	c
go	c
alone	i
to	i
disco	i
's	i
,	c
so	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
go	c
illegaly	i
,	c
and	c
I	c
decided	c
I	c
would	c
do	c
it	c
.	c

To	c
sumarize	i
the	c
night	c
I	i
am	c
going	c
steady	c
with	c
him	c
,	c
and	c
he	c
took	c
me	c
home	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

Then	c
I	c
found	c
out	c
that	c
the	c
discounts	c
are	i
not	c
available	c
but	c
on	c
the	c
notice	c
board	c
,	i
it	c
said	c
that	c
they	c
are	i
available	c

my	c
daily	c

because	c
when	i
I	c

I	c

most	c
of	c
my	c

basketball	c
but	c
now	c
,	i
I	c
just	c
play	c
on	c
the	c
computers	c
all	c
day	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
great	c

Among	c
those	c
activities	c
that	i
you	c
told	c
me	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
choose	c
I	c
prefer	c
singing	c
and	c
painting	c

I	c

I	c
am	c
a	c
woman	c
then	i
I	c
love	c
it	c
a	c
lot	c

I	c
bought	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
shoes	c
,	c
clothes	c
and	c
books	c
last	c
week	c
.	c

He	c
told	c
me	c
that	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
stupid	c
.	c

I	c
decided	c
to	c
stop	c
buying	c
those	c
things	c
that	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
really	c
need	c
.	c

We	c
are	c
different	c

I	c
believe	c
him	c
because	c
he	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
man	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
the	c
accommodation	c
in	i
tents	c

About	c
the	c
activities	c
,	c
I	c
chose	c
swimming	c
and	c
climbing	c

Although	c
I	c
'm	c
not	c
good	c
at	c
climbing	c

I	c

Also	c

if	c
I	c
can	c

what	c

At	i

also	c
I	c

with	c
the	i

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
you	i
to	c
make	c
a	c
complaint	c
on	i
your	c
advertisement	c
,	c
which	c
I	c
consider	c
like	i
a	c
lying	c
advertisement	c
.	c

Let	c
me	c
explain	c
you	i
why	c
I	c
'm	c
now	c
so	c
disappointed	c
.	c

We	c
've	c
already	c
attended	i
"	c
Cats	c
"	c
,	c
the	c
"	c
Phantom	c
of	c
the	c
Opera	c
"	c
,	c
"	c

and	c
so	c
many	c
others	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
waiting	i
evening	c
,	c
at	i
the	i
entrance	i
stood	i
people	i
,	i
who	c
were	c
shouting	c
at	c
you	c
because	c
there	c
was	i
n't	i
any	c
discounts	c
available	c
.	c

I	c
can	c
say	c
now	c
that	c
"	c
It	c
was	c
n't	c
my	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
"	c
and	c
I	c
request	i
now	i
some	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

I	c
wish	i
that	c
my	c
article	c
comes	i
in	c
your	c
magazine	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
some	c
advice	c
about	c
the	c
International	c
Arts	c
festival	i
.	c

For	c
musics	i
like	c
jazz	c
and	c
rock	c
it	i
was	c
excellent	c
but	c
for	c
classical	c
concerts	c
we	c
had	c
a	c
problem	c
.	c

Because	c
some	c
concert	c
halls	c
were	c
too	c
small	c
.	c

Do	c
not	c
change	c
about	i
talks	i
by	c
writers	c
,	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
good	c
idea	c
if	c
people	c
can	c
talk	c
about	c
their	c
owns	i
books	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	i
,	c

We	c
took	i
a	i
car	i
.	c

After	c
that	c
,	c
it	i
maked	i
a	i
long	i
time	i
that	i
he	i
drove	i
,	c
so	i
we	c
decided	c
to	c
stop	c
to	i
an	i
area	i
.	c

We	c
were	i
going	i
to	c
the	c
toilet	c
and	c
ate	c
something	c
to	i
the	c
snack	c
bar	c
.	c

This	c
story	c
happened	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
ago	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c

from	i

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
;	c
I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
musical	c
show	i
"	c
Over	c
The	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
,	c
which	c
as	i
organised	i
in	i
your	c
theatre	c
.	c

Nevertheless	i
,	c
there	c
was	c
not	c
any	c
available	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
as	c
regards	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
due	c
to	c
problems	c
with	c
the	c
pipes	c
.	c

Of	i
course	i
,	c
I	c
became	c
aware	c
of	c
her	c
feelings	c
since	c
a	c
friend	c
of	c
mine	c
overheard	c
a	c
conversation	c
between	c
Pat	c
and	c
other	i
girl	c
.	c

I	c
love	c
sports	c
so	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
play	c
some	c
basketball	c
at	c
the	c
camp	c
,	i
by	i
the	c
way	c
my	i
team	c
and	c
I	c
won	c
the	c
last	c
scholl	i
championship	c
,	i
I	c
play	c
guard	c
on	c
my	c
team	c
,	i
I	c
also	c
like	c
tennis	c
but	c
I	c
am	c
not	c
very	c
good	c
,	i
I	c
was	c
wondering	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
give	c
me	c
some	c
lesson	i
while	c
I	c
am	c
there	c
.	c

Hoping	c
to	c
hear	c
soon	i
from	i
you	i
.	c

I	c
received	c
your	c
letter	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
the	c
information	c
you	c
asked	c
.	i

Although	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
climb	i
(	c
so	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
complete	c
beginner	c
)	c
.	i

But	i
I	c
sailed	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
ago	c
so	c
I	c
am	c
quite	c
a	c
beginner	c
too	i
.	c

I	c
talked	c
to	c
him	c
and	c
we	c
ate	c
a	c
sandwich	c
together	c
talking	c
about	c
his	c
album	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
receive	i
the	c
photos	c
I	c
took	c
,	c
I	c
will	c
write	c
you	i
again	c
to	c
give	c
them	c
to	c
you	c
.	c

One	c
of	c
the	c
problems	c
is	i
that	c
a	c
couple	c
of	c
actors	c
,	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
,	c
were	c
the	c
ones	c
supposed	c
to	c
act	c
and	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
took	c
Danny	c
's	c
place	c
,	i
it	i
was	c
disappointing	c
!	c

Apart	c
from	c
that	c
,	c
technology	c
also	c
helps	c
in	c
hospitals	c
.	c

On	c
balance	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
evidently	i
technology	i
has	c
got	c
more	c
advantages	c
than	c
disadvantages	c
.	c

Concerning	c
swimming	c
,	c
I	c
practise	i
this	c
sport	c
once	c
a	c
week	c
on	i
myself	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
am	c
just	c
an	c
amateur	c
,	c
not	c
a	c
great	c
swimmer	c
!	c

Finally	c
,	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
must	c
I	c
bring	c
with	c
me	c
?	c

You	c
can	c
discover	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
things	c
if	c
you	c
are	c
abroad	c
and	c
learn	c
a	c
lot	c
about	c
the	c
life	c
of	c
local	c
people	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
pleasant	i
to	c
try	c
many	i
clothes	i
and	c
to	c
see	c
what	c
you	c
look	c
like	c
in	c
various	c
clothes	c
,	c
especially	c
if	c
you	c
are	c
in	c
a	c
foreign	c
country	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
the	c
actors	i
who	c
starring	i
was	c
not	c
Dany	c
Brook	c
as	c
it	i
was	i
advertised	c
but	c
one	i
other	i
actor	c
,	c
whose	c
performance	c
was	c
very	c
bad	c
.	c

As	c
a	c
result	c
of	c
that	i
I	c
demand	c
to	i
have	i
some	c
of	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

If	c
fact	c
technology	c
change	i
in	i
a	i
major	i
point	i
my	i
life	i
.	c

Can	c
you	c
imagine	c
your	c
life	c
without	c
a	c
car	c
or	c
a	c
television	c
?	c

Also	c
,	c
if	c
I	c
use	c
the	c
car	c
,	i
in	i
small	c
distances	c
when	c
I	c
can	i
go	c
on	c
foot	c
,	c
I	c
destroy	i
my	c
physical	i
situation	i
.	c

Could	i
you	c
imagine	c
your	c
life	c
without	c
a	c
television	c
or	c
a	c
computer	c
?	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
you	i
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
which	c
took	c
place	c
the	i
last	c
1st	c
of	c
May	c
in	i
"	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
"	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

But	c
however	c
it	i
is	c
a	c
good	c
idea	c
to	c
spend	c
out	i
money	c
in	i
make	i
new	c
enterprises	c
which	c
pay	c
the	i
researchers	c
and	i
they	i
could	c
investigate	c
how	c
to	i
improve	i
ourselves	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
have	c
understood	c
a	c
little	c
bit	c
of	c
waiting	c
time	c
,	c
but	c
everybody	c
agreed	c
that	c
this	c
was	c
too	c
long	c
.	c

I	c
asked	c
for	i
the	c
discounts	c
available	c
as	c
we	c
were	c
a	c
group	c
of	c
15	c
people	c
,	c
but	c
the	c
answer	c
I	c
was	c
given	c
was	c
that	c
nobody	c
had	c
ever	c
heard	c
of	c
them	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
receiving	c
your	c
decision	c
.	c

My	c
daily	c
life	c
has	c
changed	c
quite	c
a	c
lot	c
with	c
modern	c
technology	c
.	c

I	c
've	c
been	c
able	c
to	c
improve	c
some	c
things	c
that	c
could	i
have	c
annoyed	c
me	c
some	i
time	i
ago	c
,	c
and	c
although	c
they	c
're	c
mainly	c
little	c
changes	c
they	c
make	c
me	c
notice	c
that	c
my	c
life	c
is	c
easier	c
.	c

At	c
home	c
,	c
for	c
example	c
,	c
my	c
waking	i
up	i
is	c
no	c
more	i
a	c
surrounding	i
sound	c
that	c
breaks	c
the	c
silence	c
and	c
peace	c
of	c
my	c
dreams	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
now	c
the	c
good-morning	c
of	c
my	c
favourite	c
radio	c
program	i
,	c
set	c
to	c
start	c
at	c
seven	c
o'clock	c
.	c

Also	c
,	c
with	c
the	c
development	c
of	c
Internet	i
and	c
its	c
arriving	i
to	i
a	c
great	c
number	c
of	c
homes	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
have	c
any	c
information	c
I	c
need	c
at	c
any	c
time	c
I	c
want	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
not	c
very	c
experienced	c
but	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
I	c
will	c
find	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
beautiful	c
motives	i
in	c
the	c
USA	c
.	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

I	c
spent	c
some	c
great	c
days	c
in	c
Vienna	c
where	c
I	c
had	c
the	c
chance	c
to	c
help	c
at	c
the	c
concert	i
of	i
"	i
pearl	i
jam	i
"	i
.	c

The	c
first	c
thing	c
I	c
didwas	i
to	i
controll	i
the	i
tickets	i
of	i
the	i
fans	i
who	i
visited	i
the	i
concert	i
together	i
with	i
a	i
friend	i
of	i
mine	i
.	c

Hope	c
to	c
see	c
you	c
soon	c
!	c

Yours	c

After	c
that	c
I	c
will	c
go	c
back	c
to	c
Japan	c
and	c
continue	c
studying	c
at	c
College	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
stats	i
at	c
the	c
beginning	c
of	c
August	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
not	c
a	i
kind	c
of	c
person	c
who	c
can	c
easily	c
fall	c
a	i
sleep	i
and	c
it	c
gets	c
worse	c
when	c
I	c
am	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
.	c

I	c
often	c
climbed	c
mountains	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
in	c
high	c
school	c
.	c

Lastly	c
I	i
'd	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
some	c
questions	c
.	c

Then	c
why	c
do	c
n't	c
we	c
film	c
our	c
lunch	c
time	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
also	c
important	c
,	c
is	c
n't	c
it	c
?	c

For	c
the	c
very	c
last	c
part	c
why	i
not	c
filming	i
our	c
faces	c
when	c
all	c
the	c
lessons	c
are	c
finished	c
?	c

I	c
recently	c
had	c
a	c
week	c
's	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

I	c
felt	c
very	c
disappointing	i
after	c
seeing	c
the	c
music	c
show	c
in	c
your	c
theatre	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

Fathermore	i
,	c
discounts	i
was	i
unavailable	i
.	c

In	c
the	c
advertisement	c
they	c
said	c
that	c
tickets	i
discounts	c
available	i
.	c

Anyway	c
I	c
was	c
so	c
unpleasement	i
.	c

It	c
was	c
not	c
marvellous	i
evening	c
.	c

Could	c
you	c
back	i
my	c
money	c
please	c
?	c

In	c
addition	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
difficult	c
turn	i
it	c
off	c
.	c

Sometimes	c
it	c
waste	i
of	c
time	c
.	c

Unfourtunately	i
it	c
is	c
not	c
so	c
cheap	c
.	c

If	c
I	c
addicted	i
on	i
internet	i
,	c
it	c
will	i
be	c
problem	i
.	c

people	c
include	i
me	c
need	i
balance	c
.	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c

My	c
name	c
is	c
Steven	c
.	c

And	c
you	c
need	c
some	c
imformation	i
from	c
me	c
.	c

And	c
I	c
think	c
I	c
love	i
togo	i
on	i
July	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
will	c
choose	c
two	c
activities	c
that	c
I	c
good	i
at	c
and	c
not	c
good	c
at	c
.	c

I	c
use	i
to	i
play	i
basketball	c
at	c
school	c
and	c
play	c
for	c
school	i
team	c
.	c

It	i
's	i
make	i
you	c
feel	c
want	i
to	c
go	c
home	c
.	c

And	c
if	c
you	c
never	c
know	i
money	i
or	i
you	i
have	i
less	i
money	i
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
enjoyable	c
for	c
you	c
I'am	i
choue	i
.	c

I	c
want	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
to	c
come	c
to	c
our	c
party	c
and	c
also	c
to	c
help	c
us	c
about	i
what	c
present	c
shall	i
we	i
buy	c
for	c
Mr.	c
Brown	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
a	c
good	c
present	c
could	c
be	c
a	c
CD	c
or	c
a	c
book	c
.	c

What	c
do	c
you	c
think	c
?	c

All	c
the	c
scenery	c
with	c
the	c
lovely	c
sun	c
,	c
the	c
wonderful	c
beaches	c
,	c
the	c
green	c
mountains	c
and	c
the	c
smell	c
of	c
the	c
sea	c
,	c
make	c
me	c
feel	c
great	c
.	c

Sacondly	i
,	c
in	c
your	c
advertisement	c
I	c
read	i
"	c
Times	c
14.30	c
and	c
19.30	c
"	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
farward	i
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
in	c
the	c
very	c
near	c
future	c
,	c
to	c
offer	c
me	c
the	i
money	c
back	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
reading	c
when	c
I	c
suddenly	c
hard	i
a	c
big	c
bang	c
.	c

"	c
I	c
am	c
hear	i
to	c
help	c
you	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
suggest	c
that	c
we	c
could	c
attend	c
the	c
show	c
after	c
visiting	c
the	c
Science	c
Museum	c
,	c
instead	c
of	c
doing	i
shopping	c
.	c

The	c
wind	c
was	c
blowing	c
and	c
the	c
heavy	c
rain	c
was	c
drumming	c
agaist	i
our	c
bedroom	c
window	c
.	c

He	c
knew	c
everybody	c
,	c
especially	i
Mrs	c
Rilke	c
,	c
an	c
elderly	c
,	c
eagle-eyed	c
teacher	i
in	i
retirement	i
,	c
who	c
lived	c
in	c
a	i
old	c
cottage	c
with	c
her	c
five	c
bad-tempered	c
dogs	c
.	c

After	c
I	c
had	c
opened	c
her	c
gate	c
,	c
she	c
called	c
loudly	c
her	i
five	c
,	c
horrible	c
dogs	c
.	c

I	c
realised	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
run	c
away	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
had	i
still	i
her	c
letter	c
.	c

According	i
to	i
that	c
,	c
I	c
thought	c
I	c
'd	c
have	c
a	c
wonderful	c
night	c
.	c

When	c
the	c
show	c
began	c
had	i
my	c
biggest	c
disappoint	i
,	c
instead	c
of	c
the	c
great	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
there	c
were	i
another	c
actor	c
,	c
totally	c
unknown	c
.	c

I	i
'd	i
like	i
so	i
,	i
to	c
reiceve	i
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

And	c
it	c
is	c
responsable	i
for	c
many	c
changes	c
in	c
my	c
life	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
I	c
would	c
n't	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
live	c
without	c
it	c
anymore	c
.	c

It	c
would	c
also	c
be	c
a	c
chance	c
to	c
try	c
it	c
out	c
for	c
the	c
first	c
time	c
in	c
my	c
life	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
also	c
like	c
to	c
take	c
tennis	c
and	c
painting	c
activities	c
while	c
staying	c
at	c
the	c
camp	c
.	c

How	c
are	c
you	c
?	c

Already	c
everything	c
was	c
set	c
up	c
,	c
the	c
groups	i
instruments	c
,	c
lights	c
,	c
microphones	c
...	c

I	c
quickly	c
helped	c
others	c
to	c
decorate	c
and	c
to	c
'	c
polish	c
'	c
off	c
the	c
hall	c
-	c
we	c
blew	c
up	c
as	c
my	i
balloons	c
as	c
we	c
can	i
and	c
sprayed	c
them	c
with	i
gold	c
and	c
silver	c
.	c

Best	c
wishes	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
with	c
regards	c
to	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
'	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
'	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
going	c
to	c
complaining	i
about	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
not	c
want	c
to	c
think	c
you	c
told	c
a	c
lie	c
but	c
I	c
felt	c
to	i
waste	i
my	c
time	c
and	c
money	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	i
refund	c
all	c
the	c
money	c
and	c
I	c
recommend	c
to	i
thinking	c
about	c
the	c
advertisement	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
time	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
and	c
because	c
of	c
her	c
nasty	c
habit	c
,	c
I	c
lost	c
my	c
best	c
friend	c
and	c
boyfriend	c
at	c
the	c
same	c
time	c
.	c

One	c
year	c
ago	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
boyfriend	c
and	c
he	c
was	c
a	i
perfect	c
man	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
too	c
shocked	c
to	c
eat	c
anything	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
true	c
!	c

I	c
could	c
n't	c
do	c
anything	c
and	c
two	c
month	i
later	c
,	c
my	c
boyfriend	c
got	c
married	c
to	c
my	c
best	c
friend	c
.	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
apreciate	i
for	i
your	c
generous	c
award	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
been	c
sailing	c
in	c
the	c
Mediterennean	c
for	c
eight	c
years	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
playing	c
tennis	c
for	c
four	c
years	c
so	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
choose	c
sailing	c
and	c
tennis	c
activities	i
.	c

The	c
idea	c
of	c
meeting	c
a	c
worldwide	i
known	i
pop	i
singer	i
;	i
just	c
made	c
my	c
heart	c
punch	c
my	c
ribcage	c
.	c

We	c
,	c
the	c
volunteers	c
first	i
unravelled	c
the	c
cables	c
,	c
set	i
the	i
microphones	c
and	c
some	c
instruments	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Brown	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
you	i
because	c
my	c
class	c
want	c
to	c
give	c
a	c
surprise	c
birthday	c
party	c
for	c
your	c
husband	c
Mr	c
Brown	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
could	i
you	c
let	c
us	c
know	c
if	c
the	c
date	c
of	c
June	c
16th	c
is	c
all	c
right	c
with	c
his	c
timetable	c
program	i
.	i

We	c
have	c
invite	i
the	c
student	i
,	c
the	c
teachers	c
and	c
the	c
Principal	c
of	c
school	i
but	c
we	c
appreciate	i
if	i
you	c
are	i
coming	i
.	c

We	c
want	c
say	i
thanks	c
again	c
for	c
your	c
help	c
and	c
you	c
must	c
be	c
sure	c
that	c
your	c
opinion	c
it	i
would	c
be	c
valuable	c
to	c
us	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfuly	i
,	c

The	c
second	c
activity	c
I	c
chose	c
was	c
tennis	c
,	i
I	c
am	c
not	c
so	c
good	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
know	c
how	c
to	c
play	c
,	i
I	c
have	c
played	c
several	c
times	c
with	c
my	c
friends	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
an	c
expensive	c
trip	c
and	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
enough	c
money	c
to	c
pay	c
for	c
it	c
.	c

Nevertheless	c
I	c
need	c
money	c
for	c
restaurants	c
and	c
souvenirs	i
that	c
I	c
can	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjouable	i
because	c
of	c
several	c
factorors	i
.	c

The	c
third	c
and	c
last	c
factor	c
would	c
be	c
when	c
you	c
like	c
a	c
certain	c
type	c
of	c
clothes	c
,	c
and	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
find	c
any	c
of	c
that	c
kind	c
.	c

This	c
cituation	i
is	c
very	c
annoying	c
for	c
most	c
of	i
the	i
people	c
,	c
and	c
that	c
's	c
what	c
makes	c
shopping	c
unejoyable	i

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
happy	c
to	c
answer	c
your	c
letter	c
,	c
which	c
I	c
received	c
this	c
morning	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
happy	c
to	c
receive	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

Last	c
night	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
your	c
theatre	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	i
"	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
what	c
I	c
expected	c
to	c
see	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
it	c
had	i
been	i
written	i
that	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
were	c
starring	c
,	c
but	c
Danny	c
was	c
n't	c
there	c
and	c
somebody	c
else	c
took	c
his	c
place	c
.	c

At	i
last	i
you	c
wrote	i
that	c
it	c
was	i
our	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
,	c
but	c
like	c
I	c
said	c
before	c
it	i
was	c
n't	c
.	c

Actually	c
it	c
was	c
terrible	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
have	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

I	c
met	i
her	c
before	i
a	i
year	i
and	c
from	c
the	c
first	c
time	c
we	c
talk	i
to	c
each	c
other	c
we	c
became	i
friends	c
.	c

Every	c
day	c
after	c
school	c
she	c
went	i
to	c
my	c
house	c
or	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
hers	c
.	c

Anyway	c
,	c
always	i
I	i
trust	i
her	c
my	i
secrets	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
was	c
sure	c
she	c
would	c
n't	c
tell	c
them	c
to	c
other	c
people	c
,	c
even	c
if	c
some	c
say	i
we	c
would	c
be	c
apart	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
was	c
wrong	c
again	c
.	c

She	c
started	c
to	c
act	c
like	c
them	c
and	c
speak	c
like	c
them	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
so	c
glad	c
.	c

I	c
will	c
join	c
The	c
Camp	c
California	c
in	c
the	c
U.S.A.	c
with	c
pleasure	c

Those	c
shoes	c
must	c
be	c
mine	c
!	c
-	c
I	c
thought	c

I	c
went	c
in	c
and	c
I	c
asked	c
the	c
shop	c
assistant	c
if	c
I	c
could	c
try	c

-	c
Yes	c

she	c

but	c
what	c

your	c
size	c
?	c

I	c
had	c
some	c
money	c
,	c
I	c
wanted	c

but	c
?	c

Dear	c
Miss	c
Ryan	c
:	c

Maybe	c
,	i
you	c
will	c
meet	c
him	c
one	c
day	c
.	c

We	c
even	c
took	i
pictures	i
with	c
them	c
and	c
they	c
gave	c
us	c
their	c
autographs	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
so	c
much	c
fun	c
,	c
we	c
had	c
a	c
great	c
time	c
that	c
night	c
.	c

For	c
weeks	c
I	i
've	i
been	c
planing	i
to	c
go	c
to	c
this	i
threatre	i
with	c
some	c
close	c
relatives	c
and	c
friends	c
but	c
the	c
problems	c
that	c
we	c
had	c
made	c
this	c
perfect	c
night	c
a	c
disaster	c
has	i
all	c
of	c
us	c
.	c

To	c
begin	c
with	c
on	i
your	c
advertisment	i
you	c
say	c
that	c
Danny	c
Brooks	c
will	c
be	c
starring	c
the	i
show	c
but	c
instead	c
their	i
was	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
which	i
made	c
us	c
very	c
disappointed	c
.	c

You	c
can	c
understand	c
how	c
that	c
made	c
me	c
feel	c
,	c
and	c
when	i
the	i
tickets	i
had	i
no	i
discount	i

To	i
top	i
of	i
it	i
all	i
,	c
this	c
was	c
n't	c
the	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
.	c

What	c
are	c
going	i
to	i
look	i
the	i
clothes	i
in	i
a	c
century	c
from	c
now	c
?	c

This	c
is	c
something	c
that	c
has	c
trabled	i
many	c
people	c
,	c
especially	c
those	c
who	c
work	c
in	c
the	c
fashion	c
industry	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
early	c
90s	c
it	c
was	c
in	c
fashing	i
the	i
women	c
to	c
wear	c
only	c
skirts	c
.	c

Long	c
ones	c
actually	c
and	i
men	i
to	c
wear	c
trousers	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
,	c

Me	i
and	c
some	c
athers	i
friends	c
we	i
disided	i
to	c
went	i
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
to	c
see	c
the	i
musical	c
show	c
.	c

You	c
had	c
to	i
times	c
that	c
you	c
can	i
people	i
go	c
.	c

We	c
wate	i
one	c
hour	c
.	c

When	c
the	c
show	c
finished	c
we	i
went	c
to	c
the	c
restaurant	c
and	c
was	i
closed	c
because	c
the	c
people	c
who	c
whork	i
ther	i
they	i
do	c
n't	c
wark	i
if	c
they	c
do	c
n't	c
pay	i
first	c
.	c

I	c
dissapointing	i
so	i
mush	i
because	c
all	i
went	c
wrong	c
that	c
night	c
.	c

People	c
past	i
1000	i
years	i
from	i
the	i
day	i
that	i
excisted	i
in	i
the	i
earth	i
.	c

Now	c
we	c
are	c
in	c
a	i
20th	c
centure	i
were	i
people	i
went	i
to	c
the	c
moun	i
and	c
discavered	i
madesons	i
aboute	i
siriale	i
illneses	i
,	i
In	i
that	i
year	i
I	i
live	i
too	c
.	c

First	c
I	c
can	i
say	i
about	c
the	c
combuter	i
.	c

Maby	i
is	i
not	c
good	c
because	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
the	c
oportunite	i
to	c
meed	i
people	c
and	c
talk	c
face	i
by	i
face	i
Exepted	i
from	c
computers	c
we	c
have	c
telephone	i
,	c
T.V	i
,	c
gymnastick	i
centers	i
.	c

I	c
found	i
it	i
very	c
well	i
That	i
place	i
have	c
so	c
many	c
machines	c
that	c
you	c
can	c
eazy	i
loose	i
fat	i
and	c
made	i
a	c
wonderful	c
body	c
.	c

Now	c
if	i
we	i
made	i
a	i
conclution	i
we	c
can	c
see	c
or	i
I	c
can	c
see	c
that	i
mapy	i
I	c
do	i
n't	i
be	i
so	i
sociaple	i
person	c
bad	i
I	c
can	c
do	c
what	i
ever	i
I	c
want	c
and	c
take	c
what	i
ever	i
I	c
want	c
only	c
throu	i
the	i
technology	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
disapointed	i
,	c
because	c
the	c
actor	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
did	c
not	c
appeared	i
in	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

During	c
the	c
week	c
Pat	c
and	c
Peter	c
talked	c
about	c
the	c
problem	c
he	c
had	c
and	c
the	c
consequences	c
that	c
will	i
occured	i
if	c
he	c
told	i
it	i
to	i
his	i
parents	i
.	c

When	c
they	c
saw	i
the	c
film	c
,	c
Katy	c
and	c
John	c
approached	c
to	i
Peter	c
and	c
told	c
him	c
that	c
they	c
will	i
continue	c
being	c
his	c
friends	c
.	c

The	c
next	c
day	c
all	c
the	c
school	c
knew	c
that	c
Peter	c
was	c
gay	c
and	c
even	c
though	c
he	c
did	c
n't	c
mind	c
what	c
happened	i
he	c
did	c
n't	c
talked	i
with	i
Pat	c
no	i
more	i
in	c
his	c
life	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
really	c
disappointed	c
.	c

2	c
I	c
was	i
expected	i
that	c
there	c
would	c
be	c
discount	i
available	c
for	c
people	c
who	c
have	c
student	c
card	i
as	c
it	c
says	c
in	c
the	c
notice	i
,	c
but	c
there	c
was	c
not	c
.	c

5	c
Never	i
the	i
less	i
,	c
I	c
took	c
my	c
headmistress	c
with	c
me	c
and	c
I	c
have	i
recommened	i
how	c
wonderful	c
this	c
show	c
was	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c

Yours	c

I	c
think	c
the	c
best	c
choice	c
is	c

All	c
this	i
activities	c
which	c
should	c
be	c

are	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
theatre	c
show	c
you	c
did	i
last	c
week	c
because	c
there	c
were	c
too	c
many	c
irregularities	c
during	c
the	c
show	c

Henrique	c

It	c
was	c
the	c
best	c
day	c
of	c
my	c
life	c

Dear	c
manager	i
of	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c

Last	c
Sanday	i
my	c
friends	c
and	c
I	c
saw	c
that	c
advertisement	c
about	c
the	c
theatre	i
you	c
were	c
supposed	c
to	c
present	i
.	c

"	c
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	i
"	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
start	c
at	c
seven	c
thirty	c
.	c

That	c
was	c
very	c
disapponted	i
.	c

But	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
!	c
!	c

I	c
must	c
admit	c
that	c
,	i
that	c
evening	c
was	c
n't	c
the	c
perfect	c
one	c
out	i
for	c
me	c
but	i
I	i
and	i
for	i
my	i
friends	i
either	i
.	c

I	c
did	i
a	c
big	c
mistake	c
by	c
trusting	c
him	c
.	c

Last	c
Wednesday	c
my	c
sister	c
told	c
me	c
that	c
our	c
grandmother	c
had	c
a	c
serious	c
illness	c
and	c
she	c
was	c
going	c
to	c
die	c
.	c

We	c
will	c
have	c
food	c
and	c
drink	c
and	c
we	c
will	c
have	c
music	c
because	c
we	c
know	c
that	c
Mr	c
Brown	c
loves	c
music	c
.	c

My	c
last	c
question	c
is	c
about	c
present	i
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

We	c
wait	i
there	c
for	c
an	c
hour	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
really	c
angry	c
.	c

How	c
are	c
you	c
?	c

Lots	c
and	c
lots	c
of	c
kisses	c
,	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
and	i
the	c
most	c
important	c
for	c
me	c
is	i
that	c
you	c
lie	c
to	c
your	c
audience	c
.	c

You	i
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
your	c
cooker	i
was	c
ill	c
.	c

The	i
perfect	i
evening	i
out	i
I	i
was	i
waiting	i
for	i
,	c
it	c
was	c
finally	i
one	c
of	c
the	c
most	c
disappointed	i
,	i
of	i
mine	i
.	c

That	c
's	c
a	c
good	c
question	c
!	c

You	c
might	c
not	c
know	c
your	c
neighbour	c
because	c
all	i
the	i
time	i
your	i
in	i
the	i
house	i
.	c

And	c
ofcourse	i
my	c
parents	c
were	c
very	c
angry	c
with	c
me	c
.	c

Just	i
because	i
I	c
'm	c
studying	c
at	c
the	c
moment	c
and	c
I	c
wo	c
n't	c
have	c
my	c
holidays	c
till	c
July	c
.	c

This	c
is	c
the	c
month	c
that	c
best	c
suits	c
me	c
.	c

The	c
second	c
week	c
of	c
July	c
would	c
be	c
perfect	c
to	c
start	c
my	c
trip	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
rather	c
sleep	c
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
.	c

I	i
've	i
joined	i
a	c
climbing	c
group	i
in	c
my	c
town	c
2	i
years	c
and	i
reached	i
the	c
top	c
of	c
several	c
middle-high	c
mountains	c
.	c

This	c
is	c
a	c
report	c
to	c
plan	c
and	c
suggest	c
ideas	c
for	c
the	c
daily	i
life	i
video	c
at	c
school	c

The	c
activities	c
suggested	c
are	c
write	i
below	c

It	c
would	c
reflect	c
the	c
atmosphere	c
when	c
they	c
meet	c
early	c
in	c
the	c
morning	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

I	c
was	c
really	c
excited	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
turned	c
out	c
to	c
be	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
and	c
I	c
thought	c
that	c
was	c
quite	c
disappointing	c
.	c

He	c
understood	c
that	c
'	c
Carlotta	c
wants	c
to	c
kill	c
Charles	c
but	c
she	c
is	c
still	c
thinking	c
about	c
it	c

'	c

Charles	c
responds	c

Jacob	c

Charles	c
exclaims	c

When	c
Charles	c
told	c
Carlotta	c
what	c
he	c
knew	c
,	c
Carlotta	c
started	c
crying	c

My	c
name	c
is	c
Alois	c
Blau	c
and	c
I	c
'm	c
very	c
happy	c
that	c
I	c
've	c
won	c
this	c
competition	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
I	c
can	c
only	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
attend	c
school	c
until	c
June	c
the	c
30th	c
and	c
in	c
August	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
work	c
in	c
an	c
office	c
for	i
experience	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
ridiculous	c
!	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
have	c
my	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
,	c
in	c
other	c
words	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
very	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
so	c
I	c
am	c
asking	c
you	c
for	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

I	c
started	c
to	c
get	c
along	c
with	c
other	c
people	c
and	c
had	c
new	c
friends	c
but	c
I	c
continued	c
telling	c
Pat	c
my	c
secrets	c
.	c

My	c
new	c
friends	c
sometimes	c
talked	c
to	c
me	c
about	c
Pat	c
and	c
they	c
asked	c
me	c
once	c
if	c
we	c
were	c
close	c
friends	c
.	c

They	c
told	c
me	c
Pat	c
used	c
to	c
be	c
a	c
close	c
friend	c
of	c
them	i
and	c
she	c
used	c
to	c
talk	c
about	c
me	c
and	c
my	c
problems	c
.	c

To	c
begin	c
with	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
inform	c
you	c
,	c
in	c
case	c
you	c
do	c
not	c
know	c
that	i
the	c
play	c
does	c
not	c
start	c
at	c
19.30	c
as	c
it	c
says	c
.	i

What	c
is	c
more	c
it	i
lasted	i
45	c
minutes	c
of	c
waiting	c
to	i
start	i
and	c
did	i
not	c
supply	i
all	c
the	c
expectations	c
people	c
had	c
.	c

One	i
the	i
other	i
hand	i
,	c
despite	c
the	c
fact	c
that	c
technology	c
make	i
things	c
easier	c
in	c
our	c
day	i
life	c
,	c
the	c
same	c
happens	c
in	c
industries	c
and	c
companies	c
where	c
they	c
use	c
computers	c
and	c
machines	c
instead	c
of	c
people	c
.	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
regret	c
to	c
inform	c
you	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
had	c
some	c
problems	c
in	c
my	c
full-time	c
sales	c
assistant	c
job	c
so	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
rather	c
travel	c
only	c
in	c
July	c
than	c
other	c
months	c
.	c

Your	c
letter	c
also	c
mentioned	c
some	c
kind	c
of	c
activities	c
in	c
which	c
we	c
can	c
involve	i
through	i
the	c
camping	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
choose	c
painting	c
and	c
photography	c
which	c
are	c
my	c
favourites	i
ones	c
.	c

Hi	c
.	c

Activities	i
lasting	i
almost	c
2	c
days	i
and	i
a	i
half	i
.	c

The	c
first	c
day	c
we	c
have	i
to	c
move	i
to	c
the	c
airport	c
to	c
bring	c
all	c
the	c
equipment	c
by	c
lorries	i
to	c
the	c
camp	c
.	c

We	c
just	c
worked	c
in	i
building	c
the	c
stage	c
and	c
all	c
those	i
of	c
thing	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
had	i
this	c
oportunitty	i
one	c
day	c
,	c
you	c
had	c
better	c
buy	c
the	c
ticket	c
to	c
the	c
concert	c
or	c
just	c
watch	c
it	c
on	c
TV	c
but	c
never	c
do	c
something	c
like	c
just	i
to	c
get	c
a	c
free	c
pass	c
.	c

At	c
first	c
I	c
though	i
I	c
would	c
just	c
make	i
a	c
bit	c
of	c
sight-seeking	i
all	c
around	c
the	c
city	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

She	c
agreed	c
and	c
went	c
home	c
very	c
happy	c
.	c

When	c
night	c
came	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
believe	c
what	c
was	c
happening	c
.	c

Below	c
are	c
the	c
question	i
that	c
you	c
have	c
asked	c
me	c
.	c

Finally	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
practise	i
basketball	c
and	c
swimming	c
,	c
because	c
in	c
my	c
school	c
I	c
used	c
to	c
train	i
those	c
sports	c
a	c
lot	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c

Firstly	c
,	c
it	i
's	i
written	c
that	i
it	i
will	i
be	i
played	i
by	i
Danny	i
Brook	i
,	c
but	c
in	c
fact	c
it	i
was	c
n't	c
.	c

Secondly	c
as	c
a	c
student	c
I	c
was	c
hoping	c
to	c
get	c
a	c
reduce	i
.	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
do	c
have	c
a	c
problem	c
with	c
her	c
.	c

Even	c
worth	i
,	c
she	c
is	c
not	c
able	c
to	c
keep	c
anything	c
.	i

I	c
was	c
wondering	c
how	c
to	c
tell	c
my	c
parents	c
and	c
I	c
asked	c
Pat	c
if	c
she	c
could	c
keep	c
it	c
secret	c
till	c
I	c
found	c
the	c
way	c
to	c
tell	c
them	c
.	c

Secondly	c
you	c
will	c
get	c
angry	c
on	i
bad	i
treatment	i
of	c
the	c
sellers	i
in	c
the	c
shop	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
your	c
musical	c
show	c
which	c
performed	i
last	c
Friday	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
interested	c
in	c
your	c
advertisement	c
and	c
I	c
booked	c
the	c
friday	i
show	c
while	c
I	c
had	i
been	i
on	c
holiday	c
.	c

I	i
could	i
bare	i
it	i
by	i
the	i
time	i
.	c

I	c
like	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
's	c
acting	c
but	c
he	i
actors	c
were	c
changed	c
without	c
mentioning	c
,	c
also	c
the	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
by	i
the	c
excuse	c
to	i
be	i
repaired	c
.	c

Fashion	c
of	c
the	c

The	c
World	c
is	c
being	c
Changed	c
rapidly	c
by	c
developing	c
technology	c
and	c
industrial	i
.	c

I	c
ca	i
n't	i
stand	c
wearing	c
a	c
suit	c
or	c
kit	c
like	c
which	i
has	c
been	c
showed	i
in	c
Starwars	c
!	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
a	c
number	c
of	c
points	i
.	c

To	c
make	c
matters	c
worse	c
,	c
instead	c
of	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
performing	c
you	c
had	c
another	c
actor	c
,	c
which	c
was	c
very	c
disappointing	c
.	c

however	i
this	i
was	c
closed	c
due	c
to	c
lack	c
of	c
personall	i
.	c

According	i
to	i
my	c
experience	c
it	i
was	c
not	c
.	c

Everybody	c
wants	c
to	c
be	c
the	c
best	c
.	c

On	i
the	c
following	c
there	c
is	c
some	c
further	c
information	c
from	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
not	c
think	c
I	c
have	c
enough	c
time	c
to	c
prepare	c
somethings	i
to	c
travel	c
before	c
of	i
July	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
its	i
might	c
be	c
fun	c
to	c
try	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
the	i
tent	c
this	c
time	c
.	c

I	c
won	c
first	c
prize	c
two	c
years	c
ago	c
.	c

The	c
other	c
activity	c
is	c
swimming	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

I	c
really	c
like	c
to	c

people	c

something	i
back	c

This	i
experience	i
I	i
was	i
so	i
prond	i
and	c
very	c
enjoyed	i

I	c
hope	c

I	c

If	c
it	i
's	i
possible	c
for	i
you	i
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
come	c
in	c
July	c

Before	c
this	i
time	i

I	c
usually	i
stay	i
in	c

But	i
I	c
never	i
had	i
chance	i
for	i
staying	i
in	c
a	c

That	c
's	c
why	c
,	i
I	c
would	c
love	c
to	i
choose	i
tents	i
for	i
living	i
for	i
2	i

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
June	c
as	c
I	c
have	c
already	c
arranged	c
for	i
a	i
part	i
time	i
job	i
later	c
this	c
summer	c
.	c

Introduction	c
:	c
To	i
support	i
an	i
idea	i
to	i
make	i
a	c
short	c
video	c
about	c
daily	c
life	c
at	c
our	c
school	c
I	c
have	c
spend	i
some	c
time	c
discussing	c
it	c
with	c
other	c
students	c
,	c
observing	i
and	c
analaising	i
an	c
avrege	i
day	c
in	c
our	c
scholl	i
and	c
came	i
up	c
with	c
some	c
suggestions	c
.	c

Most	c
students	c
spend	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
their	c
time	c
in	c
such	c
places	c
and	c
they	c
are	i
very	c
important	c
part	c
of	c
our	c
school	c
life	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
have	c
any	c
further	c
comments	c
or	c
questions	c
regarding	c
this	c
case	i
please	c
let	c
me	c
know	c
.	c

Dear	c
Miss/Mrs	c
.	c

I	c
friend	c
of	c
mine	c
had	c
been	c
helping	c
at	c
a	c
few	c
concerts	c
before	c
,	c
so	c
that	c
time	c
the	c
agency	c
rang	c
him	c
and	c
asked	c
him	c
if	c
he	c
could	c
bring	c
someone	c
else	c
,	c
because	c
they	c
'd	c
run	c
out	c
of	c
stuff	i
.	c

For	c
a	c
while	c
I	c
thought	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
dream	c
.	c

The	c
last	c
thing	c
is	c
that	c
you	c
invited	c
us	c
to	c
visit	c
your	c
restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
the	c
food	c
was	c
not	c
already	i
done	c
.	c

I	c
thought	c
you	c
were	c
a	c
good	c
theatre	c
,	c
were	i
people	c
can	c
go	c
and	c
have	c
a	c
good	c
evening	c
alone	c
or	c
with	c
somebody	c
else	c
,	c
but	c
realy	i
I	c
am	c
very	c
disappointed	c
and	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
ask	c
for	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

To	c
finish	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
say	c
technology	c
has	c
changed	c
my	c
life	c
in	c
good	c
and	c
bad	c
ways	c
,	c
helping	c
the	i
things	c
be	i
easier	c
but	c
making	c
me	c
develop	i
a	i
big	i
independence	i
.	c

Dear	c
Helen	c

Moreover	c
,	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
will	c
I	c
need	c
if	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
go	c
out	c
at	c
night	c
?	c

Yours	c
Sincerely	i

Ignace	c
Cloutier	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
lay	c
the	c
emphasis	c
on	c
the	c
fact	c
that	c
this	c
report	c
can	c
be	c
seen	c
by	c
the	c
director	i
of	i
the	i
school	i
.	c

Sometimes	c
there	c
is	i
so	c
much	i
people	c
that	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
wait	c
half	c
an	c
hour	c
to	c
get	c
one	i
computer	c
.	c

We	c
thought	c
that	c
we	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
let	c
you	c
know	c
all	c
details	i
which	i
it	i
did	i
n't	i
make	i
us	i
happy	i
.	c

We	c
waited	c
for	c
45	c
minutes	c
.	c

After	c
show	i
we	c
went	c
immediately	c
to	c
the	c
tickets	i
office	c
for	i
asking	i
money	i
back	c
,	c
but	c
they	c
were	c
to	i
strict	c
and	c
close-minded	i
.	c

This	c
would	c
be	c
the	c
first	c
good	c
memory	i
for	c
us	c
from	i
your	c
show	c
.	c

They	c
have	c
typical	i
this	i
time	i
life	i
style	i
.	c

Full	i
of	i
technological	i
tools	i
and	i
instruments	i
in	i
the	i
house	i
.	c

Fire	c
alarm	c
,	c
burglar	c
alarm	c
,	c
house	c
temperature	c
checker	i
,	c
automatic	c
garage	c

many	i
of	i
them	i

For	c

People	i
talk	c
with	i
it	c
on	c
the	c
street	c
,	c
in	c
the	c
car	c
almost	i
everywhere	c
.	c

Some	c
of	c
them	c
necessiraly	i
some	i
of	c
them	c
not	c
.	c

Anyway	c
technology	i
is	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
thing	c
for	i
our	c
life	c
.	c

It	c
developes	i
day	c
by	c
day	c
.	c

Dear	c

I	c
am	c

this	c
letter	c
to	c
inform	c
you	c
that	c
the	c

musical	c
show	c
was	i
with	c
wrong	c
information	c
.	c

Sincerely	c
,	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
technology	c
has	c
been	c
a	c
great	c
help	c
to	c
all	c
of	c
us	c

By	c
the	c
way	c
,	c
I	c

use	c
my	c
computer	c
to	c
read	c
only	c
the	c
things	c
that	c
interest	c
me	c
.	c

This	c
can	c
be	c
very	c
useful	c
when	c
you	c
have	c
a	c
problem	c
that	c
needs	c
an	c
immediate	c
solution	c
.	c

All	c
these	c
things	c
save	c
me	c
lots	c
of	c
time	c
.	c

I	c
get	c
to	c
rest	c
more	c
and	c
spend	c
more	c
time	c
at	c
home	c
,	c
and	c
so	c
they	c
make	c
me	c
a	c
happier	c
person	c
.	c

For	c
the	c
next	c
years	i
,	c
we	c
can	c
expect	c
many	c
more	c
technologies	i
that	c
will	c
continue	c
making	c
our	c
lives	c
easier	c
.	c

That	c
is	c
my	c
worst	c
nightmare	c
.	c

They	c
also	c
like	c
going	c
to	c
loads	c
of	c
shops	c
,	c
in	c
different	c
parts	c
of	c
the	c
city	c
.	c

At	c
that	c
time	c
,	c
I	c
took	c
the	c
course	c
which	c
covered	c
all	c
the	c
4	c
kinds	c
of	c
strocks	i
.	c

When	c
things	c
become	c
more	c
obvious	c
and	c
more	c
things	c
are	c
decided	c
,	c
I	c
'll	c
report	c
again	c
.	c

to	i
do	c
that	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
more	c
interesting	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
art	c
,	c
music	c
and	c
drama	c
classes	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
important	c
to	c
observe	c
students	i
attention	i
and	c
therefore	c
we	c
should	c
film	c
them	c
during	c
an	c
exam	c
(	c
but	c
only	c
for	c
a	c
short	c
period	c
of	c
time	c
)	c

Your	i
state	i
in	c
your	c
advertisment	i
that	c
he	c
would	c
come	c
on	c
stage	c
,	c
but	c
instead	c
of	c
him	c
someone	c
else	c
turned	c
up	c
.	c

About	c
the	c
activities	c
listed	c
on	i
your	c
letter	c
,	c
I	c
choose	c
basketball	c
and	c
singing	c
.	c

Yours	c
truthfully	i

I	c
helped	c
with	c
the	c
selling	c
of	c
the	c
tickets	c
,	c
with	c
the	c
security	c
,	c
with	c
the	c
designing	c
...	c

Her	c
daughter	c
,	c
Lourdes	c
Maria	c
,	c
is	c
such	c
a	c
pretty	c
little	c
girl	c
,	i
that	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
take	c
my	c
eyes	c
off	c
of	c
her	c
.	c

Unfortunalety	i
my	c
feelings	c
are	c
rather	c
bad	c
.	c

Especialy	i
due	c
to	c
the	c
fact	c
that	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
see	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
-	c
my	c
favourite	c
actor	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

I	c
was	c
the	c
only	c
boy	c
in	c
my	c
class	c
who	c
did	c
n't	c
have	c
a	c
driving	c
licence	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
never	c
driven	c
a	c
car	c
before	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
Pat	i
was	c
there	c
and	c
half	c
of	c
my	c
class	c
.	c

At	c
the	c
beginning	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
start	c
the	c
engine	c
.	c

I	c
wish	c
I	c
had	c
n't	c
told	c
Pat	c
about	c
my	c
plans	c
.	c

We	c
are	c
good	c
friends	c
nowadays	c
,	i
however	i
I	i
will	c
never	c
tell	c
her	c
my	c
secrets	c
.	c

I	c
spent	c
two	c
days	c
at	c
the	c
International	c
Arts	c
Festival	c
you	c
have	i
organized	i
.	c

Capua	c
,	c
16/12/2000	c

I	c
think	c
the	c
discussion	c
in	c
your	c
class	c
was	c
very	c
interesting	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
think	c
there	c
is	c
something	i
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
change	c
!	c

I	c
like	c
my	c
life	c
,	c
both	c
at	c
school	c
and	c
at	c
home	c
!	c

I	c
just	c
receive	i
your	c
letter	c
with	c
the	c
good	c
news	c
.	c

I	c
start	c
thinking	c
what	i
she	c
or	c
he	c
prefer	i
and	c
I	c
try	c
my	c
best	c
buying	i
something	c
apropiate	i
does	i
n't	i
matter	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
does	i
it	c
cost	i
.	c

We	c
all	c
had	c
to	c
sit	c
and	c
wait	c
because	c
there	c
was	c
nobody	c
to	c
explain	c
the	c
reason	c
of	i
the	c
delay	c
and	c
excuse	i
about	c
it	c
.	c

(	c
As	c
I	c
mentioned	c
above	c
)	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
disappointed	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
asking	c
for	c
some	c
money	c
back	c
if	c
possible	c
.	c

....	c

First	c
the	c
starring	i
was	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
but	c
then	c
another	c
man	c
took	c
his	c
place	c
,	i
I	c
could	c
n't	c
believe	c
it	c
,	i
you	i
could	i
n't	i
change	i
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
a	c
very	c
important	c
artist	c
,	c
and	c
put	c
a	c
begginer	i
one	i
.	i

It	c
was	c
very	c
disappointing	c
.	c

Yes	c
,	c
45	c
minutes	c
,	i
I	c
want	c
to	c
see	c
you	c
in	c
that	c
case	i
.	c

And	c
well	c
,	c
do	c
n't	c
talk	c
about	c
the	c
discounts	c
,	c
because	c
they	c
did	c
n't	c
exist	c
.	c

At	i
end	i
,	c
I	c
could	c
see	c
that	c
the	c
advertisement	c
said	c
"	i
Your	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
"	c
,	i
it	i
was	c
n't	c
the	c
perfect	c
evening	c
,	i
now	i
I	c
'm	c
looking	c
for	c
a	c
layer	i
,	c
because	c
I	c
want	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
,	c
if	i
do	i
n't	i
well	i
you	i
know	i
the	i
end	i
of	i
this	i
story	i
.	c

But	c
the	c
problem	c
began	c
to	c
increase	i
because	c
all	c
her	c
friends	c
knew	c
her	c
secret	c
.	c

Obviously	c
,	c
Pat	c
first	c
refused	i
,	i
but	c
then	c
she	c
accepted	c
that	c
she	c
was	c
wrong	c
,	c
and	c
apologyse	i
Maria	i
,	i
after	i
then	i
Pat	c
never	c
again	c
talked	c
about	c
someone	i
within	i
his	c
or	c
her	c
permission	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
allow	c
us	c
to	c
go	c
we	c
could	c
change	c
the	c
programme	c
in	c
this	i
way	i
.	c

The	c
next	c
50	c
years	c
.	c

I	c
can	c
only	c
come	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
working	c
in	c
the	c
office	c
and	c
I	c
cannot	c
take	c
two	c
weeks	c
off	c
in	c
other	i
month	c
.	c

I	c
need	c
relax	i
after	c
year	i
in	c
the	c
office	c
thats	i
why	c
I	c
choose	c
photography	c
and	c
painting	c
which	c
are	c
not	c
very	c
active	c
.	c

The	c
answer	c
is	c
that	c
we	c
choose	c
the	c
same	c
street	c
(	c
usually	c
the	c
most	c
popular	c
)	c
and	c
the	c
same	c
time	c
as	c
six	c
hundrets	i
other	c
people	c
.	c

We	c
become	c
customers	c
who	c
want	c
to	c
do	c
their	c
shopping	c
with	c
pleasure	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
we	c
can	c
achieve	c
pleasure	c
at	c
home	c
with	c
our	c
new	c
goods	c
.	c

The	c
organiser	i

Dear	c
Jimmie	c
,	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
happy	c
to	c
receive	c
a	c
letter	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
when	c
you	c
want	c
to	i
ask	i
a	i
question	i
to	i
the	i
teatcher	i
,	c
you	c
must	c
to	i
put	i
your	c
hand	c
up	c
,	i
and	c
speak	c
when	c
the	c
teacher	c
ask	i
you	c
.	c

Big	i
kisses	i
,	c

I	c
hope	c
that	c
next	c
year	c
there	c
will	c
be	c
much	i
more	c
possibilities	c
to	c
enjoy	c
films	c
or	c
plays	c
and	c
that	c
the	c
halls	c
will	c
be	c
bigger	c
,	c
as	c
they	c
were	c
overcrowded	c
.	c

Maybe	c
next	c
year	c
the	c
festival	c
could	c
be	i
ended	i
with	c
fireworks	i
show	i
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Just	i
I	i
got	i
your	c
letter	c
and	c
sat	c
straight	i
away	c
to	c
write	i
you	i
a	i
few	i
sentences	i
that	c
will	c
illustrate	c
my	c
opinion	c
.	c

Although	c
we	c
have	c
to	c
change	c
our	c
boots	i
,	c
we	c
do	c
n't	c
need	c
to	c
wear	c
special	c
uniforms	c
.	c

However	i
my	i
parents	c
are	c
n't	c
demanding	c
,	i
I	c
have	c
to	c
be	c
home	c
at	i
least	i
at	i
11	i
o'clock	i
and	c
tell	c
them	c
where	c
I	c
go	i
out	i
.	c

Yours	c

WE	c
ARE	c
REALY	i
INTERESTING	i
IN	c
THIS	c
SHOW	c

COULD	i
YOU	c
PLEASE	c
BE	c
SO	c
KIND	c
AND	i
CHANGE	i
SOME	c
OF	c
THE	c
ACTIVITIES	c
THAT	c
WE	i
WILL	i
HAVE	i
?	c

YOUR	i
SINCERLY	i
;	i

IT	c
WAS	c
MY	c
FIRST	c
TIME	c
IN	c
LONDON	c
.	c

WHEN	c
THEY	c
CLOSED	c
I	i
TOOK	c
THE	c
7	i
BUS	c
.	c

BUT	c
THAT	c
DAY	c
,	c
LIKE	i
I	c
WAS	c
KIND	c
OF	c
DRUNK	c
,	c
I	c
DID	c
N'T	c
REALISE	c
THAT	c
THE	c
BUS	c
TOOK	c
A	c
DIFFERENT	c
WAY	i
;	i
SO	c
WHEN	i
I	c
NOTICED	c
IT	c
THE	i
DRIVER	c
WAS	c
ALREADY	c
ASKING	c
ME	c
TO	c
GET	c
OFF	c
,	c
BECAUSE	c
WE	c
WHERE	i
IN	c
THE	c
GARAGE	c
IN	c
PORTOBELLO	c
.	c

I	c
WAS	c
REALY	i
SCARE	i
.	c

HE	c
TOOK	c
ME	c
RIGHT	c
IN	i
FRONT	i
OF	c
MY	c
HOUSE	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
notice	i
that	c
the	c
festival	c
would	i
be	i
able	i
to	i
appeal	c
to	c
more	c
people	c
if	c
a	c
few	c
improvements	c
were	c
made	c
.	c

As	c
a	c
result	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
impossible	c
for	c
al	i
the	c
audience	c
to	c
fit	c
in	c
there	c
.	c

Dear	c
Kathy	c
,	c

I	c
'm	c
really	c
happy	c
to	c
hear	c
from	c
you	c
again	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
sorry	c
for	c
not	c
writing	c
earlier	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

I	c
recently	c
went	c
to	c
London	c
on	c
vacation	c
,	c
with	c
some	c
friends	c
.	c

How	c
has	c
moden	i
technology	c
changed	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
?	c

This	c
technology	c
has	c
help	i
in	c
many	c
fields	c
,	c
like	c
medicine	c
,	c
entreteinment	i
,	c
work	c
and	c
other	c
thing	i
,	c
so	c
it	c
has	c
obviusly	i
change	i
the	c
life	i
of	c
many	c
people	c
.	c

This	c
is	c
a	c
new	c
era	c
,	c
an	c
era	c
for	c
a	c
new	c
tipe	i
of	c
people	c
,	c
the	c
feuta	i
people	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
this	c
letter	c
to	c
express	c
my	c
thoughts	c
about	c
the	c
International	c
Art	c
Festival	c
of	c
this	c
year	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
it	c
is	i
better	c
to	c
invite	c
more	c
artists	c
not	i
only	i
from	i
six	i
countries	i
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
the	i
artists	i
or	i
stars	i
from	i
we	i
have	i
rare	i
chance	i
to	i
feel	i
the	i
atmosphere	i
.	c

Yours	c
Sincerely	c

He	c
had	c
never	c
seen	c
such	c
bambo	i
before	c
but	c
decided	c
to	c
cut	c
it	c
down	c
.	c

Then	i
there	i
was	c
a	c
lovely	c
baby	c
in	c
it	c
.	c

The	c
baby	c
was	c
named	c
'	c
Kaguya	c
.	c
'	c

The	c
old	c
man	c
and	c
woman	c
tried	c
to	c
keep	i
her	c
staying	i
their	i
house	c
,	c
but	c
they	c
could	c
n't	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
as	c
you	c
can	c
see	c
Starring	c
was	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
on	i
your	c
advertisement	c
but	c
when	c
I	c
sat	c
my	i
seat	c
,	c
different	i
actor	c
and	c
actress	c
appeared	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
disappointed	c
because	c
I	c
was	c
longing	c
for	i
seeing	i
them	c
as	i
a	c
fan	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
,	c
when	c
I	c
entered	c
into	i
the	c
theatre	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
have	c
discount	i
in	c
spite	c
of	c
student	i
and	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
use	c
in	i
your	c
restaurant	c
either	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

In	i
that	c
time	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
it	c
had	c
been	c
being	c
repaired	c
.	c

If	c
all	c
your	c
staffs	i
are	c
fulfilled	c
by	c
the	i
computers	c
,	c
we	c
might	c
be	c
idler	c
than	c
now	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
we	c
have	c
to	c
consider	c
about	i
our	c
nature	i
.	c

As	c
you	c
know	c
,	c
even	c
now	c
,	c
science	c
and	c
technology	c
are	c
destroying	c
our	c
environment	c
,	c
for	c
example	c
weird	c
temperature	c
etc.	c
If	c
we	c
do	c
n't	c
protect	c
our	c
environment	c
,	c
our	c
daily	c
life	c
will	c
not	c
be	c
convenient	c
.	c

Finaly	i
last	c
nigh	i
was	c
not	c
perfect	i
evening	c
.	c

Fashion	i
are	c
always	c
changing	c
therefore	c
it	c
is	c
really	c
difficult	c
to	c
say	c
what	c
sort	c
of	c
clothes	c
people	c
wear	i
in	c
future	i
.	c

We	c
always	c
repeat	i
the	i
fashion	i
with	i
adding	i
some	i
new	i
fashion	i
at	i
that	i
time	i
.	c

What	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
will	c
I	c
need	c
in	c
the	c
U.S.A.	c
in	c
July	c
?	c

Hope	c
to	c
hear	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

Sincerely	c
,	c
I	c
must	c
admit	c
,	i
that	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
like	c
shopping	c
in	c
supermarkets	c
and	c
big	c
stores	c
.	c

There	c
are	c
always	c
too	c
many	c
people	c
there	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
the	c
letter	c
that	c
conformed	i
first	c
prize	c

I	c
am	c
not	i

on	c
preparing	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
interst	i
playing	i
tennis	c
very	c
much	c
.	c

Finaly	i
,	c
I	c
have	c
some	c
question	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
well	c
.	c

Can	c
you	c

In	c
our	c
lyceum	i
we	c
have	c
listem	i
of	c
"	c
double	c
lessons	c
"	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
is	c
more	c
convinient	i
than	c
seven	c
lessons	c
every	c
day	c
and	c
each	c
of	c
the	c
lessons	c
lasts	c
fourty	i
five	i
minutes	c
.	c

I	c
have	i
spent	i
two	c
days	c
at	c
the	c
International	c
Arts	c
Festival	c
with	c
some	c
of	c
my	c
friend	i
and	c
I	c
must	c
say	c
we	c
realy	i
delighted	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
great	i
idea	c
to	c
do	c
that	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

We	c
all	c
liked	c
Jazz	i
,	c
rock	c
and	c
classical	c
concerts	c
.	c

Look	i
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

However	c
there	c
are	c
lots	c
of	c
rules	c
in	c
our	c
lives	c
,	c
both	c
at	c
home	c
and	c
at	c
school	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
in	c
reply	c
of	i
our	i
letter	c
,	c
that	i
had	i
let	c
me	c
know	c
I	c
am	c
the	c
winner	c
of	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
of	i
your	c
competition	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
not	c
too	c
bad	c
at	c
these	c
sports	c
.	c

That	c
seems	c
to	c
be	c
quite	c
surprising	c
,	c
yet	c
this	c
teacher	c
manages	c
to	c
convey	c
his	c
knowledge	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
our	c
basketball	c
team	c
has	c
won	c
a	c
local	c
championship	c
.	c

I	c
will	c
not	c
make	c
troubles	i
but	c
I	c
ask	c
you	c
politely	c
my	i
money	c
back	c
.	c

Sincerly	i
yours	c
,	c

I	c
think	c
we	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
in	i
consideration	i
our	i
enviroment	i
:	c
The	i
pollution	c
makes	c
more	i
and	i
more	i
the	i
atmosphere	i
warmer	i
.	c

The	c
ice	c
will	c
smellt	i
,	c
the	c
weather	c
will	c
be	c
warmer	c
.	c

People	c
wo	c
n't	c
wear	c
warm	c
clothes	c
anymore	c
and	c
they	c
will	c
certenly	i
be	c
sinthetic	i
,	c
because	c
there	c
wo	c
n't	c
be	c
enough	c
place	i
to	c
cultivite	i
cotton	c
and	c
to	c
let	c
grass	i
sheeps	i
.	c

Community	c
:	c
Another	i
very	c
important	c
point	c
!	c

I	c
'm	c
shure	i
that	c
is	c
not	c
impossible	c
!	c

Clothes	c
will	c
take	c
a	c
very	c
important	c
place	c
in	c
our	c
future	c
.	c

Or	c
do	c
you	c
think	c
,	c
an	c
icetime	i
will	c
come	c
?	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
with	c
a	c
request	c
for	c
a	c
change	c
in	c
the	c
scedule	i
of	c
our	c
trip	c
to	c
London	c
.	c

Everything	c
seams	c
very	c
interesting	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
sure	c
that	c
we	c
will	c
all	c
have	c
a	c
very	c
good	c
time	c
.	c

This	c
way	c
we	c
will	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
visit	c
the	c
Central	c
Exhibition	c
Hall	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
evening	c
,	c
and	c
see	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

The	c
same	c
afternoon	c
I	c
picked	c
up	c
the	c
phone	c
and	c
I	c
gave	c
them	c
a	c
call	c
.	c

That	c
was	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
a	c
student	c
of	i
your	c
college	c
and	c
I	c
write	i
this	c
letter	c
for	c
my	c
class	c
because	c
I	c
'm	c
the	c
class	c
chief	c
.	c

We	c
know	c
that	c
we	c
will	c
spend	c
three	c
days	c
in	c
London	c
in	c
a	c
with	i
a	c
determinate	i
programme	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
we	c
ca	c
n't	c
stop	c
the	i
progress	c
but	c
if	c
we	c
want	c
we	c
can	c
conserve	c
traditional	i
things	c
.	c

Anyway	c
,	c
we	c
still	c
want	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
Science	c
Museum	c
and	c
shopping	i
as	c
well	c
but	c
we	c
think	c
we	c
can	c
go	c
shopping	c
on	c
the	c
last	c
day	i
afternoon	c
of	c
our	c
trip	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
also	c
include	i
the	c
show	c
's	c
leaflet	c
on	c
the	c
back	c
of	c
this	c
letter	c
.	c

What	c
do	c
you	c
think	c
about	c
this	c
plan	c
?	c

It	c
's	c
not	c
fair	c
for	c
them	c
to	c
have	c
journalists	c
following	c
them	c
and	c
take	i
their	c
photographs	c
and	i
some	c
journalists	c
write	c
the	i
news	i
that	c
not	i
true	c
.	c

To	c
make	c
matters	c
worse	c
,	c
despite	c
the	c
fact	c
that	c
the	c
second	c
show	c
of	c
the	c
day	c
was	c
scheduled	c
to	c
start	c
from	i
7:30	c
p.m	c
,	i
it	c
started	c
from	i
8:15	c
p.m.	c
What	c
's	c
more	c
,	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
,	c
because	c
the	c
chef	c
suddenly	c
took	c
a	c
day	c
off	c
.	c

In	i
these	i
days	c
,	c
young	c
people	c
prefer	c
wearing	c
shabby	c
and	c
scruffy	c
clothes	c
to	c
wearing	c
neat	c
and	c
tidy	c
clothes	c
.	c

Make	i
up	i
and	c
Hairstyles	c
are	c
also	c
very	c
important	c
especially	i
For	c
our	c
class	c
,	c
because	c
the	i
most	c
students	i
of	i
our	c
class	c
are	c
girls	c
.	c

and	c
they	c
want	c
to	c
know	c
all	c
the	c
latest	c
news	c
about	c
these	c
.	i

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c

Miss	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c

In	i
both	i
of	i
them	i
I	i
am	i
very	i
good	i
.	c

Please	c
,	c
when	c
you	c
recive	i
this	c
letter	c
give	c
me	c
a	c
call	c
so	c
we	c
can	c
arrange	c
everything	c
.	c

We	c
are	c
going	c
to	c
do	i
a	c
video	c
about	c
daily	c
life	c
at	c
school	c
,	i
the	i
following	c
classes	c
are	c
the	c
ones	c
I	c
recomend	i
to	i
film	i
.	c

CHEMISTRY	c
:	c
We	c
do	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
experiments	c
and	c
the	c
materials	c
we	c
use	c
are	c
very	c
good	c
.	c

Those	c
three	c
classes	c
are	c
my	c
choises	i
,	i
I	c
hope	c
we	c
could	i
do	c
them	c
and	c
make	c
a	c
very	c
good	c
video	c
about	c
our	c
school	c
.	c

The	c
Theatre	c
also	c
promised	c
discounts	c
,	c
which	c
were	c
not	c
available	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
pay	c
the	c
full	c
amount	c
.	c

Finaly	i
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
£	i
20	c
back	c
as	c
I	c
was	c
not	c
satisfied	c
with	c
your	c
services	c
.	c

I	c
will	c
be	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

She	c
started	c
running	c
and	c
got	c
lost	c
.	c

But	c
Pat	c
could	c
not	c
resist	c
the	c
temptention	i
of	i
calling	i
the	c
police	c
.	c

We	c
were	c
at	c
school	c
when	c
she	c
told	c
me	c
this	c
and	c
Mr	c
Smythe	c
went	c
to	c
our	c
class	c
and	c
said	c
to	c
me	c
"	i
May	c
I	c
talk	c
to	c
you	c
?	c
"	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
am	c
not	c
very	c
good	c
in	i
Photography	i
.	c

I	c
hope	c
I	c
have	c
informed	i
you	c
enough	c
.	c

How	c
are	c
you	c
?	c

I	c
'm	c
doing	c
great	c
esspecially	i
after	c
my	c
experience	c
with	i
helping	c
at	c
pop	i
concert	c
.	c

Every	c
artist	c
could	c
scream	c
at	c
me	c
whenever	c
they	c
wanted	c
.	c

Afterwards	c
they	c
talk	i
to	c
me	c
and	c
thanking	i
me	c
for	c
helping	c
them	c
in	c
those	c
exciting	c
moments	c
.	c

Talk	c
to	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

The	c
worst	c
was	c
when	c
the	c
actors	c
were	i
presented	i
to	i
us	i
and	c
the	c
starring	c
names	c
were	c
completely	c
different	c
than	i
I	c
expected	c
.	c

This	c
is	c
why	c
for	i
all	c
of	c
those	i
good	c
reasons	c
I	i
am	c
asking	c
for	c
some	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
sure	c
you	c
will	c
understand	c
my	c
request	c
regarding	c
my	c
complaint	c
,	c
your	c
credibility	c
is	c
depending	c
of	i
.	i

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
earing	i
from	c
you	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
with	c
reference	c
to	c
the	c
three	i
day	i
trip	c
in	i
London	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
organising	c
the	c
programme	c
,	c
which	c
seems	c
extremely	c
interesting	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
my	c
classmates	c
and	c
I	c
also	c
found	c
another	c
fascinating	c
thing	c
about	c
the	c
trip	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
also	c
said	c
that	c
their	c
private	c
lives	c
must	c
not	c
be	c
intruded	c
,	i
as	c
they	c
are	c
the	c
same	c
as	c
us	c
,	c
human	c
beings	c
.	c

There	c
were	c
no	c
discounts	c
available	c
like	c
the	c
advertisement	i
had	i
written	i

At	i
the	i
end	i
,	c
the	c
theatre	c
resturant	i
was	c
closed	c
for	c
holiday	i
!	c

I	c
also	c
think	c
I	c
am	c
lucky	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
live	c
in	c
a	c
period	c
of	c
tecnologic	i

Instead	c
of	c
a	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
there	i
was	c
written	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
show	c
,	i
that	c
there	i
would	i
be	i
Danny	i
Brook	i
as	i
main	i
actor	i
,	c
but	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
played	c
in	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

The	c
show	c
started	c
forty-five	c
minutes	c
later	i
and	c
this	c
really	c
disappointed	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
in	c
the	c
near	c
future	c
.	c

That	c
was	c
why	c
she	c
decide	i
to	c
change	c
her	c
behaviour	c
.	c

But	c
,	c
as	c
the	c
days	c
went	c
by	c
,	c
she	c
was	c
surprised	c
because	c
she	c
realized	c
she	c
was	c
getting	c
used	i
not	c
to	i
tell	i
secrets	c
any	i
more	i
.	c

My	c
name	c
is	c
Gabriel	c
and	c
I	c
represented	i
our	c
class	c
.	c

There	c
is	c
a	c
very	c
interesting	c
programme	c
for	c
young	c
people	c
like	c
we	i
.	c

The	c
sun	c
was	c
shining	c
,	c
the	c
Chanel	i
was	c
clear	c
blue	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
walking	c
by	c
the	c
Sea	i
.	c

He	c
was	c
exhaused	i
and	c
could	c
n't	c
breath	i
.	c

You	c
should	c
ignore	c
the	c
dangerous	i
if	c
you	c
convince	i
you	c
can	c
save	c
somebody	i
his	i
live	i
.	c

I	c
prefer	c
staying	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
as	c
I	c
am	c
used	c
to	c
it	c
and	c
find	c
it	c
more	c
comfortable	c
.	c

This	c
will	c
show	c
how	c
the	c
school	c
lives	c
.	c

At	c
the	c
assembly	c
students	c
are	c
told	c
about	c
changes	c
in	c
the	c
timetable	c
and	c
activities	c
for	c
the	c
whole	c
day	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
this	c
letter	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
make	c
some	c
suggestions	c
for	c
the	c
International	c
Arts	c
Festival	c
that	c
took	c
place	c
a	c
while	c
ago	c
.	c

By	c
the	c
way	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
also	c
wondering	c
if	c
it	c
was	c
possible	c
to	c
have	c
more	c
plays	c
and	c
films	c
for	c
the	c
coming	c
up	i
festival	c
as	c
the	c
reaction	c
of	c
the	c
people	c
was	c
excellent	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
been	c
such	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
since	c
we	c
wrote	c
to	c
each	c
other	c

Dear	c
Mrs.	c
Ryan	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
stay	c

'	c
Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
'	c

If	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
go	c
shopping	c
again	c
,	c
because	c
the	c
fridge	c
is	c
empty	c
or	c
you	c
need	c
some	c
new	c
clothes	c
,	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
time	c
,	c
patience	c
and	c
straingth	i
are	c
needed	c
.	c

All	c
kinds	c
of	c
shopping	c
have	c
more	c
and	c
more	c
become	c
to	i
a	c
rather	i
stressful	i
activity	i
than	c
an	c
enjoyable	c
on	c
.	c

Leaving	c
the	c
car	c
at	c
home	c
is	c
also	c
not	c
a	c
good	c
ideas	i
you	i
often	c
buy	c
so	c
much	c
that	c
you	c
ca	c
n't	c

But	c
there	i
occure	i
also	i
problems	i
if	c
there	c
are	c
products	c
left	c
:	c
either	c
you	c
ca	c
n't	c
decide	c
between	c
two	c
things	c
or	c
your	c
favourite	c
product	c
is	c
too	c
expensive	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
suggest	c
a	c
few	c
things	c
that	c
could	c
be	c
changed	c
or	c
added	c
in	i
next	c
year	c
's	c
International	c
Arts	c
Festival	c
,	c
wich	i
in	c
my	c
opinion	c
has	c
been	c
a	c
great	c
idea	c
to	i
create	i
.	c

I	c
spent	i
a	c
good	c
time	c
in	i
the	c
jazz	c
,	c
rock	c
and	c
classical	c
concerts	c
in	c
spite	c
of	c
the	c
fact	c
that	c
some	c
concert	c
halls	c
were	c
too	c
small	c
.	c

All	c
my	c
family	c
liked	c
the	c
films	c
and	c
the	c
plays	c
that	c
there	c
were	c
very	c
much	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
personaly	i
think	c
that	c
It	i
would	c
be	c
better	c
to	c
add	c
more	c
because	c
there	c
were	c
only	c
five	c
plays	c
and	c
seven	c
films	c
.	c

In	c
your	c
letter	c
you	c
told	i
me	c
something	c
about	c
rules	c
.	c

You	c
know	c
that	c
I	c
'm	c
studing	i
in	c
a	c
hard	i
school	c
,	c
and	c
as	c
you	c
can	c
imagine	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
work	c
hard	c
and	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
do	c
homework	c
everyday	i
.	c

Do	c
you	c
understand	c
this	c
?	c

She	c
might	c
be	c
crazy	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
seeing	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
in	i
reference	c
to	c
the	c
programme	c
for	c
the	c
English	c
class	c
,	i
that	c
is	c
going	c
to	c
spend	c
three	c
days	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
hearing	i
from	c
you	c
.	c

Famous	c
people	c
,	c
such	c
as	c
politicians	c
and	c
film	c
stars	c
,	c
they	i
live	c
happy	i
,	i
because	c
they	c
know	c
that	c
the	i
famous	c
mean	i
to	i
be	i
rich	c
.	c

My	c
personal	c
opinion	c
is	c
that	c
,	i
I	c
think	c
they	c
are	c
n't	c
really	c
happy	c
,	c
and	c
they	c
are	c
selfish	c
as	c
well	c
.	c

I	c
do	i
not	c
really	c
like	c
will	i
be	i
a	c
famous	c
person	c
,	c
because	c
you	c
are	c
not	c
really	c
yourselfh	i

and	c
for	c
me	c
is	i
the	c
more	i
important	c
thing	c

One	c

I	c
watched	c
your	c

Because	c
that	i
was	c
only	c
a	c
week	i
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
would	i
give	c
me	c
some	c
of	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
that	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
great	c
excuse	i
for	c
the	c
loss	i
of	c
time	c
and	c
my	c
dissopointness	i

In	c
this	c
one	c

they	c
spend	i
most	c
of	c
their	c
time	c
with	c

and	c
they	c
loved	c
her	c
so	c
much	c
and	c
they	c
want	i
to	c
be	c
her	c
parents	c

After	c
that	c
Marine	c
's	c
father	c
take	i
the	c

left	c

The	i

According	c
to	c
your	c

,	c
the	c
actor	c
should	c
be	i
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
but	c
infact	i
it	c

By	c

on	c
very	c
well	c

All	c
I	c
know	c

about	i

I	c
asked	c
to	i
her	c
not	c

burst	c
into	c

June	c
17th	c
2000	c

"	c
Dear	c
"	c
menager	i
of	c
the	c
Circle	c
theatre	c
,	c

When	c
I	c
entered	i
I	c
did	c
n't	c
get	c
the	i
discount	c
(	c
as	i
it	i
has	i
been	c
written	i
!	c
!	c
)	c

I	c
have	i
waited	i
for	c
the	c
show	c
beginning	i
until	c
20:15	c
!	c
!	c
!	c
!	c

I	c
was	c
getting	c
angry	c
,	c
but	c
,	c
finally	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
and	c
I	c
became	c
quiter	i
.	c

So	c
,	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	i
to	c
have	c
a	c
good	c
meal	c
in	c
the	c
"	c
famous	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
"	c
(	c
that	i
,	c
of	c
course	c
,	c
was	c
closed	c
for	c
a	c
free	i
night	i
!	c
!	c
!	c
!	c
)	c

Faithfully	c

It	c
sounds	c
very	c
promissing	i
.	c

But	c
there	c
is	c
something	c
else	c
which	c
we	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
see	c
.	c

It	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
for	c
us	c
,	c
because	c
we	c
are	c
all	c
interested	c
in	c
fashion	c
particularly	i
in	c
sports	i
wear	i
.	c

And	c
if	c
there	c
is	c
anybody	c
who	c
wants	c
to	c
go	c
shopping	c
,	c
he	c
would	i
be	c
able	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
on	c
Wednesday	c
evening	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
dangerous	c
but	c
I	c
knew	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
.	c

But	c
this	c
was	c
also	c
the	c
moment	c
when	c
my	c
nightmare	c
started	c
to	c
come	c
alive	i
.	c

It	c
was	c
our	c
pilot	c
.	c

I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
to	c
send	c
me	c
$	c
1000	c
for	c
my	c
art	c
knowledge	c
.	c

With	c
this	c
amount	c
I	c
could	c
buy	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
art	c
books	c
,	c
and	c
records	c
.	c

What	c
we	c
like	c
is	c
based	c
in	i
our	c
relationship	i
to	i
another	i
people	c
,	c
in	i
the	i
work	c
or	c
in	c
the	c
family	c
.	c

It	c
encouraged	c
me	c
to	c
take	c
part	c
in	c
the	c
festival	c
.	c

Apparently	c
there	c
were	c
artists	c
from	c
only	c
six	c
countries	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
also	c
like	c
to	c
suggest	c
you	i
to	i
try	i
and	c
make	c
more	c
plays	c
and	c
films	c
available	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
visiting	c
International	i
Arts	c
Festival	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

Usually	c
we	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
to	c
wear	c
school	c
uniforms	i
,	c
but	c
there	c
are	c
schools	c
,	i
in	c
which	c
there	c
is	c
such	c
obligation	c
.	c

Well	c
,	c
we	c
both	c
know	c
that	c
parents	c
are	c
the	c
ones	c
who	c
rule	c
at	c
home	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

Another	c
problem	c
-	c
we	c
were	c
very	c
hungry	c
that	c
evening	c
because	c
the	c
show	c
was	i
postpone	i
45	c
minutes	i
!	c
so	c
we	c
were	c
late	i
to	c
our	c
supper	c
in	c
the	c
hotel	c
and	i
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
also	c
closed	c
without	c
any	i
risons	i
.	c

How	c
has	c
modern	c
technology	c
changed	c
(	c
your	c
)	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
?	c

Im	i
dealing	c
with	c
a	i
mobile	c
communication	c
-	c
mobile	c
phones	c
and	c
papers	i
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

To	i
look	i
for	c
clothes	c
and	c
shoes	c
is	c
for	c
every	c
women	i
one	c
of	c
their	i
favourite	c
hobby	i
and	c
if	c
it	c
were	c
possible	c
they	i
would	c
stay	c
the	i
whole	i
day	i
in	i
the	i
shopping-centre	i
.	c

I	c
suppose	c
more	c
countries	c
are	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
informed	c
even	c
during	c
and	c
after	c
the	c
events	c
.	c

Even	c
if	c
the	c
majority	c
of	c
my	c
friends	c
had	c
a	c
good	c
time	c
there	c
I	c
saw	c
some	c
people	c
would	i
anticipate	i
it	i
,	i
because	i
there	i
were	i
many	i
people	i
who	i
were	i
impressed	i
in	i
it	i
.	i

That	c
's	c
how	c
I	c
am	c
feeling	c
about	c
that	c
.	c

I	c
expect	c
you	c
can	i
be	c
organised	i
even	i
better	i
next	c
year	c
.	c

But	c
it	c
is	c
quite	c
different	c
rather	c
than	c
you	c
.	c

I	i
think	i
the	i
rule	i
of	i
school	i
has	i
many	i
thing	i
stoping	i
students	i
doing	i
.	i

For	c
example	c
,	c
if	c
students	c
behave	c
wrongly	c
at	c
school	c
,	c
they	c
will	c
have	c
some	c
punishments	c
even	c
up	c
to	c
now	c
.	c

But	c
people	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
change	c
life	i
style	i
in	c
their	c
house	c
because	c
there	c
have	i
n't	i
been	i
convenient	c
appliaces	i
in	c
their	c
house	i
yet	c
.	c

I	c
recentely	i
had	c
a	c
week	c
's	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
,	c
and	c
during	i
my	c
stay	c
,	c
I	c
went	c
in	i
your	c
theatre	c
to	c
see	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
because	c
I	c
have	i
seen	c
an	c
advertisement	c
about	i
this	c
show	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
really	c
interrested	i
to	i
see	i
it	c
for	c
many	c
reasons	c
,	c
one	c
of	c
this	i
reasons	c
it	i
is	c
that	c
I	c
love	c
the	c
starring	i
Danny	i
Brook	c
.	c

And	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
that	i
you	c
know	i
that	c
I	c
have	c
had	c
a	c
very	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
,	c
due	c
to	c
the	c
differences	c
between	c
the	c
advertisement	c
and	c
the	c
show	c
that	c
I	c
saw	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
visit	c
you	i
theatre	c
restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
already	c
closed	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
very	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
and	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
very	c
kind	c
of	c
you	c
if	c
you	c
give	i
me	c
back	c
the	c
money	c
.	i

I'am	i
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hear	i
you	i
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c
.	c

Your	i
faithfully	c
,	c

Why	c
not	c
.	i

Mine	i
name	c
is	c
John	c
and	c
I	c
have	i
been	i
in	i
the	c
latest	c
International	c
Arts	c
Festival	c
.	c

The	c
purpose	c
of	c
this	c
letter	c
is	c
just	c
to	c
let	c
you	c
know	c
my	c
opinion	c
of	c
the	c
event	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
talk	c
about	c
my	c
suggestions	c
,	c
please	c
,	c
do	c
not	c
hesitate	c
and	i
let	c
me	c
know	c
.	c

Here	c
is	c
my	c
article	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
Why	i
do	c
n't	c
we	c
think	c
more	c
about	c
the	c
future	c
,	c
instead	c
of	c
being	c
upset	c
of	i
how	c
to	c
get	c
some	c
money	c
to	c
spend	i
next	i
party	c
?	c

As	c
soon	c
as	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
.	i

In	c
addition	c
the	c
concert	c
did	c
n't	c
start	c
on	c
time	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
quarter	i
of	c
an	c
hour	c
late	c
.	c

Thatt	c
Chitchee	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

As	c
a	c
result	c
Mallory	c
had	c
been	c
arrested	c
by	c
the	c
police	c
two	c
years	c
ago	c
.	c

So	c
they	c
could	c
take	c
their	c
time	c
,	c
rather	c
than	c
going	c
in	c
at	i
the	c
front	c
door	c
.	c

He	c
ran	c
away	c
.	c

To	i
the	c
attention	c
of	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
Manager	c
:	c

Secondly	c
,	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
wait	c
until	c
8:00	c
pm	c
before	c
being	c
able	c
to	c
have	i
a	c
seat	c
and	c
the	c
show	c
finally	c
beginned	i
at	c
8:15	c
!	c

So	c
I	c
am	c
asking	c
you	c
to	c
pay	c
me	c
back	c
at	c
least	c
half	c
of	c
the	c
ticket	c
price	c
for	c
the	c
inconvenience	c
that	c
was	c
caused	c
to	i
me	c
.	c

That	c
's	c
what	c
I	c
learned	c
from	c
my	c
own	c
experience	c
.	c

We	c
were	c
both	c
in	c
the	c
same	c
class	c
in	c
high	c
school	c
and	c
used	c
to	c
spend	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
time	c
together	c
;	c
we	c
were	c
actually	c
very	c
good	c
friends	c
and	c
had	c
no	c
secrets	c
for	i
each	c
other	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
to	c
wait	c
ten	c
days	c
before	c
the	c
lotery	i
head	c
office	c
would	c
give	c
me	c
the	c
cheque	c
and	c
one	c
week	c
before	c
I	c
could	c
learn	c
how	c
much	c
I	c
had	c
won	c
.	c

We	c
had	c
the	c
opportunity	c
to	c
read	c
your	c
programme	c
and	c
we	c
are	c
happy	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
very	c
good	i
organized	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
normal	c
Saturday	c
morning	c
.	c

I	c
knew	c
that	c
my	c
brother	c
was	c
at	c
home	c
,	c
althoug	i
I	c
did	c
n't	c
know	c
where	c
.	i

I	c
was	c
doing	c
my	c
homeworks	i
when	c
I	c
heard	c
an	c
explosion	c
.	c

I	c
came	c
out	c
of	c
my	c
room	c
and	c
I	c
saw	c
my	c
brother	c
n	i
fire	c
.	c

He	c
had	c
to	c
stay	c
there	c
for	c
three	c
long	c
weeks	c
.	c

I	c
really	c
like	i
my	c
brother	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
do	c
anything	c
possible	c
to	c
save	c
him	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
,	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
on	i
the	c
name	c
of	c
all	c
the	c
students	c
who	c
will	c
go	c
to	i
the	c
London	i
's	i
trip	c
.	c

I	c
know	c
that	c
everyone	c
is	c
excited	c
about	c
what	c
happened	c
to	i
Michael	c
Douglas	c
'	c
wedding	c
or	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
life	c
the	c
President	c
of	c
The	i
United	c
States	c
is	c
living	c
but	c
sometimes	c
it	c
's	c
going	c
a	c
bit	c
to	i
far	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
it	i
should	c
be	c
a	c
rule	c
which	c
let	i
the	c
medias	i
approach	c
famous	c
people	c
almost	c
anywhere	c
except	c
in	c
their	c
private	c
home	c
to	c
leave	c
them	c
at	c
least	c
one	c
place	c
to	c
feel	c
safe	c
.	c

Last	c
Saturday	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
your	c
theatre	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
new	c
musical	c
show	c
;	i
"	c
Over	c
The	c
Rainbow	c
"	c

Your	i
faithfully	c
,	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
big	c
fault	i
to	c
gave	i
her	c
a	c
secret	c
,	c
especially	c
an	c
important	c
one	c
.	c

Here	c
lies	c
the	c
poor	i
body	i
of	i
Rod	c
,	c

Mrs/Miss	c
Helen	c
:	c

It	c
is	c
excellent	c
to	c
have	c
won	c
this	c
prize	c
.	c

The	c
idea	c
about	i
going	c
to	c
California	c
for	c
2	c
weeks	c
make	i
me	c
feel	c
very	c
excited	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
really	c
surprise	i
about	c
how	c
many	c
activities	c
can	c
be	c
practised	i
in	c
this	c
place	c
.	c

On	i
one	i
hand	i
I	c
think	c
that	c
climbing	c
sounds	c
very	c
exciting	c
,	c
but	c
on	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
it	c
scares	c
me	c
a	c
lot	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
will	c
play	c
tennis	c
.	c

In	c
fact	c
when	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
feel	c
very	c
happy	c
I	c
decide	c
to	c
do	i
shopping	c
to	c
try	c
to	c
cher	i
myself	c
up	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
like	c
when	i
I	c
have	c
to	c
try	c
on	c
differents	i
sizes	c
because	c
the	c
small	c
does	i
n't	c
fit	c
on	i
my	i
body	i
because	c
I	c
have	c
got	i
weight	c
.	c

But	c
from	c
another	c
point	c
of	c
view	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
silly	c
to	c
be	c
earning	c
money	c
and	c
do	i
n't	i
spend	i
it	c
as	c
you	c
want	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Ryan	c
:	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
for	c
money	c
and	c
clothes	c
because	c
my	c
parents	c
are	c
travelling	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
impossible	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
have	i
money	i
because	c
my	c
sister	c
does	c
n't	c
want	c
me	c
to	c
go	c
because	c
I	c
'm	c
only	c
14	c
,	c
but	c
when	c
I	c
get	c
there	c
I	c
promise	c
to	c
return	c
you	i
all	c
the	c
money	c
because	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
cash	i
at	i
this	i
moment	i
.	c

Bye	c
and	c
think	c
on	i
this	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
inform	c
some	i
further	c
information	c
as	i
follow	i
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
much	c
about	c
there	i
,	i
is	i
there	c
anything	c
should	i
I	i
bring	c
with	c
me	c
?	c

Some	c
people	c
when	i
they	i
are	i
in	i
a	i
sadness	i
,	i
they	i
will	i
go	i
shopping	i
to	c
forget	c
every	i
thing	i
and	c
the	c
fact	c
is	c
that	c
every	i
body	i
knows	c
how	c
to	c
shopping	i
.	c

I	c
think	c
I	c
can	c
forgive	i
your	i
theatre	i
,	i
only	i
if	c
you	c
give	c
me	c
a	c
refund	c
of	c
the	c
money	c
I	c
spent	c
there	c
,	c
and	c
some	c
other	i
more	c
for	c
all	c
the	c
problems	c
I	c
had	c
.	c

Technology	c
nowadays	c
is	c
something	c
everybody	c
has	c
on	c
your	i
own	i
mind	c
.	c

I	c
want	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
some	c
details	c
about	c
my	c
feelings	c
.	c

For	c
all	c
these	c
reasons	c
,	c
and	c
if	c
you	c
want	c
to	c
keep	c
me	c
a	i
costumer	i
,	c
I	c
would	c
be	c
gratfull	i
if	c
you	c
give	i
me	c
some	c
or	c
all	c
my	i
money	c
back	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

You	c
need	c
more	c
explanations	c
about	i
me	c
to	c
understand	c
my	c
motivations	i
at	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
this	c
story	c
.	c

That	c
's	c
why	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
hack	c

change	c

Lausanne	c
,	c
the	c
20th	c
of	c
May	c
2000	c

Two	c
weeks	c
ago	c
,	c
I	c
spent	c
a	c
week	c
in	c
your	c
fabulous	c
city	c
of	c
London	c
with	c
my	c
friend	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
we	c
were	c
really	c
disappointed	c
about	c
everything	c
in	c
the	c
theatre	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
instead	c
of	c
19:30	c
,	i
it	c
's	c
a	c
theatre	c
but	i
not	c
a	c
concert	c
hall	c
!	c
!	c
!	c
!	c

Nothing	i
was	i
serious	i
.	c

We	c
really	c
like	c
London	c
,	c
the	c
people	c
,	c
the	c
night-life	c
but	c
this	c
evening	c
was	c
really	c
awful	c
.	c

Sincerely	c
yours	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

She	c
's	c
a	c
secretary	c
in	c
an	c
office	c
.	c

Just	c
after	c
Scala	c
told	c
her	c
the	c
new	i
,	c
Pat	c
phoned	c
her	c
mother	c
who	c
worked	c
in	c
a	c
bakery	c
,	c
to	c
tell	c
that	i
Scala	c
is	i
pregnant	c
.	c

There	c
is	c
just	c
one	c
thing	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
;	i
Janine	c
and	c
Richey	c
have	c
seen	c
an	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
show	c
and	c
we	c
all	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
farward	i
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

My	c
sister	c
was	c
standing	c
,	c
crying	c
and	c
showing	i
the	c
front	c
door	c
.	c

I	c
took	c
her	c
in	c
my	c
arms	c
and	c
opened	c
the	c
door	c
:	c
my	c
mother	c
was	c
sitting	c
in	c
a	c
chair	c
,	c
reading	c
a	c
book	c
,	c
with	c
blood	c
all	c
around	c
her	c
.	c

Everything	c
was	c
going	c
on	i
,	c
when	c
one	c
day	c
,	c
I	c
came	i
in	i
the	c
house	c
and	c
found	c
my	c
mother	c
sitting	c
in	c
a	c
chair	c
reading	c
a	c
book	c
,	c
with	c
blood	c
all	c
around	c
her	c
.	c

Firstly	c
we	c
arrived	c
at	c
19.15	c
to	c
be	c
in	c
time	c
for	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
which	c
should	c
have	c
started	c
at	c
19.30	c
.	c

However	c
it	i
started	c
at	c
20.15	c
and	c
we	c
were	c
all	c
very	c
disappointed	c
.	c

These	c
kinds	c
of	c
misadventures	c
can	c
easily	c
ruin	c
your	c
reputation	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
and	c
the	c
rumours	c
describing	i
me	c
stealing	c
soon	c
reached	c
the	c
director	c
's	c
office	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
unable	c
to	c
image	i
what	c
would	c
happen	c
to	c
me	c
if	c
my	c
parents	c
knew	c
what	c
I	c
had	c
stolen	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
to	c
this	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
which	i
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
and	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
it	i
is	c
necessary	c
to	c
have	c
,	c
since	c
I	c
am	c
undecided	c
about	c
it	c
not	i
knowing	c
the	c
cost	c
of	c
life	i
in	c
California	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
,	c

Yours	c
Sincerely	i

The	c
aim	c
of	c
this	c
report	c
is	c
to	c
suggest	c
which	c
activities	c
of	i
our	c
daily	c
life	c
at	c
school	c
shoud	i
be	c
filmed	c
to	c
give	c
the	c
other	c
students	c
the	i
idea	c
of	c
what	c
we	c
usually	c
do	c
not	i
only	c
during	c
the	c
lessons	c
but	c
also	c
the	c
rest	c
of	c
the	c
time	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
there	c
were	c
no	c
diccounts	i
avaible	i
as	i
it	i
said	i
on	i
the	c
anouncement	i
so	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
pay	c
the	c
original	c
price	c
wich	i
was	c
n't	c
cheap	c
at	c
all	c
.	c

That	c
is	c
not	c
difference	i
from	c
now	c

What	c
type	c
of	c
clothes	c
should	c
I	c
take	c
and	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
would	c
be	c
enough	c

The	c
biggest	c
problem	c
was	c
connected	c
with	c
some	c
foreigners	c
who	c
could	c

Polish	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
what	c
you	c
have	c
written	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
on	i
the	c
newspaper	c
.	c

Your	i
faithfully	c
,	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

Firstly	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
written	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
that	c
a	c
famous	c
actor	c
Danny	i
Brook	c
would	i
play	i
in	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

That	c
evening	c
was	c
n't	c
my	c
perfect	c
one	c
out	i
,	c
although	c
it	c
was	c
promised	c
to	c
be	c
so	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
this	c
would	c
be	c
quite	c
fair	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
,	c
that	c
different	c
tops	c
and	c
mini-skirts	c
will	c
become	c
more	c
popular	c
.	c

On	i
the	i
other	i
handDuring	i
my	c
stay	c
in	i
Camp	c
California	c
,	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
go	c
swimming	c
because	c
I	c
practice	i
this	c
activitie	i
regularly	c
and	c
I	c
often	c
do	i
competitions	c
:	c
this	c
is	c
one	c
of	c
my	c
hobbies	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
to	c
this	c
,	c
I	c
wish	c
I	i
am	i
going	i
to	i

:	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
try	i
it	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
seems	i
to	i
be	i
great	c
!	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Then	c
,	c
there	c
was	c
only	c
one	c
hour	c
left	c
to	c

the	c
differents	i

it	c
was	c

I	c

it	i
could	c
be	c
as	c
simple	c
as	c
we	c
think	c

Despite	c
being	c
used	c
in	c
many	c
ways	c
,	c
it	c
could	c
entartian	i

as	c
well	c

In	c

to	c
this	c

the	c

this	c
schedule	c
,	c
especially	c
the	c
river	c
trip	c
to	c
Greenwich	c
,	c
which	c
,	c
we	c
are	c
shure	i
,	c
will	c
be	c
very	c
exciting	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
b	i
grateful	c
if	c
you	c
consider	i
our	c
suggestions	c
.	c

Your	i
sincerelly	i

It	c
was	c
dangerous	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
knew	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
.	c

My	c
dog	c
was	c
very	c
angry	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
affraid	i
that	c
someone	c
was	c
near	c
my	c
house	c
and	c
wanted	c
to	c
get	c
to	i
my	c
house	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

Also	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
start	c
at	c
19.30	c
but	c
finally	i
it	i
started	c
at	c
20.15	c
and	c
that	c
is	c
such	c
a	c
waste	c
of	c
others	i
people	i
time	c
.	c

Another	c
thing	c
was	c
that	c
you	c
said	c
discounts	c
are	c
available	c
which	i
is	c
very	c
important	c
for	c
students	c
,	c
but	c
no	c
their	i
were	c
n't	c
any	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

The	c
day	c
after	c
,	c
at	c
school	c
,	c
I	c
noticed	c
that	c
everyone	c
was	c
looking	c
at	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
tried	c
to	c
take	i
it	i
on	i
my	i
stride	i
but	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
terrified	c
.	c

I	c
write	c
to	c
you	c
because	c
last	c
night	c
,	c
(	c
Saturday	c
10	c
)	c
,	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
that	c
you	c
are	c
presenting	c
at	c
the	c
Circle	c
theatre	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
a	c
great	c
fan	c
of	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
went	c
to	c
see	c
him	c
in	c
his	c
new	c
show	c
,	c
but	c
,	c
to	c
my	c
surprise	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
him	c
who	c
played	c
that	c
night	c
but	c
another	c
horrible	i
young	c
actor	c
.	c

She	c
would	c
give	c
them	c
the	c
exam	c
's	c
questions	c
and	c
they	c
would	c
make	i
all	c
her	c
homeworks	i
during	i
3	c
weeks	c
.	c

The	c
teachers	c
started	c
investigating	c
and	c
asking	c
all	c
the	c
students	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
secret	c
and	c
they	c
could	c
n't	c
say	c
a	c
word	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
the	c
teachers	c
asked	c
Lise	c
and	c
her	c
friends	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
this	c
letter	c
to	c
congratulate	c
you	c
for	i
the	c
excellent	c
international	c
arts	c
festival	c
we	c
could	i
enjoy	i
last	c
November	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
a	c
few	c
things	c
that	c
I	c
personally	c
think	c
can	i
be	c
improved	c
in	c
the	i
following	i
editions	i
.	c

Artists	c
from	c
different	c
cultures	c
may	i
make	c
the	c
festival	c
even	c
more	c
interesting	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
really	c
enjoyed	c
the	c
dance	c
shows	c
and	c
the	c
plays	c
and	c
films	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
'll	c
attend	i
my	c
suggestions	c
.	c

Once	c
upon	c
a	c
time	c
,	c
in	c
a	c
small	c
Catalan	c
village	c
,	c
there	c
was	c
a	c
little	c
boy	c
who	c
loved	c
cheating	i
and	c
making	c
jokes	c
.	c

His	c
father	c
was	c
a	c
shelter	i
,	c
He	i
had	c
one	c
hundred	c
sheeps	i
and	c
one	c
dog	c
,	c
and	c
he	c
used	c
to	c
take	c
the	c
animals	c
to	c
the	c
mountain	c
to	c
feed	c
them	c
.	c

One	c
day	c
,	c
he	c
became	c
ill	c
and	c
was	c
worried	c
about	c
the	c
animals	c
.	c

"	c
Let	c
's	c
have	c
a	c
bit	c
of	c
fun	c
"	c
,	c
he	c
thought	c
.	c

Nobody	c
came	c
.	c

To	c
begin	c
with	c
,	c
you	c
wrote	c
down	i
in	c
the	c
leaflet	c
that	c
stars	c
and	c
artists	c
from	c
around	c
the	c
world	c
could	c
be	c
seen	c
in	c
the	c
performance	i
in	i
fact	c
their	i
were	c
only	c
six	c
countries	c
involved	c
.	c

My	c
suggestion	c
for	c
this	c
point	c
is	c
to	c
invite	c
more	c
people	c
from	c
different	c
countries	c
.	c

Nearly	c
at	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
this	c
letter	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
the	c
idea	c
with	i
the	c
weekend	c
ticket	c
was	c
really	c
good	c
because	c
it	c
gave	c
to	i
the	c
people	c
the	c
opportunity	c
to	c
attemp	i
a	i
whole	c
weekend	c
for	c
a	c
cheap	c
price	c
.	c

To	c
finish	c
this	c
letter	c
with	i
I	i
would	c
like	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
a	c
good	c
idea	c
for	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
you	i
because	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
answer	i
the	c
information	c
that	c
you	c
ask	c
for	c
.	c

It	c
will	c
be	c
impossible	c
another	i
choise	i
,	c
but	c
if	c
you	c
have	c
any	c
problem	c
you	c
will	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
advise	c
me	c
,	c
although	c
I	c
prefer	c
to	c
go	c
there	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
I	c
think	c
is	i
the	c
best	c
month	c
to	c
travel	c
,	i
the	c
weather	c
is	c
nicer	c
and	c
warmer	c
than	c
in	c
other	c
seasons	c
.	c

About	c
the	c
two	c
activities	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
select	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
the	c
best	c
one	i
are	c
swimming	c
and	c
painting	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
hearing	i
from	c
you	c
.	c

You	c
can	c
enjoy	c
your	c
time	c
spending	c
all	c
the	c
money	c
you	c
have	c
,	c
buying	c
clothes	c
,	c
jewells	i
,	c
furnitures	i
,	c
etc.	c
and	c
you	c
could	c
have	c
a	c
real	i
great	c
time	c
.	c

Can	c
you	c
imagen	i
be	i
in	c
Japan	c
or	c
China	c
and	c
have	i
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
shops	c
?	c

In	c

you	c
needed	i
some	i
informations	i
about	c
me	c

I	c

Mile	i

They	c

Dear	c
MANANGER	i
of	c
the	c
theatre	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
just	c
for	c
the	i
reason	c
,	c
to	c
inform	c
you	c
how	c
bad	c
became	i
the	c
present	c
,	i
name	i
"	c
OVER	c
THE	c
RAINBOW	c
"	c
.	c

So	c
try	c
to	c
imagine	c
my	c
situation	c
,	i
I	c
had	c
paied	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
money	c
and	c
I	c
could	i
n't	i
saw	i
a	c
good	c
show	c
,	i
I	c
am	c
really	c
disappointed	c
.	c

The	c
only	c
thing	c
Pat	c
should	i
do	i
,	i
was	c
to	c
choose	c
a	c
date	c
,	c
the	i
one	c
he	c
likes	i
and	i
to	c
press	c
the	c
starter	c
botton	i
,	c
and	c
you	c
know	c
,	i
what	c
,	i
he	i
did	c
it	c
!	c

The	c
machine	c
worked	c
really	c
good	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
taking	c
photograghy	i
courses	i
at	c
univercity	i
and	c
I	c
started	c
tennis	c
,	i
when	c
I	c
was	c
10	c
so	c
I	c
am	c
good	c
at	c
bouth	i
of	c
them	c
.	c

How	c
much	c
money	c
should	c
I	c
take	c
and	c
should	c
I	c
take	c
only	c
casual	c
clothes	c
and	c
trainers	c
?	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
very	c
hard	c
.	c

In	i
front	i
of	i
the	i
stage	i
was	i
so	i
many	i
people	i
and	c
they	c
could	c
n't	c
see	c
them	c
very	c
well	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
was	c
at	i
very	c
near	c
from	i
the	c
stage	c
and	c
I	c
could	c
see	c
them	c
just	c
there	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
do	c
n't	c
go	c
to	c
a	c
concert	c
!	c

We	c
have	c
n't	c
met	i
each	c
other	c
so	i
long	c
time	c
and	c
I	c
'll	c
tell	c
you	c
more	c
story	i
of	i
this	c
.	c

Write	c
soon	c
,	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
about	c
wich	i
sort	c
of	c
close	i
I	c
have	c
got	c
to	c
take	c
?	c

And	c
I	c
also	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
have	c
got	c
to	c
take	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
expected	c
that	c
I	c
could	i
have	c
spend	i
a	c
wonderful	c
night	c
.	c

However	c
it	i
did	i
at	c
20:15	c
.	c

But	c
no	c
discounts	c
were	c
accepted	i
.	c

Modern	c
technology	c
has	c
really	c
changed	c
our	c
daily	c
life	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
we	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
to	c
wash	c
our	c
face	c
with	c
cold	c
water	c
even	c
if	c
it	c
is	c
freezing	i
morning	c
.	c

The	c
housekeeping	i
work	i
does	c
n't	c
take	c
much	c
time	c
thanks	c
to	c
electrical	c
equipments	i
.	c

In	i
these	i
days	c
,	c
many	c
kinds	c
of	c
pollution	c
have	c
been	c
caused	c
by	c
our	c
modern	c
life	i
.	c

Even	c
food	c
is	c
polluted	c
.	c

All	c
these	c
facts	c
mean	c
that	c
our	c
modern	c
life	c
gives	i
big	i
damage	c
to	c
the	c
earth	c
.	c

While	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
your	c
theatre	c
to	c
see	c
"	c
Over	c
The	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
very	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
bought	c
my	c
computer	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
n't	c
interested	c
in	c
it	c
but	c
when	c
I	c
started	c
studying	c
about	i
internet	i
and	c
playing	c
games	c
,	c
I	c
found	c
it	c
interesting	c
.	c

Sometimes	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
computer	c
addict	c
because	c
whenever	c
I	c
come	c
back	c
home	c
,	c
my	c
hand	c
go	i
to	c
computer	i
swich	i
,	c
automaticaly	i
,	c
even	c
though	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
want	c
to	c
use	c
the	c
computer	c
.	c

I	c
write	c
this	c
letter	c
to	c
informed	i
you	c
about	c
the	c
bad	c
experience	c
I	c
had	c
last	c
week	c
in	i
one	c
of	c
the	c
shows	c
your	c
are	c
presenting	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
realy	i
desappointed	i
,	c
and	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
have	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

After	c
that	c
,	c
when	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
finished	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
going	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
,	c
and	c
a	c
man	c
that	c
works	c
there	c
told	c
me	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
,	c
and	c
he	c
do	i
n't	i
want	c
to	c
give	c
me	c
reasons	i
.	c

You	c
can	i
see	i
that	c
you	c
promise	i
me	c
I	i
'll	i
have	c
a	c
good	c
evening	c
and	c
I	c
realy	i
do	i
n't	i
have	i
it	i
.	c

So	c
I	c
suggest	c
,	i
you	c
give	c
me	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
,	c
or	c
I	c
would	i
go	c
to	c
the	c
police	c
,	c
because	c
you	c
lie	i
to	c
me	c
and	c
you	c
know	c
what	c
it	i
means	c

Cry	c

25	c

The	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c

I	c
thing	i
that	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
competition	i
which	c
was	c
organised	c
by	c
your	c
agency	c
and	c
I	c
must	c
say	c
that	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
surprised	c
when	c
I	c
received	c
the	c
result	c
of	c
the	c
competition	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
,	i
I	c
could	c
have	c
an	i
holiday	c
just	i
in	c
July	c
because	c
I	c
will	c
have	c
been	c
working	c
in	i
my	c
previous	i
company	c
for	c
one	c
year	c
by	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
the	c
June	c
and	c
I	c
will	c
have	c
a	c
one	i
month	i
holiday	c
period	i
from	c
my	c
company	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
to	i
hear	i
from	c
you	c
.	c

After	c
that	c
I	c
applied	c
and	c
they	c
accepted	c
my	c
application	c
.	c

I	c
helped	c
to	c
carry	c
huge	c
speakers	c
to	c
the	c
concert	c
venue	c
.	c

He	c
loves	c
to	c
read	c
books	c
.	c

Teenagers	c
usually	c
think	c
about	c
a	c
matter	c
which	c
is	c
drugs	c
.	c

And	c
the	c
way	c
is	c
love	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
friends	c
are	c
not	c
suitable	c
to	i
do	i
this	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
quite	c
dificult	i
for	c
me	c
because	c
there	c
are	c
4	c
of	c
them	c
I	c
like	c
a	c
lot	c
wich	i
are	c
climbing	c
,	c
tennis	c
,	c
surfing	c
and	c
photography	c
,	c
but	c
if	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
make	c
a	c
choise	i
,	c
I	c
choose	c
climbing	c
and	c
surfing	c
.	c

But	c
in	i
the	i
other	i
hand	i
,	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
done	i
surfing	c
,	i
I	c
am	c
a	c
completely	i
Beginer	i
but	c
I	c
am	c
dieing	i

do	c
it	c

If	c
there	c
is	c
,	c
please	c
let	c
me	c
know	c

And	c
finally	c
a	c
view	i
of	c
all	c
the	c
students	c
leaving	c
the	c
school	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
nice	c
end	i
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

Anyway	c
,	c
to	c
participate	c
in	c
two-weeks	c
Camp	i
California	c
in	c
the	c
U.S.A	c
I	c
readily	c
give	c
you	c
my	c
personal	c
details	c
and	c
information	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
the	c
most	c
favorable	i
time	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
travel	c
is	c
July	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
in	c
the	c
final	c
year	c
of	c
University	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
attend	c
classes	c
for	c
a	c
thesis	c
almost	c
throughout	c
the	c
year	c
apart	c
from	c
July	c
,	c
when	c
I	c
can	c
take	c
a	c
relatively	c
long	c
summer	c
holiday	c
.	c

Second	i
of	i
all	i
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
log	c
cabins	c
to	c
staying	c
in	c
tents	c
,	c
since	c
I	c
have	c
had	c
a	c
horrible	c
experience	c
being	c
attaked	i
by	c
a	c
herd	i
of	c
midges	c
,	c
when	c
I	c
camped	c
out	c
.	c

Also	c
should	c
I	c
take	c
some	c
money	c
just	c
in	c
case	c
?	c

This	c
may	c
also	c
contribute	c
to	c
the	c
promotion	c
of	c
English	i
department	c
.	c

As	c
the	c
record	c
says	c
,	c
our	c
hockey	c
team	c
has	c
been	c
on	i
the	c
top	c
of	c
the	c
league	c
for	c
three	c
successive	c
years	c
.	c

The	i
science	i
and	c
technology	c
have	c
changed	c
my	c
life	i
every	i
day	i
.	c

When	c
we	c
think	c
about	c
clothes	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
,	c
we	c
should	c
think	c
about	c
the	c
enviroment	i
first	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
not	c
pleasant	c
to	c
say	c
the	c
earth	c
is	c
now	c
facing	c
some	c
serious	c
problems	c
.	c

We	c
should	c
consider	c
wearing	i
as	i
in	i
more	i
practical	i
way	i
.	c

During	c
my	c
stay	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
see	c
a	c
musical	c
show	c
in	i
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
and	c
I	c
have	i
very	i
disappointing	c
evening	c
.	c

What	c
is	c
more	c
you	i
advertize	i
there	c
were	c
discounts	c
available	c
but	c
it	i
were	c
not	c
.	c

We	c
lived	c
in	c
the	c
same	c
street	c
and	c
the	i
weekends	i
we	i
spent	i
together	i
.	c

But	c
when	c
Pat	c
drank	c
some	c
beer	c
she	c
told	c
him	c
everything	c
about	c
me	c
.	c

Finally	c
we	c
had	i
no	i
perfect	i
evening	c
at	c
all	c
!	c

It	c
was	c
quiet	i
scary	c
for	c
me	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
said	c
to	c
myself	c
,	c
come	c
on	c
you	c
can	c
do	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
walked	c
first	i
with	c
Pat	c
and	c
two	c
of	c
my	c
friends	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
tried	c
to	i
get	i
not	i
in	c
panic	i
,	c
but	c
no	i
chance	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
so	c
worried	c
not	i
to	i
find	i
the	c
way	c
out	c
,	i
that	c
I	c
started	c
to	c
scream	c
and	c
cry	c
.	c

17th	c
June	c
2000	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
!	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
this	c
letter	c
to	c
you	c
,	c
because	c
the	c
show	c
"	c
Over	c
The	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
which	i
is	c
the	i
London	c
's	c
newest	c
and	c
best	c
musical	c
show	c
,	c
was	c
not	c
...	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

And	c
I	c
was	c
really	c
disappointed	c
when	c
I	c
saw	c
Jeremy	c
Brook	c
on	c
the	c
stage	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
be	c
gratefull	i
if	c
you	c
could	c
correct	c
too	c
that	i
show	i
start	i
at	i
20.15	i
not	i
on	i
19.30	i
.	c

That	c
evening	c
which	i
should	c
be	i
my	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
,	c
was	c
in	c
fact	c
very	c
tireing	i
and	c
boring	c
.	c

Best	c
regardes	i
!	c

Everyone	c
gathered	c
in	c
disco	i
at	c
21.00	c
.	c

She	c
was	c
so	c
touched	c
that	c
we	c
started	c
to	c
cry	c
.	c

Enyway	i
the	c
disco	c
was	c
great	c
,	c
music	i
also	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
reach	c
the	c
camp	c
in	c
july	i
,	c
and	c
spend	c
there	c
the	c
last	c
two	c
weeks	c
of	c
the	c
month	c
because	c
in	c
August	c
I	c
must	c
start	c
studying	c
for	c
my	c
examinations	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
,	c
for	c
instance	c
,	c
whether	c
the	c
evenings	c
there	c
are	c
cold	c
or	c
hot	c
.	c

When	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
I	c
was	c
on	c
the	c
stage	c
close	c
to	c
famous	i
singers	c
,	c
Bono	c
Vox	c
and	c
David	c
Bowie	c
.	c

I	i
think	i
I	i
wo	i
n't	i
never	i
forget	i
that	i
evening	i
.	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
reply	c
your	i
letter	c
about	c
my	i
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
and	c
give	i
you	c
all	c
information	i
for	c
my	c
two	c
weeks	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
the	c
two	c
activities	c
wich	i
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
pratice	i
during	c
the	c
campsite	i
are	c
sailing	c
and	c
surfing	c
.	c

Is	c
there	c
any	c
problem	c
?	c

However	c
sometimes	c
it	c
is	c
n't	c
so	c
wonderful	c
as	c
it	c
seems	c
to	c
be	c
.	c

And	c
do	c
n't	c
try	c
to	c
complain	c
to	c
someone	c
else	c
because	c
they	c
wo	c
n't	c
hear	c
you	c
.	c

As	c
far	c
as	c
I	c
am	c
concerned	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
an	i
accomodation	i
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
,	c
but	c
in	c
case	c
there	c
are	c
no	c
cabins	c
left	c
I	c
can	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
tend	i
as	c
well	c
.	c

I	i
've	i
seen	i
your	c
festival	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
my	c
suggestions	c
to	i
it	c
.	c

And	c
your	c
last	c
festival	c
was	c
very	c
intresting	i
too	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
you	c
must	c
invite	c
artists	c
and	c
stars	c
from	c
more	c
countries	c
around	c
the	c
world	c
,	c
because	c
there	c
are	i
people	c
only	c
from	c
six	c
countries	c
.	c

Jazz	c
,	c
rock	c
and	c
classical	c
concerts	c
are	c
amazing	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
some	c
concert	c
halls	c
are	c
too	c
small	c
,	c
so	c
not	c
everybody	c
can	c
come	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
will	c
continue	c
to	i
making	i
your	c
festivals	c
.	c

How	c
are	c
you	c
?	c

The	c
question	c
you	c
asked	c
me	c
in	c
it	c
is	c
very	c
original	c
too	c
.	c

We	c
are	c
all	c
very	c
friendly	c
in	c
our	c
class	c
and	c
we	c
help	c
to	i
each	c
other	c
when	c
we	c
have	c
a	c
problem	c
.	c

So	c
the	c
main	c
rule	c
in	c
our	c
school	c
is	c
regarding	i
theachers	i
.	c

I	c
'm	c
allowed	c
to	c
do	c
many	c
things	c
at	c
home	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
there	c
is	c
n't	c
something	i
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
change	c
.	c

Then	c
how	c
does	i
it	c
changed	c
our	c
daily	c
life	c
?	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
and	c
your	c
organisation	c
for	c
giving	c
me	c
this	c
opportunity	c
.	c

I	c
can	c
only	c
travel	c
during	c
July	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
many	i
A-levels	i
examinations	c
to	c
take	c
during	c
June	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
staying	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
n't	c
done	c
it	c
before	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
give	c
it	c
a	c
go	c
.	c

Another	c
question	c
is	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
do	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
with	c
me	c
(	c
roughly	c
)	c
?	c

How	c
are	c
you	c
?	c

I	c
did	c
n't	c
get	c
involved	c
that	c
much	c
in	c
writing	c
a	i
script	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
very	c
hard	c
and	c
the	c
director	c
wrote	c
most	c
of	c
it	c
but	c
the	c
main	c
idea	c
of	i
the	c
background	c
of	c
the	c
stage	c
was	c
my	i
,	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
proud	c
of	c
it	c
.	c

When	c
they	i
've	i
finished	i
singing	c
the	c
last	c
song	c
I	c
was	c
surprice	i
when	c
they	c
called	c
me	c
up	c
on	c
the	c
stage	c
and	c
said	c
thank	c
you	c
to	c
me	c
in	c
front	c
of	c
hundreds	c
of	c
people	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
not	c
goot	i
at	c
both	i
of	c
them	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
been	c
interested	c
in	c
them	c
so	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
turn	i
up	i
them	i
on	i
this	i
chance	i
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

I	c
'm	c
sorry	c
about	c
that	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
to	c
make	c
the	c
fan	i
to	i
keep	i
a	i
queue	c
.	c

Best	c
whishes	i

I	c
wonder	c
if	c
it	c
is	c
possible	c
for	c
next	c
year	c
to	c
have	c
more	c
artists	c
and	c
also	c
bigger	c
concert	c
halls	c
.	c

In	c
fact	c
I	c
have	c
noticed	c
that	c
some	c
concert	i
need	i
to	i
more	c
space	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
not	c
expensive	c
and	c
easy	i
to	c
use	c
,	c
because	c
it	i
was	c
only	c
one	c
for	c
all	c
the	c
events	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
interesting	c
to	c
invite	c
young	c
compositors	i
to	c
hear	c
news	i
from	c
the	i
classical	c
music	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
receiving	c
your	c
reply	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
O.K.	c
I	c
've	c
just	c
received	c
your	c
letter	c
and	c
I	c
'm	c
going	c
to	c
reply	c
to	c
your	c
questions	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
we	c
have	c
to	c
wear	i
in	c
appropriate	i
way	c
,	c
not	c
talk	c
to	c
each	c
other	c
during	c
the	c
lessons	c
and	c
pay	c
attention	c
to	c
the	c
teachers	c
.	c

Before	c
this	c
rule	c
it	c
was	c
funny	c
(	c
new	c
sound	c
in	c
class	c
,	c
phones	c
ring	c
or	c
sing.	c
)	c
,	c
but	c
not	c
for	c
our	c
headmaster	c
.	c

For	c
me	c
,	c
it	c
's	c
very	c
stressfull	i
and	c
I	c
usually	c
run	c
a	c
lot	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
.	c

In	c
fact	c
(	c
you	c
know	c
)	c
I	c
like	c
cheat	i
with	c
my	c
class	i
mates	i
after	c
our	c
lessons	c
.	c

Neighbours	c
have	c
complained	c
about	c
loud	c
music	c
.	c

Write	c
to	c
me	c
soon	c
about	c
news	c
in	c
your	c
life	c

Will	i
I	i
need	i

Introduction	c

Why	c
to	i
film	i
the	c
school	c
?	c

Firstly	c
we	c
should	c
film	c
our	c
school	c
to	c
show	c
how	c
important	c
it	c
is	c
for	c
our	c
growing	i
.	c

A	c
good	c
place	i
to	i
be	i
filmed	i
is	c
our	c
Geography	c
class	c
.	c

The	c
discovery	c
of	c
the	c
ôInternational	c
Arts	c
Festivalö	c
was	c
a	c
pleasure	c
for	c
me	c
because	c
it	c
gave	c
me	c
the	c
opportunity	c
to	c
enjoy	c
onto	i
a	c
really	c
nice	c
environment	c
.	c

The	c
proposal	i
of	i
reasonably-piced	i
package	c
including	i
tickets	c
and	c
accomodations	i
,	c
well	c
supported	i
my	c
personal	c
organization	i

comfortable	c

easy	i
to	c

and	c
booked	i
tickets	c
can	c
help	c
you	c
if	c
you	c
decide	c
at	i
last	i
minute	c
.	c

The	c
aim	c
to	c
satisfy	c
different	c
interests	c
should	c
not	c
let	i
the	c
quality	c
decrease	i
.	c

Anyway	c
,	c
the	c
best	c
suggestion	c
is	c
always	c
the	c
ôbest	c
ideaö	c
,	c
the	c
famous	c
ôsuch	c
a	c
good	c
ideaö	c
that	c

your	c
lifeà	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
informing	c
me	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
not	c
travel	c
in	c
June	c
and	c
May	c
because	c
I	c
will	c
have	c
my	c
standard	c
grade	c
exam	c
during	c
these	c
two	c
months	c
.	c

I	c
felt	c
really	c
uncomfortable	c
in	c
the	c
tent	c
.	c

I	c
enjoy	c
doing	c
it	c
very	c
much	c
.	c

Would	c
it	c
be	c
possible	c
for	c
you	c
to	c
send	c
me	c
a	c
map	c
of	c
california	i
so	c
I	c
know	c
where	c
the	c
camp	i
site	i
is	c
situated	c
?	c

I	c
would	c
be	c
grateful	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
send	c
me	c
some	c
information	c
.	c

How	c
are	c
you	c
getting	c
on	c
with	c
your	c
school	c
work	c
?	c

Do	c
you	c
enjoy	c
your	c
schoollife	i
?	c

When	c
I	c
first	c
entred	i
the	c
concert	c
hall	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
given	c
a	c
pass	c
for	c
working	c
here	c
.	c

I	c
found	c
that	c
they	c
were	c
all	c
Kelly	c
's	c
fans	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
choosen	i
the	i
activities	c
surfing	c
and	c
photography	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Sometimes	c
they	c
give	c
me	c
a	c
bad	c
feeling	c
as	i
,,customer	i
treat	i
with	i
order	i
"	i
.	c

He	c
wanted	c
everything	c
what	i
his	c
eyes	c
saw	c
.	c

At	i
first	i
,	c
all	c
the	c
students	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
thank	i
you	i
for	c
this	c
great	c
idea	c
of	c
a	c
trip	c
in	i
London	c
during	i
three	c
days	c
.	c

Otherwise	i
,	c
all	c
the	c
class	c
have	c
seen	c
an	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
"	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
"	c
,	c
and	c
we	c
are	c
all	c
interested	c
to	i
see	i
this	c
show	c
,	c
this	c
is	c
why	c
I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
arrived	c
in	c
front	c
of	c
the	c
bank	c
,	c
my	c
heart	c
was	c
going	c
faster	c
.	c

I	c
had	i
n't	i
never	i
seen	c
so	c
much	c
money	c
.	c

I	c
do	i
n't	i
expected	i
that	c
I	c
can	i
win	c
in	i
your	i
's	i
competition	c
.	c

I	c
Love	c
all	c
kind	i
of	c
water	c
sports	c
.	c

In	c
summer	c
I	c
always	c
goes	i
to	c
seaside	i
or	c
some	c
kind	c
of	c
lake	c
to	c
swim	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
about	c
weather	i
at	i
California	i
's	i
Julay	i
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
like	c
biology	c
,	c
sow	i
I	c
sleept	i
on	c
the	c
desk	c
in	c
a	c
class-room	i
.	c

I	c
had	c
dreamt	c
about	c
visiting	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
to	c
see	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
's	c
performance	c
for	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
.	c

Although	c
you	c
mentioned	c
it	i
in	c
your	c
advertisement	c
.	c

And	c
,	c
finally	c
,	c
right	c
before	c
the	c
starting	i
they	c
announced	c
that	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
woud	i
not	c
be	c
in	c
the	c
show	c
that	c
evening	c
.	c

As	i
a	i
whole	i
,	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
I	c
got	c
something	c
completely	c
different	c
from	c
what	c
I	c
had	c
expected	c
to	c
get	c
.	c

At	c
any	c
time	c
of	c
a	i
day	c
I	c
may	c
contact	c
any	c
person	c
at	i
any	c
part	c
of	c
the	c
world	c
over	c
phone	i
.	c

The	c
show	c
should	c
have	c
started	c
t	i
19.30	c
.	c

The	c
tickets	c
were	c
sold	c
for	c
£	c
10	c
,	c
£	c
15	c
and	c
£	c
20	c
.	c

We	c
would	c
probably	c
think	c
that	c
these	c
things	c
they	c
wore	c
were	c
just	c
to	c
cover	c
and	c
protect	c
themselves	c
.	c

Nowadays	c
the	c
aim	c
in	i
clothing	c
is	c
not	c
just	c
for	c
covering	c
and	c
protecting	c
ourselves	c
.	c

The	c
things	c
we	c
wear	c
may	c
not	c
seem	c
as	i
if	i
'	c
clothes	c
'	c
to	c
the	c
ones	c
who	c
will	c
live	c
100	c
years	c
from	c
now	c
.	c

Dear	c
,	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
.	i

We	c
regard	i
that	c
the	c
show	c
might	c
be	c
great	i
opportunity	c
for	c
the	i
most	c
of	c
us	c
who	c
are	c
interested	c
in	c
fashion	c
and	c
leisure	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
appreciated	i
you	i
for	c
offering	c
a	c
well-organised	c
programme	c
,	c
especially	c
,	c
the	c
London	c
fashion	c
and	c
leisure	c
show	c
which	c
is	c
difficult	c
for	c
us	c
to	c
take	c
part	c
in	c
.	c

It	c
made	c
woman	i
to	i
be	i
free	c
from	c
drudgery	c
,	c
so	c
that	c
they	c
could	c
utilize	c
time	c
for	c
improving	c
themselves	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

I	c
need	c
to	c
insist	c
in	i
it	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
not	c
able	c
to	c
take	c
holidays	c
during	c
the	c
rest	c
of	c
the	c
year	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Ryan	c

Please	c
do	c
not	c
hesitate	c
to	c
contact	c
me	c

you	c

From	c

Brigitte	c
Bourgeois	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
suggest	c
to	i
film	i
our	c
library	c
because	i
it	c
is	c
a	c
pleasant	c
place	c
that	c
students	c
really	c
like	c
and	i
the	c
English	c
course	i
which	i
will	c
help	c
foreign	c
students	c
for	i
their	c
future	c
choice	i
.	c

Another	c
problem	c
is	c
,	i
I	c
realised	i
that	c
the	i
discounts	c
were	c
available	c
.	c

Your	i
faithfully	c
,	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrects	i
.	c

However	c
,	c
we	c
are	c
not	c
friends	c
anymore	c
because	c
of	c
a	c
secrect	i
in	i
the	i
past	i
.	c

I	c
told	c
Pat	c
that	c
my	c
father	c
and	c
mother	c
were	c
going	c
to	c
seperate	i
.	c

They	c
tried	c
to	c
contact	c
with	i
my	c
parents	c
.	c

My	c
parents	c
were	c
very	c
angry	c
when	c
they	c
realised	c
what	c
happened	i
.	c

I	c
have	c
just	c
received	c
your	c
letter	c
where	c
you	c
stated	c
that	c
I	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
of	i
the	c
competition	c
of	i
which	c
I	c
need	c
more	c
information	c
.	c

To	c
begin	c
with	c
,	c
in	c
your	c
letter	c
you	c
asked	c
me	c
when	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travell	i
.	c

You	c
mentioned	c
the	c
chance	c
to	c
choose	c
two	c
activities	c
from	c
you	i
list	c
.	c

Could	c
you	c
also	c
let	c
me	c
know	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
and	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
would	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
.	c

GYM	c

As	i
accommnodation	i
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
log	i
cabins	i
because	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
safier	i
than	c
in	i
a	c
tent	c
.	c

There	c
is	c
another	c
thing	c
I	c
would	c
know	i
,	i
what	i
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
have	i
I	c
bring	c
with	c
me	c
?	c

My	i
mother	i
,	i
whereas	i
was	c
very	c
keen	c
on	c
shopping	c
everything	i
.	c

After	c
the	c
show	c
I	c
planned	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
restaurant	c
with	c
my	c
wife	c
,	c
but	c
what	c
do	c
you	c
think	c
it	i
happened	c
?	c

Classmate	c
Secret	c
Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
for	c
his	c
classmate	c
.	c

All	i
started	c
when	c
Pat	c
,	c
the	i
best	i
friend	i
of	i
Nick	i
,	c
wanted	c
to	c
make	i
the	c
party	c
in	i
his	c
house	c
,	i
most	i
of	c
the	c
class	c
disagree	i
with	c
that	c
because	c
the	c
house	i
of	i
Pat	i
is	c
extremly	i
little	c
,	c
they	c
started	c
to	c
say	c
him	i
that	c
his	c
house	c
was	c
like	c
a	c
box	c
.	c

Pat	c
got	c
very	c
angree	i
and	c
sad	c
.	c

And	c
being	c
a	c
photographer	c
during	c
my	c
spare	c
time	c
and	c
a	c
swimmer	c
since	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
child	c
,	c
these	c
will	c
be	c
the	c
activities	c
I	i
'll	i
like	c
to	c
do	c
while	c
at	c
the	c
camp	c
-	c
I	c
think	c
I	c
am	c
fairly	c
good	c
at	c
doing	c
both	c
things	c
!	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
joining	c
you	c
in	c
July	c
and	c
hoping	c
for	i
this	c
trip	c
to	i
be	i
an	c
amazing	c
experience	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
difficult	c
to	c
see	c
any	c
enjoyment	c
in	c
shopping	c
:	c
facing	c
the	c
crowd	c
,	c
having	c
to	c
withstand	c
the	c
rude	c
clerks	c
and	c
shop	c
managers	c
,	c
trying	c
desperately	c
to	c
choose	c
the	c
right	c
thing	c
-	c
these	c
burdens	c
form	c
the	c
dark	c
side	c
of	c
shopping	c
.	c

Believe	c
me	c
,	c
shopping	c
can	c
also	c
be	c
painful	c
.	c

Your	c
feet	c
will	c
turn	c
into	c
pancakes	c
after	c
a	c
long	c
day	c
out	c
in	c
the	c
streets	c
and	c
your	c
muscles	c
can	c
get	c
seriously	c
injured	c
after	c
carrying	c
all	c
those	c
bags	c
which	c
contain	c
loads	c
of	c
objects	c
.	c

Nonetheless	c
,	c
people	c
still	c
find	c
some	c
obscure	c
pleasure	c
in	c
putting	c
their	c
mental	c
health	c
at	c
stake	i

Dear	c

in	c
the	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c

couple	c
of	c
things	c
about	c
the	c

I	c
have	c
won	c

I	c

I	c
study	c
architecture	c
at	c
the	c
Polytechnics	i
in	c
Krakow	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
great	i
idea	c
for	i
doing	i
something	c
like	c
that	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
,	c
as	c
a	c
person	c
,	i
who	c
in	i
this	i
festival	i
took	i
place	i
in	i
,	c
that	c
this	i
is	i
excellent	c
,	c
because	c
we	c
can	i
spend	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
time	c
with	c
art	c
.	c

Dear	c
Kathleen	c
,	c

I	c
've	c
been	i
just	i
receiving	i
this	c
letter	c
for	i
you	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
'm	c
writting	i
you	i
.	c

I	c
hope	c
that	c
you	c
feel	c
good	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
n't	c
seen	c
you	c
for	c
two	c
years	c
.	c

We	c
also	c
learn	c
how	c
to	c
design	c
the	i
interiors	c
and	c
buildings	c
.	c

We	c
usually	c
have	c
lessons	c
at	i
the	c
morning	c
,	c
till	c
afternoon	i
.	c

After	c
a	c
few	c
months	c
we	c
go	c
somewhere	c
with	c
all	c
class	i
,	c
for	c
example	c
next	i
to	i
the	i
lake	c
,	c
and	c
there	c
we	c
are	i
paintings	i

I	c
recently	c
spent	c
a	c
week	c
in	c
London	c
and	c
during	c
my	c
stay	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
see	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
,	i
-	c
the	c
musical	c
show	i
-	i
.	c

At	c
first	c
,	c
I	c
thought	c
I	c
would	c
have	c
a	c
wonderful	c
night	c
out	c
since	c
I	c
had	c
read	c
the	c
advertisement	c
of	i
the	c
show	c
,	c
nevertheless	i
it	i
has	i
wrong	i
information	i
.	c

Besides	i
,	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
had	c
closed	c
down	c
before	c
I	c
went	i
out	i
of	i
the	c
show	c
.	c

When	c
we	c
were	c
in	i
the	i
primary	c
school	c
,	c
my	c
teacher	c
wanted	c
to	c
surprise	c
Tom	c
(	c
a	c
school	c
mate	c
)	c
for	i
his	c
10th	c
birthday	c
by	c
preparing	i
a	c
fancy	c
dress	c
party	c
in	i
the	c
school	c
.	c

We	c
had	c
been	c
preparing	c
it	c
for	c
three	c
days	c
,	c
we	c
hired	c
fancy	c
dresses	i
,	c
had	c
a	c
cake	c
made	c
by	c
a	c
cook	c
and	c
decorated	c
the	c
gymnasium	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
day	c
of	c
the	c
party	c
,	c
half	c
an	c
hour	c
before	c
it	c
started	c
,	c
Pat	c
came	c
across	c
with	c
a	c
gang	c
of	c
boys	c
from	c
another	c
course	i
.	c

Both	c
Pat	c
and	c
Tim	c
were	c
very	c
disappointed	c
that	c
day	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c

I	c
enjoyed	c
it	c
very	c
much	c
.	c

Jazz	c
,	c
rock	c
and	c
classical	c
concerts	c
,	c
plays	c
and	c
dance	c
show	i
etc.	c
The	c
specified	i
thing	c
is	i
worth	c
to	i
remind	i
here	c
is	c
the	c
reasonably-priced	c
ticket	c
for	c
all	c
events	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
excellent	c
because	c
most	c
tourist	i
could	c
offer	i
what	c
they	c
like	i
.	c

In	c
the	i
addition	c
when	i
you	c
organize	c
the	i
next	c
year	c
's	c
international	c
arts	c
festival	c
,	c
could	c
you	c
arrange	c
more	c
plays	c
and	c
films	c
.	i

It	c
is	c
lovely	c
to	c
get	c
your	c
letter	c
so	c
soon	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
country	c
the	c
children	c
go	c
to	c
the	i
secondary	c
school	c
when	c
they	c
are	c
at	i
the	c
first	c
year	c
of	c
teenage	i
.	c

At	c
home	c
,	c
in	c
my	c
experience	c
,	c
my	c
parents	c
did	c
n't	c
allow	c
me	c
to	c
go	c
out	c
in	c
the	c
evening	c
and	c
gave	c
me	c
much	i
amsh	i
homework	c
to	c
do	c
,	c
even	c
in	c
the	c
holiday	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
quite	c
sad	c
.	c

We	c
believe	c
that	c
the	c
programme	c
is	c
very	c
cood	i
and	c
well	c
organised	c
and	c
we	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
one	c
more	c
time	c
especially	i
for	c
that	c
.	c

From	c
all	c
your	c
class	c

Becaues	c
if	c
you	c
are	c
a	c
politician	c
as	i
an	i
exmaple	i
,	c
you	c
fear	c
for	c
your	c
life	c
.	c

You	c
need	c
to	c
protect	c
your	c
life	c
of	i
any	c
danger	c
.	c

Becaue	i

I	c
have	i
spent	i
my	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
recently	c
and	c
it	i
is	c
like	c
a	c
tradition	c
,	c
we	c
went	c
to	c
a	c
musical	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
n't	c
change	c
his	c
mind	c
although	c
I	i
've	i
tried	i
everything	c
.	c

I	c
also	c
used	c
to	c
join	i
the	c
school	c
choir	c
and	c
was	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
best	c
sopranos	c
.	c

First	c
I	c
am	c
good	c
enough	c
at	c
both	c
of	c
them	c
.	c

Secondly	c
I	c
truly	c
love	c
painting	c
and	c
singing	c
.	c

Another	c
thing	c
I	c
am	c
interested	c
in	c
is	c
general	c
information	c
of	i
prices	c
in	c
the	c
USA	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
amazing	c
and	c
sometimes	c
amuzing	i
how	c
charming	c
and	c
strong	c
the	c
spell	c
of	c
luxurious	c
supermarkets	c
and	c
cosy	c
little	c
shops	c
is	c
.	c

Also	c
I	c
cannot	c
go	c
on	i
other	c
holidays	c
because	c
for	c
Easter	i
holiday	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
attend	i
Tennis	i
competition	c
in	i
the	i
name	i
of	i
my	c
school	c
and	c
we	c
need	c
time	c
to	c
practise	c
.	c

In	c
Christmas	i
holiday	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
back	c
home	c
and	c
be	c
with	c
my	c
family	c
.	c

I	c
started	c
playing	c
tennis	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
9	c
,	i
now	i
I	c
am	c
18	c
years	c
old	c
.	c

I	c
attended	i
15	c
competitions	c
already	c
.	c

For	i
climbing	c
,	c
I	c
started	c
to	c
be	c
interested	c
in	c
it	c
since	i
it	i
was	c
14	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
not	c
scared	c
of	c
height	i
and	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
's	c
challenging	c
.	c

I	c
really	c
think	i
it	c
sounds	i
so	c
interesting	c
.	c

But	c
this	c
time	c
it	i
'll	i
be	c
different	c
,	c
I	c
thought	c
.	c

Do	c
you	c
know	c
that	c
this	c
concert	c
will	c
be	c
on	c
television	c
.	i

Another	c
exciting	c
part	c
was	c
,	i
I	c
had	c
to	c
climb	c
to	c
put	c
the	c
lights	c
up	c
.	c

Can	c
you	c
imagine	c
the	c
real	c
concert	c
,	c
and	c
how	c
high	c
the	c
lights	c
always	c
like	i
?	c

It	c
was	c
good	c
fun	c
though	c
!	c
,	i
but	i
my	c
friend	c
did	c
n't	c
like	c
doing	c
that	c
at	c
all	c
.	c

I	c
really	c
do	c
hope	c
I	c
can	c
be	c
like	c
them	c
.	c

My	c
teacher	c
was	c
very	c
proud	c
of	c
me	c
because	c
after	c
the	c
concert	c
,	c
all	c
the	c
staff	c
were	c
saying	c
how	c
helpful	c
I	c
was	c
and	c
so	c
on	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
organising	c
a	c
nice	c
programme	c
for	c
us	c
.	c

Especially	i
,	c
going	c
to	c
the	c
Museum	c
and	c
the	c
Art	c
Gallery	c
would	i
be	c
a	c
great	c
oppotunity	i
for	c
all	c
of	c
us	c
,	c
as	c
they	c
are	c
world-famous	c
places	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

The	i
entrance	i
fee	i
is	c
free	c
for	c
students	c
so	c
the	c
show	c
is	c
well	c
worth	c
seeing	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
if	c
we	c
could	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
Museum	c
by	c
using	c
the	c
free	c
time	c
on	c
15th	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
okay	c
although	c
we	c
could	c
not	c
go	c
shopping	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
shortly	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

It	c
was	c
dangerous	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
knew	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
.	c

Three	c
years	c
ago	c
,	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
in	c
Japan	c
,	c
my	c
parents	c
were	c
both	c
working	c
and	c
neither	c
of	c
them	c
were	c
at	c
home	c
by	c
the	c
time	c
I	c
get	i
back	c
from	c
the	i
school	c
.	c

There	c
was	c
nobody	c
to	c
let	c
me	c
in	c
,	c
noway	i
to	c
contact	c
with	i
my	c
parents	c
.	c

What	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
do	c
was	c
getting	i
into	c
the	c
house	c
by	c
climbing	c
up	i
the	c
roof	c
because	c
I	c
knew	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
windows	c
was	c
unlocked	c
.	c

I	c
enjoyed	c
the	c
festival	c
pretty	i
much	c
.	c

I	c
believe	c
that	c
next	c
year	c
will	c
be	c
better	c
if	c
you	c
consider	c
my	c
ideas	c
.	c

Your	i
Sinccerly	i

I	c
'm	c
really	c
tired	c
of	c
the	c
rules	c
in	c
school	c
!	c

Actually	c
not	c
all	c
the	c
schools	c
in	c
Turkey	c
are	c
so	c
strict	c
but	c
unfortunatly	i
the	c
school	c
that	c
I	c
'm	c
going	c
is	i
like	c
a	c
military	c
camp	c
.	c

The	c
uniform	c
,	i
we	c
are	i
wearing	i
has	c
to	c
be	c
perfect	c
.	c

No	c
one	c
is	c
allowed	c
to	c
wear	c
anything	c
which	c
is	c
n't	c
written	c
in	c
the	c
school	c
rules	c
.	c

The	c
general	c
rules	c
which	c
are	c
used	c
in	c
all	c
schools	c
are	c
n't	c
so	c
strict	c
however	i
there	c
are	c
a	c
few	c
things	c
that	c
need	c
to	c
be	c
changed	c
.	c

However	c
there	c
is	c
one	c
thing	c
that	c
my	c
parents	c
do	c
n't	c
like	c
me	c
to	c
do	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
Camp	c
California	c
in	c
the	c
U.S.A	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
I	c
still	c
have	c
got	c
an	c
examination	c
in	c
my	c
college	c
until	c
June	c
,	c
20th	c
.	c

So	c
if	c
it	c
's	c
possible	c
could	c
you	c
arrenge	i
it	c
for	c
me	c
please	c
.	c

I	c
imagine	c
I	c
could'n	i
sleep	c
at	c
all	c
.	c

They	c
are	c
my	c
two	c
choices	c
of	c
activities	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

Yumi	c
Nakamura	c

I	c
could	c
n't	c
see	c
'	c
Hikaru	c
'	c
but	c
I	c
still	c
could	c
hear	c
her	c
songs	c
.	c

Some	c
of	c
funs	i
were	c
not	c
good	c
at	c
all	c
because	c
they	c
shouted	c
and	c
argued	c
,	c
but	c
most	c
of	c
people	i
were	c
very	c
good	c
.	c

Sincerely	c
Yours	c

13	c
July	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
:	c

Well	c
,	c
you	c
want	c
to	c
know	c
what	c
I	c
did	c
in	i
the	c
concert	c
?	c

About	c
20	c
people	c
were	c
helping	c
apart	c
from	c
me	c
,	i
we	i
had	c
some	i
kind	c
of	c
rotation	c
system	c
so	c
that	c
all	c
the	c
volunteers	c
could	c
also	c
enjoy	c
some	c
of	c
the	c
concert	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
so	c
fun	c
,	c
that	i
I	c
enjoyed	c
it	c
a	c
lot	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
really	c
a	c
very	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
.	c

Additionally	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
instead	c
of	c
19:30	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
pay	c
the	c
full	c
price	c
for	c
my	c
ticket	c
as	c
no	c
discount	c
was	c
available	c
.	c

To	c
take	c
my	c
personal	c
example	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
be	i
no	i
more	i
able	c
to	c
live	c
without	c
some	c
of	c
the	c
most	c
recent	c
discoveries	c
,	c
which	c
make	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
easier	c
.	c

However	c
it	i
would	c
be	i
too	c
long	c
to	c
list	c
them	c
all	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
quite	c
sure	c
that	c
you	c
also	i
know	i
them	c
as	c
they	c
do	c
n't	c
change	c
only	c
my	c
life	c
,	c
but	c
everybody	c
's	c
daily	c
life	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
if	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
some	c
money	c
,	c
or	c
everything	i
is	c
provided	c
for	i
the	c
organisers	c
.	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

A	c
few	c
minutes	c
later	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
and	c
the	c
grup	i
appeared	c
on	c
the	c
stage	c
.	c

Then	c
,	c
they	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
airport	c
,	c
and	c
my	c
dream	c
finished	c
.	c

Having	c
seen	c
your	c
musical	c
show	c
last	c
Sunday	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
the	i
problems	c
and	c
to	c
ask	c
for	c
some	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

As	c
well	c
as	c
this	c
,	c
after	c
seeing	c
the	c
musical	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
,	c
which	c
you	c
referred	c
in	i
your	c
advertisement	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
already	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Do	c
n't	c
be	c
surprised	c
!	c

You	c
are	c
supposed	c
to	c
listen	c
to	c
them	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
good	i
chance	c
for	c
you	c
to	c
improve	c
your	c
English	c
.	c

Kwa	c
Phat	c
Sun	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
this	c
letter	c
,	i
concerning	c
the	c
information	c
you	c
have	c
asked	c
me	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
be	c
grateful	c
to	i
tell	i
me	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
will	c
need	c
with	c
me	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
the	c
best	c
experience	c
I	c
've	c
ever	c
had	c
in	c
my	c
whole	c
life	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
a	c
very	c
disapointing	i
evening	c
because	c
of	c
many	c
things	c
.	c

then	i
it	c
start	i
's	i
45	c
minutes	c
lent	i
.	c

Your	i
's	i
faithfully	c
,	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
,	c
because	c
after	c
I	c
told	c
her	c
that	c
I	c
have	i
a	c
new	c
girlfriend	c
,	c
all	c
the	c
school	c
knows	i
it	c
in	c
lees	i
than	c
2	c
hours	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
really	c
happy	c
to	c
know	c
that	c
I	c
won	c
in	i
your	c
competition	c
.	c

And	c
first	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
before	c
to	i
ask	i
for	c
informations	i
about	c
the	c
travel	i
,	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
tell	i
you	i
thanks	c
a	c
lot	c
.	c

For	i
the	c
accomodation	i
,	c
if	c
is	i
possible	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
camping	i
because	c
I	c
think	c
is	i
a	c
relaxing	c
place	c
where	i
to	c
stay	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
for	c
further	c
informations	i
about	c
this	c
travel	i
.	c

And	c
if	c
during	c
the	c
nights	c
there	c
are	c
entrotenements	i
?	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

In	c
fact	c
if	c
I	c
'm	c
not	c
in	c
the	c
right	c
mood	c
I	c
become	c
nervous	i
because	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
find	c
anything	c
.	c

I	c
had	i
recently	i
spent	i
two	c
days	c
at	c
your	c
annual	c
international	c
arts	c
festival	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
the	c
first	c
time	c
I	c
went	i
and	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
pleased	c
to	c
go	c
.	c

I	i
,	i
actually	i
,	i
was	c
n't	c
disappointed	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
congratulate	c
you	c
on	c
making	i
this	c
kind	c
of	c
event	c
.	c

Therefore	i
,	c
you	c
could	c
invite	c
artists	c
from	c
around	c
the	c
world	c
not	i
only	c
from	c
six	c
countries	c
:	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
more	c
pleasant	c
.	c

Perhaps	c
,	i
you	c
could	c
possibly	c
meet	i
some	c
producers	c
,	i
who	c
come	c
from	c
others	i
countries	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
show	c
different	c
cultures	c
.	c

Besides	i
,	c
to	c
pay	i
one	c
reasonably-priced	c
weekend	c
ticket	c
for	c
all	c
events	c
is	c
excellent	c
because	c
we	c
could	c
see	c
all	c
that	c
we	c
wanted	c
without	c
paying	c
each	c
time	c
.	c

To	c
begin	c
with	c
the	c
wchool	i
rules	c
we	i
have	c
in	c
fact	c
some	c
important	c
ones	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
when	c
you	c
arrive	c
late	c
at	i
your	c
lesson	c
,	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
apologize	c
you	i
to	c
your	c
teacher	c
.	c

Also	c
when	i
you	c
have	c
forgotten	c
to	c
do	c
your	c
homeworks	i
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
really	c
want	c
to	c
change	c
that	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
just	i
like	c
this	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

Second	c
thing	c
,	c
you	c
should	c
open	c
the	c
show	c
on	c
time	c
because	c
if	c
the	c
audience	c
have	c
to	c
wait	c
,	c
they	c
will	c
not	c
feel	c
happy	i
but	i
I	c
think	c
you	c
know	c
that	c
.	c

The	c
technology	c
make	i
my	i
daily	i
life	i
change	i
a	c
lots	i
compare	i
to	i
the	i
past	i
.	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
the	i
modern	c
technology	c
has	c
changed	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
in	c
bad	c
ways	c
and	c
good	c
ways	c
.	c

This	c
is	c
the	c
reason	c
that	c
I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
in	c
Central	i
Exhibition	c
Hall	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
free	c
to	i
students	c
.	c

Futuristic	c
Designs	c
Of	c
People	c
's	c
Homes	c

Can	c
you	c
imagine	c
?	c

I	c
guess	c
there	c
will	c
be	c
more	c
gadget	i
to	c
do	i
some	i
housework	c
easier	c
.	c

We	c
'll	c
be	c
stuck	c
to	c
our	c
computers	c
at	c
home	c
.	c

It	c
means	c
we	c
'll	c
lose	c
our	c
social	c
lifes	i
.	c

But	c
we	c
ca	c
n't	c
stop	c
to	i
technologic	i
improvement	i
.	c

We	c
should	c
use	c
it	i
in	c
positif	i
ways	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
future	c
life	c
will	c
be	c
more	c
artifitual	i
than	c
I	i
had	i
been	i
before	i
.	c

Because	c
human	i
population	c
is	c
growing	c
quickly	c
and	c
people	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
big	i
cities	c
(	c
like	c
London	c
,	c
New	c
York	c
,	c
Paris	c
)	c
.	c

Dear	c
Madam	c
:	c

About	c
the	c
information	c
required	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
is	i
my	c
half	c
term	c
at	c
University	i
and	c
summer	i
time	i
would	c
be	c
ideal	c
.	c

For	i
accommodation	c
I	i
would	c
rather	c
go	i
in	c
a	c
tent	c
,	i
I	c
want	c
to	c
enjoy	c
wild	i
life	i
and	c
admire	c
the	c
landscape	c
.	c

In	i
relation	i
with	i
leisure	c
activities	c
,	c
my	c
favourites	i
are	i
Basketball	c
,	c
which	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
playing	c
for	c
two	c
years	c
because	i
I	c
have	c
been	c
selected	c
for	c
my	c
University	i
team	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
a	i
time	c
practising	c
with	c
players	c
from	c
different	c
countries	c
will	c
help	c
me	c
develop	c
my	c
skills	c
at	c
international	i
level	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
working	c
helping	c
to	c
mantle	i
and	c
dismantle	c
the	c
stage	c
,	i
sometimes	i
I	c
had	c
to	c
check	c
the	c
sound	c
by	c
saying	c
something	c
on	i
the	c
microphone	c
,	i
that	i
was	c
my	c
chance	c
and	c
I	c
always	c
pretended	c
to	c
be	c
a	c
singer	c
and	c
that	c
I	c
sand	i
in	c
duo	i
with	c
the	c
vocalist	c
of	c
the	c
group	c
,	i
it	i
was	c
such	c
a	i
great	c
fun	c
!	c

As	c
you	c
offered	c
me	c
two	c
activities	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
on	i
swimming	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
not	c
a	c
good	c
swimmer	c
yet	c
but	c
soon	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
something	c
really	c
exciting	c
to	c
share	c
with	c
you	c
.	c

There	c
was	c
a	c
concert	i
of	i
Michael	i
Jackson	i
in	c
my	c
city	c
last	c
month	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
college	c
butty	i

about	c
something	c
very	c
good	c
in	c
your	c
life	c
.	c

St	c
Albans	c

In	c
addition	c
to	c
this	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
did	c
not	c
start	c
on	c
time	c
,	c
19:30	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
wait	c
for	c
45	c
minutes	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
when	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
I	c
found	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

Yours	c
Faithfully	c

THE	c
REVOLUTION	c
OF	c
INFORMATION	c
TECHNOLOGY	c

13	c
.	c

It	c
would	c
be	c
great	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
U.S.A	c
as	c
the	c
prize	c
and	c
to	c
stay	c
for	c
two	c
weeks	c
.	c

And	c
also	c
the	c
reason	c
why	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
surfing	c
is	c
that	c
I	c
am	c
always	c
dreaming	c
of	c
surfing	c
on	c
the	c
coast	c
of	c
California	c
like	c
on	c
TV	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
tried	c
to	c
surf	c
yet	c
,	c
which	c
doe	i
n't	i
mean	c
I	c
am	c
bad	c
at	c
swimming	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
you	c
to	c
let	c
me	c
know	c
which	c
clothes	c
would	c
be	c
suitable	c
for	c
the	c
weather	c
at	c
that	c
time	c
and	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
should	c
take	c
.	c

There	c
are	c
a	c
few	c
reasons	c
.	c

And	c
also	c
you	c
would	c
have	c
to	c
thread	c
your	c
way	c
between	c
the	c
shoppers	c
because	c
there	c
are	c
too	c
many	c
shoppers	c
,	c
especially	c
,	i
on	c
the	i
special	c
occasion	i
like	c
on	i
sale	i
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
you	c
cannot	c
exclude	i
that	c
you	c
might	c
get	c
a	i
pick-pocket	c
which	c
would	c
make	c
you	c
upset	c
and	c
irritated	c
when	c
you	c
think	c
of	c
that	i
you	c
could	c
avoid	c
it	c
and	c
that	c
you	c
could	c
take	c
less	c
money	c
in	c
your	c
wallet	c
from	i
home	i
.	c

Sometimes	c
,	c
a	c
moment	c
comes	c
up	i
that	c
you	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
buy	c
something	c
you	c
have	c
not	c
wanted	c
because	c
while	c
you	c
are	c
shopping	c
,	c
you	c
might	c
get	c
something	c
beautiful	c
or	c
good	c
to	c
you	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
no	i
more	i
a	i
young	i
girl	i
!	i
and	c
do	c
appreciate	c
a	c
little	c
bit	c
of	c
comfort	c
.	c

I	c
like	c
very	i
much	i
the	i
moutains	i
and	c
would	c
particularly	c
enjoy	c
painting	c
them	c
after	c
a	c
walk	c
.	c

I	c
've	c
got	c
four	c
children	c
and	c
have	c
to	c
organise	c
their	c
time	c
without	c
mother	i
.	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
exactly	c
which	i
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
with	c
and	i
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	i
'll	i
be	i
supposed	i
to	c
spend	c
there	c
.	c

I	c
find	c
it	c
a	i
very	c
relaxing	c
moment	i
.	c

When	c
you	c
're	c
shopping	c
,	c
you	c
can	c
finally	c
relax	c
,	c
just	c
admiring	c
what	c
you	i
're	i
seeing	i
.	c

We	c
think	c
we	c
would	c
all	c
have	c
another	c
chance	c
for	c
shopping	c
in	c
London	c
sometimes	i
later	c
.	c

We	c
are	c
sure	c
this	c
is	c
suitable	c
to	i
all	c
of	c
us	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
sure	c
all	c
the	c
things	c
which	c
are	c
based	c
on	c
electronic	c
parts	c
will	c
totally	c
change	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs.	c
Ryan	c
,	c

You	c
want	c
to	i
know	i
some	c
further	c
information	c
from	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
play	c
every	c
weekend	c
on	i
competitions	c
with	c
my	c
local	c
team	c
and	c
about	i
tennis	i
it	i
is	i
that	i
I	i
tried	i
but	i
it	i
is	i
not	i
like	i
my	i
basketball	i
experience	i
.	c

Please	c
write	c
me	i
your	i
answer	c
as	c
quick	i
as	c
possible	c
.	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

You	c
see	c
the	c
stars	c
so	c
near	c
and	c
also	c
you	c
can	c
chat	c
with	c
them	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
maybe	i
hard	c
work	c
for	c
a	c
while	c
but	c
I	c
was	c
so	c
happy	c
about	i
that	i
to	c
help	c
on	i
a	c
real	i
big	c
pop	c
concert	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
decribe	i
it	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
Kim	i
you	i
was	i
not	c
too	c
jealous	c
about	c
that	c
,	c
sorry	c
.	c

That	c
's	c
the	c
best	i
suitable	c
accomodation	i
for	c
a	c
camping	c
.	i

It	c
just	i
keeps	c
you	c
in	c
touch	c
with	c
nature	c
.	c

That	c
's	c
what	c
camping	c
is	c
about	c
,	c
is	c
n't	c
it	c
?	c

I	c
've	c
found	c
the	c
list	c
of	c
activities	c
you	c
sent	c
me	c
very	c
interesting	c
.	c

If	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
choose	c
two	c
of	c
them	c
I	c
'll	c
take	c
tennis	c
first	c
.	c

No	c
,	c
not	c
as	c
a	c
singer	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
the	c
one	c
who	c
put	c
it	c
there	c
in	c
Segovia	c
.	c

Well	c
,	c
some	c
others	c
helped	c
me	c
in	i
the	c
task	c
,	c
but	c
that	c
did	c
not	c
make	c
it	c
much	c
easier	c
.	c

Any	i
way	i
,	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
great	c
experience	c
and	c
I	c
enjoy	i
it	c
very	c
much	c
.	c

What	c
about	c
accommodation	c
,	i
I	c
prefer	c
tents	c
to	c
log	c
cabins	c
.	c

You	c
offer	c
a	c
great	c
veriety	i
of	c
activities	c
.	c

My	c
best	c
sports	c
disciplines	c
are	c
swimming	c
and	c
basketball	c
.	c

I	c
always	c
watch	c
the	c
NBA	c
matches	c
on	c
T.V.	c
It	c
will	c
be	c
great	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
train	i
basketball	c
in	c
USA	i
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
K	c
.	c

Shoping	i
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
had	c
wanted	c
something	c
special	c
for	c
example	c
for	c
a	c
gift	c
you	c
had	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
line	c
all	c
night	c
.	c

We	c
can	c
buy	c
everything	c
what	i
about	i
we	c
imagine	c
.	c

But	c
the	c
problem	c
is	c
when	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
buy	c
only	c
one	c
thing	c
,	c
for	c
example	c
bread	c
.	c

They	c
are	c
filled	c
by	i
people	c
who	c
went	i
buy	i
everything	c
.	c

Some	c
people	c
might	c
be	c
silly	c
enough	c
to	c
pay	c
for	c
such	c
a	c
bad	c
show	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c
Franz	c
Morell	c
Hand	c

The	c
only	c
and	c
simple	c
advantage	c
of	c
modern	c
technology	c
is	c
just	c
taking	c
the	c
work	c
from	c
us	c
so	c
we	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
to	c
do	c
anything	c
anymore	c
.	c

You	c
never	c
get	c
bored	c
.	c

Once	c
my	c
family	c
and	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
Greece	c
and	c
rent	i
a	c
sailing	c
boat	c
for	c
three	c
weeks	c
.	c

As	c
the	c
second	c
activity	c
I	c
have	c
chosen	c
to	c
make	i
photos	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
want	c
to	c
buy	c
new	c
clothes	c
for	c
summer	c
the	c
biggest	c
difficulty	c
is	c
to	c
find	c
a	c
shop	c
,	i
which	c
sells	c
what	c
you	c
are	c
looking	c
for	c
.	c

Often	c
it	c
happens	c
that	c
the	c
salesman	c
has	c
n't	c
got	c
the	c
size	c
you	c
need	c
and	c
that	c
's	c
always	c
a	c
pity	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
the	c
actor	c
was	c
not	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
as	c
you	c
wrote	c
.	c

Actually	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
was	c
right	c
to	c
tell	c
the	c
teachers	c
but	c
not	c
in	c
Pat	c
's	c
way	c
.	c

It	c
would	c
have	c
been	c
better	c
for	c
both	c
Pat	c
and	c
Jan	c
if	c
they	c
had	c
told	c
the	c
teachers	c
privately	c
and	c
secretly	c
because	c
Tim	c
would	i
have	i
n't	i
known	c
who	c
had	c
told	c
the	c
teachers	c
.	c

succed	i
at	i
a	i
good	i
level	i
.	c

Nowthere	i
,	i
I	c
would	c
like	c
know	i
if	c
it	c
's	c
possible	c
to	c
change	c
my	c
activities	c
during	c
my	c
sejar	i
.	c

Can	c
I	c
change	c
some	c
moneys	i
in	i
the	c
Camp	i
or	c
near	c
it	c
?	c

The	i
shopping	i
is	c
great	c
when	c
you	c
have	c
lots	c
of	c
moneys	i
,	i
times	i
;	c
you	c
can	c
buy	c
clothes	c
,	c
shoes	c
,	c
make-up	c
;	c
CD	i
,	c
whatever	c
.	c

But	c
,	i
it	c
's	c
not	c
easy	c
for	c
workers	c
,	c
because	c
the	c
shops	c
close	c
their	c
doors	c
about	c
5.30	c
pm	c
(	c
half	c
past	c
five	c
)	c
.	c

Introduction	c

The	c
aim	c
of	c
this	c
report	c
is	c
to	c
summarize	c
the	c
results	c
of	c
a	c
survey	c
about	c
lessons	c
and	c
other	c
activities	c
which	c
should	c
be	c
filmed	c
.	c

Amazingly	c
,	c
over	c
20	c
per	c
cent	c
of	c
the	c
students	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
take	c
up	c
handball	c
from	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
also	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
the	c
good	i
programme	c
you	c
made	i
for	c
us	c
,	c
especially	i
the	c
river	c
trip	c
to	c
Greenwich	c
might	c
be	c
fascinating	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
about	c
the	c
show	c
which	c
we	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
see	c
:	c
It	c
is	c
"	c
The	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
"	c
,	c
which	c
is	c
going	c
to	c
take	c
place	c
at	c
the	c
"	i
Central	c
Exibition	i
Hall	c
in	c
London	c
,	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
the	c
14th	c
March	c
,	c
between	c
10.00	c
and	c
19.00	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
will	c
consider	c
our	c
request	c

I	i
was	c
dangerous	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
knew	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
.	c

We	c
had	c
walked	c
for	c
three	c
hours	c
(	c
my	c
mother	c
,	c
my	c
two	c
brother	i
and	c
I	c
)	c
through	c
the	c
humid	c
and	c
noisy	c
jungle	c
,	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
reach	i
a	c
small	c
but	c
clean	c
house	c
where	c
a	c
nice	c
and	c
friendly	c
family	c
,	c
old	c
friends	c
of	c
us	i
,	c
used	c
to	c
live	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
easier	c
than	c
I	c
had	c
thought	c
!	c
.	i

That	c
day	c
,	c
I	c
learnt	c
that	c
I	c
can	c
do	i
even	i
things	c
which	c
,	c
at	c
first	c
sight	c
,	c
seem	c
impossible	c
to	c
be	i
done	i
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
informing	c
that	c
I	c
won	c
the	c
prize	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
pleased	c
to	c
hear	c
that	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
inform	i
you	c
the	c
information	c
you	c
asked	c
me	c
.	i

Owing	c
toe	i
the	c
summer	c
course	c
I	c
take	c
starting	c
in	c
August	c
,	c
July	c
is	c
the	c
only	c
month	c
I	c
have	c
free	c
time	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
also	c
very	c
pleased	c
to	c
hear	c
that	c
I	c
could	c
do	c
some	c
activities	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

That	i
's	i
would	c
be	c
so	c
exhausting	c
.	c

You	c
need	c
to	c
go	c
home	c
with	c
bulky	c
bags	c
in	c
both	c
of	c
your	c
hands	c
!	c
!	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
although	c
there	c
is	c
certainly	c
a	c
good	c
side	c
of	i
shopping	c
,	c
such	c
as	c
pleasures	i
of	c
getting	c
new	c
stuff	c
and	c
spending	c
money	c
on	c
something	c
you	c
really	c
wanted	c
for	c
long	i
time	c
,	c
you	c
also	c
have	c
some	c
unpleasant	c
moments	c
to	c
get	c
through	c
.	c

The	c
only	c
time	c
I	c
can	c
travel	c
to	c
U.S.A	i
is	c
in	c
July	c
,	c
because	c
that	c
is	c
the	c
only	c
time	c
I	c
can	c
leave	c
my	c
work	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
Science	c
are	i
one	c
of	c
the	c
interesting	c
subject	i
in	c
school	c
.	c

We	c
can	c
see	c
students	c
expressing	c
their	c
feeling	i
,	c
wonderful	c
and	c
excitting	i
story	c
that	c
the	c
student	c
made	c
up	c
or	c
from	c
a	c
will	i
know	i
story	c
.	c

Another	c
excitting	i
subject	c
which	c
most	c
of	c
the	c
students	c
likes	i
very	c
much	c
is	c
P.E.	c
Many	c
students	c
like	c
to	c
play	c
sports	c
.	c

There	c
are	c
lot	i
of	c
interest	i
activities	c
doing	c
on	i
such	c
as	c
,	i
painting	c
,	c
swimming	c
,	c
football	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
went	c
in	c
for	c
your	c
competition	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
really	c
anxious	c
about	c
the	c
results	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
arrive	c
at	c
the	c
Camp	c
in	c
July	c
if	c
that	c
is	c
possible	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
working	c
and	c
I	c
will	c
not	c
have	c
spare	c
time	c
before	c
this	i
month	i
.	c

There	c
was	c
a	c
large	c
stage	c
which	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
clean	i
by	i
sweeping	i
.	c

Another	c
thing	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
was	c
help	c
the	c
staff	c
to	c
tranfer	i
some	c
equipment	c
.	c

I	c
've	c
learned	c
the	c
meaning	c
of	c
the	c
words	c
"	c
reliability	c
"	c
and	c
"	c
responsibility	c
"	c
.	c

The	c
theater	i
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
for	c
no	c
reason	c
availble	i
to	c
me	c
.	c

We	c
are	c
in	c
the	c
same	c
maths	c
set	c
so	c
I	c
met	c
him	c
rather	c
soon	c
.	c

I	c
saw	c
her	c
as	c
a	c
perfect	c
girl	c
with	c
who	i
I	c
fallen	i
in	c
love	c
with	i
.	c

So	c
one	c
day	c
she	c
offered	i
to	i
me	c
to	c
come	c
to	c
her	c
house	c
at	c
night	c
and	c
to	c
do	c
so	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
run	c
away	c
from	c
our	c
boarding	c
house	c
and	c
that	c
was	c
illigal	i
.	c

So	c
I	c
woke	c
up	c
at	c
2	c
o'clock	c
in	c
the	c
morning	c
and	c
climed	i
out	c
of	c
the	c
window	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
asked	c
him	c
to	c
keep	c
it	c
in	i
secret	c
.	c

Next	c
day	c
my	c
best	c
friend	c
went	c
to	c
headmaster	i
and	c
told	c
him	c
about	c
me	c
so	c
he	c
gave	i
me	c
a	i
sespend	i
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
we	c
had	i
better	i
go	i
to	c
show	i
instead	c
of	c
science	i
museum	c
and	c
shopping	i
,	i
also	i
we	c
can	c
go	c
to	c
Science	i
Museum	c
on	c
15th	c
March	c
,	c
which	i
instead	c
of	c
the	i
free	c
time	c
in	c
the	c
afternoon	c
.	c

I	c
felt	c
there	c
might	c
be	c
something	c
has	i
gone	c
wrong	c
.	c

'	c
Why	c
not	c
go	c
to	c
sock	i
exchange	c
?	c
'	c

However	c
,	c
the	c
students	c
in	c
our	c
class	c
have	c
seen	c
an	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
at	c
the	c
Central	c
Exhibition	c
Hall	c
of	c
London	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
from	c
10	c
am	c
to	c
7	c
p.m.	c
All	c
of	c
us	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

The	c
most	c
important	c
thing	c
that	i
the	i
famous	c
people	c
are	c
also	c
normal	c
people	c
as	i
us	c
.	c

17	c
June	c
,	c
2000	c

Secondly	c
,	c
although	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
,	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
closed	c
at	c
the	c
usual	c
time	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
not	c
able	c
to	c
eat	c
dinner	c
.	c

What	c
is	c
worse	c
,	c
the	c
ticket	c
price	c
was	c
not	c
reduced	c
despite	c
the	c
fact	c
that	c
I	c
showed	c
my	c
student	c
ID	c
.	c

Visiting	c
your	c
theatre	c
should	c
have	c
been	c
the	c
most	c
pleasant	c
time	i
during	c
my	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
known	c
that	c
but	c
I	c
told	i
my	i
secret	i
to	i
her	i
,	c
which	c
was	c
a	c
big	c
mistake	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
I	i
must	c
say	c
that	c
"	c
over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
"	c
is	c
not	c
the	i
London	i
newest	c
and	c
best	c
musical	c
show	c
,	c
for	c
many	c
reasons	c
:	c

In	c
your	c
advertisement	c
I	c
read	c
the	c
times	c
,	i
it	i
was	i
14.30	c
and	c
10.30	c
,	c
however	c
it	i
started	c
20.15	i
!	c

It	c
was	c
incredible	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
that	c
the	c
next	c
time	c
you	c
will	c
do	i
a	c
better	c
show	c
than	c
the	c
last	c
one	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
there	c
are	c
disadvatatges	i
,	c
too	c
.	c

And	c
finally	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
spend	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
money	c
buying	c
games	c
for	c
the	c
computer	c
,	c
that	i
it	i
's	i
a	i
very	i
good	i
technology	i
,	c
too	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c
Madam	c
,	c

Last	c
Sunday	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
disappointed	c
it	i
.	c

Because	c
there	c
were	c
other	c
actors	c
which	i
played	c
too	i
badly	c
.	c

I	c
hoped	c
to	c
see	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
as	c
was	c
presented	i
in	c
an	c
advertisement	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
the	i
very	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
so	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
for	c
return	i
my	c
money	c
.	i

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

I	c
asked	c
her	c
for	c
hepl	i
and	c
she	c
promised	c
me	c
do	i
everythings	i
what	i
she	c
can	i
and	c
keep	c
my	c
secret	c
.	c

I	c
got	c
the	i
big	i
dipress	i
but	c
my	c
parents	c
supported	c
me	c
.	c

We	c
had	c
a	c
big	i
conversation	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
tell	c
to	i
everyone	c
,	i
do	c
n't	c
be	c
naive	c
when	c
you	c
share	c
with	i
sameone	i
your	i
big	i
secret	i
or	i
promlem	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
sure	c
it	c
is	c
the	c
best	c
way	c
.	c

Do	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
bring	c
money	c
for	c
anything	c
extra	c
?	c
but	i
also	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
learn	i
about	c
clothes	c
.	c

Yours	c
Sincerely	i

SHOPPING	c

Who	c
does	c
n't	c
like	c
shopping	c
?	c

We	c
can	c
look	c
up	i
a	c
magazine	c
or	c
a	c
booklet	i
which	c
deliver	i
with	c
newspaper	i
weekly	c

You	c
can	c

I	c
have	c
always	c
wanted	c
to	c
spend	c
my	c
holidays	c
in	c

but	c
my	c
father	c
has	c
never	c
given	c
me	c
the	i
permission	c

and	c
this	c
would	c
be	c
an	c
ideal	c

for	c

to	c

about	c

I	c
am	c
a	c
good	c
swimmer	c
and	c
also	c
well	i
at	c

I	c

I	c
look	c

to	c

I	c
belive	i
that	c
if	c
someone	c
has	c
time	c
to	c
go	c

has	i
the	i
possibility	i

Indeed	c
I	c
would	c

information	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
:	c

I	c
am	c
tennis	i
first	i
team	c
in	c
my	c
school	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
can	c
show	i
my	c
highly	i
tennis	c
skill	i
during	c
the	c
holidays	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
can	c
play	c
Basketball	i
as	c
well	c
,	c
but	c
not	c
very	c
good	i
,	i
you	i
can	i
say	c
I	c
only	c
know	c
how	c
to	c
play	c
.	c

take	i
care	c

From	c

If	c
you	c
go	c
out	c
with	c
your	c
same	i
sex	i
friend	c
that	c
should	c
be	c
fine	c
,	i
same	i
fashion	i
,	i
but	c
everytime	i
go	i
to	c
the	c
same	c
place	c
,	c
everyone	c
will	c
feel	c
boring	i
.	c

Then	c
,	c
the	c
time	c
marked	i
to	i
the	c
beginning	c
was	i
19:30	c
and	c
unfortunatly	i
he	i
began	c
at	c
20:15	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

He	c
has	c
a	c
bestfriend	i
,	c
that	i
was	c
more	c
like	c
a	c
brother	c
for	i
him	c
.	c

This	c
secret	c
was	c
an	c
opportunity	c
for	c
Pat	c
be	i
the	c
best	c
without	c
competition	i
but	c
it	c
is	i
a	c
secret	c
who	i
involved	c
his	c
best	c
friend	i
sexuality	c
,	c
and	c
if	c
Ted	c
was	i
a	c
normal	c
person	c
it	c
will	i
be	i
fine	c
but	c
he	c
was	c
the	i
example	c
for	c
all	c
school	i
.	c

Unable	c
to	c
keep	c
a	c
secret	c
he	c
told	c
for	i
everyone	c
,	c
ended	c
his	c
friendship	c
with	c
Ted	c
,	i
now	i
Ted	c
is	c
rejective	i
for	i
everyone	c
,	c
no	c
one	c
talks	c
to	c
him	c
and	c
Pat	c
is	c
the	c
example	c
,	c
but	c
without	c
his	c
best	c
friend	c
and	c
his	c
honestity	i
.	c

I	c
prefer	i
be	i
nothing	c
than	c
bun	i
like	c
Pat	c

Dear	c
MRS	c
HELEN	c
RYAN	c
.	i

In	c
accodance	i
with	c
what	c
you	c
have	c
told	c
me	c
about	c
the	c
accommodation	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
go	c
and	c
stay	c
in	c
tents	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
think	c
their	i
unusual	c
and	c
is	i
not	c
something	c
that	c
you	c
do	c
everyday	i
.	c

The	c
kind	c
of	c
activities	c
that	c
I	c
like	c
from	c
the	c
list	c
that	c
you	c
gave	c
me	c
are	c
Basketball	c
and	c
Swimming	c
.	c

Is	c
the	c
food	c
paid	c
for	c
?	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Andersen	c

Well	c
,	c
in	i
my	i
point	i
of	i
view	i
the	c
most	c
interesting	c
lessons	c
that	c
we	c
do	i
at	c
school	c
but	i
in	i
real	i
life	i
are	i
useful	i
,	i
are	c
maths	c
because	c
everything	c
we	c
do	c
is	c
all	c
about	c
maths	c
.	c

There	c
are	i
some	c
problems	c
,	i
we	c
have	c
to	c
speak	c
about	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
50	c
%	c
(	c
£	c
80	c
)	c
are	i
enough	c
.	c

faithfully	c

With	c
the	c
help	c
of	c
my	c
home	c
computer	c
I	c
can	c
do	c
all	c
thing	i
,	c
about	i
money	c
,	c
with	c
my	c
bank	c
.	c

An	i
other	i
point	i
is	c
the	c
modern	c
technology	c
in	c
my	c
car	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Ryan	c
,	c

Here	c
are	i
some	c
further	c
information	c
you	c
need	c
from	c
me	c
:	c

It	c
is	c
more	i
secure	i
and	c
there	c
is	c
no	c
problem	c
if	c
it	c
rains	c
.	c

As	c
for	c
the	c
two	c
activities	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
enjoy	c
climbing	c
and	c
playing	c
tennis	c
.	c

It	c
should	c
not	c
be	c
a	c
problem	c
.	c

They	c
are	c
all	c
excited	c
when	c
thinking	c
about	c
the	c
party	c
they	c
have	c
been	c
invited	c
to	c
.	c

The	c
second	c
kind	c
of	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
when	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
buy	c
what	c
is	c
necessary	c
for	c
you	c
:	c
bread	c
,	c
butter	c
,	c
milk	c
etc	c
...	c

I	c
'm	c
sorry	c
to	c
say	c
it	i
but	i
your	c
musical	c
show	c
was	c
very	c
disappointing	c
to	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
disappointed	c
.	c

About	c
the	c
discount	c
that	c
we	c
are	i
going	c
to	c
have	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
also	c
wondering	c
why	c
you	c
told	c
us	c
to	c
visit	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
.	i

as	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

She	c
is	c
a	c
very	c
good	c
girl	c
and	c
she	c
can	c
deal	c
with	c
every	c
promblem	i
she	c
has	c
.	c

But	c
now	c
we	c
are	c
friends	c
again	c
but	c
I	c
will	c
never	c
say	i
to	i
her	c
a	c
secret	c
in	i
my	c
whole	c
life	c
.	c

I	c
love	c
to	c
play	c
basketball	c
.	c

At	c
the	c
Camp	c
,	c
is	c
there	c
a	c
free	c
uniform	c
or	c
we	i
will	i
have	c
to	c
wear	c
something	c
spessial	i
?	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

We	c
have	c
very	c
interesting	c
English	c
lessons	c
.	c

They	c
are	c
always	c
funny	c
and	c
nice	c
.	c

Many	c
people	c
do	c
n't	c
like	c
Math	i
because	c
they	c
think	c
that	c
it	c
's	c
boreing	i
subject	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
we	c
should	c
film	c
the	c
Math	i
.	i

I	c
write	c
you	c
this	c
letter	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
your	c
musical	c
show	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
a	c
really	c
bad	c
evening	c
and	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
for	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
modern	c
technology	c
has	c
changed	c
my	c
life	c
a	c
lot	c
.	c

I	c
use	c
my	c
computer	c
for	c
many	c
things	c
,	c
such	c
as	c
homeworks	i
,	c
games	c
,	c
digital	c
video	c
or	c
Internet	i
.	c

It	c
is	c
now	c
possible	c
to	c
talk	c
to	c
a	c
friend	c
almost	c
everywhere	c
and	c
everywhen	i
,	c
even	c
if	c
we	c
are	c
two	c
thousand	c
kilometers	i
away	c
from	c
each	c
other	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Helen	i
Ryan	c
,	c

We	c
are	c
all	c
costemers	i
of	c
the	c
big	c
supermarkets	c
They	i
have	c
all	c
what	i
we	c
need	c
it	i
.	c

At	i
it	i
shows	c
shopping	i
is	i
become	c
our	i
dislikes	c
,	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
huge	c
supermarkets	c
.	c

To	c
whom	c
it	c
may	c
concern	c
,	c

I	c
would	c
appreciate	c
it	c
if	c
you	c
also	c

me	c
on	c
how	c

Dear	c
manager	c
,	c

When	c
I	c
asked	c
for	c
the	c
price	c
I	c
was	c
surprised	c
becaused	i
the	c
seller	i
told	c
there	i
was	c
n't	c
any	c
discount	c
available	c
.	c

I	c
showed	c
the	c
advertisement	c
to	c
him	c
and	c
he	c
said	c
it	c
was	c
wrong	c
and	c
I	c
paid	c
the	c
normal	c
price	c
.	c

I	c
bought	c
the	c
ticket	c
for	c
the	c
second	c
session	i
and	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
at	c
seven	c
o'clock	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
been	c
waiting	c
half	c
an	c
hour	c
outside	c
the	c
theatre	c
and	i
finally	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
a	c
quarter	c
past	c
eight	c
.	c

Modern	c
technology	c
has	c
changed	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
and	c
I	c
'll	c
try	c
to	c
explain	c
it	i
.	c

The	c
subject	c
was	c
"	c
What	c
's	c
happening	c
in	c
Irak	c
?	c
"	c

Do	c
you	c
want	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
different	c
lunch	c
?	c

You	c
can	c
find	c
there	i
all	i
you	i
need	i
and	c
more	c
!	c

According	c
to	c
the	c
advertisement	c
,	c
discounts	c
were	c
available	c
,	c
but	c
in	c
reality	c
it	i
was	c
n't	c
so	c
!	c

In	i
connection	i
with	i
this	i
I	c
think	c
you	c
should	c
give	c
me	c
some	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

I	c
loved	c
and	c
respected	c
him	c
very	c
much	c
,	c
but	c
there	c
was	c
an	c
unpleasant	c
thing	c
about	c
him	c
-	c
he	c
talked	c
too	c
much	c
.	c

We	c
knew	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
great	c
present	c
and	c
she	c
would	c
be	c
extremely	c
happy	c
.	c

We	c
bought	c
a	c
beautiful	c
puppy	c
and	c
were	c
waiting	c
for	c
the	c
holiday	i
probably	c
even	c
more	c
impatiently	c
,	i
than	c
Susie	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
"	c
OVER	c
THE	c
RAINBOW	c
"	c
which	i
I	c
saw	c
in	c
your	c
theatre	c
the	i
5th	c
of	c
June	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
,	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
,	c
where	c
we	c
had	c
planned	c
to	c
eat	c
,	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
the	c
cook	c
was	c
ill	c
.	c

The	c
poor	c
boy	c
was	c
only	c
5	c
year	i
old	c
and	c
at	c
this	c
age	c
,	i
it	c
's	c
very	c
difficult	c
to	c
keep	c
your	c
mouth	c
shut	c
knowing	c
an	c
important	c
secret	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
to	c
a	i
cabin	c
Because	i
it	c
is	c
something	c
I	c
feel	c
mores	i
familia	i
I	i
used	c
to	c
go	c
camping	c
with	c
my	c
family	c
every	c
summer	c
.	c

Your	i
faithfully	c

My	c
sister	c
loves	c
shopping	c
,	i
she	i
could	c
stay	c
trying	i
clothes	i
on	i
all	i
day	i
in	i
a	i
shop	i
.	c

Because	c
is	i
something	c
it	i
goes	c
with	c
their	c
culture	c
.	c

Billy	c
Esposito	c

There	c
is	c
somebody	c
who	c
says	c
that	c
'	c
Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
'	i
and	c
who	c
is	c
happy	c
only	c
when	c
can	i
go	c
shopping	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
shopping	c
is	c
relaxing	c
above	i
all	c
on	c
Saturdays	c
when	c
you	c
have	c
finished	c
a	c
work	i
week	c
and	c
you	c
are	c
expecting	c
a	c
wonderful	c
Sunday	c
.	c

It	c
would	c
also	c
be	c
useful	c
to	c
know	c
that	i
how	c
much	c
money	c
will	i
be	i
enough	i
to	c
bring	c
.	c

There	c
are	c
some	c
discussion	c
groups	c
,	c
so	c
students	c
may	c
have	c
discussion	i
on	c
any	c
subject	c

Break	c
Time	c
:	c
We	c
have	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
facilities	c
for	c
break	c
time	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
we	c
should	c
choose	c
break	c
time	c
activities	c
.	c

It	c
would	c
be	c
much	c
better	c
for	c
video	c
film	i
.	c

I	c
have	c
no	c
particular	c
needs	c
but	c
one	c
:	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
necessary	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
my	c
work	c
will	c
keep	c
me	c
very	c
busy	c
in	c
all	c
other	i
months	c
.	c

About	c
the	c
accomodation	i
,	c
I	c
have	c
no	c
problems	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
staying	c
in	c
tent	i
,	c
so	c
that	c
the	c
holiday	c
may	c
be	c
more	c
adventurous	c
.	c

People	c
often	c
have	c
very	c
different	c
opinions	c
about	c
shopping	c
.	c

Even	c
if	c
you	c
are	c
with	c
a	c
friend	c
,	c
you	c
ca	c
n't	c
talk	c
,	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
noise	c
and	c
the	c
confusion	c
,	c
and	c
you	c
may	c
find	c
it	c
difficult	c
also	c
to	c
walk	c
close	c
to	c
each	c
other	c

Dear	c
Sir	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
in	c
the	c
play	c
appeared	i
a	c
different	c
actor	c
despite	i
that	i
in	i
the	i
advertisement	i
appeared	i
the	i
name	i
of	i
Danny	i
Brook	i
,	i
that	c
actor	c
was	c
very	c
bad	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
we	c
enjoyed	c
the	c
musical	c
,	c
but	c
while	c
going	c
out	i
to	c
have	c
dinner	c
,	c
we	c
saw	c
the	c
restaurant	c
closed	i
and	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
take	i
the	c
car	c
and	c
come	c
back	c
home	c
very	c
hungry	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
oppinion	i
,	c
in	c
a	c
hundred	c
of	i
years	c
,	i
we	c
'll	c
wear	c
the	c
same	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
that	c
we	c
wear	c
nowadays	c
.	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c

Dear	c
Kim	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
nervous	c
because	c
I	c
'd	c
never	c
been	c
in	i
a	c
concert	c
before	c
and	c
an	c
hour	c
before	c
everything	c
stated	i
the	c
singer	c
and	c
the	c
musicians	c
were	c
there	c
and	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
avoid	i
it	c
and	c
I	c
started	c
crying	c
-	c
you	c
can	c
imagine	c
,	c
they	c
were	c
so	c
handsome	c
that	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
belive	i
it	c
-	c
I	c
tried	c
to	c
calm	c
down	c
because	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
work	c
,	c
and	c
later	c
I	c
began	c
feeling	i
more	c
comfortable	c
and	c
when	c
the	c
concert	c
started	c
everything	c
was	c
such	i
exciting	c
that	c
the	c
time	c
ran	i
very	c
fast	c
-	c
although	c
I	c
was	c
working	c
-	c
and	c
it	c
was	c

Fathermore	i
I	i
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
which	c
kind	c
clothes	i
I	c
need	c
to	c
take	c
and	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
'll	c
spend	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Recently	c
we	c
have	i
a	c
class	c
discussion	c
about	c
shopping	c
.	c

Women	c
always	c
enjoy	c
shopping	c
.	c

So	c
they	c
said	c
they	c
do	c
not	c
always	c
enjoy	c
shopping	c
.	c

As	c
I	c
am	c
young	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
be	c
a	c
romantic	c
person	c
and	c
to	c
be	c
closer	c
to	c
the	i
nature	c
.	c

Ansering	i
to	i
your	c
question	c
about	c
activities	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
going	c
to	c
choose	c
tennis	c
and	c
swimming	c
.	c

Could	c
I	c
ask	c
you	c
some	c
questions	c
about	c
clothes	c
and	c
money	c
.	i

As	c
a	c
women	i
,	c
as	c
a	c
mother	c
and	c
,	c
finally	c
,	c
as	c
an	c
ordinary	c
person	c
,	c
I	c
am	i
doing	i
shopping	c
quite	c
often	c
.	c

Shopping	c
is	c
part	c
of	c
my	c
life	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
an	c
opportunity	c
to	c
meet	c
different	c
people	c
(	c
even	c
if	c
they	c
are	c
pushing	c
you	c
)	c
,	c
to	c
understand	c
what	c
they	c
like	c
and	c
what	c
they	c
do	c
n't	c
,	c
because	c
even	c
some	c
kind	i
of	c
food	c
could	i
be	c
in	c
fashing	i
.	c

When	c
I	c
am	c
with	c
my	c
children	c
I	c
can	c
lean	i
them	c
reading	i
,	c
counting	i
,	i
if	i
they	i
only	i
do	c
n't	c
run	c
away	c
from	c
me	c
to	c
educate	c
themself	i
in	c
the	c
huge	c
world	c
,	c
which	i
name	i
is	c
"	c
shopping	c
"	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writting	i
this	c
letter	c
to	c
inform	c
you	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
very	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
during	i
your	c
musical	c
show	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
"	c
at	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
where	c
you	c
are	c
the	c
director	c
.	c

He	c
is	c
my	c
favourite	c
actor	c
and	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
reason	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
your	c
theatre	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
your	c
famous	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

Both	i
things	i
do	i
not	i
agree	i
with	c
what	c
I	c
read	c
on	i
your	c
advertising	i
sign	i

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Dear	c
Competition	c
Organiser	c
:	c

I	c
've	c
been	c
dreaming	c
to	i
travel	i
to	c
U.S.A	i
for	c
so	c
many	c
years	c
.	c

I	c
prefer	c
living	i
in	c
tents	c
to	c
living	i
in	c
log	c
cabins	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
most	c
popular	c
sports	c
in	c
U.S.A	i
as	c
well	c
in	c
my	c
opinion	c
.	c

I	c
just	c
think	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
exciting	c
and	c
interesting	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

And	c
the	c
last	c
one	c
is	c
that	i
do	i
I	c
need	c
pillow	c
or	c
blanket	c
or	c
something	c
else	c
?	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c

You	c
can	c
see	c
so	c
many	c
people	c
walk	c
along	c
the	c
business	c
street	c
every	c
day	c
and	c
any	c
time	c
,	c
especially	c
in	c
Oxford	c
Street	c
.	c

Of	c
course	c
not	c
.	c

It	c
makes	c
you	c
angry	c
!	c

I	c
was	c
a	c
little	c
more	c
portient	i
so	c
I	c
stayed	c
to	c
watch	c
the	c
hole	i
show	c
,	c
which	c
by	c
the	c
way	c
was	c
the	c
worst	c
I	c
had	i
ever	c
seen	c

There	c
are	c
hundrets	i
of	c
prograns	i
which	c
help	c
you	c
communicate	c
with	c
your	c
cousin	c
in	c
Australia	c
or	c
with	c
a	c
complete	c
stranger	c
which	i
you	c
wanna	i
meet	c

Millions	c
of	c
people	c
use	c
computers	c
for	c
this	c
reason	c

I	c
know	c
you	c
will	c
understand	c
my	c
frustration	c
and	c
that	c
's	c
why	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
a	c
total	c
refund	c
of	c
my	c
money	c
or	c
at	c
least	c
another	c
ticket	c
that	c
goes	i
with	i
my	i
wishes	i

He	c
just	c
said	c
there	c
were	c
n't	c
resources	c
to	c
face	i
it	c
at	c
that	c
moment	c
but	c
...	c

I	c
still	c
remember	c
her	c
words	c
:	c
"	c
Do	c
n't	c
worry	c
about	c
anything	c
.	c

My	c
lips	c
are	c
sealed	c
"	c
.	c

She	c
tried	c
to	c
apologise	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
enough	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

Thanks	i
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
your	c
recent	c
letter	c
.	c

I	c
can	i
not	i
believe	c
that	c
I	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
(	c
It	i
's	i
great	c
!	c
)	c
and	c
of	i
course	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
happy	c
.	c

And	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
returned	i
to	c
my	c
university	c
by	c
August	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
please	c
could	c
you	c
give	c
me	c
an	c
idea	c
what	c
sort	c
of	c
clothes	c
to	c
bring	c
?	c
and	i
how	c
much	c
would	i
be	i
spend	i
there	c
.	i

It	c
was	c
a	c
big	c
one	c
that	i
I	i
never	i
thougth	i
and	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
imagine	i
how	c
amazing	c
was	i
it	i
.	c

I	c
did	c
n't	c
know	c
what	c
is	i
my	c
responsible	i
until	c
they	c
called	c
me	c
to	c
trained	i
.	c

What	c
a	c
surprised	i
!	c
and	i
unbelieveable	i
,	c
I	c
was	c
responsible	c
for	c
looking	c
after	c
the	c
pop	c
stars	c
.	c

You	c
might	c
understand	c
how	c
excited	c
I	c
was	c
.	c

Dear	c
Helen	c

I	c
am	c
really	c
happy	c
to	c
receive	c
letter	i
about	c
Camp	c
California	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
exciting	i
and	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
doing	i
camp	i
there	c
.	c

How	c
was	c
your	c
exam	c
?	c

I	c
believe	c
it	c
went	c
well	c
!	c

By	c
the	c
way	c
,	c
last	c
month	c
I	c
was	c
in	c
that	c
pop	c
concert	c
which	c
you	c
mentioned	c
in	c
your	c
last	c
letters	c
.	c

Before	c
it	c
was	c
packed	c
into	c
by	c
audience	i
,	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
clean	c
around	c
the	c
reception	c
,	c
but	c
totally	i
it	c
was	c
really	c
exciting	c
although	c
I	c
was	c
just	c
a	c
staff	i
in	c
the	c
small	c
reception	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
felt	c
great	c
excitement	c
(	c
especially	c
girls	c
!	c
)	c
from	c
people	c
queing	i
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
like	c
to	c
tidy	c
up	c
,	c
you	c
know	c
!	c
!	c

That	c
night	c
was	c
brilliant	c
and	c
class	c
!	c

I	c
keep	c
that	c
in	c
my	c
mind	c
,	c
ever	i
!	c

Anyway	c
,	c
hope	c
to	c
hear	c
from	c
you	c
shortly	c
.	c

The	c
show	c
was	i
started	i
at	c
20.15	c
but	c
actually	c
it	c
should	c
started	i
at	c
19.30	c
.	c

One	c
day	c
,	c
we	c
were	c
sitting	c
in	c
the	c
dinning-hall	c
like	i
usually	i
.	c

Suddenly	c
my	c
heart	c
was	c
thumbing	i
so	c
quickly	c
because	c
I	c
saw	c
him	c
?	i
-	c
A	i
boy	c
who	c
is	i
a	c
new	c
student	c
.	c

Now	c
,	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
talk	c
to	c
her	c
anymore	c
because	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
stand	c
a	c
person	c
who	c
I	c
trusted	c
betrayed	i
me	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
disappointed	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
the	c
actors	c
showed	c
up	c
on	c
stage	c
because	c
they	c
were	c
not	c
actors	i
who	c
you	c
advertised	c
.	c

Thirdly	c
,	c
you	c
state	c
that	c
there	c
are	c
discounts	c
available	c
but	c
I	c
could	c
not	c
get	c
any	c
reductions	c
at	c
all	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

I	c
would	c
rather	c
travel	c
on	i
July	c
because	c
I	c
'm	c
not	c
as	c
busy	c
as	c
on	i
June	c
or	c
August	c
and	c
because	c
in	c
my	c
opinion	c
during	c
July	c
there	c
's	c
excellent	c
weather	c
.	c

Nuria	c

Valverde	c
.	c

Have	c
you	c
ever	c
asked	c
yourself	c
which	c
lessons	c
or	c
activities	c
should	c
be	c
filmed	c
in	c
the	c
school	c
video	c
?	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
I	c
think	c
basketball	c
should	c
be	c
filmed	c
too	c
because	c
is	i
one	c
of	c
the	c
activities	c
the	c
students	c
are	c
very	c
keen	c
on	c
doing	c
and	c
they	c
usually	c
enjoy	c
it	c
.	c

Concerning	c
the	c
dates	c
of	c
the	c
stay	c
,	c
I	c
will	c
only	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
come	c
during	c
the	c
first	c
two	c
weeks	c
of	c
July	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
starting	c
a	c
new	c
job	c
on	c
July	c
15th	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
also	c
chosen	c
photography	c
in	i
your	c
list	c
:	i
that	i
part	c
of	c
California	c
must	c
be	c
beautiful	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
love	c
bringing	i
some	i
"	c
well-taken	c
"	c
photos	c
of	c
the	c
area	c
.	c

He	c
will	c
have	c
breakfast	c
,	c
take	c
a	c
shower	c
,	c
get	c
dressed	c
,	c
etc	c
...	c

Actually	c
one	c
of	c
us	c
will	c
hold	c
the	c
camera	c
while	c
another	c
will	c
stand	c
next	c
to	c
him	c
,	c
as	c
the	c
"	c
voice	c
"	c
of	c
X	c
.	c

Student	c
X	c
will	c
answer	c
questions	c
,	c
speak	c
with	c
his	c
classmates	c
,	c
even	c
cheat	c
at	c
an	c
exam	c
!	c

The	c
main	c
purpose	c
is	c
to	c
show	c
the	c
"	c
real	c
"	c
life	c
of	c
an	c
unreal	c
student	c
.	c

Therefore	c
we	c
want	c
this	c
film	c
to	c
be	c
informative	c
and	c
funny	c
as	c
well	c
.	c

Before	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
,	c
a	c
man	c
said	c
that	c
there	i
was	i
n't	i
Danny	i
Brook	i
because	c
he	c
was	c
ill	c
.	c

After	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
which	c
was	c
n't	c
as	c
good	c
as	c
we	c
expected	c
,	c
we	c
decided	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
n't	c
a	c
"	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
"	c
like	c
you	c
said	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
,	c
so	c
my	c
friends	c
and	c
I	c
,	i
would	c
be	c
gratefull	i
if	c
you	c
will	i
give	c
us	c
some	c
money	c
back	c
,	c
if	c
it	i
is	c
possible	c
.	c

I	c
suggest	c
you	c
to	i
listen	i
to	c
it	c
because	c
it	c
's	c
a	c
very	c
interesting	c
book	c
and	c
you	c
can	c
relax	c
while	c
someone	c
else	c
is	c
reading	c
for	i
you	c
.	c

Write	i
me	i
back	i
soon	c
and	c
tell	c
me	c
about	c
your	c
impression	c
(	i
I	c
mean	c
if	c
you	c
enjoyed	c
the	c
story	c
or	c
not	c
!	c
)	c

Love	c

P.S.	c
Remember	c
96.7	c
on	c
friday	i
at	c
15.30	c
p.m	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
free	c
for	c
students	c
.	c

After	c
consideration	c
,	c
we	c
would	c
like	c
you	c
to	c
reorganise	c
the	c
2nd	c
day	i
programme	c
.	c

Nowaday	i
,	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
celebrities	c
,	c
such	c
as	c
pop	c
,	c
film	c
and	c
sports	c
stars	c
,	c
suffer	c
from	c
being	i
intruded	i
on	i
the	i
privacy	i
of	i
their	i
lives	i
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
other	c
people	c
are	c
against	c
following	c
celebrities	c
and	c
photographing	c
them	c
every	c
moment	c
.	c

With	i
replay	i
on	i
your	c
letter	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
I	c
was	c
really	c
pleased	c
with	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
.	c

The	c
climbing	c
and	c
the	c
painting	c
are	c
preferred	c
by	c
me	c
the	c
most	c
.	c

At	i
the	i
end	i
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
with	c
me	c
and	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
will	c
need	c
for	c
the	c
normal	c
life	c
at	c
the	c
camp	c
.	c

The	c
aim	c
of	c
this	c
report	c
is	c
to	c
suggest	c
which	c
lessons	c
and	c
other	c
activities	c
should	c
be	c
place	i
at	i
video	i
film	c
about	c
daily	c
life	c
at	c
our	c
school	c
.	c

Their	c
lessons	c
are	c
valuable	c
,	c
rich	c
in	c
knowledge	c
and	c
funy	i
.	c

It	c
can	i
maks	i
the	c
video	c
more	c
interesting	c
.	c

If	c
we	c
take	i
under	i
an	i
attention	i
this	i
things	c
our	c
film	c
is	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
very	c
interesting	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
madam	c
,	c

And	c
if	c
this	c
were	c
not	c
enough	c
,	c
I	c
had	i
no	c
discount	c
in	i
the	c
ticket	c
as	i
was	c
written	i
.	c

Beside	i
this	c
,	c
we	c
where	i
invited	c
to	c
visit	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
being	c
redecorated	c
.	c

Sometimes	c
there	c
advantages	i
but	c
there	c
some	i
disadvantages	c
too	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
one	c
advantage	c
of	c
it	c
is	c
that	c
you	c
can	c
do	c
things	c
faster	c
.	c

Beside	c
this	c
you	c
can	c
talk	c
with	c
a	c
person	c
in	i
the	c
other	c
side	c
of	c
the	c
world	c
by	i
a	c
computer	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
it	c
helps	c
in	i
house	i
works	i
,	c
at	c
school	c
and	c
you	c
can	c
travel	c
to	c
places	c
very	c
quickly	c
.	c

It	c
can	c
cause	c
lots	c
of	c
problems	c
to	i
our	c
health	c
.	c

A	c
further	c
disadvantage	c
is	c
that	c
children	c
are	c
growing	c
up	c
very	c
lazy	c
.	c

They	c
have	i
everything	c
they	c
want	c
very	c
easily	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
not	c
good	c
for	c
their	c
future	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
,	c

Therefore	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
the	c
middle	c
of	c
July	c
.	c

I	c
have	i
been	i
belonging	i
to	c
a	c
swimming	c
club	c
and	c
I	c
got	c
second	c
prize	c
in	c
a	c
competition	c
last	c
summer	c
.	c

What	c
short	i
of	c
clothes	c
should	c
I	c
prepare	i
?	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Rie	c
Tanizaki	c

Most	c
people	c
like	c
shopping	c
.	c

There	c
are	c
some	c
advantages	c
when	c
people	c
go	c
shopping	c
.	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
many	c
disadvantages	c
as	c
well	c
as	c
advantages	c
.	c

If	c
people	c
want	c
to	c
enjoy	c
shopping	c
,	c
we	i
must	c
consider	c
before	c
buy	i
something	c
-	c
do	c
I	c
really	c
want	c
it	c
?	c

I	c
also	c
recommend	c
a	i
window	c
shopping	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
inform	c
you	c
that	c
I	c
am	c
able	c
to	c
go	c
there	c
only	c
in	c
July	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
finishing	c
my	c
study	i
in	c
June	c
,	c
then	c
I	c
have	c
a	c
month	c
off	c
(	c
July	c
)	c
and	c
on	c
August	c
1st	c
I	c
am	c
starting	c
a	c
new	c
job	c
.	c

I	c
like	c
going	c
between	c
colourful	c
shelfs	i
and	c
picking	c
some	c
nice	c
things	c
for	c
dinner	c
or	c
for	c
decorating	c
our	c
house	c
with	c
.	c

You	c
cannot	c
breath	i
,	c
you	c
cannot	c
see	c
anything	c
apart	c
from	c
a	c
bulk	c
of	c
shouting	c
women	c
and	c
men	c
who	c
want	c
to	c
get	c
something	c
cheaper	c
!	c

Next	c
,	c
not	i
very	c
enjoyable	c
thing	c
about	c
shopping	c
is	c
spending	c
money	c
!	c

Usually	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
starts	c
at	c
19:30	c
,	c
but	c
this	c
time	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
wait	c
until	c
20:15	c
!	c

In	c
addition	c
to	c
this	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
the	c
famous	c
actors	c
that	c
you	c
have	i
mentionned	i
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
,	i
so	c
we	c
were	c
disappointed	c
.	c

In	i
the	i
result	i
,	c
I	c
am	c
sure	c
you	c
will	c
understand	c
our	c
annoyed	i
and	c
frustrated	i
,	c
so	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
a	i
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
that	c
your	c
advertisement	c
stated	c
was	i
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
request	c
a	c
full-refund	i
for	c
my	c
friends	c
and	c
I	i
,	c
because	c
I	c
felt	c
your	c
advertisement	c
was	c
misleading	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
to	c
this	c
,	c
anyone	c
will	c
agree	c
with	c
me	c
that	c
clothes	c
are	c
the	c
best	c
invention	c
ever	c
.	c

Yesterday	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
to	c
see	c
a	c
musical	c
show	i
.	c

That	c
was	c
too	c
much	c
.	c

"	c
Dear	c
"	c
manager	c
I	c
hope	c
you	c
to	i
understand	i
me	c
,	c
so	i
I	c
ask	c
for	c
money	c
back	c
and	c
I	c
hope	c
this	c
wont	i
happen	c
again	c
.	c

By	i

Dear	c
Manager	c
,	c

And	c
then	c
about	c
the	c
tickets	c
,	c
you	c
wrotte	i
that	c
they	i
were	c
discounts	c
available	c
but	c
they	i
were	c
not	c
.	c

Finaly	i
when	c
we	c
had	c
seen	c
the	c
Musical	c
,	c
we	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
restaurant	c
and	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
they	c
done	i
some	c
dekoreting	i
,	c
and	c

We	c
are	c

disappointed	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
a	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
for	c

I	c
wish	c
we	c
had	c
never	c
chosen	c
your	c
show	c

So	c
she	c
ran	c
to	c
Jon	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
make	i
him	c
know	c
the	i
terrible	c
mistake	c
I	c
had	c
made	c
that	c
evening	c

I	c
hope	c
that	c
you	c
understand	c
me	c
.	c

Nowadays	c
,	c
you	c
have	i
all	i
things	i
immediatly	i
and	i
soon	i
,	c
but	c
will	c
it	c
be	i
good	i
?	i

Today	c
there	c
are	c
children	c
that	i
do	c
n't	c
know	c
nothing	i
about	c
nature	c
and	c
its	c
things	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
they	c
will	c
give	c
me	c
such	c
a	c
long	c
holiday	c
enough	i
to	c
travel	c
for	c

weeks	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

I	c
'm	c
fine	c
as	c
usual	c
.	c

Talking	c
of	c
my	c
work	c
,	c
I	c
had	i
to	i
mostly	i
make	i
the	c
concert	c
stage	c
with	c
some	c
fellows	i
.	c

However	c
,	c
there	c
was	c
a	c
particular	c
thing	c
I	c
really	c
liked	c
during	c
the	c
concert	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
satisfied	i
to	c
have	c
received	c
your	c
letter	c
that	c
informed	c
me	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
.	c

There	c
was	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
work	c
to	c
do	c
but	c
we	c
were	c
happy	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
with	c
glad	i
people	c
and	c
at	c
the	c
end	c
we	c
had	c
the	c
possibility	i
to	c
take	c
part	c
in	c
the	c
pop	c
concert	c
.	c

Yesterday	c
,	c
I	c
received	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
this	c
is	c
the	c
most	i
ideal	i
month	c
for	c
a	c
trip	c
to	c
California	c
.	c

I	c
selected	c
swimming	c
because	c
this	c
is	c
one	c
of	c
my	c
hobbies	c
and	c
I	c
'm	c
good	c
enough	c
t	i
this	c
sector	i
.	c

Yours	c
sincierly	i

I	c
also	c
helped	c
to	c
clear	c
up	c
the	c
place	c
after	c
the	c
concert	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
I	c
had	c
the	c
opportunity	c
to	c
talk	c
to	c
the	c
singers	c
and	c
have	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
autogrammes	i
by	c
them	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
the	i
log	c
cabins	c
are	c
more	c
comfortable	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
slept	c
in	c
a	c
tents	i
.	c

I	c
have	c
taken	c
a	c
Photography	c
course	c
and	c
I	c
enjoy	c
taking	c
photos	c
to	i
animals	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
to	c
search	c
in	i
the	c
internet	i
pictures	i
that	c
could	c
be	c
used	c
for	c
the	c
flier	c
.	c

Hello	c
Sir	c

Because	c
you	c
are	c
the	c
manager	c

you	c
are	c
the	c
only	c
person	c
who	c
can	c
change	c

Hedwiga	c

And	c
we	c
knew	c
that	c
from	c
the	i
day	c
on	c
,	i
that	c
he	i
knows	i
anything	c
about	c
our	c
secret	c
we	c
will	i
live	c
in	c
danger	c
being	i
caught	c
.	c

We	c
had	c
this	c
idea	c
first	c
,	i
when	c
we	c
watched	c
a	c
movie	c
about	c
the	c
Italian	c
mafia	c
in	c
an	c
English	c
lesson	c
in	c
school	c
.	c

He	c
saw	c
me	c
and	c
tolled	i
me	c
into	i
my	c
face	i
you	i
are	c
a	c
thief	c
and	c
a	c
burglar	c
and	c
I	c
will	c
go	i
now	i
to	c
the	c
police	c
,	i
I	c
did	c
n't	c
know	c
what	c
to	c
do	c
,but	c
then	c
I	c
had	c
an	c
idea	c
....	c

It	c
was	c
wonderful	i
surprise	c
when	c
I	c
received	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
receiving	c
your	c
reply	c

Thanks	c
for	c
your	c

I	c
could	c
give	c
the	c
members	c
"	c
Shiatsu	c
massage	c
"	c
just	c
before	c
the	c
concert	c
to	c
make	c
them	c
relax	c
!	c

Love	c
,	c

Additionally	c
,	c
I	c
'd	c
rather	c
stay	c
in	c
tents	c
as	c
I	c
've	c
never	c
slept	c
in	c
tents	c
before	c
.	c

Introduction	c

The	c
survey	c
was	c
done	i
to	i
300	c
students	c
,	c
who	c
are	c
between	c
18-28	c
,	c
at	c
our	c
school	c
.	c

Prefered	i
lessons	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
the	c
girls	i
'd	i
rather	c
play	c
table	c
tennis	c
or	c
badminton	c
.	c

Also	c
,	c
we	c
will	c
see	c
leisure	c
and	c
sports	c
wear	c
.	c

Maybe	c
it	c
'll	c
help	c
you	c
choose	c
.	c

My	c
best	c
friend	c
told	c
me	c
,	i
she	c
met	i
one	i
boy	c
.	c

Someone	c
told	c
me	c
if	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
see	c
my	c
friend	c
,	c
I	c
must	c
take	i
5000$	c
and	c
bring	i
them	i
up	i
to	i
the	c
street	c
.	c

I	c
showed	c
the	c
man	c
,	i
that	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
gun	c
and	c
money	c
.	c

Of	c
course	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
better	c
for	c
us	c
.	c

I	c
gave	c
him	c
the	c
bag	c
took	i
the	i
friends	i
hand	c
and	c
we	c
run	i
away	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
was	c
14	c
,	c
I	c
won	c
the	i
competition	c
.	c

Let	c
me	c
know	c
if	i
I	i
have	i
to	i
take	i
which	i
kind	i
of	i
clothes	i
and	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
need	c
.	c

Thanks	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

Can	c
you	c
imagine	c
?	c

Anyway	c
,	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
thing	c
was	c
that	c
I	c
had	c
good	i
experience	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
pity	i
,	c
is	c
n't	c
it	c
?	c

Next	c
time	c
,	c
I	c
hope	c
that	c
we	c
'll	c
work	c
together	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
fed	c
up	c
with	c
studying	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
at	i
the	c
Camp	c
in	c
July	c
,	c
if	c
is	i
possible	c
.	c

July	c
is	c
months	i
when	c
I	c
'm	c
having	c
a	c
rest	c
and	c
I	c
'm	c
doing	c
nothing	c
.	c

Is	i
good	c
for	c
make	i
friends	c
,	c
you	c
can	c
know	c
them	c
better	c
doing	c
everything	c
together	c
.	c

Another	c
sport	c
which	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
do	c
is	c
swimming	c
.	c

In	i
swimming	i
I	i
'm	i
not	i
as	i
good	i
as	c
in	i
basketball	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
practise	c
more	c
and	c
maybe	c
learn	c
something	c
new	c
about	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
want	c
take	i
too	c
much	c
;	c
jeans	c
,	c
jumper	c
,	c
swimming	c
costium	i
,	c
T-shirt	c
,	c
sports	c
shoes	c
I	c
think	c
should	c
b	i
O.K	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
fine	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
n't	c
belive	i
how	c
big	c
the	i
lamp	c
can	c
be	c

In	c
July	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
free	c
to	c
travel	c
anywhere	c
I	c
please	c
.	c

Looking	c
to	i
your	c
letter	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
see	c
many	c
options	c
of	i
activities	c
and	c
I	c
realized	i
that	c
I	c
like	c
most	c
of	c
them	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
Climbing	c
and	c
Painting	c
.	c

Is	c
all	i
the	i
travel	i
already	c
paid	c
including	i
food	c
and	c

that	c
the	c

so	c
I	c
went	c
in	c
at	c

also	c
used	i
for	i
some	c
material	i
e.g.	i
steel	c
or	c
iron	c
,	c
which	c
use	i
for	i
our	c
building	i
,	i
it	i
can	c
make	c
it	i
stronger	c
and	c
not	i
easy	i
to	c
destroy	c
.	c

Science	c
and	c
technology	c
can	c
give	c
us	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
good	c
thing	i
for	c
our	c
daily	c
life	c
,	c
make	i
us	i
easy	i
to	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

At	i
first	i
the	c
show	c
started	c
at	c
10.15	c
,	c
and	c
it	c
should	c
be	i
at	c
19.30	c
.	c

After	c
your	c
show	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
visit	c
my	c
friends	c
,	c
and	c
because	c
of	c
it	c
,	c
I	c
did	i
n't	i
do	c
it	i
.	c

So	c
,	c
I	c
hope	c
I	c
will	c
get	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
,	i
it	i
was	c
very	i
disappointing	c
evening	c
out	i
in	c
my	c
life	c

I	c
was	c
there	c
,	c
I	c
saw	c
it	c

I	c
hoped	i
that	c
it	c
,	i
just	i
could	i
see	i
3	i
people	c
,	c
but	c
it	i
was	c
mistake	i
...	c

But	c
it	c

I	c
have	c
read	c
the	c

and	c
I	c
must	c
say	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
idea	c

Dear	c
John	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
my	c
parents	c
let	c
me	c
do	c
what	c
I	c
want	c
,	i
because	c
they	c
trust	c
me	c

When	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
buy	c
tickets	c
,	c
they	c
did	c
n't	c
accept	i
the	i
discounts	c
.	c

Like	i
it	i
was	i
written	i
again	c
,	c
we	c
went	c
to	c
visit	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c

Dear	c
Ms	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
something	c
about	c
what	c
you	c
asked	c
me	c
in	c
the	c
letter	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
very	c
much	c
like	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
not	c
good	c
at	c
swimming	c
but	c
I	c
would	c
very	c
much	c
like	c
to	c
learn	c
how	c
to	c
swim	c
this	c
year	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
photography	c
as	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
photographer	c
in	c
a	c
club	c
while	c
I	c
was	c
in	c
the	i
college	c
.	c

Is	c
n't	c
it	c
cold	c
at	c
night	c
in	c
the	c
Camp	c
California	c
?	c

Could	c
you	c
please	c
tell	c
me	c
about	c
these	c
?	c

When	c
you	c
do	i
shopping	c
,	c
you	c
can	c
see	c
various	c
products	c
even	i
very	c
extraordinary	c
thing	i
.	c

You	c
can	c
also	c
see	c
more	c
graceful	c
and	c
fine	c
thing	i
.	c

Because	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
visit	c
many	c
shops	c
and	c
see	c
many	c
thing	i
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
as	c
many	c
people	c
think	c
.	c

It	c
depends	c
on	c
the	c
situation	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
found	c
that	c
there	c
were	c
no	c
discounts	c
as	c
it	i
was	i
announced	i
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
.	c

As	c
if	c
that	c
was	c
not	c
enough	c
he	i
thought	c
I	c
had	c
been	c
kidding	c
,	c
inviting	c
him	c
to	c
a	c
closed	c
restaurant	c
where	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
appear	i
.	c

Those	c
were	i
the	c
reasons	c
for	c
my	c
asking	c
a	i
refund	c
of	c
the	c
£	c
20	c
I	c
paid	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
2	c
weeks	c
off	c
in	i
the	c
beginning	c
of	c
the	c
month	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
wondering	c
if	c
some	i
special	c
clothes	c
are	c
required	c
and	c
how	c
much	c
pocket	c
money	c
I	c
need	c
for	c
this	c
trip	c
?	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
to	c
relate	i
my	c
experience	c
in	i
helping	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
last	c
month	c
.	c

The	c
second	c
day	i
objective	c
was	c
to	c
install	c
the	c
scene	i
,	i
with	i
lights	i
,	i
loudspeakers	i
and	i
all	i
stuff	i
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
the	c
concert	c
was	c
exactly	c
that	i
the	c
people	c
were	c
expected	i
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c

There	c
we	c
can	i
see	c
everything	c
about	i
the	c
latest	c
fashions	c
,	c
leisure	c
and	c
sports	c
wear	c
,	c
make	i
up	i
and	c
hairstyles	c
.	c

Instead	c
of	c
going	c
to	c
the	c
Science	c
Museum	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
morning	c
we	i
thought	c
we	c
could	c
postpone	c
it	c
to	c
Wednesday	c
afternoon	c
.	c

Let	c
's	c
have	c
a	c
surprise	c
?	i

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
only	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
I	c
will	c
have	c
a	c
summer	c
holiday	c
for	c
2	c
months	c
at	c
that	c
time	c
.	c

Swimming	c
is	c
quite	c
nice	i
activity	i
to	c
relax	c
and	c
work	c
out	c
.	c

Anyway	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
that	i
how	c
many	c
people	c
are	c
joining	i
at	i
this	c
Camp	c
.	c

How	c
are	c
you	c
doing	c
?	c

I	c
hope	c
that	c
you	c
can	c
get	c
on	c
well	c
with	c
your	c
roommate	c
.	c

And	c
I	c
particularly	c
liked	c
the	c
experience	c
that	i
I	i
helped	i
to	c
screen	i
and	c
paint	c
a	c
picture	c
of	c
"	c
Bon	c
Jovi	c
"	c
on	c
every	c
T-shirts	i
which	c
are	i
given	c
to	c
the	c
audiences	i
.	c

I	c
must	c
stop	c
writing	c
now	c
as	c
I	c
have	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
homework	c
to	c
do	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

The	c
tickets	c
also	c
caused	c
a	c
problem	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c
.	c

There	c
are	c
also	c
changes	c
in	c
biological	c
areas	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
mentioned	c
few	i
changes	c
above	c
but	c
there	c
's	c
still	c
a	i
biggist	i
one	c
left	c
which	i
is	c
about	i
computer	i
areas	i
.	c

It	c
helped	c
us	c
to	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
work	c
much	c
more	i
quicker	i
and	c
accurately	c
than	c
before	c
with	c
the	c
help	c
of	c
Internet	i
.	c

And	c
I	c
can	c
say	c
it	c
was	c
terrific	c
!	c

O.K.	c
,	c
I	c
actually	c
asked	c
him	c
only	c
:	c
'	c
How	c
are	c
you	c
?	c
'	c
and	c
he	c
gave	c
me	c
his	c
signature	i
.	c

Well	c
I	c
'll	c
have	c
to	c
close	c
now	c
.	c

Give	c
my	c
regards	c
to	c
your	c
parents	c
.	c

I	c
refer	c
to	c
your	c
advertisment	i
in	c
the	c
Herald	c
Tribune	c
where	c
you	c
advertised	c
for	i
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
and	c
the	c
recent	c
musical	c
:	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
.	c

To	i
make	i
the	i
matters	i
worse	i
Danny	c
Brook	c
who	i
was	c
announced	i
as	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
starring	c
person	i
in	c
the	c
musical	c
was	i
not	c
acting	c
this	c
evening	c
.	c

Heine	c
Bitz	c

In	c
the	c
next	c
100	c
years	c
there	c
will	c
be	c
no	c
change	c
in	c
that	c
but	c
the	i
fashion	c
is	c
going	c
to	c
develop	c
in	c
a	c
special	c
imaginative	c
way	c
.	c

There	c
are	c
the	c
natural	c
material	i
on	c
one	c
side	c
whereas	c
on	c
the	c
other	c
side	c
the	c
fashion	c
industry	c
produce	i
more	c
and	c
more	c
syntetical	i
clothes	i
,	c
which	c
relay	i
on	i
the	c
production	c
cost	c
.	c

Beyond	c
colours	i
will	c
play	c
an	c
important	c
role	c
in	c
the	c
next	c
century	c
for	c
the	i
fashion	c
.	c

I	c
spent	c
two	c
nice	c
days	c
at	c
the	c
festival	c
full	c
of	c
art	c
.	c

Beyond	i
all	c
these	i
,	c
the	c
application	i
of	c
joining	c
all	i
activities	i
by	i
one	c
nice-priced	i
ticket	c
was	c
excellent	c
;	i
because	c
it	c
saved	c
you	c
from	c
buying	i
one	c
ticket	c
for	c
each	c
activity	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
the	c
same	c
here	c
.	c

Our	c
school	c
is	c
really	c
very	c
diciplined	i
,	c
especially	c
about	c
our	c
clothes	c
and	c
behaviours	i
.	c

I	c
understand	c
the	c
second	c
part	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
get	i
the	c
reason	c
of	i
wearing	i
in	i
white	i
an	i
dark	i
blue	i
only	i
.	c

Then	c
again	c
,	c
we	c
have	c
to	c
obey	c
all	c
these	c
rules	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
allowed	c
to	c
do	c
whatever	c
I	c
want	c
at	i
my	c
room	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
I	c
show	c
these	c
three	c
to	c
them	c
.	c

Do	c
n't	c
ever	c
forget	c
to	c
write	c
to	c
me	c
,	c
okay	c
?	c

Love	c
,	c

I	c
have	c
just	c
received	c
your	c
letter	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
writing	c
in	i
response	i
of	i
your	c
questions	c
.	c

Accommodation	c
for	c
me	c
is	c
not	c
problem	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
easy	c
going	c
and	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
satisfied	c
wherever	c
.	i

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
do	c
the	c
following	c
activities	c
:	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
letter	i
it	i
was	c
great	c
to	c
hear	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Sorry	c
but	i
I	c
have	c
n't	c
written	c
you	i
because	c
I	c
've	c
been	c
very	c
busy	c
.	c

P.D.	c
I	c
send	i
you	c
an	c
autograph	c
that	c
Sting	c
wrote	c
for	c
you	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

The	c
musical	c
show	c
must	i
have	c
been	i
started	i
at	c
half	c
past	c
seven	c
but	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
quarter	c
past	c
eight	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
read	c
the	c
advertisement	c
,	c
it	c
said	c
that	c
the	c
restaurand	i
would	c
be	c
opened	i
.	c

I	c
called	c
Pat	c
to	c
come	c
to	c
my	c
house	c
because	c
I	c
was	c
not	c
very	c
good	i
and	c
to	i
tell	c
her	c
what	c
had	c
happened	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
sure	c
that	c
,	i
if	c
you	c
allow	c
us	c
to	c
go	c
,	c
we	c
are	c
going	c
to	c
enjoy	c
it	c
a	c
lot	c
,	c
to	i
learn	i
new	c
topics	i
about	c
the	i
English	c
culture	c
and	c
have	c
an	c
opportunity	c
to	c
communicate	i
ourselves	i
with	c
all	i
those	i
professional	i
of	i
the	i
fashion	i
.	c

It	c
is	c
a	c
very	c
good	c
chance	c
to	c
join	i
this	c
exhibition	c
to	c
see	c
all	c
the	c
new	c
fashion	i
tendences	i
,	c
the	c
latest	c
hairstyles	c
and	c
make	i
up	i
as	c
all	c
we	i
came	i
from	c
many	c
different	c
countries	c
and	c
have	i
not	i
the	c
same	c
customs	c
either	i
.	c

Well	c
,	c
that	c
is	c
all	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
.	c

We	c
do	c
hope	c
you	c
like	c
our	c
suggestion	c
and	c
we	c
can	c
have	i
an	i
agreement	i
to	c
join	i
the	c
fashion	c
exhibition	c
.	c

Some	c
people	c
think	c
that	c
they	c
should	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
must	c
admit	c
that	c
when	c
we	c
realised	c
the	c
main	c
character	i
had	c
been	c
changed	c
we	c
felt	c
really	c
disappointed	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
despite	c
of	i
your	c
advertisement	i
of	i
the	c
possibility	c
of	c
discounts	c
,	c
when	c
I	c
showed	c
my	c
student	c
identity	c
card	c
to	c
one	c
of	c
your	c
employes	i
she	c
angrily	c
told	c
me	c
that	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
pay	c
the	c
whole	i
prize	i
.	c

Yet	c
,	c
one	c
extremly	i
hot	c
day	c
while	c
I	c
was	c
pacefully	i
walking	c
by	c
the	c
sea	c
and	c
thinking	c
about	c
my	c
own	c
problems	c
I	i
discovered	c
my	c
elder	c
brother	c
's	c
girlfriend	c
with	c
another	c
boy	c
.	c

I	c
did	c
n't	c
know	c
who	c
explain	i
it	i
to	i
but	c
actually	i
I	c
decided	c
that	c
if	c
I	c
needed	c
to	c
tell	c
someone	c
a	c
secret	c
I	c
would	i
trust	c
an	i
my	c
best	c
friend	c
Pat	c
.	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
this	c
letter	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
all	c
the	c
necessary	c
details	c
.	c

Among	i
the	c
activities	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
choose	c
painting	c
-	c
which	c
I	c
am	c
keen	c
on	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
done	c
several	c
courses	c
-	c
,and	i
Photography	c
-	c
from	i
which	c
I	c
know	c
just	c
the	c
basical	i
skills	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Shopping	i
may	i
be	i
very	i
enjoyable	i
,	i
in	i
fact	i
,	c
as	c
people	c
get	i
in	i
contact	i
with	c
new	c
products	c
,	c
take	c
a	c
look	c
at	c
shops	c
,	c
buy	c
some	i
things	i
or	c
just	c
walk	c
around	c
.	c

But	c
it	c
can	c
also	c
be	c
dangerous	c
.	c

There	c
are	c
cases	c
of	c
people	c
that	c
can	i
not	i
spend	c
one	c
day	c
without	c
buying	c
anything	c
.	c

After	c
all	c
that	c
we	i
can	c
notice	i
that	c
shopping	c
can	c
be	c
a	c
good	c
option	i
as	c
long	c
as	c
we	c
can	c
choose	c
other	c
enjoyable	c
activities	c
for	c
our	c
free	c
time	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
advertisement	c
there	c
's	c
no	c
mention	c
about	i
getting	c
any	c
money	c
back	c
but	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
was	c
such	c
a	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
that	c
you	c
should	c
give	c
it	i
back	c
to	c
me	c
.	c

We	c
usually	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
beach	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
bath	i
and	c
to	c
enjoy	c
the	c
fantastic	c
whether	i
in	c
that	c
part	c
of	c
Spain	c
during	c
the	c
summer	c
.	c

One	c
day	c
we	c
found	c
out	i
a	c
beautiful	c
little	c
beach	c
next	c
to	c
the	c
big	c
one	c
where	c
some	c
people	c
were	c
taking	i
a	i
sunbath	i
and	c
some	c
children	c
were	c
playing	c
football	c
in	c
the	c
sand	c
.	c

Firstly	c
In	i
the	c
advertisement	c
you	c
said	c
that	c
the	c
actor	c
would	c
be	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
but	c
there	c
was	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
in	c
the	c
show	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
really	c
disappointed	c
,	i
because	c
I	c
was	c
really	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
seeing	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
which	i
I	c
personally	c
admire	c
.	c

Finally	c
there	c
were	c
no	c
discounts	c
available	c
in	i
the	c
tickets	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
your	c
reply	c

It	c
's	c
something	c
absoletuly	i
necessary	c
for	c
every	c
action	c
people	c
does	i
It	i
effects	i
us	c
both	c
positive	i
and	c
negative	i
.	c

My	c
relationship	c
with	c
my	c
family	c
and	c
friends	c
does	c
n't	c
even	c
exist	c
.	c

I	c
've	c
end	i
up	c
being	c
a	c
T.V	i
addict	c

Also	c
the	c
need	c
of	i
doing	i
simple	c
things	c
as	c
a	c
family	c
is	c
no	c
longer	c
the	i
case	i
.	c

Despite	c
the	c
negative	c
effects	c
,	c
technology	c
can	c
effect	i
with	i
a	i
positive	i
way	i
a	i
person	i
's	i
life	i
.	c

But	c
also	c
we	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
visit	c
The	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
show	i
that	c
will	c
be	c
held	c
at	c
the	c
Central	c
kExhibition	i
hall	i
on	c
Tuesday	c
March	c
14	c
from	c
10:00	c
-	c
19:00	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
time	c
,	i
and	i
We	c
're	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
your	i
opion	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
going	c
to	c
stay	c
here	c
a	i
week	c
.	c

Yous	i
sincerelly	i
,	c

Dear	c
sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

I	c
was	c
one	c
of	c
your	c
customers	c
who	c
had	c
a	c
very	c
disappointing	c
about	i
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
show	i
at	c
your	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
yesterday	c
.	c

Thesedays	i
we	c
are	c
living	c
on	i
a	c
high-technology	c
world	c
.	c

And	c
I	c
can	c
send	c
e-mail	c
to	c
my	c
friends	c
via	c
the	c
Internet	c
fastly	i
and	c
cheaply	c
prepared	i
to	c
the	c
old-style	c
mail-services	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
modern	c
technology	c
makes	i
me	c
do	c
my	c
business	c
faster	c
,	c
smarter	i
with	i
much	c
more	c
efficiency	c
.	c

I	c
shall	c
have	c
a	c
look	c
into	i
the	c
place	c
I	c
believe	c
no	c
one	c
can	c
avoid	c
-	c
the	c
kitchen	c
.	c

Personally	c
,	c
my	c
life	c
became	c
much	c
faster	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
much	c
more	c
time	c
for	c
many	c
other	c
things	c
during	c
the	c
day	c
thanks	c
to	c
devices	i
modern	c
technology	c
offers	c

Dear	c
Mr.	c
Robertson	c
,	c

This	c
show	c
will	c
be	i
taken	i
place	c
at	c
Central	i
Exhibition	c
Hall	c
in	c
London	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
14	c
of	c
March	c
at	i
10.00	c
-	c
19.00	c
,	c
which	i
include	i
the	c
latest	c
fashions	c
,	c
leisure	c
and	c
sports	c
wear	c
,	c
make	i
up	i
and	c
hairstyles	c
.	c

At	c
that	c
time	c
,	c
my	c
friends	c
and	c
I	c
was	i
so	c
daring	c
and	c
full	c
of	c
energy	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
otherwise	c
my	c
friend	i
would	c
call	c
me	c
a	c
chicken	c
and	c
they	c
dared	c
me	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
.	c

So	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
a	c
perfect	c
evening	c
for	c
me	c
and	c
I	i
think	i
about	i
it	i
,	c
if	c
I	c
can	c
have	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

Sencerely	i
.	c

She	c
did	c
n't	c
learn	i
a	c
lot	c
but	c
she	c
knew	c
all	c
important	i
things	c
.	c

Suddenly	c
she	c
jumped	c
out	c
of	c
her	c
armchair	c
and	c
shouted	c
:	c
"	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
the	c
jack-pot	i
"	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
to	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
inform	c
you	c
whed	i
the	c
idea	c
was	c
great	c
and	c
I	c

that	c

Dear	c
Jane	c
Clark	c
,	c

In	c
contrast	c
with	c
the	c
halls	c
,	c
the	c
concerts	c
were	c
great	c
and	c
I	c
saw	c
everybody	c
enjoyed	c
then	c
.	c

The	c
school	c
rules	c
are	c
horrible	c
here	c
.	c

The	c
school	c
is	c
like	c
a	c
dungeen	i
here	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
went	i
to	c
be	c
so	c
evel	i
about	c
school	c
but	c
the	i
rules	c
are	c
rules	c
and	c
they	c
are	c
limiting	c
us	c
with	i
the	c
borders	c
of	c
our	c
school	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
,	c
you	c
hear	c
the	c
same	c
word	c
every	c

Love	c
,	c

In	i
the	i
end	i
of	c
the	c
show	c
I	c
was	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
have	i
a	c
nice	c
dinner	c
in	c
the	c
restaurant	c
together	c
with	c
my	c
boyfriend	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
,	c
because	c
you	c
were	c
short	c
of	c
staff	c
.	c

This	c
was	c
not	c
my	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
get	c
as	c
much	c
exercise	c
as	c
I	c
used	c
to	c
get	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
think	c
that	c
I	c
had	i
been	i
going	c
to	c
Japan	c
if	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
because	i
of	i
internet	i
.	c

Also	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
which	c
activities	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
chose	i
and	c
why	c
.	c

Money	c
is	c
a	c
very	c
important	c
thing	c
in	i
shopping	c
,	i
if	i
you	c
have	c
money	c
,	c
is	i
not	c
a	c
problem	c
,	c
but	c
if	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
?	c

After	c
all	c
things	i
that	c
I	c
have	c
mentioned	c
it	c
is	c
clearly	i
seen	i
that	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

To	c
begin	c
with	c
,	c
never	c
have	c
I	c
been	c
so	c
upset	c
when	i
I	c
realized	c
that	c
the	i
expected	i
famous	i
actor	i
Danny	i
Brook	c
,	c
did	i
not	c
show	c
up	c
at	c
the	c
performance	c
and	c
that	c
he	c
had	c
been	c
shamefully	c
replaced	c
by	c
an	c
unknown	c
actor	c
whose	c
performance	c
was	c
,	i
quite	c
mediocre	c
.	c

Not	c
at	c
all	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
get	c
her	c
as	i
well	i
simmer	i
for	c
a	c
second	c
or	c
two	c
then	c
she	c
suddenly	c
sarted	i
shouting	c
uncontrollably	c
:	c
-	c
"	c
Never	c
have	c
I	c
met	c
such	c
a	c
poor	c
cow	c
like	c
Pat	c
"	c
,	c
hurled	i
Olga	i
at	i
me	c
,	i
through	i
the	c
phone	c
.	c

Then	c
I	c
woke	c
up	c
;	c
well	c
,	c
I	c
shall	c
never	c
know	c
what	c
happened	c
to	c
the	c
"	c
poor	c
cow	c
"	c
!	c

First	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
university	c
student	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
only	c
one	c
month	c
summer	i
vacation	c
that	i
is	c
in	c
July	c
.	c

Next	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
time	c
to	c
relax	c
when	c
I	c
travel	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
never	c
played	c
it	c
until	c
last	c
month	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
could	c
enjoy	c
it	c
,	c
even	c
though	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
biginner	i
,	c
so	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
practice	i
and	c
have	c
fun	c
at	c
the	c
camp	c
.	c

As	c
I	c
have	c
told	c
you	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
chance	c
to	c
help	c
at	c
a	c
concert	c
of	c
Majesty	c
,	c
a	c
local	c
band	c
in	c
which	c
one	c
of	c
my	c
friends	c
played	c
guiter	i
.	c

I	c
'm	c
happy	c
I	c
can	c
join	c
you	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
in	c
the	c
U.S.A	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
stay	i
in	c
log	c
cabins	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
a	c
problem	c
with	c
my	c
back	i
it	i
is	c
a	i
reason	c
that	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
lie	c
on	c
the	c
ground	c
.	c

You	c
wrote	c
to	c
me	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
a	c
chance	c
to	c
do	c
two	c
activities	c
,	c
which	c
I	c
can	c
choice	i
.	c

I	c
have	c
my	c
own	c
sports	c
equipment	c
to	c
play	c
tennis	c
.	c

They	c
were	c
pleased	c
that	c
I	c
can	c
do	c
two	c
of	c
this	i
job	i
that	i
's	c
why	c
I	c
got	c
the	c
work	i
.	c

Could	c
you	c
believe	c
that	c
two	c
nights	c
I	c
was	c
cutting	c
paper	i
's	i
flowers	c
,	c
grass	c
,	c
the	c
sun	c
and	c
thousands	c
of	c
birds	c
.	c

From	c
the	i
distance	c
they	c
looked	c
very	c
real	c
.	c

After	c
that	c
I	c
prepared	c
the	c
group	c
.	c

They	c
are	c
very	c
nice	c
people	i
even	i
Audrey	c
who	c
seems	c
very	c
stupid	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
to	c
see	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

I	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
organizing	c
it	c
,	c
and	c
hope	c
to	c
see	c
more	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

I	c
also	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
the	c
excellent	c
idea	c
of	c
one	i
ticket	c
for	c
all	c
events	c
,	c
which	c
allowed	c
me	c
to	c
see	c
all	c
the	c
things	c
I	c
was	c
interested	c
in	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
really	c
want	c
to	c
hear	c
about	c
school	c
rules	c
in	c
my	c
country	c
,	c
I	c
'll	c
try	c
to	c
write	c
about	c
them	c
in	i
a	i
nutshell	i
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
think	c
there	c
is	c
anything	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
change	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
very	c
competitive	c
player	c
,	c
as	c
well	c
or	i
a	c
technical	i

The	c
organisers	c
paid	c
for	c
my	c
acommodation	i
and	c
travel	i
to	c
Ireland	c
.	c

I	c
arrived	c
at	i
Ireland	c
on	c
2th	i
July	c
.	c

On	c
my	c
first	c
day	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
work	c
.	c

While	c
we	c
were	c
installing	c
the	c
sound	c
system	c
we	c
listened	c
irish	i
music	c
and	c
suddenly	c
we	c
saw	c
to	i
U2	c
,	c
which	c
is	c
my	c
favourite	c
group	c
,	c
going	c
inside	c
the	c
stadium	c
and	c
they	c
played	c
music	c
for	c
us	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
speak	c
to	c
my	c
favourite	c
singer	c
'	c
Bono	c
'	c
,	i
I	c
could	c
meet	c
him	c
and	c
I	c
helped	c
him	c
to	c
repair	c
his	c
guitar	c
because	c
it	c
did	c
n't	c
sound	c
very	c
well	i
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

The	c
problems	c
started	c
in	i
the	c
box	c
office	c
,	c
where	c
we	c
asked	c
for	c
the	c
discounts	c
you	c
announced	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
,	c
and	c
the	c
man	c
who	c
was	c
selling	c
the	c
tickets	c
said	c
that	c
they	c
did	c
n't	c
exist	c
.	c

You	c
promised	c
a	c
perfect	c
evening	c
but	c
it	c
became	c
a	c
big	c
disastrous	i
!	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

Last	c
Wednesday	c
Carole	c
received	c
a	c

It	c
was	c
long	c
time	c

when	c
she	c
was	c
fourteen	c

"	c
It	c
sounds	c
nice	c
but	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
believe	c
it	c
"	i
she	c
replied	c

I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
play	c
gold	i
and	c
tennis	c
,	i
I	c
practis	i
both	c
since	c
I	c
was	c
young	c

and	c
I	c
like	c
them	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
enough	c
time	c
to	c
play	c

and	c
my	c
level	c
is	c
n't	c
as	c
good	c
as	c
I	i
'll	i

When	c

Every	c

and	c
tired	i
but	c
I	c
enjoyed	c
a	i

Also	c

I	c
felt	c

that	c

every	c

As	c

I	c
would	c

Is	c

however	c

to	i
make	i
a	c
short	c
video	c
about	c

First	c
of	c
all	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
only	c
in	c
the	c
month	c

Many	c
people	c
"	c
see	c
"	c
at	i
shopping	c
like	i
an	c
amusement	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
think	c
it	i
's	i
not	i
always	i
a	i
good	i
translation	i
to	i
give	i
it	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
for	i
explaining	i
some	c
problems	c
your	c
theatre	c
has	c
got	c
and	c
asking	i
for	c
some	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

The	c
play	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
start	c
at	c
19.30	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
delayed	c
so	i
at	c
20.15	c
a	i
curtain	c
of	c
the	c
stage	c
was	c
pulled	i
up	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
a	c
big	c
fan	c
of	c
Danny	c
Book	c
and	c
it	i
was	c
why	c
I	c
chose	c
'	c
over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
'	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
booked	c
the	c
ticket	c
I	c
really	c
expected	i
the	c
show	c
.	c

The	c
more	c
cars	c
there	c
are	c
on	c
the	c
street	c
,	c
the	c
more	c
difficult	c
it	c
is	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
keep	c
myself	c
fit	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
am	c
loosing	c
chances	c
to	c
meet	c
my	c
friend	c
face	c
to	c
face	c
and	c
I	c
feel	c
I	c
am	c
getting	c
weaker	c
.	c

What	i
about	i
another	i
camp	c
conditions	c
-	c
it	c
does	c
not	c
matter	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
can	c
stay	c
in	c
tents	c
or	c
log	c
cabins	c
,	c
how	i
you	c
wish	c
.	c

Is	i
not	i
it	c
a	c
brilliant	c
idea	c
?	c

Not	c
only	c
-	c
to	c
LIVE	c
,	c
but	c
to	c
have	c
something	c
to	c
LIVE	c
FOR	c
.	c

With	c
Love	c

About	c
the	c
accommodation	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
log	i
cabins	i
instand	i
of	c
tents	i
,	c
because	c
is	i
safer	c
and	c
more	c
confortable	i
.	c

If	c
you	c
are	c
used	c
to	c
go	i
to	i
the	i
Shopping	c
very	c
often	c
,	c
maybe	c
is	i
because	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
about	c
all	c
the	c
others	i
good	c
things	c
you	c
can	c
do	c
on	c
your	c
weekend	c

So	c
,	c
why	c
do	c
n't	c
we	c
try	c
to	c
change	c
our	c
customs	i
and	c
start	c
to	c
do	c
knew	i
things	c

First	c
the	c
actors	c
who	c
were	c
suppoused	i
to	c
star	c
in	c
this	c
show	c
were	c
not	c
the	c
ones	c
put	c
in	i
there	i
.	c

I	c
had	c
a	c
discount	c
for	i
it	i
,	c
but	c
they	c
refussed	i
it	c
and	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
pay	c
the	c
full	c
price	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
this	i
reasons	c
are	c
suficiently	i
enough	i
to	c
ask	c
for	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
a	c
student	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
do	c
not	c
have	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
money	c
and	c
I	c
need	c
it	c
back	c

Everybody	c
knew	c
that	c
Caroline	c
and	c
her	c
boyfriend	c
John	c
,	i
loved	c
each	c
other	c
so	c
much	c
that	c
it	c
would	c
n't	c
be	c
rare	i
to	c
find	c
that	c
they	c
had	c
have	i
sex	c

The	c
point	c

that	c

we	i
would	c

ask	c
you	c
if	c
is	i
possible	c
to	c

in	i
the	c

All	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

Regarding	c
to	i
the	c
accomodation	i
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
tents	c
because	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
closer	c
to	c
the	i
nature	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
sure	c
I	c
will	c
have	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
fun	c
and	c
release	c
myself	c
from	c
the	i
busy	i
study	i
totally	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
won	c
several	c
prizes	c
in	c
the	c
competitions	c
which	c
were	c
held	c
by	c
my	c
college	c
.	c

Since	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
been	c
to	c
U.S.A	i
,	c
I	c
know	c
nothing	c
about	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
will	c
be	c
grateful	c
for	c
your	c
help	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
more	c
and	c
more	c
people	c
are	c
now	c
asking	c
,	c
"	c
Is	c
shopping	c
always	c
so	c
enjoyable	c
?	c
"	c

Would	c
you	c
be	c
patient	c
enough	c
to	c
wait	c
for	c
half	c
an	c
hour	c
or	c
more	c
just	c
because	c
you	c
wanna	i
buy	i
a	c
T-shirt	c
?	c

One	c
of	c
my	c
friend	i
,	c
Emma	c
,	c
happened	c
to	c
see	c
a	c
fantastic	c
jacket	c
which	c
costs	c
£	c
105	c
.	c

After	c
a	c
week	c
,	c
she	c
had	c
got	c
enough	c
money	c
and	c
rushed	c
to	c
that	c
shop	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
would	c
you	c
still	c
say	c
that	c
shopping	c
is	c
enjoyable	c
?	c

Manchester	c
,	c
UK	c

Please	c
send	c
me	c
a	c
list	c
of	c
the	c
items	c
I	c
many	i
need	c
there	c
,	c
including	c
the	c
most	c
appropriate	c
clothes	c
for	c
the	c
american	i
weather	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
who	c
has	c
the	c
freedom	c
to	c
buy	c
with	i
an	i
unlimited	i
budget	i
whatever	i
they	i
need	i
?	c

And	c
whenever	c
money	c
is	c
involved	c
,	c
some	c
problems	c
are	c
likely	c
to	c
happen	i
.	c

At	i
the	i
end	i
all	i
depends	c
in	i
our	c
attitud	i
to	c
life	c
,	c
including	c
shopping	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c

Dear	c
Mrs.	c
Ryan	c
:	c

Having	c
won	c
the	c
trip	c
to	c
California	c
delights	c
me	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
providing	c
you	c
the	i
further	c
informations	i
you	c
asked	c
for	c
:	c

I	c
only	c
have	c
two	c
months	c
of	c
vacation	c
that	i
are	i
July	c
and	c
August	c
and	c
since	c
I	c
must	c
visit	c
my	c
grandparents	c
in	c
August	c
,	c
the	c
only	c
time	c
possible	c
is	c
July	c
.	c

The	c
two	c
activities	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
do	c
are	c
basketball	c
and	c
surfing	c
.	c

Best	c
Regards	c

So	c
there	c
are	c
several	c
plausible	c
reasons	c
why	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
enquire	c
about	c
the	c
competition	c
that	c
I	c
won	c
and	c
give	c
some	c
details	c
to	c
you	c
about	c
myself	c
and	c
my	c
interests	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
ages	c
since	c
I	c
've	c
heard	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Last	c
month	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
great	c
time	c
at	c
the	c
concert	c
of	c
"	c
Dragon	c
"	c
which	i
is	c
the	c
most	c
popular	c
hard-rock	i
group	c
all	i
over	i
the	c
world	c
.	c

They	c
gave	c
me	c
two	c
free	c
tickets	c
.	c

Would	c
you	c
like	c
to	c
come	c
with	c
me	c
?	c

Looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

Two	c
months	c
ago	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
see	c
your	c
musical	c
show	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
most	c
disappointing	c
evening	i
of	c
my	c
life	c
.	c

Nobody	c
took	i
a	c
discount	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
advertisemen	i
you	c
wrote	c
"	c
your	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
"	c
,	c
that	c
's	c
very	c
funny	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
Just	i
a	c
disappointing	c
night	c
and	c
I	c
want	c
you	c
to	c
return	c
to	c
me	c
some	c
of	c
my	c
money	c
,	i

First	c
of	c
all	c
the	i
computer	c
.	c

I	c
can	c
find	c
many	c
things	c
from	i
the	c
internet	i
or	c
to	i
write	i
my	c
compositions	c
on	c
it	c
.	c

The	c
car	c
has	c
changed	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
,	c
like	c
everyone	c
else	i
.	c

I	c
can	c
go	c
from	c
one	c
place	c
to	i
other	i
very	c
fast	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
was	c
really	c
happy	c
when	c
your	c
letter	c
arrived	c
and	c
I	c
node	i
that	c
I	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
never	c
been	c
in	i
the	c
U.S.A	c
.	c

For	i
me	i
it	i
is	i
only	i
possible	i
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
.	c

That	c
is	c
the	c
only	c
month	c
where	i
I	c
have	c
time	c
because	c
after	c
July	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
start	c
with	i
the	i
University	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
sleep	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
used	c
to	c
it	c
.	c

You	c
wrote	c
that	c
I	c
should	c
choose	c
two	c
activities	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	i

I	c
think	c
it	c
depents	i
if	c
you	c
are	c
a	c
man	c
or	c
a	c
woman	c
and	c
now	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
say	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
woman	c
and	c
I	c
enjoy	c
it	c
.	c

Honestly	c
I	c
had	i
never	i
a	c
shopping	c
tour	i
which	i
I	i
did	i
n't	i
enjoy	i
when	i
I	i
was	i
alone	i
.	c

I	c
can	c
remember	c
one	c
shopping	c
tour	i
which	c
I	c
had	i
with	i
a	c
man	c
and	c
it	c
was	c
nightmare	i
.	c

Now	c
he	c
is	c
my	c
ex.boyfriend	i
!	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
my	c
advise	i
is	c
that	c
the	i
women	c
should	c
go	c
alone	c
or	c
with	c
a	c
female	c
friend	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
from	c
the	c
7	c
July	c
2000	c
to	c
the	c
21	c
July	c
2000	c
.	c

For	i
the	c
accommodation	c
at	c
camp	c
,	c
I	c
prefer	c
in	i
the	c
log	c
cabins	c
,	c
because	c
few	i
years	c
go	c
,	c
I	c
went	c
camping	c
with	c
some	c
friends	c
and	c
every	c
night	c
it	c
rained	c
and	c
in	c
the	c
tent	c
,	i
it	c
was	c
impossible	c
to	c
sleep	c
because	c
the	c
ground	c
was	c
so	c
wet	i
so	i
for	c
this	c
fact	i
,	c
I	c
choose	c
the	c
log	c
cabins	c
.	c

My	c
second	c
choice	c
,	i
it	i
is	c
Basketball	i
.	c

For	c
these	c
two	c
weeks	c
,	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	i
must	i
take	c
?	c

You	c
know	c
last	c
month	c
I	c
helped	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
as	c
like	i
security	c
.	c

After	c
that	c
,	c
at	c
2:00	c
pm	c
,	c
when	c
people	c
arrived	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
at	c
the	c
entrance	c
to	c
take	c
the	c
tickets	c
and	c
you	i
know	c
it	i
was	c
incredibale	i
because	c
some	c
people	c
slept	c
all	c
the	i
night	c
in	c
front	c
of	c
the	c
stadium	c
to	c
be	c
in	c
the	c
front	c
row	c
.	c

Write	c
me	i
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
appreciated	c
the	c
fact	c
that	c
there	c
were	c
concerts	c
of	i
different	c
kind	i
of	c
music	c
,	c
but	c
in	c
this	c
case	c
the	c
main	c
problem	c
was	c
that	c
some	c
concerts	i
hall	i
were	c
too	c
small	c
,	c
and	c
because	c
of	c
it	i
I	c
could	c
n't	c
see	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
concerts	c
in	i
programme	i
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
best	c
things	c
of	i
the	c
last	c
Festival	c
was	c
that	c
there	c
were	c
not	c
only	c
concerts	c
.	i

The	c
thing	c
that	c
I	c
liked	c
much	c
more	c
than	c
others	i
,	i
was	c
that	c
I	c
had	i
to	i
buy	i
only	i
one	c
ticket	c
for	c
all	c
events	i
,	c
and	c
it	c
was	c
no	i
pricey	c
.	c

I	c
like	c
read	i
very	c
much	c
,	c
because	c
every	c
book	c
that	c
I	c
read	c
shows	c
me	c
a	c
different	c
world	c
.	c

One	c
of	c
my	c
favourite	c
books	c
is	c
without	c
doubts	i
,	i
Wuthering	c
Heights	c
a	i
famous	c
book	c
written	c
by	c
Emily	c
Brontë	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
this	c
letter	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
how	c
I	i
felt	i
disappointed	i
with	c
it	c
.	c

As	i
I	i
am	i
writing	i
,	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
a	c
perfect	c
evening	c
at	c
all	c
but	c
horrible	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
for	c
money	i
back	c
and	c
compensate	i
for	c
my	c
special	c
20th	c
birthday	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
waiting	c
for	i
your	c
reply	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
,	i
there	c
will	c
be	c
some	c
diffences	i
in	c
quality	i
and	c
materials	c
of	c
clothes	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
speaking	c
of	c
sports	c
,	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
remarkable	c
progress	c
has	c
been	c
made	c
in	i
especially	i
swimming	c
costumes	c
and	c
athletes	c
'	c
costumes	i
for	c
Olympic	i
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
100	c
years	c
from	c
now	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
,	i
better	i
quality	c
in	i
clothes	c
will	c
be	c
created	i
in	c
every	c
field	i
,	i
such	i
as	i
sports	i
,	i
office	i
,	i
leisure	i
,	i
building	i
site	i
,	i
school	i
and	i
space	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
further	c
information	c
about	c
the	c
two	c
weeks	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
.	c

Last	c
year	c
,	c
I	c
took	c
part	c
in	c
a	c
competition	c
and	c
I	c
did	c
it	i
well	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

Alice	c
is	c
my	c
best	c
friend	c
and	c
we	c
met	c
twenty	c
years	c
ago	c
.	c

We	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
same	c
school	c
and	c
we	c
had	c
the	c
same	c
hobbies	c
.	c

Yesterday	c
she	c
phoned	c
to	i
Alice	c
and	c
explained	c
all	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
writting	i
this	c
letter	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
treatment	c
that	c
we	c
have	i
received	i
when	c
we	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
Circle	c
theatre	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
"	c
whose	i
actors	c
were	c
Anthony	c
Keens	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
.	c

When	c
we	c
arrived	c
at	c
the	c
Circle	c
theatre	c
in	c
the	c
evening	c
,	c
we	c
were	i
waiting	i
during	i
a	c
long	c
time	c
,	c
because	c
that	i
you	i
advertisement	c
noticed	i
that	c
the	c
musical	i
show	c
would	c
begin	c
at	c
19:30	c
,	c
and	c
eventually	c
it	c
began	c
at	c
20:15	c
.	c

This	c
evening	c
was	c
the	c
worst	c
evening	c
of	c
all	i
my	c
life	c
.	c

She	c
told	c
our	c
parents	c
that	c
we	c
were	c
going	c
to	c
get	c
married	c
in	c
Brazil	c
.	c

Because	c
of	c
this	c
,	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
sell	c
the	c
house	c
and	c
left	c
our	c
jobs	c
.	c

Nowadays	i
,	c
Sally	c
and	c
I	c
are	c
married	c
,	c
have	c
three	c
children	c
,	c
a	c
marvellous	c
house	c
and	c
both	c
of	c
us	c
are	c
working	c
in	i
a	c
big	c
company	c
.	c

I	c
address	c
this	c
letter	c
to	c
you	c
because	c
as	c
the	c
manager	c
of	c
"	c
The	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
"	c
I	c
hold	c
you	c
responsible	c
for	c
the	c
most	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
in	c
a	c
theatre	c
I	c
had	i
in	c
years	c
.	c

I	c
went	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
evening	c
performance	c
of	c
your	c
production	c
of	c

Dear	c
manager	c
,	c

After	c
all	c
this	c
,	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
know	c
if	c
I	c
will	c
have	i
some	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
rare	c
the	i
schools	c
that	i
do	c
n't	c
have	c
a	c
multimedia	c
centre	c
with	c
many	c
computers	c
to	i
the	c
students	c
use	i
.	c

We	c
are	i
really	c
appriciate	i
about	i
giving	i
very	i
nice	c
program	i
,	c
which	c
is	i
organised	c
by	c
your	i
this	c
time	c
.	c

Could	c
you	c
consider	c
this	c
for	c
us	c
?	c

your	c
students	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
future	c
we	c
can	c
expect	c
having	i
new	i
material	c
and	c
it	c
will	c
make	c
our	c
living	i
more	c
confortable	i
and	c
convinient	i
.	c

Although	c
high	i
might	c
be	i
still	i
same	i
.	c

Also	c
to	i
know	c
about	c
the	c
all	c
accommodation	c
and	c
travel	c
costs	c
that	c
is	i
including	i
in	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
.	c

Last	c
month	c
I	c
enjoyed	c
a	i
lot	i
to	i
help	i
at	i
a	i
pop	i
concert	i
,	i
really	i
it	c
was	c
a	c
very	c
intresting	i
experience	c
,	c
particularly	c
to	i
had	c
deal	i
with	c
a	c
young	c
group	c
of	c
children	c
from	c
Latin	c
America	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
one	c
day	c
you	c
and	c
me	i
can	c
travel	c
to	c
South	c
America	c
because	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
introduce	c
you	c
my	i
new	c
friends	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
only	c
at	c
20:15	c
,	c
although	c
,	i
it	c
had	i
to	c
start	c
at	c
19:30	c
.	c

It	c
seems	c
to	c
me	c
that	c
all	c
these	c
failures	c
were	c
your	c
falt	i
,	c
because	c
you	c
were	c
responsible	c
for	c
the	c
arrangement	i
of	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
you	c
ought	c
to	c
have	c
postponed	c
the	c
show	c
and	c
have	i
reimbursed	c
me	c
a	i
ticket	c
price	c
.	c

My	c
friend	c
lives	c
in	c
Kresnodar	c
.	c

My	c
grandmother	c
lives	c
in	c
Orel	c
,	c
which	c
is	c
much	c
closer	c
to	c
Kursk	c
than	c
Kresnodar	c
.	c

And	c
it	c
takes	c
3	c
days	c
to	i
her	c
letter	c
to	c
get	c
to	c
Kursk	c
.	c

Dear	c
Ms.	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
:	c

This	c
is	c
the	c
first	c
time	c
I	c
won	c
a	c
prize	c
in	c
these	i
kind	c
of	c
competitions	i
so	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
clear	i
some	i
doubts	i
.	c

The	c
other	c
activity	c
would	c
be	c
surf	i
.	c

Looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerly	i
,	c

You	c
have	c
to	c
be	c
all	i
the	i
time	i
walking	i
,	c
so	c
your	c
legs	c
will	c
feel	c
pain	i
,	i
hurted	i
at	c
the	c
final	i
of	i
the	i
day	i
,	i
you	i
will	c
be	c
very	c
tired	c
and	c
you	c
would	i
want	c
to	c
hang	i
around	i
for	c
two	c
months	c
.	c

If	c
I	c
go	c
alone	c
is	i
very	c
fast	c
and	c
I	c
enjoy	c
it	c
but	c
if	c
I	c
go	i
with	c
my	c
mother	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
horrible	c
,	c
I	c
will	i
have	c
to	c
do	i
a	c
sacrifice	c
.	c

She	c
will	i
see	c
if	c
it	c
is	c
pretty	c
or	c
not	c
,	c
if	c
it	c
is	c
in	i
discount	i
at	c
other	i
store	c
we	i
will	i
not	c
buy	c
the	c
dress	c
and	c
we	c
will	i
have	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
other	c
store	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
other	c
dress	c
,	c
but	c
at	i
the	i
final	i
of	i
seeing	c
all	c
the	c
stores	c
and	c
looking	c
all	i
the	c
dresses	c
she	c
will	i
decided	i
for	i
the	c
first	c
we	i
saw	c
.	c

As	c
for	c
my	c
activities	c
,	c
as	c
I	c
took	c
up	c
playing	c
golf	c
since	i
I	c
was	c
a	c
child	c
and	c
now	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
single-handicapped	c
player	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
have	c
chance	i
to	c
play	c
golf	c
at	c
camp	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
singing	c
as	c
well	c
as	c
playing	c
the	c
piano	c
.	c

What	c
's	c
the	c
weather	c
like	c
in	c
California	c
?	c

How	c
much	c
money	c
should	c
I	c
bring	c
with	c
me	c
for	c
two	i
week	i
stay	c
?	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

You	c
ca	c
n't	c
imagine	c
how	c
happy	c
I	c
am	c
to	c
have	c
had	c
such	c
a	c
wonderful	c
chance	i
.	c

It	c
was	c
really	c
great	c
to	c
have	c
talked	c
with	c
famous	c
pop	c
singers	c
,	c
bands	c
,	c
and	c
TV	c
stars	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
definitely	c
over	c
the	c
moon	c
!	c

I	c
'm	c
writting	i
you	i
because	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
what	c
a	c
bad	c
experience	c
I	c
had	c
during	c
my	c
holidays	c
when	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
play	c
on	c
your	i
theatre	c
.	c

Waiting	c
for	c
your	i
to	c
write	c
back	c

Yours	c

In	c
my	c
own	c
personal	c
experience	c
,	c
technology	c
is	c
something	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
live	c
without	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
whenever	c
I	c
go	c
out	c
by	c
myself	c
,	c
my	c
father	c
gives	c
me	c
a	c
cell	c
phone	c
,	c
to	c
call	c
him	c
in	c
case	c
I	c
need	c
anything	c
.	c

You	c
say	i
it	c
would	c
be	c
Danny	c
brook	c
the	i
man	i
who	c
was	i
going	i
to	i
sing	i
but	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
.	c

Looking	c
for	i
forward	c
hearing	i
from	c
you	c
.	c

And	c
that	c
's	c
the	c
history	i
of	c
how	c
I	c
lose	i
the	c
oportunity	i
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
only	c
concert	c
that	c
Oasis	c
had	i
done	i
in	c
my	c
city	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
we	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
suggest	c
you	i
something	c
:	c

Let	c
me	c
explain	c
you	i
what	c
it	c
is	c
:	c
It	c
must	i
be	i
an	c
exhibition	c
which	c
takes	c
place	c
in	c
the	c
"	c
Central	c
Exhibition	c
Hall	c
"	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
and	c
deals	c
with	c
the	c
latest	c
fashions	c
,	c
the	c
different	c
leisures	i
,	c
make	i
up	i
and	c
so	c
on	c
...	c

It	c
would	c
be	c
all	i
the	i
more	i
interesting	c
for	c
us	c
as	c
fashion	c
is	c
a	i
great	c
interest	c
for	c
people	c
from	i
our	c
age	c
.	c

Please	c
,	c
Let	c
us	c
know	c
.	c

That	i
's	i
as	c
simple	c
as	c
this	i
!	c

Everyone	c
is	c
aware	c
of	c
the	c
celebrity	c
's	c
consequences	i
so	c
,	c
if	c
they	c
really	c
wanted	c
their	c
privacy	c
,	c
why	c
did	c
they	c
choose	c
a	c
"	c
public	c
job	c
"	c
?	c
?	c

My	c
name	c
is	c
*	c

*	c
.	c

We	c
were	c
there	c
at	c
19:15	c
as	i
the	c
show	c
was	c
starting	c
at	c
19:30	c
for	i
getting	i
our	c
tickets	c
.	c

was	c
We	i
are	c
asking	c
you	c
to	c
return	c
our	c
money	c
.	c

Kim	c
explained	c
her	i
that	c
she	c
kept	c
the	i
distance	c
from	c
the	c
other	c
students	c
because	c
her	c
father	c
was	c
in	c
prison	c
and	c
did	i
n't	i
want	i
no	i
one	i
to	c
find	c
out	c
.	c

Kim	c
was	c
terrified	i
because	c
everyone	c
was	c
making	c
fun	c
on	i
her	c
and	c
very	i
angry	c
with	c
Pat	c
.	c

Pat	c
had	c
to	c
make	c
up	i
.	i

They	c
all	i
got	i
to	c
know	c
the	c
real	c
Kim	c
know	i
.	c

He	c
did	c
not	c
play	i
in	i
the	i
evening	c
.	c

It	c
made	c
me	c
sad	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
we	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
restaurant	c
in	c
your	c
theater	i
after	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

He	c
complained	c
about	c
a	i
lot	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
very	c
good	c
for	c
us	c
but	c
I	c
think	c
we	c
should	c
think	c
about	i
more	c
carefully	c
when	c
we	c
buy	c
something	c
for	c
our	c
children	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
for	i
explaining	i
some	c
problems	c
I	c
had	c
when	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
to	c
see	c
one	c
of	c
your	c
company	c
's	c
musical	c
shows	c
called	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
"	c
.	c

Another	c
problem	c
was	c
the	i
start	c
of	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
finished	c
working	i
I	c
had	c
to	c
hurry	i
up	i
because	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
at	c
19:30	c
and	c
it	c
was	c
19:00	c
.	c

When	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
over	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
have	c
dinner	c
to	i
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
but	c
I	c
found	c
it	c
closed	c
because	c
your	c
company	c
is	c
lacked	i
of	i
employees	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

I	c
wish	c
I	c
had	c
never	c
told	c
her	c
anything	c
.	c

Suddenly	c
,	c
I	c
heard	c
step	i
noises	i
that	c
were	c
getting	c
closer	c
to	c
me	c
.	c

After	c
a	c
few	c
words	c
which	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
pay	c
attention	c
to	c
,	c
my	c
teacher	c
went	i
out	i
the	c
class	i
.	c

As	c
soon	c
as	c
I	c
entered	c
that	c
room	c
I	c
realised	c
he	c
had	c
forgotten	i
our	c
exams	c
there	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
told	c
her	c
this	i
piece	i
of	i
news	c
,	c
she	c
got	i
surprised	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
be	c
accomodated	i
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
as	c
do	i
not	c
like	c
sleeping	c
on	c
the	i
mattres	i
and	c
I	c
get	c
allergy	i
to	c
rubber	c
.	c

Is	c
shopping	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
?	c

There	c
are	c
different	c
opinions	c
and	c
points	c
of	c
view	c
.	c

I	c
like	c
shopping	c
very	c
much	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
you	c
have	c
a	c
wide	c
variety	c
of	c
shops	c
you	c
can	c
buy	c
food	c
.	i

The	c
second	c
thing	c
I	c
like	c
about	c
shopping	c
is	c
the	c
possibility	c
to	c
find	c
your	c
own	c
style	c
buying	i
clothes	c
in	c
the	c
small	c
boutiques	c
.	c

The	c
third	c
reason	c
I	c
enjoy	c
shopping	c
is	c
that	c
I	c
never	c
go	c
alone	c
just	c
to	c
buy	c
a	c
thing	c
I	c
need	c
.	c

Although	c
my	c
brother	c
thinks	c
the	c
better	c
way	c
to	c
have	c
fun	c
is	c
to	c
watch	c
TV	c
than	c
to	c
be	c
pushed	c
in	c
crowded	c
shops	c
,	c
I	c
do	c
not	c
agree	c
.	c

The	c
play	c
should	c
start	i
at	c
19.30	c
but	c
it	c
started	c
forty-five	c
minutes	c
later	c
,	c
we	c
were	c
waitting	i
over	i
there	c
with	i
out	i
doing	i
anything	i
.	c

I	c
hope	c
that	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
solved	i
properly	c

"	c
Somebody	c
had	i
hurt	i
her	c
and	c
had	i
let	i
her	c
without	c
help	c
"	c
Mourk	i
said	c
angrily	c
.	c

We	c
will	c
make	c
him	c
pay	c
.	c

Hey	c
Listen	i
guys	c
we	i
will	c
take	c
his	c
dog	c
which	c
love	i
very	c
much	c
and	c
we	c
will	c
sell	c
it	c
to	c
Sally	c
who	c
wants	c
one	c
.	c

Next	c
morning	c
as	i
Pat	c
was	c
going	c
to	c
school	c
met	i
Bad	c
Jon	c
.	i

Bad	c
Jon	c
understood	c
and	c
talked	c
immediately	c
to	c
his	c
father	c
.	i

There	c
are	c
four	c
different	c
shows	c
.	c

The	c
Home	c
of	c
the	c
Future	c

I	c
have	c
further	i
ideas	c
:	i
In	c
the	c
futur	i
,	c
maybe	c
in	c
2113	c
,	c
there	c
will	c
are	i
houses	c
like	c
now	c
but	c
only	i
with	c
more	c
technical	c
things	c
.	c

The	i
life	i
at	c
home	c
will	c
be	c
more	i
easy	i
because	c
a	i
refrigerator	c
which	c
fill	i
up	i
itself	i
or	c
a	c
bathroom	c
which	c
clean	i
itself	c
.	c

These	c
things	c
and	c
a	c
lot	c
more	c
went	i
change	c
or	c
wont	i
be	c
forgotten	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
.	i

It	c
was	c
n't	c
perfect	i
evening	c
out	c
,	c
how	i
you	c
did	i
promise	i
in	c
your	c
a	c
advertisement	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
want	c
ask	i
for	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

For	i
the	c
last	c
one	c
hundred	c
years	c
science	c
and	c
technology	c
did	i
big	i
step	c
if	i
we	c
looking	i
to	i
back	c
.	c

Before	c
it	c
was	c
only	c
emegination	i
.	c

These	c
are	c
some	c
points	c
I	c
want	c
mention	i
about	c
the	c
differencies	i
between	c
the	i
advertisement	c
said	c
and	c
the	c
realities	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
a	i
such	i
disappointing	i
.	c

It	c
was	c
45	c
minutes	c
later	c
than	c
it	c
suppose	i
to	c
be	c
.	c

Forth	i
,	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

How	c
could	c
you	c
arrange	c
work	c
like	c
that	c
?	c

It	c
took	c
quite	c
long	i
time	c
to	c
adjust	c
in	i
the	c
multi	i
culture	i
in	c
the	c
language	c
institue	i
.	c

I	c
really	c
wished	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
friend	c
can	i
share	c
everything	c
is	i
going	c
in	i
our	c
lives	c
.	c

We	c
had	c
a	c
fantastic	c
time	c
together	c
for	c
three	c
monthes	i
.	c

Even	i
we	i
could	i
make	c
a	c
trip	c
to	c
Paris	c
in	c
the	c
school	c
holiday	c
!	c

I	c
love	c
nature	c
and	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
record	c
the	c
Californian	c
landscapes	c
.	c

I	c
helped	c
my	c
friend	c
Jane	c
at	c
the	c
concert	c
!	c

I	c
never	c
imagined	c
how	c
many	c
people	c
is	i
involved	c
in	c
the	c
organization	c
!	i

In	c
the	c
area	c
of	c
publicity	c
we	c
were	c
about	c
50	c
guys	c
,	c
all	c
of	c
us	c
investigating	c
,	c
calling	c
to	i
radio	c
stations	c
,	c
organizing	c
the	c
reporters	c
,	c
specifying	c
where	c
the	c
press	c
would	c
be	c
for	c
the	c
interview	c
that	c
took	c
place	c
afterwards	c
...	c
yet	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
an	i
incredible	i
satisfation	i
when	c
everything	c
finished	i
just	c
fine	c
!	c

Looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

And	c
finally	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
to	c
send	c
me	c
some	c
pictures	c
of	c
the	c
place	c
as	c
I	c
am	c
dying	c
to	c
know	c
what	c
it	c
is	c
like	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

The	c
organiser	c
of	c
the	c
concert	c
asked	c
my	c
school	c
for	c
about	c
15	c
people	c
,	c
who	c
does	i
art	c
,	c
to	c
help	c
decorate	c
the	c
stage	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
the	c
best	c
day	c
of	c
my	c
life	c
and	c
certainly	c
for	c
others	c
,	c
too	c
.	c

For	c
the	c
attention	c
to	i
the	c
manager	c
:	c
I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
organization	c
of	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
that	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
presented	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
said	c
that	c
the	c
stars	c
who	c
were	c
invited	i
to	i
the	i
estatement	i
were	c
Dany	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
and	c
she	c
told	c
her	c
mother	c
what	c
had	c
happened	c
during	c
the	c
concert	c
.	c

Thanks	c
for	c
you	i
letter	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
is	i
great	c
and	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
try	c
it	c
.	c

What	c
clothes	c
should	c
I	c
taken	i
?	c

Because	c
all	i
students	c
in	c
English	i
class	c
are	c
from	c
all	c
over	c
the	c
world	c
.	c

Nowdays	i
internet	i
makes	i
us	c
closer	c
and	c
closer	c
.	c

Canteen	c
.	c

Football	c
.	c

You	c
ca	c
n't	c
forget	c
football	c
.	c

These	i
are	i
what	c
I	c
think	c
should	c
be	c
filmed	c
.	c

With	c
reference	c
to	c
the	c
accomodation	i
I	c
would	c
rather	c
stay	c
in	c
tent	i
because	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
the	c
best	c
way	c
to	c
socialize	c
.	c

For	i
what	i
concernes	i
the	c
activities	c
I	i
think	c
that	c
swimming	c
and	c
climbing	c
are	c
the	c
most	c
suitable	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
had	i
a	c
course	c
of	i
climbing	c
even	c
though	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
take	c
up	c
this	c
hobby	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

Before	c
that	c
I	c
had	c
never	c
thought	c
I	c
would	c
play	c
with	c
a	c
famous	c
group	c
.	c

It	c
did	c
n't	c
sound	c
very	c
exciting	c
to	c
me	c
but	c
I	c
accepted	c
above	i
all	i
because	c
I	c
was	c
curious	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
what	c
I	c
found	c
was	c
n't	c
what	c
I	c
expected	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Ryan	c
:	c

As	c
you	c
asked	c
me	c
to	c
send	c
you	c
further	c
information	c
about	c
three	c
points	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
sending	c
you	c
my	c
preferences	c
as	c
follows	c
:	c

Thanks	c
in	c
advance	c
for	c
you	i
advice	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
n't	c
even	c
hear	c
my	c
own	c
voice	c
.	c

Anyway	c
,	c
I	c
also	c
laughed	c
a	c
lot	c
,	c
the	c
music	c
was	c
fantastic	c
,	c
and	c
the	c
stars	c
were	c
really	c
nice	c
to	c
every	i
one	i
.	c

Bety	c

But	c
nothing	c
was	c
perfect	c
.	c

The	c
show	c
should	c
started	i
at	c
half	c
past	c
7	c
pm	c
but	c
nothing	c
happened	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
saw	c
some	c
foreign	c
actors	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
know	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
wrong	i
and	i
afraid	i
about	i
it	c
and	c
I	c
remember	i
that	c
this	c
was	c
the	c
third	c
problem	c
this	i
evening	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
this	i
are	c
reasons	c
enough	c
for	i
enquiring	i
about	c
some	i
money	c
back	c
.	c

Bergut	c
Hunrtner	c

You	c
can	c
say	c
they	c
wore	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
clothes	c
at	c
one	c
time	c
.	c

Nowaday	i
people	c
wear	c
lesser	i
clothes	c
.	c

But	c
this	c
problem	c
is	c
solving	c
by	i
itselfes	i
.	c

MODERN	c
TECHNOLOGY	c

The	c
fast	i
and	i
growing	c
computer	c
industry	c
is	c
giving	i
us	c
less	c
and	c
less	c
physical	c
work	c
due	i
to	i
a	i
mechanical	i
concept	i
.	c

Besides	c
all	c
those	c
improvements	c
and	c
confort	i
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
stop	c
thinking	c
where	c
all	c
this	c
will	c
lead	c
us	c
.	c

The	c
advertised	c
beginning	i
time	i
is	c
19:30	c
.	c

But	c
due	i
to	i
some	c
unknown	c
reasons	i
,	c
the	c
play	c
did	c
n't	c
start	c
until	c
20:15	c
.	c

What	c
made	c
things	c
even	c
worse	c
was	c
that	c
the	c
leading	c
actor	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
did	c
not	c
appear	c
at	i
the	c
stage	c
at	c
all	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
,	c
the	c
conductor	i
did	c
n't	c
offer	c
me	c
any	c
discounts	c
as	i
you	c
had	c
advertised	c
in	i
the	c
poster	c
when	i
I	c
bought	c
the	c
ticket	c
.	c

Without	c
the	c
development	c
of	c
modern	c
technology	c
,	c
it	c
may	c
take	c
your	i
several	c
years	c
to	c
reach	c
the	i
destination	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
hoping	c
to	c
devote	c
myself	c
into	i
the	i
development	i
of	i
it	i
.	c

I	i
ll	i
be	c
on	c
vacation	c
until	c
August	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
this	i
is	c
the	c
best	c
month	c
to	c
travel	c
.	c

According	i
to	i
my	i
great	i
experience	i
on	i
climbing	i
,	c
I	c
prefer	c
accommodation	i
in	c
log	c
cabins	c
because	c
in	c
tents	c
we	c
ca	c
n't	c
sleep	c
or	c
being	i
well	c
with	c
such	i
cold	c
!	c

Never	c
the	c
less	c
in	i
summer	c
we	c
ca	c
n't	c
resist	c
such	c
hot	i
!	c

I	c
really	c
apreciate	i
this	c
kind	c
of	c
trip	c
and	c
I	c
'm	c
really	c
thank	i
your	i
truly	i
attention	c
.	c

For	c
many	c
people	c
,	c
shopping	c
had	i
always	c
been	c
only	c
for	c
one	c
kind	c
of	c
elite	c
,	c
or	c
social	c
class	c
;	c
not	c
all	c
people	c
can	c
go	c
shopping	c
and	c
buy	c
hundreds	c
and	c
thousands	c
of	c
stuff	i
in	c
those	c
big	c
malls	c
as	c
distraction	i
.	c

Fashion	c
of	c
the	c
Future	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
in	c
100	c
years	c
from	c
now	c
,	c
the	c
clothes	c
fashion	c
will	c
be	c
totaly	i
different	c
.	c

I	c
play	c
basketball	c
at	c
university	c
and	c
my	c
level	i
is	c
quite	c
good	c
but	c
I	i
am	c
really	c
enjoying	c
is	c
being	c
a	c
referee	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
swim	c
everyday	c
if	c
is	i
able	i
.	c

Althoung	i
swimming	c
is	c
so	c
bored	i
,	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
good	c
help	i
for	i
curing	i
my	c
back	c
.	c

Looking	c
forwards	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c

Yours	c
sincerily	i

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
next	c
summer	c

to	c
Spain	c
to	c
help	c

that	i
is	c
the	c
best	c
concert	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
will	c
come	c
there	c

Love	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
I	i
want	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
I	c
'm	c
very	c
keen	c
on	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
who	c
was	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
main	c
reasons	c
why	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
come	i

Yours	c
faithfully	c

Modern	c
technology	c
has	c
actually	c
changed	c
my	c
life	c
quite	c
a	c
lot	c
.	c

Even	c
though	c
it	c
was	c
my	c
first	c
one	c
I	c
managed	c
and	c
I	c
got	c
to	c
know	c
pretty	i
fast	i
the	i
way	i
they	i
work	i
.	c

I	c
should	c
not	c
forget	c
mobile	c
phones	c
.	c

Several	c
european	i
companies	c
like	c
Nokia	c
or	c
Ericsson	c
are	c
focusing	c
on	c
mobiles	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
told	c
that	c
in	c
a	c
couple	c
of	c
years	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
possible	c
to	c
send	c
and	i
e-mail	c
either	c
from	c
the	i
computer	c
or	c
from	c
the	i
mobile	c
which	i
is	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
great	c

I	c
'm	c
extremly	i
happy	c
because	c
not	c
only	c
do	c
I	c
earn	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
money	c
but	c
also	c
I	c
'm	c
learning	c
a	c

I	c
'd	c
like	c

to	c

before	c

When	c
I	c
got	i
plenty	c
of	c

sometimes	c
I	c

a	c

of	c
it	c
with	c
some	c

buying	c
a	c
good	c

One	c
good	c

ALBiTO	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c
the	c
competition	c
Organiser	c
,	c

Please	c
could	c
you	c
send	c
me	c
an	c
itenerary	i
of	c
the	c
trip	c
?	c

I	c
like	c
to	c
look	c
at	c
the	c
beautiful	c
clothes	c
and	c
I	c
dream	c
of	c
wearing	c
them	c
.	c

We	c
all	c
just	c
have	c
to	c
wait	c
and	c
see	c
...	c

I	c
think	c
the	c
next	c
time	c
you	c
write	i
an	c
advertiment	i
you	c
write	i
it	i
with	i
the	c
right	c
information	c
.	c

Let	i
see	c
if	c
we	c
use	c
the	i
modern	c
technology	c
we	i
may	i
have	c
good	c
and	i
bad	c
results	c
.	c

It	c
informs	c
people	c
,	c
hospital	i
use	c
modern	c
technogoly	i
computer	i
helps	c
staders	i
help	i
people	c
do	c
their	c
job	c
.	c

Modern	c
technology	c
is	c
effecting	i
people	c
good	i
and	c
bad	c
way	c
.	c

Acording	i
to	i
your	c
letter	c
,	c
you	c
asked	c
me	c
to	c
choose	c
two	c
of	c
your	c
activities	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
what	c
tipe	i
of	c
clothes	c
do	i
I	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
and	i
the	c
amount	c
of	c
money	c
that	c
I	c
'm	c
going	c
to	c
spend	c
,	c
so	c
if	c
you	c
please	i
could	i
help	c
me	c
giving	i
me	c
this	c
information	c
I	c
would	c
be	c
very	c
pleased	c
.	c

We	c
all	i
have	i
been	c
shooping	i
once	c
in	c
our	c
lifes	i
and	c
sometimes	c
it	c
probably	c
has	c
not	c
been	c
very	c
enjoyable	c
,	c
why	c
?	c
we	i
had	c
a	c
class	c
discussion	c
and	c
we	c
all	c
agree	c
in	i
some	c
points	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
if	i
we	c
go	c
to	c
a	c
big	c
mall	c
we	c
will	c
probably	c
never	c
find	c
what	c
we	c
were	i
looking	c
for	c
,	c
and	c
instead	c
of	c
buing	i
what	c
we	c
came	c
for	c
we	c
will	c
go	i
out	i
with	c
lots	c
of	c
things	c
that	c
we	c
liked	c
but	c
we	c
will	c
never	c
use	c
.	c

So	c
with	c
this	c
letter	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
ask	c
for	c
some	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
will	c
answer	c
my	c
letter	c
and	c
correct	i
the	c
problems	c
in	i
your	c
theatre	c
.	c

If	c
I	c
got	i
Internet	i
I	c
can	c
send	c
e-mails	c
,	c
I	c
need	c
n't	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
letter	c
box	c
,	c
I	c
save	c
time	c
.	c

We	c
should	c
also	c
move	c
our	c
body	c
and	c
not	c
only	c
use	c
our	c
brain	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
disappointed	c
because	c
the	c
actors	c
was	i
n't	i
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
.	c

Instead	c
of	c
them	c
you	c
had	c
different	c
actors	c
.	c

Another	c
point	i
is	c
that	c
the	c
discounts	c
was	i
n't	i
available	c
although	c
I	c
could	i
red	i
it	i
before	i
at	i
your	c
notice	i
.	c

Please	c
call	c
me	c
back	c
soon	c
.	c

I	c
use	i
also	i
the	c
internet	i
when	c
I	c
need	c
any	c
informations	i
for	i
example	c
I	i
need	c
them	i
for	c
school	c
or	c
private	i
for	i
myself	c
.	c

And	c
also	c
a	c
good	c
intention	i
for	c
me	c
is	c
the	c
Handy	i
,	c
because	c
everywhere	c
I	c
go	c
I	c
can	c
talk	c
to	c
other	c
people	c
.	c

This	c
event	i
was	c
not	c
the	c
only	c
one	c
because	c
another	c
problem	c
was	c
the	i
respect	i
of	i
the	c
time	c
.	c

The	c
third	c
problem	c
was	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
writting	i
that	c
the	i
discounts	c
were	c
available	c
,	c
but	c
when	c
I	c
get	i
there	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
true	c
.	c

How	c
has	c
modern	c
technology	c
changed	c
your	c
daily	c
life	c
?	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

All	c
the	c
people	c
are	c
there	c
most	i
on	c
the	c
same	c
day	c
because	c
there	c
are	c
not	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
other	c
possibilities	i
for	c
shopping	c
while	i
the	c
week	c
for	c
the	i
employees	i
.	c

2000	c

I	c
am	c
so	c
marvellous	i
about	c
winning	c
the	c
competition	c
.	c

Secondly	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
tent	i
as	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
natural	c
life	c
while	c
I	c
am	c
at	c

During	c

lots	c

some	c

ca	c
n't	c

I	c
will	c
be	c

Because	c
I	c
need	c

my	c
italian	i
and	i
I	c
am	c
taking	c
a	c
very	c
important	c

Because	c
I	c

go	c
on	c

with	c
my	c

It	c

Thank	c

whitout	i

And	c
by	c
understanding	c
the	c
book	c
,	c
you	c
'll	c
also	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
better	c
understand	c
what	c
happens	c
nowadays	c
in	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
countries	c

Just	c

Dear	c

I	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
about	c
3	c
%	c
of	c
students	c
suggest	c
that	c
also	i
chemistry	i
lessons	i
should	i
be	c
filmed	c
,	c
because	c
they	c
often	c
take	c
place	c
in	c
the	c
laboratory	c
that	c
the	c
school	c
has	c
lately	i
built	c
;	c
in	c
fact	c
some	c
experiments	c
might	c
be	c
filmed	c
.	c

I	c
expected	c
to	c
buy	c
ticket	i
cheaply	c
but	c
no	c
discounts	c
were	c
available	c
.	c

I	c
found	c
the	c
theater	i
rather	c
noisy	c
as	c
I	c
arrived	c
very	c
early	c
to	c
sit	c
in	c
the	c
front	c
row	c

It	c
's	c
comletely	i

Have	c

New	c
Millenium	i

'	c
It	c
's	c
completely	c
different	c
!	c

But	c
the	c
question	c
no	c
one	c
answer	i
is	c
what	c
is	i
fashion	i
in	c
100	c
year	i
's	i
time	c
?	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
because	c
I	c
want	c
you	c
to	c
give	c
the	c

your	c

the	c

closed	c
,	c
for	c
any	i
reasons	c
you	c
did	c
n't	c
take	i
to	i
us	c
.	c

In	i
the	i
beginning	i
,	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
bring	c
him	c
in	i
my	c
house	c
where	c
everybody	c
would	c
wait	c
for	c
him	c
.	c

But	c
he	c
wanted	c
to	c
stay	c
at	c
his	i
home	c
.	c

But	c
he	c
was	c
a	i
Pat	c
's	c
friend	c
too	c
,	c
and	c
Pat	c
explained	c
everything	c
to	c
Leon	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
I	c
am	c
surprise	i
to	c
received	i
the	i
letter	c

I	c
read	c
the	c
information	c
as	i
you	c
gave	c
to	c
me	c
,	i
it	i
is	c
very	c
interesting	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
arrived	i
there	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
to	i
painting	i
and	c
take	c
a	c
photography	c
because	i
both	c
of	c
its	i
was	i
my	c
hobby	i
.	c

Secondly	c
it	i
is	i
the	c
super	i
star	i
as	i
they	i
came	c
to	c
show	i
at	c
concert	i
.	c

They	c
are	i
very	c
cool	c
.	c

miss	c
you	c
,	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
treating	c
me	c
in	c
that	c
way	c
.	c

-	c
Activities	c
:	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
keen	c
on	c
surfing	c
because	c
,	c
where	c
I	c
live	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
pactice	i
it	c
every	c
day	c
.	c

Oh	c
,	c
no	c
!	c

That	c
's	c
so	c
good	c
when	c
you	c
have	c
money	i
for	i
joy	i
it	c
but	c
,	c
appart	i
from	c
that	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
many	c
problems	c
.	c

On	i
the	i
other	i
hand	i
there	c
is	c
a	c
big	c
problem	c
:	c
the	c
mony	i
.	c

So	c
,	c
do	c
you	c
believe	c
that	c
a	c
shopping	c
bag	i
like	c
this	c
one	c
is	c
an	c
enjoyable	c
shopping	i
day	i
?	c

This	c
is	c
mostly	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
a	c
job	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
made	c
further	c
arrangements	c
for	c
the	c
other	c
summer	c
months	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
mostly	c
because	c
I	c
like	c
fresh	c
air	c
at	c
night	c
.	c

I	c
will	c
wait	c
to	c
hearing	i
from	c
you	c
,	c
soon	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

I	c
mean	c
shopping	c
with	c
a	c
real	c
purpose	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
a	c
real	c
nightmare	c
when	c
you	c
try	c
to	c
match	c
everything	c
:	c
from	c
the	c
size	c
,	c
the	c
colour	c
to	c
the	c
sawings	i
of	c
the	c
suit	c
that	c
is	c
acceptable	c
for	c
everyone	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
achievement	c
for	c
you	c
when	c
you	c
buy	c
the	c
suit	c
that	c
is	c
perfect	c
for	c
everyone	c

Dear	c

I	c
want	c

From	c

What	c

do	c
now	c
?	c

The	c

want	c
to	c
learn	c
another	c

Let	c

do	c
more	c
excises	i
about	c
English	c
to	c
help	c
them	c
pass	c
the	c
exam	c

I	c
read	c
your	c
advertisement	c
.	c

Fashion	c
of	c
the	c
Future	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
informing	i
letter	c
and	c
your	c
congratulations	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
very	i
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
it	c
as	c
I	c
've	c
never	c
been	c
in	i
the	c
U.S.A.	c
before	c
.	c

First	c
,	c
it	c
seemed	c
to	c
me	c
odd	c
because	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
understand	c
why	c
they	c
faint	i
,	c
but	c
as	c
the	c
concert	c
went	c
on	c
,	c
the	c
heat	c
in	c
the	c
air	c
was	c
increasing	c
and	c
so	c
was	c
the	c
number	c
of	c
the	c
fainted	i
.	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
manage	i
to	c
listen	c
the	i
music	c
and	c
I	c
must	c
admit	c
that	c
I	c
liked	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
actually	c
injoyed	i
it	c
working	c
there	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
n't	c
hesitate	c
to	c
work	c
there	c
again	c
.	c

I	c
've	c
just	c
received	c
the	c
letter	c
telling	c
me	c
that	c
I	c
've	c
won	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
.	c

I	c
prefer	c
sleeping	c
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
(	c
I	c
made	i
a	c
very	c
bad	c
experience	c
with	c
tents	c
while	c
I	c
was	c
camping	c
with	c
friends	c
last	c
year	c
)	c

Could	c
you	c
please	c
tell	c
me	c
if	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
special	i
clothes	c
with	c
me	c
.	i

If	c
it	c
's	c
not	c
two	i
much	c
to	c
ask	c
,	c
could	c
you	c
also	c
tell	c
me	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
should	c
take	c
with	c
me	c
for	c
food	c
or	c
evening	c
activities	c
at	c
the	c
camp	c

So	c
I	c
took	c
the	c
train	c
to	c
Lausanne	c
(	c
I	c
live	c
in	c
Lavaux	c
and	c
it	c
's	c
impossible	c
to	c
find	c
a	i
corect	i
pair	c
of	c
sneakers	c
in	c
this	i
whole	i
damned	i
city	i
!	c
)	c
to	c
buy	c
a	c
new	c
pair	c
to	c
play	c
outdoor	i
this	i
summer	c
.	c

After	c
having	c
visited	i
shops	i
during	i
10	c
hours	c
and	c
tried	c
at	c
least	c
2,000	c
shoes	c
,	c
I	c
finally	c
found	c
what	c
I	c
was	c
looking	c
for	c
.	c

The	c
shoes	c
of	c
my	c
dreams	c
(	c
well	c
designed	c
and	c
not	c
too	c
expensive	c
)	c
So	i
I	c
went	c
back	c
to	c
the	c
station	c
,	c
very	c
proud	c
of	c
me	i
with	c
my	c
sneakers	c
in	c
a	c
white	c
plastic	c
bag	c
and	c
a	c
great	c
smile	c
on	c
my	c
face	c
.	c

I	c
stayed	c
that	i
happy	c
during	c
the	c
travel	i
,	c
thinking	c
of	c
how	c
cool	c
I	c
would	c
look	c
on	i
the	c
playground	c
with	c
my	c
brand	i
new	i
shoes	c
on	c
.	c

I	c
immediately	c
wanted	c
to	c
show	c
him	c
what	c
I	c
had	c
bought	c
to	c
make	c
him	c
jealous	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
in	c
response	c
to	c
your	c
letter	c
,	c
in	c
which	c
you	c
told	c
me	c
I	c
am	c
the	c
winner	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
,	c
and	c
my	c
intention	c
is	c
to	c
try	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
all	c
the	c
information	c
you	c
may	c
need	c
according	i
to	i
your	i
letter	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
I	c
had	i
another	c
trip	c
to	i
Spain	c
in	i
August	c
,	c
that	i
is	c
the	c
perfect	c
month	c
for	c
me	c
,	c
otherwise	c
I	c
would	c
not	c
travel	c
to	c
Spain	c
.	c

About	c
accommodation	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
tents	i
instead	c
of	c
log	i
cabins	i
and	c
the	c
reason	c
is	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
used	c
tents	c
and	c
this	c
could	c
be	c
a	c
very	c
exciting	c
experience	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
everything	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

Dear	c
Kim	c

As	c
you	c
know	c
I	i
helped	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
last	c
month	c
,	i
I	c
did	c
things	c
as	c
unusual	c
in	i
me	c
as	c
cleaning	c
instruments	c
,	c
organise	i
people	c
,	c
and	c
also	c
look	i
after	c
the	c
clothes	i
of	i
the	i
artists	i
.	c

Best	c
Wishes	c

Unfortunately	c
I	c
'm	c
free	c
only	c
in	c
July	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
your	c
answer	c
and	c
to	c
the	c
camp	c
,	c
naturally	c
.	c

You	c
might	c
say	c
that	c
it	c
is	i
quite	c
boring	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
so	i
funny	i
.	c

Byran	c
Adams	c

We	c

Washing	c
and	c
cleaning	c
have	c
been	i
already	i
done	c
by	c
my	c
robot	c
maid	c

Our	c
robot	c
maid	c
will	c
do	c
all	c

To	c

modern	c

our	c

would	i
be	c
more	c

You	c
also	c
told	c
me	c
that	c
I	c
would	c
have	c
the	c
chance	c
of	c
doing	c
two	c
activities	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
enquire	c
about	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
should	c
take	c
with	c
me	c
and	c
also	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
would	c
be	c
most	c
suitable	c
to	c
wear	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Nevertheless	c
the	c
worst	c
will	c
come	c
when	c
you	c
lose	c

and	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
spend	c
the	c
whole	c
day	c
looking	c
for	c
him/her	c

On	c
balance	c
I	c
would	c
say	c
that	c
although	c
it	c
is	c
true	c
that	c
shopping	c
it	i
is	c
not	c
a	c
difficult	c
activitie	i
,	c
it	c
is	c
also	c
true	c
that	c
is	i
definetly	i
not	c
an	c
enjoyable	c
one	c
.	c

I	c
received	c
your	c
letter	c
this	c
morning	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
suprised	i

My	c

After	c
he	c
has	i
got	i
a	c

he	c
became	c

If	c

What	c
have	c
you	c
been	c
doing	c
there	c
in	c
New	c
York	c
?	c

Did	c
you	c
find	c
a	c
girlfriend	c
?	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
about	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
that	c
happend	i
here	c
in	c
São	c
Rafael	c
.	c

I	c
helped	c
with	c
the	c
clothing	i
with	i
some	c
paperwork	c
,	c
with	c
the	c
microphones	c
,	c
with	c
the	c
computers	c
.	c

They	c
promissed	i
me	c
that	c
they	c
would	c
call	c
me	c
some	i
day	i
,	c
what	i
I	c
particulary	i
doubt	c
.	c

Lots	c
of	c
kisses	c
and	c
hugs	c

On	i
the	i
other	i
hand	i
,	c
the	c
theatre	c
Restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
they	c
've	c
got	c
a	c
problem	c
with	c
the	c
schedule	i
's	i
organization	i
.	c

This	c
has	c
helped	c
me	c
a	c
lot	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
can	c
talk	c
with	c
my	c
friends	c
that	i
are	i
living	i
in	c
other	c
countries	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
learned	c
a	c
lot	c
with	c
Internet	i
,	i
it	i
gaves	i
me	c
the	c
posibility	i
to	c
know	c
more	c
about	c
things	c
I	i
've	i
never	i
knew	i
.	i

My	c
knowledge	c
has	c
been	c
developed	c
and	c
also	c
my	c
life	i
style	i
.	c

My	c
greatest	c
wish	c
was	c
seeing	i
Danny	c
Brook	c
's	c
performance	c
;	c
you	c
know	c
it	i
's	i
the	c
best	c
singer	c

What	c
an	c
absurd	c
thing	c
,	c
do	c
n't	c
you	c
think	c
so	c
?	c

Nowadays	c
especially	i
in	c
the	c
west	i
area	c
of	c
the	c
world	c
science	i
and	c
technology	c
have	c
done	i
great	c
,	c
enormous	c
steps	c
in	c
directions	i
of	i
the	i
progress	c
.	c

Not	c
only	c
for	c
the	c
great	c
nations	c
,	c
but	c
also	c
for	c
every	i
their	i
inhabitants	c
.	c

Today	c
it	c
's	c
absurd	c
not	c
knowing	i
how	c
a	c
computer	c
works	c
,	c
or	c
how	c
to	c
use	c
Internet	i

But	c
sometimes	c
I	c
'd	c
rather	c
to	i
switch	i
them	c
off	c
and	c
think	c
of	c
what	c
I	c
could	i
waste	i
,	c
like	c
love	c
and	c
friendship	c
.	c

I	c
wish	c
all	c
the	c
world	c
would	c
do	c
the	c
same	c
.	c

Vico	c
says	c
that	c
progress	c
gives	i
up	i
when	c
Man	c
have	i
noticed	c
that	c
he	c
have	i
been	c
wasting	c
those	c
values	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
this	c
letter	c
because	c
we	c
saw	c
your	c
programme	c
for	c
our	c
next	c
trip	c
to	c
London	c
and	c
we	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
suggest	c
you	i
just	c
one	c
thing	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
is	i
student	i
free	i
.	c

I	c
have	c
never	c
sailed	c
but	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
well	i
swimmer	c
.	c

Last	c
summer	c
I	c
took	c
a	c
course	i
of	i
one	i
week	i
in	i
Switzerland	i
of	i
climbing	i
so	c
I	c
have	i
good	i
knowledge	i
of	i
this	c
sport	c
.	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c

In	i
the	i
shops	i
is	i
worth	i
,	c
if	c
you	c
are	c
lucky	c
and	c
you	c
find	c
a	i
clothes	c
with	i
your	i
right	c
size	c
you	c
will	c
wait	c
20	c
min	i
.	i

In	c
the	c
supermarket	c
is	i
the	c
same	c
.	c

Why	c
not	c
buy	i
with	i
internet	i
or	c
if	c
you	c
have	c
a	c
nice	c
mother	c
at	c
home	c
enjoy	i
this	i
time	i
because	c
shopping	c
is	c
like	c
go	i
in	i
the	c
jungle	c
.	c

We	c
think	c
that	c
perhaps	c
in	i
Tuesday	c
March	c
14	c
,	i
we	c
could	c
change	c
the	c
time	c
of	i
going	i
to	c
Science	i
Museum	c
,	c
and	c
(	i
we	i
)	i
go	c
earlier	i
to	i
the	i
Museum	i
,	c
such	i
as	i
half	c
past	c
eight	c
on	i
the	c
morning	c
,	c
so	c
we	c
could	c
go	c
after	i
,	c
at	c
ten	c
o'clock	c
to	i
the	c
show	c
,	c
and	c
we	c
could	c
also	c
delay	c
going	c
shopping	c
on	c
that	c
afternoon	c
,	c
because	c
the	c
show	c
lasts	c
til	i
seven	c
o'clock	c
on	i
the	c
evening	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
to	c
know	i
more	c
about	c
fashion	c
.	c

Although	c
computers	c
will	c
give	c
us	c
all	c
the	c
material	c
things	c
,	c
it	i
could	i
not	c
give	c
us	c
things	c
like	c
the	c
feeling	c
of	c
being	c
in	c
your	c
home	c
,	c
have	i
,	c
etc.	c
That	i
things	c
wo	c
n't	c
change	c
in	c
our	c
home	c
.	c

I	c
acxepted	i
it	i
and	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
inform	c
you	c
that	c
I	c
can	c
travel	c
only	c
on	i
July	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
booked	c
my	c
anual	i
leave	c
that	i
period	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
should	c
have	c
with	c
me	c
,	i
where	c
can	c
I	c
keep	c
them	i
?	c

What	c
about	c
the	c
clothes	c
,	i
you	i
do	c
n't	c
mention	c
anything	c
.	i

I	c
helped	c
them	c
to	c
prepare	c
the	c
room	c
for	c
the	c
bads	i
and	c
I	c
decorated	c
the	c
place	c
for	c
the	c
singers	c
.	c

I	c
helped	c
them	c
to	c
the	i
music	c
and	c
to	i
the	c
songs	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
a	i
quite	i
difficult	c
assiment	i
but	c
I	c
got	c
very	i
good	c
experience	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
some	i
thing	i
that	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
expect	c
.	c

Also	c
,	c
it	c
happen	i
first	i
time	c
in	c
my	c
life	c
.	c

yours	c
sincerely	c

As	i
you	i
can	i
see	i
,	i
I	c
have	c
abosolutly	i
no	c
experience	c
in	c
it	c
.	c

What	i
kind	i
of	i
money	i
is	i
used	i
?	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

I	c
was	c
a	c
little	c
bit	c
disappointed	c
about	i
their	c
attitude	c
.	c

Mr	c
or	c
Mrs	c
Manager	c
of	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
.	c

So	c
therefore	i
I	i
would	c
like	c
you	c
to	c
pay	c
some	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
.	c

Yours	c

Taeron	c
Jon	c

But	c
we	c
do	c
n't	c
wear	c
them	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
let	c
you	c
know	c
that	c
I	c
can	c
only	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
that	c
is	c
the	c
only	c
time	c
I	c
can	c
take	c
leave	i
from	c
work	c
.	c

I	c
've	c
a	c
few	c
questions	c
to	c
ask	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
once	c
again	c
for	c
giving	c
me	c
good	i
news	c
!	c

Whilst	c
in	c
London	c
;	i
I	c
'll	c
be	c
facing	c
crowds	c
and	c
people	c
will	c
be	c
rushing	c
everywhere	c
.	c

As	c
I	c
'm	c
a	c
compulsive	c
buyer	c
,	c
I	c
'd	c
probably	c
ended	i
up	c
buying	c
other	c
things	c
as	c
well	c
.	c

By	c
the	c
time	c
I	c
get	i
home	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
be	c
completely	c
exhausted	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
can	c
see	c
,	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

I	c
WAS	c
DISAPPOINTED	c
TO	c
FIND	c
OUT	c
THAT	c
THE	c
ACTOR	c
WAS	c
NOT	c
THE	c
ONE	c
YOU	c
WROTE	c
I	i
DISCOVERED	c
THIS	c
ONLY	c
WHEN	c
THE	c
PLAY	c
STARTED	c
,	c
AND	c
IT	i
WAS	c
VERY	c
LATE	c
!	c

BECAUSE	c
FOR	c
ME	c
IT	c
WAS	c
NOT	c
A	c
"	c
PERFECT	c
EVENING	c
OUT	c
"	c
.	c

YOURS	c
FAITHFULLY	c

ON	c
THE	c
BUS	c
HE	c
SAW	c
A	c
ROBBER	i
WHILE	c
HE	c
WAS	c
STEALING	c
A	c
WALLET	c
,	c
HE	c
WANTED	c
TO	c
SCREAM	c
,	c
BUT	c
HE	c
WAS	c
ASTONISHED	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
annoyed	c
about	c
it	c
:	c
I	c
only	c
expected	c
the	c
discounts	c
you	c
had	c
promised	c
on	i
the	c
advertisement	c
and	c
,	c
as	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
university	c
student	c
,	c
I	c
would	i
have	c
a	c
right	c
on	i
it	i
.	c

Most	c
people	c
think	c
modern	c
technologies	c
are	c
n't	c
so	i
positive	c
as	c
they	c
are	c
often	c
showed	i
.	i

We	c
live	c
in	c
the	c
age	c
of	c
personal	c
computers	c
,	c
of	c
internet	i
,	c
of	c
the	c
mobile	c
phones	i
,	c
and	c
now	c
for	c
me	c
it	c
's	c
impossible	c
to	c
think	c
of	c
a	c
world	c
without	c
them	c
.	c

Then	c
,	c
surfing	c
in	i
internet	i
is	c
becoming	c
my	c
passion	c
:	c
it	c
's	c
incredible	c
how	c
many	c
unthinkable	c
activities	c
you	c
can	c
do	c
with	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
19:30	c
show	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
did	c
not	c
start	c
until	c
it	c
was	c
20:15	c
.	c

One	c
minute	c
I	c
told	c
her	c
the	c
biggest	c
secret	c
of	c
my	c
life	c
,	i
the	c
next	c
she	c
had	c
told	c
someone	c
all	c
about	c
it	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
the	c
person	c
who	c
helped	c
me	c
through	c
this	c
hard	c
time	c
was	c
,	c
surprisingly	c
,	c
Pat	c
.	c

When	c
she	c
was	c
comforting	c
me	c
I	c
noticed	c
she	c
had	c
changed	c
.	c

She	c
kept	c
every	c
single	c
one	c
of	c
my	c
secrets	c
well	c
,	c
and	c
not	i
surprisingly	c
,	c
she	c
became	c
my	c
best	c
friend	c
.	c

The	c
news	c
shook	c
me	c
to	c
the	c
very	c
core	c
.	c

I	c
cried	c
for	c
days	c
straight	i
,	c
eating	c
and	c
sleeping	c
very	c
little	c
.	c

The	c
show	c
is	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
at	c
the	c
Central	c
Exhibition	c
Hall	c
the	i
14th	c
of	c
March	c
from	c
10.00	c
to	c
19.00	c
.	c

There	i
will	i
be	i
shown	i
the	c
latest	c
fashions	c
,	c
leisure	i
and	c
sportwear	i
,	c
some	c
make	i
up	i
and	c
also	c
different	c
hairstyles	c
.	c

Almost	c
everyone	c
hates	c
other	c
people	c
gossip	i
in	i
their	c
private	c
things	i
.	c

First	c
the	c
musical	i
show	c
,	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
started	i
at	c
20:15	c
,	c
and	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
was	i
written	c
at	i
19:30	c
,	i
then	i
also	i
was	i
written	c
that	c
the	c
actor	c
was	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
but	c
in	c
the	c
show	c
appeared	i
a	i
different	i
actor	i
,	c
that	c
was	c
really	c
disappointing	c
.	c

Also	c
was	i
written	c
in	c
the	c
advertisment	i
that	c
some	c
discounts	c
were	c
available	c
,	c
but	c
there	c
was	i
n't	i
discounts	i
.	c

My	c
confession	c
caused	c
a	c
disaster	c
in	c
the	i
life	i
of	i
her	i
and	i
her	c
family	c
,	c
and	c
they	c
called	c
the	c
police	c
to	c
take	c
me	c
out	i
of	c
the	c
planet	c
or	c
arrested	i
,	c
so	c
that	c
I	c
ca	i
n't	i
see	c
her	c
again	c
.	c

The	c
police	c
caught	c
me	c
,	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
peacefully	c
in	c
my	c
room	c
,	c
and	c
put	c
me	c
covered	i
with	c
something	c
,	c
in	c
a	c
car	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
writting	i
to	c
you	c
because	c
I	i
've	i
been	i
in	i
the	c
International	c
Arts	c
Festival	c
and	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
pleasure	c
.	c

Faithfully	i
,	c

Thanks	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
,	i
it	c
was	c
nice	c
to	c
hear	c
from	c
you	c
again	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
go	c
dancing	c
whenever	c
I	c
want	c
but	c
telling	i
her	c
previously	i
.	c

My	c
father	c
is	c
a	c
bit	c
jealous	c
but	c
agrees	c
with	c
what	c
my	c
mum	c
says	c
.	c

Their	i
is	i
two	c
activities	c
.	c

I	c
was	i
playing	i
Basketball	c
in	i
the	i
university	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hear	i
from	c
you	c
!	c

They	c
just	c
meet	i
each	c
one	i
a	c
month	c
ago	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
I	c
am	c
studying	c
at	c
University	c
and	c
I	c
wonder	c
if	c
I	c
could	c
travel	c
on	i
July	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
exams	c
I	c
have	c
on	i
May	c
.	c

Apart	i
from	i
that	i
I	c
would	c
not	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
travel	c
there	c
until	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
June	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

Yours	c
Sincerely	c
,	c

Another	c
problem	c
was	c
the	c
band	c
.	c

The	c
singer	c
and	c
the	c
guitarist	c
were	c
so	c
angry	c
that	c
they	c
went	i
out	i
immediately	c
leaving	i
the	c
public	c
without	c
the	c
last	c
part	c
of	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Jane	i
Clark	c

However	c
I	i
think	c
that	c
International	c
Arts	c
Festival	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
idea	c
and	i
I	c
suggest	c
you	c
prepare	c
it	c
better	c
.	c

Thirdly	c
,	c
I	c
suggest	c
you	c
should	i
put	c
more	c
plays	c
and	c
films	c
next	i
year	c
,	c
because	c
watching	c
them	c
is	c
a	c
very	c
nice	c
way	c
of	c

If	c

yours	i
Sincerly	i

I	c
really	c
enjoyed	c
to	i
be	i
next	c
to	c
the	c
pop	c
stars	c
I	i
got	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
autographes	i
,	i
that	i
was	c
the	c
first	c
time	c
I	c
've	c
seen	c
like	i
Jagger	i
a	i

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

I	c
address	c
this	c
letter	c
to	c
the	c
manager	c
of	c
the	c
theatre	c
.	c

Third	c
point	c
,	c
your	c
advertisement	c
told	c
about	i
"	i
discount	c
available	c
"	c
about	i
the	c
ticket	i
's	i
price	i
but	c
it	i
was	c
n't	c
.	i

Fourth	c
point	c
,	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
visit	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
and	c
no	c
one	c
did	i
n't	i
know	i
why	c
!	c

We	c
live	c
in	c
a	c
society	c
where	c
the	i
technology	c
grows	i
up	i
everyday	i
.	c

Everyday	i
at	c
7:00	c
a.m	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
woken	c
up	c
by	c
my	c
radio	c
.	c

After	i
,	c
when	c
I	c
take	i
my	c
breakfast	c
,	c
I	c
use	c
my	c
toaster	c
for	c
my	c
bread	c
and	c
,	c
as	c
I	c
want	c
a	i
hot	c
milk	c
,	c
I	c
use	c
my	c
modern	c
oven	i
too	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
go	c
to	c
school	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
see	c
in	i
many	i
stores	i
the	i
new	i
tools	i
they	i
've	i
just	i
received	i

Dear	c
Jane	c
Clark	c
,	c
the	c
organiser	c
of	c
International	i
Arts	c
Festival	c

I	c
'm	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
citizen	i
that	c
enjoyed	c
the	c
last	c
International	c
Arts	c
Festival	c
.	c

But	c
"	i
All	i
in	i
one	i
ticket	c
"	c
was	c
a	c
good	c
idea	c
.	c

I	c
pressume	i
if	c
the	c
term	i
becomes	i
longer	i
the	c
festival	c
become	i
more	i
excellent	i
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

Because	c
the	c
purpose	c
of	c
school	c
rules	c
is	c
not	c
only	c
discipline	i
but	c
also	c
unify	i
.	c

Now	c
you	c
know	c
the	c
reason	c
!	c

They	c
are	c
for	c
teachers	c
'	i
!	c

Do	c
you	c
have	c
any	c
rules	c
at	c
school	c
that	c
make	c
you	c
upset	c
?	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c

We	c
think	c
that	c
Monday	c
and	c
Wednesday	c
are	c
good	c
,	c
but	c
we	c
ask	c
you	c
to	c
change	c
the	c
programme	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
dangerous	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
knew	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
.	c

Last	c
July	c
,	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
spend	c
two	c
weeks	c
with	c
my	c
best	c
in	i
a	c
beautiful	c
village	c
in	c
the	c
south	c
of	c
France	c
,	c
near	c
Saint-Tropez	c
.	c

To	c
make	c
matters	c
even	c
worse	c
,	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
without	c
any	c
information	c
given	i
about	c
the	c
reason	c
of	i
it	i
's	i
closure	c
.	c

Have	c
you	c
ever	c
thought	c
of	c
a	i
year	c
2100	c
?	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
if	c
the	c
weather	c
is	c
so	c
good	c
people	c
will	c
very	c
quickly	c
forget	c
about	c
any	c
winter	c
clothes	c
.	c

Dear	c
Jane	c
Clark	c
,	c

I	c
suggest	c
to	i
do	i
a	c
couple	c
more	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
already	c
know	c
I	c
go	c
to	c
an	c
English	c
school	c
,	c
Bear	c
House	c
,	c
in	c
Spain	c
.	c

As	i
well	i
you	i
are	i
n't	i
allowed	c
to	c
bring	c
drugs	c
or	c
arms	c
,	c
to	c
smoke	c
or	c
to	c
drink	c
alcohol	c
inside	c
the	c
school	c
.	c

As	c
well	c
have	i
the	c
responsability	i
to	i
look	i
after	c
my	c
brother	c
in	i
case	i
they	c
are	c
n't	c
at	c
home	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
in	c
advance	c
for	c
your	c
help	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

I	c
can	c
understand	c
why	c
you	c
are	c
impatient	c
to	c
hear	c
about	c
my	c
experience	c
at	c
the	c
concert	c
last	c
month	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
met	c
our	c
favourite	c
singer	c
,	c
Celine	c
Dion	c
!	c

Firstly	c
,	c
we	c
were	c
asked	c
to	c
clear	i
the	c
stadium	c
,	c
especially	c
the	c
seats	c
and	c
surroundings	c
.	c

And	c
she	c
dedicated	c
the	c
photograph	c
to	c
me	c
!	c

I	c
am	c
willing	c
to	c
show	c
you	c
the	c
authograph	i
and	c
the	c
photograph	c
.	c

During	c
my	c
stay	c
I	c
read	c
an	c
advertisement	c
of	i
a	c
musical	c
show	c
being	c
held	i
at	c
The	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
.	c

Even	i
though	i
I	c
was	c
still	c
excited	c
about	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
but	c
then	c
I	c
sudently	i
realise	i
that	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
is	i
not	c
performing	c
,	c
he	c
had	c
been	c
replaced	c
by	c
an	c
extremely	c
disappointing	c
actor	c
.	c

I	c
guess	c
science	c
is	c
about	c
solving	c
our	c
daily	c
problems	c
with	c
technological	c
advances	c
.	c

But	c
technology	c
is	c
not	c
just	c
about	c
studying	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
entertainment	c
too	c
!	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
technology	c
is	c
making	c
my	c
life	c
much	c
better	c
because	i
of	i
that	c
.	c

We	c
saw	c
an	c
advertisement	c
about	i
Fashion	i
And	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
.	c

The	c
show	c
can	i
be	i
seen	i
between	i
10.00	c
-	c
19.00	c
.	c

This	c
show	c
is	c
about	c
latest	i
fashions	c
,	c
leisure	c
and	c
sports	c
wear	c
,	c
make	i
up	i
and	c
Hairstyles	i
.	c

One	c
more	c
thing	c
about	c
show	i
is	c
,	i
it	i
's	c
free	c
for	c
students	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
know	c
,	c
there	c
is	c
a	i
free	c
time	c
in	c
your	c
programme	i
if	i
you	c
do	c
n't	c
mind	c
,	c
we	c
can	c
go	c
for	i
shopping	c
in	c
this	c
free	c
time	c
.	c

They	c
are	c
famous	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
think	c
they	c
need	c
to	c
be	c
alone	c
sometimes	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
the	i
one	c
I	c
saw	c
a	c
week	c
ago	c
in	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
was	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
worst	c
.	c

I	c
must	c
admit	c
I	c
'd	c
been	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
see	i
him	c
.	c

After	c
the	c
show	c
together	i
with	c
my	c
friends	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
romantic	c
supper	c
,	i
unfortunately	i
it	c
was	c
closed	c
without	i
any	i
sensible	i
reason	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
be	c
very	c
pleased	c
if	c
you	c
answered	c
my	c
request	c
soon	c
.	c

I	c
did	c
n't	c
wanted	i
to	c
spend	c
that	c
holiday	c
with	c
my	c
parents	c
in	c
the	c
country	c
.	c

We	c
planned	c
to	c
tell	c
them	c
that	c
we	c
were	c
going	c
for	i
a	c
summer	c
camp	c
in	c
the	c
mountains	c
where	c
we	c
would	c
practise	c
French	c
.	c

We	c
promised	c
to	c
keep	c
it	c
in	i
secret	c
.	c

Pat	c
started	c
to	c
cry	c
and	c
told	c
about	i
everything	c
.	c

As	c
a	c
result	c
we	c
were	c
grouded	i
for	c
all	c
holidays	i
and	c
all	c
because	c
our	i
almost	c
perfect	c
Pat	c
.	c

Another	c
important	c
thing	c
is	c
that	c
,	c
despite	c
the	c
number	c
and	c
quality	c
of	c
films	c
,	c
there	c
were	c
,	c
from	c
my	c
point	c
of	c
view	c
,	c
not	c
many	c
plays	c
.	c

One	c
possible	c
thing	c
is	c
to	c
display	c
in	i
a	i
public	i
place	i
what	i
you	i
can	i
do	i
best	i
,	c
and	c
,	c
then	c
,	c
"	c
sell	c
"	c
it	c
to	c
the	c
people	c
.	c

You	c
do	c
n't	c
need	c
to	c
be	c
a	c
Picasso	c
,	i
it	i
's	i
enough	i
with	i
a	i
bit	i
of	i
imagination	i
.	c

Please	c
could	c
you	c
informy	i
what	i
do	i
you	c
meen	i
when	c
do	i
you	c
said	i
all	c
the	c
accommodotion	i
are	i
paid	c
for	c
,	i
that	i
is	i
including	c
foods	i
and	c
drinks	c
,	c
so	c
I	i
know	c
how	c
mutch	i
money	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
take	i
with	c
me	c
,	c
and	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
wather	i
it	i
's	i
during	c
this	c
period	c
of	c
the	c
year	c
so	c
I	i
know	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
.	c

Dec.	c
16th	c
,	c
2000	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
great	c
idea	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
think	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
make	c
some	c
points	c
about	c
the	c
things	c
that	c
I	c
found	c
unsatisfactory	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
disappointed	c
that	c
the	c
artists	c
invited	c
were	c
from	c
only	c
six	c
countries	c
.	c

Thirdly	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
more	c
plays	c
and	c
films	c
should	c
be	c
shown	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

Dec	c
16th	c
,	c
2000	c

But	c
apart	c
from	c
this	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
most	c
rules	c
of	c
the	c
school	c
are	c
quite	c
reasonable	c
,	c
like	c
addressing	c
to	i
the	c
teacher	c
using	c
the	c
second	c
plural	i
person	i
(	c
it	c
is	c
different	c
in	c
Turkish	c
)	c
or	c
standing	c
up	c
when	c
s/he	c
enters	c
the	c
class	c
.	c

As	c
we	c
are	c
a	c
developing	c
country	c
,	c
teachers	c
are	c
quite	c
respected	c
.	c

But	c
we	c
are	c
legally	c
allowed	c
to	c
play	c
instruments	c
like	c
the	c
piano	c
until	c
10	c
p.m	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
the	c
lovely	i
programme	c
you	c
organised	i
for	c
our	c
trip	c
to	c
London	c
,	c
especially	c
because	c
we	c
will	c
have	c
both	c
cultural	c
trips	c
and	c
entertainments	i
,	c
like	c
shopping	c
.	c

We	c
all	i
would	i
like	c
to	c
go	c
and	c
see	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
which	c
will	c
take	c
place	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
14th	c
March	c
,	c
from	c
10.00	c
to	c
19.00	c
,	c
in	c
the	i
London	c
's	c
Central	c
exhibition	i
Hall	c
.	c

This	c
show	c
is	c
about	c
the	c
latest	c
fashions	c
,	c
the	i
leisure	c
and	c
sports	c
wear	c
,	c
the	i
make-up	c
and	c
the	i
hairstyles	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
this	c
show	c
wo	c
n't	c
cost	c
anything	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
free	c
for	c
the	i
students	c
!	c

Consequently	c
,	c
I	c
proposed	i
to	i
change	i
the	c
programme	c
as	c
follows	c
;	i
on	c
Tuesday	c
afternoon	c
,	c
instead	c
of	c
shopping	c
,	c
we	c
could	c
go	c
to	c
this	c
show	c
and	c
we	c
could	c
go	c
shopping	c
on	c
Wednesday	c
afternoon	c
,	c
during	c
our	c
free	c
time	c
.	c

What	c
do	c
you	c
think	c
about	c
that	c
?	c

Moreover	c
,	c
especially	c
for	i
film	c
stars	c
,	c
lots	c
of	c
people	c
are	c
hoping	c
to	c
see	c
them	c
on	c
the	c
Tv	i
or	c
in	c
the	c
newspapers	c
,	c
and	c
this	c
is	c
really	c
good	c
for	c
their	c
fame	i
.	c

However	c
,	c
on	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
it	c
must	c
be	c
so	c
annoying	c
to	c
be	c
followed	c
by	c
journalists	c
or	c
photographs	i
all	c
the	c
time	c
.	c

You	c
ca	c
n't	c
go	c
outside	c
quietly	i
,	c
and	c
there	c
is	c
all	i
the	i
time	i
a	c
crownd	i
of	c
people	c
who	c
stands	i
in	c
front	c
of	c
your	c
house	c
waiting	c
for	c
you	c
.	c

That	c
is	c
why	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
famous	c
people	c
deserve	c
a	c
private	c
life	c
,	c
like	c
everybody	c
,	i
and	c
that	c
journalists	c
should	c
not	c
follow	c
them	c
everywhere	c
.	c

Yours	c
Faithfully	i
,	c

After	c
that	c
journalist	i
sell	c
their	c
information	c
in	i
the	c
newspaper	i
and	c
magazines	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
earn	c
money	c
.	c

I	c
thin	i
that	c
it	c
is	c
very	c
dangerous	c
because	c
the	c
famous	c
peple	i
cannot	c
have	c
you	i
private	c
life	c
and	c
on	i
the	i
other	i
hand	i
they	c
may	c
suffer	c
from	c
deppresion	i
and	c
sadness	i
which	i
may	c
be	i
lead	c
them	c
to	c
suicide	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
the	c
goverment	i
have	c
to	c
protect	c
them	c
and	c
their	c
private	c
life	c
from	c
the	c
journalist	i
,	c
punishing	i
them	i
.	c

June	c
17th	c
,	c
2000	c

The	c
new	c
actor	c
was	c
not	c
as	c
good	c
as	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
and	c
he	c
did	c
not	c
perform	c
the	i
show	c
as	c
he	c
should	c
have	c
done	c
.	c

In	c
conclussion	i
,	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
technology	c
has	c
two	c
faces	c
which	c
affects	i
my	c
life	c
as	c
well	c
as	c
everybody	c
else	c
's	c
life	c
.	c

I	c
believe	c
that	c
we	c
should	c
try	c
to	c
change	c
this	i
bad	c
aspects	c
,	c
or	c
learn	c
to	c
live	c
with	c
them	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
my	c
horrible	c
evening	c
at	c
The	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
on	c
10th	c
June	c
2000	c
.	c

During	c
the	c
show	c
I	c
was	i
expected	i
to	c
meet	i
Danny	c
Brook	c
who	i
is	c
my	c
favourite	c
actor	c
and	i
Tina	c
Truelove	c
.	c

Finally	c
I	i
would	c
like	c
to	c
have	c
refund	i
for	c
my	c
ticket	c
back	i
because	c
it	c
was	c
horrible	i
evening	c
.	c

The	c
sun	c
was	c
shining	c
and	c
wind	i
were	i
breezing	i
like	c
we	c
had	c
imaged	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
on	i
July	c
;	c
that	c
is	c
for	c
me	c
the	c
only	c
possibility	c
because	c
I	c
will	c
finish	c
my	c
course	c
a	i
University	i
at	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
June	c
and	c
I	c
will	c
start	c
to	c
work	c
in	c
September	c
.	c

I	c
like	c
to	c
travel	i
with	i
light	i
logguage	i
and	c
I	c
have	c
no	c
idea	c
about	c
the	c
weather	c
;	c
could	c
you	c
suggest	c
me	i
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
have	i
to	i
bring	i
with	c
me	c
?	c

Yours	c
Sincerely	i

It	c
's	c
great	c
to	c
hearing	i
from	c
you	c
!	c

I	c
did	c
it	c
for	c
free	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
non-profit	c
concert	c
for	i
helping	i
the	c
poor	c
people	c
.	c

For	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
I	c
wish	i
I	i
came	i
to	c
Camp	c
California	c
,	c
and	c
now	c
my	c
dream	c
is	c
about	c
to	c
become	i
true	c
.	c

In	c
a	c
few	c
months	c
,	c
when	c
they	c
are	c
famous	c
,	c
I	c
could	c
say	c
:	c
"	c
You	c
know	c
.	i

Because	c
I	c
'm	c
working	c
in	c
an	c
accountant	i
office	c
,	c
I	c
'm	c
very	c
busy	c
.	c

And	c
in	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
when	c
you	c
live	i
in	c
a	c
tent	c
,	c
you	c
have	i
more	i
from	i
the	i
nature	i
and	i
the	i
adventure	i
.	c

I	c
used	i
to	i
be	i
a	c
member	c
in	i
a	c
swimming	c
club	c
for	c
about	c
10	c
years	c
.	c

Additionally	c
I	c
'm	c
keen	c
on	c
taking	c
pictures	c
.	c

But	c
until	i
now	i
I	c
only	i
took	i
pictures	c
on	c
holidays	i
and	c
some	i
family	c
celabrations	i
.	c

And	c
also	c
if	c
the	c
weather	c
will	c
be	c
good	c
at	c
this	c
time	c
.	i

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

I	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
very	c
often	c
,	c
to	c
look	c
around	c
and	c
to	c
buy	c
some	c
new	c
clothes	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
a	c
student	c
of	i
the	c
English	c
class	c

All	c
my	c
class	i
mates	i
are	c
looking	c

to	c
go	i
to	c
London	c

The	c

is	c
taking	c
place	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
14	c
March	c
from	c
10am	c
to	c
7pm	c

I	c
hope	c
I	c
will	c
hear	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c

Sincerely	c
,	c

Although	c
I	c
intended	c
to	c
stay	c
at	c
youth	i
hostel	c
,	c
I	c
could	c
not	c
find	c
any	c
place	c
to	c
stay	c
,	c
and	c
also	c
it	c
was	c
too	c
late	c
to	c
buy	c
a	c
train	c
ticket	c
to	c
go	c
back	c
home	c
.	c

Inside	c
the	c
dark	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
alone	c
and	c
only	c
the	c
moon	i
light	i
helped	c
me	c
to	c
see	c
the	i
things	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
like	c
a	c
dream	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
advertisement	c
,	c
it	c
was	i
written	i
that	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
London	c
's	c
newest	c
and	c
best	c
musical	c
show	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
terrible	c
evening	c
out	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	i
,	c

Modern	c
technology	c
has	c
changed	c
our	c
daily	c
life	c
a	c
lot	c
.	c

Modern	c
technology	c
is	c
very	c
important	c
for	c
all	c
the	c
countries	c
.	c

When	c
you	c
look	c
around	c
,	c
you	c
can	c
easily	c
understand	c
that	c
modern	c
technology	c
is	c
used	c
in	i
everything	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
this	c
festival	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
idea	c
to	i
enjoy	c
arts	c
from	c
around	c
the	c
world	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
also	c
have	c
some	c
complaints	c
.	c

The	c
special	c
tickets	c
were	c
excellent	c
because	c
we	c
could	c
enjoy	c
arts	i
without	c
worrying	c
about	c
money	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
no	c
doubt	c
that	c
you	c
will	c
succeed	c
in	i
next	c
year	c
's	c
festival	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
in	c
a	i
daytime	c
,	c
we	c
can	c
focus	c
in	i
our	c
studyings	i
.	c

As	c
you	c
see	c
,	c
teaching	c
is	c
a	i
hard	c
work	c
in	c
some	c
respect	i
.	c

But	c
I	c
am	c
enjoying	c
it	c
and	c
getting	c
a	c
lot	c
out	c
of	c
it	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
,	c

This	c
will	c
be	c
very	c
enriching	c
for	c
us	c
!	c

This	c
will	c
take	c
place	c
in	c
the	c
Central	c
Exhibition	c
Hall	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
14th	c
March	c
.	c

Anyway	c
,	c
we	c
were	c
to	i
go	i
shopping	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
afternoon	c
so	c
that	c
wo	c
n't	c
be	c
a	c
problem	c
to	c
my	c
mind	c
!	c

Someone	c
had	c
to	c
react	c
.	c

.	c
.	c

I	c
tiptoed	c
as	c
far	c
as	c
the	c
house	c
,	c
carefully	c
opened	c
the	c
door	c
,	c
and	c
headed	c
to	c
George	c
.	c

This	c
is	c
excellent	i
idea	c
because	c
during	c
the	c
week	c
people	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
too	c
much	c
time	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
festival	c
.	c

In	c
your	c
letter	c
you	c
ask	c
me	c
about	c
rules	i
in	i
school	i
and	i
home	i
I	i
have	i
.	c

I	c
like	c
clean	i
my	c
home	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
like	c
when	i
there	i
is	c
clean	c
and	c
fresh	c
.	c

That	c
's	c
all	c
,	i
I	c
hope	c
that	c
I	c
give	i
you	c
answers	c
for	c
all	c
questions	i
you	c
have	i
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Helen	i
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
had	c
always	c
dreamt	c
of	c
being	c
near	c
"	c
The	c
Cranberies	c
"	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
had	c
never	c
thought	c
that	c
the	c
dream	c
could	c
became	i
reallity	i
.	c

After	c
a	c
few	c
minutes	c
the	c
dream	c
happened	c
:	c
Kare	c
-	c
the	c
guitarrist	i
-	c
appeared	c
over	c
there	c
.	c

At	c
first	c
we	c
both	c
thought	c
we	c
were	c
dreaming	c
but	c
when	c
we	c
realised	c
it	c
was	c
true	c
we	c
went	c
there	c
and	c
ask	i
him	c
some	c
questions	c
.	c

And	c
then	c
we	c
bring	i
his	c
guitar	c
for	c
him	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
great	c
to	c
help	c
him	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
July	c
would	c
suit	c
me	c
best	c
.	c

From	c
my	c
part	i
,	c
I	c
would	c
just	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
what	c
sort	c
of	c
clothes	c
should	i
I	i
bring	c
with	c
me	c
and	c
also	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
.	c

Thanking	c
you	c
in	c
advance	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
your	c
prompt	c
respons	i
to	c
my	c
enquiries	i

It	i
lasted	c
three	c
days	c
and	c
I	i
've	i
had	i
the	c
best	c
fun	c
of	c
my	c
life	c
.	c

Lots	c
of	c
love	c

Finally	c
,	c
if	c
I	c
have	c
any	c
chance	c
to	c
choose	c
activities	c
,	c
I	c
will	c
choose	c
Basket	i
ball	i
and	c
Sailing	c
with	c
no	c
doubt	c
because	c
I	c
would	c
love	c
to	c
make	c
friends	c
from	i
these	c
kinds	c
of	c
sports	c
.	c

KANG	c

17th	c
Jun	c
2000	c

Dear	i
Sir	i
and	i
Madam	i

I	c
bought	c
group	i
ticket	c
for	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

Because	c
we	i
were	i
7	i
people	i
.	c

Becouse	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
see	c
this	c
show	c
.	c

We	c
waited	i
to	i
start	i
the	i
show	i
about	i
one	c
hour	c
and	c
fourty-five	i
minutes	c
.	c

An	i
other	i
one	c
played	i
in	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

After	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
w	i
were	c
still	c
angry	c
,	i
we	i
wanted	c
to	c
eat	c
something	c
in	c
your	c
theater	i
restaurant	c
.	c

We	c
were	c
bored	c
to	i
waiting	c
.	c

When	c
you	c
do	c
something	c
,	c
I	c
went	i
to	c
see	c
your	c
new	c
shows	c
.	c

When	c
we	c
had	c
a	c
computer	c
,	c
I	c
started	c
to	c
play	c
computer	c
games	c
.	c

Becouse	c
I	c
can	c
read	c
my	c
newspaper	c
in	i
the	c
internet	i
.	c

I	c
can	c
send	c
a	i
mail	i
to	c
my	c
friend	c
who	c
lives	c
in	c
Canada	c
.	c

Becouse	c
I	c
have	c
got	c
a	c
data-bank	c
.	c

When	c
the	c
important	c
day	c
is	c
coming	i
,	c
it	c
says	i
to	i
me	c
.	c

I	c
felt	c
very	c
upset	c
and	c
my	c
enjoyable	c
night	c
became	c
a	c
stressed	i
and	i
very	c
expensive	c
one	c
,	c
too	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
we	c
can	c
feel	c
more	c
comfortable	c
with	c
them	c
providing	c
us	c
support	i
to	i
our	c
hard	c
tasks	c
and	c
letting	i
us	c
free	c
to	c
apply	c
our	c
attention	i
and	c
efforts	c
to	c
more	c
important	c
things	c
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
we	c
are	c
able	c
to	c
feel	c
or	c
to	c
recognize	c
the	c
benefits	c
of	c
the	c
modern	c
technologies	c
but	c
we	c
should	c
be	c
aware	c
about	i
how	c
they	c
are	c
introduced	c
in	i
our	c
lives	c
to	c
avoid	c
the	c
dangerous	c
side	c
of	c
the	i
TECHNOLOGY	c
.	c

And	c
the	c
worst	c
was	i
that	c
he	c
was	c
n't	c
so	c
good	c
in	c
his	i
role	c
!	c

The	c
people	c
who	c
were	c
there	c
to	c
watch	c
the	c
show	c
were	c
very	c
ungry	i
and	c
they	c
were	c
shouting	c
because	c
they	c
were	i
waiting	i
for	i
too	c
long	c
,	i
And	c
I	c
absolutely	c
agree	i
with	c
them	c
.	c

But	c
when	c
I	c
went	c
there	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

After	c
a	c
while	c
the	i
bell	c
rang	c
.	c

So	c
her	c
friends	c
did	c
n't	c
understand	i
that	c
she	c
knew	c
about	c
the	c
party	c
and	c
they	c
were	c
very	c
happy	c
because	c
they	c
believed	c
that	c
the	c
suprise	i
party	c
had	c
succeed	i
!	c

Then	c
,	c
they	i
were	c
not	c
any	c
discounts	c
available	c
for	c
the	c
tickets	c
as	c
it	i
was	c
written	c
on	c
the	c
advertisement	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
sorry	c
but	c
this	c
was	c
n't	c
my	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
for	c
some	i
refund	c
because	c
the	c
whole	c
evening	c
was	c
very	c
disappointing	c
and	c
it	c
did	i
not	c
worth	c
the	c
money	c
given	i

The	c
most	c
exciting	c
about	i
this	c
is	c
that	c
people	c
wo	c
n't	c
think	c
that	c
their	c
clothes	c
are	c
strange	c
as	i
we	c
do	c
n't	c
think	c
about	i
ours	c
.	i

Your	i
faithfully	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
,	c
every	c
time	c
I	c
tell	i
something	i
to	i
her	i
,	c
finally	i
everyone	c
knew	i
about	c
it	c
.	c

But	c
this	c
time	c
it	c
was	c
something	c
more	c
important	c
that	i
any	c
other	c
time	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
in	c
love	c
with	c
a	c
friend	c
's	c
boyfriend	c
and	c
we	c
were	c
about	c
to	c
have	c
an	c
affair	c
,	c
but	c
when	c
I	c
made	c
the	c
big	c
mistake	c
of	c
telling	c
me	i
little	c
and	c
terrible	c
secret	c
to	c
Pat	c
,	c
everithing	i
started	c
going	c
wrong	c
,	i
Katrin	c
my	i
friend	c
,	c
and	c
the	c
one	c
I	c
was	c
being	c
bad	c
with	i
,	c
was	c
very	c
upset	c
with	c
me	c
,	c
and	c
she	c
was	c
right	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
really	c
do	i
n't	i
know	c
what	c
to	c
do	c
,	i
I	c
was	c
in	c
love	c
with	c
Brett	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
love	i
my	c
friend	c
too	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
difficult	c
,	c
but	c
I	i
was	c
the	c
best	c
for	c
everyone	c
.	c

Then	c
I	c
decide	c
to	c
talk	c
to	c
Katrin	c
,	i
I	c
was	c
very	c
sory	i
of	i
all	c
I	c
have	i
do	i
,	c
so	c
I	c
apologize	i
with	i
her	c
and	c
promise	i
her	c
that	c
this	c
will	i
never	i
would	i
happen	c
again	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
receiving	c
you	i
reply	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possibly	i
.	c

How	c
has	c
modern	c
technology	c
changed	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
.	i

A	c
century	c
ago	c
,	c
when	c
a	c
farmer	c
took	c
the	c
horses	c
out	c
of	c
the	c
stable	c
and	c
put	c
the	c
plouge	i
behind	c
them	c
,	c
we	i
've	i
got	i
the	c
word	c
"	c
time	c
"	c
.	c

Another	c
thing	c
was	c
the	c
confirmed	i
hour	i
of	c
the	c
show	c
which	i
it	c
started	c
forty-five	c
minutes	c
later	i
without	c
any	c
factual	i
reason	c
.	i

In	c
addition	c
to	c
all	c
this	c
,	c
there	c
was	c
no	c
discount	c
in	i
the	c
price	c
of	c
the	c
tickets	c
,	i
for	c
students	c
either	c
,	c
contrary	c
to	c
what	c
I	c
was	c
told	c
by	i
phone	i
when	c
I	c
asked	c
for	c
more	c
information	c
.	c

"	c
How	c
has	c
modern	c
technology	c
changed	c
your	c
daily	c
life	c
?	c
"	c

And	c
the	c
restorant	i
of	i
the	i
theatre	i
was	c
being	c
pait	i
,	c
so	c
I	c
could	c
not	c
go	c
as	i
you	i
said	i
in	i
the	i
advertisment	i
.	c

Tecnology	i
,	c
are	c
we	c
prepeared	i
for	c
those	i
advances	c
?	c

Definitly	i
we	c
should	c
try	c
to	c
understand	c
tecnology	i
,	i
if	i
we	c
know	c
how	c
to	c
use	c
it	c
,	c
tecnology	i
will	c
improve	c
our	c
way	c
of	c
life	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
,	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
make	c
a	c
suggestion	c
about	c
the	c
trip	c
on	c
behalf	c
of	c
all	c
the	c
students	c
in	c
my	c
class	c
.	c

According	c
to	c
the	c
advertisement	c
I	c
have	c
seen	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
supposed	c
to	c
show	c
the	c
latest	c
fashions	c
,	c
leisure	i
and	i
sports	i
wear	i
,	c
make	i
up	i
and	c
hairstyles	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
they	c
mix	c
them	c
up	c
and	c
that	c
they	c
should	c
think	c
about	c
the	c
right	c
of	i
privacy	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
at	c
a	c
quarter	c
past	c
eight	c
,	c
forty-five	c
minutes	c
later	c
than	c
it	c
might	i
have	c
been	i
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

By	i
the	i
time	i
,	c
Pat	c
and	c
me	i
had	c
a	c
close	c
relationship	c
.	c

We	c
had	c
many	c
points	i
in	c
common	c
and	c
we	c
knew	c
each	c
other	c
as	c
if	c
we	c
were	c
sisters	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
glad	c
to	c
receive	c
this	c
great	c
notice	i
.	c

If	c
it	c
is	c
no	i
problem	c
I	c
would	c
rather	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
lab	i
cabin	c
because	c
I	c
do	c
not	c
like	c
much	i
sleeping	i
on	i
the	i
floor	i
,	c
but	c
if	c
you	c
can	i
not	i
put	c
me	c
there	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
fine	c
anywhere	c
.	c

But	c
all	c
this	c
power	c
and	c
all	c
this	c
excitement	c
could	c
turn	c
into	c
something	c
that	c
you	c
could	c
start	c
to	c
hate	c
.	c

When	c
you	c
go	c
shopping	c
and	c
there	c
are	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
people	c
in	c
the	c
same	c
place	c
,	c
all	c
trying	c
to	c
find	c
the	c
best	c
prices	c
and	c
not	c
carying	i
about	c
anybody	c
,	c
this	c
could	c
get	i
crazy	i
to	i
anyone	i
.	c

And	c
also	c
I	c
like	c
to	c
camp	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
,	c
because	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
more	c
interesting	c
than	c
log	c
cabins	c
.	c

Taking	c
a	i
photography	i
during	c
the	c
holiday	c
is	c
very	i
good	c
memory	c
for	c
me	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
can	c
share	c
my	c
adventures	c
to	i
my	c
friends	c
.	c

Fresh-air	i
,	i
flowers	i
and	i
meeting	i
some	i
interesting	i
people	i
while	i
you	i
are	i
climbing	i
you	i
have	i
.	c

Shopping	c
sounds	c
very	c
enjobleable	i
and	c
fantastic	i
for	c
women	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
are	c
going	c
shopping	c
someone	c
can	c
easily	c
steal	c
your	c
wallet	c
which	i
you	c
are	c
looking	c
at	c
some	c
interesting	c
things	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
prefer	c
cabins	c
.	c

They	c
are	c
also	c
the	c
lessons	c
which	c
English	c
and	i
other	c
foreigners	c
are	c
particularlly	i
curious	c
in	i
.	c

This	c
is	c
a	c
good	c
oppertunate	i
to	c
see	c
how	c
they	c
learn	c
in	c
class	c
.	c

That	c
will	c
make	i
it	i
defenitely	i
a	c
successful	c
video	c
.	c

In	i
fact	i
it	c
was	c
quite	c
different	c
from	c
the	c
one	c
I	c
had	c
expected	c
to	c
see	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
was	c
n't	c
the	c
leading	c
actor	c
,	c
though	c
his	c
name	c
was	c
printed	c
on	c
the	c
brochure	i
.	c

I	c
was	c
angry	c
because	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
instead	c
of	c
19.30	c
,	c
too	c
.	c

If	c
I	c
were	c
you	c
,	c
I	c
should	c
keep	c
open	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
heard	c
people	c
saying	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
pity	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
Internet	i
has	c
changed	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
most	c
of	c
all	c
.	c

In	c
fact	c
,	c
now	c
I	c
can	c
write	c
to	c
friends	c
who	c
live	c
in	c
foreign	c
countries	c
,	c
for	c
exemple	i
in	i
the	c
morning	c
and	c
receive	c
back	i
their	c
answer	c
in	c
the	c
evening	c
or	c
even	c
just	c
a	c
minute	c
after	c
writing	c
.	c

I	c
can	c
say	c
such	c
things	c
because	c
I	c
use	c
the	c
net	c
in	c
the	c
same	c
way	c
and	c
I	c
'm	c
really	c
astounded	c
by	c
its	i
way	c
of	i
changing	i
my	c
daily	c
life	c
.	c

13th	c
JUNE	c
2000	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
breeze	c
to	c
help	c
them	c
and	c
was	c
very	c
cool	c
as	c
well	c
,	i
those	c
guys	c
really	c
know	c
how	c
to	c
play	c
rock	c
.	c

See	c
yah	c
mate	c

I	c
play	c
very	i
well	i
tennis	i
since	c
I	c
have	c
played	c
it	c
since	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
child	c
but	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
novice	c
in	i
photography	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
try	c
it	c
as	c
I	c
have	c
always	c
been	c
interested	c
in	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
a	c
few	c
questions	c
:	c

Sometimes	c
the	c
seller	i
might	c
even	c
ignore	c
you	c
as	c
he	c
or	c
she	c
is	c
talking	c
to	c
another	c
sellor	i
.	c

It	c
was	c
not	c
available	i
but	c
the	c
worst	c
thing	c
was	c
that	c
nobody	c
explained	i
us	i
the	i
reason	i
.	c

It	c
was	c
our	c
last	c
school	c
year	c
,	c
so	c
we	c
decided	c
to	c
organize	c
a	c
trip	c
to	c
celebrate	c
we	i
had	c
finally	c
finished	c
it	i
.	c

It	c
seemed	c
the	i
perfect	c
holiday	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
.	c

Jon	c
told	c
my	c
parents	c
what	c
we	c
wanted	c
to	c
do	c
.	c

Helen	c
Ryan	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
choosing	c
me	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
for	c
first	c
prize	c
.	c

For	c
accommodation	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
I	c
prefer	c
tents	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
use	i
to	c
go	i
tents	i
holidays	i
,	i
I	c
like	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
good	c
in	i
swimming	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
not	c
so	c
good	c
in	i
tennis	c
but	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
play	c
it	c
for	i
practise	i
.	c

I	c
hate	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
never	i
liked	i
shopping	c
.	c

It	c
always	i
was	i
trouble	i
for	c
me	c
.	c

Dear	c
Madam	i
Ryan	c
,	c

At	c
the	c
Camp	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
live	i
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
what	c
sort	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
(	c
if	c
it	c
is	c
going	c
to	c
rainy	i
or	c
to	i
be	i
sunny	c
)	c
and	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
must	c
have	c
with	c
me	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
very	c
interresting	i
,	c
because	c
I	c
did	c
different	c
things	c
.	c

I	c
took	c
some	c
photographies	i
and	c
I	c
'll	c
show	c
them	c
to	c
you	c
when	c
you	c
come	c
next	c
week	c

See	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
this	c
letter	c
so	c
as	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
the	c
information	c
which	c
will	c
help	c
you	c
organize	i
all	c
the	c
necessary	c
details	c
of	c
the	c
forthcoming	c
holiday	c
.	c

As	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
interested	c
in	c
photography	c
and	c
swimming	c
I	c
am	c
hoping	c
to	c
take	c
part	c
in	c
them	i
.	c

However	c
this	i
term	c
has	c
been	c
a	c
far	c
cry	c
from	c
the	c
others	c
.	c

You	c
will	c
see	c
why	c
I	c
'm	c
describing	c
it	c
as	c
the	c
most	c
unforgettible	i
one	c
when	c
you	c
read	c
through	c
my	c
letter	c
.	c

She	c
invited	c
me	c
to	c
the	c
rehearsal	c
of	c
a	c
huge	c
consert	i
whose	i
singer	c
was	i
a	c
well-known	c
pop	c
star	c
as	c
well	c
as	c
my	c
favorite	i
.	c

I	c
helped	c
out	c
my	c
friend	c
by	c
writing	c
huge	c
billboards	c
and	c
making	c
some	c
light	c
refreshments	c
.	c

Dear	c
director	c
of	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theater	i
!	c

The	c
first	c
thing	c
that	c
happen	i
was	c
that	c
the	c
show	c
did	c
n't	c
start	c
on	c
time	c
.	c

When	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
was	c
not	c
acting	c
,	c
witch	i
was	c
a	c
great	c
dissapointment	i
for	c
us	c
both	c
.	c

But	c
we	c
used	c
to	c
call	c
it	c
'	c
Our	c
House	c
'	c
.	c

Useally	i
we	c
were	c
cooking	c
flower-soup	i
,	c
and	c
talking	i
secrets	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
the	c
cast	c
,	c
which	c
you	c
"	c
offered	i
"	c
has	i
been	c
changed	c
.	c

Nevertheless	c
it	i
has	c
some	c
advantages	c
and	c
drawbacks	c
.	c

Every	c
morning	c
I	c
use	c
a	c
toaster	c
to	c
have	c
my	c
sandwiches	c
done	c
,	c
washing	i
machine	c
which	c
makes	c
my	c
clothes	c
clean	c
again	c
.	c

Dear	c
Helene	c
Ryan	c
,	c

If	c
these	c
people	c
have	c
a	i
family	i
with	i
children	c
,	c
they	c
must	c
buy	c
some	c
food	c
to	c
feed	c
them	c
even	c
if	c
a	i
supermarket	c
is	c
full	c
of	c
people	c
.	c

And	c
now	c
for	c
them	c
shopping	c
can	c
be	c
considerated	i
like	i
a	i
contrariety	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
with	c
regard	c
to	c
your	c
advertisment	i
.	c

The	c
worst	c
thing	c
is	c
that	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
watch	i
my	c
favorite	i
actor	c
.	c

Contrary	i
to	i
the	c
advertisment	i
everything	c
was	c
disapointing	i
.	c

Technology	c
has	c
developed	c
increasingly	i
in	c
recent	c
years	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
one	c
hand	c
technology	c
has	c
made	c
our	c
lives	c
more	c
comfortable	c
and	c
easier	c
.	c

which	c
were	c
unusuall	i
before	i
.	c

Technology	c
has	c
a	c
huge	c
effect	c
on	c
our	c
spare	i
time	i
activities	c
as	c
well	c
.	c

Children	c
play	c
wit	i
computer	i
instead	c
of	c
usuall	i
plays	i
.	c

The	c
programme	c
you	c
suggest	c
is	c
versatile	c
and	c
full	c
of	c
interesting	c
activities	c
.	c

But	c
we	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
make	c
our	i
suggestion	c
,	c
if	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
mind	c
.	c

Our	c
students	c
will	c
have	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
of	i
seeing	i
the	c
latest	c
fashion	i
,	c
as	c
this	c
unique	c
show	c
is	c
held	c
only	c
once	c
a	c
year	c
.	c

What	c
's	c
more	c
,	c
new	c
hairstyles	c
and	c
leisure	c
and	c
sports	c
wear	c
are	c
presented	c
there	c
.	c

But	c
such	c
an	c
attitude	c
is	c
wrong	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
quite	c
obvious	c
,	i
that	c
celebreties	i
ca	c
n't	c
lead	c
a	c
normal	c
life	c
,	c
as	c
they	c
are	c
constantly	c
followed	c
by	c
reporters	c
,	c
what	i
makes	c
their	c
life	c
miserable	c
.	c

The	c
first	c
point	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
make	c
is	c
that	c
a	i
private	c
life	c
of	c
a	c
celebrity	c
is	c
open	c
to	c
public	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
stress	c
that	c
very	c
often	c
famous	c
people	c
become	c
reserved	c
,	c
bad-tempered	c
and	c
angry	c
with	c
the	c
world	c
for	c
interfering	c
into	i
their	c
lives	c
.	c

Last	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
it	c
said	i
in	c
your	c
advertisement	c
that	c
there	c
is	c
a	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
after	i
the	c
show	c
but	c
it	c
turned	c
out	c
to	c
be	c
closed	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
redecorating	i
and	c
no	c
annocement	i
was	c
made	c
.	c

Therefore	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
are	i
refund	i
of	i
my	i
ticket	i
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
a	i
apolygists	i
.	c

From	i
my	i
point	i
of	i
view	i
,	c
I	c
think	c
people	c
will	c
wear	c
more	c
clothes	c
that	c
are	c
see-through	c
in	c
particular	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
come	c
in	c
july	i
because	c
I	c
work	c
in	i
a	c
big	c
company	c
where	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
your	c
holiday	c
in	c
this	i
month	c
.	c

See	c
you	c
soon	c

I	c
'm	c
very	c
glad	c
about	c
that	c
and	c
I	c
also	c
want	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
a	c
few	c
questions	c
.	c

About	c
the	c
accommodation	c
,	c
I	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
tents	c
.	c

I	c
love	c
to	c
take	c
photos	c
but	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
techinique	i
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

It	c
's	c
good	c
to	c
walk	c
around	c
looking	c
all	i
the	c
news	i
in	c
the	c
stores	c
.	c

It	c
can	c
stress	c
you	c
.	c

When	c
you	c
ca	c
n't	c
find	c
what	c
you	c
are	c
looking	c
for	c
anywhere	c
.	c

And	c
,	c
a	c
really	c
bad	c
thing	c
is	c
,	c
after	c
buying	c
everything	c
you	c
wanted	c
and	c
feeling	c
very	c
happy	c
with	c
all	c
that	c
,	c
you	c
realize	c
that	c
you	c
spent	c
more	c
money	c
than	c
you	c
should	c
.	i

.	c
.	c

It	c
would	c
probably	c
be	c
better	c
if	c
you	c
just	c
go	i
shopping	c
when	c
you	c
really	c
need	i
and	c
,	c
to	c
relax	c
,	c
you	c
can	c
talk	c
to	c
a	c
friend	c
,	c
read	c
a	c
book	c
or	c
listen	c
to	c
good	c
music	c

I	c

a	i
planty	i
of	c
experience	c
and	c
knowledge	c
of	c
both	c
aspect	i
of	i
part	i

I	c
really	c
recomend	i
you	c
to	c
help	c
them	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
this	c
is	c
a	c
good	c
oppotunity	i
and	c
I	c
want	c
you	c
understand	i
my	c
feeling	c
well	c

I	c
want	c
to	c

Your	c
programme	c
looks	c
very	c
interesting	c
,	c
especially	c
the	c
River	c
Trip	c
to	c
Greenwich	c
,	c
which	c
I	c
always	i
dreamt	i
of	c

However	c
,	c
we	c
have	c
seen	c
an	c
advertisement	c
on	i
the	i
English	c
magazine	c
for	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c

Our	c
suggestion	c
is	c
that	c
we	c
can	c
go	c
shopping	c
on	c
Wednesday	c
15	c
March	c
so	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
afternoon	c
we	c
can	c
go	c
to	c
The	c
London	c
Fashion	c

We	c
wo	c
n't	c
miss	c
any	c
programme	i
that	c
you	c
have	c
planned	c
and	c
we	c
could	c
also	c
have	c
great	i
opportunity	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
show	c

Yours	c
faithfully	i

The	i
politicians	i
and	c
film	c
stars	c
also	c
want	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
normal	c
life	c
after	c
work	c

They	c
want	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
private	c
life	c
without	c
journalists	c
following	c
them	c
all	c
the	c
time	c

They	c
deserve	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
private	c
life	c
as	i
everybody	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

The	c
last	c
disappointing	c
thing	c
is	c
that	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
so	c
we	c
could	c
not	c
visit	c
it	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

My	i
address	i
is	i
here	i
for	i
any	i
contacts	i
,	i

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
she	c
did	c
n't	c
know	c
that	c
Pat	c
could	c
n't	c
keep	c
secrets	c
well	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
she	c
could	c
n't	c
wait	c
and	c
wear	i
to	c
talk	c
to	c
Pat	c
.	c

However	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
see	c
him	c
all	c
the	i
night	c
.	c

And	c
also	c
it	c
should	c
be	i
started	c
at	c
19.30	c
,	c
as	c
I	c
saw	c
in	c
the	c
advirtisement	i
,	c
which	i
has	i
started	i
at	c
20.15	c

You	c
should	c
have	c
written	c
it	c
in	c
the	c
advirtisement	i

I	c
hope	c
you	c
understand	c
me	i
and	c
correct	i
your	c
mistakes	c
in	c
the	c
next	c
advirtisement	i
and	c
send	c
me	c
my	c
money	c
soon	c

I	c
play	c

more	c
than	c
watching	c

when	c
I	c
get	c
bored	c

The	c

He	c
went	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
headmaster	c
and	c
told	c
him	c
all	i
the	i
truth	c

Tim	c

the	c
one	c
who	c
threw	c
the	c
paper	c

to	i
the	c

Jon	c
was	c
the	c
one	c
who	c
said	c
some	c
bad	c
words	c
behind	c
the	c
headmaster	i
after	i
he	c
punished	c
Jon	c
.	c

The	c
headmaster	c
was	c
extremely	c
angry	c
about	c
it	c
and	c
he	c
gave	c
both	c
students	c
a	c
heavy	c
punishment	c
,	c
which	c
was	c
suspended	i
from	c
school	c
for	c
a	c
week	c

The	c
headmaster	c
went	c
to	c
see	c
Jon	c
and	c
Tim	c
and	c
punished	c
their	i
bad	c
behaviours	i

They	c
both	c
got	c
into	c
trouble	c
because	c
of	c
him	c

Dear	c

I	c
was	c
with	c
my	c

and	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
paid	i
a	i
full-prize	i
for	i
his	i
ticket	c

Becouse	i
the	c
show	c
was	c
very	c
long	c
,	c
we	c
were	c
getting	c
hungry	c
but	c
of	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c

very	c
good	c
at	c

Sometimes	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
sleep	c
on	c
a	i
railway-stations	i
or	c
under	c
a	i
bridges	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

Plus	c
,	c
I	c
felt	c
very	c
pleased	c
when	c
I	c
heard	c
that	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
was	c
part	c
of	c
the	c
play	c
:	c
he	c
used	c
to	c
be	c
an	c
old	c
friend	c
of	c
mine	c
in	c
Highschool	i
and	c
perchance	i
I	c
have	i
found	c
him	c
back	i
here	c
!	c

You	c
can	c
believe	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
disappointed	c
when	c
I	c
saw	c
that	c
he	c
actually	c
was	c
not	c
playing	i
and	c
I	c
was	c
more	c
bewildered	c
that	c
noone	i
made	c
an	c
apologie	i
for	c
it	c
!	c

45	c
minutes	c
latter	i
:	c
where	c
we	c
had	c
nothing	c
to	c
do	c
,	c
but	c
waiting	i
.	c

Although	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
have	c
felt	c
better	c
if	c
I	c
had	c
had	c
a	c
discount	c
on	c
my	c
ticket	c
,	c
as	c
you	c
mentionned	i
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
,	c
but	c
unfortunately	c
,	c
these	c
could	c
n't	c
possibly	c
be	c
reached	i
either	c
!	c

If	c
more	c
and	c
more	c
ingenors	i
work	c
on	i
science	c
and	c
technology	c
,	c
it	c
must	c
be	c
that	i
it	c
is	c
really	c
usefull	i
:	c
but	c
in	c
what	c
particular	c
way	c
?	c

Although	i
I	c
am	c
thankful	c
to	c
modern	c
technology	c
!	c

Although	c
I	c
like	c
camping	c
and	c
sharing	c
with	c
different	c
kind	i
of	c
people	c
,	c
I	c
'd	c
prefer	c
a	c
confortable	i
and	c
private	c
place	c
(	c
if	c
it	c
's	c
possible	c
)	c
where	c
I	c
can	c
sleep	c
,	c
or	c
be	c
quiet.	c
.	c

Eventually	i
,	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
request	c
to	i
have	i
special	i
food	c
,	c
because	c
and	i
vegetarian	c
person	i
,	c
besides	c
I	c
try	c
to	c
eat	c
just	c
organic	c
food	c
.	c

However	c
the	i
reason	c
is	c
absolutely	c
amazing	c
.	c

I	c
applied	c
to	i
the	c
job	c
and	c
she	c
selected	c
me	c
between	i
hundreds	c
of	c
candidates	c
(	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
receive	c
salary	i
)	c
.	c

My	c
work	i
is	c
to	c
help	c
her	c
during	c
each	c
concert	c
.	c

You	c
know	c
,	i
she	c
has	c
a	c
brilliant	c
performance	i
where	c
she	c
must	c
change	c
her	c
customs	i
,	c
make	i
up	i
,	c
scenery	i
,	c
everytime	i
;	c
so	c
she	c
needs	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
people	c
near	c
.	c

all	c
the	c
best	c
.	c

Nowadays	c
many	c
people	c
fond	i
of	c
classical	c
music	c
,	c
but	c
this	c
concert	c
was	c
too	c
small	i
that	i
's	i
why	c
many	c
people	c
had	i
to	i
miss	i
this	c
classical	c
concert	c

Afterwards	c
he	c
came	c
back	c

Ivan	c

Dear	c
SIR/MADAM	c
,	c
My	c
name	c
is	c
.	c

I	c
had	i
spent	i
the	c
hole	i
last	i
week	c
in	c
London	c
with	c
one	c
of	c
my	c
colleagues	c
.	c

We	c
thought	c
that	c
going	c
to	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
"	c
Over	c
The	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
was	i
(	c
as	c
you	c
say	c
in	c
your	c
advertisement	c
)	c
the	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
and	c
the	c
perfect	c
end	c
of	i
our	c
stay	c
in	c
your	c
city	c
.	c

But	c
from	c
the	c
beginning	c
we	c
found	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
problems	c
.	c

Despite	c
we	i
are	i
actors	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
pay	c
a	i
full	i
ticket	c
because	c
the	c
discounts	c
you	c
promise	c
are	c
not	c
available	c
on	c
Sundays	c
.	c

Danny	c
Brook	c
is	c
a	c
good	c
friend	c
of	c
mine	c
and	c
our	c
purpose	i
was	c
to	c
give	c
him	c
a	c
surprise	c
.	c

You	c
can	c
imagine	c
how	i
were	i
our	i
faces	i
like	i
when	c
we	c
saw	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
Danny	c
,	c
but	c
Peter	c
Fox	c
,	c
who	c
was	c
on	c
the	c
stage	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
waiting	c
your	i
answer	c
,	c

During	c
the	c
winter	c
,	c
when	c
it	c
is	c
raining	c
,	c
you	c
can	c
have	c
your	c
clothes	c
dry	c
in	c
less	c
that	i
thirty	c
minutes	c
.	c

Technology	c
has	c
also	c
been	c
a	c
great	c
help	c
in	c
my	c
everyday	c
work	c
.	c

13.06.2000	c

Therefore	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
try	i
some	i
kind	i
of	i
experience	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complaint	i
about	c
a	c
very	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
I	c
recently	c
had	c
during	c
a	c
week	c
's	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

My	c
girlfriend	c
and	c
I	c
read	c
an	c
advertisement	c
about	i
the	c
show	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
which	i
is	c
very	c
popular	c
.	c

When	c
we	c
asked	c
for	c
discounts	i
tickets	c
,	c
we	c
were	c
said	i
there	c
never	c
were	c
discount	c
offers	c
and	c
that	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
pay	c
the	i
highest	i
tickets	c
-	c
£	c
20	c
each	c
-	c
because	c
we	c
were	c
not	c
English	c
students	c
.	c

We	c
were	c
annoyed	c
about	c
it	c
but	c
we	c
paid	c
off	i
.	c

Finally	c
we	c
had	c
the	c
worst	c
evening	c
I	c
have	c
ever	c
imagined	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
definitely	c
not	c
the	c
"	c
perfect	c
evening	c
"	c
as	c
written	c
in	c
the	c
adverstiment	i
.	c

Fashion	c
is	c
changing	c
so	c
quickly	c
that	c
all	c
our	c
dreams	c
about	c
clothes	c
can	c
become	i
true	c
.	c

Materials	c
,	c
textures	c
and	c
colours	c
change	c
,	c
and	c
are	i
minds	c
too	c
.	c

And	c
I	c
hope	c
colours	c
wo	c
n't	c
be	c
dark	c
and	c
sad	c
but	c
very	c
bright	c
and	c
enjoyable	c
to	c
see	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
men	c
will	c
still	c
wear	c
pants	c
and	c
jackets	c
but	c
maybe	c
not	c
in	i
jeans	c
.	c

But	c
maybe	c
the	c
shape	c
of	c
the	c
clothes	c
will	c
changed	i
:	c
large	c
pants	i
as	i
"	i
baggy	i
"	i
,	c
or	c
trousers	c
with	c
many	c
pockets	c
as	c
we	c
see	c
today	c
.	c

It	c
maybe	c
because	c
they	c
are	c
more	c
likely	c
to	c
try	c
new	c
ways	c
of	c
clothes	i
.	c

Finally	c
it	c
's	c
very	c
difficult	c
to	c
say	c
that	i
.	i

And	c
it	c
really	c
is	c
an	c
interesting	c
point	c
of	c
view	c
.	c

To	c
conclude	c
,	c
in	c
the	c
end	c
clothes	c
wo	c
n't	c
be	c
what	c
we	c
think	c
about	i
today	c
,	c
and	c
it	c
's	c
a	c
good	c
thing	c
because	c
we	c
can	c
only	c
imagine	c
and	c
follow	c
the	c
trend	c
of	c
fashion	c
that	c
makes	c
us	c
feel	c
pretty	c
and	c
happy	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
a	i
italian	i
student	c
who	c
has	i
come	i
to	c
the	c
last	c
International	c
Arts	c
Festival	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
this	c
festival	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
idea	c
because	c
it	c
's	c
a	i
possibility	i
to	c
see	c
and	c
to	c
love	i
the	i
art	c
,	c
but	c
,	i
I	c
think	i
also	i
there	c
are	c
some	c
things	c
thas	i
could	c
be	c
changed	c
.	c

I	c
noticed	c
that	c
the	c
artists	c
were	c
from	c
only	c
six	c
countries	c
insted	i
that	i
from	c
around	c
the	c
world	c
.	c

The	i
very	i
about	i
young	c
people	c
,	c
the	c
choice	i
to	c
offer	c
a	c
reasonably-priced	i
weekend	c
ticket	c
is	c
a	i
excellent	c
idea	c
because	c
it	c
brings	i
them	i
to	i
have	i
a	i
contact	i
with	i
all	i
what	i
it	i
art	i
.	c

I	c
hope	c
that	c
my	c
opinion	c
can	c
help	c
you	c
to	c
set	i
fro	i
the	i
next	c
year	c
a	c
great	c
internation	i
arts	c
festival	c
alone	i
to	i
young	i
people	i
.	c

It	c
depends	c
on	c
what	c
you	c
need	c
.	c

What	c
do	i
you	i
want	i
more	i
?	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

That	c
is	c
why	c
I	c
ask	c
you	c
for	i
refunding	i
my	c
money	c
,	c
or	c
at	c
least	c
part	c
of	c
it	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
about	c
a	c
woman	c
who	c
poisoned	c
her	c
first	c
husband	c
.	c

Not	c
only	c
is	c
the	c
plot	c
interesting	c
but	c
also	c
it	c
catchs	i
your	c
attention	i
since	i
the	c
first	c
moment	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
it	c
says	c
that	c
the	c
main	c
actor	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
be	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
instead	i
of	c
Brook	c
I	c
saw	c
another	c
actor	c
,	c
totally	c
stranger	i
to	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
want	c
to	c
be	c
rude	c
,	c
but	c
this	c
is	c
not	c
proffessional	i
at	c
all	c
.	c

and	c
the	c
musical	c
finished	c
at	c
11:30	c
.	c

And	c
not	i
only	c
the	c
computer	c
.	c

Everyday	i
I	c
use	c
the	c
microwave	c
for	c
heating	c
my	c
food	c
and	c
of	c
course	c
.	i

The	c
only	c
thing	c
I	c
really	c
support	i
is	c
that	c
if	c
you	c
know	c
how	c
to	c
use	c
technology	c
is	i
a	c
benefit	c
for	i
you	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
for	c
us	c
because	c
there	c
will	c
be	c
expositions	i
of	c
the	c
latest	c
fashions	c
,	c
of	c
the	c
new	c
hairstyles	c
,	c
of	i
the	c
new	c
leisure	c
and	c
sports	c
clothes	c
and	c
people	c
teaching	c
how	c
to	c
make	i
up	i
.	c

Nowadays	c
,	c
the	c
media	c
is	c
expanding	c
its	c
ways	i
of	c
communication	c
so	c
they	c
need	c
more	c
information	c
.	c

The	c
media	c
is	c
starting	c
to	c
get	i
into	c
the	c
private	c
life	c
of	c
these	c
famous	c
people	c
.	c

In	c
summary	c
,	c
the	c
best	c
thing	c
to	c
do	c
is	c
try	c
to	c
extract	c
from	c
these	c
people	c
their	c
best	c
qualities	c
and	c
not	c
try	c
to	c
find	c
things	c
that	c
could	c
irritate	c
them	c
like	c
familiar	i
problems	c
or	c
personal	c
problems	c
.	c

Also	c
,	c
the	c
musical	c
did	c
not	c
start	c
at	c
19.30	c
,	c
it	c
started	c
forty-five	c
minutes	c
later	c
.	c

Another	c
thing	c
is	c
that	c
there	c
were	c
not	c
any	c
discounts	c
in	i
the	c
entrance	c
fee	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
worried	c
because	c
if	c
my	c
parents	c
knew	c
that	c
I	c
had	c
failed	c
,	c
before	c
we	c
were	c
on	c
holidays	i
,	c
they	c
will	i
cancelled	i
the	c
trip	c
to	c
Africa	c
.	c

But	c
,	c
when	i
my	c
mother	c
was	i
talking	i
with	i
Pat	c
's	c
mother	c
and	c
she	c
mentioned	c
it	c
,	c
my	i
mother	c
cancelled	c
the	c
trip	c
to	c
Africa	c
.	c

All	c
the	c
other	c
shows	c
such	c
as	c
dance	c
shows	c
,	c
art	c
exhibition	i
and	c
talks	c
by	c
writers	c
were	c
very	c
amusing	i
.	c

I	c
thought	c
it	c
was	c
worthwhile	c
to	c
have	c
spent	c
two	c
days	c
in	i
the	c
Arts	c
Festival	c
at	i
the	c
end	c
.	c

Yours	c
Sincerely	c

Once	c
upon	c
a	c
time	c
there	c
was	c
a	c
widow	c
and	c
a	c
widower	c
.	c

The	c
widow	c
who	i
was	c
afaid	c
told	i
the	c
man	c
of	i
the	c
gold	c
.	c

The	c
widower	c
was	c
confused	c
and	c
they	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
lake	c
.	c

They	c
lived	c
happily	c
ever	c
after	c
.	c

FIRST	c
OF	c
ALL	c
,	c
I	c
WANT	c
YOU	c
KNOW	i
THAT	c
THIS	c
SATURDAY	c
WAS	c
MY	c
HUSBAND	c
'S	c
BIRTHDAY	c
AND	c
I	c
WAS	c
PLANNING	c
THIS	c
DAY	c
DURING	i
ONE	c
MONTH	c
.	c

MY	c
INTENTION	c
WAS	c
TO	c
SPEND	i
AN	i
SPECIAL	c
NIGHT	c
WITH	c
HIM	c
.	c

IT	i
IS	c
N'T	c
ALL	c
.	c

WHEN	c
THE	c
SHOW	c
WAS	c
FINISHED	c
,	c
WE	c
WANTED	c
TO	c
GO	c
TO	c
DINNER	c
,	c
AS	c
YOU	c
PUBLISHED	i
ON	i
THE	c
PROGRAMM	i
,	c
BUT	c
THE	c
RESTAURANT	c
WAS	c
CLOSED	c
BECAUSE	c
IT	c
WAS	c
ON	i
PUBLIC	i
WORKS	i
!	c
!	c
!	c

He	c
was	c
shy	c
,	c
reserved	c
and	c
a	c
very	c
closed	c
person	c
.	c

She	c
did	c
n't	c
tell	c
him	c
anything	c
more	i
,	c
and	c
Pat	c
did	c
n't	c
have	c
any	c
secret	i
to	c
sell	c
to	c
his	c
"	c
new	c
friends	c
"	c
.	c

At	i
least	i
,	c
Pat	c
did	c
n't	c
have	c
any	c
friend	i
,	c
because	c
he	c
did	c
n't	c
have	c
anything	c
to	i
sell	i
about	i
Anna	i
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c

In	c
the	c
hall	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
four	c
important	c
themes	c
;	c
latest	c
fashions	c
,	c
leisure	c
and	c
sports	c
wear	c
,	c
make	i
up	i
,	c
and	c
hairstyles	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
we	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
change	c
the	c
plans	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
and	c
Wednesday	c
in	c
the	c
morning	c
.	c

Obviously	c
,	c
they	c
have	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
fans	c
and	c
their	c
fans	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
what	c
happened	i
to	c
them	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
,	c
their	c
life	i
may	c
be	c
the	i
good	c
example	c
for	c
other	c
people	c
to	c
follow	c
.	c

And	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
.	c

I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
practice	i
golf	c
and	c
tennis	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
very	c
extroverted	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
like	c
spend	c
my	c
energy	c
doing	c
sports	c
or	c
some	c
kinds	c
of	c
energetic	c
activity	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
not	c
easy	c
for	c
me	c
,	c
as	c
I	c
used	c
to	c
depend	c
on	c
my	c
parents	c
before	c
I	c
came	c
here	c
.	c

I	c
realised	c
that	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

The	c
second	c
activity	c
,	i
which	c
I	c
choose	c
is	c
playing	c
basketball	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
love	c
this	c
wonderful	c
sport	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
that	c
you	c
are	c
now	c
well	c
informed	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
which	i
clothes	c
and	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
should	c
bring	c
with	c
me	c
.	c

Austria	c
,	c
13th	c
June	c
200	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

You	c
know	c
,	c
last	c
month	c
I	c
helped	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
sure	c
you	c
want	c
to	c
know	c
some	c
details	c
.	c

My	c
second	c
task	c
was	c
that	i
I	i
had	i
to	c
look	c
in	c
all	c
the	c
bags	i
of	i
the	i
fans	i
to	c
collect	i
"	c
dangerous	c
"	c
items	c
,	i
I	c
saw	c
really	c
funny	c
things	c
like	c
teeth-bruches	i
in	c
the	c
bags	c
.	c

Summing	c
up	c
I	i
can	c
say	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
fantastic	c
day	c
,	c
because	c
Britney	c
sang	c
so	c
beautiful	i
and	c
the	c
performance	c
was	c
also	c
super	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
,	c
on	i
the	i
name	i
of	i
all	c
my	c
English	c
class	c
,	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
the	c
opportunity	c
you	c
give	i
us	c
to	c
spend	c
three	c
days	c
in	c
London	c
,	c
but	c
also	c
to	c
suggest	c
some	c
modifications	c
in	i
the	c
programme	c
.	c

But	c
from	i
the	i
other	i
,	c
everybody	c
has	c
the	c
right	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
secret	c
garden	c
,	c
the	c
right	c
to	c
be	c
with	c
his/her	c
family	c
without	c
be	i
disturbed	c
by	c
journalists	c
and	c
photographers	c
.	c

As	c
public	c
people	c
,	c
stars	c
and	c
politicians	c
have	c
to	c
accord	i
some	c
time	c
to	c
their	c
public	c
but	c
fans	c
and	c
press	c
people	c
have	c
to	c
respect	c
their	c
private	c
life	c
and	c
to	c
stay	c
polite	c
and	c
respectful	c
.	c

This	c
show	c
give	i
us	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
informations	i
about	c
current	c
activities	c
,	c
fashion	c
and	c
what	c
is	c
happened	i
here	c
in	c
London	c
for	i
example	c
lastest	i
fashions	c
,	c
leisure	c
and	c
sports	c
wear	c
,	c
make	i
up	i
,	c
hairstyles	i
.	c

It	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
because	c
we	c
will	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
learn	c
london	i
culture	c
.	c

I'am	i
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
your	c
opinion	c
on	i
my	c
suggestion	c
.	c

It	c
would	c
be	c
wonderful	c
if	c
there	c
were	c
stars	c
from	c
more	c
than	c
six	c
countries	c
next	c
year	c
,	c
the	c
festival	c
would	c
be	c
even	c
more	c
interesting	c
then	c
.	c

Howe	i
are	c
things	c
going	c
over	c
there	c
?	c

We	c
're	c
not	c
allowed	c
to	c
drink	c
alcohol	c
as	c
well	c
and	c
quarrel	c
with	c
any	c
of	c
the	c
teaches	i
.	c

In	c
addition	c
,	c
there	i
should	c
not	c
too	i
hot	c
inside	c
during	c
July	c
.	c

Therefore	c
,	c
people	c
used	i
to	i
shopping	c
weekly	c
or	c
monthly	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
women	c
are	i
really	i
enjoying	i
shopping	c
.	c

It	i
seems	i
a	i
human	i
activity	i
during	i
their	i
spare	i
time	i
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
I	c
believe	c
that	c
shopping	c
only	c
waste	i
time	c
for	i
human	i
life	i
.	c

As	c
a	c
result	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
pay	c
the	c
full	c
price	c
of	c
£	c
15	c
.	c

The	c
second	c
point	c
is	c
that	c
the	c
show	c
had	i
a	i
delay	i
of	i
about	c
30	c
minutes	c
.	c

I	c
therefore	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
compensation	i
of	c
£	i
30	c
which	c
I	c
spent	c
on	c
the	c
tickets	c
.	c

Your	i
Sincerely	i

My	c
story	c
had	c
already	c
been	c
spread	c
out	i
the	c
next	c
day	c
.	c

but	i
this	i
idea	i
was	i
soon	i
be	i
put	i
off	i
since	c
I	c
noticed	c
on	i
the	c
newspaper	c
that	c
I	c
had	c
won	c
the	c
writing	c
competition	c
.	c

I	c
must	c
admit	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
the	c
greatest	c
time	c
I	c
have	c
ever	c
had	c
in	c
my	c
life	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
last	c
day	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
packing	c
and	c
getting	c
ready	c
to	c
leave	c
,	c
I	c
realised	c
I	c
had	c
lost	c
my	c
passport	c
and	c
tickets	c
.	c

The	c
last	c
one	i
,	i
we	c
wanted	c
to	c
have	c
a	i
dinner	c
in	c
your	c
restaurant	c
after	c
a	i
terrible	c
musical	c
show	c
,	c
but	c
we	c
could	c
n't	c
have	i
it	i
,	c
because	c
a	c
waiter	c
said	c
your	c
chef	c
had	c
gone	c
home	c
.	c

By	c
the	c
way	c
,	c
I	c
want	c
you	c
to	c
pay	i
my	i
money	c
back	c
for	i
the	c
waste	i
time	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
you	c
understand	c
.	c

These	i
all	i
happen	i
from	i
human	i
who	i
want	i
to	i
live	i
with	i
science	i
and	i
technology	i
,	i
not	i
the	i
natural	i
which	i
the	i
world	i
gives	i
it	i
to	i
us	i
.	c

We	c
both	c
know	c
this	c
is	c
not	c
true	c
,	c
or	c
shoud	i
n't	i
be	c
.	c

Well	c
,	c
I	c
will	c
not	c
comment	c
that	i
point	c
.	c

Expecting	c
your	c
news	c
,	c

It	c
is	c
almost	c
true	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
fashion	c
is	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
most	c
exciting	c
human	c
activities	c
nowadays	c
.	c

New	c
fabrics	c
create	c
new	c
textures	c
,	c
all	c
kind	i
of	c
accesories	i
are	c
added	c
to	c
create	c
new	c
versions	c
,	c
to	c
refresh	c
old	c
ideas	c
,	c
to	c
make	c
new	c
proposals	c
that	c
will	c
last	c
,	c
like	i
always	c
,	c
just	c
some	i
weeks	c
.	c

Fashion	c
is	c
a	c
part	c
of	c
our	c
lives	c
,	c
even	c
for	c
those	c
who	c
will	c
never	c
reconize	i
it	c
.	c

Have	c
you	c
notice	i
that	c
all	c
the	c
classic	c
gentlemen	c
wear	c
same	i
tipe	i
of	c
suit	c
?	c

More	i
over	i
after	i
watching	c
a	i
show	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
visit	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
,	c
but	c

Dear	c
Manager	c
,	c

I	c
think	c
you	c
should	c
have	c
informed	c
us	c
of	c
changing	i
starring	i
before	c
starting	c
of	i
the	c
show	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
instead	c
of	c
19:30	c
mentioned	i
on	i
the	c
advertisement	c
.	c

Lastly	c
,	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
had	i
been	i
closed	i
already	i
when	c
the	c
show	c
was	i
finished	i
,	c
because	c
the	c
time	i
of	i
begining	i
of	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
late	c
.	c

How	c
foolish	c
!	c

"	c
Oh	c

17th	c
-	c
June	c
-	c
2000	c

I	c
went	c
to	c
buy	c
the	c
tickets	c
but	c
when	c
I	c
paid	c
there	c
was	c
not	c
any	c
discount	c
avaible	i
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
organizing	c
this	c
trip	c
to	c
London	c
,	c
and	c
for	c
taking	c
care	c
of	c
the	c
programme	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
dangerous	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
knew	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
listen	i
the	c
crowd	c
shouting	c
'	c
Go	c
,	c
Go	i
'	c
.	c

Then	c
,	c
by	c
some	c
'	c
strange	c
power	c
'	c
my	i
left	c
foot	c
was	c
moving	c
and	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
stop	c
it	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
too	c
difficult	c
.	c

tic	i
,	c
tac	i
...	c

And	c
suddenly	c
everything	c
stopped	c
.	c

I	c
felt	c
an	c
enourmous	i
peace	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
we	c
realised	i
that	c
on	c
the	c
14th	c
we	c
will	i
already	i
visit	i
the	c
Science	c
Museum	c
.	c

Our	c
question	c
now	c
:	i
Could	i
we	c
go	c
to	c
this	c
show	c
?	c

I	c
can	c
really	c
recommend	i
you	i
this	i
book	i
,	i
it	i
is	c
fabulous	c
.	c

There	c
is	c
a	c
storm	c
and	c
they	c
can	i
not	i
leave	c
.	c

Suddenly	c
a	c
murderer	i
happens	i
!	c

Believe	c
me	c
,	c
you	c
would	c
never	c
guess	c
who	c
the	c
killer	c
is	c
!	c

But	c
do	c
not	c
worry	c
about	c
the	c
price	c
because	c
your	c
cousin	c
will	c
love	c
it	c
!	c

Okay	c
,	c
I	c
hope	c
to	c
have	c
news	c
from	c
you	c
very	c
soon	c
.	c

Have	c
a	c
good	c
time	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	i
effort	c
,	i
which	c
you	c
have	c
made	c
to	c
organize	c
this	c
three	i
days	i
programm	i
in	c
London	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
sure	c
that	c
we	c
will	c
have	c
a	c
great	c
time	c
there	c
especially	i
in	c
the	c
National	c
Art	c
Gallery	c
.	c

Nevertheless	c
,	c
the	c
students	c
in	c
my	c
class	c
have	c
some	c
suggestions	c
for	c
you	c
how	i
to	c
make	c
it	c
even	c
more	c
interesting	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Moreover	c
,	c
they	c
will	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
create	c
a	c
special	c
climate	c
for	c
each	c
room	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
possible	c
that	c
only	c
one	c
computer	c
will	c
do	c
this	i
all	i
and	c
it	c
will	c
have	c
its	c
own	c
personality	c
,	c
voice	c
,	c
eyesight.	c
.	c

This	c
will	c
be	c
your	c
home	c
,	c
another	c
member	c
of	c
your	c
family	c
and	c
your	c
house	c
or	c
flat	c
together	i
.	c

This	c
is	c
my	c
opinion	i
of	c
the	c
Home	c
of	c
the	c
Future	c
and	c
I	c
wish	c
I	c
could	c
live	c
in	c
it	c
.	c

IN	c
THE	c
SAME	c
WAY	c
,	c
WE	c
CAN	c
TRAVEL	c
INSIDE	c
OUR	c
COUNTRY	c
QUICKLY	c
AND	c
SAFELY	c
.	c

CONSEQUENTLY	c
,	c
WE	c
'VE	c
GOT	c
FACILITIES	i
TO	c
KNOW	c
MANY	c
DIFFERENT	c
PLACES	c
AND	c
TO	c
CONTACT	c
DIFFERENT	c
PEOPLE	c
,	c
TOO	c

Dear	i
Sir/Manager	i
,	c

To	c
my	c
dismay	c
the	c
musical	c
was	c
nothing	c
compared	c
to	c
what	c
I	c
had	c
expected	c
,	c
as	c
it	c
completely	c
contradicted	c
to	i
the	c
advertisement	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
despite	c
the	c
advertisement	c
stating	c
that	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
was	c
starring	c
,	c
another	c
actor	c
was	i
starring	i
in	c
the	c
actual	c
show	c
and	c
his	c
performance	c
was	c
literally	i
horrible	c
,	c
and	c
disappointing	c
.	c

According	c
to	c
the	c
advertisement	c
,	c
the	c
audience	c
were	c
free	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
further	c
humiliated	c
by	c
the	c
irony	c
of	c
the	c
advertisement	c
stating	i
that	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
my	c
'	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
'	c
,	c
when	c
it	c
was	c
totally	i
the	c
opposite	c
.	c

Yours	c
Sincerely	i
,	c

During	c
these	c
past	c
few	c
decades	c
,	c
or	c
rather	c
,	i
the	i
20th	c
century	c
,	c
there	c
has	c
been	c
a	c
significant	i
developement	i
in	c
modern	c
technology	c
.	c

This	c
enables	c
us	c
to	c
save	c
great	i
deal	c
of	c
time	c
and	c
effort	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
:	c

Above	c
are	i
all	c
the	c
information	c
you	c
asked	c
,	i
however	i
,	c
here	i
are	c
something	i
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
;	c
first	i
is	c
about	c
the	c
clothes	c
,	i
what	i
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	i
need	c
to	c
take	c
with	c
?	i

Dear	c
Kim	c
:	c

I	c
only	c
put	c
the	c
speakers	c
in	c
the	c
right	c
places	c
,	c
or	c
helping	i
engieners	i
tested	i
the	c
lights	c
.	c

From	c
that	c
,	c
I	c
learnt	c
more	c
about	c
instruments	i
.	c

After	c
the	c
concer	i
finished	c
successfully	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
happier	c
than	c
ever	c
because	c
the	c
succeed	i
inclueded	i
my	c
work	c
and	c
that	c
was	c
the	c
most	c
enjoyable	c
moment	c
in	c
my	c
life	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
receiving	c
your	c
letter	c
again	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
saw	c
the	c
advertisement	c
of	i
the	c
show	c
it	c
was	c
written	c
that	c
the	c
show	c
will	i
started	i
at	c
a	c
half	c
past	c
seven	c
but	c
started	i
at	c
a	c
quarter	c
past	c
eight	c
.	c

Then	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
buying	c
my	c
ticket	c
I	c
asked	c
for	c
discount	i
but	c
they	c
were	c
n't	c
available	c
.	c

So	c
because	c
of	c
this	c
horrible	c
evening	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
ask	c
for	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

Modern	c
technology	c
have	i
been	c
changing	c
the	i
human	c
life	c
since	c
the	c
first	c
many	i
was	c
born	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
asked	c
in	c
the	c
letter	c
,	c
I	c
will	c
write	c
everything	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
know	c
about	c
the	c
travel	i
.	c

The	c
other	c
activitie	i
is	c
Photography	c
,	i
I	c
am	c
not	c
an	c
expert	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
know	c
how	c
to	c
use	c
a	c
camera	c
,	i
all	i
I	c
want	c
is	c
to	c
improve	c
my	c
knowledge	c
.	c

Do	c
you	c
have	c
any	c
kind	c
of	c
souvenirs	c
that	c
I	c
can	c
buy	c
?	c

I	c
was	c
so	c
excited	c
that	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
believe	c
.	i

When	c
I	c
arrived	c
to	c
help	c
them	c
,	c
they	c
welcomed	c
me	c
and	c
were	c
so	c
nice	c
with	i
me	c
that	c
it	c
seemed	c
we	c
had	c
known	c
each	c
others	i
in	i
ages	c
!	c

I	c
helped	c
them	c
organizing	i
the	c
stage	c
,	c
cleaning	c
everything	c
,	c
fixing	c
what	c
was	c
broken	c
and	c
they	c
even	c
let	c
me	c
play	c
with	c
their	c
guittars	i

I	c
hope	c
you	c
liked	c
everything	c
I	c
said	c

I	c
hope	c

JUN	c
17th	c
,	c
2000	c

In	i
order	i
to	c
the	c
tickets	c
,	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
they	c
are	c
very	c
expensive	c
.	c

To	c
sum	i
up	i
,	c
the	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

I	c
will	i
appreciate	c
if	i
you	c
could	c
send	c
me	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

Looking	i
for	c
your	c
repley	i
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
not	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

When	c
she	c
was	c
a	c
girl	c
,	c
Pat	c
used	c
to	c
play	c
spies	i
and	c
detectives	i
games	c
.	c

At	c
first	c
she	c
walked	c
around	c
the	c
bayside	i
market	c
looking	i
for	i
all	c
the	c
people	c
who	c
were	c
there	c
.	c

When	c
she	c
saw	c
a	c
man	c
,	c
different	c
for	i
the	c
rest	c
,	c
talking	c
with	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
sellers	i
.	c

Obviously	c
the	c
man	c
realised	c
that	c
she	c
was	c
looking	c
for	c
him	c
and	c
said	c
that	c
she	c
was	c
really	c
crazy	c
!	c

You	c
can	c
imagine	c
what	c
had	i
happened	i
with	i
her	c
cover	c
as	i
a	i
spy	i
.	c

As	c
for	c
selecting	c
two	c
activities	c
,	c
basketball	c
and	c
surfing	c
are	c
definitely	c
on	c
my	c
list	c
.	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

I	c
could	c
n't	c
find	c
my	c
feet	c
at	c
first	c
as	c
I	c
was	c
so	c
nervous	c
.	c

They	c
patiently	c
explained	c
to	c
me	c
my	c
job	c
even	c
so	i
they	c
were	c
fairly	c
busy	c
themselves	c
.	c

Indeed	c
,	c
they	c
can	i
not	i
succeed	c
without	c
their	c
help	c
,	c
can	c
they	c
?	c

They	c
were	c
all	c
sold	c
out	c
.	c

You	c
should	c
have	c
said	c
they	i
were	c
very	c
few	c
.	c

It	c
had	c
already	c
closed	c
,	i
when	c
the	c
show	c
finished	c
.	c

yours	c
faithfully	c

Below	c
I	c
provide	c
you	c
with	c
the	c
information	c
that	c
you	c
asked	c
me	c
for	c
.	c

I	c
already	c
have	c
plans	c
for	c
my	c
holiday	c
and	c
July	c
suits	c
me	c
the	c
best	c
.	c

As	c
for	c
accomodation	i
I	i
would	c
prefer	c
log	c
cabins	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
belive	i
they	c
are	c
more	c
comfortable	c
then	i
tents	c
.	c

The	c
activities	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
do	c
during	c
my	c
stay	c
are	c
golf	c
and	c
surfing	c
.	c

The	c
other	c
question	c
is	c
about	c
money	c
.	c

Some	c
people	c
may	c
think	c
that	c
school	c
is	c
boring	c
and	c
nothing	c
interesting	c
ever	c
happens	c
there	c
.	c

The	c
computer	c
class	c
can	i
be	c
also	c
there	c
,	c
because	c
program	i
and	c
internet	c
surfing	c
is	i
quite	c
interesting	c
.	c

According	c
to	c
your	c
advertisement	c
it	c
was	i
at	c
19:30	c
,	c
and	c
,	i
what	c
a	c
surprise	c
when	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
wait	c
almost	c
an	c
hour	c
until	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
!	c

As	c
you	c
can	c
see	c
it	i
's	i
not	c
a	c
perfect	c
evening	c
,	c
is	i
n't	i
it	c
?	c

I	c
'm	c
asking	c
you	c
my	i
money	c
back	c
,	c
you	c
can	c
do	c
it	c
,	c
ca	c
n't	c
you	c
?	c

Wondering	i
your	i
comprension	i

They	c
are	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
one	c
thing	c
linked	c
together	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

Personally	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
rather	c
stay	c
in	c
log	c
cabins	c
than	c
in	c
tents	c
.	c

which	c
include	c
the	i
english	i
song	i
and	c
the	c
japenese	i
song	i
,	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
part-time	i
job	c
for	i
sining	i
at	c
restaurant	i
.	c

I	c
have	i
unpleased	i
experience	c
.	c

The	c
shop	c
manager	c
was	i
coming	i
solution	i
it	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
the	c
same	c
in	c
our	c
family	i
and	i
for	i
example	c
my	i
parents	c
dislike	c
hearing	c
music	c
in	i
the	c
whole	c
house	c
or	i
that	i
I	i
let	i
dust	i
everywhere	i
.	c

Every	c
season	c
we	c
can	c
see	c
arrival	i
of	c
new	c
styles	c
,	c
fabrics	c
and	c
proportions	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
people	c
will	c
express	c
themselves	c
by	c
wearing	c
appropriate	c
clothes	c
.	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
have	i
been	i
very	c
surprised	c
winning	i
.	c

I	c
can	c
take	c
holidays	c
only	c
the	i
month	c
of	c
July	c
.	c

You	c
ask	c
me	c
if	c
I	c
prefer	c
to	c
sleep	c
in	c
tents	c
or	c
log	c
cabins	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
even	c
done	i
competitions	c
.	c

I	c
love	c
water	c
but	c
I	c
never	i
try	i
this	c
sport	c
before	c
.	c

How	c
much	c
money	c
do	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
with	c
me	c
for	c
these	c
two	c
weeks	c
and	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
do	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
because	c
of	c
different	c
problems	c

The	c
first	c
thing	c
is	c
the	c
place	i
of	c

The	c
third	c
thing	c
is	c
the	c

It	c
only	c
depends	c
on	c
the	c
person	c
who	c
is	c
actually	c
doing	c
it	c
and	c
some	c
convenient	c
circumstances	c
like	c
a	c
huge	c
amount	c
of	c
money	c
on	i
our	c
bank	c
account	c

It	c
was	c
actually	c
very	c
disappointing	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
I	c
want	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
as	c
you	c
said	c
'	c
your	c
pefect	c
evening	c
'	c
out	c
in	c
your	c
advertisement	c
and	c
I	c
rally	i
do	c
think	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
the	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
.	c

I	c
did	c
not	c
get	c
discount	i
.	c

I	c
really	c
do	c
think	c
you	c
need	c
to	c
organise	c
your	c
show	c
a	c
bit	c
more	c
carefully	c
so	c
you	c
do	c
not	c
make	c
these	c
mistakes	c
in	c
future	c
and	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
kind	c
of	c
you	c
if	c
you	c
give	c
my	c
money	c
back	c

I	c
believe	c
that	c
modern	c
technology	c
has	c
changed	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
people	c
's	c
daily	c
life	c
.	c

I	c
can	c
do	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
things	c
using	c
the	c
computer	c

There	c
are	c
plenty	c

You	c
wrote	c
that	c
the	c
favourite	i
actor	c
will	i
be	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
but	c
there	c
was	c
another	c
one	c
who	c
was	c
really	c
disappointing	c
.	c

Because	c
of	c
the	c
advertisement	c
I	c
thought	c
that	c
I	c
can	i
discount	i
the	i
tickets	c
available	c
but	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c

about	c

she	c
dreamed	c
from	i
someone	c
who	c
she	c
can	i
tell	c
her	c
own	c
secrets	c

So	c
they	c
found	i
both	i
the	c
person	c
they	c
dreamed	c
from	i
.	c

Apart	c
from	c
it	i
,	c
the	c

should	c
have	c
begun	c
at	c
19.30	c
and	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c

How	c
can	c
you	c
dare	c
putting	i
an	c
advertisement	c
for	c
a	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
if	c
you	c
obviously	c
know	c
that	i
is	c
closed	c
?	c

For	c
all	c
these	c
reasons	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
,	c
dear	c

or	c

that	i
you	c
give	i
me	c

If	c
only	c
Paul	c
had	c
knew	i
it	i
before	c
...	c

While	c
he	c
was	c
wandering	c
in	c
the	c
depths	c
of	c
the	c
forest	c
he	c
felt	c
a	c
little	c
tired	c
and	c
sat	c
on	c
a	c
grey	i
huge	i
stone	c
,	c
on	c
top	i
of	c
which	c
he	c
could	c
stare	c
the	i
whole	c
woods	i
.	c

Relieved	c
,	c
he	c
thought	c
that	c
bringing	c
the	c
creature	c
in	i
his	c
world	c
would	c
have	c
revealed	c
the	c
existence	c
of	c
Faerie	c

and	c
with	c
it	c
,	c
threatened	c
the	c
ecology	c
of	c

Dream	c
Landscape	c
,	c
when	c
he	c
heard	c
a	c
creepy	c
sound	c
under	c
his	c
bed	c

He	c
told	c
him	c
about	c
his	c
adventures	c
and	c
asked	c
him	c
not	c
to	c
repeat	c
it	i
.	c

This	c
is	c
how	c
secrets	c
are	c
betrayed	c

and	c
the	c
result	c
of	i
it	i

People	c
have	c

more	c

casual	c

practical	c
than	c
before	c

But	c
in	c
which	i
way	c
?	c

But	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
disappointed	c

I	c
do	c
not	c
think	c
that	c
this	c
delay	c
is	c
acceptable	c

Even	c
your	c

have	c
had	c
a	c
lot	c

together	c
because	c
we	c
had	i
the	c
same	c
interests	c

When	c
we	c
were	c
15	c
years	c
old	c
we	c
decided	c
to	c
drive	c
with	i
my	c
mother	c

on	c
a	c
day	c
when	c
my	c
parents	c
were	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
surprised	c
because	c
Pat	c
and	c
I	c
were	c
along	i
when	c
we	c
decided	c
to	c
do	c
that	i
.	c

The	c
next	c
day	c
Pat	c
told	c
me	c
that	c
he	c
wanted	c
to	c
be	c
admired	c
by	c
some	c
girls	c
and	c
so	c
he	c
had	c
to	c
tell	c
them	c
our	c
secret	c

have	c
seen	c

This	c

forbid	i
me	c
to	i
dinner	c
in	c
your	c
restaurant	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
just	c
closing	c

And	c
as	i
a	i
conclusion	i
I	c
want	c
you	c
to	c

The	c
Area	c
Around	c
the	c
School	c
:	c

I	c
have	c
made	i
a	c
little	c
survey	c
on	c
the	c
subject	c
of	c
my	c
report	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
elucidaded	i
that	c
most	c
of	c
the	c
pupils	c
of	c
our	c
school	c
consider	i
that	c
the	c
region	c
and	c
the	c
area	c
around	c
school	c
should	c
be	c
filmed	c
first	c
.	c

Personally	c
I	c
agree	c
with	c
their	c
statement	i
and	c
think	c
that	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
interesting	c
for	c
viewers	c
to	c
learn	c
about	c
the	c
surroundings	c
of	c
the	c
school	c
.	c

Next	i
things	c
to	c
be	c
shot	c
,	c
by	i
the	c
majority	c
of	c
students	c
was	i
said	i
to	i
be	i
the	c
teaching	c
process	c
and	c
the	c
breaks	c
.	c

Obviously	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
interesting	c
to	c
find	c
out	c
what	c
methods	c
are	c
used	c
by	c
our	c
teachers	c
to	c
help	c
pupils	c
understand	c
their	c
subject	c
better	c
.	c

People	c
should	c
see	c
all	c
the	c
renovations	c
that	c
have	c
been	c
made	i
during	c
the	c
last	c
years	i
and	c
all	c
modern	i
conveniences	c
that	c
were	c
made	i
for	c
both	c
students	c
and	c
teachers	c
.	c

And	c
as	c
regards	c
breaks	c
student	i
consider	c
them	c
being	i
a	c
very	c
important	c
part	c
of	c
school	c
life	c
,	c
despite	c
all	c
their	i
mess	c
and	c
noise	c
.	c

We	c
are	c
really	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
visiting	c
the	c
city	c
and	c
going	c
to	c
the	c
Museum	i
and	c
Gallery	i
.	c

However	c
,	c
there	c
is	c
one	c
point	c
that	c
we	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
change	c
in	c
the	c
programme	c
.	c

We	c
are	c
interested	c
in	c
visiting	c
"	c
The	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
"	c
during	c
our	c
travel	i
.	c

We	c
think	c
that	c
we	c
could	c
go	c
there	c
next	i
14th	c
of	c
March	c
,	c
in	c
the	c
eveninng	i
,	c
instead	c
of	c
going	c
shopping	c
.	c

Normally	c
,	c
one	c
people	i
's	i
dream	c
is	c
to	c
be	c
famous	i
and	i
rich	i
but	c
without	c
that	c
stuff	c
of	i
being	c
without	c
privacy	c

I	c
mean	c
,	c
they	c
enjoin	i
being	c
the	c
point	i
of	i
view	i
or	c
the	c
center	i
of	i
everyone	c
,	c
even	c
though	c
it	c
means	c
to	i
see	i
their	c
lifes	i
.	c

Between	c
the	c
tent	c
and	c
log	c
cabin	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
the	c
tent	c
.	c

Living	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
will	c
also	c
enhance	c
my	c
survival	c
skills	c
,	c
making	c
this	c
a	c
trip	c
to	c
remember	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

I	c
hear	c
that	c
it	c
can	c
be	c
terrible	c
at	c
times	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
fantastic	c
experience	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
n't	c
as	c
easy	c
as	c
I	c
had	c
expected	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
special	c
equipment	c
and	c
techniques	c
which	c
must	c
be	c
used	c
to	c
ensure	c
a	c
good	c
result	c
.	c

I	c
also	c
got	c
to	c
fix	i
new	c
speakers	c
so	c
that	c
the	c
music	c
could	c
be	c
heard	c
clearly	c
throughout	c
the	c
hall	c
.	c

I	c
enjoyed	c
fixing	i
the	c
studio	c
equipment	c
in	c
particular	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
whole	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
fun	c
experience	c
to	c
work	c
with	c
friends	c
,	c
fixing	i
bulbs	c
,	c
attaching	c
lights	c
and	c
adding	c
speakers	c

Bye	c
for	c
now	c
!	c

Yours	i
faithfully	i
,	i

According	i
to	i
your	c
activities	c
at	c
the	c
Camp	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
choose	c
singing	c
and	c
painting	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
a	i
lead	c
singer	c
in	c
the	c
university	c
band	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
good	c
at	c
this	c
activity	c
.	c

Once	c
again	c
,	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
giving	c
me	c
a	c
good	c
opportunity	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
first	c
place	c
,	c
some	c
housewifes	i
do	c
n't	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
supermarket	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
not	c
fun	c
to	c
go	c
shopping	c
with	c
a	c
long	c
list	c
and	c
decide	c
which	c
one	c
is	c
the	c
first	c
and	c
the	c
second	c
.	c

To	c
make	c
matters	c
worse	c
,	c
you	c
forget	i
to	c
buy	c
something	c
when	c
you	c
get	c
back	c
home	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
if	c
you	c
go	c
with	c
your	c
children	c
,	c
you	c
will	c
have	c
to	c
control	c
them	c
and	c
remember	c
things	c
on	c
your	c
list	c
at	c
the	c
same	c
time	c
and	c
sometimes	c
they	c
cry	c
when	c
they	c
want	c
something	c
in	c
the	c
supermarket	c
.	c

I	c
cannot	c
imagine	c
anything	c
worse	c
.	c

The	c
other	c
disadvantage	c
is	c
that	c
you	c
enjoy	c
going	c
shopping	c
too	c
much	c
and	c
pay	c
everything	i
buy	i
credit	i
card	c
.	c

When	c
a	i
bill	c
comes	c
to	c
£	c
1000	c
,	c
you	c
would	i
be	c
shocked	c
and	c
regret	c
what	c
you	c
had	i
done	c
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
I	c
believe	c
that	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
if	c
you	c
accidently	i
meet	i
a	c
bad	c
situation	c
or	c
you	c
can	i
not	i
control	c
your	c
expenditure	c
carefully	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mister	i
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
from	c
Paris	c
where	c
I	c
live	c
.	c

My	c
wife	c
and	c
I	c
are	c
both	c
found	i
of	c
theatre	c
,	c
musical	i
shows	i
especially	c
.	c

And	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
pay	c
£	c
20	c
each	i
seat	c
.	c

The	c
great	c
Danny	c
Brooks	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
be	c
the	c
main	c
character	c
.	c

But	c
,	c
instead	c
of	c
him	c
,	c
we	c
saw	c
an	c
unknown	c
actor	c
(	c
who	c
really	c
need	i
singing	c
lessons	c
)	c
.	c

But	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

My	c
brother	c
was	c
too	c
talkative	c
!	c

It	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
be	c
a	c
gift	c
for	c
twenty	c
years	c
of	c
marriage	c
.	c

And	c
,	c
less	c
than	c
five	c
minutes	c
later	c
,	c
our	c
mother	c
knew	c
the	c
whole	c
thing	c
.	c

Her	c
reaction	c
was	c
not	c
the	c
one	c
we	c
were	c
expecting	c
.	c

She	c
thought	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
stupid	c
idea	c
,	c
and	c
also	c
an	c
expensive	c
one	c
.	c

Then	c
,	c
we	c
decided	c
to	c
offer	i
her	c
a	c
red	c
bicycle	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
happy	c
that	c
I	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
-	c
two	c
weeks	c
at	c
camp	i
California	c
in	c
USA	i
.	c

Also	c
I	c
am	c
pleased	c
,	i
that	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
to	c
pay	c
any	c
expenses	c
.	c

It	i
is	i
convenient	i
for	i
me	i
the	i
last	i
two	i
weeks	i
of	i
July	i
.	c

Hopefull	i
I	c
will	c
meet	c
some	c
other	c
girls	c
in	i
the	c
same	c
sport	c
.	c

So	c
we	c
all	i
play	i
as	c
a	c
team	c
.	c

Please	c
give	c
me	c
a	c
rough	c
idea	c
how	c
much	c
spending	c
money	c
I	c
will	c
need	c
.	c

As	c
a	c
housewife	c
I	c
have	c
a	c
good	c
idea	i
about	i
it	i
.	c

Once	c
a	c
week	c
I	c
go	c
shopping	c
.	c

Sometimes	c
I	c
go	c
two	i
days	i
We	i
all	c
have	c
to	c
do	c
our	c
shopping	c
.	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
because	c
we	c
spend	c
money	c
.	c

Usually	c
much	i
more	i
money	i
we	i
spend	i
than	c
we	c
expect	c
.	c

We	c
ca	c
n't	c
do	c
anything	c
about	c
is	i
.	c

According	c
to	c
your	c
letter	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
choose	c
two	c
activities	c
to	c
do	c
at	c
the	c
Camp	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
not	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
playing	c
tennis	c
,	c
so	c
could	c
you	c
tell	c
me	c
if	c
I	c
can	c
learn	c
at	c
the	c
camp	c
?	c

Please	c
could	c
you	c
also	c
let	c
me	c
know	c
if	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
take	c
special	c
clothes	c
with	c
me	c
?	c

'	c
Cry	c
Freedom	c
'	c
is	c
about	c
the	c
blacks	c
and	c
whites	c
of	c
South	c
Africa	c
.	c

Woods	c
is	c
thought	c
to	c
stand	c
for	c
all	c
of	i
white	c
peope	i
and	c
this	c
book	c
could	c
have	c
an	c
influence	c
on	c
them	c
.	c

In	c
some	c
ways	c
,	c
he	c
did	c
not	c
agree	c
with	c
"	c
Black	c
Consciousness	c
"	c
which	c
is	c
Biko	c
's	c
organization	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
too	c
much	c
against	c
the	c
whites	c
.	c

Most	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
this	c
book	c
will	c
make	c
you	c
think	c
about	c
the	c
prejudice	c
you	c
have	c
.	c

Thanking	c
you	c
,	c
Yours	c
sincerely	c

I	c
spend	i
two	c
weeks	c
preparing	c
all	i
the	c
stage	c
,	c
speakers	c
,	c
background	i
,	c
michrophones	i
,	c
everything	c
with	i
all	c
the	c
staff	c
,	c
and	c
every	c
night	c
,	i
the	c
artists	c
came	c
to	c
rehearsal	i
their	c
show	c
,	i
I	c
could	c
see	c
how	c
they	c
really	c
improved	c
,	c
and	c
how	c
nice	c
they	c
were	c
with	c
the	c
staff	c
.	c

What	c
I	c
personally	c
liked	c
the	c
most	c
was	c
all	c
our	c
teamwork	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
see	c
the	c
staff	c
,	c
managers	c
,	c
artists	c
and	c
even	c
the	c
director	c
,	c
all	c
like	i
a	c
big	c
team	c
,	c
working	c
together	c
.	c

Try	c
it	c
,	c
I	c
recommend	c
it	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

You	c
should	c
have	c
at	c
least	c
informed	c
the	c
public	c
because	c
most	c
of	c
the	c
people	c
came	i
to	c
see	c
him	c
.	c

The	c
times	i
were	i
not	c
respected	c
:	c
the	c
show	c
began	c
45	c
minutes	c
late	c
.	c

Finally	c
your	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
too	c
few	c
people	c
came	i
before	i
.	c

For	c
these	c
reasons	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
have	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
a	c
"	c
perfect	c
evening	c
"	c
as	c
you	c
said	c
.	c

But	c
cars	c
created	i
pollution	c
:	c
for	c
exemple	i
the	c
green	i
house	i
effect	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
there	c
is	c
a	c
link	c
between	c
technology	c
and	c
sciences	i
because	c
they	c
need	c
each	c
other	c
:	c
sciences	i
discover	c
technologies	c
and	c
technologies	c
make	c
possible	i
new	i
searches	i
in	i
sciences	i
.	c

Furthermore	c
we	c
can	c
find	c
everything	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
.	c

Anybody	i
told	c
us	c
why	c
they	c
was	i
n't	i
there	c
.	c

Like	i
mentioned	c
in	c
the	c
newspaper	c
I	i
did	c
n't	c
have	c
a	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
and	c
I	c
ask	c
you	c
to	c
give	c
me	c
back	c
my	c
money	c
.	c

The	c
day	c
after	c
I	c
get	c
everything	c
at	c
home	c
by	c
post	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
I	c
will	c
help	c
them	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
sure	c
I	c
will	c
!	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
there	c
were	c
no	c
discounts	c
available	c
,	c
and	c
having	c
payed	i
£	c
20	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
wait	c
45	c
minutes	c
longer	c
than	c
expected	c
since	c
the	c
show	c
began	c
at	c
20:15	c
and	c
not	c
at	c
19:30	c
.	c

His	c
acting	c
and	c
singing	c
was	i
horrible	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
,	c

And	c
if	c
he	c
had	c
been	c
able	c
to	c
keep	c
one	c
,	c
the	c
following	c
story	c
would	c
n't	c
have	c
happened	c
.	c

She	c
was	c
quite	c
clever	c
and	c
had	c
known	c
everything	c
about	c
this	c
,	c
so	c
she	c
had	c
taken	i
copies	c
for	c
her	c
classmates	c
and	c
everybody	c
was	c
prepared	c
.	c

Or	c
can	c
you	c
keep	c
a	c
secret	c
?	c

Dear	c
Mr.	c
.	c

.	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
n't	c
stay	c
any	c
more	i
and	c
had	c
to	c
leave	c
the	c
theatre	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
one	c
hand	c
there	c
are	c
the	c
materials	c
from	c
which	c
the	c
PC	i
's	i
are	c
made	c
of	i
,	c
on	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
is	c
the	c
uge	i
waste	c
problem	c
situated	i
.	c

Now	c
I	c
try	c
to	c
show	c
,	c
in	c
my	c
daily	c
work	c
,	c
how	c
the	c
airborn	c
chlororganics	c
,	c
which	c
are	c
degased	i
from	c
plastics	c
,	c
will	c
be	c
seperated	i
and	c
damaged	c
by	c
green	c
plants	c
.	c

I	i
'm	i
enjoy	c
playing	c
both	c
of	c
them	c
regularly	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
this	c
statement	c
is	c
true	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
suitable	c
for	c
children	c
whose	c
age	i
is	i
under	c
18	c
!	c

I	c
really	c
enjoyed	c
the	c
plays	c
and	c
films	c
,	i
I	c
wonder	c
if	c
there	c
would	i
be	c
more	c
next	c
year	c
?	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
surprised	c
when	c
I	c
saw	c
them	c
in	c
your	c
country	c
.	c

Usually	c
they	c
know	c
what	c
they	c
're	c
allowed	c
to	c
do	c
or	c
not	c
and	c
if	c
they	c
do	c
n't	c
respect	c
it	c
,	c
the	c
teacher	c
not	c
only	c
punishes	c
them	c
(	c
not	i
always	c
)	c
but	c
also	c
speaks	c
with	c
them	c
.	c

Well	c
,	c
I	c
hope	c
I	c
've	c
helped	c
you	c
a	c
little	c
and	c
I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

Another	c
thing	c
is	c
that	c
I	c
took	c
a	c
particular	c
amount	c
of	c
money	c
to	c
buy	c
a	i
tickets	c
and	c
when	c
I	c
apeared	i
infrant	i
of	c
casses	i
I	c
found	c
out	c
that	c
the	c
cost	c
of	c
tickets	i
on	i
your	c
advertisement	c
and	c
real	i
price	c
was	i
n't	i
the	c
same	c
,	c
real	i
price	c
was	c
much	c
higher	c
.	c

Also	c
show	i
started	c
very	c
late	c
compere	i
to	c
what	c
was	c
writen	i
on	i
the	c
advertisement	c
.	c

And	c
I	c
think	c
you	c
know	c
how	c
it	c
is	c
just	c
sit	i
and	c
wait	i
for	c
45min	i
.	i

So	c
,	c
after	c
all	c
of	c
that	c
,	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
nice	c
relaxing	c
diner	i
in	c
your	c
restaurant	c
,	i
I	c
was	c
very	c
angry	c
when	c
I	c
apeared	i
infrant	i
of	c
closed	c
doors	c
and	c
there	c
was	c
a	c
notice	c
,	i
that	c
the	c
restaurant	c
was	c
n't	c
working	i
.	c

Begin	c
at	c
the	c
begining	i
.	c

Look	c
at	c
historical	i
books	c
400-600	i
years	c
ago	c
,	c
or	c
even	c
in	i
time	i
of	c
First	i
and	c
Second	c
World	c
War	i
,	c
how	i
are	i
sociaty	i
changed	i
,	c
just	c
because	c
we	c
did	i
step	i
up	c
in	i
the	c
science	i
and	c
technology	c
.	c

Computer	i
it	i
is	c
our	c
way	c
of	c
with	i
outside	i
world	i
comunicat	i
,	c
wheres	i
with	c
airplanes	i
we	c
can	c
rich	i
our	c
parents	c
,	i
friends	c
easily	c
and	c
much	c
faster	c
,	i
then	i
if	i
we	i
would	i
use	i
bouts	i
or	c
trains	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
never	c
been	c
in	i
the	c
USA	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
this	c
travel	i
will	c
be	c
an	c
unforgetable	i
experience	c
.	c

After	c
august	i
I	c
must	c
return	c
to	c
school	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
can	c
only	c
go	c
to	c
California	c
in	c
July	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
because	c
I	c
like	c
very	i
much	i
the	i
nature	i
and	i
camping	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
better	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
than	c
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
.	c

Although	c
all	c
the	c
activities	c
that	c
you	c
mention	c
are	c
very	c
interesting	c
,	c
I	c
prefer	c
swimming	c
and	c
tennis	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
good	c
in	i
swimming	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
how	c
the	c
weather	c
will	c
be	c
in	c
July	c
and	c
which	i
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
wear	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
the	i
money	i
that	i
I	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
and	c
which	i
amount	c
of	c
money	c
is	c
normally	c
spent	c
in	c
the	c
camp	c
.	c

Silvia	c
Torroja	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
shopping	c
is	c
even	c
more	c
boring	c
when	c
you	c
go	c
with	c
a	c
friend	c
and	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
give	c
her	c
some	c
advice	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
shopping	c
could	c
be	c
a	c
'	c
dangerous	c
'	c
activity	c
because	c
you	c
may	c
spend	c
more	c
money	c
in	i
some	c
clothes	c
that	i
you	c
can	c
afford	c
.	c

Despite	c
shopping	c
is	i
boring	c
I	i
think	c
that	c
it	c
is	c
necessary	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
important	c
for	c
people	c
to	c
have	c
several	c
clothes	i
and	c
also	c
suitable	c
clothes	c
for	c
a	c
very	c
important	c
meeting	c
or	c
appointment	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
enjoyable	c
,	c
but	c
necessary	c
.	c

But	c
last	c
week	c
we	c
have	i
seen	i
an	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
.	c

We	c
would	c
be	c
very	c
interesting	i
in	c
seeing	c
the	i
english	i
fashion	c
.	c

About	c
the	c
programme	c
,	c
we	c
suggest	c
to	i
see	i
the	c
show	c
on	c
the	c
Tuesday	c
morning	c
and	c
after	i
to	i
do	i
shopping	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
wo	c
n't	c
be	c
too	c
angry	c
for	i
this	c
changing	i
but	c
we	c
would	c
all	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

Waiting	c
for	c
your	c
answer	c
,	c
receive	i
our	i
greetings	i
.	i

General	i
speaking	c
,	c
homes	c
will	c
change	c
considerably	c
.	c

Homes	c
like	c
this	c
will	c
be	c
build	i
with	c
the	c
latest	c
technologies	c
and	c
very	i
luxurious	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
a	c
musical	c
show	i
I	c
went	c
one	i
week	c
ago	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
really	c
disappointed	c
when	c
I	c
realised	c
that	c
the	c
actor	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
was	c
not	c
performing	c
due	i
to	i
personal	c
reasons	c
,	i
I	c
like	c
this	c
actor	c
very	c
much	c
and	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
the	c
same	c
without	c
him	c
.	c

Looking	c
forward	c
to	c
receiving	c
your	c
prompt	c
reply	c
.	c

How	c
has	c
modern	c
technology	c
changed	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
?	c

Nowadays	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
fact	c
that	c
my	c
life	c
would	c
n't	c
be	c
the	c
same	c
without	c
my	c
PC	c
.	c

After	c
I	c
got	c
connected	c
to	c
the	c
Internet	c
my	c
life	c
has	i
completely	c
changed	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
our	c
class	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
our	c
special	c
thanks	c
about	i
the	c
programme	c
you	c
gave	c
us	c
yesterday	c
afternoon	c
.	c

The	c
main	c
purpose	c
of	c
our	c
letter	c
it	i
's	i
to	c
explain	c
about	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
.	c

.	c

After	c
being	i
discussing	c
,	i
we	c
want	c
to	c
suggest	c
how	c
we	c
think	c
the	c
programme	c
should	c
be	c
re-arranged	c
.	c

Agatha	c
Christie	c
always	i
was	i
my	c
favourite	c
writer	c
.	c

Not	c
only	c
because	c
she	c
's	c
famous	c
or	i
wrote	c
lots	c
of	c
books	c
,	c
but	c
she	c
knows	c
how	c
to	c
introduce	c
caracthers	i
or	i
how	c
to	c
tell	c
a	c
good	c
story	c
us	i
though	i
decieving	i
the	c
readers	c
.	c

In	i
our	i
words	i
the	c
story	c
is	c
settled	i
on	c
a	c
train	c
wich	i
tooks	i
a	i
trip	i
along	i
the	c
orient	c
.	c

I	c
read	c
it	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
really	c
enjoyed	c
it	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
strange	i
thing	c
!	c

I	c
ca	c
n't	c
believe	c
she	c
said	c
that	c
,	i
I	c
was	c
at	c
the	i
Maria	c
's	c
party	c
and	c
'	i
cause	i
of	i
my	i
distraction	i
,	c
I	c
said	i
Pat	c
that	c
I	c
had	c
lost	c
the	i
Jon	c
's	c
shirt	c
.	c

He	c
's	c
my	c
best	c
friend	c
and	c
so	c
he	c
wanted	c

CATHEGORY	i

I	c
am	c
very	c
happy	c
to	c
have	c
won	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
and	c
want	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
that	c
very	c
interesting	c
competition	c
.	c

You	c
asked	c
me	c
which	c
accommodation	i
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
between	c
tent	i
and	c
log	i
cabin	c
.	c

Now	c
let	c
's	c
speak	c
about	c
the	c
most	c
interesting	c
activity	c
:	c
sport	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Sometimes	c
it	c
is	c
necessary	c
and	c
sometimes	c
not	c
and	c
overall	c
it	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

You	c
do	c
n't	c
like	c
shopping	c
but	c
you	c
must	c
go	c
shopping	c
to	c
eat	c
!	c

And	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
even	c
got	i
paid	c
.	c

After	c
been	i
carrying	c
stuff	c
like	c
lights	c
,	c
microphones	c
,	c
wires	c
and	c
some	c
other	c
equipment	c
for	c
about	c
three	c
hours	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
eshausted	i
.	c

For	c
de	i
accommodation	c
I	c
prefer	i
a	c
long	i
cabin	c
because	c
it	i
's	i
more	c
comfortable	c
.	c

I	c
recognise	i
that	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
sleep	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
but	c
in	i
this	c
moment	c
I	c
have	c
a	c
little	c
problem	c
with	c
my	c
right	c
leg	c
and	c
it	c
's	c
better	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
sleep	c
in	c
a	c
bed	c
.	c

I	c
know	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
the	c
chance	c
to	c
do	c
two	c
activities	c
during	c
this	c
time	i
.	c

The	i
weather	i
I	i
hope	i
will	c
be	c
good	c
so	c
I	c
suppose	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
bring	c
short	i
clothes	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
very	c
enthousiastic	i
and	c
I	c
attend	i
your	i
answer	i
as	i
soon	i
is	i
possible	i
.	c

There	c
are	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
people	c
who	c
spend	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
money	c
because	c
they	c
like	c
shopping	c
.	c

The	i
money	i
is	c
important	c
but	c
we	c
have	c
to	c
know	c
how	c
to	c
spend	c
it	c
:	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c

AUTHORITIES	c
OF	c
THE	c
CIRCLE	c
THEATRE	c
:	c

IT	c
WAS	c
REALLY	c
DISAPPOINTING	c
.	c

WHEN	c
IT	c
STARTED	c
I	c
COULD	c
SEE	c
THAT	c
DANNY	c
BROOK	c
WAS	c
N'T	c
IN	c
THE	c
PLAY	c
,	c
AND	c
NOBODY	c
TOLD	c
US	c
WHY	c

FINALLY	c
,	c
WHEN	c
THE	c
PLAY	c
FINISHED	c
,	c
WE	c
WENT	c
TO	c
THE	c
THEATRE	c
RESTAURANT	c
TO	c
HAVE	c
DINNER	c
BUT	c
IT	c
WAS	c
CLOSED	c
.	c

HER	c
FATHER	c
ACCEPTED	c
WITH	i
THE	i
TIME	i
.	c

I	c
live	c
and	c
I	c
need	c
different	c
goods	i
for	i
survive	i
.	c

I	c
need	c
material	i
for	i
drinking	i
and	i
eating	i
,	i
that	i
is	c
the	c
basic	c
fact	c
that	c
I	i
must	c
go	c
shopping	c
for	c
food	c
.	c

This	i
is	c
the	i
fact	c
that	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
,	c

It	c
is	i
said	i
that	i
the	i
singers	i
are	i
Danny	i
Brook	i
and	i
Tina	i
Truelove	i
in	i
the	i
advertisement	i
.	c

However	c
,	c
there	c
was	c
a	c
different	c
unknown	i
actor	c
in	c
that	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
unsatisfied	c
and	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
for	c
some	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

Although	c
some	c
may	c
appears	i
again	c
after	c
few	i
years	c
different	i
styles	c
are	c
developed	c
.	c

For	i
the	c
colours	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
the	i
metalic	i
colours	c
,	c
especially	c
silver	c
,	c
will	c
be	c
the	c
most	c
popular	c
.	c

It	c
made	i
me	i
disappointed	i
very	c
much	c
.	c

I	c
suppose	c
that	c
a	c
scientist	c
could	c
invent	c
new	c
kinds	c
of	c
materials	c
which	c
are	c
warm	c
and	c
thick	c
.	c

The	c
animal-pattern	i
is	c
catching	c
up	i
now	c
.	c

It	c
might	c
be	c
possible	c
that	c
the	c
fish-pattern	i
come	i
up	i
in	c
100	c
years	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
fashion	c
changes	c
too	c
fast	c
to	c
predict	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
three	i
days	i
programme	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
your	c
good	i
programme	c
,	c
especially	i
for	c
visiting	i
The	i
National	c
Art	c
Gallery	c
.	c

We	c
saw	c
an	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
and	c
our	c
class	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
of	i
recieving	i
a	c
letter	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Bye	i

I	c
think	c
more	c
and	c
more	c
people	c
will	c
have	c
at	c
least	c
one	c
flat	c
,	i
does	i
n't	i
matter	c
if	c
you	c
are	c
rich	c
or	c
not	c
.	c

The	c
rooms	c
will	c
be	c
designed	c
in	c
a	c
future	i
fashion	i
like	i
less	c
furniture	c
and	c
everything	c
is	i
compact	c
,	i
even	i
TV-set	i
will	c
be	c
on	c
the	c
ciling	i
.	c

If	c
course	c
if	c
you	c
have	c
enough	c
money	c
to	i
let	i
your	i
self	i
live	i
in	c
such	c
apartments	i
,	c
then	c
you	c
can	c
afford	c
it	c
.	c

Now	c
what	c
's	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
the	c
same	c
.	i

It	i
is	i
now	i
ten	i
years	i
that	i
Internet	i
exists	i
,	c
but	c
we	c
only	c
used	i
it	c
for	c
army	c
and	c
government	c
.	i

The	i
modern	i
technology	c
has	c
changed	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
in	i
every	c
day	c
.	c

There	c
have	i
also	i
taken	i
place	i
very	c
good	c
attractions	i
like	c
dance	i
shows	c
,	c
the	c
art	c
exhibition	c
and	c
listening	i
to	i
talks	i
by	i
writers	c
,	i

The	c
reasonably-priced	c
weekend	c
ticket	c
was	c
a	c
very	c
good	c
idea	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
say	c
the	c
simplest	c
way	c
is	c
to	c
give	c
lessons	c
to	c
pupils	c
,	c
for	c
example	c
,	c
maths	i
or	c
english	i
.	c

But	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
after	c
some	i
lessons	c
the	c
pupils	c
will	c
see	c
that	c
it	c
is	c
better	c
if	c
they	c
sit	c
down	c
and	c
learn	c
their	c
stuff	c
.	c

Not	c
everybody	c
has	c
the	c
ability	c
to	c
understand	c
everything	c
at	c
once	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
if	c
you	c
like	c
to	c
b	i
with	c
people	c
and	c
help	c
them	c
and	c
if	c
you	c
have	c
talent	i
to	c
explain	c
good	i
then	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
the	i
best	c
,	i
if	c
you	c
offer	i
your	c
help	c
to	c
the	c
people	c
!	c

I	c
play	c
every	c
saturday	i
and	c
Sunday	c
after	i
that	c
,	c
I	c
usually	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
pool	c
because	c
I	c
love	c
swimming	c
,	i
I	c
think	c
that	c
those	c
sports	i
I	c
will	i
like	c
to	c
practice	i
at	c
the	c
Camp	c
.	c

Most	c
of	c
the	c
time	c
when	c
we	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
shopping	c
Center	i
we	c
have	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
fun	c
,	i
we	i
go	c
to	c
stores	c
to	c
see	i
cloth	i
,	c
we	c
also	c
eat	c
something	c
like	c
ice	c
cream	c
or	c
French	c
Fries	c
,	c
but	c
not	i
all	i
the	i
time	i
shopping	i
is	i
enjoyable	i
.	c

In	i
that	i
cases	i
is	i
when	i
we	c
do	c
n't	c
enjoy	c
shopping	c
because	c
we	c
ca	c
n't	c
find	c
what	c
we	c
are	c
looking	c
for	c
and	c
we	c
have	c
a	c
bad	c
time	c
in	c
the	c
shopping	c
center	i
.	c

About	c
accommodation	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
the	c
log	c
cabins	c
because	c
I	c
think	c
they	c
are	c
more	i
cleaner	i
than	c
the	c
tents	c
.	c

And	c
of	c
course	c
,	c
the	c
time	c
to	c
pay	c
.	c

Your	i
sincerely	c
,	c

I	c
prefer	c
playing	c
rugby	c
and	c
going	c
out	c
with	c
friends	c
,	c
because	c
technology	c
is	c
not	c
all	c
life	i
,	c
but	c
it	c
is	c
only	c
a	c
little	c
part	c
of	c
it	c
.	c

In	c
fact	c
,	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
did	c
n't	c
play	i
or	c
appear	c
on	c
stage	c
last	c
Tuesday	c
,	c
the	i
role	c
was	c
played	c
by	c
another	c
-	c
a	c
quite	c
bad	c
-	c
actor	c
,	c
less	c
famous	c
than	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
.	c

I	c
started	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
new	c
friends	c
,	c
they	c
all	c
wanted	c
to	c
be	c
my	c
best	c
friend	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
not	c
easy	c
to	c
keep	c
such	c
an	c
enormous	c
secret	c
and	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
keep	c
it	c
inside	c
of	i
me	c
.	c

I	c
became	i
quickly	i
bored	c
by	c
this	c
hypocrital	i
attention	c
they	c
had	i
for	i
me	c
.	c

I	c
always	c
has	i
been	c
involved	c
in	c
many	c
differents	i
associations	c
,	c
which	c
are	c
fighting	c
against	c
AIDS	c
or	c
cancer	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
ask	c
about	c
your	c
advertisement	c
and	c
theatre	c
show	c
.	c

Also	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
certain	c
to	i
me	c
to	i
bought	i
a	c
discount	c
tickets	i
cause	i
I	c
am	c
a	c
student	c
.	c

However	c
the	i
show	c
started	c
45	c
minutes	c
later	c
.	c

Could	c
you	c
do	i
me	c
my	i
half	i
of	i
money	c
back	c
.	i

I	c
enclose	c
my	c
phone	c
number	c
and	c
address	c

I	c
'm	c

but	c
in	i
the	i
other	i
hand	i
sometimes	c
you	c
can	c
have	c
fun	c
at	i
it	c

For	c
example	c
a	i
lot	c
of	c
people	c
do	c
not	c
like	c
to	c
do	i
shopping	c
in	c
big	c

Yes	c

Nower	i
days	i
tecnical	i
progress	c
gets	c
close	c
to	c
us	c
,	c
to	c
usual	i
custumers	i

It	c
will	c
be	c
a	c
wonderful	c
experience	c
to	c
swim	c
in	c
a	c
lake	c
and	c
I	c
can	c
relax	c
and	c
enjoy	c
fresh	i

And	c
I	c
want	c

I	c
took	c

Dear	c

As	c

of	c
the	c
audience	c
's	c

It	c

everyday	i
I	c
met	c
different	c
people	c
who	c
like	c
listening	c
the	i
pop	i

so	c
we	c

I	c
suppose	c
I	c
will	c
have	c
more	c
contact	c
with	c
natural	c
things	c
than	c
in	c
log	i
cabins	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
look	i
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
happy	c
with	c
your	c
letter	c
that	c
I	c
received	c
last	c
week	c
.	c

A	c
friend	c
of	c
me	i
gave	c
up	c
one	c
week	c
before	c
and	c
asked	c
me	c
if	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
in	c
his	c
place	c
.	c

With	c
best	c
wishes	c
,	c

I	c
would	c
love	c
to	c
participate	c
in	c
the	c
singing	c
and	c
photography	c
activities	c
.	c

If	c
people	c
would	c
think	c
about	c
it	c
BEFORE	c
going	c
shopping	c
,	c
they	c
would	c
not	c
have	c
a	c
headache	c
when	c
they	c
go	c
home	c
and	c
realize	c
they	c
did	c
not	c
want	c
what	c
they	c
bought	c
.	c

Recommendations	c
?	c

At	c
the	c
camp	c
I	c
will	i
like	c
to	c
choose	c
two	c
activities	c
,	c
Painting	c
and	c
Singing	c
,	i
I	c
love	c
painting	c
,	i
in	i
the	i
university	c
I	c
studied	c
art	c
for	c
two	c
years	c
,	c
but	c
now	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
much	c
time	c
to	c
paint	c
couse	i
I	c
work	c
in	c
a	c
bank	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
a	c
baby	c
.	c

You	c
are	c
never	c
going	c
to	c
believe	c
what	c
I	c
did	c
last	c
month	c
I	i
was	c
walking	c
with	c
my	c
sister	c
in	c
Oxford	c
circus	c
,	c
when	c
sudently	i
a	c
man	c
stop	i
us	c
saying	c
that	c
he	c
was	c
looking	c
for	c
people	c
to	c
help	c
in	i
a	c
concert	c
and	c
they	c
was	i
going	c
to	c
pay	c
us	c
five	c
pounds	c
an	c
hour	c
.	c

We	c
sed	i
yes	c
inmidiatly	i
,	i
I	c
nearly	c
shouted	c
of	i
happines	i
when	c
they	c
told	c
us	c
that	c
,	i
Luis	c
Miguel	c
was	c
doing	i
the	c
concert	c
,	i
he	i
is	c
my	c
favorite	i
singer	c
.	c

I	c
hop	i
you	c
write	c
me	i
soon	c
to	c
tall	i
me	c
youre	i
opinion	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
the	c
advertisement	c
was	i
totally	c
different	c
of	i
what	c
I	c
saw	c
there	c
.	c

I	c
wonder	c
you	i
could	c
explain	c
me	i
why	c
.	c

Márcia	c

There	c
is	c
ambiguity	i
about	c
technology	c
-	c
can	i
bring	i
good	c
things	c
and	c
terrible	c
things	c
as	c
well	c
.	c

Because	c
,	i
at	i
first	i
when	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
little	c
child	c
we	c
were	i
staying	i
every	i
holiday	i
in	i
a	i
small	i
house	i
and	c
I	c
like	c
that	c
.	c

At	i
second	i
,	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
like	c
tents	c
and	c
I	c
do	i
n't	i
get	c
used	c
to	c
it	i
,	c
so	c
I	c
prefer	c
log	c
cabins	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
summer	c
I	c
'm	c
sailing	c
races	i
almost	c
every	c
weekend	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
my	c
own	c
sailing	c
clothes	c
.	c

How	c
are	c
you	c
?	c

The	c
most	i
beautiful	i
things	c
were	c
that	c
we	c
saw	c
famous	c
singers	c
and	c
I	c
spoke	c
with	c
Robbie	c
Williams	c
.	c

Another	c
thing	c
I	c
have	i
done	i
was	c
the	c
make	i
up	i
only	i
for	c
about	c
fifteen	c
minutes	c
.	c

At	i
first	i
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
go	i
travel	c
on	i
July	c
,	c
because	c
before	c
them	i
I	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
time	c
to	c
travel	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
log	i
cabin	c
.	c

And	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
chance	c
about	i
painting	i
and	c
photography	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
not	c
so	c
fit	c
and	c
well	i
condition	i
,	c
so	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
like	c
to	c
do	c
activitily	i
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
invitation	c

Yours	c

Moreover	c
you	i
bought	c
something	c
then	c
you	c
could	c
find	c
it	c

a	c

have	c
recently	c

on	c
a	i

I	c

free-time	i
going	c
to	c
the	c

I	c
'm	c
not	c
keen	c
on	c

and	i
I	c
think	c
that	c
you	c
've	c
lied	c
to	c
such	i
naive	c
tourist	i
like	c
us	c
:	c
some	c
brilliant	c
actors	c
were	c
supposed	c
to	c
play	c
the	c
part	i
and	c
we	c
only	c
had	c
different	c
and	i
pityful	i
ones	c

Foolish	c
idiots	c

Nowadays	c
,	c
the	c
Internet	c
and	c
the	c

with	i

;	i
I	c

I	c

to	c

in	c
a	c

Even	c
though	c
Pat	c
has	c
got	c
a	c
great	c
sense	c
of	c
humour	c
and	c
wonderful	c
personality	c
,	c
he	c
'll	c
never	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
keep	c
any	c
secreats	i
for	i
anyone	c
,	c
even	c
himself	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
there	c
was	c
a	c
different	c
actor/actress	c
who	i
I	i
have	i
never	i
heard	i
their	i
name	i
before	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
nowadays	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
easy	c
to	c
find	c
me	c
because	c
of	c
mobile-phone	i
.	c

I	c
just	c
check	c
my	c
e-mail	c
before	c
going	c
to	c
bed	c
everyday	i
.	c

First	c
I	c
can	c
travel	c
only	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
,	i
I	c
will	c
finish	c
school	c
at	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
June	c
and	c
I	c
will	c
pass	i
my	c
exam	c
in	c
Septemeber	i
;	c
so	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
repeat	i
it	i
a	c
lot	c
during	c
the	c
month	c
of	c
August	c
.	c

Thanks	c
for	c
all	i

I	c
'm	c
sorry	c
I	c
can	c
only	c
write	c
now	c
because	c
last	c
week	c
I	c
have	i
too	c
much	c
work	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
asked	c
me	c
I	c
will	c
tell	c
you	c
about	c
the	c
pop	c
concert	c
of	i
last	c
month	c
.	c

With	c
my	c
friend	c
Miko	c
we	i
looked	c
for	c
a	i
little	i
job	i
during	i
a	i
week-end	i
and	c
one	c
evening	c
we	c
met	c
a	c
guy	c
who	c
wanted	c
to	c
buy	i
some	i
drinks	c
in	i
the	c
pop	c
concert	c
and	c
so	c
we	c
told	c
him	c
that	c
we	c
were	i
agree	i
to	c
help	c
him	c
at	c
the	c
bar	c
.	c

At	c
the	c
end	c
we	c
have	i
1200.	i
-	i
of	i
benefice	i
and	c
each	c
us	i
take	i
400.	i
-	i
for	c
himself	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
could	c
not	c
buy	c
a	c
discount	c
ticket	c
as	c
you	c
mentioned	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
p.m	i
instead	c
of	c
19:30	c
p.m.	i
Thirdly	c
,	c
a	i
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
being	i
closed	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
very	i
rediculous	i
!	c

Although	i
,	i
Pat	c
is	c
very	c
smart	c
and	c
intelligent	c
.	c

She	c
enjoyed	c
sharing	c
everthing	i
with	c
Pat	c
whatever	i
what	i
it	c
was	c
.	c

As	c
they	c
went	i
to	c
getting	i
a	c
baby	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
tents	i
to	c
sleep	c
at	i
Camp	c
California	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
fun	c
to	c
sleep	c
in	c
tents	c
to	i
compare	c
in	i
a	c
house	c
.	c

Tennis	c
because	c
I	c
play	c
Tennis	i
and	c
I	c
am	c
classed	c
15-5	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
nice	c
to	c
play	c
tennis	c
outside	c
in	i
the	c
court	c
when	c
the	c
weather	c
is	c
hot	c
.	c

I	c
like	c
windsurfing	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
sport	c
of	c
speed	c
and	c
slide	i
like	c
skiing	c
,	i
surfing	c
.	c

Is	c
there	c
a	c
washing	c
machine	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
?	c

You	c
do	c
n't	c
find	c
your	i
size	i
or	i
the	i
good	i
color	i
in	i
the	i
article	i

Dear	c
Madam	c
,	c

It	c
was	c
realy	i
wonderfull	i
new	c
experience	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
very	i
nice	c
feeling	c
when	c
you	c
need	c
help	c
and	c
is	i
so	c
many	c
people	c
which	i
want	c
to	c
help	c
you	c
.	c

I	c
will	c
never	c
forget	c
this	c
concert	c
and	c
those	c
people	c
.	c

At	c
first	c
when	c
I	c
came	c
I	c
hoped	c
to	c
see	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
on	c
the	c
stage	c
,	c
but	c
there	c
was	c
totally	i
different	c
actor	c
.	c

Such	c
as	c
mobile	i
phone	c
that	c
helps	c
me	c
to	c
communicate	c
,	i
with	c
anyone	c
in	c
the	c
world	c
,	c
even	c
if	c
I	c
am	c
not	c
at	c
home	c
,	i
I	c
use	c
stereo	i
,	i
if	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
listen	c
to	c
my	c
favourite	c
music	c
,	i
I	c
use	c
tapes	c
,	c
CDs	c
,	c
hairdryers	c
,	c
ect	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
happy	c
that	c
with	c
all	c
technology	i
that	c
we	c
have	c
we	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
to	c
work	c
as	c
much	c
as	c
they	c
did	c
,	c
like	i
to	i
wash	i
plates	c
and	c
cups	c
after	c
meals	c
,	i
my	i
dishwashing	i
machine	i
will	c
do	c
that	c
for	c
me	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
to	c
wash	c
my	c
clothes	c
my	i
washing	c
machine	c
does	c
it	c
better	c
.	c

Of	c
course	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
bit	c
sad	c
that	c
machinery	c
is	c
taking	c
over	c
humans	i
and	c
of	c
course	c
it	c
makes	c
me	c
lazy	c
.	c

However	c
now	i
I	c
have	c
more	c
freedom	c
,	c
free	c
time	c
,	c
and	c
privacy	c
.	c

And	c
would	c
it	c
be	c
possible	c
to	c
do	c
swimm	i
and	c
surf	i
.	c

But	c
if	i
only	i
I	c
have	c
money	c
!	c
!	c

Because	i
I	i
do	i
n't	i
like	i
to	i
give	i
some	i
advise	i
it	i
's	i
can	i
be	i
willy	i
boring	i

Drop	c
me	c
a	c
line	c
or	c
give	c
me	c
a	c
call	c
if	c
my	c
writing	c
will	i
not	c
so	c
good	c
for	c
you	c

Both	c

I	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
your	c
answer	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

One	c
more	c
week	c
has	i
passed	i
,	c
and	c
things	c
became	c
calm	c
:	c
Ali	c
decided	c
to	i
never	i
look	c
Pat	c
on	i
the	i
fact	i
anymore	c
.	c

Poor	c
Ali.	c
.	c

This	c
thing	c
should	c
n't	c
be	i
happened	c
.	c

After	c
finished	i
watching	c
the	c
show	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
restaurant	c
which	c
you	c
advertised	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
very	c
formal	c
fashion	c
,	c
but	c
now	c
people	c
wear	c
more	c
sexy	c
clothes	c
than	c
100	c
years	c
ago	c
.	c

The	c
enviroment	i
will	c
be	c
very	c
polluted	c
and	c
finally	c
we	c
'll	c
get	c
desease	i
.	c

We	c
will	c
need	c
helmets	c
to	c
cover	c
our	c
head	i
and	c
we	c
will	c
also	c
need	c
air-supplyer	i
.	c

We	c
should	c
try	c
hard	c
to	c
create	c
new	c
fashion	c
and	c
suitable	c
fashion	c
in	c
further	i
days	i
.	c

So	c
,	c
may	c
I	c
give	c
you	c
my	c
suggestions	c
and	c
opinions	c
?	c

Because	c
it	c
does	i
not	c
complex	c
,	c
also	i
we	i
do	i
n't	i
confuse	i
.	c

If	c
you	c
can	c
improve	c
these	c
points	c
,	c
your	c
festival	c
must	i
be	c
better	c
than	c
this	c
year	c
's	c
.	c

Anyway	c
,	c
you	c
want	c
to	c
know	c
about	c
rules	c
at	c
home	c
and	c
school	c
in	c
my	c
country	c
,	c
do	c
n't	c
you	c
?	c

One	c
of	c
the	c
rules	c
of	i
my	c
friend	c
's	c
school	c
is	c
not	i
to	c
drink	c
and	i
eat	c
something	i
during	c
a	c
class	c
.	c

How	c
about	c
in	c
your	c
country	c
?	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
with	c
reference	c
to	c
a	c
musical	c
show	c
I	c
saw	c
recently	c
in	c
your	c
theatre	c
.	c

The	c
advertisement	c
promised	c
there	c
would	c
be	c
my	c
favorite	i
star	c
Danny	i
Brook	c
,	c
but	c
there	c
was	c
an	i
other	i
actor	c
who	c
could	c
not	c
play	c
his	c
part	c
as	c
well	c
as	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
In	i
addition	c
,	c
the	c
performance	c
started	c
45	c
minutes	c
later	i
,	c
so	c
we	c
could	c
n't	c
visit	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
because	c
it	c
had	i
been	i
closed	c
already	c
.	c

As	c
a	c
result	c
our	i
evening	c
was	c
completely	c
spoiled	c
.	c

All	c
fathers	i
things	c
were	c
missing	c
.	c

She	c
was	c
so	c
understanding	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
although	c
I	c
heard	c
the	i
student	c
discount	c
ticket	c
was	c
available	c
,	c
the	c
ticket	c
salesman	c
said	c
I	c
should	c
have	c
bought	c
it	i
at	c
least	c
one	c
day	c
before	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
not	c
satisfied	c
with	c
your	c
show	c
at	c
all	c
.	c

Without	c
a	c
computer	c
and	c
a	c
telephone	c
,	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
contact	c
her	c
easily	c
and	c
I	c
may	i
lose	c
touch	c
with	c
her	c
.	c

Before	c
the	c
plane	c
was	c
invested	i
,	c
I	c
suppose	c
it	c
might	c
take	i
several	c
months	c
to	c
visit	c
Britain	c
by	c
ship	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
a	c
lover	c
of	c
risk	i
sports	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
one	c
more	c
time	c
for	c
everything	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c

for	c

Cornel	c

You	c
ca	c
n't	c
imagine	c
How	i
much	c
did	i
I	c
enjoy	i
that	c
journey	i
.	c

I	c
started	c
early	c
in	c
the	c
morning	c
helping	i
to	c
carry	c
the	i
stuff	c
from	c
the	c
trucks	c
to	c
the	c
place	c
where	c
the	c
band	c
played	c
,	i
I	c
help	i
with	c
the	c
music	i
stuff	c
like	c
speakers	c
,	c
mics	c
,	c
lights	c
,	c
sound	c
,	i
etc.	c
And	c
later	c
the	c
band	c
arrived	c
and	c
played	c
two	c
or	c
three	c
times	c
before	c
the	c
concert	c
started	c
.	c

Later	c
the	c
band	c
was	c
talking	c
to	c
me	c
,	c
I	c
could	c
get	c
their	c
new	c
album	c
free	c
,	c
and	c
some	c
other	c
souvenirs	c
from	c
the	c
band	c
.	c

But	c
the	c
thing	c
that	c
particulary	i
liked	i
me	i
was	c
that	c
I	c
could	c
do	c
all	c
kind	i
of	c
things	c
just	c
in	c
one	c
day	c
and	c
I	c
could	c
feel	c
different	c
emotions	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
log	c
cabins	c
because	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
sleep	c
outside	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
.	c

I	c
know	c
how	c
to	c
swim	c
and	c
dive	c
from	c
high	c
places	c
.	c

Of	c
course	c
there	c
are	c
some	c
things	c
that	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
,	i
if	i
possible	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
shall	i
I	i
take	c
with	c
me	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
again	c

Yours	c
Sincierly	i
,	c

You	c
know	c
that	c
last	c
month	c
I	c
helped	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
and	c
I	i
've	i
enjoyed	i
it	c
very	c
much	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
I	c
helped	c
with	c
the	c
decoration	c
of	c
the	c
place	c
where	c
the	c
consert	i
would	c
take	c
place	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr.	c
Robertson	c
,	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
suggest	c
a	c
special	c
activity	c
while	c
we	c
are	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

Yours	c
Sincerely	c
,	c

However	c
,	c
in	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
famous	c
people	c
,	c
such	c
as	c
politicians	c
and	c
film	c
actors	c
,	c
deserve	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
private	c
life	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
everybody	c
has	c
rights	c
to	c
keep	c
their	c
own	c
private	i
life	i
,	c
especially	c
when	c
they	c
are	c
in	c
serious	c
situations	c
such	c
as	c
divorce	c
and	i
a	c
family	c
member	c
's	c
or	c
the	i
closest	c
friend	c
's	c
death	c
.	c

Another	c
reason	c
that	c
I	c
agree	c
famous	i
people	c
deserve	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
private	c
life	c
is	c
that	c
if	c
journalists	c
followed	c
them	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
,	c
it	c
would	c
result	c
in	c
their	c
death	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
asked	c
by	c
my	c
class	c
to	c
write	c
to	c
you	c
.	c

Having	c
seen	c
an	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
,	c
at	c
the	c
Central	c
Exhibition	c
Hall	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
14th	c
,	c
we	c
would	c
particularly	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
and	c
visit	c
it	c
.	c

How	c
wonderful	c
it	c
could	c
be	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
latest	c
fashions	c
and	c
leisure	c
and	c
sports	c
wear	c
in	c
this	c
city	c
,	c
so	c
famous	c
for	c
it	i
!	c

The	c
more	c
they	c
are	c
in	c
the	c
media	c
,	c
the	c
more	c
they	i
will	i
be	i
famous	i
.	c

However	c
,	c
some	c
others	c
only	c
use	c
the	c
media	c
to	c
come	c
back	c
,	c
because	c
they	c
cannot	c
find	c
a	c
job	c
anymore	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writeing	i
to	c
you	c
to	c
"	c
help	c
"	c
you	c
with	c
your	c
festival	c
next	c
year	c
,	i
last	i
year	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
so	c
maybe	c
we	c
can	c
make	c
it	c
more	c
atracite	i
this	c
year	c
?	i

Sincirley	i

For	c
accommodation	c
I	c
would	c
rather	i
prefer	c
log	c
cabins	c
because	c
it	i
's	i
more	c
comfortable	c
than	c
tents	c
.	c

And	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
to	c
worry	c
about	c
the	c
weather	c
.	c

And	c
my	c
dad	c
just	c
bought	c
me	c
a	c
new	c
camera	c
.	c

So	c
this	i
's	i
will	c
be	c
my	c
first	c
chance	c
that	i
I	i
can	i
use	i
it	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Hi	c
,	c
Kim	c

From	i
that	i
time	i
I	i
had	i
a	i
lot	i
of	i
friends	i
also	c
some	c
of	c
them	c
are	i
old	c
friends	c
from	c
college	c
.	c

Any	i
way	i
I	i
will	c
sent	i
you	c
some	c
photographs	c
.	c

Take	c
care	c
and	c
do	c
n't	c
work	c
too	c
hard	c
.	c

Please	c
send	i
my	c
love	c
to	c
your	c
family	c
.	c

I	c
wanted	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
play	c
as	c
quickly	c
as	c
possible	c
.	c

But	c
it	c
did	c
n't	c
.	c

On	i
the	i
other	i
hand	i
,	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
see	c
the	c
same	c
actors	c
whose	c
name	i
were	c
written	c
on	c
the	c
advertisement	c
.	c

They	c
were	c
best	c
friends	c
.	c

Her	c
father	c
never	c
let	c
her	c
to	i
have	i
a	c
boyfriend	c
.	c

Beatrice	c
was	c
18	c
and	c
she	c
could	c
manage	c
.	c

One	c
day	c
Beatrice	c
came	c
me	i
with	c
some	c
tears	c
on	c
her	c
face	c
.	c

We	c
went	c
out	c
and	c
she	c
told	c
me	c
all	c
her	c
story	c
.	c

After	c
that	c
,	c
Pat	c
had	c
told	c
everyone	c
that	c
Beatrice	c
's	c
father	c

On	i
the	c
advertisement	c
,	i
that	c
I	c
have	i
received	i
,	c
it	c
was	c
written	c
that	c
the	c
show	c
would	c
start	c
at	c
19:30	c
but	c
I	c
kept	c
wainting	i
for	c
it	c
to	c
start	c
for	c
half	c
an	c
hour	c
.	c

And	c
there	c
were	c
no	c
discounts	c
available	c
either	c
,	c
unlike	c
it	i
was	c
written	c
in	c
the	c
same	c
advertisement	c
.	c

Because	c
of	c
all	c
these	c
reasons	c
,	c
which	c
I	c
have	c
listed	c
above	c
,	c
my	c
evening	c
which	i
should	c
have	c
been	c
perfect	c
,	c
turned	c
into	c
a	c
disaster	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	i
,	c

But	c
on	i
the	i
other	i
side	i
it	c
was	c
her	c
best	c
friend	c
's	c
family	c
,	i
that	c
she	c
must	c
lie	c
to	c
.	c

Her	c
best	c
friend	c
was	c
going	c
out	c
with	c
a	c
boy	c
that	c
night	c
,	c
And	i
she	c
told	i
her	c
parents	c
that	c
she	c
was	c
going	c
to	c
stay	c
at	c
Pat	c
's	c
house	c
,	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
get	c
permission	c
.	c

And	c
she	c
realized	c
that	c
if	c
something	c
happens	i
to	c
her	c
best	c
fried	i
,	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
her	c
fault	c
and	c
her	c
best	c
friend	c
's	c
parents	c
would	c
blame	c
her	c
for	c
it	c
.	c

She	c
knew	c
she	c
would	c
be	c
very	c
sorry	c
too	c

Maybe	c
because	c
of	c
this	c
,	c
just	c
like	c
living	c
things	c
,	c
the	i
clothes	c
have	i
evolution	i
.	c

First	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
during	c
July	c
.	c

Actually	c
,	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
like	c
tent	i
so	c
much	c
.	c

I	c
love	c
shopping	c
.	c

Especially	i
,	c
I	c
prefer	c
to	c
go	c
department	i
stores	c
.	c

To	c
be	c
honest	c
,	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
always	c
buy	c
these	c
products	c
but	i
I	c
can	c
be	c
satisfied	c
with	c
just	c
looking	c
them	i
.	c

Shopping	c
helps	c
me	c
to	c
cheer	c
up	c
every	c
time	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
many	c
people	c
,	c
specially	i
women	c
,	c
had	i
same	i
experience	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
not	c
sure	c
whether	c
I	c
will	c
need	c
some	c
special	c
clothes	c
,	i
if	i
not	c
what	c
sort	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	i
should	i
bring	c
,	c
and	c
also	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
roughly	c
I	i
will	i
need	c
for	c
my	c
daily	c
expenses	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
be	c
very	c
grateful	c
for	c
your	c
help	c
and	c
advice	c
in	c
this	i
matters	c
.	c

You	c
must	c
remember	c
me	c
telling	c
you	c
about	c
the	c
pop	c
concert	c
,	i
well	i
now	c
that	c
it	c
's	c
over	c
I	c
have	c
time	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
everything	c
about	c
it	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
once	c
they	c
wanted	c
mineral	c
water	c
of	c
a	c
certain	c
French	c
label	c
,	i
which	c
was	c
impossible	c
to	c
get	c
.	c

I	c
really	c
enjoyed	c
working	c
with	c
those	c
people	c
,	i
they	i
are	c
all	c
very	c
professional	c
although	c
they	c
may	c
look	c
a	c
bit	c
eccentric	c
sometimes	c
.	c

The	c
reasons	i
I	c
am	c
really	c
writing	c
,	c
However	i
,	c
is	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
some	c
details	c
of	i
my	c
trip	c
to	c
California	c
.	c

I	c
wonder	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
send	c
me	c
more	c
information	c
about	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
have	i
we	i
bring	i
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

In	c
order	c
to	c
celebrate	c
the	c
125	i
aniversary	i
of	c
the	c
city	c
,	c
the	c
Coun	i
Council	c
organised	c
an	c
open	c
air	c
concert	c
.	c

I	c
knew	c
some	c
help	c
was	c
needed	c
so	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
speak	c
to	c
the	c
manager	c
.	c

K.	c
if	i
you	c
want	c
to	c
help	c
,	c
here	c
is	c
a	c
list	c
of	c
what	c
you	c
can	c
do.	c
"	c

Perhaps	c
I	c
could	c
show	c
you	c
the	c
pictures	c
I	c
took	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
arrangements	c
for	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
.	c

I	c
thought	c
about	c
you	c
while	c
reading	c
the	c
book	c
because	c
I	c
remembered	c
you	c
have	c
booked	c
a	c
place	c
in	i
a	c
Detective	c
course	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
sure	c
that	c
if	c
you	c
listen	c
to	c
it	c
you	c
will	c
start	c
reading	c
the	c
book	c
immediately	c
,	c
and	c
find	c
out	c
there	c
many	i
challenges	c
for	i
your	c
new	c
carreer	i
.	c

Although	i
,	c
living	i
in	c
the	i
tent	c
is	c
more	c
comfortable	c
.	c

First	c
,	c
how	c
many	c
clothes	c
do	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
bring	c
?	c

Your	i
sincerely	c

I	c
have	c
an	c
interesting	c
story	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
.	c

I	c
've	c
been	c
asked	c
to	c
help	i
by	i
the	c
well	i
known	i
band	c
called	i
Westlife	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
really	c
embarassed	i
because	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
dance	c
in	c
front	c
of	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
people	c
but	c
that	c
is	i
the	c
very	c
good	i
experience	c
I	c
have	c
ever	c
had	c
.	c

Thing	i
that	c
I	c
particularly	c
like	i
in	i
the	c
concert	c
is	i
I	c
got	c
a	c
free	c
ticket	c
from	c
Westlife	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
A1	c
concert	c
which	i
is	c
another	c
well	i
known	i
band	c
.	c

Tell	c
me	c
yoors	i

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
inform	c
you	c
about	c
The	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
show	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
14th	c
March	c
at	i
10.00	c
-	c
19.00	c
.	c

This	c
is	c
great	i
oppotunity	i
for	c
me	c
to	c
explore	c
and	c
experience	c
London	c
myself	c
especially	i
,	i
The	c
London	c
fashion	c
and	c
leisure	c
shows	c
.	c

There	c
were	c
hundrend	i
of	c
Thai	c
students	c
were	i
waiting	c
for	i
doing	i
this	c
test	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
afraid	c
of	c
the	c
hieght	i
and	c
was	c
very	c
nervous	c
.	c

Accommodation	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
is	c
in	c
tents	c
or	c
log	c
cabins	c
,	i
I	c
think	c
I	c
prefer	i
both	c
of	c
them	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
've	c
never	c
been	c
there	c
before	c
,	c
and	c
never	c
heard	c
of	c
these	c
two	c
places	i
.	c

When	c
I	c
am	c
at	c
Camp	c
,	c
I	c
will	c
choose	c
singing	c
and	c
photography	c
I	i
can	c
sing	c
classic	i
music	c
and	c
pop	c
music	c
,	c
seem	i
like	c
rock	c
&	c
roll	c
.	c

What	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
shall	c
I	c
take	c
?	c
and	i
how	c
much	c
does	c
it	c
cost	c
per	c
night	c
live	i
in	c
a	c
Hotel	c
?	c

Yours	c

a	c
lot	c
of	c
thief	i
there	i
,	i
they	i
will	c
steal	c
you	i
money	c
,	i
that	i
's	i
so	c
dangerous	c
.	c

Maybe	c
I	c
will	c
feel	c
better	c
and	c
enjoy	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
a	c
fan	c
of	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
he	c
was	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
reasons	c
why	c
I	c
chose	c
seeing	i
Over	c
The	c
Rainbow	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
even	c
see	c
him	c
on	c
the	c
stage	c
.	c

That	c
destroyed	c
all	c
my	c
plans	c
.	c

Then	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
have	c
a	i
dinner	c
at	c
your	c
Theatre	c
Restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
but	c
unfortunately	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

This	c
was	c
the	c
most	c
wonderful	c
suggestion	c
I	c
have	c
ever	c
had	c
.	c

She	c
was	i
about	i
to	i
cry	c
.	c

After	c
hearing	c
this	c
,	c
I	c
told	c
her	c
that	c
I	c
am	c
deeply	c
in	c
love	c
with	c
Larry	c
.	c

Next	c
morning	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
school	c
again	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

I	c
,	c
as	c
a	c

the	c
students	c
who	c
participate	c
in	c
this	c
year	c
's	c
trip	c
to	c

would	c
like	c
to	c

you	c
for	c

Being	i

of	c
the	c
most	c
multicultural	c

multiracial	c
cities	c

we	c

Best	c
Regards	c
,	c

We	c
were	c
both	c
18	c
,	c
and	c
we	c
had	c
the	c
university	c
access	c
test	c
already	c
done	c
.	c

It	c
took	c
us	c
two	c
weeks	c
to	c
modify	c
the	c
results	c
in	c
a	c
very	c
complex	c
operation	c
in	c
which	c
we	c
should	c
take	c
care	c
of	c
hiding	i
all	c
our	c
fingerprints	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
,	c

The	c
show	c
includes	c
the	c
latest	c
fashion	i
wear	i
,	c
sports	i
wear	i
for	i
spare	i
time	i
,	c
make	i
up	i
and	c
hairstyles	c
.	c

We	c
agreed	c
in	c
the	c
class	c
to	i
visit	c
this	c
show	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
14	c
March	c
in	c
the	c
afternoon	c
after	c
lunch	c
instead	c
of	c
shopping	i
.	c

As	c
soon	c
as	c
they	c
are	c
famous	c
,	c
they	c
are	c
surrounded	c
by	c
their	c
fans	c
and	c
reporters	c
in	i
every	i
place	i
.	c

On	c
the	c
one	c
hand	c
I	c
can	c
understand	c
how	c
important	c
it	c
is	c
for	c
the	c
journalists	c
to	c
take	c
pictures	c
for	c
the	c
newspaper	c
or	c
magazines	c
they	c
work	c
for	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
only	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
this	c
is	c
the	c
only	c
month	c
that	c
I	c
am	c
on	c
holiday	c
each	c
year	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
have	c
to	c
spend	c
there	c
and	c
if	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
take	c
with	c
me	c
my	c
sports	c
clothes	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
shopping	c
is	c
a	c
very	c
good	c
practice	i
that	i
's	i
give	i
you	c
more	c
opportunity	i
to	c
enjoy	c
yourself	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
understand	c
why	c
men	c
do	c
n't	c
like	c
shopping	c
at	i
least	c
they	c
say	c
that	c
.	i

You	c
should	c
n't	c
go	c
shopping	c
when	c
the	c
shopps	i
are	c
so	c
busy	c
because	c
its	i
so	c
boring	i
.	c

The	c
problems	c
started	c
when	c
we	c
arrived	c
at	c
the	c
Theatre	c
:	c
my	c
6	i
year	i
old	i
son	c
had	c
to	c
pay	c
full	i
price	c
.	c

Indeed	c
,	c
we	c
are	c
still	c
waiting	c
on	i
Danny	c
Brook	c
who	c
was	c
not	c
in	c
the	c
piece	i
.	c

only	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
in	c
august	i
i	i
must	c
go	c
to	c
my	c
grandmother	i
and	c
help	c
to	i
her	c
to	c
gather	c
a	c
harvest	c
of	c
fruits	i
.	c

i	i
'd	i
prefer	c
take	i
a	c
tent	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
more	c
romantic	c
and	c
exciting	c
spend	i
nights	c
in	c
the	i
tent	c
.	c

Because	c
i	i
think	c
it	c
is	c
teenagers	i
game	c
.	c

i	i
'm	i
often	c
go	c
to	c
an	i
exhibitions	c
of	c
paintings	c
of	c
modern	c
artists	c
.	c

i	i
'd	i
think	c
I	c
'll	c
enjoy	c
this	c
travel	i
.	c

i	i
whant	i
to	c
know	c
some	c
questions	i
about	c
it	c
.	c

In	i
what	i
day	c
i	i
can	i
start	c
my	c
travel	i
?	c
in	i
what	i
conditions	i
it	i
will	i
be	i
spend	i
?	c
and	i
the	i
last	i
one	i
.	c

end	i
what	c
do	c
you	c
think	c
?	c

But	c
my	c
mother	c
said	c
:	c
"	c
i	i
have	c
n't	c
enough	c
money	c
to	c
buy	c
it	c
"	c
.	c

quality	i
of	c
life	c
very	i
low	c
.	c

and	c
shoppings	i
will	c
be	i
allways	i
enjoyable	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
with	c
reference	c
to	c
your	c
letter	c
about	c
the	c
competition	c
I	c
won	c
,	c
in	c
which	c
you	c
required	i
some	c
additional	c
information	c
.	c

Here	c
are	c
my	c
findings	c
.	c

I	c
believe	c
I	c
have	c
the	c
appropriate	c
qualification	i
to	c
stay	c
two	c
weeks	c
at	c
camp	c
California	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

However	i
,	i
I	c
was	c
responsible	c
for	c
check	i
in	i
for	i
the	c
entrance	c
then	i
I	c
must	i
gave	i
a	c
sit	i
to	c
everyone	c

I	c
have	c
n't	c
been	c
to	c
a	c
concert	c
before	c
so	c
the	c
atmosphier	i
was	c
really	c
good	c
.	c

Some	c
concert	c
halls	c
were	c
not	c
big	c
enough	c
to	c
have	i
the	c
audience	c
.	c

When	c
he	c
cut	c
it	c
,	c
he	c
found	c
a	c
beautiful	c
baby	c
girl	c
in	c
it	c

Some	c
princes	c
proposed	c
her	i
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs.	c
Ryan	c
,	c

In	i
the	i
end	i
I	c
would	c
like	c
you	c
to	c
tell	c
me	c
if	c
I	c
should	c
take	c
some	c
special	c
clothes	c
and	c
also	c
the	i
sum	c
of	c

I	c
will	c

something	c
new	c
,	i
I	c
am	c
in	c
the	c
third	c
group	c
-	c
previously	i
I	c
think	c
of	c
what	c
I	c
will	c
buy	c
and	c
go	c
straight	c
to	c
the	c
department	c
I	c
need	c
.	c

The	c
most	c
important	c
thing	c
is	c
dance	c
shows	c
.	i

As	i
more	i
people	c
like	c
dance	c
shows	c
,	c
me	i
too	i
.	c

If	c
you	c
can	c
pay	c
attention	c
to	c
my	c
small	c
suggestion	c
,	c
next	c
year	c
I	c
hope	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
unbelievable	i
festival	c
.	c

I	c
miss	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
and	c
sorry	c
about	i
did	i
n't	i
write	i
you	c
some	i
letters	c

As	c
you	c
know	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
new	c
student	c

However	c
;	i
today	c
I	c
used	i
to	c
my	c
school	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
got	i
two	c
sweet	c
girls	c
.	c

For	c
instance	c
;	i
you	c
must	c
not	c
argue	c
with	c
your	c
friend	c
or	c
you	c
must	c
not	c
argue	c
with	c
workers	c
.	c

You	c
continuously	c
must	c
study	c
hard	c
.	c

Can	c
I	c
change	c
my	c
school	c
?	c

Please	c
you	i
will	i
write	c
me	c
a	c
letter	c
quickly	c
.	c

I	c
looked	c
forward	c
a	i
perfect	c
evening	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
the	c
most	c
disappointing	c
one	c
I	c
have	c
ever	c
had	c
.	c

Your	i
faithfuly	i

It	c
affects	c
our	c

I	c
am	i
very	i
delighted	c
to	c
visit	c
the	i
two	c
weeks	c
Camp	c
California	c
in	c
the	c
U.S.A.	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
on	i
July	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
work	c
in	c
my	c
company	c
at	c
the	c
moment	c
,	c
so	c
my	c
boss	c
said	c
I	c
can	c
have	c
my	c
travel-holiday	i
only	c
on	i
July	c
.	c

Therefore	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
about	c
the	c
weather	c
in	c
California	c
on	i
July	c
.	c

May	i
be	i
there	c
are	c
some	c
occasions	c
which	i
I	c
have	c
to	c
pay	c
myself	i

am	c
a	c
teacher	c
and	c
I	c
love	c
music	c
.	c

Most	c
of	c
the	c
events	c
which	c
I	c
had	i
seen	i
were	c
good	c
.	c

I	c
visited	c
art	c
exhibitions	c

There	c
were	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
nice	c
pictures	c
,	c
sculptures	c
and	c
other	c
creative	c
works	c
.	c

There	c
are	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
folk	c
stories	c
in	i
the	c
world	c
and	c
there	c
are	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
folk	c
stories	c
in	c
Estonia	c
,	i
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
one	c
of	c
them	c
.	c

They	c
were	c
successful	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
happy	c
when	c
your	c
letter	c
arrived	c
,	c
yesterday	c
.	c

At	c
the	c
concert	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
clear	i
and	c
organized	i
all	c
the	c
people	c
who	c
were	c
in	i
,	c
but	c
at	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
the	c
night	c
I	c
was	c
able	c
to	c
talk	c
with	c
one	c
of	c
my	c
favourite	c
pop	c
singer	i
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
it	i
was	c
the	c
experience	c
I	c
particularly	i
liked	c
most	c
and	c
which	c
I	c
will	c
never	c
forget	c
.	c

To	c
make	c
the	c
matter	c
worse	c
,	c
I	c
was	i
travelling	i
to	c
London	c
to	c
see	c
this	c
famous	c
starring	i
but	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
see	c
any	c
shows	c
of	i
them	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
you	c
to	c
give	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

I	c
have	c
a	c
really	c
good	c
,	i
freind	i
,	c
Pat	c
who	c
I	c
was	i
trusted	i
and	c
counted	c
on	c
her	i
.	c

And	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
make	c
sure	c
that	c
he	c
was	i
relly	i
love	i
me	c
.	c

On	c
Monday	c
morning	c
,	c
I	c
walked	c
into	c
the	c
class	c
and	c
all	c
of	c
my	c
freind	i
was	i
shouting	c
at	c
me	c
and	c
called	i
my	c
name	c
and	c
my	i
boyfreind	i
.	c

According	c
to	c
your	c
letter	c
,	c
I	c
should	c
tell	c
you	c
when	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
July	c
is	c
the	c
best	c
time	c
for	c
me	c
because	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
on	c
summer	c
vacations	i
so	c
I	c
would	c
not	c
have	c
to	c
miss	c
any	c
classes	c
.	c

Thanks	c
in	c
advance	c
for	c
your	c
assistance	c

PONTES	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
shopping	c
can	c
be	c
a	c
good	c
thing	c
if	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
possibility	i
to	c
forget	c
about	c
all	c
the	c
problems	c
you	c
have	c
,	c
even	c
if	c
it	c
is	c
just	c
for	c
a	c
moment	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
sometimes	c
you	c
can	i
not	c
find	c
a	c
variety	c
of	c
goods	c
and	c
you	c
eventually	c
buy	c
a	c
low	c
quality	c
product	c
.	c

One	c
of	c
the	c
activities	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
do	c
is	c
Climbing	c
,	i
I	c
have	c
n't	c
done	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
it	c
but	c
I	c
've	c
always	c
found	c
it	c
interesting	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
this	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
good	c
opportunity	c
to	c
become	c
better	c
in	i
it	c
.	c

I	c
am	i
great	c
especially	i
last	c
weekend	c
in	i
the	c
concert	i
of	i
Backstreet	i
Boys	i
.	c

It	c
was	c
so	c
exciting	c
.	c

Here	c
is	c
where	c
the	c
good	c
part	c
starts	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
doing	c
the	c
courtines	i
(	c
opening	c
and	c
closing	c
)	c
when	c
Nick	c
came	c
to	i
me	c
and	c
ask	i
me	c
to	c
go	c
on	c
stage	c
with	c
him	c
,	i
my	i
heart	c
started	c
beating	c
very	c
hard	c
.	c

Well	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
go	c
now	c
.	c

Concerning	c
the	c
two	c
activities	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
choose	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
swim	c
and	c
play	c
tennis	c
(	c
I	c
have	c
a	c
good	c
level	c
in	i
each	c
sports	i
)	c

it	c
gives	i
all	c
the	c
areas	c
covered	c

a	c
mecanic	i

and	c
it	c
is	c
very	c
important	c
in	c
a	c
school	c
where	c
you	c
will	c
probably	c
become	c
a	c
mecanic	i

It	i

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
expect	c
that	c
these	c
two	c
weeks	c
will	c
be	c
as	i
a	c
big	c
rest	c
.	c

There	i
are	i
not	c
only	c
the	c
brain	c
which	c
should	c
be	c
trained	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
want	c
further	c
information	c
or	c
if	c
you	c
disagree	c
,	c
tell	c
me	c
it	i
.	c

In	c
the	c
following	c
you	c
can	c
find	c
,	c
I	c
hope	c
,	c
call	i
the	c
information	c
you	c
need	c
to	c
complete	c
the	c
partecipation	i
procedure	c
.	c

What	c
are	c
the	c
better	i
clothes	c
to	c
use	i
at	c
the	c
camp	c
?	c

I	c
will	c
be	c
very	c
glad	c
to	c
partecipate	i
to	i
your	c
camp	c
!	c

The	c
mathematical	i
lessons	c
are	c
divided	c
in	c
two	c
part	i
:	c
the	c
theoretical	c
one	c
where	c
the	c
definitions	c
and	c
the	c
theorems	c
are	c
presented	c
to	c
students	c
and	c
the	c
numerical	c
one	c
where	c
the	c
problems	c
are	c
solved	c
and	c
the	c
applications	c
are	c
explained	c
.	c

Two	c
particular	c
activities	c
are	c
performed	c
in	c
the	i
laboratory	i
of	i
physics	i
and	i
in	i
the	i
laboratory	i
of	i
chemistry	i
.	c

These	c
activities	c
are	c
very	c
interesting	c
and	c
they	c
will	c
be	i
surely	i
enclosed	i
in	c
the	c
video	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
many	c
sport	i
activities	c
are	c
performed	c
in	c
our	c
school	c
:	c
swimming	c
,	c
tennis	c
,	c
gym	c
,	c
jogging	c
and	c
so	c
on	c
.	c

We	c
can	c
find	c
another	c
chance	i
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
Science	c
Museum	c
in	i
any	c
other	c
day	c
,	c
but	c
this	c
show	c
is	c
just	c
for	i
this	c
Tuesday	c
.	c

Press	i
takes	c
this	c
demand	c
as	c
an	c
order	c
,	c
and	c
"	c
but	c
public	i
wants	c
to	c
know	c
"	c
becomes	c
a	c
nightmare	c
for	c
famous	c
people	c
.	c

The	c
situation	c
much	i
be	c
much	c
worse	c
for	c
the	c
ones	c
who	c
have	c
become	c
famous	c
without	c
desiring	c
this	i
.	c

I	c
went	c
to	c
buy	c
the	i
ticket	c
and	c
as	c
I	c
like	c
to	c
enjoy	c
the	c
show	c
near	c
of	i
the	c
stage	c
I	c
bought	c
a	c
£	c
20	c
tiket	i
but	c
when	c
I	c
asked	c
for	c
the	i
discount	c
they	c
told	c
me	c
"	i
I	c
am	c
sorry	c
but	c
there	c
was	c
an	c
error	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c

It	c
will	c
be	c
impossible	c

I	c
told	c
her	c
to	c
make	i
me	c
a	i
phone	i
cold	i
.	c

Pat	c
sent	c
to	i
my	i
house	i
a	i
fax	i
with	c
the	c
different	c
alternatives	c
she	c
thought	i
but	i
unfortunately	c
my	c
grandmother	c
was	c
there	c
and	c
she	c
saw	c
the	c
paper	c

the	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c

Accommodation	i
in	i
log	c
cabins	c
would	c
be	c
better	c
for	c
me	c
,	c
because	c
they	c
are	c
more	c
comfortable	c
.	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c

Summing	c
up	c
,	c
going	c
shopping	c
can	c
be	c
a	c
relaxing	c
activity	c
if	c
you	c
choose	c
the	c
right	c
day	c
,	c
but	c
be	c
aware	c
of	c
how	c
dangerous	c
it	c
can	c
be	c
for	c
your	c
patience	c
.	c

Last	c
Saturday	c
evening	c
me	c
and	c
my	c
family	c
went	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
"	c
at	c
your	c
theatre	c
.	c

By	c
then	c
our	c
children	c
were	c
very	c
bored	c
.	c

When	c
the	c
show	c
had	c
finished	c
we	c
decided	c
to	c
go	c
for	c
a	c
snack	c
to	i
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
and	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
without	c
giving	i
any	c
reason	c
for	i
it	i
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
and	c
this	c
was	c
the	c
reason	c
why	c
the	c
party	c
was	c
n't	c
as	c
succesful	i
as	c
we	c
thought	c
.	c

We	c
were	c
having	c
a	c
wonderful	c
time	c
chatting	c
and	c
laughing	c
but	c
suddenly	c
the	c
phone	c
rang	c
and	c
Pat	c
answer	i
it	c
.	c

Sam	c
look	i
at	c
us	c
surprised	c
and	c
said	c
"	i
What	c
's	c
going	c
on	c
?	c
"	c

We	c
have	c
been	c
very	c
excited	c
about	c
this	c
and	c
coincidentely	i
we	c
have	c
found	c
another	c
option	c
to	c
add	c
in	i
our	c
programme	c
,	c
certainly	c
if	c
your	i
agree	c
with	c
.	i

We	c
have	i
thought	i
that	c
The	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
to	c
give	c
us	c
more	c
information	c
about	c
the	c
main	c
transformation	i
in	i
nowdays	i
in	c
England	c
about	i
fashions	i
,	c
Leisure	i
,	c
sports	c
and	c
style	i
of	i
life	i
.	c

We	c
are	c
really	c
satisfied	c
in	i
sightseeing	i
by	c
bus	c
,	c
in	i
go	i
to	c
the	c
National	c
Gallery	c
,	c
but	c
the	c
whole	c
class	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
The	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	i
will	i
be	c
free	c
.	c

We	c
are	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
your	c
answer	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
dangerous	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
kew	i
I	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
.	c

This	c
sad	c
and	c
unlucky	c
day	c
was	c
on	c
Friday	c
1998	c
,	c
it	i
was	c
n't	c
13th	c
even	c
it	c
look	c
liked	i
,	i
but	c
it	c
was	c
my	c
25th	c
birthday	c
.	c

If	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
do	c
it	c
,	c
I	c
knew	c
I	c
would	c
die	c
,	i
my	i
option	c
was	c
my	c
life	c
,	c
but	c
now	c
I	c
have	c
n't	c
any	i
chance	c
to	c
live	c
because	c
I	c
'm	c
in	c
the	i
prison	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
make	c
some	c
complaints	c
about	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
,	c
wich	i
you	c
are	c
the	c
manager	c
.	c

Although	c
it	c
was	c
written	c
in	c
the	c
show	c
's	c
addvertisement	i
that	c
the	c
main	c
actor	c
was	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
it	c
,	c
unfortunately	c
,	c
was	c
not	c
him	c
.	c

I	i
all	c
happened	c
a	c
year	c
ago	c
,	c
when	c
Pat	c
and	c
I	c
were	c
still	c
best	c
friends	c
and	c
used	c
to	c
tell	c
each	c
other	c
everything	c
.	c

One	c
day	c
,	c
I	c
inocently	i
told	c
Pat	c
that	c
I	c
was	c
dating	c
Philip	c
Smythe	c
,	c
the	c
school	c
's	c
hunk	c
and	c
most	c
popular	c
boy	c
.	c

I	c
asked	c
Pat	c
not	c
to	c
tell	c
anyone	c
,	c
and	c
she	c
promised	c
me	c
she	c
would	c
n't	c
.	c

Suddenly	c
,	c
an	c
enourmous	i
saddness	i
caught	c
me	c
,	c
because	c
Philip	c
had	c
begged	c
me	c
not	c
to	c
tell	c
anyone	c
,	c
so	c
he	c
would	c
definately	i
brake	i
up	c
with	c
me	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
knew	c
I	c
was	c
going	c
to	c
stop	c
talking	c
to	c
Pat	c
,	c
because	c
she	c
had	c
just	c
ruined	c
my	c
happiness	c
and	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
trust	c
her	c
anymore	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
very	c
disappointing	c
for	c
me	c
that	c
the	c
starring	i
was	c
not	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
as	c
your	c
company	c
had	c
published	i
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

When	c
all	c
money	i
had	c
gone	c
from	c
a	c
bank	c
,	c
nobady	i
there	i
except	c
Pat	c
.	c

Then	c
police	i
realized	c
who	c
were	i
bank	i
robbers	i
and	c
arested	i
them	c
.	c

The	c
town	c
became	c
peace	i
again	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
heard	c
that	c
they	c
will	i
read	c
"	c
The	c
Old	c
Man	c
and	c
the	c
Sea	c
"	c
on	c
the	c
radio	c
P1	i
on	i
Wednesday	c
next	c
week	c
.	c

This	c
day	c
he	c
is	c
lucky	c
.	c

The	c
fisherman	c
kills	c
many	c
sharks	c
with	c
different	i
weapons	c
,	c
but	c
when	c
he	c
reaches	c
port	c
there	c
is	c
only	c
head	i
,	c
tail	c
and	c
bones	c
left	c
of	c
the	c
huge	c

The	c

Sven	c
Reitgard	c

Firstly	c
,	c
the	c
start	i
time	c
was	i
at	i
19.30	c
p.m	c
,	c
but	c
the	c
play	c
started	c
at	c
20.15	c
p.m.	c
People	c
were	c
fed	c
up	c
with	c
waiting	c
so	c
long	c
and	c
most	c
of	c
them	c
apart	i
from	c
me	c
were	i
rather	c
nervous	i
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
the	c
well-known	c
star	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
was	c
n't	c
there	c
,	c
but	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
I	i
had	c
never	c
heard	c
from	i
him	c
.	c

From	c
my	c
point	c
of	c
view	c
I	c
think	c
he	c
was	c
such	c
a	c
very	c
bad	c
actor	c
that	c
was	i
impossible	c
to	c
fine	i
another	c
with	c
the	c
same	c
features	i
.	c

As	c
far	c
as	c
the	c
tickets	c
is	i
concerned	c
no	c
discounts	c
were	c
available	c
,	c
so	c
,	c
moreover	i
I	c
found	c
it	c
expensive	c
.	c

After	c
the	c
show	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
visit	c
the	c
restaurant	c
as	c
it	c
is	c
said	i
it	i
is	i
very	c
famous	c
and	c
apart	c
from	c
that	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
drink	c
.	c

I	c
've	c
know	i
Pat	c
since	c
we	c
were	c
kids	c
.	c

My	c
mother	c
was	c
so	c
hungry	i
and	c
she	c
told	c
off	i
me	i
so	c
hard	i
that	c
I	c
will	c
remember	c
it	c
the	i
rest	c
of	c
my	c
life	c
.	c

Since	c
then	c
I	c
have	c
n't	c
seen	c
Pat	c
anymore	c
and	c
she	c
seems	i
not	i
regret	i
that	i
happened	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
'll	c
try	c
to	c
forget	c
her	c
and	c
carry	c
on	c
my	i
life	c
that	i
's	c
all	c

The	c

Circle	c
Theatre	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

In	c
advertisment	i
starring	i
was	c
very	c
interested	i
-	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
.	c

In	c
advertisment	i
was	i
-	c
"	c
discounts	c
available	c
"	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
disappointed	c
because	c
you	c
wrote	c
about	c
it	c
!	c

I	c
would	i
ask	c
you	c
for	c
money	i
back	c
.	c

Because	c
the	c
world	c
is	c
now	c
a	c
global	c
village	c
the	i
people	c
will	c
wear	c
at	c
least	c
one	c
part	i
of	c
traditional	c
or	c
national	c
clothes	i
(	c
for	c
example	c
peasnt	i
jacket	c
or	c
hat	c
)	c
like	i
now	i
in	c
rural	c
areas	c
from	c
time	c
to	c
time	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
,	c

The	c
programme	c
seems	c
to	c
be	c
really	c
interesting	c
,	c
especially	c
visiting	c
the	c
Science	c
Museum	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
really	c
understand	c
how	c
annoying	c
or	c
depressing	c
it	c
can	c
be	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
deep	c
inside	c
famous	c
persons	i
are	c
just	c
ordinary	c
people	c
and	c
like	c
for	i
all	c
of	c
us	c
having	i
a	c
private	c
life	c
is	c
important	c
for	c
psychological	i
condition	i
.	c

However	c
,	c
everyone	c
needs	c
to	c
have	i
some	c
part	c
of	c
his	c
life	c
being	i
a	i
secret	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
,	c

However	c
,	c
we	c
have	c
got	c
a	c
suggestion	c
:	c
we	c
saw	c
an	c
advertissement	i
for	c
"	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
"	c
which	c
is	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
March	c
14	c
from	c
10:00	c
to	c
19:00	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
the	c
big	c
advantage	c
is	c
that	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
free	c
show	c
so	c
you	c
will	c
not	c
have	c
to	c
worry	c
about	c
the	c
budget	c
.	c

And	c
famous	c
people	c
like	c
it	c
because	c
if	c
you	c
're	c
a	c
star	c
or	c
whatever	c
it	i
's	c
because	c
you	c
like	c
to	c
show	c
yourself	c
.	c

therefore	i
,	c
even	c
if	c
I	c
agree	c
sometimes	c
Medias	i
are	i
going	i
too	c
far	c
and	c
write	c
really	c
bad	c
things	c
.	i

Dear	c
Ms	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
!	c

I	c
was	c
pleased	c
to	c
recieve	i
you	i
letter	c
ricently	i
.	c

-	i
I	c
like	c
to	c
wake	c
up	c
with	c
a	c
view	c
to	i
mountains	c
,	c
wich	i
remind	i
me	c
about	i
my	c
5	c
years	i
experience	c
in	i
climbing	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
,	c

Let	c
's	c
speak	i
about	c
shoping	i
.	c

Because	c
I	c
aware	i
of	c
big	i
lines	i
to	i
check	i
point	i
,	c
crowds	c
of	c
people	c
,	c
noise	c
...	c

Then	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
receive	c
my	c
money	c
for	c
the	c
ticket	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
the	c
actor	c
was	c
different	c
.	c

The	c
movie	c
started	c
20.15	c
not	c
19.30	c
.	c

The	c
number	c
is	c
577-6277	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
I	c
can	c
have	c
my	c
spare	c
time	c
owing	i
to	c
these	c
thing	i
.	c

Then	c
it	c
takes	c
about	c
1	c
hour	c
or	c
one	c
and	c
a	c
half	c
to	c
wash	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
can	c
read	c
my	c
book	c
or	c
do	c
another	c
thing	c
.	c

Also	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
imagine	c
my	c
life	c
without	c
car	i
.	c

We	c
should	c
speak	c
about	c
our	c
library	c
that	i
it	c
is	c
well	c
furnished	c
of	i
several	i
books	c
,	c
tape	i
and	c
video	i
.	c

After	c
that	c
we	c
have	c
to	c
make	c
sure	c
that	c
we	c
explain	c
how	i
is	i
it	i
the	c
relationship	c
betwen	i
teachers	c
and	c
students	c
,	c
showing	c
the	c
several	i
time	i
that	c
we	c
have	c
been	c
out	c
together	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs.	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
completely	c
agree	c
with	c
this	c
statement	c
.	c

His	i
title	c
was	c
:	c
"	c
The	c
Mistery	i
of	c
Hunter	c
's	c
Lodge	c
"	c
.	c

The	c
charachter	i
which	i
I	c
liked	c
most	c
was	c
that	c
of	c
Mrs.	c
Havering	c
,	c
the	c
mistress	c
.	c

She	c
was	c
the	c
head	i
in	c
this	c
story	c
.	c

The	c
plan	c
was	c
almost	c
perfectly	i
and	c
the	c
police	c
had	i
n't	i
discovered	i
the	c
murderer	c
without	c
the	c
help	c
of	c
Mr.	c
Poirot	c
.	c

I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
to	c
see	c
a	c
musical	c
show	c
called	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
disappointed	c
after	i
it	c
.	c

First	i
off	i
all	i
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
it	c
has	i
started	i
later	c
than	c
it	c
should	c
to	i
,	i
I	c
had	c
to	c
wait	c
for	c
about	c
fourty-five	i
minutes	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
rather	i
say	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
very	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
have	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c
or	c
we	c
will	c
meet	c
at	i
court	c
!	c

Yours	c
sincerlly	i
,	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
travel	c
on	i
July	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
manager	c
so	c
I	c
can	i
not	i
travel	c
another	c
time	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

the	c
lost	c
wallet	c

A	c
long	c
time	c
ago	c
,	c
when	c
I	c
started	c
working	c
,	c
I	c
received	c
my	c
first	c
pay	i
and	c
went	c
to	c
a	c
shopping	c
center	c
to	c
spend	c
my	c
money	c
with	i
my	c
credit	c
card	c
.	c

I	c
started	c
to	c
look	c
in	i
everywhere	c
.	c

I	c
started	c
to	c
look	c
for	c
my	c
wallet	c
and	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
find	c
it	c
,	c
lighter	i
.	c

All	c
the	c
students	c
are	c
happy	c
that	c
we	c
will	c
have	c
othe	i
oppurtinatey	i
,	i
to	c
visit	c
London	c
for	c
three	c
days	c
.	c

We	c
all	c
agree	i
to	i
the	c
daily	c
programme	c
during	i
the	c
three	c
days	c
.	c

It	c
would	c
be	c
exciting	c
,	i
if	c
we	c
had	c
the	c
possibility	i
,	i
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

We	c
all	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
help	c
.	c

The	c
student	c

They	c
want	c
to	c
get	c
from	c
them	c
all	c
the	c
details	c
of	c
their	c
life	c
,	c
especially	c
from	i
their	c
private	c

Who	c
got	c
married	c

who	c
got	c
divorsed	i
or	c
who	c
had	i
a	c
remarkeable	i
changing	i
of	i
his	c
complexion	c
,	c
these	c
are	c
questions	c
,	i
who	i
most	c
journalists	c
are	c
interested	c
in	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
a	c
right	c
like	i
everybody	c
from	i
us	c
has	c
.	c

Is	i
it	i
normally	i
when	c
you	c
are	c
a	c
star	c
,	i
that	c
everybody	c
wants	c
to	c
know	c
all	c
about	c
you	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
nobody	c
have	i
forgotten	c
,	i
where	c
curiosity	i
from	i
the	c
journalists	c
end	i
.	c

In	c
the	c
advertisment	i
it	c
was	c
clearly	c
written	c
that	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
would	c
play	c
main	i
roles	c
.	c

The	c
last	c
problem	c
was	c

It	c
was	c
written	c
in	c

that	c
I	c
could	c

after	c
the	c

unfortunatelly	i

are	c
many	c
different	c

on	c
Earth	c
:	c

We	c

I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
any	i
shops	c
are	c
too	c
busy	c
to	c
enjoy	c
shopping	c
in	c
at	c
weekends	c
.	c

What	c
's	c
worse	c
,	c
there	c
is	c
usually	c
traffic	i
jam	c
around	c
or	c
along	c
roads	c
to	c
a	c
big	c
supermarket	c
and	c
a	c
shopping	c
mall	c
.	c

For	c
the	c
handicapped	c
,	c
going	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
easy	c
and	c
it	c
can	c
be	c
very	c
bothering	i
unless	c
shops	c
have	c
facilities	c
for	c
them	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
express	c
my	c
dissapointment	i
about	i
the	c
play	c
"	c
over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
"	c
which	i
is	c
performing	i
at	c
Circle	i
Theatre	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c

"	c
Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets.	c
"	c

I	c
knew	c
that	c
but	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
trust	c
her	c
so	c
I	c
told	c
everything	i
about	c
Lynne	c
Harter	c
,	c
our	c
new	c
collegue	i
at	c
school	c

But	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
shut	c
my	c
mouth	c
,	i
I	c
continued	c
:	c
"	c
You	c
ca	c
n't	c
believe	c
it	c
Pat	i
,	c
she	c
wears	c
trousers	c

and	c
green	c
flowery	c

"	i
Of	c
course	c
,	c
my	c
friend	c
and	c
I	c
were	c
laughing	c
during	i
half	c
an	c
hour	c

In	i
that	i
precisely	i
moment	i
I	c
realized	c
that	c
I	c
had	c
forgotten	c
to	c
tell	c
her	c
that	c
Ann	c
was	c
Mr	c
Harter	c

niece	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
only	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
tests	i
at	c
school	c
and	c
they	c
are	c
Very	i
important	c
to	c
me	c
and	c
I	c
hope	c
you	c
Will	i
understand	c
my	c
problem	c

For	c
the	c
activities	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
chose	i
the	c
Tennis	i
activities	i

which	c
I	c
am	c
not	c
too	c
bad	c
at	c
,	c
and	c
climbing	c
,	c
Which	i
I	c
have	c
never	c
done	c
but	c
must	i
be	c
interesting	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
your	c
reply	c

Santiago	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
when	c
you	c
buy	c
something	c
,	c
you	c
might	c
lose	c
it	c
and	c
never	c
again	i
see	i
it	i
,	c
or	c
you	c
could	c
be	c
robbed	c
,	c
or	c
even	i
if	c
the	c
product	c
has	c
something	c
wrong	c
with	c
it	c
,	c
then	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
swap	c
it	c
and	c
that	c
takes	c
time	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs.	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
pleased	c
to	c
learn	c
that	c
I	c
had	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
!	c

Hopeful	i
,	c
you	c
try	c
to	c
find	c
the	c
same	c
thing	c
in	c
another	c
shop	c
.	c

At	i
the	i
time	i
you	c
realise	c
it	i
,	c
you	c
also	c
realise	c
that	c
the	c
shop	c
is	c
closing	c
in	c
five	c
minutes	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
you	c
run	c
to	c
the	c
bank	c
but	c
have	c
to	c
wait	c
for	i
the	c
queue	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
your	c
turn	c
and	c
you	c
do	i
as	c
quick	i
as	c
possible	c
.	c

You	c
run	c
back	c
to	c
the	c
shop	c
and	c
get	c
your	c
item	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

At	c
times	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
not	c
only	c
the	i
matter	c
of	c
having	c
to	c
make	c
a	c
choice	c
but	c
the	c
trouble	c
of	c
finding	c
something	c
,	i
which	c
can	c
kill	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
time	c
and	c
specially	i
when	c
your	c
does	i
n't	c
fit	c
with	i
the	i
in	i
fashion	c
.	c

Most	c
people	c
usually	c
go	c
shopping	c
for	c
something	c
which	c
is	c
affordable	c
,	c
and	c
many	c
times	c
they	c
find	c
,	c
for	c
example	c
,	c
a	c
dress	c
,	i
they	c
like	c
a	c
lot	c
but	c
they	c
cannot	c
buy	c
it	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
terribly	c
expensive	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
you	i
always	i
talk	i
yourself	i
into	i
some	i
piece	i
of	i
clothing	i
but	i
that	i
ended	i
up	i
being	i
a	i
tiring	i
day	i
of	c
going	c
in	c
and	c
out	c
of	c
fitting	c
rooms	c
and	c
figuring	c
out	c
discounts	c
.	c

They	c
only	c
want	c
to	c
know	c
where	c
I	c
am	c
and	c
when	c
I	c
go	c
out	c
at	i
what	c
time	c
I	c
came	c
home	c
.	c

At	c
school	c
is	i
complete	i
different	c
because	c
the	c
teachers	c
do	c
n't	c
foregive	i
you	c
nothing	i
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
:	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
last	c
evening	i
musical	c
show	c
.	c

What	c
a	c
terrible	c
evening	c
!	c

So	c
I	c
payed	i
the	i
ticket	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
so	c
he	c
told	c
his	c
mother	c
how	c
his	c
brother	c
Jim	c
lost	c
her	c
suit	c
suitcase	c
on	c
the	c
train	c
.	c

All	c
this	c
story	c
was	c
a	c
secret	c
but	c
Pat	c
realived	i
to	i
his	c
mother	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
really	c
dissapointed	i
bout	i
"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
which	c
I	c
saw	c
the	c
other	c
day	c
in	i
my	c
stay	c
in	c
London	c
which	c
your	c
company	c
organized	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
hear	i
from	c
you	c
sooner	i
as	c
possible	c
and	c
thanks	c
for	c
understand	i
my	c
situation	c
.	c

Even	c
though	i
,	c
this	c
is	c
not	c
enough	c
the	i
technology	c
created	c
a	c
better	c
way	i
of	c
communication	c
,	c
first	c
there	c
were	c
letters	c
,	c
after	i
telephones	c
and	c
now	c
we	c
can	c
write	c
letters	c
and	c
receive	c
them	c
through	c
internet	i
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
first	c
prize	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
happy	c
to	c
hear	c
that	c
all	c
accommodation	c
and	c
travel	c
costs	c
are	c
paid	c
for	c
.	c

I	c
play	i
tennis	c
since	c
I	c
was	c
ten	c
years	c
of	c
age	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

A	i
pop	c
concert	c
had	c
ten	c
pop	c
bands	c
.	c

I	c
saw	c
the	c
"	c
Boys	c
on	c
"	c
.	c

Look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

Love	c
,	c

I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
,	c
three	c
weeks	c
ago	c
,	c
to	c
see	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
,	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
that	c
was	c
played	i
at	c
this	i
moment	i
.	c

Plus	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
mentionned	i
,	i
on	i
your	c
advertisement	c
,	i
that	c
discounts	c
were	i
available	c
,	i
in	i
fact	c
,	c
no	c
discount	c
were	i
done	i
to	c
me	c
,	c
whereas	i
I	c
am	c
a	c
student	c
and	c
as	c
a	c
student	c
I	c
was	c
allowed	i
to	c
have	i
a	c
discount	c
but	c
I	c
paid	c
£	c
20	c
because	c
the	c
cashier	c
had	c
never	c
heard	c
about	c
any	c
discount	i
for	c
this	c
show	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
will	c
understand	c
my	c
disappointment	c
and	c
the	c
reasons	c
why	c
I	c
ask	c
for	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
new	c
technologies	c
help	c
us	c
to	c
save	c
our	c
free	c
time	c
and	c
to	c
work	c
more	c
quickly	c
and	c
more	c
efficiently	c
.	c

I	c
really	c
enjoyed	c
it	c
,	c
although	c
I	c
feel	c
it	c
could	c
have	c
been	c
better	c
.	c

However	c
the	c
concerts	c
were	c
great	c
,	c
but	c
unfortunately	c
,	c
some	c
concert	c
halls	c
were	c
too	c
small	c
and	c
it	c
was	c
as	c
hot	c
as	c
a	i
micro-wave	i
inside	c
.	c

Plays	i
and	c
Films	i
were	c
good	c
and	c
I	c
liked	c
them	c
,	c
but	c
there	c
were	c
only	c
a	c
few	c
,	c
I	c
hope	c
there	c
will	c
be	c
many	c
more	c
next	c
year	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
,	c

In	c
addition	c
it	c
is	c
properly	i
to	c
mention	c
you	i
that	c
all	c
the	c
students	c
of	i
my	c
class	c
are	c
interested	c
in	c
going	c
to	c
The	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
show	i
,	c
which	c
is	c
taking	c
place	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
14th	c
in	c
the	c
Central	c
Exhibition	c
Hall	c
.	c

Not	i
only	i
we	c
could	c
see	c
the	c
latest	c
trend	c
in	c
make-up	c
but	i
hairstyles	i
performed	i
by	i
important	i
coiffeurs	i
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	i
,	c

I	c
joined	c
with	i
an	c
expedition	c
team	i
in	c
order	c
to	c
explore	c
the	c
Rocky	c
Mountains	c
.	c

We	c
planned	c
a	c
programme	i
.	c

The	c
weather	c
was	c
delightful	c
,	c
except	c
this	i
afternoon	c
when	c
started	i
to	c
rain	c
and	c
we	c
decide	i
to	c
stay	c
during	i
the	c
night	c
inside	c
a	c
hole	c
in	c
the	c
wall	i
of	c
the	c
mountain	c
.	c

I	c
realised	c
that	c
my	c
bag	c
was	c
outside	c
and	c
I	c
went	c
out	c
to	c
look	c
for	c
it	c
,	c
when	c
a	c
rain	i
of	c
stones	c
covered	c
the	c
entrace	i
of	c
the	c
hole	c
.	c

When	c
we	c
finished	c
our	i
primary	c
school	c
we	c
went	c
at	i
the	c
same	c
secundary	i
school	c
too	c
,	c
but	c
we	c
were	c
in	c
different	c
classes	c
.	c

Now	c
,	c
five	c
years	c
later	c
we	c
are	c
going	c
to	c
get	c
married	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
,	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
the	c
clothes	c
will	c
be	c
more	c
colourful	c
,	c
funny	i
and	c
confortable	i
.	c

The	c
clothes	c
will	c
be	c
more	c
colourful	c
and	c
consequently	c
more	c
funny	i
.	c

We	c
will	c
not	c
use	i
black	c
clothes	c
as	c
we	c
are	i
used	c
to	c
do	i
.	c

This	c
way	c
,	c
people	c
tend	c
to	c
be	c
happier	c
.	c

It	i
will	c
be	c
more	c
beautiful	c
and	c
clean	c
.	c

They	c
will	c
wear	c
a	i
clothe	i
only	c
if	c
they	c
feel	c
good	c
wearing	c
it	c
.	c

Actually	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
the	c
clothes	c
will	c
be	c
really	c
simplier	i
in	c
100	c
years	c
and	c
I	c
hope	c
to	c
be	c
alive	c
until	c
then	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

My	c
mother	c
suggested	c
to	i
come	i
here	c
because	c
one	c
of	c
her	c
brothers	c
was	c
established	c
here	c
and	c
he	c
could	c
help	c
us	c
.	c

This	c
"	c
friendly	c
"	c
relationship	c
was	c
starting	c
to	c
make	i
hot	c
.	c

I	c
never	i
had	c
a	c
boyfriend	c
and	c
I	c
felt	i
in	c
love	c
with	c
him	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
be	c
grateful	c
if	c
you	c
would	c
consider	c
my	c
suggestion	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
dangerous	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
knew	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
there	c
is	c
a	c
TV	c
in	c
my	c
parent	i
's	i
car	c
.	c

As	i
a	i
conclusion	i
,	c
I	c
agree	c
that	c
modern	c
technology	c
has	c
changed	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
but	c
I	c
am	c
sure	c
that	c
in	i
the	c
future	c
,	c
my	c
life	c
will	c
not	c
be	c
the	c
same	c
as	c
now	c
because	c
more	c
modern	c
technology	c
will	c
appear	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writting	i
in	c
order	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
"	c
.	c

I	c
paid	c
a	i
full	i
ticket	c
without	c
discounts	i
to	c
wait	c
45	c
minutes	c
,	c
to	c
see	c
a	c
musical	c
show	c
with	c
a	c
bad	c
actor	c
and	c
after	c
all	c
could	i
not	c
have	c
a	c
sandwich	c
because	c
the	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

Technology	c
is	c
improving	c
every	c
day	c
,	c
soon	c
everything	c
will	c
be	c
done	c
by	c
a	c
machine	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
a	c
musical	c
show	c
which	c
is	c
called	c
"	c
Over	c
The	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
and	c
ask	c
for	c
money	i
back	c
.	c

This	c
show	c
was	c
presented	c
by	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
.	c

The	c
poster	c
also	c
told	c
me	c
that	c
I	c
could	c
visit	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
modern	c
technology	c
is	c
needed	c
to	c
meet	i
the	i
requirement	i
.	c

There	c
are	c
also	c
much	i
more	c
advantages	c
,	i
you	i
can	c
buy	c
somethings	i
in	c
a	c
supermarket	c
by	i
only	i
a	i
mail	i
order	i
,	i
you	i
do	c
n't	c
need	c
to	c
go	i
out	i
of	i
your	c
home	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
we	c
can	c
go	c
to	c
the	i
Mars	c
and	c
do	c
some	c
invesgation	i
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
trains	c
can	c
go	c
faster	c
and	c
aeroplanes	c
can	c
travel	c
faster	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c
I	c
'm	c
writing	c
this	c
letter	c
to	c
you	c
because	c
I	c
'm	c
very	c
disappointed	c
and	c
I	c
believe	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
hang	i
me	c
some	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

Your	i
faithfully.	c
.	c

Modern	c
technology	c
had	c
changed	c
human	i
being	i
's	i
daily	i
life	i
long	c
before	c
I	c
was	c

And	c
I	c

I	i
've	c

it	c
has	c
changed	c
my	c

I	c
can	c
phone	c

would	i
be	c
late	c
and	c
thanks	c
to	c
that	c
appliance	i
I	c
feel	c
less	c
nervous	c
and	c
now	c
I	c
'm	c
sure	c
I	c
could	c

live	c
without	c
it	c

The	c
show	c
started	c

minutes	c

When	c
I	c
go	c

sleep	c
after	c
I	c

So	i
I	c
turn	c

I	c

from	c
you	c
,	i
I	c
won	c
the	c
prize	c

Yours	c

Dear	c
Mr.	c
Robertson	c
,	c

It	c
is	c
really	i
good	c
programme	c
,	c
especially	i
visiting	c
Science	i
Museum	c
and	c
National	i
Art	c
Gallery	c
would	c
be	c
great	i
opportunity	c
to	c
learn	c
about	c
art	c
and	c
latest	i
improvements	i
in	c
science	c
.	c

It	c
takes	c
place	c
in	c
Central	i
Exhibition	c
Hall	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
14	c
March	c
.	c

It	c
will	c
be	c
great	i
opportunity	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
free	c
for	c
students	c
and	c
we	c
will	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
latest	c
fashions	c
in	c
leisure	c
and	c
sports	c
wear	c
,	c
new	c
hairstyles	c
and	c
make	i
up	i
industry	i
.	c

Although	c
according	c
to	c
your	c
programme	c
,	c
we	c
will	c
be	c
visiting	c
Science	i
Museum	c
in	c
the	c
morning	c
and	c
shopping	c
in	c
the	c
afternoon	c
,	c
we	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
make	c
a	c
suggestion	c
which	c
can	c
help	i
us	c
to	c
be	i
able	i
to	i
stick	i
to	i
both	c
.	c

In	c
order	c
to	c
fullfill	i
their	c
readers	c
'	c
requirements	c
they	c
always	i
follow	c
them	c
.	c

This	c
is	c
the	c
most	c
argueing	i
point	c
.	c

I	c
can	c
say	c
it	c
with	c
confidence	c
that	c
I	c
am	c
quite	c
good	c
at	c
basketball	c
-	c
I	c
play	c
it	c
for	c
my	c
school	c
's	c
team	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
going	c
to	c
train	c
it	i
in	c
August	c
as	c
well	c
-	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
want	c
to	c
loose	i
touch	c
with	c
it	c
.	c

Does	c
it	c
rain	c
a	c
lot	c
there	c
?	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
and	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
wait	c
going	i
to	c
USA	i
.	c

In	c
my	c
humble	c
opinion	c
,	c
shopping	c
is	c
one	c
of	c
he	i
most	c
stressful	c
and	c
boring	c
activities	c
people	c
do	c
in	c
life	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
if	c
you	c
happen	c
to	c
forget	c
something	c
,	c
you	c
will	c
have	c
to	c
force	c
your	c
way	c
back	c
through	c
crowds	c
of	c
other	c
shoppers	c
,	c
and	c
that	c
can	c
take	c
up	c
even	c
more	c
time	c
.	c

Your	c
programme	c
is	c
very	c
good	c
,	c
especially	c
that	i
we	c
can	c
go	c
to	c
visit	c
the	c
Science	c
Museum	c
which	i
I	c
heard	c
is	c
very	c
good	c
but	i
a	c
visit	c
to	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
good	c
opportunity	c
for	c
us	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
lastest	i
fashions	c
,	c
leisure	c
and	c
sports	c
wear	c
,	c
make	i
up	i
and	c
hair	i
styles	i
and	c
it	c
is	c
free	c
for	c
students	c
too	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
and	c
we	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

I	c
stressed	i
my	c
arm	c
,	c
the	c
branch	c
I	c
was	c
standing	c
on	c
broke	c
and	c
I	c
fell	c
down	c
on	c
my	c
leg	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
very	i
hurt	c
,	i
my	i
friend	c
rushed	c
to	c
me	c
than	i
ran	c
back	c
to	c
my	c
house	c
and	c
called	c
Mom	i
.	c

There	c
were	c
no	c
discounts	c
on	c
the	c
ticket	i
available	c
either	c
.	c

After	c
the	c
show	c
we	c
wanted	c
to	c
have	c
something	c
to	c
eat	c
in	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	i
rebuilding	i
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

The	c
secret	c
was	c
that	c
I	c
was	c
in	c
love	c
with	c
Peter	c
in	i
my	c
course	c
.	c

So	i
it	i
's	i
better	c
not	c
to	c
write	c
anything	c
if	c
you	i
do	i
n't	i
make	i
it	c
true	i
then	i
.	c

A	c
suggestion	c
?	c

There	c
would	i
be	c
many	c
things	c
to	c
say	c
about	c
.	i

I	c
'm	c
not	c
sure	c
if	c
I	c
must	i
say	c
technology	i
has	c
changed	c
our	c
life	c
in	c
positive	i
or	i
not	c
.	c

It	c
allows	c
us	c
to	c
keep	i
connections	c
with	c
the	c
other	c
states	c
of	c
the	c
world	c
,	c
improves	c
our	c
knowledge	c
,	c
offers	c
us	c
news	c
,	c
advises	c
us	c
about	c
events	c
which	c
happened	i
or	c
will	c
happen	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
everyone	c
should	c
live	c
his	c
own	c
life	c
how	c
he	c
wants	c
to	c
live	c
it	c
and	c
make	c
him	i
known	c
for	c
who	c
he	c
is	c
,	c
not	c
for	c
his	c
money	c
,	c
but	c
for	c
his	c
abilities	c
,	c
his	c
good	c
habits	c
,	c
his	c
personality	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

It	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
fault	i
of	c
responsability	i
for	c
a	c
theatre	c
like	c
yours	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
delay	c
like	c
this	c
one	c
.	c

Nobody	c
told	c
us	c
about	i
the	c
reasons	i
of	i
the	i
problems	c
.	c

These	c
are	c
the	c
reasons	c
why	c
I	c
am	c
complaining	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
if	c
there	c
will	c
be	c
some	i
money	i
back	i
.	c

Perhaps	c
,	c
modern	c
technology	c
has	c
changed	c
my	c
life	i
style	i
but	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
think	c
so	c
because	c
I	c
was	c
born	c
in	c
the	c
period	c
of	c
modern	c
developments	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
mind	c
staying	c
in	c
log	c
cabins	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
prefer	c
camping	c
because	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
be	c
really	c
near	i
the	i
nature	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
'll	c
need	c
to	i
the	c
trip	c
and	i
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
'll	c
need	c
.	c

Your	i
sincerely	c

Nowadays	c
shopping	c
is	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
activities	c
that	c
makes	c
our	c
society	c
lives	i

The	c
cities	c
are	c
the	c
main	c

our	c

17th	c
June	c
2000	c

I	c
have	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
I	c
am	c
realy	i
disappointed	c
bout	i
your	c
advertisement	c
because	c
you	c
mentioned	i
some	c
points	c
that	c
are	c
not	c
true	c
.	c

Looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

And	c
I	c
must	c
admit	c
that	c
this	c
is	c
true	c
.	c

Reserches	i
have	i
shown	c
that	c
almost	c
every	c
single	c
house	i
owns	c
a	c
P.C.	i
Some	c
people	c
use	c
them	c
for	c
their	c
job	c
because	c
they	c
do	i
need	c
it	c
,	c
but	c
others	c
,	c
like	c
children	c
,	c
use	c
it	c
just	c
for	c
fun	c
.	c

The	c
activities	c
that	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
do	c
there	c
are	c
the	c
followings:-	i
Singing	c
(	c
I	c
'm	c
very	i
good	c
singer	c
)	c
;	c
swimming	c
(	i
I	i
'm	i
not	i
good	i
at	i
all	i
at	i
this	i
one	i
)	i
but	c
I	c
enjoy	c
to	i
spend	i
time	c
in	c
the	c
water	c
I	i
really	c
do	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
to	c
see	c
you	c
soon	c
to	c
tell	i
you	c
more	c
details	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
very	c
soon	c
.	c

We	c
can	c
take	c
care	c
of	c
whom	i
we	c
love	c
and	c
give	c
them	c
more	c
attention	c
,	i
time	c
is	c
not	c
a	i
really	i
problem	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
the	c
first	c
step	c
for	i
a	c
true	c
fraternity	c
.	c

Living	c
better	c
,	c
people	c
live	c
longer	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
necessary	c
to	c
product	i
more	c
food	c
,	c
but	c
more	c
food	c
means	c
chemical	c
agents	c
on	c
earth	i
,	c
the	c
circle	c
never	c
stops	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
shall	c
stay	c
to	c
prepare	c
for	c
my	c
university	c
.	c

Finaly	i
,	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
know	c
what	c
the	c
weather	c
is	c
like	c
in	c
California	c
in	c
July	c
.	c

English	i
class	c
is	c
going	c
to	c
make	c
a	c
short	c
video	c
about	c
school	i
daily	c
life	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

This	c
statement	c
is	c
due	i
to	i
the	c
great	c
amount	c
of	c
rubbish	c
we	c
are	c
providing	i
for	i
the	c
world	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
writting	i
to	c
complain	c
about	c
your	c
theatre	c
and	c
its	c
last	i
night	i
show	i
.	c

His	c
act	i
was	c
not	c
good	c
and	c
he	c
did	c
n't	c
seem	c
like	i
acting	c
Even	i
my	c
son	c
could	c
act	c
better	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
dissappointed	i
what	i
else	i
can	i
I	i
write	i
.	c

But	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
.	c

In	c
Conclusion	i
I	i
'd	c
like	c
to	c
recoment	i
that	c
you	c
should	c
,	i
first	c
,	i
know	c
what	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
offer	c
and	c
the	i
advertising	i
it	c
.	c

I	c
should	c
n't	c
have	c
told	c
her	c
that	c
my	c
dad	c
had	c
physcological	i
problems	c
.	c

It	c
all	c
started	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
about	c
10	c
years	c
old	c
,	c
like	i
my	c
brother	c
now	i
,	c
and	c
I	c
overheard	c
my	c
mother	c
talking	c
about	c
my	c
father	c
and	c
his	c
problems	c
,	i
to	c
my	c
aunt	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
leaving	i
in	i
a	c
lie	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
realised	c
it	i
,	c
it	c
was	c
too	c
late	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
inform	c
that	i
I	c
can	c
only	c
go	c
in	c
July	c
,	c
the	c
summer	c
holiday	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
got	c
a	c
place	c
in	i
the	i
university	c
and	c
it	c
will	c
start	c
in	c
August	c

When	c
I	c

in	c
the	c

The	c
first	c
and	c
most	c
important	c
thing	c
is	c
that	c
modern	c
technology	c
have	i
made	c
our	c
life	c
easier	c
,	c
for	c
instance	c
ricer	i
cooker	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
invention	c
,	c
all	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
do	c
is	c
putting	i
rice	c
on	i
it	c
and	c
switch	c
on	i
,	c
it	c
makes	c
cooking	c
more	c
effeciently	i
.	c

It	c
is	c
often	c
suggested	c
that	c
,	i
modern	c
technology	c
makes	c
the	c
gap	c
bigger	c
between	c
peoples	i
,	c
they	c
get	c
used	c
to	c
communicating	c
with	c
the	c
machine	c
then	c
forget	c
how	c
to	c
deal	c
with	c
human	c
beings	c

Mr	c
Smith	c
,	c

Spending	c
a	c
week	c
in	c
London	c
for	i
holidays	i
last	c
week	c
,	c
I	c
had	i
decided	i
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
see	c
your	c
wonderful	c
musical	c
show	c
.	c

Then	c
,	c
the	c
actors	c
(	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
)	c
who	c
were	c
mentioned	c
and	i
supposed	i
to	c
play	i
were	c
n't	c
present	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
disappointed	c
because	c
D.	c
Brook	c
and	c
T.	c
Truelove	c
are	c
so	i
great	c
actors	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
excited	c
to	i
see	i
them	c
.	c

No	c
reasons	c
were	c
indicated	i
.	c

Human	i
being	i
became	c
more	c
and	c
more	c
clever	c
and	c
built	c
wonerful	i
things	c
thanks	c
to	c
his	c
thoughts	c
and	c
his	c

Dear	c
Mrs.	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
extremly	i
happy	c
about	c
this	c
.	c

Taking	c
picture	i
is	c
a	c
new	c
experience	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

How	c
are	c
you	c
doing	c
?	c

I	c
could	c
n't	c
write	c
you	i
because	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
busy	c
.	c

Last	c
month	c
I	c
enjoyed	c
helping	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
in	c
my	c
town	c
.	c

You	c
can	c
imagine	c
how	c
disappointed	c
I	c
was	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
to	c
prepare	c
the	c
ingredians	i
for	c
every	c
meal	c
.	c

The	c
people	c
were	c
all	c
really	c
funny	c
and	c
we	c
were	c
a	c
good	c
team	c
.	c

And	c
what	c
about	c
you	c
?	c

I	c
am	c
interested	c
to	c
hear	c
about	c
your	c
new	c
dog	c
?	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madame	i
,	c

I	c
am	c
deeply	c
disapointed	i
with	c
the	c
service	c
and	c
the	c
unrealiable	i
notice	i
,	i
at	c
your	c
theartre	i
.	c

You	c
also	c
mention	c
that	c
your	c
show	c
would	c
starts	i
at	c
19.30	c
but	c
to	c
my	c
knowleage	i
it	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
and	c
that	c
is	i
fourty-five	i
minutes	c
of	c
waiting	c
.	c

You	c
can	c
just	c
"	c
pop	c
down	c
the	c
road	c
"	c
and	c
go	c
shopping	c
.	c

It	c
is	c

You	c
ask	c
me	c
for	c
some	c
informations	i

here	c
they	i
are	i
.	c

First	c
I	c
can	c
do	i
the	i
travel	c
only	c
in	c

,	c
because	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
get	c
freetime	i
in	c
any	c
other	c
month	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
so	c
happy	c
when	c
they	c
told	i
me	c
to	c
help	c
them	c
with	c
the	c
organisation	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
responsible	c
to	i
the	c
advertisments	i
and	c
I	c
had	i
also	i
to	c
invite	c
the	c
"	c
important	c
persons	i
"	c
from	c
our	c
governement	i
.	c

I	c
've	c
learned	c
a	c
lot	c
about	c
management	c
and	c
especially	c
-	i
how	c
stars	c
are	i
living	i
.	c

Therefore	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
have	c
my	c
money	c

Please	c
contact	c
me	c
for	c
more	c
details	c
if	c
necessary	c

When	c
I	c
am	c
too	c
tied	i
to	c
go	c
out	c
but	c
want	c
to	c
meet	c
some	c
new	c
people	c
,	c
computer	c
technology	c
provides	c
me	c
with	c
this	i
opportunity	c
.	c

I	c
guess	c
I	c
have	c
n't	c
realised	c
until	c
now	c
how	c
much	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
has	c
been	c
changed	c
by	c
modern	c
technology	c

This	c

at	c
Central	i
Exhibition	c
Hall	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
from	c
10:00	c
to	c
19:00	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
would	i
accept	c
and	c
would	c
n't	c
mind	c
this	c
idea	c
,	c
we	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
visit	c
it	c
instead	c
of	c
shopping	c
in	c
the	c
afternoon	c
on	c
Tuesday	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
think	i
how	c

It	c
must	c
be	c
a	c
good	c
example	c
of	c

Human	c
right	i

Helen	c
Ryan	c

Yours	c

Therefore	c
she	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

While	c
in	c
California	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
sleep	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
can	c
live	i
closer	c
to	c
the	i
nature	c
.	c

Anyway	c
the	c
accommodation	c
is	c
not	c
a	c
big	c
problem	c
for	c
me	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
away	c
most	c
of	c
the	c
time	c
.	c

Moreover	c
would	i
like	c
if	i
it	c
is	c
possible	c
to	c
have	c
an	c
opportunity	c
to	c
play	c
tennis	c
and	c
basketball	c
.	c

OK	c
in	i
the	c
beginning	c
the	c
other	c
helpers	c
and	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
work	c
to	c
do	c
,	c
so	i
as	c
cleaning	c
the	c
stage	c
and	c
so	i
some	c
decoration	c
work	c
.	c

The	c
pop	c
concert	c
was	c
exellent	i
and	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
fun	c
.	c

About	c
the	c
prize	i

the	c

that	c
I	c
have	c
at	c

tells	i
that	c
there	c
were	c
discounts	c

,	c
if	c
these	c
discounts	c
are	c
true	i
I	c
could	c
n't	c
use	c
them	c

When	c
the	c
show	c
had	c
finished	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
visit	c
the	c
restaurant	i
of	i
the	i
theatre	i
because	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c

I	c
'm	c
sorry	c
if	c
I	c
make	i
any	i
problem	i
to	i
you	i
,	c
but	c
I	c
'm	c
very	c
angry	c
and	c
it	c
was	c
your	c
fault	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
attention	c
,	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c

But	c
in	c
a	c
few	c
days	c
she	c
told	c
the	c
secret	c
to	c
all	c
the	c
class	c
.	c

These	c
were	c
in	c
perfect	c
agreement	c
with	c
my	c
previous	c
opinion	c
about	i
your	c
company	c
,	c
which	c
is	c
said	c
to	c
be	c
the	c
best	c
exhibitor	i
of	c
musical	c
shows	c
in	c
Europe	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
realise	c
this	c
was	c
totally	c
different	c
from	c
what	c
you	c
advertised	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
in	c
the	c
very	c
near	c
future	c
offering	c
me	c
some	c
money	c
back	c

Every	c
one	c
hopes	c
to	c
enjoying	i
himself	c
and	c
comes	i
back	c
with	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
knowledge	c

What	c
do	c
famous	c
people	c
wish	i
?	c

Do	c
they	c
want	c
to	c
be	c
famous	c
and	c
ignored	c
?	c

You	c
were	c
born	c
with	c
the	c
talent	c
,	i
sometime	i
with	c
the	c
title	c

You	c
never	c
wished	c
to	c
be	c
famous	i
that	i
much	i

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c

Besides	c
when	c
I	c
went	c

the	c
restaurant	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c

and	c
I	c
could	c
not	c

Therefore	c
for	i

Sir	c
,	c
I	c
returned	c
very	c
unhappy	c
from	c
my	c
holidays	c
.	c

The	c
reason	c
is	c
that	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
that	c
I	c
had	c
seen	c
with	c
my	c
wife	c
,	c
first	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
started	c
late	c
.	c

With	c
all	c
this	i
problems	c
,	c
the	c
only	c
thing	c
that	c
led	i
us	i
,	i
was	c
to	i
eat	i
something	c
.	c

When	c
the	c
show	c
finished	c
we	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
and	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
people	i
did	c
n't	c
arrived	i
to	c
work	c
that	c
day	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
congratulate	c
you	c

"	c

Festival	c
"	c

I	c
had	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c

to	i
go	i
there	c
.	c

All	c
the	c
sections	c
of	c
your	c
festival	c
were	c
great	c
but	c
I	c
think	c
there	c
were	c
not	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
"	c
Plays	c
and	c
films	i
"	c
.	c

Concerning	c
the	c
tickets	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
your	c
price	c
is	c
reasonable	c
for	c
this	c
festival	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
fine	c
but	c
I	c
have	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c

to	c
do	c
for	c
my	c
school	c

My	c
exams	c
start	c
the	i
next	c

's	c
why	c
I	c
have	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
work	c

You	c
are	c
not	c

to	c
smoke	c

take	c
some	i
drugs	c

You	c
must	c

be	i

I	c

my	c

when	c
I	c
come	c
back	c
at	i

I	c
Hope	i
these	i

help	c
you	c

Keep	c

I	c

get	c
some	c

The	c
only	c
problem	c
is	c
that	c

am	c
a	c
student	c
I	c
can	c
travel	c
only	c
during	c

I	c
am	c

why	c
I	c

some	c

Dear	c

If	c
I	c
did	c

told	i

the	i
experience	c
of	i
the	c
pop	c
concert	c
in	c
detail	c
in	c
my	c
last	c

was	i
because	c
I	c
did	c

have	c
time	c

They	c
have	i
to	c
make	i
a	c
concert	c
in	c
my	c
city	c
so	c
when	c
they	c
arrived	c

my	c

invited	c
me	c
where	i
they	c
were	c

the	c
concert	c
.	c

,	c

However	c
,	c
about	c
accommodation	c
,	c
I	c
'd	c
prefer	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
,	c
becouse	i
it	c
is	c
more	c
confortable	i
than	c
the	i
tent	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
a	c
good	c
tennis	c
player	c
and	c
a	c
big	c
surfer	c
too	c
.	c

"	c
This	c
is	c
extraordinary	c
"	c
,	c
I	c
said	c
.	c

I	c
can	c
only	c
tell	c
that	i
had	i
been	c
an	c
important	c
experience	c
for	c
me	c
and	c
for	c
my	c
new	c
songs	c
.	c

I	c
THINK	c
YOU	c
HAVE	c
ALREADY	c
REALIZED	c
THAT	c
IT	c
WAS	c
N'T	c
A	c
PLEASURE	c
FOR	c
US	c
TO	c
SEE	c
THE	c
SHOW	c
,	c
SO	c
I	c
HOPE	c
YOU	c
COULD	i
GIVE	c
ME	c
OUR	c
MONEY	c
BACK	c
,	c
IF	c
YOU	c
CA	c
N'T	c
,	c
PLEASE	c
,	c
AT	c

GIVE	c
ME	c
AN	c
EXPLANATION	c

HOW	c
HAS	c
MODERN	c
TECHNOLOGY	c
CHANGED	c
YOUR	c
DAILY	c
LIFE	c
?	c

TODAY	c
,	c
I	c
CAN	c
TAKE	i
MOST	c
OF	c
MY	c
SCHOOL	i
'S	i
HOMEWORKS	i
FROM	i
THE	c
COMPUTER	c
ENCYCLOPAEDIA	c
AND	c
IT	c
DOES	c
N'T	c
WEIGHT	i
MORE	c
THAN	c
AN	c
APPLE	c
!	c

Finally	c
,	c
at	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
this	c
very	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
,	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
-	c
which	c
was	c
also	c
mentioned	c
in	c
your	c
ad	c
-	c
but	c
I	c
was	c
told	c
that	c
this	c
latter	i
was	c
closed	c
because	i
of	i
a	c
private	c
party	c
!	c

She	c
felt	c
all	c
the	c
more	c
ill	c
at	c
ease	c
as	c
Sally	c
trusted	c
her	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
excited	c
with	i
the	c
idea	c
of	c
going	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
did	c
n't	c
work	c
out	c
as	c
I	c
thought	c
it	c
will	i

I	c
hope	c
you	c
understand	c

Pat	c
's	c
story	c

Two	c
years	c
ago	c
in	c
this	c
school	c
,	c
Pat	c
and	c
I	c
used	c
to	c
be	c
best	c
friends	c
.	c

We	c
used	c
to	c
tell	c
everything	c
to	c
each	c
other	c
.	c

Pat	c
was	c
worried	c
,	c
she	c
did	c
n't	c
know	c
what	c
to	c
do	c
.	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

It	c
was	c
so	c
easy	c
,	i
a	i
mean	c
we	c
just	c
carried	c
all	c
the	c
instruments	c
from	i
the	c
musicians	c
to	c
the	c
Club	c
and	c
we	c
put	c
it	i
on	c
the	c
stage	c
.	c

The	c
concert	c
was	c
in	c
a	c
massive	c
club	c
and	c
the	c
tickets	c
were	c
sold	c
out	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
,	c

Unfortunately	c
last	i
evening	c
there	c
was	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
and	c
that	c
was	c
very	c
disappointing	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
entered	c
to	i
the	c
theatre	c
to	c
enjoy	c
the	c
musical	c
but	c
I	c
do	c
not	c
know	c
the	c
reason	c
why	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
a	c
quarter	c
past	c
eight	c
(	c
three	c
quarters	c
delayed	i
)	c
.	c

For	c
instance	c
,	c
modern	c
technology	c
is	c
changing	c
the	c
way	c
I	c
work	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
modern	c
technology	c
is	c
changing	c
my	c
work	c
,	c
my	c
life	c
,	c
and	c
my	c
friends	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
did	c
not	c
start	c
on	c
time	c
but	c
fourty-five	i
minutes	c
later	i
.	c

This	c
made	c
me	c
a	c
little	c
bit	c
angry	c
because	c
I	c
already	c
had	c
troubles	i
with	i
buying	c
a	c
ticket	c
before	i
:	c
although	c
it	c
was	c
proclaimed	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
,	c
there	c
were	c
no	c
£	c
15	c
and	c
£	c
10	c
discounts	c
available	c
.	c

The	c
worst	c
thing	c
of	c
all	c
was	c
that	c
at	c
the	c
beggining	i
of	c
the	c
show	c
I	c
realized	c
that	c
the	c
actors	c
were	c
totally	c
different	c
.	i

After	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
my	c
friends	c
and	c
I	c
were	c
very	c
furious	c
in	i
spite	i
of	i
that	i
.	c

We	c
decided	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
to	c
eat	c
something	c
and	c
to	c
relax	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
absolutely	i
annoyed	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
your	i
answer	c
soon	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
.	c

At	i
the	c
end	c
all	i
people	i
will	c
be	c
short-sight	i
.	c

And	c
is	c
it	c
better	c
to	c
have	c
change	i
or	c
checks	i
?	c

So	c
it	c
's	c
really	c
not	c
enjoyable	c
to	c
go	c
shopping	c
.	c

Plus	c
most	i
of	c
the	c
time	c
,	c
you	c
see	c
all	c
those	c
mothers	c
looking	c
after	c
their	c
kids	c
,	c
and	c
yelling	c
their	c
name	i
's	i
kids	i
into	i
the	c
shopping	c
mall	c
because	c
they	c
lost	i
them	c
.	c

Your	c
next	c
question	c
is	c
about	c
the	c
activities	c
that	c
I	c
could	c
do	c
at	c
the	c
camp	c
,	i
after	i
browse	i
through	c
the	c
list	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
take	c
part	c
in	c
climbing	c
and	c
photography	i
activities	c
,	c
as	c
these	c
are	c
my	c
favourite	c
hobbies	c
.	c

Looking	c
forward	c
for	i
your	c
answer	c
.	c

Finally	c
you	c
've	c
found	c
out	i
something	c
really	c
wonderful	c
,	i
time	c
to	c
pay	c
!	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
,	c
but	c
do	c
n't	c
worry	c
,	c
the	c
shooping	i
center	i
still	i
there	c
waiting	c
for	c
you	c
!	c

I	c
've	c
already	c
talked	c
to	c
my	c
manager	c
,	c
and	c
she	c
said	c
that	c
that	c
's	c
the	c
only	c
mounth	i
I	c
can	c
have	c
my	c
holidays	c
.	c

I	c
've	c
been	c
playing	c
Golf	c
for	c
five	c
years	c
,	c
and	c
I	i
'm	i
a	c
handidate	i
cup	i
of	c
sixteen	c
,	c
but	c
the	c
problem	c
is	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
n't	c
been	c
playing	c
Golf	c
for	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
because	c
I	c
work	c
every	c
day	c
.	c

I	c
wish	c
you	c
were	i
there	c
with	c
me	c
helping	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
.	c

You	c
know	c
how	c
good	c
I	i
'm	i
at	c
music	c
,	i
anyway	i
I	c
was	c
helping	c
to	i
these	i
pop	c
concert	c
to	c
get	c
the	c
corect	i
sounds	c
,	i
at	i
the	c
bigging	i
I	c
was	c
conecting	i
all	c
these	c
wires	c
into	c
spekers	i
,	c
music	c
system	c
,	c
guitar	i
etc	c
...	c

The	c
particularly	i
bit	i
that	i
I	i
liked	c
about	c
the	c
experience	c
was	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
standing	c
next	c
to	c
the	c
singers	c
and	c
playing	c
a	c
guitar	c
,	i
you	c
know	c
how	c
much	c
I	c
love	c
playing	c
guitar	c
,	i
and	c
all	c
these	c
video	c
cameras	c
were	c
just	c
filming	c
us	c
.	c

These	c
singers	c
are	c
going	c
to	c
come	c
next	c
year	c
so	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
invite	c
you	c
to	c
my	c
house	c
for	c
one	c
or	c
two	c
weeks	c
to	c
see	c
these	i
pop	c
concert	c
,	i
beleave	i
me	c
you	i
'll	c
love	c
it	c
and	c
you	c
might	c
use	i
the	c
drums	c
,	i
I	c
told	c
them	c
that	c
you	c
're	c
really	c
good	c
at	i
drums	c
so	c
they	c
want	c
to	c
try	c
you	c
too	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
some	c
pain	i
on	i
my	c
back	i
therefore	i
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
sleep	c
in	c
the	i
sleeping	c
bag	c
on	c
the	c
ground	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
love	c
to	c
do	c
Basketball	i
and	c
Painting	i
activities	c
while	c
I	c
am	c
at	c
the	c
Camp	i
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
do	c
painting	c
which	i
I	c
am	c
really	c
interested	c
in	c
and	i
as	c
a	c
student	c
of	i
Art	i
College	i
.	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

Firstly	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
disappointed	c
in	i
finding	i
out	c
that	c
not-ever-heard	i
actors	c
were	c
playing	c
instead	c
of	c
the	c
ones	c
we	c
all	c
expected	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
to	c
this	c
,	c
I	c
heard	i
bad	c
singers	c
and	c
noticed	c
a	c
numertable	i
lack	c
of	c
variety	c
in	c
ballets	i
.	c

I	c
've	c
been	c
told	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
of	c
a	c
waiters	c
'	c
strike	c
.	c

Among	c
the	c
numerous	c
choices	c
of	c
activities	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
considering	c
taking	c
those	c
of	c
golf	c
and	c
surfing	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
as	c
this	c
will	c
be	c
my	c
first	c
time	c
to	i
go	i
surfing	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
willing	c
to	c
take	c
classes	c
for	c
beginners	c
.	c

Lots	c
and	c
lots	c
of	c
kisses	c
,	c

On	i
the	i
other	i
hand	i
,	c
it	i
there	c
was	i
n't	i
any	c
discounts	c
in	i
the	c
sell	i
of	c
the	c
tickets	c
.	c

Of	c
course	c
,	c
what	c
it	i
was	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
a	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
turned	c
into	c
a	c
very	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
very	i
greatful	i
if	c
you	c
refund	i
me	c
a	i
compensation	i
.	c

In	c
fact	c
,	c
if	c
I	c
had	c
knowned	i
,	c
I	c
would	c
have	c
probably	c
stayed	c
at	c
home	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
if	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
buy	c
something	c
,	c
I	c
have	i
to	i
go	i
on	c
my	c
computer	c
and	c
buy	c
it	c
.	c

In	c
fact	c
,	c
I	c
like	c
technology	c
but	c
sometimes	c
I	c
wish	c
it	c
had	i
n't	i
existed	c
since	c
there	c
are	c
too	c
many	c
things	c
on	c
market	i
.	c

The	c
first	c
problem	c
we	c
had	c
was	c
that	c
the	c
discounts	c
announced	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
were	c
not	c
available	c
and	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
pay	c
the	c
full	c
ticket	i
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
all	c
these	c
problems	c
could	c
have	c
been	c
avoided	c
and	c
that	c
asking	c
my	i
money	c
back	c
is	c
the	c
best	c
way	c
of	c
forgetting	c
that	c
evening	c
.	c

Clothes	c
will	c
have	c
a	c
strong	c
relation	c
to	c
the	c
new	c
technologies	c
and	i
modern	c
devices	c
will	c
be	c
included	c
in	c
our	c
daily	i
clothes	c
.	c

In	c
your	c
advertisment	i
you	c
mentionned	i
that	c
there	c
is	i
artists	c
and	c
stars	c
from	i
all	i
around	i
the	i
world	i
coming	i
,	c
unfortunately	c
I	c
found	c
out	c
only	c
six	c
countries	c
were	c
represented	c
.	c

Hoping	c
that	c
I	c
did	i
not	i
offend	i
you	c
in	c
any	c
ways	i
and	c
that	c
you	c
might	c
take	c
in	i
consideration	c
my	c
suggestion	i
,	c
I	c
wish	c
you	c
all	c
the	c
best	c
for	c
next	c
year	c
's	c
festival	c
organisation	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	i

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
musical	c
'	c
OVER	c
THE	c
RAINBOW	c
'	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
could	c
get	i
a	c
good	c
seat	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
to	c
this	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
start	c
at	c
19.30	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
20.15	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
receiving	c
your	i
satisfactory	c
reply	c
by	c
return	c
of	c
post	c
.	c

On	c
balance	c
then	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
modern	c
technology	c
really	c
affects	c
my	c
life	c
even	c
though	c
I	c
feel	c
that	c
it	c
improves	i
too	c
rapidly	c
to	i
catch	c
up	c
.	c

According	c
to	c
the	c
advertisement	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
should	c
have	c
started	c
at	c
19.30	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
did	c
n't	c
begin	c
before	c
20.15	c
.	c

The	c
actors	c
were	c
not	c
the	c
ones	c
expected	c
:	c
there	c
was	c
no	c
sign	c
of	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
and	c
the	c
person	c
who	c
played	c
his	c
part	c
was	c
very	c
disappointing	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
a	c
little	c
hungry	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
but	i
then	i
again	i
,	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
find	c
another	c
restaurant	c
since	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
with	c
no	c
further	c
information	c
.	i

No	c
one	c
knew	c
apart	c
from	c
me	c
and	c
my	c
mother	c
.	c

Dear	c
Madam	c

I	c
'm	c
very	c
happy	c
to	c
have	c
won	c
in	i
your	c
competition	c
.	c

I	i
'm	i
never	i
going	i
in	i
the	c
U.S.A	c
than	i
I	c
'm	c
very	c
exciting	i
to	c
travel	i
at	i
Camp	c
California	c
.	c

My	c
two	c
activities	i
's	i
choices	i
are	c
Climbing	i
and	i
Surfing	i

Anton	c
Chevalier	c

I	c
purpose	i
that	c
we	c
should	c
be	i
filmed	i
five	c
topics	i
:	c

-	c
Before	c
the	c
end	c
we	c
could	c
visit	c
the	c
staff	c
room	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
more	c
interesting	c
than	c
log	i
cabins	i
.	c

When	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
child	c
,	c
I	c
used	c
to	c
go	c
swimming	c
with	c
my	c
family	c
at	c
the	c
weekend	c
having	i
a	c
chat	c
,	c
making	c
a	c
barbecue	c
,	c
playing	c
games	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
such	c
a	c
good	c
time	c
.	c

I	c
enjoy	c
painting	c
as	c
well	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

I	c
've	c
got	c
some	c
great	c
news	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
.	c

Last	c
month	c
,	c
I	c
worked	i
as	i
a	c
part-time	c
job	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
know	c
,	c
I	c
'm	c
crazy	c
about	c
pop	c
music	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
such	c
a	c
big	c
concert	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
really	c
exciting	i
.	c

My	c
hands	c
were	c
sclumbling	i
but	c
I	c
did	c
it	c
very	c
well	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
sorry	c
that	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
ask	c
them	i
to	i
take	i
any	i
pictures	i
for	c
you	c
.	c

For	c
instance	c
,	c
taking	c
them	c
to	c
toilet	i
,	c
making	c
coffee	c
for	c
them	c
,	c
helping	c
them	c
find	c
their	c
stuff	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
really	c
busy	c
but	c
I	c
really	c
enjoyed	c
it	c
.	c

It	i
was	i
a	c
great	c
time	c
.	c

Take	c
care	c
of	c
yourself	c
and	c
I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
had	i
n't	i
such	c
perfect	i
evening	c
,	i
as	c
was	c
promised	c
in	c
your	c
advertisment	i
.	c

How	c
has	c
modern	c
technology	c
changed	c
your	c
daily	c
life	c
?	c

I	c
have	c
to	c
use	c
computer	i
every	c
day	c
.	c

With	c
the	c
help	c
of	c
Internet	i
technologies	c
I	c
communicate	c
with	c
other	c
people	c
from	c
all	c
over	c
the	c
world	c
it	c
gives	c
me	c
chance	i
to	c
improve	c
my	c
English	c
.	c

By	c
the	c
way	c
,	c
according	c
to	c
the	c
advertisement	c
,	c
lots	c
of	c
stars	c
and	c
artists	c
from	c
around	c
the	c
world	c
were	c
supposed	c
to	c
be	c
invited	c
for	c
the	c
festival	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
was	c
able	c
to	c
meet	c
them	c
just	i
from	c
only	c
six	c
countries	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
mention	c
reasonably-priced	i
weekend	c
ticket	c
.	c

Faithfully	c
yours	c

Long	i
time	c
ago	c
,	c
there	c
were	c
two	c
brothers	c
,	c
whose	c
parents	c
were	c
dead	c
.	c

Their	c
parents	c
were	c
rich	c
,	c
so	c
when	c
they	c
passed	c
away	c
they	c
left	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
money	c
.	c

He	c
did	c
n't	c
want	c
to	c
share	c
the	c
money	c
with	c
his	c
brother	c
,	c
Hungbu	c
so	i
he	c
took	c
all	c
of	c
the	c
money	c
,	c
and	c
said	c
to	c
Hungbu	c
to	c
go	c
away	c
from	c
the	c
house	c
without	c
anything	c
.	c

Therefore	c
,	c
Hungbu	c
became	c
much	c
richer	c
than	c
Nolbu	c
,	c
and	c
he	c
lived	c
happily	c
with	c
the	c
money	c
helping	c
the	c
poor	c
.	c

People	c
belive	i
that	c
the	c
bird	c
was	c
sent	c
by	i
heaven	c
.	c

This	c
story	c
happened	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
ago	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
sorry	c
but	c
I	c
must	c
admit	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
bit	c
disappointing	c
.	c

So	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
keep	c
myself	c
occupied	c
for	c
a	c
while	c
,	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
restaurant	c
except	i
it	c
was	c
n't	c
open	c
.	c

No	c
one	c
.	c

Then	c
a	c
person	c
appeared	c
,	c
walking	c
towards	c
the	c
door	c
to	c
the	c
kitchen	c
,	c
I	c
guessed	c
.	c

Reply	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c
,	c

I	c
think	c
they	c
'll	c
be	c
based	c
on	c
some	c
kind	c
of	c
space	c
theme	c
and	c
aliens	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
I	i
had	i
ever	i
been	i
in	i
the	i
US	i
so	i
I	i
have	i
any	i
idea	i
about	i
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
will	c
probably	c
need	c
and	i
about	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
have	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
your	c
attencion	i
on	i
my	i
regard	i

If	c
you	c
ask	c
at	i
twenty	c
womans	i
what	c
is	i
their	i
favorite	i
hobbies	i
probably	c
the	i
most	c
of	c
them	c
will	c
answer	c
"	c
shopping	c
"	c
.	c

But	c
why	c
is	c
shopping	c
so	c
popular	c
and	c
loved	c
by	c
so	c
many	c
people	c
all	c
over	c
the	c
world	c
?	c

Maybe	c
you	c
can	i
think	c
I	c
am	c
excessive	i
but	c
recent	c
studies	c
prouves	i
that	c
this	c
mania	c
can	c
be	c
really	c
dangerous	c
.	c

Certenly	i
the	i
only	i
fact	i
of	i
have	i
something	c
can	c
helps	i
people	c
to	c
be	c
more	c
sure	c
of	c
himself	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
this	c
letter	c
to	c
make	i
you	c
know	c
the	i
bad	c
points	c
of	c
the	c
theatre	c
.	c

This	c
was	c
very	c
disappointing	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
was	c
buying	c
a	c
ticket	c
,	c
there	c
was	c
no	c
discount	c
.	c

I	c
paid	c
£	c
20	c
to	c
the	c
cashier	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
very	c
rude	c
.	c

TECHNOLOGICAL	c
ADVANTAGES	c

But	c
if	c
they	c
were	c
n't	c
made	c
,	c
we	c
would	c
have	c
to	c
walk	c
or	c
go	c
by	c
a	i
horse	c
or	c
donkey	c
.	c

But	c
now	c
we	c
use	c
planes	c
to	c
go	c
far	i
places	i
.	c

It	c
is	c
bad	c
for	c
the	i
world	i
's	i
piece	i
.	c

She	c
was	c
so	c
angry	c
and	c
felt	c
so	c
betrayed	c
by	c
Mr	c
White	c
that	c
without	c
any	c
exitation	i
she	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
school	c
Headmaster	c
to	c
report	c
everything	c
she	c
had	c
seen	c
.	c

The	c
trial	c
was	c
long	c
and	c
had	i
a	i
wide	c
coverage	c
by	i
media	i
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
the	c
only	c
suitable	c
time	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
go	c
is	c
July	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
the	c
only	c
time	c
when	c
I	c
am	c
free	c
from	c
my	c
duties	c
-	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
doctor	c
so	c
you	c
see	c
that	c
I	c
can	i
not	i
let	c
my	c
patients	c
down	c
.	c

There	c
is	c
also	c
one	c
thing	c
that	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
You	i
about	c
.	c

Anna	c
Nowak	c

We	c
buy	c
everything	c
from	c
clothes	c
to	c
food	c
and	c
the	c
only	c
thing	c
that	c
could	c
stop	c
us	c
from	c
this	c
are	i
money	c
.	c

However	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
agree	c
with	c
opinion	i
that	c
,,Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
''	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
everybody	c
like	i
to	c
buy	c
but	c
not	c
everybody	c
like	i
to	c
see	i
pleasure	c
in	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
been	c
informed	c
that	c
all	c
accommodation	c
and	c
travel	c
cost	i
are	c
paid	c
for	c
the	i
company	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
love	c
to	c
do	c
climbing	c
and	c
surfing	c
just	c
because	c
those	c
are	c
sports	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
praticed	i
before	c
,	i
that	i
means	c
I	c
do	c
not	c
have	c
any	c
experience	c
on	i
the	i
subject	i

Please	c
let	c
me	c
know	c
the	i
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
we	c
will	c
be	c
wearing	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c
As	c
you	c
already	c
know	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
last	c
month	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
there	c
at	c
seven	c
a.m	c
and	c
did	c
n't	c
go	c
home	c
until	c
seven	c
a.m	c
the	c
following	c
day	c
.	c

The	c
part	c
that	c
I	c
enjoyed	c
the	c
most	c
was	c
that	c
I	c
felt	c
I	c
was	c
doing	c
something	c
worthly	i
for	c
the	c
community	c
and	c
also	c
that	c
I	c
got	c
to	c
meet	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
people	c
.	c

I	c
made	c
great	c
friends	c
with	c
the	c
group	c
I	c
worked	c
with	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
great	c
experience	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
hope	c
we	c
will	c
organize	c
another	c
concert	c
soon	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
to	c
California	c
this	c
July	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
can	c
take	c
an	i
holiday	c
from	c
14th	c
to	c
27th	c
of	c
July	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
log	c
cabins	c

Also	c

I	c

Please	c

I	c
like	c

one	c
of	c
my	c
favorite	i

have	c
just	c
received	c
your	c
letter	c
and	c
feel	c
happy	c
about	c
winning	c
first	c
prize	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
only	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
employed	c
and	c
will	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
finish	c
my	c
contract	c
in	c
June	c
.	c

On	i
August	c
I	c
am	c
going	c
to	c
apply	c
for	c
a	c
new	c
job	c
.	c

Also	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
rather	c
than	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c

.	c

-	c
What	c
is	c
the	c
weather	c
in	c
California	c
in	c
July	c
?	c

-	c
Are	c
there	c

travel	i
to	c
London	c
,	c
during	c
the	c
last	c
holiday	c

because	c
it	c
was	c
great	c

Conclusion	c
:	c
It	c
is	c
clear	c
,	i
that	c
the	c
filming	i
of	c
video	i
is	c
very	i
important	c
event	c
for	c
children	i
,	c
and	c
pupils	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
film	c
only	c
positive	i
events	c
of	c
their	c
life	c
at	c
school	c
as	i
I	c
have	c
written	c
above	c
.	c

As	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
expect	c
to	c
be	c
successful	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
happy	c
about	c
this	c
result	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
I	c
am	c
really	c
keen	c
on	c
swimming	c
and	c
can	c
therefore	c
hardly	c
await	i
having	i
the	c
possibility	i
to	c
learn	c
the	c
butterfly	c
as	c
a	c
new	c
style	c
since	c
I	c
am	c
already	c
perfect	c
in	i
crawl	i
.	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

I	c
helped	c
at	c
a	c
pop	i
concert	i
of	i
a	i
newcomer	i
group	i
and	c
you	c
ca	c
n't	c
imagine	c
how	c
exciting	c
it	c
was	c
!	c

But	c
the	c
cherry	c
on	c
the	c
cake	c
was	c
that	c
I	c
met	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
handsome	c
singers	c
back	i
stage	i
!	c

I	c
like	i
to	c
apologise	c
with	i
you	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
did	i
n't	i
wrote	i
to	c
you	c
recently	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
like	i
to	c
tell	c
you	c
what	c
hapend	i
to	c
me	c
in	i
the	i
last	c
weak	i
I	i
had	c
the	c
opportunity	c
to	c
help	c
in	i
one	c
of	c
the	c
most	c
pop	i
concert	i
in	c
my	c
city	c
,	i
so	i
imagen	i
,	c
I	c
fell	i
really	c
really	c
good	c
and	c
exating	i
for	i
that	i
I	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
words	c
for	i
describe	i
but	i
I	c
try	i
to	c
do	c
it	c
,	c
OK	c
?	c

Next	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
find	c
out	c
some	c
details	c
about	c
the	c
camp	c
.	c

Before	i
.	i

I	c
am	c
very	c
interested	c
in	c
tennis	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
am	c
also	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
photography	c
.	c

It	c
has	c
been	c
my	c
hobby	c
since	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
child	c
.	c

That	c
is	c
why	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
continue	c
doing	c
this	c
at	c
the	c
camp	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Next	c
,	c
it	c
can	c
be	c
very	c
good	c
for	c
your	c
wallet	c
to	c
save	c
some	c
money	c
,	c
when	c
you	c
will	i
find	c
a	c
bargain	c
or	c
sales	c
.	c

What	c
is	c
more	c
,	c
most	c
people	c
cannot	c
live	c
without	c
shopping	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
their	c
way	c
to	c
spend	c
free	c
time	c
.	c

Very	c
often	c
people	c
go	c
to	c
a	c
shop	c
-	c
usually	c
a	c
big	c
departament	i
store	c
and	c
buy	c
things	c
which	c
they	c
do	c
not	c
need	c
.	c

From	c
my	c
point	c
of	c
view	c
it	c
depands	i
on	c
us	c
if	i
shopping	c
will	c
be	c
enjoyable	c
or	c
not	c
.	c

Further	i
more	i
,	c
I	c
should	c
choose	c
between	c
two	c
activities	c
and	c
how	i
good	c
I	c
am	c
at	c
each	c
one	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
fine	i
.	c

I	c
can	c
say	c
that	c
this	c
was	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
best	c
experiences	c
of	c
my	c
life	c
.	c

First	c
I	c
have	i
help	i
to	c
cook	i
coffee	c
and	c
make	i
food	c
for	c
popular	i
people	i
like	c
Mariah	c
Carey	c
,	c
Elton	c
John	c
,	c
Backstreet	c
Boys	c
,	c
Echt	i
ect	i
...	c

At	i
the	i
time	i
the	i
concert	i
was	i
running	i
I	c
cleaned	c
the	c
kitchen	c
and	c
the	c
room	c
where	c
the	c
"	c
stars	c
"	c
ate	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
just	c
great	c
and	c
after	c
this	c
event	c
I	c
can	c
say	c
that	c
popular	i
people	i
are	c
normal	c
humans	c
like	c
everyone	c

Yours	c
Sincerelly	i
,	c

Firstly	c
,	c
the	c
great	c
boom	c
of	i
massive	i
comunication	i
wich	i
happened	c
in	i
the	c
beginning	c
of	c
our	c
decade	c
,	c
with	c
the	c
devellopment	i
of	c
telephones	c
,	c
radio	c
stations	c
,	c
television	c
and	c
even	c
satelites	i
,	c
and	c
of	c
course	c
,	c
the	c
internet	i
,	c
gave	c
common	i
people	c
the	c
chance	c
to	c
take	c
off	c
on	c
a	c
trip	c
all	c
over	c
the	c
world	c
,	c
and	c
this	c
provided	i
health	c
and	c
education	c
researches	i
to	c
increase	c
as	c
well	c
.	c

In	i
the	i
other	i
hand	i
,	c
technology	c
has	c
made	i
the	c
differences	c
between	c
-	i
poor	c
and	c
rich	c
people	c
to	c
grow	i
at	i
a	i
high	i
level	i
,	c
and	c
this	c
is	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
biggest	c
causes	c
of	c
violence	c
in	c
all	c
countries	c
.	c

For	i
sailing	c
,	c
well	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
n't	c
try	i
it	c
before	c
,	i
that	i
is	c
why	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
try	i
.	c

I	c
think	c
most	c
people	c
will	c
agree	c
with	i
"	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
"	c
.	c

Just	c
imagine	c
if	c
one	c
day	c
their	c
husbands	c
lost	c
their	c
jobs	c
,	i
will	i
those	c
women	c
still	c
thinking	i
shopping	c
is	c
enjoyable	c
!	c

Shopping	c
is	c
just	c
like	c
a	c
nightmare	c
to	c
me	c
,	i
I	c
think	c
I	c
will	c
never	c
understand	c
why	c
people	c
love	c
shopping	c
.	c

2	c
.	c

It	c
would	c
be	c
wonderful	c
to	c
buy	c
some	c
books	c
or	c
programms	i
with	c
signatures	i
of	c
all	c
the	c
stars	c
and	c
artists	c
taking	c
part	c
in	c
the	c
festival	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
this	c
letter	c
will	c
help	c
you	c
in	i
organying	i

2	c
.	c

Otherwise	c
you	c
are	c
not	c
allowed	c
to	c
come	c
in	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
just	c
received	c
your	c
letter	c
and	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
all	c
this	c
information	c
that	c
you	c
giving	i
me	c
.	c

Despite	c
the	i
small	i
expereance	i
in	c
climbing	c
I	c
do	c
want	c
to	c
try	c
this	c
type	c
of	c
sport	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hear	i
from	c
you	c
.	c

Fistly	i
,	c
the	c
English	c
lesson	i
must	c
be	c
filmed	c
as	c
the	c
most	c
interesting	c
lesson	i
at	c
our	c
school	c
because	c
it	c
will	c
give	c
to	i
students	c
an	c
interest	c
to	i
study	i
and	c
improve	i
their	c
noleges	i
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
afraid	c
that	c
some	c
concert	c
halls	c
where	c
jazz	c
,	c
rock	c
and	c
classical	c
concerts	c
were	c
held	c
were	c
too	c
small	c
and	c
perhaps	c
you	c
could	c
arrange	c
to	c
use	c
bigger	c
ones	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
coming	c
to	c
the	c

again	c

For	i
a	i
start	i
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
books	c
offer	c
us	c
a	c
wide	c
range	c
of	c
different	c
life	c
stories	c
,	c
both	c
realistic	c
and	c
unusual	c
,	c
they	c
make	c
us	c
thoughtful	c
and	c
form	c
our	c
outlook	c
,	c
they	i
make	c
us	c
feel	c
and	c
think	c
.	c

It	c
contributes	c
to	c
the	c
world	i
treasurehouse	i
of	c
literature	c
and	c
arouses	c
irresistable	i
fascination	c

The	c

about	c
their	c

The	c

Furthermore	c
I	c
will	c
have	c
the	c
opportunity	c
to	c
play	c

despite	c
the	c
fact	c
that	c
I	c
am	c
not	c
too	i
tall	c
for	c
this	c
kind	c
of	c

All	c

The	c

We	c
can	c
film	c
our	c
Swimming	c
pool	c
,	c
despite	i
the	i
artificial	i
sunbathing	i

The	c
gym	c
is	c
good	i
choice	c
for	c
filming	c
with	c
the	c
sophisticated	c
equipments	i
that	c
owns	i

It	c
will	c

more	i
better	c

Second	c
,	c
I	c
prefer	c
log	c
cabins	c
than	i
tents	c

However	c
,	c
if	c
the	c
log	c
cabins	c
are	c
not	c
available	c
at	c
the	c
moment	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
stay	c
in	c
the	c
tents	c

Third	c
,	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
choose	c
painting	c
and	c
surfing	c
for	c
the	c
activities	c

Also	c
,	c
painting	c
is	c
one	c
of	c
my	c
favorite	i

Lastly	c
,	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
some	c
questions	c

I	c
know	c
everything	c
is	c
included	c
and	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
need	c
to	c
pay	c
anything	c
but	i
in	i
case	i
should	i
I	i
bring	i
some	i
money	i
or	c
not	c
?	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
reading	c
this	c
letter	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
really	c
looking	c
forward	c
this	i
camp	c
.	c

How	c
are	c
you	c
?	c

First	c
,	c
we	c
went	c
to	c
this	c
office	c
to	c
apply	c
for	c
this	c
job	c
.	c

The	c
interview	c
was	c
OK	c
and	c
my	c
friend	c
and	c
I	c
was	i
hired	c
!	c

After	c
working	c
30	c
minute	i
,	c
a	c
singer	c
appeared	c
.	c

While	c
we	c
were	c
organizing	c
the	c
concert	c
,	c
she	c
was	c
singing	c
on	c
a	c
stage	c
.	c

I	c
just	c
imagined	c
what	c
it	c
was	c
like	c
to	c
be	c
a	c
singer	c
.	c

During	c
the	c
concert	c
,	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
stand	c
to	c
protect	c
this	c
singer	c
.	c

We	c
saw	c
some	c
very	c
strange	c
fans	c
but	c
most	c
of	c
them	c
were	c
quite	c
nice	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
great	c
experience	c
for	c
me	c
and	c
my	c
friend	c
.	c

Competition	c
Organiser	c

As	c
well	c
as	c
this	c
one	i
I	c
'll	c
take	i
painting	c
,	c
I	c
'm	c
very	c
keen	c
on	c
art	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
I	c
'm	c
good	c
at	c
making	i
portraits	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
only	c
in	c
July	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
only	c
one	c
month	i
holliday	i
this	c
year	c
.	c

Like	i
you	c
know	c
last	i
month	c
,	i
I	c
had	i
helped	i
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
and	c
I	c
enjoyed	c
it	c
a	c
lot	c
.	c

Firstly	i
I	c
had	c
to	c
make	c
the	c
decor	i
of	i
the	c
scene	i
,	c
so	c
I	c
made	c
in	i
the	c
background	c
a	c
sky	c
with	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
bright	c
stars	c
.	c

Then	c
I	c
put	c
some	i
blue	c
lights	c
.	c

furthermore	i
I	c
made	c
some	c
stars	c
in	i
paper	i
in	i
argent	i
color	i
.	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
wonderful	c
experience	c
.	c

I	c
will	c
remember	c
that	c
day	c
for	c
the	c
rest	c
of	c
my	c
life	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Brown	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
the	c
play	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
start	c
at	c
7:30	c
P.M.	c
but	c
it	c
actually	c
started	c
only	i
at	c
8:15	c
P.M.	c
so	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
wait	c
forty-five	c
minutes	c
.	c

yours	c
faithful	i
,	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
we	c
all	i
became	i
much	c
more	c
sedentary	c
than	c
in	c
the	c
past	c
.	c

Most	c
of	c
the	c
modern	c
jobs	c
involves	i
computers	c
,	c
so	c
there	c
is	c
no	c
physical	c
effort	c
,	c
just	c
mental	c
,	c
but	c
,	c
on	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
we	c
improved	c
communications	c
with	c
computers	c
and	c
Internet	i
,	c
a	i
kind	c
of	c
communication	c
where	c
there	c
is	c
no	c
need	c
to	c
meet	c
personally	c
,	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
other	c
person	c
,	c
just	c
the	c
need	c
to	c
talk	c
.	c

Also	c
,	c
with	c
today	c
's	c
machines	c
,	c
factories	c
have	c
significantly	c
increased	c
their	c
production	c
,	c
what	i
brings	c
progress	c
to	c
humanity	c
,	c
but	c
also	c
,	c
with	c
the	c
continous	i
replacement	c
of	c
men	c
by	c
machines	c
,	c
the	i
unemployment	c
is	c
increasing	c
too	c
,	c
and	c
today	c
,	c
it	c
worries	c
every	c
single	c
citizen	c
of	c
the	c
world	c
,	c
specially	c
the	c
ones	c
who	c
lives	i
in	c
third	c
world	c
country	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
if	c
there	c
is	c
a	c
medical	c
staff	c
present	c
during	c
the	c
two	c
weeks	c
?	i

Why	c
can	i
shopping	i
be	i
unenjoyable	i
?	c

We	c
all	c
know	c
how	c
it	c
is	c
when	c
a	c
woman	c
tried	i
on	c
some	c
clothes	c
(	c
usually	c
several	c
)	i
but	c
it	i
's	i
still	c
better	c
than	c
when	c
we	c
're	c
talking	c
about	c
shoes	c

At	c

of	c
show	c
,	c
unfortunately	c
for	c
me	c
and	c
the	c
others	i
spectators	c
,	c
the	c
worst	c
thing	c
happened	c
:	c
the	c
theatre	c
's	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
without	c
any	c
reasons	c
and	i
nobody	c

for	i
an	i
other	i
restaurant	c
opened	i

That	c

To	i

To	c

I	c
would	c
like	c

a	c

I	c
hope	c
,	i
I	c
was	c
able	c
to	c
answer	c
your	c
questions	c

you	c

Yours	c

Vadim	c
Titov	c

I	c
was	c
given	c
the	c
opportunity	c
to	c
build	i
up	i
the	c
concert	c
and	c
of	c
course	c
I	c
took	i
my	i
chance	i
.	c

First	c
I	c
arrived	c
really	c
early	c
in	c
the	c
morning	c
on	i
the	c
place	c
,	c
but	c
the	c
people	c
were	c
just	c
working	c
and	c
I	c
joined	c
them	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
able	c
to	c
ask	c
anybody	c
,	c
and	c
he	c
answered	c
detailly	i
,	c
althoug	i
he	c
was	i
full	i
of	c
work	c
.	c

As	i
I	i
saw	i
from	i
your	i
advertisement	i
in	i
the	i
newspaper	i
,	i
it	i
said	i
'	c
Starring	c
:	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
'	c
.	c

And	c
from	i
your	c
advertisement	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
should	c
start	i
at	c
19.30	c
but	c
it	c
did	c
n't	c
.	c

And	c
also	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
buy	c
tickets	c
with	c
my	c
credit	c
card	c
but	c
on	c
the	c
advertisement	c
,	i
it	c
said	c
'	c
discounts	c
available	c
'	c
I	i
was	c
really	c
annoyed	c
by	c
that	c
!	c

So	c
one	c
week	c
later	c
all	c
student	i
in	c
my	c
class	c
knew	c
that	c
I	c
was	c
an	c
angle	i
.	c

I	c
promised	c
to	c
myself	c
...	c

I	c
went	c
to	c
Pat	c
's	c
house	c
but	c
her	c
brother	c
told	c
me	c
that	c
she	c
was	c
n't	c
there	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
want	c
to	c
go	c
back	c
to	c
the	i
heaven	c
anymore	c
as	c
long	c
as	c
I	c
am	c
with	c
him	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
reply	c
for	i
your	c
letter	c
about	c
competition	i
.	c

And	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
in	c
the	c
first	c
part	c
of	c
this	c
month	c
,	c
socond	i
part	c
I	c
spend	c
with	c
my	c
familly	i
.	c

The	c
second	c
activities	i
which	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
do	c
is	c
surfing	c
-	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
do	i
it	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Thise	c
book	c
is	c
about	c
men	i
who	c
know	i
that	c
he	c
will	c
die	c
soon	c
,	c
he	c
know	i
that	c
he	c
did	c
n't	c
made	i
his	c
dream	c
coom	i
tru	i
.	c

Hes	i
destenation	i
is	c
get	i
Marlin	i
.	c

We	c
must	c
believe	c
in	c
our	i
selfs	i
.	c

People	c
in	i
our	i
ages	i
should	c
think	c
about	c
this	c
.	c

Competition	c
Organiser	c

And	c
now	c
to	c
be	i
the	i
first	i
winner	i
.	i

But	c
anyway	c
I	i
like	i
more	i
to	i
have	i
the	i
possibilities	i
for	i
practice	i
climbing	c
and	c
surfing	c
.	c

Is	c
possible	i
to	c
get	c
there	i
?	c

At	i
the	i
same	i
situation	i
for	i
climbing	i
I	i
need	c
special	i
equipment	c
and	c
then	i
there	i
are	i
available	i
in	c
the	c
Camp	c
and	c
what	c
about	c
the	c
guide	c
for	c
these	c
activities	c
?	c

I	c
let	c
this	c
pass	c
and	c
I	c
bought	c
it	c
anyway	c
,	c
thinking	c
that	c
was	i
posible	i
that	c
it	i
was	c
only	c
a	c
mistake	c
in	c
your	c
advertisement	c
.	c

First	c
the	c
telegraph	c
and	c
the	c
radio	c
an	i
now	c
TV	c
,	c
the	c
telephone	c
and	c
the	c
Internet	c
allowed	i
people	c
be	i
in	c
contact	c
with	c
others	c
really	c
quickly	c
and	i
distances	c
arent	i
now	c
so	c
difficult	c
of	i
overcome	i
.	c

When	c
I	c
was	c
in	c
highschool	i
I	c
used	c
to	c
be	c
a	c
member	c
of	c
the	c
campfire	i
.	c

Some	c
of	c
the	i
them	c
I	c
really	i
interested	c
in	c
it	i
,	c
especially	c
painting	c
.	c

Since	c
I	c
was	c
young	c
,	c
my	c
dad	c
he	i
alway	i
took	i
me	c
out	i
to	i
have	i
live	i
drawings	i
,	c
so	c
now	c
it	c
became	i
my	i
hobbies	c
.	c

And	c
I	c
think	c
,	i
it	c
is	i
nice	c
to	c
draw	c
the	i
beautiful	c
landscapes	c
of	c
the	c
place	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
was	c
in	c
highschool	i
,	c
I	c
have	i
joined	i
in	i
the	c
swimming	c
club	c
.	c

It	c
would	i
help	i
you	c
up	i
to	c
the	i
date	c
.	c

Then	c
I	c
can	c
say	c
I	i
'm	i
definatly	i
does	i
n't	i
feel	c
any	i
enjoyable	c
.	c

Especially	c
,	i
queue	i
up	c
for	c
twenty	c
minutes	c
for	i
just	c

Dear	c
Madam/Sir	c
,	c

Recently	c
I	c
am	i
interested	c
in	c
musical	c
shows	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
seen	c
it	i
in	c
my	c
country	c
.	c

As	c
I	c
arrived	c
there	c
after	c
5	c
P.M.	c
,	c
I	c
missed	c
the	c
first	c
performance	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
19:30	c
p.m	c
performance	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
there	c
were	c
no	c
student	c
discounts	c
!	c

So	c
I	c
am	c
asking	c
for	c
some	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

I	i
would	i
like	i
to	i
see	i
the	i
change	i
in	i
an	i
advantage	i
and	i
a	i
disadvantage	i
view	i
,	i
In	i
an	c
advantage	c

Dear	c
Ms.	c
Helen	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
I	c
'll	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
travel	c
on	i
July	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
we	i
ca	c
n't	c
go	c
shopping	c
without	c
money	c
.	c

Nowadays	c
,	c
most	c
product	i
's	i
prices	c
has	i
gone	c
up	c
with	c
our	c
own	c
country	c
's	c
economy	i
development	c
.	c

Of	c
couse	i
,	c
the	c
shopkeepers	c
are	c
human	c
being	i
as	c
well	c
.	c

So	c
their	c
attitude	c
sometimes	c
seems	c
to	c
be	c
bossy	c
and	c
pushy	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
necessary	c
to	c
buy	c
something	c
to	c
alive	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
your	c
advertisement	c
concerning	c
the	c
Musical	c
show	c
:	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
"	c
.	c

Your	c
advertisement	c
also	c
failed	c
to	c
mention	c
the	c
fact	c
that	c
there	c
was	i
no	c
discounts	c
what	i
so	i
ever	i
and	c
finally	i
,	c
because	c
of	c
a	c
shortage	c
of	c
staf	i
,	c
your	c
restaurant	c
was	c
not	c
available	i
for	i
us	i
.	c

I	c
feel	c
entitled	c
to	c
compensation	c
for	c
this	c
event	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

Maybe	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
so	c
bad	c
after	c
all	c
?	c

Finally	c
I	c
smiled	c
.	c

There	c
are	c
several	c
reasons	c
that	c
I	c
was	c
not	c
happy	c
about	c
the	c
musical	c
.	c

The	c
first	c
one	c
I	c
am	c
going	c
to	c
complaint	i
about	c
is	c
the	c
actor	c
.	c

I	c
ask	c
you	c
to	c
transfor	i
money	c
into	c
this	c
account	c
.	c

I	c
even	i
could	i
n't	i
imagine	c
our	c
p.c	c
can	i
be	c
that	c
fast	c
.	c

Dear	c
the	i
manage	i
of	c
theatre	i
,	c

I	c
really	c
expected	i
the	c
musical	c
show	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
disappointing	c
show	c
.	c

And	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
visit	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
closed	i
though	i
they	c
said	c
it	c
was	c
possible	c
to	c
visit	c
theatre	i
restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
they	c
did	c
n't	c
prepare	c
at	i
all	c
.	c

But	c
she	c
was	c
annoyed	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
n't	c
be	c
satisfied	c
your	i
theatre	c
.	c

Because	i
she	c
believed	i
him	c
.	c

And	c
when	c
his	c
friend	c
,	c
J	c
,	c
got	i
big	i
problem	c
,	c
J	c
asked	c
Pat	c
and	c
his	c
friend	c
for	c
help	c
him	i
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
it	c
had	c
read	i
on	i
the	c
advertisement	c
that	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
was	c
starring	c
at	i
this	c
show	c
.	c

The	c
other	c
actor	c
was	c
very	c
disappointing	c
.	c

Faithfully	c
yours	c
,	c

My	c
day	c
,	c
for	c
example	c
,	c
begins	c
with	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
noise	c
.	c

After	c
breakfeast	i
I	c
have	c
to	c
use	c
my	c
car	c
to	c
get	c
to	c
school	c
.	c

At	c
school	c
the	c
computer	c
has	c
become	c
an	c
important	c
new	c
tool	c
.	c

BESIDES	c
THIS	c
,	c
I	c
COULD	c
NOT	c
VISIT	i
THE	c
RESTAURANT	c
IN	c
THE	c
THEATRE	c
BECAUSE	c
IT	c
WAS	c
CLOSED	c
.	c

SO	c
,	c
I	c
HAD	c
TO	c
PAY	c
A	c
LOT	c
OF	c
MONEY	c
TO	c
SEE	c
A	c
PLAY	c
THAT	c
WAS	c
A	c
COMPLETELY	i
DISASTER	c
.	c

I	c
THINK	c
THAT	c
IT	c
WAS	c
THE	c
WORST	c
I	c
HAVE	c
EVER	c
HAD	c
.	c

ON	i
THE	i
WHOLE	i
,	c
I	c
WOULD	c
LIKE	c
TO	c
HAVE	c
MY	c
MONEY	c
BACK	c
.	c

JUST	c
BE	c
YOURSELF	c

I	c
would	c
rather	i
prefer	c
sleeping	c
in	c
log	i
cabins	i
if	c
its	i
possible	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
back	c
problems	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
not	c
allowed	c
to	c
sleep	c
on	c
the	c
ground	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
rather	c
good	c
at	c
these	c
sports	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
practised	i
them	c
since	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
little	c
girl	c
.	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
:	c

I	c
had	c
to	c
learn	c
what	c
part	c
of	c
the	c
stage	c
had	c
to	c
be	c
lightened	i
with	c
a	c
blue	c
light	c
or	i
a	c
green	c
one	c
.	c

Even	c
though	c
I	c
ended	c
terribly	i
tired	c
I	c
really	c
enjoyed	c
myself	c
.	c

I	c
can	c
assure	c
you	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
a	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
and	c
I	c
got	c
very	c
annoyed	c
about	c
this	c
evening	c
which	c
could	c
have	c
been	c
wonderful	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
would	i
take	c
notice	c
of	c
this	c
complaint	c
seriously	i
.	c

For	c
August	c
I	c
booked	c
a	c
journey	i
to	c
Greece	c
with	c
my	c
wife	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
not	c
quite	i
a	c
young	c
man	c
and	c
during	c
the	c
past	i
years	c
of	c
my	c
life	c
I	c
gothave	i
become	i
accostomed	i
to	c
some	i
more	i
comfort	c
.	c

The	c
video	c
that	c
will	c
be	c
made	c
should	c
demonstrate	c
how	i
day	i
in	c
school	c
is	c
like	c
.	c

-	c
The	c
first	c
lesson	c
will	c
deal	c
with	c
animals	c
on	c
a	c
farm	c
.	c

-	c
Later	c
on	c
we	c
'll	c
go	i
to	i
sing	i
the	c
song	c
of	i
"	c
Old	c
McDonald	c
had	c
a	c
farm	c
"	c
.	c

-	c
Some	c
sequences	c
of	i
the	c
gym-lesson	i
should	c
conclude	c
the	c
part	c
of	c
the	c
film	c
showing	c
the	c
children	c
at	c
work	c
,	c
but	c
there	c
should	c
follow	c
another	c
short	c
part	c
that	c
presents	i
how	c
children	i
have	c
their	c
lunch	c
and	c
spend	c
their	c
free-time	i
,	c
what	c
games	c
they	c
play	c
in	c
the	c
school-yard	i
and	c
how	c
they	c
have	i
contact	i
with	c
each	c
other	c
.	c

Another	c
complain	i
is	c
about	c
the	c
time	c
that	c
the	c
musical	i
show	c
started	c
,	i
the	i
advertisement	c
said	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
19:30	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
did	c
not	c
,	i
we	i
had	c
to	c
wait	c
45	c
minutes	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
when	c
the	c
musical	i
show	c
finished	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
say	c
,	c
a	c
bit	c
late	c
,	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
's	c
restaurant	c
to	c
eat	c
something	c
but	c
this	c
place	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
the	c
chef	c
had	c
already	c
gone	c
.	c

At	i
is	i
explain	i
it	i
was	c
not	c
the	c
perfect	c
evening	c
that	c
I	c
expected	c
to	c
have	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
have	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
because	i
of	i
the	c
reasons	c
that	c
I	c
mentioned	c
before	i
.	c

Maria	c
was	c
speechless	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
the	c
first	c
time	c
that	c
she	c
did	c
n't	c
know	c
what	c
to	c
do	c
,	c
so	c
she	c
decided	c
to	c
stop	c
talking	c
to	c
Pat	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
this	c
letter	c
as	c
an	c
answer	c
to	c
your	c
request	c
for	c
some	c
further	c
information	c
from	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
also	c
very	c
keen	c
on	c
climbing	c
,	c
although	c
I	c
am	c
not	c
extremely	c
good	c
at	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
also	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
am	c
supposed	c
to	c
take	c
with	c
me	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
be	c
glad	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
give	c
me	c
an	c
answer	c
before	c
the	c
camp	c
begins	c
.	c

Eventually	c
,	c
after	c
long	c
seeking	i
you	c
find	c
a	c
skirt	c
you	c
like	c
.	c

And	c
suddenly	c
you	c
notice	c
the	c
identical	c
but	c
cheaper	c
one	c
in	c
the	c
next	c
shop	c
.	c

About	c
the	c
acommodation	i
,	c
out	i
of	i
the	c
two	c
possibilities	i
,	c
I	c
choose	c
sleeping	i
in	c
a	c
tent	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
is	c
n't	c
as	c
authentic	c
as	c
a	c
tent	c
,	c
at	c
the	c
camp	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Gil	c
Sanchez	c

It	c
's	c
the	c
best	c
thing	c
you	c
can	c
do	c
in	i
this	i
case	i
.	c

Gil	c
Sanchez	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
you	c
asked	c
when	c
would	i
I	i
be	c
able	c
to	c
travel	c
.	c

Providing	c
that	c
you	c
give	c
me	c
the	c
chance	c
to	c
chose	c
two	c
activities	c
I	i
would	c
love	c
to	c
do	c
swimming	c
and	c
singing	c
.	c

I	c
attend	c
to	i
swimming	c
and	c
singing	c
classes	c
twice	c
a	c
week	c
so	c
I	c
'm	c
really	c
good	c
at	c
both	c
.	c

Nowadays	c
shopping	c
is	c
considered	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
most	c
usual	c
and	c
enjoyable	c
activities	c
,	c
especially	c
if	c
you	c
are	c
a	c
woman	c
and	c
you	c
are	c
out	c
to	c
buy	c
clothes	c
.	c

At	c
first	c
sight	c
it	c
is	c
,	c
but	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

There	c
are	c
some	c
points	c
that	c
give	i
me	i
the	i
reason	i
.	c

In	i
one	i
hand	i
,	c
there	c
's	c
you	c
.	c

Yesterday	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
"	c
The	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
"	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
"	c
OVER	c
THE	c
RAINBOW	c
"	c
.	c

There	c
was	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
and	c
he	c
was	c
really	c
bad	c
.	c

You	c
should	c
have	c
informed	c
us	c
before	c
that	c
you	i
've	i
changed	c
the	c
actor	c
.	c

I	c
told	c
her	c
that	c
my	c
parents	c
are	c
getting	c
divorsed	i
and	c
that	c
I	c
will	c
move	c
to	c
Chicago	c
with	c
my	c
mother	c
.	c

I	c
thought	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
good	c
idea	c
and	c
we	c
went	c
home	c
.	c

We	c
are	c
sorry	c
for	c
any	c
inconvenience	c
caused	c
by	c
our	c
request	c
.	c

I	c
personally	c
think	c
the	c
best	c
would	i
be	c
to	c
put	c
the	c
celebrities	c
in	c
cages	c
and	c
let	c
people	c
touch	c
them	c
,	c
point	c
and	c
ask	c
for	c
authopraps	i
.	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
I	c
believe	c
that	c
everyone	c
has	c
the	c
right	c
to	c
keep	i
privacy	i
of	c
their	c
own	c
homes	c
and	c
even	c
someone	c
extremely	c
famous	c
deserve	i
to	c
have	c
a	c
private	c
life	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

Anyway	c
now	i
I	c
am	c
going	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
everything	c
about	c
it	c
.	c

Dear	c
Ms	c
Helen	c

About	c
my	c
accommodation	c
prefers	i
,	c
I	c
would	c
really	c
like	c
to	c
be	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
.	c

Everytime	i
I	c
travel	c
around	c
,	c
I	c
sleep	c
in	c
nice	c
rooms	c
with	c
nice	c
beds	c
;	c
that	c
is	c
why	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
good	c
option	i
to	c
sleep	c
in	c
sleep-bags	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
some	c
questions	c
:	c
Could	c
you	c
tell	c
me	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
would	c
be	c
addecuate	i
for	c
these	c
two	c
weeks	c
?	c

How	c
much	c
money	c
do	c
you	c
think	c
I	c
should	c
bring	c
with	c
me	c
?	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

As	c
I	c
told	c
you	c
in	c
my	c
last	c
letter	c
,	c
I	c
worked	c
two	c
weeks	c
ago	c
in	c
Edinburgh	c
helping	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
.	c

Even	i
I	i
played	c
the	c
drums	c
there	c
!	c

My	c
name	c
is	c
.	c

During	c
our	c
stay	c
we	c
saw	c
a	c
bright	i
advertisement	c
of	i
your	c
theatre	c
and	c
decided	c
to	c
see	c
this	c
newest	i
and	c
best	c
musical	c
show	c
(	c
as	c
it	c
was	i
said	i
in	c
you	i
advertisement	c
)	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
bought	c
tickets	c
,	c
they	c
did	i
not	i
discount	i
at	c
all	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
that	i
they	c
discount	i
for	i
somebody	c
else	c
or	c
not	c
.	c

The	c
restaurant	c
should	c
open	i
until	c
the	c
show	c
finish	i

It	c
was	c
£	c
60	c
for	c
tickets	i

Smith	c
.	c

She	c
is	c
one	c
of	c
my	c
friend	i
at	c
school	c
.	c

She	c
is	i
not	i
keeping	i
secrets	c
.	c

We	c
so	i
worry	i
about	c
her	c
in	i
the	i
future	c
.	c

I	c
was	i
saving	i
my	c
pocket	c
money	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
age	i
15	i
.	c

I	c
had	c
seen	c
her	c
every	c
morning	c
while	i
I	c
was	c
going	c
to	c
school	c
.	c

The	c
more	c
seeing	i
her	i
I	i
could	i
,	c
the	c
more	c
ambitious	i
I	c
became	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
never	c
ever	c
go	c
to	c
school	c
again	c
.	c

Now	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
theatre	c
actress	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
my	c
dream	c
I	i
wish	c
my	c
dady	i

I	c
am	c
shocked	c
that	c
I	c
won	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
this	c
competition	c
.	c

Here	c
it	c
comes	c
...	c

It	c
was	c
really	c
big	c
and	c
impressive	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
hard	c
and	c
complicated	c
job	c
but	c
we	c
all	c
had	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
satisfaction	c
during	c
the	c
concert	c
.	c

Even	c
Mr.	c
Sting	c
came	c
to	c
us	c
to	c
thank	c
for	i
our	c
help	c
.	c

Send	c
me	c
your	c
opinion	c
about	c
that	c
.	c

Dear	c
Ms	c
Clark	c
,	c

Dancers	i
worn	i
nice	c
clothes	c
,	c
the	i
music	c
was	c
very	c
good	c
.	c

I	c
prefere	i
them	c
to	c
others	c
.	c

During	c
the	c
jazz	c
and	c
rock	c
concerts	c
the	c
audience	c
wants	c
to	c
play	c
and	c
dance	c
so	c
it	i
needs	i
more	c
room	c
.	c

He	c
was	c
happy	c
because	c
he	c
was	c
able	c
to	c
talk	c
to	c
them	c
in	c
person	c
.	c

We	c
chose	c
some	c
of	c
them	c
and	c
we	c
were	c
glad	c
that	c
we	c
had	c
our	c
reasonably	c
ticket	i
for	c
all	c
evants	i
because	c
we	c
could	c
change	c
our	c
planes	i
during	c
the	c
evant	i
.	c

I	c
suggest	c
to	i
organize	i
next	i
IAF	c
in	c
the	c
summer	c
.	c

We	i
're	i
going	i
to	i
attend	c
IAF	i
any	c
time	c
,	c
as	c
well	c
.	c

I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
write	c
about	c
rules	c
in	c
Poland	c
.	c

There	c
are	c
many	c
things	c
we	c
are	c
n't	c
allowed	c
to	c
do	c
at	c
school	c
.	c

We	c
can	c
wear	c
what	c
we	c
want	c
.	c

Most	c
of	i
studenst	i
wear	c
jeans	c
and	c
sweaters	i
.	c

We	c
have	c
to	c
be	c
quiet	c
during	c
the	i
lessons	c
and	c
our	c
lessons	c
are	c
boring	c
because	c
of	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
leave	c
my	c
books	c
at	c
school	c
.	c

Love	c

I	c
hope	c
it	i
's	i
may	i
help	c
for	i
next	c
year	c
's	c
festival	c
.	c

Like	c
the	c
hall	c
of	c
classical	i
concert	c
was	c
too	c
small	c
and	c
crowded	c
.	c

Next	c
year	c
,	c
you	c
should	c
calulate	i
or	c
examine	i
how	c
many	c
people	c
come	i
before	c
you	c
choose	c
a	c
hall	c
,	c
which	c
I	c
feel	c
very	c
good	c
was	c
plays	c
and	c
films	c
.	c

Because	c
the	i
price	i
was	i
cheaper	i
than	i
buy	i
it	i
sperate	i
and	i
more	i
convience	i
.	c

Because	c
she	c
saw	c
a	c
golden	c
fish	c
was	i
smiling	c
at	c
her	c
and	c
talking	c
to	c
her	c
.	c

After	c
a	c
few	c
day	i
they	c
got	c
married	c
.	c

This	c
story	c
happened	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
ago	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
some	c
concerts	c
took	c
a	i
place	c
in	c
really	c
small	c
halls	c
.	c

Therefore	i
,	c
there	c
will	i
be	c
more	c
people	c
coming	c
the	i
concerts	c
.	c

How	c
are	c
you	c
doing	c
?	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
go	c
out	c
wheneve	i
I	c
want	c
,	c
even	c
in	i
the	i
mid-night	i
.	c

I	c
actually	c
love	c
this	c
rule	c
because	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
to	c
get	c
up	c
early	c
if	c
I	c
have	c
a	c
car	c
.	c

Secoundly	i
,	c
boys	c
are	c
not	c
allowed	c
to	c
have	c
long	c
hire	i
.	c

Best	c
wishes	c
.	c

Dear	c
Ms.	c
Ryan	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
time	i
and	c
attention	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

There	c
seems	c
to	c
be	c
a	c
general	c
opinion	c
that	c
sports	c
,	c
art	c
and	c
music	c
activities	c
such	c
as	c
tennis	c
,	c
football	c
,	c
orchestra	c
,	c
painting	c
,	c
photography	i
should	c
be	c
included	c
.	c

As	c
well	c
as	c
that	c
,	c
if	c
we	c
filmed	c
famous	c
students	c
and	c
teachers	c
in	c
our	c
school	c
,	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
fantastic	c
video	c
.	c

Dear	c
Jane	c
Clark	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
give	c
my	c
opinions	c
about	c
the	c
annual	c
International	c
Arts	c
Festival	c
I	c
have	c
visited	i
.	c

It	c
gives	c
an	c
opportunity	c
to	c
get	c
acquainted	c
with	c
the	c
cultures	i
'	i
variety	c
of	c
the	c
whole	c
world	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
at	c
this	c
festival	c
there	c
were	c
artists	c
only	i
from	i
six	c
countries	c
.	c

Despite	c
that	c
,	c
all	c
the	c
jazz	c
,	c
rock	c
and	c
classical	c
concerts	c
were	c
extremely	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

Another	c
disadvatage	i
of	c
the	c
festival	c
's	c
programme	c
was	c
lack	i
of	c
plays	c
and	c
films	c
which	c
are	c
the	c
best	c
to	i
display	c
the	i
modern	c
county	i
's	i
culture	c
.	i

That	c
was	c
an	c
excellent	c
decision	c
as	c
all	c
the	c
events	c
started	c
at	c
different	c
time	i
and	c
there	c
was	i
plenty	c
of	c
them	c
.	c

This	c
job	c
does	c
n't	c
demand	c
much	c
abilities	i
,	c
but	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
patience	c
though	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
to	c
baby-sitting	c
you	i
may	c
also	c
give	c
some	c
lessons	c
to	c
small	c
children	c
such	c
as	c
(	c
tl	c
)	c
teaching	c
them	c
to	c
read	c
or	c
write	c
or	c
just	c
basic	c
rules	c
and	c
words	c
of	c
a	c
foreign	c
language	c
,	c
Eglish	i
for	i
example	c
.	c

This	c
job	c
requires	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
energy	c
however	i
.	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
there	c
is	c
no	c
problem	c
without	c
a	c
solution	c
and	c
if	c
you	c
are	c
an	c
active	c
and	c
broad-minded	c
person	c
,	c
you	c
will	c
surely	c
find	c
a	c
way	c
to	c
earn	c
money	c
even	c
in	c
Arctic	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
happy	c
to	c
have	c
won	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
interested	c
in	c
going	i
to	i
two	c
weeks	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
in	c
the	c
USA	c
.	c

Best	c
regards	c

Henri	c

Men	c
do	c
not	c
like	c
shopping	c
,	c
because	c
their	c
women	c
buy	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
clothes	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
very	c
expensive	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
men	c
prefer	c
to	c
do	c
sports	c
,	c
because	c
the	i
shopping	c
loses	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
time	c
controry	i
to	i
women	i
,	c
because	c
if	c
they	c
have	c
a	i
free	c
time	c
,	c
they	c
will	c
go	c
to	i
do	i
shopping	c
.	c

Also	c
,	c
for	c
all	c
these	c
attractions	c
,	c
the	c
price	c
was	c
low	c
and	c
it	i
is	c
important	c
for	c
the	i
big	c
family	c
.	c

Your	i
sincerely	c

I	c
know	c
that	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
ask	c
at	i
my	c
Mum	c
or	c
Dad	c
for	i
going	c
by	i
my	c
friend	c
after	c
the	i
lessons	i
.	c

See	c
you	c
soon	c
,	c
bye	c

I	c
was	c
on	c
week	i
's	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
and	c
I	c
went	c
there	i
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
to	c
see	c
"	c
Over	c
The	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
.	c

I	c
must	c
say	c
that	c
your	c
musical	c
show	c
was	c
very	c
disappointing	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
I	i
expected	c
to	c
see	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
saw	c
different	i
actor	c
and	c
that	c
was	c
big	i
disappointment	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

Out	i
the	c
end	c
your	i
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
from	i
unknown	c
reasons	c
,	c
but	c
on	i
an	i
advertisement	c
was	i
clearly	c
sign	i
:	c

I	c
will	c
be	c
very	c
pleased	c
if	c
so	i
.	c

Yours	c
faithfuly	i

On	i
the	i
end	i
we	i
must	c
mention	c
modern	c
medicine	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
why	c
the	i
show	c
began	i
at	c
20:15	c
,	c
not	c
at	c
19:30	c
as	c
indicated	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
.	c

I	c
came	c
to	c
that	c
show	c
only	c
for	i
see	i
him	c
and	c
when	c
the	c
actor	c
appear	i
,	c
it	c
was	c
another	c
one	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
totaly	i
unsatisfied	c
with	c
the	c
theatre	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
have	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
if	c
it	i
's	i
possible	c
.	c

In	c
each	c
country	c
,	c
each	c
people	c
wear	i
differents	i
kinds	c
of	c
clothes	c
,	c
like	i
,	c
people	c
in	c
Brazil	c
wear	c
shorts	c
,	c
T-shirts	c
or	c
only	i
without	c
them	c
,	i
in	c
Saudi	c
Arabian	c
they	c
wear	c
strange	c
clothes	c
,	c
if	c
you	c
analyse	c
the	i
point	c
of	c
view	c
who	i
does	c
n't	c
live	c
in	c
Saudi	c
Arabia	c
.	c

And	c
so	c
I	c
can	c
I	i
be	c
better	i
in	i
touch	i
with	i
the	i
nature	c
.	c

Photography	c
is	c
a	c
relaxing	c
activity	c
.	c

They	c
go	c
out	c
with	c
friends	c
or	c
alone	c
.	c

She	c
phone	i
me	c
and	c
asked	c
me	c
what	i
about	c
going	c
shopping	c
.	c

In	i
the	i
time	i
we	c
want	i
to	c
go	c
out	c
of	c
a	c
shop	c
a	c
man	c
stopped	c
us	c
and	c
hold	i
a	c
pistol	c
in	c
his	c
hand	c
.	c

We	c
were	c
scared	c
and	c
so	c
we	c
did	c
all	i
what	i
he	c
told	c
us	c
.	i

But	c
you	c
can	c
be	c
carefull	i
when	c
you	c
speak	c
with	c
him	i
or	c
her	i
that	i
will	i
stolen	i
your	c
thinks	i
.	c

My	c
best	c
friend	c
is	c
crazy	c
about	c
shopping	c
.	c

Not	c
so	c
many	c
people	c
thinking	i
about	c
going	c
fishing	c
or	c
playing	c
sport	i
games	c
with	c
their	c
families	c
any	c
more	c
.	c

People	c
are	i
not	i
smiling	i
to	i
each	c
other	c
,	c
not	i
talking	i
to	c
each	c
other	c
at	c
the	c
shops	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
shopping	c
is	c
just	c
to	i
cover	c
our	c
basic	c
needs	c
.	c

Dear	c
Ms	c
Ryan	c

Swimming	i
I	i
'm	i
teach	i
people	i
in	c
Army	i
.	c

Yours	c
Sincerely	c

In	c
the	c
video	c
I	c
think	c
we	c
should	c
take	c
part	i
to	c
talk	c
about	c
,	i
what	c
we	c
doing	i
in	c
feel	i
time	c
and	c
study	c
period	i
.	c

This	c
is	c
another	c
important	c
part	c
of	c
our	c
school	c
life	c
,	c
and	c
we	c
should	c
make	i
a	c
section	c
to	i
talk	i
about	c
lunch	c
and	c
where	i
are	i
the	i
people	i
go	i
to	i
eat	i
their	i
lunch	i
or	i
what	i
they	i
do	i
?	i

Dear	c
Jane	c
Clark	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
about	c
the	c
festival	c
in	i
this	c
time	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
suggest	c
you	i
three	c
things	c
for	c
next	i
festival	c
.	c

Firstly	c
.	c

I	c
supposed	i
to	c
see	c
quite	i
various	i
nationality	i
.	c

However	c
,	c
some	c
concert	c
halls	c
were	c
too	c
small	c
for	c
the	c
many	i
people	c
so	c
we	c
could	c
n't	c
have	c
a	c
enough	c
space	c
.	c

Otherwise	c
,	c
the	c
price	c
was	c
really	c
reasonable	c
for	c
all	c
:events	i
the	i
weekend	i
.	c

I	c
was	c
satisfied	c
with	c
that	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

How	c
are	c
you	c
doing	c
?	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
're	c
well	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
student	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
n't	c
allowed	c
to	c
wear	c
any	c
fashionable	c
clothes	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
not	c
allowed	c
to	c
sleep	c
at	c
my	c
friend	c
's	c
house	c
.	c

It	c
would	c
be	c
nice	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
chance	c
to	c
try	c
new	i
sport	c
when	c
we	c
are	c
relaxed	c
.	c

I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
try	c
golf	c
because	c
I	c
'm	c
not	c
good	c
at	c
any	c
other	c
sports	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
.	c

How	c
are	c
you	c
?	c

But	c
as	c
you	c
know	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
so	c
busy	c
that	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
write	c
earlier	c
.	c

We	c
delivered	c
so	c
many	c
fantastic	c
and	c
gorgeous	c
costumes	c
which	c
had	c
been	c
designed	c
exclusively	c
by	c
top	c
designers	c
.	c

We	c
also	c
helped	c
to	c
make	c
posters	c
and	c
leaflets	c
,	c
which	c
I	c
enjoyed	c
most	c
as	c
I	c
always	c
like	c
drawing	c
and	c
designing	c
.	c

Of	c
course	c
,	c
I	c
've	c
enjoyed	c
being	c
around	c
famous	c
singers	c
,	c
too	c
.	c

Love	c

It	c
was	c
really	i
a	i
good	c
idea	c
to	c
organize	c
a	c
festival	c
containing	c
such	c
different	c
shows	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
to	c
this	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
wondering	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
organize	c
the	c
same	c
festival	c
in	c
sommer	i
.	c

Anyway	c
,	c
Alex	c
was	c
too	c
stubborn	c
to	c
give	c
up	c
and	c
it	c
was	c
like	c
talking	c
to	c
a	c
brick	c
wall	c
:	c
she	c
did	c
n't	c
listen	c
to	c
her	c
sister	c
.	c

After	c
forty	c
minutes	c
,	c
the	c
weather	c
became	c
very	c
bad	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
such	c
a	c
pain	c
to	c
walk	c
in	c
the	c
snow	c
.	c

The	c
answer	c
was	c
obvious	c
and	c
the	c
angel	c
saved	c

This	c
story	c
happend	i
a	c
long	c
time	c
ago	c
.	c

For	i
the	c
time	c
that	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
must	i
be	c
on	i
July	c
only	c
.	c

Please	c
,	c
give	c
me	c
a	i
suggestion	i
about	c
these	c
.	i

I	c
have	c
written	c
to	c
you	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
about	c
the	c
greatest	c
experience	c
that	c
I	c
ever	i
have	i
.	c

Last	c
week	c
I	c
offered	c
myself	i
to	c
help	c
the	c
others	c
at	c
the	c
concert	c
and	c
it	c
was	c
amazing	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
n't	c
believed	i
how	c
close	c
I	c
was	c
to	c
the	c
band	c
.	c

You	c
will	c
not	c
believe	c
how	c
close	c
I	c
was	c
to	c
the	c
singers	c
.	c

The	i
time	i
has	i
come	i
,	i
when	i
the	c
band	c
finished	c
the	c
concert	c
,	c
we	c
have	i
to	c
served	i
them	c
drinks	c
again	c
and	c
helped	i
to	c
clear	i
up	i
the	c
stage	c
.	c

Afterwards	c
,	c
I	c
have	i
a	c
chance	c
to	c
took	i
photos	i
with	c
them	c
and	c
have	i
their	c
autographs	c
etc	c
.	c

From	i
this	c
letter	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
sure	c
that	c
you	c
should	i
be	c
able	c
to	c
share	c
this	c
experience	c
with	c
me	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr.	c
Brown	c
,	c

I	c
was	c
quite	c
bored	c
,	c
sitting	c
in	c
my	c
chair	c
and	c
waiting	c
for	c
the	c
beginning	c
of	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

My	c
husband	c
was	c
also	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
seeing	c
Mr.	c
Brook	c
as	c
an	c
actor	c
of	i
your	c
musical	c
because	c
he	c
is	c
one	c
of	c
his	c
greatest	c
fans	c
.	c

He	c
was	c
Sally	c
's	c
lover	c
!	c

When	c
I	c
visited	c
the	c
festival	c
,	c
of	c
course	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
really	c
good	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
enjoy	c
different	c
culture	i
and	c
also	c
I	c
could	c
expand	c
my	c
knowledge	c
.	c

But	c
there	c
were	c
only	c
six	c
countries	c
'	c
candidates	c
.	c

Jazz	c
and	c
classical	c
concerts	i
'	i
halls	c
were	c
especially	c
small	c
.	c

Plays	c
and	c
films	c
qualities	i
were	c
good	c
,	c
but	i
quantities	i
were	i
bad	i
.	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
your	c
answer	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

I	c
could	c
make	c
a	c
bit	c
of	c
money	c
,	c
of	c
course	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
far	c
much	i
than	c
pocket	c
money	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
have	c
n't	c
purpose	i
,	c
you	c
would	i
waste	c
money	c
easily	c
and	c
quickly	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
the	c
weekend	c
ticket	c
was	c
reasonably-priced	c
and	c
this	c
was	c
excellent	i
decision	c
because	c
it	c
gave	c
the	c
opportunity	c
to	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
people	c
,	c
adults	c
but	c
also	c
students	c
,	c
to	c
take	c
part	c
to	i
the	c
Festival	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

I	c
can	c
go	c
out	c
and	c
stay	c
out	c
late	c
,	c
I	c
've	c
got	c
my	c
car	c
and	c
my	c
mobile	c
,	c
so	c
that	c
they	c
can	c
call	c
me	c
whenever	c
they	c
need	c
to	c
hear	i
me	c
;	c
but	c
above	c
all	c
I	c
know	c
they	c
trust	c
me	c
and	c
consider	c
my	i
an	c
adult	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Ryan	c

Many	c
thanks	c
for	c
your	c

At	c
first	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
clean	c
the	c
three	c
private	c
rooms	c
of	c
the	c
stars	c

These	c
two	c
people	c

O.K.	c
I	c
am	c
just	c
kiding	i

But	c
after	c
this	c
serville	i
work	c
I	c
met	c
Eminem	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
just	c
read	c
your	c
letter	c
and	c
it	i
would	c
be	c
grateful	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
give	c
me	c
more	c
information	c
about	c
the	c
two	c
weeks	c
at	c
camp	c
California	c
in	c
the	c
USA	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
appreciate	c
if	i
I	c
could	c
travel	c
on	i
July	c
because	c
my	c
school	c
gives	c
me	c
two	c
winter	i
holiday	i
's	i
week	i
.	c

As	c
I	c
said	c
before	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
playing	c
tennis	c
for	c
four	c
years	c
.	c

I	c
consider	c
myself	c
to	c
be	c
good	c
at	c
this	c
sport	c
.	c

It	c
would	c
be	c
very	c
kind	c
of	c
you	c
to	c
let	c
me	c
know	c
about	c
the	c
clothes	c
you	c
think	c
it	c
would	i
be	c
necessary	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
take	c
and	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
will	c
need	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Do	c
n't	c
worry	c
because	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
pay	c
your	i
ticket	c
it	i
is	c
"	c
free	c
"	c
.	c

From	c
my	c
point	c
of	c
view	c
,	c
there	c
were	c
not	i
disadvantages	c

Adriana	c

I	c
am	i
glad	c
to	c
hear	c
from	c
you	c
recently	c
and	c
I	c
really	c
appreciate	c
your	c
invitation	c
to	c
California	c
.	c

To	c
start	c
with	c
I	i
would	c
rather	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
because	c
two	c
weeks	c
might	c
be	c
too	c
long	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
and	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
would	c
be	c
more	c
convenient	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
started	c
surfing	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
12	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
am	c
quite	c
confident	c
with	i
this	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
in	c
our	c
opinion	c
,	c
this	c
travel	i
is	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
very	c
interesting	c
for	c
us	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
attention	c

The	c
media	i
's	i
are	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
create	i
great	c
expectations	c
about	c
famous	c
people	c

But	c
we	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
suggest	c
you	c
to	i
move	i
our	c
visit	c
to	c
the	c
Science	c
Museum	c
to	c
Wednesday	c
afternoon	c
,	i
so	c
that	c
,	i
we	c
can	c
go	c

on	i

which	i
lasts	i
from	i

Nowadays	c
,	c
in	c
our	c
society	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
some	c
people	c
who	c
,	c
because	c
of	c
their	c
work	c
or	c
because	c
of	c
their	c
success	c
in	c
life	c
,	c
has	i
become	c
popular	c
,	c
and	c
by	c
now	c
is	i

Politicians	c

film	c
starts	i

since	i

Dear	c
Ms	c

The	c
last	c
thing	c
is	c
about	c
the	c
ticket	c
.	c

I	c
really	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
going	c
to	c
the	c
festival	c
next	c
year	c

Yours	c

Dear	c
Jacob	c
:	c

Anyway	c
,	c
in	c
my	c
country	c
,	c
generally	c
,	c
children	c
are	c
free	c
at	c
home	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
also	c
depends	c
on	c
their	c
parents	c
.	c

OK	i
,	i
just	i
here	i
.	c

When	c
the	c
holidays	c
began	i
everybody	c
is	c
happy	c
because	c
it	c
represents	c
the	c
beginning	c
of	c
a	c
time	c
full	c
of	c
fun	c
and	c
lots	c
of	c
interesting	c
things	c
to	c
do	c
,	c
but	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
do	c
these	c
things	c
we	c
all	c
need	c
money	c
and	c
that	c
is	c
a	c
big	c
problem	c
to	i
most	c
of	c
us	c
.	c

there	i
are	c
several	c
ways	c
to	c
earn	c
a	c
bit	c
of	c
money	c
in	c
your	c
spare	c
time	c
.	c

If	c
looking	c
after	c
children	c
does	c
n't	c
fit	i
you	c
,	c
you	c
can	c
try	c
with	i
pets	c
.	c

In	c
this	c
case	c
you	c
need	c
to	c
buy	c
the	c
materials	c
you	c
will	c
work	c
with	c
,	c
but	c
do	c
n't	c
worry	c
,	c
soap	c
is	c
not	c
very	c
expensive	c
.	c

the	i
most	c
important	c
thing	c
is	c
that	c
you	c
wisely	i
choose	i
the	i
most	i
suitable	i
work	i
for	i
you	i
,	c
according	c
to	c
the	c
things	c
you	c
like	c
to	c
do	c
.	c

As	c
I	c
was	c
requested	c
I	c
should	c
choose	c
two	c
activities	c
from	c
the	c
list	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
choose	c
climbing	c
and	c
photography	c
.	c

These	c
two	c
are	c
easy	c
to	c
connect	c
,	c
I	c
could	c
climb	c
and	c
make	c
pictures	c
at	c
the	c
same	c
time	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
about	c
clothes	c
.	c

There	c
is	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
situations	c
which	c
could	c
make	c
you	c
feel	c
similar	c
while	c
you	c
do	c
shopping	c
.	c

Sometimes	c
you	c
could	c
find	c
a	c
bargain	c
.	c

And	c
you	c
could	c
n't	c
of	c
course	c
give	i
it	c
back	c
because	c
the	c
price	c
was	c
lowered	c
and	c
your	c
dress	c
is	c
not	c
under	c
guarantee	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
chosen	c
between	i
the	c
activities	c
proposed	i
to	c
do	c
photography	c
,	i
I	c
have	c
already	c
been	c
part	i
of	c
a	c
photography	c
club	c
so	c
I	c
am	c
experienced	c
.	c

I	c
prepared	i
sandwiches	c
for	c
all	c
the	c
staff	c
during	i
the	i
major	c
part	c
of	c
the	c
afternoon	c
and	c
then	c
I	c
sold	c
tickets	c
to	c
the	c
viewers	i
all	c
the	i
evening	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
tired	c
but	c
when	c
the	c
concert	c
began	c
I	c
felt	c
excited	c
because	c
there	c
were	c
so	c
many	c
people	c
dancing	c
and	c
singing	c
in	c
front	c
of	c
the	c
stage	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
after	c
the	c
play	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
still	c
closed	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
since	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
child	c
I	c
have	c
noticed	c
that	c
except	i
for	c
the	c
medical	c
facilities	c
and	c
achievements	c
,	c
it	c
has	c
brought	c
to	i
me	c
more	c
disadvantages	c
than	c
advantages	c
.	c

Unfortunatly	i
my	c
parents	c
did	c
not	c
realize	c
how	c
TV	c
was	c
creating	i
a	i
role	i
among	c
us	c
.	c

Despite	c
all	c
these	c
advantages	c
,	c
I	c
deeply	c
miss	c
the	c
times	c
I	c
had	c
almost	c
no	c
technological	c
facilities	i
,	c
but	c
a	c
very	c
happy	c
and	c
united	c
family	c
.	c

Besides	c
this	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
some	c
of	c
the	c
concert	c
halls	c
were	c
too	c
small	c
that	i
I	c
felt	c
very	c
uncomfortable	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
the	c
one-reasonably-priced	i
weekend	c
ticket	c
for	c
all	c
events	i
was	c
marvellous	c
because	c
I	c
was	c
able	c
to	c
attend	c
as	c
many	c
concerts	c
as	c
I	c
wished	c
without	c
spending	c
much	c
money	c
.	c

Although	c
that	c
Festival	c
was	c
not	c
well-organized	i
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
you	c
to	c
repeat	c
it	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

Personally	c
,	c
I	c
can	i
not	i
imagine	c
human	c
life	c
without	c
rules	c
,	c
especially	c
those	c
that	c
have	c
to	c
do	c
with	c
respecting	c
other	c
people	c
.	c

At	c
home	c
it	c
is	c
the	c
other	c
way	c
about	i
.	c

Fortunately	c
,	c
rules	c
are	c
made	c
by	c
every	c
member	c
of	c
the	c
family	c
so	c
that	c
no	c
one	c
complains	c
about	c
them	c
.	c

Anyway	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
nowhere	i
as	i
good	c
as	c
it	c
was	c
mentioned	i
to	c
be	c
and	c
it	c
was	c
definately	i
worse	c
than	c
I	c
had	c
expected	c
it	c
to	c
be	c
,	i
I	c
did	c
n't	c
enjoy	c
it	c
at	c
all	c
so	c
I	c
was	c
relying	c
on	c
the	c
food	c
to	c
fill	c
me	c
up	c
and	c
relieve	c
some	c
of	c
my	c
stress	c
.	c

So	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
over	c
we	c
walked	c
out	c
and	c
followed	c
all	c
the	c
signs	c
for	c
about	c
5	c
minutes	c
desparately	i
searching	c
for	c
your	c
restaurants	i
our	i
stomaches	i
rumbling	c
for	c
food	c
.	c

Finally	c
we	c
found	c
the	c
place	c
.	c

And	c
your	c
booking	c
staff	c
did	c
n't	c
know	c
this	c
obviously	c
as	c
they	c
took	c
our	c
booking	c
,	c
with	c
no	c
problems	i
whatsoever	c
.	c

You	c
do	c
n't	c
understand	c
how	c
dissappointed	i
and	c
angry	c
I	c
was	c
that	c
night	c
.	c

Yours	c
Sincerely	i
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

this	i
was	c
a	i
vary	i
bad	i
thing	i
about	i
Pat	i
's	i
school	i
and	i
also	i
for	i
Pat	i
.	c

Another	c
bad	c
thing	c
about	c
this	c
school	c
was	c
that	c
there	c
where	i
different	c
types	c
of	c
students	c
that	c
formed	c
groups	c
.	c

No	c
one	c
could	c
do	c
anything	c
about	c
it	c
.	i

Pat	c
recieved	i
no	c
punishment	c
at	c
all	c
and	c
he	c
was	c
n't	c
blamed	c
for	c
anything	c
by	c
his	c
teachers	c
or	c
friends	c
.	c

It	c
will	c
be	c
held	c
at	c
the	c
Central	c
Exhibition	c
Hall	c
in	c
London	c
on	c
the	c
14th	c
March	c
.	c

We	c
could	c
do	c
as	c
planned	c
for	c
Monday	c
and	c
move	c
going	c
to	c
the	c
Science	c
Museum	c
from	c
Tuesday	c
to	c
Wednesday	c
afternoon	c
.	c

We	c
would	c
have	c
to	c
forgo	c
the	c
shopping	c
as	c
we	c
might	c
not	c
have	c
enough	c
time	c
and	c
the	c
exchange	c
rate	c
might	c
be	c
too	c
high	c
for	c
us	c
to	c
do	c
much	c
shopping	c
.	c

Everyday	i
,	c
something	c
changes	c
and	c
we	c
become	c
more	c
modern	i
companies	i
use	c
computers	c
instead	c
of	c
books	c
,	c
dentist	i
use	c
modernized	c
electrical	i
item	i
instead	c
of	c
just	c
a	c
plier	i
,	i
even	i
homes	c
are	c
effected	i
.	c

No	c
,	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
,	c
the	c
present	c
will	c
be	c
the	c
past	c
and	c
these	i
things	c
now	c
new	c
to	c
use	i
will	c
be	c
old	c
,	c
outdated	c
and	c
changed	c
.	c

We	c
will	c
be	c
learning	c
at	c
home	c
using	c
computers	c
and	c
disc	i
.	c

We	c
might	c
not	c
need	c
maids	c
to	c
do	c
housework	c
anymore	c
as	c
they	c
can	c
easily	c
be	c
replaced	c
with	c
a	c
robot	c
,	c
a	c
machine	c
,	c
or	c
something	c
other	i
with	c
the	c
same	c
purpose	c
.	c

Our	c
homes	c
will	c
still	c
be	c
the	c
same	c
in	c
terms	c
of	c
the	c
kitchen	i
,	i
it	i
will	c
still	c
be	c
filled	c
with	c
vegetables	c
and	c
meat	c
.	c

I	c
especially	c
appreciate	i
the	c
weekend	c
tickets	c
which	c
almost	c
everybody	c
could	c
afford	c
,	c
also	i
students	c
like	c
me	c
.	c

Are	c
you	c
young	c
and	c
full	c
of	c
life	c
but	c
you	i
do	c
n't	c
have	c
enough	c
money	c
to	c
enjoy	c
your	c
spare	c
time	c
?	c

Simply	c
let	c
your	c
brain	c
work	c
and	c
you	c
could	c
find	i
out	i
wonderful	c
ideas	c
to	c
earn	c
money	c
enjoying	c
yourself	c
.	c

Do	c
you	c
like	c
do-it-yourself	c
and	c
your	i
house	i
is	i
full	c
of	c
marvellous	c
but	c
unuseful	i
things	c
?	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	i
response	c
to	c
the	c
international	i
Arsts	i
Festival	c
,	c
which	c
took	c
place	c
on	c
21-22	c
November	c
.	c

I	c
could	i
be	i
fine	i
if	i
I	i
had	i
seen	c
more	c
countries	c
from	c
all	c
around	c
the	c
world	c
,	c
for	c
instance	c
:	i
far	i
east	i
,	c
indonesia	i
etc	c
.	c

On	i
the	i
other	i
side	i
,	c
I	c
enjoyed	c
to	i
being	c
on	i
of	c
the	c
people	c
to	i
see	i
the	c
plays	c
and	i
films	c
,	c
dance	i
shows	c
which	c
was	i
brillantly	i
performed	c
-	i
art	i
exbitions	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
,	i
if	c
you	c
could	c
expend	i
the	c
plays	c
and	c
films	c
more	i
for	i
next	c
year	c
?	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
preciate	i
your	c
organisation	i
and	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	i
the	c
next	c
International	c
Arts	c
Festival	c
.	c

Its	i
a	c
good	c
idea	c
to	c
send	c
them	c
to	c
me	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
confess	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
lost	c
my	c
camera	c
and	c
also	c
the	c
films	c
.	c

I	c
must	c
say	c
that	c
our	c
school	c
rules	c
are	c
quite	c
different	c
than	i
yours	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
missed	i
a	c
lesson	c
,	c
that	c
could	c
be	i
a	c
trouble	i
for	c
yourself	i
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
do	c
more	c
homeworks	i
or	c
they	c
are	i
sending	i
you	c
home	c
etc.	c
Of	c
course	c
smoking	c
is	c
n't	c
allowed	c
at	i
any	c
part	c
of	c
the	c
schol	i
.	c

But	c
in	c
many	c
Families	i
women	i
are	i
doing	i
more	c
than	c
men	c
.	c

Apart	c
from	c
that	c
I	c
would	c
n't	c
mind	c
at	c
all	c
whether	c
to	i
stay	i
in	c
tents	c
or	c
log	c
cabins	c
but	c
if	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
choose	c
between	c
these	c
two	c
I	c
'd	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
tents	c
because	c
it	i
gives	i
me	c
a	c
nice	c
feeling	c
and	i
relaxation	c
,	i
it	i
is	c
very	c
unusal	i
for	i
me	i
to	c
stay	c
in	c
log	c
cabins	c
while	c
you	c
are	c
camping	c
.	c

Second	c
activity	c
it	i
would	c
be	c
tennis	c
,	i
I	c
am	c
not	c
the	i
expert	c
in	i
this	c
one	i
because	c
I	c
've	c
played	c
it	c
only	c
twice	c
but	c
I	c
know	c
how	c
to	c
hit	c
the	c
ball	c
and	c
basic	c
stuff	c
like	c
;	i
serve	i
the	c
ball	c
,	c
back	i
hand	i
and	c
fore	i
hand	i
to	c
hit	c
the	c
ball	c
.	c

Finally	c
I	c
have	c
something	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
about	c
how	c
many	c
people	c
can	c
stay	c
in	c
one	c
tents	i
?	i

What	i
would	c
you	c
like	c
to	c
after	i
the	c
class	c
or	c
during	c
the	c
weekend	c
?	c

Why	c
?	c

But	c
I	c
think	c
I	c
will	c
choose	c
Basketball	c
and	c
Photography	c
,	c
because	c
basketball	c
is	c
the	c
only	c
sport	c
I	c
can	c
play	c
well	c
.	c

Photography	c
is	c
a	c
very	c
interesting	c
activitie	i
,	c
and	c
is	c
not	c
too	c
hard	c
to	c
do	c
too	i
.	c

Yours	c
Sincerely	c

So	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
thing	c
you	c
will	c
enjoy	c
most	c
of	c
the	c
time	c
,	c
but	c
still	c
have	i
something	i
you	i
will	i
not	i
enjoy	i
it	i
.	c

It	c
depends	c
on	c
what	i
is	i
the	i
place	i
and	i
the	i
aim	i
you	i
are	i
shopping	i
.	c

The	c
place	c
where	c
you	c
are	c
shopping	c
also	i
very	c
important	c
.	c

Because	c
have	i
too	c
many	c
people	c
it	c
make	i
you	c
want	c
to	c
stay	c
home	c
wo	i
n't	c
enjoy	c
shopping	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
just	c
writing	c
this	c
letter	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
I	c
have	i
seen	i
last	c
Sunday	c
at	i
the	c
evening	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
ready	c
at	c
19:30	c
time	i
,	c
as	c
you	c
have	i
announced	i
,	c
and	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
stay	c
waiting	c
in	c
front	c
of	c
the	c
theatre	c
until	c
20:15	c
,	c
when	c
finally	i
the	i
show	i
began	c
.	c

How	c
has	c
modern	c
technology	c
changed	c
your	c
daily	c
life	c
?	c

From	i
that	c
time	c
,	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
buy	c
my	c
own	c
computer	c
and	c
every	c
day	c
I	c
was	c
improving	c
my	c
knowledge	c

famous	c

You	c

You	c

quite	c
intered	i
in	c
magic	c

I	c
'd	c
like	c

you	c
to	i
take	i

on	c
a	c
trip	c
to	c
London	c
and	c
have	i
made	i
such	c
a	c
good	c
programme	c
,	c
especially	c
the	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c

like	i

a	c
pleisure	i

I	c
think	c

it	i
's	i
a	c
good	c
idea	c

Nevertheless	c
,	c
it	c
has	c
affected	c
every	c
person	c
and	c
hopefully	c
in	c
a	c
good	c
way	c

However	c
,	c
many	c
people	c
,	i
insist	c
that	c
new	c
technologies	c
affect	c
people	c
in	c
a	c
negative	c
way	c
.	c

But	c
also	c
,	i
I	c
would	i
not	i
be	i
able	c
to	c
imagine	c
my	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
ask	c
permission	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
.	c

We	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
there	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
very	c
popular	c
nowadays	c
.	c

I	c
've	c
heard	c
that	c
Leisure	i
and	c
sports	c
wear	c
,	c
make	i
up	i
and	c
hairstyles	c
are	c
really	c
wonderful	c
.	c

We	c
all	c
know	c
that	c
you	c
organised	i
everything	c
.	c

We	c
can	c
also	c
do	c
shopping	i
quickly	c
after	c
sightseeing	c
of	i
London	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

After	c
I	c
had	c
had	c
my	c
breakfast	c
I	c
put	c
my	c
clothes	c
on	c
.	c

It	c
would	i
be	c
the	c
most	c
excising	i
activity	c
in	i
this	c
trip	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
the	i
addmission	i
is	c
free	c
for	c
students	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
"	c
shopping	c
on	c
14	c
,	i
March	c
'	c
can	c
be	c
changed	c
to	c
15	c
,	i
March	c
instead	c
of	c
"	c
Free	c
time	c
"	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c

Some	c
people	c
said	i
that	c
famous	c
people	c
such	c
as	c
politicians	c
,	c
and	c
film	c
stars	c
,	c
needs	i
to	c
have	c
a	c
private	c
life	c
without	c
journalists	c
following	c
them	c
all	c
the	c
time	c

However	c
,	c
secondly	c
,	c
famous	c
people	c
are	c
not	c
"	c
ailen	i
"	c
so	c
that	i
they	c
might	c
do	c
something	c
,	c
for	c
example	c
,	c
ashame	i
things	c
in	c
public	i
space	c
or	i
argument	i
with	c
partner	i
or	c
family	c
even	i
put	c
on	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
there	c
was	c
one	c
reasonably-priced	i
weekend	c
ticket	c
for	c
all	c
events	c
.	c

I	c
enjoyed	c
it	c
very	c
much	c

The	c
boy	c
had	c
grown	c

had	c

there	c
were	c
lots	c
of	c

on	c
Onigashima	c

who	c
robbed	c
many	c

With	c
regard	c
to	c
the	c
activities	c
at	c
the	c
Camp	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
choose	c
basketball	c
and	c
photography	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
basketball	c
is	c
very	i
complete	i
sport	c
for	c
training	c
your	c
muscles	c
and	c
I	c
used	c
to	c
play	c
in	c
a	c
league	c
in	c
my	c
country	c
,	i
it	i
's	i
hard	c
but	c
at	c
the	c
same	c
time	c
lovely	c
.	c

Another	c
thing	c
is	i
if	c
the	c
meals	c
are	c
include	i
or	c
I	i
have	c
to	c
paid	i
for	c
them	c
?	i

You	i
Sincerely	i
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
more	c
details	c
about	c
the	c
show	c
and	c
particularly	c
what	i
does	i
it	c
include	i
.	c

Really	c
interesting	c
!	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
it	i
will	i
be	i
a	i
great	i
opportunity	i
to	i
all	i
of	i
us	i
to	i
be	i
on	i
this	i
show	i
while	c
we	c
are	c
going	i
to	i
be	i
in	c
London	c
.	c

What	c
do	c
you	c
think	c
about	c
picking	c
five	c
people	c
and	c
give	i
them	c
tickets	c
for	c
'	c
Art	c
Travel	c
'	c
?	c

Generally	c
it	c
was	c
very	c
good	c
and	c
I	c
wish	i
more	c
people	c
would	i
come	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

This	c
is	c
very	c
important	c
,	c
because	c
many	c
accidents	c
happen	c
because	c
of	c
running	c
.	c

When	c
we	c
need	c
to	c
go	c
upstairs	c
,	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
keep	c
left	c
and	c
when	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
go	c
downstairs	c
,	c
you	c
need	c
to	c
keep	c
left	c
as	c
well	c
.	c

You	c
have	c
to	c
do	c
your	c
homework	c
and	c
do	c
your	c
best	c
what	i
you	c
're	c
asked	c
to	c
do	c
.	c

Second	c
,	c
at	c
home	c
we	c
all	c
have	c
different	c
rules	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
:	c

We	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
again	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c
.	c

This	c
story	c
happed	i
two	c
years	c
ago	c
.	c

That	c
was	c
a	c
very	c
hot	c
summer	c
,	i
every	i
people	c
in	c
our	c
city	c
like	i
to	c
swim	c
in	c
the	c
river	c
,	i
perhaps	i
they	c
did	c
n't	c
think	c
it	c
was	c
interesting	c
if	c
they	c
swimed	i
in	c
the	c
pool	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
went	i
the	c
river-side	i
bank	c
,	c
I	c
saw	c
some	c
red-faced	i
.	c

I	c
enjoyed	c
it	c
and	c
found	c
worthy	i
to	i
visit	i
.	c

You	c
could	c
have	c
let	c
us	c
get	c
used	i
to	i
more	c
cultures	c
by	c
inviting	c
from	i
some	c
other	c
countries	c
too	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
could	c
hardly	c
participated	i
in	i
all	c
of	c
the	c
concerts	c
.	c

The	c
organisation	c
was	c
very	c
good	c
I	i
found	c
chances	c
to	c
see	c
dance	c
shows	c
,	c
art	c
exhibitions	c
and	c
to	c
listen	c
to	c
writers	c
,	c
but	c
there	c
could	c
be	c
more	c
plays	c
and	c
films	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

Thanks	c
for	c
everything	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
in	c
a	c
hurry	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
will	c
directly	i
come	i
to	c
the	c
point	c
.	c

At	c
schools	i
we	c
have	c
certain	c
rules	c
like	c
being	c
in	c
the	c
class	c
,	c
sitting	c
in	c
your	c
place	c
before	c
the	c
lecture	c
starts	c
,	c
bringing	c
in	c
your	c
equipment	c
with	c
you	c
,	c
keeping	c
quiet	c
during	c
the	c
lessons	c
and	c
raising	c
your	c
hand	c
when	c
you	c
want	c
to	c
talk	c
.	c

You	c
should	c
wear	c
the	c
same	c
things	c
every	c
time	c
,	c
no	c
changes	c
and	c
alternations	c
are	c
allowed	c
.	c

You	c
should	c
be	c
punctual	c
when	c
coming	c
to	c
dining	i
table	c
,	c
respectful	c
,	c
do	c
your	c
home	i
works	i
and	c
watch	c
TV	c
less	c
and	c
not	c
too	c
loud	c
.	c

They	c
are	c
against	c
democracy	c
I	c
think	c
.	c

With	c
all	c
my	c
love	c
,	c

Secondly	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
should	c
have	c
started	c
at	c
19:30	c
p.m.	c
,	c
and	c
it	c
began	c
fourty-five	i
minutes	c
later	i
.	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
coffe	i
after	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
but	c
when	c
I	c
tried	c
to	c
get	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

This	c
was	c
the	c
worst	c
night	c
that	c
I	c
had	c
during	c
my	c
stay	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

For	c
all	c
that	i
reasons	c
,	c
I	c
want	c
you	c
to	c
refund	c
the	c
cost	c
of	c
the	c
tickets	c
and	c
to	c
send	c
the	c
money	c
back	i
to	c
my	c
house	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

Some	c
time	c
later	c
all	i
the	i
things	i
were	i
finally	c
prepared	c
.	c

Regarding	c
accommodation	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
because	c
cabins	c
seem	c
to	c
be	c
more	c
comfortable	c
than	c
tents	c
.	c

According	c
to	c
your	c
letter	c
,	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
take	c
part	c
in	c
two	c
activities	c
at	c
the	c
Camp	c
.	c

Let	c
me	c
tell	c
you	c
that	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
sing	c
and	c
play	c
tennis	c
.	c

This	c
report	c
is	c
to	c
suggest	c
which	c
lessons	c
and	c
activities	c
should	c
be	c
filmed	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
make	c
the	c
video	c
about	c
daily	c
life	c
at	c
school	c
.	c

Activities	c
connected	c
with	c
the	c
social	c
programme	c
such	i
as	c
international	c
evenings	c
,	c
sing	i
along	i
parties	c
and	c
indoor	c
games	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
,	c

In	c
this	c
way	c
,	c
we	c
can	c
go	c
to	c
visit	c
the	c
Science	c
Museum	c
earlier	c
in	c
the	c
morning	c
and	c
the	i
,	i
we	c
can	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

.	c
.	c

Oh	c
I	c
forgot	c
about	c
it	i
!	c

Do	c
you	c
think	c
you	c
've	c
the	i
future	c
in	c
your	c
hands	c
?	c

Would	c
you	c
like	c
living	i
in	c
a	c
modern	c
way	c
?	c

Can	c
you	c
compare	c
it	c
.	c

Well	c
,	c
you	c
can	c
look	c
at	c
your	c
house	c
.	c

We	c
will	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
accelerate	i
the	c
process	i
of	c
the	i
computer	i
's	i
games	c
for	i
example	c
...	c

Dear	c
Principal	c
,	c
First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
we	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
good	i
programme	c
which	c
provides	c
us	c
3	i
days	i
stay	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

It	c
contains	c
a	c
wide	c
range	c
of	c
activities	c
for	i
example	c
,	c
sightseeing	c
,	c
river	i
trip	c
,	c
visiting	c
science	i
museum	c
and	c
gallery	c
,	c
shopping	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
certain	c
that	c
the	c
programme	c
will	c
give	c
the	c
students	c
considerable	c
enjoyment	c
.	c

All	c
of	c
us	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
attend	c
the	c
show	c
because	c
young	c
people	c
,	c
particularly	c
girls	c
are	i
interested	c
in	c
fashion	c
and	c
make	i
up	i
,	c
so	c
we	c
are	c
expecting	c
the	c
show	c
will	i
be	i
the	i
great	c
opportunity	c
to	c
see	c
what	c
the	c
new	c
trend	i
in	c
fashion	c
will	c
be	c
like	c
.	c

In	c
spite	c
of	c
the	c
computer	c
,	c
children	c
will	c
need	c
food	c
their	c
mothers	c
make	c
and	c
love	c
expressed	c
not	c
by	c
a	c
computer	c
,	c
but	c
by	c
parents	c
themselves	c
.	c

I	c
must	c
keep	c
a	i
good	c
condition	c
to	c
make	c
a	c
masterpiece	c
.	c

By	c
the	c
way	c
,	c
Do	i
you	c
want	c
to	c
hear	c
my	i
experience	c
about	i
pop	i
concert	c
?	c

I	c
enjoyed	c
helping	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
last	c
month	c
.	c

There	c
are	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
people	c
.	c

It	c
sounds	c
really	c
bad	c
but	c
I	c
enjoyed	c
this	c
pop	c
concert	c
to	c
my	c
heart	c
's	c
content	c
.	c

His	c
voice	c
is	c
also	c
soulful	c
and	c
sometimes	c
even	c
gave	c
us	c
blissful	c

Bye	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
the	c
programme	c
you	c
have	c
organised	c
for	c
our	c
visit	c
to	c
London	c
.	c

An	i
especiall	i
invitation	c

It	c
was	c
dangerous	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
knew	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
.	c

We	c
spent	c
2	c
weeks	c
with	c
the	c
family	c
.	c

The	c
first	c
week	c
was	c
find	i
,	c
but	c
on	i
the	c
second	c
week	c
I	c
got	c
very	c
seek	i
.	c

I	c
really	c
enjoyed	c
to	i
serve	i
the	c
drinks	c
to	c
the	c
pop-stars	c
.	c

You	c
could	c
speak	c
to	c
them	c
and	c
you	c
could	c
see	c
that	c
a	c
lot	c
were	c
very	c
cool	c
and	c
the	c
other	c
ones	c
were	c
still	i
in	i
the	i
sky	i
.	c

And	c
you	c
heard	c
the	c
concerts	c
too	c
.	c

After	c
the	c
concert	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
clean	c
the	c
area	c
and	c
it	c
took	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
because	c
people	c
were	i
like	c
pigs	c
.	c

One	c
more	c
word	c
!	c

Dear	c
Jane	c
Clark	c
,	c

Firstly	c
,	c
could	c
you	c
invite	c
stars	c
and	c
artists	c
from	c
more	c
than	c
only	c
six	c
contries	i
?	c

Probably	c
the	c
best	c
way	c
you	c
can	c
get	c
money	c
is	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
part	i
time	i
job	c
in	c
your	c
spare	c
time	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
just	c
decide	c
to	c
work	c
,	c
you	c
'd	c
better	c
to	i
find	i
a	c
job	c
in	i
your	c
place	c
.	c

The	c
show	c
had	i
to	c
start	c
at	c
19:30	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
.	c

I	c
invited	c
a	c
friend	c
of	c
mine	c
and	c
promised	c
her	c
that	c
we	c
will	i
go	c
there	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
disappointed	c
,	i
that	i
is	c
why	c
I	c
am	c
asking	c
you	c
for	c
compensation	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

But	c
she	c
told	c
it	c
to	c
very	i
kid	c
in	c
school	c
,	c
even	c
the	c
teachers	c
heard	c
it	c
.	c

In	c
addictions	i
,	c
the	c
ticket	i
's	i
price	i
is	i
too	c
expensive	c
and	c
difficult	i
to	c
buy	c
another	i
one	c
every	c
day	c
,	i
so	i
,	c
I	c
think	c
is	i
more	c
effective	c
if	c
was	i
one	c
reasonably-priced	c
weekend	c
ticket	c
for	c
all	c
events	c
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
I	c
hope	i
will	i
be	c
better	c
next	c
year	c
if	c
these	c
points	c
was	i
observed	c
for	i
the	i
each	i
year	i
the	i
event	i
to	i
be	i
better	c
than	c
before	c
.	c

How	c
are	c
you	c
?	c

The	c
rules	c
must	c
be	c
respect	i
for	i
all	c
people	c
if	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
want	c
get	i
out	c
from	i
scholl	i
.	c

It	c
was	c
so	i
close	c
to	c
be	i
on	i
his	c
birthday	c
,	c
so	c
we	c
made	c
a	c
decision	c
to	c
hold	c
a	c
small	c
party	c
for	c
him	c
.	c

While	c
she	c
was	c
choosing	c
vegetables	c
in	i
a	c
market	c
,	c
she	c
came	c
across	c
him	c
.	c

That	c
caused	c
the	c
secret	c
disclosed	i
.	c

Anyway	c
,	c
Happy	c
Birthday	c
to	c
Griffin	c
,	c
again	c
.	c

Dear	c
Jean	c
Clark	c
,	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
hearing	i
from	c
you	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
tell	i
me	c
in	c
your	c
last	c
letter	c
you	i
were	c
talking	c
about	c
rules	c
in	c
your	c
class	c
and	c
you	c
want	i
to	c
know	c
about	c
school	c
rules	c
in	c
my	c
country	c
and	c
also	c
what	c
I	c
am	c
allowed	c
to	c
do	c
at	c
home	c
.	c

Granny	c
is	c
the	c
problem	c
she	i
's	c
a	c
bit	c
bossy	c
!	c

She	c
usually	c
tells	c
me	c
what	c
to	c
do	c
and	c
what	c
kind	i
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
should	c
wear	c
but	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
care	i
about	i
it	i
.	c

Give	c
my	c
love	c
to	c
your	c
parents	c
.	c

What	c
is	c
more	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
is	c
free	c
for	c
all	c
the	i
students	c
.	c

We	c
feel	c
that	c
taking	c
part	c
to	i
it	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
to	i
us	c
since	c
we	c
will	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
have	i
some	c
information	c
about	c
the	c
world	c
of	c
fashion	c
,	c
which	c
is	c
becoming	c
more	c
and	c
more	c
important	c
in	c
our	c
days	i
.	c

It	c
will	c
take	c
place	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
from	c
10.00am	c
to	c
19.00pm	i
,	c
so	c
we	c
could	c
give	c
up	c
the	i
shopping	c
and	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
show	c
in	c
the	c
afternoon	c
.	c

They	c
can	i
not	i
even	c
have	c
a	c
pizza	c
with	c
friend	i
who	i
stops	c
them	c
and	c
asks	c
them	c
for	c
an	c
autograph	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
just	c
recieved	i
the	c
letter	c
,	c
which	c
lets	c
me	c
know	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
.	c

Because	i
I	c
intend	c
to	c
take	c
examination	i
in	c
Septenber	i
.	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

Actually	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
bit	c
ashamed	c
but	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
my	c
brilliant	c
memory	c
.	c

Anyway	c
it	c
was	c
so	c
interesting	c
time	i
that	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
even	c
feel	c
tired	c
after	c
that	c
.	c

Love	c
,	c

However	c
,	c
some	c
students	c
in	c
our	c
class	c
have	c
seen	c
an	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
and	c
we	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
have	c
an	c
opportunity	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
show	c

We	c
have	i
concerned	i
it	c
as	i
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
to	c
touch	c
a	c
part	c
of	c
latest	i
cultures	c
,	c
which	c
are	c
concentrated	c
and	c
sharpened	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

We	c
suppose	c
that	c
in	i
free	i
time	c
on	c
Wednesday	c
we	c
can	c
find	c
some	c
time	c
for	c
shopping	c

Yours	c
sincerily	i
,	c

The	c
longer	c
and	c
further	i
they	c
live	c
on	c
their	c
own	c

the	c
more	c
they	c
may	c
feel	c
that	c
they	c
need	c
a	c
family	c

New	c
materials	c
will	c
surly	i
change	c
the	c
home	c

the	c
future	c
in	c
any	i
ways	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
do	c
Basketball	c
and	c
Painting	c
.	c

I	c
played	c
Basketball	c
at	c
school	c
for	c
about	c
two	c
years	c
.	c

First	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
point	c
out	c
,	i
that	c
this	i
was	c
a	c
good	c
idea	c
to	c
present	i
our	c
school	c
in	c
a	c
short	c
film	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
first	c
of	c
all	c
we	c
should	c
film	c
an	c
english	i
lesson	c
,	c
where	c
pupils	c
could	c
prepare	c
some	c
group	c
work	c
or	c
information-boards	i
.	c

After	c
that	c
,	c
I	c
should	c
also	c
mention	c
,	i
that	c
this	c
evening	c
was	c
dull	c
,	c
boring	c
and	c
the	c
worst	c
in	c
my	c
life	c
.	c

Nowadays	c
it	i
's	c
getting	c
obvious	c
that	c
designers	c
sold	i
only	c
details	i
,	c
but	i
significant	c
changes	c
do	c
n't	c
turn	c
up	c
.	c

That	c
's	c
why	c
I	c
believe	c
in	c
the	c
solution	c
which	c
is	c
the	c
closest	c
to	c
human	c
nature	c
and	c
can	c
help	c
us	c
to	c
omit	i
the	i
boredome	i
I	i
am	c
sure	c
that	c
at	i
last	i
we	c
will	c
take	c
off	c
our	c
clothes	c
and	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
we	c
will	c
be	c
undressed	c
and	c
free	i
there	i
wo	c
n't	c
be	c
any	c
problem	c
with	c
being	c
up-do-date	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
you	c
changed	c
actors	c
without	c
informing	c
viewers	i
.	c

But	c
thanks	c
to	c
mobile	c
phone	i
I	c
can	c
contact	c
him	c
even	c
if	c
he	c
is	c
sailing	c
in	c
the	c
Atlantic	c
Ocean	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
future	c
I	c
would	c
love	c
to	c
be	c
a	c
doctor	c
,	c
especially	c
a	c
cardiologist	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
see	c
some	c
disadvantages	c
of	c
technological	c
progress	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
spend	c
too	c
much	c
time	c
indoors	c
playing	c
computer	i
or	c
watching	c
TV	c
.	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

The	c
two	c
activities	c
that	c
I	c
choose	c
are	c
:	c
basketball	c
and	c
climbing	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
very	c
interesting	c
and	c
I	c
enjoyed	c
reading	c
it	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
very	c
important	c
experience	c
for	c
me	c
because	c
I	c
learnt	c
all	c
about	c
the	c
organisation	c
of	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
.	c

Looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

.	c
.	c

Girls	i
should	i
like	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
latest	c
fashion	i
,	c
new	c
make-up	c
and	c
interesting	c
hairstyles	c
.	c

More	c
houses	c
will	c
have	c
gardens	c
what	i
will	c
make	c
us	c
feel	c
closer	c
to	c
the	i
nature	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
not	c
think	c
so	c
.	c

At	i
the	i
begining	i
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
.	c

And	c
finally	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
some	c
questions	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
Every	i
thing	i

Secondly	c
,	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
it	c
was	i
written	i
that	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
to	c
start	c
at	c
19:30	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
,	c
almost	c
an	c
hour	c
late	c
.	c

We	c
did	c
not	c
have	c
"	c
a	c
perfect	c
evening	c
"	c
as	c
it	c
was	i
written	i
,	c
actually	c
we	c
had	c
an	c
evening	c
full	c
of	c
the	c
theatre	c
's	c
mistakes	c
and	c
were	c
extremely	c
disappointed	c
.	c

I	c
suppose	i
it	c
will	c
be	c
better	c
for	c
your	c
theatre	c
's	c
reputation	c
to	c
give	c
at	c
least	c
some	c
of	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

We	c
live	c
in	c
a	c
technologically	c
well-developed	c
world	c
,	c
having	c
every	c
opportunity	c
for	c
communication	c
,	c
education	c
and	c
entertainment	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
look	c
at	c
my	c
life	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
understand	c
I	c
am	c
dependent	c
on	c
the	c
machines	c
.	c

My	c
daily	c
life	c
is	c
programmed	c
up	i
to	c
the	c
virtual	c
world	c
I	c
created	c
.	c

Dear	c
Ms.	c
Jane	c
Clark	c
,	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
greater	i
if	c
there	c
were	c
more	c
famous	c
people	c
who	i
have	i
various	c
nationalities	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
be	c
glad	c
if	c
you	c
consider	i
my	c
suggestions	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
some	c
good	c
ways	c
for	c
you	c
to	c
earn	c
enough	c
money	c
to	c
enjoy	c
yourself	c
.	c

Not	c
only	c
it	i
's	i
a	c
simple	c
job	c
,	c
but	c
also	c
you	c
can	c
enjoy	c
working	c
with	c
many	i
colleague	i
at	i
your	c
age	c
.	c

It	c
would	c
be	c
great	c
fan	i
to	c
make	c
friends	c
outside	c
your	c
class	c
or	c
club	c
.	c

Dir	i
Madam	c

I	c
was	c
really	c
suprised	i
when	c
I	c
opened	c
it	c
.	c

We	c
had	i
always	c
enjoying	i
ourselves	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
taken	c
part	c
in	c
any	c
competitions	c
connected	c
with	c
this	c
sport	c
.	c

Most	c
people	c
think	c
that	c
if	c
they	c
have	c
got	c
money	c
they	c
will	c
buy	c
everything	c
what	i
they	c
want	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
n't	c
true	c
.	c

Nowdays	i
we	c
have	c
many	c
big	c
shopping	c
centers	i
.	c

The	c
most	c
suitable	c
time	c
for	c
shopping	c
is	c
weekand	i
when	c
parents	c
do	c
n't	c
work	c
and	c
children	c
have	c
n't	c
got	c
a	i
school	c
.	c

Because	c
of	c
that	c
shopping	i
centers	i
are	c
over	i
crowded	i
.	c

On	c
balance	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
shopping	c
should	c
be	c
a	c
nice	c
thing	c
so	c
if	c
you	c
have	i
bad	i
mood	c
do	c
n't	c
go	c
shopping	c
.	c

We	c
have	c
some	c
suggestions	c
about	c
how	c
to	c
change	c
the	c
programme	c
.	c

The	c
yellow	i
press	i
is	c
searching	c
for	c
every	c
little	c
information	i
they	c
can	c
get	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
the	i
people	c
have	c
choose	i
to	c
walk	c
on	i
this	c
path	c
.	c

At	i
first	i
the	c
show	c
started	c
much	c
later	c
than	c
it	i
was	c
written	i
out	i
.	c

I	c
could	c
n't	c
go	c
to	c
have	i
a	i
refreshment	c
because	i
of	i
two	c
reasons	c
,	c
the	c
first	c
one	c
is	c
that	c
there	c
was	c
no	c
information	c
how	i
much	i
time	i
the	c
start	c
of	c
the	c
show	c
is	i
going	c
to	c
be	c
late	c
.	i

For	c
these	c
reasons	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
to	i
get	i
my	c
money	c
of	i
£	c
25	c
back	i
.	c

reasently	i

What	c
is	c
the	c
prize	c
?	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

"	c
Sarah	c
has	c
won	c
in	c
a	c
quiz	c
show	c
?	c
"	c

James	c
was	c
more	c
than	c
just	c
interested	c
,	c
he	c
wanted	c
to	c
know	c
what	c
she	c
had	c
won	c
.	c

Suddenly	c
,	c
she	c
went	c
to	c
Pat	c
and	c
asked	c
him	i
did	i
you	c
tell	c
anybody	c
about	c
our	c
secret	c
.	i

In	c
spite	c
of	c
this	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
got	c
all	c
equipement	i
I	c
need	c
for	c
the	i
activity	i
painting	c
and	c
I	c
am	i
painting	i
very	c
well	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

I	c
went	c
there	c
a	i
10	c
o'clock	c
in	c
the	c
morning	c
.	c

The	c
food	c
was	c
deligious	i
and	c
fortunately	c
I	c
do	i
not	i
had	i
to	c
pay	c
for	c
it	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
end	c
I	c
was	c
happy	c
that	c
I	c
had	c
done	c
this	c
job	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
good	c
idea	c
if	c
we	c
two	c
did	c
this	c
job	c
together	c
the	i
next	c
year	c

25th	c
November	c
2000	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Clark	c
,	c

Moreover	c
,	c
the	c
stars	c
and	c
artists	c
were	c
only	i
from	i
six	c
countries	c
,	i
In	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
if	c
you	c
can	c
invite	c
more	c
stars	c
and	c
artists	c
from	c
more	c
countries	c
,	c
it	c
will	c
make	c
the	c
festival	c
more	c
exciting	c
,	c
more	c
intesting	i
,	c
and	c
from	i
my	i
point	i
of	i
view	i
,	c
some	c
concert	i
halls	c
were	c
too	c
small	c
,	i
the	i
people	c
in	c
there	c
could	c
n't	c
even	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
loo	c
!	i
because	c
it	c
was	c
too	c
crowed	i
.	c

It	i
was	c
really	c
pleased	c
to	c
receive	c
your	c
letter	c
yesterday	c
,	i
you	i
asked	c
me	c
about	c
rules	c
;	i
both	c
at	i
my	c
home	c
and	c
at	c
my	c
school	c
,	i
I	c
am	c
very	c
happy	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
about	c
this	c
.	c

Lots	c
of	c
love	c
,	c

According	c
to	c
the	c
advertisement	c
,	c
discounts	c
should	c
be	i
available	c
,	i
but	c
,	c
in	c
fact	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
refused	c
to	i
take	i
the	i
payment	i
for	i
tickets	i
in	i
this	i
way	i
.	c

In	c
addition	c
to	c
this	c
,	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
too	c
late	c
(	c
the	c
show	c
did	c
not	c
start	c
on	c
time	c
)	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
have	c
understood	i
this	c
if	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
had	c
been	c
marvellous	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
even	c
quite	c
interesting	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
you	c
to	c
return	c
my	c
money	c
.	c

You	c
promised	c
me	c
perfect	i
evening	c
out	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
most	c
terrible	c
in	c
my	c
life	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Her	c
boss	c
was	c
rich	i
man	c
,	c
really	c
rich	c
.	c

Pat	c
had	c
worked	c
for	c
him	c
for	c
two	c
years	c
.	c

One	c
of	c
them	c
was	c
about	c
her	c
boss	i
'	i
private	c
life	c
:	c
he	c
had	c
got	i
illegal	i
son	c
.	c

I	c
wase	i
n't	i
expecting	c
this	c
prize	c
because	c
was	i
to	i
good	c
to	c
be	c
true	c
.	c

About	c
the	c
Accomodation	i
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
sleep	c
on	i
the	i
tents	i
,	c
because	c
I	c
never	i
been	i
in	c
one	c
,	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
lot	c
more	c
fun	c
than	c
log	c
cabins	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
ameaising	i
how	c
people	c
change	c
during	i
the	i
years	i
,	i
for	i
example	i
now	c
shopping	c
for	c
me	c
is	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
most	c
entertaining	c
things	c
,	c
and	c
every	c
week	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
buy	c
something	c
.	c

I	c
enjoy	c
so	i
much	i
fashion	i
that	c
my	c
life	c
change	i
completely	c
since	c
I	c
start	i
to	c
study	c
clothes	i
designer	i
and	c
I	c
discover	i
that	c
fabrics	c
,	c
colors	i
,	c
are	c
really	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
enthusiatic	i
about	c
receiving	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
during	c
that	c
period	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
free	c
from	c
work	c
,	i
my	i
current	c
post	c
finishes	c
at	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
June	c
but	c
I	c
will	c
start	c
another	c
job	c
at	c
the	c
beginning	c
of	c
August	c
.	c

As	c
far	c
as	c
the	c
activities	c
are	c
concerned	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
chosen	c
to	c
do	c
Tennis	i
and	i
Swimming	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
good	c
at	c
playing	c
Tennis	i
and	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
learning	c
to	c
swim	c
for	c
three	c
months	c
so	c
it	c
could	c
be	c
a	i
useful	c
training	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

Moreover	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
are	c
the	c
best	c
for	c
living	c
in	c
the	c
camp	c
and	c
if	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
bring	c
with	c
me	c
a	c
large	c
amount	c
of	c
money	c
.	c

My	c
work	c
consisted	c
in	c
checking	c
the	c
tickets	c
,	c
the	i
number	c
on	c
them	c
and	c
taking	c
the	i
people	c
to	c
their	c
seats	c
.	c

I	c
write	c
you	i
because	c
last	c
friday	i
I	c
had	c
a	c
very	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
in	i
your	c
theatre	c
.	c

I	c
went	c
there	c
because	c
I	c
had	c
read	c
a	c
banner	i
about	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
"	c
,	c
but	c
many	i
informations	i
were	i
wrong	c
.	c

The	c
inventions	c
of	c
the	c
airplane	i
,	c
of	c
the	c
train	c
and	c
of	c
the	c
car	c
,	c
have	c
reduced	c
the	c
distances	c
of	c
the	c
world	c
,	c
so	c
we	c
can	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
other	c
side	c
of	c
the	c
world	c
in	c
half	c
a	c
day	c
.	c

In	i
everytime	i
of	c
the	c
day	c
I	c
can	c
communicate	c
with	c
people	c
of	c
all	c
nationality	i
of	c
the	c
world	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
have	i
informations	i
about	c
everything	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
buy	c
something	c
which	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
find	c
in	c
the	c
shops	c
of	i
my	c
town	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
can	c
do	c
anything	c
just	c
clicking	i
on	c
the	c
mouse	c
!	c

Sometimes	c
,	c
computer	i
substitudes	i
real	c
relationships	c
between	c
people	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
indicate	i
that	c
you	c
put	i
wrong	i
starting	c
and	c
finishing	c
hours	i
.	c

The	c
Musical	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
not	c
at	c
14:30	c
-	c
as	c
you	c
have	i
mentioned	i
.	c

The	c
place	c
you	c
have	i
offered	c
was	c
closed	c
and	c
there	c
was	c
nothing	c
to	c
eat	c
inside	c
the	c
theatre	c
at	c
all	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
you	c
have	i
advertised	i
,	i
I	c
would	c
have	c
perfect	i
evening	c
out	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
n't	c
a	c
film	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
n't	c
even	c
a	c
picture	c
from	c
mysterious	c
books	c
.	c

Women	c
will	c
wear	c
only	c
skirts	c
and	c
dresses	c
but	c
men	c
will	c
be	c
strictly	c
connected	c
with	c
trousers	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
advertisement	c
,	c
it	c
was	i
told	i
that	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
was	c
starring	c
,	c
but	c
in	c
place	c
of	c
him	c
there	c
was	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
and	c
he	c
was	c
really	c
dissapointing	i
.	c

I	c
could	c
not	c
see	c
any	c
portion	c
of	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
's	c
performance	c
at	i
him	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
can	c
understand	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
dreadful	c
time	c
and	c
I	c
went	i
my	c
money	c
back	c
as	c
a	c
solace	i
for	c
the	c
dissapointment	i
I	c
had	c
.	c

TECHNOLOGY	c
AND	c
MY	c
DAILY	c
LIFE	c

It	c
was	c
really	c
nice	c
.	i

It	c
is	c
awfull	i
!	c

And	c
the	c
problem	c
is	c
that	c
nobody	c
wants	c
to	c
wear	c
it	c
.	c

But	c
it	c
's	c
impossible	c
at	c
the	c
moment	c
.	c

What	c
should	c
I	c
say	c
you	i
about	c
home	c
...	c

I	c
had	c
to	c
wait	c
for	c
the	c
show	c
for	c
over	c
fourty	i
five	i
minutes	c
,	c
because	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
about	c
20:15	c
!	c

What	c
is	c
more	c
,	c
it	c
has	i
been	i
written	i
that	c
I	c
can	i
get	c
some	c
discounts	c
,	c
but	c
when	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
buy	c
a	c
cheaper	c
ticket	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
impossible	c
.	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
I	c
must	c
say	c
that	c
this	c
evening	c
out	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
be	c
perfect	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
not	c
of	i
course	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
kindly	i
for	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
,	c
because	c
some	c
information	c
placed	c
in	c
your	c
advertisement	c
about	c
the	c
musical	c
was	c
not	c
true	c
.	c

At	i
first	i
,	c
there	c
are	c
now	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
things	c
that	c
most	c
people	c
use	c
at	c
home	c
.	c

We	c
could	c
n't	c
imagine	c
our	c
life	c
without	c
them	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
the	i
modern	c
technology	c
has	c
some	c
disadvantages	c
.	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
as	c
far	c
as	c
I	c
am	c
concidered	i
,	c
modern	c
technology	c
has	c
changed	c
my	c
life	c
completely	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
on	i
July	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
some	c
holidays	c
during	c
this	i
month	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
working	c
the	c
rest	c
of	c
this	c
summer	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
we	c
are	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
tired	c
so	c
I	c
prefer	c
to	c
sleep	c
comfortably	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
I	c
am	c
not	c
so	c
good	c
in	i
it	c
.	c

Everybody	c
is	c
stressed	c
,	i
you	i
have	c
to	c
make	i
the	c
queue	c
.	c

You	c
have	c
to	c
find	c
which	c
shop	c
offers	c
you	c
good	c
quality	c
products	c
for	c
a	c
good	c
price	c
.	c

You	c
could	c
try	c
to	c
do	c
your	c
shopping	c
via	c
Internet	i
.	c

Perhaps	c
you	c
will	c
find	c
less	i
inconvenience	i
.	c

Dear	c
Manager	c
,	c

She	c
did	c
n't	c
want	c
to	c
tell	c
the	c
teachers	c
at	c
school	c
or	c
any	c
other	c
person	c
because	c
she	c
was	c
afraid	c
that	c
if	c
her	c
stepfather	c
find	i
out	c
about	c
that	i
,	c
he	c
would	c
get	c
made	i
and	c
hit	c
her	c
,	c
or	c
even	c
worse	c
,	c
kill	c
her	c
mother	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
sure	c
you	c
can	c
take	i
attention	i
on	i
this	c
.	c

And	c
the	c
weather	c
are	i
they	i
only	c
sunshiny	c
days	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c

To	i
spend	i
the	i
two	i
weeks	i
I	i
would	i
prefer	i
to	i
live	i
in	c
tents	i
,	c
that	c
's	c
in	i
my	c
opinion	c
a	i
way	c
to	c
be	c
nearer	c
the	c
enviroment	i
and	c
the	c
animals	c
,	c
although	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
mind	c
living	i
in	c
log	c
cabins	c

Eliza	c
Vasquez	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
the	c
majority	c
of	c
the	i
people	c
that	i
go	c
shopping	c
are	c
women	c
who	c
must	c
buy	c
food	c
and	c
other	c
kind	i
of	c
things	c
for	c
her	i
family	i
,	c
so	c
for	i
them	c
,	c
shopping	c
is	c
a	c
very	c
boring	c
activity	c
that	c
is	c
repeated	c
everyday	i
and	c
that	c
drive	i
them	c
crazy	c
when	c
they	c
have	c
to	c
choose	c
the	c
best	c
product	c
and	c
the	c
cheapest	c
price	c
to	c
save	c
some	c
money	c
.	c

Othrewise	i
,	c
there	c
are	c
people	c
who	c
think	c
the	c
opposite	c
;	i
such	c
as	c
:	c
children	c
,	c
teenagers	c
,	c
men	c
;	c
but	c
not	c
always	c
,	c
because	c
they	c
go	i
to	i
buy	i
hardly	i
ever	i
,	i
only	c
when	c
they	c
need	c
clothes	c
or	i
something	c
for	c
their	c
job	c
or	c
school	c

17th	c
June	c
2000	c

About	c
two	c
weeks	c
ago	c
,	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
London	c
for	c
a	c
week	i
holiday	c
.	c

I	c
will	c
take	c
the	c
exemple	i
of	c
the	c
use	c
of	c
the	c
internet	i
.	c

I	c
use	c
it	c
on	c
a	c
daily	c
basis	c
for	c
many	c
different	c
reasons	c
:	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
write	c
letters	c
to	c
my	c
friends	c
anymore	c
,	c
and	c
wait	c
weeks	c
before	c
receiving	c
answers	c
,	c
I	c
just	c
send	c
an	c
electronic	c
mail	c
through	i
the	c
internet	i
and	c
the	c
person	c
received	i
it	c
within	c
seconds	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
need	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
stores	c
anymore	c
,	i
if	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
want	c
to	c
:	c
I	c
can	c
just	c
stay	c
at	c
home	c
and	c
buy	c
almost	c
everything	c
through	c
it	c
:	c
books	c
,	c
video	c
tapes	c
,	c
clothes	c
and	c
even	c
groceries	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
really	c
made	i
and	c
I	c
want	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
,	i
please	i
call	c
me	c
to	i
the	c
number	c
23456789	c
,	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
waiting	c
your	i
call	c
.	c

How	c
has	c
modern	c
technology	c
changed	c
your	c
daily	c
life	c
?	c

Another	c
aspect	c
is	c
,	i
on	i
the	i
house	i
artefacts	i
,	i
microwaves	c
,	c
laundrymachine	i
,	i
make	c
life	c
easily	i
.	c

Then	c
,	c
I	c
got	c
very	c
disappointed	c
because	c
the	c
actors	c
in	c
the	c
play	c
were	c
not	c
those	c
ones	c
mentioned	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
.	c

Please	c
give	c
me	c
an	c
answer	c
.	c

We	c
cannot	c
deny	c
that	c
technology	c
has	c
changed	c
our	c
lives	c
.	c

Also	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
communicate	c
with	c
some	c
friends	c
who	c
live	c
in	c
other	c
countries	c
by	c
e-mail	c
almost	c
every	c
day	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
save	c
some	c
money	c
because	c
I	c
pay	c
for	c
a	c
local	c
call	c
,	c
and	c
not	c
for	c
an	c
international	c
call	c
.	c

Besides	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
preffer	i
to	c
stay	c
in	c
tents	i
,	c
because	c
I	c
got	c
used	c
to	c
being	c
in	c
tents	c
since	c
each	i
summer	i
I	i
spent	i
my	i
holidays	i
with	c
my	c
friends	c
at	i
the	c
hills	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

Besides	c
,	c
I	c
do	c
not	c
like	c
to	c
waste	c
my	c
time	c
just	c
seeing	i
at	c
a	c
wide	c
variety	c
of	c
products	c
,	c
that	c
make	i
you	c
feel	c
confused	c
and	i
you	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
which	c
one	i
fits	c
you	c
,	c
instead	c
of	c
being	c
with	c
my	c
friends	c
or	c
doing	c
something	c
else	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
when	c
you	c
want	c
to	c
buy	c
something	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
be	c
sure	c
of	c
what	c
you	c
really	c
need	c
,	c
if	c
not	c
the	c
shop	c
assistant	c
has	c
the	c
ability	c
to	c
persuade	c
you	c
to	c
buy	c
something	c
you	c
do	c
not	c
want	c
.	c

If	c
not	i
shopping	c
never	i
be	c
enjoyable	c
,	c
but	c
also	i
tiring	c
and	c
boring	c
.	c

MANAGER	c
,	c

MOST	i
OF	i
MY	i
DAY	i
I	i
SPEND	i
IN	c
FRONT	c
OF	c
ONE	c
OF	c
THOSE	c
MACHINES	c
,	c
STUDYING	c
,	c
RESEARCHING	c
,	c
PLAYING	c
AND	c
TALKING	c
TO	c
FRIENDS	c
ALL	c
AROUND	c
THE	c
WORLD	c
.	c

I	c
've	c
got	c
some	c
skin	c
trouble	c
and	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
sleep	c
very	c
well	c
in	c
tents	c
.	c

Whole	c
night	c
,	c
I	c
felt	c
backache	i
ands	i
shoulder	c
ache	c
so	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
sleep	c
very	c
well	c
.	c

It	c
sounds	c
wonderful	c
!	c

Especially	c
I	c
love	i
water-painting	i
.	c

It	c
will	i
be	c
fantastic	c
experience	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

Actually	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	i
swimming	i
at	c
all	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
afraid	c
of	c
water	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
this	i
chance	i
is	i
very	i
good	i
for	c
me	c
to	c
learn	c
to	c
swim	c
.	c

I	c
expect	c
to	c
join	i
above	c
two	c
activities	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
think	c
I	c
'll	c
need	c
some	c
money	c
for	i
clubing	i
or	c
evening	c
events	c
.	c

But	c
when	c
I	c
stand	c
at	i
every	c
shops	i
,	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
stand	i
my	c
desire	c
.	c

I	c
'll	c
think	c
why	i
I	c
'm	c
so	c
poor	c
.	c

I	c
can	c
try	c
every	i
shoes	i
,	c
clothes	c
,	c
hats	c
,	c
accessories	c
and	c
jakect	i
on	c
.	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
pleased	c
to	c
be	c
the	c
winer	i
in	c
your	c
competition	c
.	c

In	c
1998	c
we	c
were	c
the	c
champion	c
of	c
the	c
First	c
National	c
Leque	i
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
is	c
because	c
of	c
my	c
long	c
legs	c
.	c

What	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	i
need	c
to	c
bring	c
with	c
me	c
?	c

Novadays	i
our	c
shopping	c
habits	c
seem	c
to	c
be	i
changed	c
.	c

But	c
no	c
way	c
!	c

I	c
started	c
looking	c
for	c
the	c
food	c
products	c
written	i
on	c
the	c
paper	i
but	c
I	c
found	c
only	c
the	c
eggs	c
,	c
milk	c
and	c
bread	c
.	c

So	c
what	c
was	c
all	c
that	c
about	c
?	c
!	c

I	c
bought	c
a	c
ticket	c
for	c
the	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
musical	c
show	c
last	c
Saturday	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
felt	c
very	c
disappointed	c
with	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
really	c
expect	c
that	c
you	c
consider	i
my	c
arguments	c
and	c
cash	i
me	c
back	c
the	c
value	c
of	c
the	c
ticket	c
,	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c
.	c

For	c
a	c
shy	c
person	c
,	c
like	c
me	c
,	c
Internet	i
has	c
another	c
attractive	i
:	c
the	c
possibility	i
of	c
knowing	c
people	c
and	c
making	c
friends	c
worldwide	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
so	c
happy	c
to	c
hear	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
a	c
two	i
weeks	i
holiday	c
in	c
the	c
U.S.A	c
.	c

Also	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
join	c
basketball	i
team	c
,	i
I	c
used	c
to	c
play	c
basketball	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
in	c
high	c
school	c
,	c
and	c
our	c
high	c
school	c
basketball	c
team	c
have	i
won	c
many	c
competitions	c
during	c
last	i
ten	c
years	c
in	c
our	c
city	c
.	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

I	c
must	c
say	c
that	c
was	c
a	i
great	c
fun	c
,	i
I	i
've	i
never	c
had	c
this	c
kind	c
of	c
experience	c
before	c
.	c

During	c
the	c
concert	c
,	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
have	c
a	c
lot	c
to	c
do	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
had	c
chance	i
to	c
see	c
most	c
of	c
the	c
performance	c
,	i
that	i
was	c
excellent	c
.	c

I	c
got	i
to	c
go	c
.	c

Now	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
two	c
questions	c
about	c
camping	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Actually	c
,	c
I	c
could	c
have	c
a	c
chance	c
to	c
ask	c
her	c
about	c
music	c
,	c
her	c
favorite	i
artist	c
and	c
her	c
hobby	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
impressed	c
when	c
I	c
heard	c
that	c
she	c
liked	c
playing	i
puzzle	i
alone	c
.	c

Take	c
care	c
of	c
yourself	c
,	c
Kim	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
waiting	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
happy	c
to	c
hear	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
inform	c
you	c
about	c
my	c
requests	c
.	c

First	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
wondering	c
if	c
I	c
could	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
working	c
at	c
a	c
language	c
school	c
.	c

Due	c
to	c
a	c
shortage	c
of	c
teachers	c
in	c
summer	c
I	c
can	c
take	c
holiday	c
only	c
in	c
July	c
.	c

Second	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
sleep	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
slept	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
wanted	c
to	c
sleep	c
there	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
also	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
should	c
take	c
with	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
and	c
travelling	c
to	c
the	c
U.S.A	c
.	c

Chi	c
Kimura	c

The	c
name	c
of	c
the	c
band	c
was	c
'	c
Dream	c
Comes	c
True	c
'	c
.	c

This	c
bank	i
is	c
not	i
only	i
in	i
Japan	i
but	i
also	i
in	i
the	i
U.S.A	i
very	i
famous	i
.	c

I	c
almost	c
fainted	c
when	c
the	c
band	c
arrived	c
and	c
entered	c
the	c
stage	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
an	c
evening	c
I	c
spent	c
in	c
your	c
theatre	c
to	i
see	i
a	c
musical	c
show	c
.	c

As	c
for	c
the	c
times	i
,	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
begin	c
at	c
19.30	c
whereas	c
in	c
reality	c
it	c
began	c
at	c
20.15	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
sure	c
you	c
will	c
accept	c
my	c
request	c
;	c
if	c
not	c
I	c
intend	c
to	c
take	c
legal	c
actions	i
against	c
your	c
company	c
.	c

Because	c
of	c
his	c
behaviour	c
,	c
now	i
Pat	i
is	i
alone	c
and	c
nobody	c
trust	i
in	i
him	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
from	c
10	c
am	c
to	c
7	c
p.m.	c
,	i
it	i
is	i
about	i
the	c
latest	c
fashion	c
,	c
leisure	c
and	c
sports	c
wear	c
,	c
make	i
up	i
and	c
hairstyles	c
,	i
all	i
of	c
us	c
are	c
really	c
interesting	i
,	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
free	c
for	c
student	i
to	c
get	c
in	c
as	c
well	c
.	c

Then	c
,	c
I	c
went	c
into	c
the	c
theatre	c
on	c
time	c
but	c
became	c
a	c
little	c
bit	c
angry	c
for	i
waiting	c
until	c
20:15	c
,	c
forty-five	c
minutes	c
after	c
the	c
expected	c
starting	c
time	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

I	c
was	c
so	c
sad	c
about	c
it	c
and	c
did	c
not	c
forgive	c
Pat	c
even	c
though	c
she	c
apologise	i
for	i
thousands	c
of	c
times	c
.	c

Suddenly	c
,	c
all	c
the	i
classmates	c
applauded	c
and	c
smiled	c
to	i
me	c
with	c
respect	c
.	c

I	c
started	c
to	c
be	c
OK	c
with	c
the	i
"	c
Your	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
"	c
,	c
sure	i
not	i
to	i
be	c
deceived	c
.	c

But	c
all	i
was	c
disappointing	c
!	c

I	c
was	c
terribly	c
ennoyed	i
!	c

Yours	c
:	c

I	c
am	c
always	c
joinable	i
with	i
my	c
mobile	c
phone	c
,	c
that	i
is	c
also	c
sometimes	i
boring	i
!	c

I	c
often	c
go	c
on	c
Internet	i
to	c
find	c
informations	i
for	i
studying	c
a	c
precise	i
subject	c
more	c
accutely	i
(	c
university	c
technology	c

At	c
work	c
my	c
personal	i

have	c
a	c
student	c
card	c
for	c
discounts	c
I	c
could	c
not	c
get	c
any	c
discount	c
.	c

As	c
a	c
result	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
wait	c
over	c

I	c

Nowadays	i

has	c
increasingly	i

developing	i

Another	c
advantage	c
is	c

I	c
appreciated	i
him	c
a	c

Please	c
send	c
me	c
a	c

the	c

It	c
is	c
very	c
difficult	c
to	c
decide	c
which	c
two	c
of	c
these	c
activities	c
I	c
like	c
and	i
I	c
can	c
also	c
do	c
the	i
best	c
.	c

The	c
other	c
activity	c
I	c
like	c
very	c
muche	i
is	c
swimming	c
.	c

I	c
took	i
part	c
at	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
competitions	c

And	c
then	c
I	c
discovered	c
that	c
the	c
discounts	c
were	c
not	c
available	c
for	c
the	c
tickets	c
.	c

Modern	c
technology	c
has	c
completly	i
changed	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
,	c
which	c
became	i
more	c
comfortable	c
,	c
and	c
easier	c
.	c

Another	c
simple	c
example	c
is	c
my	c
mobile	c
telephone	c
;	c
A	c
few	c
years	c
ago	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
buy	c
a	c
telephone	c
card	c
and	c
then	c
to	c
find	c
a	c
telephone	c
box	c
to	c
call	c
my	c
parents	c
and	c
to	c
tell	c
them	c
that	c
I	c
would	c
be	c
late	c
for	c
dinner	c
,	c
or	c
other	c
stuff	c
like	c
that	c
.	c

In	i
my	i
point	i
of	i
view	i
,	c
modern	c
technology	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
thing	c
unless	c
it	c
is	c
used	c
to	c
serve	c
bad	c
intentions	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c

Make	i
up	i

Dear	c
Mr	c
Smith	c
,	c

What	c
a	c
surprise	c
!	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
young	c
when	c
this	c
story	c
happened	c
but	c
though	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
child	c
's	c
adventure	c
I	c
remember	c
it	c
yet	i
.	c

I	c
was	c
just	c
thirteen	c
years	c
old	c
!	c

The	c
highest	c
tree	c
near	c
a	c
river	c
I	c
have	c
ever	c
seen	c
.	c

We	c
could	c
play	c
hours	i
and	c
hours	c
without	c
seeing	c
an	c
adult	c
or	c
other	i
children	c
from	c
the	c
village	c
.	c

But	c
Pat	c
could	c
not	c
keep	c
it	c
too	i
long	c
.	c

He	c
had	c
a	c
fault	c
:	c
he	c
talked	c
a	c
lot	c
and	c
told	c
an	i
other	i
friend	c
our	c
story	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
whether	c
going	c
there	c
in	c
July	c
is	c
possible	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
just	c
behind	c
the	c
stage	c
.	c

I	c
even	c
saw	c
crying	c
girls	c
,	i
who	c
were	c
trying	c
to	c
reach	c
the	c
pop-singer	i
.	c

I	c
mean	c
,	c
all	c
that	i
flashing	c
lights	c
,	c
the	i
changing	i
colours	i
of	i
them	i
,	c
I	c
believe	c
they	c
helped	c
much	i
.	c

Even	c
though	c
I	c
was	c
just	c
telling	c
my	c
friend	c
what	c
the	c
next	c
composition	c
of	c
colours	c
was	c
,	c
I	c
consider	c
myself	c
being	i
very	c
successful	i
.	c

Lots	c
of	c
love	c
,	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

Last	c
week	c
I	c
spent	c
my	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
and	c
I	i
've	i
seen	i
your	c
musical	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
'	c
in	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
really	c
disappointed	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
read	c
the	c
advertisment	i
for	c
the	c
show	c
I	c
was	c
really	c
excited	c
but	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
I	c
was	c
not	c
very	c
happy	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
following	c
problems	c
.	c

You	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
shop	c
to	c
buy	c
clothes	c
or	c
to	c
the	c
restaurant	c
to	c
order	c
some	c
food	c
.	c

The	c
second	c
reason	c
is	c
the	c
weather	c
.	c

I	c
love	c
travelling	c
when	c
the	c
weather	c
is	c
warm	c
.	c

About	i
the	c
accommodation	c
,	c
I	c
'd	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
log	i
cabins	i
,	c
because	c
for	i
me	i
and	i
my	i
family	i
's	i
more	i
comfortable	i
.	c

I	c
have	c
a	c
baby	c
and	c
three	c
dogs	c
,	c
so	c
it	c
should	c
be	c
better	c
in	c
log	i
cabins	i
.	c

May	c
I	c
have	c
a	c
babysitter	c
?	c

Let	c
me	c
say	c
still	i
thank	i
you	i
.	c

How	c
are	c
you	c
?	c

I	c
'm	c
sorry	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
write	c
you	i
before	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
was	c
so	c
busy	c
with	c
my	c
exams	c
.	c

The	c
group	c
needs	i
to	c
found	i
a	c
good	c
microphone	c
for	c
the	c
concert	c
,	c
because	c
the	c
singer	c
lost	c
his	c
microphone	c
last	c
concert	c
.	c

The	c
concert	c
was	c
absolutely	c
fantastic	c
.	c

Ok	i
,	c
write	c
me	i
soon	c
,	c
huge	c
hug	c
and	c
kisses	c

The	i
Price	i
of	i
the	i
ticket	i
was	i
said	i
that	i
there	i
would	i
be	i
discounts	i
available	i
.	c

With	i
all	c
the	c
above	c
points	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
for	c
some	c
money	c
return	i
.	c

I	c
think	c
people	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
will	c
likely	i
to	i
wear	i
helmets	c
with	c
oxygen	i
gas	i
well	i
provided	i
.	c

The	c
future	c
is	c
a	i
hope	c
and	c
a	i
dream	c
for	c
everyone	c
in	i

Dear	c
Miss	c
Ryan	c
,	c

Indeed	i
,	i
my	i
wife	c
is	c
afraid	c
of	c
sleeping	c
in	c
tents	c
.	c

If	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
chose	i
an	i
other	i
activity	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
I	c
would	c
do	c
Photography	i
.	c

In	c
fact	c
,	c
this	c
activity	c
seems	c
to	c
be	c
very	c
interresting	i
.	c

I	c
thank	c
you	c
again	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

After	c
having	c
thought	c
about	c
this	c
video	c
and	c
asked	c
different	i
people	c
so	c
as	c
to	c
know	c
what	c
they	c
suggested	c
,	c
I	c
reached	c
the	c
following	c
conclusions	c
:	c
we	c
must	c
film	c
the	c
lessons	c
which	c
are	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
and	c
the	c
activities	c
which	c
take	c
a	i
great	c
part	c
in	i
a	c
day	c
at	c
school	c
;	c
this	c
being	c
in	c
three	c
parts	c
.	c

Hope	c
to	c
hear	c
from	c
you	c
:	c

Dear	c
Miss	c
Ryan	c
.	i

As	c
you	c
said	c
I	c
will	c
have	c
the	c
opportunity	c
to	c
do	c
two	c
activities	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

It	c
is	c
not	c
,	c
however	c
,	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
that	i
there	c
are	c
both	c
advantages	c
and	c
disadvantages	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
shop	i
owner	i
often	c
cheat	c
their	c
customers	c
by	c
increasing	c
the	c
cost	c
secreatly	i
.	c

Dear	c
Ms	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
very	i
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
going	c
to	c
California	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
in	c
July	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
going	c
to	c
have	c
my	c
summer	c
holidays	c
in	c
that	c
month	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
wondering	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
wear	c
in	c
California	c
?	c

Yours	c
Sincerely	c

I	c
looked	c
at	c
him	c
and	c
I	c
realised	c
that	c
this	c
person	c
was	c
David	c
Bowie	c
.	c

I	c
thought	c
he	c
was	c
very	c
rude	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
was	c
wrong	c
,	c
he	c
is	c
n't	c
arrogant	c
at	c
all	c
and	c
he	c
looks	c
very	c
simply	i
.	c

Write	c
me	i
soon	c
and	c
take	c
care	c
.	c

In	c
September	c
my	c
school	c
starts	c
a	c
new	c
study	c
year	c
.	c

You	c
ofer	i
me	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
activities	c
.	c

I	c
've	c
got	i
also	i
two	c
questions	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
glad	c
you	c
're	c
doing	c
well	c
.	c

I	c
gave	c
information	c
about	c
correct	c
ways	c
to	c
another	i
places	c
like	c
tooletes	i
and	c
medical	c
points	c
.	c

OK	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
making	c
my	c
dream	c
come	c
true	c

You	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
to	c
be	c
bored	c
with	c
the	c
same	c
old	c
things	c
.	c

Unfortunetley	i
I	c
am	c
not	c
good	c
at	c
both	i
of	c
them	c
.	c

The	c
waterfall	c
made	i
by	i
real	c
rock	c
so	c
that	c
was	c
the	c
worst	c
bit	c
because	c
they	i
were	i
really	c
heavy	c
and	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
carry	c
them	i
,	c
but	c
the	i
end	c
of	c
moth	i
when	c
the	c
concert	c
started	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
all	c
over	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
lots	c
of	c
memory	i
which	c
I	c
could	c
never	c
forget	c
.	c

Dear	c
Jane	c
Clark	c

However	c
,	c
according	c
to	c
my	c
notes	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
some	c
doubt	i
in	i
the	c
festival	c
.	c

The	c
number	c
of	c
plays	c
and	c
films	c
were	i
also	c
very	c
few	i
.	c

We	c
're	c
also	c
not	c
allowed	c
to	c
get	c
part-time	c
jobs	c
.	c

If	c
possible	c
,	c
I	c
want	c

According	i
to	i
your	c

First	c

I	c
must	c

I	c
only	c
have	c
freetime	i
in	c
July	c
at	i
any	c
day	c
,	c
any	c
week	c
,	i
because	c
I	c
am	c
still	c
having	c
my	c
lesson	i
at	c
college	c
and	c
it	i
will	c
be	c
finished	c
at	c
the	c
end	c
of	c

and	i
also	c
in	c
August	c
I	c
have	c
a	c
training	c
course	c
for	c
my	c
studies	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
tents	c
because	c
I	c
love	c
atmosephere	i
of	c
camping	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
would	c
n't	c
mind	c
to	i
stay	i
in	c
log	c
cabins	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

It	c
is	c
base	i
on	c
information	c
made	c
availble	i
by	c
student	i
from	c
each	c
class	c
at	c
school	c

It	c
felt	i
to	c
be	c
a	c
good	c
memory	c
to	c
be	c
remember	i
and	c
remind	i
our	i
sleves	i
to	c
speak	c
in	c
a	c
correct	c
way	c

This	c
lesson	c
will	c

Activities	c

Spending	c
time	c
together	c
out	c
of	c
the	c
class	c
is	c
the	i
nice	c
experiance	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
studying	c
Economics	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
busy	c
nowadays	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
get	c
the	i
camp	c
,	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
swim	c
and	c
climb	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
fond	c
of	c
swimming	c
but	c
unfortunately	c
I	c
am	c
not	c
a	c
good	c
swimmer	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

They	c
signed	c
my	c
diary	c
and	c
took	i
a	i
photo	i
with	c
me	c

Being	c
a	c
security	c
guard	c
was	c
the	c
hardest	c
task	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
n't	c
believe	c
my	c
eyes	i
.	c

I	c
was	c
in	c
her	c
room	c
and	i
helping	c
her	c
.	c

I	c
advise	c
you	c
to	c
do	c
something	c
like	c
that	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c

I	c
like	i
to	c
answer	c
the	c
questions	c
you	c
request	i
from	i
me	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
should	c
say	c
that	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
of	i
this	i
is	c
the	c
month	c
wich	i
I	c
could	c
more	i
likely	c
have	c
off	c
at	i
work	c
for	i
going	i
on	c
holiday	c
.	c

That	c
is	c
because	c
I	i
do	c
not	c
want	c
to	c
seem	c
fuzy	i
but	i
I	c
like	c
to	c
have	c
some	c
comodities	i
when	c
I	c
am	c
going	c
on	c
holiday	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
slepping	i
over	i
the	c
floor	c
without	c
electricity	c
it	i
may	c
annoy	c
me	c
.	c

On	i
the	i
other	i
hand	i
,	i
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
some	c
imformation	i
wich	i
could	c
be	c
useful	c
in	i
my	c
holiday	c
like	c
:	c
which	i
type	c
of	c
clothes	c
could	i
be	c
more	c
suitable	c
for	c
me	c
in	c
the	c
Camp	c
?	c

Could	c
I	c
need	c
some	c
extra	c
money	c
?	c

lots	c
of	c
love	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

It	c
seem	i
be	i
incredible	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
's	c
commun	i
habits	i
for	c
us.	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
to	c
this	c
,	c
thinking	i
also	i
,	i
to	i
the	i
medicine	i
,	i
science	i
or	i
astronomy	i
progress	i
...	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
suggest	c
some	c
idea	i
for	c
the	c
International	c
Art	i
Festival	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

Fourthly	c
,	c
everyone	c
seems	c
to	c
have	c
enjoyed	c
seeing	c
dance	i
shows	c
and	c
the	c
art	c
exhibitions	c
and	c
listening	c
to	c
the	c
talks	c
.	c

I	c
suggest	c
you	c
have	c
a	c
oneday	i
ticket	c
or	c
a	c
reasonable	i
ticket	c
for	c
every	c
event	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
be	c
grateful	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
think	c
about	c
it	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
girls	c
must	c
keep	c
the	c
length	c
of	c
the	i
skirt	i
by	i
5	c
cm	c
under	i
their	c
knees	c
.	c

It	c
does	c
n't	c
bother	i
studying	c
,	c
does	c
it	c
?	c

I	c
know	c
some	c
rules	c
are	c
necessary	c
to	c
control	c
the	c
students	c
.	c

You	c
're	c
allowed	c
to	c
do	c
that	c
,	c
are	c
n't	c
you	c
?	c

How	c
much	c
money	c
do	c
I	c
need	c
?	c

"	c
Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
"	c

There	c
are	c
new	c
products	c
which	c
you	c
could	c
not	c
imagine	c
that	i
could	c
be	c
so	c
interesting	c
.	c

Shopping	c
is	c
a	c
good	c
way	c
to	c
kill	c
your	i
time	c
and	c
some	i
times	i
you	c
can	i
not	c
realize	c
how	c
fast	c
the	c
time	c
goes	c
.	c

You	c
go	i
shopping	i
in	c
a	c
big	c
supermarket	c
because	c
you	c
know	c
you	c
will	c
find	c
everything	c
there	c
and	c
you	c
need	c
15	c
minutes	c
to	c
find	c
the	c
goods	c
and	c
20	c
minutes	c
to	c
pay	c
for	c
them	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
big	c
queue	c
.	c

Otherwise	c
If	i
you	c
are	c
in	c
a	c
good	c
mood	c
it	c
will	c
turn	c
into	c
a	c
bad	c
mood	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
afraid	c
I	c
can	c
only	c
make	c
it	c
on	i
July	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
taking	c
exams	c
this	c
month	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
I	c
'll	c
prepare	c
everything	c
for	c
going	c
to	c
University	c
on	i
August	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
no	c
time	c
until	c
Christmas	c
.	c

I	c
started	c
climbing	c
since	i
I	c
was	c
a	c
child	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
play	c
basketball	c
with	c
local	c
people	c
at	c
the	c
Camp	c
to	c
see	c
how	c
good	c
they	c
are	c
,	c
if	c
I	c
can	c

If	c
you	c
have	c
problem	i
on	i
studing	i
,	c
asking	i
teachers	i
is	i
the	c
best	c
way	c

I	c
'm	c
also	c
fond	c
of	c
tennis	c

I	c
've	c
just	c
started	c
my	c
lessons	c

would	c

I	c
'm	c
not	c

sure	c
of	i
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
to	c
take	c
,	i
could	i
you	c
please	c

to	c

I	c

Diana	c
Delgado	c

They	c
had	c
invited	c
us	c
and	c
we	c
wanted	c
them	c
to	c
see	c
us	c
stunningly	i
beautiful	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
so	c
annoyed	c
!	c

My	c
friends	c
lent	c
me	c
some	c
money	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
more	c
than	c
120	c
pounds	c
.	c

I	c
felt	c
really	c
bad	c
seeing	c
my	c
friends	c
buy	c
the	c
latest	c
fashion	c
while	c
the	c
only	c
thing	c
I	c
could	c
do	c
was	c
tell	c
them	c
how	c
great	c
their	c
clothes	c
were	c
and	c
of	c
course	c
window-shop	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
take	c
part	c
in	c

and	c
swimming	c
please	c

How	c
big	c
is	c
the	c
camp	c
?	c

Shopping	c
can	c
be	c
very	c
exciting	c
and	c
fun	c
.	c

The	c
feeling	c
of	c
buying	c
new	c
things	c
is	c
wonderful	c
.	c

But	c
it	c
might	c
not	c
be	c
the	c
same	c
everytime	i
.	c

So	c
buying	c
things	i
neccessary	i
is	c
fine	c
I	c
think	c
.	c

But	c
buying	c
things	c
that	c
do	i
not	c
need	c
or	c
you	c
have	c
not	c
planned	c
to	c
might	c
make	c
you	c
feel	c
good	c
at	c
the	c
time	c
,	c
but	c
days	c
or	c
weeks	c
later	c
when	c
you	c
realise	c
you	c
did	c
not	c
need	c
to	c
spend	c
money	c
on	c
them	c
,	c
you	c
might	c
regret	c
buying	c
them	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
you	c
did	c
not	c
plan	c
to	c
buy	c
any	c
crisps	c
,	c
but	c
they	c
are	c
at	c
half	c
price	c
and	c
you	c
buy	c
them	c
without	c
thinking	c

I	c
'm	c
Francesco	c

I	c
'm	c
18	c
years	c
old	c
and	c
I	c
went	c
last	c
week	c
to	c
see	c
your	c
musical	c
show	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
.	c

First	c
the	c
actor	c
was	c
changed	c
and	c
his	c
performance	i
was	c
very	c
poor	c
and	c
disappointing	c
.	c

The	c
computer	c
for	c
example	c
makes	c
communication	c
much	c
easier	c
and	c
faster	c
then	i
in	c
past	i
time	i
,	c
when	c
everything	c
was	c
send	i
by	c
common	i
mail	c
,	c
and	c
it	c
took	i
weeks	c
till	c
it	c
got	c
the	i
right	c
place	c
.	c

There	c
are	c
other	c
machines	c
which	c
are	c
bad	c
for	c
the	c
environment	c
.	c

Now	c
,	c
I	c
will	c
answer	c
your	c
requests	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
tents	i
because	c
since	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
child	c
I	c
have	c
being	i
using	c
this	c
type	c
of	c
accommodation	c

Finally	c
let	c
me	c
know	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
will	c
be	c
the	c
most	c
suitable	c
at	c
camp	c

It	c
began	c
when	c
ours	i
common	i
friends	i
Martha	c
,	i
ofered	i
me	c
to	i
be	i
a	i
organization	i
member	i
at	i
the	c
concert	c
,	i
obviously	i
I	c
accepted	c
.	c

Particularly	i
I	i
am	i
pleased	c
to	c
had	i
know	i
the	c
most	c
popular	c
pop	c
stars	c
in	c
the	c
world	c

When	c
I	c
bought	c
my	c

I	c
expected	c
to	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
take	c
advantage	c
of	c
those	c
discounts	c
you	c
announced	c
in	c
the	c

but	c
when	i
I	c
had	c
to	c
pay	c
the	c
most	c
expensive	c
price	c

I	c
went	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
performance	i
at	i
19:30	i
but	c
it	c
did	c
not	c
start	c
until	c
20:15	c

was	c
when	c

While	c
Pat	c
was	c
talking	c
she	c
remembered	c
playing	c
with	c
her	c
dolls	c
and	c
spending	i
a	c
good	c
time	c
with	c
them	c
.	c

Everybody	c
laughted	i
at	c
her	c
.	c

Two	c
weeks	c
later	c
everybody	c
forbade	i
about	c
Marion	c
's	c
secret	c
and	c
she	c
took	i
into	i
account	i
her	c
relationship	c
with	c
Pat	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
only	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
I	c
will	c
take	i
some	c
hollydays	i
at	c
this	i
time	c
.	c

.	c

How	c
much	c
money	c
would	c
like	i
to	c
pay	c
me	c
for	c
five	i
hours	i
a	i
day	i
in	i
two	i
weeks	i
working	i
with	i
children	i
?	c

The	c
students	c
at	c
school	c
shoud	c
n't	c
be	c
shy	c
,	c
because	c
they	i
have	i
estercotipie	i
inside	i
in	i
some	i
issues	i
,	i
that	i
confuses	i
them	i
the	i
means	i
of	i
things	i
.	c

I	c
hope	c
so	i
to	c
be	c
producer	i
of	c
shows	c
,	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c

Some	c
people	c
when	c
they	c
are	c
tired	c
relax	c
spleeping	i
,	c
reading	c
a	c
book	c
or	c
watching	c
television	c
but	i
not	c
me	c
.	c

In	c
these	c
periods	c
of	c
the	c
year	c
,	c
the	c
supermarkets	c
and	c
the	c
shops	c
are	c
full	c
of	c
stressed	c
adults	c
and	c
tired	c
children	c
trying	i
to	i
walk	i
in	c
a	c
warm	i
and	c
noisy	c
place	c
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
know	c
when	c
and	c
where	c
to	c
shop	c
quietly	c
but	c
in	c
my	c
opinion	c
spending	c
money	c
in	c
a	c
crowded	c
shop	c
is	c
the	c
most	c
enjoyable	c
thing	c
in	c
the	c
world	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
if	c
the	c
musical	i
show	c
will	i
begin	i
later	c
the	c
restaurant	c
should	c
close	c
later	c
,	c
too	c
!	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

Dear	c
Manager	c
,	c

The	c
show	c
should	c
start	i
at	c
19.30	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
did	c
n't	c
start	c
until	c
20.15	c
!	c

Karol	c
Johannes	c

For	c
example	c
TV	i
,	c
telephone	c
,	c
micrown	i
etc.	c
But	c
the	i
last	c
few	c
years	c
,	c
it	i
has	c
change	i
and	c
so	c
many	c
new	c
important	c
things	c
had	i
been	c
discovered	i
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
the	c
play	c
started	c
45	c
minutes	c
later	i
.	c

I	c
felt	c
so	c
angry	c
about	c
that	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
the	c
actor	c
was	c
n't	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
.	c

But	c
she	c
was	c
in	c
love	c
with	c
a	c
black	c
man	c
,	c
called	c
Jim	c
.	c

And	c
Pat	c
,	c
the	c
maid	c
,	c
saw	c
them	c
in	c
the	c
river	c
.	c

She	c
could	c
n't	c
keep	c
the	c
secret	c
and	c
told	c
everything	c
to	c
another	c
maid	c
.	c

(	c
If	c
she	c
had	c
n't	c
do	i
it	c
,	c
Lorca	c
's	c
father	c
would	c
had	i
made	i
the	c
same	c
)	c
.	c

Pat	c
and	c
Jim	c
's	c
wife	c
lived	c
with	c
the	c
guilty	i
all	c
their	c
long	c
lives	c
.	c

Second	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
rather	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
tend	c
to	c
get	c
very	c
nervous	c
in	c
small	c
closed	c
places	c
,	c
so	c
a	c
tent	c
would	c
be	c
unapropriate	i
for	c
me	c
.	c

Also	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
if	c
I	c
will	c
need	c
any	c
money	c
there	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerately	i
,	c

Hi	c
!	c

Suddenly	c
,	c
everything	c
got	c
very	c
dark	c
.	c

Bye	c
!	c
see	c
you	c
soon	c
,	c

However	c
the	i
evening	c
become	i
very	c
disappointing	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
start	c
19.30	i
,	c
but	c
did	c
not	c
start	c
until	c
20.15	c
.	c

Above	i
these	i
the	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
of	c
water	i
leakage	i
.	c

Adra	c
Johansson	c

She	c
really	c
listen	i
to	c
me	c
and	c
told	c
me	c
that	c
I	c
did	i
the	c
right	c
thing	c
and	c
persuaded	c
me	c
to	c
send	c
in	c
my	c
application	c
for	i
an	i
language	c
course	c
in	c
England	c
.	c

I	c
wanted	c
to	c
keep	c
this	c
as	i
a	c
secret	c
until	c
I	c
received	c
the	c
answer	c
from	c
the	c
School	c
.	c

Hello	i
Helen	c
,	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
should	i
I	i
bring	c
and	c
wether	i
I	c
can	c
wash	c
it	i
or	c
not	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
will	i
I	i
need	c
for	c
extras	c
?	i

Thirdly	c
I	c
chose	c
photography	c
and	c
swimming	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
previous	c
experience	c
in	c
these	c
activities	c
and	c
of	c
course	c
I	c
have	c
some	c
diplomas	c
which	c
I	c
will	c
send	c
you	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
receiving	c
a	c
prompt	c
reply	c
.	c

Hello	c
it	i
's	c
been	c
ages	c
since	c
we	c
were	c
in	c
touch	c
,	i
I	c
'm	c
sorry	c
I	c
have	c
n't	c
written	c
to	c
you	c
for	c
such	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
but	c
I	c
have	i
been	i
very	c
busy	c
last	c
month	c
,	c
with	c
this	c
job	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
that	c
this	c
experience	c
was	c
wonderful	c
and	c
in	c
fact	c
I	c
enjoyed	c
a	i
lot	c
and	c
of	c
course	c
I	c
knew	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
people	c
there	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
I	c
found	c
it	i
very	i
short	i
time	i
and	c
they	c
offered	c
me	c
new	i
project	c
for	c
the	c
summer	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
the	c
actor	c
was	c
the	c
same	c
since	i
last	c
semester	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

Then	c
I	c
told	c
her	c
about	c
my	c
first	c
kiss	c
(	c
it	c
was	c
terrible	c
,	c
the	c
guy	c
did	c
n't	c
know	c
how	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
)	c
and	c
things	c
like	c
that	c
.	c

Cracow	c

I	c
've	c
already	c
decided	c
when	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
take	c
a	c
part	c
at	c
The	c
Camp	c
California	c
in	c
USA	c
.	c

On	i
June	c
and	c
August	c
,	c
so	c
that	c
's	c
the	c
only	c
time	c
when	c
I	c
can	c
travel	c
there	c
.	c

These	c
are	c
my	c
favorite	i
because	c
they	c
have	c
a	c
lot	c
to	c
do	c
with	c
water	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
like	c
them	c
more	c
than	c
surfing	c
.	c

Please	c
answer	c

In	i
these	i
days	i
people	c
prefere	i
shopping	c
at	c
supermarkets	c
than	i
at	c
shops	c
or	c
even	c
shopping	c
areas	i
,	c
because	c
shopping	c
at	c
shop	i
is	c
less	c
enjoyable	c
and	c
you	c
spent	i
the	c
same	c
amount	c
of	c
money	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
replying	c
to	c
your	c
letter	c
for	i
the	c
first	c
prize	c
of	i
the	c
competition	c
,	i
that	c
I	c
won	c
and	c
there	c
are	c
a	c
number	c
of	c
thinks	i
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
make	c
clear	c
.	c

You	c
asked	c
me	c
in	c
your	c
last	c
letter	c
when	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
the	c
best	c
time	c
is	c
the	c
first	c
two	c
weeks	c
of	c
July	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
free	c
then	c
.	c

Last	c
year	c
I	c
entered	c
a	c
swimming	c
championship	c
and	c
won	c
the	c
silver	c
medal	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
know	c
,	c
I	c
helped	c
at	i
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
last	c
month	c
.	i

and	c
I	c
must	c
say	c
it	c
was	c
fantastic	c
.	c

I	c
saw	c
all	c
the	c
pop	c
stars	c
,	c
talked	c
with	c
them	c
and	c
realized	c
that	c
they	c
are	c
very	c
nice	c
and	c
always	c
helpful	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
to	c
look	c
after	c
the	c
tone	i
that	i
nothing	i
goes	i
wrong	i
.	c

But	c
helping	c
in	i
a	c
concert	c
is	c
much	c
nicer	c
.	c

At	c
the	c
end	c
I	c
realized	c
that	c
all	c
your	i
need	c
is	c
co-operation	c
and	c
do	i
n't	i
think	c
selfishly	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
nice	c
to	c
try	c
it	c
at	c
least	c
once	c
.	c

Concerning	c
the	c
proposed	c
activities	c
please	i
,	c
accept	i
me	i
for	c
Singing	c
and	c
Painting	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

But	c
,	c
as	c
I	c
said	c
,	c
the	c
whole	c
thing	c
was	c
fun	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
sure	c
you	c
are	c
jalous	i
now	c
.	c

Then	c
I	c
'll	c
have	c
holiday	i
which	c
finish	i
in	c
August	c
.	c

I	c
prefer	c
to	c
live	i
in	c
log	i
cabin	c
because	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
's	c
more	c
comfortable	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
really	c
great	c
that	c
you	c
can	c
suggest	c
how	c
to	c
spend	c
the	c
rest	c
time	i
,	c
because	c
I	c
enjoy	c
swimming	c
and	c
it	c
does	c
n't	c
matter	c
where	c
in	i
the	c
lake	c
or	c
swimming-pool	i
.	c

Would	c
you	c
send	c
me	c
your	c
answer	c
as	c
fast	i
as	c
it	c
possible	i
.	c

Hi	c
,	c
Kim	c
!	c

We	c
have	c
a	c
good	c
and	c
rich	c
sponsor	c
,	i
that	i
's	i
why	c
we	c
could	c
buy	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
different	c
materials	c
with	c
different	c
colours	c
and	c
we	c
tried	c
to	c
be	c
polite	c
with	c
actors	c
even	c
if	c
they	c
did	c
n't	c
want	c
to	c
wear	c
that	c
part	i
of	c
cloth	i
which	c
we	c
thought	c
was	c
more	i
similar	i
to	i
their	c
style	c
.	c

We	c
always	c
explained	c
them	i
and	c
at	i
the	i
end	i
they	c
agreed	c
with	c
us	c
.	c

I	c
'll	c
be	c
waiting	c
for	c
your	c
answer	c

From	i
August	c

in	i
fact	i
,	c
I	c
will	c
start	c

I	c
will	c
not	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
live	i
Rome	c

a	c

I	c
am	c

from	c
you	c

However	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
a	c
few	c
moments	i
in	i
which	i
you	c
cannot	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
past	c
it	c
was	c
impossible	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
Paris	c
from	c
Barcelona	c
and	c
come	c
back	c
in	c
one	c
day	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
back	i
to	c
tell	c
you	c
that	c
I	c
am	c
happy	c
to	c
accept	c
this	c
prize	c
and	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
some	c
further	c
information	c
that	c
you	c
need	c
from	c
me	c
.	c

If	c
it	c
's	c
possible	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
on	i
July	c
because	c
of	c
my	c
job	c
.	c

As	c
I	c
see	c
I	c
have	c
the	c
chance	c
to	c
choose	c
what	i
accommodation	c
I	c
prefer	c
.	i

It	i
's	i
incredible	i
the	i
large	i
list	i
of	i
interesting	i
activities	i
that	i
you	i
offer	i
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Luna	c
Juarez	c
.	c

I	c
mean	c
that	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
wait	c
until	c
the	c
seller	i
came	i
to	c
know	c
if	c
he	c
or	c
she	c
is	c
going	c
to	c
drive	c
you	c
crazy	c
.	c

At	i
last	i
but	i
not	i
at	i
least	i
let	c
me	c
give	c
you	c
some	c
advice	c
try	i
not	c
to	c
go	c
with	c
that	c
friend	c
of	c
yours	c
that	i
is	c
crazy	c
about	c
clothes	c
and	c
shoes	c
because	c
she	c
wants	c
you	c
to	c
be	c
like	c
her	c
and	c
that	c
will	i
be	c
awful	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
exciting	i
.	c

Lastly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
about	c
the	c
money	c
and	c
clothes	c
.	c

Is	c
it	c
hot	c
or	c
raining	c
?	c

Many	c
thanks	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
very	i
important	c
thing	c
for	c
our	c
life	c
.	c

We	c
need	c
food	c
,	c
clothes	c
,	c
book	i
etc.	c
There	c
are	c
many	c
kinds	c
of	c
thing	i
for	i
shopping	c
and	c
they	c
are	c
different	c
for	i
example	c
the	c
price	c
,	c
the	c
quality	c

We	c
could	c
buy	c
mostly	i
all	c
we	c
need	c
in	c
one	c
store	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
easy	c
.	c

Sometime	i
,	c
it	i
's	i
so	c
many	c
people	c
and	c
they	c
are	c
not	c
friendly	c
at	c
all	c
or	c
you	c
are	c
hurry	i
while	c
you	c
are	c
in	c
the	i
long	c
queu	i
.	c

It	c
would	c
not	c
enjoyable	i
for	c
you	c
.	c

We	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
if	c
there	c
is	c
any	c
chance	c
to	i
get	i
our	c
money	c
back	c
of	i
or	c
if	c
you	c
can	c
offer	c
any	c
other	c
alternative	c
for	i
our	i
convenience	i
?	c

We	c
are	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Dear	c
Tim	c
,	c

As	c
you	c
know	c
we	c
have	c
already	c
had	c
several	c
discussions	c
about	c
literature	c
and	c
what	c
it	c
can	c
tell	c
or	c
teach	c
us	c
.	c

One	c

I	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
,	c

I	c
was	c
interested	c
in	c
an	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
really	c
love	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
such	c
a	c
wonderful	c
story	c
that	c
I	c
remember	c
the	c
old	c
man	c
speaking	c
about	c
human	c
's	c
life	c
between	c
the	c
sea	c
and	c
the	c
man	c
.	c

Last	c
week	c
I	c
was	c
on	c
holiday	c
at	i
London	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
dissappointed	i
when	c
I	c
visited	c
your	c
theatre	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
the	i
show	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
start	c
at	c
19.30	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
delayed	c
untill	i
20.15	c
,	c
and	c
when	c
the	c
show	c
finally	c
began	c
we	c
were	c
supriced	i
to	c
see	c
that	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
who	i
was	c
the	c
star	c
of	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
was	c
not	c
playing	c
and	c
someone	c
else	c
had	c
replace	i
him	c
and	c
he	c
was	c
really	c
disappointing	c
.	c

The	c
big	c
secret	c
was	c
that	c
Anna	c
was	c
prearing	i
a	c
suprice	i
party	c
for	c
her	c
brother	c
,	i
John	c
and	c
she	c
did	c
n't	c
want	c
anyone	c
to	c
know	c
about	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
n't	c
help	c
it	c
!	c
,	i
I	c
'm	c
so	c
sorry	c
!	c
"	c

I	c
've	c
never	c
done	c
it	c
before	c
.	c

Is	i
shopping	i
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
,	c
is	c
it	c
?	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
good	c
shopping	c
depends	c
on	c
ourself	i
.	c

Especially	c
now	c
,	c
when	c
'	c
big-mouth	c
'	c
Pat	c
spread	i
the	c
news	c
to	c
litterally	i
everyone	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
n't	c
be	c
surprised	c
if	c
suddenly	c
something	c
bad	c
happened	c
to	c
me	c
.	c

Therefore	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
escape	c
.	c

What	c
I	c
've	c
learned	c
from	c
this	c
situation	c
is	c
to	c
never	c
trust	c
people	c
again	c
.	c

You	c
should	c
remember	c
about	c
this	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
glad	c
for	i
my	c
first	c
place	c
in	c
the	c
competition	c
,	i
I	c
am	c
going	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
the	i
things	c
that	c
you	c
ask	c
me	c
on	i
your	c
letter	c
.	c

Do	c
I	c
need	c
some	c
money	c
?	c
and	c
if	c
it	i
is	i
so	c
,	c
how	c
much	c
?	c

Suppose	c
you	c
go	c
shopping	c
with	c
your	c
girlfriend	c
,	c
that	c
means	c
that	c
you	c
will	c
have	c
to	c
spend	c
hours	c
walking	c
behind	c
her	c
from	c
one	c
shop	c
to	c
another	c
and	c
during	c
the	c
time	c
that	c
she	c
is	c
trying	c
the	c
items	c
on	c
,	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
bear	c
with	i
the	c
odds	c
faces	c
of	c
the	c
other	c
women	c
looking	c
at	c
you	c
as	c
if	c
you	c
were	c
an	c
alien	c
into	i
their	c
territory	c
.	c

There	c
is	c
as	i
well	c
the	i
struggle	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
endure	c
when	c
you	c
find	c
yourself	c
into	i
the	c
crowds	c
crambled	i
in	c
the	c
small	c
shops	c
during	c
the	c
unique	i
day-off	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
buy	c
somthing	i
you	c
like	c
.	c

If	c
I	c
can	c
choose	c
accommodation	i
I	c
prefer	i
log	i
cabins	i
,	c
because	c
when	c
I	c
've	c
been	c
in	i
Camps	i
,	i
it	c
always	c
has	c
been	c
in	c
tents	c
,	c
then	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
change	c
and	c
try	c
this	c
other	c
kind	c
of	c
accommodation	c
.	c

Everyone	i
are	i
very	c
interesting	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
wondering	c
which	i
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
we	c
need	c
and	c
what	c
about	c
money	c
and	c
meals	c
,	i
Are	c
they	c
provided	c
?	c
or	i
can	c
we	c
find	c
some	c
places	c
to	c
buy	c
it	i
?	c

SHOPPING	c
IS	c
NOT	c
ALWAYS	c
ENJOYABLE	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
shopping	c
is	c
a	c
subject	i
really	i
up	i
to	i
date	i
.	c

Otherwise	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

Another	c
common	c
problem	c
could	c
be	c
the	c
long	c
queue	c
in	c
the	c
fitting	c
rooms	c
waiting	i
stand	i
up	c
for	c
your	c
turn	c
.	c

Or	c
to	i
whom	i
it	i
main	i
concern	i
:	c

I	c
am	c
writting	i
to	c
you	c
because	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
very	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
at	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
.	c

This	c
really	c
disappoint	i
me	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
both	c
hungry	c
and	c
angry	c
.	c

Well	c
first	c
of	c
all	c
Pat	i
was	c
a	c
very	c
friend	i
of	c
mine	c
.	c

With	c
nothing	c
to	c
lose	c
,	c
at	c
all	c
,	c
but	c
on	c
the	c
contrary	c
,	c
with	c
a	c
lot	c
to	c
learn	c
from	i
.	c

He	c
was	c
a	c
very	c
handsome	c
and	c
good	i
looking	i
boy	c
.	c

But	c
far	i
from	i
that	i
,	c
he	c
was	c
a	c
very	c
kind	c
person	c
.	c

As	c
Pat	c
was	c
lossing	i
his	c
patience	c
,	c
he	c
decided	c
to	c
talk	c
to	c
him	c
.	c

But	c
on	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
I	c
will	c
never	c
trust	c
in	i
Pat	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
on	i
July	c
because	c
I	c
will	c
I	i
have	c
finished	c
my	c
exams	c
by	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
June	c
.	c

Love	c

People	c
have	i
been	i
started	c
to	c
complain	c
.	c

I	c
did	c
not	c
expect	c
these	c
problems	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
waiting	c
your	i
answer	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c
.	c

When	c
Pat	c
heart	i
the	c
good	c
news	c
he	c
told	c
to	i
Brian	c
to	c
asked	i
her	c
in	i
date	i
and	c
he	c
knew	c
that	c
she	c
will	i
accepted	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
unexpected	c
evening	c
I	c
had	c
when	c
I	c
went	c

see	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
"	c
in	c
your	c
theatre	c

This	c
was	c
another	c
disappointing	c
thing	c
of	i
that	c
evening	c
.	c

But	c
my	c
complain	i
does	c
not	c
finish	c
here	c
.	c

Definetely	i
,	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
my	c
perfect	c
evening	c
at	c
all	c
and	c
under	c
these	c
circumstances	c
I	c
really	c
believe	c
you	c

give	c
me	c
my	c
money	c
back	c

My	c

of	c

presented	c
to	c

Expecting	c
the	i
britan	i
pontuality	i
we	i
went	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
at	c
19:00	c
to	c
wath	i
the	c
19:30	c
section	i
but	c
it	c
only	c
starts	i
at	c
20:15	c
,	i
it	i
finished	c
later	c
than	c
it	c
was	c
suposed	i
to	c
and	c
then	c
we	c
missed	c
the	c
train	c
.	c

I	c
have	i
n't	i
seen	i
any	c
discounts	c
available	c
,	i
I	c
though	i
my	c
son	c
would	c
payed	i
less	c
than	c
I.	c
As	c
we	c
had	c
alredy	i
missed	c
the	c
first	c
we	i
went	c
at	i
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
that	i
is	c
famous	c
for	c
the	i
good	c
food	c
,	c
however	c
it	i
was	c
closed	c
.	c

Clothes	c
that	i
used	c
to	c
be	c
made	c
of	c
coton	i
,	c
but	c
nowadays	c
we	c
can	c
see	c
shirts	c
,	c
pants	c
socks	i
....	c
made	c
of	c
almost	c
everything	i
.	c

It	c
already	i
started	i
and	c
do	i
n't	i
have	i
limites	i
to	i
go	i
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
my	c
boss	c
wo	c
n't	c
let	c
me	c
free	i
in	c
August	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
a	c
good	c
swimmer	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
in	c
the	c
Californian	c
See	i
.	c

On	i
the	i
contrary	i
,	c
I	c
'm	c
an	c
absolute	c
beginner	c
in	i
playing	c
tennis	c
and	c
I	c
'm	c
not	c
fit	c
in	i
running	c
but	c
I	c
chose	c
it	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
sport	c
I	c
've	c
always	c
wanted	c
to	c
learn	c
BUT	c
I	c
'VE	c
NEVER	c
HAD	c
enough	c
free	c
time	c
.	c

Should	c
I	c
bring	c
cash	c
or	c
a	i
credit	i
card	i
is	i
all	c
I	c
will	c
need	c
?	c

I	c
ca	c
n't	c
?look	i
forward	i
to	c
start	c
this	c
adventure	c
.	c

And	c
if	c
this	c
is	c
a	c
problem	c
to	i
me	c
,	c
imagine	c
how	c
bad	c
a	c
very	c
fat	c
woman	c
(	c
or	c
man	c
)	c
should	i
feel	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Brown	c
,	c

Also	c
,	c
the	i
drinks	i
we	i
will	i
take	i
them	i
from	c
our	c
canteen	c
and	c
there	c
will	c
be	c
a	c
group	c
of	c
mucisians	i
for	c
our	c
entertainment	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
about	c
our	c
present	c
.	c

And	c
it	c
was	c
real	i
good	c
news	c
.	c

From	c
,	c
that	c
day	c
,	c
every	c
day	c
I	c
was	i
gone	i
to	c
the	c
office	c
30	c
minutes	c
before	i
.	c

When	c
I	c
complete	i
a	c
month	c
to	i
this	c
job	c
my	c
executive	c
he	i
tell	i
to	i
John	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
office	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
went	c
his	i
wants	i
to	c
tell	c
me	c
that	c
from	c
the	c
next	c
month	c
I	c
will	i
be	c
his	c
personal	c
secratary	i
and	c
my	c
salary	c
it	i
will	i
be	c
the	i
double	i
how	i
the	i
previous	i
.	c

I	c
cannot	i
believe	c
it	c
.	c

Unfortunatly	i
,	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
did	i
n't	i
go	i
like	i
the	i
advertisement	i
explained	i
,	c
and	c
that	c
wise	i
I	c
wont	i
ask	i
you	c
some	i
money	c
back	c
.	c

Also	c
the	c
Theatre	c
Restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
for	c
some	i
working	i
inside	i
.	c

Bests	c
regards	c
,	c

It	c
is	c
so	c
practical	c
,	c
in	c
five	c
minuts	i
my	c
friend	c
can	c
read	c
my	c
letter	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
so	c
nice	c
to	c
hear	c
the	c
news	c
from	c
you	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
.	c

Also	c
my	c
kids	c
have	c
school	c
holidays	c
during	c
this	c
month	c
therefore	c
I	c
hope	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
mid	c
of	i
July	c
.	c

I	c
'd	c
prefer	c
to	c
say	c
in	c
log	c
cabins	c
.	c

Whenever	c
we	c
used	c
a	c
tent	c
,	c
we	c
had	c
bugs	c
or	c
the	c
rain	c
dropped	c
inside	c
the	c
tent	c
.	c

Even	c
though	c
I	c
'm	c
poorly	c
skilled	c
.	c

How	c
are	c
you	c
?	c

It	c
was	c
quite	c
terrible	c
when	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
let	i
people	c
leave	c
,	c
because	c
all	c
tickets	c
were	c
sold	c
out	c
.	c

Can	c
you	c
imagine	c
that	c
I	c
touched	c
all	c
of	c
the	c
costumes	c
the	c
singer	c
wore	c
?	c

And	c
that	c
mad	i
the	c
concert	c
absolutely	c
perfect	c
.	c

After	i
we	c
arrive	i
at	c
the	c
theatre	c
,	c
We	i
were	c
very	c
disappointed	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
you	i
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

After	c
we	c
finish	i
school	c
,	c
we	c
usually	c
gathered	c
the	i
place	c
.	c

We	c
always	c
played	c
there	c
and	c
it	c
was	c
adventure	i
for	c
us	c
.	c

Our	c
ship	c
left	i
on	c
the	c
beach	c
.	c

Dear	c
sir	c
or	c
madam	c
,	c

Now	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
a	c
few	c
things	c
which	c
made	c
me	c
very	c
disappointed	c
.	c

I	c
gave	c
it	c
a	i
thought	c
the	c
other	c
day	c
and	c
when	c
I	c
think	c
about	c
future-clothing	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
take	c
my	c
mind	c
from	i
plastic-fabrics	i
.	c

Maybe	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
they	c
'll	c
find	c
out	i
a	c
new	c
fabric	c
which	c
protects	c
you	c
from	c
dirt	c
and	c
dangerous	c
sunshine	c
.	c

Maybe	c
everybody	c
will	c
end	c
up	c
wearing	c
shorts	c
and	c
skirts	c
.	c

After	c
this	c
bad	c
show	c
we	c
had	c
want	i
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
Restaurant	c
for	c
drunk	i
and	c
ate	i
something	c
and	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
and	c
nobody	c
had	i
explained	i
us	i
why	c
the	c
Restaurant	c
was	c
n't	c
open	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
I	c
'm	c
very	c
angry	c
when	c
I	c
think	c
about	c
this	c
evening	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
have	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
's	c
the	c
minimum	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
do	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
passed	i
a	c
really	c
beautiful	c
evening	c
with	c
Pat	c
and	c
my	c
boyfriend	c
in	c
the	c
cinema	c
,	c
but	c
on	c
Sunday	c
my	c
mother	c
phone	i
Pat	c
's	c
mother	c
and	c
Pat	c
's	c
mother	c
explain	i
all	i
the	i
story	c
to	c
my	c
mother	c
.	c

Since	c
this	i
Saturday	c
evening	c
I	c
had	i
never	c
speaking	i
with	i
Pat	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
ask	c
for	c
some	c
queries	c
about	c
your	c
letter	c
which	c
I	c
have	c
received	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
could	c
you	c
make	c
an	c
arrangement	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
,	c
because	c
it	c
seems	c
that	c
living	c
in	c
log	c
cabins	c
is	c
more	c
exciting	c
than	c
in	c
tents	c
.	c

Also	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
go	c
swimming	c
and	c
surfing	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
used	c
to	c
be	c
an	c
assistant	c
in	c
a	c
Korean	c
national	c
pool	c
so	i
that	i
I	c
am	c
good	c
at	c
swimming	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
be	i
appreciated	i
it	c
if	c
you	c
supply	i
some	c
towers	i
,	c
if	c
possible	c
.	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

It	c
seems	c
ages	c
since	c
I	c
wrote	c
to	c
you	c
.	c

How	c
have	c
you	c
been	c
?	c

I	c
helped	c
to	c
guide	c
foreginers	i
who	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
take	i
participated	i
in	c
that	c
.	c

I	c
got	c
Madona	c
's	c
signature	i
!	c

I	c
really	c
hope	c
to	c
see	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

Tuesday	c
13th	c
june	i

I	c
finished	c
5th	c
at	i
the	c
England	i
Golf	i
tour	i
junior	i
in	c
1999	c
,	i
and	c
basketball	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
discover	i
this	c
sport	c
I	c
only	c
used	c
to	c
play	c
at	c
school	c
.	c

I	c
've	c
got	c
other	c
questions	c
:	c
wich	i
type	c
of	c
clothes	c
do	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
bring	c
?	c

I	c
am	c
glad	c
that	c
you	c
offer	c
for	i
accommodation	c
not	c
only	c
tents	i
but	c
also	c
log	i
cabins	c
.	c

Because	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
light	c
sleeper	c
and	c
have	c
problems	c
with	c
my	c
back	c
I	c
prefer	c
to	c
sleep	c
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
with	c
a	c
comfortable	c
bed	c
.	c

Last	c
saturday	i
evening	c
I	c
spent	i
a	c
wonderful	c
time	c
.	c

The	c
only	c
thing	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
was	c
solving	i
the	c
different	c
problems	c
of	c
the	c
guests	i
and	c
just	c
being	i
there	c
if	c
they	c
have	i
any	c
questions	c
.	c

That	i
I	i
reached	i
a	i
lot	i
of	i
money	i
for	i
doing	i
something	i
I	i
like	i
very	i
much	i
was	i
very	i
nice	i
but	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
thing	c
for	c
me	c
was	c
meeting	c
people	c
,	c
having	c
fun	c
and	c
using	c
the	c
English	c
language	c
.	c

I	c
will	c
never	c
forget	c
this	c
evening	c
.	c

Another	c
question	c
was	c
about	c
the	c
accommodation	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
glad	c
to	c
read	c
that	c
it	c
is	c
possible	c
to	c
do	c
activities	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
.	c

I	c
've	c
chosen	c
singing	c
and	c
swimming	c
.	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
!	c

But	c
now	c
to	c
the	c
concert	c
itself	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
so	c
excited	c
that	c
I	i
also	i
was	i
not	i
able	i
to	i
eat	i
anything	i
.	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
bit	c
boring	c
but	c
more	c
or	c
less	c
okay	c
.	c

They	c
were	c
unknown	c
and	c
not	c
very	c
good	c
but	c
when	c
I	c
met	c
them	c
afterwards	c
I	c
recognised	i
that	c
they	c
are	i
very	c
nice	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
met	c
them	c
after	c
the	c
concert	c
they	c
asked	c
me	c
questions	c
like	c
Did	i
you	c
like	c
the	c
performance	c
!	i
or	c
How	i
do	c
you	c
think	c
about	c
the	c
first	c
group	c
?	c

This	c
was	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
best	c
and	c
most	c
exciting	c
days	c
in	i
my	c
life	c
.	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
available	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
from	c
1st	c
to	c
20th	c
because	c
my	c
university	c
will	c
be	c
closed	c
during	c
this	i
month	c
.	c

Although	c
it	c
is	c
not	c
very	c
comfortable	c
,	c
I	c
like	c
camping	c
very	c
much	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
swimming	c
as	c
well	c
because	c
I	c
practise	c
this	c
sport	c
every	c
week	c
in	c
my	c
city	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
doing	i
shopping	c
bring	i
me	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
satisfaction	c
especially	c
I	i
am	c
depressed	c
,	i
nevertheless	i
it	c
could	c
be	c
very	c
dangerous	c
for	c
my	c
wallet	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
would	i
be	c
available	c
for	c
travelling	c
only	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
my	c
university	c
will	c
finish	c
at	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
June	c
and	c
will	c
start	c
again	c
in	c
August	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
for	i
the	c
accomodation	i
,	c
I	c
would	c
say	c
I	c
prefer	c
living	c
in	c
tent	i
rather	c
than	c
in	c
log	i
cabin	c
because	c
I	c
used	c
to	c
sleep	c
in	c
tent	i
while	i
I	c
was	c
joining	i
a	i
local	c
scout	c
camp	c
in	c
my	c
country	c
.	c

It	c
seems	c
to	c
me	c
that	c
more	c
people	c
in	c
my	c
hometown	c
tend	c
to	c
go	c
shopping	c
in	c
their	c
free	c
time	c
because	c
the	c
shopping	c
complexs	i
nowadays	c
are	c
more	c
attractive	c
and	c
combine	c
every	c
facilities	i
inside	c
.	c

There	c
were	c
n't	c
any	c
discount	i
available	c
as	c
you	c
'd	c
assured	c
in	i
the	c
add	i
.	c

Why	c
did	c
n't	c
you	c
say	c
something	c
about	c
it	c
?	c

Marcella	c
,	c
Scalia	c
C	c
.	c

Now	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
have	c
your	c
point	c
of	c
view	c
.	c

Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
knee	i
on	c
swimming	c
and	c
playing	c
tennis	c
so	c
that	i
I	c
have	c
had	c
a	c
part-time	c
job	c
in	c
a	c
sports	c
centre	c
in	c
the	c
evenings	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

It	c
is	c
suggested	c
that	c
speaking	c
classes	c
should	c
be	c
filmed	i
the	i
reason	c
why	c
is	c
that	c
the	i
more	c
students	c
tend	c
to	c
attend	c
.	c

Another	c
reason	c
is	c
that	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
more	c
useful	c
for	c
forigen	i
students	c
who	c
want	c
to	c
speak	c
English	c
.	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
recommened	i
that	c
speaking	c
classes	c
and	c
school	c
trips	c
should	c
be	c
filmed	c
.	c

Travelling	c
in	c
July	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
say	c
,	c
would	c
be	c
perfect	c
for	c
me	c
because	c
I	i
have	i
got	i
my	i
birtday	i
the	c
24th	c
of	c
this	i
month	c
and	c
I	c
wish	c
I	i
could	i
spend	i
my	c
birtday	i
as	i
well	i
as	i
possible	c
,	c
so	c
it	i
means	c
there	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
.	c

I	c
want	c
you	c
to	c
give	c
our	i
money	c
back	c
because	c
the	c
things	c
published	c
in	c
your	c
advertisement	c
are	c
n't	c
true	c

The	c

's	c

in	c

wanted	c
to	c

The	c
advertisement	c
said	c
that	c
it	c
starts	c
at	c
19.30	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
started	i
actually	i
at	c
20:15	c
due	c
to	c
the	i
probleme	i
of	i
the	c
sound	c

Yours	c
Sincerely	c

How	c
has	c
modern	c

Our	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
so	c
she	c
lost	c
all	c
her	c
school	c
friends	c

Pat	c
's	c
classmates	c
made	i
the	c

and	c
Pat	c
finished	i
alone	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
,	c

Thus	c
I	c
spent	i
terrible	i
time	c
-	c
it	c
was	c
waste	i
of	c
time	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

If	i
it	i
came	i
true	i
,	i
imagination	i
to	i
make	i
cloth	i
would	i
bigger	i
and	i
could	i
think	i
various	i
design	i
and	i
format	i
.	c

Also	c
,	c
comfortable	c
cloth	c
for	c
person	c
will	c
maintain	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
.	c

Otherwise	c
I	c
'll	c
have	c
to	c
apply	c
to	c
court	i
for	c
aid	c

Yours	c

We	c
probably	c
will	c
be	c
wearing	c
dresses	c
made	c
of	c
synthetic	c
artificial	i
cloth	c
in	c
2100	c

On	c
the	c
other	c

people	c

to	c
wear	c
natural	c

,	c
made	c
of	c
cotton	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
of	c
Madam	c
,	c

I	c
had	c
to	c
wait	c
almost	c
an	c
hour	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
would	c
be	c
greatful	i
if	c
you	c
payed	i
for	c
a	c
full	c
refund	c
of	c
the	c
money	c
I	c
spent	c
in	i
the	c
tickets	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
one	c
hand	c
,	c
technology	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
help	c
for	c
me	c
at	c
school	c
.	c

What	c
I	c
mean	c
is	c
that	c
computers	c
are	c
very	c
useful	c
to	i
do	i
my	c
homework	c
(	c
like	c
some	c
monographies	i
or	c
researching	i
)	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Ryan	c
,	c

Your	c
letter	c
indicates	c
that	c
the	c
pride	i
includes	i
that	i
some	c
costs	c
are	i
paid	i
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	i

A	c
philosophy	c
lesson	c
seems	c
quite	c
appropriate	c
in	c
that	c
the	c
pupils	c
take	c
part	c
in	c
it	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
two	c
moments	c
could	c
have	c
a	c
role	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
have	c
just	c
received	c
your	c
letter	c
and	c
let	c
me	c
tell	c
you	c
what	c
you	c
missed	c
over	c
here	c
.	c

Well	c
,	c
we	c
also	c
had	c
to	c
carry	c
all	c
the	c
instruments	c
up	c
to	i
the	c
stage	c
and	c
believe	i
me	c
,	c
that	c
was	c
the	c
hardest	c
bit	c
of	c
all	c
.	c

They	c
were	c
extremely	c
heavy	c
and	c
there	c
were	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
them	c
on	c
the	c
bus	c
.	c

I	c
'll	c
never	c
wash	c
my	c
hands	i
again	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
advertisement	c
I	c
read	c
that	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
started	i
in	c
the	c
show	c
but	c
when	c
I	c
got	c
there	c
I	c
realised	c
there	c
was	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
in	c
his	c
place	c
whose	c
acting	c
was	c
n't	c
good	c
enough	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
are	c
the	c
manager	c
of	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
you	c
should	c
try	c
to	c
avoid	c
this	i
sort	i
of	c
problems	c
in	c
future	c
shows	c
.	c

Also	c
the	c
clothes	c
in	c
a	c
hundred	c
years	c
will	c
have	c
the	c
ability	c
to	c
cool	c
down	c
the	c
people	c
who	c
wear	c
them	c
in	c
the	c
summer	c
and	c
the	c
same	c
clothes	c
will	c
keep	c
them	c
warm	c
in	i
cold	c
winters	c
'	c
days	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
very	c
nice	c
of	c
you	c
to	c
let	c
me	c
choose	c
my	c
favourite	c
activities	c
.	c

The	c
ones	c
I	c
'm	c
most	c
keen	c
on	c
are	c
Tennis	i
,	c
in	i
which	c
I	c
think	c
I	c
'm	c
pretty	c
good	c
since	c
I	c
took	c
some	c
classes	c
last	c
year	c

Painting	i
,	c
which	c
is	c
one	c
of	c
my	c
favourite	c
hobbies	c
,	c
and	c
helps	c
me	c
to	c
relax	c
myself	i
and	c
forget	c
about	c
problems	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
I	c
'm	c
not	c
bad	c
at	c
painting	c
either	c
,	i
at	c
least	c
everyone	c
in	c
my	c
family	c
likes	c
my	c
work	c
,	c
includying	i
myself	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
waiting	i
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
such	c
a	c
great	c
experience	c
!	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
write	c
again	c
soon	c

I	c
selected	c
swimming	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
cure	c
against	i
my	c
backace	i
and	c
I	c
have	c
not	c
practiced	i
since	i
I	c
started	c
my	c
new	c

Shopping	c
is	c
enjoyable	c
when	c
you	c
want	c
to	c
offer	i
some	i
thing	i
to	c
someone	c
.	c

Shopping	c
is	c
also	c
good	c
,	i
when	c
you	c
know	c
what	c
you	c
want	c
.	c

First	c
at	i
all	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
pleasure	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
the	c
programme	c
which	c
you	c
so	c
kindly	c
have	c
prepared	c
is	c
very	c
interesting	c
,	c
especially	c
the	c
visit	c
to	c
the	c
National	c
Art	c
Gallery	c
on	c
Wednesday	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
our	c
class	c
has	c
recently	c
read	i
an	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
which	i
takes	c
place	c
during	c
our	c
visit	c
to	c
London	c
,	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
14th	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
your	c
reply	c
.	c

Referring	c
to	c
the	c
possibilities	c
of	c
accommodation	c
,	c
I	c
'd	c
prefer	c
log	c
cabins	c
to	c
tents	c
.	c

Last	i
not	i
least	i
,	c
I	c
always	c
have	c
backache	c
after	c
sleeping	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
for	c
a	c
couple	c
of	c
days	c
.	c

I	c
just	c
love	c
singing	c
.	c

Lastly	c
,	c
does	c
the	c
prize	c
include	c
pocket	c
money	c
?	c

Nowadays	c
shopping	c
can	c
be	c
very	c
stressful	c
.	c

It	c
all	c
starts	c
with	c
the	c
search	c
of	i
an	c
appropriate	c
parking-space	c
which	c
can	c
last	c
annoyingly	c
long	c
,	c
especially	c
at	c
weekends	c
.	c

Nevertheless	c
,	c
the	c
nightmare	c
starts	c
when	c
you	c
enter	c
the	c
shopping	c
mall	c
or	c
the	c
passage	c
,	c
which	c
is	c
terribly	c
crowded	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Smith	c
,	c

Last	c
week	c
I	i
and	i
my	i
family	i
had	c
a	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

But	c
I	i
and	i
my	i
family	i
had	c
a	c
very	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
.	c

Danny	c
Brook	c
did	c
n't	c
play	i
at	i
the	c
performance	c
,	c
there	c
was	c
another	c
unknown	i
actor	i
.	c

And	c
he	c
played	i
awful	i
,	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
hear	c
him	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
nervious	i
.	c

He	c
suggested	c
to	i
have	i
a	i
supper	c
in	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
.	c

But	c
when	c
we	c
came	i
to	c
it	c
,	c
we	c
saw	c
that	c
the	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
,	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
reconstructed	i
.	c

All	c
of	c
them	c
play	c
a	c
very	c
great	c
role	c
in	c
people	c
's	c
daily	c
life	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
now	c
women	c
do	c
n't	c
spend	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
time	c
at	i
the	c
kitchen	c
,	c
preparing	c
the	c
meal	c
or	c
washing	c
up	i
dishes	c
.	c

But	c
now	c
they	c
can	c
use	c
Internet	i
,	c
where	c
you	c
can	c
find	c
any	c
information	c
you	c
need	c
.	c

I	c
saw	c
an	c
advertising	i
which	c
seemed	i
very	c
atractive	i
to	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
you	c
will	c
understand	c
it	i
was	c
not	c
"	c
my	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
"	c
as	c
you	c
said	c
,	c
but	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
worth	i
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
,	c
in	c
fact	c
she	c
was	c
so	c
bad	c
at	c
that	c
she	c
put	i
me	c
in	c
such	i
trouble	c
.	c

I	c
've	c
done	c
it	i
for	c
many	c
years	c
and	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
do	c
both	c
once	c
a	c
day	c
.	c

If	c
possible	c
,	c
could	c
you	c
let	c
me	c
know	c
what	c
I	c
'll	c
need	c
for	i
example	c
which	i
clothes	c
I	c
must	c
take	c
and	c
how	c
much	c
I	c
can	c
expect	c
to	c
spend	c
.	i

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
about	c
my	i
good	c
experience	c
I	c
had	c
last	c
month	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
unbelievable	c
to	c
realize	i
that	c
I	c
'd	c
worked	c
with	c
stars	c
and	c
that	c
they	c
were	c
my	c
friends	c
.	c

I	c
wanted	c
to	c
spend	c
my	c
leisure	i
time	c
well	c
by	c
taking	c
in	c
that	c
cultural	c
event	c
.	c

How	c
stupid	c
of	c
me	c
!	c

The	c
reason	c
was	c
unknown	c
.	c

At	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
the	c
advertisement	c
as	i
I	c
noticed	c
it	c
was	i
said	i
something	c
of	i
perfect	i
evening	c
out	c
.	c

Looking	c
back	c
in	i
the	c
past	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
see	c
,	i
how	c
big	c
difference	i
is	i
between	c
life	i
of	c
my	c
grandparents	c
and	c
mine	c
.	c

But	c
there	c
are	c
some	c
drawbacks	c
,	c
which	c
appeared	c
last	i
years	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
a	i
lot	c
of	c
pollution	c
has	c
raised	i
.	c

On	c
Monday	c
we	c
could	c
first	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
Sience	i
Museum	c
and	c
in	c
the	c
afternoon	c
to	c
Greenwich	c
.	c

Your	i
sincerely	c

It	c
must	c
be	c
wonderful	c
when	c
you	c
have	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
money	c
and	c
everybody	c
seems	c
to	c
know	c
you	c
.	c

Of	c
course	c
you	c
have	c
fame	c
and	c
poverty	i
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
,	c
on	c
behalf	c
of	c
the	c
students	c
in	c
my	c
class	c
,	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
the	c
trip	c
to	c
London	c
.	c

All	c
my	c
classmates	c
are	c
very	c
interested	c
in	c
this	c
show	c
,	c
which	c
includes	c
latest	i
fashions	c
,	c
Leisure	i
and	c
sports	c
wear	c
,	c
Make	i
up	i
,	c
and	c
Hair	i
styles	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
some	c
people	c
need	c
journalists	c
to	c
be	i
more	c
famous	c
,	c
because	c
people	c
can	i
have	i
news	i
who	i
are	i
famous	i
through	c
journalists	c
.	c

The	c
second	c
think	i
is	c
that	c
the	c
play	c
did	c
not	c
start	c
at	c
19:30	c
but	c
at	c
20:15	c
!	c

I	c
could	c
not	c
get	c
a	c
discount	c
.	c

The	c
last	c
think	i
is	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
unpossible	i
to	c
get	i
the	i
theatre	c
restaurant	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

At	i
the	i
end	i
I	i
would	c
like	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
my	c
evening	c
out	c
two	c
days	c
before	i
was	c
not	c
perfect	c
and	c
I	c
wold	i
be	c
glad	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
pay	i
my	i
some	i
money	i
back	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
write	c
how	i
it	c
has	c
influented	i
my	c
daily	c
life	c
.	c

I	c
just	c
send	c
an	c
e-mail	c
and	c
that	c
is	c
all	c
!	c

Now	c
I	c
just	c
only	i
put	c
some	c
money	c
into	c
a	c
machine	c
and	c
I	c
can	c
take	c
the	c
card	c
from	c
there	c
!	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
,	c

I	c
would	c
particularly	c
like	c
to	c
talk	c
about	c
the	c
second	c
day	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

It	c
was	c
dangerous	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
knew	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
knew	c
I	c
could	c
not	c
do	i
any	c
moviment	i
for	c
my	c
safety	c
but	c
I	c
did	c
and	c
for	i
my	c
surprise	c
It	i
run	i
away	c
.	c

Concerning	c
the	c
activities	c
,	c
as	i
a	i
matter	i
of	i
fact	i
tennis	c
is	c
my	c
favorit	i
sport	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
keen	c
on	c
it	c
,	i
for	i
the	c
second	c
activity	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
enroll	i
surfing	i
,	c
because	c
my	c
husband	c
,	c
who	c
is	c
already	c
a	c
proficient	c
,	i
keeps	c
telling	c
me	c
about	c
the	c
excitement	c
of	c
this	c
sport	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
worthwile	i
trying	c
,	c
therefore	c
I	c
'd	c
love	c
to	c
be	c
in	c
the	c
beginners	i
group	c
.	c

Once	c
students	c
have	c
taken	c
a	c
shower	c
after	c
a	i
hard	c
physical	c
training	c
they	c
come	i
to	i
real	c
life	c
,	i
depending	i
on	c
their	c
levels	c
they	i
have	c
to	c
study	c
for	i
instance	i
languages	c
wich	i
I	c
personally	c
find	c
very	c
important	c
for	c
a	c
person	c
working	c
in	c
the	c
tourism	c
field	i
because	c
these	i
enables	i
stuff	i
to	c
communicate	c
with	c
clients	c
in	c
a	c
proper	c
way	c
,	i
students	i
have	c
to	c
manage	c
to	c
speak	c
at	c
least	c
three	c
languages	c
.	c

The	c
school	c
works	c
together	c
with	c
known	c
companies	c
of	i
the	i
branch	i
as	i
Mariot	c
hotel	c
,	c
Air	c
France	c
Princess	i
cruise	c
among	i
others	c
in	i
order	c
to	c
provide	c
students	c
with	c
high	i
qualified	i
training	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
hope	c
to	c
receive	c
your	c
reply	c
soon	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Also	c
they	c
are	c
showing	i
their	c
first	c
play	c
on	c
the	c
2nd	c
of	c
July	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
according	c
to	c
the	c
advertisment	i
,	c
the	c
musical	c
was	c
supprsed	i
to	c
start	c
at	c
19.30	c
but	c
it	c
actually	c
started	c
at	c
20.15	c
which	i
caused	c
me	c
a	i
trouble	i
.	c

With	c
all	c
the	c
dissatisfuction	i
above	c
,	c
therefore	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
for	c
some	c
of	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
as	c
my	c
evening	c
was	c
not	c
what	c
it	c
would	i
have	c
to	i
be	i
.	c

Pat	c
,	c
too	c
,	c
are	i
friend	i
of	c
them	i
and	c
has	c
seen	c
them	c
time	i
to	c
time	c
.	c

As	c
Molly	c
did	c
n't	c
know	c
this	c
,	c
she	c
was	c
so	c
surprised	c
and	c
tried	c
to	c
ask	c
more	c
about	c
it	c
.	c

Everyone	c
is	c
going	c
to	c
know	c
that	c
Sally	c
has	c
been	c
cheating	c
both	c
on	c
Vance	c
and	c
her	c
new	c
boyfriend	c
and	c
the	i
Poor	i
Vance	c
is	c
always	c
the	c
last	c
person	c
to	c
know	c
it	i
.	c

Could	c
I	i
please	i
know	i
which	i
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
should	c
bring	c
with	c
me	c
and	c
the	i
company	c
offers	c
us	c
some	c
expensise	i
money	c
to	c
spend	c
?	c

Once	c
again	c
,	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
sending	c
me	c
information	i
.	c

I	c
feel	c
,	i
it	c
will	c
be	c
the	c
best	c
holiday	c
,	i
I	c
have	c
ever	c
had	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

it	i
causes	i
over	i
crowded	i
shops	c
,	c
high-pitch	i
noise	c
,	c
lack	i
of	c
parking	c
place	i
and	c
if	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
go	c
shopping	c
with	c
a	c
child	c
,	c
the	c
whole	c
matters	i
just	c
enough	i
to	c
drive	c
you	c
crazy	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
inform	c
you	c
about	c
the	c
bad	c
experience	c
I	c
had	c
last	i
evening	c
going	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
.	c

Your	i
sincerely	c

We	c
would	c
appreciate	c
it	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
give	c
us	c
a	c
chance	c
to	c
go	c
there	c
while	c
we	c
are	c
visiting	c
in	i
London	c
.	c

But	c
the	c
only	c
problem	c
for	i
the	c
show	c
is	c
the	c
date	c
which	c
is	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
14	c
March	c
from	c
10.00	c
to	c
19.00	c
.	c

But	c
Mr.	c
Robertson	c
,	c
these	c
our	i
suggestions	c
are	i
depended	i
on	c
your	c
programme	c
,	c
we	c
're	c
just	c
suggesting	c
.	c

Home	c
might	c
be	c
a	c
mixture	c
with	c
moden	i
styles	c
and	c
natural	i
view	i
as	c
well	c
.	c

Maybe	c
it	c
is	c
right	c
say	i
that	i
in	c
a	c
flat	c
instead	c
of	c
a	c
building	c
.	c

Most	c
of	c
them	c
are	c
flats	c
which	c
have	c
at	c
lest	i
20	c
Floors	c
.	c

And	c
because	c
it	c
'll	c
be	c
a	c
big	c
building	c
we	c
'll	c
able	i
to	c
see	c
a	c
whole	i
view	c
through	c
the	c
window	c
.	c

Our	c
homes	c
have	c
change	i
with	c
many	c
comfortable	c
things	c
compare	i
with	c
the	c
past	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
now	c
we	c
have	c
a	c
security	c
safety	i
like	c
a	c
bell	c
or	c
button	c
.	c

To	c
conclude	c
,	c
while	c
our	c
homes	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
will	c
be	c
much	c
safer	c
than	c
before	c
,	c
they	c
will	c
still	c
have	c
good	c
spaces	c
for	c
us	c
to	c
be	c
at	c
home	c
.	c

Another	c
thing	c
that	c
was	c
wrong	c
is	c
about	c
discounts	c
:	c
you	c
had	c
written	c
they	c
were	c
available	c
,	c
but	c
they	c
were	c
not	c
and	c
so	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
pay	c
the	c
whole	i
ticket	i
's	i
price	c
.	c

But	c
the	c
worst	c
thing	c
was	c
that	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
the	c
restaurant	c
of	i
the	c
theatre	c
was	c
closed	c
and	c
so	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
another	c
place	c
to	c

I	c

you	c
some	i

I	c
have	c

glad	c
to	c
know	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
two	c
weeks	c

Camp	c

I	c
would	c
be	c
grateful	c
if	c
I	c
could	c
have	i
the	i
accomodation	i
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
:	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
not	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
because	c
of	c
my	c
height	c
,	i
I	c
am	c
so	c
tall	c
that	c
I	c
could	c
never	c

I	c

very	c

at	c
explaining	c
;	c
she	c
is	c
excellent	c
at	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
your	c
musical	c
show	c
.	c

Lots	c
of	c
information	c
in	c
your	c
advertisement	c
are	i
not	c
correct	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
20.15	c
instead	c
of	c
19.30	c
as	c
you	c
had	c
written	c
on	i
it	i
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
science	c
and	c
technology	c
will	c
have	c
consequences	c
on	c
my	c
behaviours	i
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
without	c
using	c
internet	i
I	c
could	c
not	c
put	i
me	i
through	c
to	c
foreign	c
people	c
.	c

I	c
feel	c
free	c
as	c
a	i
eagle	c
.	c

I	c
can	c
take	c
advantage	c
of	c
those	i
technologies	c
as	c
mobile	c
phone	i
,	c
lap	c
top	c
computer	i
,	c
television	i
,	c
to	c
have	c
contacts	i
with	c
different	c
cultures	c
.	c

Be	c
carefull	i
,	c
my	c
own	c
technology	c
can	c
kill	c
me	c
.	c

The	c
only	c
convinient	i
time	c
to	c
travel	c
is	c
in	c
July	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
to	c
avoid	c
these	c
this	c
time	c
.	c

I	c
regularly	i
play	i
tennis	c
since	c
I	c
was	c
nine	c
years	c
old	c
and	c
I	c
entered	i
several	c
competitions	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

My	c
job	c
was	c
checking	c
the	c
entry	c
tickets	c
and	c
the	c
bags	c
of	c
the	c
fans	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
to	c
tear	c
off	c
a	c
part	c
of	c
every	c
single	c
ticket	c
.	c

After	c
two	c
hours	c
of	c
tearing	c
tickets	c
I	c
changed	c
my	c
place	i
and	c
went	c
to	c
help	c
at	c
the	c
security	c
section	c
.	c

I	c
really	c
felt	c
like	c
a	c
security	c
guard	c
.	c

Love	c

About	c
activities	c
,	c
I	c
enjoy	c
most	i
painting	i
,	c
because	c
I	c
am	i
a	c
plastic	i
artist	i
since	c
I	c
was	c
nine	c
and	c
I	c
've	c
won	c
lots	c
of	c
prizes	c
with	c
my	c
art	c
.	c

Is	c
that	c
enough	c
?	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothe	i
I	c
probably	i
will	i
use	i
there	c
?	c

And	c
how	c
much	c
clothe	i
?	c

A	c
lot	c
,	c
or	c
few	i
?	c

Will	c
I	c
spend	c
much	c
?	c

If	c
you	c
could	c
tell	c
me	c
about	c
this	c
,	c
I	c
'll	c
be	c
glad	c
!	c

Greatefully	i

Remember	c
when	c
I	c
told	c
you	c
I	c
helped	c
someone	c
important	c
?	c

Well	c
,	c
listen	c
to	c
this	c
.	c

Carefully	c
,	c
he	c
took	c
off	c
the	c
cap	c
.	c

Can	c
you	c
believe	c
it	c
!	c

Teresa	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
really	c
amazed	c
to	c
have	c
actually	c
won	c
first	c
prize	c
after	c
years	c
of	c
unsuccessfully	c
entering	c
competitions	c
!	c

-	c
My	c
choice	c
of	c
sports	c
are	c
swimming	c
and	c
tennis	c
.	c

Therefore	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
time	i
document	c
which	c
will	c
remain	c
of	c
interest	c
and	c
which	c
will	c
be	c
read	c
again	c
and	c
again	c
,	c
also	i
by	i
non-South	i
Africans	i

Steve	c
Biko	c
for	c
becoming	c
a	c
martyr	c
to	c
the	c
black	c
freedom	c
movement	c
of	c
these	i
dark	c
years	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
end	c
he	c
had	c
to	c
leave	c
the	c
country	c
of	c
his	c
birth	c
to	c
escape	c
imprisonment	c

I	c
could	c
not	c
listen	c
to	c
one	c
of	c
my	c
favorite	i
classic	i
concert	i

"	c
La	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
telling	c
me	c
about	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
.	c

I	c
really	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
taking	c
part	c
at	i
Camp	c
California	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
,	c
the	c
weather	c
may	c
be	c
nice	c
at	c
that	c
period	i
of	i
time	i
.	c

As	c
I	c
love	c
singing	c
and	c
always	c
spend	c
my	c
free	c
time	c
in	i
Karaoke	c
to	c
practise	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
my	c
singing	c
is	c
not	c
too	c
bad	c
.	c

I	c
also	c
have	c
a	c
couple	c
of	c
things	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
.	c

What	c
type	c
of	c
clothes	c
and	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
do	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
prepare	i
?	c

I	c
strongly	c
agree	c
with	c
this	c
sentence	c
.	c

I	c
paid	c
for	c
this	c
performance	c
the	c
full	c
price	c
£	i
20	c
because	c
discounts	c
were	c
not	c
available	c
although	c
on	i
your	c
advertisement	c
there	i
were	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
it	i
is	c
a	c
typical	c
situation	c
in	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatrer	i
that	c
is	i
promised	i
much	c
more	c
then	c
the	c
people	c
can	c
get	c
for	c
their	c
money	c
,	c
or	c
it	i
was	c
on	c
June	c
7	c
(	c
my	c
visit	c
)	c
only	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
am	i
not	c
agree	i
with	i
such	c
situation	i
and	c
would	i
ask	c
you	c
for	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
-	c
my	c
bank	c
account	c
number	c
is	c
enclosed	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
modern	i
technology	c
changed	i
our	c
daily	c
life	c
tremendously	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
ten	i
years	c
ago	c
it	i
was	i
very	i
common	i
that	i
almost	c
all	c
people	c
visited	c
cinemas	c
and	c
today	c
they	c
prefer	c
watching	c
films	c
at	c
home	c
because	c
they	c
have	c
relatively	c
good	c
video-recorders	c
and	c
TV	i
.	c

First	c
,	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
was	c
n't	c
the	c
star	c
that	c
night	c
,	c
he	c
was	c
replaced	c
by	c
an	c
actor	c
that	c
seemed	c
a	i
rookie	c
.	c

How	i
it	i
was	i
explained	i
above	i
,	i
I	i
'm	i
not	i
satisfied	i
and	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
be	c
refund	i
.	c

We	i
'll	i
understand	c
why	c
I	c
'm	c
writing	c
in	i
the	c
past	c
.	c

Last	c
weekend	c
we	c
diced	i
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
bach	i
with	c
Pat	c
and	c
Nick	c
(	c
her	c
boyfriend	c
)	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
really	c
very	c
unlucked	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
on	c
behalf	c
of	c
my	c
class	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
about	i
the	c
programme	c
you	c
organised	c
for	c
our	c
trip	c
to	c
London	c
.	c

Terror	c
in	c
the	c
Alps	c

We	c
had	c
been	c
preparing	c
the	c
trip	c
for	c
several	c
days	c
when	c
we	c
started	c
to	c
climb	c
the	c
mountain	c
,	c
on	c
that	i
4th	c
of	c
September	c
1995	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
it	c
started	c
to	c
go	c
wrong	c
after	c
one	c
hour	c
of	c
downhill	c
walking	c
.	c

We	c
were	c
trapped	c
!	c

Unfortunately	c
instead	i
of	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
we	c
have	c
seen	c
unknown	i
actor	c
.	c

I	c
no	i
thought	i
,	i
that	c
so	c
serious	c
theatre	i
makes	i
such	c
mistakes	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
in	i
the	c
future	c
people	c
will	c
wear	c
clothes	c
made	c
of	c
a	i
natural	c
fabrics	c
;	c
silk	c
,	c
cotton	c
,	c
leather	c
,	c
wool	c
.	c

Young	c
people	c
will	c
wear	c
jeans	c
and	c
T-shirt	i
.	c

Fashion	i
colours	c
-	c
it	i
will	c
be	c
earth	c
colours	c
:	c
grey	c
,	c
blue	c
,	c
yellow	c
,	c
brown	c
.	c

For	c
special	c
ocassions	i
,	c
for	c
example	i
-	i
the	i
party	c
,	c
the	i
concert	c
,	c
people	c
will	c
wear	i
very	c
smart	i
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
,	i
we	c
will	c
observe	c
a	c
little	i
and	i
slow	c
changes	c
in	c
fashion	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
hope	c
that	c
new	c
clothes	c
will	c
be	i
always	i
pleasent	i
for	c
people	c
.	c

The	c
river	c
trip	c
to	c
Greenwich	c
is	c
certainly	c
something	c
we	c
are	c
all	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
,	c
but	c
due	i
to	i
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
show	c
,	c
my	c
class	c
asked	i
me	c
to	c
propose	i
a	c
change	c
in	c
our	c
schedule	c
.	c

This	c
show	c
consists	c
of	c
a	c
big	c
fair	c
in	c
the	c
Central	c
Exhibition	c
Hall	c
in	c
which	c
we	c
will	c
have	c
the	c
opportunity	c
of	c
seeing	c
the	c
latest	c
releases	c
on	i
sports	i
wear	i
,	c
make	c
up	c
,	i
hairstyles	i
.	c

Dear	c
Sarah	c
,	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
's	c
all	c
about	c
it	c
.	c

Love	c

However	c
,	c
on	c
the	i
March	c
14	c
,	c
there	c
is	c
the	c
"	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
"	c
,	c
which	c
is	c
also	c
interesting	c
for	c
us	c
.	c

We	c
all	c
agree	c
that	c
we	c
are	c
going	c
to	i
join	i
the	c
school	c
trip	c
to	c
Science	i
Museum	c
,	c
which	c
is	c
the	c
most	c
interesting	c
trip	c
for	c
us	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
,	c

We	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
you	c
have	c
spend	i
for	i
us	i
in	c
order	c
to	c
organize	c
the	c
programme	c
that	c
we	c
should	i
follow	c
during	c
three	i
days	c
that	c
we	c
are	c
going	c
to	c
spending	i
London	i
.	c

The	c
media	c
is	c
everywhere	c
,	i
televisions	i
,	c
radio	c
stations	c
,	c
newspapers	c
,	c
magazines	i
all	c
have	c
one	c
goal	c
,	c
to	c
inform	c
the	c
citizens	c
.	c

Some	c
of	c
them	c
,	c
however	c
are	i
not	c
doing	c
their	c
job	c
probably	c
.	c

They	c
do	c
n't	c
inform	i
people	i
about	i
news	c
,	c
education	c
or	c
documentaries	c
.	c

They	c
just	c
published	i
gossips	i
about	c
famous	c
people	c
,	c
such	c
as	c
politicians	c
,	c
musicians	c
and	c
film	c
stars	c
.	c

I	c
believe	c
all	c
the	i
people	c
famous	i
or	c
not	c
,	c
deserve	c
to	c
have	c
private	i
life	c
without	c
journalists	c
to	i
following	c
them	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
.	c

Despide	i
of	i
that	c
we	c
were	c
still	c
thinking	c
optimisticly	i
.	c

In	c
the	c
end	c
,	c
the	c
weather	c
got	c
better	c
,	c
so	c
we	c
decided	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
beach	c
.	c

We	c
went	c
for	i
swimming	c
.	c

Everything	c
was	c
looking	c
so	c
dangerous	c
but	c
fortunetly	i
ended	i
good	i
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

The	c
thing	c
is	c
we	c
are	c
too	c
fashion	c
conscious	c
,	c
too	c
fussy	c
about	c
our	c
appearance	c
and	c
we	c
'll	c
end	c
up	c
forking	i
out	i
for	i
smart	c
clothes	c
only	c
because	c
the	c
people	c
next	c
door	c
are	c
doing	c
so	c
!	c
!	c

We	c
know	c
that	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
good	c
chance	c
for	c
us	c
to	c
learn	c
more	c
different	c
things	c
and	c
can	i
widen	c
our	c
knowledge	c
in	c
the	c
Science	c
Museum	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
I	c
know	c
that	c
most	c
of	c
the	c
students	c
have	c
already	c
visited	c
this	i
two	c
places	c
before	c
.	c

And	c
,	i
there	c
should	c
be	c
a	i
electrical	i
servant	c
in	c
everyone	c
's	c
home	c
.	c

There	c
should	i
be	c
no	c
beds	c
at	c
home	c
because	c
some	c
pills	c
are	i
invented	c
to	c
make	i
people	i
not	i
sleepy	c
.	c

People	c
will	c
do	c
anything	i
on	c
the	c
computer	c
,	c
including	c
watching	c
TV	c
,	c
listen	i
to	c
music	c
,	c
chat	i
with	c
people	c
.	c

As	c
the	c
computer	c
is	c
being	i
as	i
a	c
multi-functional	c
products	i
.	c

Since	c
friends	c
and	c
family	c
members	c
wo	c
n't	c
change	c
and	i
replace	i
,	i
by	c
anything	c
.	c

I	c
really	c
wonder	c
how	c
the	c
home	c
of	c
the	c
future	c
will	c
be	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
apologise	c
you	i
for	c
my	c
controversary	i
opinnion	i
but	c
I	c
feel	c
really	c
disappointed	c
.	c

Nevertheless	c
after	i
the	c
show	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
hungry	c
so	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
restarrant	i
and	c
what	c
I	i
've	i
seen	i
?	c

Eventually	i
-	c
you	c
offered	c
a	c
wonderflul	i
evening	c
but	c
I	c
must	c
say	c
that	c
if	c
I	c
had	c
known	c
that	c
it	c
is	i
going	i
to	c
be	c
like	c
that	c
I	c
would	c
n't	c
have	c
wasted	c
my	c
time	c
.	c

Many	c
things	c
have	c
been	c
replaced	c
by	c
the	i
others	c
which	c
are	c
more	c
helpful	c
and	c
useful	c
.	c

The	c
most	c
important	c
thing	c
for	c
me	c
is	c
using	c
a	c
computer	c
.	c

Playing	c
the	c
games	c
takes	c
me	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
time	c
and	c
it	c
became	i
a	c
bad	c
habit	c
.	c

But	c
actually	c
it	c
is	c
boring	c
when	c
you	c
're	c
almost	c
always	c
under	c
observation	c
.	c

My	c
mother	c
is	c
happy	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
happier	c
because	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
need	c
to	c
put	i
an	c
effort	c
to	c
iron	c
the	c
clothes	c
.	c

I	c
admire	c
people	i
who	c
made	c
those	c
machines	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
give	c
them	c
the	i
tribute	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
because	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
my	c
opinion	c
and	c
some	c
suggestions	c
for	c
next	c
year	c
's	c
festival	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
when	c
we	c
failed	i
an	c
exam	c
in	c
June	c
,	c
we	c
can	c
have	i
it	c
in	c
September	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
's	c
not	c
a	c
good	c
thing	c
because	c
we	c
ca	c
n't	c
discuss	c
with	i
our	c
family	c
.	c

The	c
festival	c
was	c
generally	c
good	c
but	c
I	c
have	c
some	c
suggestions	c
for	c
the	i
next	c
year	c
's	c
festival	c
.	c

However	c
there	c
were	c
things	c
that	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
like	c
.	c

You	c
said	c
that	c
stars	c
and	c
artists	c
would	c
come	c
from	c
around	c
the	c
world	c
but	c
there	c
was	i
only	c
starts	i
from	c
six	c
major	c
countries	c
.	c

By	i
this	c
way	c
we	c
can	c
meet	c
other	c
stars	c
and	c
artists	c
,	c
see	c
different	c
cultures	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
will	c
make	i
the	c
same	c
thing	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
will	c
listen	c
my	i
suggestions	c
.	c

Dear	c
Emily	c
,	c

In	c
schools	c
we	c
are	c
n't	c
allowed	c
to	c
speak	c
in	c
classes	i
.	c

These	c
are	c
the	c
rules	c
in	c
school	c
.	c

In	c
our	c
home	c
there	c
are	c
some	c
rules	c
too	c
!	c

I	c
must	c
be	c
kind	c
to	c
my	c
brother	c
and	c
my	c
parents	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
,	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
the	c
worst	c
performance	c
I	c
had	c
ever	c
seen	c
and	c
it	c
disappointed	c
me	c
very	c
much	c
.	c

It	i
was	c
,	c
however	c
,	c
impossible	c
because	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
for	c
unknown	c
reasons	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
have	c
been	c
the	c
happiest	c
woman	c
since	c
I	c
have	i
got	i
your	c
letter	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
some	c
information	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complete	i
about	c
my	c
being	i
to	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
during	c
my	c
last	c
week	i
's	i
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

We	c
called	c
this	c
place	c
like	i
this	c
,	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
land	i
in	c
the	c
middle	c
of	c
our	c
lake	c
.	c

There	c
was	c
no	c
light	c
during	i
nights	i
so	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
find	c
some	c
wood	c
to	c
make	c
a	c
fire	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
it	c
recommends	i
also	c
'	i
Leisure	c
and	c
Sports	c
Wear	c
'	c
.	c

We	c
strongly	c
recommend	c
it	c
,	c
because	c
students	c
'	c
admission	c
is	c
free	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
convinced	c
that	c
you	c
agree	i
with	c
us	c
and	c
we	c
take	i
part	i
in	i
this	c
show	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

They	c
are	c
always	c
under	c
high	i
pressure	c
in	c
their	c
every-day	i
life	c
,	c
because	c
they	c
are	c
afraid	c
of	c
being	c
recognise	i
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
I	c
belive	i
that	c
we	c
have	c
right	i
to	c
be	c
informed	c
about	c
their	c
life	i
,	c
providing	c
that	c
journalists	c
respect	c
some	c
important	c
rules	c
.	c

The	c
latest	c
fashions	c
will	c
be	c
shown	c
there	c
and	c
many	c
useful	c
tips	c
about	c
make-up	c
and	c
hairstyles	c
will	c
be	c
given	c
.	c

According	c
over	i
programme	c
we	c
have	c
a	i
free	c
time	c
on	c
Wednesday	c
,	c
March	c
15	c
.	c

We	c
hope	c
you	c
are	i
agree	c
with	c
us	c
.	c

They	c
are	c
always	c
expected	c
to	c
be	c
beautiful	c
,	c
intelligent	c
,	c
good-looking	c
.	c

That	c
's	c
why	c
it	c
's	c
very	c
important	c
for	c
these	c
people	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
private	c
life	c
without	c
journalists	c
where	c
they	c
can	c
relax	c
and	c
where	c
they	c
do	c
n't	c
need	c
to	c
be	c
superstars	c
.	c

In	c
answer	c
to	c
your	c
letter	c
,	c
you	c
will	c
find	c
below	c
the	c
informations	i
you	c
need	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
.	c

Life	c
at	c
school	c
is	c
made	c
of	c
several	c
things	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
seen	c
an	c
advertisement	c
in	c
the	c
times	i
about	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
alredy	i
thought	c
about	c
a	c
changing	i
of	i
the	c
programme	c
.	c

What	c
was	c
so	c
dangerous	c
and	c
why	i
I	i
had	i
to	i
do	i
it	i
?	c

Now	c
I	c
will	c
tell	c
you	c
in	c
brief	c
what	i
exactly	i
happened	c
to	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
very	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
want	c
you	c
to	c
give	c
me	c
back	c
my	c
money	c
,	i
I	c
hope	c
that	c
in	c
future	c
you	c
will	c
corect	i
all	c
this	i
mistakes	c
.	c

I	c
told	c
him	c
my	c
worst	c
love	c
story	c
.	c

Every	c
time	c
when	i
I	c
looked	c
up	c
at	c
her	c
my	c
legs	c
were	c
shaking	c
so	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
come	i
up	c
and	c
talk	c
to	c
her	c
!	c

I	c
was	c
constantly	c
seeing	c
her	c
but	c
my	c
shyness	c
made	c
my	c
mouth	c
close	c
so	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
say	c
anything	c
!	c

Few	i
days	c
later	c
someone	c
told	c
me	c
that	c
Sue	c
was	c
actually	c
a	c
boy	c
!	c

From	c
that	c
moment	c
I	c
feel	i
like	c
I	c
have	i
been	c
in	c
front	c
of	c
a	c
video	c
camera	c
and	c
the	c
operator	c
of	c
it	c
is	i
me	c
!	c

From	c
that	c
moment	c
I	c
live	i
alone	c
.	c

Dear	c
Miss	c
Clark	c
,	c

I	c
enjoyied	i
it	c
and	c
here	c
are	c
some	c
feelings	i
and	c
advice	c
for	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
there	c
were	c
only	c
artists	c
from	c
six	c
countries	c
,	c
not	c
as	i
written	c
in	c
your	c
add	i
.	c

Each	c
one	c
was	c
fantastic	c
and	i
fill	i
in	i
with	i
euration	i
,	c
but	c
I	c
'd	c
appreciate	c
more	c
place	i
,	c
because	c
unfortunately	c
some	c
concert	c
halls	c
were	c
too	c
small	c
!	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
want	c
you	i
to	c
make	c
a	c
suggestion	c
for	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

Mark	c
and	c
his	c
family	c
decided	c
to	c
go	c
for	c
a	c
walk	c
in	c
the	c
Alps	c
.	c

They	c
were	c
near	c
a	c
little	c
house	c
,	i
built	c
in	i
wood	c
and	c
began	c
walking	c
.	c

They	c
ate	c
with	c
the	c
owner	c
of	c
the	c
little	c
house	c
,	c
whose	c
name	c
was	c
John	c
.	c

I	i
'm	i
belonging	i
to	c
a	c
tennis	c
club	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
the	i
most	i
favourite	c
sports	i
.	c

Can	c
I	c
change	c
money	c
for	i
US	c
dollars	c
there	c
?	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

In	c
the	c
bargain	c
season	c
,	c
all	c
shops	c
are	c
full	c
of	c
people	c
who	c
keen	i
on	c
finding	c
stuffs	i
which	c
are	i
good	c
value	c
for	c
money	c
.	c

Looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c

17/6/2000	c

As	c
a	c
result	c
,	c
I	c
could	c
not	c
have	c
my	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
announcement	i
foil	i
I	c
read	c
that	c
we	c
could	c
have	i
had	i
some	c
discounts	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
true	c
.	c

This	c
is	c
a	c
very	c
disappointing	c
thing	c
!	c

Then	c
your	i
theatre	i
restaurant	i
after	i
the	i
show	i
was	c
closed	c
because	c
the	c
staff	c
were	c
not	c
there	c
;	c
so	c
we	c
could	c
not	c
visit	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

Kim	c
,	c
her	c
friend	c
,	c
used	c
to	c
go	c
camping	c
at	c
Sunset	c
Village	c
every	c
year	c
,	c
and	c
that	c
year	c
Kim	c
,	i
asked	c
Pat	c
to	c
come	c
with	c
her	c
.	c

She	c
accepted	c
.	c

But	c
one	c
night	c
,	c
with	c
the	c
moon	i
light	i
,	c
they	c
felt	c
encouraged	c
to	c
continue	c
their	c
walk	c
.	c

The	c
star	c
,	c
the	c
actor	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
there	i
was	c
n't	c
in	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
but	c
there	c
was	c
an	i
other	i
actor	c
,	c
with	i
my	i
great	i
disappoint	i
.	c

Your	i
Sincerely	c

Pat	c
was	c
very	c
excited	c
about	c
this	c
.	c

Dear	c
manager	c
,	c

The	c
advirtisement	i
I	c
had	c
read	c
did	c
not	c
match	i
the	c
performance	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
was	c
not	c
starring	c
and	c
was	c
replaced	c
by	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
unpleasantly	c
amazed	i
no	i
discounts	c
were	c
available	c
.	c

According	c
to	c
the	c
advertisement	c
,	c
I	c
could	c
visit	c
it	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
lack	c
of	c
customers	c
.	c

My	c
"	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
"	c
was	c
not	c
so	c
perfect	c
and	c
could	c
not	c
satisfy	c
me	c
in	c
any	c
way	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

Modern	c
technology	c
has	c
variety	i
of	c
uses	c
and	c
its	c
possibilities	c
are	c
being	c
widened	c
more	c
and	c
more	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
completely	c
satisfied	c
with	c
the	c
way	c
I	c
spend	c
my	c
freetime	i
,	c
but	c
they	c
have	c
another	c
opinion	c
.	c

The	c
list	c
of	c
activities	c
that	c
you	c
have	c
is	c
very	c
interesting	c
so	c
my	c
choice	c
was	c
very	c
difficult	c
to	c
make	c
but	c
I	c
have	c
finally	c
decided	c
to	c
chose	i
sailing	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
sailing	c
for	c
five	c
years	c
now	c
and	c
enjoy	c
it	c
very	c
much	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

What	c
you	c
expect	c
when	c
you	c
go	c
shopping	c
,	c
generally	c
with	c
a	c
friend	c
or	c
two	c
,	c
is	c
wandering	i
around	c
and	c
looking	i
at	c
everything	c
.	c

Having	c
money	c
and	c
be	i
able	c
to	c
spend	c
it	c
in	i
anything	c
you	c
want	c
is	c
brilliant	c
therefore	c
you	c
try	c
to	c
turn	c
it	c
in	i
an	c
enjoyable	c
moment	i
.	c

Then	c
,	c
you	c
decide	c
to	c
wait	c
for	c
the	c
savings	i
but	c
it	i
is	i
even	c
worse	c
as	c
everybody	c
want	i
to	c
do	c
their	c
shopping	c
at	c
that	c
time	c
and	c
the	c
streets	c
are	c
so	c
crowded	c
you	c
cannot	c
even	c
look	c
for	c
your	c
favourite	c
items	c
.	c

You	c
are	c
hot	c
in	c
the	c
shops	c
,	c
feel	c
annoyed	c
and	c
most	c
of	c
the	c
time	c
cannot	c
find	c
anything	c
you	c
wanted	i
.	c

To	c
conclude	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
say	c
that	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
nice	c
moment	i
shopping	c
you	c
had	c
better	c
to	i
save	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
money	c
and	c
buy	c
something	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
you	c
see	c
it	c
or	c
be	c
very	c
patient	c
.	c

Then	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
explain	c
to	c
you	c
about	i
The	i
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
.	c

I	c
did	c
not	c
have	c
any	c
choice	c
since	c
my	c
brother	c
was	c
in	c
trouble	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
got	c
close	c
to	c
the	c
shop	c
,	c
I	c
checked	c
if	c
anyone	c
was	c
around	c
and	c
luckily	c
was	i
not	i
.	c

Then	c
I	c
approached	c
slowly	i
the	i
door	i
,	c
broke	c
the	c
lock	c
and	c
opened	c
the	c
door	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
my	c
adventure	c
was	c
not	c
over	c
yet	c
.	c

Suddenly	c
something	c
went	c
wrong	c
,	i
the	i
alarm	c
was	c
making	c
noise	i

think	c
,	i
that	c

may	i
shopping	i
next	i
day	c
,	c
on	c
wednesday	i
,	c
in	c
our	c
free	c
time	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

Thinking	c
about	c
home	c
like	i
a	c
place	c
to	c
live	c
,	i
is	i
not	i
already	i
worth	i
.	c

What	c
depends	c
on	c
us	c
,	c
is	c
how	i
atmospher	i
we	c
will	c
have	c
in	c
our	c
houses	c
.	c

I	c
can	c
gladly	c
give	c
you	c
some	c
information	c
which	c
you	c
need	c

Moreover	c
,	c
it	c

be	c
more	c
exciting	c
for	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
wonderful	c
chance	i
for	c
me	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
my	c
favourite	c
group	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
able	c
to	c
have	c
some	c
signatures	i
of	i
them	c
.	c

Especially	i
,	c
I	c
liked	c
cleaning	c
the	c
stage	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
could	c
stand	c
a	i
famouse	i
singer	c
's	c
stage	c
and	c
I	c
could	c
feel	c
his	c
enthusiasm	c
,	c
even	c
though	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
clean	c
it	c
