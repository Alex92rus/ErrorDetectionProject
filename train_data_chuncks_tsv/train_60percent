Dear	c
Manager	c
,	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
your	c
theatre	c
and	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
that	c
I	c
saw	c
last	c
week	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
starting	i
time	c
was	c
19:30	c
but	c
it	c
started	c
20:15	c
so	c
I	c
was	c
waited	i
for	c
45	c
minutes	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
so	i
long	c
time	c
to	c
wait	c
in	c
the	c
theatre	c
.	c

Thirdly	c
,	c
it	c
mentioned	c
about	c
discounts	c
.	c

Despite	c
of	i
the	c
fact	c
that	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
student	c
,	c
I	c
could	c
not	c
get	c
any	c
discounts	c
.	c

I	c
also	c
visited	c
your	c
restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
but	c
already	i
closed	c
because	c
the	c
show	c
finished	c
late	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
you	c
to	c
refund	c
,	c
otherwise	c
,	c
I	c
will	c
take	c
an	i
action	c
.	c

Sincerely	c

People	c
will	c
wear	c
this	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
100	c
years	c
later	i
from	c
now	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
T-shirts	c
for	c
women	c
are	i
included	i
bra	i
:	c
easy	c
to	c
take	c
it	c
out	c
when	c
you	c
wash	c
it	c
,	c
is	i
very	c
simple	c
and	c
comfortable	c
.	c

You	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
to	c
wear	c
knickers	c
.	c

We	c
ca	c
n't	c
feel	c
it	c
and	c
easy	c
to	c
remove	c
and	c
just	c
can	i
wash	c
it	c
.	c

Simplest	c
is	c
the	c
best	c
in	c
summer	c
!	c

When	c
it	c
's	c
very	c
cold	c
winter	i
,	c
we	c
just	c
wear	c
light	c
clothes	c
what	i
we	i
want	i
,	c
in	c
our	c
style	c
.	c

Because	c
special	c
warm	c
and	c
healthy	c
material	c
will	c
be	c
developed	c
and	c
use	i
them	i
inside	c
thin	c
clothes	c
so	c
we	c
do	c
n't	c
need	c
to	c
put	c
heavy	c
clothes	c
on	c
our	c
bodies	c
.	c

Most	c
important	c
thing	c
is	c
that	c
we	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
to	c
kill	c
the	i
animals	c
only	i
for	c
people	c
's	c
cruel	c
aims	c
.	c

Functions	i
'	i
clothes	i
are	i
the	i
way	i
to	i
love	i
animals	i

To	c
Mr.	c
Robertson	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
something	c
about	c
the	c
three-day	c
trip	c
to	c
London	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
seen	c
your	c
programme	c
for	c
the	c
trip	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
a	c
great	c
trip	c
.	c

Personally	c
,	c
I	c
enjoy	c
looking	c
and	i
learning	c
about	c
new	c
inventions	c
and	c
all	c
the	c
science	c
.	c

That	c
is	c
why	c
I	c
think	c
the	c
trip	c
to	c
the	c
science	c
museum	c
is	c
a	c
good	c
idea	c
.	c

We	c
are	c
attracted	c
to	c
this	c
show	c
and	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
on	c
14th	c
March	c
,	c
which	c
is	c
the	c
day	c
we	c
will	c
be	c
visiting	c
the	c
science	c
museum	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
in	c
the	c
Central	c
Exhibition	c
Hall	c
and	c
will	c
start	c
and	i
ten	c
o'clock	c
and	c
finish	c
at	c
five	c
o'clock	c
in	c
the	c
evening	c
.	c

Apparently	c
,	c
this	c
show	c
is	c
free	c
to	c
all	c
students	c
,	c
which	c
means	c
if	c
we	c
went	c
,	c
the	c
cost	c
of	c
the	c
trip	c
will	i
be	c
cut	i
down	i
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
based	c
on	c
fashion	c
.	c

We	c
like	c
to	c
keep	c
up	c
with	c
the	c
rage	i
but	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
will	c
help	c
those	c
who	c
want	c
to	c
become	c
a	i
fashion	c
designer	i
later	c
on	c
.	c

The	c
shopping	c
time	c
could	c
be	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
and	c
the	c
free	c
time	c
exchanged	c
for	c
the	c
science	c
museum	c
.	c

If	c
we	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
we	c
can	c
do	c
without	c
the	c
free	c
time	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

In	c
a	c
country	c
like	c
the	c
UK	c
,	c
we	c
are	c
all	c
bound	c
to	c
have	c
houses	c
.	c

We	c
either	c
own	c
it	c
,	c
or	c
we	c
simply	c
borrow	c
it	c
from	c
other	c
people	c
.	c

We	c
take	c
our	c
homes	c
for	c
granted	c
.	c

Think	c
about	c
the	c
people	c
in	c
the	c
poor	c
countries	c
!	c

They	c
struggle	c
to	c
survive	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
as	c
we	c
approach	c
the	c
future	c
,	c
our	c
homes	c
will	c
start	c
to	c
change	c
.	c

Have	c
you	c
ever	c
thought	c
about	c
how	c
the	c
changes	c
will	c
affect	c
our	c
lives	c
?	c

I	c
doubt	c
it	c
.	c

There	c
will	c
be	c
lots	c
of	c
differences	c
in	c
our	c
homes	c
of	c
the	c
future	c
from	c
our	c
homes	c
now	c
,	c
but	c
there	c
may	c
also	c
be	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
similarities	c
.	c

For	c
one	c
,	c
the	c
future	c
homes	i
might	c
not	c
be	c
built	c
out	c
of	c
bricks	c
at	c
all	c
!	c

It	c
may	c
be	c
built	c
out	c
of	c
a	c
stronger	c
substance	c
or	c
a	c
more	c
attractive	c
one	c
,	c
such	c
as	c
glass	c
.	c

Non-breakable	c
glass	c
.	c

Also	c
,	c
due	c
to	c
global	c
warming	c
,	c
sea	c
levels	c
might	c
rise	c
and	c
risk	i
of	c
flooding	c
will	c
also	c
rise	c
.	c

Therefore	c
,	c
houses	c
will	c
be	c
built	c
on	c
high	c
supports	c
.	c

Incredibly	c
high	c
security	c
will	c
prevent	c
robbery	c
.	c

What	c
do	c
you	c
think	c
will	c
happen	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
?	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
only	c
six	c
countries	c
were	c
represented	c
this	c
year	c
at	c
the	c
festival	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
hope	c
that	c
soon	c
there	c
would	i
be	i
much	i
more	c
of	c
them	c
.	c

I	c
extremely	i
liked	c
all	c
concerts	i
,	c
shows	c
,	c
exhibitions	i
,	c
but	c
why	c
there	i
were	i
n't	i
any	c
photograph	i
exhibitions	c
?	c

Then	i
,	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
say	c
,	i
that	c
plays	i
and	c
films	c
were	c
exellent	i
,	c
but	c
it	i
was	i
n't	i
enough	c
of	c
them	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

And	c
at	i
the	i
end	i
,	c
my	c
opinion	c
is	c
that	c
one	c
weekend	c
ticket	c
for	c
all	c
events	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
idea	c
,	c
because	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
to	c
stay	i
in	c
queues	c
to	c
buy	c
a	c
ticket	c
for	c
a	c
show	c
,	i
you	c
want	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
.	c

Dear	c
Lucia	c
,	c

As	c
you	c
know	c
,	c
I	c
'm	c
studying	c
at	c
the	i
private	c
Academy	c
,	c
so	c
the	c
rules	c
in	c
my	c
institute	c
are	c
different	c
from	c
the	c
rules	c
in	c
state	c
institutes	c
.	c

So	c
nobody	c
smokes	c
there	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
smoke	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
care	c
about	c
this	c
rule	c
.	c

But	c
some	c
of	c
my	c
friends	c
really	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
change	c
it	c
.	c

You	c
also	c
wanted	c
to	c
know	c
about	c
what	c
I	c
'm	c
allowed	c
or	c
not	c
allowed	c
to	c
do	c
at	c
home	c
.	c

The	c
only	c
rule	c
for	c
me	c
at	c
home	c
is	c
to	c
walk	c
out	i
with	i
my	c
dog	c
three	c
times	c
a	c
day	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
it	c
was	c
interesting	c
for	c
you	c
to	c
know	c
about	c
the	c
rules	c
in	c
my	c
life	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
,	c

I	c
was	i
to	c
Circle	i
Theatre	c
to	c
watch	c
'	i
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
'	c
musical	c
show	c
,	c
recently	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
trully	i
dissapointed	i
by	c
it	c
.	c

My	c
expectations	c
were	c
high	c
after	c
I	i
've	i
read	c
your	c
leaflet	c
in	c
which	c
it	c
was	c
advertised	c
as	c
'	c
London	c
's	c
newest	c
and	c
best	c
musical	c
show	c
'	c
.	c

Now	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
assure	c
you	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
who	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
star	c
.	c

The	c
substitute	c
was	c
far	c
worse	c
.	c

There	c
were	c
n't	c
any	c
!	c

You	c
can	c
believe	c
me	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
'	c
my	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
'	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
no	c
other	c
choice	c
than	c
asking	i
to	i
give	c
my	i
money	c
back	c
.	c

I	c
paid	c
for	c
something	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
get	c
so	c
it	c
is	c
obvious	c
that	c
I	c
want	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

I	c
got	c
the	c
Â£	c
15	c
ticket	c
.	c

I	c
'd	c
like	c
you	c
to	c
send	c
the	c
money	c
to	c
this	c

two	c
days	c

ran	c
out	c
quickly	c

He	c
felt	c
very	c

did	c

What	c

you	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c

It	c
is	c
a	c
dream	i
becames	i
true	i
and	c
was	c
really	c
unexpected	c
for	c
me	c
!	c

About	c
the	c
activities	c
while	c
at	c
the	c
Camp	c
I	i
would	c
like	c
to	c
enjoy	i
swimming	c
,	c
not	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
good	c
in	i
it	c
,	c
just	c
because	c
I	c
keen	i
on	c
and	i
the	c
other	c
one	c
is	c
Photography	c
.	c

As	c
I	c
never	c
did	c
this	c
in	c
whole	i
my	i
life	c
could	c
you	c
tell	c
me	c
if	c
we	c
have	c
to	c
do	i
our	c
own	c
meals	c
or	c
I	i
can	i
find	c
everything	c
ready	c
to	c
eat	c
there	c
?	c

Yours	c

Everything	c
were	i
new	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
to	c
(	i
lyd	i
)	i
tidy	c
up	c
the	c
place	c
where	c
they	c
have	c
to	c
wait	c
until	i
their	c
turn	c
.	c

The	c
group	c
asked	c
me	c
make	i
sure	c
that	c
in	c
the	c
fridge	c
they	c
always	c
could	c
find	c
a	c
big	i
variety	c
of	c
drinks	c
including	c
honey	c
and	c
lemon	c
for	c
throat	i
.	c

Other	i
thing	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
is	i
keep	c
an	c
eye	c
in	i
the	c
towels	c
,	c
I	c
mean	c
,	c
dried	i
towels	c
because	c
as	c
you	c
know	c
that	c
country	c
is	c
too	c
hot	c
,	c
especially	c
for	c
my	c
liking	c
,	c
as	i
they	c
have	c
to	c
change	c
the	i
clothes	c
and	c
looks	i
fresh	c
;	c
do	c
n't	c
ask	c
me	c
why	c
.	c

I	c
just	c
did	c
not	c
enjoyed	i
when	i
they	c
were	c
making	i
the	i
instruments	i
work	c
for	c
the	c
big	c
day	c
.	c

But	c
what	c
I	c
particularly	c
liked	c
was	c
see	i
and	i
ask	i
autographs	i
from	i
the	i

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
with	c
regard	c
to	c
the	c
International	c
Art	c
Festival	c
that	c
was	c
held	c
recently	c
.	c

The	c
festival	c
was	c
excenent	i
in	c
many	c
ways	c
,	c
and	c
especially	i
it	c
being	c
an	c
international	c
festival	c
was	c
a	c
challenging	c
,	c
but	c
brilliant	c
idea	c
.	c

I	c
personally	c
think	c
that	c
it	c
helped	c
many	c
people	c
who	c
were	c
not	c
able	c
to	c
afford	c
the	c
tickets	c
with	i
proper	i
price	c
to	c
come	c
to	c
the	c
festival	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
most	c
of	c
the	c
events	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
were	c
fantastic	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
still	c
have	c
some	c
comments	c
to	c
make	c
to	c
improve	c
the	c
festival	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

The	c
festival	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
be	c
an	c
international	c
one	c
,	c
but	c
the	c
artists	c
and	c
stars	c
participated	i
in	c
it	c
were	c
from	c
six	c
countries	c
only	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
much	c
better	c
to	c
use	c
bigger	c
concert	c
halls	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
I	c
found	c
that	c
there	c
were	c
not	c
many	c
genres	c
of	i
neither	i
the	i
films	i
nor	i
the	c
plays	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
suggest	c
you	c
have	c
various	c
kinds	c
,	c
and	c
more	c
numbers	i
of	i
plays	c
and	c
films	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
that	c
next	c
year	c
's	c
festival	c
will	c
be	c
much	c
more	c
successful	c
that	i
this	c
year	c
's	c
one	c
.	c

The	c
Old	c
Man	c
and	c
the	c
Sea	c

Some	c
prefer	c
realistic	c
stories	c
whereas	c
others	c
do	i
unusual	c
ones	c
.	c

Here	c
,	c
the	c
fishman	c
is	c
very	c
old	c
,	c
but	c
he	c
is	c
still	c
challenging	c
to	i
everything	c
he	c
faces	c
.	c

When	c
he	c
caught	c
a	c
shark	c
which	c
was	c
bigger	c
than	c
the	c
ship	c
,	c
he	c
never	c
gave	c
up	c
taking	i
it	c
back	c
to	c
his	c
village	c
,	c
even	c
when	c
sharks	c
were	c
around	c
him	c
.	c

Real	c
stories	c
have	c
huge	c
impacts	c
on	c
me	c
,	c
and	c
affect	c
me	c
a	c
lot	c
,	c
often	c
in	c
good	c
ways	c
.	c

But	c
,	c
while	c
reading	c
realistic	c
stories	c
,	c
I	c
just	c
fall	c
deep	c
into	c
the	c
story	c
,	c
into	c
the	c
writer	c
's	c
own	c
world	c
.	c

So	c
when	c
I	c
read	c
other	i
sharks	c
eating	c
the	c
shark	c
the	c
old	c
man	c
had	c
caught	c
,	c
I	c
got	c
very	c
angry	c
and	c
annoyed	c
.	c

Realistic	c
stories	c
thus	c
,	c
develop	c
our	c
imagination	c
and	c
creativity	c
,	c
which	c
are	c
essential	c
in	c
our	c
lives	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
a	c
musical	c
show	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
disappointing	i
a	i
week	i
holiday	c
for	i
me	i
because	c
I	c
had	c
got	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
problem	i
with	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
asked	i
for	c
the	c
discount	c
of	i
ticket	i
in	i
the	c
cashier	c
desk	c
they	c
told	c
me	c
no	c
discount	c
available	i
for	i
this	i
.	c

I	c
had	c
seen	c
the	c
advertisement	c
say	i
that	c
discount	i
available	i
.	c

It	c
closed	c
at	c
10	c
pm	c
but	c
the	c
show	c
finished	c
at	c
10.30	c
pm	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hear	i
a	i
good	c
new	i
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	i
,	c

The	c
atmosphere	c
in	i
the	c
earth	c
now	i
starting	i
badly	c
every	c
years	i
.	c

The	c
carbon	i
dioxide	c
are	i
growing	c
very	c
fast	c
and	c
people	c
cut	c
more	i
trees	c
,	c
therefore	c
not	i
enough	c
trees	c
to	c
such	i
carbon	c
dioxide	c
and	c
produce	c
oxygen	c
.	c

The	c
designer	i
will	c
have	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
idea	i
for	i
how	c
to	c
make	c
very	c
nice	c
and	c
useful	c
clothes	c
.	c

I	i
think	i
if	i
we	i
wear	i
this	i
clothes	i
we	i
will	i
travel	i
to	i
every	i
where	i
easier	i
than	i
we	i
use	i
cars	i
,	i
ships	i
,	i
planes	i
and	i
space	i
ships	i
.	c

This	i
mean	i
the	i
engineering	i
will	i
find	i
the	i
way	i
to	i
useless	i
petrol	i
for	i
it	i
,	i
so	i
it	i
must	i
useful	i
in	i
the	i
future	i
.	c

I	c
think	c
somebody	c
will	c
make	i
a	c
very	c
big	c
area	c
to	c
grow	c
plant	i
because	i
they	c
can	c
sell	c
the	c
oxygen	c

FOR	i
THE	c
DISAPPOINTING	c
EVENING	c
I	c
HAD	c
LAST	c
NIGHT	c
.	c

FIRST	c
OF	c
ALL	c
ON	i
THE	c
ADVERTISEMENT	c
FOR	c
THE	c
SHOW	c
IT	c
SAYS	i
THAT	c
THE	c
ACTOR	c
WAS	c
GOING	c
TO	c
BE	c
DANNY	c
BROOK	c
AND	c
INSTEAD	c
OF	c
HIM	c
WAS	i
A	c
TOTALLY	c
UNKNOWN	c
CLOWN	c
THAT	c
HAD	c
NO	c
IDEA	c
OF	c
HOW	c
TO	c
ACT	c
,	i
IT	c
WAS	c
HORRIBLY	c
DISAPPOINTING	c
!	c

SECOND	c
I	c
GOT	c
TO	c
THE	c
THEATRE	c
AT	c
19.20	c
BECAUSE	c
IN	c
THE	c
ADVERTISEMENT	c
IT	c
CLEARLY	c
APPEARS	i
THAT	c
THE	c
SHOW	c
STARTS	c
AT	c
19.30	c
,	c
AND	c
I	c
GOT	c
HEAVILY	i
MAD	c
WHEN	c
I	c
LOOK	i
MY	i
WATCH	c
AND	c
NOTICE	i
THAT	c
I	c
HAD	c
BEEN	c
WAITING	c
FOR	c
40	c
(	c
FORTY	c
)	c
MINUTES	c
AND	c
THE	c
SHOW	c
DID	i
N'T	i
START	i
YET	c
...	c

I	c
MEAN	c
I	i
WAS	c

THEN	c
I	c
READ	c
ON	i
THE	c
ADVERTISEMENT	c
,	c
DISCOUNTS	i
AVAILABLE	c
,	i
AND	c
I	c
DID	c
N'T	c
GOT	i
ANY	c
DISCOUNTS	c
WHEN	c
I	c
ASKED	c
FOR	c
THEM	c
.	c

IT	c
WAS	c
CLOSED	c
!	c

I	c
COULD	c
N'T	c
BELIVE	i
IT	c
HOW	i
THIS	i

CAN	i
BE	c
SO	c

HAD	c
EVER	c
GOT	i
SO	c
I	c
DEMEND	i
FOR	i
MY	c
MONEY	c
BACK	c

I	c
THINK	c
THAT	c
MODERN	c
TECHNOLOGY	c
HAS	c
AFFECTED	c
ALL	c
THE	i

MODERN	c

ANOTHER	c
EXAMPLE	c
IS	c
THE	i
COMPUTERS	c
,	i
I	c
THINK	c
THEY	c
ARE	c
ONE	i
OF	c
THE	c
MOST	c
ADVANCED	c
MACHINE	i
IN	c
THE	c
WORLD	c
,	i
YOU	c

I	c

IT	c
'S	c
INCREDIBLE	c

Dear	c
Ms	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
reply	c
your	i
letter	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
so	c
glad	i
to	c
win	i
the	c
prize	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
!	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
tents	c
to	c
log	c
cabins	c
.	c

Camping	c
is	c
my	c
enthusiasm	i
and	c
I	c
sleep	c
in	c
tents	c
every	c
time	c
I	c
go	c
camping	c
.	c

Therefore	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
afraid	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
get	c
used	c
to	c
log	c
cabins	c
easily	c
.	c

Besides	c
camping	c
,	c
I	c
also	c
like	c
painting	c
.	c

My	c
Dad	c
is	c
an	c
amateur	c
painter	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
begun	i
painting	c
for	c
8	c
years	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
good	c
at	c
portraits	c
and	c
landscapes	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
also	c
like	c
to	c
play	c
golf	c
during	c
my	c
holiday	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
played	c
it	c
before	c
,	i
will	i
I	c
get	c
any	c
tuition	c
?	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
should	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
some	c
questions	c
.	c

How	i
is	c
the	c
weather	c
like	c
in	c
California	c
in	c
July	c
?	c

What	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
should	c
I	c
pack	c
?	c

If	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
buy	c
some	c
gifts	c
,	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
should	c
I	c
take	c
and	c
can	c
I	c
use	c
traveller	c
's	c
cheques	c
in	c
every	c
place	c
?	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c

Our	c
lives	c
are	c
getting	c
better	c
and	c
better	c
,	c
so	c
people	c
began	i
to	c
go	c
shopping	c
more	c
frequently	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
always	c
a	c
great	c
job	i
to	c
go	c
home	c
with	c
bags	c
of	c
purchases	c
,	c
but	c
is	c
it	c
doing	c
us	c
good	i
apart	c
from	c
the	c
temporary	c
satisfaction	c
?	c

Everyone	c
likes	c
sale	i
,	c
but	c
those	c
so-called	c
sale	c
items	c
are	c
not	c
really	c
of	i
value	c
.	c

But	c
you	c
'll	c
find	c
your	c
'	c
cool	c
bargain	c
'	c
soon	c
get	i
out	c
of	c
date	c
and	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
keep	c
buying	c
new	c
ones	c
.	c

Also	c
supermarket	c
owners	c
have	c
put	i
in	i
a	c
vast	c
amount	c
of	c
money	c
to	c
find	c
out	c
the	c
best	c
way	c
to	c
place	c
goods	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
get	c
the	c
most	c
profit	c
.	c

The	c
result	c
,	i
we	i
feel	c
guilty	c
after	c
spending	c
more	c
than	c
we	i
've	i
estimated	i
,	c
or	c
even	c
suffer	c
from	c
financial	c
difficulty	c
.	c

Shopping	c
does	c
not	c
just	c
effect	i
us	c
mentally	c
,	c
but	c
also	c
physically	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
not	c
hard	c
to	c
realise	c
how	c
exhausted	c
we	c
are	c
after	c
a	c
day	c
of	c
shopping	c
.	c

Think	c
of	c
the	c
awful	c
crowds	c
,	c
the	c
busy	c
car	c
parks	c
,	c
polluted	c
air	c
in	c
the	c
city	c
centres	c
and	c
mile-long	c
queues	c
in	c
front	c
of	c
the	c
cash	c
desks	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
think	c
anyone	c
would	i
really	i
like	i
to	c
face	c
them	c
.	c

But	c
once	c
you	c
get	c
there	c
,	c
they	c
're	c
just	c
inevitable	c
,	c
are	c
n't	c
they	c
?	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
suggest	c
to	i
you	i
something	c
that	c
the	c
students	c
saw	c
in	c
an	c
advertisement	c

It	i
's	i
seems	i

chat	c
about	c
ours	i
next	c
holiday	c
at	i
the	c
free	c
time	c
in	c
the	c
afternoon	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	i
,	c

Freedom	c
!	c

It	c
is	c
really	c
interesting	c
how	c
people	c
like	c
knowing	i
famous	i
people	i
life	i
.	c

Famous	c
people	c
deserve	c
to	c
have	c
freedom	c
to	c
do	c
whatever	c
they	c
want	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
is	c
quite	c
difficult	c
to	c
do	c
thing	i
in	c
a	i
public	c
places	c
,	c
because	c
nobody	c
like	i
famous	i
politicians	c
or	c
film	c
stars	c
without	c
asking	c
questions	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
that	i
evening	i
there	i
was	i
not	i
Danny	i
Brook	i
but	c
an	c
unknown	c
and	c
not	c
very	c
good	c
actor	c
.	c

Then	c
at	c
the	c
tickets-office	i
I	c
was	c
said	i
that	c
no	c
discounts	c
were	c
available	c
so	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
pay	c
the	c
full	c
prize	i
despite	c
I	i
am	c
a	c
student	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
really	c
not	c
satisfied	c
with	c
the	c
show-organization	i
particularly	c
because	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
you	c
wrote	c
something	c
different	i
.	c

For	c
this	c
reason	c
I	c
expect	c
to	c
receive	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secret	i
.	c

Last	c
week	c
we	c
had	c
another	c
demostration	i
of	c
this	c
.	c

Each	c
of	c
us	c
had	c
a	c
different	c
task	c
.	c

Anna	c
prepared	i
the	c
cake	c
,	c
Peter	c
organized	c
the	c
music	c
,	c
Heather	c
and	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
buy	c
the	c
present	c
;	c
Pat	c
said	c
:	c
"	c
OK	c
I	i
'll	c
phone	c
to	i
some	c
of	c
Ted	c
's	c
friends	c
to	c
invite	c
them	c
"	c
.	c

Obviously	c
Ted	c
should	c
have	i
known	c
nothing	i
about	c
it	c
and	c
we	c
remembered	i
it	i
to	i
Pat	i
twice	c
:	c
"	c
the	i
party	c
is	c
a	c
secret	c
!	c
!	c
"	c
and	c
she	c
said	c
:	c
"	c
Yes	c
,	c
it	c
must	c
be	c
a	c
surprise	c
!	c
"	c

On	c
Tuesday	c
afternoon	c
we	c
met	c
to	c
prepare	i
the	c
last	c
details	c
;	c
Pat	c
said	c
:	c
"	c
I	c
've	c
just	c
phoned	c
to	i
Tommy	c
,	c
Billy	c
and	c
Alison	c
and	c
I	c
met	c
Ted	c
yesterday	c
evening	c
:	c
they	c
all	c
have	c
said	c
ok	i
for	c
the	c
party..	c
"	c

In	i
that	c
moment	c
she	c
understood	c
that	c
something	c
was	c
wrong	c
!	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
,	c

We	c
have	c
seen	c
an	c
advertisement	c
of	i
last	c
Saturday	i
'	c
The	c
Times	c
'	c
edition	c
of	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
it	c
will	c
introduce	c
latest	i
fashions	c
connecting	i
Millenium	i
.	c

It	c
would	c
be	c
fantastic	i
opportunity	c
to	i
the	c
students	c
who	c
study	c
a	i
fashion	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
we	c
can	c
see	c
how	c
to	c
make	i
up	i
and	c
make	i
better	c
hairstyle	i
in	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

We	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
if	c
it	c
is	c
possible	c
to	c
change	c
your	c
programme	c
.	c

Yours	c
Sincerely	c
,	c

It	c
was	c
dangerous	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
knew	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
was	c
twenty	c
years	c
old	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
go	c
to	i
Army	i
.	c

As	c
you	c
know	c
,	c
my	c
country	c
has	c
been	c
separated	c
into	c
two	c
countries	c
(	c
South	c
and	c
North	c
Korea	c
)	c
.	c

One	c
year	c
later	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
working	c
in	c
Kang-nam	c
police	c
station	c
in	c
Seoul	c
.	c

Suddenly	c
,	c
the	c
theft	i
signal	i
came	c
into	i
.	c

So	c
,	c
another	c
policeman	c
and	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
arrive	c
at	c
the	c
accident	c
place	c
quickly	c
.	c

When	c
we	c
arrived	c
at	c
the	c
place	c
which	i
it	c
happened	c
,	c
one	c
man	c
started	c
running	c
away	c
.	c

Without	c
any	c
thought	c
,	c
I	c
ran	c
quickly	c
like	c
a	c
swallow	c
.	c

He	c
fell	c
down	c
and	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
stare	c
at	c
each	c
other	c
.	c

As	c
a	c
result	c
,	c
I	c
could	c
go	c
on	c
vacation	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
said	i
to	i
my	c
mother	c
,	c
she	c
asked	c
me	c
not	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
again	c
.	c

But	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
police-man	i
.	c

Dear	c
Competition	c
Organiser	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
replay	i
your	i
letter	c
and	c
to	c
ask	c
more	i
details	c
about	c
the	c
competition	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
I	c
'm	c
very	c
glad	c
to	c
have	c
been	c
choosen	i
and	c
I	c
will	c
do	c
my	c
best	c
for	c
this	c
competition	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
asked	c
in	c
the	c
letter	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
only	c
on	i
july	i
because	c
I	c
work	c
at	c
the	c
central	c
library	c
and	c
I	c
'm	c
also	c
having	c
English	c
classes	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
will	c
just	c
have	c
holidays	c
on	i
July	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
mentioned	c
about	c
the	c
accomodation	i
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
stay	i
in	c
the	i
tents	i
,	c
because	c
it	c
's	c
more	c
exciting	c
and	c
I	c
really	c
love	c
camping	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
choose	c
sailing	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
facinating	i
with	c
the	c
sea	c
and	c
it	i
's	i
misteries	i
and	c
I	c
also	c
like	c
the	c
watter	i
,	c
the	c
wind	c
in	c
my	c
face	c
...	c

The	c
other	c
one	c
I	c
would	c
choose	c
is	c
basketball	c
becouse	i
I	c
'm	c
tall	c
and	c
very	c
fast	c
with	c
the	c
ball	c
.	c

Finally	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
are	i
we	i
supposed	c
to	c
wear	c
there	c
,	c
and	c
about	c
the	c
money	c
we	c
are	c
supposed	c
to	i
pay	c
for	c
food	c
and	c
things	c
like	c
that	c
.	c

sincerely	c

Clara	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
some	c
news	c
and	c
to	c
ask	c
a	c
little	c
bit	c
about	c
you	c
.	c

Last	c
month	c
,	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
with	c
four	c
bands	c
.	i

It	c
was	c
unbelivebly	i
!	c
!	c
!	c

Although	c
it	i
was	i
5.000	i
thousand	c
people	c
there	c
,	c
people	c
could	c
walk	c
and	c
dance	c
without	c
any	c
problem	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
depressing	c
...	c

Clara	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
come	c
in	c
July	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
studying	c
English	c
and	c
we	c
have	c
one	i
month	i
break	c
at	i
July	c
,	c
so	c
please	c
make	i
my	i
log	i
cabin	i
ready	i
by	i
july	i
.	c

I	c
used	c
to	c
be	i
play	c
in	c
school	i
team	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
in	c
high	c
school	c
and	c
our	c
team	c
was	c
the	i
one	c
of	c
the	c
best	c
Basketball	i
team	i
in	c
all	i
county	c
and	c
I	c
also	i
very	c
good	c
at	c
swim	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
a	c
few	c
things	c
,	c
specialy	i
wheather	i
:	c
how	i
is	c
the	c
weather	c
in	i
July	c
in	c
the	c
U.S.A.	i
What	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	i
will	i
need	c
and	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	i
should	i
take	c
with	c
me	c
,	i
Because	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
been	c
U.S.A.	i
before	c
and	i
I	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
anything	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
your	c
reply	i
letter	i
.	c

I	c
have	c
never	c
enjoyed	c
doing	c
shopping	c
,	c
but	c
nowday	i
some	i
people	c
are	i
calling	i
shopcholic	i
.	c

They	c
are	c
just	c
like	c
alcholics	i
and	c
this	i
people	c
are	i
every	i
day	i
doing	i
shopping	i
because	c
they	c
can	i
not	i
stop	c
themself	i
unless	c
they	c
have	c
not	c
got	c
money	c
for	i
spend	i
.	c

I	c
can	i
not	i
believe	c
how	c
they	c
doing	i
this	c
things	i
every	c
day	c
,	c
even	c
when	c
I	c
need	c
something	c
at	c
home	c
I	c
alway	i
try	c
to	c
find	c
out	i
something	c
to	c
use	c
instead	c
of	i
that	i
things	i
.	c

Because	c
nowdays	i
whereever	i
you	c
go	c
there	c
is	c
big	i
queue	c
and	c
I	c
hate	c
being	i
waited	i
.	c

The	c
queue	i
is	i
not	c
only	i
the	i
problem	i
if	i
you	c
go	c
by	c
car	c
there	c
is	c
parking	i
problem	i
,	c
if	c
you	c
go	c
by	c
bus	c
there	c
is	i
again	i
queue	i
and	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
carry	c
many	i
carry	i
bag	i
carrier	i
bags	i
during	c
the	i
your	c
journey	c
and	c
you	c
wo	c
n't	c
be	i
alway	i
luky	i
to	i
find	c
a	c
seat	c
to	i
seat	i
.	c

If	c
you	c
go	c
shopping	c
for	c
(	i
buy	i
)	i
clothes	c
that	c
is	c
the	c
worse	i
kind	c
of	c
shopping	c
.	c

Specialy	i
if	c
you	c
want	c
to	c
buy	c
with	i
your	c
girlfriend	c
or	c
if	c
you	c
are	c
already	i
girl	i
you	i
have	c
to	c
be	c
read	i
for	i
hours	i
to	i
spend	i
try	i
on	c
and	i
off	i
.	c

Some	c
people	c
says	i
"	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
alway	i
enjoyable	c
"	c
but	c
for	c
me	c
definity	i
unenjoyable	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
same	i
rest	i
of	c
my	c
life	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
,	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
when	c
I	c
had	i
bought	i
the	c
ticets	i
it	c
appeared	c
that	c
there	c
is	i
no	c
discount	c
available	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
must	c
say	c
that	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
very	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
get	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

Your	i
faithfully	c

Dora	c
wanted	c
me	c
to	c
come	c
with	c
Pat	c
because	c
she	c
was	c
in	c
love	c
with	c
him	c
.	c

I	c
really	c
like	c
Dora	c
and	c
Pat	c
and	c
I	c
just	c
wanted	c
to	c
help	c
them	c
to	c
be	c
together	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
such	c
a	c
good	c
idea	c
.	c

I	c
thought	c
that	c
if	c
I	c
said	c
something	c
specific	c
about	c
her	c
he	c
would	c
look	c
at	c
her	c
in	c
a	c
different	c
way	c
.	c

Well	c
,	c
I	c
forgot	c
that	c
it	c
's	c
just	c
a	c
boy	c
!	c

Yesterday	c
I	i
discovered	c
that	c
he	c
told	c
everything	c
to	c
Marl	c
and	c
Tony	c
.	c

Mr.	i
Manager	c
:	i

Firstly	c
when	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
show	c
it	c
was	c
writing	i
that	c
the	c
starting	i
time	c
was	c
19.30	c
but	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
quarter	c
past	c
eight	c
I	i
had	c
waitted	i
for	c
fourthey	i
five	i
minutes	c
.	c

Secondly	c
the	c
stars	c
were	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
DANNY	c
BROOK	c
and	c
TINA	c
TRUELOVE	c
but	c
different	c
people	c
came	c
to	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

And	c
as	i
last	i
that	c
was	c
the	c
worse	i
night	c
I	c
had	c
ever	c
had	c
so	c
I	c
asked	c
for	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
but	c
they	c
would	c
n't	c
give	c
it	i
so	c
I	c
had	c
an	c
argument	c
with	c
the	c
people	c
Who	i
worked	c
their	i
but	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
get	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

Because	c
last	c
year	c
I	c
started	c
smoking	c
and	c
nobody	c
knew	c
that	c
I	c
was	c
smoking	c
but	c
one	c
day	c
as	c
I	c
was	c
smoking	c
at	c
the	c
back	c
of	c
the	c
school	c
some	i
one	i
came	c
next	i
to	c
me	c
and	c
I	c
noticed	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
Pat	c
.	c

She	c
saw	c
me	c
as	c
I	c
was	c
smoking	c
so	c
that	c
was	c
n't	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
very	c
good	c
.	c

She	c
said	c
that	c
she	c
would	c
n't	c
tell	c
it	i
to	i
anyone	c
but	c
I	c
knew	c
she	c
might	c
say	c
it	c
to	c
someone	c
so	c
I	c
always	i
was	i
with	c
her	c
very	i
minute	c
ever	i
second	c
.	c

But	c
one	c
day	c
as	c
I	c
was	c
walking	c
home	c
like	c
every	c
night	c
I	c
saw	c
Pat	c
at	i
the	i
front	i
of	i
our	c
house	c
door	c
talking	c
to	c
my	c
dad	c
.	c

I	c
just	c
knew	c
I	c
could	i
n't	i
have	c
trusted	c
to	i
her	c
but	c
as	c
I	c
went	c
in	c
the	c
house	c
my	c
dad	c
offered	i
pot	i
to	c
stay	c
for	c
meal	i
I	i
was	c
in	c
a	i
schock	i
thinking	i
why	c
is	c
n't	c
anyone	c
getting	c
angry	c
to	i
me	i
after	i
a	c
while	c
we	c
sat	c
for	i
dinner	c
and	c
Pat	c
just	c
talk	i
my	c
parents	c
that	c
I	c
was	c
smoking	c
and	c
when	c
my	c
family	c
heard	c
they	c
got	c
ever	c
so	c
angry	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
n't	c
go	c
out	c
of	c
the	c
house	c
for	c
a	c
month	c
so	c
now	c
I	c
know	c
how	c
Pat	c
is	c
and	c
ca	i
n't	c
keep	c
any	c
secrets	c
.	c

Dear	c

keen	c
on	c
theatre	c
and	c
musical	c
show	i
.	c

Anyway	c
we	c
had	c
a	c
very	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
.	c

At	i
first	i
,	c
we	c
could	c
n't	c
get	c
any	i
discount	c
,	c
although	c
you	c
mention	c
it	c
on	i
your	c
advertisment	i
.	c

And	c
the	c
only	c
tickets	c
left	c
were	c
at	i
Â£	c
20	c
.	c

Then	c
the	c
spectacle	i
began	c
45	c
minutes	c
later	c
than	c
mentioned	i
.	c

Afterwards	i
we	i
are	c
used	c
to	c
eat	i
at	c
your	c
restaurant	c
which	c
is	c
not	c
only	c
well	c
known	c
for	c
it	c
's	c
good	c
price	i
value	c
but	c
also	c
for	c
it	c
's	c
original	c
decoration	i
.	c

yours	c
faithfully	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
really	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

I	c
left	c
the	c
office	c
at	c
six	c
o'clock	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
free	c
as	c
the	c
air	c
.	c

My	c
husband	c
was	c
following	i
a	c
course	c
all	c
the	i
week	c
in	c
Berne	c
.	c

The	c
kids	c
were	c
by	i
their	c
grandmother	c
,	c
who	c
take	i
care	c
of	c
them	c
.	c

I	c
drove	c
to	c
Ouchy	c
where	c
I	c
took	i
a	c
drink	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
so	c
hot	c
,	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
go	c
for	c
a	c
swim	c
in	c
tutry	c
,	c
although	c
I	c
had	c
n't	c
any	i
swimming-clothes	i
.	c

I	c
knew	c
a	c
good	c
place	c
.	c

I	c
parked	c
the	c
car	c
and	c
went	i
ten	c
minuts	i
.	c

As	c
I	c
had	c
planed	i
,	c
the	c
place	c
was	c
deserted	c
.	c

I	c
took	c
my	c
clothes	c
of	i
and	c
swam	c
twenty	i
minutes	c
in	c
the	c
lake	c
.	c

I	c
walked	c
back	c
,	c
hoping	c
I	c
would	c
n't	c
come	c
accross	i
anyone	c
and	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
drive	c
back	c
home	c
.	c

The	c
car	c
was	c
missing	c
too	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
a	c
police	c
car	c
drove	c
by	c
and	c
the	c
policeman	c
saw	c
me	c
standing	c
there	c
nude	c
.	c

They	c
drove	c
me	c
to	c
their	c
office	c
after	c
having	c
given	c
me	c
use	i
of	i
their	i
shirt	c
.	c

There	c
I	c
called	c
Pat	c
who	c
picked	c
me	c
up	c
.	c

Of	c
course	c
she	c
told	c
everything	c
to	c
my	c
husband	c
.	c

If	c
only	c
Pat	c
could	c
keep	c
secrets	c
!	c

In	i
the	i
name	i
of	i
the	c
class	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
the	c
excellent	c
programme	c
you	c
have	c
organised	c
,	c
especially	c
the	c
idea	c
of	c
visiting	c
a	c
galery	i
.	c

However	c
,	c
we	c
have	c
seen	c
an	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
It	i
would	i
be	i
on	c
the	c
13th	c
of	c
March	c
from	c
10.00	c
to	c
19.00	c
.	c

We	c
are	c
all	c
very	c
interested	c
in	c
the	c
show	c
because	c
England	i
people	c
have	c
a	c
different	c
kind	c
of	c
life	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
also	c
unusual	c
to	c
have	c
such	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
in	c
our	c
country	c
.	c

Could	i
it	c
be	c
possible	c
to	c
cancel	c
the	c
museum	c
and	c
the	c
shopping	c
time	i
and	c
to	c
replace	c
them	c
by	i
the	c
London	c
Show	c
?	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

It	c
was	c
dangerous	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
knew	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
always	c
wanted	c
to	c
swim	c
in	i
the	i
middle	i
of	i
sharks	c
.	c

I	c
lived	c
in	c
a	c
small	c
village	c
on	c
the	c
ocean	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
child	c
,	c
I	c
used	c
to	c
go	c
with	c
him	c
travelling	c
from	c
harbours	i
to	c
harbours	i
.	c

Once	c
I	c
was	c
fishing	c
,	i
when	c
sharks	c
came	i
all	c
around	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
got	c
the	c
strange	c
feeling	c
I	c
could	c
jump	c
and	c
follow	c
them	c
.	c

Since	c
this	c
famous	i
experience	c
,	c
I	c
dreamt	c
every	i
night	i
about	i
that	i
.	c

My	c
father	c
was	c
sitting	c
next	c
to	c
me	c
thinking	i
that	c
I	c
was	c
crazy	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

In	c
addition	c
to	c
this	c
you	c
started	c
the	c
show	c
45	c
minutes	c
late	c
.	c

How	c
could	c
we	c
appreciate	c
the	c
show	c
properly	c
.	c

Then	c
you	c
offered	i
people	c
to	c
visit	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
there	c
is	i
no	c
staff	c
to	c
welcome	c
the	i
people	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
your	i
understand	c
my	c
request	c
and	c
you	c
are	c
going	c
to	c
reply	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
.	c

yours	c
sincerely	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

I	c
though	i
she	c
was	c
a	c
really	c
good	c
friend	c
but	c
I	c
made	c
a	c
mistake	c
.	c

She	c
could	c
n't	c
keep	c
my	c
secret	c
and	c
everybody	c
knew	c
which	c
boy	c
I	c
was	c
in	c
love	c
with	c
.	c

I	c
followed	c
her	c
and	c
caught	c
her	c
to	c
push	c
her	c
on	i
the	c
ground	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
ready	c
to	c
fight	c
but	c
somebody	c
stopped	c
me	c
.	c

She	c
said	c
that	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
be	c
strong	c
and	c
did	i
n't	i
care	c
about	c
them	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
class	c
and	c
everybody	c
was	c
laughing	c
at	c
me	c
and	c
the	c
boy	c
told	c
them	c
to	c
stopped	i
because	c
he	c
loved	c
me	c
and	c
wanted	c
to	c
be	c
with	c
me	c
.	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
:	c

My	c
name	c
is	c
Julia	c
Sanches	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
now	c
writing	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
the	c
information	c
you	c
have	c
asked	c
about	i
me	c
:	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
on	i
July	c
because	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
on	c
my	c
school	c
vacation	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
would	c
not	c
miss	c
my	c
classes	c
.	c

I	c
play	c
Basketball	c
at	c
school	c
twice	c
a	c
week	c
and	c
I	c
enjoy	c
it	c
.	c

Although	c
I	c
do	c
not	c
play	c
perfectly	c
,	c
I	c
play	c
quite	c
well	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
would	c
still	c
like	c
to	c
practice	i
.	c

I	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
beach	c
almost	c
every	c
weekend	c
to	c
improve	c
my	c
surfing	c
-	c
it	c
is	c
the	c
sport	c
I	c
like	c
best	c
-	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
nice	c
oportunity	i
to	c
practice	i
surfing	c
too	c
.	c

There	c
are	c
some	c
things	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
:	i
the	c
tipe	i
(	c
and	c
quantity	c
)	c
of	c
Clothes	c
I	c
will	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
,	c
if	i
it	c
is	c
necessary	c
to	c
take	c
some	c
money	c
and	i
any	c
additional	c
stuff	c
(	c
like	c
raincoates	i
)	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
receiving	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

Since	c
we	c
are	i
kids	c
people	c
tell	i
us	c
stories	c
with	i
two	c
sides	c
in	c
conflit	i
:	c
the	c
good	c
and	c
the	c
bad	c
side	c
.	c

But	c
is	c
n't	c
evil	c
interesting	c
?	c

Although	c
the	c
other	c
people	c
on	i
the	c
story	c
are	c
the	c
good	c
ones	c
and	c
suffer	c
with	i
his	c
domination	c
,	c
they	c
are	c
quite	c
poor	c
and	c
empty	c
,	c
not	c
interesting	c
and	c
not	c
well	c
described	c
,	c
meanwhile	c
Anthony	c
is	c
a	c
very	c
interesting	c
and	c
different	c
person	c
,	c
and	c
all	c
his	c
thoughts	c
are	c
told	c
us	i
by	c
the	c
author	c
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
even	c
though	c
we	c
know	c
that	c
this	c
character	c
is	c
good	c
and	c
this	c
one	c
is	c
bad	c
,	c
sometimes	c
the	c
good	c
ones	c
are	c
quite	c
boring	c
,	c
and	c
we	c
find	c
the	c
bad	c
one	i
much	c
more	c
interesting	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
The	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
which	c
is	c
very	c
different	c
from	c
what	i
it	i
have	i
shown	i
.	c

I	c
will	c
let	c
you	c
know	c
about	c
what	c
I	c
have	c
in	c
mind	c
.	c

But	c
a	c
clerk	c
said	c
that	c
time	i
for	c
discounts	c
had	c
been	i
finished	i
.	c

I	c
did	c
not	c
care	c
about	c
money	i
and	c
I	c
rushed	c
into	c
and	i
then	c
took	c
a	c
seat	c
with	c
some	c
food	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
waiting	c
for	c
the	c
show	c
that	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
start	c
at	c
7.30	c
p.m.	c
But	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
8.15	c
.	c

I	c
felt	c
nervous	c
.	c

After	c
the	c
show	c
ended	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
on	c
the	c
way	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
were	c
me	c
,	c
how	c
would	c
you	c
feel	c
?	c

So	c
,	c
I	c
could	c
not	c
help	c
to	i
writing	c
to	c
you	c
and	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
take	i
money	c
back	c

-	c
How	c
has	c
modern	c
technology	c
changed	c
your	c
daily	c
life	c
?	c

At	c
this	c
time	c
,	c
our	c
nation	c
was	c
under	i
a	c
developing	c
country	c
.	c

Almost	c
all	c
the	c
people	c
had	c
a	c
Television	c
which	c
provided	c
events	c
around	c
our	c
county	i
very	c
quickly	c
.	c

As	c
I	c
growed	i
up	c
,	c
T.V	c
was	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
mysteriest	i
things	c
like	c
a	c
telephone	c
and	c
a	c
bus	c
.	c

When	c
it	c
comes	c
to	c
modern	c
technology	c
,	c
I	c
grately	c
appreciate	c
it	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
university	c
student	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
find	c
out	c
some	c
imformation	i
about	i
my	c
homework	c
.	c

but	c
a	c
computer	c
made	i
me	c
get	i
them	i
from	c
internet	i
.	c

Second	c
thing	c
is	c
an	i
airplane	c
.	c

Now	c
I	c
am	c
in	c
England	c
.	c

I	i
know	i
a	i
ship	i
but	i
an	i
airplane	i
made	i
an	i
arrival	i
to	i
here	i
be	i
quick	i
.	i

Third	c
thing	c
is	c
a	i
telephone	c
.	c

All	c
in	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
having	c
many	c
benefits	c
from	c
modern	c
technology	c
which	i
is	c
very	c
useful	c
.	c

But	c
it	c
might	c
be	c
a	c
problem	c
,	c
making	c
me	c
lazy	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

I	c
was	c
in	c
London	c
for	c
a	c
week	c
's	c
holiday	c
and	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
still	c
a	c
student	c
and	c
I	c
saw	c
in	c
the	c
advertisment	i
that	c
there	c
were	c
some	c
discounts	c
available	c
.	c

I	c
asked	c
for	i
it	c
but	c
the	c
answer	c
I	c
received	c
was	c
that	c
there	c
was	i
n't	i
any	c
kind	c
of	c
discount	i
.	c

I	c
arrived	c
at	c
the	c
theatre	c
at	c
19.00	c
and	c
I	c
thought	c
I	c
'd	c
have	c
waited	c
only	c
thirty	c
minutes	c
.	c

I	c
waited	c
more	c
than	c
one	c
hour	c
because	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
at	c
20.15	c
.	c

But	c
,	c
at	c
the	i
moment	c
,	c
I	c
thought	c
that	c
these	c
things	c
can	c
happen	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
if	c
there	c
had	c
been	c
only	c
one	c
or	c
two	c
problems	c
I	c
would	c
n't	c
have	c
written	c
to	c
reply	i
but	c
there	c
had	i
been	i
only	c
problems	c
.	c

I	c
'd	c
like	c
not	c
only	c
to	c
reply	i
but	c
also	c
to	c
have	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
because	c
my	c
evening	c
was	c
n't	c
"	c
perfect	c
"	c
as	c
you	c
advertised	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
big	c
disaster	c
.	c

Every	c
aspect	c
of	c
our	c
daily	c
life	c
is	c
influenced	c
by	c
technology	c
.	c

Then	c
I	c
go	c
to	c
work	c
by	c
motorbike	c
.	c

The	c
first	c
thing	c
I	c
do	c
when	c
I	c
arrive	c
in	i
my	c
office	c
is	c
to	c
switch	c
on	c
my	c
computer	c
.	c

During	i
all	i
the	i
day	c
I	c
speak	c
with	c
the	c
majority	c
of	c
my	c
collegues	i
by	c
telephone	c
or	c
e-mail	c
.	c

If	c
I	c
'm	c
too	c
tired	c
to	c
go	c
out	c
with	c
my	c
friends	c
I	c
finish	c
my	c
day	c
looking	i
a	c
programme	c
on	c
television	c
.	c

I	c
know	c
that	c
it	c
can	c
appear	c
a	c
sad	c
day	c
but	c
it	c
's	c
what	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
people	c
do	c
every	c
day	c
in	c
every	c
part	c
of	c
the	c
world	c
.	c

To	c
conclude	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
technology	c
has	c
improved	c
many	c
aspects	c
of	c
our	c
daily	c
life	c
.	c

But	c
it	c
's	c
also	c
true	c
that	c
sometime	c
we	c
are	c
n't	c
able	c
to	c
make	i
a	c
step	c
without	c
it	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
the	c
good	i
programme	c
that	c
you	c
mack	i
for	c
my	c
class	c
in	c
such	c
a	c
short	c
time	c
.	c

The	c
point	c
of	c
my	c
letter	c
is	c
that	c
students	i
in	c
my	c
class	c
have	c
seen	c
an	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
and	c
they	c
would	c
appreciate	c
if	i
they	c
could	c
go	c
and	c
see	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

The	c
show	c
is	c
going	c
to	c
include	c
latest	i
fashions	c
,	c
leisure	c
and	c
sports	c
wear	c
,	c
make	i
up	i
and	c
hairstyles	c
and	c
best	c
of	c
all	c
it	c
is	c
free	c
for	c
students	c
to	c
get	c
in	c
.	c

The	c
only	c
problem	c
is	c
that	c
the	c
show	c
is	c
going	c
to	c
take	c
place	c
on	c
tuesday	i
of	i
14th	c
March	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
'm	c
wondering	c
if	c
you	c
can	c
make	c
some	c
changes	c
in	i
your	c
programme	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c

The	c
home	c
of	c
the	c
Futere	i

That	c
is	c
the	i
question	c
,	i
which	c
many	c
people	c
ask	c
themselves	c
and	c
other	c
people	c
quite	c
often	c
.	c

The	i
technologi	i
is	c
changing	c
very	c
fast	c
and	c
at	c
the	c
same	c
moment	i
as	c
I	c
'm	c
writing	c
my	c
article	c
about	c
the	c
future	c
maybe	c
technologists	c
have	c
made	c
a	c
new	c
owen	i
which	c
co-operate	i
with	c
your	c
refrigerator	c
and	c
has	c
in	i
the	i
programme	i
to	c
make	c
dinner	c
for	c
you	c
every	c
day	c
without	c
that	i
you	c
have	i
to	c
do	c
anything	c
.	c

What	c
about	c
rooms	c
which	c
can	c
feel	i
your	c
mood	c
and	c
acting	i
after	i
that	c
,	i
if	i
you	c
are	c
tired	c
for	c
example	c
then	c
your	c
stereo	c
might	c
put	c
some	c
relaxing	c
musik	i
on	c
and	c
turn	c
down	c
the	c
light	c
a	c
little	c
bit	c
.	c

Next	i
step	c
might	c
be	c
a	c
robot	c
,	i
which	c
would	c
do	c
all	c
your	c
housework	c
,	c
but	c
what	c
would	c
happened	i
to	c
the	c
people	c
?	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
everyone	c
should	c
not	i
think	i
just	c
about	c
the	c
positive	c
sides	i
with	i
technologi	i
but	c
also	c
the	c
negative	c
.	c

To	c
make	c
matters	c
worse	c
,	c
not	c
only	c
was	c
the	c
restaurant	c
closed	c
,	c
without	i
any	i
appearant	i
reason	c
,	c
but	c
also	c
the	c
discounts	c
that	c
were	c
said	c
to	c
be	c
available	c
were	c
not	c
.	c

On	c
top	c
of	c
everything	c
,	c
the	c
performance	c
began	c
forty-five	c
minutes	c
late	c
.	c

I	c
join	i
my	c
receipt	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

Over	c
the	c
last	c
five	c
years	c
,	c
she	c
had	i
caused	c
many	c
arguments	c
because	c
of	c
unkept	c
secrets	c
,	c
but	c
she	c
could	c
n't	c
help	c
speaking	c
to	c
everybody	c
.	c

She	c
convicted	i
the	i
two	i
criminals	i
,	c
and	c
had	i
the	c
calm	c
gone	i
back	i
within	c
the	c
school	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr.	c
Robertson	c
!	i

We	c
think	c
it	c
could	c
be	c
great	i
opportunity	c
for	c
us	c
because	c
we	c
'll	c
see	c
the	c
fashion	c
show	c
might	i
shop	i
for	i
leisure	i
and	i
sports	i
wear	i
and	c
all	c
girls	i
in	c
our	c
class	c
are	c
intrested	i
in	c
new	c
styles	c
in	c
make	i
up	i
and	c
hairdressing	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
mind	c
,	c
we	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
change	c
the	c
programme	c
a	c
little	c
bit	c
.	c

Instead	c
of	c
shopping	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
afternoon	c
we	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
this	c
show	c
,	c
which	c
will	c
continue	c
till	c
7	c
o'clock	c
in	c
the	c
evening	c
.	c

Best	c
regards	c

your	c
students	c

Our	c
life	c
is	c
changing	c
every	c
day	c
.	c

Future	i
is	c
almost	i
unpredictable	c
.	c

But	c
what	c
if	c
we	i
'll	i
try	i
to	c
imagine	c
how	i
our	c
house	c
will	c
look	c
like	c
in	c
the	c
next	c
50	c
or	c
100	c
years	c
?	c

Will	c
we	c
all	c
live	c
in	c
countryside	i
in	c
house	i
surrounded	c
by	c
forest	c
full	c
of	c
animal	c
life	c
?	c

Or	c
would	c
be	i
our	i
house	i
itself	i
alive	c
?	c

With	c
new	c
computer	c
technology	c
nothing	c
is	c
impossible	c
.	c

The	i
scintist	i
could	c
invent	i
the	c
4'th	i
dimention	i
and	c
we	i
'll	i
get	c
unlimited	c
space	c
inside	c
the	c
house	c
.	c

You	c
could	c
tell	c
your	c
wardrobe	c
what	c
clothes	c
you	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
wear	c
,	c
your	c
hob	c
will	c
cook	c
your	c
preferable	i
meals	c
and	c
your	c
refigerator	i
will	c
send	c
orders	c
to	c
the	c
supermarkets	c
to	c
buy	c
the	c
food	c
.	c

Lots	c
of	c
changes	c
could	c
be	i
done	i
in	c
the	c
future	c
,	c
but	c
the	c
main	c
purpose	c
of	c
the	c
house	i
-	c
to	c
keep	i
comfort	c
and	c
safety	c
,	c
to	i
place	c
for	c
you	c
to	c
relax	c
and	c
feel	c
at	c
home	c
,	i
-	c
will	c
remain	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
.	i

We	c
have	c
seen	c
the	c
programme	c
list	i
and	c
we	c
all	c
think	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

it	i
will	c
be	c
on	c
the	c
14th	c
and	c
we	c
all	c
want	c
to	c
go	c
.	c

This	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
to	c
learn	c
something	c
else	i
because	c
most	c
of	c
us	c
have	c
not	c
been	c
to	c
this	c
kind	c
of	c
show	c
And	i
it	c
is	c
free	c
for	c
students	c
.	c

it	i
will	c
be	c
incredible	c
if	c
we	c
have	c
a	c
chance	c
to	c
watch	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

So	c
could	c
you	c
give	c
us	c
permission	c
to	c
go	c
?	c

We	c
also	i
can	i
suggest	c
how	c
the	c
originally	i
programme	c
can	c
be	c
changed	c
.	c

Then	c
,	c
we	c
can	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
show	c
during	c
that	c
period	c

12-12-00	c

I	c
was	c
thinking	c
'	c
what	c
should	c
I	c
do	c
?	c
'	c

I	c
have	i
n't	i
got	c
my	c
mobile	c
phone	c
with	c
me	c
And	i
I	c
was	c
half	i
way	i
between	c
my	c
school	c
and	c
home	c
.	c

At	c
that	c
time	c
he	c
was	c
unconcious	i
,	i
I	c
kept	c
asking	c
myself	c
'	c
should	i
I	c
wake	c
him	c
up	c
or	c
try	c
to	c
use	c
my	c
unsure	i
first	c
aid	c
skill	i
to	c
deal	i
with	c
him	c
.	c

I	c
decided	c
to	c
do	c
something	c
to	i
this	c
man	c
,	i
my	i
first	c
move	c
was	c
to	c
check	c
was	i
there	i
any	c
solid	c
or	c
liquid	c
which	c
could	c
blocked	i
his	c
breathe	i
.	c

After	c
that	c
I	c
turned	c
on	c
the	c
car	i
light	i
in	c
order	c
to	c
tell	i
the	c
passing	c
cars	c
.	c

The	c
car	c
and	c
the	c
man	c
were	c
not	c
there	c
anymore	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
wondering	c
.	c

Oh	c
,	c
sorry	c
they	c
were	c
not	c
in	i
this	c
road	c
,	i
they	i
were	c
in	i
the	c
next	i
road	c

I	c
am	c
writting	i
you	i
in	c
order	c
to	c
obtain	i
you	i
my	c
money	c
back	c
,	c
concerning	i
the	c
musical	c
show	c
:	c
OVER	c
THE	c
RAINBOW	c
.	c

I	c
live	c
in	c
France	c
and	c
I	c
recently	c
spent	c
a	c
week	c
's	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

I	c
decided	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
theatre	i
to	c
have	c
a	c
nice	c
evening	c
.	c

I	c
saw	c
your	c
advertisement	c
in	c
a	c
newspaper	c
.	c

It	c
seemed	c
to	c
be	c
very	c
attractive	i
.	c

But	c
in	c
fact	c
it	c
is	c
not	c
!	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
disappointed	c
.	c

Thirdly	c
it	i
said	c
that	i
"	c
discounts	c
available	c
"	c
.	c

After	c
that	c
it	c
suggested	i
to	i
visit	i
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
,	c
but	c
the	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
!	c

It	c
is	i
a	c
shame	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
awful	c
,	c
the	c
worst	c
evening	c
out	i
of	c
my	c
life	c
.	c

So	c
please	c
,	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
fair	c
,	i
that	i
you	c
give	i
my	i
money	c
back	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
in	c
a	i
near	c
future	c
.	c

"	c
What	c
will	c
clothes	c
be	c
like	c
100	c
years	c
from	c
now	c
?	c
"	c

You	c
will	c
find	i
always	i
basic	i
clothes	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
the	c
materials	c
which	c
will	c
change	c
.	c

We	c
will	c
find	c
the	c
same	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
with	c
gadgets	c
included	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
:	c
a	c
short	c
very	i
classical	c
inside	i
of	i
it	c
could	c
be	c
included	c
a	c
mobile	c
phone	c
,	c
or	c
we	c
could	c
find	c
too	i
some	i
buttons	i
,	c
to	c
have.	i
.	c

fresh	c
air	c
,	c
why	c
not	c
?	c

Everything	c
is	c
possible	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
fun	c
to	c
see	c
this	c
type	c
of	c
gadgets	i
with	i
old	c
clothes	c
,	c
like	c
a	c
dress	c
of	i
the	c
middle-Age	i
.	c

Do	c
not	c
worry	c
about	c
this	c
,	c
it	c
will	c
not	c
happen	c
!	c

Fashion	c
is	c
always	c
the	c
same	c
!	c

Dear	c
Ms	c

very	c
much	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

Shopping	c
is	c
an	c
ordinary	c
way	i
of	i
life	i
.	c

We	c
always	c
need	c
fresh	c
food	c
such	c
as	c
vegetables	c
,	c
fruits	i
,	c
milk	c
and	i
etc.	c
At	i

people	c
will	c
do	c
their	c
shopping	c
twice	c
a	c
week	c
for	c
a	i
fresh	c
food	c

You	c
might	c

shopping	c
is	c
enjoyable	c
but	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
think	c
it	c
always	i
enjoyable	c

You	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
about	c
them	c
.	c

Early	c
that	c
day	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
buy	c
the	c
tickets	c
and	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
buy	c
the	c
expensive	c
ones	c
,	c
like	i
the	c
promotion	i
paper	i
said	c
they	c
made	i
discounts	c
to	c
people	c
that	i
worked	c
at	c
the	c
British	c
Institute	c
.	c

I	c
mentioned	c
it	c
,	c
but	c
they	c
told	c
me	c
that	c
promotion	i
had	c
ended	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
ago	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
evening	c
I	c
got	c
a	c
flat	c
tire	c
,	c
and	c
because	c
of	c
this	c
I	c
got	c
late	i
to	i
the	i
show	i
,	c
when	c
I	c
got	c
to	c
my	c
place	i
,	c
it	c
was	c
used	i
(	c
it	c
cost	c
a	c
lot	c
)	c
and	c
they	c
took	c
me	c
to	c
the	c
cheapest	c
seats	c
,	c
where	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
see	c
a	c
thing	c
.	c

After	c
waiting	c
a	c
while	c
in	c
this	c
uncomfortable	c
place	i
the	c
show	c
started	c
,	i
I	c
waited	c
45	c
minutes	c
and	c
then	c
the	c
actors	c
appeared	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
find	i
myself	i
that	c
the	c
main	c
one	c
was	c
n't	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
an	c
impostor	c
.	c

Sorry	c
,	c
but	c
all	i
these	i
stuff	i
are	i
not	i
proffesional	i
,	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
going	c
to	c
make	i
a	i
demand	i
exactly	i
because	i
you	i
do	i
n't	i
have	i
that	i
,	c
if	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
give	c
me	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

Yesterday	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
"	c
blue	c
disco	c
"	c
because	c
the	c
guy	c
I	c
liked	c
was	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
there	c
.	c

But	c
there	c
was	c
a	c
little	c
problem	c
and	c
it	c
was	c
that	c
my	c
parent	i
's	i
did	c
n't	c
let	c
me	c
go	c
alone	i
to	i
disco	i
's	i
,	c
so	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
go	c
illegaly	i
,	c
and	c
I	c
decided	c
I	c
would	c
do	c
it	c
.	c

That	c
night	c
I	c
waited	c
until	c
my	c
parents	c
were	c
asleep	c
and	c
I	c
went	i
out	c
my	i
window	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
told	c
Pat	c
to	c
pick	c
me	c
up	c
,	i
she	i
was	c
the	c
only	c
one	c
that	i
new	i
my	c
plan	c
.	c

I	c
made	c
her	c
promise	c
she	c
would	c
n't	c
tell	c
anyone	c
my	c
secret	c
.	c

To	c
sumarize	i
the	c
night	c
I	i
am	c
going	c
steady	c
with	c
him	c
,	c
and	c
he	c
took	c
me	c
home	c
.	c

All	c
the	c
truth	c
was	c
then	c
told	c
,	c
and	c
now	c
I	c
am	c
grownded	i
for	c
life	c
.	c

She	c
defintevely	i
does	c
n't	c
know	c
how	c
to	c
keep	c
secrets	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

Just	c
to	c
remind	c
you	c
of	c
which	c
show	c
I	c
am	c
talking	c
about	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
called	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
.	c

There	c
were	c
couple	i
of	c
things	c
I	c
noted	c
down	c
during	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

One	c
of	c
the	c
reasons	c
that	c
I	c
chose	c
to	c
see	c
this	c
show	c
was	c
to	c
see	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
live	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
disappointed	c
.	c

Then	c
I	c
found	c
out	c
that	c
the	c
discounts	c
are	i
not	c
available	c
but	c
on	c
the	c
notice	c
board	c
,	i
it	c
said	c
that	c
they	c
are	i
available	c
.	c

The	c
evening	c
that	c
I	c
spent	c
there	c
was	c
terrible	c
so	c
please	c
may	c
I	c
have	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

Raulet	c

But	c
people	c
in	i
nowadays	c
like	c
me	c
ca	c
n't	c
even	c
walk	c
1	c
km.	c
And	c
also	c
what	c
is	c
the	c
point	c
of	c
walking	c
when	c
you	c
have	c
cars	c
and	c
buses	c
or	c
even	c
bikes	c
.	c

Phones	c
also	c
affected	c
my	c
daily	c
routine	c
.	c

Computers	c
changed	c
my	c
daily	c
routine	c
because	c
when	i
I	c
was	c
younger	c
,	c
I	c
was	i
spending	i
most	c
of	c
my	c
days	c
outside	c
playing	c
basketball	c
but	c
now	c
,	i
I	c
just	c
play	c
on	c
the	c
computers	c
all	c
day	c
.	c

E-mails	c
are	c
also	c
one	c
of	c
my	c
examples	c
.	c

So	c
in	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
modern	c
technology	c
changed	i
my	c
daily	c
routine	c
quiet	i
a	c
lot	c

Dear	c
Madam	c
:	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
to	c
Camp	c
California	c
only	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
during	c
June	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
busy	c
with	c
my	c
tests	i
.	c

I	c
prefer	c
my	i
accommodation	i
at	i
Camp	i
in	c
tents	c
because	c
it	c
reminds	c
me	c
my	i
first	c
school	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
great	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
have	c
lots	c
of	c
people	c
near	c
me	c
.	c

My	c
father	c
was	c
a	c
great	c
singer	c
and	c
he	c
has	c
been	c
helping	c
me	c
.	c

Painting	c
is	c
my	i
challenge	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
very	c
hard	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
love	c
to	c
paint	c
and	c
I	c
intend	c
to	c
know	c
everything	c
about	c
it	c
.	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

Women	c
love	c
shopping	c
.	c

All	i
weekends	i
I	c
and	c
my	c
boyfriend	c
go	c
to	c
B.H	i
Shopping	c
Center	c
.	c

I	c
retired	c
four	c
years	c
ago	c
and	c
my	c
live	i
is	c
very	c
bored	i
.	c

He	c
was	c
with	c
me	c
and	c
suddenly	c
he	c
became	c
very	c
angry	c
.	c

I	c
tried	c
to	c
buy	c
a	c
handsome	c
suit	c
for	c
him	c
but	c
he	c
shouted	c
and	c
abandoned	c
me	c
with	c
my	c
bags	c
.	c

I	c
cried	c
very	i
much	i
because	c
my	c
life	c
is	c
really	c
very	c
stupid	c
.	c

I	c
decided	c
to	c
stop	c
buying	c
those	c
things	c
that	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
really	c
need	c
.	c

I	c
know	c
in	i
deep	i
of	i
my	i
heart	i
sometimes	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	i
enjoyable	c
.	c

Yesterday	c
he	c
called	c
me	c
and	c
told	c
me	c
that	c
he	c
loves	c
me	c
,	c
anyway	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
that	c
he	c
forgets	c
my	i
shopping	c
.	c

At	c
last	c
I	c
am	c
really	c
a	c
great	c
woman	c
and	c
I	c
love	c
myself	c
.	c

Dear	c
Miss	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
glad	c
to	c
hear	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
the	c
prize	c
and	c
thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
about	i
that	c
.	c

Here	c
is	c
the	c
information	c
you	c
want	c
,	c
I	c
hope	c
they	i
are	i
useful	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
July	c
is	c
the	c
only	c
month	c
I	c
can	c
travel	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
got	c
exams	c
at	c
school	c
and	c
I	c
wo	c
n't	c
finish	c
them	c
until	c
the	c
last	c
day	c
of	c
June	c
.	c

Since	c
I	c
have	c
n't	c
been	c
camping	c
in	c
tents	c
so	i
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
take	c
this	c
chance	c
to	c
feel	c
and	c
experience	c
what	c
will	i
it	i
be	i
.	c

Although	c
I	c
'm	c
not	c
good	c
at	c
climbing	c
,	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
experienced	i
myself	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
what	c
is	c
the	c
weather	c
in	c
USA	i
like	c
and	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
should	c
I	c
wear	c
?	i

And	c
I	c
was	c
wondering	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
do	i
I	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
?	i

Also	c
,	c
if	c
I	c
can	c
join	i
climbing	c
,	c
what	c
do	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
bring	c
?	c

At	i
last	i
thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
answering	c
my	c
questions	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

It	c
was	c
lovely	c
to	c
hear	c
that	c
you	c
want	c
to	c
hear	c
about	c
my	c
experience	c
.	c

At	c
the	c
concert	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
play	c
4	c
songs	c
and	c
I	c
had	c
never	c
played	c
in	c
a	c
concert	c
before	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
felt	c
very	c
nervous	c
before	c
the	c
concert	c
.	c

But	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
good	c
experience	c
for	c
me	c
because	c
I	c
learnt	c
how	c
to	c
claim	i
down	c
and	c
play	c
well	c
in	c
front	c
of	c
the	c
audience	c
the	i
concert	c
.	c

When	c
the	c
concert	c
finished	c
my	c
favour	i
singer	c
talked	c
to	c
me	c
&	c
they	c
invited	c
me	c
to	c
play	c
the	c
piano	c
in	c
their	c
next	c
concert	c
and	c
they	c
said	c
that	c
because	c
I	c
performed	i
will	i
in	c
that	c
concert	c
.	c

At	i
last	i
thank	i
you	c
for	c
sharing	c
my	c
experience	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Smith	c
,	c

By	i
the	i
following	i
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
inform	c
you	c
that	c
I	i
've	i
assisted	i
your	c
new	c
musical	c
show	c
,	c
which	i
name	i
is	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
"	c
,	c
last	c
Saturday	c
evening	c
,	c
10th	c
June	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
you	i
to	c
make	c
a	c
complaint	c
on	i
your	c
advertisement	c
,	c
which	c
I	c
consider	c
like	i
a	c
lying	c
advertisement	c
.	c

Let	c
me	c
explain	c
you	i
why	c
I	c
'm	c
now	c
so	c
disappointed	c
.	c

I	i
've	i
spent	i
one	c
week	i
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
with	c
my	c
husband	c
for	c
our	c
honeymoon	c
.	c

We	c
had	c
preparred	i
quiet	i
a	c
long	c
time	c
ago	c
,	c
this	c
travel	i
to	c
the	c
capital	c
and	c
spared	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
money	c
as	c
well	c
.	c

We	c
are	c
both	c
very	c
keen	c
on	c
musical	i
shows	i
.	c

We	c
've	c
already	c
attended	i
"	c
Cats	c
"	c
,	c
the	c
"	c
Phantom	c
of	c
the	c
Opera	c
"	c
,	c
"	c
les	c
Miserables	c
"	c
,	c
"	c
Grease	c
"	c
,	c
and	c
so	c
many	c
others	c
.	c

When	c
we	c
saw	c
your	c
leaflet	c
mentionned	i
"	c
London	c
's	c
newest	c
and	c
best	c
musical	c
show	c
"	c
,	c
we	c
were	c
so	c
enthusiastic	c
and	c
curious	c
that	c
we	c
bought	i
immediately	i
the	c
tickets	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
waiting	i
evening	c
,	c
at	i
the	i
entrance	i
stood	i
people	i
,	i
who	c
were	c
shouting	c
at	c
you	c
because	c
there	c
was	i
n't	i
any	c
discounts	c
available	c
.	c

One	c
thing	c
that	c
you	c
promised	c
on	c
your	c
leaflet	c
.	c

We	c
did	c
n't	c
have	c
trouble	c
to	i
find	i
our	c
seats	c
,	c
but	c
we	c
found	c
very	i
annoying	c
to	c
have	i
waited	i
45	c
minutes	c
before	c
the	c
show	c
goes	i
on	i
and	c
more	c
that	i
your	c
famous	c
actors	c
were	i
n't	i
absolutely	i
Mr	c
Brook	c
and	c
Mrs	c
Truelove	c
and	c
we	c
can	c
also	c
add	c
that	c
your	c
restaurant	c
was	c
n't	c
opened	c
because	c
of	c
hygienic	i
troubles	i
.	c

I	c
can	c
say	c
now	c
that	c
"	c
It	c
was	c
n't	c
my	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
"	c
and	c
I	c
request	i
now	i
some	c
money	c
back	c
for	c
all	c
these	c
disagreements	i
.	c

To	c
International	c
Post	c
magazine	c

Please	c
find	c
enclosed	c
my	c
thinking	i
about	c
the	c
fashion	c
of	c
the	c
future	c
.	c

Everyone	c
has	c
is	i
own	c
style	c
but	c
it	c
's	c
obvious	c
that	c
many	c
of	c
us	c
is	i
wearing	c
the	c
same	c
clothes	c
like	i
others	c
.	c

We	c
all	c
follow	c
the	c
new	c
collection	c
on	c
the	c
market	c
.	c

Today	c
it	c
's	c
wearing	c
short-trousers	i
and	c
yesterday	c
was	i
wearing	c
broken-jeans	i
.	c

What	c
we	c
wear	c
is	c
also	c
influenced	c
by	c
models	c
,	c
medias	i
,	c
or	c
new	c
collection	i
,	c
which	c
come	c
from	c
Paris	c
,	c
London	c
,	c
or	c
New	c
York	c
.	c

These	c
new	c
clothes	c
are	c
often	c
very	c
expensive	c
that	i
's	i
maybe	c
not	c
everyone	c
can	c
afford	c
to	c
buy	c
himself	c
the	c
newest	c
clothes	c
on	c
the	c
market	c
.	c

In	c
100	c
years	c
,	c
it	c
's	c
possible	c
that	c
each	i
people	i
will	c
developp	i
his	c
own	c
style	c
using	c
all	c
the	c
new	c
materials	c
like	c
plastic	c
,	c
latex	c
everything	i
possible	c
,	c
in	i
a	c
way	c
to	c
create	c
own	i
clothes	c
.	c

Because	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
people	c
need	c
to	c
find	c
again	i
their	i
authenticity	i
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
concerning	c
stars	i
and	c
artists	c
,	c
they	c
came	c
from	c
only	c
six	c
countries	c
.	c

For	c
musics	i
like	c
jazz	c
and	c
rock	c
it	i
was	c
excellent	c
but	c
for	c
classical	c
concerts	c
we	c
had	c
a	c
problem	c
.	c

Because	c
some	c
concert	c
halls	c
were	c
too	c
small	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
have	c
any	c
ideas	c
about	c
bigger	i
halls	c
,	c
it	c
will	i
be	i
better	c
.	c

The	c
dance	c
shows	c
was	i
very	i
wonderful	c
like	i
art	c
exhibitions	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
concerned	i
the	c
price	c
for	i
the	c
weekend	c
tickets	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
excellent	c
because	c
people	c
are	c
less	c
stress	i
,	c
so	i
they	c
can	c
visit	c

It	c
will	i
be	i
better	c
,	i
if	c
we	c
can	i
make	i
this	c
festival	c
at	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
summer	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
to	i
give	i
you	c
enough	c
information	c

Yours	c
faithfully	i

It	c
began	c
when	c
my	c
parent	i
sand	i
I	c
were	c
going	c
to	c
the	c
South	c
of	c
France	c
for	c
holidays	i
.	c

We	c
took	i
a	i
car	i
.	c

We	c
were	i
going	i
to	c
the	c
toilet	c
and	c
ate	c
something	c
to	i
the	c
snack	c
bar	c
.	c

We	c
called	c
the	c
police	c
but	c
they	c
said	c
us	i
if	i
you	i
did	c
n't	c
close	i
your	i
car	c
we	i
did	i
n't	i
make	i
something	i
.	c

It	c
was	c
the	i
worse	i
holiday	c
in	c
my	c
life	c
but	c
we	c
continued	c
.	c

When	c
we	c
arrived	c
at	c
the	c
flat	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
eleven	c
o'clock	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
the	i
life	c
in	c
France	c
are	i
crasy	i
,	c
this	c
is	c
the	c
tradition	c
.	c

This	c
story	c
happened	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
ago	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writting	i
to	c
complain	c
about	i
I	c
am	i
really	c
disappointed	c
your	i
musical	c
show	c
which	i
is	c
"	c
over	i
the	i

"	c

on	i
last	c

Secondary	i

as	i
the	c
musical	c
start	i
14.30	i
and	c
19:30	c

but	c
the	c
musical	c
started	c
20:15	i

it	i
's	i
45	c
minuts	i
late	c

and	c
also	c

I	i
'd	i
asked	i

the	c
ticket	c
counter	c
,	c
but	c
there	i
are	i
not	i
available	i
any	i

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c

from	i

I	c
am	c
writting	i
composition	i
about	c
"	c
How	c
has	i
modern	i
technology	i
changed	c
your	c
daily	c
life	c
"	c
,	i
this	i
is	c
our	c
question	i
.	c

All	i
at	i
the	i
technology	i
developed	i
about	i
every	i
day	i
,	c
not	c
all	c
of	c
them	i
,	c
but	c
still	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
modern	c
technology	c
changed	i
our	c
daily	c
life	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
thought	i
more	c
than	c
half	c
population	i
of	c
British	i
has	c
"	i
mobile	c
phone	c
"	c
,	i
it	i
is	i
small	c
and	c
compact	c
,	c
much	c
lighter	c
than	c
home	i
telephone	c
,	c
and	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
biggest	c
advantage	i
is	c
you	c
can	c
carry	c
it	c
,	c
so	c
that	c
easy	i
to	c
contact	c
your	c
friend	c
or	c
someone	c
who	i
other	i
,	i
even	i
they	c
can	c
easy	i
to	i
contact	i
you	c
as	c
well	c
,	c
so	c
you	c
can	c
phone	c
anytime	c
you	c
wants	i
,	c
whenever	c
you	c
wants	i
.	c

These	i
modern	i
techonology	i
get	i
closer	i
between	i
person	i
to	i
another	i
person	i
,	i
get	i
close	i
between	i
worldwide	i
,	i
so	i
that	i
,	i
these	i
modern	i
technology	i
changed	i
our	i
daily	i
life	i
so	i
diffarent	i

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
;	c
I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
musical	c
show	i
"	c
Over	c
The	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
,	c
which	c
as	i
organised	i
in	i
your	c
theatre	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
as	c
regards	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
due	c
to	c
problems	c
with	c
the	c
pipes	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
asking	c
you	c
a	i
full	c
refund	c
or	c
at	c
least	c
part	i
of	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

What	c
is	c
more	c
,	c
every	c
time	c
I	c
trusted	c
her	c
with	c
my	c
secrets	c
,	c
she	c
always	c
let	c
me	c
down	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
always	c
the	c
same	c
;	c
she	c
would	c
meet	c
with	c
her	c
neighbours	c
afterwards	c
and	c
give	c
my	c
secrets	c
away	c
.	c

To	c
make	c
matters	c
worse	c
,	c
people	c
gossiped	c
about	c
me	c
and	c
tried	c
to	c
find	c
out	c
more	c
and	c
more	c
about	c
my	c
private	c
affairs	c
,	c
which	c
made	c
me	c
feel	c
embarrassed	c
.	c

The	c
worst	c
point	i
was	c
that	c
she	c
started	c
to	c
make	c
up	c
false	c
stories	c
about	c
me	c
,	c
which	c
soon	c
spread	c
all	c
around	c
the	c
neighbourhood	c
.	c

Needless	c
to	c
say	c
,	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
put	c
up	c
with	c
that	c
situation	c
any	c
longer	c
so	c
I	c
determined	i
to	c
fall	c
out	c
with	c
her	c
.	c

Of	i
course	i
,	c
I	c
became	c
aware	c
of	c
her	c
feelings	c
since	c
a	c
friend	c
of	c
mine	c
overheard	c
a	c
conversation	c
between	c
Pat	c
and	c
other	i
girl	c
.	c

In	c
spite	c
of	c
that	c
,	c
I	c
found	c
it	c
difficult	c
to	c
forgive	c
her	c
as	c
she	c
had	c
hurt	c
my	c
feelings	c
;	c
that	c
's	c
why	c
the	c
only	c
thing	c
I	c
could	c
tell	c
her	c
since	i
we	c
had	c
quarrelled	c
was	c
:	c
"	c
It	c
serves	c
you	c
right	c
,	c
I	c
'll	c
hate	c
you	c
for	c
the	c
rest	c
of	c
your	c
life	c
!	c
"	c

In	c
order	c
to	c
the	i
prize	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
,	c
if	c
it	c
is	c
possible	c
,	c
on	i
July	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
student	c
and	c
my	c
winter	i
brake	i
is	c
taking	i
place	i
during	c
this	i
month	c
,	c
July	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
prepare	i
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
cabin	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
not	c
got	i
really	i
good	c
experiences	c
in	i
camping	c
in	c
tents	c
,	i
last	i
time	c
a	c
bear	c
came	c
inside	c
while	c
I	c
was	c
in	c
.	i

I	c
love	c
sports	c
so	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
play	c
some	c
basketball	c
at	c
the	c
camp	c
,	i
by	i
the	c
way	c
my	i
team	c
and	c
I	c
won	c
the	c
last	c
scholl	i
championship	c
,	i
I	c
play	c
guard	c
on	c
my	c
team	c
,	i
I	c
also	c
like	c
tennis	c
but	c
I	c
am	c
not	c
very	c
good	c
,	i
I	c
was	c
wondering	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
give	c
me	c
some	c
lesson	i
while	c
I	c
am	c
there	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
not	c
have	c
words	c
to	c
express	c
how	c
happy	c
I	c
am	c
,	i
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thanks	i
you	c
and	c
Camp	c

for	c
this	c
oportunity	i

Nowadays	c
in	i
the	c
year	c
2000	c
we	c
still	c
practice	i
this	c
ancient	c
art	c
but	c
in	c
a	c
diferent	i
way	c
,	c
we	c
do	c
n't	c
use	c
weapons	c
for	c
hunting	c
animal	i
in	c
the	c
jungle	c
,	c
we	c
use	c
the	c
remote	c
to	c
hunt	c
TV	c
shows	c
,	c
and	c
we	c
do	c
not	c
collect	c
vegetables	c
any	c
more	c
we	i
go	c
shopping	c
.	c

This	c
activity	c
of	c
shopping	c
has	c
become	c
one	c
of	c
our	c
most	c
important	c
,	c
after	c
all	c
,	c
we	c
go	c
shopping	c
for	c
any	c
reason	c
,	c
we	c
have	c
develop	i
such	c
an	c
instinc	i
for	c
shopping	c
that	c
we	c
can	c
proudly	c
say	c
,	i
that	c
we	c
are	c
some	c
sort	c
of	c
kings	c
in	i
the	c
urban	c
jungle	c
.	c

If	c
an	c
activity	c
has	c
stay	i
with	c
us	c
,	c
the	i
mankind	c
,	c
for	c
so	c
long	c
,	c
it	c
must	c
give	c
us	c
some	c
pleasure	c
and	c
maybe	c
that	c
's	c
why	c
shopping	c
has	c
become	c
such	c
an	c
important	c
thing	c
in	c
our	c
lives	c
because	c
it	c
gives	c
you	c
pleasure	c
when	c
you	c
find	c
what	c
you	c
have	c
been	c
looking	c
for	c
and	c
if	c
you	c
can	c
get	c
it	c
for	c
less	c
than	c
the	c
price	c
mark	i
on	c
it	c
,	c
that	c
is	c
the	c
greatest	c
extasis	i
.	c

But	c
where	c
is	c
the	c
bad	c
poet	i
of	c
it	c
,	i
well	i
shopping	c
can	c
became	c
horrible	c
in	i
christmast	i
for	c
example	c
when	i
houndred	i
of	c
people	c
goes	i
to	c
the	c
shopping	c
center	i
and	c
it	c
also	c
can	c
take	i
many	c
problems	c
when	c
you	c
become	c
an	c
impulsive	c
buyer	c

2000	c

I	c
received	c
your	c
letter	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
the	c
information	c
you	c
asked	c
.	i

About	c
accomodation	i
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
rather	c
be	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
than	c
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
because	c
in	c
July	c
the	c
weather	c
is	c
really	c
good	c
and	c
when	c
I	c
am	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
I	c
feel	c
closer	c
of	i
nature	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
interested	c
in	c
learning	c
Climbing	i
.	c

But	i
I	c
sailed	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
ago	c
so	c
I	c
am	c
quite	c
a	c
beginner	c
too	i
.	c

You	c
can	c
contact	c
me	c
for	c
further	c
information	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

I	c
was	c
happy	c
to	c
receive	c
your	c
letter	c
and	c
,	c
as	c
you	c
asked	c
me	c
,	c
I	c
will	c
tell	c
you	c
how	i
my	c
experience	c
was	i
and	c
how	c
great	c
it	c
was	c
.	c

I	c
will	c
never	c
forget	c
this	i
moment	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
I	c
worked	c
very	c
hard	c
because	c
the	c
concert	c
finished	c
very	c
late	c
and	c
after	c
the	c
concert	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
clean	c
up	c
the	c
room	i
and	c
you	c
ca	c
n't	c
imagine	c
how	c
dirty	c
the	c
fans	c
are	c
!	c

But	c
I	c
could	c
stand	c
up	c
on	c
the	c
scene	i
and	c
talk	c
with	c
the	c
musicians	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
receive	i
the	c
photos	c
I	c
took	c
,	c
I	c
will	c
write	c
you	i
again	c
to	c
give	c
them	c
to	c
you	c

Looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c

Astrid	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
a	c
foreign	c
woman	c
who	c
had	c
a	c
week	c
's	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
and	c
decided	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
to	c
see	c
a	c
musical	c
show	c
.	c

The	c
second	c
show	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
start	c
at	c
19:30	c
,	c
but	c
to	i
make	i
the	i
matters	i
worse	i
,	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
20.15	c
,	c
so	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
got	i
to	c
the	c
cinema	c
.	c

On	c
top	c
of	c
everything	c
the	c
tickets	i
did	c
n't	c
offer	c
any	c
discounts	c
,	c
so	c
the	i
last	c
day	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
buy	c
the	i
present	c
for	c
my	c
neighbour	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writting	i
to	c
ask	c
a	i
refund	c
of	c
the	c
Â£	c
55	c
which	c
I	c
spent	c
on	c
the	c
ticket	c
for	c
the	i
miserable	c
show	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Jane	c
Smythe	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
people	c
who	c
has	i
n't	i
any	c
cars	c
,	i
can	c
also	c
be	c
helped	c
by	c
technology	c
:	c
they	c
can	c
use	c
the	c
public	c
transport	c
like	c
the	c
train	c
or	c
the	c
bus	c
,	c
which	c
is	i
also	c
a	i
comfortable	c
form	i
of	c
travelling	c
.	c

But	c
if	c
you	c
want	c
a	i
fastest	c
transport	i
,	c
the	c
plane	c
is	c
the	i
perfect	c
one	i
!	c

Apart	c
from	c
that	c
,	c
technology	c
also	c
helps	c
in	c
hospitals	c
.	c

In	c
contrast	c
,	c
technology	c
is	c
very	c
bad	c
for	c
the	c
nature	i
:	c
if	c
we	c
use	c
cars	c
we	c
contaminate	c
,	i
and	c
many	c
cars	c
are	c
being	c
used	c
every	c
day	c
!	c

On	c
balance	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
evidently	i
technology	i
has	c
got	c
more	c
advantages	c
than	c
disadvantages	c
.	c

I	c
feel	c
very	c
happy	c
to	c
be	c
the	c
winner	c
of	c
your	c
competition	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
only	c
because	i
they	c
will	c
need	c
me	c
at	c
work	c
in	c
August	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
do	c
singing	c
and	c
swimming	c
.	c

For	i
the	c
first	c
activity	c
,	c
I	c
must	c
tell	c
you	c
that	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
keen	c
on	c
singing	c
but	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
very	c
few	i
experience	c
in	c
it	c
.	c

Concerning	c
swimming	c
,	c
I	c
practise	i
this	c
sport	c
once	c
a	c
week	c
on	i
myself	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
am	c
just	c
an	c
amateur	c
,	c
not	c
a	c
great	c
swimmer	c
!	c

Otherwise	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
which	i
clothes	c
I	c
will	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
in	c
my	c
luggage	c
.	c

Is	c
it	c
worth	c
to	i
take	i
a	c
raincoat	c
?	c

Should	c
I	c
take	c
trainers	c
?	c

Finally	c
,	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
must	c
I	c
bring	c
with	c
me	c
?	c

Or	c
is	c
it	c
better	c
to	c
take	c
only	c
an	c
international	c
credit	c
card	c
?	c

Going	c
for	i
shopping	c
is	c
a	c
good	c
thing	c
when	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
what	c
to	i
do	c
but	c
it	c
has	i
also	i
many	c
disavantages	i
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
shopping	c
is	c
tiring	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
people	c
who	c
are	c
doing	c
the	c
same	c
thing	c
as	c
you	c
the	c
same	c
day	c
!	c

You	c
are	c
embarrassed	i
with	i
the	c
people	c
who	c
are	c
so	c
close	c
to	c
you	c
that	c
you	c
ca	c
n't	c
walk	c
as	c
fast	c
as	c
you	c
want	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
shopping	c
is	c
stressful	c
,	c
especially	c
if	c
you	c
had	i
to	c
find	c
a	c
cloth	i
for	c
a	c
precise	i
day	c
,	i
and	c
nothing	c
fits	c
you	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
shopping	c
is	c
entertaining	c
if	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
what	c
to	i
do	c
.	c

You	c
can	c
discover	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
things	c
if	c
you	c
are	c
abroad	c
and	c
learn	c
a	c
lot	c
about	c
the	c
life	c
of	c
local	c
people	c
.	c

It	c
can	c
be	c
funny	i
!	c

Finally	c
,	c
shopping	c
can	c
help	c
you	c
to	c
feel	c
happy	c
if	c
you	c
are	c
down	c
in	c
the	c
dumps	c
,	c
if	c
you	c
feel	c
horrible	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
,	c

Firstly	c
,	c
the	c
actors	i
who	c
starring	i
was	c
not	c
Dany	c
Brook	c
as	c
it	i
was	i
advertised	c
but	c
one	i
other	i
actor	c
,	c
whose	c
performance	c
was	c
very	c
bad	c
.	c

That	c
made	c
the	c
show	c
disappointing	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
should	c
began	i
at	c
half	c
past	c
seven	c
.	c

My	c
evening	c
was	c
not	c
very	c
pleasant	c
as	c
you	c
advertised	c
.	c

As	c
a	c
result	c
of	c
that	i
I	c
demand	c
to	i
have	i
some	c
of	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

Can	c
you	c
imagine	c
your	c
life	c
without	c
a	c
car	c
or	c
a	c
television	c
?	c

I	c
do	i
n't	i
.	c

Technology	c
so	i
much	c
my	i
life	c
which	i
I	c
could	c
not	c
live	c
without	c
it	c
.	c

But	c
technology	c
does	c
n't	c
only	c
makes	i
my	c
life	c
better	c
.	c

Also	c
,	c
if	c
I	c
use	c
the	c
car	c
,	i
in	i
small	c
distances	c
when	c
I	c
can	i
go	c
on	c
foot	c
,	c
I	c
destroy	i
my	c
physical	i
situation	i
.	c

I	c
could	i
not	i
.	c

Althouth	i
with	i
the	c
computer	c
I	c
can	c
contact	c
with	i
my	c
friends	c
and	c
with	c
the	c
television	c
I	c
relax	c
,	c
I	c
could	c
not	c
find	c
another	c
way	c
to	c
relax	c
and	c
contact	c
with	i
others	c
.	c

Technology	c
is	c
very	c
important	c
for	i
my	c
life	c
.	c

It	c
makes	c
my	c
life	c
more	i
easier	i
,	c
and	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
much	c
more	c
difficult	c
to	c
live	c
without	c
it	c

THE	c
CIRCLE	c
THEATRE	c

LONDON	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

At	c
first	c
sight	c
the	c
theatre	c
was	c
gorgeous	c
,	i
I	c
was	c
surprised	c
of	i
its	c
facade	c
and	c
also	c
I	c
was	c
anxious	c
for	i
the	c
beginning	c
of	c
the	c
performance	c
.	c

My	c
friends	c
and	c
me	i
thought	c
that	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
the	c
perfect	c
night	c
in	i
London	c
but	c
everything	c
changed	c
when	c
the	c
show	c
had	i
been	i
delayed	i
more	c
than	c
forty-five	c
minutes	c
.	c

The	c
prices	c
that	c
our	c
travel	c
agency	c
confirmed	c
us	i
were	c
not	c
the	c
same	c
as	c
the	c
theatre	i
,	i
we	i
asked	c
for	c
our	c
special	c
discount	c
for	c
be	i
students	c
with	i
less	c
than	c
eighteen	c
years	c
but	c
we	c
only	c
obtained	c
a	c
rudely	i
answer	c
of	i
the	c
woman	c
who	c
sold	c
the	c
tickets	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
to	c
this	c
,	c
we	c
realized	c
when	c
the	c
show	c
began	c
that	c
the	c
main	c
character	c
was	c
not	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
.	c

At	i
top	i
of	i
everything	i
the	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
and	c
we	c
could	c
not	c
eat	c
on	i
the	c
theatre	c
.	c

Yours	c
Faithful	i

For	i
instances	i
with	c
the	c
arrive	i
of	c
Internet	i
,	c
the	c
new	c
digital	c
television	c
or	i
the	c
researchers	c
in	c
the	i
medecin	i
;	i
we	c
are	c
discovering	c
how	c
we	c
can	c
change	c
our	c
lives	c
only	i
with	i
press	i
a	i
botton	i
,	c
or	c
look	c
for	c
something	c
new	c
with	i
only	c
think	i
about	c
it	c
...	c
we	c
realize	c
that	c
the	c
new	c
technology	c
it	i
have	i
just	c
begun	c
,	i
and	c
lively	i
in	c
a	c
few	c
years	c
we	c
will	c
be	c
very	c
avanced	i
in	c
this	c
way	c
.	c

In	i
my	i
point	i
of	i
view	i
the	c
new	c
techincs	i
have	c
more	c
advantages	c
than	c
disadvantages	c
,	i
my	i
reasons	c
for	c
saying	c
that	i
is	i
because	i
furthermore	i
we	c
can	c
live	c
better	c
,	c
we	c
can	i
also	c
have	c
more	c
ways	c
of	c
know	i
now	c
to	c
live	c
healthy	i
and	c
how	c
to	c
spent	i
our	c
free	c
time	c
.	c

Although	c
the	i
technology	c
also	i
is	i
used	c
for	i
create	i
new	c
types	c
of	c
weapons	i
and	c
also	c
for	i
killing	i
people	c
,	c
it	i
is	c
only	c
the	c
worst	c
part	c
of	c
this	i
.	c

But	c
however	c
it	i
is	c
a	c
good	c
idea	c
to	c
spend	c
out	i
money	c
in	i
make	i
new	c
enterprises	c
which	c
pay	c
the	i
researchers	c
and	i
they	i
could	c
investigate	c
how	c
to	i
improve	i
ourselves	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
your	c
current	c
musical	c
show	c
which	i
I	c
saw	c
last	c
week	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
to	i
start	c
at	c
19:30	c
a	i
I	c
bought	c
my	c
ticket	c
for	c
the	c
evening	c
session	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
have	c
understood	c
a	c
little	c
bit	c
of	c
waiting	c
time	c
,	c
but	c
everybody	c
agreed	c
that	c
this	c
was	c
too	c
long	c
.	c

Second	c
,	c
instead	c
of	c
being	i
starred	i
by	i
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
the	c
musical	c
was	c
starred	i
by	i
another	c
actor	c
,	c
who	c
I	c
found	c
really	c
disappointing	c
.	c

I	c
asked	c
for	i
the	c
discounts	c
available	c
as	c
we	c
were	c
a	c
group	c
of	c
15	c
people	c
,	c
but	c
the	c
answer	c
I	c
was	c
given	c
was	c
that	c
nobody	c
had	c
ever	c
heard	c
of	c
them	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
,	c
we	c
had	c
planned	c
to	c
have	c
dinner	c
at	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
as	c
it	c
closes	c
every	c
Thursday	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
just	c
want	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
the	c
perfect	c
evening	c
that	c
the	c
advertisement	c
said	i
and	c
that	c
we	c
all	c
wished	i
turned	c
out	c
to	c
be	c
a	i
regret	i
for	i
the	c
wasted	c
money	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
including	i
my	c
ticket	c
and	c
this	c
list	c
of	c
complaints	c
as	i
the	i
reason	i
for	i
returning	i
some	c
money	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
receiving	c
your	c
decision	c
.	c

Yours	c
Faithfully	c
,	c

My	c
daily	c
life	c
has	c
changed	c
quite	c
a	c
lot	c
with	c
modern	c
technology	c
.	c

I	c
live	c
more	c
comfortably	c
and	c
even	i
more	c
carefree	c
than	c
some	i
years	c
ago	c
.	c

I	c
've	c
been	c
able	c
to	c
improve	c
some	c
things	c
that	c
could	i
have	c
annoyed	c
me	c
some	i
time	i
ago	c
,	c
and	c
although	c
they	c
're	c
mainly	c
little	c
changes	c
they	c
make	c
me	c
notice	c
that	c
my	c
life	c
is	c
easier	c
.	c

At	c
home	c
,	c
for	c
example	c
,	c
my	c
waking	i
up	i
is	c
no	c
more	i
a	c
surrounding	i
sound	c
that	c
breaks	c
the	c
silence	c
and	c
peace	c
of	c
my	c
dreams	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
now	c
the	c
good-morning	c
of	c
my	c
favourite	c
radio	c
program	i
,	c
set	c
to	c
start	c
at	c
seven	c
o'clock	c
.	c

Then	c
,	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
younger	c
I	c
would	c
have	c
to	c
put	c
the	c
milk	c
on	c
the	c
fire	i
and	c
wait	c
until	c
it	c
was	c
warm	c
enough	c
to	c
drink	c
.	c

Nowadays	c
,	c
almost	c
everybody	c
have	i
a	c
microwaves	i
oven	c
,	c
where	c
you	c
put	c
your	c
milk	c
less	i
than	c
two	c
minuts	i
and	c
it	c
is	c
ready	c
to	c
delight	c
your	c
mouth	c
.	c

Another	c
thing	c
are	i
the	c
fifty-two	c
steps	c
which	c
take	c
me	c
to	c
the	c
street	c
.	c

Also	c
,	c
with	c
the	c
development	c
of	c
Internet	i
and	c
its	c
arriving	i
to	i
a	c
great	c
number	c
of	c
homes	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
have	c
any	c
information	c
I	c
need	c
at	c
any	c
time	c
I	c
want	c
.	c

In	c
brief	c
,	c
my	i
life	i
is	i
taking	i
the	i
most	i
out	i
of	i
the	c
discoveries	c
in	i
science	c
and	c
technology	c
and	c
it	i
ca	i
n't	i
be	i
hidden	i
that	c
I	c
'm	c
really	c
glad	c
of	c
that	c
.	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
the	c
letter	c
you	c
wrote	c
to	c
me	c
to	c
inform	c
me	c
about	c
the	c
prize	c
I	c
won	c
.	c

I	i
would	c
be	c
very	c
kind	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
inform	c
me	c
about	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
with	c
me	c
and	c
which	i
clothes	c
I	c
will	c
need	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	i

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

I	c
spent	c
some	c
great	c
days	c
in	c
Vienna	c
where	c
I	c
had	c
the	c
chance	c
to	c
help	c
at	c
the	c
concert	i
of	i
"	i
pearl	i
jam	i
"	i
.	c

There	c
always	i
was	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
security	c
stuff	c
around	c
us	c
to	c
make	c
sure	c
every	i
thing	i
is	i
ok	i
,	c
because	c
there	c
really	c
were	c
thousends	i
of	c
persons	i
.	c

Then	c
we	c
had	c
time	c
to	c
listen	c
to	c
the	c
music	c
.	c

The	c
other	c
thing	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
was	c
to	c
make	c
some	c
sandwiches	c
and	c
drinks	c
just	c
before	c
they	c
returned	c
behind	i
the	i
stage	i
to	c
rest	c
a	c
little	c
bit	c
before	c
they	c
continued	c
playing	c
.	c

Edi	c
Vedder	c
even	c
talked	c
to	c
me	c
about	c
their	c
programms	i
!	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
I	c
will	c
never	c
see	c
them	c
again	c
personally	i
,	c
but	c
I	c
will	c
never	c
forget	c
those	c
two	c
days	c
-	c
being	c
so	c
close	c
to	c
them	c
,	c
unbelievable	c
!	c

Dear	c
Ms	c
Ryan	c

I	c
'm	c
very	c
pleased	c
and	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
States	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c
,	c
however	c
I	c
'm	c
free	c
only	c
in	c
July	c
.	c

Currently	c
I	c
'm	c
studying	c
in	c
England	c
and	c
the	c
school	c
finishes	c
at	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
June	c
.	c

After	c
that	c
I	c
will	c
go	c
back	c
to	c
Japan	c
and	c
continue	c
studying	c
at	c
College	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
stats	i
at	c
the	c
beginning	c
of	c
August	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
not	c
a	i
kind	c
of	c
person	c
who	c
can	c
easily	c
fall	c
a	i
sleep	i
and	c
it	c
gets	c
worse	c
when	c
I	c
am	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
.	c

At	c
the	c
Camp	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
do	c
climbing	c
and	c
golf	c
.	c

I	c
often	c
climbed	c
mountains	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
in	c
high	c
school	c
.	c

My	c
golf	c
teacher	c
is	c
my	c
father	c
and	c
I	c
've	c
only	c
played	c
in	c
a	c
practicing	i
centre	c
,	c
but	c
my	c
father	c
and	c
his	c
friends	c
say	c
I	c
have	c
good	c
talent	c
of	i
golf	c
.	c

Lastly	c
I	i
'd	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
some	c
questions	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
we	c
should	c
follow	c
our	c
time	c
table	c
if	c
we	c
make	c
a	c
video	c
about	c
daily	c
school	c
life	c
,	c
but	c
we	c
cannot	c
film	c
every	c
lessons	i
so	c
I	c
picked	c
up	i
some	c
interesting	c
ones	c
.	c

Firstly	c
we	i
should	c
defnitely	i
put	c
the	c
news	c
review	c
lesson	c
,	i
because	c
we	c
start	c
every	c
morning	c
with	c
that	c
class	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
where	c
we	c
have	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
discussion	c
.	c

Most	c
of	c
us	c
(	c
students	c
)	c
came	c
to	c
our	c
school	c
because	c
they	c
wanted	c
to	c
study	c
English	c
,	c
so	c
it	c
should	c
be	c
the	c
important	c
part	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
if	i
we	c
film	c
the	c
class	c
,	c
people	c
can	c
see	c
how	c
interesting	c
or	c
funny	c
the	c
lesson	c
is	c
.	c

Then	c
why	c
do	c
n't	c
we	c
film	c
our	c
lunch	c
time	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
also	c
important	c
,	c
is	c
n't	c
it	c
?	c

I	c
think	c
we	c
should	c
film	c
it	c
at	c
the	c
very	c
crowded	c
moment	c
so	c
that	c
people	c
can	c
see	c
we	c
have	c
to	c
wait	c
patiently	c
before	c
we	c
reach	c
our	c
foods	i
.	c

I	c
think	c
nextly	i
we	c
can	c
film	c
either	c
the	c
development	c
class	c
or	c
the	c
society	c
class	c
,	c
because	c
in	c
my	c
opinion	c
they	c
are	c
the	c
most	c
interesting	c
classes	c
apart	c
from	c
the	c
FCE	c
class	c
.	c

I	c
recently	c
had	c
a	c
week	c
's	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

There	c
are	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
differences	c
between	c
the	c
details	c
of	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
on	i
the	c
advertisement	c
and	c
the	i
ones	i
it	i
actually	i
was	i
.	c

Firstly	c
the	c
starring	i
on	i
the	c
advertisement	c
were	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c

Truelove	c
,	c
while	c
there	c
were	c
different	c
actors	c
on	i
the	c
musical	c
show	c
.	c

As	i
I	i
said	i
the	i
reasons	i
above	i
,	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
ask	c
for	c
money	i
back	c
!	c

I	c
look	c
forwards	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c

Yours	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

Janet	c
was	c
so	c
nervous	c
that	c
she	c
could	c
n't	c
stop	c
her	c
heart	c
throbbing	i
quickly	c
.	c

She	c
went	c
quietly	i
downstair	i
and	c
closed	c
the	c
door	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
she	c
went	c
into	c
her	c
room	c
.	c

At	c
that	c
moment	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
things	c
appeared	c
in	c
her	c
mind	c
which	i
seemed	c
as	i
just	i
happened	i
yesterday	c
.	c

"	c
Why	c
did	c
Mr	c
Brown	c
want	c
to	c
kill	c
me	c
?	c
"	c

She	i
said	c
to	c
herself	c
"	i
I	c
am	c
just	c
a	c
servant	c
in	c
this	c
castle	c
,	i
I	c
loves	i
him	c
so	c
much	c
and	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
want	c
anything	c
from	c
him	c
although	c
he	c
is	c
the	c
owner	c
of	c
this	c
castle.	c
"	c

Everything	c
in	c
the	c
room	c
is	i
quiet	c
except	c
the	c
sound	c
of	c
the	c
clock	c
as	i
if	c
everything	c
is	i
going	c
to	c
die	c
.	c

She	c
was	c
so	c
frighten	i
and	c
sad	c
that	c
she	c
had	c
no	c
energry	i
.	c

She	c
fell	c
down	i
onto	c
the	c
floor	c
and	c
wept	c
,	c
while	c
nobody	c
could	c
help	c
her	c

Dear	c
,	i
Sir/Madam	c

Last	c
week	c
I	c
was	c
on	c
holiday	c
and	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
The	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
to	c
see	c
over	i
the	i
rainbow	i
musical	i
.	c

I	c
was	c
really	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
seeing	c
it	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
like	c
musical	i
and	c
also	c
I	c
like	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
the	c
reading	i
actor	c
was	c
not	c
him	c
!	c

The	c
actor	c
was	c
not	c
famous	c
for	c
his	c
acting	c
.	c

Also	c
the	c
musical	c
did	c
not	c
start	c
on	c
time	c
,	i
it	i
was	c
late	i
thirty	i
minuts	i
.	c

We	c
just	c
sat	c
on	c
the	i
seat	i
and	i
nothing	c
to	c
do	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
going	c
to	c
a	c
restaurant	c
with	c
my	c
friends	c
after	c
the	c
musical	c
,	c
but	c
the	c
musical	c
finished	c
at	c
ten	c
thirty	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
too	c
late	c
and	c
we	c
could	c
not	c
have	c
a	i
dinner	c
.	c

If	c
the	c
musical	c
had	c
started	c
on	c
time	c
,	c
we	c
could	c
have	c
eaten	c
in	c
the	c
restaurant	c
.	c

Fathermore	i
,	c
discounts	i
was	i
unavailable	i
.	c

Even	c
though	c
we	c
had	c
a	c
student	c
card	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
advertisement	c
they	c
said	c
that	c
tickets	i
discounts	c
available	i
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
a	i
bombastic	i
.	c

Anyway	c
I	c
was	c
so	c
unpleasement	i
.	c

Could	c
you	c
back	i
my	c
money	c
please	c
?	c

You	c
have	c
responsoiblity	i
for	i
the	c
audiences	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

How	c
has	c
modern	c
technology	c
changed	c
your	c
daily	c
life	c
?	c

My	c
life	c
have	i
been	c
changed	c
by	c
technological	c
improving	i
.	c

We	c
have	c
so	c
many	c
technological	c
things	c
.	c

For	c
instance	c
,	c
TV	c
,	c
computers	c
,	c
telephone	i
,	c
air-conditionings	i
.	c

These	c
things	c
are	c
very	c
convinience	i
on	i
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
there	c
lots	i
of	c
disadvantage	i
point	i
.	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
need	c
balance	c
.	c

If	c
I	c
watch	c
TV	c
too	c
much	c
I	c
might	c
not	c
speak	c
to	c
my	c
family	c
often	i
.	c

I	c
think	c
I	c
should	c
cut	c
down	c
watching	i
TV	c
.	c

What	c
about	c
computers	c
?	c

It	i
is	i
very	c
useful	c
too	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
living	c
in	c
London	c
,	c
but	c
my	c
father	c
lives	c
in	c
Taiwan	c
and	c
my	c
mother	c
lives	c
in	c
Tokyo	c
.	c

If	c
I	c
use	c
e-mail	c
much	i
easier	c
and	c
cheaper	c
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
.	i

people	c
include	i
me	c
need	i
balance	c
.	c

My	c
favourite	c
season	c
of	c
the	c
year	c
is	c
summer	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
most	c
of	i
the	i
people	c
love	c
summer	c
,	c
especially	c
the	c
people	c
in	c
Greece	c

All	c
the	c
scenery	c
with	c
the	c
lovely	c
sun	c
,	c
the	c
wonderful	c
beaches	c
,	c
the	c
green	c
mountains	c
and	c
the	c
smell	c
of	c
the	c
sea	c
,	c
make	c
me	c
feel	c
great	c
.	c

I	c
live	c
in	c
Greece	c
,	c
and	c
especially	i
in	i
an	c
island	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
know	c
very	c
well	c
what	c
summer	c
means	c
.	c

Also	c
it	c
means	c
to	i
meet	i
other	c
people	c
,	c
to	i
have	i
fun	c
together	c
,	c
to	i
travel	i
at	i
all	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

When	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
London	c
,	c
during	c
my	c
holiday	c
,	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
to	c
see	c
a	c
musical	c
show	i
,	c
OVER	c
THE	c
RAINBOW	c
.	c

During	c
and	c
also	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
lots	c
of	c
disappointing	c
thing	i
turned	i
up	i
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
who	c
acted	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
someone	c
else	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
am	c
sure	c
that	c
you	c
will	c
understand	c
why	c
I	c
feel	c
so	c
frustrated	c
and	c
disappointed	c
about	c
the	c
whole	c
thing	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
farward	i
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
in	c
the	c
very	c
near	c
future	c
,	c
to	c
offer	c
me	c
the	i
money	c
back	c
.	c

"	c
Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets.	c
"	c

I	c
was	c
reading	c
when	c
I	c
suddenly	c
hard	i
a	c
big	c
bang	c
.	c

I	c
looked	c
out	c
through	c
the	c
window	c
and	c
saw	c
a	c
big	c
strange	c
"	c
thing	c
"	c
.	c

It	c
looked	c
like	c
a	c
floating	c
potato	c
,	c
a	c
brown	c
potato	c
.	c

It	c
looked	c
at	c
me	c
and	c
said	c
.	c

"	c
I	c
am	c
hear	i
to	c
help	c
you	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
not	c
belive	i
my	c
ears	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
the	c
happiest	c
moment	c
of	c
my	c
life	c
.	c

The	c
being	c
moved	c
its	c
hand	c
farward	i
and	c
.....	c

Then	c
I	c
felt	c
a	c
big	c
pain	c
in	c
my	c
head	c
and	c
heard	c
"	i
You	c
ca	c
n't	c
sleep	c
in	c
the	c
lesson	c
"	c
.	c

I	c
looked	c
up	c
and	c
saw	c
my	c
friend	c
with	c
the	c
coursebook	i
in	c
her	c
hand	c
.	c

I	c
looked	c
at	c
the	c
book	c
and	c
read	c
:	c

"	c
Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c

Dear	c

that	c
it	c

"	c
It	c
was	c
dangerous	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
knew	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
"	i
Peter	c
whispered	c
smiling	i
at	c
me	c

it	i
was	c
a	c
cold	c
,	c
stormy	c
,	c
winter	c
's	c
night	c
outside	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
hear	c
a	i
owl	c
hooting	c
in	c
the	c
tree	c
nearby	c
.	c

We	c
used	c
to	c
remember	i
our	c
daytime	i
before	c
felling	i
asleep	c
.	c

As	c
a	c
postman	c
,	c
Peter	c
,	i
had	c
to	c
deliver	c
letters	c
aroud	i
our	c
little	c

She	c
has	i
never	c

since	i
that	c
morning	c

"	c
She	c
was	c
very	c
angry	c
when	c
I	c
arrived	c

Suddenly	c
I	c
made	c
up	c
my	c
mind	c
,	c
and	c
running	c
as	c
fast	c
as	c
a	c
champion	c
horse	c
I	c
reached	c
her	c
hands	c
and	c
left	c
the	c
letter	c
,	c
then	c
I	c
went	c
away	c
quickly	c
and	c
,	c
fortunately	c
,	c
just	i
in	c
time	c
to	c
close	c
the	c
gate	c
between	c
me	c
and	c
the	c
dogs	c

It	c
started	c
when	c
I	c
received	c
the	c
advertisement	c
on	c
the	c
street	c

According	i
to	i
that	c

I	c
thought	c
I	c
'd	c
have	c
a	c
wonderful	c
night	c

The	c
first	c
problem	c

at	c
the	c

When	c
the	c

began	c
had	i

of	c
the	c

Danny	c

,	c
there	c
were	i
another	c

After	c

I	c
was	c

and	c
I	c
also	c
like	c
to	c
chat	c
with	c
other	c
people	c
or	c
maybe	c
read	c
the	c
latest	c
news	c
about	c
my	c
favorite	i
football	c
team	c
.	c

And	c
there	c
is	c
a	i
quite	i
good	c
reason	c
for	c
it	i
.	c

There	c
are	c
some	c
of	c
the	c
modern	i
techonologys	i
that	c
most	c
help	c
me	c
but	c
there	c
are	c
some	c
others	c
which	c
are	c
also	c
very	c
important	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

Dear	c
Ms.	c
Ryan	c
,	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
the	c
kind	c
letter	c
you	c
have	c
sent	c
me	c
.	c

At	c
present	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
taking	c
my	c
exams	c
and	c
am	c
fully	c
occupied	c
with	c
studying	c
.	c

However	c
I	i
will	c
be	c
free	c
in	c
July	c
-	c
but	c
please	c
not	i
that	c
this	c
is	c
the	c
only	c
time	c
I	c
'll	c
be	c
free	c
to	c
travel	c
to	c
California	c
.	c

I	c
've	c
played	c
tennis	c
for	c
eight	c
years	c
now	c
and	c
have	c
competed	c
in	c
many	c
matches	c
.	c

I	c
take	c
painting	c
as	c
my	c
hobby	c
as	c
well	c
,	c
even	c
though	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
took	i
proper	c
lessons	c
.	c

Also	c
,	c
can	c
you	c
please	c
be	c
kind	c
enough	c
to	c
tell	c
me	c
what	c
sort	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
should	c
take	c
?	c

Would	c
you	c
recommend	c
me	c
to	c
take	c
an	c
extra	c
bottle	c
of	c
sun	c
block	c
?	c

Would	c
there	c
be	c
a	c
bank	c
near	c
the	c
camp	c
?	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
taking	c
the	c
time	c
to	c
answer	c
my	c
questions	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Hi	c
!	c

How	c
are	c
you	c
?	c

Thanks	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

Okay	c
-	c
here	c
it	c
goes	c
!	c

Two	c
hours	c
before	c
the	c
concert	c
began	c
,	c
I	c
arrived	c
at	c
the	c
hall	c
.	c

Already	c
everything	c
was	c
set	c
up	c
,	c
the	c
groups	i
instruments	c
,	c
lights	c
,	c
microphones	c
...	c

I	c
quickly	c
helped	c
others	c
to	c
decorate	c
and	c
to	c
'	c
polish	c
'	c
off	c
the	c
hall	c
-	c
we	c
blew	c
up	c
as	c
my	i
balloons	c
as	c
we	c
can	i
and	c
sprayed	c
them	c
with	i
gold	c
and	c
silver	c
.	c

The	c
concert	c
went	c
terrific	i
,	c
too	c
!	c

There	c
must	c
have	c
been	c
hundreds	c
out	c
there	c
-	c
dancing	c
,	c
laughing	c
,	c
shouting.	c
.	c

and	c
I	c
was	c
having	c
a	i
time	c
of	c
my	c
life	c
!	c

I	c
handed	c
out	c
refreshment	c
to	c
the	c
pop	c
group	c
's	c
members	c
during	c
breaks	c
-	c
my	c
friends	c
were	c
so	c
jealous	c
of	c
me	c
!	c

We	c
shook	c
hands	c
and	c
they	c
even	c
wrote	c
(	c
scribbled	c
?	c
)	c
their	c
signatures	c
on	c
my	c
T-shirt	c
!	c

Really	c
,	c
Kim	c
,	c
you	c
should	c
try	c
this	c
out	c
some	c
time	c
.	c

Even	c
though	c
I	c
was	c
exhausted	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
really	c
worth	c
it	c
!	c

Anyway	c
,	c
now	c
I	c
'm	c
back	c
to	c
the	c
real	c
world	c
-	c
I	c
have	c
exams	c
next	c
week	c
,	c
wish	c
me	c
luck	c
!	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c

I	c
could	c
not	c
believe	c
it	c
!	c

In	c
addition	c
to	c
this	c
,	c
I	c
could	c
not	c
get	c
a	c
cheaper	c
ticket	c
so	c
I	c
wonder	c
why	c
the	c
advertisement	c
mentioned	c
about	i
the	c
reduction	i
tickets	i
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
despite	c
there	c
were	i
some	c
restaurants	c
in	c
the	c
theatre	c
,	c
they	i
had	i
already	i
closed	i
because	i
it	i
was	i
too	i
late	i
,	i
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
coffee	c
but	c
I	c
could	c
not	c
.	c

I	c
should	c
not	c
have	c
gone	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
musical	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
not	c
want	c
to	c
think	c
you	c
told	c
a	c
lie	c
but	c
I	c
felt	c
to	i
waste	i
my	c
time	c
and	c
money	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	i
refund	c
all	c
the	c
money	c
and	c
I	c
recommend	c
to	i
thinking	c
about	c
the	c
advertisement	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
understand	c
me	c
and	c
the	c
show	c
is	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
succeeded	i
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

She	c
was	c
one	c
of	c
my	c
friends	c
and	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
trust	c
her	c
at	c
all	c
because	c
she	c
was	c
a	c
truble	i
maker	i
.	c

One	c
year	c
ago	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
boyfriend	c
and	c
he	c
was	c
a	i
perfect	c
man	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
believed	c
that	c
I	c
get	i
married	c
to	c
him	c
although	i
my	c
happiness	c
did	c
n't	c
last	c
.	c

One	c
day	c
,	c
Pat	c
gave	c
me	c
a	c
ring	c
and	c
she	c
told	c
me	c
that	c
my	c
best	c
friend	c
was	c
going	c
out	c
with	c
my	c
boyfriend	c
in	c
secret	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
n't	c
believe	c
her	c
because	c
my	c
best	c
friend	c
was	c
a	c
boy	c
!	c

I	c
tried	c
to	c
avoid	c
thinking	c
about	c
it	c
but	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
.	c

I	c
should	c
n't	c
have	c
asked	c
him	c
!	c

And	c
then	c
I	c
asked	c
him	c
to	c
split	c
up	c
with	c
my	c
best	c
friend	c
but	c
to	c
make	c
matters	c
worse	c
,	c
he	c
chose	c
my	c
best	c
friend	c
!	c

If	c
I	c
did	i
n't	i
hear	i
from	i
Pat	i
anything	i
,	c
I	c
could	c
have	c
got	c
married	c
him	i
.	c

I	c
felt	c
sad	c
and	c
miserable	c
.	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
was	i
dreaming	i
of	c
a	c
holiday	c
for	c
such	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
.	c

Now	c
I	c
have	c
the	c
opurtuanity	i
so	c
I	c
shall	c
inform	c
you	c
fully	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
been	c
sailing	c
in	c
the	c
Mediterennean	c
for	c
eight	c
years	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
playing	c
tennis	c
for	c
four	c
years	c
so	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
choose	c
sailing	c
and	c
tennis	c
activities	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
the	i
sort	c
of	c
the	i
clothes	c
I	c
am	c
supposed	c
bring	c
.	c

I	c
know	c
that	c
I	c
will	c
need	c
sports	c
equipment	c
such	c
as	c
;	i
tennis	c
shoes	c
,	c
a	c
few	c
sport	i
shirts	c
and	c
shorts	c
.	c

What	c
's	c
my	c
fund	i
limit	i
?	c

Yours	c
Sincerely	i

I	c
received	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
not	c
want	c
to	c
keep	c
you	c
curious	c
any	c
longer	c
.	c

The	c
oppurnity	i
of	c
being	c
able	c
to	c
help	c
in	c
the	c
concert	c
knocked	c
on	c
my	c
door	c
by	c
chance	c
.	c

I	c
heard	c
they	c
were	c
looking	c
for	c
volunteers	c
to	c
help	c
at	c
the	c
pop	c
concert	c
.	c

I	c
,	c
ofcourse	i
jumped	i
into	i
it	c
.	c

The	c
idea	c
of	c
meeting	c
a	c
worldwide	i
known	i
pop	i
singer	i
;	i
just	c
made	c
my	c
heart	c
punch	c
my	c
ribcage	c
.	c

The	c
concert	c
was	i
all	i
ready	i
filled	c
up	c
with	c
thousands	c
,	i
although	c
it	c
was	c
really	c
early	c
.	c

Then	c
we	c
,	i
were	c
told	c
go	c
to	i
the	i
back	i
stage	i
and	c
make	c
sure	c
everything	c
was	c
perfect	c
.	c

After	c
a	c
fantastic	c
concert	c
I	i
actually	c
had	c
the	c
chance	c
to	c
meet	c
Britney	c
Spears	c
.	c

Waiting	c
to	c
hear	c
from	c
you	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Brown	c
,	c

At	i
last	i
would	c
you	c
tell	c
us	c
which	c
is	c
the	c
best	c
present	c
for	c
him	c
a	i
compact	c
disk	c
or	c
a	c
book	c
.	i

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
receiving	c
your	c
answer	c
and	c
do	c
n't	c
forget	c
that	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
surprice	i
birthday	c
party	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfuly	i
,	c

Family	c
life	c
in	i
our	i
days	i
is	c
very	c
important	c
because	c
both	c
of	i
parents	c
work	c
and	c
they	c
have	c
n't	c
any	c
time	c
for	c
children	i
.	c

In	c
addition	c
childrens	i
have	c
so	c
much	i
lessons	c
at	c
school	c
that	c
they	c
does	i
n't	i
have	c
enough	c
spare	c
time	c
to	c
see	c
their	c
parents	c
,	c
when	c
they	c
are	c
in	i
home	c
.	c

In	c
spide	i
that	i
fact	c
there	c
are	c
of	c
course	c
many	c
families	c
especialy	i
in	c
small	c
towns	c
which	i
eat	c
lunch	c
all	c
together	c
and	c
they	i
they	c
solve	c
their	c
problem	c
all	c
together	c
.	c

Besides	c
that	c
the	c
most	c
importand	i
is	i
that	c
this	i
children	c
have	c
an	c
easy	c
teenaties	i
and	c
they	c
have	c
n't	c
go	i
pshycological	i
problems	c
and	c
they	c
are	c
useful	c
in	c
sociaty	i
.	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
family	i
life	c
is	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
think	i
for	c
childrens	i
phycological	i
wold	i
which	c
help	i
them	c
in	c
their	c
education	c
,	c
job	c
and	c
their	c
married	i
in	c
future	c
.	c

So	c
we	c
also	c
try	c
to	c
make	c
our	c
time	c
creative	c
when	c
we	c
are	c
with	c
our	c
children	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs.	c
Ryan	c
:	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
because	c
I	c
received	c
your	c
letter	c
saying	c
that	c
I	c
won	c
first	c
prize	c
,	c
a	c
two	c
week	c
holiday	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
in	c
U.S.A	i
,	c
and	c
that	c
you	c
need	c
further	c
information	c
from	c
me	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
because	c
I	c
think	c
they	c
're	c
more	c
comfortable	c
than	c
the	i
tents	c
,	c
also	c
because	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
like	c
to	c
sleep	c
in	c
tents	c
very	c
much	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
they	c
're	c
very	c
cold	c
during	c
the	c
night	c

About	c
the	c
activities	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
chosen	c
basketball	c
because	c
I	c
enjoy	c
playing	c
it	c
,	c
and	c
also	c
because	c
I	c
know	c
very	i
well	i
how	i
to	i
play	i
.	c

I	c
used	c
to	c
be	c
the	c
captain	c
of	c
the	c
selection	i
of	i
bascketball	i
in	c
my	c
school	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
was	c
the	c
best	c
to	i
play	i
,	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
I	c
can	c
still	c
remember	c
how	c
to	c
play	c
.	c

The	c
second	c
activity	c
I	c
chose	c
was	c
tennis	c
,	i
I	c
am	c
not	c
so	c
good	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
know	c
how	c
to	c
play	c
,	i
I	c
have	c
played	c
several	c
times	c
with	c
my	c
friends	c
.	c

Another	c
thing	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
for	c
,	i
is	c
money	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
an	c
expensive	c
trip	c
and	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
enough	c
money	c
to	c
pay	c
for	c
it	c
.	c

Yours	c
Sincerely	c
,	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjouable	i
because	c
of	c
several	c
factorors	i
.	c

One	c
could	c
be	c
when	c
you	c
go	c
into	c
a	c
shop	c
and	c
you	c
can	i
find	c
something	c
that	c
you	c
like	c
,	c
and	c
you	c
decide	c
to	c
buy	c
it	c
,	c
but	c
when	c
you	c
see	c
the	c
price	c
,	c
you	c
find	c
out	c
that	c
it	c
's	c
too	c
expencive	i
,	c
and	c
you	c
cannot	c
afford	c
to	c
buy	c
it	c
.	c

The	c
only	c
thing	c
you	c
mostly	i
say	c
is	c
,	c
"	c
If	c
I	c
had	c
more	c
money	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
buy	c
it	c
"	c
,	c
or	c
"	c
I	c
wish	c
I	c
had	c
more	c
money.	c
"	c

Another	c
factor	c
could	c
be	c
when	c
you	c
are	c
in	c
a	c
shop	c
and	c
you	c
are	c
not	c
well	i
attended	c
,	i
the	i
people	c
that	c
work	c
in	c
the	c
shop	c
are	c
doing	c
other	c
things	c
,	i
and	c
cannot	c
help	c
you	c
,	c
so	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
look	c
for	c
the	c
things	c
you	c
want	c
to	c
buy	c
by	i
your	i
own	i
.	c

The	c
third	c
and	c
last	c
factor	c
would	c
be	c
when	c
you	c
like	c
a	c
certain	c
type	c
of	c
clothes	c
,	c
and	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
find	c
any	c
of	c
that	c
kind	c
.	c

Give	c
my	c
regards	c
to	c
your	c
boyfriend	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs/Mis	i

Actually	c
this	c
happened	i
because	c
the	i
most	c
things	c
I	c
saw	i
were	c
differend	i
from	c
what	c
the	c
advertisement	c
had	i
been	i
written	i
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
it	c
had	i
been	i
written	i
that	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
were	c
starring	c
,	c
but	c
Danny	c
was	c
n't	c
there	c
and	c
somebody	c
else	c
took	c
his	c
place	c
.	c

Also	c
you	c
wrote	i
that	c
the	c
show	c
it	i
was	c
going	c
to	c
start	c
at	c
19:30	c
but	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
.	c

Yours	c
senciarly	i

After	c
we	c
had	c
had	c
an	c
argument	c
she	c
told	c
all	c
the	c
school	c
my	c
secrets	c
.	c

She	c
had	i
really	i
let	i
me	i
down	i
.	c

I	c
met	i
her	c
before	i
a	i
year	i
and	c
from	c
the	c
first	c
time	c
we	c
talk	i
to	c
each	c
other	c
we	c
became	i
friends	c
.	c

It	c
took	c
us	c
a	c
few	i
time	c
to	c
became	i
best	c
friend	i
and	c
after	c
that	c
we	c
were	c
always	c
together	c
.	c

Always	i
we	i
were	i
laughing	c
and	c
having	c
great	i
time	c
.	c

Anyway	c
,	c
always	i
I	i
trust	i
her	c
my	i
secrets	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
was	c
sure	c
she	c
would	c
n't	c
tell	c
them	c
to	c
other	c
people	c
,	c
even	c
if	c
some	c
say	i
we	c
would	c
be	c
apart	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
was	c
wrong	c
again	c
.	c

She	c
started	c
to	c
act	c
like	c
them	c
and	c
speak	c
like	c
them	c
.	c

After	i
when	i
I	c
saw	c
her	c
,	c
she	c
laught	i
at	c
me	c
and	c
the	c
next	c
day	c
all	c
the	c
school	c
knew	c
everything	c
about	c
me	c
.	c

Now	c
the	c
only	c
thing	c
I	c
care	c
is	i
that	c
she	c
could	c
n't	c
keep	c
secrets	c
and	c
all	c
the	c
school	c
is	c
looking	c
down	c
on	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
won	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
!	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
really	c
big	c
surprise	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
will	c
join	c
The	c
Camp	c
California	c
in	c
the	c
U.S.A.	c
with	c
pleasure	c
.	c

In	c
June	c
and	c
in	c
August	c
I	c
will	c
have	c
to	c
work	c
,	c
so	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
rather	c
impossible	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
join	c
Camp	c
California	c
then	c
.	c

So	c
if	c
I	c
could	c
choose	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
swam	i
for	c
10	c
years	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
played	c
tennis	c
since	c
I	c
was	c
9	c
years	c
old	c
and	c
those	i
activities	i
I	i
like	i
best	c
.	c

I	c
woke	c
up	c
early	c
in	c
the	c
morning	c
and	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
go	c
shopping	c
.	c

I	c
saw	c
a	c
beautiful	c
,	c
long	c
dress	c
.	c

I	c
decided	c
to	c
try	c
it	c
on	c

What	c
is	c
your	c
size	c

Och	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
sorry	c
,	c
but	c
we	c
have	c
run	c
out	c
of	c
36	i
size	i

I	c
was	c
going	c
to	c
the	c
chemist	c
to	c
buy	c
some	c
eye-shadow	c
,	c
when	c
I	c
saw	c
black	c

I	c
said	c

-	c
I'am	i
very	c
sorry	c
but	c
we	c
do	c
not	c
have	c

.	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
angry	c
.	c

Everything	c
did	c
not	c
suit	c
me	c
!	c

It	c
was	c
enough	c

I	c
am	c

About	c

I	c
am	c
not	c

and	c
besides	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
feeling	c
a	c
little	c
sore	c
for	c
the	c
last	c
few	c
days	c
and	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
better	c
for	c
my	c
back	c
than	c
a	c
sleeping	c
bag	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
play	c
tennis	c
and	c
surfing	i
.	c

I	c
started	c
playing	c
very	c
young	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
've	c
never	c
stopped	c
playing	c
it	c
since	c
then	c
.	c

And	c
one	c
last	c
thing	c
I	i
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
about	c
which	i
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
should	i
I	i
take	c
,	c
if	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
some	c
money	c
with	c
me	c
and	c
if	c
there	c
are	c
any	c
expenses	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
pay	i
at	c
the	c

.	c

I	c
will	c
be	c
waiting	c

that	c
Jimme	c

and	c
he	c

three	c
of	c
my	c
friends	c
if	c
we	c
wanted	c
to	c
help	c
at	c
the	c

The	c

really	c
nice	c
to	c
us	c
and	c
we	c
had	c
a	c
great	c
time	c
with	c
them	c

Well	c

For	c

planing	i
to	c
go	c
to	c
this	i
threatre	i
with	c
some	c
close	c
relatives	c
and	c
friends	c
but	c
the	c
problems	c
that	c
we	c
had	c
made	c
this	c
perfect	c
night	c
a	c
disaster	c
has	i
all	c
of	c
us	c
.	c

To	c
begin	c
with	c
on	i
your	c
advertisment	i
you	c
say	c
that	c
Danny	c
Brooks	c
will	c
be	c
starring	c

but	c
instead	c
their	i
was	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
which	i
made	c
us	c
very	c
disappointed	c
.	c

Another	c
thing	c
that	c
is	c
written	i
on	i
the	c
advertisment	i
is	c
that	c
the	c
night	i
show	c
will	c
start	c
at	c
7:30	c
but	c
instead	i
of	i
that	i
their	i
was	c
forty	i
five	i
minute	c
delay	c
The	i
crowded	i
got	c
really	c
upset	c
and	c
we	c
were	c
going	c
to	c
leave	c
with	i
the	c
first	c

To	i
top	i
of	i
it	i
all	i
,	c
this	c
was	c
n't	c
the	c
perfect	c
evening	c

If	c

This	c
is	c
something	c
that	c
has	c
trabled	i
many	c
people	c
,	c
especially	c
those	c
who	c
work	c
in	c
the	c
fashion	c
industry	c
.	c

Although	i
the	c

are	c
getting	c
more	i
and	i
more	i
smaller	i
.	c

Boys	c
pearce	i
their	c

Dear	c

I	c

was	c
disapointed	i
,	c
because	c
the	c
actor	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
did	c
not	c
appeared	i
in	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

Then	c
,	c
another	c
thing	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
mention	c
is	c
that	c
the	c
time	c
advertised	c
was	c
wrong	c
,	c
because	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
.	c

It	i
also	c
puts	i
that	c
there	c
was	c
a	c
restaurant	c
to	c
eat	c
in	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
completely	c
built	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
why	c
would	i
have	c
a	c
perfect	c
evening	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
did	c
not	c
have	c
one	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
have	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

During	c
the	c
week	c
Pat	c
and	c
Peter	c
talked	c
about	c
the	c
problem	c
he	c
had	c
and	c
the	c
consequences	c
that	c
will	i
occured	i
if	c
he	c
told	i
it	i
to	i
his	i
parents	i
.	c

When	c
they	c
saw	i
the	c
film	c
,	c
Katy	c
and	c
John	c
approached	c
to	i
Peter	c
and	c
told	c
him	c
that	c
they	c
will	i
continue	c
being	c
his	c
friends	c
.	c

Peter	c
got	c
very	c
angry	c
and	c
told	i
Pat	c
why	c
did	i
they	i
say	i
that	c
to	c
him	c
.	c

Pat	c
did	c
not	c
answer	c
to	i
him	c
.	c

The	c
next	c
day	c
all	c
the	c
school	c
knew	c
that	c
Peter	c
was	c
gay	c
and	c
even	c
though	c
he	c
did	c
n't	c
mind	c
what	c
happened	i
he	c
did	c
n't	c
talked	i
with	i
Pat	c
no	i
more	i
in	c
his	c
life	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writting	i
to	c
complain	c
about	c
what	c
it	c
says	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
is	i
not	i
true	i
.	c

1	c
The	c
advertisement	c
says	c
the	c
show	c
starts	c
at	c
19:30	c
.	c

However	c
all	i
I	c
can	i
see	c
,	i
the	c
light	c
was	c
off	c
and	c
the	c
door	c
was	c
locked	c
.	c

This	c
is	c
because	c
they	c
are	c
rebuilding	c
it	c
again	c
.	c

4	c
I	c
have	i
also	i
thought	i
in	c
the	c
show	c
there	c
was	c
no	i
different	c
actor	c
.	c

5	c
Never	i
the	i
less	i
,	c
I	c
took	c
my	c
headmistress	c
with	c
me	c
and	c
I	c
have	i
recommened	i
how	c
wonderful	c
this	c
show	c
was	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
.	c

It	c
would	c
be	c
greatful	i
if	c
you	c
consider	i
to	i
return	i
my	c
money	c
for	i
the	i
tickets	i
back	i
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c

These	c
3	c

could	i
tell	c
you	c
whether	c
you	c
are	c
up-to-date	c

The	i
first	i
thing	i
for	i
fashion	i
what	i
is	i
called	i
"	i

or	i
what	i
they	i
wear	i

1st	i
"	c
F	c

is	c
from	i
"	c
fast-food	i

,	c
something	c
fast	c
and	c
easy	i
to	i
be	i
spotted	i
,	c
which	c
is	c
ancient	i
wearing	i
style	i
.	c

This	c
is	c
not	c
nomally	i
what	c
people	c
wear	c
everyday	i
.	c

3rd	i
"	c
F	c
"	c
could	c
not	c
be	c
anything	c
else	c
apart	c
from	c
something	c
that	c
could	c
make	c
you	c
look	c
"	c
fool	i
"	c
.	c

Having	c
holes	c
all	c
around	i
your	c
body	c
(	c
including	c
unsuitable	c
place	i
)	c
,	c
which	i
could	c
make	c
you	c
look	c
like	c
an	c
animal	c
such	c
as	c
having	c
a	c
big	c
metal	c
ring	c
in	c
your	c
nose	c
etc	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
the	c
theatre	i
's	i
play	c
was	c
expected	c
to	c
start	c
at	c
half	c
past	c
seven	c
in	c
the	c
afternoon	i
,	c
however	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
quarter	c
past	c
eight	c
!	c

We	c
had	c
to	c
wait	c
all	c
that	c
time	c
without	c
someone	i
to	i
explain	i
us	i
the	c
reason	c
for	c
this	c
delay	c
.	c

This	c
so-called	c
"	c
Perfect	c
Evening	c
"	c
was	c
so	i
disappointing	c
as	c
well	c
as	c
discouraging	c
of	i
coming	i
to	c
your	i
Circle	c
Theatre	c
again	c
.	c

Sincerely	c

Nowadays	c
,	c
the	i
technology	c
has	c
expanded	i
its	c
"	i
legs	i
"	i
to	c
almost	c
every	c
part	i
of	c
our	c
interests	c
,	c
jobs	c
and	c
even	c
hobbies	c
.	c

Therefore	c
,	c
our	i
life	c
has	c
changed	c
a	c
lot	c
since	c
a	c
hundred	c
years	c
ago	c
,	c
as	i
well	i
as	i
mine	i
did	i
.	c

The	c
biggest	c
achievement	c
of	c
modern	c
technology	c
has	i
broken	i
into	c
my	c
house	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
I	c
was	i
at	i
the	c
age	c
of	c
ten	c
.	c

This	c
achievement	c
is	c
the	c
personal	c
computer	c
,	c
which	c
has	c
grown	c
very	c
fast	c
,	i
because	c
of	c
the	c
help	c
it	c
can	c
provide	c
.	c

With	c
the	c
Internet	c
,	c
I	c
got	i
more	c
socialised	i
using	c
the	c
Relay	c
Chat	c
clients	c
,	c
but	c
also	c
got	i
a	c
kind	c
of	c
boredom	c
,	c
which	c
is	c
known	c
as	c
"	c
Internet	c
Freak	c
Disease	c
"	c
!	c

I	c
use	c
it	c
a	c
lot	c
so	i
sometimes	c
I	c
feel	c
pain	c
in	c
my	c
eyes	c
or	c
my	c
hands	c
.	c

Fishing	c
is	c
my	c
hobby	c
and	c
that	c
's	c
why	c
I	c
bought	c
these	i
plastic	c
worms	c
and	c
fish	c
,	i
that	c
are	c
not	c
so	c
good	c
-	c
it	c
's	c
better	c
to	c
use	c
alive	i
worms	c
!	c

Sometimes	c
these	c
gadgets	c
are	c
for	c
the	c
best	c
and	c
-	c
more	c
often	c
-	c
for	c
the	c
worst	c
!	c
!	c

It	c
only	i
depends	c
of	i
your	c
judgement	c
and	c
the	c
way	c
you	i
're	i
about	i
to	c
use	c
technology	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
received	c
your	c
letter	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
write	i
you	i
to	c
give	c
you	c
some	c
informations	i
from	i
me	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
on	i
July	c
because	c
I	c
finish	c
school	c
on	i
June	c
and	c
I	c
go	c
to	c
Great	c
Britain	c
on	i
August	c
for	c
one	c
month	c
.	c

If	c
I	c
can	c
choose	c
my	c
accomodation	i
,	c
I	c
prefer	c
living	i
in	c
tent	i
.	c

I	c
prefer	c
this	c
accomodation	i
because	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
's	c
more	i
easy	i
to	c
met	i
people	c
when	c
you	c
live	i
in	c
tent	i
,	c
near	c
them	c
,	c
than	c
when	c
you	c
live	i
in	c
log	i
cabin	c
.	c

I	c
want	c
playing	i
tennis	c
and	c
swimming	i
.	c

I	c
did	i
n't	i
play	i
tennis	c
before	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
am	c
not	c
good	c
.	c

Could	c
you	c
tell	c
me	c
what	c
sort	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
will	c
have	c
to	c
wear	c
to	c
play	c
tennis	c
?	c

Could	c
you	c
tell	c
me	c
if	c
I	c
will	c
need	c
money	c
for	c
paid	i
my	c
dinners	c
?	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
.	c

There	c
is	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
activities	c
and	c
lessons	c
at	c
our	c
school	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
's	c
difficult	c
to	c
chose	i
some	c
of	c
them	c
.	c

We	c
could	c
show	c
team	i
spirit	c
of	c
our	c
school	c
with	i
sport	i
activities	c
like	c
soccer	c
,	c
basketball	c
or	c
handball	c
.	c

We	c
could	c
also	c
show	c
cultural	c
activities	c
:	c
there	c
is	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
clubs	i
of	i
music	i
or	i
painting	c
in	i
our	c
school	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
could	c
be	c
interested	i
to	c
show	c
how	c
students	c
work	c
to	c
write	c
the	c
new	i
paper	i
of	i
school	i
.	c

At	c
the	c
end	c
,	c
we	c
can	c
also	c
show	c
where	c
we	c
can	c
be	c
relaxed	c
.	c

All	c
this	i
activities	c
which	c
should	c
be	c
filmed	c
,	i
are	c
our	i
daily	c
life	c
at	c
our	c
school	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
the	c
guests	i
stars	c
who	c
were	c
supposed	c
to	c
play	i
were	c
different	c
and	i
very	c
disappointing	c
because	c
they	c
stopped	c
the	c
show	c
twice	c
.	c

But	c
the	c
worst	c
happened	c
when	c
the	c
show	c
finished	c
,	c
because	c
we	c
(	c
my	c
girlfriend	c
and	c
I	c
)	c
were	c
hungry	c
and	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

Maybe	c
,	c
this	c
was	c
the	c
worst	c
show	c
I	c
have	c
ever	c
seen	c
and	c
for	c
this	c
I	i
'll	c
wait	c
for	c
the	i
refund	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
so	c
we	c
could	c
n't	c
explain	i
her	c
what	c
happened	c
that	c
night	c
.	c

Jon	c
had	c
crashed	c
with	i
Pat	c
's	c
boyfriend	i
car	c
and	c
he	c
told	c
her	c
that	c
someone	c
had	c
kicked	i
the	c
car	c
with	c
a	c
metal	c
stick	c
.	c

Pat	c
's	c
boyfriend	c
could	c
n't	c
believe	c
that	c
story	c
but	c
Pat	c
trusted	c
in	i
Jon	c
and	c
she	c
thinked	i
that	c
he	c
was	c
honest	c
.	c

Now	c
Pat	c
is	c
angry	c
with	c
us	c
because	c
we	c
did	c
n't	c
explain	i
her	c
what	c
happened	c
that	c
night	c
,	c
and	c
because	c
she	c
has	c
left	c
her	c
boyfriend	c
.	c

FIRST	c

ALL	c
I	i
WOULD	c

MY	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c

because	c
my	c
hollydays	i
are	c
only	c
on	i
it	i
and	c
the	c
wheather	i
in	c
California	c
is	c
better	c
.	i

I	c
am	c
that	c
kind	c
of	c
person	c
who	c
enjoy	i
to	i
have	i
a	c
wild	c
and	c
simple	c
life	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
prefer	c
to	c
be	i
accommodated	i
in	c
tents	c
.	c

About	c
the	c
activities	c
,	c
the	c
first	c
one	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
do	c
is	c
play	c
basketball	c
which	i
I	c
have	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
experience	c
.	i

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
some	c
more	c
information	c
about	c
the	c
Camp	c
,	c
before	c
I	c
left	i
,	i
which	i
clothes	c
are	c
more	i
appropriate	c
and	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
should	c
I	c
take	c
with	c

Yours	c

Dear	c
Kim	c

How	c
is	c
everything	c
?	c

Is	c
your	c
dog	c
better	c
?	c

Well	c
here	c
I	c
'm	c
very	c
fine	c
.	c

In	c
your	c
last	c
letter	c
said	i
that	c
you	c
want	c
to	c
know	c
about	c
my	c
experience	c
at	c
the	c
pop	c
concert	c
.	c

There	c
I	c
helped	c
with	c
the	c
special	c
effects	c
and	c
the	c
sound	c
.	c

They	c
liked	c
me	c
so	c
much	c
and	c
invited	c
me	c
to	c
be	c
the	i
responsable	i
with	i
lights	i
and	c
sound	c
.	c

I	c
told	c
then	i
that	c
I	c
will	c
think	c
about	c
it	c
but	c
I	c
belive	i
I	c
will	c
accept	c
the	c
job	c
.	c

The	c
most	c
increible	i
part	c
was	c
the	c

Next	c
time	c
I	c
'll	c
take	c
you	c
and	c
your	c
friend	c
Monica	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
shure	i
that	c
you	c

Please	c

Love	c
and	c
Peace	c

about	i
the	c
things	c
you	c
asked	c
me	c
in	c
your	c
letter	c
I	i
would	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
camp	c
California	c
on	i
july	i
because	c
that	c
's	c
the	c
month	c
when	c
I	i
go	i
out	i
from	i
school	i
and	c
I	c
have	c
my	c
vacations	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
much	c
easier	c
that	c
month	c
.	c

About	c
my	c
acommodations	i
in	i
the	c
camp	c
I	i
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
because	c
it	c
's	c
safer	c
than	c
being	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
and	c
because	c
you	c
sleep	c
more	c
confortable	i
.	c

The	c
activities	c
that	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
do	c
are	c
signing	i
because	i
my	c
friend	c
told	c
me	c
that	c
im	i
good	c
at	c
it	c
.	i

and	c
the	c
other	c
activitie	i
that	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
do	c
is	c
climbing	c
because	c
I	c
thing	i
it	c
very	i
exciting	c
although	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
tried	c
climbing	c
.	i

How	c
many	c
jeans	c
,	c
Pants	c
,	c
sweater	i
etc	c
...	c

do	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
?	c
and	i
how	c
much	c
money	c
would	i
I	c
need	c
to	c
bring	c
in	c
my	c
pocket	c
?	c

I	c
appreciate	c
that	i
opportuniti	i
that	c
you	c
are	c
giving	c
to	i
me	c
and	c
Im	i
very	c
thankful	i

I	c
have	c
a	c
cousin	c
that	c
works	c
as	c
a	i
organizer	c
for	c
all	c
the	c
bands	c
that	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
concert	c
in	c
brazil	i
and	c
when	c
my	c
cousin	c
knew	c
that	c
my	c
favorite	i
band	c
was	c
coming	c
he	c
called	c
me	c
and	c
told	i
me	c
that	i
if	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
help	c
them	c
to	c
install	c
the	c
speakers	c
,	c
microphones	c
etc	c
...	c

and	c
I	c
said	c
"	i
sureman	i
"	i

That	c
night	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
stadium	c
and	c
I	c
met	c
the	c
singer	i
his	i
name	c
is	c
saul	c
HernaÃ±dez	c
and	c
he	c
is	c
very	c
funny	i
that	i
night	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
fun	c
with	c
them	c
and	c
of	c
course	c
I	c
was	c
on	i
the	c
first	c
line	i
in	i
the	c
concert	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
the	c
best	c
day	c
of	c
my	c
life	c

I	c
hope	c

are	c
having	c
fun	c
and	c
that	c
you	c
are	c
OK	c

Dear	c
manager	i
of	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c

Last	c
Sanday	i
my	c
friends	c
and	c
I	c
saw	c
that	c
advertisement	c
about	c
the	c
theatre	i
you	c
were	c
supposed	c
to	c
present	i
.	c

We	c
thought	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
good	c
chance	c
for	c
us	c
to	c
watch	c
it	c
.	c

We	c
went	c
there	c
on	c
time	c
.	c

We	c
waited	c
ther	i
for	c
forty	i
five	i
minutes	c
for	c
it	c
to	c
start	c
!	c

We	c
were	c
very	c
disappointed	c
because	c
before	c
this	c
happened	c
we	c
pouded	i
the	c
tickets	c
but	c
there	c
were	c
no	c
discounts	c
available	c
.	c

We	c
did	c
see	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
but	c
we	c
did	c
not	c
see	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
.	c

That	c
was	c
very	c
disapponted	i
.	c

Fortunately	c
the	c
show	c
finished	c
.	c

We	c
decided	c
to	c
visit	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
.	c

But	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
!	c
!	c

When	c
we	c
asked	c
why	c
was	i
it	i
closed	c
the	i
people	c
there	c
told	c
us	c
that	c
they	c
did	c
not	c
organized	i
it	c
before	c

And	c
please	c
do	c
not	c
be	c
very	c
suprised	i
If	i
you	c
recieve	i
more	c
letters	c
about	c
this	c

I	c
did	i
a	c
big	c
mistake	c
by	c
trusting	c
him	c
.	c

She	c
told	c
me	c
to	c
tell	c
none	i
.	c

We	c
did	c
n't	c
want	c
out	i
grand-mother	i
to	c
find	c
it	i
out	c
at	c
that	c
moment	c
so	c
we	c
was	i
trying	c
to	c
keep	c
it	c
secret	c
.	c

I	c
knew	c
Pat	c
,	c
my	c
cousin	c
,	c
loved	c
our	c
grandmother	c
very	c
much	c
.	c

She	c
and	c
Pat	c
had	c
a	c
special	c
relationship	c
.	c

Despite	c
the	c
fact	c
that	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
tell	i
nothing	c
I	i
thought	c
it	c
was	c
right	c
to	c
tell	c
Pat	c
the	c
truth	c
.	c

After	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
thought	c
I	c
told	c
it	i
to	i
him	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
was	c
sure	c
he	c
would	c
tell	i
nothing	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
wrong	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
n't	c
do	c
anything	c
.	c

He	c
found	c
her	c
there	c
.	c

And	c
the	c
worst	c
happened	c
.	c

Pat	c
my	i
sister	c
and	c
I	c
felt	c
very	c
rensposible	i
.	c

But	c
there	c
was	c
nothing	c
we	c
could	c
do	c
.	c

We	c
knew	c
we	c
had	c
lost	c
her	c
for	c
ever	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
one	c
of	c
your	c
husband	c
's	c
students	c
.	c

We	c
will	c
have	c
food	c
and	c
drink	c
and	c
we	c
will	c
have	c
music	c
because	c
we	c
know	c
that	c
Mr	c
Brown	c
loves	c
music	c
.	c

My	c
fellow	c
students	c
have	c
suggested	c
to	i
buy	i
a	c
CD	c
or	c
a	c
Book	i
.	c

We	c
would	c
like	c
to	i
tell	c
us	c
which	c
is	c
the	c
best	c
present	c
for	c
him	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c
.	c

John	c
said	c
he	c
had	c
some	c
good	c
news	c
to	c
tell	c
me	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
could	c
se	i
that	c
his	c
face	c
was	c
happy	c
and	c
he	c
did	i
n't	i
tell	i
lies	c
.	c

I	c
stopped	c
talking	c
to	c
my	c
friends	c
and	c
I	c
followed	c
him	c
.	c

We	c
started	c
walking	c
and	c
walking	c
.	c

We	c
wait	i
there	c
for	c
an	c
hour	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
really	c
angry	c
.	c

I	c
wanted	c
t	i
know	c
why	c
we	c
were	c
there	c
.	c

At	c
that	c
moment	c
we	c
saw	c
the	c
bus	c
to	i
come	i
,	c
it	c
stopped	c
and	c
one	c
man	c
come	i
and	c
sit	i
near	c
of	i
us	c
.	c

I	c
could	i
recognise	i
him	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
true	c
my	i
father	c
has	i
come	c
at	i
his	c
country	c
after	c
five	c
years	c
.	c

Now	c
all	c
the	c
problems	c
will	c
finish	c
and	c
we	c
will	c
start	c
a	c
new	c
life	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
allowed	i
to	i
take	i
holiday	i
only	i
in	c
July	c
.	c

Concerning	c
accommodation	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
log	c
cabins	c
.	c

Log	c
cabins	c
are	c
bigger	c
,	c
more	c
stable	c
and	c
usually	c
more	c
comfortable	c
than	c
tents	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
know	c
if	c
I	c
need	c
any	c
particular	c
clothes	c
or	c
if	c
there	c
could	c
be	c
any	c
extra	c
expenses	c
for	c
the	c
camp	c
.	c

Also	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
if	c
there	c
is	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
qualified	i
instructor	c
for	c
activities	c
since	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
beginning	i
in	i
sailing	c
as	c
mentioned	c
before	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Kan	c
Seo	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

Thanks	c
for	c
your	c
last	c
letter	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
great	c
to	c
hear	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
sorry	c
I	c
have	c
n't	c
written	c
before	c
,	c
but	c
as	c
you	c
know	c
,	c
I	c
've	c
been	c
very	c
busy	c
because	c
I	c
was	c
helping	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
last	c
month	c
.	c

I	c
helped	c
people	c
setting	c
and	i
decorating	c
the	c
concert	c
hall	c
which	c
was	c
great	c
help	c
for	c
my	c
major	c
subject	c
-	c
You	c
know	c
that	c
my	c
subject	c
is	c
design	c
.	c

What	c
I	c
particularly	c
enjoyed	c
was	c
meeting	c
the	c
famous	c
musicians	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
dreaming	c
to	i
see	i
.	c

Write	c
son	i
and	c
let	c
me	c
know	c
what	c
you	c
have	c
been	c
doing	c
.	c

Lots	c
and	c
lots	c
of	c
kisses	c
,	c

How	c
are	c
you	c
?	c

I	c
'm	c
not	c
so	c
well	c
,	c
and	c
that	c
's	c
the	c
reason	c
why	c
I	c
'm	c
writting	i
this	c
letter	c
to	c
you	c
.	c

Because	c
you	c
are	c
the	c
manager	c
at	i
the	c
theatre	c
,	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
know	c
,	i
the	i
problems	c
which	c
it	c
has	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
and	i
the	c
most	c
important	c
for	c
me	c
is	i
that	c
you	c
lie	c
to	c
your	c
audience	c
.	c

Oh	c
!	c

I	c
as	i
almost	c
forget	i
.	c

You	i
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
your	c
cooker	i
was	c
ill	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
that	c
's	c
why	c
I	c
'm	c
asking	c
you	c
to	c
give	c
me	c
,	i
some	c
of	c
money	i
back	c
.	c

How	c
has	c
modern	c
technology	c
changed	c
your	c
daily	c
life	c
?	c

That	c
's	c
a	c
good	c
question	c
!	c

I	c
know	c
that	c
,	i
each	c
student	c
gave	i
its	i
different	i
answers	i
,	c
but	c
some	c
of	c
us	c
will	c
have	c
some	c
opinions	i
.	c

With	c
the	i
telephones	c
,	c
the	i
aeroplanes	c
,	c
even	i
the	i
fast	c
ships	c
there	i
are	c
no	c
big	c
distances	c
any	c
more	c
.	c

Eve	i
summer	c
I	i
'm	i
going	i
with	i
my	i
family	i
abroad	i
.	c

We	c
can	c
see	c
new	c
countries	c
,	c
learn	c
about	c
their	c
history	c
etc.	c
With	c
my	c
computer	c
(	c
internet	i
)	c
I	c
can	c
speak	c
with	i
my	c
friends	c
,	i
as	i
far	i
they	c
are	c
.	c

Children	c
are	c
not	c
studying	c
as	c
much	c
they	i
have	i
to	c
,	c
because	c
they	c
are	c
watching	c
T.V	i
,	c
speacing	i
on	c
the	c
phone	c
or	c
even	c
playing	c
computer	c
games	c
.	c

That	c
's	c
why	c
my	c
marks	c
this	c
year	c
were	c
bit	i
low	c
.	c

Dear	c
Ms	c
Ryan	c

The	c
second	c
week	c
of	c
July	c
would	c
be	c
perfect	c
to	c
start	c
my	c
trip	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
rather	c
sleep	c
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
.	c

The	c
leisure	c
activities	c
sound	c
fantastic	c
especially	i
climbing	c
and	c
photography	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
very	c
keen	c
on	c
climbing	c
.	c

I	i
've	i
joined	i
a	c
climbing	c
group	i
in	c
my	c
town	c
2	i
years	c
and	i
reached	i
the	c
top	c
of	c
several	c
middle-high	c
mountains	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
some	c
questions	c
that	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
about	i
.	c

Do	c
I	c
need	c
passport	i
to	c
travel	c
?	c

What	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
would	c
be	c
appropriate	c
,	c
winter	c
or	c
summer	c
?	c

Are	c
there	c
any	c
food	i
service	i
at	c
the	c
camp	c
?	c

I	c
hope	c
to	c
hear	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

This	c
is	c
a	c
report	c
to	c
plan	c
and	c
suggest	c
ideas	c
for	c
the	c
daily	i
life	i
video	c
at	c
school	c
.	c

The	c
opening	c
time	i
recording	i
the	c
students	c
while	c
they	c
meet	c
outside	c
the	c
school	c
and	c
come	c
in	c
could	i
be	c
a	c
good	c
begining	i
.	c

It	c
would	c
reflect	c
the	c
atmosphere	c
when	c
they	c
meet	c
early	c
in	c
the	c
morning	c
.	c

Filming	c
lessons	c
such	c
as	c
grammar	c
lessons	c
and	c
speaking	i
either	i
theory	i
lessons	i
or	i
practice	i
would	c
give	c
a	c
general	c
idea	c
about	c
a	c
day	c
at	c
school	c
and	c
how	c
students	c
work	c
on	c
their	c
lessons	c
.	c

And	c
they	c
'll	c
certainly	c
feel	c
very	c
proud	c
of	c
being	c
at	i
the	c
video	c
.	c

The	c
musical	i
lessons	c
and	c
the	c
singing	c
club	c
in	c
the	c
afternoon	c
are	c
very	c
popular	c
among	c
the	i
students	c
of	i
all	c
courses	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
if	c
we	c
mix	c
lessons	c
with	c
sport	i
activities	c
the	c
combination	c
will	c
give	c
us	c
complete	c
success	c
.	c

Your	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
musical	c
show	i
,	i
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
,	i
said	c
it	c
was	c
London	c
's	c
newest	c
and	c
best	c
musical	c
show	c
,	i
I	c
agree	c
with	c
that	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
wonderfull	i
show	c
but	c
,	i
it	c
said	c
that	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
would	c
be	c
starring	c
in	c
it	c
.	c

The	c
show	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
when	c
it	c
actually	c
should	c
have	c
started	c
at	c
19:30	c
.	c

On	i
the	c
advertisment	i
it	c
also	c
said	c
,	i
you	c
could	c
visit	c
our	i
restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
and	c
that	c
is	c
what	c
I	c
did	c
,	c
but	c
when	c
I	c
got	c
there	c
it	c
was	c
shut	c
for	c
no	c
reason	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

As	c
we	c
know	c
,	c
Carla	c
and	c
Pat	c
were	c
good	c
friends	c
so	c
Carlotta	c
would	c
tell	c
Pat	c
anything	c
.	c

Jacob	c
runs	c
as	c
fast	c
as	c
sound	c
to	c
get	c
to	c
Charles	c
's	c
house	c
.	c

There	c
,	c
Jacob	c
aproaches	i
to	i
him	c
slowly	c
and	c
tells	c
him	c
.	c

"	c
Charles	c
,	c
you	c
ca	c
n't	c
be	c
with	c
Carlotta	c
anymore	c
,	c
she	c
's	c
evil.	i
"	c

"	c
She	c
said	c
she	c
was	c
going	c
to	c
kill	c
you	c
!	c
"	c

"	c
I	c
'll	c
talk	c
to	c
her.	i
"	c

Charles	c
exclaims	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
all	c
a	c
missunderstanding	i
.	c

They	c
managed	c
to	c
sort	c
everything	c
out	c
and	c
Carlotta	c
never	c
had	c
anymore	c
secrets	c
.	c

My	c
name	c
is	c
Alois	c
Blau	c
and	c
I	c
'm	c
very	c
happy	c
that	c
I	c
've	c
won	c
this	c
competition	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
,	i
that	c
's	c
possible	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
living	i
in	c
a	c
tent	c
during	c
the	c
two	c
weeks	c
because	c
I	c
think	c
a	c
tent	c
is	c
more	i
natural	i
.	c

It	c
sounds	c
like	c
a	c
summer-holiday	i
at	i
the	c
beach	i
of	c
Italy	c
.	c

From	c
the	c
activities	c
I	i
want	c
to	i
take	i
Golf	i
and	i
Surfing	i
.	c

But	c
the	c
reason	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
try	c
these	c
two	c
activities	c
are	i
their	c
image	c
.	c

Golf	c
play	i
the	i
wealthy	c
people	c
,	c
the	i
upper	i
class	i
of	i
a	i
town	i
,	c
and	c
surfing	c
sounds	c
like	c
freedom	c
.	c

There	c
is	c
only	c
one	c
more	c
question	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
ask	c
:	c
Can	i
I	c
take	c
my	c
girl-friend	i
with	c
me	c
,	c
of	i
course	i
with	i
paying	i
?	c

I	c
hope	c
all	c
my	c
wishes	c
are	c
realizeable	i
.	c

Yours	c

I	c
think	c
,	i
you	c
ca	c
n't	c
really	c
enjoy	c
shopping	c
when	c
there	c
are	c
hundreds	c
of	c
people	c
and	c
everyone	c
wants	c
to	c
buy	c
something	c
.	c

I	c
like	c
going	c
shopping	c
during	c
the	c
week	c
,	c
when	c
I	c
can	c
look	c
at	c
each	c
good	i
a	c
store	c
sells	c
.	c

Then	c
,	c
the	c
musical	c
did	c
n't	c
start	c
on	c
time	c
.	c

It	c
supposed	i
to	c
start	c
at	c
19.30	c
pm	c
in	c
the	c
evening	c
but	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
wait	c
for	c
more	c
than	c
half	c
an	c
hour	c
.	c

All	c
the	c
people	c
got	c
very	c
angry	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
n't	c
have	c
my	c
ticket	c
discounted	c
because	c
when	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
buy	c
it	c
they	c
told	c
me	c
that	c
was	c
untrue	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
in	i
the	c
advertisement	c
was	i
put	i
that	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
opened	i
but	c
when	c
we	c
went	c
there	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
the	c
chief	i
of	i
the	i
restaurant	i
was	c
ill	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
ridiculous	c
!	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
have	c
my	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
,	c
in	c
other	c
words	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
very	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
so	c
I	c
am	c
asking	c
you	c
for	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
have	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
in	c
ten	c
days	c
,	c
in	i
the	i
other	i
case	i
,	c
I	c
would	i
have	c
to	c
sue	c
you	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
telling	c
you	c
this	c
because	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
big	c
trouble	i
a	c
few	c
days	c
ago	c
because	c
of	c
her	c
.	c

I	c
used	c
to	c
tell	c
Pat	c
everything	c
about	c
myself	c
-	c
my	c
problems	c
with	c
my	c
parents	c
,	c
my	c
problems	c
with	c
the	c
school	c
,	c
friends	c
and	c
more	c
.	c

At	c
first	c
,	c
I	c
thought	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
bit	c
strange	c
but	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
care	c
too	c
much	c
about	c
that	c
and	c
I	c
easily	c
forgot	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
started	c
to	c
get	c
along	c
with	c
other	c
people	c
and	c
had	c
new	c
friends	c
but	c
I	c
continued	c
telling	c
Pat	c
my	c
secrets	c
.	c

My	c
new	c
friends	c
sometimes	c
talked	c
to	c
me	c
about	c
Pat	c
and	c
they	c
asked	c
me	c
once	c
if	c
we	c
were	c
close	c
friends	c
.	c

I	c
asked	c
them	c
why	c
they	c
had	c
asked	c
me	c
that	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
they	c
had	c
already	c
knew	i
all	c
my	c
secrets	c
for	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
!	c

I	c
got	c
very	c
angry	c
and	c
immediately	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
talk	c
to	c
Pat	c
.	c

I	c
thanked	c
my	c
new	c
friends	c
for	c
not	c
to	i
tell	i
anybody	c
my	c
secrets	c
though	i
before	c
the	c
trouble	c
they	i
and	i
me	i
were	c
n't	c
very	c
friends	i
.	c

Now	c
I	c
'm	c
very	c
happy	c
with	c
my	c
new	c
friends	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
learnt	c
that	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
trust	c
anybody	c
too	c
much	c
because	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
really	c
know	c
how	i
the	c
person	c
is	c
like	c
.	c

Mr.	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
's	c
Manager	c

I	c
cannot	c
bear	c
when	i
somebody	c
says	c
something	c
and	c
then	c
does	c
just	c
the	c
opposit	i
way	i
.	c

To	c
begin	c
with	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
inform	c
you	c
,	c
in	c
case	c
you	c
do	c
not	c
know	c
that	i
the	c
play	c
does	c
not	c
start	c
at	c
19.30	c
as	c
it	c
says	c
.	i

It	c
should	c
be	c
opened	i
at	c
least	c
until	c
all	i
people	i
gets	c
out	c
of	c
the	c
place	c
.	c

It	c
must	c
be	c
our	c
decission	i
whether	c
to	c
stay	c
and	c
eat	c
there	c
,	c
or	c
not	c
.	c

To	i
make	i
it	i
shorter	i
,	c
because	c
of	c
everything	c
I	c
have	c
said	c
before	i
,	c
the	c
correct	c
thing	c
to	i
do	i
for	i
me	i
is	c
to	c
ask	c
for	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
,	c
and	c
for	c
you	c
is	i
just	c
giving	i
it	c
back	c
to	c
me	c
because	c
of	c
all	c
the	c
troubles	i
and	c
disappointings	i
feeling	i
you	c
made	i
me	c
suffer	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hear	i
from	c
you	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c

HOW	c
HAS	c
TECHNOLOGY	c
CHANGED	c
OUR	c
DAYLY	i
LIFES	i

In	i
times	i
of	i
our	i
grandparents	i
life	c
was	c
so	c
different	c
,	i
that	c
we	c
cannot	c
beleive	i
that	c
this	c
huge	c
change	c
to	c
our	c
day	i
life	c
happened	c
in	c
only	c
one	c
hundred	c
years	c
or	c
less	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
as	c
we	c
all	c
know	c
,	c
day	i
life	c
now	i
a	i
days	i
is	c
quite	c
simplier	i
and	c
an	c
example	c
of	c
this	c
is	c
that	c
instead	c
of	c
buying	c
a	c
peice	i
of	c
ice	c
to	c
cool	c
drinks	c
(	c
as	c
our	c
grandparents	c
used	c
to	c
do	c
)	c
we	c
not	c
only	c
have	c
a	c
refrigerator	c
but	c
also	c
a	c
freezer	c
in	c
case	c
you	c
want	c
it	c
faster	c
and	c
cooler	i
.	c

Strange	c
as	c
it	c
seems	c
,	c
we	c
now	c
can	i
have	c
every	i
machine	i
or	c
especialized	i
technology	c
to	c
make	c
our	c
dayly	i
life	c
more	c
confortable	i
and	c
less	c
workable	i
.	c

Things	c
that	c
human	c
beings	c
used	c
to	c
do	c
,	i
now	i
are	i
being	c
done	c
by	c
computers	c
and	c
machines	c
more	c
efficiently	c
and	c
rapidly	c
.	c

One	i
the	i
other	i
hand	i
,	c
despite	c
the	c
fact	c
that	c
technology	c
make	i
things	c
easier	c
in	c
our	c
day	i
life	c
,	c
the	c
same	c
happens	c
in	c
industries	c
and	c
companies	c
where	c
they	c
use	c
computers	c
and	c
machines	c
instead	c
of	c
people	c
.	c

With	c
advantages	c
and	c
disadvantages	c
,	c
technology	c
is	c
in	i
our	i
life	i
and	c
may	c
represent	c
an	c
advance	c
for	c
some	c
and	c
a	c
bad	c
thing	c
for	c

am	c
writing	c

had	c
some	c
problems	c
in	c
my	c
full-time	c

so	c

About	c

I	i
would	c

careful	c

Hi	c
.	c

Well	c
,	c
I	c
've	c
been	c
very	c
busy	c
you	i
know	c
.	c

Two	c
weeks	c
ago	c
I	c
enrolled	c
in	c
a	c
group	c
to	c
help	c
on	i
building	c
a	c
stage	c
for	c
a	c
concert	c
of	i
a	c
famous	c
singer	c
star	i
.	c

Activities	i
lasting	i
almost	c
2	c
days	i
and	i
a	i
half	i
.	c

The	c
first	c
day	c
we	c
have	i
to	c
move	i
to	c
the	c
airport	c
to	c
bring	c
all	c
the	c
equipment	c
by	c
lorries	i
to	c
the	c
camp	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
really	c
awful	c
and	c
hard	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
had	i
this	c
oportunitty	i
one	c
day	c
,	c
you	c
had	c
better	c
buy	c
the	c
ticket	c
to	c
the	c
concert	c
or	c
just	c
watch	c
it	c
on	c
TV	c
but	c
never	c
do	c
something	c
like	c
just	i
to	c
get	c
a	c
free	c
pass	c
.	c

My	i
regards	i
to	c
your	c
family	c
.	c

Write	c
me	i
soon	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
show	i
you	c
how	c
disappointed	c
I	c
am	c
about	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
you	c
manage	c
.	c

As	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
whole	c
week	i
holiday	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
spend	c
it	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

At	c
first	c
I	c
though	i
I	c
would	c
just	c
make	i
a	c
bit	c
of	c
sight-seeking	i
all	c
around	c
the	c
city	c
.	c

No	c
sooner	c
had	c
I	c
seen	c
the	i
starring	c
actor	c
than	i
I	c
could	c
n't	c
believe	c
it	c
.	c

Danny	c
Brook	c
was	c
one	c
of	c
my	c
best	c
friends	c
while	c
I	c
was	c
at	c
University	c
.	c

But	c
as	c
the	c
show	c
began	c
,	c
I	c
realised	c
that	c
the	c
actor	c
was	c
someone	c
different	c
,	c
his	c
name	c
was	c
Tim	c
Paradise	c
.	c

If	c
this	c
had	c
been	c
my	c
only	c
disappointment	c
nothing	c
would	c
have	c
happened	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
wait	c
stil	i
quarter	c
past	c
eight	c
in	i
order	i
to	c
watch	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
instead	c
of	c
beggining	i
at	c
half	c
past	c
seven	c
as	c
you	c
had	c
written	c
in	c
your	c
advertisement	c
.	c

As	c
a	c
conclution	i
of	i
that	c
horrible	c
evening	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
visit	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
once	c
the	c
show	c
had	c
finished	c
,	c
but	c
what	c
a	c
surprise	c
when	c
I	c
found	c
it	c
closed	c
.	c

For	c
all	c
of	c
these	c
reasons	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
for	i
having	i
my	i
money	c
back	c
.	c

Sincerely	c
:	c

a	c
disappointed	c
user	i
!	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

All	i
began	c
when	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
take	c
part	c
in	c
that	c
school	c
project	c
.	c

It	c
consisted	c
in	c
having	c
to	c
memorisize	i
a	c
whole	c
book	c
of	c
250	c
pages	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
pass	c
a	c
final	c
exam	c
.	c

One	c
day	c
as	c
I	c
was	c
talking	c
with	c
my	c
teacher	c
about	c
the	c
project	c
I	c
saw	c
what	c
it	i
could	c
be	c
the	c
final	c
answer	c
sheet	c
exam	i
on	c
the	c
top	c
of	c
his	c
desk	c
.	c

Suddenly	i
,	c
when	c
the	c
teacher	c
went	c
out	c
of	c
his	c
office	c
,	c
I	c
quickly	c
copied	c
the	c
answers	c
on	i
my	c
notebook	c
,	i
I	c
could	c
n't	c
believe	c
it	c
,	i
that	i
would	c
be	c
the	c
easiest	c
exam	c
I	c
would	c
had	i
ever	i
done	i
.	c

As	c
I	c
went	c
out	c
of	c
the	c
office	c
I	c
found	c
walking	i
down	i
the	i
corridor	i
Pat	i
,	i
my	i
best	i
friend	i
.	c

As	c
she	c
was	c
also	c
making	i
the	c
project	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
let	c
her	c
copy	c
the	c
answers	c
.	c

She	c
agreed	c
and	c
went	c
home	c
very	c
happy	c
.	c

Almost	c
all	c
my	c
class	i
mates	i
were	c
in	i
the	c
front	c
door	c
of	c
my	c
house	c
asking	c
me	c
if	c
I	c
had	c
the	c
solutions	i
of	i
the	c
exam	c
.	c

In	i
the	c
exam	c
day	c
everybody	c
anwered	i
correctly	i
to	i
each	i
question	i

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
informing	c
me	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
the	c
competition	c
.	c

Finally	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
practise	i
basketball	c
and	c
swimming	c
,	c
because	c
in	c
my	c
school	c
I	c
used	c
to	c
train	i
those	c
sports	c
a	c
lot	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c

Yours	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c

Nowadays	c
most	c
of	i
the	i
people	c
are	c
atractted	i
by	i
shopping	c
centers	c
,	c
which	c
is	i
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
some	c
opinions	c
to	i
this	c
,	c
which	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
tell	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
I	i
think	c
people	c
have	c
to	c
be	c
careful	c
in	i
the	c
things	c
that	c
they	c
buy	c
because	c
probably	c
are	i
not	c
a	i
good	c
quality	c
,	c
this	i
is	c
very	c
annoyed	i
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
people	c
have	c
to	c
look	c
after	c
their	c
money	c
in	c
the	c
shops	c
,	c
and	c
do	i
n't	i
spend	c
it	c
in	i
the	i
thing	i
that	c
they	c
do	c
n't	c
need	c
because	i
by	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
the	c
month	c
they	c
wo	c
n't	c
have	c
money	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
I	c
have	i
seen	i
last	c
Friday	c
in	c
your	c
theatre	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
your	c
advertisement	c
about	i
it	c
was	c
n't	c
true	c
!	c

Firstly	c
,	c
it	i
's	i
written	c
that	i
it	i
will	i
be	i
played	i
by	i
Danny	i
Brook	i
,	c
but	c
in	c
fact	c
it	i
was	c
n't	c
.	c

Again	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
true	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
enquired	c
about	c
the	c
discounts	c
,	c
at	i
the	c
cashier	c
they	i
told	c
me	c
that	c
they	c
did	c
n't	c
have	c
any	c
information	c
about	c
it	i
.	c

At	i
least	i
,	c
after	c
all	c
my	c
disappointments	c
when	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
visit	c
your	c
restaurant	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
too	c
late	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

Pat	c
is	c
my	c
best	c
friend	c
.	c

friends	c
to	i
close	i
their	i
mouths	i
.	c

All	i
did	c
except	c
one	c
:	c
Pat	c
.	c

Last	c
year	c
,	c
Pat	c
and	c
I	c
were	c
driving	c
back	c
home	c
and	c
unfortunately	c
driving	i
too	c
fast	c
I	i
drove	c
through	c
the	c
front	c
gate	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
wondering	c
how	c
to	c
tell	c
my	c
parents	c
and	c
I	c
asked	c
Pat	c
if	c
she	c
could	c
keep	c
it	c
secret	c
till	c
I	c
found	c
the	c
way	c
to	c
tell	c
them	c
.	c

Of	c
course	c
,	c
the	c
following	c
day	c
all	c
my	c
family	c
had	c
heard	c
about	i
my	c
odd	c
story	c
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
to	c
this	c
,	c
why	c
do	c
I	c
still	c
go	i
on	c
with	c
her	c
,	i
it	i
's	i
the	c
fact	c
I	c
love	c
her	c
as	c
well	i
as	c
my	c
sister	c
and	c
I	c
know	c
that	c
she	c
can	c
change	c
it	i
if	c
she	c
would	i
because	c
last	i
week	c
,	c
she	c
organized	c
a	c
huge	c
party	c
for	c
me	c
,	c
without	c
telling	c
me	c
.	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
impressed	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
your	c
competition	c
.	c

As	c
the	c
letter	c
said	c
that	c
all	i
questions	i
you	i
would	i
like	i
to	i
know	i
,	i
I	i
'm	i
going	i
to	i
give	i
you	i
in	i
the	c
following	c
:	c

Thirdly	c
for	i
the	c
activities	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
chose	i
climbing	c
and	c
photography	c
,	i
I	c
have	c
never	c
done	c
them	c
before	c
.	c

The	c
only	c
reason	c
is	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
try	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
they	c
are	c
matching	c
activities	c
,	i
when	i
you	c
climb	c
up	i
the	c
mountain	c
then	i
you	c
can	c
take	c
the	i
photograph	i
of	c
the	c
views	c
.	c

How	i
much	i
do	i
I	i
have	i
to	i
bring	i
the	i
money	i
?	c

And	c
what	c
is	c
the	c
weather	c
like	c
?	c
which	i
I	i
could	i
bring	i
them	i
to	i
be	i
match	i
the	c
weather	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c

Shopping	c
is	c
when	c
human	i
goes	i
to	c
the	c
shop	i
and	c
buy	c
what	c
they	c
went	i
,	i
however	i
I	i
think	c
this	c
word	c
is	c
for	c
women	c
because	c
they	c
like	c
beautiful	c
clothes	c
all	i
sort	i
of	c
things	c
.	c

Anyway	c
shopping	i
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
as	c
the	c
title	c
because	i
firstly	c
you	c
will	c
get	c
tied	i
because	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
walk	c
out	i
and	i
in	i
the	c
shops	c
.	c

Secondly	c
you	c
will	c
get	c
angry	c
on	i
bad	i
treatment	i
of	c
the	c
sellers	i
in	c
the	c
shop	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
if	c
you	c
have	c
lots	c
of	c
money	c
and	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
what	c
to	c
do	c
with	c
it	c
,	c
do	c
not	c
go	c
shopping	c
give	c
the	c
money	c
to	c
charity	c
,	i
that	i
is	c
better	c
than	c
shopping	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
your	c
musical	c
show	c
which	c
performed	i
last	c
Friday	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
interested	c
in	c
your	c
advertisement	c
and	c
I	c
booked	c
the	c
friday	i
show	c
while	c
I	c
had	i
been	i
on	c
holiday	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
saw	c
that	c
the	c
discounts	c
were	c
available	c
,	c
but	c
there	c
were	c
not	c
any	c
discounts	c
and	c
advantages	i
for	c
the	c
audience	c
.	c

I	c
like	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
's	c
acting	c
but	c
he	i
actors	c
were	c
changed	c
without	c
mentioning	c
,	c
also	c
the	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
by	i
the	c
excuse	c
to	i
be	i
repaired	c
.	c

In	c
fact	c
,	c
the	c
notice	c
had	c
been	c
showed	i
since	c
last	c
winter	c
.	c

It	c
means	c
that	c
the	c
theatre	c
have	c
not	c
made	c
any	c
efforts	c
for	c
the	c
people	c
.	c

Therefore	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	i
refund	c
some	c
money	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
recieving	c
your	c
prompt	c
reply	c

One	c
of	c
them	c
is	c
fashion	i
area	i
.	c

however	i
,	c
in	i
the	i
other	i
hand	i
,	c
there	c
is	c
a	c
different	c
idea	c
.	c

so	i
on	c
.	c

They	c
prefer	c
new	c
original	c
style	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
show	i
them	i
more	c
attractive	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
most	c
designers	c
prefer	c
to	c
use	c
natural	c
material	c
.	c

They	c
have	c
used	c
animal	c
and	c
fish	c
skins	c
,	c
some	c
plants	c
and	c
herbal	c
things	c
than	i
chemical	c
one	i
.	c

Also	c
countless	c
fashion	i
will	c
be	c
shown	i
.	c

People	c
will	c
prefer	c
to	c
use	c
more	c
natural	c
than	c
chemical	c
things	c
and	c
wear	c
more	c
beautiful	c
and	c
attractive	c
clothes	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
showing	c
their	c
beauty	c
is	c
one	c
of	c
animal	i
's	i
basic	c
instincts	c
.	c

I	c
ca	i
n't	i
stand	c
wearing	c
a	c
suit	c
or	c
kit	c
like	c
which	i
has	c
been	c
showed	i
in	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
a	c
number	c
of	c
points	i
.	c

I	c
went	c
to	c
London	c
on	c
holiday	c
and	c
to	c
The	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
to	c
see	c
Over	c
The	c
Rainbow	c
.	c

Although	i
,	c
this	c
musical	c
show	i
was	c
not	c
as	c
good	c
as	c
I	c
expected	c
.	c

To	c
make	c
matters	c
worse	c
,	c
instead	c
of	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
performing	c
you	c
had	c
another	c
actor	c
,	c
which	c
was	c
very	c
disappointing	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
it	c
says	c
in	c
your	c
advertisement	c
that	c
discounts	c
would	c
be	c
available	c
,	c
despite	c
the	c
fact	c
they	c
were	c
not	c
.	c

On	c
top	c
of	c
everything	c
,	c
you	c
recommended	c
to	i
visit	i
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

According	i
to	i
my	c
experience	c
it	i
was	c
not	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
expecting	c
a	c
full	c
refund	c
and	c
compensation	c
for	c
the	c
discomfort	c
I	c
have	c
suffered	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
foward	i
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c

Due	c
to	c
this	c
the	c
quality	c
of	c
clothes	c
is	c
getting	c
better	c
and	c
in	c
100	c
years	c
we	c
will	c
be	c
asking	c
for	c
a	c
bigger	i
variety	c
of	c
clothes	c

We	c
give	c
other	c
things	c
priority	c
so	c
we	c
are	c
able	c
to	c
afford	c
our	c
clothes	c

On	c
the	c
whole	c
,	c
people	c
nowadays	c
,	i
do	c
care	c
more	c
about	c
their	c
appearance	c
and	c
will	c
be	i
continuing	i
to	c
do	c

It	c
appears	c
that	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
the	c
prize	c
two	i
weeks	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
in	c
the	c
USA	c
.	c

On	i
the	c
following	c
there	c
is	c
some	c
further	c
information	c
from	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
only	c
in	c
July	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
so	c
many	c
assignments	c
to	c
finish	c
before	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
June	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
not	c
think	c
I	c
have	c
enough	c
time	c
to	c
prepare	c
somethings	i
to	c
travel	c
before	c
of	i
July	c
.	c

I	c
used	c
to	c
be	c
a	c
tennis	c
player	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
fifteen	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
a	c
swimming	c
teacher	c
for	c
a	c
year	c
in	c
a	c
sports	c
club	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
both	c
activities	c
I	c
have	c
chosen	c
are	c
suitable	c
for	c
me	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
sure	c
I	c
can	c
do	c
well	c
.	c

What	c
type	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	i
should	i
bring	c
with	c
me	c
?	c
and	i
is	c
there	c
any	c
equipment	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
bring	c
with	c
me	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c

How	c
are	c
you	c
?	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
have	i
a	c
nice	c
summer	i
time	i
now	c
.	c

Anyway	c
,	c
it	c
is	i
does	c
n't	c
matter	c
now	c
who	c
had	i
told	i
you	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
happy	c
and	c
enjoyed	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
frightening	i
I	c
might	c
put	c
too	c
much	c
make	i
up	i
on	c
their	c
faces	c
,	c
but	c
everything	c
was	c
allright	i
.	c

After	c
that	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
help	c
them	c
to	c
prepare	c
some	c
lunch	c
when	c
the	c
concert	c
had	i
started	i
.	c

I	c
was	c
running	c
around	c
to	c
find	c
something	c
I	c
could	c
do	c
,	c
like	c
serving	c
some	c
drinks	c
for	c
staffs	i
or	c
the	c
singers	c
.	c

After	c
the	c
concert	c
finished	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
help	c
them	c
cleaned	i
up	c
everything	c
.	c

I	c
really	c
like	c
to	c
help	c
people	c
without	c
something	i
back	c
.	c

This	i
experience	i
I	i
was	i
so	i
prond	i
and	c
very	c
enjoyed	i
.	c

I	c
spent	c
my	c
free	c
time	c
to	i
helping	c
them	c
its	i
made	i
my	c
life	c
a	c
little	c
bit	c
busy	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
I	c
have	c
learnt	c
a	c
lot	c
from	c
this	c
experience	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
are	i
enjoying	i
with	i

13.06.2000	c

I	c
love	i
to	c
come	c
the	i
camp	c
California	i
.	c

I	c
always	c
want	i
to	c
go	c
and	c
se	i
USA	i
!	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
answer	c
your	c
questions	c
about	c
this	c
trip	c
.	c

Before	i
everything	i
,	c
I	c
'm	c
living	c
in	c
Leeds	c
and	c
also	c
studying	c
English	c
in	i
a	c
college	c
.	c

Before	c
this	i
time	i
,	c
I	c
usually	i
stay	i
in	c
log	c
cabins	c
,	c
But	i
I	c
never	i
had	i
chance	i
for	i
staying	i
in	c
a	c
tent	c
.	c

On	i
the	i
other	i
hand	i
,	c
I	c
've	c
just	c
learnt	c
from	c
your	c
letter	c
that	c
I	c
can	c
have	i
some	c
sport	i
activities	c
during	c
the	c
camp	c
.	c

Because	c
,	i
I	c
spent	c
most	c
of	c
my	c
scholl	i
life	c
for	i
sports	c
,	c
specially	i
for	i
basketball	c
.	c

Now	c
,	c
you	c
gave	i
a	i
opportunity	c
.	c

As	c
a	i
my	c
second	c
activities	i
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
choose	c
photography	c
,	c
because	c
my	c
education	c
was	i
including	i
photography	c
,	i
I	c
love	c
to	i
take	i
some	i
photographs	c
about	i
nature	c

When	c
I	i
'm	i
coming	i
,	c
what	c
king	i
of	c
clothes	c
could	i

I	c

They	c
mixed	c
up	c

Lots	c

Then	c

I	i
've	i

3	c
years	c
as	i
I	c
was	c

school	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
my	c
level	i
is	c
still	c
not	c
too	c
bad	c
.	c

In	i
contrary	i
,	c
I	c
've	c
never	c
sailed	c
in	c
my	c
life	c
and	c
would	c
enjoy	c

would	c

to	c

How	c

As	c
you	c

I	c
was	c

the	c

concert	c
I	i
've	i

I	i
've	i

they	c
all	c

a	c
member	c
of	c
different	i
swimming	c
clubs	c
since	c
I	c
was	c

King	c
Regards	c

Dear	c
Miss/Mrs	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
just	c
received	c
the	c
excellent	c
news	c
about	c
the	c
prize	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
all	c
the	c
details	c
you	c
need	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
only	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
,	c
as	c
it	c
is	c
then	c
when	i
I	c
get	i
my	i
holiday	c
from	c
my	c
present	c
job	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
rather	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
,	c
because	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
child	c
I	c
used	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
a	c
campsite	c
and	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
with	c
my	c
family	c
for	c
two	c
weeks	c
every	c
summer	c
and	c
I	c
thoroughly	c
enjoyed	c
it	c
.	c

About	c
the	c
activities	c
I	c
can	c
choose	c
from	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
be	c
delighted	c
if	c
I	c
could	c
sing	c
,	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
something	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
always	c
loved	c
and	c
,	c
although	c
perhaps	c
I	c
should	c
not	c
say	c
that	i
myself	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
I	c
have	c
a	c
nice	c
voice	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
also	c
very	c
fond	c
of	c
photography	c
,	c
so	c
when	c
I	c
have	i
seen	i
that	c
it	c
is	c
among	c
your	c
options	c
it	c
has	i
been	i
a	c
wonderful	c
surprise	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
which	i
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
are	c
more	c
suitable	c
for	c
that	c
time	c
of	c
the	c
year	c
at	c
the	c
camp	c
,	c
the	c
amount	c
of	c
money	c
that	c
more	i
or	c
less	c
I	i
would	c
need	c
to	c
bring	c
with	c
me	c
and	c
if	c
there	c
is	c
any	c
cooking	c
equipment	c
to	c
cook	c
the	c
meals	c
ourselves	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

I	c
friend	c
of	c
mine	c
had	c
been	c
helping	c
at	c
a	c
few	c
concerts	c
before	c
,	c
so	c
that	c
time	c
the	c
agency	c
rang	c
him	c
and	c
asked	c
him	c
if	c
he	c
could	c
bring	c
someone	c
else	c
,	c
because	c
they	c
'd	c
run	c
out	c
of	c
stuff	i
.	c

I	c
could	c
n't	c
wait	c
for	c
it	c
.	c

But	c
the	c
most	c
amazing	c
thing	c
happened	c
later	c
,	c
when	c
ten	i
minutes	c
before	c
the	c
concert	c
began	c
,	c
my	c
friend	c
told	c
me	c
we	c
could	c
see	c
it	c
from	c
the	i
backside	i
of	i
the	i
stage	i
.	c

For	c
a	c
while	c
I	c
thought	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
dream	c
.	c

The	c
playing	i
was	c
excellent	c
,	c
the	c
public	i
enjoyed	c
it	c
very	c
much	c
but	c
,	c
above	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
there	c
,	c
at	i
ten	c
metres	c
from	c
my	c
favourite	c
group	c
.	c

I	c
'll	c
show	c
you	c
the	c
photographs	c
I	c
took	c
next	c
time	c
you	c
come	c
to	c
visit	c
me	c
,	c
O.K	i
?	c

Love	c
,	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
:	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
let	c
you	c
know	c
the	i
disappointed	i
evening	c
I	c
had	c
seen	i
your	c
show	c
with	c
the	c
worst	c
services	c
I	c
have	c
ever	c
seen	i
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
in	i
the	c
ticket	c
for	i
entrance	i
says	i
that	c
the	c
actor	c
was	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
realy	i
he	c
was	c
not	c
.	c

The	c
last	c
thing	c
is	c
that	c
you	c
invited	c
us	c
to	c
visit	c
your	c
restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
the	c
food	c
was	c
not	c
already	i
done	c
.	c

I	c
thought	c
you	c
were	c
a	c
good	c
theatre	c
,	c
were	i
people	c
can	c
go	c
and	c
have	c
a	c
good	c
evening	c
alone	c
or	c
with	c
somebody	c
else	c
,	c
but	c
realy	i
I	c
am	c
very	c
disappointed	c
and	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
ask	c
for	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

Please	c
,	c
let	c
me	c
know	c
your	c
answer	c
.	c

Seen	i
my	c
hole	i
life	c
I	c
can	c
say	c
the	i
moden	i
technology	c
has	c
changed	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
in	c
many	c
ways	c
.	c

We	c
work	i
all	i
separated	i
,	c
making	i
grow	i
the	i
individuality	i
and	c
forgoten	i
we	c
has	i
to	c
talk	i
all	i
together	c
to	c
know	c
about	c
the	i
other	c
's	c
life	c
.	c

The	c
second	c
way	i
is	c
that	c
it	c
has	c
make	i
easy	i
my	i
life	i
.	c

The	i
comunications	i
in	i
the	c
world	c
are	i
faster	c
than	c
ever	c
,	c
so	c
when	c
I	c
need	c
something	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
have	c
it	c
in	c
only	c
a	c
minute	c
.	c

It	c
has	c
descover	i
many	c
instruments	c
that	c
help	c
me	c
to	c
have	i
a	i
good	i
health	c
.	c

Dear	c
Helen	c

I	c
feel	c
really	c
enthusiastic	c
about	c
spending	c
a	c
couple	c
of	c
weeks	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
as	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
on	c
traineeship	i
in	c
August	c
,	c
I	c
hope	c
this	c
could	i
occur	c
in	c
July	c
.	c

Besides	i
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
staying	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
quite	c
difficult	c
to	c
say	c
wether	i
I	c
prefer	c
painting	c
or	c
sailing	c
.	c

Eventually	i
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
where	c
the	c
camp	c
is	c
located	c
.	c

Yours	c
Sincerely	i

Ignace	c
Cloutier	c

Daily	c
life	c
at	c
school	c
:	c

Therefore	c
it	c
must	c
be	c
objective	c
.	c

Then	c
it	c
may	c
improve	c
our	c
day	i
life	c
at	c
school	c
.	c

As	c
it	c
is	c
very	c
boring	c
,	c
everybody	c
would	c
understand	c
how	c
difficult	c
it	c
is	c
to	c
get	c
good	c
marks	c
at	i
the	c
final	c
examination	c
.	c

Then	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
film	c
the	c
computer	c
rooms	c
.	c

If	c
only	c
we	c
could	c
get	c
some	c
new	c
ones	c
.	c

Moreover	c
it	c
will	c
show	i
of	i
healthy	i
the	c
students	c
are	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
your	c
musical	i
show	c
.	c

We	c
thought	c
that	c
we	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
let	c
you	c
know	c
all	c
details	i
which	i
it	i
did	i
n't	i
make	i
us	i
happy	i
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
we	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
theather	i
to	c
pick	c
up	c
our	c
tickets	c
.	c

We	c
waited	c
for	c
45	c
minutes	c
.	c

I	c
realised	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
different	i
actor	c
playing	c
instead	c
of	c
Danny	c
brook	i
.	c

However	i
we	c
wanted	c
to	c
eat	c
something	c
at	c
the	c
Theatre	c
Restaurant	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
again	i
same	i
with	i
the	i
others	i
,	c
because	c
the	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
we	c
had	c
a	c
totally	c
unhappy	i
night	c
with	i
your	c
show	c
.	c

You	c
ca	c
n't	c
take	c
this	c
bad	c
feeling	c
back	i
but	c
you	c
might	c
give	c
us	c
our	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

We	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c

Technology	c
has	c
changed	c
our	c
life	c
forever	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
we	c
can	c
cook	c
our	c
meals	c
an	i
electrical	c
stove	c
or	c
in	c
a	c
microwave	c
and	c
it	c
takes	c
just	c
a	c
few	c
minutes	c
to	c
get	c
ready	c
.	c

We	c
do	c
not	c
need	c
to	c
lit	i
fire	i
in	c
order	c
to	c
cook	c
as	c
in	c
the	c
old	c
days	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
future	c
,	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
help	c
people	c
even	c
more	c
since	c
it	c
has	c
been	c
increasing	i
its	i

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
the	c
letter	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
great	c
to	c
hear	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
surprised	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
.	c

By	c
the	c
way	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
,	c
because	c
just	i
I	i
have	c
free	c
time	c
in	c
July	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
tents	c
.	c

According	c
to	c
your	c
letter	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
10	c
main	c
activities	c
which	c
I	c
can	c
choose	c
2	c
and	c
play	c
while	c
I	c
am	c
on	c
the	c
holiday	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
some	c
question	i
such	c
as	c
clothes	i
and	c
money	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
this	i
is	c
first	i
time	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
to	i
abroad	c
therefore	i
I	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
should	c
bring	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c

yours	c
sincerely	c

How	c
have	c
you	c
been	c
doing	c
recently	c
.	i

I	c
want	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
how	c
much	c
I	c
enjoyed	c
helping	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
begining	i
of	c
this	c
summer	c
.	c

Although	c
at	c
first	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
wand	i
to	c
do	c
it	c
,	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
in	c
summer	c
.	c

Howeve	i
it	i
was	c
great	i
job	c
I	i
have	c
n't	c
hade	c
such	c
experience	i
.	i

I	c
must	c
sign	c
off	c
as	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
catch	c
the	c
post	c
.	c

A	c
big	c
hug	c
from	c
me	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c

Instead	c
,	c
there	c
was	c
this	c
unknown	c
actor	c
with	i
a	c
very	c
bad	c
performance	c
and	c
a	i
terribly	c
annoying	c
voice	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
the	c
play	c
did	c
not	c
start	c
at	c
the	c
time	c
it	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
.	c

All	c
the	c
waiting	c
made	c
me	c
quite	c
hungry	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
was	c
expecting	c
to	c
have	c
good	c
meal	c
at	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
and	c
having	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

The	c
New	c
Modern	c
Life	c

Of	c
all	c
the	c
recent	c
technological	c
advances	c
,	c
the	c
one	c
that	c
had	i
the	c
great	i
impact	c
on	c
my	c
life	c
was	i
the	c
Internet	c
.	c

It	c
provides	c
you	c
all	i
the	c
information	c
you	c
want	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
watch	c
the	c
news	c
on	c
television	c
anymore	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
can	c
use	c
my	c
computer	c
to	c
read	c
only	c
the	c
things	c
that	c
interest	c
me	c
.	c

Mobile	c
phones	c
are	c
another	c
thing	c
that	c
is	i
making	c
my	c
life	c
much	c
easier	c
.	c

They	c
allow	c
you	c
to	c
talk	c
to	c
other	c
people	c
no	c
matter	c
where	c
you	c
are	c
.	c

This	c
can	c
be	c
very	c
useful	c
when	c
you	c
have	c
a	c
problem	c
that	c
needs	c
an	c
immediate	c
solution	c
.	c

For	c
the	c
next	c
years	i
,	c
we	c
can	c
expect	c
many	c
more	c
technologies	i
that	c
will	c
continue	c
making	c
our	c
lives	c
easier	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
very	c
happy	c
for	i
winning	i
the	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
the	c
competition	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
would	i
be	c
a	c
very	c
good	c
experience	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
realy	i
excited	c
about	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
'd	c
love	c
to	c
come	c
earlier	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
realy	i
ca	c
n't	c
because	c
this	c
job	c
is	c
very	c
important	c
for	i
me	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
'll	c
need	c
it	c
as	c
a	i
work	c
experience	c
,	i
for	c
my	c
further	c
studies	c
in	i
the	i
University	c
.	c

I	c
will	i
also	c
appreciate	c
,	i
if	c
you	c
would	c
offer	c
me	c
accomodation	i
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
,	c
because	c
of	c
some	c
health	c
problems	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
,	c
which	c
are	i
not	c
allow	c
me	c
to	c
leave	i
outsid	i
on	c
the	c
ground	c
,	c
and	c
to	c
be	c
honest	c
with	c
you	c
,	c
I	c
never	c
liked	c
camping	c
.	c

I	c
'd	c
also	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
'll	c
need	c
for	c
these	c
two	c
weeks	c
,	c
and	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
should	i
I	i
take	c
with	c
me	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
've	c
never	c
been	c
to	c
the	c
States	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
how	i
the	c
weather	c
is	c
in	i
California	c
during	c
the	c
summer	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
hearing	i
from	c
you	c
.	c

We	c
all	c
like	c
going	c
out	c
to	c
the	c
shops	c
,	c
and	c
spend	i
hours	c
,	i
looking	c
all	i
sorts	c
of	c
products	c
and	c
comparing	c
the	c
prices	c
,	c
until	c
we	c
decide	c
which	c
one	c
is	c
the	c
most	c
suitable	c
for	c
us	c
.	c

But	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

That	c
is	c
my	c
worst	c
nightmare	c
.	c

They	c
also	c
like	c
going	c
to	c
loads	c
of	c
shops	c
,	c
in	c
different	c
parts	c
of	c
the	c
city	c
.	c

At	c
the	c
end	c
I	c
feel	c
very	c
tired	c
and	c
angry	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
spent	i
the	c
whole	c
morning	c
doing	c
nothing	c
,	c
except	c
from	i
looking	c
at	c
them	c
trying	c
diferent	i
clothes	c
,	c
and	c
that	c
's	c
not	c
enjoyable	c
at	c
all	c
,	c
in	c
fact	c
it	c
's	c
realy	i
annoying	c
.	c

Children	c
always	c
ask	c
for	c
something	c
and	c
they	c
want	c
to	c
have	c
all	c
they	i
toys	c
which	c
they	c
see	c
and	c
that	c
's	c
not	c
very	c
enjoyable	c
for	c
the	c
parents	c
,	c
because	c
sometimes	c
they	c
spend	c
more	c
money	c
,	i
from	i
the	i
amount	i
of	i
money	i
that	i
they	c
have	i
planned	i
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
informing	c
me	c
I	i
've	c
won	c
the	c
prize	c
.	c

To	c
let	c
you	c
arrange	c
the	c
details	c
of	c
your	c
programe	i
,	c
I	c
'm	c
going	c
to	c
give	i
my	i
answers	i
to	i
you	i
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
I	c
've	c
already	c
resistered	i
another	i
summer	c
course	c
which	c
starts	c
in	i
the	c
end	c
of	c
July	c
.	c

Sorry	c
about	c
that	c
but	c
I	c
can	c
make	c
that	c
travel	i
only	c
in	c
July	c
.	c

Because	i
I	c
have	c
n't	c
used	c
tents	c
for	c
ages	c
so	c
this	c
time	c
,	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
have	c
tents	c
for	c
2	c
weeks	c
which	c
will	c
remind	c
me	c
of	c
my	c
childhood	c
with	c
my	c
family	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
very	c
keen	c
on	c
photography	c
,	c
especially	c
while	c
I	c
'm	c
staying	c
in	c
Sates	i
.	c

I	c
might	c
have	c
lots	c
of	c
chances	c
to	c
take	c
photos	c
of	c
beautiful	c
nature	i
.	c

So	c
I	c
'm	c
longing	c
to	c
take	c
part	c
in	c
that	c
activity	c
,	c
photography	c
.	c

Actually	c
I	c
've	c
been	c
in	c
amature	i
photographer	c
's	c
organization	c
for	c
3	c
years	c
.	c

And	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
choose	c
swimming	c
as	c
the	c
other	c
one	c
.	c

I	c
learned	c
swimming	c
at	c
my	i
age	c
of	c
8	c
for	c
5	c
years	c
and	c
I	c
still	c
love	c
swimming	c
.	c

At	c
that	c
time	c
,	c
I	c
took	c
the	c
course	c
which	c
covered	c
all	c
the	c
4	c
kinds	c
of	c
strocks	i
.	c

Then	c
I	c
can	c
prepare	i
my	i
clothes	i
suitable	i
for	c
that	c
weather	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

The	c
lessons	c
we	c
have	c
in	c
the	c
morning	c
does	c
n't	c
attract	c
us	c
very	c
much	c
,	c
but	c
this	c
bit	c
will	c
show	c
you	c
routine	i
scenery	i
of	c
a	c
lesson	c
.	c

Spoken	c
English	c
lessons	c
which	c
is	i
in	c
the	c
afternoon	c
are	c
quite	c
interesting	c
.	c

Every	i
students	i
keep	c
talking	c
about	c
he	i
theme	c
and	c
give	i
their	c
opinions	c
.	c

Because	c
we	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
pub	c
which	c
is	c
situated	c
near	c
to	c
the	c
school	c
quite	c
often	c
and	c
we	c
talk	c
more	c
about	c
personal	c
stories	c
that	c
make	c
us	c
closer	c
,	i
the	i
pub	c
after	c
the	c
lessons	c
will	c
be	c
interesting	c
.	c

Your	c
preperation	c
for	c
lessons	c
,	c
everyday	c
chats	c
and	c
so	c
on	c
.	c

When	c
things	c
become	c
more	c
obvious	c
and	c
more	c
things	c
are	c
decided	c
,	c
I	c
'll	c
report	c
again	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
I	c
can	c
only	c
see	c
my	c
family	c
during	c
the	c
month	c
of	c
August	c
.	c

Concerning	c
the	c
accomodation	i
,	c
I	c
prefer	c
to	c
live	i
in	c
log	c
cabins	c
finding	i
them	c
much	c
more	c
comfortable	c
than	c
tents	c
!	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
choose	c
singing	c
and	c
basketball	c
because	c
my	c
friends	c
say	c
I	c
'm	c
good	c
at	c
both	c
.	c

Singing	c
has	c
always	c
been	c
a	c
hobby	c
and	c
takes	i
an	c
important	c
part	c
in	c
my	c
life	c
.	c

Singing	c
relaxes	c
me	c
when	c
I	c
am	c
stressed	c
before	c
exams	c
or	c
competitions	c
.	c

Basketball	c
is	c
simply	c
my	c
favourite	c
sport	c
.	c

to	i
finish	c
off	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
is	c
needed	c
for	c
my	c
personal	c
shopping	c
and	i
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
should	c
take	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
I	c
have	c
n't	c
been	c
too	c
"	c
demanding	c
"	c
.	c

Marthe	c
Ouellet	c

to	i
do	c
that	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
more	c
interesting	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
art	c
,	c
music	c
and	c
drama	c
classes	c
.	c

Effectively	i
,	c
in	c
these	c
classes	c
,	c
students	c
express	c
themselves	c
more	c
than	c
in	c
other	c
classes	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
important	c
to	c
observe	c
students	i
attention	i
and	c
therefore	c
we	c
should	c
film	c
them	c
during	c
an	c
exam	c
(	c
but	c
only	c
for	c
a	c
short	c
period	c
of	c
time	c
)	c

A	c
school	c
teaches	c
you	c
how	c
to	c
be	c
polite	c
and	c
respectful	c
.	c

The	c
cafeteria	c
is	c
an	c
interesting	c
place	c
to	c
go	c
because	c
one	c
can	c
see	c
if	c
students	c
respect	c
food	c
and	c
if	c
they	c
remain	c
polite	c
towards	c
each	c
other	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
important	c
to	c
remember	c
that	c
short	i
shots	i
should	c
be	c
taken	c
for	i
each	c
subject	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
James	c
,	c

My	c
name	c
is	c
Paula	c
and	c
I	c
'm	c
one	c
of	c
your	c
latest	i
visitors	c
of	i
your	c
show	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
''	c
,	c
this	c
is	c
also	c
the	c
reason	c
of	i
my	c
letter	c
.	c

Last	c
week	c
during	c
my	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
,	c
I	c
found	c
your	c
advertisment	i
in	c
my	c
newspaper	c
.	c

But	c
,	c
suddenly	c
the	c
whole	c
evening	c
changed	c
into	c
something	c
,	i
we	c
did	c
n't	c
expected	i
at	c
all	c
.	c

The	c
first	c
disappointment	c
confronted	c
us	c
on	i
the	c
main	c
entrance	c
,	i
there	c
was	c
no	c
discount	c
for	c
our	c
ticket	i
available	c
.	c

Actually	c
,	c
this	c
guy	c
was	c
not	c
half	c
as	c
good	c
as	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
.	c

The	c
other	c
thing	c
was	c
the	c
time	c
,	i
the	i
show	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
start	c
at	c
half	c
past	c
seven	c
,	c
but	c
we	c
have	i
been	i
waiting	i
for	c
45	c
minutes	c
,	c
before	c
the	c
light	c
turned	c
off	c
.	c

Till	c
then	c
we	c
have	i
been	c
very	c
upset	c
about	c
the	c
evening	c
and	c
decided	c
to	c
go	c
for	c
dinner	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

Her	c
name	c
is	c
Carla	c
and	c
she	c
just	c
changed	c
school	c
,	i
she	i
is	c
so	c
beautiful	c
,	c
with	c
long	c
legs	c
,	c
blond	c
hair	c
and	c
a	c
voice	c
which	c
makes	c
me	c
melt	c
.	c

I	i
've	i
never	c
been	c
so	c
fascinated	c
by	c
a	c
girl	c
and	c
so	c
I	c
knew	c
it	c
must	c
have	c
been	c
real	c
love	c
.	c

Luckely	i
I	c
could	c
keep	c
my	c
secret	c
for	c
a	c
couple	c
of	c
days	c
but	c
then	c
,	i
it	c
became	c
urgent	c
and	c
I	c
needed	c
someone	c
to	c
talk	c
to	c

Pat	c
,	c
he	c
was	c
my	c
friend	c
,	c
and	c
he	c
knew	c
girls	c

I	c
thought	c
he	c
would	c
keep	c
everything	c
like	i
a	i
thing	i
between	c
him	c
and	c
me	c
,	c
but	c
he	c
disappointed	c
me	c
.	c

He	c
actually	c
went	c
to	c
Carla	c
and	c
told	c
her	c
every	i
thing	i
.	c

No	c
doubt	c
she	c
would	c
never	c
ever	c
look	c
at	c
me	c
again	c

But	c
she	c
did	c
,	c
she	c
asked	c
me	c
out	c

There	c
are	c

Dear	c
Mrs.	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
:	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
on	i
July	c
,	c
please	c
,	c
because	c
that	c
when	i
I	c
am	c
in	i
vacation	c
.	c

That	c
is	c
really	c
the	c
only	c
time	c
I	c
have	c
,	c
unfortunately	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
love	c
it	c
if	c
I	c
could	c
be	i
accommodated	i
in	c
a	c
tent	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
learning	c
how	c
to	c
take	c
care	c
of	c
myself	c
in	c
dangerous	c
situations	c
,	c
such	c
as	c
getting	c
lost	c
in	c
a	c
forest	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
being	i
in	c
a	c
tent	c
will	c
be	c
very	c
usefull	i
for	c
that	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
how	c
cold	c
it	c
is	c
up	c
there	c
,	c
for	i
me	i
to	i
know	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
should	c
bring	c

The	c
most	c
amazing	c
thing	c

I	c

really	c
good	c
person	c

The	c
show	c
after	i
was	c
great	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
n't	c
believe	c
that	c
I	c
had	c
met	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
share	c
with	c
you	c
some	c
feelings	c
I	c
have	c
after	c
watching	c
a	c
musical	c
show	c
,	i
which	c
was	c
played	i
at	c
The	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
last	c
week	c
.	c

Unfortunalety	i
my	c
feelings	c
are	c
rather	c
bad	c
.	c

Especialy	i
due	c
to	c
the	c
fact	c
that	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
see	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
-	c
my	c
favourite	c
actor	c
.	c

The	c
'	c
theatre	c
'	c
even	i
did	i
not	i
appologize	i
for	c
this	c
range	i
.	c

To	c
make	c
things	c
worse	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
45	c
minutes	c
later	c
than	c
it	c
should	c
have	c
been	i
(	c
started	i
at	c
20:15	c
instead	c
of	c
19:30	c
)	c
.	c

I	c
tried	c
to	c
relax	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
made	c
my	c
way	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
,	c
which	c
according	i
to	c
the	c
advertisement	c
ought	i
to	c
be	i
open	c
at	c
that	c
time	c
.	c

The	c
advertisement	c
say	i
'	c
your	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
'	c
,	i
however	i
it	i
was	c
the	c
worst	c
evening	c
I	c
have	c
had	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

I	c
told	c
her	c
about	c
my	c
plans	c
on	c
Monday	c
,	i
however	i
on	i
Friday	c
almost	c
half	c
of	c
my	c
class	c
knew	c
what	i
's	i
going	c
on	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
the	c
only	c
boy	c
in	c
my	c
class	c
who	c
did	c
n't	c
have	c
a	c
driving	c
licence	c
.	c

I	c
wanted	c
to	c
tell	c
them	c
about	c
this	c
after	c
I	c
would	i
pass	i
the	c
exam	c
.	c

Saturday	c
morning	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
driving	c
center	i
for	c
my	c
first	c
lesson	c
.	c

I	c
felt	c
terrible	c
.	c

The	c
instractur	i
opened	c
the	c
car	c
and	i
asked	c
me	c
to	c
sit	c
on	i
the	c
drivers	i
sit	i
.	c

Then	c
I	c
drove	c
very	c
slowly	c
very	c
ofen	i
crossing	c
the	c
white	c
line	c
on	c
the	c
road	c
.	c

I	c
started	c
doing	c
stupid	c
things	c
:	c
turn	i
right	c
instead	c
of	c
left	c
and	c
so	c
on	c
.	c

Eventually	i
the	i
things	c
were	c
n't	c
so	c
bad	c
.	c

I	c
went	c
to	c
school	c
and	c
everyone	c
was	c
very	c
friendly	c
.	c

Pat	c
appologized	i
me	i
for	c
not	c
keeping	c
the	i
secrets	c
.	c

At	c
the	c
begining	i
I	c
was	c
very	c
angry	c
but	c
in	c
the	c
end	c
I	c
said	c
that	c
everything	c
is	i
O.K	c
.	c

Dear	c
Jane	c
Clark	c
,	c

I	c
spent	c
two	c
days	c
at	c
the	c
International	c
Arts	c
Festival	c
you	c
have	i
organized	i
.	c

I	c
enjoyed	c
it	c
very	c
much	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
you	c
have	i
had	i
a	c
great	c
idea	c
.	c

I	c
went	c
to	c
all	c
the	c
events	c
,	c
they	c
were	c
really	c
good	c
.	c

Why	c
do	c
n't	c
you	c
let	c
more	c
countries	c
to	i
participate	i
next	c
year	c
?	c

I	c
also	c
liked	c
the	c
concerts	c
.	c

But	c
,	c
can	c
I	c
give	c
you	c
a	c
suggestion	c
for	c
next	c
year	c
?	c

Try	c
to	c
find	c
bigger	c
halls	c
,	c
because	c
this	c
year	c
they	c
were	c
really	c
too	c
small	c
!	c

In	c
fact	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
really	c
a	c
reasonably-priced	c
ticket	c
,	c
excellent	c
because	c
you	c
could	c
go	c
to	c
all	c
the	c
events	c
only	i
with	c
it	i
.	c

And	c
that	c
's	c
the	c
reason	c
because	i
lots	c
of	c
people	c
came	c
.	c

I	c
received	c
your	c
letter	c
yesterday	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
answer	c
you	c
soon	i
!	c

In	c
my	c
country	c
there	c
are	c
different	c
rules	c
at	c
school	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
think	c
they	c
are	c
,	c
more	c
or	c
less	c
,	c
the	c
same	c
in	c
England	c
.	c

You	c
have	c
to	c
begin	c
your	c
lesson	c
at	c
8.25	c
and	c
wait	c
for	c
the	c
teacher	c
of	c
the	c
next	c
lesson	c
in	c
the	c
class	c
.	c

You	c
have	c
a	c
break	c
of	c
ten	c
minutes	c
,	c
that	i
you	i
would	i
have	i
to	i
do	i
in	i
class	i
.	c

You	c
ca	c
n't	c
speak	c
during	c
the	c
lesson	c
or	c
outside	c
the	c
classrooms	c
.	c

You	c
ca	c
n't	c
write	c
on	c
walls	c
and	c
desks.	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
some	c
rules	c
also	c
at	c
home	c
,	c
but	c
they	c
are	c
few	c
.	c

I	c
can	c
do	c
everything	c
I	c
want	c
,	c
except	c
going	c
out	c
with	c
the	c
car	c
during	c
the	c
night	c
.	c

My	c
parents	c
are	c
afraid	c
of	c
it	c
because	c
I	c
took	i
my	i
licence	i
only	i
in	c
September	c
.	c

My	c
parents	c
also	c
like	c
eating	c
all	c
together	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
is	c
n't	c
a	c
rule	c
,	c
only	c
an	i
habitude	i
!	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
think	c
there	c
is	c
something	i
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
change	c
!	c

I	c
like	c
my	c
life	c
,	c
both	c
at	c
school	c
and	c
at	c
home	c
!	c

I	c
just	c
receive	i
your	c
letter	c
with	c
the	c
good	c
news	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
happy	c
for	i
winning	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
glad	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
that	c
I	c
am	c
planning	c
to	c
go	c
but	i
I	c
can	c
only	c
travel	c
on	i
July	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
work	c
until	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
June	c
.	c

For	i
the	c
accommodation	c
I	i
would	c
like	c
to	c
have	c
log	i
cabins	i
rather	c
than	c
tents	i
because	c
two	c
weeks	c
is	c
quite	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
they	c
are	c
more	c
comfortable	c
and	c
give	c
you	c
more	c
privacy	c
.	c

I	c
enjoy	c
swimming	c
and	c
singing	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
join	c
others	c
in	c
these	c
activities	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
an	c
average	c
swimmer	c
and	c
as	c
a	c
singer	c
I	c
am	c
not	c
a	c
start	i
but	i
it	c
would	c
be	c
fun	c
to	c
share	c
my	c
songs	c
with	c
the	c
holiday	c
makers	c
.	c

Can	c
you	c
please	c
give	c
me	c
some	c
recomendations	i
about	c
the	c
clothes	c
I	c
will	c
need	c
and	c
also	c
the	c
cost	c
of	c
the	c
food	c
there	c
to	c
make	i
my	c
budget	c
.	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
everything	c
looks	c
different	c
if	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
make	i
a	c
present	c
for	c
someone	c
in	c
my	c
family	c
.	c

I	c
start	c
thinking	c
what	i
she	c
or	c
he	c
prefer	i
and	c
I	c
try	c
my	c
best	c
buying	i
something	c
apropiate	i
does	i
n't	i
matter	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
does	i
it	c
cost	i

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
also	c
expecting	c
to	c
get	c
some	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
45	c
minutes	c
late	c
.	c

Then	c
,	c
as	c
we	c
were	c
told	c
that	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
begginning	i
,	c
the	c
second	c
shock	c
of	c
the	c
evening	c
faced	c
us	c
.	c

Watching	c
the	c
show	c
plus	c
the	c
45	c
minutes	c
of	c
delay	c
made	c
us	c
hungry	c
of	c
course	c
so	c
we	c
decided	c
to	c
eat	c
at	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
.	c

We	c
were	c
also	c
disappointed	c
because	c
there	c
were	c
no	c
discounts	c
!	c

(	c
As	c
I	c
mentioned	c
above	c
)	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
disappointed	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
asking	c
for	c
some	c
money	c
back	c
if	c
possible	c

PAT	c
AND	c
SECRETS	c

....	c

Everybody	c
was	c
given	c
a	c
job	c
,	c
and	c
Pat	c
's	c
job	c
was	c
buying	c
the	c
cake	c
and	c
the	c
candles	c
.	c

The	c
best	c
bakery	c
was	c
at	i
the	c
other	c
side	c
of	c
the	c
town	c
so	c
there	c
was	c
no	c
danger	c
for	i
him	c
to	i
see	i
Alison	c
and	c
reveal	i
the	c
party	c
.	c

On	c
his	c
way	c
he	c
saw	c
lots	c
of	c
places	c
he	c
could	c
buy	i
the	c
birthday	c
cake	c
but	c
knowing	c
that	c
the	c
safest	c
one	c
was	c
the	c
one	c
which	c
is	i
as	i
andy	i
as	i
Alison	c
's	c
house	c
he	i
kept	c
on	c
riding	c
.	c

When	c
he	c
reached	c
the	c
bakery	c
,	c
he	c
was	c
quite	c
relieved	c
and	c
he	c
almost	c
forgot	c
that	c
he	c
had	c
a	c
secret	c
to	c
keep	c
.	c

Picking	i
the	c
best	c
cake	c
he	c
was	c
preparing	c
to	c
go	c
back	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
tell	c
your	i
some	i
things	i
that	c
happened	c
to	c
me	c
at	c
the	c
theatre	c
,	i
at	i
that	i
moment	i
I	c
felt	c
astonish	i
thinking	i
about	i
:	c
"	c
How	c
an	i
important	c
theatre	c
have	c
problems	c
like	c
this.	i
"	c

First	c
the	c
starring	i
was	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
but	c
then	c
another	c
man	c
took	c
his	c
place	c
,	i
I	c
could	c
n't	c
believe	c
it	c
,	i
you	i
could	i
n't	i
change	i
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
a	c
very	c
important	c
artist	c
,	c
and	c
put	c
a	c
begginer	i
one	i
.	i

It	c
was	c
very	c
disappointing	c
.	c

Yes	c
,	c
45	c
minutes	c
,	i
I	c
want	c
to	c
see	c
you	c
in	c
that	c
case	i
.	c

What	c
would	c
you	c
do	c
?	c

I	c
felt	c
like	c
a	c
dumb	i
,	c
and	c
all	c
the	c
people	i
felt	c
like	i
me	i
.	c

And	c
well	c
,	c
do	c
n't	c
talk	c
about	c
the	c
discounts	c
,	c
because	c
they	c
did	c
n't	c
exist	c
.	c

More	c
than	c
that	c
,	c
the	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
on	i
repairing	i
.	c

Maria	c
passed	i
all	c
the	i
day	c
thinking	c
about	c
who	c
told	c
them	c
that	c
,	i
there	i
were	c
two	c
posibilities	i
:	c
one	c
her	i
best	c
friend	c
Becca	c
or	i
his	i
sister	c
Pat	c
.	c

But	c
the	c
problem	c
began	c
to	c
increase	i
because	c
all	c
her	c
friends	c
knew	c
her	c
secret	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
like	c
a	c
"	c
chain	c
reaction	c
"	c
,	c
until	c
Maria	c
did	c
n't	c
want	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
school	c
any	i
more	i
,	i
her	i
mother	c
talked	c
to	c
her	c
,	c
but	c
there	c
was	c
no	c
case	i
,	i
she	i
was	c
very	c
angry	c
and	c
hurt	c
.	c

But	c
there	c
was	c
a	c
problem	c
,	i
how	c
to	c
said	i
it	c
to	c
Pat	c
,	c
in	c
a	c
good	c
or	c
in	c
a	c
bad	c
way	c
,	i
she	i
decided	c
for	c
the	c
good	c
one	c
.	c

Obviously	c
,	c
Pat	c
first	c
refused	i

I	c
am	c
writing	c
you	i
to	i
know	i
about	c
some	c
comments	c
and	c
suggestions	c
from	c
some	c
students	c
about	c
the	c
trip	c
you	c
have	c
already	i
organized	c
to	c
London	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
opened	i
from	c
10:00	c
to	c
19:00	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
for	c
free	c
for	c
students	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
allow	c
us	c
to	c
go	c
we	c
could	c
change	c
the	c
programme	c
in	c
this	i
way	i
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
on	c
Monday	c
morning	c
we	c
can	c
visit	c
the	c
presentation	c
of	c
the	c
latest	c
fashions	c
and	c
in	c
the	c
afternoon	c
we	c
could	c
take	c
a	c
sightseeing	c
by	i
bus	c
.	c

We	c
hope	c
you	c
consider	i
our	c
suggestions	c
letting	i
us	c
know	c
your	c
answer	c
.	c

The	c
home	c
of	c
the	c
Future	c

All	c
this	c
will	c
happen	c
in	c
the	c
next	c
50	c
years	c
,	c
how	c
can	c
we	c
be	c
prepared	c
to	c
receive	c
all	c
these	c
things	c
in	c
our	c
homes	c
?	c

Nowadays	c
,	c
our	c
home	c
life	c
allow	i
us	c
to	c
have	c
more	c
free	c
time	c
to	c
spend	c
doing	c
leisure	c
activities	c
like	c
practising	c
sports	c
or	c
going	c
out	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
close	i
future	c
we	c
will	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
do	c
nothing	c
because	c
everything	c
will	c
be	c
done	c
by	c
computers	c
and	c
machines	c
,	i
(	c
washing-up	i
,	c
hovering	i
,	c
ironing	c
,	c
gardening	c
,	c
cooking	c
,	c
etc.	c
)	c
The	c
question	c
is	c
,	c
will	c
it	c
be	c
better	i
life	c
?	c

On	c
the	c
one	c
hand	c
,	c
we	c
will	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
spend	c
more	c
time	c
with	c
our	c
family	c
and	c
not	c
to	i
be	i
worried	c
about	c
anything	c
.	c

No	c
more	c
housework	c
,	c
no	c
more	c
stress	c
,	c
nor	i
more	c
illnesses	c
;	c
everything	c
will	c
be	c
perfect	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
life	c
will	c
be	c
boring	c
,	c
a	c
large	c
amount	c
of	c
workers	c
will	c
be	c
have	i
redundant	c
and	c
housewives	c
will	c
not	c
have	c
anything	c
to	c
do	c
which	i
will	c
be	c
extremely	c
boring	c
and	c
tedious	c
.	c

What	c
do	c
you	c
prefer	c

that	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
experience	c
a	c
reall	i

again	c

I	c
need	c
relax	i
after	c

in	c
the	c

thats	i
why	c
I	c
choose	c
photography	c

which	c
are	c
not	c

I	c
would	c

to	c

We	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
belive	i
that	c
shopping	c
is	c
the	c
most	c
wonderful	c
part	c
of	c
our	c
life	c
.	c

We	c
love	c
spending	c
money	c
,	c
but	c
spending	c
money	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

Why	c
its	i
always	c
the	c
same	c
!	c

The	c
answer	c
is	c
that	c
we	c
choose	c
the	c
same	c
street	c
(	c
usually	c
the	c
most	c
popular	c
)	c
and	c
the	c
same	c
time	c
as	c
six	c
hundrets	i
other	c
people	c
.	c

We	c
become	c
customers	c
who	c
want	c
to	c
do	c
their	c
shopping	c
with	c
pleasure	c
.	c

Jane	c
Clark	c

The	c
organiser	i
,	c

I	c
am	c
writting	i
to	c
you	c
to	c
give	c
your	i
my	c
opinion	c
about	c
your	c
festival	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
great	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
could	c
be	c
even	c
better	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
if	c
you	c
can	i
have	c
more	c
than	c
six	c
countries	c
,	c
it	c
could	i
be	c
great	c
.	c

This	c
idea	c
is	i
in	i
relation	i
with	i
the	c
number	c
of	c
plays	c
and	c
films	c
.	c

If	c
there	c
are	c
more	c
stars	c
and	c
artists	c
from	c
around	c
the	c
world	c
,	c
there	i
are	i
more	i
plays	i
and	i
films	i
and	i
it	c
is	i
better	c
.	c

A	i
least	i
suggestion	c
for	c
next	c
year	c
's	c
festival	c
is	c
to	c
invite	c
some	c
"	c
salsa	c
"	c
band	i
,	i
It	c
would	c
be	c
great	c
to	c
listen	c
and	c
dance	c
in	i
the	c
same	c
time	c
"	i
salsa	c
"	c
music	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	i

Dear	c
Jimmie	c
,	c

Firstly	c
in	i
the	i
school	c
it	c
is	c
not	c
permitted	c
to	c
smoking	i
in	c
the	c
no	i
smoking	i
area	c
or	c
in	c
the	c
classroom	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
put	i
the	c
music	c
too	i
hight	i
when	c
my	c
syster	i
is	c
working	c
.	c

But	c
there	c
are	c
also	c
some	c
life	i
's	i
rules	c
,	c
like	c
do	c
not	c
put	c
legs	i
on	c
the	c
table	c
when	c
we	c
are	c
eating	c
or	c
eat	i
with	c
my	i
fingers	c
.	c

There	c
are	i
not	c
really	c
anything	c
that	c
I	c
could	i
like	c
to	c
change	c
,	c
because	c
,	c
as	c
you	c
know	c
,	c
in	c
France	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
not	c
really	c
strict	c
rules	c
like	c
in	c
China	c
or	c
other	c
countries	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
I	c
answered	c
to	i
your	c
question	c
.	c

Dear	c
Ms	c
Clark	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
in	c
connection	c
with	c
the	c
advertisement	c
in	c
newspaper	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
express	i
a	c
couple	c
of	c
thoughts	c
that	c
I	c
have	i
after	c
the	c
festival	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
recently	c
seen	c
.	c

I	c
believe	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
great	c
idea	c
to	c
organise	c
such	c
a	c
festivel	i
,	c
connected	c
with	c
art	c
and	c
culture	c
.	c

Especially	i
the	i
date	c
was	c
very	c
suitable	c
for	c
me	c
,	c
as	c
I	c
have	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
free	c
time	c
.	c

What	c
is	c
more	c
there	i
was	c
a	c
wide	c
vareiety	i
of	c
music	c
Although	i
the	c
artists	c
were	c
supposed	c
to	c
be	c
from	c
all	c
counties	i
,	c
there	c
were	c
only	c
six	c
nationalities	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
kind	c
attention	c
and	c
I	c
hope	c
that	c
my	c
advices	i
would	i
occur	i
useful	c
.	c

To	c
begin	c
with	c
,	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
show	c
you	c
how	i
are	i
my	i
obligations	i
at	c
school	c
.	c

Although	c
we	c
have	c
to	c
change	c
our	c
boots	i
,	c
we	c
do	c
n't	c
need	c
to	c
wear	c
special	c
uniforms	c
.	c

Our	c
clothes	c
should	c
be	c
in	c
a	i
good	c
taste	c
.	c

When	c
it	c
goes	i
to	c
my	c
home	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
I	c
have	c
usual	i
duties	c
I	i
have	c
to	c
clean	c
my	c
room	c
,	c
wash	c
the	c
dishes	c
or	c
vacuum	c
the	c
carpets	c
,	c
but	c
they	c
're	c
not	c
exhausting	c
things	c
,	c
as	c
I	c
share	c
them	c
with	c
my	c
sister	c
and	c
brother	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
that	c
it	i
'll	i
claryfy	i
your	c
questions	c
and	c
doubts	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
foreward	i
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c

1997	c
.	c

IT	c
WAS	c
MY	c
FIRST	c
TIME	c
IN	c
LONDON	c
.	c

THAT	c
NIGHT	c
I	i
WENT	c
TO	c
A	c
PUB	c
IN	c
BAYSWATER	c
.	c

I	c
WAS	c
LIVING	c
QUITE	c
CLOUSE	i
TO	c
PORTOBELLO	c
ROAD	c
BUT	c
I	c
DID	c
N'T	c
KNOW	c
VERY	i
WELL	i
THE	i
AREA	i
BECAUSE	c
ALL	c
TIME	i
I	c
JUST	c
HAD	c
TO	c
GET	c
OFF	c
IN	i
THE	c
COURNER	i
OF	c
MY	c
HOUSE	i
.	c

THERE	c
WERE	c
SOME	c
PEOPLE	c
AROUN	i
BUT	c
I	c
WAS	c
AFRAID	c
TO	c
ASK	c
THEM	c
THE	c
WAY	c
I	i
SHOULD	i
TAKE	i
.	c

AT	i
LEAST	i
I	c
ASKED	c
A	c
BOY	c
AND	c
HE	c
SAID	c
"	c

IT	c
WAS	c
DANGEROUS	c

BUT	c
I	c
KNEW	c
I	c
HAD	c
TO	c
DO	c
IT	c

I	c
THANK	i

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Clark	c
,	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
express	c
my	c
opinion	c
about	c
it	c
and	c
give	c
you	c
some	c
suggestions	c
that	c
may	c
prove	c
to	c
be	c
useful	c
.	c

That	c
also	c
refers	i
to	i
the	c
weekend	c
ticket	c
you	c
offer	c
;	c
in	c
addition	c
to	c
being	c
rather	c
cheap	c
,	c
it	c
allowed	c
me	c
to	c
see	c
so	c
many	c
interesting	c
events	c
in	c
such	c
a	c
short	c
time	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
you	c
had	c
said	c
in	c
your	c
advertisement	c
that	c
artists	c
from	c
around	c
the	c
world	c
would	c
perform	c
.	c

What	c
is	c
more	c
,	c
some	c
concert	c
halls	c
were	c
too	c
small	c
.	c

As	c
a	c
result	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
impossible	c
for	c
al	i
the	c
audience	c
to	c
fit	c
in	c
there	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
suggest	c
you	c
should	i
think	c
about	c
giving	c
the	c
audience	c
the	c
opportunity	c
to	c
see	c
more	c
plays	c
and	c
films	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

I	c
'm	c
really	c
happy	c
to	c
hear	c
from	c
you	c
again	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
I	c
'm	c
quite	c
busy	c
so	c
do	c
n't	c
worry	c
if	c
I	i
happen	i
to	i
delay	i
answer	i
to	c
some	c
of	c
your	c
letters	c
.	c

In	c
your	c
last	c
letter	c
you	i
wondered	c
what	c
the	c
rules	c
of	c
behaviour	c
at	c
school	c
and	c
at	c
home	c
are	c
like	c
in	c
my	c
country	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
'm	c
going	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
some	c
information	c
.	c

In	c
Poland	c
rules	i
that	c
refer	c
to	c
the	c
ways	i
of	i
being	i
dressed	i
at	c
school	c
are	c
n't	c
very	c
strict	c
;	c
we	c
do	c
n't	c
wear	c
any	c
uniforms	c
,	c
but	c
our	c
clothes	c
have	c
to	c
be	c
clean	c
and	c
nice	c
to	c
look	c
at	c
.	c

We	c
can	c
neither	c
eat	c
nor	c
drink	c
during	c
the	i
lessons	c
.	c

We	c
are	c
supposed	c
not	c
to	c
be	c
late	c
for	c
the	i
lessons	c
and	c
,	c
of	c
course	c
,	c
students	c
must	c
n't	c
smoke	c
at	c
school	c
.	c

At	c
home	c
young	i
people	c
should	c
help	c
their	c
parents	c
do	c
some	c
houseworks	i
.	c

What	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
change	c
at	c
school	c
is	c
that	c
the	c
breaks	c
are	c
too	c
short	c
!	c

I	c
recently	c
went	c
to	c
London	c
on	c
vacation	c
,	c
with	c
some	c
friends	c
.	c

We	c
were	c
told	c
that	c
this	c
was	c
a	c
great	c
show	c
,	c
and	c
we	c
decided	c
to	c
see	c
how	c
it	c
was	c
.	c

When	c
our	c
final	c
day	c
arrived	c
,	c
we	c
went	c
shoping	i
in	c
the	c
morning	c
and	c
then	c
we	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
hotel	c
to	c
change	c
our	c
clothes	c
and	c
get	c
ready	c
for	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

When	c
we	c
entrance	i
the	c
place	c
our	c
problems	c
begun	i
.	c

First	c
,	c
there	c
were	c
no	c
discount	i
on	c
the	c
tickets	c
but	c
that	c
was	c
fine	c
.	c

Then	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
had	c
a	c
great	c
delay	c
,	c
almost	c
an	c
hour	c
,	i
we	c
deal	i
with	c
that	c

that	c
they	c
changed	c
the	c
principal	c
actor	c
,	c
the	c
one	c
that	c
replaced	c
him	c
was	c
very	c
bad	c

that	c
made	c
us	c

But	c
that	c
is	c
n't	c
all	c

to	c
complete	c
this	c
tragedy	c

I	c
hope	c
that	c
you	c
understand	c
that	i
I	c
want	c
my	c

or	c
at	c

some	c

How	c
has	c
moden	i
technology	c
changed	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
?	c

Nowadays	c
,	c
technology	c
is	c
everywhere	c
,	c
all	c
over	c
your	c
house	c
,	c
your	c
school	c
,	c
ofice	i
or	c
any	c
place	c
you	c
can	c
be	c
in	c
a	c
city	c
.	c

This	c
technology	c
has	c
help	i
to	c
made	i
my	c
life	c
easier	c
and	c
more	c
exciting	c
,	c
but	c
like	c
everithing	i
had	i
some	c
negative	c
thing	i
.	c

This	c
technology	c
has	c
help	i
in	c
many	c
fields	c
,	c
like	c
medicine	c
,	c
entreteinment	i
,	c
work	c
and	c
other	c
thing	i
,	c
so	c
it	c
has	c
obviusly	i
change	i
the	c
life	i
of	c
many	c
people	c
.	c

The	c
bad	c
things	i
that	c
this	c
could	c
have	c
are	c
unimportan	i
,	c
in	c
comperison	i
with	c
all	c
the	c
good	c
things	c
this	i
have	i
done	c
,	c
so	c
let	c
's	c
do	i
n't	i
focus	c
on	c
the	c
negative	c
aspects	c
of	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
technology	c
has	c
become	c
a	c
part	c
of	c
our	c
lifes	i
,	c
so	c
we	c
have	c
to	c
learn	c
how	c
to	c
live	c
in	c
this	c
new	c
world	c
,	c
that	i
is	c
changing	c
as	c
fast	c
as	c
computers	c
change	c

This	c
is	c
a	c
new	c
era	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
this	c
letter	c
to	c
express	c
my	c
thoughts	c
about	c
the	c
International	c
Art	c
Festival	c
of	c
this	c
year	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
so	c
impressed	c
the	i
exhibitions	c
of	i
the	c
festival	c
that	c
you	c
had	i
organized	i
.	c

You	i
may	i
consider	i
my	i
suggestion	i
to	i
have	i
the	i
art	i
festival	i
for	i
next	i
year	i

Yours	c
Sincerely	c

Long	i
long	c
time	c
ago	c
,	c
there	c
were	c
the	i
old	c
man	c
and	c
old	c
woman	c
lived	i
in	i
a	i
foot	c
of	c
mountain	i
.	c

One	c
day	c
,	c
when	c
the	c
old	c
man	c
went	c
into	c
the	c
bambo	i
bush	c
,	c
he	c
found	c
one	i
bambo	i
gritted	i
white	i
.	c

He	c
had	c
never	c
seen	c
such	c
bambo	i
before	c
but	c
decided	c
to	c
cut	c
it	c
down	c
.	c

He	c
took	c
the	c
baby	c
to	c
his	c
house	c
and	c
explained	c
what	c
had	c
happened	c
in	c
the	c
bush	c
to	c
the	c
old	c
woman	c
.	c

The	c
old	c
woman	c
was	c
glad	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
baby	c
and	c
they	c
decided	c
to	c
bring	c
up	c
the	c
baby	c
.	c

She	c
grew	c
very	c
quick	i
and	c
was	c
so	c
beautiful	c
.	c

The	c
old	c
man	c
and	c
woman	c
tried	c
to	c
keep	i
her	c
staying	i
their	i
house	c
,	c
but	c
they	c
could	c
n't	c
.	c

She	c
gone	i
away	c
.	c

She	c
was	c
the	c
princess	c
of	c
the	c
Moon	c
.	c

Dear	c
Manager	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
disappointed	c
because	c
I	c
was	c
longing	c
for	i
seeing	i
them	c
as	i
a	c
fan	c
.	c

In	i
that	c
time	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
it	c
had	c
been	c
being	c
repaired	c
.	c

It	i
's	i
nonsense	c
,	c
was	c
n't	c
it	c
?	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

How	c
has	c
modern	c
technology	c
changed	c
our	c
daily	c
life	c
?	c

Of	c
course	c
,	c
our	c
life	c
will	c
be	c
completely	c
changed	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
if	c
you	c
watch	c
"	c
The	c
Star	c
Trek	c
"	c
-	c
science	c
fiction	c
programme	c
on	c
TV	c
,	c
you	c
will	c
realise	c
that	c
you	c
just	i
can	i
say	c
"	c
Do	c
it	c
"	c
and	c
then	c
the	c
computers	c
will	c
do	c
it	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
some	c
problems	c
.	c

If	c
all	c
your	c
staffs	i
are	c
fulfilled	c
by	c
the	i
computers	c
,	c
we	c
might	c
be	c
idler	c
than	c
now	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
know	c
,	c
even	c
now	c
,	c
science	c
and	c
technology	c
are	c
destroying	c
our	c
environment	c
,	c
for	c
example	c
weird	c
temperature	c
etc.	c
If	c
we	c
do	c
n't	c
protect	c
our	c
environment	c
,	c
our	c
daily	c
life	c
will	c
not	c
be	c
convenient	c
.	c

Rather	c
our	i
daily	c
life	c
will	c
be	c
deteriorated	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c

I	c
was	c
really	c
disappointed	c
therefore	c
I	c
am	c
writing	c
a	c
complain	i
.	c

Firstly	c
I	c
bought	c
the	c
ticket	c
because	c
I	c
like	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
's	c
acting	c
but	c
in	c
the	c
show	c
someone	c
was	c
acting	i
his	c
part	c
.	c

Thirdly	c
the	c
ticket	c
was	c
no	i
discount	i
and	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
I	c
visited	c
theater	i
restaurant	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
close	i
because	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
too	i
late	c
.	c

Your	i
faithfully	c

May	i
be	i
they	c
have	i
more	c
different	i
types	i
of	i
colour	i
than	c
now	c
.	c

The	i
mean	i
of	i
this	i
is	c
all	c
our	c
fashion	i
styles	i
come	c
from	c
history	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
our	c
fashion	i
style	c
at	c
the	c
moment	c
is	i
comes	c
from	c
70's	c
fashion	c
.	c

in	c
future	i
.	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
.	i

I	c
'm	c
very	c
pleased	c
to	c
hearing	i
from	c
you	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
'm	c
glad	c
I	c
've	c
got	c
this	c
chance	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
Camp	c
California	c
in	c
the	c
U.S.A.	c
for	c
two	c
weeks	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
'd	c
prefer	c
to	c
accommodate	i
myself	i
in	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
log	c
cabins	c
,	c
as	c
they	c
are	c
more	c
comfortable	c
,	c
usually	c
have	c
central	c
heating	c
and	c
other	c
necessary	c
facilities	c
.	c

As	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
champion	c
of	i
swimming	i
competition	c
in	c
Russia	c
in	c
1997	c
,	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
continue	c
to	c
practice	i
my	c
skills	c
.	c

Also	c
I	c
like	c
to	c
play	c
tennis	c
,	c
which	c
is	c
beautiful	i
"	c
game	c
"	c
itself	c
and	c
good	c
for	c
figure	i
.	c

In	i
the	i
conclusion	i
I	i
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
if	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
take	c
some	c
money	c
with	c
me	c
and	c
how	c
much	c
?	i

Hope	c
to	c
hear	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c

"	c
Is	c
shopping	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
for	c
you	c
or	c
not	c
"	c
-	c
my	c
English	c
teacher	c
has	c
asked	c
me	c
on	i
the	c
class	c
discussion	c
about	c
shopping	c
.	c

There	c
are	c
always	c
too	c
many	c
people	c
there	c
.	c

As	c
I	c
'm	c
not	c
keen	c
of	i
being	c
a	c
part	c
of	c
the	c
crowd	c
,	c
I	c
prefer	c
a	c
calm	c
atmosphere	c
in	c
more	c
isolated	c
small	c
shops	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
it	c
takes	c
too	c
long	c
to	c
find	c
something	c
you	c
need	c
in	c
unfamiliar	c
stores	c
.	c

Despite	c
I	i
like	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
nice	c
clothes	c
shops	c
I	c
usually	c
return	c
home	c
with	c
nothing	c
in	c
my	c
hands	c
,	c
as	c
prices	c
are	c
usually	c
to	i
high	c
,	c
unfortunately	c
not	i
affordable	i
for	i
me	i
.	c

Otherwise	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
so	c
bad	c
,	c
as	c
you	c
get	c
what	c
you	c
want	c
in	c
the	c
end	c
.	c

Dear	i

in	i
last	c
week	c
which	c
is	c
"	c
The	c

?	c

I	c

good	c
experience	c
and	c
fantastic	c
memory	i

At	c
the	c
same	c
time	c
I	i
have	c
got	c
a	c
small	c
money	i
but	i
it	c
was	c
not	c
important	c
for	i
me	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
my	c
templary	i
job	c
was	c
sound	c
engineer	c
but	c
I	c
was	c
not	c
main	c
engineer	c
.	c

I	c
've	c
just	c
helped	c
for	i
staff	i
.	c

When	c
I	c
was	c
university	i
student	c
,	c
I	c
studied	c
sound	c
effect	i
but	i
I	c
hae	i
n't	i
used	c
effect	c
equepument	i
whole	i
my	i
life	c
because	c
our	c
school	c
dose	i
n't	i
have	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
used	c
this	c
equepument	i
during	c
concert	i
but	i
I	i
was	i
so	i
compricate	i
system	i
.	c

At	c
first	c
I	i
could	c
n't	c
understand	c
this	c
system	c
but	c
our	c
staff	c
was	i
very	c
kind	c
people	c
.	c

They	c
teached	i
me	c
paticulaly	i
.	c

After	c
that	c
I	i
was	c
able	c
to	c
understand	c
this	c
system	c
,	c
time	c
after	c
time	c
.	c

Now	c
,	c
I	c
able	i
to	c
use	c
sound	i
effect	c
system	c
.	c

Take	c
care	c
of	c
youself	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
waiting	c
your	i
letter	c

Hellow	i
!	c

I'am	i
very	c
pleased	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
and	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
that	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
better	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
your	c
Camp	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
this	i
month	c
I	c
usually	c
have	c
a	c
rest	c
and	c
now	c
I	c
am	c
thinking	c
about	c
it	c
.	c

So	c
your	c
advice	c
of	i
going	c
to	c
a	c
camp	c
suits	c
me	c
very	c
well	c
.	c

Answering	i
on	i
our	c
first	c
question	c
about	c
where	c
would	i
I	i
prefer	c
to	c
sleep	c
,	c
I	c
prefer	c
tents	c
because	c
it	i
is	i
closer	c
to	c
nature	c
and	c
I	c
like	c
sleepping	i
in	c
sleepping	i
bags	c
(	c
=BV	c
bags	c
)	c
.	c

Now	c
let	c
me	c
tell	c
you	c
about	c
my	c
sports	c
preferances	i
.	c

From	c
your	c
list	c
of	c
activities	c
I	c
have	c
chosen	c
swimming	c
and	c
surfing	c
,	c
because	c
all	c
of	c
us	c
went	i
out	c
from	c
water	i
and	c
we	c
have	c
to	c
go	c
back	c
there	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
chosen	c
them	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
candidat	i
to	i
masters	c
of	i
sports	c
in	c
water	c
polo	c
.	c

Fedor	c
Gapon	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
is	c
more	c
convinient	i
than	c
seven	c
lessons	c
every	c
day	c
and	c
each	c
of	c
the	c
lessons	c
lasts	c
fourty	i
five	i
minutes	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
convinient	i
,	c
I	c
mean	c
"	c
double	c
"	c
lessons	c
because	i
you	c
have	c
more	c
time	c
to	c
understand	c
matherial	i
what	i
is	c
givven	i
and	i
because	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
prepare	c
only	c
four	c
subjects	c
for	c
"	c
tomorrow	c
"	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
less	i
then	c
seven	c
subjects	c
.	c

As	c
a	c
student	c
of	i
economical	i
form	c
I	c
think	c
I	c
should	c
tell	c
you	c
about	c
one	c
day	c
in	c
time	i
table	i
of	c
our	c
form	c
.	c

On	c
Tuesday	c
we	c
have	c
such	i
lessons	c
English	i
,	c
Math	i
,	c
Economics	c
and	c
Phisics	i
.	c

Especially	c
English	c
and	c
Economics	c
because	c
we	c
are	c
going	c
to	c
become	c
famous	c

must	c
say	c
we	c
realy	i
delighted	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
great	i
idea	c
to	c
do	c
that	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

However	c
concert	i
halls	c
were	c
too	c
small	c
and	c
lots	c
of	c
people	c
could	c
n't	c
get	c
in	i
to	i
concert	i
halls	c
and	c
there	c
were	c
only	i
six	i
countries	i
stars	i
and	i
artists	i
.	c

I	c
believe	c
plays	i
and	i
films	i
should	i
be	i
more	i
than	i
it	i
was	i
for	i
next	c
year	c
and	c
stars	i
and	c
artists	c
should	c
be	c
from	c
round	i
the	c
world	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
,	i
you	c
will	c
concider	i
about	i
my	c
opinions	c
and	c
my	i
suggestions	c
would	i
be	c
helpful	c
for	c
the	i
next	c
year	c
.	c

Look	i
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c

Dear	c
Freddie	c

We	c
never	c
like	c
rules	c
,	c
do	c
we	c
?	c

However	c
there	c
are	c
lots	c
of	c
rules	c
in	c
our	c
lives	c
,	c
both	c
at	c
home	c
and	c
at	c
school	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
countries	i
school	i
we	c
are	c
not	c
allowed	c
to	c
have	c
an	c
argument	c
with	c
class-mates	i
and	c
not	i
allowed	c
to	c
eat	c
at	i
class	c
.	c

We	c
ca	c
n't	c
listen	c
music	i
at	i
class	c
as	i
well	i
.	c

We	c
alway	i
have	c
to	c
keep	c
clean	i
every	i
where	i
,	c
but	c
this	i
kind	i
of	c
rules	c
are	c
not	c
very	c
strict	c
I	c
believe	c
.	c

At	c
home	c
is	i
completely	c
different	c
,	c
my	c
mum	c
is	c
quite	c
organised	c
,	c
so	c
she	c
always	i
puts	i
new	c
rules	c
.	c

I	i
've	i
to	c
cook	c
myself	i
and	c
worst	i
thing	c
is	c
I	c
'm	c
not	c
allowed	c
to	c
listen	c
loud	i
music	c
in	i
everywhere	i
at	c
home	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
not	c
allowed	c
to	c
stay	c
out	c
after	c
midnight	c
.	c

Love	i
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c

Dear	c
Ms	c
Ryan	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
in	c
reply	c
of	i
our	i
letter	c
,	c
that	i
had	i
let	c
me	c
know	c
I	c
am	c
the	c
winner	c
of	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
of	i
your	c
competition	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
happy	c
to	c
spent	i
two	c
weeks	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
in	c
the	c
USA	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
not	c
too	c
bad	c
at	c
these	c
sports	c

Yours	c
Faithfully	i

(	c
It	c
is	c
a	c
graduate	c
engineer	i
school	c
where	c
we	c
are	c
studying	c
mecanics	i
and	c
energetics	i
.	c
)	c

On	i
one	i
hand	i
,	c
we	c
should	c
be	c
interested	c
in	c
the	c
lessons	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
we	c
should	c
interview	c
the	c
teacher	c
of	c
heat	c
transfert	i
since	c
his	c
courses	i
are	c
rally	i
breathtaking	c
.	c

That	c
seems	c
to	c
be	c
quite	c
surprising	c
,	c
yet	c
this	c
teacher	c
manages	c
to	c
convey	c
his	c
knowledge	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
we	c
should	c
be	c
interested	c
in	c
the	c
other	c
activities	c
such	c
as	c
sports	c
wich	i
could	c
appeal	c
more	i
students	c
in	c
our	c
school	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
absolutely	i
not	c
like	i
you	c
described	c
!	c

First	c
,	c
there	c
was	c
a	c
big	c
late	i
about	i
the	c
time	i
.	c

At	i
the	i
top	i
of	i
everything	i
,	c
you	c
proposed	i
us	c
to	c
visit	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

How	c
could	c
we	c
visit	c
this	c
place	c
,	i
if	c
it	c
is	c
not	c
open	c
?	c
!	c

I	c
will	c
not	c
make	c
troubles	i
but	c
I	c
ask	c
you	c
politely	c
my	i
money	c
back	c

Fashion	c
of	c
the	c
Future	c

Future	i
,	i
Everybody	c
ask	i
how	i
will	i
our	i
world	i
look	c
like	c
.	c

What	i
's	i
about	c
the	i
fashion	c
in	c
100	c
years	c
?	c

I	c
think	c
we	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
in	i
consideration	i
our	i
enviroment	i
:	c
The	i
pollution	c
makes	c
more	i
and	i
more	i
the	i
atmosphere	i
warmer	i
.	c

In	c
fact	c
,	c
winterseason	i
will	c
be	c
rare	c
or	c
will	c
maybe	c
even	c
disappear	c
.	c

The	c
ice	c
will	c
smellt	i
,	c
the	c
weather	c
will	c
be	c
warmer	c
.	c

Electronical	i
community	c
takes	i
more	i
and	i
more	i
pace	i
in	c
our	c
habitual	i
lifestyle	c
.	c

We	c
see	i
,	i
the	i
objects	c
will	i
come	i
smaller	c
.	c

So	c
small	c
that	c
I	c
can	c
imagine	i
,	c
they	c
will	c
be	c
introduce	i
(	c
maybe	c
like	c
chips	c
)	c
in	i
our	c
clothes	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
at	i
internet	i
.	c

I	c
'm	c
shure	i
that	c
is	c
not	c
impossible	c
!	c

Clothes	c
will	c
take	c
a	c
very	c
important	c
place	c
in	c
our	c
future	c
.	c

They	c
will	c
be	c
like	c
a	c
second	c
skin	c

Or	c
do	c
you	c
think	c

an	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
with	c
a	c
request	c
for	c
a	c
change	c
in	c
the	c
scedule	i
of	c
our	c
trip	c
to	c
London	c
.	c

But	c
,	c
first	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
the	c
time	c
and	c
the	c
effort	c
you	c
have	c
made	i
to	c
organize	c
the	c
entire	c
programme	c
.	c

Everything	c
seams	c
very	c
interesting	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
sure	c
that	c
we	c
will	c
all	c
have	c
a	c
very	c
good	c
time	c
.	c

All	c
of	c
the	c
students	c
-	c
including	c
my	i
self	i
,	i
think	c
of	c
this	c
as	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
that	c
would	i
be	c
pitty	i
to	c
be	i
missed	i
,	c
especially	c
when	c
students	c
can	c
enter	c
for	c
free	c
.	c

According	c
to	c
the	c
day	c
's	c
programme	c
,	c
we	c
are	c
visiting	c
the	c
Science	c
Museum	c
in	c
the	c
morning	c
and	c
we	c
are	c
going	c
shopping	c
in	c
the	c
afternoon	c
.	c

My	c
suggestion	c
is	c
to	c
use	c
Wednesday	c
's	c
afternoon	c
free	c
time	c
as	c
an	c
alternative	c
solution	i
of	i
the	c
shopping	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
that	c
you	c
will	c
find	i
this	i
possible	i
.	c

It	c
was	c
dangerous	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
knew	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
to	c
try	i
my	c
limits	c
for	i
once	c
again	c
.	c

This	c
is	c
my	c
nature	c
.	c

I	c
've	c
always	c
wanted	c
to	c
taste	c
the	c
freedom	c
that	c
birds	c
have	c
,	c
always	c
been	c
interested	c
in	c
listening	c
to	c
my	c
blood	c
pumpping	i
in	c
my	c
vains	i
,	c
full	c
of	c
adrenaline	c
,	c
tolet	i
myself	c
free	c
to	i
shake	c
,	i
from	c
excitement	c
.	c

There	i
were	c
my	c
thoughts	c
when	c
I	c
first	c
saw	c
the	c
advertisement	c
for	c
a	c
"	c
Sky	i
Dive	i
"	c
.	c

The	c
same	c
afternoon	c
I	c
picked	c
up	c
the	c
phone	c
and	c
I	c
gave	c
them	c
a	c
call	c
.	c

That	c
was	c
it	c
.	c

When	c
the	c
time	c
for	c
the	c
jump	c
came	c
I	c
had	c
some	c
second	c
thoughts	c
.	c

But	c
then	c
,	i
I	c
thought	c
of	c
the	c
birds	c
again	c
-	c
of	c
how	c
nice	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
to	c
share	c
their	c
world	c
for	c
a	c
few	c
minutes	c
and	c
,	i
I	c
jumped	c
!	c

Well	c
,	c
danger	c
is	c
in	c
my	c
nature	c
an	i
Life	c
is	c
nothing	c
but	c
an	c
adventure	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
,	c

We	c
know	c
that	c
we	c
will	c
spend	c
three	c
days	c
in	c
London	c
in	c
a	c
with	i
a	c
determinate	i
programme	c
.	c

As	c
I	c
see	c
your	i
programme	c
the	i
shopping	c
is	i
at	c
the	c
same	c
time	c
of	i
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
so	i
I	c
'll	c
make	c
you	c
a	c
suggestion	c
:	c
we	c
'll	c
start	c
in	c
the	c
morning	c
with	c
the	c
Science	c
Museum	c
and	c
immediately	c
after	c
we	c
'll	c
go	c
to	c
Central	i
Exhibition	c
Hall	c
without	c
doing	c
shopping	i
.	c

It	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
because	c
for	i
students	i
it	i
's	i
free	i
.	c

Thank	c
you	c

I	c
think	i
that	i
my	i
house	i
is	i
n't	i
of	i
the	c
future	c
.	c

Think	i
people	c
's	c
homes	c
will	c
be	c
different	c
in	c
the	c
future	i
about	i
the	i
new	i
materials	i
of	i
structures	i
,	c
they	c
will	c
have	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
computers	c
for	c
doing	i
recipes	i
and	c
making	i
shopping	i
while	c
you	c
are	c
staying	i
at	c
home	c
.	c

We	c
will	c
have	c
a	c
relaxing	c
room	c
,	c
with	c
soft	c
light	c
,	c
music	i
New	i
Age	i
and	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
essences	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
we	c
ca	c
n't	c
stop	c
the	i
progress	c
but	c
if	c
we	c
want	c
we	c
can	c
conserve	c
traditional	i
things	c
.	c

The	c
home	c
of	c
the	c
future	c
will	c
be	c
very	c
impersonally	i
and	c
the	c
atmosfear	i
will	c
be	c
cold	c
and	c
very	c
essencial	i
.	c

1/3/2000	c

Dear	c
Mr.	c
Robertson	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
a	c
student	c
in	c
English	i
class	c
which	c
going	i
to	c
spend	c
three	c
days	c
in	c
London	c
(	c
13th-14th	c
March	c
)	c
and	c
I	c
'm	c
a	i
representative	i
student	i
from	c
my	c
class	c
to	i
thanks	i
you	c
about	i
your	i
programme	c
that	c
you	c
've	c
already	i
organised	c
for	c
us	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
really	c
wonderful	c
especially	i
the	c
River	c
trip	c
to	c
Greenwich	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
the	c
students	c
in	c
my	c
class	c
,	i
we	i
have	c
seen	c
an	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
which	i
will	c
be	c
on	c
14th	c
March	c
between	c
10.00	c
to	c
19.00	c
at	c
the	c
Central	c
Exhibition	c
Hall	c
,	c
London	c
.	c

The	c
show	c
has	c
many	c
interesting	c
parts	i
such	c
as	c
latest	i
fashions	c
,	c
leisure	c
and	c
sports	c
wear	c
,	c
make	i
up	i
and	c
Hairstyles	c
and	c
we	c
are	c
all	c
agreed	c
that	c
it	c
's	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
for	c
us	c
because	c
most	c
of	c
us	c
are	c
going	c
to	c
study	c
Fashion	i
and	c
Design	c
course	c
in	i
next	c
term	c
and	c
the	c
other	c
students	c
are	c
also	c
interesting	i
in	c
new	c
fashion	i
.	c

So	c
we	c
think	c
that	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
useful	c
for	c
all	c
of	c
us	c
.	c

Anyway	c
,	c
we	c
still	c
want	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
Science	c
Museum	c
and	c
shopping	i
as	c
well	c
but	c
we	c
think	c
we	c
can	c
go	c
shopping	c
on	c
the	c
last	c
day	i
afternoon	c
of	c
our	c
trip	c
.	c

So	c
we	c
will	c
have	c
free	i
time	c
on	c
the	c
afternoon	c
of	c
the	c
14th	c
March	c
and	c
we	c
can	c
spend	c
this	c
time	c
enjoy	i
the	c
show	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
also	c
include	i
the	c
show	c
's	c
leaflet	c
on	c
the	c
back	c
of	c
this	c
letter	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
see	i
your	c
programme	c
.	c

We	i
're	i
always	c
want	c
to	c
know	c
about	c
others	c
'	c
life	i
especially	i
the	c
famous	c
one	i
even	c
the	c
one	i
that	c
we	c
hate	c
.	c

But	c
we	c
have	c
to	c
accept	c
that	c
everyone	c
has	c
their	c
private	c
life	i
for	i
example	c
when	i
we	c
get	c
married	c
or	c
when	c
policeman	i
stop	i
us	c
on	c
the	c
highway	c
,	c
we	c
do	c
n't	c
want	c
any	c
stranger	c
notice	i
that	i
what	c
is	c
happening	c
to	c
us	c
.	c

Famous	c
people	c
are	c
also	c
the	i
normal	c
people	c
like	c
us	i
just	i
because	c
their	c
jobs	i
are	i
known	i
by	c
every	i
people	i
,	c
it	c
does	c
n't	c
mean	c
that	c
we	c
can	c
invade	c
their	c
privacy	c
.	c

We	c
also	c
ca	c
n't	c
deny	c
that	c
the	c
journalists	c
'	c
job	c
is	c
to	c
know	c
what	c
's	c
going	c
on	c
with	c
these	c
famous	c
people	c
.	c

But	c
it	c
does	c
n't	c
mean	c
that	c
they	c
have	c
to	c
follow	c
these	c
stars	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
,	i
they	i
should	c
give	c
them	c
some	c
privacy	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
these	c
stars	c
should	c
accept	c
that	c
they	c
are	c
famous	c
people	c
so	c
everyone	c
wants	c
to	c
know	c
about	c
their	c
life	c
.	c

The	c
best	c
way	c
is	c
they	i
,	c
the	c
famous	c
stars	c
and	c
the	c
journalists	c
,	c
should	i
compromise	c
and	c
respect	c
each	c
other	c
's	c
rights	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
play	i
the	c
role	c
instead	c
of	c
him	c
.	c

On	c
top	c
of	c
everything	c
,	c
although	c
your	c
advertisement	c
told	c
me	c
that	c
I	c
would	c
receive	c
some	c
discounts	c
,	c
there	c
were	c
no	c
discounts	c
available	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
really	c
disappointed	c
at	i
your	c
show	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

In	c
other	c
words	c
,	c
their	c
fashion	c
has	c
become	c
more	c
casual	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
this	c
tendancy	i
will	c
become	c
more	c
common	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
.	c

When	c
they	c
were	c
young	c
,	c
they	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
this	c
is	c
still	c
correct	c
.	c

What	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
say	c
is	c
that	c
people	c
do	c
n't	c

enough	i

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
express	c
the	c
deserve	i
of	c
all	c
students	i
in	c
my	c
class	c
to	c
visit	c
the	c
LONDON	c

LEISURE	c
SHOW	c

All	c

have	c
seen	c
an	c
advertisement	c
for	c
that	c
and	c
they	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

especially	c
the	c
part	c
of	i
the	c
Latest	c
Fashions	c
,	c
because	c
is	i
something	c
which	c
affect	i
the	i
people	c
of	c
all	c
ages	c
today	c
.	c

But	c
also	c
the	c
rest	i
parts	c
of	c
the	c
show	c
seems	i
to	c
be	c
very	c
interesting	c
.	c

Leisure	c
and	c
Sports	c
Wear	c
is	c
very	c
interesting	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
young	c
people	c
are	c
affected	c
from	i
that	c
in	c
the	c
way	c
they	c
dressed	i
.	c

Make	i
up	i
and	c
Hairstyles	c
are	c
also	c
very	c
important	c
especially	i
For	c
our	c
class	c
,	c
because	c
the	i
most	c
students	i
of	i
our	c
class	c
are	c
girls	c

The	c
girls	c
are	c
interesting	i
more	i
than	c
boys	c
,	i
For	i
make	i
up	i

and	c
they	c
want	c
to	c
know	c
all	c
the	c
latest	c
news	c
about	c
these	c

I	c
know	c
that	c
for	c
Tuesday	c
14	c
March	c
you	c
have	c
already	c
organise	i
the	c
programme	c
which	i
including	i

I	c

For	c

Yours	c
sincerelly	i

I	c
think	c
that	c
they	c
have	c
right	i
because	c
,	i
they	c
are	c
also	c
people	c
like	c
me	i
or	i
like	i
you	i
and	c
they	c
should	c
have	c
private	i
life	c
.	c

Private	i
life	c
is	c
very	c
important	c
to	i
anyone	i
,	c
because	c
your	c
job	c
create	i
you	i
stress	c
and	c
you	c
should	c
rest	c

charge	i
your	c
batteries	c
For	c
the	c
next	c
day	c

If	c
journalists	c

Last	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
can	c
arrange	c
2	c
weeks	c
in	c
July	c
with	i
my	c
school	c
holidays	c
,	c
in	c
order	c
not	c

In	i
both	i
of	i
them	i
I	i
am	i
very	i
good	i
.	c

I	c
have	c
a	c
few	c
questions	c
.	c

How	c
much	c
money	c
should	c
I	c
take	c
to	c
spend	c
in	c
those	c
two	c
weeks	c
?	c
and	c
also	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	i
should	i
take	c
?	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

We	c
are	c
going	c
to	c
do	i
a	c
video	c
about	c
daily	c
life	c
at	c
school	c
,	i
the	i
following	c
classes	c
are	c
the	c
ones	c
I	c
recomend	i
to	i
film	i
.	c

ENGLISH	c
:	c
the	c
classroom	c
is	c
beautifull	i
,	c
and	c
in	i
the	c
same	c
day	c
we	c
do	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
diferents	i
activities	c
,	c
so	c
it	c
wo	c
n't	c
be	c
boring	c
watching	c
it	c
because	c
we	c
can	c
have	c
a	c
great	c
time	c
there	c
.	c

SPANISH	c
:	c
We	c
are	c
doing	c
a	c
play	c
now	c
.	c

We	c
could	c
film	c
it	c
and	c
produce	c
it	c
,	i
instead	i
of	c
uniform	i
we	c
could	c
wear	c
costumes	c
,	i
the	i
ones	c
that	i
are	c
animals	c
could	c
pain	i
their	c
faces	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
if	c
we	c
do	c
it	c
properly	c
we	c
could	c
have	c
a	c
great	c
spanish	i
play	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
some	c
problems	c
I	c
had	c
when	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
two	c
weeks	c
ago	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
were	c
supposed	c
to	c
perform	c
in	c
the	c
show	c
but	c
instead	c
of	c
them	c
different	c
actors	c
performed	c
badly	i
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
should	c
have	c
had	i
started	c
at	c
19:30	c
but	c
it	c
started	c
later	i
,	c
at	c
20:15	c
.	c

I	c
also	c
wanted	c
to	c
visit	c
the	c
Theatre	c
Restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
but	c
it	i
was	c
impossible	c
because	c
it	c
closed	c
at	c
20:30	c
and	c
the	c
show	c
finished	c
at	c
21:00	c

I	c
would	c
not	c
like	c
to	c
take	c
legal	c
action	c
,	c
as	c
it	c
would	c
not	c
be	c
convenient	c
for	c
both	i
of	c
us	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
will	c
if	c
I	c
consider	c
it	c
necessary	c
.	c

I	c
will	c
be	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Yours	c
Faithfully	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
but	c
she	c
was	c
my	c
best	c
friend	c
and	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
tell	c
someone	c
what	c
had	c
happened	c
to	c
me	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
phoned	c
her	c
and	c
told	c
her	c
the	c
whole	c
story	c
.	c

Last	c
weekend	c
in	i
the	c
Local	c
Festival	c
,	c
that	i
is	c
held	c
every	c
year	c
in	c
our	c
Town	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
walking	c
with	c
my	c
little	c
sister	c
,	c
who	c
is	c
three	c
years	c
old	c
.	c

She	c
started	c
running	c
and	c
got	c
lost	c
.	c

So	c
while	c
I	c
was	c
looking	c
for	c
her	c
I	c
saw	c
the	c
Director	c
of	c
my	c
school	c
,	c
Mr	c
Smythe	c
,	c
stealing	c
money	c
from	c
a	c
small	c
shop	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
not	c
believe	c
my	c
eyes	c
!	c

When	c
Mr	c
Smythe	c
saw	c
me	c
there	c
,	c
he	c
told	c
me	c
:	c
"	c
If	c
you	c
say	c
a	c
word	c
you	c
're	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
in	c
serious	c
trouble.	c
"	c

But	c
Pat	c
could	c
not	c
resist	c
the	c
temptention	i
of	i
calling	i
the	c
police	c
.	c

We	c
were	c
at	c
school	c
when	c
she	c
told	c
me	c
this	c
and	c
Mr	c
Smythe	c
went	c
to	c
our	c
class	c
and	c
said	c
to	c
me	c
"	i
May	c
I	c
talk	c
to	c
you	c
?	c
"	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
pleased	c
that	c
I	c
won	c
your	c
competition	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
I	c
already	i
made	i
an	c
arrangement	c
with	c
my	c

days	c
.	c

I	c

The	c
two	c
activities	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
choose	c
are	c
:	i
Photography	i

Surfing	i
.	c

Surfing	c
is	c
my	c
passion	c
.	c

I	c

I	c

.	c

I	c
hope	c
I	c
have	c
informed	i
you	c
enough	c
.	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

How	c
are	c
you	c
?	c

It	c
was	c
fantastic	c
.	c

You	c
also	c
would	c
have	c
liked	c
very	i
much	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
to	c
help	c
back	i
stages	i
.	c

That	c
was	c
a	c
good	c
feeling	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
to	c
tell	c
them	c
when	c
they	c
had	c
to	c
go	c
on	c
stages	i
.	c

I	c
also	c
had	c
to	c
give	c
them	c
drinks	c
and	c
food	c
and	c
help	c
them	c
to	c
relax	c
whenever	c
they	c
were	c
nervous	c
.	c

Oke	i
,	c
they	c
screamed	c
at	c
me	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
because	c
they	c
were	c
nervous	c
and	c
excited	c
about	c
their	c
concert	c
.	c

Afterwards	c
they	c
talk	i
to	c
me	c
and	c
thanking	i
me	c
for	c
helping	c
them	c
in	c
those	c
exciting	c
moments	c
.	c

They	c
also	c
took	c
me	c
to	c
a	i
after	i
hour	i
party	c
and	c
they	c
asked	c
me	c
if	c
would	i
like	c
to	c
do	c
this	c
again	c
.	c

And	c
of	c
course	c
I	c
immediately	c
said	c
Yes	i

!	c

The	i
will	c
call	c
me	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

Last	c
week	c
I	c
had	c
the	c
chance	c
to	c
spend	c
time	c
in	c
London	c
and	c
this	c
is	c
why	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
musical	i
show	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
I	c
had	i
unfortunately	i
a	c
very	c
bad	c
evening	c
.	c

Indeed	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
surprise	i
to	c
ear	i
when	c
I	c
asked	c
for	c
a	c
discount	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
possible	c
to	c
have	i
one	c
.	c

The	c
other	c
bad	c
point	c
was	c
the	c
time	c
when	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
already	c
20:15	c
when	c
the	c
first	c
star	c
entred	i
on	c
the	i
scene	i
,	c
but	c
your	c
advertisement	c
sayed	i
19.30	c
!	c

Finaly	i
,	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
understand	c
why	c
you	c
pushed	c
people	c
to	c
visit	c
your	c
restaurant	c
if	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
open	c
it	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
!	c

This	c
is	c
why	c
for	i
all	c
of	c
those	i
good	c
reasons	c
I	i
am	c
asking	c
for	c
some	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
sure	c
you	c
will	c
understand	c
my	c
request	c
regarding	c
my	c
complaint	c
,	c
your	c
credibility	c
is	c
depending	c
of	i
.	i

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
earing	i
from	c
you	c
.	c

Since	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
the	c
40's	c
which	i
is	c
the	c
period	c
where	i
the	i
technology	c
started	c
,	i
nobody	c
can	c
say	c
that	c
nothing	c
has	c
changed	c
.	c

Every	c
day	c
,	c
from	c
the	c
morning	c
to	c
the	c
evening	c
we	c
are	c
completely	c
dependent	c
of	i
the	i
technology	c
.	c

In	c
fact	c
our	c
life	i
style	i
is	c
based	c
on	c
the	i
technology	c
,	c
now	c
,	c
if	c
we	c
want	c
to	c
stay	c
at	c
home	c
without	c
having	c
contact	c
with	c
other	c
people	c
,	c
we	c
can	c
do	c
it	c
,	c
we	c
just	c
need	c
a	c
computer	c
and	c
a	c
modem	c
and	c
that	c
's	c
it	c
.	c

If	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
discuss	c
with	i
friends	c
or	c
order	c
a	c
Pizza	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
do	c
it	c
easely	i
as	c
I	c
want	c
,	c
when	c
it	i
want	c
.	c

In	i
spite	i
of	c
that	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
the	i
technology	c
is	c
improving	c
my	c
quality	c
of	c
life	c
.	c

If	c
I	c
compare	c
my	c
life	c
now	c
with	c
the	c
life	c
of	c
my	c
grand	i
parents	i
,	c
I	c
think	c
both	c
are	c
comparable	c
,	i
I	c
say	c
that	c
because	c
without	c
knowing	c
the	i
technology	c
,	c
it	c
's	c
difficult	c
to	c
imagine	c
a	c
best	i
life	c
,	c
in	c
fact	c
,	c
you	c
leave	i
with	i
your	i
time	i
.	c

Even	c
if	c
the	i
technology	c
is	c
important	c
for	c
my	c
quality	c
of	c
life	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
not	c
able	c
to	c
say	c
if	c
it	i
will	c
continue	c
to	c
be	c
the	c
case	c
in	c
10	c
years	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
with	c
reference	c
to	c
the	c
three	i
day	i
trip	c
in	i
London	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
my	c
classmates	c
and	c
I	c
also	c
found	c
another	c
fascinating	c
thing	c
about	c
the	c
trip	c
.	c

It	i
is	c
'	c
The	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
'	c
at	c
Central	i
Exhibition	c
Hall	c
in	c
London	c
on	c
14th	i
of	c
March	c
,	c
which	c
shows	c
the	c
latest	c
fashions	c
,	c
leisure	c
and	c
sports	c
wear	c
,	c
make	i
up	i
and	c
hairstyles	c
.	c

We	c
all	c
found	c
it	c
exciting	c
and	c
exhilarating	c
.	c

It	c
must	i
be	i
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
show	c
because	c
we	c
are	c
keen	c
on	c
fashions	c
and	c
clothes	c

We	c
can	c
go	c
shopping	c
on	c
Wednesday	c
afternoon	c
at	i
the	i
free	c
time	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	i
,	c

Famous	c
people	c
,	c
such	c
as	c
politicians	c
and	c
film	c
stars	c
,	c
are	c
always	c
followed	c
by	c
journalists	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
it	c
might	c
be	c
a	c
good	c
thing	c
that	c
scandales	i
usually	c
increase	c
their	c
fame	c
,	c
even	c
if	c
they	c
did	i
anything	i
wrong	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
also	c
said	c
that	c
their	c
private	c
lives	c
must	c
not	c
be	c
intruded	c
,	i
as	c
they	c
are	c
the	c
same	c
as	c
us	c
,	c
human	c
beings	c
.	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
although	c
I	c
think	c
they	c
ought	c
to	c
abondone	i
their	c
lives	c
partly	c
when	c
they	c
entre	i
the	c
world	c
of	c
fame	c
,	c
they	c
should	c
take	c
some	c
actions	i
against	c
journalists	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
protect	c
their	c
human	c
rights	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

An	c
actor	c
was	c
changed	c
and	c
the	c
pubblic	i
were	c
no	i
informated	i
.	c

The	c
show	c
started	c
45	c
minuts	i
late	c
without	c
valid	i
reasons	c
!	c

At	i
the	i
end	i
,	c
the	c
theatre	c
resturant	i
was	c
closed	c
for	c
holiday	i
!	c

At	c
the	c
bottom	c
of	c
the	c
advertisement	c
was	c
wrote	i
:	c

"	c
YOUR	c
PERFECT	c
EVENING	c
OUT	c
"	c
but	c
I	c
think	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
very	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
!	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
read	c
this	c
and	c
write	c
me	i
to	c
know	i
somethings	i
about	c
my	c
money	c

I	c
think	c
the	i
modern	c
tecnology	i
is	c
very	c
important	c
to	i
my	c
life	c
.	c

I	c
also	c
think	c
I	c
am	c
lucky	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
live	c
in	c
a	c
period	c
of	c
tecnologic	i
boom	c
.	c

First	c
the	c
conquist	i
of	c
the	i
space	c
,	c
then	c
the	i
computers	c
,	c
and	c
now	c
the	c
new	c
biotecnologies	i
have	c
changed	c
,	c
and	c
are	c
changing	c
,	c
the	c
face	c
of	c
the	c
word	i
.	c

My	c
daily	c
life	c
should	c
be	c
changed	c
by	c
these	c
innovations	c
!	c

If	c
I	c
look	c
back	c
in	i
the	c
past	c
I	c
can	i
find	c
that	c
computer	i
is	c
following	c
the	c
same	c
street	i
of	i
television	c
,	c
telephon	i
and	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
other	c
things	c
,	i
that	c
now	c
the	c
biggest	i
part	c
of	c
population	i
have	c
at	c
home	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
in	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
new	c
tecnology	i
has	c
changed	c
,	c
is	c
changeing	i
and	c
will	c
change	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
,	i
I	c
hope	c
that	c
after	i
my	c
life	c
is	i
better	c

THAT	c

GREAT	c
,	c
BECAUSE	c
IT	c
WAS	c
A	c
TERRIFIC	c
DAY	c

FIRST	c
WE	c

VERY	c
EARLY	c
IN	c
THE	c
MORNING	c

UP	i
THE	c

I	c
KNOW	c
THE	c
MUSICIANS	c
FROM	c
THE	i

THAT	i

BEST	c
WISHES	c

HERBERTO	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
suggest	c
you	i
how	c
the	c
programm	i
could	c
be	c
changed	c
.	c

Instead	c
of	c
a	c
shopping	c
tour	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
afternoon	c
we	i
could	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
show	c
and	c
do	c
the	c
shopping	c
on	c
Wedensday	i
afternoon	c
in	c
our	c
free	c
time	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	i
,	c

In	c
the	c
next	c
few	c
years	c
the	i
people	c
's	c
home	i
will	c
be	c
changes	i
a	c
lot	c
.	c

First	i
point	c
we	i
will	c
use	c
more	c
often	c
new	c
technologies	c
like	c
telecommunication	i
or	c
internet	i
.	c

That	c
means	c
for	c
exampel	i
while	i
you	c
are	c
sitting	c
in	c
the	c
office	c
you	c
are	c
able	c
to	c
controll	i
your	c
home	c
with	c
the	c
computer	c
.	c

You	c
can	c
open	c
and	c
close	c
the	c
windows	c
and	c
switch	c
the	c
light	c
on	c
and	c
off	c
.	c

Your	c
freezer	c
tells	c
you	c
when	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
buy	c
some	c
milk	c
,	c
eggs	c
or	c
chees	i
.	c

Or	c
never	i
living	i
the	c
office	c
you	i
are	c
able	c
to	c
heat	c
the	c
wather	i
for	c
a	c
hot	c
bath	c
.	c

So	c
in	c
fact	c
people	c
's	c
home	i
became	i
more	c
confienence	i
and	c
comfortabler	i
.	c

But	c
the	c
form	c
and	c
the	c
rooms	c
of	c
a	c
building	c
will	c
still	c
be	c
the	c
same	c
.	c

And	c
of	c
course	c
the	c
furnitures	i
of	c
people	c
's	c
home	i
will	c
not	c
change	c
as	i
well	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
explain	c
to	c
you	c
the	c
problems	c
regarding	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
I	c
saw	c
at	c
your	c
theatre	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
there	i
was	c
written	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
show	c
,	i
that	c
there	i
would	i
be	i
Danny	i
Brook	i
as	i
main	i
actor	i
,	c
but	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
played	c
in	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

The	c
show	c
started	c
forty-five	c
minutes	c
later	i
and	c
this	c
really	c
disappointed	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
in	c
the	c
near	c
future	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

This	c
was	c
her	c
only	c
fault	c
.	c

She	c
was	c
given	c
a	c
chance	c
:	c
if	c
she	c
had	i
been	i
able	c
not	c
to	c
tell	c
everybody	c
a	c
secret	c
for	c
a	c
short	c
time	c
,	c
her	c
friends	c
would	c
have	i
started	i
trusting	c
her	c
.	c

But	c
,	c
as	c
the	c
days	c
went	c
by	c
,	c
she	c
was	c
surprised	c
because	c
she	c
realized	c
she	c
was	c
getting	c
used	i
not	c
to	i
tell	i
secrets	c
any	i
more	i
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c

My	c
name	c
is	c
Gabriel	c
and	c
I	c
represented	i
our	c
class	c
.	c

We	c
have	c
seen	c
an	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
and	c
we	c
would	c
particularly	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

As	c
representant	i
of	c
my	c
class	c
may	c
I	c
kindly	c
ask	c
you	c
to	c
change	i
partially	i
your	c
plan	c
during	i
our	c
visit	c
in	i
London	c
.	i

The	i
Monday	c
13	c
March	c
would	i
be	i
fine	i
.	c

The	c
last	c
day	c
,	c
the	i
Wednesday	c
15	c
March	c
will	i
surely	c
very	i
interesting	c
because	c
the	c
National	c
Art	c
Gallery	c
is	c
very	i
famous	c
place	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

The	c
sun	c
was	c
shining	c
,	c
the	c
Chanel	i
was	c
clear	c
blue	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
walking	c
by	c
the	c
Sea	i
.	c

Suddenly	c
I	c
heart	i
somebody	c
crying	c
for	c
the	i
help	c
.	c

Not	c
studying	i
for	i
too	i
much	i
I	c
ran	c
as	c
fast	c
as	c
I	c
could	c
direct	i
there	i
I	c
heart	i
the	c
voice	c
.	i

I	c
knew	c
,	i
I	c
ca	i
n't	i
swimm	i
then	i
I	c
realized	c
it	c
might	c
be	c
dangerous	c
for	c
me	c
as	c
well	c
.	c

But	c
in	i
this	c
particular	c
moment	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
important	c
for	i
me	c
.	c

The	c
most	c
important	c
things	i
was	c
a	c
little	c
boy	c
about	i
ten	c
years	c
old	c
,	c
who	c
was	c
in	c
the	c
watter	i
without	c
parents	i
and	c
could	c
n't	c
swimm	i
.	c

Although	i
I	c
went	c
quickly	c
to	c
him	c
and	c
took	c
him	c
on	i
my	c
hands	i
.	c

He	c
was	c
exhaused	i
and	c
could	c
n't	c
breath	i
.	c

In	c
the	c
meantime	c
a	c
man	c
told	c
me	c
he	c
were	i
a	c
doctor	c
and	c
could	c
help	c
the	c
boy	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
happy	c
that	c
I	c
managed	c
to	c
save	c
the	c
live	i
of	c
the	c
boy	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
the	c
person	c
who	c
won	c
your	c
competition	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
writing	c
in	c
reply	c
to	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
travel	c
only	c
in	c
july	i
because	c
that	c
is	c
the	c
only	c
time	c
when	c
I	c
am	c
free	c
from	c
my	c
examinations	c
.	c

I	c
prefer	c
staying	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
as	c
I	c
am	c
used	c
to	c
it	c
and	c
find	c
it	c
more	c
comfortable	c
.	c

The	c
two	c
activities	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
do	c
in	c
the	c
camp	c
are	c
swimming	c
and	c
photography	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
a	c
good	c
swimmer	c
and	c
I	c
had	i
some	c
expirience	i
in	c
photography	i
however	i
I	i
have	c
very	i
much	i
to	c
learn	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
got	c
two	c
questions	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
.	c

How	c
much	c
money	c
and	c
clothes	i
should	c
I	c
take	c
with	c
me	c
?	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
bits	c
from	c
the	c
whole	c
school	c
day	c
should	c
be	c
filmed	c
.	c

This	c
will	c
show	c
how	c
the	c
school	c
lives	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
morning	c
prefects	c
make	c
sure	c
that	c
everybody	c
is	c
awake	c
and	c
already	i
up	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
computing	c
department	c
student	i
learn	c
about	c
informational	i
technologies	c
.	c

The	c
main	c
job	c
of	c
the	c
head	c
of	c
the	c
computing	c
department	c
is	c
not	c
to	c
teach	c
but	c
to	c
keep	c
the	c
computers	c
working	c
properly	c
.	c

Maths	c
is	c
the	c
most	c
popular	c
subject	c
in	c
the	c
school	c
.	c

Mathematics	c
teachers	c
do	c
great	i
deal	c
of	c
work	c
and	c
have	c
almost	c
no	c
time	c
to	c
prepare	c
lessons	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
chemistry	c
lab	c
experiments	c
are	c
often	c
set	c
up	c
.	c

The	c
teacher	c
looks	c
after	c
the	c
pupil	i
while	c
they	c
are	c
investigating	c
the	c
topic	c
of	c
the	c
lesson	c
.	c

Kitchen	i
staff	c
works	c
hard	c
to	c
provide	c
students	c
with	c
variety	i
of	c
food	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
there	c
two	i
days	c
enjoying	c
it	c
and	c
have	c
found	c
some	c
points	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
change	c
to	c
make	c
it	c
a	c
better	c
one	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

Well	c
,	c
here	c
are	c
some	c
of	c
my	c
opinion	i
and	c
suggestions	c
.	c

Actually	c
,	c
the	c
price	c
of	c
the	c
weekend	c
ticket	c
was	c
excellent	c
!	c

Well	c
,	c
I	c
hope	c
you	c
found	c
my	c
suggestions	c
reasonable	c
as	c
I	c
deeply	c
congratulate	c
for	i
the	c
great	c
sucess	i
in	i
the	c
festival	c
.	c

Dear	c
Emily	c
,	c

In	c
our	c
school	c
,	c
you	c
're	c
not	c

At	c

there	c
are	c
less	i

My	c
parents	c
do	c
n't	c
really	c
like	c
putting	i
rules	c
in	c
the	c
house	c

But	c
still	c
I	c
cannot	c
go	c
out	c
of	c

telling	c
my	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
change	c
the	c
rule	c
not	i
to	i

most	c

comfortable	c
speaking	c
in	c
Spanish	c

I	c
guess	c
to	i
learn	c

we	c
should	c

Dear	c
Mrs.	c
Ryan	c
,	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
the	c
good	c
news	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
price	i
in	c
your	c
competition	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
delighted	c
and	c
already	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
spending	c
two	c
weeks	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
in	c
the	c
U.S.A.	c
.	i

As	c
regards	c
the	c
time	c
that	c
I	c
can	c
travel	c
I	i
must	c
tell	c
you	c
that	c
my	c
holidays	c
at	c
university	c
are	c
only	c
in	c
July	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
that	c
it	c
would	i
n't	i
be	c
a	c
problem	c
for	c
you	c
and	c
that	c
I	c
can	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
Camp	c
California	c
at	c
some	c
time	c
in	c
July	c
.	c

Then	i
you	c
asked	c
to	i
chose	i
two	c
activities	c
from	c
the	c
list	c
you	c
sent	c
to	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
do	c
surfing	c
and	c
photography	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
a	c
total	c
beginner	c
in	c
both	c
activities	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
these	c
two	c
weeks	c
will	c
be	c
a	c
good	c
opportunity	c
to	c
learn	c
something	c
about	c
them	c
.	c

Finally	c
I	i
have	i
also	i
some	c
questions	c
to	i
you	c
.	c

Firstly	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
will	c
be	c
appropriate	c
for	c
the	c
camp	c
,	c
secondly	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
should	c
take	c
with	c
me	c
for	c
the	c
two	c
weeks	c
and	c
lastly	c
if	c
there	c
are	c
any	c
possibilies	i
for	c
cooking	c
.	c

yours	i
sincerely	c
,	c

'	c
Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
'	c

If	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
go	c
shopping	c
again	c
,	c
because	c
the	c
fridge	c
is	c
empty	c
or	c
you	c
need	c
some	c
new	c
clothes	c
,	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
time	c
,	c
patience	c
and	c
straingth	i
are	c
needed	c
.	c

All	c
kinds	c
of	c
shopping	c
have	c
more	c
and	c
more	c
become	c
to	i
a	c
rather	i
stressful	i
activity	i
than	c
an	c
enjoyable	c
on	c
.	c

Leaving	c
the	c
car	c
at	c
home	c
is	c
also	c
not	c
a	c
good	c
ideas	i
you	i
often	c
buy	c
so	c
much	c
that	c
you	c
ca	c
n't	c
carry	c
it	c
in	c
plastic-bags	i
.	c

The	c
next	c
stressful	c
factor	c
begins	c
in	c
the	c
shop	c
:	i
Everywhere	c
people	c
who	c
are	c
in	c
a	c
hurry	c
and	i
push	c
you	c
from	c
one	c
side	c
to	c
the	c
other	c
.	c

Having	c
finally	c
decided	c
and	c
got	c
what	c
you	c
wanted	c
to	i
,	c
the	c
next	c
torture	c
comes	c
at	c
the	c
cash-desk	i
,	c
when	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
pay	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Clark	c
:	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
if	c
you	c
want	c
to	c
enjoy	c
music	c
you	c
must	c
be	c
comfortable	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
you	i
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c
.	c

Do	c
n't	c
you	c
?	c

The	c
other	c
day	c
I	c
arrived	c
five	c
minutes	c
late	c
and	c
the	c
teacher	c
ordered	c
me	c
to	c
go	c
home	c
.	c

She	c
might	c
be	c
crazy	c

they	i
let	c
me	c
go	c
out	c
with	c
my	c
friends	c
every	c
day	c
,	c
but	c
they	c
make	c
me	c
do	c
homework	c
and	c
I	c
hate	c
this	i
!	c
!	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
seeing	c
you	c
soon	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
;	i

I	c
am	c
writing	c
in	i
reference	c
to	c
the	c
programme	c
for	c
the	c
English	c
class	c
,	i
that	c
is	c
going	c
to	c
spend	c
three	c
days	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
already	c
read	c
the	c
programme	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
agree	i
with	i
that	i
,	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
the	c
class	c
will	c
like	c
going	c
to	i
Sightseeing	i
by	c
bus	c
and	c
in	c
the	c
afternoon	c
going	c
to	i
River	i
trip	c
to	c
Greenwich	c
,	i
Also	c
,	c
they	c
can	c
visit	c
Science	i
Museum	c
,	c
and	c
they	c
can	c
going	i
to	i
the	i
shopping	c
,	i
on	i
Wednesday	c
15	c
March	c
they	c
going	i
to	c
visit	c
The	i
National	c
Art	c
Gallery	c
,	c
really	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
is	c
good	i
programme	c
.	c

However	i
,	i
the	i
programme	c
could	c
be	c
changed	c
just	c
for	c
a	c
few	c
hours	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
for	c
everybody	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
hope	c
that	c
you	c
understand	c
my	c
personal	c
opinion	c
about	c
the	c
programme	c
,	c
I	c
will	c
understand	c
accept	i
you	i
personal	c
opinion	c
as	c
well	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
hearing	i
from	c
you	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
they	c
live	c
their	c
life	c
like	c
hat	i
,	c
because	c
they	c
want	c
to	c
live	c
this	c
life	c
.	c

They	c
doing	i
everything	c
just	c
for	c
money	c
,	c
sometimes	i
,	i
they	c
can	c
make	c
theirs	i
life	c
easier	c
than	c
they	i
normally	i
do	i
.	c

It	c
is	c
true	c
,	c
they	c
deserve	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
private	c
life	c
without	c
journalist	i
following	c
them	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
,	c
however	c
this	c
news	i
give	i
them	c
money	c
,	c
and	c
confortable	i
life	c
.	c

They	c
can	c
travel	c
around	c
the	c
world	c
,	c
buy	c
everything	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
good	c
life	c
,	c
but	c
at	c
the	c
same	c
time	c
,	c
they	c
must	c
be	c
a	i
very	c
good	c
peaple	i
,	c
because	c
"	c
the	i
Famous	i
"	c
is	c
just	c
for	c
a	c
few	i
time	c
,	c
nothing	c
is	i
forever	c
in	c
this	c
world	c
.	c

I	c
do	i
not	c
really	c
like	c
will	i
be	i
a	c
famous	c
person	c
,	c
because	c
you	c
are	c
not	c
really	c
yourselfh	i
,	c
and	c
for	c
me	c
is	i
the	c
more	i
important	c
thing	c
.	c

Your	i
faithfully	i

To	c
the	c
manager	c
of	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c

I	c
am	c
PINAR	c
xxx.	c
One	c
week	c
ago	c
I	c
watched	c
your	c
show	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
so	i
disappointed	c
because	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
find	c
what	c
I	c
expect	i
at	c
your	c
show	c
.	c

You	c
wrote	c
that	i
"	c
visit	c
our	c
restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
"	c
so	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
eat	c
my	c
supper	c
,	c
to	c
eat	c
at	c
your	c
restaurant	c
.	i

but	c
the	c
reastaurant	i
was	c
closed	c
because	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
20:15	i
and	c
finissed	i
at	c
00.15	c
and	c
the	c
restaurant	c
was	c
opened	i
until	c
00.00	c
.	c

After	c
all	c
this	i
problems	c
I	c
became	c
dissappointed	i
.	c

If	c
you	c
would	i
give	c
me	c
some	c
of	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
that	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
great	c
excuse	i
for	c
the	c
loss	i
of	c
time	c
and	c
my	c
dissopointness	i
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

I	c
know	i
that	c
before	c
but	c
I	c
thought	c
that	c
he	c
may	i
change	i
.	c

It	c
was	c
about	c
Marine	c
,	c
who	c
was	c
our	c
clase	i
friends	i
.	c

The	c
reality	c
was	c
Marine	i
's	c
parents	c
are	i
not	c
her	c
real	c
parents	c
,	c
they	c
found	c
her	c
in	c
their	c
houses	i
garden	c
.	c

They	c
try	i
so	c
many	c
things	c
to	c
find	c
her	c
family	i
for	i
one	i
year	c
they	c
did	c
everything	c
to	c
find	c
her	c
family	c
but	c
they	c
could	c
n't	c
find	c
.	i

In	c
this	c
one	c
year	c
they	c
spend	i
most	c
of	c
their	c
time	c
with	c
Marine	c
and	c
they	c
loved	c
her	c
so	c
much	c
and	c
they	c
want	i
to	c
be	c
her	c
parents	c
.	c

When	c
Marine	c
was	c
three	c
years	c
old	c
a	c
man	c
came	c
to	c
their	c
house	c
and	c
sad	i
that	c
he	c
is	i
Marine	c
's	c
father	c
and	c
wont	i
to	c
take	c
her	c
.	i

and	c
he	c
added	c
that	c
he	c
leave	i
Marine	c
because	c
her	c
mother	c
was	i
dead	i
two	c
days	c
after	c
Marine	c
's	c
birth	c
.	i

and	c
the	c
police	c
thought	c
Marine	c
's	c
father	c
did	c
this	c
so	c
they	c
put	c
him	c
on	i
prison	i
he	i
had	c
nobody	c
that	c
he	c
can	i
give	c
marry	i
so	i
he	c
leave	i
her	c
on	i
their	c
garden	c
.	c

The	i
Marine	c
's	c
real	c
father	c
want	i
her	c
back	c
but	c
the	c
other	c
cuples	i
did	c
n't	c
want	c
to	c
give	c
her	c
because	i
they	c
loved	c
Marine	c
so	c
much	c
.	c

After	c
I	c
told	c
the	i
reality	i
the	i
Pat	i
.	i

Marine	c
said	c
to	c
Pat	c
that	i
"	c
I	c
had	i
knowed	i
that	c
because	c
I	c
talked	i
with	i
my	c
real	c
father	c
every	c
month	c
but	c
my	c
parents	c
does	i
n't	i
know	c
that	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
waiting	c
for	c
them	c
to	c
say	i
me	c
the	c
reality	i
"	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
greatful	i
to	c
hearing	i
about	i
I	c
have	c
won	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
competition	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
join	c
the	c
camp	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
I	c
could	i
get	c
holiday	i
from	c
my	c
company	c
from	c
1th	c
July	c
to	c
28th	c
July	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c

In	i

I	c
've	c
never	c
tried	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
tents	c
during	c

That	c
's	c
why	c
I	c

It	c
could	c
be	c

SUGGESTION	c

They	c
are	c
having	c
special	i
time	c

Every	c
Friday	c
,	c
they	c
enjoy	c
a	c
special	c
game	c
for	i
check	i
vocabulary	c

And	c
they	c
are	i
always	i
doing	i
best	i
their	i
homeworks	i

I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
to	c
see	c
a	c
musical	c
show	c
"	i
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
"	c
and	i
had	c
a	c
very	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
.	c

According	c
to	c
your	c
advertisement	c
,	c
the	c
actor	c
should	c
be	i
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
but	c
infact	i
it	c
was	c
different	i
person	c
.	c

My	c
ticket	c
was	c
for	c
19.30	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
started	c
very	c
late	c
,	i
it	i
started	c
20:15	i
.	c

When	c
the	c
show	c
finished	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
too	c
late	c
to	c
catch	c
the	c
train	c
to	i
home	c
.	c

"	c
What	c
a	c
waste	c
!	c
,	c
,	c
By	c
the	c
way	c
,	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
see	c
any	c
discounts	c
for	i
buying	i
tickets	c
.	c

One	c
more	c
thing	c
,	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
when	c
I	c
get	i
there	c
for	c
a	c
glass	i
of	i
drink	c
,	i
I	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
why	c
,	i
there	i
was	c
no	c
written	i
notes	i
or	c
information	c
about	c
that	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
not	c
sure	c
that	c
I	c
did	c
have	c
a	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
.	c

If	c
the	i
refund	c
is	c
available	c
,	c
it	i
would	c
be	c
grateful	i

She	c
works	c

We	c
get	c
on	c
very	c
well	c

She	c

She	c
always	c
talks	c
about	c
her	c

life	c
to	c
me	c

and	c
I	c
thought	c
we	c
understood	c
each	c
other	c

because	c
when	c
I	c
talked	c
about	c
my	c
private	c
life	c
to	c
her	c
,	c
she	c
seemed	c
very	c
understandable	i
.	c

I	c
told	c
her	c
the	c
reason	c
that	i
I	c
had	c
to	c
miss	c
the	i
work	c
.	c

My	c
son	c
was	c
in	c
prison	c
.	c

All	c
I	c
know	c
is	c
about	i
drug	c
smuggling	c
,	c
that	i
he	c
involved	i
.	c

Yesterday	c
morning	c
,	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
toilet	i
,	i
I	c
overherd	i
two	c
people	c
talking	c
about	c
my	c
son	c
I	i
felt	c
pity	i
on	i
myself	c
and	c
I	c
burst	c
into	c
tears	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
remember	c
how	c
I	c
finished	c
work	c
that	c
day	c
.	c

Nowadays	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
hard	c
to	c
trust	c
people	c
.	c

No	c
one	c
is	c
perfect	c
.	c

Everybody	c
make	i
mistakes	c
.	c

I	c
went	c
in	i
London	c
for	c
a	c
week	c
of	c
"	c
pure	c
holiday	c
"	c
thinking	i
to	i
have	i
some	c
fun	c
coming	i
to	c
see	c
your	c
musical	c
show	c
.	c

On	i
the	c
advertisement	c
it	c
had	i
been	i
written	c
that	c
there	i
would	i
have	i
been	i
Danny	i
Brook	i
too	c
.	c

(	c
I	c
like	c
him	c
very	c
much	c
and	c
,	c
truly	i
,	c
I	c
came	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
just	c
to	c
see	c
him	c
)	c

The	c
show	c
had	i
to	i
started	i
at	c
19:30	c
and	c
I	c
arrived	c
before	i
,	c
frightened	c
not	i
to	i
find	i
a	c
good	c
place	c
to	c
see	c
"	c
my	c
hero	c
"	c
.	c

I	c
have	i
waited	i
for	c
the	c
show	c
beginning	i
until	c
20:15	c
!	c
!	c
!	c
!	c

Is	i
it	i
a	i
correct	i
thing	i
?	c

I	c
was	c
getting	c
angry	c
,	c
but	c
,	c
finally	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
and	c
I	c
became	c
quiter	i
.	c

BUT.	c
.	c

when	c
I	c
saw	c
that	c
the	c
actor	c
was	c
n't	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
but	c
a	c
different	c
one	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
disappointed	c
.	c

At	i
the	c
end	c
,	c
I	c
asked	c
for	c
money	i
back	c
(	c
and	c
paiment	i
for	c
my	c
orrible	i
night	c
)	c
:	c
do	c
you	c
think	c
anybody	c
give	i
me	c
back	i
something	i
?	c
!	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
attention	c
.	c

Faithfully	c

Science	c
and	c
technology	c
characterize	c
our	c
moder	i
society	c
.	c

They	c
have	c
taken	i
a	i
big	c
progress	c
in	c
our	c
every	i
day	i
life	c
and	c
they	c
have	i
always	i
become	i
more	c
important	c
for	c
us	c
.	c

Walking	c
on	c
a	c
city	c
street	c
,	c
it	c
's	c
difficult	c
to	c
find	c
parks	c
or	c
"	c
green	c
"	c
places	c
with	c
trees	c
and	c
clean	c
air	c
:	c
actually	c
pollution	c
,	c
traffic	c
and	c
noize	i
are	c
the	c
main	c
problems	c
of	c
our	c
society	c
.	c

But	c
,	c
sometimes	c
I	c
ask	c
myself	c
if	c
the	c
"	c
ancient	c
world	c
"	c
,	c
without	c
science	c
,	c
technological	c
discoveries	i
and	c
industries	c
was	c
more	c
authentic	c
than	c
the	i
our	c
one	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
concerning	c
our	i
three	c
days	c
which	c
we	c
are	c
going	c
to	c
spend	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
the	c
programme	c
which	c
you	c
have	c
organised	c
for	c
our	c
English	c
class	c
.	c

We	c
have	c
seen	c
an	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
and	c
we	c
all	i
would	i
like	c
to	c
go	c
there	c
.	c

It	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
for	c
us	c
,	c
because	c
we	c
are	c
all	c
interested	c
in	c
fashion	c
particularly	i
in	c
sports	i
wear	i
.	c

The	i
entry	i
for	c
students	c
is	c
free	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
suggest	c
to	i
visit	i
the	c
Science	c
Museum	c
,	c
which	c
was	i
planned	i
for	i
Tuesday	c
,	c
on	c
Wednesday	c
afternoon	c
.	c

And	c
if	c
there	c
is	c
anybody	c
who	c
wants	c
to	c
go	c
shopping	c
,	c
he	c
would	i
be	c
able	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
on	c
Wednesday	c
evening	c
.	c

We	c
are	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
dangerous	c
but	c
I	c
knew	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
.	c

For	c
just	c
one	c
day	c
in	c
my	c
summer	c
holidays	c
I	c
planned	c
to	c
do	c
something	c
adventurous	c
.	c

The	c
moment	c
I	c
saw	c
the	c
advertisement	c
about	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
seven	i
world	i
wonders	i
,	c
I	c
knew	c
,	i
I	c
had	c
to	c
see	c
it	c
.	c

But	c
this	c
was	c
also	c
the	c
moment	c
when	c
my	c
nightmare	c
started	c
to	c
come	c
alive	i
.	c

My	c
friend	c
and	c
I	c
had	c
just	c
arrived	c
at	c
a	c
small	c
airport	c
in	c
the	c
middle	c
of	c
the	c
Californian	c
desert	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
our	c
pilot	c
.	c

He	c
introduced	c
himself	c
and	c
we	c
walked	c
towards	c
a	c
small	c
plane	c
.	c

We	c
went	c
inside	c
and	c
the	c
plane	c
took	c
off	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
horrible	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
feel	c
every	c
movement	c
which	c
was	c
caused	c
by	c
clowds	i
or	c
winds	i
.	c

I	c
thought	c
we	c
would	c
die	c
.	c

But	c
then	c
,	c
finally	c
,	c
we	c
reached	c
the	c
Grand	c
Canyon	c
.	c

We	c
were	c
so	c
near	c
that	c
,	c
I	c
thought	c
I	c
could	c
touch	c
the	c
sides	c
of	c
the	c
Grand	c
Canyon	c
by	c
reaching	c
out	c
of	c
the	c
planes	i
window	c
.	c

I	c
swore	c
to	c
myself	c
,	i
I	c
would	c
never	c
ever	c
take	i
a	c
plane	c
like	c
this	c
again	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
too	c
dangerous	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
knew	c
deep	c
inside	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
see	c
it	c
.	c

As	c
I	c
'm	c
an	c
artist	i
student	c
in	i
a	c
particular	c
College	c
,	c
I	c
only	i
can	i
go	c
to	c
your	i
Camp	c
California	c
in	c
July	c
,	c
because	c
in	c
this	i
month	c
I	c
got	i
no	i
class	i
,	c
and	c
I	c
'm	c
free	c
to	c
do	c
whatever	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
.	c

I	c
'd	c
like	c
log	i
cabins	i
as	i
my	c
accomodation	i
,	c
because	c
it	c
's	c
safer	c
and	c
cleaner	c
than	c
tents	i
and	c
I	c
would	c
n't	c
share	c
it	c
to	i
anyone	c
.	c

They	c
fit	i
to	i
myself	i
because	c
my	c
art	c
work	c
develops	c
itself	i
in	c
these	c
areas	c
.	c

So	c
in	i
Camp	c
California	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
keep	c
me	i
on	i
touching	i
to	i
these	c
areas	c
.	c

I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
to	c
send	c
me	c
$	c
1000	c
for	c
my	c
art	c
knowledge	c
.	c

With	c
this	c
amount	c
I	c
could	c
buy	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
art	c
books	c
,	c
and	c
records	c
.	c

We	c
can	c
analize	i
when	c
shopping	c
is	c
enjoyable	c
,	c
when	i
it	c
is	c
not	c
.	c

There	c
is	c
joy	c
in	c
shopping	c
when	c
it	c
is	c
made	i
by	c
ourselves	c
to	i
ourselves	c
.	c

It	i
means	c
buying	c
whatever	c
we	c
like	c
,	c
just	i
like	c
clothes	c
,	c
records	c
,	c
rings	c
,	c
and	c
books	c
.	c

What	c
we	c
like	c
is	c
based	c
in	i
our	c
relationship	i
to	i
another	i
people	c
,	c
in	i
the	i
work	c
or	c
in	c
the	c
family	c
.	c

So	c
we	c
have	c
enjoyable	i
when	c
we	c
buy	c
what	c
we	c
like	c
following	i
another	i
people	c
's	c
views	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
an	c
obligation	c
shopping	i
medicines	i
,	c
clothes	c
to	i
winter	c
,	c
doctor	i
visites	i
,	c
and	c
so	c
forth	c
.	c

A	c
death	c
in	c
the	c
family	c
is	c
not	i
also	i
an	c
enjoyable	c
shopping	c
experience	c
,	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
the	i
highest	i
point	i
of	i
the	i
sickness	i
.	c

In	c
summarizing	i
shopping	c
can	c
be	c
enjoyable	c
or	c
not	c
depending	c
of	i
our	c
healthy	i
state	i
.	c

Giving	i
examples	c
:	c
we	i
are	c
healthy	c
we	c
buy	c
clothes	c
and	c
Records	c
,	c
we	c
enjoy	c
ourselves	c
;	c
we	i
are	c
sick	c
,	c
or	c
our	c
relatives	c
,	i
we	c
buy	c
medicines	c
we	i
not	i
enjoy	c
ourselves	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
an	c
obligation	c
.	c

Dear	c
Ms	c
Clark	c
,	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
organising	c
this	c
event	c
was	c
a	c
great	c
idea	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
pleased	c
when	c
I	c
read	c
your	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
festival	c
.	c

It	c
encouraged	c
me	c
to	c
take	c
part	c
in	c
the	c
festival	c
.	c

Apparently	c
there	c
were	c
artists	c
from	c
only	c
six	c
countries	c
.	c

All	c
the	c
concerts	c
were	c
great	c
,	c
but	c
some	c
concert	c
halls	c
were	c
too	c
small	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
also	c
like	c
to	c
suggest	c
you	i
to	i
try	i
and	c
make	c
more	c
plays	c
and	c
films	c
available	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

Thanks	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
sorry	c
for	c
not	c
having	c
written	c
earlier	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
've	c
had	c
an	c
exhausting	c
exam	c
session	c
at	c
school	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
very	c
interesting	c
to	c
hear	c
about	c
rules	i
in	c
England	c
.	c

The	c
rules	c
in	c
Poland	c
are	c
quite	c
similar	c
to	c
those	c
discribed	i
in	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

In	c
most	c
of	c
the	c
schools	c
students	c
have	c
to	c
change	c
their	c
shoes	c
in	c
order	c
not	c
to	c
make	c
the	c
floor	c
dirty	c
.	c

What	c
about	c
home	i
rules	c
?	c

All	c
the	c
things	c
we	c
're	c
not	c
allowed	c
to	c
do	c
depend	c
on	c
them	c
.	c

Anyway	c
,	c
I	c
must	c
finish	c
now	c
.	c

Lots	c
of	c
love	c
,	c

You	c

Industrial	i

faster	i
and	i
faster	i

They	i
got	c
more	i
differet	i
functions	c

It	c
is	c
very	c
intresting	i
for	c
me	c
how	i
new	i

My	c

a	c
good	c
way	c
to	c

And	c
I	c

Communication	i

very	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

I	c
'm	c
very	c
happy	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
.	c

I	c
can	c
travel	c
only	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
I	c
have	i
holidays	i
from	i
my	i
work	i
only	i
in	c
this	c
month	c
.	c

Singing	i
because	c
it	c
's	c
my	c
favourite	c
hobby	c
and	c
I	c
grew	c
up	c
with	c
it	c
and	c
Swimming	i
because	c
I	c
like	c
water	c
and	c
the	c
feeling	c
that	c
you	c
have	c
when	c
you	c
are	c
in	c
it	c
.	c

Everybody	c
likes	c
shopping	c
!	c

But	c
shopping	c
is	c
n't	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

Sometimes	c
it	c
is	c
n't	c
so	c
easy	c
to	c
find	c
what	c
you	c
need	c
.	c

Now	c
you	c
will	i
by	i
it	c
but	c
it	c
's	c
nowhere	c
to	c
find	i
!	c

That	c
's	c
a	c
pity	c
!	c

Sometimes	c
it	c
's	c
very	i
awful	c
when	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
wait	c
very	i
long	c
until	i
it	c
's	c
your	c
turn	c
to	c
pay	c
or	c
to	c
try	c
some	c
clothes	c
on	c
.	c

Another	c
thing	c
that	c
makes	c
you	c
fourious	i
,	i
is	c
when	c
you	c
see	c
a	c
great	c
shirt	c
in	c
shop	i
and	c
somebody	c
else	c
take	i
it	c
away	c
or	c
buy	i
it	c
before	c
you	c
can	c
react	c
.	c

That	i
things	c
had	i
happend	i
to	c
everybody	c
,	c
had	i
n't	i
they	c
?	c

Dear	c
Jane	c
Clark	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
about	c
an	c
annual	c
international	c
arts	c
festival	c
with	c
a	c
good	c
impression	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
spent	c
two	c
days	c
on	c
it	c
which	c
was	c
exciting	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
make	c
a	c
suggestion	c
that	c
you	c
could	c
consider	c
for	c
it	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
there	i
were	i
some	c
concert	c
halls	c
were	c
too	c
small	c
.	c

Quite	c
few	c
seats	c
were	c
available	c
for	c
audience	i
,	c
so	c
a	c
few	c
people	c
had	c
to	c
stand	c
and	c
watch	c
concerts	i
.	c

I	c
see	c
you	c
might	c
not	c
have	c
had	c
much	c
time	c
to	c
be	c
well-organised	c
.	c

As	c
well	c
as	c
that	c
,	c
I	i
expect	i
you	i
plays	i
and	i
films	i
are	i
performed	i
more	i
.	c

It	c
is	c
a	i
excellent	c
price	c
because	c
when	c
I	c
am	c
tempt	i
to	c
watch	c
some	c
festivals	c
,	c
obviously	c
it	c
costs	c
much	c
more	c
money	c
.	c

I	c
expect	c
you	c
can	i
be	c
organised	i
even	i
better	i
next	c
year	c
.	c

Dear	c
George	c
,	c

But	c
it	c
is	c
quite	c
different	c
rather	c
than	c
you	c
.	c

Becoming	c
more	c
strict	c
gradually	c
at	c
home	c
that	c
at	c
school	c
is	c
true	c
as	c
you	c
said	c
.	c

Nowadays	c
while	c
my	c
country	c
is	c
developing	c
,	c
most	c
people	c
are	c
very	c
busy	c
,	c
so	c
they	c
ca	c
n't	c
bring	c
up	c
their	c
children	c
.	c

I	i
think	i
the	i
rule	i
of	i
school	i
has	i
many	i
thing	i
stoping	i
students	i
doing	i
.	i

But	c
people	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
change	c
life	i
style	i
in	c
their	c
house	c
because	c
there	c
have	i
n't	i
been	i
convenient	c
appliaces	i
in	c
their	c
house	i
yet	c
.	c

Looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Yours	c

Dear	c
Madam/Sir	c
,	c

I	c
recentely	i
had	c
a	c
week	c
's	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
,	c
and	c
during	i
my	c
stay	c
,	c
I	c
went	c
in	i
your	c
theatre	c
to	c
see	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
because	c
I	c
have	i
seen	c
an	c
advertisement	c
about	i
this	c
show	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
really	c
interrested	i
to	i
see	i
it	c
for	c
many	c
reasons	c
,	c
one	c
of	c
this	i
reasons	c
it	i
is	c
that	c
I	c
love	c
the	c
starring	i
Danny	i
Brook	c
.	c

And	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
that	i
you	c
know	i
that	c
I	c
have	c
had	c
a	c
very	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
,	c
due	c
to	c
the	c
differences	c
between	c
the	c
advertisement	c
and	c
the	c
show	c
that	c
I	c
saw	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
the	c
actor	c
was	c
not	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
in	c
your	c
advertisement	c
the	c
time	c
of	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
19:30	c
and	c
in	c
reallity	i
the	c
show	c
has	i
started	i
at	c
20:15	c
and	c
the	c
discount	c
was	c
not	c
available	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
very	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
and	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
very	c
kind	c
of	c
you	c
if	c
you	c
give	i
me	c
back	c
the	c
money	c
.	i

I'am	i
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hear	i
you	i
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c
.	c

Your	i
faithfully	c
,	c

For	c
example	c
20	i
years	c
ago	c
,	c
people	c
who	c
were	c
affected	c
by	c
the	c
AIDS	c
Virus	c
could	c
n't	c
live	c
more	c
than	c
two	c
or	c
three	c
years	c
,	c
but	c
now	c
with	c
the	c
new	c
science	c
,	c
there	c
is	i
several	c
therapi	i
and	c
now	c
people	c
affected	c
by	c
this	c
virus	c
can	c
live	c
many	c
years	c
.	c

You	c
can	c
travel	c
around	c
the	c
world	c
by	c
train	c
,	c
by	c
plane	c
or	c
by	c
ship	c
and	c
maybe	c
one	c
day	c
you	c
can	c
fly	c
by	c
car	c
.	c

Why	c
not	c
.	i

I	c
hope	c
that	c
you	c
will	c
find	c
this	c
composition	c
interesting	c

Organizer	c
of	c
International	i
Arts	c
Festival	c

Mine	i
name	c
is	c
John	c
and	c
I	c
have	i
been	i
in	i
the	c
latest	c
International	c
Arts	c
Festival	c
.	c

The	c
purpose	c
of	c
this	c
letter	c
is	c
just	c
to	c
let	c
you	c
know	c
my	c
opinion	c
of	c
the	c
event	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
thinking	c
about	c
changing	c
the	c
location	c
because	c
,	c
as	c
you	c
probably	c
already	c
know	c
,	c
some	c
concert	c
halls	c
were	c
not	c
big	c
enough	c
to	c
let	c
everybody	c
who	c
wanted	c
go	i
in	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
just	i
would	i
like	c
to	c
recommend	i
you	c
not	c
to	c
give	c
up	c
showing	c
movies	c
,	i
during	c
the	c
Festival	i
because	c
the	c
crowds	c
were	c
amazed	i
with	c
that	i
,	c
and	c
keep	c
on	c
offering	c
the	c
current	c
prices	c
,	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
best	c
deal	i
for	c
us	c
,	c
the	c
spectators	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
talk	c
about	c
my	c
suggestions	c
,	c
please	c
,	c
do	c
not	c
hesitate	c
and	i
let	c
me	c
know	c

Independent	c
Student	c
Magazine	c

Here	c
is	c
my	c
article	c
.	c

There	c
are	c
many	c
ways	c
to	c
earn	c
money	c
,	c
specially	i
in	c
a	c
big	c
city	c
,	c
like	c
the	c
one	c
where	c
we	c
are	c
studing	i
all	c
year	c
around	c
.	c

Some	c
examples	c
could	c
be	c
delivering	c
pizzas	c
or	c
newspapers	c
,	c
working	c
as	c
a	c
bartender	c
throug	i
the	i
nights	i
,	c
cleaning	c
services	c
,	c
etc.	c
I	c
usually	c
call	c
these	c
jobs	c
non-	i
cualified	i
positions	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
,	c
as	i
a	i
consecuence	i
,	c
that	c
there	c
is	c
no	c
difficulty	c
in	c
finding	c
a	c
job	c
for	c
our	c
spare	c
time	c
.	c

What	c
it	i
really	c
makes	c
us	c
,	c
the	c
students	c
,	c
upset	c
,	c
is	c
to	i
find	i
the	c
perfect	c
job	c
.	c

To	c
be	c
more	c
technically	i
and	c
specifically	i
,	c
we	c
need	c
a	c
very	c
flexible	c
job	c
,	c
wich	i
gives	c
independence	i
and	c
allow	i
us	c
to	c
stop	c
working	c
when	c
we	c
are	c
not	c
able	c
to	c
,	c
for	c
example	c
during	c
the	c
exams	c
period	c
.	c

And	c
by	c
that	c
time	c
I	c
will	c
have	i
already	i
some	c
experience	c
,	c
so	c
that	c
I	c
will	c
more	i
easily	i
able	i
to	i
apply	i
for	c
a	c
really	c
good	c
job	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
Why	i
do	c
n't	c
we	c
think	c
more	c
about	c
the	c
future	c
,	c
instead	c
of	c
being	c
upset	c
of	i
how	c
to	c
get	c
some	c
money	c
to	c
spend	i
next	i
party	c
?	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Manager	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
disappointed	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
quarter	i
of	c
an	c
hour	c
late	c
.	c

If	c
I	c
knew	i
that	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
late	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
ask	i
my	c
mom	c
to	c
come	c
with	c
me	c
,	c
because	c
her	c
working	c
hour	i
ended	c
at	c
eight	c
o'clock	c
.	c

The	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
ended	c
.	c

As	c
a	c
result	c
Mallory	c
had	c
been	c
arrested	c
by	c
the	c
police	c
two	c
years	c
ago	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
he	c
had	c
to	c
serve	c
a	c
life	c
sentences	i
.	c

Mallory	c
and	c
his	c
partner	c
,	c
Pat	c
had	i
planned	i
the	c
best	c
plan	c
in	c
the	c
world	c
,	c
which	c
was	c
to	c
steal	c
the	c
diamond	c
from	c
the	c
national	c
bank	c
.	c

So	c
they	c
could	c
take	c
their	c
time	c
,	c
rather	c
than	c
going	c
in	c
at	i
the	c
front	c
door	c
.	c

As	c
soon	c
as	c
Mallory	c
stole	c
the	c
diamond	c
.	c

By	c
the	c
time	c
he	c
got	c
out	c
of	c
the	c
building	c
,	c
the	c
cops	c
was	i
ever	i
where	i
but	c
as	c
long	c
as	c
Mallory	c
is	c
alive	c
,	c
he	c
wo	c
n't	c
be	c
arrested	c
,	c
with	c
his	c
unpredicatable	i
mind	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
your	c
show	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
"	c
and	c
the	c
conditions	c
in	c
which	c
it	c
is	c
held	i
.	c

I	c
was	c
having	c
a	c
week	c
's	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
when	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
and	c
see	c
a	c
musical	c
show	i
.	c

Moreover	c
an	c
English	c
friend	c
of	c
mine	c
had	c
told	c
me	c
that	c
it	c
would	c
purely	i
be	c
a	c
good	c
show	c
as	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
was	c
a	c
very	c
good	c
actor	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
there	c
were	c
no	c
discounts	c
available	c
as	i
stated	i
in	c
your	c
advertisement	c
,	c
not	c
even	c
for	c
students	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
pay	c
for	c
a	c
full-price	c
ticket	c
.	c

At	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
have	c
dinner	c
in	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
and	c
I	c
went	c
there	c
.	c

..just	i
to	c
find	c
out	i
that	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
being	c
newly	i
painted	i
.	c

So	c
I	c
am	c
asking	c
you	c
to	c
pay	c
me	c
back	c
at	c
least	c
half	c
of	c
the	c
ticket	c
price	c
for	c
the	c
inconvenience	c
that	c
was	c
caused	c
to	i
me	c
.	c

That	c
's	c
what	c
I	c
learned	c
from	c
my	c
own	c
experience	c
.	c

At	c
that	c
time	c
,	c
I	c
used	c
to	c
buy	c
a	c
lotery	i
ticket	c
once	c
a	c
week	c
and	c
I	c
sometimes	c
won	c
small	c
amounts	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
was	c
too	c
excited	c
to	c
keep	c
it	c
secret	c
so	c
I	c
told	c
Pat	c
that	c
I	c
had	c
won	c
a	c
prize	c
for	c
five	c
correct	c
numbers	c
and	c
had	c
her	c
swear	c
not	c
to	c
tell	c
anyone	c
.	c

But	c
soon	c
everyone	c
in	c
the	c
class	c
was	c
looking	c
at	c
me	c
smillingly	i
and	c
I	c
find	i
out	c
that	c
I	c
had	c
many	c
unsuspected	c
friends	c
...	c

Endly	i
came	i
the	i
end	i
of	i
the	i
week	i
and	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
lotery	i
office	c
to	c
check	i
the	c
amount	c
I	c
had	c
won	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
disappointed	c
to	c
learn	c
that	c
I	c
'd	c
only	c
won	c
three	c
hundred	c
francs	c
for	i
many	i
people	c
had	c
found	i
five	c
numbers	c
like	c
me	c
.	c

SO	c
I	c
told	c
my	c
friend	c
Pat	c
how	c
much	c
I	c
had	c
won	c
and	c
the	c
following	c
day	c
at	c
school	c
,	i
everybody	c
were	i
just	c
the	c
same	c
as	c
they	c
ever	c
were	c
with	c
me	c
...	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
Margherita	c
X	c
from	c
the	i
class	c
3C	c
,	c
which	i
is	i
going	c
to	c
spend	c
three	c
days	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

We	c
had	c
the	c
opportunity	c
to	c
read	c
your	c
programme	c
and	c
we	c
are	c
happy	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
very	c
good	i
organized	c
.	c

We	c
especially	c
like	c
the	i
National	c
Art	c
gallery	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
.	c

They	c
gona	i
show	i
a	i
latest	c
fashion	i
,	c
leisure	c
and	c
sports	c
wear	c
,	c
make	i
up	i
and	c
new	c
hairstyles	c
.	c

We	c
all	c
think	c
that	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
good	c
opportunity	c
to	c
see	c
this	c
show	c
.	c

I	c
really	c
hope	c
that	c
you	c
gona	i
consider	i
our	c
request	c
.	c

My	c
dear	c
brother	c

It	c
was	c
dangerous	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
knew	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
doing	c
my	c
homeworks	i
when	c
I	c
heard	c
an	c
explosion	c
.	c

I	c
came	c
out	c
of	c
my	c
room	c
and	c
I	c
saw	c
my	c
brother	c
n	i
fire	c
.	c

He	c
was	c
playing	c
with	c
fire	c
and	c
alcohol	c
in	c
the	c
bathroom	c
.	c

My	c
first	c
reaction	c
was	c
to	c
put	i
him	c
on	c
the	c
floor	c
so	c
that	c
the	c
fire	c
could	c
stop	i
.	c

We	c
were	c
shocked	c
,	i
we	i
all	i
did	i
n't	i
know	i
what	c
to	c
do	c
.	c

I	c
called	c
a	c
taxi	c
because	c
my	c
father	c
was	c
n't	c
able	c
to	c
drive	c
.	c

He	c
had	c
to	c
stay	c
there	c
for	c
three	c
long	c
weeks	c
.	c

I	c
really	c
like	i
my	c
brother	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
do	c
anything	c
possible	c
to	c
save	c
him	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
,	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
your	c
programme	c
,	c
it	i
's	i
sounds	c
very	c
interesting	c
and	c
everybody	c
is	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
it	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
we	c
do	c
all	c
have	c
a	c
request	c
to	c
ask	i
you	c
.	c

This	c
show	c
is	c
going	c
on	c
all	c
day	c
on	c
March	c
14th	c
.	c

As	c
teenagers	c
we	c
're	c
all	c
very	c
keen	c
on	c
fashion	c
so	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
to	c
go	c
because	c
in	c
our	c
countryside	i
,	c
we	c
'll	c
never	c
get	c
a	c
chance	c
to	c
see	c
a	c
show	c
like	c
that	c
.	c

What	c
we	c
are	c
suggesting	c
you	i
is	c
to	c
change	c
the	c
programme	c
on	c
the	c
afternoon	c
of	c
March	c
the	c
14th	c
.	c

Instead	c
of	c
going	c
shopping	c
,	c
we	c
could	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

Anyway	c
,	c
as	c
students	c
we	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
much	c
money	c
to	c
spend	c
on	c
shopping	c
and	c
the	c
good	c
thing	c
is	c
that	c
it	c
wo	c
n't	c
affect	c
your	c
budget	c
at	c
all	c
as	c
the	c
entrance	c
fees	c
are	c
free	c
for	c
students	c
.	c

Why	i
medias	i
are	i
so	c
interesting	i
in	c
famous	c
people	c
?	c

Because	c
of	c
us	c
!	c

I	c
know	c
that	c
everyone	c
is	c
excited	c
about	c
what	c
happened	c
to	i
Michael	c
Douglas	c
'	c
wedding	c
or	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
life	c
the	c
President	c
of	c
The	i
United	c
States	c
is	c
living	c
but	c
sometimes	c
it	c
's	c
going	c
a	c
bit	c
to	i
far	c
.	c

Those	c
movie	c
stars	c
or	c
politicians	c
may	c
have	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
money	c
,	c
may	c
do	c
whatever	c
they	c
want	c
but	c
what	c
is	c
the	c
price	c
to	c
pay	c
?	c

Would	c
you	c
like	c
to	c
live	c
a	c
life	c
like	c
that	c
,	c
every	c
time	c
you	c
make	c
a	c
wrong	c
step	c
,	c
the	c
whole	c
world	c
is	c
looking	c
at	c
you	c
,	c
judging	c
you	c
.	i

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
it	i
should	c
be	c
a	c
rule	c
which	c
let	i
the	c
medias	i
approach	c
famous	c
people	c
almost	c
anywhere	c
except	c
in	c
their	c
private	c
home	c
to	c
leave	c
them	c
at	c
least	c
one	c
place	c
to	c
feel	c
safe	c

Last	c
Saturday	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
your	c
theatre	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
new	c
musical	c
show	c
;	i
"	c
Over	c
The	c
Rainbow	c
"	c

It	c
was	c
writing	i
on	i
the	c
advertisement	c
that	c
Danny	c
BROOK	c
was	c
going	c
to	c
play	i
with	c
Tina	c
TRUELOVE	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
him	c
who	c
played	i
.	c

And	c
the	i
Times	i
;	i
the	c
show	c
had	i
to	c
start	c
at	c
19:30	c
,	c
however	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
.	c

Also	c
,	c
there	i
was	c
said	c
to	i
be	i
discounts	c
for	i
the	c
ticket	i
but	c
I	c
saw	i
nothing	c
like	c
this	c
.	c

All	c
people	i
there	c
gave	i
the	c
same	c
amount	c
of	c
money	c
.	c

Your	i
faithfully	c
,	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
big	c
fault	i
to	c
gave	i
her	c
a	c
secret	c
,	c
especially	c
an	c
important	c
one	c
.	c

One	c
day	c
,	c
while	c
he	c
was	c
gardening	c
,	c
he	c
saw	c
an	c
old	c
lady	c
being	c
kidnapped	c
by	c
some	c
strange	c
man	i
,	c
who	c
he	c
ran	c
after	c
and	i
caught	i
one	i
of	i
whom	i
.	c

Just	c
then	c
,	c
the	c
strange	c
man	c
took	c
out	c
his	c
gun	c
.	c

Rod	c
jumped	c
on	c
him	c
and	c
the	c
man	c
killed	c
himself	c
,by	i
his	c
own	c
gun	c
.	c

One	c
day	c
,	c
when	c
they	c
were	c
arguing	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
very	c
anxious	i
and	c
told	c
what	c
she	c
knew	c
to	c
police	i
.	c

And	c
these	c
lines	c
writes	i
on	c
his	c
gravestone	c
:	c

Here	c
lies	c
the	c
poor	i
body	i
of	i
Rod	c
,	c

Never	c
give	c
your	c
secrets	c
away	c
,	c

And	c
everyone	c
was	c
surprised	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

To	c
be	c
honest	c
I	c
had	c
doubts	c
about	c
winning	c
the	c
competition	c
,	c
because	c
in	c
spite	c
of	c
I	i
think	i
I	c
did	c
well	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
play	c
against	c
a	i
very	c
strong	c
competence	i
.	c

About	c
the	c
accommodation	c
I	i
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
.	c

By	c
the	c
way	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
if	c
the	c
level	i
of	i
life	i
in	c
USA	i
is	c
similar	c
to	c
UK	i
.	c

Another	c
point	c
is	c
about	c
the	i
clothes	c
,	i
could	i
you	c
confirm	c
me	i
that	c
I	c
'll	c
need	c
summer	c
clothes	c
?	c

I	c
would	c
be	c
very	c
pleased	c
.	i

Please	c
if	i
you	c
need	c
further	c
information	c
from	c
me	c
,	c
do	c
n't	c
hesitate	c
to	c
contact	c
me	c
again	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
.	c

Normally	c
I	c
enjoy	i
really	i
much	i
shopping	i
.	c

And	c
really	c
,	c
it	c
works	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
like	c
when	i
I	c
have	c
to	c
try	c
on	c
differents	i
sizes	c
because	c
the	c
small	c
does	i
n't	c
fit	c
on	i
my	i
body	i
because	c
I	c
have	c
got	i
weight	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
in	i
this	c
moment	c
when	c
really	c
I	c
realiase	i
I	c
am	c
getting	c
fat	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
horrible	c
feeling	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
women	c
,	c
in	c
general	c
,	c
are	c
very	c
impulsive	c
purchasing	i
things	c
.	c

But	c
from	c
another	c
point	c
of	c
view	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
silly	c
to	c
be	c
earning	c
money	c
and	c
do	i
n't	i
spend	i
it	c
as	c
you	c
want	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Ryan	c
:	c

Thank	i
's	i
for	c
accept	i
me	c
in	c
the	c
competition	c
.	c

I	c
will	c
choose	c
for	c
activities	i
tennis	c
and	c
swimming	c
,	i
I	c
'm	c
good	c
on	i
tennis	c
because	c
I	c
play	i
since	c
1990	c
and	c
I	c
loved	i
it	c
and	c
swimming	i
because	c
I	c
like	c
to	c
swim	c
and	c
I	c
've	c
been	c
two	i
competition	i
and	c
I	c
won	c
both	c
.	c

Thanks	c
for	c
all	i
,	c
and	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
there	c
the	i
next	c
month	c
.	c

Your	i
sincerely	c

For	c
me	c
went	i
to	i
shop	i
it	i
's	i
not	c
the	c
best	c
thing	c
I	c
can	c
do	c
.	c

I	c
like	c
to	c
shop	c
sometimes	c
but	c
not	c
always	c
and	c
not	i
spending	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
money	c
on	c
things	c
that	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
really	c
need	c
.	c

At	i
the	c
rest	c
of	c
you	c
who	c
do	c
n't	c
understand	c
this	c
it	i
's	c
on	i
your	i
memories	i
to	c
keep	c
shopping	c
and	c
spending	c
all	c
your	c
money	c
on	c
things	c
that	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
really	c
need	c
.	c

And	c
sometimes	c
I	c
get	c
bored	c
when	c
I	c
'm	c
shopping	c
because	c
now	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
really	c
enjoy	c
it	c

With	c
reference	c
to	c
the	c
letter	c
from	c
you	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
able	c
to	c
joy	i
the	c
camp	c
only	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
then	i
will	i
be	i
my	c
school	c
holiday	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
tents	c
to	c
long	i
cabins	c
because	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
more	c
interesting	c
and	c
exciting	c
than	i
live	i
in	c
long	i
cabins	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
much	c
about	c
there	i
,	i
is	i
there	c
anything	c
should	i
I	i
bring	c
with	c
me	c
?	c

What	c
is	c
the	c
weather	c
going	c
to	c
be	c

And	c
how	c
much	c

I	c
look	c

If	c

it	i
very	c
well	c
when	i
you	c

doing	c
something	c
and	c
the	c
chilldren	i
see	c
something	c
they	c
want	c
to	c

they	c
will	c
do	c
everything	c
they	c
can	c
do	c
to	c
make	c
you	c

it	c
for	c
them	c
,	c
sometime	i
they	c
even	c
cry	c
or	c
shout	c
to	i
you	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
really	c
anoy	i
you	i

Anyway	c
,	c
even	i
in	c
families	c
they	c
usauly	i
have	c
this	c
problem	c
that	c
when	c
they	c
bought	i
a	c
new	c
one	i
,	c
suddenly	c
they	c
have	c
a	c
problem	c
that	i
where	c
the	c
old	c
one	c
is	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
and	c
that	c
is	c
the	c
begining	i
of	c
argument	i
between	c

parents	c
and	c
chilldren	i

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

My	c
name	c
is	c
Furilo	c
J.M.	c
and	c
last	c
month	c
I	c
spent	c
a	c
few	c
days	c
in	c
London	c
,	i
I	c
visited	c
you	i
theatre	c
.	c

I	c
arrived	c
there	c
at	c
19:00	c
and	c
the	c
show	c
began	c
only	i
20:15	i
.	c

After	c
the	c
show	c
I	c
wanted	c
some	i
thing	i
on	i
the	c
theatre	c
's	c
restaurant	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

After	c
all	c
the	c
inconvenients	i
that	c
made	c
me	c
feel	c
really	c
mad	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
technology	c
is	c
a	c
word	c
that	c
will	i
never	c
get	c
out	c
of	c
our	c
minds	c
,	c
and	c
we	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
how	c
technology	i
,	c
and	i
in	i
which	i
speed	c
it	i
will	c
develop	c
to	i
the	c
future	c
.	c

Maybe	c
,	c
technology	c
will	c
never	c
stop	c
growing	i
and	c
our	c
life	c
will	c
never	c
work	c
without	c
computers	c
.	c

Manager	c
of	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c

I	c
am	c
waiting	i
this	c
letter	c
re	i
fearing	i
to	c
the	c
show	c
"	c
over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
you	c
presented	i
the	i
10	c
of	c
this	c
month	c
.	c

I	c
read	c
your	c
advertissement	i
five	c
days	c
before	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
realy	i
impressed	c
by	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
want	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
some	c
details	c
about	c
my	c
feelings	c
.	c

Then	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
student	c
,	c
and	c
when	c
I	c
bought	c
my	c
ticket	c
,	c
there	c
was	i
n't	i
any	c
discounts	c
.	c

So	c
you	c
can	c
imagine	c
how	c
I	i
am	i
satisfied	i
by	c
your	c
pretending	i
"	i
Perfect	c
Evening	c
"	c
.	c

For	c
all	c
these	c
reasons	c
,	c
and	c
if	c
you	c
want	c
to	c
keep	c
me	c
a	i
costumer	i
,	c
I	c
would	c
be	c
gratfull	i
if	c
you	c
give	i
me	c
some	c
or	c
all	c
my	i
money	c
back	c
.	c

Looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
,	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

My	c
marks	c
was	i
n't	i
good	c
enought	i
to	c
obtain	c
my	c
degree	c
in	c
Computer	c
Science	c
,	c
and	c
the	c
exam	c
session	c
was	c
finished	c
.	c

You	c
need	c
more	c
explanations	c
about	i
me	c
to	c
understand	c
my	c
motivations	i
at	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
this	c
story	c
.	c

In	c
fact	c
,	c
I	c
did	c
this	c
kind	c
of	c
studies	i
because	c
of	c
my	c
interests	c
in	c
programming	c
.	c

That	c
's	c
why	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
hack	c
the	i
teacher	c
's	c
computers	c
to	c
change	c
all	c
my	c
marks	c
.	c

During	c
this	c
party	c
,	c
Pat	c
drank	c
too	c
much	c
.	c

And	c
when	c
he	c
was	c
totally	c
drunk	c
,	c
he	c
started	c
speaking	c
.	c

Then	c
,	c
the	c
teachers	c
made	c
copies	c
of	c
their	c
file	i
,	c
and	c
my	c
project	c
was	c
n't	c
possible	c
anymore	c
.	c

And	c
I	c
think	c
I	c
will	c
still	c
be	c
there	i
next	c
year	c

Dear	c
M.	c
Smith	c
,	c

My	c
name	c
is	c
Marie	c
Bouchard	c
,	c
I	c
come	c
from	c
Switzerland	c
.	c

Two	c
weeks	c
ago	c
,	c
I	c
spent	c
a	c
week	c
in	c
your	c
fabulous	c
city	c
of	c
London	c
with	c
my	c
friend	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
we	c
got	c
our	c
tickets	c
in	i
your	c
ticket	c
office	c
just	c
one	c
hour	c
before	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

We	c
thought	c
,	c
as	c
usual	i
we	c
do	c
in	c
London	c
theatre	i
,	c
we	c
could	c
have	i
discounts	c
as	i
it	c
's	c
written	c
on	c
your	c
advertisement	c
.	i

Thirdly	c
,	c
we	c
were	c
astonished	c
about	i
the	c
actors	c
whose	i
we	c
know	c
from	c
others	i
musical	i
.	c

Why	c
did	c
you	c
not	c
change	c
the	c
name	i
of	i
your	c
advertisement	c
?	c

In	c
the	c
end	c
,	c
the	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
you	c
did	c
n't	c
have	c
enough	c
staffs	i
,	i
this	i
evening	c
!	c
!	c

Nothing	i
was	i
serious	i
.	c

I	c
sent	i
to	i
you	c
a	c
copie	i
of	c
our	c
tickets	c
.	c

Sincerely	c
yours	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

The	c
problem	c
is	c
that	c
Pat	c
works	c
in	c
the	i
Neubathin	c
a	i
little	c
village	c
.	c

She	c
's	c
a	c
secretary	c
in	c
an	c
office	c
.	c

Pat	c
and	c
Scala	c
have	c
been	c
good	c
friends	c
for	c
10	c
years	c
,	c
their	c
husband	i
too	i
.	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
Friday	i
suny	i
afternoon	c
,	c
Scala	c
was	c
really	c
excited	c
to	i
tell	i
her	c
the	c
new	i
.	c

Despite	c
she	i
knew	c
that	c
Pat	c
could	c
n't	c
keep	c
secret	i
but	i
for	i
this	c
time	c
she	c
was	c
confident	c
maybe	i
too	i
.	c

Just	c
after	c
Scala	c
told	c
her	c
the	c
new	i
,	c
Pat	c
phoned	c
her	c
mother	c
who	c
worked	c
in	c
a	c
bakery	c
,	c
to	c
tell	c
that	i
Scala	c
is	i
pregnant	c
.	c

He	c
was	c
so	c
amazed	c
and	c
asked	c
to	i
repeat	c
.	i

She	c
just	c
thought	i
it	c
would	i
be	i
a	c
secret	c
,	c
she	i
came	i
really	c
embarassed	i
.	c

Scala	c
was	c
hungry	i
with	c
Pat	c
because	c
she	c
thought	c
she	c
can	i
keep	c
this	c
kind	c
of	c
secret	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
,	c

Many	c
thanks	c
for	c
the	c
programme	c
you	c
have	c
organised	c
.	c

There	c
is	c
just	c
one	c
thing	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
;	i
Janine	c
and	c
Richey	c
have	c
seen	c
an	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
show	c
and	c
we	c
all	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

That	i
is	c
in	c
the	c
central	i
Exhibition	c
Hall	c
,	c
near	c
the	c
hotel	c
,	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
only	i
about	c
fashion	c
:	c
latest	i
fashions	c
,	c
leisure	c
and	c
sports	c
wear	c
,	c
make	i
up	i
and	c
hairstyles	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
could	c
be	c
very	c
interesting	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
free	c
for	c
students	c
(	c
what	i
is	c
really	c
good	c
)	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
because	c
this	c
show	c
is	c
only	c
each	i
two	c
years	c
and	c
normaly	i
it	c
is	c
difficult	c
to	c
go	i
in	i
.	c

And	c
,	c
as	c
you	c
know	c
we	c
all	c
are	c
interested	c
in	c
fashion	c
.	c

In	i
my	i
opinion	i
,	i
I	c
would	c
suggest	c
to	i
go	i
to	c
the	c
show	c
instead	c
of	c
the	c
National	c
Art	c
Gallery	c
because	c
we	c
could	c
go	c
there	c
another	c
time	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

When	c
I	c
arrived	c
in	c
the	c
street	c
it	c
was	c
dark	c
,	i
windy	i
,	c
but	c
I	c
could	c
see	c
a	c
shadow	c
at	c
the	c
corner	c
of	c
the	c
opposite	i
street	i
.	c

By	c
the	c
time	c
I	c
arrived	c
here	i
,	c
he	c
has	i
disappeared	c
.	c

My	c
sister	c
was	c
standing	c
,	c
crying	c
and	c
showing	i
the	c
front	c
door	c
.	c

They	c
found	c
hime	i
two	c
months	c
after	i
and	c
six	c
months	c
after	i
he	c
was	c
in	c
jail	c
.	c

Everything	c
was	c
going	c
on	i
,	c
when	c
one	c
day	c
,	c
I	c
came	i
in	i
the	c
house	c
and	c
found	c
my	c
mother	c
sitting	c
in	c
a	c
chair	c
reading	c
a	c
book	c
,	c
with	c
blood	c
all	c
around	c
her	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c

I	c
write	i
a	i
letter	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
your	c
advertisement	c
about	i
the	c
musical	c
show	c
"	c
over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
"	c
,	c
wich	i
is	c
misleading	c
in	c
a	c
number	c
of	c
way	i
.	c

Firstly	c
we	c
arrived	c
at	c
19.15	c
to	c
be	c
in	c
time	c
for	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
which	c
should	c
have	c
started	c
at	c
19.30	c
.	c

Besides	c
,	c
when	c
we	c
wanted	c
to	c
buy	c
our	c
tickets	c
we	c
were	c
hoping	c
that	c
the	c
discounting	i
was	c
available	c
.	c

Therefor	i
,	c
as	c
you	c
may	c
understand	c
I	i
'm	c
asking	c
for	c
a	c
refund	c
.	c

Your	i
sincerely	c
,	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
and	c
the	c
rumours	c
describing	i
me	c
stealing	c
soon	c
reached	c
the	c
director	c
's	c
office	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
send	i
a	c
letter	c
in	c
which	c
it	c
was	c
written	c
that	c
the	c
director	c
wanted	c
to	c
meet	c
me	c
and	c
my	c
parents	c
.	c

Sweating	c
and	c
affraid	i
I	c
waited	c
out	i
side	i
the	c
director	c
's	c
office	c
the	c
following	c
day	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
unable	c
to	c
image	i
what	c
would	c
happen	c
to	c
me	c
if	c
my	c
parents	c
knew	c
what	c
I	c
had	c
stolen	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
suprised	i
that	c
my	c
father	c
did	c
n't	c
watch	c
me	c
but	c
I	c
soon	c
understood	c
that	c
he	c
was	c
ignoring	c
me	c
.	c

Mother	c
,	c
on	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
looked	c
at	c
me	c
and	c
seemed	c
both	c
disappointed	c
and	c
betrayed	c
.	c

During	c
the	c
trip	c
home	c
non	i
of	c
us	c
spoke	c
.	c

The	i
same	i
evening	c
my	c
father	c
pronounced	i
a	c
few	c
words	c
:	c
'	c
May	c
this	c
be	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
your	c
thief	i
career	i
we	i
are	c
only	c
ready	c
to	c
forgive	c
if	c
you	c
promiss	i
never	c
to	c
start	c
again	c
'	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
answer	i
to	c
your	c
letter	c
in	c
which	c
you	c
told	c
me	c
I	c
won	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
our	i
competetion	i
,	c
which	c
is	c
two	c
weeks	c
,	i
I	c
was	c
very	c
happy	c
with	c
this	c
result	c
since	c
I	c
did	c
not	c
think	c
I	c
could	c
win	c
.	c

Besides	c
this	c
,	c
in	c
connexion	i
with	c
the	c
activities	c
we	c
will	c
have	c
the	c
chance	c
to	c
do	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
inform	c
you	c
that	c
I	c
choose	c
swimming	c
and	c
tennis	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
quite	c
good	c
at	c
both	c
,	c
especially	c
at	c
tennis	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c

Most	c
of	c
the	c
students	c
agree	c
in	c
saying	c
that	c
two	i
are	i
the	i
main	c
features	c
of	i
our	c
daily	c
life	c
at	c
school	c
which	c
should	c
be	c
filmed	c
:	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
very	c
funny	c
to	c
dwell	i
on	c
us	c
working	c
and	c
speaking	c
together	c
without	i
the	c
help	c
of	c
the	c
teacher	c
to	i
show	i
our	i
efforts	i
and	i
sometimes	i
successful	i
and	i
sometimes	i
ridiculous	i
and	c
also	c
to	c
film	c
some	c
amusing	c
moments	c
we	c
spent	i
waiting	c
for	c
the	c
teacher	c
.	c

The	c
porpouse	i
of	c
this	c
letter	c
is	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
my	c
experience	c
with	c
the	c
musical	c
show	i
"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
,	c
wich	i
really	c
disapointed	i
me	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
there	c
were	c
no	c
diccounts	i
avaible	i
as	i
it	i
said	i
on	i
the	c
anouncement	i
so	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
pay	c
the	c
original	c
price	c
wich	i
was	c
n't	c
cheap	c
at	c
all	c
.	c

Then	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
forced	c
to	c
wait	c
fourty	i
five	i
minutes	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
show	c
because	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
20:75	c
in	i
stead	i
of	c
19:30	c
and	c
when	i
it	c
finally	c
started	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
really	c
disapointed	i
to	c
see	c
that	c
the	c
actors	c
were	c
n't	c
Danny	c
and	c
Tina	c
as	c
it	c
said	i
on	i
the	c
anouncement	i
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
when	c
the	c
show	c
finished	c
,	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
visit	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
for	c
repairs	c
.	c

Your	c
really	c
unsatisfied	i
costomer	i

How	c
has	c
modern	c
technology	c
afected	i
my	c
daily	c
life	c
?	c

We	c
live	c
sorrounded	i
by	c
inventions	c
wich	i
help	c
as	c
through	c
the	c
day	c
.	c

From	c
the	c
vehicle	c
we	c
use	c
to	c
move	c
faster	c
to	c
the	c
light	c
bulb	c
we	c
use	c
at	c
night	c
,	c
we	c
constantly	c
depends	i
on	c
these	c
inventions	c
to	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
make	i
the	c
things	c
we	c
have	c
to	c
do	c
.	c

That	c
's	c
why	c
modern	c
technology	c
is	c
so	c
important	c
in	c
our	c
daily	c
life	i
,	c
because	c
it	c
helps	c
to	c
make	c
our	c
life	i
easiest	i
and	c
to	c
do	c
what	c
we	c
have	c
to	c
do	c

so	c
then	c
we	c
can	c

I	c

to	c
your	c

I	c
received	c
two	c
days	c

all	c
questions	c
I	c
was	c

Second	i
of	i
all	i
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
live	i
in	c
a	c
tent	c

I	c
am	c
used	c
to	c
this	c
kind	c
of	c
accommodation	c
since	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
taking	c
part	c
in	c
survival	c
camps	c
for	c
a	c
long	c
time	c

Furthermore	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
some	c
questions	c

What	c
type	c
of	c
clothes	c
should	c
I	c
take	c
and	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
would	c
be	c

Is	c

Thank	c

Yours	c

I	c
think	c
I	c
told	c
you	c
about	c
my	c
plans	c
of	i
entering	i
a	c
group	c
that	c
helps	c
at	c
concerts	c
,	c
did	c
n't	c
I	c
?	c

Well	c
,	c
I	c
took	c
my	c
chance	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
chosen	c
to	c
help	c
at	c
Michael	c
Jackson	c
's	c
concert	c
.	c

Amazing	c
,	c
is	c
n't	c
it	c
?	c

There	c
was	i
about	c
100	c
000	c
people	c
.	c

We	c
had	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
things	c
to	c
do	c
.	c

Acctually	i
,	c
they	c
put	c
me	c
very	c
close	c
to	c
the	c
stage	c
,	c
in	c
the	c
middle	c
of	c
the	c
real	c
hell	c
.	c

Many	c
people	c
fainted	c
and	c
some	c
of	c
them	c
,	c
the	c
most	c
serious	c
cases	c
,	c
had	c
to	c
be	c
taken	c
to	c
hospital	c
.	c

After	c
the	c
concert	c
many	c
people	c
lost	c
their	c
way	c
home	c
,	c
mostly	c
foreigners	c
who	c
did	c
n't	c
know	c
the	c
buses	c
'	c
schedule	c
.	c

I	c
did	c
n't	c
manage	c
to	c
meet	c
Michael	c
as	c
I	c
had	c
expected	c
,	c
but	c
apart	c
from	c
that	c
,	c
I	c
really	c
enjoyed	c
time	i
I	c
spent	c
there	c

Best	c

Sir	c
manager	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
what	c
you	c
have	c
written	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
on	i
the	c
newspaper	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
disappointed	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
horrible	c
evening	c
I	c
have	c
had	c
,	i
I	c
was	c
on	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
and	c
I	c
did	c
not	c
have	c
time	i
enough	i
to	c
spend	c
there	c
,	c
but	c
when	c
you	c
said	c
that	c
show	i
was	c
the	c
best	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
go	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
bought	c
my	c
ticket	c
I	c
asked	c
for	c
a	c
discount	c
and	c
they	c
said	c
it	i
was	i
not	i
available	c
.	c

I	c
arrived	c
at	c
the	c
theatre	c
in	c
time	c
and	c
the	c
musical	c
show	i
started	c
later	c
than	c
I	c
expected	c
so	c
I	c
was	c
getting	c
nervous	i
because	c
I	c
dislike	i
very	i
much	i
the	i
impuntuality	i
,	c
but	c
that	c
was	c
not	c
all	c
.	c

When	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
the	c
person	c
who	c
was	c
acting	c
it	i
was	c
not	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
he	i
seemed	i
not	i
to	c
be	c
an	c
actor	c
.	c

Really	c
he	c
was	c
bad	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
letting	i
down	i
because	i
of	i
your	c
behaviour	c
.	c

You	c
wanted	c
to	c
cheat	c
me	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
very	c
pleasure	i
if	c
you	c
could	c
give	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
your	i
answer	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
technology	c
has	c
changed	c
my	c
life	c
and	c
the	c
way	i
of	i
living	i
of	c
almost	c
all	i
people	i
around	c
the	c
world	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
technology	i
is	c
very	c
useful	c
nowadays	c
but	c
really	c
I	c
dislike	c
it	c
because	c
in	c
some	c
ways	c
we	c
are	c
becoming	c
machines	c
too	c
.	c

Since	c
the	c
creation	c
of	c
PCs	c
,	c
people	c
-	c
and	c
me	c
too	c
,	c
of	c
course	c
-	c
are	i
making	i
different	c
things	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
we	c
can	c
buy	c
food	c
,	c
clothes	c
and	c
whatever	c
we	c
need	c
by	c
internet	i
or	c
by	c
telephone	c
.	c

I	c
can	c
know	i
what	c
is	c
happening	c
in	c
differents	i
parts	c
of	c
the	c
world	c
in	c
a	c
few	c
minutes	c
.	c

A	c
very	c
good	c
point	i
of	c
this	c
change	c
is	c
that	c
women	c
have	c
more	c
freedom	c
to	c
have	i
a	i
job	i
because	c
before	c
reaching	i
the	c
technology	c
they	c
have	i
to	c
stay	c
at	c
home	c
doing	c
housework	c
but	c
now	c
we	c
have	c
laundries	c
and	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
machines	c
like	c
microwave	c
oven	i
.	c

In	i
my	i
case	i
I	c
dislike	c
computers	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
how	c
to	c
use	c
them	c
but	c
I	c
know	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
change	c
because	c
they	c
help	c
us	i
to	c
make	c
our	c
lives	c
easier	c
.	c

Our	c
life	i
will	c
be	c
managed	c
by	c
robots	c
and	c
they	c
will	c
replace	c
us	c
in	i
our	i
jobs	i
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
a	c
musical	c
show	c
which	c
I	c
've	c
seen	c
recently	c
at	c
your	c
theatre	c
.	c

There	c
are	c
several	c
reasones	i
why	c
I	c
was	c
n't	c
satisfied	c
with	c
it	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
written	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
that	c
a	c
famous	c
actor	c
Danny	i
Brook	c
would	i
play	i
in	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

Despite	c
it	i
,	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
stared	i
in	c
the	c
performance	c
,	c
which	c
was	c
really	c
disappointing	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
the	c
beginning	c
of	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
45	c
minutes	c
later	c
than	c
it	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
be	c
.	c

Thirdly	c
,	c
no	c
discounts	c
were	c
made	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
buying	c
the	c
tickets	c
.	c

That	c

in	c
the	c

This	c
is	c
the	c
main	c
reasone	i

Fashion	c
of	c
the	c
Future	c
.	c

During	i
the	c
centuries	c
man	c
's	c
clothes	c
has	i
been	c
changing	c
and	c
even	c
developing	c
in	c
some	c
way	i
.	c

People	c
's	c
clothes	c
have	c
been	c
changing	c
from	c
metalwear	i
to	c
shorts	c
and	c
miniskirts	c
.	c

That	c
's	c
why	c
I	c
suppose	c
,	i
that	c
man	c
's	c
clothes	c
will	c
be	c
becoming	c
more	i
and	i
more	i
light	i

People	c
wo	c
n't	c
be	c
embarassed	i
to	c
show	c
the	c
beauty	c
of	c
their	c
bodies	c

Perhaps	c
,	c
clothes	c
will	c
be	c
rather	c
small	c
.	c

Maybe	c
,	c
people	c
will	c
create	c
something	c
even	c
smaller	c
than	c
that	c

Perhaps	c
,	c
metalwear	i
will	c
become	c
a	c
craze	c
again	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
happy	c
to	c
have	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
of	i
the	c
competition	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
going	c
to	i
clear	i
up	i
some	c
details	c
you	c
asked	c
me	c
in	i
your	c
letter	c
.	c

On	i
the	i
other	i
handDuring	i
my	c
stay	c
in	i
Camp	c
California	c
,	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
go	c
swimming	c
because	c
I	c
practice	i
this	c
activitie	i
regularly	c
and	c
I	c
often	c
do	i
competitions	c
:	c
this	c
is	c
one	c
of	c
my	c
hobbies	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
two	c
questions	c
more	c
:	c
I	c
wonder	c
if	c
I	c
can	c
change	c
my	c
french	i
money	c
in	c
the	c
Camp	i
and	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c

I	c
have	c
to	c
buy	c
before	c
coming	c
?	c

Yours	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

As	c
you	c
asked	c
me	c
in	c
your	c
last	c
letter	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
going	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
more	c
about	c
the	i
last	c
month	c
's	c
pop	c
concert	c
.	c

Then	c
,	c
there	c
was	c
only	c
one	c
hour	c
left	c
to	c
install	c
the	c
differents	i
color	i
lights	c
:	i
it	c
was	c
just	c
enought	i
time	c
.	c

Thus	i
,	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
fantastic	c
afternoon	c
because	c
I	c
like	c
very	i
much	i
music	i
,	c
even	c
if	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
play	c
any	c
music	i
instrument	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
I	c
learnt	c
a	c
lot	c
about	c
music	c
,	c
especially	c
concerning	c
the	i
way	i
of	i
using	i
an	c
instrument	c
.	c

Consequently	c
,	c
I	c
hope	c
I	c
will	c
play	c
an	c
instrument	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
,	c
especially	c
because	c
the	c
group	c
promises	c
me	i
to	c
help	c
me	c
to	c
learn	c
any	c
instrument	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
,	c

On	c
behalf	c
of	c
my	c
class	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
request	c
few	i
changes	c
in	c
our	c
London	c
programme	c
which	c
has	c
already	c
been	c
planned	c
.	c

My	c
friends	c
have	c
seen	c
an	c
advertisement	c
which	c
is	c
the	i
London	c
fashion	i
and	i
leissure	i
show	i
.	c

We	c
have	c
decided	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
more	c
interesting	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
latest	c
fashions	c
,	c
make	i
up	i
,	c
hairstyles	i
instead	i
of	i
going	c
to	c
do	c
shopping	c
.	c

We	c
would	i
all	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
the	c
organised	c
programme	c
.	c

I	c
apologise	c
any	i
inconvenience	c
that	c
this	c
cause	i
you	c
.	c

We	c
would	c
be	c
pleased	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
make	c
a	c
new	c
arrangement	c
in	c
your	c
programme	c

CAN	c
YOU	c
IMAGINE	c
THE	c
NEW	c
YOUR	i
HOUSE	c
?	c

We	c
spend	c
most	c
of	c
our	c
life	c
in	c
our	c
houses	c
.	c

We	c
like	c
them	c
show	i
our	c
life	i
style	i
and	c
of	c
course	c
feel	c
ourself	i
comfortable	c
.	c

It	c
would	c
be	c
much	c
technological	i
or	i
far	c
less	c
complex	c
.	c

but	c
the	c
imagine	i
of	c
the	c
life	i
style	i
depends	c
on	c
person	i
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
it	c
would	c
not	c
be	c
changed	c
.	c

Somehow	c
I	c
could	c
say	c
that	c
the	c
main	c
appliance	i
would	c
remain	i
the	c
same	c
working	c
structure	c
.	c

it	i
only	i
just	i
might	i
be	i
changed	i
the	i
design	i
of	i
things	i
such	c
as	c
a	c
triangular	c
talking	c
oven	c
.	c

On	c
balance	c
I	c
would	c
accept	c
whatever	c
could	c
make	c
my	c
life	c
easier	c
.	i

I	c
would	c
n't	c
mind	c
having	c
things	c
talking	c
to	i
around	c
me	c
.	c

it	i
would	c
be	c
enjoyable	c
to	c
have	c
virtual	c
friends	c
in	c
my	c
house	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
which	c
I	c
've	c
recently	c
seen	c
at	c
your	c
theatre	c
.	c

The	c
advertisement	c
shew	i
two	c
actors	c
but	c
I	c
was	c
surprised	c
to	c
see	c
as	i
the	i
main	i
caracter	i
a	i
different	i
person	i
.	c

As	c
well	c
as	c
this	c
,	c
to	c
my	c
horror	c
,	c
the	c
performance	c
did	c
n't	c
start	c
at	c
19.30	c
but	c
forthy	i
five	i
minutes	c
later	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
will	c
give	c
me	c
back	c
the	c
prize	i
of	c
my	c
ticket	c
!	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

Introduction	c
:	c
It	c
seems	c
to	c
me	c
that	c
modern	c
technology	c
has	c
deeply	i
changed	c
our	c
daily	c
life	c
.	c

The	c
computer	c
is	c
everywhere	c
and	c
it	c
's	c
available	c
for	c
everyone	c
.	c

An	i
usefull	i
help	i
:	c
The	i
personal	c
computer	c
can	c
fastly	i
help	c
you	c
in	c
lots	c
of	c
situations	c
.	c

Have	i
a	i
good	i
feeling	i
with	i
it	i
!	c
:	c
On	i
one	i
side	i
,	c
the	i
modern	c
technology	c
is	c
extremely	c
important	c
,	c
on	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
you	c
should	c
n't	c
abuse	c
of	i
it	c
.	c

Conclusion	c
:	c
I	c
do	c
think	c
,	c
however	c
,	c
the	i
modern	c
technology	c
is	c
essential	c
for	c
human	c
being	i
nowadays	c
.	c

Although	c
the	c
world	c
of	c
computers	c
will	c
develop	c
day	c
by	c
day	c
,	c
I	c
lively	i
hope	c
we	c
(	c
human	c
being	i
)	c
could	i
mantain	i
our	c
personality	i
of	c
seeing	c
things	c

EARLY	c
IN	c
THE	c
MORNING..	c

GREATING	i
AND	c
HOPE	c
TO	c
SEE	c
YOU	c
SOON	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

I	c
have	c
recently	c
been	c
to	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
to	c
see	c
a	c
musical	c
show	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
advertised	c
as	c
London	c
's	c
Newest	c
and	c
best	c
musical	c
show	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
it	c
had	i
been	i
a	c
very	c
dissappointing	i
evening	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
there	c
was	c
a	c
delay	c
on	i
the	c
show	c
which	i
supposed	i
to	c
started	i
at	c
19.30	c
but	c
,	i
it	c
was	i
actually	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
.	c

This	c
really	c
upset	c
me	c
as	c
no	c
notice	c
were	i
given	c
before	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
,	c
the	c
advertisment	i
mentioned	c
that	c
restaurant	i
will	i
be	c
opened	i
after	c
the	c
show	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
,	i
short	i
of	i
cooker	i
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

As	i
it	i
is	c
another	c
important	c
factor	c
which	c
affects	c
our	c
life	c
,	c
apart	c
from	c
money	c
,	c
health	c
,	c
food	c
and	c
house	i
.	c

The	c
reasons	c
it	c
is	c
important	c
to	c
us	c
are	c
,	c
first	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
if	i
you	i
think	i
bout	i
life	i
without	c
computers	c
,	c
communication	c
machines	i
and	c
transportation	c
machines	i
.	c

We	c
would	c
n't	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
sort	i
out	i
informations	i
and	c
datas	i
this	i
quickly	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
no	c
one	c
could	c
communicate	c
on	c
the	c
phone	c
through	i
countries	i
or	i
even	i
through	i
houses	i
as	c
immediate	i
as	c
nowadays	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
the	c
affects	i
that	c
it	c
has	c
on	c
our	c
daily	c
life	c
is	i
not	c
always	c
good	c
as	c
sometime	i
,	i
the	c
technology	c
went	i
wrong	c
and	c
out	i
of	i
hand	i
of	i
people	i
who	i
control	i
it	i
can	c
cause	c
disaster	i
accidents	c
,	c
for	c
example	c
:	c
plane	c
crashes	c
,	c
trains	i
crashed	i
and	c
explosion	i
of	c
nuclears	i
bomb	i
.	c

If	c
this	c
continue	i
to	c
happen	c
our	c
life	c
would	i
be	c
very	c
misarable	i
as	c
accident	i
happens	i
all	c
the	c
time	c
.	c

Therefore	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
important	c
to	c
get	c
it	c
exactly	c
right	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
on	c
behalf	c
my	i
English	c
class	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
many	i
interesting	c
positions	i
in	c
this	c
schedule	c
,	c
especially	c
the	c
river	c
trip	c
to	c
Greenwich	c
,	c
which	c
,	c
we	c
are	c
shure	i
,	c
will	c
be	c
very	c
exciting	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
inform	c
you	c
,	i
that	c
we	c
have	c
seen	c
an	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
"	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Laisure	i
Show	c
"	c
and	c
we	c
have	c
found	c
it	c
very	c
interesting	c
.	c

We	c
will	i
be	c
able	c
to	c
visit	c
the	c
Science	c
Museum	c
on	c
Wednesday	i
's	i
afternoon	c
.	c

We	c
have	c
checked	c
that	c
it	c
is	c
open	c
every	c
day	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
know	c
we	c
are	c
the	c
best	c
students	c
in	c
our	c
school	c
and	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
nice	i
prize	i
for	c
our	c
work	c
during	c
this	c
year	c
.	c

Your	i
sincerelly	i

It	c
was	c
dangerous	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
knew	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
.	c

The	c
outside	c
lights	c
were	c
broken	i
down	i
and	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
see	c
anything	c
.	c

My	c
dog	c
was	c
very	c
angry	c
.	c

After	c
a	c
few	c
minutes	c
I	c
heard	c
steps	c
near	c
my	c
kitchen	i
's	i
window	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
frethend	i
,	c
but	c
I	c
knew	c
,	i
that	c
I	c
should	i
do	i
something	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
no	c
time	c
to	c
call	c
someone	i
and	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
my	c
kitchen	c
to	c
check	i
what	c
it	c
was	c
.	c

I	c
stood	c
against	c
the	c
window	c
and	c
I	c
started	c
to	c
listen	c
.	c

Suddenly	c
someone	c
broke	c
my	c
window	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
no	c
time	c
to	c
think	c
,	i
I	c
kept	i
one	c
of	c
the	c
pots	c
and	c
hit	c
him	c
in	i
his	c
head	c
.	c

One	c
moment	c
later	c
I	c
called	c
police	i

He	c
was	c
a	c
thief	c
,	c
who	c
were	i
looked	c
for	c
for	c
many	c
years	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

Another	c
thing	c
was	c
that	c
you	c
said	c
discounts	c
are	c
available	c
which	i
is	c
very	c
important	c
for	c
students	c
,	c
but	c
no	c
their	i
were	c
n't	c
any	c
.	c

To	c
be	c
honest	c
that	c
was	c
not	c
a	c
great	c
expierence	i
and	c
I	c
hope	c
you	c
will	c
see	c
my	c
point	c
.	c

In	c
that	c
case	c
I	c
also	c
want	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
for	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
you	c
will	c
understand	c
that	c
and	c
looking	i
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

Since	c
everyone	c
can	c
afford	c
modern	c
technology	c
the	i
life	i
of	i
everyone	i
in	c
the	c
more	c
developed	c
countries	c
has	c
changed	c
completly	i
.	c

It	c
starts	c
already	i
in	c
the	c
morning	c
that	i
we	c
wake	i
up	c
by	c
the	c
sound	c
of	c
an	c
alarm	c
clock	c
,	c
than	i
in	c
the	c
bathroom	c
we	c
have	c
running	c
hot	c
water	c
and	c
also	c
the	c
hole	i
house	c
is	c
warm	c
due	c
to	c
central	c
heating	c
.	c

Then	c
we	c
can	c
just	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
fridge	c
where	c
all	c
the	c
fresh	c
food	c
is	c
stored	c
ready	c
to	c
eat	c
.	c

If	c
we	c
than	i
want	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
work	c
we	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
to	c
get	c
our	c
horse	c
,	c
no	c
,	c
we	c
get	c
the	c
car	c
keys	c
and	c
go	c
where	i
ever	i
we	c
want	c
to	c
.	c

At	c
work	c
we	c
have	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
thing	c
in	c
the	c
world	c
of	c
technology	c
,	c
the	c
computer	c
.	c

So	c
in	c
the	c
last	c
century	c
our	c
daily	c
life	c
changed	i
dramandesly	i
and	c
we	c
became	i
lazy	c
and	c
our	c
life	c
unpersonal	i
,	c
fast	c
and	c
unromantic	c
.	c

Noone	i
can	c
think	c
about	c
a	c
life	c
without	c
commuters	i
or	c
electricity	c
.	c

But	c
we	c
ca	c
n't	c
say	c
the	c
new	c
technology	c
has	c
done	i
just	i
bad	c
things	c
in	c
our	c
life	c
because	c
otherwise	c
we	c
could	c
n't	c
have	c
made	c
such	c
progress	c
in	c
all	c
the	c
sciences	c
and	c
other	c
subjects	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

Your	c
advertisement	c
mentioned	c
that	c
the	c
famous	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
would	c
play	c
in	c
this	c
show	c
but	c
disappointingly	c
it	c
was	c
another	c
,	c
unkown	i
actor	c
who	c
starred	c
instead	c
of	c
him	c
.	c

Another	c
point	c
which	c
caused	c
some	c
inconveniences	i
was	c
the	c
timetable	i
of	i
the	i
show	i
.	c

It	c
began	c
45	c
minutes	c
later	c
than	c
it	c
should	c
have	c
been	i
.	c

All	c
those	c
innacuracies	i
spoilt	c
what	c
should	c
have	c
been	c
a	c
memoriable	i
evening	c
so	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
be	c
refunded	c
at	c
least	c
for	c
the	c
price	c
of	c
my	c
ticket	c
.	c

T.	c
Gens	c

Of	c
course	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
my	c
fault	c
.	c

I	c
should	c
have	c
known	c
better	c
but	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
tell	c
it	i
to	i
someone	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
made	c
a	c
mistake	c
and	c
I	c
told	c
her	c
.	c

I	c
immediately	c
knew	c
that	c
something	c
was	c
wrong	c
so	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
word	c
with	c
Pat	c
.	c

She	c
denied	c
having	c
revealed	c
my	c
secret	c
but	c
she	c
was	c
averting	i
my	c
eyes	c
.	c

From	c
this	c
moment	c
,	c
I	c
knew	c
without	c
the	c
shadow	c
of	c
a	c
doubt	c
that	c
my	c
mother	c
would	c
know	c
it	i
sooner	c
or	c
later	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
only	c
a	c
question	c
of	c
hours	c
before	c
my	c
life	c
would	c
collapse	c
.	c

My	c
fear	c
turned	c
out	c
to	c
be	c
right	i
.	c

She	c
knew	c
.	c

She	c
knew	c
that	c
I	c
had	c
bought	c
my	c
first	c
bra	c
without	c
having	c
asked	c
her	c
for	c
advice	c
before	i
it	i
.	c

Mr.	c
Smith	c
,	c

I	c
write	c
to	c
you	c
because	c
last	c
night	c
,	c
(	c
Saturday	c
10	c
)	c
,	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
that	c
you	c
are	c
presenting	c
at	c
the	c
Circle	c
theatre	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
a	c
great	c
fan	c
of	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
went	c
to	c
see	c
him	c
in	c
his	c
new	c
show	c
,	c
but	c
,	c
to	c
my	c
surprise	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
him	c
who	c
played	c
that	c
night	c
but	c
another	c
horrible	i
young	c
actor	c
.	c

I	c
went	c
with	c
my	c
daughter	c
,	c
a	c
university	c
student	c
,	c
and	c
she	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
have	i
a	c
discount	c
on	c
the	c
ticket	c
.	c

We	c
asked	c
for	c
it	c
and	c
we	c
were	c
told	c
that	c
there	c
was	c
not	i
discount	c
neither	i
for	c
her	c
not	i
for	i
anyone	c
else	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
pay	c
the	c
full	c
price	c
of	c
the	c
two	c
tickets	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
announced	i
to	c
start	c
at	c
19.30	c
p.m.	c
and	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
20.15	c
p.m.	c
for	c
reasons	c
anyone	i
would	c
explain	c
to	c
the	c
audience	c
.	c

After	c
the	c
play	c
,	c
we	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
's	c
restaurant	c
and	c
we	c
found	c
out	c
that	c
it	c
was	i
closed	c
since	c
1999's	i
spring	i
!	c

How	c
can	c
you	c
ask	c
the	i
people	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
a	c
closed	c
restaurant	c
?	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
be	c
very	c
grateful	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
send	c
me	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
because	c
,	c
as	c
you	c
have	c
seen	c
,	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
spend	i
the	c
"	c
perfect	c
evening	c
"	c
you	c
announce	i
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

Of	c
course	c
,	c
Ann	c
promised	c
not	c
to	c
tell	c
anyone	c
,	c
but	c
by	c
the	i
lunch-break	i
all	c
the	c
school	c
knew	c
that	c
Lise	c
had	c
stolen	c
the	c
literature	c
exams	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
the	c
perfect	c
plan	c
does	c
n't	c
exist	c
,	c
and	c
a	c
teacher	c
heard	c
two	c
students	c
talking	c
in	c
the	c
bathroom	c
.	c

The	c
teachers	c
started	c
investigating	c
and	c
asking	c
all	c
the	c
students	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
secret	c
and	c
they	c
could	c
n't	c
say	c
a	c
word	c
.	c

No-one	c
said	c
a	c
word	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
this	c
letter	c
to	c
congratulate	c
you	c
for	i
the	c
excellent	c
international	c
arts	c
festival	c
we	c
could	i
enjoy	i
last	c
November	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
a	c
few	c
things	c
that	c
I	c
personally	c
think	c
can	i
be	c
improved	c
in	c
the	i
following	i
editions	i
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
advertisement	c
I	c
expected	c
starts	i
and	c
artists	c
from	c
all	c
over	c
the	c
world	c
but	c
they	c
came	c
from	c
only	c
six	c
countries	c
.	c

Artists	c
from	c
different	c
cultures	c
may	i
make	c
the	c
festival	c
even	c
more	c
interesting	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
although	c
the	c
music	c
concerts	c
were	c
good	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
some	c
concert	c
halls	c
were	c
too	c
small	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
shame	c
to	c
found	i
that	c
some	c
of	c
them	c
were	c
sold	c
out	c
because	c
the	i
short	i
number	c
of	c
seats	c
available	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
really	c
enjoyed	c
the	c
dance	c
shows	c
and	c
the	c
plays	c
and	c
films	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
in	c
my	c
opinion	c
two	c
days	c
is	c
a	c
short	c
time	c
for	c
this	c
kind	c
of	c
event	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
strongly	c
encourage	c
you	c
to	c
organise	c
a	c
full	c
week	i
festival	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
the	c
prize	i
was	c
reasonably	i
and	c
it	c
was	c
helpful	c
to	c
have	c
one	c
ticket	c
for	c
all	c
the	c
weekend	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
'll	c
attend	i
my	c
suggestions	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

Once	c
upon	c
a	c
time	c
,	c
in	c
a	c
small	c
Catalan	c
village	c
,	c
there	c
was	c
a	c
little	c
boy	c
who	c
loved	c
cheating	i
and	c
making	c
jokes	c
.	c

His	c
little	c
son	c
,	c
called	c
Joan	c
,	c
decided	i
quickly	c
:	c
"	c
I	c
will	c
help	c
you	c
.	c

the	i
next	c
day	c
he	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
mountain	c
with	c
the	c
animals	c
.	c

"	c
Let	c
's	c
have	c
a	c
bit	c
of	c
fun	c
"	c
,	c
he	c
thought	c
.	c

Help	c
me	c
!	c
the	i
fox	c
!	c
"	c

They	c
were	c
angry	c
.	c

He	c
did	c
it	c
more	i
times	c
,	c
and	c
at	i
last	i
nobody	c
cared	i
of	c
the	c
shoutings	i
.	c

Nobody	c
came	c
.	c

Dear	c
Clark	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
because	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
give	c
my	c
personal	c
opinion	c
about	c
the	c
'	c
international	c
arts	c
festival	c
.	c
'	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
the	c
whole	c
festival	c
was	c
a	c
greatful	i
success	c
and	c
I	c
also	c
think	c
you	c
chose	c
an	c
appropriate	c
title	c
for	c
the	c
leaflet	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
some	c
points	c
which	c
can	c
be	c
improved	c
for	c
the	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

This	i
kind	i
of	i
problem	i
you	i
could	i
avoid	i
when	i
you	c
look	c
for	c
big	c
halls	c
at	c
the	c
begining	i
.	c

Nearly	c
at	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
this	c
letter	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
the	c
idea	c
with	i
the	c
weekend	c
ticket	c
was	c
really	c
good	c
because	c
it	c
gave	c
to	i
the	c
people	c
the	c
opportunity	c
to	c
attemp	i
a	i
whole	c
weekend	c
for	c
a	c
cheap	c
price	c
.	c

To	c
finish	c
this	c
letter	c
with	i
I	i
would	c
like	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
a	c
good	c
idea	c
for	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
nice	c
if	c
you	c
create	i
an	c
exhibition	c
place	i
where	c
the	c
guests	c
can	c
try	c
to	c
play	c
different	c
instruments	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

How	c
can	c
you	c
earn	c
money	c
in	c
your	c
spare	c
time	c
?	c

A	c
traditional	c
way	c
to	c
earn	c
money	c
,	c
in	c
the	i
spare	c
time	c
,	c
is	c
to	c
bring	i
newspapers	c
or	c
magazines	c
to	c
the	c
families	c
in	c
your	c
town	c
or	c
village	c
.	c

The	c
problems	i
that	c
you	c
have	c
here	c
is	c
the	c
weather	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
when	c
it	c
is	c
rainy	c
,	c
because	c
then	c
everything	c
get	i
wet	c
.	c

Of	c
course	c
in	c
the	c
begining	i
it	c
is	c
hard	c
but	c
you	c
can	c
learn	c
a	c
lot	c
and	c
if	c
you	c
're	c
good	c
at	c
you	i
'll	c
also	c
earn	c
some	c
money	c
.	c

Okay	c
do	c
n't	c
wait	c
,	c
there	i
where	i
you	i
're	i
good	i
at	i
and	i
begin	i
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs/Ms	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
you	i
because	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
answer	i
the	c
information	c
that	c
you	c
ask	c
for	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
there	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
the	c
only	c
month	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
free	c
in	i
my	c
job	c
.	c

It	c
will	c
be	c
impossible	c
another	i
choise	i
,	c
but	c
if	c
you	c
have	c
any	c
problem	c
you	c
will	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
advise	c
me	c
,	c
although	c
I	c
prefer	c
to	c
go	c
there	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
I	c
think	c
is	i
the	c
best	c
month	c
to	c
travel	c
,	i
the	c
weather	c
is	c
nicer	c
and	c
warmer	c
than	c
in	c
other	c
seasons	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
my	c
choise	i
is	c
the	c
accommodation	c
in	c
tents	c
,	i
I	c
think	c
it	c
could	c
be	c
more	c
interesting	c
,	i
I	c
could	c
enjoy	c
my	c
time	c
with	c
other	c
people	c
playing	c
,	c
eating	c
and	c
talking	c
outside	c
,	i
in	i
my	c
opinion	c
if	c
I	c
choose	c
the	c
log	i
cabins	i
it	c
will	c
be	c
like	c
be	i
at	c
home	c
.	c

About	c
the	c
two	c
activities	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
select	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
the	c
best	c
one	i
are	c
swimming	c
and	c
painting	c
.	c

I	c
choose	c
swimming	c
because	c
I	c
really	c
love	c
doing	c
it	c
,	i
I	c
used	c
to	c
swim	c
every	c
day	c
in	c
the	c
sea	c
a	c
few	c
years	c
ago	c
,	i
I	c
felt	c
really	c
healthy	c
.	c

My	c
other	c
choise	i
is	c
painting	c
,	i
I	c
paint	i
since	c
I	c
was	c
ten	c
years	c
old	c
,	i
I	c
used	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
special	c
classes	c
and	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
mind	c
if	c
you	c
need	c
me	c
to	c
help	c
in	c
the	c
class	c
.	c

It	c
should	c
be	c
a	c
dry	c
place	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
but	i
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
make	c
sure	c
my	i
guess	i
,	i
as	i
well	i
,	c
I	c
would	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
-	c

The	c
most	c
popular	c
"	c
sport	c
"	c
that	c
all	i
the	i
people	i
do	i
it	i
's	i
obiously	i
shopping	c
.	c

This	c
is	c
the	c
thing	c
that	c
move	i
hundred	i
and	c
hundreds	c
of	c
people	c
in	c
the	c
world	c
and	c
we	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
Japan	c
we	i
have	c
the	c
evidences	i
here	c
in	c
England	c
.	c

But	c
the	c
question	c
is	c
:	c
Is	c
shopping	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
?	c

But	c
other	c
people	c
do	c
n't	c
think	c
like	c
this	c
,	i
for	i
example	c
,	c
there	c
is	c
a	c
case	c
of	c
a	c
woman	c
who	c
was	c
shopping	c
with	c
her	c
little	c
daughter	c
and	c
without	c
inttetion	i
the	c
girl	c
get	i
lost	c
.	c

The	c
mother	c
was	c
shock	i
,	i
she	i
did	c
n't	c
know	c
how	c
to	c
look	c
for	c
her	c
because	c
all	c
the	c
shops	c
and	c
streets	c
were	c
full	c
of	c
people	c
going	c
out	i
and	i
in	i
the	i
places	i
,	i
it	i
was	c
nightmare	i
but	c
fortunaly	i
the	c
police	c
found	c
her	c
.	c

Where	c
we	i
are	i
going	c
!	c
!	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
the	i
thing	c
that	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
do	c
in	c
my	c
free	c
time	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
your	c
nice	c
letter	c
which	c
informed	c
me	c
to	i
have	i
won	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
my	i
competition	c
.	c

In	c
your	c
letter	c
you	c
needed	i
some	i
informations	i
about	c
me	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
I	c
have	i
only	c
the	i
possibility	i
to	i
travel	i
in	c
July	c
because	c
in	c
August	c
I	c
will	c
start	c
a	c
new	c
job	c
for	c
six	c
months	c
.	c

For	i
accommodations	i
at	c
this	c
camp	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
being	i
in	c
a	c
tent	c
to	c
being	i
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
.	c

It	c
will	c
allow	c
me	c
to	c
make	c
friends	c
more	c
quickly	c
.	c

Two	c
of	c
my	c
best	i
activities	c
are	c
swimming	c
and	c
photography	c
.	c

The	c
first	c
one	c
is	i
a	i
needless	i
for	i
me	i
.	c

I	c
go	c
every	i
day	i
swimming	i
one	i
Mile	i
.	c

The	i
last	i
summer	c
I	c
won	c
a	c
prize	c
in	c
competition	i
of	i
swimming	i
.	c

The	c
second	c
one	i
is	c
more	c
a	i
hobby	c
.	c

I	c
like	c
go	i
in	i
nature	i
and	c
make	i
photography	i
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
any	c
material	i
.	c

Could	c
you	c
tell	c
me	c
if	c
you	c
would	i
lend	c
me	c
some	c
material	i
for	i
photography	i
?	c

What	c
sort	c
of	c
clothes	c
will	c
I	c
need	c
for	c
these	c
two	c
weeks	c
?	c

How	c
much	c
money	c
will	i
I	c
take	c
with	c
me	c
?	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

I	c
'm	c
so	c
happy	c
with	i
the	c
experience	c
I	c
lived	i
last	c
month	c
.	c

I	c
told	c
you	c
that	c
I	c
have	i
helped	i
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
last	c
month	c
.	c

I	i
was	c
really	c
great	c
.	c

Firstly	i
I	c
was	c
designed	i
to	c
sell	c
the	c
tickets	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
already	i
happy	c
to	c
help	c
in	i
such	i
a	i
big	i
concert	i
than	i
the	i
Mylene	i
Farmer	i
's	i
concert	i
.	c

I	c
was	c
starting	c
to	c
sell	c
the	c
tickets	c
when	c
a	i
person	i
who	i
organised	i
told	c
me	c
to	c
go	c
into	c
the	c
lodge	i
.	c

They	c
needed	c
one	c
person	c
for	i
putting	i
the	c
clothes	c
into	c
a	c
wardrobe	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
the	c
lodge	i
of	c
Mylene	c
Farmer	c
.	c

Are	i
you	i
thinking	i
?	c

All	i
were	i
very	c
kindly	i
and	c
pleasant	c
.	c

Finally	i
these	i
people	c
are	c
like	c
us	c
,	c
they	c
have	i
just	i
a	c
special	c
job	c
with	c
special	i
times	i
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

Love	c
,	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
just	c
for	c
the	i
reason	c
,	c
to	c
inform	c
you	c
how	c
bad	c
became	i
the	c
present	c
,	i
name	i
"	c
OVER	c
THE	c
RAINBOW	c
"	c
.	c

But	c
,	c
the	c
principal	c
reason	c
of	i
this	c
letter	c
is	c
to	c
ask	c
for	c
some	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
could	i
be	c
the	i
best	c
for	c
everyone	c
,	c
and	c
I	i
'll	i
like	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
an	i
advice	c
,	i
if	c
somebody	c
pay	i
you	c
for	c
a	c
ticket	c
,	c
try	c
to	c
give	c
the	c
best	c
you	c
can	c
.	c

Hope	i
hearing	i
from	c
you	c
.	c

Unfortunatety	i
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

Every	c
day	c
after	c
having	c
dinner	c
Pat	c
,	c
his	c
best	c
friend	c
,	c
and	c
my	c
grandpa	c
met	c
to	c
talk	c
about	c
their	c
problems	c
,	c
but	c
my	c
Grandpa	c
never	c
told	c
Pat	c
about	c
his	c
new	c
project	c
.	c

One	c
month	c
later	c
,	c
his	c
worked	i
was	c
complete	c
,	c
but	c
he	c
was	c
afraid	c
of	i
testing	i
his	c
machine	c
,	c
so	c
he	c
called	c
Pat	c
and	c
spoke	c
about	i
it	c
.	c

The	c
machine	c
worked	c
really	c
good	i
.	c

The	c
fact	c
was	c
that	c
Pat	c
choose	i
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
year	c
2000	c
,	c
and	c
when	c
he	c
arrived	c
,	c
he	c
told	c
every	i
one	i
that	c
he	c
was	c
the	c
inventor	c
.	c

The	c

I	c
worked	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
to	c
help	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
very	c
hard	c
.	c

The	c
singers	c
often	c
changed	c
them	i
clothes	c
and	c
them	i
make-up	c
was	c
easy	i
to	i
be	i
off	i
because	c
of	c
the	c
sweat	c
.	c

In	i
front	i
of	i
the	i
stage	i
was	i
so	i
many	i
people	i
and	c
they	c
could	c
n't	c
see	c
them	c
very	c
well	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
was	c
at	i
very	c
near	c
from	i
the	c
stage	c
and	c
I	c
could	c
see	c
them	c
just	c
there	c
.	c

You	c
like	c
pop	c
music	c
,	c
do	c
n't	c

So	c

Anyway	c

School	c
days	c

As	i
known	i
,	c
every	i
body	i
have	i
to	c
spend	c
all	c
the	i
childhood	c
and	c
youth	c
at	c
the	i
school	c
,	c
because	c
that	i
everybody	c
have	i
a	c
similar	c
daily	c
life	c
such	c
as	c
,	c
wake	c
up	c
,	c

to	c
the	c
school	c
,	c
study	c
and	c
the	c
best	c
,	c
meet	c
all	c
the	c
friends	c
.	c

A	c
survey	c
has	c
been	c
done	c
,	c
and	c
the	c
issue	c
is	c
,	i
wich	i
subjects	c
(	c
lessons	c
)	c
and	c
activities	c
the	c
students	c
thinks	i
are	c
the	c
most	c
enjoyables	i
.	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
this	c
letter	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
show	c
which	c
I	c
saw	c
in	i
your	c
theatre	c
.	c

During	c
staying	i
in	c
London	c
,	c
I	c
had	i
read	i
your	c
advertisement	c
and	c
planned	c
to	c
enjoy	c
seeing	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
expected	c
that	c
I	c
could	i
have	c
spend	i
a	c
wonderful	c
night	c
.	c

But	c
it	c
was	c
completely	c
different	c
one	i
which	i
I	c
had	c
expected	c
.	c

Can	c
you	c
imagine	c
how	c
disappointed	c
I	c
was	c
when	c
I	c
saw	c
the	i
different	c
actors	c
on	c
the	c
stage	c
?	c

According	c
to	c
the	c
advertisement	c
the	c
show	c
is	i
to	c
start	c
at	c
19:30	c
.	c

Could	i
you	c
understand	c
how	c
boring	c
it	c
was	c
just	c
sitting	c
with	c
nothing	c
to	c
do.	i
?	c

You	c
mention	c
about	i
discounts	c
,	c
too	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
the	c
chef	c
was	c
sick	c
!	c

I	c
felt	c
so	c
uncomfortable	c
and	c
the	c
night	c
was	c
not	c
perfect	c
at	c
all	c
.	c

I	c
insist	c
you	c
should	i
refund	c
all	c
the	c
money	c
that	c
I	c
wasted	c
in	c
your	c
theatre	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

Modern	c
technology	c
has	c
really	c
changed	c
our	c
daily	c
life	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
we	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
to	c
wash	c
our	c
face	c
with	c
cold	c
water	c
even	c
if	c
it	c
is	c
freezing	i
morning	c
.	c

We	c
can	c
live	c
in	c
a	c
clean	c
and	c
comfortably	c
air-conditioned	c
house	c
.	c

The	c
housekeeping	i
work	i
does	c
n't	c
take	c
much	c
time	c
thanks	c
to	c
electrical	c
equipments	i
.	c

And	c
we	c
can	c
speak	c
to	c
anyone	c
at	c
anytime	c
on	c
a	c
phone	c
even	c
if	c
he	c
or	c
she	c
is	c
abroad	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
,	c
we	c
can	c
travel	c
to	i
anywhere	c
in	c
the	c
world	c
within	i
a	c
few	c
days	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
must	c
accept	c
that	c
there	c
are	c
some	c
disadvantages	c
caused	i
by	i
the	i
technology	c
,	c
as	c
well	c
.	c

In	i
these	i
days	c
,	c
many	c
kinds	c
of	c
pollution	c
have	c
been	c
caused	c
by	c
our	c
modern	c
life	i
.	c

Air	c
pollution	c
by	i
cars	c
,	c
Soil	c
pollution	c
by	i
industrial	c
wastes	i
.	c

The	c
sea	c
is	c
also	c
polluted	c
by	c
oil	c
and	c
chemical	i
detergent	i
which	c
is	i
used	c
at	i
home	i
.	c

Even	c
food	c
is	c
polluted	c
.	c

All	c
these	c
facts	c
mean	c
that	c
our	c
modern	c
life	c
gives	i
big	i
damage	c
to	c
the	c
earth	c
.	c

All	c
of	c
us	c
must	c
notice	c
this	c
fact	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
your	c
advertisement	c
which	c
inform	i
me	c
wrong	c
information	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
fan	c
of	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
so	c
your	c
advert	c
attracted	c
me	c
but	c
when	c
I	c
went	c
there	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
was	c
in	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
instead	c
of	c
him	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
so	c
disappointed	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
your	c
timetable	c
was	c
wrong	c
.	c

It	c
said	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
at	c
14.30	c
but	c
,	c
actually	c
,	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
20.15	c
so	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
wait	c
for	c
about	c
six	c
hours	c
.	c

Thirdly	c
,	c
I	c
saw	c
"	c
Discount	c
Available	c
"	c
on	c
your	c
advert	c
but	c
your	c
staffs	i
said	c
it	c
was	c
just	c
for	c
Mondays	c
.	c

Your	c
advert	c
promised	c
me	c
"	i
Perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
"	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
terrible	i
evening	c
to	i
me	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
want	c
you	c
to	c
give	c
me	c
a	c
refund	c
.	c

Looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c

How	c
has	c
mordern	i
technology	c
changed	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
?	c

When	c
I	c
was	c
young	c
,	c
I	c
used	c
to	c
play	c

as	c

with	c
my	c
friends	c
but	c
,	c
these	c
days	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
getting	c
used	c
to	c
sitting	c
in	c
front	c
of	c
the	c
computer	c
and	c
watching	c
TV	c
.	c

Sometimes	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
computer	c
addict	c
because	c
whenever	c
I	c
come	c
back	c
home	c
,	c
my	c
hand	c
go	i
to	c
computer	i
swich	i
,	c
automaticaly	i
,	c
even	c
though	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
want	c
to	c
use	c
the	c
computer	c
.	c

After	c
that	c
,	c
I	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
sofa	c
for	i
watch	i
TV	c
.	c

Although	c
there	c
are	c
n't	c
programmes	c
which	c
are	c
interesting	c
,	c
I	c
just	c
watch	c
TV	c
,	c
so	c
my	c
mother	c
calls	c
me	c
"	c
Couch	c
Potato	c
"	c
.	c

As	c
a	c
result	c
,	c
my	c
health	c
is	c
getting	c
worse	c
.	c

Mr.	c
Jones	c
:	c

I	c
recive	i
a	c
paper	i
where	i
I	c
was	c
told	c
about	c
a	c
play	c
you	c
are	c
presenting	i
and	c
of	c
the	c
advantages	c
I	c
would	c
recive	i
if	c
I	c
go	i
to	c
see	c
it	c
,	i
think	i
that	c
never	i
happend	i
.	c

Second	c
,	c
it	c
says	c
that	c
the	c
play	c
would	c
start	c
at	c
19:30	c
,	c
and	c
it	c
realy	i
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
.	c

You	c
can	i
see	i
that	c
you	c
promise	i
me	c
I	i
'll	i
have	c
a	c
good	c
evening	c
and	c
I	c
realy	i
do	i
n't	i
have	i
it	i
.	c

So	c
I	c
suggest	c
,	i
you	c
give	c
me	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
,	c
or	c
I	c
would	i
go	c
to	c
the	c
police	c
,	c
because	c
you	c
lie	i
to	c
me	c
and	c
you	c
know	c
what	c
it	i
means	c
.	c

I	c
write	c
this	c
letter	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
about	c
the	c
program	i
that	c
tomorrow	i
starts	i
,	c
about	c
that	c
exelent	i
book	c
I	c
have	c
told	c
you	c
to	c
read	c
.	c

The	c
story	c
shows	c
you	c
the	c
life	c
that	c
many	c
people	c
have	c
to	c
deal	c
every	i
day	c
.	c

Shows	i
you	c
how	c
they	c
affront	i
it	c
and	c
what	c
is	i
life	i
,	c
real	c
life	c
.	c

The	c
book	c
is	c
very	c
easy	c
to	c
read	c
,	c
but	c
if	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
time	c
I	c
recomended	i
to	i
listen	i
the	i
program	i
.	c

I	c
have	c
been	c
told	c
that	c
they	c
will	c
interview	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
people	c
of	i
different	i
part	i
that	c
have	c
read	c
the	c
book	c
,	c
and	c
tell	i
their	i
experience	c
.	c

Also	c
,	c
that	c
they	c
would	i
invite	c
psicologist	i
,	c
the	c
Autor	i
of	c
the	c
book	c
and	c
may	i
be	i
the	c
president	c
would	i
talk	c
so	c
I	c
recommend	c
you	c
to	i
hear	i
it	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
listen	c
to	c
it	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
thing	i
that	c
if	c
you	c
want	c
to	c
become	c
a	i
M.P.	c
,	c
it	c
will	c
teach	c
you	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
thing	i
,	c
and	c
you	c
would	i
learn	c
more	c
about	c
England	i
reality	c
.	c

your	c
friend	c
for	c
ever	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
competition	i
which	c
was	c
organised	c
by	c
your	c
agency	c
and	c
I	c
must	c
say	c
that	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
surprised	c
when	c
I	c
received	c
the	c
result	c
of	c
the	c
competition	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
rather	i
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
the	i
tent	c
than	c
to	i
stay	i
in	c
the	c
log	c
cabin	c
because	c
the	i
tent	c
is	c
more	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

Should	c
I	c
take	c
my	c
clothes	c
with	c
me	c
or	c
are	c
they	c
arranged	i
in	c
the	c
camp	c
placement	i
?	c

Dear	c
Kim	c

I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
about	c
what	i
exciting	c
experience	c
I	c
had	c
last	c
month	c
during	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
.	c

I	c
wish	c
you	c
were	i
there	c
and	c
saw	i
the	c
concert	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
really	c
brilliant	c
.	c

The	c
concert	c
tickets	c
were	c
very	c
expensive	c
and	c
I	c
'd	c
seen	c
an	c
adversitement	i
on	c
the	i
tv.	i
It	c
said	c
,	c
"	c
be	i
a	c
valunteer	i
for	i
our	c
concert	c
and	c
get	c
a	c
free	c
ticket	c
"	i
.	i

You	c
should	c
have	c
seen	c
,	i
there	c
was	c
really	i
terrible	c
rush	c
before	c
concert	i
and	c
everybody	c
was	c
runing	i
around	c
to	i
do	i
something	c
.	c

I	c
helped	c
to	c
carry	c
huge	c
speakers	c
to	c
the	c
concert	c
venue	c
.	c

Than	i
I	c
was	c
told	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
front	c
of	c
the	c
entrance	c
door	i
and	c
check	c
the	c
tickets	c
.	c

Love	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Brown	c
,	c

We	c
are	c
writing	c
to	c
invite	c
you	c
and	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
some	c
information	c
about	c
the	c
party	c
.	c

All	c
our	c
class	c
love	c
Mr	c
Brown	c
very	c
much	c
,	c
so	c
we	c
decided	c
to	c
organise	c
a	c
surprise	c
party	c
for	c
him	c
.	c

You	c
should	c
come	c
on	i
3	i
pm	i
in	i
college	i
Canteen	i
.	c

We	c
have	c
bought	c
some	c
snaks	i
to	c
eat	c
and	c
three	c
students	c
will	c
sing	c
for	c
him	c
,	c
also	i
.	c

Besides	c
this	c
,	c
we	c
have	c
invited	c
all	c
other	i
teachers	c
and	c
the	c
Principal	c
of	c
our	c
school	c
.	c

Of	c
course	c
all	c
the	c
class	c
will	c
take	c
party	i
to	i
this	c
party	c
.	c

Furthermore	i
,	c
we	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
what	c
present	c
buying	i
for	c
him	c
.	c

So	c
we	c
would	c
appreciate	c
if	i
you	c
help	i
us	c
with	c
this	c
matter	c
.	c

We	c
have	c
thought	c
to	i
buy	i
a	c
cd	i
or	c
a	c
book	c
.	c

He	c
loves	c
to	c
read	c
books	c
.	c

What	c
do	c
you	c
believe	i
?	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Especially	i
younger	i
's	i
life	i
has	i
been	c
very	c
difficult	c
the	i
last	c
years	i
.	c

They	c
know	c
the	c
way	c
to	c
do	c
this	c
.	c

And	c
the	c
way	c
is	c
love	c
.	c

Apart	c
from	c
this	c
,	c
parents	c
could	c
be	c
very	c
helpful	c
to	c
their	c
children	c
with	i
difficulties	c
of	i
school	c
.	c

They	c
help	c
their	c
children	c
with	c
lessons	c
and	c
give	c
them	c
some	c
useful	c
advice	c
with	c
their	c
relationships	c
.	c

Because	c
sometimes	c
they	c
are	c
upset	c
when	c
they	c
lose	c
a	c
friend	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
friends	c
are	c
not	c
suitable	c
to	i
do	i
this	c
.	c

There	c
is	c
a	c
chance	c
not	i
to	i
be	i
so	i
good	c
friends	c
and	c
imitate	i
that	c
they	c
are	c
.	c

So	c
we	c
should	c
trust	c
only	c
our	c
family	c
when	c
we	c
need	c
help	c
or	c
solutions	c
of	i
our	c
problems	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
.	i

I	c
've	c
just	c
recived	i
your	c
leter	i
,	c
and	c
I	c
must	c
say	c
that	c
I	c
am	c
so	c
surprised	c
,	i
I	c
was	c
n't	c
expecting	c
to	c
win	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
still	i
studing	i
at	c
the	c
moment	c
I	c
will	c
finish	c
at	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
June	c
so	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
leave	c
at	c
the	c
begining	i
of	c
July	c
.	c

About	i
the	c
acomodation	i
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
instead	c
of	c
a	c
tent	c
so	c
as	c
to	c
get	c
a	c
better	c
rest	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
rather	c
trained	i
in	i
climbing	c
,	i
I	c
have	c
done	c
it	c
once	c
a	c
mounth	i
since	c
I	c
was	c
17	c
.	c

But	c
in	i
the	i
other	i
hand	i
,	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
done	i
surfing	c
,	i
I	c
am	c
a	c
completely	i
Beginer	i
but	c
I	c
am	c
dieing	i
to	c
do	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
've	c
got	c
just	c
one	c
question	c
to	c
do	i
,	i
I	c
know	c
it	c
is	c
all	c
include	i
,	c
but	c
is	c
there	c
anything	c
I	c
will	c
have	c
to	c
pay	c
for	c
?	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
we	c
should	c
have	c
a	c
protagonist	c
for	c
it	c
.	c

A	c
good	c
idea	c
to	c
start	c
will	c
be	c
a	i
clock	i
alarm	i
ringing	c
close	c
to	c
his	c
bed	c
,	c
because	c
that	c
's	c
the	c
way	c
everyone	c
get	i
up	c
in	c
the	c
morning	c
,	i
(	c
unless	i
the	c
people	c
who	c
do	c
n't	c
do	c
anythink	i
)	c

After	c
that	c
,	c
we	c
should	c
have	c
a	c
morning	c
view	i
of	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
most	i
busiest	i
London	c
tube	c
station	i
in	c
order	c
to	c
show	c
stressed	c
people	c
going	c
in	c
and	c
out	c
,	c
Including	i
our	c
protagonist	c
going	i
out	i
peacefully	c
with	c
a	c
couple	c
of	c
books	c
on	i
his	c
hand	c
-	c
then	c
the	c
school	c
's	c
door	c
,	c
and	c
him	c
going	c
in	c
.	c

After	c
all	i
this	c
introduction	c
,	c
will	i
be	c
the	i
time	c
to	c
show	c
some	c
of	c
the	c
acitivities	i
every	i
one	i
can	c
join	i
in	i
the	c
school	c
,	c
such	i
as	i
lesons	i
or	i
others	i
like	i
the	i
library	i
,	i
our	i
protagonist	i
having	i
a	i
cofe	i
with	i
some	i
coleagues	i
in	i
the	i
cofe	i
bar	i
,	i
the	i
reception	i
service.	i
.	c

And	c
finally	c
a	c
view	i
of	c
all	c
the	c
students	c
leaving	c
the	c
school	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
nice	c
end	i
.	c

Anyway	c
,	c
to	c
participate	c
in	c
two-weeks	c
Camp	i
California	c
in	c
the	c
U.S.A	c
I	c
readily	c
give	c
you	c
my	c
personal	c
details	c
and	c
information	c
.	c

Additionally	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
happy	c
to	c
be	c
given	c
the	c
chance	c
to	c
do	c
some	c
activities	c
during	c
the	c
stay	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
willingly	i
like	c
to	c
choose	c
swimming	c
and	c
painting	c
.	c

I	c
used	c
to	c
belong	c
to	c
a	c
swimming	c
club	c
and	c
practise	c
swimming	c
a	c
couple	c
of	c
times	c
a	c
week	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
also	c
gone	c
in	c
for	c
some	c
competitions	c
.	c

Last	c
but	c
not	c
at	c
least	c
,	c
what	c
sort	c
of	c
clothes	c
do	c
you	c
think	c
I	c
must	c
bring	c
with	c
me	c
,	c
and	c
is	c
there	c
any	c
laundry	c
system	c
there	c
?	c

Also	c
should	c
I	c
take	c
some	c
money	c
just	c
in	c
case	c
?	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
be	c
very	c
grateful	c
for	c
your	c
help	c

Introduction	c

According	c
to	c
statistics	c
based	c
on	c
the	c
questionnair	i
,	c
the	c
majority	c
of	c
students	c
feel	c
the	c
most	c
enthusiasm	c
for	c
an	c
English	c
class	c
.	c

This	c
may	c
be	c
thanks	c
to	c
native	i
speaker	i
teachers	c
who	c
came	c
to	c
the	c
school	c
last	c
year	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
less	i
numbers	i
of	i
students	c
were	c
nodding	c
off	c
comparing	i
with	c
other	c
classes	c
like	c
Maths	c
.	c

Consequently	c
it	i
might	c
be	c
a	c
good	c
idea	c
to	c
film	c
the	c
English	c
class	c
so	c
that	c
the	c
vibrant	c
and	c
active	c
atomosphere	i
may	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
be	c
filmed	c
.	c

This	c
may	c
also	c
contribute	c
to	c
the	c
promotion	c
of	c
English	i
department	c
.	c

As	c
the	c
record	c
says	c
,	c
our	c
hockey	c
team	c
has	c
been	c
on	i
the	c
top	c
of	c
the	c
league	c
for	c
three	c
successive	c
years	c
.	c

Although	c
every	c
school	c
has	c
a	c
boys	c
'	c
football	c
team	c
,	c
our	c
school	c
is	c
the	c
only	c
one	c
which	c
possesses	c
a	c
girls	c
'	c
team	c
.	c

Team	c
members	c
can	c
be	c
interviewed	c
.	c

The	c
whole	c
point	c
of	c
making	c
a	c
video	c
is	c
to	c
tell	c
people	c
that	c
we	c
are	c
not	c
only	c
bugs	i
of	i
books	i
but	c
also	c
enjoying	c
our	c
school	c
life	c
.	c

It	c
might	c
also	c
be	c
a	c
good	c
idea	c
to	c
film	c
our	c
computing	c
rooms	c
and	c
sports	c
facilities	c
that	c
we	c
can	c
be	c
proud	c
of	c
.	c

London	c
17	c
June	c
2000	c

I	c
recently	c
had	c
a	c
week	c
's	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
to	c
see	c
a	c
musical	c
show	i
'	i
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
'	c
at	i
'	c
The	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
'	c
,	c
where	c
you	c
are	c
the	c
manager	c
.	c

The	c
second	c
point	c
,	c
the	c
principal	c
actor	c
was	c
changed	c
.	c

The	c
third	c
point	c
was	c
that	c
the	c
discounts	i
tickets	c
were	c
unavailable	c
and	c
finally	i
,	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
the	c
oven	c
was	c
broken	c
and	c
we	c
could	c
n't	c
enjoy	c
there	i
after	c
the	c
musical	c
show	i
.	c

I	c
hope	c
to	c
have	c
news	c
about	i
you	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c

SEBASTIAN	c

The	i
science	i
and	c
technology	c
have	c
changed	c
my	c
life	i
every	i
day	i
.	c

The	i
modern	i
technologies	i
are	i
used	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
at	c
home	c
,	c
at	c
school	c
or	c
working	i
.	c

When	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
child	c
I	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
,	c

I	c
spent	c
a	c
week	c
's	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
and	c
I	c
had	c
been	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
watching	i
a	c
wonderful	c
show	c
in	c
your	c
theatre	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
completely	c
disappointed	c
with	c
that	i
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
although	c
I	c
bought	c
a	c
ticket	c
for	c
19:30	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
there	c
was	i
no	c
discounts	c
despite	c
you	i
showed	i
it	i
was	i
available	c
in	c
your	c
advertisement	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
the	c
employees	c
were	c
on	c
the	i
strike	c
.	c

When	c
we	c
think	c
about	c
clothes	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
,	c
we	c
should	c
think	c
about	c
the	c
enviroment	i
first	c
.	c

What	c
will	c
it	c
be	c
like	c
in	c
2100	c
?	c

It	c
is	c
not	c
pleasant	c
to	c
say	c
the	c
earth	c
is	c
now	c
facing	c
some	c
serious	c
problems	c
.	c

Air-pollution	c
might	c
become	c
more	c
serious	i
than	c
now	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
and	c
destruction	i
of	c
ozon-zone	i
could	i
not	i
be	i
stopped	i
in	i
100	i
years	i
.	c

Considering	c
these	c
elements	i
,	c
we	c
should	c
wear	c
clothes	c
which	c
can	c
protect	c
us	c
from	c
certain	c
kind	i
of	c
sun	i
rays	i
and	c
air	c
pollution	c
.	c

I	c
suppose	c
they	c
would	c
be	c
like	c
a	i
arm-suits	i
.	c

Of	c
course	c
,	c
technologies	i
will	c
have	c
developped	i
enough	c
to	i
invent	c
new	c
material	c
for	c
those	c
kind	i
of	c
clothes	c
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
clothes	i
after	i
100	i
years	i
will	c
not	c
as	i
fashionable	c
as	c
they	c
are	c
now	c
.	c

We	c
should	c
consider	c
wearing	i
as	i
in	i
more	i
practical	i
way	i
.	c

I	c
have	c
just	c
returned	c
from	c
my	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

During	c
my	c
stay	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
see	c
a	c
musical	c
show	c
in	i
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
and	c
I	c
have	i
very	i
disappointing	c
evening	c
.	c

What	c
is	c
more	c
you	i
advertize	i
there	c
were	c
discounts	c
available	c
but	c
it	i
were	c
not	c
.	c

You	c
said	c
that	c
the	c
musicial	i
show	c
started	c
at	c
19.30	c
but	c
recently	i
it	c
began	c
at	c
20.15	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
bored	c
because	c
I	c
did	c
not	c
have	c
anything	c
to	c
do	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
waiting	c
for	c
your	c
show	c
.	c

Additionally	c
I	c
felt	c
very	c
hungry	c
and	c
uncomfortable	c
because	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
and	c
you	c
did	c
not	c
give	c
us	c
any	c
reason	c
why	c
.	c

You	c
promised	c
us	c
a	c
big	c
show	c
and	c
perfect	i
evening	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
only	c
an	c
average	c
show	c
with	c
unknown	c
actors	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
you	i
are	c
not	c
very	c
respectful	i
and	c
responsible	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
foward	i
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Your	i
faithfully	c
,	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
had	i
16	c
years	c
old	c
I	c
fell	c
in	c
love	c
with	c
the	c
most	c
hundsom	i
boy	c
in	c
our	c
school	c
.	c

Paul	c
was	c
older	c
than	c
me	c
and	c
he	c
was	i
playing	i
basketball	c
.	c

Everything	c
was	c
great	c
.	c

But	c
when	c
Pat	c
drank	c
some	c
beer	c
she	c
told	c
him	c
everything	c
about	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
angry	c
and	c
I	c
run	i
away	c
to	c
the	c
forest	c
.	c

'	c
She	c
was	c
my	c
best	c
friend	c
,	c
how	c
can	c
she	c
do	c
it	c
to	c
me	c
'	i
-	c
-	c
I	c
was	c
crying	c
.	c

We	c
started	c
to	c
talk	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
sorry	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
,	i
that	c
I	c
'm	c
really	c
disappointed	c
of	i
your	c
advertisment	i
for	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
in	i
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
really	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
see	i
one	c
of	c
my	c
favourite	c
actors	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
in	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
but	c
you	c
had	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
,	c
what	i
disappointed	c
me	c
very	c
much	c
.	c

Also	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
did	c
n't	c
start	c
in	i
time	c
,	c
it	c
started	c
half	c
an	c
hour	c
later	i
.	c

After	c
the	c
show	c
we	c
wanted	c
to	c
visit	c
the	c
restaurant	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
of	c
painting-works	i
inside	c
the	c
restaurant	c
.	c

Finally	c
we	c
had	i
no	i
perfect	i
evening	c
at	c
all	c
!	c

And	c
of	i
these	c
circumstands	i
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
part	c
of	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
understand	c
my	c
concern	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

We	c
lost	c
the	c
others	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
so	c
worried	c
not	i
to	i
find	i
the	c
way	c
out	c
,	i
that	c
I	c
started	c
to	c
scream	c
and	c
cry	c
.	c

First	c
,	c
Pat	c
started	c
to	c
laugh	c
,	c
but	c
as	c
he	c
realized	c
,	i
that	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
stop	c
crying	c
,	c
he	c
comfort	i
me	c
until	c
I	c
was	i
calming	i
down	c
.	c

And	c
after	c
a	c
while	c
we	c
found	c
the	c
way	c
out	c
.	c

I	c
ask	i
him	c
,	i
not	c
to	c
tell	c
anybody	c
that	c
I	c
cried	c
.	c

He	c
said	c
,	c
'	c
shure	i
no	i
problem	c
'	c
.	c

But	c
next	c
day	c
,	c
back	c
in	c
the	c
classroom	c
,	c
some	c
of	c
the	c
students	c
looked	c
at	c
me	c
and	c
started	c
to	c
laugh	c
.	c

After	c
that	c
was	i
all	c
clear	c
,	c
Pat	c
and	c
secrets	c
.	c

As	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
happy	c
to	c
receive	c
your	c
last	c
letter	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
at	c
the	c
concert	c
when	c
I	c
met	c
a	c
friend	c
of	c
mine	c
whose	c
job	c
is	c
to	c
organise	c
shows	c
like	c
that	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
known	i
I	i
can	c
do	c
a	c
little	c
of	c
everything	c
so	c
I	c
accepted	c
.	c

I	c
connected	c
wires	c
,	c
I	c
caried	i
loudspeakers	c
,	c
and	c
so	c
on	c
.	c

When	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
I	c
was	c
on	c
the	c
stage	c
close	c
to	c
famous	i
singers	c
,	c
Bono	c
Vox	c
and	c
David	c
Bowie	c
.	c

Towards	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
the	c
concert	c
I	c
hansled	i
a	c
bottle	c
of	c
wine	c
to	c
Poolo	c
Conte	c
.	c

Poolo	c
Conte	c
asked	c
me	c
to	c
drink	c
with	c
Him	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
know	c
He	i
's	i
my	c
favorite	i
singer	c
.	c

We	c
started	c
talking	c
about	c
music	c
and	c
I	c
asked	c
Him	i
many	c
things	c
about	c
His	i
texts	i
,	c
which	c
are	c
beautiful	c
but	c
sometimes	c
difficult	c
to	c
understand	c
.	c

I	i
think	i
I	i
wo	i
n't	i
never	i
forget	i
that	i
evening	i
.	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
reply	c
your	i
letter	c
about	c
my	i
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
and	c
give	i
you	c
all	c
information	i
for	c
my	c
two	c
weeks	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
prefer	i
travelling	c
in	c
July	c
,	c
because	c
it	i
will	c
be	c
my	i
school	i
vacation	c
and	c
I	c
'm	c
not	c
allowed	c
to	c
travel	c
during	c
school	i
times	i
.	c

It	c
'd	c
be	c
great	c
if	c
I	c
could	c
be	i
accommodated	i
in	c
tents	i
,	c
because	c
I	c
've	c
never	c
slept	c
in	c
tents	i
before	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
an	c
interesting	c
experience	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
already	c
surfed	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
travelling	c
in	c
Brazil	c
,	c
but	c
since	c
them	i
I	c
have	i
had	i
n't	i
a	c
chance	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
again	c
.	c

Is	c
there	c
any	c
problem	c
?	c

I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
some	c
questions	c
:	c
Is	i
necessary	i
bring	i
money	i
to	c
the	c
Camp	c
?	c

How	c
much	c
?	c

And	c
about	c
clothes	c
?	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
the	i
great	c
opportunity	c
I	i
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c

Shopping	c
is	c
said	c
that	i
an	c
enjoyable	c
programme	i
in	c
all	c
situations	c
.	c

When	c
you	c
go	c
to	c
a	c
sale	i
shop	c
it	c
is	c
dificult	i
to	c
find	c
what	c
you	c
look	i
for	c
without	c
a	i
help	c
of	c
the	c
shop	c
assistant	c

The	c
problem	c
is	c
find	i
a	c
shop	c
assistant	c
who	c
hear	i
your	i
problems	c
and	c
can	c
help	c
you	c

You	c
ca	c

to	c

to	c
give	c
him	c
suggestions	c
to	i

business	c

To	c
conclude	c

although	c
you	c
can	c
have	c
good	c
moments	i
while	c
shopping	c
all	c
of	c
us	c
know	c
that	c
it	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
,	c
is	i
n't	i
it	i
?	c

Dear	c
Ms.	c
Ryan	c
,	c

For	c
this	c
reason	c
I	c
am	c
afraid	c
I	c
wo	c
n't	c
be	c
allowed	c
to	c
chose	i
the	c
period	i
for	i
my	c
holidays	c
.	c

Consequently	c
I	c
hope	c
that	c
is	i
possible	c
to	c
join	c
the	c
camp	c
during	c
the	c
last	c
two	c
weeks	c
of	c
July	c
,	c
when	c
the	c
company	c
I	c
work	c
with	i
suspends	c
its	c
activities	c
.	c

As	c
far	c
as	c
I	c
am	c
concerned	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
an	i
accomodation	i
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
,	c
but	c
in	c
case	c
there	c
are	c
no	c
cabins	c
left	c
I	c
can	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
tend	i
as	c
well	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
already	c
know	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
trying	c
to	c
become	c
a	c
professional	c
photographer	c
,	c
consequently	c
I	c
would	c
choose	c
photograpy	i
as	c
the	c
first	c
activities	i
and	c
painting	c
as	c
the	c
second	c
.	c

However	c
I	i
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
if	c
by	c
any	c
chance	c
the	c
photograpy	i
activities	c
are	c
only	c
for	c
beginners	c
.	c

In	c
this	c
case	c
I	c
would	c
rather	c
do	c
some	c
climbing	c
,	c
which	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
done	c
before	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	i

Shopping	c

Actualy	i
most	c
people	c
work	c
hard	c
to	c
earn	c
their	c
money	c
and	c
consequently	c
,	c
the	c
occasion	c
in	i
which	c
this	c
money	c
is	c
spent	c
to	c
buy	c
something	c
useful	c
,	c
or	c
simply	c
something	c
they	c
like	c
,	c
should	c
be	c
considered	c
a	c
very	c
pleasant	c
situation	i
.	c

In	c
fact	c
,	c
the	c
shopping	c
you	c
do	c
for	c
the	i
daily	c
needs	c
is	c
seldom	c
enjouble	i
,	c
as	c
it	c
is	c
clearly	c
more	c
a	c
duty	c
than	c
a	c
pleasure	c
and	c
morover	i
you	c
are	c
often	c
faced	c
with	c
some	c
nasty	c
situations	c
.	c

Shops	c
and	c
markets	c
are	c
often	c
noisy	c
and	c
crowded	c
,	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
where	c
to	c
park	c
your	c
car	c
,	c
shop	c
assistants	c
are	c
rude	c
and	c
sometimes	c
they	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
how	c
to	c
do	c
their	c
job	c
.	c

Anyway	c
if	c
you	c
can	c
choose	c
the	c
time	c
and	c
the	c
place	c
,	c
and	c
if	c
you	c
go	c
shopping	c
just	c
because	c
you	c
like	c
it	c
,	c
and	c
not	c
because	c
you	c
need	c
it	i
,	c
shopping	c
can	c
be	c
a	c
very	c
nice	c
activity	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr/Mrs	i
,	c

I	c
must	c
say	c
that	c
International	i
Arts	c
Festival	c
is	c
really	c
great	i
idea	c
.	c

Your	c
dance	c
shows	c
are	c
very	c
beautiful	c
,	c
art	i
exhibitions	i
is	c
something	c
original	c
and	c
exciting	c
.	c

And	c
also	c
it	c
is	c
very	c
interesting	c
to	c
talk	c
with	c
writers	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
one	c
reasonably-priced	c
weekend	c
for	i
all	c
events	c
is	c
exellent	i
idea	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
n't	c
so	c
Expensive	i
as	c
buying	c
ticket	i
to	i
each	c
event	c
,	c
and	c
with	c
this	c
ticket	c
you	c
can	c
visit	c
everything	c
you	c
want	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
will	c
continue	c
to	i
making	i
your	c
festivals	c
.	c

Dear	c
Tom	c
,	c

How	c
are	c
you	c
?	c

The	c
question	c
you	c
asked	c
me	c
in	c
it	c
is	c
very	c
original	c
too	c
.	c

I	c
must	c
say	c
that	c
rules	i
are	c
n't	c
same	i
in	c
schools	i
of	c
our	c
country	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
my	c
school	c
is	c
very	c
democratic	c
and	c
so	c
there	c
are	c
very	c
good	c
relations	c
between	c
teachers	c
and	c
students	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
allowed	c
to	c
do	c
many	c
things	c
at	c
home	c
.	c

My	c
parents	c
are	c
very	c
kind	c
,	c
and	c
they	c
know	c
that	c
their	c
son	c
will	c
do	c
everything	c
right	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
everything	c
is	c
good	c
in	c
your	c
family	c
and	c
your	c
school	c
.	c

Dear	c
Manager	c
of	c
the	c
theatre	c
:	c

It	c
could	i
make	i
things	c
worse	c
that	c
the	i
visit	c
to	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
,	c
which	c
had	c
already	c
been	c
closed	c
because	c
of	c
lack	i
of	c
customers	c
,	c
was	c
canceled	i
.	c

However	i
,	c
what	c
a	c
let	i
down	i
!	c

I	c
would	c
be	c
grateful	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
give	c
the	i
money	c
back	c
.	c

How	c
has	c
modern	c
technology	c
changed	c
our	c
daily	c
life	c
.	i

Five	c
years	c
ago	c
,	c
you	c
could	c
be	c
proud	c
of	c
your	c
486	c
computer	c
,	c
which	c
can	i
only	c
be	c
put	c
inside	c
a	c
museum	c
as	c
an	c
antique	c
now	c
.	c

Then	c
how	c
does	i
it	c
changed	c
our	c
daily	c
life	c
?	c

Today	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
multi-choices	i
such	i
as	c
discman	i
(	c
CD	c
player	c
)	c
.	i

MD	c
walkman	c
and	c
MP3	c
player	c
,	c
which	c
are	c
considered	c
to	c
be	c
more	c
portable	c
and	c
have	c
better	i
timbre	i
.	c

Communication	i
has	i
been	i
more	i
conventional	i
,	i
we	c
can	c
simply	c
make	c
a	c
phone	c
call	c
,	c
sent	i
e-mails	c
or	c
faxes	c
instead	c
of	c
writing	c
letters	c
and	c
waiting	c
for	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
.	c

Especially	i
the	c
improvement	c
of	i
personal	c
computer	i
has	c
greatly	c
helped	c
the	c
spread	c
of	c
information	i
by	i
using	c
internet	i
,	c
you	c
can	c
book	i
newspaper	i
,	i
magazines	c
,	c
even	i
go	c
shopping	c
online	c
.	c

Therefore	c
,	c
our	c
life	c
has	c
been	c
influenced	c
and	c
changed	c
by	c
developing	i
of	c
technology	c
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
we	c
should	c
work	c
hard	c
to	c
learn	i
knowledges	i
,	i
making	i
the	c
future	c
better	c
and	c
better	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
and	c
your	c
organisation	c
for	c
giving	c
me	c
this	c
opportunity	c
.	c

I	c
've	c
just	c
received	c
your	c
letter	c
this	c
morning	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
happy	c
an	i
exciting	i
about	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
can	c
only	c
travel	c
during	c
July	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
many	i
A-levels	i
examinations	c
to	c
take	c
during	c
June	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
my	c
surfing	c
skill	i
is	c
very	c
average	c
as	c
I	c
have	c
only	c
been	c
surfing	c
for	c
three	c
months	c
.	c

First	i
question	c
is	c
how	c
many	c
and	c
what	c
type	c
of	c
clothes	c
do	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
with	c
me	c
?	c

Another	c
question	c
is	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
do	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
with	c
me	c
(	c
roughly	c
)	c
?	c

Dear	c

How	c
are	c
you	c

I	c
am	c

Remember	c
I	c
have	i
told	i
you	c
that	c
I	c
have	i
been	c
selected	c
to	c
help	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
of	c
a	c
local	c
band	c
?	c

It	c
was	c
last	c
month	c
that	c
I	c
was	c
selected	c
.	c

I	c
have	i
also	c
been	c
told	c
that	c
they	c
were	c
going	c
to	c
make	c
a	c
music	c
video	c
from	i
that	c
concert	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
tried	c
as	c
well	c
as	c
I	c
could	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
sure	c
that	c
I	c
'll	c
never	c
forget	c
that	c
moment	c
.	c

Love	c
,	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
according	i
to	i
your	c
letter	c
you	c
asked	c
me	c
my	c
prefered	i

If	c
it	c
is	c
possible	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
only	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
going	c
to	c
go	i
on	c
my	i
holiday	c
in	c
July	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
also	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
whether	c
someone	c
will	c
be	c
at	c
the	c
airport	c
for	c
me	c
because	c
this	c
will	c
be	c
the	i
first	c
time	c
in	c
the	c
U.S.A	c

Dear	c
Kim	c

I	c
was	c
happy	c
to	c
get	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

On	i
your	c
letter	c
,	c
you	c
want	c
to	c
hear	c
about	c
my	c
experience	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
.	c

I	c
'll	c
tell	c
you	c
my	i
experience	i
about	i
helping	c
the	i
pop	c
concert	c
.	c

At	c
first	c
,	c
I	c
applyed	i
for	i
the	i
volenteer	i
at	c
the	c
pop	c
concert	c
and	c
then	c
I	c
got	c
a	i
responsibility	c
for	c
control	i
the	c
audience	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
to	c
make	c
the	c
fan	i
to	i
keep	i
a	i
queue	c
.	c

I	c
also	c
make	i
them	c
find	c
their	c
seats	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
very	c
hard	c
working	i
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
I	c
always	c
spoke	c
loudly	c
and	c
run	i
fast	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
there	c
was	c
something	c
good	c
to	i
me	c
.	c

I	c
saw	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
singers	c
and	c
entertainers	c
.	c

Plus	c
,	c
I	c
got	c
a	i
authography	i
from	c
a	c
popular	c
singer	c
.	c

It	i
is	i
valuable	i
of	i
keeping	i
on	i
your	i
suvinier	i
.	i

Looking	c

to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c

Best	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Clark	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
to	c
give	c
some	c
opinion	i
about	c
the	c
International	c
Arts	c
Festival	c
that	c
you	c
have	i
organized	i
last	c
November	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
believe	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
very	c
interesting	c
,	c
but	c
there	c
were	c
few	i
artists	c
than	c
I	c
have	i
expected	c
.	c

In	c
fact	c
they	i
came	c
from	c
six	c
countries	c
.	c

In	c
fact	c
I	c
have	c
noticed	c
that	c
some	c
concert	i
need	i
to	i
more	c
space	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
interesting	c
to	c
invite	c
young	c
compositors	i
to	c
hear	c
news	i
from	c
the	i
classical	c
music	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
receiving	c
your	c
reply	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
.	c

Dear	c
Magda	c
,	c

how	c
are	c
you	c
?	c

Well	c
,	c
I	c
hope	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
country	c
there	c
are	c
some	c
rules	c
that	c
are	c
the	c
same	c
in	c
all	c
schools	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
we	c
have	c
to	c
wear	i
in	c
appropriate	i
way	c
,	c
not	c
talk	c
to	c
each	c
other	c
during	c
the	c
lessons	c
and	c
pay	c
attention	c
to	c
the	c
teachers	c
.	c

At	c
this	c
time	c
,	c
in	c
my	c
school	c
there	c
is	c
a	c
new	c
rule	c
.	c

We	c
are	c
n't	c
allowed	c
to	c
use	c
the	i
mobile	c
phone	c
in	c
class	c
.	c

Before	c
this	c
rule	c
it	c
was	c
funny	c
(	c
new	c
sound	c
in	c
class	c
,	c
phones	c
ring	c
or	c
sing.	c
)	c
,	c
but	c
not	c
for	c
our	c
headmaster	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
to	c
arrive	c
in	c
time	c
for	c
dinner	c
,	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
the	c
only	c
time	c
in	i
which	c
my	c
family	c
can	c
eat	c
together	c
.	c

For	c
me	c
,	c
it	c
's	c
very	c
stressfull	i
and	c
I	c
usually	c
run	c
a	c
lot	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
.	c

In	c
fact	c
(	c
you	c
know	c
)	c
I	c
like	c
cheat	i
with	c
my	c
class	i
mates	i
after	c
our	c
lessons	c
.	c

Neighbours	c
have	c
complained	c
about	c
loud	c
music	c
.	c

Love	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
happy	c
that	c
I	c
won	c
this	c
competition	c
.	c

My	c
holidays	c
will	c
finish	c
in	i
the	c
begining	i
of	c
September	c
and	c
will	i
be	c
good	c
to	c
travel	c
during	c
this	c
time	i
.	c

(	c
August-September	c
)	c
.	c

The	c
accommodation	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
tents	i
because	c
I	c
like	c
adventures	c
and	c
also	c
I	c
will	c
have	c
more	c
contact	c
with	c
the	i
nature	c
.	c

For	c
the	c
time	c
that	c
I	c
will	c
spend	c
there	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
chose	i
more	c
the	i
two	c
activities	c
but	c
I	c
know	c
is	i
not	c
possible	c
so	c
I	c
chose	i
swimming	c
and	c
singing	c
.	c

I	c
usualy	i
sing	c
in	c
my	c
spare	c
time	c
and	c
my	c
friends	c
love	c
when	i
I	c
sing	c
and	c
about	i
swimming	c
I	c
was	c
champion	c
last	c
year	c
in	c
my	c
city	c

I	c
am	c

Mrs	c
Clark	c
,	c

The	c
discovery	c
of	c
the	c
Ã´International	c
Arts	c
FestivalÃ¶	c
was	c
a	c
pleasure	c
for	c
me	c
because	c
it	c
gave	c
me	c
the	c
opportunity	c
to	c
enjoy	c
onto	i
a	c
really	c
nice	c
environment	c
.	c

Different	i
kinds	c
of	c
music	c
is	c
a	c
good	c
idea	c
but	c
some	c
of	c
them	c
need	c
special	c
features	c
.	c

The	c
aim	c
to	c
satisfy	c
different	c
interests	c
should	c
not	c
let	i
the	c
quality	c
decrease	i
.	c

Just	c
a	c
final	c
note	c
:	c
why	c
not	c
more	i
plays	c
and	c
films	c
for	i
the	i
next	c
year	c
?	c

Thanks	c
in	c
advance	c
for	c
your	c

)	c
,	i
is	c
the	c
most	c
traditional	c
way	c
but	c
also	c
the	c
safest	c
one	c

-	c
emprove	i
your	i
kindness	i
and	c
ask	c
for	c
works	i
in	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
some	c
of	c
my	c
information	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
have	c
some	c
further	c
information	c
on	c
the	c
camp	c
in	c
California	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
start	c
my	c
journey	i
on	i
the	c
second	c
week	c
of	c
July	c
because	c
I	c
will	c
have	c
a	c
3	i
weeks	i
holiday	c
in	c
July	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
not	c
travel	c
in	c
June	c
and	c
May	c
because	c
I	c
will	c
have	c
my	c
standard	c
grade	c
exam	c
during	c
these	c
two	c
months	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
keen	c
on	c
singing	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
sevral	i
singing	c
competitions	c
at	c
school	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
chosen	c
swimming	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
my	c
favourite	c
sport	c
.	c

I	c
enjoy	c
doing	c
it	c
very	c
much	c
.	c

I	c
note	c
that	c
all	c
accommodation	c
and	c
travel	c
costs	c
are	c
paid	c
for	i
,	c
but	c
does	c
it	c
include	c
my	c
expenses	c
in	c
California	c
?	c

I	c
would	c
be	c
grateful	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
send	c
me	c
some	c
information	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

How	c
are	c
you	c
?	c

How	c
are	c
you	c
getting	c
on	c
with	c
your	c
school	c
work	c
?	c

Do	c
you	c
enjoy	c
your	c
schoollife	i
?	c

I	c
was	c
chosen	c
to	c
help	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
by	c
chance	c
in	i
last	c
month	c
.	c

At	c
that	c
time	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
so	c
nervous	c
because	c
I	c
did	c
not	c
know	c
what	c
to	c
do	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
excited	c
to	c
meet	c
lots	c
of	c
people	c
and	c
the	c
pop	c
star	c
,	c
Kelly	c
Chen	c
.	c

There	c
were	c
five	c
other	c
students	c
,	c
like	c
me	c
,	c
who	c
were	c
waiting	c
to	c
help	c
.	c

We	c
were	c
sitting	c
at	c
the	c
back	c
of	c
the	c
concert	c
hall	c
and	c
chatting	c
with	c
each	c
other	c
.	c

We	c
were	c
told	c
that	c
we	c
were	c
responsible	c
for	c
decorating	c
the	c
hall	c
.	c

After	c
I	c
had	c
finished	c
my	c
work	c
,	c
I	c
saw	c
Kelly	c
Chen	c
walking	c
into	c
the	c
concert	c
hall	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
happy	c
at	c
that	c
time	c
and	c
I	c
thought	c
it	c
was	c
the	c
happiest	c
moment	c
that	c
I	c
ever	c
had	c
.	c

At	c
last	c
,	c
the	c
concert	c
was	i
started	i
.	c

I	c
had	c
a	c
really	c
good	c
time	c
in	i
this	c
experience	c
because	c
I	c
could	c
meet	c
my	c
favourite	c
singer	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Ryan	c

Thanks	c
very	c
much	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
to	c
California	c
.	c

The	c
reason	c
is	c
that	c
we	c
have	c
long	c
holidays	c
at	c
school	c
on	i
this	i
time	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
a	c
beginner	c
on	i
both	c
activities	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
some	i
questions	i
as	i
follow	i
:	c

What	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
are	c
needed	c
?	c

2	c
.	c

What	c
I	i
have	c
to	c
pay	c
by	i
myself	c
?	c

3	c
.	c

Should	c
I	c
take	c
some	c
money	c
with	c
me	c
?	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerelly	i
,	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c

I	c
had	i
once	i
this	c
problem	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
looking	c
for	c
a	c
special	c
fruit	c
.	c

The	c
sales	c
assistants	c
in	c
the	c
stores	c
are	c
n't	c
so	c
nice	c
and	i
helpful	c
.	c

Sometimes	c
they	c
give	c
me	c
a	c
bad	c
feeling	c
as	i
,,customer	i
treat	i
with	i
order	i
"	i
.	c

Last	c
week	c
I	c
was	c
shopping	c
with	c
my	c
younger	c
brother	c
.	c

Awful	c
.	i

He	c
wanted	c
everything	c
what	i
his	c
eyes	c
saw	c
.	c

All	c
the	c
stuff	c
for	c
children	c
are	i
in	i
the	c
same	c
level	c
as	c
they	i
have	i
their	c
eyes	c
.	c

The	c
shops	c
have	c
bad	c
opening	c
times	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
feel	c
me	i
comfortable	i
for	c
shopping	c
everything	c
will	i
be	i
closed	c
or	c
you	i
have	c
n't	c
enough	c
time	c
to	c
look	c
around	c
.	c

My	c
conclusion	c
on	c
these	c
points	c
are	i
not	c
so	c
bad	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
,	c

The	c
programme	c
is	c
very	c
exating	i
and	c
interesting	c
,	c
especially	c
the	c
river	c
trip	c
to	c
Greenwich	c
.	c

In	c
fact	c
this	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
because	c
we	c
certainly	c
will	c
not	c
have	c
again	c
the	c
chance	c
to	c
take	c
part	c
in	c
a	c
live	c
show	c
,	c
like	c
this	c
one	c
.	c

Even	i
more	i
,	c
the	i
students	c
do	c
n't	c
pay	c
the	c
entrance	i
.	c

The	c
show	c
is	c
on	c
the	c
14th	c
from	c
10.00	c
to	c
19.00	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
suggest	c
to	i
go	i
to	c
the	c
Science	c
Museum	c
on	i
the	c
afternoon	c
of	i
Wednesday	c
,	c
and	c
just	c
have	i
two	c
or	c
three	c
hours	i
free	c
time	c
after	c
the	c
museum	c
.	c

Your	i
Faithfull	i
,	c

It	c
was	c
dangerous	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
knew	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
.	c

We	c
were	c
a	c
poor	c
family	c
,	c
living	i
in	i
one	i
room	i
for	i
five	i
persons	i
.	c

My	c
father	c
died	c
during	c
the	c
war	c
and	c
my	c
mother	c
stayed	c
alone	c
with	c
four	c
children	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
a	i
day	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
steal	i
the	c
bank	c
.	c

During	i
weeks	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
prepared	c
my	c
programme	i
,	c
trying	c
not	c
to	c
forget	c
something	i
important	c
.	c

Everything	c
was	c
ready	c
and	c
me	i
too	i
.	c

So	c
I	c
knew	c
that	c
the	c
day	c
after	c
would	c
be	c
the	c
good	i
one	c
.	c

The	c
weather	c
was	c
cold	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
arrived	c
in	c
front	c
of	c
the	c
bank	c
,	c
my	c
heart	c
was	c
going	c
faster	c
.	c

A	c
few	c
days	c
before	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
founded	i
a	c
little	c
window	c
at	c
the	c
back	c
of	c
the	c
building	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
entered	c
by	i
this	c
way	c
and	c
by	c
chance	c
I	c
just	c
arrived	c
in	c
the	c
monney	i
's	i
room	i
.	c

I	c
ran	c
to	c
my	c
house	c
and	c
went	c
back	c
in	i
my	c
bed	c
for	i
sleep	i
a	c
little	c
bit	c
.	c

When	c
all	c
the	c
family	c
get	i
up	i
,	c
I	c
told	c
us	i
the	c
true	i
and	c
all	i
promised	c
to	c
say	c
nothing	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
accommodation	c
in	c
Log	c
cabins	c
.	c

I	c
prefer	c
that	c
becouse	i
I	c
will	c
travel	c
with	c
my	c
wife	c
and	c
she	c
always	c
prefers	c
that	c
kind	c
of	c
accommodation	c
.	c

I	c
tell	c
you	c
in	c
sicryt	i
that	c
,	i
I	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
whay	i
she	c
do	i
that	c
.	c

You	c
said	c
that	c
I	c
will	c
have	c
the	c
chance	c
to	c
do	c
two	c
activities	c
,	c
sou	i
I	c
choose	c
swimming	c
and	c
sailing	c
.	c

I	c
Love	c
all	c

What	c

Are	c

discoteks	i
or	c
something	c
I	i
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
if	c
my	c
wife	c
can	c
come	c
with	c
me	c
,	c
becouse	i
withou't	i
she	i
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
be	c
there	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
studying	c
at	c
National	c
Academy	c
of	c
Defense	c
.	c

There	c
is	i
about	c
two	c
thousands	i
students	c
at	c
my	c
school	c
.	c

There	c
are	c
only	c
men	c
.	c

Usually	c
I	c
have	c
eight	c
lessons	c

This	c
is	c
very	c
important	c
,	c
becouse	i
every	c
soldier	c
schould	i
be	c
strong	c
.	c

Today	c
there	c
was	c
the	c
sport	c
competition	c
in	c
Basketball	c
.	c

My	c
group	c
of	c
students	c
won	c
that	c
competition	c
for	c

I	i
'm	i

After	c

there	c
was	c
a	i
mathematic	i

two	c

biology	c
,	c
sow	i
I	c
sleept	i
on	c
the	c
desk	c
in	c
a	c
class-room	i

I	c
think	c
that	c

should	c
be	c
filmed	c
becouse	i
my	c
school	c

of	c

the	c

We	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
my	c
unpleasant	c
experience	c
of	c
visiting	c
your	c
theatre	c
on	c
May	c
21st	c
.	c

As	c
soon	c
as	c
I	c
saw	c
your	c
advertisement	c
in	c
the	c
'	c
Tourist	c
Guide	c
'	c
issue	c
46	c
,	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
go	c
at	c
once	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
all	c
my	c
expectations	c
failed	c
to	c
become	i
true	c
.	c

Although	c
you	c
mentioned	c
it	i
in	c
your	c
advertisement	c
.	c

Next	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
instead	c
of	c
19:30	c
.	c

In	c
connection	c
with	c
that	c
I	c
ask	c
you	c
to	c
refund	c
the	c
money	c
I	c
paid	c
for	c
my	c
tickets	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

Undoubtfully	i
,	c
modern	c
technology	c
changed	i
my	c
daily	c
life	c
.	c

Every	c
aspect	c
of	c
my	c
life	c
is	c
being	c
constantly	c
influence	i
by	c
achievements	c
of	c
science	c
and	c
technology	c
-	c
health	c
,	c
work	c
,	c
household	c
,	c
interaction	c
with	c
other	c
people	c
,	c
etc	c
.	c

Automobile	i
saves	c
my	i
time	c
when	c
I	c
'm	c
travelling	c
.	c

Scientists	c
continue	c
researches	i
into	c
new	c
technologies	c
,	c
such	c
as	c
lasers	c
,	c
digital	c
technology	c
,	c
gene	i
engineering	c
.	c

And	c
I	c
'm	c
sure	c
all	c
those	c
will	c
set	c
new	c
better	i
standards	c
for	c
my	c
way	c
of	c
living	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
seen	c
the	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
and	c
I	c
realised	c
that	c
there	c
were	c
some	c
mistakes	c
.	c

However	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
20.15	c
.	c

We	c
kept	i
waiting	c
for	c
45	c
minutes	c
.	c

We	c
were	c
told	c
that	c
the	i
discounts	c
were	c
available	c
but	c
they	c
were	c
not	c
.	c

We	c
were	c
planning	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
but	c
when	c
we	c
got	c
there	c
we	c
saw	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	i
of	i
the	i
cleaning	c
.	c

We	c
had	c
expected	c
a	c
brilliant	c
show	c
but	c
we	c
were	c
very	c
disappointed	c
.	c

If	c
we	c
compare	c
a	c
person	c
who	c
lived	c
a	c
very	c
long	c
time	c
ago	c
with	c
another	c
one	c
who	c
lives	c
now	c
,	c
we	c
will	c
see	c
a	c
very	c
big	c
difference	c
between	c
their	c
clothes	c
.	c

Nowadays	c
the	c
aim	c
in	i
clothing	c
is	c
not	c

In	c
the	c

Nobody	i
expected	c
to	c
have	c
a	i
electric	i
goods	c
which	c
have	i
been	i
helping	i
to	c
do	c
housework	c

It	c
made	c
woman	i
to	i
be	i
free	c
from	c
drudgery	c
,	c
so	c
that	c
they	c
could	c
utilize	c
time	c
for	c
improving	c
themselves	c

We	c

I	c
will	i

It	c

Can	c
you	c
believe	c
that	c
I	c
was	c
helping	c
in	i
the	c
last	c
Britney	c
Spears	i
's	i
Concert	c
?	c

She	c
was	c
so	c
kind	c
with	i
all	c
of	c
us	c
,	i
of	i
course	i
I	c
asked	c
her	c
for	c
an	c
autograph	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
to	c
see	c
you	c
soon	c
,	i
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
wait	c
to	c
show	c
it	c
.	i

The	c
concert	c
was	c
a	c
big	c
success	c
,	c
lot	i
of	c
excitment	i
.	c

Everybody	c
sang	c
and	c
danced	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
there	c
to	c
see	c
everything	c
from	c
the	c
best	c
position	c
.	c

Each	c
time	c
,	i
when	i
she	c
comes	i
back	c
to	c
the	c
room	c
,	c
she	c
asked	c
for	c
something	c
to	c
drink	c
,	c
just	c
a	c
diet	c
coke	c
,	c
because	c
she	c
's	c
always	c
looking	c
after	c
her	c
weight	i
.	c

Then	c
she	c
eat	i
something	c
small	c
and	c
she	c
looks	i
full	c
of	c
energy	c
all	c
night	c
long	c
.	c

At	c
the	c
end	c
,	c
she	c
took	c
the	c
time	c
to	c
say	c
good	i
by	i
to	c
all	c
of	c
the	c
people	c
helping	c
her	c
.	c

But	c
now	c
,	c
tell	c
me	c
about	c
you	c
.	c

Do	c
n't	c
be	c
lazy	c
and	c
write	c
more	c
often	c
.	c

I	c
received	c
your	c
letter	c
last	c
week	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c

I	c
was	c
really	c
surprised	c
and	c
happy	c
to	c
hear	c
that	c
I	c
won	i
the	c
first	c
prize	c
On	i
your	c
letter	c
you	c
ask	c
me	c
some	c
questions	c
about	c
my	c
wishes	i
:	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
sleeping	i
in	c
a	c
tent	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
very	i
active	c
person	c
who	c
loves	c
the	c
outdoor	c
life	c
.	c

I	c
also	c
choose	c
the	i
Golf	i
I	i
have	c
never	c
played	i
this	c
sport	c
but	c
I	c
am	c
sure	c
I	c
will	c
enjoy	c
it	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
could	c
you	c
give	c
me	c
an	c
idea	c
about	c
the	c

I	c
need	c

Please	c

that	c

be	c
a	c
nice	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
,	c
which	c
gave	i
me	i
a	c
very	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
,	c
while	c
I	c
was	c
staying	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
there	c
was	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
instead	c
of	c
the	c
famous	c
actor	c
,	i
Danny	c
Brook	c
.	c

It	c
caused	c
me	c
missed	i
the	c
train	c
and	c
I	c
went	c
back	c
to	c
the	c
hotel	c
nearly	i
in	i
the	i
mid-night	i
.	c

Another	c
problem	c
is	c
,	i
I	c
realised	i
that	c
the	i
discounts	c
were	c
available	c
.	c

Additionally	c
,	c
the	c
advertisement	c
said	c
I	c
can	i
visit	c
the	c
threatre	i
restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
arrived	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

That	i
is	c
so	c
annoying	c
that	c
everything	c
had	i
been	i
changed	c
without	c
any	c
notice	c
.	c

I	c
expected	i
to	c
receive	c
the	i
money	c
back	c
within	c
these	i
two	c
days	c
.	c

Otherwise	c
I	c
would	i
like	i
to	c
take	c
the	i
other	i
action	c
.	c

I	c
told	c
Pat	c
everything	c
even	c
my	c
secrects	i
when	c
we	c
were	c
still	c
friendly	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
we	c
are	c
not	c
friends	c
anymore	c
because	c
of	c
a	c
secrect	i
in	i
the	i
past	i
.	c

It	c
was	i
a	c
very	c
long	c
time	c
since	c
I	c
was	c
in	c
Year	c
7	c
.	c

I	c
told	c
her	c
because	c
I	c
wanted	c
somebody	c
to	c
share	c
my	c
feeling	i
.	c

May	i
be	i
it	c
was	c
a	i
wrong	c
decision	c
to	c
tell	c
her	c
,	i
she	i
began	c
to	c
spread	i
that	c
secrect	i
to	i
everybody	c
including	i
the	c
teachers	c
.	c

They	c
tried	c
to	c
contact	c
with	i
my	c
parents	c
.	c

My	c
parents	c
were	c
very	c
angry	c
when	c
they	c
realised	c
what	c
happened	i
.	c

At	i
last	i
,	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	i
other	i
school	c
and	c
I	c
will	c
not	c
tell	c
any	c
secrect	i
to	c
the	i
others	i

the	c

two	c
activities	c
from	c
you	i

I	c
would	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c

enjoyable	c
.	c

Some	i
days	c
ago	c
my	c
class	c
had	c
a	c
big	c
discussion	c
about	c
shopping	c
.	c

Now	c
,	c
my	c
English	c
teacher	c
has	c
asked	c
me	c
to	c
explane	i
all	i
what	c
I	c
think	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
very	c
easy	c
because	c
there	c
are	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
things	c
to	c
buy	c
,	c
shops	c
are	c
plenty	i
of	c
every	c
kinds	i
of	c
things	i
.	c

You	c
can	c
chose	i
the	c
price	c
more	i
suitable	i
for	c
you	c
.	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
enjoyable	c
when	c
you	c
have	c
not	c
enough	c
money	c
to	c
buy	c
what	c
you	c
want	c

when	c
you	c
are	c
not	c
sure	c
about	c
what	c
you	c
would	c

to	c

very	c
well	c
two	c
people	c
who	c
thought	c
very	c
different	i

shopping	c

Dear	c
Manager	c
,	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
you	c
this	c
letter	c
because	c
yesterday	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
musical	c
show	i
and	c
I	c
had	c
many	c
problems	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
demand	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
when	i
I	c
paid	c
my	c
entrance	c
they	i
did	c
n't	c
acept	i
me	i
my	c
discount	c
ticket	c
,	c
they	c
said	i
me	c
that	c
the	c
ticket	c
was	c
false	i
,	c
then	c
I	c
enter	i
to	i
the	c
theatre	c
and	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
wait	c
45	c
min	i
,	i
the	i
show	c
was	c
suposed	i
to	c
start	c
at	c
19:30	c
and	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
,	c
"	c
this	c
is	i
a	c
lack	c
of	c
respect	c
"	c
.	c

When	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
the	c
starring	i
was	c
wrong	c
because	c
it	c
said	c
that	c
act	i
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
and	i
Danny	c
Brook	c
did'n	i
act	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
another	c
actor	c
that	c
nobody	c
knew	c
,	c
"	c
Really	c
this	c
is	c
very	c
disappointing	c
"	c
.	c

After	c
the	c
show	c
I	c
planned	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
restaurant	c
with	c
my	c
wife	c
,	c
but	c
what	c
do	c
you	c
think	c
it	i
happened	c
?	c

Manager	c
I	i
spect	i
that	c
you	c
considered	i
my	c
bad	c
experience	c
in	i
your	c
theatre	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
'm	c
asking	c
you	c
for	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
,	c
because	c
,	i
it	c
was	c
a	c
very	c
bad	c
evening	c

the	i
best	i
friend	i
of	i
Nick	i
,	c
wanted	c
to	c
make	i
the	c
party	c
in	i
his	c
house	c
,	i
most	i
of	c
the	c
class	c
disagree	i
with	c
that	c
because	c
the	c
house	i
of	i
Pat	i
is	c
extremly	i
little	c
,	c
they	c
started	c
to	c
say	c
him	i
that	c
his	c
house	c
was	c
like	c
a	c
box	c
.	c

Pat	c
affected	i
with	i
this	c
situation	c
told	i
Nick	c
all	c
the	i
situation	c
and	c
the	c
secret	i
of	i
the	i
class	i
.	c

At	i
the	i
beginning	i
Nick	c
got	c
angree	i
but	c
then	c
he	c
forgive	i
him	c
because	c
they	c
were	c
friend	i
and	c
each	c
of	c
one	i
can	i
trust	c
on	i
the	c
other	c
.	c

The	c
day	c
of	c
the	c
party	c
all	i
had	c
fun	c
especially	i
Pat	c
that	i
at	i
the	i
beggining	i
was	c
sad	c

Dear	c
Mrs.	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
collect	i
further	c
information	c
about	c
my	c
trip	c
to	c
Camp	c
California	c
and	c
to	c
make	c
some	c
things	c
a	c
bit	c
more	i
clear	i
for	c
you	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
since	c
I	c
'll	c
be	c
very	c
busy	c
during	c
the	c
next	c
three	c
months	c
due	c
to	c
my	c
job	c
's	c
demands	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
.	c

Although	c
the	c
weather	c
may	c
not	c
be	c
friendly	i
,	c
it	c
is	c
the	c
only	c
time	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
beauty	c
of	c
the	c
camp	c
.	c

And	c
being	c
a	c
photographer	c
during	c
my	c
spare	c
time	c
and	c
a	c
swimmer	c
since	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
child	c
,	c
these	c
will	c
be	c
the	c
activities	c
I	i
'll	i
like	c
to	c
do	c
while	c
at	c
the	c
camp	c
-	c
I	c
think	c
I	c
am	c
fairly	c
good	c
at	c
doing	c
both	c
things	c
!	c

I	c
would	c
also	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
some	c
more	c
details	c
about	c
what	c
sort	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
will	c
have	c
to	c
bring	c
with	c
me	c
and	c
about	c
the	c
amount	c
of	c
money	c
which	c
will	i
be	c
necessary	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
take	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Shopping	c
can	c
be	c
painful	c

But	c
situations	c
in	c
which	c
you	c
do	c
not	c
need	c
to	c
move	c
carefully	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
avoid	c
stepping	c
on	c
someone	c
's	c
feet	c
are	c
quite	c
rare	c
and	c
,	c
when	c
they	c
do	c
happen	c
,	c
time	c
passes	c
by	c
very	c
fast	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
if	c
you	c
are	c
another	c
fool	c
standing	c
amidst	c
the	c
crowd	c
,	c
waiting	c
for	c
the	c
queue	c
to	c
move	c
,	c
time	c
slowly	c
melts	c
.	c

Believe	c
me	c
,	c
shopping	c
can	c
also	c
be	c
painful	c
.	c

Amazingly	c
,	c
doctors	c
tell	c
people	c
to	c
look	c
after	c
their	c
bodies	c
during	c
Christmas	c
time	c
:	c
shopping	c
can	c
cause	c
you	c
a	c
large	c
variety	c
of	c
undesireble	i
pains	c
.	c

They	c
keep	c
claiming	c
that	c
there	i
's	i
no	i
such	i
thing	i
as	i
shopping	c
.	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
answer	c
the	c
questions	c
you	c
asked	c
me	c
in	c
the	c
last	c
letter	c
you	c
sent	c
me	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
both	c
activities	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
practised	i
them	c
all	c
my	c
life	c
.	c

I	c
also	c
wanted	c
to	c
know	c
if	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
some	c
money	c
to	c
buy	c
souvenirs	c
and	c
food	c
or	c
that	i
will	i
be	c
paid	c
for	c
me	i
,	c
too	c
?	c

Those	c
are	c
all	c
my	c
questions	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
receiving	i
your	c
reply	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

As	c
you	c
know	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
member	c
of	c
a	c
BSB	c
fan	c
club	c
,	c
and	c
last	c
month	c
we	c
had	c
the	c
opportunity	c
to	c
help	c
at	c
a	c
concert	c
they	c
gave	c
in	c
the	c
city	c
where	c
I	c
live	c
.	c

Firstly	i
,	c
I	c
helped	c
selling	i
the	c
tickets	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
best	c
experiences	c
I	c
have	c
had	c
in	c
all	c
my	c
life	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
hearing	i
from	c
you	c
.	c

My	c
new	c
phone	c

Yours	c

I	c
'm	c
24	c
and	c
I	c
'm	c
student	i
from	c
Poland	c
.	c

I	c
recently	c
spent	c
two	c
days	c
at	c
this	c
festival	c
.	c

Most	c
of	c
the	c
events	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
were	c
good	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
feel	c
that	c
festival	i
could	c
be	c
even	c
better	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

There	c
were	c
also	c
plays	c
and	c
films	c
,	c
dance	c
shows	c
,	c
which	c
I	c
liked	c
the	c
most	c
,	c
art	c
exhibitions	c
and	c
talks	c
by	c
writers	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
good	c
to	c
see	c
more	c
plays	c
and	c
films	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

Also	c
a	i
great	i
idea	i
was	i
,	i
that	i
it	i
was	i
one	c
reasonably-priced	c
weekend	c
ticket	c
for	c
all	c
events	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
,	c
as	c
a	c
person	c
,	i
who	c
in	i
this	i
festival	i
took	i
place	i
in	i
,	c
that	c
this	i
is	i
excellent	c
,	c
because	c
we	c
can	i
spend	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
time	c
with	c
art	c
.	c

There	c
is	c
only	c
one	c
bad	c
fhing	i
,	c
that	c
this	c
festival	c
was	c
too	c
short	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
not	c
looking	i
foward	i
to	c

Yours	c
sincerly	i
,	c

Dear	c
Kathleen	c
,	c

I	c
've	c
been	i
just	i
receiving	i
this	c
letter	c
for	i
you	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
'm	c
writting	i
you	i
.	c

I	c
hope	c
that	c
you	c
feel	c
good	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
n't	c
seen	c
you	c
for	c
two	c
years	c
.	c

You	c
wrote	c
that	c
in	c
your	c
class	c
,	c
you	c
've	c
been	c
talking	c
about	c
rules	c
,	c
both	c
at	c
home	c
and	c
at	c
school	c
.	c

So	c
now	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
you	i
write	i
something	c
about	c
school	i
rules	c
in	c
my	c
country	c
and	c
also	c
what	c
I	c
am	c
allowed	c
to	c
do	c
at	c
home	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
lessons	c
from	c
Monday	c
till	c
Friday	c
.	c

On	c
Sathurday	i
and	c
Sunday	c
we	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
lessons	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
does	c
n't	c
seem	c
that	c
we	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
work	c
.	c

At	c
my	c
school	c
there	c
are	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
drawings	i
,	i
paintings	i
and	i
some	c
other	c
subjects	c
doing	i
by	c
hands	i
.	c

It	c
's	c
very	c
interesting	c
.	c

We	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
tests	c
during	c
the	c
whole	c
student	c
year	c
,	c
only	c
at	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
the	c
class	c
.	c

There	c
are	c
also	c
some	c
exams	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
troubbles	i
with	c
my	c
education	c
,	i
my	i
friends	c
and	c
teachers	c
are	c
nice	c
and	c
friendly	c
,	c
but	c
there	c
is	c
one	c
thing	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
change	c
in	c
my	c
school	c
.	c

I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
have	c
more	c
tests	c
during	c
the	c
whole	c
study	i
,	c
not	c
only	c
at	c
the	c
end	c
,	c
because	c
it	i
causes	i
that	i
I	i
'm	i
getting	i
very	c
lasy	i
.	c

I	c
think	c
,	i
that	c
you	c
do	i
n't	i
forget	c
,	c
&	c
will	c
write	i
me	c
soon	c
.	c

See	c
you	c
soon	c
,	c
your	c
best	c
friend	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

I	c
recently	c
spent	c
a	c
week	c
in	c
London	c
and	c
during	c
my	c
stay	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
see	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
,	i
-	c
the	c
musical	c
show	i
-	i
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
the	c
advertisement	c
of	i
the	c
show	c
said	c
that	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
was	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
on	c
stage	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
he	c
did	c
not	c
appear	c
during	c
the	c
show	c
;	c
that	c
disappointed	c
me	c
a	c
lot	c
.	c

Appart	i
from	c
that	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
delayed	c
forty	i
five	i
minutes	c
,	c
consequently	c
,	c
everybody	c
there	c
lost	c
control	c
and	c
became	c
angry	c
.	c

Besides	i
,	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
had	c
closed	c
down	c
before	c
I	c
went	i
out	i
of	i
the	c
show	c
.	c

Finally	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
inform	c
you	c
that	c
I	c
had	i
never	c
spent	i
such	c
an	c
umpleasant	i
evening	c
in	c
my	c
whole	c
life	c
.	c

He	c
was	c
one	c
of	c
my	c
best	c
friends	c
,	c
but	c
all	c
secrets	c
told	c
to	c
him	c
spreaded	i
throughout	c
the	c
school	c
in	c
a	c
matter	c
of	c
minutes	c
.	c

The	c
worst	c
was	c
that	c
he	c
did	c
it	c
unconciously	i
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
me	c
who	c
had	c
to	c
tell	c
Pat	c
about	c
the	c
surprise	c
.	c

Since	c
they	c
were	c
going	c
to	c
beat	c
him	c
,	i
he	c
desperately	c
told	c
them	c
everything	c
he	c
knew	c
about	c
the	c
party	c
.	c

Afterwards	c
,	c
all	c
of	c
them	c
were	c
around	c
Tim	c
telling	c
him	c
what	c
Pat	c
had	c
confessed	c
.	c

Both	c
Pat	c
and	c
Tim	c
were	c
very	c
disappointed	c
that	c
day	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
found	c
the	c
advertisement	c
of	i
International	i
Arts	c
Festival	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
excited	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
great	i
to	c
hold	c
an	c
annual	c
international	c
arts	c
festival	c
in	c
the	i
place	c
.	c

Then	c
I	c
spent	c
two	c
days	c
at	c
the	c
festival	c
.	c

I	c
enjoyed	c
it	c
very	c
much	c
.	c

There	c
were	c
so	c
many	c
exciting	c
things	c
I	c
saw	c
,	c
such	c
as	c
stars	c
and	c
artists	c
from	c
around	c
the	c
world	c
.	c

Jazz	c
,	c
rock	c
and	c
classical	c
concerts	c
,	c
plays	c
and	c
dance	c
show	i
etc.	c
The	c
specified	i
thing	c
is	i
worth	c
to	i
remind	i
here	c
is	c
the	c
reasonably-priced	c
ticket	c
for	c
all	c
events	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
excellent	c
because	c
most	c
tourist	i
could	c
offer	i
what	c
they	c
like	i
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
there	c
were	c
some	c
conert	i
halls	c
which	c
was	i
too	c
small	c
to	c
hold	c
so	c
much	i
people	c
,	c
the	c
stars	c
and	c
artists	c
were	c
just	c
from	c
six	c
countries	c
,	c
which	c
is	c
not	c
enough	c
for	c
audience	i
.	c

Dear	c
Magda	c

It	c
is	c
lovely	c
to	c
get	c
your	c
letter	c
so	c
soon	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
country	c
the	c
children	c
go	c
to	c
the	i
secondary	c
school	c
when	c
they	c
are	c
at	i
the	c
first	c
year	c
of	c
teenage	i
.	c

These	i
always	c
annoy	c
the	c
school	i
teacher	i
and	c
parents	i
.	c

In	i
a	c
result	c
of	c
these	i
the	i
teachers	c
make	c
very	c
strict	c
rules	c
at	c
school	c
,	c
such	c
as	c
students	c
are	c
n't	c
allowed	c
to	c
speak	c
each	i
other	c
in	c
the	i
class	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
not	c
just	c
what	c
happened	c
in	c
my	c
home	c
many	i
of	c
my	c
friend	i
had	c
the	c
same	c
experience	c
.	c

Now	c
I	c
'm	c
a	c
mother	c
of	c
two	c
children	c
.	c

They	c
are	c
all	i
in	c
the	i
school	c
.	c

Comparing	i
to	c
my	c
experience	c
,	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
give	c
them	c
more	i
open	c
attitude	c
about	c
everything	c
.	c

But	c
at	c
school	c
,	c
although	c
I	c
hope	c
the	c
teacher	c
do	i
n't	i
give	c
students	c
so	c
much	c
homework	c
,	c
do	i
n't	i
forbidden	i
the	c
opposite	i
voice	i
of	c
the	c
students	c
,	c
there	c
are	i
nothing	c
I	c
can	c
do	c
because	c
of	c
our	c
culture	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
receiving	c
your	c
next	c
letter	c
soon	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
,	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
reasons	c
that	c
we	c
write	i
this	c
letter	c
to	c
you	c
,	i
is	c
because	c
we	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
this	c
short	c
trip	c
in	i
London	c
.	c

We	c
believe	c
that	c
the	c
programme	c
is	c
very	c
cood	i
and	c
well	c
organised	c
and	c
we	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
one	c
more	c
time	c
especially	i
for	c
that	c
.	c

The	c
other	c
reason	c
as	i
I	c
mention	i
earlier	c
is	c
because	i
of	i
a	c
request	c
off	i
all	i
the	i
class	c
.	c

We	c
've	c
seen	c
an	c
advertisement	c
in	c
the	c
newspapers	c
,	c
about	c
a	c
Fashion	c
exhibition	c
in	c
London	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
the	c
14	i
of	c
March	c
.	c

That	c
is	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
3	c
days	c
that	c
we	c
will	c
spent	i
in	c
London	c
as	c
a	c
college	i
.	c

So	c
we	c
had	c
this	c
great	c
idea	c
if	i
it	c
is	c
possible	c
of	c
course	c
to	i
include	i
this	c
exhibition	c
in	c
our	c
programme	c
.	c

The	c
exhibition	c
is	c
caud	i
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
and	c
it	c
taking	i
place	c
at	c
the	c
Central	c
Exhibition	c

in	c
London	c
From	i
10.00	c
till	c
19.00	c

The	c
class	c
is	c
very	c
exiting	i
about	c
that	c
because	c
the	c

We	c
believe	c
that	c
is	i
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
because	c
is	i
one	c
of	c
the	c
best	c
shows	c
of	c
the	c

also	i
a	i
majority	c
of	c
the	c

never	i
had	i
the	c
change	i
to	c
visit	c
a	c
show	c
as	i
this	c
and	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
and	c
best	c
part	c
is	c
that	c
the	i
admission	c
is	c
Free	c

And	c
that	c
we	c
found	i
it	i
very	c
good	c

I	c
believe	c
that	c
any	i
famous	c
people	c
such	i
as	c
politicians	c
and	c
film	c
stars	c
,	c
deserve	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
private	c
life	c
without	c
journalists	c
following	c
them	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
for	c
a	i
various	c
reasons	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
they	c
are	c
humans	c
like	c
everyone	c
else	c

so	c
yes	c
everyone	c
want	i

Dear	c
manager	c
I	c
am	c
writing	c
you	i
because	c
of	c
your	c
new	c
musical	c
show	c
"	c
Over	c
The	c
Rainbow	c
''	c
.	c

I	c
have	i
spent	i
my	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
recently	c
and	c
it	i
is	c
like	c
a	c
tradition	c
,	c
we	c
went	c
to	c
a	c
musical	c
.	c

And	c
then	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
p.m.	c
,	c
although	c
it	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
start	c
at	c
19:30	c
p.m.	c
,	c
so	c
we	i
've	i
had	i
to	c
wait	c
quite	c
long	c
in	c
this	i
crowded	c
room	c
.	c

And	c
when	c
the	c
show	c
finally	c
started	c
,	c
I	c
realized	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
acting	c
,	c
instead	c
there	c
was	c
an	c
unknown	c
,	c
not	c
very	c
talented	c
actor	c
.	c

After	c
the	c
show	c
we	c
wanted	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
,	c
because	c
we	c
were	c
very	c
hungry	c
,	c
but	c
then	c
we	c
saw	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
,	c
because	c
of	c
staff	c
illness	c
.	c

We	c
sometimes	c
tried	c
to	c
make	i
surprise	c
parties	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
never	c
worked	c
because	c
of	c
him	c
.	c

Two	c
weeks	c
before	c
his	c
birthday	c
he	c
started	c
asking	c
us	c
what	c
we	c
were	c
gong	i
to	c
do	c
.	c

That	c
annoyed	c
us	c
so	c
much	c
,	i
that	c
we	c
started	c
making	c
something	c
up	c
.	c

On	c
his	c
birthday	c
all	c
our	c
friends	c
were	c
at	c
my	c
place	c
,	c
waiting	c
for	c
Pat	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
invited	c
him	c
to	c
opened	i
the	c
evening	c
with	c
me	c
.	c

He	c
was	c
very	c
sorry	c
that	c
he	c
had	c
not	c
want	i
to	c
come	c
and	c
arrived	c
quite	c
soon	c
then	c
.	c

thank	c
you	c
for	c
the	c
information	c
,	i
I	c
am	c
glad	c
I	c
've	c
won	c
first	c
prize	c
!	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
in	c
July	c
for	i
it	c
's	c
the	c
only	c
month	c
I	c
can	c
choose	c
.	c

In	c
July	c
I	c
'll	c
be	c
on	c
my	c
vacation	c
.	c

First	c
I	c
am	c
good	c
enough	c
at	c
both	c
of	c
them	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
what	c
the	c
weather	c
is	c
like	c
in	c
California	c
in	c
July	c
to	c
be	i
aware	i
of	i
what	c
clothes	c
I	c
should	c
take	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
greatly	c
appreciate	c
your	c
soonest	i
answer	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

It	c
is	c
amazing	c
and	c
sometimes	c
amuzing	i
how	c
charming	c
and	c
strong	c
the	c
spell	c
of	c
luxurious	c
supermarkets	c
and	c
cosy	c
little	c
shops	c
is	c
.	c

And	c
still	c
even	c
this	c
strong	c
spell	c
can	c
be	c
easily	c
shattered	c
.	c

Who	c
can	c
prevent	c
me	c
from	c
having	c
a	c
good	c
,	c
probably	i
not	c
for	c
my	c
purse	c
,	c
time	c
in	c
the	c
magic	c
world	c
of	c
shopping	c
?	c

But	c
sometimes	c
I	c
really	c
get	c
annoyed	c
at	c
his	c
or	c
her	c
,	c
persistent	c
in	c
nature	c
and	c
polite	c
in	c
structure	c
,	c
questions	c
or	c
suggestions	c
.	c

To	c
say	c
nothing	c
about	c
his	c
or	c
her	c
giving	c
advice	c
!	c

Like	c
any	c
human	c
being	c
I	c
am	c
not	c
delighted	c
to	c
feel	c
guilty	c
,	c
especially	c
when	c
I	c
am	c
not	c
.	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
glad	c

that	c
and	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
all	c
the	c
informations	i
you	c
need	c
to	c
know	c
from	c
me	c
.	c

Also	c
I	c
cannot	c
go	c
on	i
other	c
holidays	c
because	c
for	c
Easter	i
holiday	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
attend	i
Tennis	i
competition	c
in	i
the	i
name	i
of	i
my	c
school	c
and	c
we	c
need	c
time	c
to	c
practise	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
appologize	i
about	c
that	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
choose	c
these	c
2	c
activities	c
,	c
they	c
are	c
Tennis	c
and	c
Climbing	c
.	c

As	c
I	c
say	i
before	c
that	i
I	c
have	c
to	c
attend	i
tennis	i
competition	c
so	i
I	c
think	c
I	c
am	c
quite	c
good	c
at	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
started	c
playing	c
tennis	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
9	c
,	i
now	i
I	c
am	c
18	c
years	c

My	c

tennis	c
and	c
enjoy	i
it	c

I	c
'm	c
not	c
scared	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
's	c
challenging	c

My	c
sister	c
loves	c
nature	c
and	c
climbing	c
so	c
she	c
is	c
the	c
one	c
who	c
influences	c
me	c
.	c

Do	c
I	c
need	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
money	c
,	i
will	i
we	c
have	c
time	c
for	c
shopping	c

If	c
there	i

Dear	c
Kim	c

I	c
am	c
sorry	c
that	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
write	c
any	c
letter	i
to	c
your	i
during	c
last	i
month	c
.	c

Quess	i
what	c
I	c
've	c
done	c
!	c

I	c
've	c
been	c
helping	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
that	c
happened	i
at	c
my	c
school	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
know	c
I	c
took	c
art	c
for	c
my	c
GCSE	c
and	c
fortunately	c
I	c
like	i
it	c
and	c
get	i
quite	c
good	c
marks	c
for	c
my	c
project	c
,	i
about	c
light	c
and	c
sound	c
.	c

So	c
my	c
art	c
teacher	c
came	c
to	c
me	c
and	c
my	c
best	c
friend	c
,	c
who	c
is	c
really	c
good	c
at	c
art	c
too	c
,	c
and	c
asked	c
whether	c
I	i
can	i
be	c
able	c
and	c
willing	c
to	c
help	c
for	i
the	c
concert	c
in	c
two	c
weeks	i
time	c
in	c
the	c
concert	c
hall	c
.	c

I	c
immediately	c
say	i
"	c
yes	c
"	c
and	c
also	i
my	c
friend	c
.	c

I	c
really	c
think	i
it	c
sounds	i
so	c
interesting	c
.	c

I	c
have	i
never	c
done	c
light	c
and	c
sound	c
for	c
the	i
real	c
pop	c
concert	c
before	c
and	c
I	c
think	i
it	c
will	i
be	c
a	c
good	c
experience	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

But	c
this	c
time	c
it	i
'll	i
be	c
different	c
,	c
I	c
thought	c
.	c

The	c
preperation	i
days	c
came	c
.	c

The	i
first	c
day	c
we	c
started	c
to	c
work	c
for	c
this	c
concert	c
,	c
the	c
real	c
professionals	c
came	c
.	c

Their	c
jobs	i
are	i
preparing	i
concert	i
.	c

It	c
sounded	c
very	c
interesting	c
to	c
me	c
.	c

Then	c
we	c
started	c
to	c
talk	c
about	c
what	c
we	c
have	i
to	c
do	c
for	c
this	c
concert	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
learnt	c
lots	c
of	c
things	c
about	c
preparing	c
stage	i
,	c
light	i
,	c
sound	c
,	i
background	c
.	c

I	c
felt	c
like	c
I	i
'm	i
one	c
of	c
those	c
professional	i
too	c
because	c
they	c
always	c
called	c
me	c
and	c
my	c
friend	c
to	c
help	c
them	c
and	c
that	c
made	c
me	c
learn	c
lots	c
of	c
thing	i
from	c
doing	c
the	c
practical	c
work	c
.	c

All	c
of	c
them	c
were	c
very	c
nice	c
and	c
friendly	c
.	c

Another	c
exciting	c
part	c
was	c
,	i
I	c
had	c
to	c
climb	c
to	c
put	c
the	c
lights	c
up	c
.	c

Can	c
you	c
imagine	c
the	c
real	c
concert	c
,	c
and	c
how	c
high	c
the	c
lights	c
always	c
like	i
?	c

It	c
was	c
good	c
fun	c
though	c
!	c
,	i
but	i
my	c
friend	c
did	c
n't	c
like	c
doing	c
that	c
at	c
all	c
.	c

She	c
did	c
n't	c
seem	c
to	c
enjoyed	i
it	c
as	c
much	c
as	c
I	c
do	i
.	c

At	i
the	i
end	i
of	i
the	i
day	i
,	c
my	c
ambition	c
is	c
to	c
be	c
like	c
one	c
of	c
the	i
professionals	c
.	c

I	c
really	c
do	c
hope	c
I	c
can	c
be	c
like	c
them	c
.	c

I	c
feel	c
like	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
work	c
harder	c
.	c

I	c
will	c
write	c
to	c
you	c
again	c
soon	c
and	c
tell	c
you	c
how	c
I	c
getting	i
on	c
.	c

Lots	c
of	c
love	c

12th	c
December	c
2000	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
organising	c
a	c
nice	c
programme	c
for	c
us	c
.	c

The	i
entrance	i
fee	i
is	c
free	c
for	c
students	c
so	c
the	c
show	c
is	c
well	c
worth	c
seeing	c
.	c

The	c
show	c
is	c
on	c
14th	c
and	c
takes	i
a	c
whole	c
day	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
if	c
we	c
could	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
Museum	c
by	c
using	c
the	c
free	c
time	c
on	c
15th	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
okay	c
although	c
we	c
could	c
not	c
go	c
shopping	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
shortly	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
dangerous	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
knew	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
always	c
had	c
my	c
own	c
key	c
and	c
unlock	i
the	c
door	c
by	c
myself	c
.	c

First	c
,	c
I	c
climbed	c
the	c
tree	c
in	c
the	c
garden	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
okay	c
,	c
beause	i
I	c
was	c
quite	c
good	c
at	c
that	c
,	c
but	c
the	c
problem	c
was	c
that	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
jump	c
onto	c
the	c
roof	c
!	c

I	c
was	c
extremely	c
happy	c
when	c
I	c
got	c
into	c
the	c
house	c
.	c

Dear	c
Jane	c

Firstly	c
I	i
want	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
that	c
the	c
idea	c
of	c
the	c
"	c
International	c
Arts	c
Festival	c
"	c
was	c
a	c
really	c
great	c
idea	c
.	c

This	i
also	i
would	i
take	i
more	i
attraction	i
to	i
the	i
festival	i
.	c

The	c
plays	c
and	c
the	c
films	c
were	c
really	c
great	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
to	c
see	c
much	i
more	c
films	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

The	c
best	c
thing	c
about	c
the	c
festival	c
was	c
the	c
price	c
I	c
think	c
,	c
because	c
it	c
made	i
a	c
really	c
big	c
effect	c
on	c
the	c
attraction	i
,	c
that	i
of	c
course	c
made	c
the	c
festival	c
much	c
more	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

I	c
again	c
want	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
really	c
nice	c
to	c
be	c
at	c
the	c
festival	c
.	c

Your	i
Sinccerly	i

16.12.00	c

I	c
'm	c
really	c
tired	c
of	c
the	c
rules	c
in	c
school	c
!	c

Actually	c
not	c
all	c
the	c
schools	c
in	c
Turkey	c
are	c
so	c
strict	c
but	c
unfortunatly	i
the	c
school	c
that	c
I	c
'm	c
going	c
is	i
like	c
a	c
military	c
camp	c
.	c

The	c
uniform	c
,	i
we	c
are	i
wearing	i
has	c
to	c
be	c
perfect	c
.	c

No	c
one	c
is	c
allowed	c
to	c
wear	c
anything	c
which	c
is	c
n't	c
written	c
in	c
the	c
school	c
rules	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
if	i
you	c
do	c
n't	c
come	c
to	c
school	c
10	i
days	c
in	c
a	c
year	c
we	i
fail	c
that	c
year	c
.	c

Thank	c
God	c
it	c
is	c
n't	c
so	c
strict	c
at	c
home	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
allowed	c
to	c
stay	c
up	c
late	c
,	c
I	c
'm	c
allowed	c
to	c
bring	c
my	c
friends	c
home	c
and	c
stuff	c
like	c
that	c
.	c

So	c
just	c
do	c
n't	c
think	c
about	c
them	c
.	c

Your	c
Best	i
Pen	i

Dear	c
Ms	c
Ryan	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
which	c
I	c
have	c
received	c
it	i
this	c
morning	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
Camp	c
California	c
in	c
the	c
U.S.A	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
I	c
still	c
have	c
got	c
an	c
examination	c
in	c
my	c
college	c
until	c
June	c
,	c
20th	c
.	c

I	c

Dear	c
Kim	c

Hi	c
!	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
kind	c
letter	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
glad	c
to	c
hearing	i
about	c
your	c
news	c
.	c

Kim	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
my	c
wonderful	c
experience	c
last	c
month	c
!	c

On	c
5th	c
of	c
May	c
which	i
was	c
national	i
holiday	c
in	c
Japan	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
part-time	c
work	i
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
in	c
the	c
Tokyo	c
Dome	c
.	c

The	c
concert	c
was	i
start	i
7.00	i
p.m.	c
At	c
that	c
time	c
I	c
was	c
in	i
the	c
second	c
floor	c
where	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
work	c
is	i
.	c

I	c
stood	c
up	c
in	c
front	c
of	c
audiences	i
and	c
I	i
had	i
given	i
an	i
attention	i
to	i
them	i
.	c

I	c
could	c
n't	c
see	c
'	c
Hikaru	c
'	c
but	c
I	c
still	c
could	c
hear	c
her	c
songs	c
.	c

I	c
thought	c
if	c
you	c
were	c
here	c
I	c
could	c
really	c
enjoy	c
with	i
you	c
.	c

All	c
of	c
her	c
funs	i
were	c
stooud	i
up	c
the	c
whole	c
concert	c
and	c
dancing	c
.	c

Some	c
of	c
funs	i
were	c
not	c
good	c
at	c
all	c
because	c
they	c
shouted	c
and	c
argued	c
,	c
but	c
most	c
of	c
people	i
were	c
very	c
good	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
enjoyed	c
so	i
much	i
with	i
my	i
wonderful	i
experience	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c

Please	c
give	c
my	c
regards	c
to	c
your	c
family	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Ryan	c
:	c

It	c
's	c
always	c
nice	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
warm	c
,	c
clean	c
place	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
after	c
sailing	c
which	i
is	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
activities	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
do	c
.	c

Sincerely	c
Yours	c

Help.	c
.	c

I	c
know	c
it	c
sound	i
extremely	c
boring	c
and	c
that	c
is	c
exactly	c
what	c
I	c
thought	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
asked	c
to	c
help	c
,	c
but	c
to	c
my	c
suprise	i
it	c
turned	c
out	c
to	c
be	c
much	c
more	c
fun	c
that	i
expected	c
.	c

About	c
20	c
people	c
were	c
helping	c
apart	c
from	c
me	c
,	i
we	i
had	c
some	i
kind	c
of	c
rotation	c
system	c
so	c
that	c
all	c
the	c
volunteers	c
could	c
also	c
enjoy	c
some	c
of	c
the	c
concert	c
.	c

The	c
hard	c
work	c
,	c
though	c
,	c
started	c
when	c
everyone	c
left	c
at	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
the	c
concert	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
in	c
fact	c
more	c
fun	c
than	c
the	c
concert	c
itself	c
;	c
believe	c
it	c
or	c
not	c
,	c
all	c
the	c
popstars	i
came	c
to	c
help	c
us	c
clean	c
up	c
and	c
we	c
all	c
had	c
a	c
food	c
fight	c
with	c
the	c
left-overs	i
!	c

If	c
you	c
ever	c
know	c
of	c
a	c
concert	c
that	c
needs	c
volunteers	c
tell	c
me	c
,	c
I	c
'm	c
in	c
!	c
!	c

Write	c
back	c
soon	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

Indeed	c
,	c
I	c
recently	c
spent	c
a	c
week	c
's	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
and	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
to	c
see	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
really	c
a	c
very	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
.	c

Indeed	c
,	c
he	c
was	c
replaced	c
by	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
for	c
this	c
evening	c
.	c

Additionally	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
instead	c
of	c
19:30	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
pay	c
the	c
full	c
price	c
for	c
my	c
ticket	c
as	c
no	c
discount	c
was	c
available	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
the	c
worst	c
was	c
to	c
come	c
as	c
it	c
was	c
impossible	c
to	c
eat	c
something	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
can	c
imagine	c
my	c
great	c
disappointment	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Science	c
and	c
technology	c
have	c
played	c
an	c
important	c
role	c
for	c
the	c
last	c
twenty	c
years	c
and	c
the	c
development	c
of	c
the	i
modern	c
technology	c
has	c
especially	c
affected	c
our	c
lives	c
.	c

This	c
latter	i
is	c
a	c
new	c
media	i
which	c
has	c
changed	c
my	c
life	c
,	c
as	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
marvellous	c
tool	c
to	i
communicate	i
,	c
learn	i
or	c
have	i
fun	c
.	c

At	c
the	c
present	c
time	c
,	c
thanks	c
to	c
my	c
credit	c
card	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
really	c
buy	c
what	c
I	c
want	c
,	c
when	c
I	c
want	c
and	c
where	c
I	c
want	c
!	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
many	c
other	c
discoveries	c
in	i
relation	i
with	i
the	i
modern	c
technology	c
which	c
affect	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c

Dear	c

,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
provide	c
you	c
with	c
the	c
information	c
you	c
require	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
rather	c
be	i
accomodationed	i
in	c
log	i
cabins	i
than	c
go	i
in	c
tens	i
.	c

Thirsthly	i
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
swimming	i
and	c
playing	i
tennis	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
practising	i
them	i
since	c
I	c
was	c
I	c
child	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
I	c
very	i
good	c
in	i
each	c
other	i
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
if	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
some	c
money	c
,	c
or	c
everything	i
is	c
provided	c
for	i
the	c
organisers	c

I	c
look	c

from	c
you	c

Dear	c
Kim	c

A	c
few	c
minutes	c
later	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
and	c
the	c
grup	i
appeared	c
on	c
the	c
stage	c
.	c

Later	c
,	c
when	c
the	c
show	c
had	c
finished	c
,	c
I	c
stayed	c
with	c
the	c
grup	i
in	c
their	c
room	c
for	c
a	c
few	c
minutes	c
.	c

What	c
I	c
really	c
liked	c
doing	c
was	c
to	i
helped	i
them	c
with	c
their	c
clothes	c
and	c
to	i
make-up	c
them	i
,	c
because	c
I	c
learnt	c
how	c
to	c
make-up	i
a	i
person	i
and	c
I	c
spend	i
a	c
few	c
minutes	c
with	c
the	c
most	c
popular	c
grup	i
of	i
the	c

Love	c

As	c
well	c

this	c

after	c
seeing	c
the	c

I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
,	c
which	c
you	c
referred	c
in	i
your	c
advertisement	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
already	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
to	c
buy	c
an	c
adult	c
ticket	c
for	c
my	c
child	c
and	c
spent	c
more	c
money	c
than	c
I	c
had	c
expected	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
not	c
perfect	i
evening	c
for	c
me	c
and	c
my	c
child	c
at	c
all	c
!	c

I	c
am	c
also	c
sure	c
you	c
can	c
refund	c
my	c

Therefore	c

it	c
would	c
be	c
better	c
to	c
go	c
there	c
in	c
July	c

July	c
should	c

According	i
on	i
the	c
table	c
with	i
the	i
activities	c

I	c
will	i
choose	i
singing	c

swimming	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
very	c
good	c

and	c
very	i
fanatic	i

I	c
've	c
ever	c
had	c
in	c
my	c
whole	c
life	c

It	c

I	c
did	c
n't	c
really	c
have	c

to	c
complein	i
about	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
a	c
very	c
disapointing	i
evening	c
because	c
of	c
many	c
things	c
.	c

First	c
the	c
actor	c
was	c
a	c
wery	i
common	i
actor	c
.	c

then	i
it	c
start	i
's	i
45	c
minutes	c
lent	i
.	c

Also	c
in	c
the	c
advicement	i
they	c
talk	c
about	c
discount	c
tikets	i
.	c

And	c
at	i
last	i
I	c
could	c
n't	c
visit	c
the	c
theater	i
restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
,	i
why	i
?	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c

It	c
was	c
alwais	i
the	c
saim	i
.	c

And	c
it	c
was	c
to	i
slow	c
.	c

Because	c
all	i
these	c
things	c
it	c
obiously	i
was	c
n't	c
the	c
perfect	c
evening	c
as	c
it	i
's	i
seid	i
in	c
the	c

.	c

So	c
I	c
wrought	i
this	c
letter	c
to	c
ask	c
for	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

This	c
problem	c
with	c
Pat	c
had	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
consecuences	i
,	c
because	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
very	c
hevy	i
discucion	i
with	c
her	c
about	c
that	i
,	i
it	i
was	c
so	c
heay	i
that	c
one	c
of	c
ower	i
teachers	c
had	c
to	c
calm	c
me	c

Dear	c

'm	c

For	i
the	c
accomodation	i
,	c
if	c
is	i
possible	c
I	c
would	c

Also	c
is	i

meet	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
people	c
,	c
and	c
chatting	i
during	c
the	c
night	c
,	c
might	i
around	c
the	c
fire	c
,	c
playing	c
a	c
clutone	i
and	c
singing	c
I	i
think	c
is	i
a	c
nice	c
way	c
to	c
have	c
fun	c
.	c

The	c
other	c
sport	c
that	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
do	c
is	c
swimming	c

Swimming	c

n't	c
like	c
shopping	c
are	c
men	c
or	c
children	c
.	c

In	c
fact	c
if	c
I	c
'm	c
not	c
in	c
the	c
right	c
mood	c
I	c
become	c
nervous	i
because	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
find	c
anything	c
.	c

For	i
the	i
first	i
situation	i
happen	i
to	i
me	i
,	i
when	c
I	c
'm	c
hungry	i
with	c
somebody	c
really	c
close	c
to	c
me	c
like	c
my	c
boyfriend	c
or	c
a	c
component	i
of	c
my	c
family	c
,	c
so	c
for	i
relaxing	i
my	i
mind	i
I	c
go	c
to	i
shopping	c
and	c
usually	c
I	c
enjoy	c
a	i
lot	c
.	c

The	c
opposite	c
situation	c
is	c
when	c
I	c
pass	c
my	c
exams	c
and	c
I	c
really	c
need	c
to	c
buy	c
something	c
for	i
me	i
as	c
a	c
preseant	i
for	c
myself	c
.	c

I	c
had	i
recently	i
spent	i
two	c
days	c
at	c
your	c
annual	c
international	c
arts	c
festival	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
the	c
first	c
time	c
I	c
went	i
and	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
pleased	c
to	c
go	c
.	c

I	i
,	i
actually	i
,	i
was	c
n't	c
disappointed	c
.	c

However	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
give	c
my	c
opinion	c
about	c
the	c
festival	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
congratulate	c
you	c
on	c
making	i
this	c
kind	c
of	c
event	c
.	c

You	c
should	c
increase	c
the	c
number	c
of	c
places	c
you	c
give	i
.	c

Therefore	i
,	c
you	c
could	c
invite	c
artists	c
from	c
around	c
the	c
world	c
not	i
only	c
from	c
six	c
countries	c
:	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
more	c
pleasant	c
.	c

Although	c
I	c
am	c
keen	c
on	c
classical	c
music	c
,	c
I	c
found	c
some	c
concerts	i
halled	i
too	c
small	c
.	c

Finally	c
I	i
suggest	c
to	i
invite	i
important	c
scientists	c
like	c
Hubert	c
Reeves	c
or	c
Aaroun	c
Tazief	c
so	c
as	c
to	c
inform	c
the	c
public	c
about	c
the	i
new	c
technologies	c
or	c
sciences	c
because	c
it	i
also	c
a	i
kind	c
of	c
art	c
!	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
seeing	i
the	c
next	c
festival	c
!	c

Dear	c
Laurel	c
,	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
recent	c
letter	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
n't	c
write	c
sooner	c
because	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
busy	c
last	c
week	c
.	c

To	c
begin	c
with	c
the	c
wchool	i
rules	c
we	i
have	c
in	c
fact	c
some	c
important	c
ones	c
.	c

If	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
make	i
the	c
cooking	c
,	c
I	c
will	c
have	c
to	c
do	c
the	c
washing	c
up	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
sometimes	c
allowed	c
to	c
watch	c
the	c
television	c
when	c
I	c
have	c
finished	c
my	c
homeworks	i
.	c

Fortunately	c
I	i
can	c
play	c
violin	i
when	c
I	c
want	c
even	i
if	c
I	c
have	c
n't	c
done	c
my	c
homework	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
really	c
want	c
to	c
change	c
that	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
just	i
like	c
this	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
this	c
answer	c
satisfies	c
you	c
.	c

Best	c
wishes	c

Last	c
week	c
,	c
I	c
had	i
visited	i
your	c
theatre	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
disappointed	c
because	c
I	c
did	c
not	c
have	c
a	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
like	c
what	i
advertisement	i
said	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
complain	c
four	i
things	c
about	i
your	c
theatre	c
.	c

Fist	i
thing	c
,	c
the	c
actor	c
is	c
very	i
horrible	c
so	c
I	c
recommend	c
you	c
to	i
change	i
the	c
actor	c
because	c
he	c
will	c
make	i
an	i
audience	i
who	i
visit	i
you	i
theatre	i
disappoint	i
.	c

According	i
to	i
the	c
advertisement	c
,	c
it	c
said	c
tickets	i
Â£	i
10	i
,	i
Â£	i
15	i
and	i
Â£	i
20	i
discounts	i
available	i
but	c
when	c
I	c
bought	c
the	c
ticket	c
,	c
the	c
discounts	c
did	i
not	c
available	c

After	c
the	c
show	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
hungry	c
so	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
restaurant	c
in	c
the	c
theatre	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
for	c
decorating	i
that	c
make	i
me	c
very	c
angry	c
and	c
disappoint	i
.	c

To	c
conclude	c
,	c
your	c
theatre	c
is	c
not	i
good	i
like	i
what	i
advertisement	i
said	i
so	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
for	c
some	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
young	c
,	c
I	c
used	c
to	c
walk	c
to	c
school	c
everyday	i
but	c
now	c
my	c
father	c
has	c
a	c
car	c
so	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
to	c
walk	c
anymore	c
,	c
because	c
my	c
father	c
gives	c
me	c
a	c
lift	c
everyday	i
.	c

Therefore	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
will	c
change	c
to	i
bad	c
ways	c
or	c
goods	c
ways	c
,	i
it	i
depends	c
on	c
how	c
I	c
use	c
the	c
technology	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
seen	c
your	c
organasation	i
for	c
the	c
trip	c
.	c

That	i
is	c
really	c
intresting	i
.	c

The	c
show	c
is	c
in	i
14th	c
March	c
on	c
tuesday	i
.	c

My	c
friends	c
told	c
me	c
that	c
if	c
we	c
wake	c
up	c
early	c
on	c
tuesday	i
we	c
can	c
go	c
to	c
Science	i
Museum	c
about	i
8.00	c
in	c
the	c
morning	c
.	c

I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
something	c
about	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
great	i
opportunity	c
for	c
us	c
because	c
when	c
we	c
go	c
there	c
we	c
will	c
be	i
aware	i
of	i
about	c
latest	i
fashions	c
news	c
,	c
we	c
will	c
see	c
leisure	c
and	c
sports	c
wear	c
,	c
all	c
new	i
make	i
up	i
designers	c
(	c
especially	i
for	i
girls	i
)	c
and	c
different	c
hairstyles	c
.	c

We	c
are	c
also	c
enthusiastic	c
about	c
your	i
sightseing	i
in	i
bus	i
and	c
River	i
trip	c
to	c
Greenwich	c
on	c
Monday	c
and	c
visiting	c
to	i
National	i
Art	c
Gallery	c
on	c
Wednesday	c
.	c

Your	c
student	c

What	c
people	i
's	i
homes	i
will	i
it	i
be	i
like	c
in	c
fifty	c
years	i
time	c
?	c

I	c
guess	c
there	c
will	c
be	c
more	c
gadget	i
to	c
do	i
some	i
housework	c
easier	c
.	c

Now	c
IT	c
(	c
information	c
technology	c
)	c
is	c
in	i
our	c
life	c
.	c

It	c
means	c
we	c
wo	i
n't	i
need	i
to	c
go	c
somewhere	i
to	c
get	c
some	i
information	c
we	c
need	c
.	c

Whatever	c
we	c
need	c
we	c
order	c
from	i
to	i
computer	i
and	c
someone	c
will	c
bring	c
.	i

But	c
we	c
ca	c
n't	c
stop	c
to	i
technologic	i
improvement	i
.	c

When	c
people	c
use	c
to	i
the	i
technology	c
they	c
should	c
know	c
that	c
is	i
not	c
everything	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
believe	c
human	i
will	c
never	c
forget	c
what	c
they	c
used	c
to	c
be	c
.	c

Mankind	c
has	c
been	i
always	i
seeking	c
different	c
things	c
.	c

We'are	i
learning	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
things	c
about	c
life	c
.	i

and	c
we	c
are	c
practicing	i
these	c
.	i

Probably	i
our	i
homes	i
will	i
be	c
smaller	c
than	c
now	c
.	c

Because	c
human	i
population	c
is	c
growing	c
quickly	c
and	c
people	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
big	i
cities	c
(	c
like	c
London	c
,	c
New	c
York	c
,	c
Paris	c
)	c
.	c

Beyond	c
the	c
near	c
future	c
may	i
be	i
our	c
homes	c
will	c
be	c
outer	i
space	i
it	i
will	c
be	c
a	i
spaceship	i
.	c

We	c
'll	c
travel	c
around	c
to	i
space	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
just	c
an	c
imagination	i
.	c

We	c
live	c
in	c
changeable	i
world	c
.	c

Like	c
everything	c
our	c
homes	c
will	c
change	c
as	c
well	c
.	c

Dear	c
Madam	c
:	c

How	c
delighted	c
I	c
was	c
when	c
I	c
receved	i
your	c
letter	c
!	c

In	i
relation	i
with	i
leisure	c
activities	c
,	c
my	c
favourites	i
are	i
Basketball	c
,	c
which	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
playing	c
for	c
two	c
years	c
because	i
I	c
have	c
been	c
selected	c
for	c
my	c
University	i
team	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
a	i
time	c
practising	c
with	c
players	c
from	c
different	c
countries	c
will	c
help	c
me	c
develop	c
my	c
skills	c
at	c
international	i
level	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
practise	i
tennis	c
,	c
which	c
is	c
my	c
hobby	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
helps	c
my	c
mind	c
to	c
keep	c
working	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
do	i
I	c
need	c
,	c
how	c
is	i
the	i
weather	i
in	i
order	c
to	c
pack	c
the	c
necessary	c
clothe	i
and	i
wheter	i
I	c
need	c
something	i
else	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
.	c

What	c
a	c
fantastic	c
experience	c
I	c
had	c
helping	c
my	c
favourite	c
group	c
!	c

You	c
would	c
n't	c
believe	c
it	c
!	c

But	c
the	c
most	c
exciting	c
part	c
of	c
my	c
job	c
,	c
and	c
the	c
one	c
that	c
I	c
was	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
,	c
was	c
the	c
last	c
night	c
of	c
concert	i
,	c
because	c
all	c
the	c
staff	c
were	c
promised	c
to	i
have	i
a	c
party	c
with	c
all	c
the	c
members	c
of	c
the	c
band	c
.	c

That	c
night	c
was	c
the	c
best	c
of	c
my	c
entire	c
life	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
as	c
I	c
feel	c
that	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
more	c
exciting	c
than	c
staying	c
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
offered	c
me	c
two	c
activities	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
on	i
swimming	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
been	c
learning	c
swimming	i
for	c
the	c
last	c
eight	c
months	c
and	c
I	c
really	i
enjoyed	i
it	c
.	c

Have	c
you	c
had	i
any	c
recommendations	c
what	i
type	c
of	c
cloths	i
should	i
I	i
take	c
with	c
me	c
?	c

Will	c
there	c
be	c
any	i
tour-guide	i
during	c
the	c
trip	c
?	c

I	c
thank	c
you	c
again	c
for	c
your	c
assistance	c
and	c
am	c
looking	c
forwards	c
to	c
hearing	c

It	c
has	c
been	c
quite	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
since	c
I	c
last	c
written	i
to	c
you	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
something	c
really	c
exciting	c
to	c
share	c
with	c
you	c
.	c

There	c
was	c
a	c
concert	i
of	i
Michael	i
Jackson	i
in	c
my	c
city	c
last	c
month	c

My	c

to	i

the	c

what	c

,	i
we	i
were	c
asked	c

It	i
was	i

a	i

Kim	i
but	i
just	c
asked	c
him	c
a	c
couple	c
of	c
questions	c
behind	c
the	c
stage	c

I	c
was	c
so	c
nervous	c
that	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
remember	c
what	c
to	c
say	c

If	c

yourself	c
talking	c
to	c
the	i
most	i
famous	i
pop	c

such	c
as	c
him	c
how	i
would	i
you	i
feel	c

But	c
what	c
I	c
really	c
enjoyed	c
on	i
that	c
evening	c
was	c
when	c
we	c
took	i
a	i
photographs	i
with	c
him	c
after	c
his	c

he	c
signed	c
it	i
for	c
us	c
on	c
the	c
back	i
side	i

We	c
had	c
a	c
wonderful	c
evening	c

His	c
concert	c
was	c
absolutely	c
brilliant	c

I	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
of	i
"	c
OVER	c
THE	c
RAINBOW	c
"	c
which	c
I	c
saw	c
on	c
15th	c
of	c
June	c
in	c
your	c
theatre	c
.	c

Because	c
its	c
opening	c
time	c
was	c
from	c
10:00	c
to	c
17:00	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
am	c
asking	c
to	i
refund	c
all	c
the	c
money	c
.	c

Thanking	c
for	i
your	c
prompt	c
attention	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c

Yours	c
Faithfully	c

THE	c
REVOLUTION	c
OF	c
INFORMATION	c
TECHNOLOGY	c

I	c
am	i
checking	i
my	c
e-mail	c
everyday	i
using	c
the	c
Internet	c
,	c
I	c
am	i
talking	i
to	c
my	c
friends	c
who	c
is	i
far	c
away	c
connecting	i
to	c
network	c
systems	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
am	i
taking	i
my	c
mobile	c
phone	c
.	c

For	i
recent	c
years	c
,	c
as	c
Information	c
Technology	c
has	c
been	c
improved	c
highly	i
,	c
communication	c
methods	c
have	c
been	c
changed	c
to	c
a	c
different	c
way	c
,	c
which	c
is	c
not	c
same	i
as	c
before	c
.	c

A	c
few	c
years	c
ago	c
,	c
I	c
did	c
not	c
know	c
what	c
Internet	i
was	c
,	c
how	c
to	c
use	c
it	c
and	c
so	c
on	c
.	c

But	c
,	c
while	c
those	i
have	i
been	i
spread	i
all	c
over	c
the	c
world	c
,	c
I	c
and	c
all	c
the	c
other	c
people	c
who	c
I	c
have	c
known	c
became	i
to	c
use	c
them	c
.	c

I	c
can	c
find	c
out	c
some	c
information	c
at	c
home	c
,	c
although	c
I	c
do	c
not	c
go	c
to	c
library	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
able	c
to	c
meet	c
my	c
friends	c
quickly	c
in	i
Internet	i
just	i
clicking	c
the	c
mouse	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
to	c
these	c
,	i
I	c
can	c
contact	c
to	i
anyone	c
who	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
talk	c
at	i
any	c
convenient	c
time	c
in	c
case	c
I	c
need	c
him	c
or	c
her	c
,	c
or	c
I	c
am	c
needed	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
causing	c
some	c
changes	c
to	i
me	c
.	c

13	c
.	c

It	c
would	c
be	c
great	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
U.S.A	c
as	c
the	c
prize	c
and	c
to	c
stay	c
for	c
two	c
weeks	c
.	c

Below	c
is	c
the	c
information	c
you	c
requested	c
me	i
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
got	c
a	c
prior	c
plan	c
to	c
teach	c
the	i
Korean	c
children	c
in	c
Brighton	c
about	c
Korean	i
and	c
Korean	c
history	c
in	c
the	i
early	c
August	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
stay	c
at	i
log	c
cabins	c
which	c
would	c
have	c
a	c
good	c
smell	c
of	c
nature	c
in	c
them	c
.	c

Also	c
if	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
choose	c
two	c
of	c
the	c
activities	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
play	c
tennis	c
and	c
to	c
go	c
surfing	c
because	c
playing	c
tennis	c
is	c
my	c
first	c
choice	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

There	c
are	c
a	c
few	c
reasons	c
.	c

You	c
may	c
only	c
get	c
tired	c
on	i
your	i
feet	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
you	c
cannot	c
exclude	i
that	c
you	c
might	c
get	c
a	i
pick-pocket	c
which	c
would	c
make	c
you	c
upset	c
and	c
irritated	c
when	c
you	c
think	c
of	c
that	i
you	c
could	c
avoid	c
it	c
and	c
that	c
you	c
could	c
take	c
less	c
money	c
in	c
your	c
wallet	c
from	i
home	i
.	c

Sometimes	c
,	c
a	c
moment	c
comes	c
up	i
that	c
you	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
buy	c
something	c
you	c
have	c
not	c
wanted	c
because	c
while	c
you	c
are	c
shopping	c
,	c
you	c
might	c
get	c
something	c
beautiful	c
or	c
good	c
to	c
you	c
.	c

13th	c
June	c
2000	c

Firstly	c
,	c
let	c
me	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
nice	c
letter	c
of	c
June	c
10th	c
.	c

In	c
response	c
to	c
your	c
question	c
and	c
if	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
mind	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
I	c
've	c
already	c
chosen	i
my	c
holiday	c
and	c
my	c
boss	c
wo	c
n't	c
give	c
me	c
another	c
one	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
no	i
more	i
a	i
young	i
girl	i
!	i
and	c
do	c
appreciate	c
a	c
little	c
bit	c
of	c
comfort	c
.	c

Would	c
you	c
be	c
so	c
kind	c
as	c
to	c
write	c
me	i
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c
because	c
I	c
need	c
the	c
accurate	i
date	c
of	c
the	c
journey	c
.	c

I	c
've	c
got	c
four	c
children	c
and	c
have	c
to	c
organise	c
their	c
time	c
without	c
mother	i
.	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
exactly	c
which	i
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
with	c
and	i
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	i
'll	i
be	i
supposed	i
to	c
spend	c
there	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
really	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	i
,	c

It	c
starts	c
with	c
food	c
(	c
monstruous	i
)	c
and	c
goes	c
on	c
with	i
clothes	c
,	c
pills	c
,	c
games	c
and	c
so	c
on	c
.	c

It	c
never	c
ends	c
!	c

I	c
find	c
it	c
a	i
very	c
relaxing	c
moment	i
.	c

At	c
home	c
,	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
work	c
hard	c
and	c
you	c
're	c
often	c
stressful	i
because	c
of	i
your	c
children	c
always	i
asking	c
you	c
for	c
something	c
.	c

When	c
you	c
're	c
shopping	c
,	c
you	c
can	c
finally	c
relax	c
,	c
just	c
admiring	c
what	c
you	i
're	i
seeing	i
.	c

Your	c
only	c
work	i
consist	i
in	c
choosing	c
what	c
suits	c
you	c
or	c
buying	c
what	c
you	c
prefer	c
for	c
dinner	c
for	i
instance	c
;	c
furthermore	c
you	c
're	c
not	c
disturbed	c
:	c
it	c
's	c
a	c
dream	c
!	c

You	c
'll	c
understand	c
,	c
I	c
'm	c
sure	c
,	c
that	i
I	c
prefer	c
shopping	c
at	c
the	c
beginning	c
of	c
every	c
month	c
.	c

In	c
order	c
to	c
change	c
this	c
situation	c
I	c
could	i
win	i
the	c
lottery	c
:	c
a	i
dream	c
too	i
!	c

Our	c
English	c
class	c
has	c
an	c
additional	c
wish	c
concerning	c
the	c
programme	c
of	i
our	c
trip	c
.	c

We	c
have	c
seen	c
an	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
"	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
"	c
and	c
we	c
would	c
all	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

We	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
because	c
it	c
only	c
takes	c
place	c
once	c
a	c
year	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
free	c
for	c
students	c
.	c

We	c
would	c
suggest	c
to	i
replace	i
the	c
shopping	c
part	i
on	c
Tuesday	c
afternoon	c
by	i
the	c
visit	c
of	i
the	c
show	c
.	c

Please	c
think	c
about	c
our	c
suggestion	c
and	c
the	c
proposed	c
change	c
of	i
the	c
programme	c
.	c

Best	c
regards	c

The	c
home	c
of	c
the	c
future	c

The	c
view	c
from	c
outside	c
will	c
mainly	c
be	c
the	c
same	c
.	c

The	c
difference	c
will	c
be	c
inside	c
the	c
buildings	c
.	c

The	c
fridge	c
,	c
the	c
television	c
,	c
the	c
stove	c
and	c
the	c
Hi-Fi	i
equipment	c
will	c
be	c
attached	c
to	c
a	c
computer	c
network	c
.	c

Every	c
electronic	c
gadget	c
in	c
the	c
futur	i
home	c
will	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
comunicate	i
with	c
other	c
machines	c
or	c
computers	c
.	c

It	c
will	c
be	c
possible	c
to	c
connect	c
to	c
the	c
Internet	c
from	c
nearly	c
everywhere	c
in	c
the	c
house	c
or	c
flat	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
sure	c
all	c
the	c
things	c
which	c
are	c
based	c
on	c
electronic	c
parts	c
will	c
totally	c
change	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
think	c
there	c
will	c
not	c
be	c
many	c
changes	c
concerning	c
the	c
furnishing	c
of	c
the	c
future	c
homes	c
.	c

I	c
suppose	c
our	c
future	c
homes	c
will	c
be	c
a	c
mix	c
of	c
new	c
technologies	c
and	c
good	c
old	c
tradition	c
.	c

It	c
has	c
always	c
been	c
like	c
that	c
.	c

I	c
received	c
your	c
letter	c
last	c
monday	i
.	c

It	c
will	c
be	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
United	c
States	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
so	c
happy	c
about	c
that	c
,	i
I	c
can	i
not	i
explain	c
it	c
.	c

You	c
want	c
to	i
know	i
some	c
further	c
information	c
from	c
me	c
.	c

I	i
would	i
prefer	i
to	i
the	i
accommodation	i
at	i
the	i
camp	i
a	c
tent	c
,	i
the	i
reason	c
is	c
that	c
I	c
like	c
to	c
live	c
realy	i
natural	i
and	c
it	c
is	c
more	c
enjoyable	c
to	c
live	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
then	i
in	c
cabins	i
.	c

As	i
activities	c
I	i
can	c
say	c
that	c
I	c
like	c
every	c
sport	c
,	c
but	c
basketball	c
and	c
tennis	c
would	c
be	c
perfect	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

In	c
basketball	c
I	c
have	c
more	i
practise	i
then	i
in	c
tennis	c
.	c

I	c
play	c
every	c
weekend	c
on	i
competitions	c
with	c
my	c
local	c
team	c
and	c
about	i
tennis	i
it	i
is	i
that	i
I	i
tried	i
but	i
it	i
is	i
not	i
like	i
my	i
basketball	i
experience	i
.	c

Please	c
write	c
me	i
your	i
answer	c
as	c
quick	i
as	c
possible	c

JosÃ©	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

As	c
I	c
told	c
you	c
in	c
my	c
previous	c
letter	c
I	c
finally	c
had	c
the	c
opportunity	c
to	c
take	c
part	c
on	i
the	c
Sting	c
concert	c
here	c
in	c
Segovia	c
.	c

Not	c
yet	c
.	c

Very	c
heavy	c
things	c
,	c
those	c
which	c
Sting	c
uses	c
to	c
make	c
his	c
show	c
even	c
more	c
spectacular	c
.	c

Have	c
you	c
seen	c
the	c
giant	c
screen	c
behind	c
him	c
in	c
every	c
concert	c
?	c

I	c
was	c
the	c
one	c
who	c
put	c
it	c
there	c
in	c
Segovia	c
.	c

Well	c
,	c
some	c
others	c
helped	c
me	c
in	i
the	c
task	c
,	c
but	c
that	c
did	c
not	c
make	c
it	c
much	c
easier	c
.	c

Any	i
way	i
,	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
great	c
experience	c
and	c
I	c
enjoy	i
it	c
very	c
much	c
.	c

The	c
part	c
I	c
enjoyed	c
most	c
was	c
the	c
one	c
when	c
they	c
paid	c
me	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
n't	c
much	c
but	c
that	c
means	c
nothing	c
when	c
you	c
have	c

first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competion	i

I	c
would	c

The	c
only	c
one	i
term	i
for	c
me	c
to	c
visit	c
you	c
is	c
July	c
.	c

I	c
can	c
come	c
to	c
USA	c
on	i
July	c
becouse	i
on	i
August	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
working	c
with	c
my	c
father	c
.	c

We	c
are	c
building	c
a	c
new	c
house	c
for	c
our	c
family	c
.	c

on	i
July	c
are	c
hot	c
.	c

Tent	i
will	c
be	c
more	i
cooler	i
to	c
sleep	c
then	i
the	i
cabin	c
.	c

Basketball	c
is	c
the	c
game	c
which	c
I	c
love	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
qustions	i
to	i
.	c

How	c
much	c
money	c
should	c
I	c
take	c
with	c
me	c
and	c
what	c
sort	c
of	c
clothes	c

requested	i

Yours	c

Shoping	i
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

We	c
could	c
only	c
buy	c
things	c
from	c
Russia	c
.	c

Nowadays	c
we	c
have	c
capitalism	c
,	c
free	c
market	c
lots	i
of	c
privete	i
shops	c
,	c
markets	c
and	c
super-markets	i
.	c

Polish	c
super	i
market	i
are	c
not	c
Polish	i
origin	i
shops	c
.	c

They	c
are	c
imported	c
from	c
enother	i
Western	c
Europe	i
country	c
.	c

But	c
the	c
problem	c
is	c
when	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
buy	c
only	c
one	c
thing	c
,	c
for	c
example	c
bread	c

17	c
May	c
2000	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Mam	i
,	c

In	c
other	c
words	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
disaster	c
.	c

Maybe	c
you	c
could	c
explain	c
to	c
me	c
,	i
what	c
the	c
problems	c
were	c
.	c

The	c
most	c
disappointing	c
thing	c
was	c
that	c
there	c
were	c
diffrent	i
actors	c
which	i
were	c
not	c
very	c
good	c
in	i
acting	c
.	c

And	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
we	c
did	c
n't	c
know	c
what	c
to	c
do	c
with	c
the	c
rest	c
of	c
the	c
evening	c
,	c
because	c
we	c
actually	c
wanted	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
Theatre	c
Restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
n't	c
realy	i
a	c
perfect	c
evening	c
like	i
you	c
promised	c
on	c
your	c
flyer	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
disapointed	i
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
have	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

Some	c
people	c
might	c
be	c
silly	c
enough	c
to	c
pay	c
for	c
such	c
a	c
bad	c
show	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

How	c
has	c
modern	c
technology	c
changed	c
your	c
daily	c
life	c
?	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
modern	c
technology	c
made	i
the	i
life	c
for	c
many	c
people	c
easier	c
.	c

Modern	c
technology	c
also	c
allows	c
you	c
to	c
go	c
into	i
the	c
Internet	c
to	c
get	c
any	c
information	c
you	c
need	c
.	c

Every	i
thing	i
is	c
controlled	c
and	c
produced	c
by	c
machines	c
.	c

The	c
only	c
and	c
simple	c
advantage	c
of	c
modern	c
technology	c
is	c
just	c
taking	c
the	c
work	c
from	c
us	c
so	c
we	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
to	c
do	c
anything	c
anymore	c
.	c

Another	c
disadvantage	c
is	c
that	c
every	i
one	i
becomes	c
a	c
bit	c
more	c
lonely	c
because	c
they	c
wath	i
TV	c
or	c
play	c
or	c
work	c
with	i
the	c
Computer	c
and	c
do	c
n't	c
see	c
each	c
other	c
any	i
more	i
because	c
they	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
to	c
.	c

You	c
never	c
get	c
bored	c
.	c

Mr.	c
Manager	c
of	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
,	c

Let	c
me	c
tell	c
you	c
now	c
how	c
everything	c
really	c
was	c
.	c

One	c
of	c
the	c
reason	i
I	c
went	c
to	c
see	c
that	c
particular	c
show	c
,	i
was	c
the	c
starring	c
actor	c
announced	i
in	c
the	c
add	i
,	i
Danny	i
Brook	c
,	c
but	c
when	c
the	c
show	c
actually	c
started	c
,	c
with	i
forty	i
five	i
minutes	i
delay	c
,	c
I	c
realized	c
that	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
was	c
not	c
in	c
the	c
play	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
for	c
these	c
reasons	c
that	c
I	c
expect	c
a	c
full	c
refund	c
of	c
the	c
ticket	c
prize	i
,	i
it	i
is	c
my	c
right	c
as	c
a	c
paying	c
customer	c
to	c
get	c
what	c
I	c
have	c
paid	c
for	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
the	c
life	c
we	c
live	c
is	c
easier	c
than	c
our	i
parents	c
,	i
thanks	c
to	c
technology	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Ryan	c
,	c

My	c
summer	c
holidays	c
last	c
for	c
two	c
months	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
just	i
have	c
time	c
in	c
July	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
the	i
accommodation	i
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
.	c

For	c
one	c
night	c
it	c
would	c
not	c
disturb	i
me	c
to	c
sleep	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
,	c
but	c
for	c
a	c
period	c
of	c
two	c
weeks	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
too	c
uncomfortable	c
.	c

At	c
the	c
Camp	i
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
sailing	c
a	c
lot	c
.	c

Because	c
most	i
of	i
the	i
work	i
did	i
my	i
parents	i
,	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
exactly	c
how	c
to	c
handle	c
a	c
sailing	c
boat	c
.	c

As	c
the	c
second	c
activity	c
I	c
have	c
chosen	c
to	c
make	i
photos	c
.	c

I	i
'm	i
used	i
to	i
be	i
the	c
photographer	c
at	i
the	i
holidays	i
with	i
my	i
family	i
and	c
I	c
know	c
how	c
a	c
camera	c
works	c
.	c

Finally	c
I	c
have	c
some	c
questions	c
concerning	c
the	c
clothes	c
I	c
am	c
going	c
to	c
need	c
and	c
how	i
much	i
money	i
I	i
should	i
estimately	i
take	c
with	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
just	c
want	c
to	c
know	c
,	i
what	c
I	c
will	c
have	c
to	c
pay	c
alone	i
.	c

Yours	c

The	c
statement	c
mentioned	c
is	c
perfectly	c
suitable	i
to	i
my	c
opinion	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
want	c
to	c
buy	c
new	c
clothes	c
for	c
summer	c
the	c
biggest	c
difficulty	c
is	c
to	c
find	c
a	c
shop	c
,	i
which	c
sells	c
what	c
you	c
are	c
looking	c
for	c
.	c

Once	c
you	c
've	c
found	c
you	i
should	c
take	c
everything	c
you	c
like	c
and	c
go	c
into	c
the	c
cabin	i
.	c

It	c
's	c
a	c
big	c
advantage	c
to	c
go	c
shopping	c
with	c
a	c
friend	c
,	c
because	c
he	c
or	c
she	c
can	c
bring	c
you	c
all	c
the	c
clothes	c
in	c
a	i
suitable	i
size	c
if	c
the	c
one	i
you	c
took	c
does	c
n't	c
fit	c
.	c

After	c
trying	c
on	c
about	c
twenty	c
different	c
tops	c
,	c
dresses	c
or	c
jeans	c
your	c
legs	c
and	c
your	c
back	c
start	c
to	c
hurt	c
terribly	c
.	c

At	i
the	i
end	i
you	c
may	c
have	c
found	c
only	c
two	c
or	c
three	c
things	c
you	c
really	c
like	c
,	c
but	c
they	c
are	c
all	i
the	i
work	i
worth	i
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c

Secondly	c
,	c
it	c
ought	c
to	c
start	c
at	c
19:30	c
but	c
it	c
really	c
started	c
at	c
20:30	c
.	c

According	c
to	c
the	c
advertisement	c
,	c
the	i
discounts	c
were	i
available	c
.	c

After	c
the	c
show	c
I	c
intended	c
to	c
visit	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
as	i
you	c
have	i
known	i
that	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
late	c
,	c
therefore	i
the	c
restaurant	c
had	c
closed	c
before	c
the	c
show	c
finished	c
.	c

As	i
I	i
have	i
informed	i
you	i
all	i
the	i
fact	i
,	c
I	c
think	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
not	c
worth	c
the	c
money	c
I	c
paid	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
want	c
the	i
refund	c
for	i
Â£	c
15	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c
.	c

Your	i
faithfully	c

The	c
next	c
day	c
,	c
Pat	c
told	c
everybody	c
what	c
she	c
had	c
heard	c
from	c
Jan	c
,	c
so	c
when	c
the	c
news	c
came	c
to	c
teachers	i
'	c
ears	c
,	c
the	c
teachers	c
decided	c
to	c
give	c
Tim	c
grade	i
F	c
in	c
that	c
subject	c
and	c
tell	c
his	c
parents	c
!	c
!	c

He	c
was	c
furious	c
with	c
Jan	c
,	c
so	c
what	c
happened	c
was	c
Jan	c
was	c
bullied	c
but	c
not	c
because	c
of	c
her	c
fault	i
,	i
it	i
was	c
Pat	c
's	c
.	c

Actually	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
was	c
right	c
to	c
tell	c
the	c
teachers	c
but	c
not	c
in	c
Pat	c
's	c
way	c
.	c

Her	c
parents	c
have	c
been	c
so	c
upset	c
that	c
they	c
have	c
asked	c
the	c
school	c
to	c
help	c
thier	i
child	c
and	c
that	c
is	c
the	c
reason	c
why	c
I	c
'm	c
writing	c
this	c
story	c
.	c

If	c
all	c
of	c
us	c
try	c
to	c
help	c
her	c
,	c
I	c
'm	c
sure	c
that	c
we	c
can	c
make	i
her	i
a	i
better	i
school	i
life	i
.	c

Miss	i
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
only	c
July	i
because	c
I	c
think	c
,	i
it	c
's	c
the	c
best	c
month	c
for	c
enjoy	i
my	c
holidays	c
.	c

About	i
my	c
accommodation	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
because	c
it	c
's	c
more	c
confortable	i
than	c
a	c
tent	c
and	c
less	c
hot	c
with	i
the	i
sun	i
.	c

Nevertheless	i
,	c
I	c
hope	c
,	c
there	c
are	i
water	c
and	c
light	c
inside	c
this	c
log	c
cabine	i

Surfing	c
because	c
I	c
never	c
do	c
it	c
and	c
I	c
will	i
like	c
to	c
learn	c
it	i
.	c

2	c
.	c

succed	i
at	i
a	i
good	i
level	i
.	c

Can	c
I	c
change	c
some	c
moneys	i
in	i
the	c
Camp	i
or	c
near	c
it	c
?	c

Is	c
it	c
possible	c
to	c
come	c
with	c
another	c
person	c
?	c

And	c
know	i
the	i
different	c
prices	c
for	c
the	c
same	c
holidays	i
?	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
answer	i
my	c
different	c
questions	c
.	c

Salutations	i
.	i

But	c
,	i
it	c
's	c
not	c
easy	c
for	c
workers	c
,	c
because	c
the	c
shops	c
close	c
their	c
doors	c
about	c
5.30	c
pm	c
(	c
half	c
past	c
five	c
)	c
.	c

If	c
not	c
,	c
you	c
can	c
go	c
the	i
Saturdays	c
but	c
badly	i
,	c
there	i
are	c
too	c
costumers	i
.	c

You	c
ca	c
n't	c
walk	c
,	c
try	i
clothes	c
,	i
it	i
's	c
very	c
hot	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
different	c
than	i
the	c
other	c
European	c
countries	c
.	c

Sometimes	c
the	c
sales	i
women	i
are	c
n't	c
friendship	i
,	c
because	c
they	c
have	i
some	i
stress	i
or	c
they	c
are	i
n't	i
the	i
sale	i
feeling	i
.	c

Finally	c
I	c
think	c
,	i
it	c
will	c
be	c
better	c
if	c
the	c
shops	c
stay	c
open	c
until	c
7.30	c
pm	c
(	c
half	c
past	c
seven	c
)	c

Dear	c
Ms.	c
Ryan	c
,	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
July	c
is	c
the	c
only	c
month	c
I	c
can	c
travel	c
in	c
because	c
I	c
will	c
have	c
to	c
start	c
working	c
from	c
August	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
when	c
I	c
am	c
at	c
the	c
Camp	c
so	c
that	c
I	c
can	c
enjoy	c
the	c
great	c
atmosphere	c
which	c
tents	c
only	c
can	c
make	c
and	c
I	c
love	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
also	c
like	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
which	c
two	c
activities	c
I	c
am	c
keen	c
to	c
do	c
at	c
the	c
Camp	c
.	c

The	c
other	c
one	c
is	c
tennis	c
,	c
which	c
is	c
also	c
my	c
favorite	i
sports	i
and	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
playing	c
for	c
several	c
years	c
.	c

I	c
go	c
to	c
elementary	c
school	c
to	c
teach	c
children	c
how	c
to	c
play	c
tennis	c
every	c
Wednesday	c
and	c
Friday	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
therefore	c
writing	c
to	c
enquire	c
about	c
some	c
things	c
.	c

Lastly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
how	c
many	c
people	c
are	c
comming	i
to	c
the	c
Camp	c
I	c
will	c
go	c

Favorite	i
lessons	c

Not	c
surprisingly	c
,	c
football	c

after	c
school	c
generally	c
(	c
over	c
30	c
per	c

)	c
and	c
also	c
about	c
25	c

Amazingly	c
,	c
over	c
20	c
per	c

Greenwich	c
might	c
be	c
fascinating	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
about	c
the	c
show	c
which	c
we	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
see	c
:	c
It	c
is	c
"	c
The	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
"	c
,	c
which	c
is	c
going	c
to	c
take	c
place	c
at	c
the	c
"	i
Central	c
Exibition	i
Hall	c
in	c
London	c
,	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
the	c
14th	c
March	c
,	c
between	c
10.00	c
and	c
19.00	c
.	c

The	c
latest	c
fashions	c
,	c
leisure	c
and	c
sports	c
wear	c
,	c
make	i
up	i
and	c
hairstyles	c
will	c
be	c
shown	c
in	i
this	c
occasion	c
.	c

We	c
think	c
that	c
this	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
because	c
it	c
takes	c
part	i
only	c
once	c
a	c
year	c
and	c
,	c
on	c
top	c
of	c
all	c
,	i
it	c
is	c
free	c
for	c
students	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
will	c
consider	c
our	c
request	c

I	i
was	c
dangerous	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
knew	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
absolutely	c
no	c
choice	c
.	c

We	c
had	c
walked	c
for	c
three	c
hours	c
(	c
my	c
mother	c
,	c
my	c
two	c
brother	i
and	c
I	c
)	c
through	c
the	c
humid	c
and	c
noisy	c
jungle	c
,	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
reach	i
a	c
small	c
but	c
clean	c
house	c
where	c
a	c
nice	c
and	c
friendly	c
family	c
,	c
old	c
friends	c
of	c
us	i
,	c
used	c
to	c
live	c
.	c

The	c
path	c
we	c
were	c
walking	c
in	i
was	c
quite	c
clean	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
feeling	c
really	c
happy	c
and	c
relaxed	c
...	c
until	c
we	c
reached	c
a	c
river	c
.	c

My	c
mother	c
and	c
brothers	c
had	c
already	c
crossed	c
the	c
river	c
,	c
and	c
they	c
were	c
encouraging	c
me	c
to	c
do	c
the	c
same	c
from	c
the	c
other	c
side	c
of	c
it	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
was	c
paralysed	c
with	c
fear	c
.	c

Then	c
,	c
I	c
suddenly	c
realised	c
that	c
I	c
had	c
no	c
choice	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
took	i
all	c
my	c
courage	c
,	c
a	i
big	c
deep	c
breath	c
,	c
and	c
crossed	c
it	c
!	c

That	c
day	c
,	c
I	c
learnt	c
that	c
I	c
can	c
do	i
even	i
things	c
which	c
,	c
at	c
first	c
sight	c
,	c
seem	c
impossible	c
to	c
be	i
done	i
.	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
pleased	c
to	c
hear	c
that	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
inform	i
you	c
the	c
information	c
you	c
asked	c
me	c
.	i

As	c
for	c
the	c
date	c
to	c
travel	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
there	c
in	c
July	c
.	c

I	c
never	c
could	c
sleep	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
in	c
my	c
life	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
also	c
very	c
pleased	c
to	c
hear	c
that	c
I	c
could	c
do	c
some	c
activities	c
.	c

As	i
photography	c
,	c
swimming	c
is	c
my	c
best	c
way	i
of	c
relaxation	c
.	c

It	c
would	c
be	c
grateful	i
if	c
I	c
could	c
go	c
swimming	c
during	c
the	c
stays	i
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
should	c
take	c
there	c
,	c
and	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
would	c
need	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

Although	c
shopping	c
is	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
most	c
popular	c
ways	c
to	c
reduce	c
your	c
stress	c
,	c
this	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
the	c
case	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
if	c
you	c
want	c
to	c
buy	c
nice	c
dresses	c
,	c
the	c
first	c
thing	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
do	c
is	c
looking	i
around	c
all	c
shops	i
and	c
department	c
stores	c
in	c
a	c
city	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
are	c
lucky	c
enough	c
,	c
you	c
might	c
find	c
them	c
within	c
30	c
minutes	c
,	c
but	c
if	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
,	c
you	c
might	c
have	c
to	c
keep	c
walking	c
for	c
several	c
hours	c
and	c
still	c
could	i
n't	i
find	c
ones	i
!	c
!	c

Next	c
thing	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
do	c
is	c
trying	i
them	c
on	c
.	c

You	c
have	c
to	c
be	c
patient	c
enough	c
to	c
tolerate	c
long	c
queues	c
for	c
fitting	c
rooms	c
.	c

After	c
that	c
what	c
is	c
waiting	c
for	c
you	c
is	c
the	c
struggle	c
with	c
ill-fitted	i
clothes	c
taking	i
off	c
and	c
putting	c
on	c
.	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
although	c
there	c
is	c
certainly	c
a	c
good	c
side	c
of	i
shopping	c
,	c
such	c
as	c
pleasures	i
of	c
getting	c
new	c
stuff	c
and	c
spending	c
money	c
on	c
something	c
you	c
really	c
wanted	c
for	c
long	i
time	c
,	c
you	c
also	c
have	c
some	c
unpleasant	c
moments	c
to	c
get	c
through	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
very	c
please	i
to	c
recived	i
these	i
prize	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c

The	c
only	c
time	c
I	c
can	c
travel	c
to	c
U.S.A	i
is	c
in	c
July	c
,	c
because	c
that	c
is	c
the	c
only	c
time	c
I	c
can	c
leave	c
my	c
work	c

About	c

I	c

so	c
staying	i

The	c
two	c
activities	c
that	c
I	c

an	i

and	c
amazing	c
results	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
Science	c
is	c
very	c
useful	c
in	c
life	c

We	c
can	c

a	c
lot	c
of	c
interest	i
faces	c
on	i
the	c
students	c
wile	i
we	c

Also	c
it	c
not	i
a	c
very	c
easy	c
subject	c
so	c
we	c
can	c
capture	c
other	c
students	i
faces	c
in	c
confuse	i
and	c
puzzal	i
.	c

Also	c
drama	c
is	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
most	c
fun	c
and	c
interest	i
subject	i
.	c

We	c
can	c

students	c
expressing	c
their	c
feeling	i

wonderful	c
and	c
excitting	i
story	c
that	c
the	c

Another	c
excitting	i
subject	c
which	c
most	c
of	c
the	c

likes	i
very	c
much	c
is	c
P.E.	c
Many	c
students	c
like	c
to	c

Plus	c
you	c

I	c
'm	c
very	c

We	c

also	c
film	c
life	c

After	c
school	c
activities	c
is	i
one	c
of	c
the	c
main	c
thing	i
in	c
school	c
.	c

We	c
can	c
capture	c
bits	c
of	c
each	c
activities	i
and	c
used	i
it	i
as	c
a	i
finish	i

for	c
our	c
film	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
!	c

I	c
went	c
in	c
for	c
your	c
competition	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
really	c
anxious	c
about	c
the	c
results	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
rather	c
live	i
in	c
a	c
tent	c
than	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
be	c
close	c
to	c
nature	c
I	i
adore	c
the	c
sound	c
of	c
the	c
wind	c
,	c
trees	c
,	c
animals	c
and	c
everything	c
which	c
is	i
surrounding	i
.	i

I	i
could	i
feel	i
the	i
environment	i
.	c

Thirdly	c
,	c
as	i
far	i
as	i
the	c
activities	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
choose	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
swimming	c
as	i
well	i
as	i
tennis	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
sports	i
a	i
lot	i
so	i
apart	c
from	c
tennis	i
I	c
am	c
a	c
member	c
in	i
our	c
local	c
swimming	c
centre	c
.	c

I	c

reasure	i
you	c
that	c
gradually	i
I	i
am	i
improving	c
my	c
sports	c
skills	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
which	i
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
do	i
I	c
have	i
to	i
bring	i
with	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
also	c
wondering	c
if	c
I	c
will	c
need	c
any	c
money	c
.	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

I	c
know	c
how	c
impatient	c
you	c
are	c
about	i
it	c
and	c
I	c
just	c
want	c
to	c
let	c
you	c
know	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
something	i
amazing	c
!	c

It	c
took	c
place	c
in	c
a	c
huge	c
stadium	c
which	c
had	c
over	c
4.000	i
seats	c
for	c
the	c
"	c
spactetors	i
"	c
if	c
you	c
can	c
call	c
them	c
like	i
this	i
.	c

Can	c
you	c
imagine	c
?	c

Another	c
thing	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
was	c
help	c
the	c
staff	c
to	c
tranfer	i
some	c
equipment	c
.	c

We	c
had	c
to	c
be	c
very	c
careful	c
.	c

Have	c
you	c
any	c
idea	c
how	c
much	c
does	i
this	c
stuff	c
worth	i
?	c

You	c
do	c
n't	c
even	c
want	c
to	c
know	c
.	c

Apart	c
from	c
these	i
we	i
were	c
mainly	c
helping	c
the	c
singers	c
to	c
be	i
prepared	i
for	c
the	c
concert	c
.	c

They	c
had	c
to	c
chose	i
their	c
clothes	c
,	c
give	i
one	c
last	c
performance	i
before	c
the	c
big	c
night	c
and	c
everything	c
had	c
to	c
be	c
perfect	c
!	c

Even	c
if	c
I	c
could	c
use	c
100	c
sheets	c
it	c
would	c
n't	c
be	c
enough	c
to	c
describe	c
my	c
experience	c
and	c
the	c
things	c
that	c
I	i
've	i
gained	i
through	i
it	c
!	c

I	c
've	c
learned	c
the	c
meaning	c
of	c
the	c
words	c
"	c
reliability	c
"	c
and	c
"	c
responsibility	c
"	c
.	c

Looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c

I	c
have	i
visited	i
your	c
theater	i
and	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
dissapointed	i
because	i
of	i
the	i
number	c
of	c
reasons	c
.	c

I	c
've	c
read	c
your	c
advertisment	i
and	c
in	i
reality	c
to	i
what	i
was	i
written	i
there	i
was	i
different	i
.	c

There	c
was	c
no	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
but	c
instead	c
of	c
him	c
was	i
a	c
different	c
actor	c
and	c
I	c
'm	c
very	c
dissapointed	i
about	c
it	i
because	c
I	c
'm	c
his	i
fan	i
.	c

The	c
theater	i
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
for	c
no	c
reason	c
availble	i
to	c
me	c
.	c

Because	c
it	c
was	c
just	c
a	c
waste	c
of	c
money	c
to	i
go	i
to	c
your	c
show	c
.	c

Yours	c
Faithfully	c

Vaisili	c
Solatov	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

Everything	c
was	c
going	c
perfectly	c
befor	i
last	c
month	c
when	c
I	c
met	c
a	c
girl	c
from	c
the	c
other	c
school	c
.	c

Her	c
name	c
was	c
Marine	c
.	c

I	c
saw	c
her	c
as	c
a	c
perfect	c
girl	c
with	c
who	i
I	c
fallen	i
in	c
love	c
with	i
.	c

So	c
I	c
woke	c
up	c
at	c
2	c
o'clock	c
in	c
the	c
morning	c
and	c
climed	i
out	c
of	c
the	c
window	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
for	c
me	c
Pat	c
at	c
the	c
time	c
went	i
to	c
toilet	i
and	c
saw	c
me	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
asked	c
him	c
to	c
keep	c
it	c
in	i
secret	c
.	c

I	c
came	c
back	c
at	c
6	c
o'clock	c
in	c
the	c
morning	c
and	c
went	c
to	c
sleep	c
again	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
organising	c
this	c
good	i
programme	c
,	c
especially	c
the	c
Leisure	c
show	c
,	c
which	c
very	i
interest	i
us	i
.	c

But	c
there	c
is	c
a	c
problem	c
which	c
I	c
hope	c
you	c
can	c
solve	c
.	c

From	i
these	i
we	c
can	c
see	c
the	c
latest	c
fashion	i
,	c
imagintive	i
make	i
up	i
and	c
hairstyles	c
.	c

What	c
is	c
more	c
they	c
are	c
the	i
Leisure	i
and	i
sports	i
wear	i
,	c
which	c
we	c
are	c
keen	c
on	c
seeing	c
it	i
.	c

In	c
your	c
advertisement	c
,	c
you	c
had	i
written	c
"	c
The	c
show	c
will	c
be	c
help	i
in	c
Central	i

from	c
10	c
am	c

7	c
pm	c
on	c
14th	c
March	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
sure	c
we	c
will	c
enjoy	c
ourselves	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
we	c
had	i
better	i
go	i
to	c
show	i
instead	c
of	c
science	i
museum	c
and	c
shopping	i
,	i
also	i
we	c
can	c
go	c
to	c
Science	i
Museum	c
on	c
15th	c
March	c
,	c
which	i
instead	c
of	c
the	i
free	c
time	c
in	c
the	c
afternoon	c
.	c

Because	c
.....	c

Last	c
night	c
,	c
when	c
I	c
went	c
into	c
my	c
house	c
it	c
was	c
quite	c
scilence	i
.	c

I	c
felt	c
there	c
might	c
be	c
something	c
has	i
gone	c
wrong	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
hear	i
this	c
bad	c
news	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
depressed	c
because	c
father	c
worked	c
quite	c
hard	c
for	c
his	c
company	c
.	c

My	c
father	c
always	c
remembered	c
his	c
responsibily	i
was	c
giving	i
good	i
salary	i
to	i
his	i
worker	i
,	c
which	c
is	c
the	c
view	i
of	c
his	c
life	c
.	c

One	c
day	c
,	c
I	c
suddenly	c
got	i
a	c
good	c
idea	c
.	c

'	c
Why	c
not	c
go	c
to	c
sock	i
exchange	c
?	c
'	c

I	c
said	c
to	c
myself	c
.	c

Almost	c
every	c
day	c
I	c
stayed	i
in	i
there	c
and	c
research	i
the	c
exchange	c
decline-line	c
,	c
which	c
give	i
me	c
lots	c
of	c
information	c
from	i
there	i
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
decide	i
to	c
join	c
the	i
dangerous	c
game	c
,	c
which	c
will	i
lost	i
everything	c
or	c
suddenly	c
become	i
millionaire	i
.	c

With	c
luck	c
,	c
I	c
was	i
won	i
by	i
chance	i
.	c

When	c
I	c
with	i
mixed	c
mood	i
went	i
home	c
I	c
found	c
my	c
parents	c
were	c
stooding	i
at	c
the	c
door	c
looked	i
like	i
very	c
cheerful	c
.	c

I	c
said	c
to	c
myself	c
again	i
.	c

Dear	c
Mr.	c
Robertson	c
.	i

Especially	i
,	i
we	i
are	i
interested	c
in	c
the	c
sightseeing	c
by	c
bus	c
on	c
Monday	c
morning	c
and	c
the	c
river	c
trip	c
to	c
Greenwich	c
at	i
the	c
afternoon	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
a	c
good	c
idea	c
to	c
include	c
the	c
visiting	i
of	i
the	c
Science	c
Museum	c
and	c
the	c
National	c
Art	c
Gallery	c
at	i
morning	i
time	i
on	c
Tuesday	c
and	c
Wednesday	c
respectivelly	i
.	c

It	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
because	i
of	i
the	c
following	c
reasons	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
there	c
will	c
be	c
leisur	i
and	c
sports	c
wear	c
and	c
the	c
latest	c
fasions	i
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
there	c
will	c
be	c
exibitions	i
about	c
makeup	c
and	c
hair	i
styles	i
.	c

And	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
we	c
will	c
enjoy	c
the	c
London	c
fasion	i
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
till	c
19.00	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
recieving	i
your	c
positive	c
reply	c
.	c

For	c
the	i
further	c
details	c
you	c
can	c
contact	c
me	c
my	i
phone	c
number	i
.	c

Famous	c
people	c
.	c

What	c
does	c
it	c
means	c
?	c

From	i
my	i
point	i
of	i
view	i
,	c
these	c
are	c
the	c
people	c
,	i
who	c
stay	c
all	i
time	i
in	i
our	i
sigh	i
.	c

We	c
intrsted	i
in	c
politicians	i
's	i
and	c
film	c
stars	i
's	i
wear	i
,	c
hobbys	i
,	c
passions	c
and	c
the	i
intrigues	c
.	c

We	c
can	c
go	c
for	c
a	c
wolk	i
,	c
go	c
shopping	c
go	i
to	c
the	c
cinema	c
,	c
marrige	i
or	c
devorce	i
.	c

Why	c
everybody	i
must	i
know	c
and	c
tolk	i
about	c
their	c
private	c
life	c
?	c

The	c
most	c
important	c
thing	c
that	i
the	i
famous	c
people	c
are	c
also	c
normal	c
people	c
as	i
us	c
.	c

They	c
live	c
as	i
us	c
,	c
they	c
brief	i
and	c
eat	c
as	i
us	c
,	c
they	c
even	c
following	i
in	c
love	c
as	i
us	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
,	i
they	c
must	i
have	c
a	c
normal	c
,	i
private	c
life	c
without	c
journalists	c
following	c
them	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
and	c
without	c
any	c
exact	i
details	c
about	c
them	c
in	i
the	c
different	c
newspaper	i
's	i
curiouses	i
.	c

First	c
,	c
I	c
expected	c
to	c
see	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
but	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
appeared	c
without	c
any	c
explanation	c
.	i

What	c
is	c
worse	c
,	c
the	c
ticket	c
price	c
was	c
not	c
reduced	c
despite	c
the	c
fact	c
that	c
I	c
showed	c
my	c
student	c
ID	c
.	c

Visiting	c
your	c
theatre	c
should	c
have	c
been	c
the	c
most	c
pleasant	c
time	i
during	c
my	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
known	c
that	c
but	c
I	c
told	i
my	i
secret	i
to	i
her	i
,	c
which	c
was	c
a	c
big	c
mistake	c
.	c

Somehow	c
I	c
felt	c
like	c
sharing	c
my	c
secret	c
with	c
her	c
and	c
told	c
her	c
that	c
the	c
new	c
pop	c
singer	c
who	c
was	c
very	c
popular	c
among	c
girls	c
was	c
my	c
cousin	c
.	c

I	c
did	c
n't	c
mind	c
telling	c
her	c
about	c
my	c
cousin	c
,	i
actually	i
he	c
is	c
n't	c
different	c
from	c
other	c
boys	c
at	c
all	c
,	i
he	i
just	i
has	i
sweet-looking	c
.	c

They	c
all	c
seemed	c
to	c
want	c
to	c
be	c
my	c
best	c
friend	c
,	c
and	c
only	c
Pat	c
seemed	c
to	c
be	c
happy	c
to	c
be	c
my	c
best	c
friend	c
.	c

Now	c
I	c
'm	c
asking	c
my	c
cousin	c
either	c
to	c
meet	c
my	c
friends	c
,	c
or	c
to	c
quit	c
being	c
a	c
singer	c
right	c
now	c
.	c

In	c
your	c
advertisement	c
I	c
read	c
the	c
times	c
,	i
it	i
was	i
14.30	c
and	c
10.30	c
,	c
however	c
it	i
started	c
20.15	i
!	c

So	c
I	i
've	i
been	i
doing	c
the	i
nothing	c
for	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
and	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
like	c
to	c
lose	i
my	c
time	c
,	c
and	c
what	c
about	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
?	c
,	i
where	i
were	c
they	c
the	i
last	c
weekend	c
?	c
the	i
last	i
weekend	c
in	i
the	c
theatre	c
was	i
a	c
different	c
actor	c
who	c
was	c
disappointing	c
.	c

To	c
make	c
the	c
evening	c
worse	c
the	i
tickets	i
were	i
not	i
discounts	i
available	i
,	c
and	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
so	c
late	c
when	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
over	c
.	c

I	c
want	c
the	i
money	c
back	c
,	i
if	i
you	c
do	c
n't	c
give	c
it	c
to	i
me	i
back	i
,	c
I	c
will	i
intend	c
to	c
write	c
to	c
the	c
press	c
and	c
explain	i
everything	c
,	c
and	c
of	c
course	c
I	c
wo	c
n't	c
be	c
the	c
only	c
one	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
and	c
he	c
usually	c
makes	i
up	c
some	c
extra	c
information	c
.	c

The	c
only	c
problem	c
was	c
that	c
the	c
girl	c
was	c
to	i
shy	c
to	c
speak	c
to	c
him	c
,	c
she	c
wanted	c
to	c
keep	c
her	c
name	c
in	i
secret	c
,	c
and	c
if	c
Pat	c
tells	i
someone	c
something	c
about	c
the	c
letter	c
,	c
she	c
wo	i
n't	i
say	c
who	c
is	i
.	c

Poor	c
Pat	c
,	c
he	c
was	c
so	c
happy	c
because	c
a	c
girl	c
loves	i
him	c
and	c
so	c
nervous	c
at	c
the	c
same	c
time	c
,	c
even	c
eating	i
his	c
nails	c
.	c

Three	c
days	c
after	i
we	c
sent	c
him	c
another	c
letter	c
,	c
and	c
Pat	c
told	c
us	c
again	c
but	c
we	c
said	c
,	c
"	c
oh	i
Pat	c
do	i
n't	c
tell	c
that	i
lie	c
again	c
"	c
,	c
so	c
Pat	c
got	c
furious	c
and	c
showed	c
us	c
the	c
letter	c
.	c

We	c
laughed	c
and	c
explained	c
him	i
that	c
we	c
were	c
who	i
wrote	c
that	i
letters	c
,	c
and	c
made	c
him	c
promises	i
that	c
when	c
he	c
gets	c
a	c
secret	c
lover	c
,	c
a	c
real	c
one	c
,	c
do	i
n't	i
tell	c
anyone	c
because	c
he	i
wo	c
n't	c
meet	c
her	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
explain	c
some	c
aspects	c
about	i
your	c
show	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
desaster	i
and	c
I	c
am	c
telling	i
you	c
why	c
.	c

I	c
went	c
to	c
see	c
my	c
favourite	c
actor	c
,	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
bad	c
surprise	c
;	c
he	c
was	c
not	c
in	c
the	c
show	c
!	c

The	c
show	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
start	c
at	c
half	c
past	c
seven	c
and	c
started	c
a	i
quarter	c
past	c
eight	c
.	c

Forty-five	c
minutes	c
later	i
!	c

It	c
was	c
incredible	c
.	c

Apart	c
from	c
that	c
,	c
the	c
advertisement	c
mention	i
that	c
there	c
were	c
discounts	c
available	c
,	c
and	c
there	c
were	c
not	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
disappointed	c
,	c
and	c
if	c
it	c
is	c
possible	c
,	c
I	c
want	c
you	c
to	c
return	c
my	c
money	c
back	i
.	c

I	c
hope	c
that	c
the	c
next	c
time	c
you	c
will	c
do	i
a	c
better	c
show	c
than	c
the	c
last	c
one	c
.	c

For	i
me	i
technology	i
affects	c
me	c
a	c
lot	c
may	i
be	i
more	c
than	c
science	c
,	c
because	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
is	c
plenty	i
of	c
objects	c
with	i
technology	c
,	c
such	c
us	c
television	c
,	c
radio	c
,	c
transports	i
,	c
etc	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
there	c
are	c
disadvatatges	i
,	c
too	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
the	c
enviroment	i
is	c
polluted	c
because	c
of	c
technology	c
,	c
although	c
is	i
our	c
fault	c
.	c

Secondly	c
for	c
us	c
is	i
a	i
disadvantatge	i
because	c
the	i
pollution	c
affects	c
us	c
indirectly	c
,	c
and	c
because	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
do	c
anything	c
but	c
watching	i
television	c
,	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
all	c
.	c

And	c
finally	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
spend	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
money	c
buying	c
games	c
for	c
the	c
computer	c
,	c
that	i
it	i
's	i
a	i
very	i
good	i
technology	i
,	c
too	c
.	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
technology	c
it	i
's	i
the	c
best	c
thing	c
around	i
the	c
world	c
,	c
apart	c
from	c
T.V	c

I	c
am	c

about	c

Last	c
Sunday	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
understand	c
why	c
you	c
changed	c
them	c

I	c
hoped	c
to	c
see	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
as	c
was	c
presented	i
in	c
an	c

You	c

late	c
at	c
20.15	c
p.m	c
withour	i
any	c

Why	c

Any	i

I	c

I	c
would	c

to	c

needed	c
someone	c

I	c

she	c
promised	c
me	c

what	i

Everybody	c
likes	c
from	i
a	c
child	c
to	c
an	c
old	c
lady	c
in	c
sixties	i
but	i
it	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

When	c
you	c
get	c
home	c
tired	c
after	c
spending	c
all	c
your	c
morning	c
and	c
afternoon	c
at	i
shopping	c
you	i
'll	i
want	i
to	c
go	c
to	c
bed	c
because	c
you	c
were	i
looking	i
for	i
only	i
a	i
suit	i
during	i
all	i
day	i
and	c
you	c
could	c
n't	c
find	c
the	c
perfect	c
one	c
.	c

We	c
have	c
few	i
possibilities	c

We	c
can	c
look	c
up	i
a	c
magazine	c
or	c
a	c
booklet	i
which	c
deliver	i
with	c
newspaper	i
weekly	c

We	c
can	c
order	c
a	c
free	c
book	i
from	c
big	c
shops	c
or	c
companies	c
monthly	c
.	c

We	c
can	c
also	c
watch	c
some	c
special	c
channels	c
on	c
the	c
television	c
.	c

You	c
wo	c
n't	c
wait	c
in	c
the	c
quee	i

You	c
can	c
order	c
everything	c
on	c
the	c

I	c
think	c
you	c
wo	c
n't	c
be	c
tired	c

the	c
two	c

I	c
do	c
not	c
agree	c
that	c
it	c
is	c
preferable	c
to	c

the	c
shop	c
and	c
give	c
them	c
a	c
list	c
of	c

you	c

Dear	c
Misses	i
RYAN	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
inquire	c
whether	c
there	i
is	c
possible	c
to	c
have	c
more	c
details	c
about	c
travel	c
and	c
to	c
give	c
my	c
preferences	c
about	i
travel	c
.	c

Indeed	c
I	c
would	c
rather	c
to	i
travel	i
only	c
on	i
July	c
since	c
I	c
'm	c
going	c
to	c
work	c
in	c
august	i
in	c
order	c
to	c
earn	c
money	c
to	c
pay	c
my	i
studies	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

Moreover	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
being	i
accommodate	i
in	c
log	i
cabins	i
because	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
put	c
up	c
with	c
mosquitos	c
and	c
other	c
insects	c
which	c
risk	i
coming	i
into	c
tents	c
.	c

Besides	i
I	c
've	c
chosen	c
two	c
activities	c
from	c
the	c
list	c
:	c
Tennis	i
as	i
I	c
practice	i
this	c
sport	c
regularly	c
and	c
I	c
'm	c
very	c
good	c
in	i
this	c
activity	c
and	i
Golf	i
because	c
I	c
ignore	i
all	i
about	c
this	c
sport	c
and	c
I	c
wish	c
I	i
will	i
discover	i
it	c
thanks	i
to	i
you	i
.	c

As	c
you	c
have	i
already	i
know	i
,	c
your	c
English	c
class	c
is	c
going	c
to	c
make	c
a	c
short	c
video	c
about	c
daily	c
life	c
at	c
your	c
school	c
,	i
that	i
's	i
why	c
I	c
'm	c
writing	c
a	c
report	c
suggesting	c
which	c
,	i
lessons	c
and	c
other	c
activities	c
,	i
should	c
be	c
filmed	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
he	i
seems	c
obvious	c
that	c
we	c
should	c
,	c
at	c
least	c
once	c
,	c
film	c
a	c
lesson	c
with	c
our	c
English	c
teacher	c
who	c
have	i
had	i
the	c
idea	c
to	c
make	c
this	c
short	c
video	c
.	c

At	c
the	c
end	c
,	c
to	i
my	i
opinion	i
,	c
It	i
would	c
be	c
interesting	c
to	c
film	c
a	c
course	i
of	i
sport	i
in	c
order	c
that	c
our	c
parents	c
realise	c
that	c
we	c
improve	c
our	c
body	i
's	i
abilities	c
,	c
and	c
not	c
only	c
our	c
brain	i
's	i
abilities	c
at	c
school	c

I	c

you	i
can	i
say	c
I	c
only	c

Do	c

but	c
do	c
you	c

If	i

one	i
is	i
female	i

they	i
should	i

at	i
that	i

should	i
be	i
had	i
one	i
is	i
boring	i

have	i
some	i
bad	i
chat	i
,	c
so	c
at	i
the	i
last	i
you	c
both	c
two	i
will	c
feel	c
unhappy	c
or	c
angry	c
to	i
each	c

In	c
this	c

situation	c
I	c

Over	c

,	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
disappointed	c
with	c
the	c
organisation	c
of	c
your	c
theatre	c
.	c

Then	c
,	c
the	c
time	c
marked	i
to	i
the	c
beginning	c
was	i
19:30	c
and	c
unfortunatly	i
he	i

at	c
20:15	c

Closing	i
this	i
facts	i
,	c
when	c
the	c
musical	c
finished	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
,	i
in	i
the	i
fact	i
of	i
the	i
wainting	i
for	c
the	c
start	c
of	c
the	c
musical	c
and	c
dissapointed	i
with	c
this	c
version	c
of	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
,	i
every	i
body	i
went	c
to	c
the	c
restaurant	c
wich	i
is	i
closed	c
without	c
any	c
explanation	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c

He	c
has	c
a	c
bestfriend	i
,	c
that	i
was	c
more	c
like	c
a	c

for	i
him	c

Before	i

when	c
Pat	c

that	c

was	c
gay	c
,	i
after	i
this	i
their	c
relationship	c

Pat	c
was	c
very	c
frightened	c
with	i
this	c
situation	c

Pat	c
and	c
Ted	c

had	i
always	i
competition	c

and	c
Ted	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
pleased	c
with	c
the	c
prize	c
that	c
I	c

and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
more	c

because	c
I	c
would	c

go	c
to	c
California	c
,	i
I	c
have	c
always	c
wanted	c
to	c
go	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
'm	c
very	c
ill	c
at	c
the	c
moment	c
and	c
I	c
need	c
about	c
a	c
week	c
to	c
get	c
better	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
within	c
the	c
next	c
few	c
weeks	c
if	c
is	i
possible	c
(	c
July	c
2000	c
)	c
.	c

In	c
accodance	i
with	c
what	c
you	c
have	c
told	c
me	c
about	c
the	c
accommodation	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
go	c
and	c
stay	c
in	c
tents	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
think	c
their	i
unusual	c
and	c
is	i
not	c
something	c
that	c
you	c
do	c
everyday	i
.	c

You	c
have	c
also	c
asked	c
me	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
two	c
activities	c
(	c
sports	c
)	c
which	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
do	c
while	c
I	c
am	c
at	c
the	c
camp	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
also	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
about	c
the	c
weather	c
to	c
see	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
shall	i
I	i
take	c
with	c
me	c
.	c

Is	c
the	c
food	c
paid	c
for	c
?	c

May	c
I	c
ask	c
you	c
to	c
bring	i
me	c
some	c
more	c
information	c
about	c
the	c
question	i
that	c
I	c
have	c
asked	c

Yours	c
SINCERELY	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
,	i
and	c
the	c
others	c
in	c
the	c
class	c
my	c
opinion	c
(	c
for	i
the	c
video	c
that	c
you	c
are	c
going	c
to	c
do	i
)	c
about	c
which	c
lessons	c
and	c
other	c
activities	c
should	c
be	c
filmed	c
and	c
why	c
.	c

Well	c
,	c
in	i
my	i
point	i
of	i
view	i
the	c
most	c
interesting	c
lessons	c
that	c
we	c
do	i
at	c
school	c
but	i
in	i
real	i
life	i
are	i
useful	i
,	i
are	c
maths	c
because	c
everything	c
we	c
do	c
is	c
all	c
about	c
maths	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
geography	c
is	c
important	c
as	c
well	c
because	c
we	c
must	i
all	c
know	c
WHERE	c
we	c
live	c
,	c
what	c
are	i
the	i
problems	i
that	c
we	c
have	c
in	c
this	c
world	c
,	c
what	c
problem	c
does	i
every	c
different	c
country	c
have	i
and	c
where	c
does	i
the	c
petroleum	c
come	i
from	c
and	c
what	c
are	i
the	i
advantages	i
and	i
disadvantages	i
for	i
it	i
and	c
the	i
gold	c
as	c
well	c
,	i
there	i
are	c
loads	c
of	c
thinks	i
about	c
geography	c
that	c
we	c
MUST	i
KNOW	i
.	c

In	c
accordance	c
with	c
all	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
written	c
to	c
you	c
above	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
there	c
is	c
something	c
else	c
you	c
must	c
put	c
in	c
the	c
video	i
film	i
.	c

My	c
advise	i
for	c
you	c
is	c
:	c
"	c
Do	c
not	c
put	c
to	i
much	i
subjects	c
,	i
just	i
put	c
a	i
few	c
subject	c
and	c
make	c
them	c
look	c
interesting	c

Dear	c
manager	c
,	c

There	c
are	i
some	c
problems	c
,	i
we	c
have	c
to	c
speak	c
about	c
.	c

At	i
first	i
,	c
the	c
actor	c
was	c
not	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
there	i
was	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
,	c
who	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
.	c

After	c
the	c
musical	i
show	c
I	c
want	i
to	c
spend	c
some	c
time	c
in	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
open	c
,	c
because	c
all	c
of	c
your	c
cooks	c
and	c
waiters	c
are	c
in	i
holidays	i
.	c

And	c
this	c
not	i
perfect	i
evening	c
in	i
your	c
theatre	c
was	c
very	c
expensive	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

I	i
've	i
payed	i
Â£	c
160	c
for	c
eight	c
people	c
and	c
there	c
was	i
no	c
discounts	c
available	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
oppinion	i
you	c
have	c
to	c
give	c
some	c
money	c
back	c
to	c
me	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
give	i
no	i
money	c
back	c
,	c
I	c
will	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
newspaper	c
.	c

At	i
first	i
I	c
would	i
say	c
that	c
our	c
technology	i
level	i
,	i
in	i
this	i
time	i
are	i
very	c
high	c
but	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
it	c
would	i
be	c
higher	c
.	c

With	c
the	c
help	c
of	c
some	c
modern	c
technology	c
our	c
daily	c
life	i
would	c
not	c
so	i
difficult	c
.	c

With	c
the	c
help	c
of	c
my	c
home	c
computer	c
I	c
can	c
do	c
all	c
thing	i
,	c
about	i
money	c
,	c
with	c
my	c
bank	c
.	c

The	c
new	c
way	c
is	c
very	c
easy	c
and	c
faster	c
and	c
I	c
can	c
spent	i
my	c
time	c
with	i
other	c
things	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Ryan	c

I	c
am	c
very	c

be	c
grateful	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
give	c
me	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
been	c
climbing	c
for	c
more	c
than	c
7	c
years	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
played	c
tennis	c
in	c
my	c
life	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
watch	c
every	c
tournament	c
on	c
television	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
if	c
I	c
need	c
special	i
clothes	c
,	c
extra	c
money	c
or	c
any	c
other	c
things	c
.	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

There	c
are	c
two	c
kinds	c
of	c
shopping	c
;	c
the	c
first	c
one	c
is	c
shopping	c
for	c
fun	c
.	c

You	c
often	c
see	c
young	c
ladies	c
looking	c
for	c
the	c
nicest	c
dress	c
,	c
the	c
most	c
beautiful	c
shoes	c
and	c
so	c
on	c
...	c

They	c
are	c
all	c
excited	c
when	c
thinking	c
about	c
the	c
party	c
they	c
have	c
been	c
invited	c
to	c
.	c

This	i
is	c
very	c
nice	c
when	c
you	c
can	c
do	c
your	c
shopping	c
like	c
that	c
.	c

The	c
second	c
kind	c
of	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

You	c
have	c
to	c
find	c
the	c
best	c
article	c
for	c
the	c
best	c
price	c
.	c

Besides	c
,	c
when	c
you	c
want	c
to	c
pay	c
for	c
the	c
things	c
you	c
have	c
taken	i
,	c
you	c
can	c
believe	c
that	c
the	c
ladies	c
behind	c
the	c
cashdesks	i
are	c
unable	c
to	c
smile	c
.	c

Shopping	c
is	c
annoying	c
but	c
also	c
necessary	c
,	i
it	i
is	c
why	c
it	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
disappointed	c
.	c

Lot	i
of	c
things	c
that	c
you	c
have	i
written	i
at	i
the	c
advertisement	c
are	c
not	c
true	c
.	c

You	c
writer	i
that	c
the	c
actor	c
was	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
but	c
he	c
was	c
n't	c
there	c
.	c

About	c
the	c
discount	c
that	c
we	c
are	i
going	c
to	c
have	c
.	c

Why	c
it	i
does	i
not	i
make	i
to	i
us	i
?	c

as	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

Everyone	i
after	i
the	i
show	i
run	i
to	c
take	i
a	c
good	c
seat	c
at	i
the	c
restaurant	c
but	c
everyone	c
disappointed	i
when	c
they	c
see	i
the	c
sight	i
which	c
said	c
"	c
Close	i
for	c
today	c
"	c
.	c

That	c
evening	c
was	c
n't	c
my	i
perfect	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
I	c
want	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
because	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
a	c
disaster	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
really	c
sorry	c
I	i
am	i
saying	i
this	c
but	c
is	i
the	c
true	i
.	c

I	c
am	i
hoping	i
that	c
you	c
will	c
not	c
make	c
such	c
mistakes	c
again	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	i

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

Pat	c
is	c
a	c
friend	c
of	c
mine	c
and	c
we	c
are	i
friends	c
for	c
almost	c
a	c
year	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
never	c
told	c
her	c
a	c
secret	c
before	c
but	c
this	c
time	c
,	i
I	c
was	c
going	c
to	c
tell	c
her	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
sure	c
that	c
was	i
Pat	c
who	c
told	c
it	i
to	i
everyone	c
.	c

After	c
that	c
I	c
had	c
an	c
argument	c
with	c
Pat	c
and	c
then	c
she	c
told	c
me	c
that	c
she	c
said	i
it	i
only	c
to	i
one	c
person	c
.	c

But	c
now	c
we	c
are	c
friends	c
again	c
but	c
I	c
will	c
never	c
say	i
to	i
her	c
a	c
secret	c
in	i
my	c
whole	c
life	c

Dear	c
Helen	c

I	c
would	c

'm	c
free	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
really	c
like	c
living	i
in	c
tents	c

If	c
it	c
's	c
possible	c
to	c
live	i
in	c
log	c
cabins	c
I	c
'll	c
be	c
pleased	c
.	c

While	c
I	c
'm	c
at	c
the	c
Camp	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
do	c
two	c
favorite	i
activities	c
which	i
are	c
basketball	c
and	c
singing	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
not	c
good	c
at	c
it	c
but	c
I	c
try	c
my	c
best	c
.	c

Also	c
I	c
like	c
singing	c

There	c
is	c
something	c
else	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
.	c

At	c
the	c
Camp	c
,	c
is	c
there	c
a	c
free	c
uniform	c
or	c
we	i
will	i
have	c
to	c
wear	c
something	c
spessial	i
?	c

Also	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
about	c
money	c
.	c

How	c
much	c
money	c
should	c
I	c
take	c
with	c
me	c
?	c

And	c
is	c
it	c
nesessary	i
to	c
bring	c
money	c

I	c

film	i
our	c
English	c

and	c
Math	i
lessons	c

From	c
activities	i
I	c
suggest	c
to	i
film	i
sport	i
lessons	c
.	i

We	c
always	c
learn	c
something	c
new	c
.	c

At	c
some	c
lessons	c
students	c
are	c
always	c
work	i
,	c
but	c
us	i
we	c
work	c
,	c
joke	i
,	c
discuss	c
many	c
topics	c
,	c
tell	c
some	c
stories	c
about	c
our	c
life	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
not	c
true	c
.	c

Also	c
Math	i
.	i

I	c
think	c
it	i
's	i
all	c
depends	c
of	i
teacher	i
.	c

teacher	c
knows	c
how	c
to	c
teach	c
so	c
we	c
do	c
n't	c
get	c
tired	c
of	c
his	c
lessons	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
we	c
should	c
film	c
the	c
Math	i
.	i

lessons	c
,	c
so	c
students	c
and	c
some	c
teachers	c
will	c
change	c
their	c
opinion	c
about	c
Math	i
.	c

For	c
activities	c
we	i
should	c
film	c
sport	i
lessons	c
because	c
we	c
always	c
do	c
something	c

We	c
do	i
many	c

with	c
other	c

and	c
we	c
always	c
have	c

Our	c

We	c
try	c
to	c

many	c
instruments	c

sing	i
even	c
if	c
we	c
do	c
n't	c

And	c
it	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
began	c
three	c
quarters	c
of	c
an	c
hour	c
late	c
:	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
quarter	c
past	c
eight	c
instead	c
of	c
half	c
past	c
seven	c
,	c
what	i
of	c
course	c
was	c
very	c
bothering	i
.	c

I	c
went	c
to	c
your	c
show	c
to	c
see	c
Mr.	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
who	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
play	c
the	c
main	c
character	c
,	c
but	c
he	c
did	c
n't	c
appeared	i
.	c

He	c
had	c
been	c
replaced	c
by	c
a	c
really	c
bad	c
actor	c
,	c
whom	i
I	c
do	c
n't	c
even	c
know	c
the	c
name	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
disappoint	i
of	i
that	c
change	c
,	c
because	c
Mr.	c
Brook	c
is	c
one	c
of	c
my	c
favourite	c
actor	i
.	c

My	c
wife	c
and	c
I	c
had	c
decided	c
to	c
eat	c
at	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
play	c
.	c

It	c
turned	c
to	i
be	c
impossible	c
:	c
the	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
and	c
we	c
did	c
n't	c
even	c
received	i
an	c
explaination	i
therefor	i
.	c

I	c
had	c
a	c
really	c
bad	c
evening	c
and	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
for	c
my	c
money	c
back	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
modern	c
technology	c
has	c
changed	c
my	c
life	c
a	c
lot	c
.	c

The	c
developpement	i
of	c
portable	c
communication	c
systems	c
,	c
such	c
as	c
mobile	c
phones	c
has	i
greatly	c
changed	c
our	c
way	c
of	c
life	c
.	c

That	c
would	c
n't	c
have	c
been	c
possible	c
a	c
century	c
ago	c
,	c
because	c
all	c
our	c
material	i
,	c
such	c
as	c
dive	i
computers	c
,	c
tanks	c
or	c
regulators	c
did	i
n't	c
existed	i
at	c
that	c
time	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
we	c
live	c
easier	c
now	c
(	c
thanks	c
to	c
modern	c
medicine	c
)	c
and	c
that	c
our	c
lives	c
will	c
get	c
easier	c
with	c
the	i
time	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Helen	i
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
received	c
your	c
letter	c
this	c
morning	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
pleased	c
to	c
hear	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
.	c

You	i
can	i
find	i
futher	i
information	i
from	i
me	i
about	i
Camp	i
California	i
in	i
the	i
USA	i
.	c

And	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
swimming	i
activities	i
at	c
the	c
camp	c
.	c

My	c
second	c
chose	i
is	c
painting	c
because	c
I	c
love	c
water	i
colour	i
painting	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
member	c
of	c
the	c
our	i
water	i
colour	i
painting	c
club	c
in	c
my	c
town	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
log	i
cabins	i
because	c
I	c
have	i
bad	c
experiens	i
about	i
tents	c
.	c

Lastly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
should	c
bring	c
with	c
me	c
and	i
could	c
you	c
give	c
me	c
clue	i
about	c
what	c
I	c
must	c
bring	c
as	i
a	i
clothes	c
and	c
what	c
I	c
do	c
not	c
need	c
it	i
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

We	c
are	c
all	c
costemers	i
of	c
the	c
big	c
supermarkets	c
They	i
have	c
all	c
what	i
we	c
need	c
it	i
.	c

They	c
are	c
a	c
bit	c
far	c
from	c
town	c
but	c
they	c
have	c
huge	c
car	i
park	i
.	c

It	c
look	i
wonderful	c
does	i
not	i
it	c
.	i

But	c
when	c
we	c
thing	i
properly	i
shopping	i
is	c
not	c
enjoyable	c
for	i
example	c
if	i
you	c
forget	c
something	c
that	c
need	i
for	c
salat	i
.	c

You	c
have	c
to	c
go	c
back	c
this	i
supermarket	c
and	c
find	c
nearest	i
parking	c
space	c
then	i
before	c
someone	c
takes	c
the	c
their	i
last	c
fresh	c
lemon	c
for	c
your	c
salat	i
you	i
must	c
find	c
where	i
was	i
the	i
lemon	i
section	i
before	i
because	c
they	c
love	c
change	i
the	c
store	c
again	i
and	c
again	c
.	c

When	c
you	c
get	c
your	c
lemon	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
queue	c
to	c
lemons	i
money	i
.	c

At	i
it	i
shows	c
shopping	i
is	i
become	c
our	i
dislikes	c
,	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
huge	c
supermarkets	c

To	c
whom	c
it	c
may	c
concern	c
,	c

I	c
have	c
recently	c
received	c
a	c
letter	c
saying	c
I	c
am	c
a	i
first-prize	c
winner	c
for	i
your	c
competition	c
.	c

I	i
was	c
wonderful	c
news	c
and	c
as	c
you	c
have	c
requested	c
,	c
here	c
is	c
some	c
further	c
information	c
and	c
details	c
.	c

At	c
Camp	c
California	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
preferably	i
like	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
as	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
more	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

The	c
two	c
activities	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
do	c
are	c
Photography	c
and	c
Sailing	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
they	c
are	c
a	c
good	c
contrast	c
.	c

As	c
well	c
as	c
a	i
good	c
exercise	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
also	c
be	i
able	c
to	c
learn	c
something	c
new	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
never	c
done	c
Photography	c
before	c
.	c

I	c
also	c
have	c
some	c
enquiries	c
concerning	c
the	c
trip	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
appreciate	c
it	c
if	c
you	c
also	c
advise	i
me	c
on	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
should	c
take	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
all	c
new	c
for	c
me	c
as	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
been	c
to	c
the	c
USA	c
before	c
.	c

Please	c
send	c
me	c
additional	c
information	c
soon	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
time	c
and	c
your	c
kind	c
effort	i

Yours	c
Sincerely	c

When	c
you	c
think	c
of	c
the	c
word	c
'	c
shopping	c
'	c
a	c
smile	c
always	c
comes	c
onto	c
your	c
face	c
.	c

Shopping	c
is	c
thought	c
of	c
as	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

Teenagers	c
go	c
shopping	c
for	c
leisure	i
and	c
to	c
socialize	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
say	c
window	c
shopping	c
is	c
the	c
reason	c
why	c
I	c
have	c
no	c
money	c
now	c
.	c

My	c
friend	c
wanted	c
to	c
meet	c
up	c
with	c
me	c
so	c
we	c
made	c
plans	c
to	c
meet	c
up	c
at	i
a	c
high	c
street	c
to	c
go	c
shopping	c
.	c

For	c
me	c
,	c
that	c
was	i
window-shopping	i
.	c

As	c
I	c
had	c
nothing	c
better	c
to	c
do	c
,	c
I	c
tried	c
it	c
on	c
.	c

I	c
knew	c
thought	i
that	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
get	c
it	c
-	c
not	c
yet	c
anyway	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
received	c
my	c
monthly	c
pay	c
,	c
I	c
rushed	c
down	c
to	c
the	c
shop	c
and	c
without	c
thinking	c
,	c
bought	c
that	c
dress	c
.	c

I	c
went	i
back	c
to	c
where	c
I	c
was	c
before	c
-	c
with	c
no	c
money	c
(	c
and	c
a	c
black	c
dress	c
)	c
all	c
over	c
again	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
this	c
letter	c
to	c
you	c
because	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
very	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
to	i
your	c
theatre	c
.	i

and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
explain	c
what	c
the	c
problems	c
were	c
.	c

But	c
at	i
big	i
suprise	i
I	i
saw	c
that	c
the	i
actor	i
was	i
different	i
and	i
I	c
was	c
very	c
disappointed	c
.	c

I	c
prefered	i
to	c
come	i
at	c
19:30	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
better	c
at	c
night	c
and	c
it	c
would	c
n't	c
finish	c
late	c
,	c
but	c
the	c
theatre	i
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
and	c
we	c
got	c
bored	c
waiting	c
to	i
start	c
.	c

At	i
last	i
I	i
was	c
waiting	i
to	c
visit	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
a	c
machine	c
was	c
broken	c
.	c

This	c
was	c
very	c
disappointing	c
.	c

The	c
next	c
morning	c
at	c
school	c
everybody	c
was	c
looking	c
at	c
me	c
with	i
a	c
strange	c
way	c
.	c

At	c
first	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
know	c
why	c
but	c
after	c
a	c
few	c
seconds	c
I	c
realised	c
that	c
telling	c
Pat	c
about	c
my	c
party	c
was	c
n't	c
a	c
good	c
idea	c
.	c

"	c
Why	c
,	c
why	c
did	c
you	c
do	c
that	c
?	c
"	c

I	c
was	c
confused	c
.	c

I	c
wondered	c
why	c
I	c
made	c
the	c
mistake	c
to	i
invite	i
Pat	c
.	c

I	c
guess	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
know	c
that	c
she	c
would	c
have	c
said	i
it	i
.	c

And	c
that	c
's	c
what	i
I	i
had	i
exactly	i
done	i
even	c
if	i
I	c
stayed	i
alone	c
at	i
my	c
birthday	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
much	c
more	c
important	c
to	c
me	c
to	c
get	c
all	c
my	c
friends	c
back	c
.	c

Dear	c
Madam	i
or	i
Sir	i

I	c
am	c
writing	c
this	c
letter	c
to	c
complain	c
how	i
terrible	c
the	c
show	c
performed	c
in	c
your	c
theatre	c
was	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
interested	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
about	i
the	c
musical	c
show	c
so	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
to	c
see	c
it	c
two	c
weeks	c
ago	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
you	c
advertised	c
that	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
who	c
is	c
the	i
my	c
favorite	i
,	c
is	c
a	i
main-actor	i
but	c
there	c
was	c
another	c
actor	c
insted	i
of	c
him	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
his	c
performance	c
was	c
really	c
poor	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
which	c
was	c
45	c
minutes	c
later	c
than	c
on	c
time	c
and	c
there	c
was	c
no	c
discount	c
for	c
the	c
ticket	c
,	c
which	c
is	c
different	c
from	c
the	c
advertisement	c
.	c

Thirdly	c
,	c
the	c
only	c
one	i
restaurant	c
in	c
your	c
theatre	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
of	c
renovating	i
it	i
.	c

As	c
a	c
result	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
totally	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
during	c
my	c
holiday	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
I	c
hope	c
that	c
you	i
should	i
have	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

It	c
is	c
certainly	c
true	c
that	c
the	i
modern	c
technology	c
has	c
been	c
changing	c
our	c
life	c
a	c
lot	c
in	i
these	c
days	c
.	c

In	i
the	c
bus	c
or	c
even	c
in	i
the	c
tube	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
talk	c
with	c
a	c
friend	c
with	i
a	c
mobile	c
phone	c
when	c
I	c
feel	c
boaring	i
.	c

Sometimes	c
I	c
even	c
do	i
some	c
games	c
with	i
it	c
.	c

Without	c
it	c
,	c
it	c
would	c
take	c
more	c
than	c
one	c
week	c
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
modern	c
technology	c
affects	c
a	i
lot	i
to	i
my	i
daily	i
life	i
as	c
well	c
as	c
the	c
whole	c
society	c
.	c

I	c
got	c
it	c
today	c
and	c
could	c
n't	c
believe	c
it	c
!	c

As	i
you	i
asked	c
me	c
for	c
some	c
further	c
information	c
.	c

For	c
accommodation	c
,	c
I	c
prefer	c
log	c
cabins	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
believe	c
I	c
can	c
meet	c
more	c
people	c
if	c
I	c
stay	c
in	c
log	c
cabins	c
and	c
it	c
's	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
fun	c
to	c
talk	c
with	c
them	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
never	c
played	c
basketball	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
have	c
played	c
tennis	c
for	c
6	c
years	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
good	c
player	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
again	c
and	c
take	i
care	i
,	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Dear	c
Kim	c

Hi	c
!	c

I	c
'm	c
fine	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
asked	c
me	c
about	c
the	c
concert	c
,	c
I	c
'll	c
write	c
about	c
it	c
today	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
we	c
cleared	c
all	c
the	c
seats	c
.	c

There	c
were	c
so	c
many	c
seats	c
that	c
it	c
took	c
long	i
to	i
finish	c
clearing	c
.	c

Before	c
the	c
concert	c
started	c
,	c
we	c
sold	c
some	c
snacks	c
and	c
drinks	c
and	c
after	c
that	c
,	c
we	c
stood	c
in	c
front	c
of	c
the	c
audience	c
to	c
prevent	c
them	c
from	c
moving	c
forward	c
.	c

During	c
the	c
concert	c
,	c
all	c
the	c
fans	c
try	c
to	c
get	c
closer	c
to	c
the	c
singers	c
,	c
jumping	c
,	c
shouting	c
and	c
so	c
on	c
and	c
some	c
of	c
them	c
faint	c
when	c
they	c
get	c
to	i
excited	c
.	c

Have	c
you	c
had	c
an	c
interesting	c
experience	c
?	c

Please	c
write	c
about	c
it	c
in	c
the	c
next	c
letter	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
to	c
hear	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

Yours	c

Dear	c
manager	c
,	c

I	c
love	c
London	c
's	c
musical	i
shows	i
and	c
I	c
read	c
the	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
show	c
called	c
"	c
over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
"	c
.	c

I	c
've	c
gone	c
to	c
many	c
musical	i
shows	i
where	c
the	c
main	c
actor	c
was	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
I	c
can	c
say	c
that	c
he	c
is	c
really	c
good	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
my	c
last	c
night	c
in	c
London	c
and	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
this	c
musical	i
show	c
.	c

I	c
showed	c
the	c
advertisement	c
to	c
him	c
and	c
he	c
said	c
it	c
was	c
wrong	c
and	c
I	c
paid	c
the	c
normal	c
price	c
.	c

I	c
bought	c
the	c
ticket	c
for	c
the	c
second	c
session	i
and	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
at	c
seven	c
o'clock	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
angry	c
about	c
all	c
of	c
this	i
problems	c
but	c
I	c
was	c
disappointed	c
when	c
I	c
realised	c
the	c
advertisement	c
was	c
wrong	c
with	i
the	c
actor	c
's	c
name	c
.	c

When	c
the	c
musical	i
show	c
finished	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
's	c
restaurant	c
and	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
too	c
late	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
have	c
dinner	c
there	c
,	c
as	c
it	i
was	c
announced	i
.	i

Waiting	c
for	c
your	c
answer	c

Modern	c
technology	c
has	c
changed	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
and	c
I	c
'll	c
try	c
to	c
explain	c
it	i
.	c

We	c
have	c
been	c
using	c
personal	c
computers	c
for	c
nine	c
years	c
and	c
it	c
's	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
changes	c
.	c

Last	c
year	c
I	c
spent	c
ten	c
hours	c
looking	c
for	c
information	c
for	c
my	c
homework	c
.	c

I	c
started	c
my	c
research	c
in	c
the	c
town	c
's	c
library	c
and	c
all	c
the	c
information	c
I	c
collected	c
was	c
from	c
a	c
local	c
newspaper	c
.	c

After	c
two	c
hours	c
I	c
thought	c
that	c
all	c
of	c
this	c
information	c
was	c
writted	i
from	c
a	c
foreign	c
point	c
of	c
view	c
and	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
the	c
native	c
opinion	c
.	c

I	c
used	c
my	c
computer	c
for	i
collecting	i
reports	c
from	c
internet	i
and	c
I	c
can	c
promise	c
I	c
found	c
so	c
much	c
information	c
that	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
analize	i
it	c
in	c
two	c
weeks	c
.	c

Do	c
you	c
want	c
to	c
organize	c
a	c
different	c
holiday	c
in	i
a	c
strange	c
place	c
?	c

You	c
can	c
find	c
there	i
all	i
you	i
need	i
and	c
more	c
!	c

I	c
ca	c
n't	c
imagine	c
my	c
parents	c
playing	c
in	c
the	c
street	c
without	i
watching	c
the	c
TV	c
.	c

And	c
what	c
about	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
see	c
at	c
your	c
theatre	c
in	c
London	c
two	c
weeks	c
ago	c
.	c

According	c
to	c
your	c
advertisement	c
,	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
was	c
involved	c
in	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
but	c
to	c
my	c
disappointment	c
there	c
was	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
.	c

Besides	i
,	c
there	c
was	c
a	c
problem	c
with	c
tickets	c
.	c

According	c
to	c
the	c
advertisement	c
,	c
discounts	c
were	c
available	c
,	c
but	c
in	c
reality	c
it	i
was	c
n't	c
so	c
!	c

The	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
you	c
promised	c
to	c
provide	c
turned	c
to	i
be	c
really	c
boring	c
and	c
disappointing	c
.	c

In	i
connection	i
with	i
this	i
I	c
think	c
you	c
should	c
give	c
me	c
some	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
will	c
note	i
this	i
and	c
I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

Pat	c
was	c
my	c
classmate	c
and	c
I	c
should	c
add	c
,	i
that	c
he	c
was	c
one	c
of	c
my	c
best	c
friends	c
.	c

I	c
loved	c
and	c
respected	c
him	c
very	c
much	c
,	c
but	c
there	c
was	c
an	c
unpleasant	c
thing	c
about	c
him	c
-	c
he	c
talked	c
too	c
much	c
.	c

My	c
sister	c
's	c
birthday	c
was	c
coming	c
.	c

We	c
bought	c
a	c
beautiful	c
puppy	c
and	c
were	c
waiting	c
for	c
the	c
holiday	i
probably	c
even	c
more	c
impatiently	c
,	i
than	c
Susie	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
sure	c
he	c
did	c
it	c
not	c
because	c
he	c
wanted	c
to	c
spoil	c
everything	c
,	c
but	c
because	c
he	c
was	c
so	c
happy	c
and	c
excited	c
,	i
that	c
he	c
could	c
n't	c
act	c
in	c
a	c
different	c
way	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
"	c
OVER	c
THE	c
RAINBOW	c
"	c
which	i
I	c
saw	c
in	c
your	c
theatre	c
the	i
5th	c
of	c
June	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
been	c
very	c
disappointed	c
by	c
the	c
quality	c
of	c
the	c
show	c
and	c
the	c
lies	c
in	c
your	c
advertisement	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
seeing	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
as	c
written	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
,	c
but	c
his	c
part	c
was	c
played	c
by	c
another	c
actor	c
,	c
without	c
information	i
or	c
excuse	i
from	i
the	c
direction	i
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
coud	i
n't	i
get	c
a	c
discount	c
with	c
my	c
student	c
card	c
and	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
45	c
minutes	c
later	i
.	c

In	c
addition	c
,	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
,	c
where	c
we	c
had	c
planned	c
to	c
eat	c
,	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
the	c
cook	c
was	c
ill	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
therefore	c
asking	c
for	c
a	c
complete	c
refund	c
of	c
my	c
ticket	c
and	c
I	c
hope	c
you	c
will	c
improve	c
the	c
quality	c
of	c
your	c
services	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

The	c
poor	c
boy	c
was	c
only	c
5	c
year	i
old	c
and	c
at	c
this	c
age	c
,	i
it	c
's	c
very	c
difficult	c
to	c
keep	c
your	c
mouth	c
shut	c
knowing	c
an	c
important	c
secret	c
.	c

So	c
when	c
he	c
heard	c
at	i
random	i
that	c
my	c
parents	c
were	c
planning	c
to	c
offer	i
me	c
a	c
trip	c
to	c
San	c
Fansisco	c
as	c
present	i
for	c
my	c
birthday	c
,	c
my	c
little	c
brother	c
ran	c
in	i
my	c
bedroom	c
wherever	i
I	c
was	c
studying	c
and	c
whispered	c
in	i
my	i
ear	i
the	i
wonderful	i
news	i
.	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
in	c
July	c
after	c
taking	c
my	c
examination	c
at	c
the	i
college	c
in	i
the	c
end	c
of	c
June	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
quite	c
good	c
at	c
swimming	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
think	c
I	c
'd	c
rather	c
do	c
other	c
activities	c
what	i
you	c
show	i
me	i
in	c
your	c
letter	c
like	i
tennis	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
been	c
playing	c
this	c
game	c
with	c
my	c
friends	c
and	c
I	c
like	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
be	c
please	i
if	c
you	c
give	i
me	c
some	c
more	c
information	c
about	c
the	c
accommodation	c
,	c
and	c
some	c
advices	i
about	c
the	c
cloth	i
(	c
shal	i
)	c
I	c
should	c
wear	c
and	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
should	c
take	c
with	c
me	c
.	c

Your	i
faithfully	c

Me	c
for	i
example	c
,	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
particularly	c
like	c
shopping	c
,	i
when	i
I	c
go	c
on	c
my	c
own	c
,	c
it	c
can	c
be	c
bored	i
.	c

My	c
sister	c
loves	c
shopping	c
,	i
she	i
could	c
stay	c
trying	i
clothes	i
on	i
all	i
day	i
in	i
a	i
shop	i
.	c

I	c
am	i
agree	c
that	c
the	i
most	c
of	i
the	i
people	c
enjoy	c
buying	c
cloths	i
,	c
food	c
,	c

As	i

the	c
chance	c
to	c
do	c
two	c
activities	c
while	c
I	c
am	c
at	c
the	c
Camp	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
practise	i

Would	c
you	c
give	c
me	c
some	c
information	c
about	c

there	c
?	c

I	c

Looking	c

There	c
is	c
somebody	c
who	c
says	c
that	c
'	c
Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
'	i
and	c
who	c
is	c
happy	c
only	c
when	c
can	i
go	c
shopping	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
if	c
you	c
can	c
walk	c
without	i
anytime	i
problem	c
with	c
a	c
good	c
friend	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
shopping	c
is	c
very	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

For	c
istance	i
,	c
it	c
is	c
funny	i
enter	i
a	c
clothes	c
shop	c
and	c
try	c
on	c
a	c
skirt	c
or	c
a	c
t-shirt	i
although	c
you	c
do	c
not	c
buy	c
anything	c
.	c

I	c
often	c
like	c
getting	i
gifts	c
for	c
my	c
relatives	c
and	c
friends	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
shopping	c
is	c
relaxing	c
above	i
all	c
on	c
Saturdays	c
when	c
you	c
have	c
finished	c
a	c
work	i
week	c
and	c
you	c
are	c
expecting	c
a	c
wonderful	c
Sunday	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
H.	c
Ryan	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
with	c
reference	c
to	c
your	c
letter	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
give	c
some	i
information	c
which	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
asked	c
.	i

Because	c
my	c
course	c
finishes	c
at	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
June	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
going	c
to	c
work	c
for	c
a	c
Hotel	i
in	c
August	c
and	c
September	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c

It	i
is	c
the	c
best	c
time	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

As	c
far	c
as	c
accommodation	c
is	c
concern	i
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
I	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
tents	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
also	c
been	c
asked	c
to	c
choose	c
some	c
activities	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
was	c
at	c

,	c
I	c
have	i
been	i
playing	i
for	c
the	c
school	c
team	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
good	c
at	c
swimming	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
could	c
you	c
let	c
me	c
know	c
what	c
sort	c
of	c
clothes	c
would	c
be	c
better	i
to	c
bring	c

I	c
look	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
have	c
just	c
received	c
your	c
letter	c
informing	c
me	c
that	c
I	c
won	c
a	c
two	c
week	c
holiday	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
to	c
indicate	i
my	i
preferences	c
for	c
the	c
travel	c
and	c
the	c
accomodation	i
.	c

I	c
have	c
no	c
particular	c
needs	c
but	c
one	c
:	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
necessary	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
my	c
work	c
will	c
keep	c
me	c
very	c
busy	c
in	c
all	c
other	i
months	c
.	c

During	c
the	c
holiday	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
playing	i
tennis	c
and	c
golf	c
.	c

I	c
can	c
play	c
tennis	c
quite	c
well	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
played	c
golf	c
,	c
so	c
,	c
if	c
it	c
is	c
possible	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
taking	i
lessons	c
with	c
a	c
teacher	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
also	c
what	c
I	c
will	c
have	c
to	c
pay	c
with	i
my	c
money	c
and	c
how	c
the	c
climate	i
is	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
decide	c
which	c
clothes	c
to	c
bring	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

People	c
often	c
have	c
very	c
different	c
opinions	c
about	c
shopping	c
.	c

Most	c
women	c
and	c
girls	c
like	c
it	c
,	c
especially	c
when	c
they	c
want	c
to	c
buy	c
clothes	c
and	c
shoes	c
.	c

A	c
man	c
usually	i
is	i
less	c
interested	c
in	c
shopping	c
,	c
maybe	c
because	c
he	c
frequently	c
has	c
to	c
pay	c
what	i
his	c
wife	c
has	c
bought	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
shopping	c
can	c
be	c
interesting	c
in	c
big	c
stores	c
,	c
where	c
you	c
can	c
find	c
everything	c
,	c
or	c
in	c
shops	c
which	c
sell	c
something	c
special	c
or	c
strange	c
.	c

In	c
this	c
case	c
,	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
long	c
queues	c
,	c
you	c
ca	c
n't	c
walk	c
without	c
being	c
pulled	c
or	c
pushed	c
,	c
and	c
you	c
often	c
have	c
to	c
spend	c
a	i
hour	c
to	i
buy	i
some	c
soap	c
or	c
a	c
packet	c
of	c
biscuits	c
.	c

Even	c
if	c
you	c
are	c
with	c
a	c
friend	c
,	c
you	c
ca	c
n't	c
talk	c
,	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
noise	c
and	c
the	c
confusion	c
,	c
and	c
you	c
may	c
find	c
it	c
difficult	c
also	c
to	c
walk	c
close	c
to	c
each	c
other	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
express	c
how	c
I	i
was	i
dissatisfied	i
with	c
OVER	c
THE	c
RAINBOW	c
which	i
was	c
presented	i
by	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
the	c
reason	c
why	c
I	c
bought	c
the	c
ticket	c
was	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
who	c
is	c
my	c
favorite	i
star	c
,	c
and	c
was	c
going	c
to	c
play	i
for	i
the	c
show	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
there	c
was	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
instead	c
of	c
him	c
,	c
and	c
this	c
was	c
most	i
my	i
disappointment	i
.	c

Although	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
start	c
at	c
19=30	i
,	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
20=15	i
,	c
so	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
wait	c
for	c
an	c
hour	c
.	c

To	c
make	c
matters	c
worse	c
,	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
late	c
starting	i
,	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
had	c
already	c
closed	c
after	i
the	c
show	c
finished	c
.	c

I	c
wonder	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
give	c
me	c
a	c
refund	c
for	i
that	i
,	c
because	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
extremely	i
different	c
which	i
I	c
was	i
expected	i
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfuly	i

Science	c
and	c
technology	c
are	c
necessary	c
for	c
our	c
life	c
.	c

It	i
is	i
getting	i
more	i
convinient	i
and	i
useful	i
than	i
our	i
past	i
life	i
.	c

Further	i
more	i
,	c
it	c
is	c
possible	c
to	c
cure	i
many	c
patients	c
who	c
have	c
serious	c
desease	i
more	c
effectively	c
,	c
if	c
we	c
use	c
modern	c
technology	c
for	i
medical	c
science	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
if	c
we	c
rely	c
on	c
modern	c
technology	c
too	c
much	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
difficult	c
to	c
be	c
independent	c
,	c
otherwise	i
we	c
will	c
tend	c
to	i
not	i
consider	c
or	c
solve	c
a	c
problem	c
by	c
ourselves	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c

Another	c
thing	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
add	c
is	c
that	c
the	c
musical	c
started	c
45	c
minutes	c
late	c
,	i
it	i
was	c
planned	i
to	c
start	c
at	c
19.30	c
and	c
it	c
really	c
did	i
it	i
at	c
20:15	c
.	c

During	c
this	c
time	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
keep	c
seating	i
in	c
the	c
theatre	c
and	c
it	c
was	c
boring	c
and	c
tiring	c
.	c

Thirdly	c
,	c
when	c
I	c
bought	c
the	c
tickets	c
,	c
I	c
asked	c
for	c
discounts	c
and	c
nobody	c
know	i
anything	c
about	c
them	c
,	c
so	c
it	c
is	c
false	c
there	i
are	c
discounts	c
available	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
very	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
and	c
I	c
hope	c
you	c
will	c
give	c
us	c
some	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Hello	c
.	c

Wearing	c
them	c
we	c
'll	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
dive	c
underwater	c
with	i
a	i
high	c
pressure	c
,	c
and	c
we	c
'll	c
have	c
freedom	c
of	c
movement	c
.	c

Technology	c
will	c
take	i
part	i
in	c
clothes	i
development	c
,	c
scientists	c
will	c
search	i
the	i
way	c
to	c
reduce	c
the	c
weight	c
of	c
clothes	c
and	c
they	c
will	c
become	c
very	c
light	c
and	c
comfortable	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
be	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
to	c
enjoy	c
the	c
clothes	c
.	c

I	c
wish	i
I	c
win	c
the	c
trip	c
!	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
recived	i
your	c
letter	c
and	c
I	c
'm	c
very	c
happy	c
because	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
expect	c
it	c
,	c
so	c
first	c
of	c
all	c
I	c
want	c
you	c
know	i
that	c
I	c
really	c
fancy	i
going	c
at	i
Camp	c
California	c
in	c
the	c
U.S.A	c
during	i
two	c
weeks	c
,	c
and	i
specially	i
because	c
I	c
've	c
never	c
been	c
in	i
this	c
country	c
.	c

On	i
one	i
hand	i
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
I	c
'm	c
working	c
in	c
a	c
school	c
and	c
the	c
lessons	c
finish	c
at	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
June	c
so	c
if	c
I	c
could	c
go	i
to	i
this	c
extraordinary	c
opportunity	c
in	c
July	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
better	c
for	c
me	c
because	c
in	c
August	c
I	c
will	c
have	c
to	c
be	c
ready	c
to	c
begin	c
preparing	c
the	c
exams	c
of	i
september	i
.	c

If	c
it	c
is	c
any	c
problem	c
let	c
me	c
know	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c
because	c
I	c
'll	c
try	c
to	c
sort	c
it	c
out	c
.	c

although	i
it	c
would	c
n't	c
be	c
a	c
problem	c
if	c
I	c
finally	i
have	i
to	c
sleep	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
.	c

Finally	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
find	c
out	c
about	i
if	c
is	i
any	i
supermarket	c
near	c
the	c
camping	i
and	c
if	c
there	c
are	c
any	c
facilities	c
in	i
washing	c
my	c
clotches	i
into	i
the	c
camp	c
.	c

We	c
arrived	c
quite	c
soon	i
because	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
organise	i
how	c
we	c
went	i
to	c
serve	c
people	c
did	i
with	i
which	i
order	i
,	i
so	c
we	c
started	c
putting	c
all	c
the	c
stuff	c
in	c
appropiate	i
place	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
nervous	c
because	c
I	c
'd	c
never	c
been	c
in	i
a	c
concert	c
before	c
and	c
an	c
hour	c
before	c
everything	c
stated	i
the	c
singer	c
and	c
the	c
musicians	c
were	c
there	c
and	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
avoid	i
it	c
and	c
I	c
started	c
crying	c
-	c
you	c
can	c
imagine	c
,	c
they	c
were	c
so	c
handsome	c
that	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
belive	i
it	c
-	c
I	c
tried	c
to	c
calm	c
down	c
because	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
work	c
,	c
and	c
later	c
I	c
began	c
feeling	i
more	c
comfortable	c
and	c
when	c
the	c
concert	c
started	c
everything	c
was	c
such	i
exciting	c
that	c
the	c
time	c
ran	i
very	c
fast	c
-	c
although	c
I	c
was	c
working	c
-	c
and	c
it	c
was	c
like	c
a	c
dream	c

I	c
JUST	c
STARTED	c
TO	c

THAT	i
IS	c
WHY	c
I	c

IT	c

A	c
POSSIBILITY	c

OVER	c

(	c
IT	c

BUT	c
SOME	c
PEOPLE	c
DO	c
N'T	c
LIKE	c
DOING	c
SHOPPING	c
AT	c
ALL	c

THEY	c
CAN	c
SAY	c
,,SHOPPING	c

BECAUSE	c
THEY	c
PREFER	c
TO	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
on	c
holiday	c
for	c
two	c
weeks	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
in	c
the	c
U.S.A.	c
I	c
can	c
go	c
only	c
on	i
July	c
because	c
I	c
'm	c
a	c
student	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
I	i
would	c
be	c
pleased	c
if	c
the	c
accommodation	c
is	i
in	c
log	i
cabin	c
because	c
I	c
'm	c
afraid	c
of	c
insects	c
and	c
it	c
's	c
wet	c
in	c
the	c
tent	c
.	c

I	c
like	c
painting	c
,	c
and	c
once	c
I	c
won	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
the	c
university	c
competition	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
I	c
'll	c
have	c
chance	i
to	c
draw	c
the	i
pictures	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
'll	c
show	c
my	i
friends	c
who	c
have	c
never	c
been	c
there	c
before	c
.	c

Another	i
activities	i
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
is	c
sailing	c
.	c

My	c
father	c
was	c
a	c
sailor	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
child	c
.	c

Fathermore	i
I	i
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
which	c
kind	c
clothes	i
I	c
need	c
to	c
take	c
and	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
'll	c
spend	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Recently	c
we	c
have	i
a	c
class	c
discussion	c
about	c
shopping	c
.	c

All	c
of	c
the	c
students	c
agree	c
with	i
that	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

But	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
incovenients	i
anoy	i
them	c
.	c

So	c
they	c
said	c
they	c
do	c
not	c
always	c
enjoy	c
shopping	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
the	c
car	i
parking	c
is	c
not	c
convinent	i
and	c
expensive	i
.	c

Futhermore	i
when	i
you	c
look	c
aroud	i
the	c
supermarket	c
,	c
you	c
ca	c
n't	c
easyly	i
find	c
the	c
goods	c
which	c
you	c
want	c
to	c
buy	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
very	c
confusing	c
without	c
right	i
singho	i
.	c

Sometimes	c
you	c
get	c
lost	c
in	c
the	c
supermarket	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
just	c
received	c
your	c
letter	c
and	c
,	c
firstly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
about	i
good	i
news	c
.	c

As	c
I	c
understand	c
is	i
very	c
imortant	i
to	c
confirm	c
the	c
date	c
of	c
travelling	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
rather	c
choose	c
July	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
only	i
one	i
month	c
when	c
I	c
have	c
got	c
holiday	c
,	i
long	c
enough	c
to	c
spend	c
it	c
by	i
travelling	c
abroad	c
.	c

Now	c
about	c
accomodation	i
.	c

If	c
it	c
is	c
possible	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
tent	i
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
the	c
best	c
way	c
to	c
understand	c
what	c
California	c
means	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
quite	c
good	c
in	i
tennis	c
,	c
especially	c
plaing	i
in	i
two	i
pairs	i
.	c

Also	c
I	c
like	c
swimming	c
and	c
I	c
've	c
got	c
two	c
year	i
experience	c
in	i
teaching	c
swimming	c
in	i
lesure	i
centre	c
.	c

Should	c
I	c
take	c
some	c
clothes	c
for	c
cold	i
weather	c
?	c

The	c
last	c
question	c
-	c
could	c
you	c
tell	i
me	c
some	c
idea	c
about	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
could	i
I	i
need	c
.	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

As	c
a	c
women	i
,	c
as	c
a	c
mother	c
and	c
,	c
finally	c
,	c
as	c
an	c
ordinary	c
person	c
,	c
I	c
am	i
doing	i
shopping	c
quite	c
often	c
.	c

Do	c
I	c
enjoy	c
it	c
?	c

If	c
I	c
told	c
you	c
"	c
yes	c
"	c
or	c
"	c
no	c
"	c
,	c
I	c
'd	c
tell	c
you	c
nothing	c
.	c

I	c
ca	c
n't	c
be	i
concentrate	c
in	c
a	c
shop	c
,	c
but	i
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
relaxe	i
as	i
well	i
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
I	c
understand	c
very	c
well	c
that	c
it	c
is	c
really	c
nesseceraly	i
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
an	c
opportunity	c
to	c
meet	c
different	c
people	c
(	c
even	c
if	c
they	c
are	c
pushing	c
you	c
)	c
,	c
to	c
understand	c
what	c
they	c
like	c
and	c
what	c
they	c
do	c
n't	c
,	c
because	c
even	c
some	c
kind	i
of	c
food	c
could	i
be	c
in	c
fashing	i
.	c

When	c
I	c
am	c
with	c
my	c
children	c
I	c
can	c
lean	i
them	c
reading	i
,	c
counting	i
,	i
if	i
they	i
only	i
do	c
n't	c
run	c
away	c
from	c
me	c
to	c
educate	c
themself	i
in	c
the	c
huge	c
world	c
,	c
which	i
name	i
is	c
"	c
shopping	c
"	c
.	c

He	c
is	c
my	c
favourite	c
actor	c
and	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
reason	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
your	c
theatre	c
.	c

But	c
finally	i
,	c
without	c
telling	c
us	c
anything	c
,	c
there	c
was	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
.	c

This	c
was	c
very	c
disappointing	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
your	c
famous	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
had	c
told	c
me	c
your	c
restaurant	c
was	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
closed	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
have	c
made	c
a	c
reservation	c
anywhere	i
else	c
,	c
but	c
you	c
did	c
n't	c
.	c

And	c
finally	c
the	c
play	c
started	c
with	c
a	c
delay	c
of	c
forty-five	c
minutes	c
and	c
there	c
were	c
not	i
discounts	c
available	c
.	c

Both	i
things	i
do	i
not	i
agree	i
with	c
what	c
I	c
read	c
on	i
your	c
advertising	i
sign	i
.	c

Due	i
to	i
all	c
of	c
these	c
reasons	c
,	c
I	c
hope	c
you	c
could	i
give	c
my	i
money	c
back	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

MANUEL	c
ALMODAR	c

This	c
was	c
a	c
very	c
difficult	c
decission	i
but	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
take	c
it	c
because	c
of	c
my	c
personal	c
situation	c
,	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
shouting	c
and	c
fighting	c
will	i
all	c
my	c
family	c
.	c

Therefore	i
my	c
girlfriend	c
lived	c
alone	c
so	i
I	c
could	c
have	c
stayed	c
with	c
her	c
or	c
just	c
have	c
gone	c
on	c
travelling	c
around	c
the	c
world	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
thinking	c
a	c
lot	c
about	c
this	c
problem	c
and	c
how	c
to	c
solve	c
it	c
so	c
I	c
needed	c
someone	c
to	c
talk	c
to	c
and	c
Pat	c
had	c
always	c
been	c
my	c
best	c
friend	c
.	c

And	c
my	c
father	c
thinks	c
a	c
year	c
travelling	c
and	c
living	c
by	c
myself	c
will	c
be	c
very	c
good	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

Dear	c
Competition	c
Organiser	c
:	c

I	c
'm	c
so	c
happy	c
and	c
exciting	i
to	c
receive	c
this	c
letter	c
about	c
I	i
've	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
.	c

I	c
've	c
been	c
dreaming	c
to	i
travel	i
to	c
U.S.A	i
for	c
so	c
many	c
years	c
.	c

The	c
dream	c
happens	i
to	c
me	c
now	c
.	c

I	c
prefer	c
living	i
in	c
tents	c
to	c
living	i
in	c
log	c
cabins	c
.	c

Basket	i
ball	i
is	c
my	c
favourite	c
sporting	i
.	c

So	c
I	c
am	c
good	c
at	c
it	c
.	c

The	c
other	c
thing	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
do	c
is	c
sailing	c
.	c

Maybe	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
manage	c
it	c
!	c

Also	c
I	c
got	i
two	c
questions	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
.	c

And	c
the	c
last	c
one	c
is	c
that	i
do	i
I	c
need	c
pillow	c
or	c
blanket	c
or	c
something	c
else	c
?	c

I	c
hope	c
that	c
I	c
will	c
enjoy	c
my	c
journey	c
!	c

Yours	c
Sincerely	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c

More	c
and	c
more	c
people	c
like	c
shopping	c
now	c
.	c

Sometimes	c
shopping	c
can	c
relax	c
people	c
and	c
increase	c
people	c
's	c
working	c
express	i
.	c

But	c
is	c
it	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
?	c

The	c
most	c
obvious	c
example	c
is	c
that	c
when	c
you	c
're	c
shopping	c
in	c
the	c
shop	c
you	c
're	c
not	c
sure	c
which	c
one	c
you	c
are	c
going	c
to	c
buy	c
,	c
you	c
turn	c
to	c
the	c
people	c
who	c
sell	c
them	c
,	c
but	c
they	c
sometimes	c
ignore	c
you	c
.	c

It	c
makes	c
you	c
angry	c
!	c

Also	c
for	i
example	c
.	i

you	c
really	c
like	c
some	c
shoes	c
or	c
clothes	c
,	c
when	c
you	c
want	c
to	c
buy	c
them	c
,	c
someone	c
tell	i
you	c
"	c
I	c
'm	c
sorry	c
,	c
this	c
one	c
is	c
sold	c
out	c
"	c
!	c

You	c
become	c
unhappy	c
immediately	c
.	c

And	c
sometimes	c
for	i
example	c
,	c
you	c
just	c
bought	c
something	c
last	c
week	c
,	c
but	c
when	c
you	c
go	c
shopping	c
this	c
week	c
,	c
you	c
see	c
the	c
same	c
items	c
but	c
different	c
prices	c
,	c
maybe	c
from	c
Â£	c
50	c
down	c
to	c
Â£	c
20	c
,	c
and	c
then	c
you	c
'll	c
regret	c
wasting	c
money	c
,	c
although	c
you	c
like	c
it	c
very	c
much	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
think	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
!	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
this	c
letter	c
to	c
you	c
to	c
make	c
a	c
complain	i
about	c
the	c
"	i
Over	i
the	i
rainbow	i
"	i
musical	i
show	i
which	c
I	c
saw	c
yesterday	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
I	c
'm	c
very	c
disappointed	c
with	c
what	c
I	c
saw	c
because	c
by	i
seing	i
your	c
advertisment	i
I	c
expected	c
more	c
That	i
show	c
was	c
entirely	c
different	c
to	c
what	c
it	c
says	c
on	i
the	c
advertisment	i
.	c

I	c
arrived	c
at	c
the	c
theatre	c
at	c
19:30	c
,	c
found	c
my	c
seat	c
and	c
waited	c
for	c
forty-five	c
minutes	c
,	c
with	c
two	c
hundred	c
other	c
people	c
for	i
the	c
show	c
to	c
start	c
.	c

When	c
it	c
finally	c
started	c
I	c
noticed	c
that	c
the	c
famous	c
actor	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
was	i
replaced	i
by	c
someone	c
who	c
was	c
not	c
as	c
good	c
as	c
him	c
.	c

Danny	c
Brook	c
was	c
the	c
reason	c
that	c
most	c
people	c
came	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

After	c
some	c
time	c
a	i
few	c
of	c
them	c
started	c
to	c
leave	c
the	c
theatre	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
why	c
I	c
payed	i
Â£	c
20	c
with	c
no	c
discounts	i
as	i
the	c
advertisements	c
said	c
it	i
woul	i
have	c
.	c

I	c
became	c
furious	c
when	c
I	c
saw	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
there	c
were	c
n't	c
any	c
employees	c
to	c
work	i
.	i

So	c
,	c
I	c
went	c
home	c
as	c
fast	c
as	c
I	c
could	c
to	c
write	c
you	c
this	c
letter	c
.	c

The	i
last	c
forty	c
years	c
,	c
technology	c
has	c
been	c
growing	c
very	c
fast	c
.	c

first	i
it	c
was	c
used	c
only	c
by	c
the	c
military	c
or	c
by	c
scientists	c
but	c
the	i
last	c
twenty	c
years	c
modern	c
technology	c
is	i
found	c
in	c
any	c
house	c
,	c
rich	c
or	c
poor	c
and	i
it	c
helps	c
people	c
do	c
hard	c
work	c
.	c

Competers	i
entirely	i
changed	i
people	i
lives	c
.	c

Children	c
can	c
play	c
games	c
on	c
it	i
or	c
watch	c
a	c
film	c
.	c

There	c
are	c
millions	c
of	c
things	c
you	c
can	c
do	c
with	c
a	c
computer	c
.	c

Millions	c
of	c
people	c
use	c
computers	c
for	c
this	c
reason	c
.	c

They	c
are	c
important	c
to	c
people	c
who	c
like	c
to	c
have	c
fun	c
with	c
games	c
and	c
they	c
are	c
,	i
maybe	c
the	c
best	c
way	c
to	c
communicate	c
with	c
someone	c
you	c
know	c
or	c
a	c
person	c
you	c
want	c
to	c
meet	c

I	c
have	c
to	c
admit	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
as	c
I	c
expected	c
;	c
First	c
of	c
all	c

the	c

when	c
I	c
realised	c
he	c
was	c
n't	c
in	i
the	c
scene	i
.	c

During	c
this	c
time	c
,	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
drink	c
in	c
the	c
restaurant	c
but	c
,	c
as	c
well	c
as	c
being	c
closed	c
,	c
there	c
was	c
no	i
nobody	c
from	c
the	c
staff	c
that	c
could	c
help	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
n't	c
believe	c
it	c
!	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
you	c
talk	c
about	c
discounts	c
in	c
your	c
leaflets	c
and	c
they	i
were	c
no	i
available	c
,	c
so	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
an	c
expensive	c
evening	c
!	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
she	c
was	c
a	c
close	c
friend	c
and	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
accuse	c
her	c
of	c
nothing	i
else	c
.	c

I	c
wo	c
n't	c
never	i
forget	c
the	c
day	c
the	c
doctor	c
told	c
me	c
and	c
my	c
Mum	c
the	c
thruth	i
of	i
my	c
strange	c
disease	c
.	c

I	c
bursted	i
into	c
teas	i
as	c
well	i
as	i
my	c
Mother	c
.	c

It	c
seemed	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
something	c
lovely	c
step	i
by	c
step	c
.	c

I	c
still	c
remember	c
her	c
words	c
:	c
"	c
Do	c
n't	c
worry	c
about	c
anything	c
.	c

My	c
lips	c
are	c
sealed	c
"	c
.	c

I	c
do	i
really	i
trusted	i
her	c
when	c
three	c
days	c
after	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
school	c
and	c
I	c
could	c
appreciate	i
I	c
was	c
catching	i
the	i
eyes	i
of	c
everybody	c
.	c

She	c
tried	c
to	c
apologise	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
enough	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

Sure	c
!	c

Thanks	i
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
your	c
recent	c
letter	c
.	c

I	c
can	i
not	i
believe	c
that	c
I	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
(	c
It	i
's	i
great	c
!	c
)	c
and	c
of	i
course	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
happy	c
.	c

Also	c
,	c
please	c
advice	i
for	i
any	c
necessary	i
things	i
to	c
prepare	c
and	c
bring	c
.	c

I	c
looking	i
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
big	c
one	c
that	i
I	i
never	i
thougth	i
and	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
imagine	i
how	c
amazing	c
was	i
it	i
.	c

What	c
a	c
surprised	i
!	c
and	i
unbelieveable	i
,	c
I	c
was	c
responsible	c
for	c
looking	c
after	c
the	c
pop	c
stars	c
.	c

You	c
might	c
understand	c
how	c
excited	c
I	c
was	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
they	c
are	c
so	c
hospitality	i
and	c
warm	c
with	c
people	c
around	c
them	c
.	c

The	i
most	c
appreciated	c
was	c
they	i
've	i
given	i
me	c
their	c
latate	i
CD	c
with	c
signature	i
.	c

Marvellous	c
thing	c
!	c
and	i
of	c
couse	i
as	i
you	c
have	c
seen	c
it	i
I	c
've	c
given	c
one	c
to	c
you	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
're	c
well	c
and	c
enjoyed	c
with	i
CD	c
and	c
do	c
n't	c
forget	c
to	c
write	c
back	c
all	c
about	c
your	c

during	i
my	i
summer	c
holiday	c

Dear	c
Helen	c

I	c
am	c
exciting	i
and	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
doing	i
camp	i
there	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
an	c
important	c
exam	c
in	c
September	c
.	c

Plus	c
,	c
it	c
may	c
be	c
lovely	c
weather	c
at	c
that	c
time	c
in	c
U.S.A	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
log	c
cabins	c
.	c

To	c
tell	c
the	c
truth	c
,	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
both	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
stayed	c
in	c
log	c
cabins	c
before	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
would	i
try	c
new	i
style	c
for	c
me	c
!	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
played	c
tennis	c
for	c
nearly	c
7	c
years	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
also	c
one	c
of	c
my	c
hobbies	c
.	c

If	c
possible	c
,	c
could	c
you	c
please	c
let	c
me	c
know	c
information	c
about	c
the	c
way	c
of	c
getting	c
there	c
,	c
e.g.	c
airport	c
information	c
?	c
?	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Dear	c
Kim	c

Hello	c
,	c
Kim	c
!	c

How	c
was	c
your	c
exam	c
?	c

I	c
believe	c
it	c
went	c
well	c
!	c

By	c
the	c
way	c
,	c
last	c
month	c
I	c
was	c
in	c
that	c
pop	c
concert	c
which	c
you	c
mentioned	c
in	c
your	c
last	c
letters	c
.	c

Can	c
you	c
believe	c
it	c
?	c

I	c
've	c
sold	c
tickets	c
before	c
but	c
not	c
in	c
that	c
kind	c
of	c
big	c
pop	c
concert	c
.	c

Before	c
it	c
was	c
packed	c
into	c
by	c
audience	i
,	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
clean	c
around	c
the	c
reception	c
,	c
but	c
totally	i
it	c
was	c
really	c
exciting	c
although	c
I	c
was	c
just	c
a	c
staff	i
in	c
the	c
small	c
reception	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
felt	c
great	c
excitement	c
(	c
especially	c
girls	c
!	c
)	c
from	c
people	c
queing	i
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
like	c
to	c
tidy	c
up	c
,	c
you	c
know	c
!	c
!	c

I	c
like	c
to	c
face	c
people	c
whom	c
even	i
I	i
do	i
n't	i
know	c
.	c

Foremost	c
,	c
after	c
finishing	c
my	c
work	c
,	c
I	c
could	c
meet	c
singers	c
by	c
chance	c
!	c
!	c

That	c
night	c
was	c
brilliant	c
and	c
class	c
!	c

Anyway	c
,	c
hope	c
to	c
hear	c
from	c
you	c
shortly	c
.	c

See	c
you	c
.	c

Love	c

From	c

I	c
feel	c
disappointed	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
different	c
to	c
the	i
advertisement	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
the	c
performers	c
should	c
be	i
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
.	c

I	c
feel	c
most	c
disappointed	c
about	c
this	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
I	c
bought	c
a	c
Â£	c
20	c
ticket	c
without	c
any	c
discount	c
even	i
the	c
advertisement	c
mentioned	c
discount	i
is	i
available	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
at	i
that	c
day	c
was	c
their	c
day-off	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
am	c
wondering	c
why	c
it	c
said	c
we	c
could	c
visit	c
the	c
restaurant	c
if	c
you	c
know	i
it	c
would	c
be	c
closed	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
afraid	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
a	i
best	c
musical	c
show	c
because	c
all	i
the	i
things	i
above	i
was	i
not	i
an	i
accurate	i
as	i
what	i
we	i
had	i
been	i
told	i
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
your	c
reply	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

I	c
say	c
this	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
experience	c
I	c
've	c
had	c
from	i
her	c
.	c

She	c
is	i
sitting	i
next	c
to	c
me	c
,	i
we	i
started	c
to	c
chat	c
more	c
and	c
more	c
,	i
then	i
we	c
became	c
good	c
friends	c
.	c

I	c
know	c
this	c
is	c
one	i
right	i
love	i
,	i
I	c
'm	c
absolutely	c
besorrted	i
of	i
him	c
.	c

Then	c
I	c
told	c
this	c
to	c
Pat	c
and	c
told	c
her	c
to	c
keep	c
it	c
secret	c
:	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
want	c
people	c
gossip	i
behind	i
me	c
then	i
everyone	c
would	c
know	c
I	c
fancy	i
him	c
.	c

She	c
told	c
everyone	c
that	c
I	c
fancy	c
him	c
and	c
everybody	c
always	c
make	i
joke	i
on	i
it	c
,	i
that	i
makes	c
me	c
feel	c
so	c
embarrised	i
:	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
angry	c
at	c
that	c
time	c
!	c

I	c
had	c
really	c
expected	i
the	c
show	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
the	c
first	c
time	c
I	c
had	c
seen	c
it	c
in	c
London	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
attracted	c
by	c
your	c
advertisement	c
which	c
looked	c
very	c
exciting	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
found	c
it	c
very	c
disappointing	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
not	c
at	c
19.30	c
so	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
wait	c
for	c
45	c
minutes	c
on	i
the	i
seat	c
so	i
it	c
made	c
me	c
upset	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
disappointed	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
the	c
actors	c
showed	c
up	c
on	c
stage	c
because	c
they	c
were	c
not	c
actors	i
who	c
you	c
advertised	c
.	c

Thirdly	c
,	c
you	c
state	c
that	c
there	c
are	c
discounts	c
available	c
but	c
I	c
could	c
not	c
get	c
any	c
reductions	c
at	c
all	c
.	c

You	c
mentioned	c
that	i
"	c
Your	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
!	c
"	c
in	c
your	c
advert	c
.	c

but	c
it	c
was	c
not	i
absolutely	i
true	c
!	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
receiving	c
your	c
cheque	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

For	c
many	c
years	c
scientific	c
and	c
technological	c
break	i
throughs	i
have	c
changed	c
our	c
lives	c
.	c

Amaisingly	i
,	c
we	c
can	c
find	c
that	c
computer	i
users	i
are	i
getting	i
more	i
and	i
more	i
.	c

So	c
the	i
life	c
is	c
much	c
faster	c
and	c
more	c
convenient	c
than	c
before	c
.	c

My	c
daily	c
life	c
has	c
also	c
changed	c
a	c
lot	c
through	c
the	c
use	c
of	c
computer	i
or	c
mordern	i
technology	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
using	c
computer	i
is	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
for	i
me	c
because	c
I	c
can	c
store	c
my	c
personal	c
records	c
such	c
as	c
diary	c
or	c
expenses	c
and	c
I	c
send	c
E-mail	c
to	c
my	c
friends	c
who	c
live	c
abroad	c
.	c

I	c
used	c
to	c
write	c
letters	c
but	c
it	c
takes	c
time	c
to	c
arrive	c
there	c
or	c
sometimes	c
disappear	i
so	i
E-mail	c
is	c
brilliant	c
for	c
my	c
life	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
to	c
this	c
,	c
doing	i
internet	i
is	c
quite	c
useful	c
and	c
helpful	c
to	c
have	c
information	c
from	c
all	c
over	c
the	c
world	c
.	c

Before	c
I	c
go	c
on	c
holiday	c
I	c
use	c
internet	i
to	c
book	c
or	c
get	c
details	c
from	c
travel	i
agency	c
,	c
which	c
means	c
I	c
could	c
save	c
my	c
time	c
and	c
physical	c
energy	c
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
in	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
many	c
advantages	c
in	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
at	c
present	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
recommend	c
people	c
learn	c
computers	c
and	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
say	c
"	c
Enjoy	c
your	c
lives	c
"	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
with	c
regard	c
to	c
the	c
letter	c
I	c
've	c
just	c
received	c
as	c
I	c
wish	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
some	c
further	c
information	c
about	c
myself	c

Regarding	c
the	c
activities	c
I	i
've	c
chosen	c
swimming	c
as	c
I	c
'm	c
very	c
keen	c
on	c
it	c
and	c
I	c
'm	c
fairly	c
good	c
at	c
it	c
,	c
but	i
I	c
expect	c
the	c
water	c
to	c
be	c
as	i
crystal	c
clear	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
an	c
awful	c
singer	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
learn	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
for	c
vegetarian	c
food	c
for	c
me	c
as	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
very	c
extrict	i
vegan	c

to	c
suggest	c
me	i
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
to	c
bring	c

Well	c
,	c
I	c
've	c
just	c
polled	c
some	c
students	c
and	c
here	c
are	c
their	c
responses	c
.	c

70	c
%	c
of	c
students	c
think	c
we	c
should	c
film	c
the	c
Speech	c
and	c
Drama	c
lesson	c
because	c
is	i
one	c
of	c
the	c
lessons	c
they	c
enjoy	c
the	c
most	c
.	c

Most	c
of	c
them	c
said	c
Science	c
,	c
English	c
and	c
Literature	c
should	c
n't	c
be	c
filmed	c
because	c
they	c
are	c
not	c
very	c
interesting	c
and	c
are	c
also	i
very	c
boring	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
I	c
think	c
basketball	c
should	c
be	c
filmed	c
too	c
because	c
is	i
one	c
of	c
the	c
activities	c
the	c
students	c
are	c
very	c
keen	c
on	c
doing	c
and	c
they	c
usually	c
enjoy	c
it	c
.	c

Firsty	i
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
warmly	c
for	c
this	c
great	c
prize	c
.	c

Here	c
are	i
some	c
information	i
and	c
details	c
you	c
requested	c
:	c

Concerning	c
the	c
dates	c
of	c
the	c
stay	c
,	c
I	c
will	c
only	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
come	c
during	c
the	c
first	c
two	c
weeks	c
of	c
July	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
starting	c
a	c
new	c
job	c
on	c
July	c
15th	c
.	c

Since	c
I	c
have	c
some	c
serious	c
back	c
problems	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
a	i
cabin	i
for	i
sleeping	i
.	i

About	i
your	c
activities	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
picked	c
basketball	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
love	c
it	c
:	c
I	c
am	i
a	i
player	i
in	c
a	c
local	c
club	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
playing	c
for	c
twelve	c
years	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
guess	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
"	c
good	c
"	c
player	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
joining	c
you	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c

Yours	c

We	c

a	c
short	c

about	c

showed	i
through	c
the	c

Dear	c

My	c
name	c
is	c
Alida	c

and	c
I	c
'm	c
writing	c
you	i
about	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
which	c
I	c
saw	c
during	c
my	c
stay	c
in	c
London	c
recently	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
a	c
fun	i
of	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
so	c
when	c
I	c
read	c
in	i
the	i
advertisement	i
his	i
name	i
I	c
immediately	c
decided	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
n't	c
true	c
;	c
there	c
were	c
n't	c
any	c
discounts	c
.	c

The	c
show	c
started	c
at	c
20.15	c
and	c
not	c
at	c
19.30	c
so	c
we	c
waiting	i
for	c
long	i
time	c

Before	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
,	c
a	c
man	c
said	c
that	c
there	i
was	i
n't	i
Danny	i
Brook	i
because	c
he	c
was	c
ill	c
.	c

After	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
which	c
was	c
n't	c
as	c
good	c
as	c
we	c
expected	c
,	c
we	c
decided	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
people	c
in	c
the	c
kitchen	c
were	c
n't	c
ready	c
with	c
the	c
food	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
n't	c
a	c
"	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
"	c
like	c
you	c
said	c
in	c
the	c

so	c
my	c

would	c
be	c
gratefull	i
if	c
you	c
will	i
give	c

if	c
it	i
is	c

Dear	c
Sandro	c

I	i
'm	i
Alida	c

how	c
are	c
you	c
?	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
you	i
because	c
I	c
have	c
an	c
important	c
thing	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
.	c

I	c
read	c
in	c
the	c
newspaper	c
that	c
in	c
the	c
next	c
days	i
some	c
book	i
of	c
short	c
stories	c
are	c

A	c
few	c
days	c

you	c
told	c
me	c
that	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
read	c
"	c

,	c
this	i

I	c
suggest	c
you	c
to	i
listen	i
to	c
it	c
because	c
it	c
's	c
a	c
very	c
interesting	c
book	c
and	c
you	c
can	c
relax	c
while	c
someone	c

Well	c

I	c

I	c

it	c
two	c
months	c

and	c
I	c
liked	c
it	c

I	c
think	c

Now	c
I	c

I	c
'll	c

Love	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
,	c

However	c
,	c
we	c
have	c
seen	c
an	c
advertisement	c
about	i
"	c
The	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
"	c
recently	c
.	c

According	c
to	c
an	i
advertisement	c
,	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
events	c
will	c
take	c
place	c
during	c
the	c
show	c
such	c
as	c
make	i
up	i
,	c
hairstyles	c
,	c
latest	c
fashions	c
and	c
leisure	c
and	c
sports	c
wear	c
.	c

It	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
golden	c
opportunity	c
to	c
know	i
up-to-date	c
fashion	c
.	c

After	c
consideration	c
,	c
we	c
would	c
like	c
you	c
to	c
reorganise	c
the	c
2nd	c
day	i
programme	c
.	c

We	c
are	c
politely	c
asking	c
you	c
.	c

It	c
would	c
be	c
grateful	i
if	c
you	c
can	i
reorganise	c
this	c
matter	i
at	c
your	c
earliest	c
convenience	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
meeting	c
you	c
to	c
discuss	c
this	c
matter	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

Hide	c
and	c
Seek	c
!	c

Undoubtedly	c
,	c
their	c
the	i
first	c
enemies	c
are	c
"	c
Journalists	c
"	c
.	c

Because	c
it	c
is	c
interesting	c
and	c
they	c
can	c
forget	c
about	c
their	c
own	c
problems	c
by	c
imagining	c
celebrities	c
'	c
luxurious	c
lives	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
they	c
think	c
that	c
celebrities	c
do	c
not	c
have	c
to	c
hide	c
from	c
publicity	c
because	c
it	c
means	c
that	c
they	c
are	c
extremely	c
popular	c
with	c
people	c
and	c
being	c
loved	c
.	c

They	c
claim	c
that	c
it	c
is	c
absolutely	c
intrusion	i
on	c
the	i
privacy	c
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
both	c
advantages	c
and	c
disadvantages	c
of	i
covering	c
celebrities	c
.	c

Taking	c
everything	c
account	i
,	c
the	c
drawbacks	c
far	c
outweigh	c
its	c
benefits	c
.	c

Thus	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
journalists	c
should	c
consider	c
celebrities	c
'	c
lives	c
and	c
be	i
in	c
celebrities	c
'	c
shoes	c
.	c

With	i
replay	i
on	i
your	c
letter	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
I	c
was	c
really	c
pleased	c
with	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
just	i
in	c
July	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
going	c
to	c
study	c
at	c
my	c
university	c
untill	i
the	c
end	c
of	c
June	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
glad	c
that	c
all	c
accommodation	c
and	c
travel	c
costs	c
have	c
been	c
paid	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
posibilities	i
for	c
spending	c
my	c
spare	c
time	c
.	c

At	i
the	i
end	i
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
with	c
me	c
and	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
will	c
need	c
for	c
the	c
normal	c
life	c
at	c

Report	c
on	c
making	c
a	i
interesting	c
video	c
film	c

The	c
aim	c
of	c
this	c
report	c
is	c
to	c
suggest	c
which	c
lessons	c
and	c
other	c
activities	c
should	c
be	c
place	i
at	i
video	i
film	c
about	c
daily	c
life	c
at	c
our	c
school	c
.	c

Some	c
of	c
the	c
teachers	c
are	c
very	c
good	c
just	i
profesionalists	i
.	c

Their	c
lessons	c
are	c
valuable	c
,	c
rich	c
in	c
knowledge	c
and	c
funy	i
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
the	c
teacher	c
of	c
history	c
and	c
polish	i
language	c
is	c
able	c
to	c
interest	c
students	c
about	i
the	c
subject	c
in	c
differents	i
ways	c
.	c

According	c
to	c
students	c
'	c
oppinions	i
the	i
most	c
popular	c
activities	c
are	c
the	i
basketball	c
,	c
tennis	c
,	c
swimming	c
and	c
as	i
well	i
the	c
photography	c
group	c
and	c
the	c
painting	c
team	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
surprising	c
that	c
45	c
per	c
cent	c
of	c
the	c
students	c
questioned	c
frequent	c
one	c
of	c
this	i
sport	i
's	i
group	i
and	c
30	c
per	c
cent	c
of	c
people	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
photography	c
group	c
.	c

It	c
can	i
maks	i
the	c
video	c
more	c
interesting	c
.	c

If	c
we	c
take	i
under	i
an	i
attention	i
this	i
things	c
our	c
film	c
is	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
very	c
interesting	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
madam	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
called	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
that	c
was	c
advertised	c
in	c
this	c
week	c
's	c
newspaper	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
really	c
disappointing	c
!	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
at	c
the	c
wrong	c
time	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
said	c
that	c
it	c
would	c
start	c
at	c
19.30	c
but	c
it	c
was	i
not	c
.	c

It	c
started	c
fourty	i
five	i
minutes	c
later	c
.	c

And	c
if	c
this	c
were	c
not	c
enough	c
,	c
I	c
had	i
no	c
discount	c
in	i
the	c
ticket	c
as	i
was	c
written	i
.	c

So	c
why	c
you	i
make	c
this	c
invitation	c
?	c

I	c
suppose	c
that	c
you	c
are	i
understanding	i
my	c
situation	c
,	c
because	c
you	c
did	c
not	c
say	i
the	c
truth	c
.	c

I	c
believe	c
that	c
you	c
will	i
be	i
direct	i
to	c
blame	c
and	i
give	c
me	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c

Nowadays	c
the	i
modern	c
technology	c
is	c
increasing	i
and	c
it	c
was	i
really	c
affecting	c
our	c
daily	c
life	c
.	c

Sometimes	c
there	c
advantages	i
but	c
there	c
some	i
disadvantages	c
too	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
one	c
advantage	c
of	c
it	c
is	c
that	c
you	c
can	c
do	c
things	c
faster	c
.	c

Beside	c
this	c
you	c
can	c
talk	c
with	c
a	c
person	c
in	i
the	c
other	c
side	c
of	c
the	c
world	c
by	i
a	c
computer	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
interesting	c
!	c

Furthermore	c
it	c
helps	c
in	i
house	i
works	i
,	c
at	c
school	c
and	c
you	c
can	c
travel	c
to	c
places	c
very	c
quickly	c
.	c

First	c
and	c
foremost	c
is	c
the	c
pollution	c
and	c
big	c
cities	c
are	c
suffering	c
with	c
it	c
.	c

Dear	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
reply	c
for	i
it	c
.	c

To	c
begin	c
with	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
join	c
the	c
camp	c
only	c
in	c
July	c

It	c
seems	c
more	c
comfortable	c
than	c
tents	c

I	c
am	c
good	c
at	c
tennis	c
as	c
well	c
as	c
swimming	c

According	c
to	c
your	c
letter	c
,	c
all	c
travel	c
costs	c
are	c
included	c
in	c
your	c
service	c
,	c
however	c
,	c
how	c
much	c
pocket	c
money	c
do	c
I	c
need	c
?	c

I	c
would	c
be	c
grateful	c
if	c
you	c
would	c
give	c
me	c
more	c
information	c

I	c

is	c
not	c

enjoyable	c

Especially	i
it	i
is	i
one	i
of	i
the	i
hobbies	i
for	i

Moreover	c
,	c
if	c
they	c
buy	c
some	c
nice	c
things	c
at	c
sale	i
,	c
they	c
must	c
be	c
very	c
satisfied	c

People	c
often	c
waste	c
money	c
for	i
unvaluable	i
things	c

Then	c
,	c
they	c
really	c
regret	c
it	c

On	c
the	c
other	c

,	c
after	c
they	c
buy	c
something	c
,	c
they	c
find	c
a	c
better	c
one	c

addition	c
,	c

them	c

sum	c
up	c

there	c

for	c

have	c
to	c
be	c
more	c
careful	c
and	c
hold	c
your	c
bag	c
tightly	c
because	c
this	c
is	c
a	c
good	c
period	c
for	c
all	c
thieves	c
(	c
they	c
know	c
they	c
can	c
steal	c
something	c
without	c
having	c
been	c
seen	c
!	c
)	c

Another	c
period	c
when	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
like	c
doing	c
shopping	c
is	c
when	c
there	c
is	c
a	c
huge	c
sale	c
!	c

Next	c
,	c
not	i
very	c
enjoyable	c
thing	c
about	c
shopping	c
is	c
spending	c
money	c
!	c

When	c
I	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
big	c
supermarkets	c
I	c
always	c
spend	c
more	c
than	c
I	c
was	c
going	c
to	c
.	c

You	c
just	c
cannot	c
refuse	i
buying	c
another	c
bottle	c
of	c
body	c
lotion	c
or	c
another	c
box	c
of	c
soap	c
because	c
they	c
smell	c
so	c
nice	c
can	c
you	c
?	c
!	c

The	c
only	c
advice	c
would	c
be	c
:	c
"	c
Do	c
not	c
do	c
your	c
shopping	c
at	c
Christmast	i
or	c
Easter	c
time	c
"	c
-	c
but	c
it	c
will	c
not	c
make	c
any	c
sense	c
,	c
will	c
it	c
?	c

So	c
you	c
just	c
have	c
to	c
get	c
used	c
to	c
it	c
,	c
and	c
enjoy	c
your	c
shopping	c
for	c
the	c
rest	c
time	i
of	c
the	c
year	c

17th	c
June	c
2000	c

Having	c
seen	c
with	i
two	c
of	c
my	c
friends	c
your	i
musical	c
show	c
last	c
week-end	i
at	c
The	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
which	i
called	i
"	c
OVER	c
THE	c
RAINBOW	c
"	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
our	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
in	c
your	c
advertisement	c
you	c
refer	c
to	c
discounts	c
that	c
are	c
available	c
,	c
but	c
when	i
we	c
bought	c
our	c
tickets	c
,	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
employees	c
refused	c
to	c
give	c
us	c
'	c
tickets	i
student	i
price	i
'	c
.	c

Usually	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
starts	c
at	c
19:30	c
,	c
but	c
this	c
time	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
wait	c
until	c
20:15	c
!	c

In	c
addition	c
to	c
this	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
the	c
famous	c
actors	c
that	c
you	c
have	i
mentionned	i
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
,	i
so	c
we	c
were	c
disappointed	c
.	c

Concerning	c
the	c
restaurant	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
due	i
to	i
transformations	i
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
request	c
a	c
full-refund	i
for	c
my	c
friends	c
and	c
I	i
,	c
because	c
I	c
felt	c
your	c
advertisement	c
was	c
misleading	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
sure	c
that	c
anyone	i
has	c
already	c
thought	c
about	c
it	c
,	c
because	c
fashionable	c
clothes	c
have	c
always	c
been	c
really	c
important	c
for	c
almost	c
all	c
of	c
us	c
.	c

Let	c
's	c
have	c
a	c
look	c
at	c
different	c
points	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
to	c
this	c
,	c
anyone	c
will	c
agree	c
with	c
me	c
that	c
clothes	c
are	c
the	c
best	c
invention	c
ever	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
evident	c
that	c
whatever	c
we	c
wear	c
look	i
like	c
clothes	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
we	c
should	c
stop	c
being	c
so	c
stupid	c
.	c

We	c
ca	c
n't	c
wearing	i
peculiar	c
clothes	c
like	c
in	c
science	c
fiction	c
films	c
.	c

The	c
last	c
survey	c
about	c
fashion	c
shown	i
that	c
people	c
feel	c
really	c
comfortable	c
with	c
those	i
now	c
!	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
because	c
I	c
'm	c
very	c
disappointed	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
not	c
from	c
here	c
(	c
this	c
city	c
)	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
know	c
everything	c
about	c
it	c
:	c
it	i
's	i
culture	c
,	c
history	c
and	c
the	c
famous	c
musicals	c
.	c

Yesterday	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
to	c
see	c
a	c
musical	c
show	i
.	c

I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
to	c
see	c
at	i
what	c
time	c
was	i
the	i
show	i
,	c
19.30	c
,	i
it	i
was	c
O.K.	i
so	c
I	c
bought	c
a	c
ticket	c
.	c

In	i
that	c
moment	c
my	c
problems	c
began	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
n't	c
get	c
any	c
discount	c
;	c
that	c
mean	i
,	i
that	c
the	c
advertisement	c
was	c
wrong	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
bought	c
the	c
ticket	c
anyway	c
.	c

That	c
was	c
too	c
much	c
.	c

"	c
Dear	c
"	c
manager	c
I	c
hope	c
you	c
to	i
understand	i
me	c
,	c
so	i
I	c
ask	c
for	c
money	c
back	c
and	c
I	c
hope	c
this	c
wont	i
happen	c
again	c
.	c

By	i

First	c
of	c
all	c
I	i
think	c
we	c
have	c
grown	c
with	i
the	i
technology	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
difficult	c
for	c
us	c
to	c
realize	i
the	c
changes	c
in	c
our	c
live	i
,	c
but	c
we	c
can	c
think	c
about	c
it	i
.	c

How	c
has	c
it	c
change	i
my	c
daily	c
life	c
?	c

Now	c
I	c
only	c
used	i
to	c
push	c
a	c
button	c
,	c
and	c
things	c
or	c
mashines	i
work	c
on	c
their	c
own	c
.	c

Homework	c
is	c
easer	i
to	c
find	i
in	i
the	c
cumputer	i
than	c
in	i
a	c
book	c
sometimes	c
.	c

Modern	c
technology	c
showed	c
us	c
that	c
we	c
could	c
do	c
anything	c
we	c
wanted	c
to	c
,	c
and	c
it	c
make	i
us	c
thing	i
more	c
about	c
my	i
future	c
job	i
.	c

Maybe	c
,	c
I	c
wo	c
n't	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
understand	c
how	c
the	c
things	c
worked	i
and	c
that	c
scare	i
me	c
,	i
I	c
will	c
be	c
useless	c
,	c
because	c
a	c
mashine	i
will	c
do	c
all	c
the	c
work	c
.	c

Dear	c
Manager	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
about	c
the	c
musical	c
Show	c
'	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
'	c
I	c
saw	c
in	c
London	c
last	c
weekend	c
.	c

And	c
then	c
about	c
the	c
tickets	c
,	c
you	c
wrotte	i
that	c
they	i
were	c
discounts	c
available	c
but	c
they	i
were	c
not	c
.	c

Finaly	i
when	c
we	c
had	c
seen	c
the	c
Musical	c
,	c
we	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
restaurant	c
and	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
they	c
done	i
some	c
dekoreting	i
,	c
and	c
you	c
wrott	i
in	c
your	c
advertisement	c
"	i
Visit	c
our	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
"	c

I	c
looking	i
forwart	i
to	c
hear	i
from	c
you	c
.	c

Clothes	c
in	c
the	c
future	c

If	c
you	c
travlling	i
around	c
you	c
can	c
see	c
lot	i
of	c
different	i
still	c
from	i
different	c
culture	i
.	c

And	c
that	c
is	c
nice	c
if	c
you	c
can	c
pick	c
up	c
the	c
best	c
thing	i
from	c
all	c
over	c
the	c
world	c
,	c
but	c
on	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
it	c
is	c
not	c
so	c
nice	c
if	c
every	c
country	i
wear	i
some	i
type	c
of	c
clothes	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
make	i
you	c
know	c
how	c
angry	c
I	c
am	c
for	i
having	c
gone	c
to	c
one	c
of	c
your	c
shows	c
.	c

I	c
went	c
to	c
London	c
for	c
a	c
week	c
's	c
holiday	c
with	c
some	c
friends	c
and	c
every	c
evening	c
we	c
decided	c
something	i
to	i
do	i
in	c
order	c
to	c
enjoy	c
our	c
staying	i
in	c
that	c
beautiful	c
city	c
.	c

In	c
fact	c
,	c
only	i
after	i
having	c
going	i
into	c
the	c
theatre	c
,	c
I	c
realized	c
that	c
the	c
advertisement	c
I	c
had	c
read	c
was	c
probably	c
about	c
another	c
show	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
when	c
I	c
paid	c
my	i
ticket	c
I	c
noticed	c
that	c
nobody	c
could	c
obtain	c
the	c
discount	c
you	c
'd	c
written	c
about	c
.	c

But	c
that	c
would	c
be	c
nothing	c
if	c
I	i
thought	i
to	i
dinner	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
cancelled	i
because	c
your	c
show	c
started	c
at	c
20.15	c
,	c
although	c
it	c
should	c
have	c
been	c
at	c
19.30	c
!	c

Besides	c
,	c
when	c
we	c
decided	c
to	c
spend	c
the	c
evening	c
in	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
,	c
we	c
were	c
informed	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
the	c
chef	c
was	c
ill	c
.	c

At	c
that	c
point	c
,	c
even	c
if	c
there	i
had	i
been	i
Danny	i
Brook	i
as	c
the	c
advertisement	c
announced	c
,	c
it	c
would	i
n't	i
have	c
been	c
a	c
less	i
disappointing	c
evening	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

I	c
had	c
just	c
quarreled	i
with	c
Jon	c
,	c
who	c
is	c
my	c
fiance	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
when	c
Peter	c
,	c
who	c
has	c
been	c
a	c
friend	c
of	c
mine	c
since	c
we	c
were	c
children	c
invited	i
me	c
for	c
a	c
pizza	c
,	c
I	c
accepted	c
without	c
thinking	c
at	i
the	c
consequences	c
.	c

And	c
there	c
would	c
have	c
been	c
no	c
problems	c
if	c
I	c
had	c
n't	c
talked	c
to	c
Pat	c
about	c
that	c
evening	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
only	c
a	c
dinner	c
with	c
a	c
friend	c
and	c
in	c
fact	c
we	c
'd	c
spent	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
remembering	c
our	c
childhood	c
,	c
but	c
probably	c
Pat	c
can	i
have	i
thought	c
that	c
Peter	c
and	c
I	c
were	c
n't	c
only	c
friends	c
.	c

So	c
she	c
ran	c
to	c
Jon	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
make	i
him	c
know	c
the	i
terrible	c
mistake	c
I	c
had	c
made	c
that	c
evening	c
.	c

By	c
the	c
way	c
,	c
I	i
've	i
understood	i
I	c
had	c
better	c
trust	c
in	c
nobody	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
what	c
it	i
happened	c
me	i
two	c
days	c
ago	c
,	c
during	c
you	i
musical	c
show	c
"	c
OVER	c
THE	c
RAINBOW	c
"	c
.	c

He	c
told	c
me	c
to	c
go	c
because	c
the	c
actor	c
's	c
performance	c
was	c
good	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
decided	c
buying	i
a	c
ticket	c
,	c
but	c
no	c
discounts	c
were	c
available	c
.	c

Then	c
with	c
my	i
disappointing	i
I	c
noticed	c
that	c
there	c
was	c
different	i
actor	c
instead	c
of	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
.	c

And	c
why	c
did	c
the	c
show	c
start	c
at	c
20:15	c
instead	c
of	c
19:30	c
?	c

After	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
my	c
friends	c
and	c
me	i
decided	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
your	c
restaurant	c
,	c
but	c
we	c
were	c
amazed	c
to	c
find	c
it	c
close	i
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
I	c
ask	i
for	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
a	i
perfect	c
evening	c
like	i
your	c
advice	i
showed	i
.	c

Certainly	c
it	i
will	i
be	i
easier	c
and	c
faster	c
than	c
write	i
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
nice	c
when	c
you	c
were	c
waiting	c
for	c
a	c
letter	c
.	c

It	c
could	i
n't	i
allow	i
us	c
to	i
think	i
and	c
to	i
do	i
freely	c
.	c

Probably	c
,	c
because	c
their	c
parents	c
have	c
n't	c
enough	c
time	c
to	c
go	i
out	i
the	c
city	c
and	c
show	c
them	c
nature	c
.	c

So	c
they	c
prefer	c
leave	i
their	c
sons	c
wecting	i
TV	c
.	c

Modern	c
technology	c
?	c

Yes	c
,	c
but	c
we	c
must	c
n't	c
loose	i
the	i
values	c
and	i
our	c
free	i
time	i
to	c
stay	i
with	c
our	c
family	i
.	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
really	c
glad	c
to	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
win	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
and	c
travel	c
to	c
the	c
U.S.A.	c
which	i
I	c
used	c
to	c
dream	c
.	i

Now	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
reply	c
some	i
questions	c
you	c
need	i
,	c
willingly	c
.	c

At	i
first	i
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
only	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
I	c
study	c
at	c
University	c
at	c
the	c
moment	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
they	c
will	c
give	c
me	c
such	c
a	c
long	c
holiday	c
enough	i
to	c
travel	c
for	c
two	c
weeks	c
in	c
June	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
staying	c
tents	i
to	c
log	c
cabins	c
,	c
as	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
observe	c
nature	c
and	c
stay	c
in	i
outdoor	i
as	c
much	c
time	c
as	c
I	c
can	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
very	c
happy	c
with	c
the	c
activities	c
you	c
organised	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
rather	c
play	c
golf	c
and	c
go	c
sailing	c
,	c
than	c
the	c
others	c
so	i
as	c
to	c
find	c
new	c
hobbies	c
in	c
my	c
life	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
what	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
is	c
what	c
sort	c
of	c
cloths	i
are	c
suitable	c
for	c
the	i
travelling	c
,	c
and	c
also	c
,	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	i
should	i
prepare	c
for	c
the	c
travelling	i
,	c
approximately	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
be	c
grateful	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
reply	c
my	i
letter	c
with	c
some	c
further	c
information	c
soon	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

Talking	c
of	c
my	c
work	c
,	c
I	c
had	i
to	i
mostly	i
make	i
the	c
concert	c
stage	c
with	c
some	c
fellows	i
.	c

If	c
you	c
choose	i
the	c
post	c
,	c
you	c
would	c
be	c
exhausted	i
throughlly	i
in	i
the	c
end	c
of	c
the	c
concert	c
.	c

As	c
I	c
could	c
take	c
a	c
rest	c
beside	c
the	c
concert	c
stage	c
while	c
someone	c
was	c
singing	c
a	c
song	c
,	c
I	c
saw	c
a	c
number	c
of	c
famous	c
musicians	c
nearby	c
.	c

It	c
must	c
be	c
a	c
good	c
experience	c
and	c
a	c
special	c
memory	c
for	c
you	c
.	c

See	c
you	c
and	c
write	c
me	i
soon	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
satisfied	i
to	c
have	c
received	c
your	c
letter	c
that	c
informed	c
me	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
happy	c
to	c
spend	c
two	c
weeks	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
gone	i
to	c
U.S.A.	i
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
travel	c
only	c
in	c
July	c
,	c
because	c
I	i
have	i
not	i
to	i
work	i
and	c
because	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
have	i
accomodation	i
in	c
tent	i
and	c
so	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
july	i
is	c
the	c
best	c
period	i
to	c
spend	c
two	c
weeks	c
in	c
tent	i
.	c

During	c
the	c
journey	i
I	c
would	c
do	c
surfing	c
and	c
photography	c
.	c

I	c
like	c
very	c
much	c
to	c
be	c
alone	c
with	c
nature	c
and	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
girl	c
,	c
I	c
had	i
gone	i
to	i
a	c
surfing-course	i
for	c
five	c
years	c
and	c
I	c
won	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
prizes	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
receive	i
further	c
information	c
about	c
which	i
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
should	c
put	i
off	i
during	c
my	c
holiday	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
know	i
if	c
I	c
should	c
bring	c
with	c
me	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
money	c
.	c

Looking	c
forward	c
to	c
spending	c
my	c
holiday	c
in	c
the	c
USA	c
I	i
wait	c
your	i
letter	c
.	c

Your	i
sincerelly	i

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
afraid	c
that	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
write	c
you	i
immediatly	i
,	c
but	c
last	c
month	c
I	c
enjoyed	c
helping	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
and	c
so	c
I	c
am	i
very	c
busy	c
.	c

I	c
particularly	c
liked	c
to	i
know	i
people	c
of	i
different	c
countries	c
and	c
some	c
pop-stars	c
,	c
which	i
were	c
friendly	c
with	i
us	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
surprised	c
of	i
the	c
co-operation	c
that	c
there	c
was	c
during	i
the	i
job	i
,	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
as	i
a	c
big	c
family	c
,	c
where	c
each	c
member	c
helped	i
others	i
.	c

It	c
was	c
wonderful	c
!	c

Looking	c
forward	c
to	c
meeting	i
you	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c
.	c

Best	c
wishes	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
.	c

This	i
period	c
the	c
days	c
are	c
sunny	c
and	c
the	c
weather	c
wo	c
n't	c
prevent	c
me	c
from	c
doing	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
activities	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
the	c
combins	i
are	c
safer	c
than	c
the	c
tents	c
and	c
they	c
can	c
protect	c
you	c
better	c
in	c
case	c
the	c
weather	c
changes	c
.	c

The	c
two	c
activities	c
I	c
have	c
chosen	c
is	i
swimming	c
and	c
climbing	c
.	c

I	c
like	c
it	c
because	c
it	c
offers	c
you	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
adventure	c
and	c
action	c
.	c

As	c
a	c
conclusion	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
about	c
the	c
money	c
and	c
the	c
cloths	i
I	c
must	c
take	c
with	c
.	i

Please	c
drop	c
me	c
a	c
line	c

Yours	c
sincierly	i

Dear	c
Kim	c

Yesterday	c
I	c
received	c
your	c
letter	c
and	c
it	c
made	c
me	c
happy	c
that	c
you	c
and	c
your	c
family	c
are	c
healthy	c
.	c

All	c
the	c
children	c
helped	c
as	c
much	c
as	c
they	c
could	c
and	c
that	c
's	c
why	c
the	c
result	c
was	c
beautiful	c
enough	i
.	c

It	c
was	c
very	c
hard	c
and	c
at	c
the	c
end	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
tired	c
.	c

At	c
the	c
concert	c
,	c
what	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
was	c
to	c
give	c
out	c
refreshments	c
and	c
drinkings	i
to	c
the	c
audience	c
.	c

It	c
offered	c
me	c
more	c
pocket	c
money	c
and	c
besides	c
this	c
I	c
had	c
the	c
chance	c
to	c
make	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
friends	c
because	c
there	c
were	c
many	c
children	c
who	c
wanted	c
to	c
help	c
too	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
I	c
had	c
the	c
opportunity	c
to	c
talk	c
to	c
the	c
singers	c
and	c
have	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
autogrammes	i
by	c
them	c
.	c

Dear	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
have	c
received	c
your	c
letter	c
and	c
I	c
so	i
happy	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
the	c
holiday	c
in	c
California	c
.	c

With	c
reference	c
to	c
the	c
accommodation	c
I	i
would	c
prefer	c
log	i
cabins	i
to	c
tents	i
.	c

I	c
think	c
the	i
log	c
cabins	c
are	c
more	c
comfortable	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
slept	c
in	c
a	c
tents	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
playing	c
basketball	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
child	c
I	c
used	c
to	c
play	c
daily	c
with	c
my	c
classmates	c
and	c
now	c
I	c
am	i
playing	i
at	c
least	c
at	i
the	i
weekend	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
,	i
how	c
much	c
I	i
need	c
and	c
what	c
type	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
should	c
take	c
?	c

Could	c
you	c
tell	c
me	c
about	c
the	c
weather	c
,	c
please	c
?	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
doing	c
different	c
activities	c
from	i
designering	i
flier	i
to	c
selling	c
tickets	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
responsible	c
for	c
checking	c
the	c
light	c
and	c
sound	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
I	c
checked	c
the	c
e-mail	c
dialy	i
and	c
answered	c
the	c
phone	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
know	c
I	i
sold	c
tickets	c
in	c
some	c
schools	c
and	c
pubs	c
,	c
too	c
.	c

Anyway	c
,	c
it	c
has	c
been	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
most	c
wonderful	c
experience	i
in	i
my	c
life	c
,	c
but	c
the	c
concert	i
day	i
was	c
really	c
amazing	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
this	c
was	c
the	c
best	c
of	c
all	c
.	c

I	c
feel	c
really	c
happy	c
that	c
I	c
participated	c
in	c
this	c
event	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
have	c
the	c
opportunity	c
of	c
involving	i
in	c
something	c
like	c
this	c
you	i
do	c
not	c
hesitate	c
.	c

Yours	c

Dear	c
Sirs	c

I	c
was	c
shocked	c

7,30	i

it	c
was	i

8.15	c
p.m.	c
!	c

I	c
want	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
ticket	c
.	c

On	i
the	c
advertisement	c
it	c
said	c
that	c
discounts	c
are	i
availble	i
,	c
but	c
when	c
I	c
asked	c
a	c
staff	i
in	c
the	c
theatre	c
about	c
the	c
discount	c
he	c
did	c
n't	c
offer	c
me	c
one	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
disappointed	c
with	c
everything	c
what	i
happened	c
last	c
week	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
a	c
refund	c

Hello	c
Sir	c
,	c

"	c
Um	i
very	c
unpleased	i
that	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
write	c
you	c
this	c
letter	c
.	c

We	c
had	c
a	c
great	c
time	c
together	c
until	c
we	c
decided	c
to	c
visit	c
the	c
musical	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
in	i
the	c
"	c
Circle	c
Theater	i
"	c
.	c

We	c
went	c
there	c
at	c
19.00	c
o'clock	c
to	c
get	c
some	c
tickets	c
,	c
but	c
when	i
we	c
arrived	c
,	c
a	c
long	c
line	c
of	c
people	c
were	c
standing	c
there	c
,	c
waiting	c
to	c
get	c
tickets	c
.	c

One	c
of	c
the	c
points	i
because	i
,	i
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
musical	c
was	c
my	c
favourite	c
actor	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
but	c
he	c
did	c
n't	c
play	i
!	c

So	c
we	c
went	c
upstairs	c
to	c
find	c
the	c
restaurant	c
,	c
but	c
we	c
just	c
a	i
big	c
empty	c
hall	c
,	c
with	c
nothing	c
in	c
it	c
,	c
with	c
a	c
short	i
sign	c
on	c
a	c
door	c
:	c
"	c
Sorry	c
,	c
we	c
are	c
closed	c
because	i
of	i
renovations	c
"	c
!	c

We	c
thought	c
it	c
would	i
be	i
a	c
joke	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
getting	i
my	c
money	c
back	c
,	c
instead	c
of	c
taking	i
a	c
lawyer	c
.	c

Hedwiga	c
Heinkel	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

We	c
,	c
that	c
were	i
Tim	c
,	c
Gudrun	c
,	c
Paul	c
and	c
me	c
Hedwiga	i
had	i
founded	c
our	c
own	c
mafia	c
,	c
we	c
were	c
the	c
kings	c
in	c
our	c
small	c
town	c
,	c
and	c
we	c
had	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
people	c
paying	c
us	c
money	c
,	c
so	c
that	c
we	c
wo	i
n't	i
attack	c
them	c
.	c

We	c
had	c
this	c
idea	c
first	c
,	i
when	c
we	c
watched	c
a	c
movie	c
about	c
the	c
Italian	c
mafia	c
in	c
an	c
English	c
lesson	c
in	c
school	c
.	c

Pat	c
was	c
my	c
big	c
brother	c
,	c
who	c
had	c
heaed	i
of	c
some	c
people	c
paying	c
,	c
"	c
safty-money	i
"	c
,	c
but	c
never	c
know	c
the	c
reason	c
,	c
until	c
he	c
found	c
a	c
big	i
amout	i
of	c
money	c
in	c
my	c
room	c
.	c

His	c
thoughts	i
combined	i
and	c
ready	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
police	c
he	c
went	i
out	i
of	i
our	c
house	c
,	c
where	c
me	c
and	c
my	c
homies	i
were	c
just	c
hanging	c
aroud	i
.	c

He	c
saw	c
me	c
and	c
tolled	i
me	c
into	i
my	c
face	i
you	i
are	c
a	c
thief	c
and	c
a	c
burglar	c
and	c
I	c
will	c
go	i
now	i
to	c
the	c
police	c
,	i
I	c
did	c
n't	c
know	c
what	c
to	c
do	c
,but	c
then	c
I	c
had	c
an	c
idea	c
....	c

Yeah	c
fokes	i
,	c
that	c
was	c
the	c
point	c
I	c
got	c
interupted	i
by	c
my	c
parents	c
in	c
this	c
beautiful	c
dream	c
,	c
but	c
when	i
you	c
will	i
hear	i
the	c
end	c
of	c
my	c
story	c
than	c
buy	c

,	c
net	i
time	i
again	i
,	c
and	c
you	c
will	c
hear	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
this	c
unbelievable	c
story	c
.	c

Dear	c
Ms.	c
Ryan	c
,	c

It	c
was	c
wonderful	i
surprise	c
when	c
I	c
received	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
this	c
great	c
opportunity	c
.	c

Now	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
writing	c
this	c
letter	c
to	c
reply	c
your	i
questions	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
inform	c
you	c
that	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
travel	c
only	c
in	c
July	c
,	c
which	c
is	c
the	c
only	c
month	c
I	c
can	c
take	c
holiday	c
from	c
my	c
work	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
for	c
accomodation	i
,	c
I	c
prefer	c
to	c
say	c
in	c
log	c
cabins	c
,	c
as	c
I	c
have	c
no	c
experience	c
staying	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
,	c
I	c
hesitate	c
to	c
try	c
.	c

Regarding	c
to	i
the	c
activities	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
rather	c
choose	c
singing	c
and	c
painting	c
,	c
as	c
unfortunately	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
not	c
good	c
at	c
sports	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
enjoy	c
singing	c
.	c

I	c
used	c
to	c
join	i
the	c
singing	c
club	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
high	c
school	c
student	c
and	c
once	c
we	c
won	c
the	c
contest	c
,	c
moreover	c
,	c
painting	c
is	c
one	c
of	c
my	c
favorite	i
hobbies	c
.	c

I	c
normally	c
bring	i
blushes	i
,	c
paints	c
and	c
paper	c
instead	c
of	c
camera	i
when	c
I	c
travel	c
.	c

Dear	c

it	c
was	c
a	c

Well	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madamme	i
,	c

By	c
the	c
way	c
,	c
I	c
'm	c
wondering	c
what	c
kinds	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
should	c
prepare	i
and	c
how	c
much	c
much	i
I	c
should	c
bring	c
with	c
myself	i
.	c

I	c
'll	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
answers	c
from	c
you	c

Yours	c

HONG	c

The	c
survey	c
was	c
done	i
to	i
300	c
students	c
,	c
who	c
are	c
between	c
18-28	c
,	c
at	c
our	c
school	c
.	c

The	i
70	c
%	c
of	c
students	c
said	c
that	c
the	c
acting	c
lesson	c
should	c
be	c
filmed	c
as	c
the	c
students	c
,	i
attending	c
this	c
lesson	c
,	c
are	c
not	c
only	c
excited	c
but	c
also	c
very	c
active	c
.	c

Prefered	i
activities	c
.	c

The	c
soccer	c
game	c
,	c
played	c
every	c
Monday	c
,	c
was	c
ranked	c
in	i
the	c
most	c
favorite	i
activity	c
by	c
45	c
%	c
students	i
.	c

However	c
,	c
the	c
girls	i
'd	i
rather	c
play	c
table	c
tennis	c
or	c
badminton	c
.	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
according	c
to	c
the	c
survey	c
,	c
it	c
's	c
obvious	c
that	c
more	c
than	c
half	c
of	c
students	i
want	c
acting	i
lesson	c
to	c
be	c
filmed	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
!	c

We	c
like	c
it	c
very	c
much	c
!	c

But	c
we	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
.	c

We	c
think	c
,	i
that	c
you	c
also	i
would	i
like	c
to	c
go	c
there	c
,	c
when	c
you	i
'll	i
know	i
about	i
it	i
better	i
.	c

There	i
will	i
be	i
showed	i
the	i
latest	i
fashions	i
.	c

If	c
we	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
we	c
will	c
see	c
many	c
hairstyles	c
.	c

Maybe	c
it	c
'll	c
help	c
you	c
choose	c
.	c

Also	c
,	c
you	c
'll	c
be	c
glad	c
to	c
know	c
,	i
that	c
for	c
students	c
it	c
is	c
free	c
!	c

So	c
,	c
we	c
think	c
,	i
that	c
it	c
is	c
very	c
good	c
as	i
for	c
you	c
as	i
for	c
us	c
.	c

On	c
Tuesday	c
morning	c
we	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
show	c
and	c
after	c
that	c
shopping	c
.	c

She	c
liked	c
him	c
very	c
much	c
.	c

I	c
belived	i
everything	c
she	c
has	i
told	i
me	c
.	c

And	c
said	c
just	c
to	i
be	i
careful	c
.	c

But	c
in	i
three	c
days	c
she	c
has	i
n't	i
been	i
at	i
home	c
.	c

She	c
disappeared	c
!	c

But	c
we	c
could	c
n't	c
just	c
sit	c
and	c
wait	c
!	c

In	i
three	c
days	c
of	c
her	i
disappearing	i
the	c
phone	c
has	i
rung	i
.	c

I	c
took	i
the	c
phone	c
.	c

Someone	c
told	c
me	c
if	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
see	c
my	c
friend	c
,	c
I	c
must	c
take	i
5000$	c
and	c
bring	i
them	i
up	i
to	i
the	c
street	c
.	c

There	c
I	c
saw	c
a	c
man	c
and	c
my	c
friend	c
.	c

I	c
surprised	i
that	c
he	c
belived	i
me	c
.	c

I	c
gave	c
him	c
the	c
bag	c
took	i
the	i
friends	i
hand	c
and	c
we	c
run	i
away	c
.	c

After	c
that	c
she	c
told	c
me	c
,	i
that	c
the	c
man	c
was	c
the	c
boy	c
,	i
which	i
she	c
met	i
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs.	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
.	i

It	c
was	c
so	c
great	c
to	c
hear	c
that	c
I	c
had	c
won	c
first	c
prize	c
.	c

It	c
would	c
be	c
meaningful	c
in	c
my	c
life	c
to	c
take	c
part	c
in	c
your	c
camp	c
.	c

I	i
am	i
wondering	i
that	i
I	c
will	c
be	i
only	i
able	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
finish	c
my	c
first	c
year	c
at	c
the	c
university	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
living	i
in	c
tents	c
,	c
I	c
always	i
admire	i
outdoors	i
life	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
I	c
used	c
to	c
play	c
golf	c
with	c
my	c
father	c

It	c
's	c

Now	c

I	c

start	i
there	c
are	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
the	i
people	c
who	c
help	c
the	c

Next	c
time	c
,	c
I	c
hope	c
that	c
we	c
'll	c
work	c
together	c
.	c

Let	c
's	c

some	c
information	c
to	c

Shall	c

I	c

I	c
'm	c

that	c
I	c
've	c

2	c
weeks	c

Camp	c
California	c
in	c

U.S.A.	c
At	c
first	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
belive	i
that	c
I	c

a	c
winer	i

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
at	i
the	c
Camp	c
in	c

if	c

.	c

My	c

in	c
September	c
and	c
it	c

.	c

July	c
is	c
months	i
when	c
I	c
'm	c
having	c
a	c
rest	c
and	c
I	c
'm	c
doing	c
nothing	c
.	c

In	c
August	c
I	c
'm	c
working	c
in	c
the	i
shop	c
which	c
is	c
my	c
sister	i

If	c
I	c

July	c
would	i
be	c
greate	i
.	c

I	c
can	c
sleep	c
in	c
tent	i
,	c
it	c
would	c
remain	i

good	c
time	c
which	c
I	i
'd	i

the	c
chance	c
to	c
do	c
two	c
activities	c
while	c
I	c
'm	c
at	c
the	c
Camp	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c

This	c
is	c
sport	i
which	c
I	c
,,love	c
"	c
.	c

Know	i
,	c
I	c
can	c
just	i
wait	c
for	c
July	c

Hi	c
Kim	c
!	c

How	c
are	c
you	c
?	c

I	c
'm	c
fine	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
so	c
exited	i
.	c

Last	c
month	c
I	c
was	c
helping	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
with	c
a	c
few	c
friends	c
of	c
mine	c
.	c

To	i
this	c
moment	c
when	c
I	i
'm	i
thinking	i
of	c
it	c
I	c
want	c
shout	i
.	c

Anyway	c
,	c
four	c
hours	c
,	i
before	c
concert	i
had	c
started	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
helping	c
with	c
lights	i
.	c

We	c
had	c
to	c
check	c
evey	i
plug	c
,	c
switch	c
,	c
lights	i
.	c

I	c
could	c
n't	c
belive	i
how	c
big	c
the	i
lamp	c
can	c
be	c
.	c

That	c
's	c
why	c
singers	c
are	c
hot	c
.	c

When	c
concert	i
had	c
started	c
and	c
Tina	c
cam	i
out	c
I	c
forget	c
about	c
lights	c
,	c
just	i
I	i
was	i
looking	c
at	c
her	c
.	c

fortunetly	i
nothing	c
had	c
happend	i
.	c

Every-thing	i
was	c
O.K	c

Just	i
people	c
who	c
was	i
helping	c
and	c
organizating	i
this	c
concert	c
could	c
meet	c
her	c
.	c

First	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
doing	i
this	c
competition	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
also	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
the	c
prize	c
.	c

Answering	c
your	c
questions	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
only	c
en	i
July	c
because	c
this	c
is	c
the	c
month	c
of	c
my	c
vacations	i
.	c

I	c
never	i
stayed	i
in	c
tents	i
in	c
the	c
middle	c
of	c
nowhere	c
,	i
in	c
my	c
life	c
so	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
something	c
more	c
realistic	c
and	c
new	c
.	c

Log	c
cabins	c
may	c
be	c
more	c
confortable	i
,	i
on	i
the	c
other	c
hand	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
"	c
survive	c
"	c
in	c
tents	i
.	c

I	c
think	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
Climbing	c
and	c
Painting	c
.	c

The	c
reason	c
of	i
choosing	c
this	i
two	c
activities	c
is	c
that	c
they	c
contrast	c
itselves	i
,	i
I	c
want	c
one	c
more	i
exciting	c
and	c
that	c
asks	c
for	c
more	c
agility	c
and	c
another	c
more	i
calm	i
and	c
relaxing	c
,	c
that	c
asks	c
only	c
for	c
my	c
ability	c
to	c
paint	c
.	c

Painting	c
is	c
something	c
that	c
I	c
love	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
good	c
doing	i
it	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
some	c
doubts	i
about	c
my	c
prize	c
and	c
travel	c
.	c

Is	c
all	i
the	i
travel	i
already	c
paid	c
including	i
food	c
and	c
meals	c
,	c
or	c
I	i
have	c
to	c
bring	c
some	c
money	c
?	c

Please	c
answer	c
my	c
letter	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
is	i
possible	c
.	c

Dear	c

Is	c
everything	c
good	c
in	c
USA	i
?	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
because	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
wonderful	c
experience	c
last	c
month	c
.	c

There	c
was	c
a	c
concert	c
of	i
a	c
famous	c
band	c
here	c
in	c
my	c
city	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
I	c
went	c
with	c
my	c
friend	c
to	c
the	c
concert	c
with	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
fans	c
.	c

The	i
shouted	c
:	c
"	c
20:30	c
you	c
all	c
have	c
to	c
be	c
back	c
because	c
the	c
bus	c
will	c
leave.	c
"	c

We	c
sat	c
and	c
started	c
to	c
eat	c
and	c
talk	c
.	c

The	c
man	c
offered	c
a	i
ride	c
.	c

We	c
accept	i
.	c

You	c
can	i
not	i
imagine	c
how	c
dissapointed	i
I	c
were	i
with	c
my	i
ownself	i
.	c

He	c
asked	c
if	c
we	c
could	c
help	c
.	c

I	c
will	c
never	c
wash	c
my	c
arm	c
again	c
.	c

After	c
all	c
of	c
this	c
we	c
saw	c
the	c
show	c
in	i
the	c
best	c
place	c
,	c
near	c
of	i
the	c
stage	c
and	c
after	i
,	c
the	c
thing	c
that	c
I	c
most	c
liked	c
,	c
we	c
were	c
convidated	i
to	c
see	c
the	c
group	c
and	c
had	i
their	c
signatures	c
.	c

That	c
was	c
the	c
best	c
night	c
of	c
my	c
life	c
.	c

Kisses	c

a	c
two	i
weeks	i

to	c
Camp	c
California	c

About	i
accommodation	c

I	c
think	c
tents	c
would	c
be	c
great	c
.	c

And	c
swimming	c
is	c
very	c
good	c
for	c
health	i

I	c

our	c

Vasiliy	c
Alekseyev	c
.	c

It	c
all	c
started	c
when	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
organizers	c
asked	c
me	c
to	c
help	c
him	c
at	c
a	c
concert	c
of	c
my	c
favorite	i
band	c
.	c

And	c
what	c
do	c
you	c
think	c
I	c
answered	c
?	c

I	c
have	i
got	i
very	c
responsible	i
work	c
I	i
had	c
to	c
bring	c
food	c
for	c
Peter	c
Bolen	c
and	c
Tomas	c
Anders	c
.	c

Can	c
you	c
imagine	c
?	c

I	c
came	i
into	c
their	c
room	c
and	c
give	i
hot	c
Cheeseburgers	c
,	c
Coca-Cola	c
and	c
ice-cream	c
to	c
Peter	c
.	c

He	c
asked	c
me	c
was	i
the	i
cheeseburger	i
hot	i
and	c
I	c
answered	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
nervous	c
talking	c
with	c
him	c
.	c

He	c
told	c
me	c
about	c
concert	i
programme	c
and	c
gave	c
me	c
his	c
photo	c
with	c
a	i
sign	i
.	c

I	c
will	c
never	c
forget	c
that	c
summer	c
day	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
my	c
day	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
sure	c
about	c
it	c
.	c

Well	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
is	c
all	c
.	c

See	c
you	c
.	c

Vasiliy	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
:	c

I	c
have	c
got	c
a	c
few	c
things	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
your	i
theart	i
.	c

The	c
first	c
thing	c
is	c
in	c
your	c
note	c
says	i
that	c
you	c
should	i
have	i
got	i
Danny	c
Brook	c
in	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
so	c
disappointing	i
,	c
because	c
I	c
came	c
far	i
away	c
to	c
see	c
Danny	c
Broke	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
note	c
also	i
says	c
that	c
the	c
show	c
start	i
at	c
19:30	c
,	c
and	c
so	c
I	c
went	c
in	c
at	c
19:25	c
.	c

Note	i
says	c
that	c
tickets	i
has	i
discounts	i
available	i
,	c
but	c
I	c
bought	c
my	c
ticket	c
and	c
your	c
people	c
told	c
me	c
that	c
there	c
is	c
not	i
any	i
discount	c
for	i
thicket	i
.	c

When	c
the	c
show	c
is	i
finished	i
.	i

I	c
deciced	i
to	c
go	c
and	c
visit	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
,	i
But	c
I	c
went	c
there	c
and	c
it	c
is	i
closed	c
for	c
some	c
reasons	i
.	c

The	i
note	i
says	i
that	i
your	i
perfect	i
evening	i
out	i
,	i
I	i
thought	i
I	i
could	i
get	i
my	i
money	i
back	i
,	i
with	i
your	i
poor	i
service	i
and	i
all	i
my	i
reasons	i
,	i
But	i
it	i
was	i
not	i
ask	i
for	i
money	i
back	i
.	c

I	c
was	c
really	c
disappointed	c
about	c
your	c
threat	i
and	c
service	c
,	i
I	c
hope	c
I	c
can	c
get	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
and	c
you	c
can	c
improve	c
it	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
pass	i
,	c
people	c
have	i
to	c
go	c
and	c
get	c
wood	c
,	c
make	c
a	c
fire	c
and	c
cook	c
,	c
but	c
now	c
people	c
can	c
cook	c
in	c
a	c
microwave	c
and	c
do	c
not	c
have	c
to	c
do	c
all	c
the	c
hard	c
work	c
.	c

Science	c
and	c
technology	c
can	c
give	c
us	c
a	c
better	c
live	i
style	i
or	c
better	c
food	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
before	i
people	c
have	i
to	c
walk	c
from	c
a	i
place	c
to	c
the	i
other	i
,	c
but	c
now	c
we	c
can	c
use	c
sciene	i
and	c
technology	c
to	c
produce	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
petrel	i
transport	i
and	c
we	c
can	c
transport	i
with	i
them	i
faster	i
.	c

We	c
also	i
can	i
produce	c
more	c
and	c
better	c
food	c
or	i
using	c
science	c
and	c
technology	c
.	i

e.g.	c
use	i
science	c
to	c
put	c
all	c
the	c
good	c
part	i
of	c
two	c
plants	c
into	c
one	c
plant	c
.	c

We	c
can	c
also	c
use	c
techlogy	i
to	c
produce	c
more	c
food	c
and	c
help	c
them	c
grow	c
faster	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writting	i
to	c
you	c
about	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
disappointed	c
after	c
this	i
show	c
.	c

After	c
your	c
show	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
visit	c
my	c
friends	c
,	c
and	c
because	c
of	c
it	c
,	c
I	c
did	i
n't	i
do	c
it	i
.	c

Also	c
,	c
you	c
wrote	c
about	c
discounts	c
,	c
but	c
it	i
's	i
not	c
true	c
!	c

So	c
,	c
I	c
hope	c
I	c
will	c
get	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
,	i
it	i
was	c
very	i
disappointing	c
evening	c
out	i
in	c
my	c
life	c
!	c

your	i
sincerely	c

Ongelina	c

I	c
have	c
a	c
friend	c
,	c
his	c
name	c
Peter	i
,	c
he	c
is	c
my	c
best	c
friend	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
there	c
,	c
I	c
saw	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
hoped	i
that	c
it	c
,	i
just	i
could	i
see	i
3	i
people	c
,	c
but	c
it	i
was	c
mistake	i
...	c

We	c
spoke	i
with	i
Pat	c
many	c
times	c
to	c
keep	c
this	c
secret	c
,	c
not	c
to	c
tell	c
anyone	c
.	c

We	c
trusted	c
him	c
.	c

At	i
first	c
several	i
days	c
,	c
Pat	c
all	i
the	i
time	i
was	i
with	i
us	i
.	c

So	c
,	c
now	c
my	c
best	c
friend	c
is	c
prisoner	i
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
forget	c
him	c
.	c

He	c
will	c
be	c
in	c
the	i
prison	c
5	i
years	c
.	c

By	c
the	c
way	c
I	i
do	i
n't	i
see	i
Pat	c
about	i
one	c
year	c
.	c

I	c
miss	c
Peter	c
very	c
much	c
,	c
it	c
's	c
unfair	c
to	c
put	c
him	c
in	c
a	c
prison	c
.	c

But	c
it	c
's	c
life	c
,	c
destiny	c
,	c
very	c
cruel	c
destiny	c
...	c

I	c
have	c
read	c
the	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
festival	c
and	c
I	c
must	c
say	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
idea	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
tell	i
you	c
some	c
suggestions	c
.	c

The	c
stars	c
and	c
artist	i
are	c
from	c
only	c
six	c
countries	c
,	c
and	c
some	c
concerts	c
take	c
place	c
in	c
small	c
halls	c
.	c

I	c
find	c
the	c
reasonably-priced	c
ticket	c
excellent	c
,	c
because	c
there	c
is	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
people	c
who	c
went	i
to	c
see	c
only	c
one	c
or	c
two	c
events	c
,	c
and	c
by	c
paying	c
the	i
all	i
events	i
ticket	c
they	i
might	c
see	c
other	c
events	c
and	c
learn	c
about	c
something	c
they	c
did	c
n't	c
expected	i
to	c
find	c
interesting	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
you	c
to	c
answer	c
my	c
letter	c
.	c

Dear	c
John	c
,	c

Here	c
in	c
Brazil	c
the	c
rules	c
at	c
school	c
depends	i
on	c
the	c
school	c
.	c

In	c
general	c
,	c
the	c
rules	c
at	c
private	c
schools	c
are	c
much	c
harder	i
than	c
the	c
ones	c
at	c
state	c
schools	c
.	c

We	c
were	c
allowed	c
to	c
go	c
out	c
if	c
we	c
did	c
n't	c
want	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
class	c
.	c

But	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
use	i
the	c
uniform	c
and	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
study	c
a	c
lot	c
to	c
pass	c
the	c
exams	c
.	c

the	i
rules	c
at	c
home	c
are	c
very	c
different	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
allowed	c
to	c
do	c
what	c
I	c
want	c
as	c
long	c
as	c
I	c
studie	i
enough	c
to	c
aprove	i
.	c

they	i
know	c
that	c
if	c
I	c
go	c
out	c
with	c
the	c
car	c
,	c
I	c
will	c
not	c
drink	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
not	c
allways	i
easy	c
,	c
but	c
there	c
are	c
rules	c
in	c
every	c
home	c
and	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
respect	c
them	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
,	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

I	c
have	i
come	i
to	c
watch	i
the	c
musical	c
show	c
called	c
'	c
Over	c
The	c
Rainbow	c
'	c
in	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
really	c
disappointed	c
because	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
things	c
were	c
not	c
done	c
.	c

I	c
will	c
explain	c
these	c
now	c
and	c
want	c
to	c
ask	c
to	c
get	c
some	i
of	i
the	i
money	i
I	i
have	i
given	i
you	i
back	i
.	c

It	c
was	c
written	i
that	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
were	c
starring	c
in	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

The	c
musical	c
show	c
was	c
going	i
to	c
start	c
at	c
19.30	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
started	c
t	i
20:15	c
.	c

We	c
have	i
waited	i
for	i
45	i
minutes	i
getting	i
bored	i
for	i
it	i
to	i
start	i
!	c

When	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
buy	c
tickets	c
,	c
they	c
did	c
n't	c
accept	i
the	i
discounts	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
had	c
read	c
that	c
the	i
discounts	c
were	c
available	c
.	c

Like	i
it	i
was	i
written	i
again	c
,	c
we	c
went	c
to	c
visit	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

There	c
was	c
nothing	c
for	c
us	c
to	c
do	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
45	c
minutes	c
later	i
.	c

Now	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
you	c
have	c
seen	c
it	i
was	c
not	c
a	c
perfect	c
evening	c
at	c
all	c
,	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
things	i
written	i
were	c
not	c
done	c
So	i
I	c
am	c
asking	c
to	c
get	c
some	c
of	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

DAILY	c
LIFE	c
-	c
MODERN	c
TECHNOLOGY	c

I	c
get	c
up	c
early	c
in	c
the	c
morning	c
,	c
go	c
to	c
school	c
,	c
then	c
come	c
home	c
and	c
do	c
what	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
do	c
.	c

etc	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
I	c
get	c
up	c
whenever	c
I	c
want	c
using	c
my	c
watch	c
or	c
clock	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
not	c
a	c
good	c
example	c
for	i
modern	c
technology	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
's	c
a	c
piece	c
of	c
technology	c
at	c
last	i
!	c

Now	c
it	c
's	c
colourful	i
and	c
there	c
are	c
many	c
channels	c
on	c
TV	c
.	c

You	c
watch	c
whichever	c
you	c
want	c
.	c

I	c
ca	i
n't	i
think	c
that	c
I	c
watch	c
the	c
same	c
channels	c
every	c
day	c
.	c

A	c
wonderful	c
example	c
for	i
modern	c
technology	c
:	c
Computer	i
!	c

It	c
is	c
not	c
a	c
living	c
thing	c
but	c
it	c
has	c
a	c
brain	c
.	c

It	c
knows	c
more	c
than	c
most	c
of	i
the	i
people	c
.	c

You	c
can	c
look	c
for	c
everything	c
you	c
want	c
.	c

You	c
can	c
have	c
information	c
about	c
all	c
the	i
things	c
,	c
go	i
everywhere	c
.	c

Everything	c
is	c
near	c
you	c
.	c

You	c
can	c
reach	i
them	i
whenever	c
you	c
want	c
!	c

You	c
see	c
,	c
our	c
daily	c
life	c
consists	c
of	c
modern	c
technology	c
.	c

It	c
would	c
be	c
hard	c
to	c
live	c
without	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
something	c
about	c
what	c
you	c
asked	c
me	c
in	c
the	c
letter	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
very	c
much	c
like	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
wonderful	c
idea	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
only	c
for	c
few	i
days	c
but	c
not	c
over	c
3	c
days	c
.	c

It	c
will	c
be	c
more	c
comfortable	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
.	c

Regarding	c
with	i
two	c
activities	c
I	i
will	c
choose	c
swimming	c
and	c
photography	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
photography	c
as	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
photographer	c
in	c
a	c
club	c
while	c
I	c
was	c
in	c
the	i
college	c
.	c

Lastly	c
I	c
would	c
particularly	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
about	c
clothes	c
and	c
money	c
.	c

Is	c
n't	c
it	c
cold	c
at	c
night	c
in	c
the	c
Camp	c
California	c
?	c

Could	c
you	c
please	c
tell	c
me	c
about	c
these	c
?	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
your	c
reply	c
.	c

Shin	c
Parade	c

Do	c
you	c
think	c
shopping	c
is	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
?	c

When	c
you	c
do	i
shopping	c
,	c
you	c
can	c
see	c
various	c
products	c
even	i
very	c
extraordinary	c
thing	i
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
it	c
usually	c
take	i
much	i
time	c
to	c
get	c
what	i
you	i
exactly	i
want	c
.	c

Because	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
visit	c
many	c
shops	c
and	c
see	c
many	c
thing	i
.	c

If	c
shopping	i
mall	c
is	c
not	c
collected	i
,	c
it	c
is	c
physically	c
hard	c
to	c
get	c
what	c
you	c
want	c
.	c

It	c
depends	c
on	c
the	c
situation	c
.	c

It	c
even	c
varys	i
with	i
people	i
whom	c
you	c
shop	c
with	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
to	c
make	c
complaints	i
for	i
the	c
very	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
I	c
had	c
at	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
.	c

Then	c
,	c
I	c
not	c
only	c
had	c
to	c
wait	c
45	c
minutes	c
more	c
than	c
it	i
was	i
expected	c
for	c
the	c
beginning	c
of	c
the	c
show	c
but	c
I	c
realised	c
that	c
the	c
main	c
actor	c
had	c
been	c
replaced	c
by	c
another	c
one	i
(	i
very	i
bad	i
)	i
as	c
well	c
.	c

Of	c
course	c
I	c
must	c
tell	c
you	c
that	c
the	c
strongest	i
reason	c
for	c
my	c
going	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
's	c
presence	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
just	i
to	c
find	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
and	c
the	c
friend	c
I	c
had	c
asked	c
to	c
meet	c
me	c
there	c
was	c
not	c
waiting	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

As	c
if	c
that	c
was	c
not	c
enough	c
he	i
thought	c
I	c
had	c
been	c
kidding	c
,	c
inviting	c
him	c
to	c
a	c
closed	c
restaurant	c
where	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
appear	i
.	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

yours	c
faithfully	c

I	c
usually	c
do	c
n't	c
buy	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
them	c
but	c
I	c
must	c
recognise	i
that	c
some	c
of	c
them	c
are	c
useful	c
.	c

I	c
ca	c
n't	c
remember	c
waking	c
up	c
with	i
the	c
alarm-clock	c
,	c
making	c
a	c
hand-made	c
orange	c
juice	c
or	c
heating	c
water	c
for	c
the	c
coffee	c
.	c

The	c
improvement	i
of	c
electronics	c
and	c
global	c
communications	c
has	c
made	c
it	c
possible	c
to	c
know	c
places	c
,	c
look	c
for	c
information	c
or	c
even	c
keep	c
close	i
contact	c
with	c
friends	c
all	c
over	c
the	c
world	c
.	c

Now	c
,	c
I	c
will	c
never	c
say	i
again	i
that	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
where	c
can	i
I	i
find	c
some	c
information	c
about	c
this	c
or	c
that	c
and	c
when	c
on	c
holidays	i
or	c
every	c
time	c
I	c
make	c
a	c
new	c
friend	c
,	c
I	c
just	c
ask	c
for	c
the	i
email	i
and	i
that	c
's	c
enough	c
to	c
know	c
we	c
will	c
know	c
about	c
each	c
other	c
soon	c
.	c

Dear	c
Ms	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
regarding	c
the	c
letter	c
you	c
sent	c
me	c
,	i
about	c
the	c
two	c
weeks	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
that	c
I	c
won	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
2	c
weeks	c
off	c
in	i
the	c
beginning	c
of	c
the	c
month	c
.	c

For	c
the	c
accommodation	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
in	i
tents	i
because	c
I	c
like	c
adventure	c
and	c
simplicity	c
.	c

Concerning	c
the	c
available	c
activities	c
,	c
firstly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
choose	c
climbing	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
practised	i
it	c
for	c
many	c
years	c
.	c

Secondely	i
,	c
I	c
am	c
interested	c
in	c
discovering	i
something	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
done	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
do	c
sailing	c
.	c

I	c
thank	c
you	c
in	i
advanced	i
and	c
looking	i
forward	c
to	c
your	c
reply	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
that	c
I	c
've	c
never	c
had	c
a	i
such	i
good	c
time	c
in	c
my	c
life	c
!	c

The	c
second	c
day	i
objective	c
was	c
to	c
install	c
the	c
scene	i
,	i
with	i
lights	i
,	i
loudspeakers	i
and	i
all	i
stuff	i
.	c

This	c
job	c
was	c
quite	c
hard	c
,	c
but	c
we	c
took	c
enough	i
time	c
to	i
be	i
not	i
exhausted	i
!	c

The	c
last	c
day	c
,	c
in	i
fact	i
the	i
concert	i
day	i
was	i
absolutely	c
fantastic	c
.	c

The	c
public	i
was	c
so	c
excited	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
concert	c
that	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
place	c
some	c
bouncer	i
front	i
of	c
the	c
scene	i
,	i
to	c
avoid	i
the	i
people	c
coming	i
on	i
the	i
concert	i
floor	i
.	c

I	c
hop	i
that	c
the	c
next	c
time	c
you	c
will	c
come	c
with	c
me	c
!	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
your	i
impressions	i
about	c
this	c
!	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
in	i
the	i
name	i
of	i
the	c
whole	c
class	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
very	c
good	c
,	c
especially	c
the	c
Sightseeing	i
tour	c
by	c
bus	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
we	c
have	i
seen	i
an	c
advertisement	c
in	c
yesterday	c
's	c
newspaper	c
for	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
.	c

It	c
takes	c
place	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
March	c
14	c
from	c
10.00	c
to	c
19.00	c
at	c
Central	c
Exhibition	c
Hall	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

There	c
we	c
can	i
see	c
everything	c
about	i
the	c
latest	c
fashions	c
,	c
leisure	c
and	c
sports	c
wear	c
,	c
make	i
up	i
and	c
hairstyles	c
.	c

Instead	c
of	c
going	c
to	c
the	c
Science	c
Museum	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
morning	c
we	i
thought	c
we	c
could	c
postpone	c
it	c
to	c
Wednesday	c
afternoon	c
.	c

The	c
shopping	c
could	c
be	c
done	c
after	c
the	c
river	c
trip	c
to	c
Greenwich	c
but	c
only	c
if	c
we	c
have	c
enough	c
time	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

Will	c
the	c
home	c
of	c
the	c
future	c
really	c
look	c
different	c
?	c

It	c
's	c
quite	c
difficult	c
to	c
say	c
,	c
but	c
of	c
course	c
there	c
will	c
be	c
a	i
change	i
.	c

For	c
example	c
if	i
you	c
look	c
back	c
into	i
the	c
forties	c
and	c
compare	c
the	i
home	i
with	i
nowadays	c
you	i
can	c
see	c
that	c
it	i
has	i
become	c
more	c
modern	c
,	c
especially	c
the	c
facilities	i
in	c
the	c
kitchen	c
and	c
in	c
the	c
livingroom	i
.	c

In	c
addition	c
to	c
this	c
you	i
may	c
have	c
some	c
roboters	i
bringing	c
the	c
newspaper	c
at	i
the	c
table	c
,	c
tidying	c
up	c
the	c
house	c
,	c
doing	i
the	c
shopping	c
and	i
maybe	i
they	c
are	i
also	i
your	c
living	i
patners	i
.	c

The	c
place	c
to	c
spend	c
the	c
night	c
will	c
still	c
be	c
the	c
bed	c
.	c

The	c
livingroom	i
wo	c
n't	c
get	i
any	c
big	c
changes	c
although	i
the	i
televisions	c
,	c
stereos	c
and	c
videos	c
will	c
become	c
more	c
modern	c
and	c
perhaps	c
more	c
difficult	i
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs.	c
Ryan	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
which	i
I	c
have	c
just	c
received	c
this	c
morning	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
really	c
appreciated	i
to	c
hear	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
the	c
competition	c
-	c
two	c
weeks	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
in	c
the	c
U.S.A.	c
I	c
am	c
writing	c
this	c
letter	c
to	c
inform	i
you	c
more	c
information	c
about	c
myself	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
the	i
accommodation	i
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
in	c
tents	c
because	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
nice	c
to	c
spend	c
the	c
time	c
living	c
in	c
tents	c
with	c
a	c
nice	c
environment	c
and	c
fresh	c
air	c
.	c

Photography	c
is	c
quite	c
interesting	c
for	c
me	c
to	i
take	c
a	i
photograph	i
in	c
the	i
place	c
where	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
been	c
to	c
.	i

It	c
is	c
really	c
enjoyable	c
to	c
keep	c
my	c
body	c
fit	c
and	c
healthy	c
by	c
swimming	c
.	c

Anyway	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
that	i
how	c
many	c
people	c
are	c
joining	i
at	i
this	c
Camp	c
.	c

Could	c
you	c
please	c
tell	c
me	c
about	c
the	c
clothes	c
I	c
should	c
take	c
?	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c

Dear	c
Kim	c

I	c
'm	c
really	c
sorry	c
,	i
it	c
's	c
taken	c
me	c
so	c
long	c
to	c
reply	c
.	c

I	c
and	c
my	c
friend	c
-	i
Emma	c
,	i
we	i
helped	c
to	c
paint	c
the	c
scence	i
of	i
the	i
background	i
on	c
the	c
stage	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
known	i
,	c
I	c
like	c
drawing	c
and	c
painting	c
when	c
I	c
have	c
a	i
free	c
time	c
so	c
that	c
why	i
I	c
chose	c
to	c
paint	c
the	c
scence	i
of	i
the	i
background	i
.	c

I	c
really	c
enjoyed	c
painting	c
it	c
and	c
it	c
looked	c
very	c
nice	c
.	c

And	c
I	c
particularly	c
liked	c
the	c
experience	c
that	i
I	i
helped	i
to	c
screen	i
and	c
paint	c
a	c
picture	c
of	c
"	c
Bon	c
Jovi	c
"	c
on	c
every	c
T-shirts	i
which	c
are	i
given	c
to	c
the	c
audiences	i
.	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
told	c
my	c
teacher	c
that	c
I	c
am	c
willing	c
to	c
give	i
a	i
hand	i
next	c
time	c
.	c

Are	c
you	c
willing	c
to	c
give	i
a	i
hand	i
next	c
time	c
?	c

If	c
you	c
are	c
,	c
I	c
'll	c
tell	c
you	c
in	i
advance	c
.	c

Best	c
wishes	c

Dear	c
Sir	c

Madam	c

Ref	c
:	c
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
musical	c
show	c
.	c

It	c
did	c
n't	c
start	c
at	c
19:30	c
and	c
there	c
was	c
a	c
delay	c
for	c
45	c
minutes	c
which	c
was	c
quite	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
and	c
everyone	c
got	c
frustrated	c
.	c

Moreover	c
the	i
testament	i
was	c
till	i
under	c
the	i
construction	c
so	c
that	c
we	c
could	c
n't	c
use	c
it	c
when	c
we	c
were	c
extlemely	i
hungry	c
.	c

Finally	i
,	i
I	i
wonder	i
why	i
you	i
did	i
n't	i
ask	i
for	i
the	i
money	i
back	i
if	i
you	i
have	i
guaranteed	i
the	i
perfect	i
evening	i
.	i

I	c
am	c
therefore	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
to	c
ask	c
for	c
the	c
money	c
back	c
as	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
get	c
any	c
advantages	c
or	c
services	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

One	c
of	c
the	c
biggist	i
thing	i
has	i
changed	c
is	c
a	i
change	c
in	c
a	i
method	i
of	c
communications	i
.	c

There	c
are	c
also	c
changes	c
in	c
biological	c
areas	c
.	c

Nearly	i
almost	i
of	i
the	i
disease	i
have	i
been	i
found	i
the	i
way	i
to	i
cure	i
except	c
only	i
a	c
few	c
like	c
AIDS	c
.	c

It	c
helped	c
us	c
to	c
live	c
longer	c
and	c
make	c
us	c
stronger	c
against	c
them	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
mentioned	c
few	i
changes	c
above	c
but	c
there	c
's	c
still	c
a	i
biggist	i
one	c
left	c
which	i
is	c
about	i
computer	i
areas	i
.	c

But	c
we	c
still	c
have	c
to	c
admit	c
that	c
we	c
ca	c
n't	c
live	c
without	c
them	c
even	c
they	i
give	c
us	c
some	c
disadvantages	c

Dear	c
Ms	c
Ryan	c
,	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
answer	c
your	c
questions	c
.	c

As	c
I	c
am	c
doing	c
my	c
A-levels	i
exams	c
at	c
the	c
moment	c
and	c
they	c
continue	c
until	c
the	c
30th	c
of	c
June	c
and	c
my	c
further	c
studies	c
start	c
in	c
August	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
only	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
.	c

It	c
will	c
give	c
me	c
an	i
adventure	i
feeling	i
and	c
I	c
have	c
always	c
prefered	i
tents	c
to	c
log	c
cabins	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
in	c
advance	c
for	c
your	c
help	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
receiving	c
your	c
prompt	c
reply	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

Hi	c
,	c
how	c
are	c
you	c
?	c

I	c
'm	c
actually	c
fine	c
at	c
the	c
moment	c
,	c
but	c
have	c
to	c
study	c
a	c
lot	c
because	c
of	c
my	c
exams	c
in	c
English	c
.	c

You	c
asked	c
me	c
to	c
wite	i
about	c
my	i
experience	c
which	c
I	c
made	i
by	i
helping	c
at	c
the	c
pop-concert	c
.	c

And	c
I	c
can	c
say	c
it	c
was	c
terrific	c
!	c

My	c
job	c
was	c
actually	c
to	c
listen	c
to	c
Tim	c
and	c
do	c
whatever	c
he	c
said	c
.	c

This	c
included	c
to	i
clean	i
up	c
the	c
rooms	c
which	c
were	c
used	c
by	c
the	c
singers	c
and	c
put	i
some	c
equipment	c
on	c
the	c
stage	c
.	c

Tim	c
was	c
in	c
charge	c
of	c
organising	c
this	c
concert	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
never	c
been	c
behind	c
the	c
stage	c
before	c
and	c
you	c
know	c
the	c
rooms	c
,	c
in	c
which	c
singers	c
dress	c
and	c
make-up	i
,	c
are	c
actually	c
small	c
.	c

Can	c
you	c
imagine	c
,	c
I	c
could	c
stay	i
at	c
this	c
concert	c
without	c
paying	c
anything	c
!	c

And	c
I	c
managed	c
to	c
speak	c
to	c
Ricky	c
Martin	c
out	i
of	i
stage	i
.	c

I	c
think	c
this	c
was	c
my	c
best	c
job	c
as	c
a	c
student	c
in	c
Cambridge	c
.	c

Probably	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
so	c
nice	c
to	c
do	c
jobs	c
which	c
you	c
were	c
told	c
to	c
do	c
,	c
but	c
you	c
see	i
many	c
stars	c
out	i
of	i
stage	i
.	c

And	c
you	c
might	i
manage	i
to	c
speak	c
to	c
some	c
pop-stars	c
.	c

Beside	c
this	c
,	c
I	c
earned	c
some	c
money	c
,	i
not	c
a	c
lot	c
but	c
enough	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

Give	c
my	c
regards	c
to	c
your	c
parents	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sirs	c
,	c

When	c
we	c
arrived	c
at	c
the	c
theatre	c
we	c
had	i
to	i
realise	i
that	c
there	c
were	c
no	c
discountable	i
tickets	c
available	c
as	c
mentioned	i
in	c
your	c
advertisment	i
so	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
buy	c
the	c
most	c
expensive	c
ones	c
.	c

To	i
make	i
the	i
matters	i
worse	i
Danny	c
Brook	c
who	i
was	c
announced	i
as	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
starring	c
person	i
in	c
the	c
musical	c
was	i
not	c
acting	c
this	c
evening	c
.	c

You	c
can	c
imagine	c
how	c
disappointed	c
we	c
were	c
especially	i
the	i
acting	i
of	i
Danny	i
Brook	i
was	c
the	c
main	c
reason	c
for	i
us	i
to	i
see	c
the	c
musical	c
.	c

On	c
top	c
of	c
this	c
we	c
intend	i
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
which	i
was	c
closed	c
because	c
of	c
building	c
activities	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
can	c
imagine	c
we	c
were	c
very	c
disappointed	c
and	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
a	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
I	i
would	c
like	c
to	c
have	c
50	c
%	c
of	c
the	c
prize	i
of	c
the	c
tickets	c
back	c

Fashion	c
will	c
always	c
be	c
an	c
interesting	c
and	c
important	c
subject	c
for	c
all	c
ages	c

In	c
the	c
next	c
100	c
years	c
there	c
will	c
be	c
no	c
change	c
in	c
that	c
but	c
the	i
fashion	c
is	c
going	c
to	c
develop	c
in	c
a	c
special	c
imaginative	c
way	c

There	c
are	c

whereas	c
on	c
the	c

the	c

more	c
and	c
more	c
syntetical	i
clothes	i

which	c

In	c
100	c
years	c
most	c
of	i
the	i
clothes	c
are	i
made	c
from	c
syntetical	i
material	c
.	c

Light	c
and	c
bright	c
colours	c
will	c
be	c
very	c
common	c

Especially	i
contrast	i
will	i
be	i

Furthermore	c
the	c
style	c
of	c
the	c
clothes	c
are	i
going	c
to	c
be	c
more	c
crazy	c
and	c

but	c
there	c
will	c
be	i
still	i
enumerous	i
clothes	c
for	c
the	i

One	i

in	c
100	c

I	c
could	c
find	c
the	c
opportunity	c
to	c
watch	c
the	i
artists	c
from	c
different	c
countries	c
,	c
but	c
there	c
could	c
have	c
been	c
stars	c
from	c
more	c
than	c
6	c
countries	c
.	c

The	c
jazz	c
,	c
classical	c
and	c
rock	c
concerts	c
were	c
great	c
despite	c
some	c
of	c
the	c
concert	c
halls	c
were	i
too	c
small	c
.	c

Plays	i
and	c
films	c
I	c
watched	c
were	c
also	c
excellent	c
,	c
but	c
more	c
could	c
be	c
on	c
the	c
stage	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

The	c
dance	c
shows	c
made	i
sight	i
for	c
our	c
sour	i
eyes	c
,	i
they	c
were	c
really	c
fascinating	c
.	c

I	c
learned	c
so	c
many	c
things	c
about	c
the	c
writers	c
and	c
their	c
ideas	c
,	c
their	i
life	i
styles	i
by	i
talking	c
to	c
them	c
.	c

Beyond	i
all	c
these	i
,	c
the	c
application	i
of	c
joining	c
all	i
activities	i
by	i
one	c
nice-priced	i
ticket	c
was	c
excellent	c
;	i
because	c
it	c
saved	c
you	c
from	c
buying	i
one	c
ticket	c
for	c
each	c
activity	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
making	i
a	c
great	c
festival	c
which	c
made	c
all	c
the	c
art	i
activities	c
come	c
together	c
.	c

Yours	c
Sincerely	i
,	c

Dear	c
Jennifer	c
,	c

I	c
'm	c
glad	c
that	c
everything	c
's	c
going	c
on	c
well	c
there	c
.	c

By	c
the	c
way	c
,	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
better	c
If	i
you	c
wrote	c
quite	i
often	i
to	i
me	i
.	c

The	c
things	c
you	c
wrote	c
about	c
the	c
rules	c
made	c
me	c
think	c
for	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
and	c
I	c
understood	c
that	c
some	c
really	c
do	c
n't	c
make	c
any	c
sense	c
!	c

Our	c
school	c
is	c
really	c
very	c
diciplined	i
,	c
especially	c
about	c
our	c
clothes	c
and	c
behaviours	i
.	c

I	c
understand	c
the	c
second	c
part	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
get	i
the	c
reason	c
of	i
wearing	i
in	i
white	i
an	i
dark	i
blue	i
only	i
.	c

Do	c
we	c
become	c
the	c
"	c
perfect	c
one	c
"	c
then	c
?	c

I	c
'm	c
allowed	c
to	c
do	c
whatever	c
I	c
want	c
at	i
my	c
room	c
.	c

I	c
ca	c
n't	c
go	c
out	c
at	c
nights	c
easily	c
,	c
but	c
that	c
is	c
not	c
something	c
that	c
I	c
mind	c
about	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
I	c
show	c
these	c
three	c
to	c
them	c
.	c

Love	c
,	c

I	c
have	c
just	c
received	c
your	c
letter	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
writing	c
in	i
response	i
of	i
your	c
questions	c
.	c

I	c
can	c
travel	c
only	c
in	c
july	i
because	c
is	i
the	c
only	c
month	c
of	i
this	c
year	c
that	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
available	c
because	i
I	c
finish	c
school	c
in	c
june	i
so	i
I	c
will	c
be	c
very	c
busy	c
and	i
in	c
August	c
I	c
start	c
to	c
study	c
at	c
the	i
University	c
,	c
so	c
july	i
is	c
the	c
best	c
month	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
travel	c
.	c

Accommodation	c
for	c
me	c
is	c
not	c
problem	i
.	c

But	c
if	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
choose	c
,	c
I	c
prefer	c
sleep	i
in	c
tents	c
,	c
because	c
when	c
I	c
travel	c
I	c
usually	c
sleep	c
in	c
that	c
kind	c
of	c
accommodation	c
so	c
,	c
for	c
me	c
they	c
seem	c
very	c
comfortable	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
do	c
the	c
following	c
activities	c
:	c

-	c
Tennis	c
because	c
is	i
my	c
favourite	c
sport	c
and	c
I	c
enjoy	c
playing	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
play	i
tennis	c
since	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
child	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
some	c
competitions	c
in	c
my	c
town	c
so	c
I	c
think	c
I	c
play	c
very	c
well	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
a	c
terrible	c
climber	c
but	c
with	c
a	c
little	c
bit	c
of	c
help	c
I	c
think	c
I	c
can	c
enjoy	c
the	c
activity	c
and	c
have	c
a	c
good	c
time	c
unforgettable	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hear	i
from	c
you	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

I	c
have	c
a	c
friend	c
and	c
she	c
knows	c
that	c
I	c
speak	c
English	c
so	i
she	c
offered	c
to	i
me	c
work	c
with	c
an	c
English	c
singer	c
so	i
I	c
said	i
"	i
yes	i
,	i
of	c
course	c
"	c
.	c

But	c
you	c
ca	c
n't	c
imagine	c
who	c
was	i
the	i
singer	i
,	i
it	i
was	c
Sting	c
,	i
can	i
you	c
imagine	c
?	c

You	c
know	c
,	c
he	c
is	c
my	c
favourite	c
singer	c
.	c

I	c
understood	c
everything	c
he	c
said	c
and	c
Sting	c
said	c
to	c
me	c
that	c
I	c
spoken	i
very	i
well	i
English	i
.	c

The	c
best	c
thing	c
was	c
I	c
spoke	c
in	c
English	c
because	i
I	i
was	i
forgetting	i
it	i
and	c
I	c
met	c
my	c
favourite	c
singer	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
my	c
friend	c
call	i
me	c
again	c
to	c
work	c
because	i
I	c
had	c
a	c
wonderful	c
time	c
and	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
great	c
and	c
unforgettable	c
experience	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
are	c
O.K.	c
and	c
write	c
soon	c
.	c

Lots	c
of	c
Love	c

This	c
was	c
very	c
disappointing	c
and	c
I	c
believe	c
that	c
all	c
the	c
people	c
there	c
,	i
were	c
angry	c
.	c

Also	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
and	c
I	c
do	c
not	c
know	c
why	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
read	c
the	c
advertisement	c
,	c
it	c
said	c
that	c
the	c
restaurand	i
would	c
be	c
opened	i
.	c

Lastly	c
,	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
that	c
I	c
had	i
not	c
a	i
perfect	c
evening	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
be	c
grateful	c
if	c
you	c
could	i
send	c
me	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
not	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

Pat	c
was	c
my	c
best	c
friend	c
.	c

One	c
day	c
I	c
heard	c
my	c
mother	c
to	i
tell	i
my	c
father	c
that	c
she	c
want	i
to	c
divorce	c
because	c
she	c
ca	i
n't	i
live	c
with	c
him	c
any	c
more	c
.	c

I	c
called	c
Pat	c
to	c
come	c
to	c
my	c
house	c
because	c
I	c
was	c
not	c
very	c
good	i
and	c
to	i
tell	c
her	c
what	c
had	c
happened	c
.	c

Few	i
minutes	c
later	c
Pat	c
came	c
to	c
my	c
house	c
and	c
I	c
told	c
her	c
that	c
my	c
parents	c
are	i
going	c
to	c
divorce	c
.	c

Pat	c
did	c
not	c
believe	c
me	c
and	c
she	c
started	i
to	i
ask	i
why	c
.	c

But	c
before	c
she	c
left	c
I	i
begged	c
her	c
not	c
to	c
tell	c
anybody	c
.	c

The	c
other	i
morning	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
school	c
and	c
all	c
the	c
students	c
came	c
next	i
to	c
me	c
and	c
told	c
me	c
not	c
to	c
be	c
mad	i
because	c
of	c
my	c
parents	c
.	c

Then	c
I	c
realised	c
that	c
Pat	c
told	c
my	i
secret	c
and	c
I	c
felt	c
very	c
angry	c
,	c
that	c
's	c
why	c
I	c
said	c
at	c
the	c
beginning	c
that	c
Pat	c
was	c
not	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr.	c
Robertson	c
,	c

We	c
are	c
very	c
grateful	c
to	c
you	c
for	c
these	c
three	c
days	c
that	c
we	c
are	c
going	c
to	c
spend	c
in	c
the	c
English	c
capital	c
,	c
especially	c
because	c
you	c
planned	i
very	c
interesting	c
and	c
different	c
kinds	c
of	c
things	c
to	i
do	i
for	i
all	i
us	i
.	c

It	c
is	c
a	c
very	c
good	c
chance	c
to	c
join	i
this	c
exhibition	c
to	c
see	c
all	c
the	c
new	c
fashion	i
tendences	i
,	c
the	c
latest	c
hairstyles	c
and	c
make	i
up	i
as	c
all	c
we	i
came	i
from	c
many	c
different	c
countries	c
and	c
have	i
not	i
the	c
same	c
customs	c
either	i
.	c

And	c
another	c
important	c
thing	c
to	c
consider	c
is	c
that	c
for	c
the	c
students	c
the	c
tickets	c
are	c
free	c
.	c

As	c
the	c
show	c
is	c
held	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
from	c
10:00	c
to	c
19:00	c
we	c
could	c
go	c
there	c
instead	c
of	c
doing	i
shopping	c
in	c
the	c
afternoon	c
.	c

Do	c
famous	c
people	c
,	c
such	c
as	c
politicians	c
and	c
film	c
stars	c
,	c
deserve	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
private	c
life	c
without	c
journalists	c
following	c
them	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
?	c

They	c
are	c
human	c
beings	c
actually	i
and	c
they	c
need	c
to	c
keep	c
a	c
little	c
bit	c
of	c
pirvacity	i
and	c
freedom	c
in	c
their	c
lifes	i
to	c
continue	c
like	c
normal	c
people	c
,	c
to	c
feel	c
that	c
they	c
are	c
unknown	c
and	c
anonymus	i
and	c
they	c
do	c
not	c
have	c
to	c
wear	c
sunglasses	c
,	c
hats	c
or	c
caps	c
every	c
time	c
they	c
want	c
to	c
go	i
out	i
home	c
not	i
to	c
be	c
recognised.	c
.	i

So	c
they	c
need	c
to	c
become	c
famous	c
to	c
be	c
what	c
they	c
want	c
and	c
if	c
the	c
people	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
them	c
,	c
they	c
are	c
forgotten	c
,	c
they	c
die	c
...	c

What	c
I	c
thought	c
it	i
was	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
a	c
wonderful	c
night	c
became	c
into	i
the	c
worst	c
night	c
at	c
the	c
theatre	c
I	c
've	c
ever	c
had	c
.	c

This	c
is	c
because	c
I	c
had	c
been	c
waiting	c
to	c
enjoy	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
's	c
performance	c
since	c
I	c
saw	c
him	c
the	c
first	c
time	c
on	c
television	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
despite	c
of	i
your	c
advertisement	i
of	i
the	c
possibility	c
of	c
discounts	c
,	c
when	c
I	c
showed	c
my	c
student	c
identity	c
card	c
to	c
one	c
of	c
your	c
employes	i
she	c
angrily	c
told	c
me	c
that	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
pay	c
the	c
whole	i
prize	i
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
at	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
the	c
night	c
we	c
felt	c
a	c
bit	c
hungry	c
but	c
we	c
could	c
n't	c
eat	c
until	c
arriving	i
home	c
due	c
to	c
your	c
restaurant	i
new	c
cooker	i
illness	i
.	c

I	c
wait	c
to	c
receiving	i
a	c
prompt	c
answer	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
always	c
thought	c
that	c
I	c
could	c
rely	c
on	c
her	c
whatever	c
my	c
problem	c
was	c
.	c

Yet	c
,	c
one	c
extremly	i
hot	c
day	c
while	c
I	c
was	c
pacefully	i
walking	c
by	c
the	c
sea	c
and	c
thinking	c
about	c
my	c
own	c
problems	c
I	i
discovered	c
my	c
elder	c
brother	c
's	c
girlfriend	c
with	c
another	c
boy	c
.	c

At	c
first	c
I	c
felt	c
really	c
annoyed	c
and	c
disappointed	c
so	c
I	c
run	i
to	c
my	c
brother	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
explain	i
him	c
what	c
I	c
had	c
seen	c
.	c

But	c
the	c
thing	c
is	c
I	c
needed	c
to	c
speak	c
to	c
someone	c
about	c
the	i
fact	i
so	c
I	c
could	c
feel	c
more	c
relaxed	c
.	c

I	c
did	c
n't	c
know	c
who	c
explain	i
it	i
to	i
but	c
actually	i
I	c
decided	c
that	c
if	c
I	c
needed	c
to	c
tell	c
someone	c
a	c
secret	c
I	c
would	i
trust	c
an	i
my	c
best	c
friend	c
Pat	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
the	c
next	c
day	c
,	c
I	c
nervously	c
came	c
to	c
Pat	c
's	c
appartment	i
where	c
she	c
had	c
been	c
living	c
on	c
her	c
own	c
since	c
she	c
was	c
eighteen	c
.	c

After	c
that	c
,	c
she	c
felt	c
completely	i
sad	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
love	c
she	c
had	c
been	c
feeling	c
for	c
my	c
brother	c
for	c
several	c
years	c
and	c
she	c
swore	c
me	i
that	c
she	c
was	c
going	c
to	c
tell	i
it	i
to	i
nobody	i
.	c

However	c
,	c
the	c
truth	c
was	c
that	c
not	i
sooner	c
had	c
I	c
arrived	c
home	c
than	c
my	c
brother	c
asked	c
me	c
crying	i
why	i
I	c
had	c
told	i
his	i
girlfriend	i
's	i
affair	i
to	i
Pat	i
instead	c
of	c
discovering	i
him	i
the	i
truth	i
.	c

I	c
was	c
really	c
glad	c
to	c
receive	c
your	c
letter	c
and	c
find	c
out	c
that	c
I	c
won	c
the	c
competition	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
this	c
letter	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
all	c
the	c
necessary	c
details	c
.	c

Actually	c
,	c
I	c
could	c
only	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
,	c
when	c
I	c
am	i
having	i
my	c
school	c
vacations	i
and	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
totally	c
free	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
have	c
asked	c
me	c
about	c
the	c
accommodation	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
be	c
grateful	c
if	c
I	c
could	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
-	c
as	c
it	c
seems	c
to	c
be	c
more	c
practical	c
and	c
comfortable	c
.	c

Among	i
the	c
activities	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
choose	c
painting	c
-	c
which	c
I	c
am	c
keen	c
on	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
done	c
several	c
courses	c
-	c
,and	i
Photography	c
-	c
from	i
which	c
I	c
know	c
just	c
the	c
basical	i
skills	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c

With	c
the	c
increasing	i
of	i
violence	c
,	c
more	c
and	c
more	c
people	c
are	c
leaving	c
the	c
streets	c
to	c
spend	c
their	c
free	c
time	c
shopping	c
-	c
usually	c
in	c
shopping	c
centres	c
.	c

But	c
it	c
can	c
also	c
be	c
dangerous	c
.	c

First	c
,	c
most	c
part	i
of	i
shoping	i
centres	c
uses	i
artificial	c
illumination	c
and	c
refiguration	i
,	c
which	c
are	c
bad	c
for	c
our	c
health	c
.	c

Queues	c
and	c
lots	c
of	c
people	c
going	c
round	c
can	c
be	c
stressful	c
and	c
tiring	c
.	c

There	c
are	c
cases	c
of	c
people	c
that	c
can	i
not	i
spend	c
one	c
day	c
without	c
buying	c
anything	c
.	c

Last	c
week	c
I	c
stayed	i
in	i
London	c
for	c
holidays	i
.	c

During	c
my	c
stay	c
in	c
that	c
beautiful	c
city	c
,	c
I	c
thought	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
good	c
idea	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
to	c
enjoy	c
a	c
Musical	c
show	i
,	c
so	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
your	c
theatre	c
to	c
see	c
"	c
over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
very	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
not	c
just	c
for	c
me	c
but	c
for	c
most	c
of	c
the	c
people	c
who	c
was	i
in	c
the	c
theatre	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
show	c
I	c
also	c
read	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
going	c
to	c
begin	c
at	c
half	c
past	c
seven	c
p.m.	c
but	c
,	c
in	i
fact	i
,	c
it	c
began	c
at	c
eight	c
fifteen	c
.	c

I	c
also	c
,	i
found	c
out	c
that	c
no	c
discounts	c
were	c
available	c
.	c

At	i
it	c
was	c
so	c
beautiful	c
,	c
we	c
decided	c
to	c
come	i
back	c
to	c
the	c
beach	c
at	c
night	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
moon	c
,	c
the	c
see	i
and	c
the	c
stars	c
.	c

In	c
order	c
to	c
see	c
it	c
,	c
we	c
got	c
closer	c
to	c
them	c
and	c
,	c
at	i
the	c
end	c
,	c
we	c
saw	c
that	c
they	c
had	c
robbed	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
money	c
and	c
they	c
were	c
trying	c
to	c
put	c
it	c
in	c
a	c
safe	c
place	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
Pat	c
explained	i
the	c
story	c
to	c
a	c
friend	c
of	c
us	i
and	c
I	i
do	c
n't	c
know	c
how	c
,	c
but	c
the	c
robbers	c
knew	c
that	c
we	c
had	c
seen	c
all	c
they	c
had	c
been	c
doing	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Jones	c
,	c

I	c
'm	c
writting	i
this	c
letter	c
to	c
inform	c
you	c
about	c
the	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
I	c
had	c
when	c
I	c
visited	c
the	c
Circle	c
theatre	i
.	c

Firstly	c
In	i
the	c
advertisement	c
you	c
said	c
that	c
the	c
actor	c
would	c
be	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
but	c
there	c
was	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
in	c
the	c
show	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
really	c
disappointed	c
,	i
because	c
I	c
was	c
really	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
seeing	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
which	i
I	c
personally	c
admire	c
.	c

Secondly	c
the	c
play	c
did	c
n't	c
start	c
at	c
19:30	c
as	c
we	c
were	c
being	i
told	i
but	c
it	c
started	c
with	i
a	c
delay	c
of	c
45	c
minutes	c
.	c

Also	c
when	c
I	c
visited	c
the	c
theatre	c
's	c
restaurant	c
I	c
found	c
it	c
closed	c
because	i
of	i
renovation	c
.	c

All	c
the	c
above	c
made	c
my	c
night	c
terribly	c
disappointing	c
and	c
I	c
must	c
say	c
that	c
the	c
advertisement	c
is	c
nothing	c
but	c
a	c
business	c
fraud	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
'm	c
in	c
the	c
unpleasant	c
position	c
to	i
ask	i
my	i
money	c
back	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Mrs	c
Lemmings	c
.	i

It	c
's	c
something	c
absoletuly	i
necessary	c
for	c
every	c
action	c
people	c
does	i
It	i
effects	i
us	c
both	c
positive	i
and	c
negative	i
.	c

It	c
's	c
a	c
part	c
of	c
our	c
lifes	i
.	c

Firstly	c
technology	c
has	c
created	c
a	c
bond	c
between	c
myself	c
and	c
my	c
computer	c
.	c

I	i
got	i
used	c
to	c
spending	c
2-3	c
hours	c
in	c
front	c
of	c
the	c
computer	c
.	c

I	c
've	c
end	i
up	c
being	c
a	c
T.V	i
addict	c

Why	c
going	i
to	c
the	c
countryside	c
if	c
you	c
can	c
sit	c
there	c
with	c
a	c
bowl	c
of	c
popcorns	i
and	c
watch	c
T.V	i
.	i

Air	i
conditions	i
,	c
watches	c
,	c
computers	c
,	c
and	c
many	c
other	c
things	c
have	c
made	c
my	c
life	c
easier	c
.	c

There	c
's	c
no	c
need	c
on	i
going	i
to	c
the	c
shops	c
when	c
I	c
can	c
order	c
things	c
by	i
the	c
computer	c
.	c

Air	i
conditions	i
also	c
makes	c
my	c
life	c
easier	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
technology	c
is	c
the	c
least	i
thing	c
I	c
could	c
use	c
in	c
my	c
life	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr.	c
Robertson	c
:	i

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
you	i
representing	i
all	c
the	c
english	i
class	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
let	c
you	c
know	c
how	c
exciting	i
we	c
are	c
about	c
the	c
trip	c
to	c
London	c
and	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
some	c
ideas	c
of	c
other	c
things	c
we	c
are	c
interresting	i
on	i
doing	c
in	c
London	c
while	c
we	c
're	c
there	c
.	c

But	c
also	c
we	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
visit	c
The	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
show	i
that	c
will	c
be	c
held	c
at	c
the	c
Central	c
kExhibition	i
hall	i
on	c
Tuesday	c
March	c
14	c
from	c
10:00	c
-	c
19:00	c
.	c

faithfully	i
yours	i

IT	c
WAS	c
DANGEROUS	c
,	c
BUT	c
I	c
KNEW	c
I	c
HAD	c
TO	c
DO	c
IT	c
.	c

.	c
.	c

Since	i
always	i
I	i
'd	i
gotten	i
the	i
idea	i
of	i
travel	i
abroad	c
and	c
experiece	i
others	i
people	c
's	c
life	i
and	c
cultures	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
Paris	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
I	c
finished	c
university	c
.	c

I	c
arrived	c
in	c
Paris	c
for	i
New	c
Years	i
Eve	c
2000	c
without	c
a	c
place	c
to	c
stay	c
,	c
not	c
speaking	c
any	c
French	c
,	c
alone	c
and	c
with	c
a	c
little	i
amount	c
of	c
money	c
.	c

But	c
eventhough	i
all	c
of	c
these	c
desadventages	i
above	i
,	c
I	c
was	c
folling	i
my	c
dreams	c
and	c
objectives	c
and	c
inspite	i
of	c
everything	c
I	c
was	c
going	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
.	c

So	c
suddenly	c
,	c
a	c
week	c
later	c
I	c
found	c
me	i
a	c
job	c
as	c
an	c
au	c
pair	c
,	c
taking	c
care	c
of	c
two	c
little	c
girls	c
that	c
only	c
spoke	c
french	i
at	c
that	c
moment	i
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
a	c
foreign	c
student	c
who	c
is	c
on	c
holidays	i
here	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
we	c
had	i
n't	i
any	c
disscount	i
for	c
beeing	i
students	c
.	c

On	i
the	i
other	i
hand	i
,	c
the	c
main	c
actor	c
was	c
changed	c
for	c
another	c
and	c
nobody	c
told	c
us	c
.	c

When	c
there	c
was	c
a	i
restful	i
we	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
restaurant	c
which	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
late	c
.	c

Well	c
I	c
believe	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
bad	c
day	c
but	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
you	c
to	c
give	c
my	i
money	c
back	c
because	c
on	i
the	c
advertisement	c
there	c
was	i
some	c
things	c
that	c
we	c
had	i
n't	i
in	i
the	c
theatre	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
it	i
would	c
be	c
grateful	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
answer	c
me	c
soon	c
.	c

Yous	i
sincerelly	i
,	c

When	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
child	c
I	c
had	c
different	c
entertainments	i
that	i
the	i
actually	i
children	c
had	i
n't	i
.	c

The	c
technology	c
is	c
growing	c
and	c
growing	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
have	c
a	c
computer	c
you	c
will	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
have	c
all	c
the	c
information	c
that	c
you	c
want	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
very	c
important	c
but	c
some	i
times	i
it	c
is	c
a	c
wrong	i
thing	c
because	c
the	c
children	c
can	c
see	c
it	c
too	c
.	c

We	c
can	c
find	c
information	c
about	c
the	c
weather	c
,	i
sports	c
on	c
our	c
TV-text	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
the	i
science	c
is	c
changing	c
.	c

We	c
have	c
more	c
researchers	c
than	c
some	i
years	c
ago	c
and	c
we	c
will	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
find	c
the	c
solution	c
of	i
lots	c
of	c
problems	c
.	c

Actually	c
,	c
we	c
can	c
cure	c
illness	i
which	c
were	c
very	i
dangerous	i
before	i
.	c

I	c
'm	c
sure	c
that	c
in	c
a	c
couple	c
of	c
years	c
we	c
will	c
see	c
cured	i
some	i
illness	i
like	i
cancer	i
,	i
UTH	i
.	c

The	c
new	c
technology	c
is	c
changing	c
our	c
lives	c
.	c

Dear	c
sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

I	c
was	c
one	c
of	c
your	c
customers	c
who	c
had	c
a	c
very	c
disappointing	c
about	i
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
show	i
at	c
your	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
yesterday	c
.	c

The	c
only	c
one	i
reason	c
I	c
bought	c
your	i
ticket	c
was	c
because	c
of	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Trulove	c
,	c
as	i
your	i
advertisement	i
had	i
shown	i
.	c

But	c
your	c
starrings	i
were	c
not	c
.	i

And	c
also	c
the	c
ticket	c
discounts	c
were	c
not	c
available	c
.	c

From	i
every	i
singular	i
things	i
I	i
have	i
complained	i
,	i
it	i
was	c
totally	c
different	c
from	c
what	c
your	c
advertisment	i
said	c
.	c

And	c
because	c
of	c
this	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
for	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

My	c
telephone	c
number	c
is	c
123-4567	c
.	c

Thesedays	i
we	c
are	c
living	c
on	i
a	c
high-technology	c
world	c
.	c

Modern	c
technology	c
has	c
been	c
growing	i
rapidly	c
and	c
it	c
has	c
effected	i
me	c
a	c
lot	c
.	c

Anyway	c
,	c
modern	c
technology	c
such	c
as	c
the	c
Internet	c
changes	i
me	i
a	i
great	i
deal	i
of	i
life-style	i
.	c

And	c
I	c
can	c
send	c
e-mail	c
to	c
my	c
friends	c
via	c
the	c
Internet	c
fastly	i
and	c
cheaply	c
prepared	i
to	c
the	c
old-style	c
mail-services	c
.	c

Dear	c
sir	c
,	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
you	i
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
disappointing	c
expirience	i
I	c
had	c
with	c
your	c
theatre	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
have	i
a	c
discount	c
but	c
there	c
were	c
no	c
discounts	c
,	c
although	c
the	c
advertisement	c
said	c
there	c
are	c
.	c

And	c
at	i
last	c
,	c
the	c
most	c
disappointing	c
point	i
,	c
the	c
advertisement	c
again	i
said	c
that	c
there	i
would	i
be	i
Danny	i
Brook	i
,	c
my	c
favorite	i
actor	c
,	c
but	c
there	c
was	c
someone	c
else	c
instead	c
of	c
him	c
.	c

As	c
things	c
went	c
that	c
way	c
,	c
I	c
want	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

Sincerely	c
Yours	c
,	c

I	c
shall	c
have	c
a	c
look	c
into	i
the	c
place	c
I	c
believe	c
no	c
one	c
can	c
avoid	c
-	c
the	c
kitchen	c
.	c

But	c
today	c
the	c
mixer	c
or	c
some	c
more	c
complicated	c
kitchen-device	c
will	c
chop	c
and	c
mix	c
anything	c
for	c
you	c
from	c
fruits	c
to	c
meat	c
,	c
and	c
modern	c
coffee	c
machines	c
can	c
make	i
even	i
cappuccino	i
or	c
whatever	c
you	c
want	c
on	c
their	c
own	c
.	c

Those	c
devices	c
made	i
our	c
life	c
easier	c
like	i
old	c
fridges	c
had	c
to	c
be	c
defreezed	i
to	i
melt	i
out	i
and	c
new	c
fridges	c
use	c
different	i
kind	c
of	c
cooling	c
and	i
will	c
tell	c
you	c
if	c
your	i
forgot	i
to	c
close	c
the	c
door	c
!	c

The	c
modern	c
cooker	c
will	c
turn	c
off	i
itself	i
if	c
something	c
goes	c
wrong	c
!	c

Dear	c
Mr.	c
Robertson	c
,	c

This	c
show	c
will	c
be	i
taken	i
place	c
at	c
Central	i
Exhibition	c
Hall	c
in	c
London	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
14	c
of	c
March	c
at	i
10.00	c
-	c
19.00	c
,	c
which	i
include	i
the	c
latest	c
fashions	c
,	c
leisure	c
and	c
sports	c
wear	c
,	c
make	i
up	i
and	c
hairstyles	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
to	c
visit	c
because	i
it	c
is	c
shown	i
only	c
twice	c
a	c
year	c
and	c
the	i
entrance	c
is	c
free	c
for	c
students	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
most	c
of	c
us	c
are	c
designers	c
so	c
this	c
might	c
help	c
to	c
up-dated	i
their	i
knowledge	c
as	c
well	c
.	c

We	c
might	c
change	c
the	c
schedule	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
14	c
March	c
,	c
from	c
visiting	c
Science	i
Museum	c
to	c
The	c
London	c
fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
appreciate	c
if	i
the	c
matter	c
can	i
be	c
settled	c
down	i
easily	c
and	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

I	i
was	c
dangerous	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
knew	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
remember	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
in	c
secondary	c
school	c
.	c

At	c
that	c
time	c
,	c
my	c
friends	c
and	c
I	c
was	i
so	c
daring	c
and	c
full	c
of	c
energy	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
that	c
afternoon	c
in	i
lunch	i
time	i
,	c
I	c
went	c
into	c
the	c
teachers	c
'	c
room	c
and	c
opened	c
her	c
desk	c
and	c
took	c
the	c
paper	c
out	c
quitely	i
and	c
calmly	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
succeed	i
in	c
doing	c
that	c
.	c

I	c
took	c
it	c
to	c
copy	c
and	c
returned	c
it	c
back	i
without	c
anyone	c
saw	i
me	c
.	c

That	c
was	c
the	c
most	c
scarely	i
and	c
daring	c
thing	c
that	c
I	c
did	c
in	c
my	c
childhood	c
.	c

I	c
would	i
n't	i
have	i
imagined	i
if	i
I	c
had	c
been	c
caught	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr.	c
Smith	c
,	c

During	c
my	c
last	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
,	c
I	c
was	i
visiting	i
your	c
theatre	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
see	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
"	c
.	c

You	c
wrote	c
some	c
things	c
in	c
your	c
advertisement	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
disappointed	c
that	c
was	i
n't	i
true	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
disappointing	i
for	c
me	c
,	c
because	c
this	i
actors	c
were	c
recommended	c
by	c
my	c
friend	c
,	c
because	c
he	c
knows	c
Danny	c
and	c
Tina	c
.	c

So	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
wait	c
more	c
than	c
a	c
half	c
hour	c
.	c

It	i
would	c
n't	c
be	i
mind	i
if	c
the	c
restaurant	c
had	c
pressed	i
in	i
order	i
to	c
eat	c
or	c
drink	c
something	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
,	c
and	c
it	i
had	i
n't	i
also	i
opened	i
after	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
because	c
the	c
waitress	c
had	c
to	c
clean	c
up	i
the	c
theatre	c
room	i
.	c

Over	i
these	i
the	i
tickets	i
were	i
not	i
discount	i
available	c
as	c
you	c
have	i
written	c
in	i
your	c
advertisement	c
.	c

Sencerely	i
.	c

.	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
and	c
so	c
his	c
hole	i
schoole	i
knew	c
from	i
Sara	c
's	c
experience	c
.	c

She	c
did	c
n't	c
learn	i
a	c
lot	c
but	c
she	c
knew	c
all	c
important	i
things	c
.	c

She	c
was	c
a	c
very	c
nice	c
person	c
and	c
she	c
helped	i
always	i
if	c
somebody	c
need	i
her	c
help	c
.	c

One	c
day	c
she	c
had	c
to	c
make	i
the	c
shopping	c
for	c
her	c
mother	c
.	c

She	c
had	c
to	c
buy	c
a	c
lottery-ticket	i
and	c
other	c
things	c
for	c
her	c
.	c

She	c
spent	c
this	i
only	i
for	i
a	c
magazin	i
.	c

After	c
she	c
came	c
home	c
her	c
mother	c
was	c
sitting	c
in	c
front	c
of	c
the	c
TV	c
and	c
looked	c
after	i
the	c
lottery-numbers	i
.	c

Sara	c
was	c
out	c
of	c
breath	c
and	c
after	c
she	i
had	i
told	i
her	c
mother	c
,	i
she	c
had	c
n't	c
bought	c
the	c
ticket	c
.	c

She	c
had	c
earn	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
money	c
,	c
so	c
she	c
would	c
be	c
more	c
careful	c
with	i
doing	c
things	c
.	i

Dear	c
Ms	c
J.	c
Clark	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
to	c
thank	c
for	i
so	i
good	c
organisation	c
of	c
International	i
Arts	c
Festival	c
,	c
where	c
I	i
'd	i
spent	i
two	c
exellent	i
days	c
recently	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
inform	c
you	c
whed	i
the	c
idea	c
was	c
great	c
and	c
I	c
hope	c
that	c
so	i
needful	i
for	i
people	i
events	i
would	i
become	i
a	c
good	c
tradition	c
in	c
our	c
country	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
hope	c
that	c
next	c
year	c
visitores	i
of	i
festival	i
would	i
be	i
able	c
to	c
introduce	i
with	i
more	c
art	c
groups	c
from	c
all	c
over	c
the	c
world	c
.	c

Also	c
,	c
if	c
I	c
were	c
you	c
I	c
would	c
make	c
your	c
concert	c
halls	c
a	c
bit	c
larger	c
,	c
because	c
of	i
too	i
many	c
people	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
spend	c
their	c
holidays	c
with	c
their	c
families	c
on	i
your	c
festival	c
next	c
year	c

Finishing	i
my	c
letter	c
,	c
I	c
hope	c
what	i
my	c
notes	c
could	i
help	c
you	c
to	c
make	c
next-year	i
festival	c
more	c
intersting	i
and	c
comfortable	c
for	c
public	i

Want	c
to	c
be	c
independent	c
?	c

Earn	c
yourself	i
.	c

It	c
is	c
so	c
because	c
you	c
are	c
young	c
and	c
need	c
to	c
make	c
your	c
life	c
as	c
intrestng	i
as	c
it	c
can	c
be	c
now	c
.	c

So	c
thy	i
need	c
to	c
get	c
a	c
job	c
that	i
is	c
very	c
difficult	c
when	c
you	c
have	c
n't	c
any	i
special	c
education	c
and	c
experience	c
yet	c
.	c

Most	i
common	c
way	c
to	c
earn	c
is	i
baby-sitting	i
.	c

Many	c
young	c
people	c
earn	c
their	c
pocket	c
money	c
so	i
,	c
helping	c
neighbouring	i
parents	i
to	c
have	c
a	c
bit	c
more	c
spare	c
time	c
.	c

Naturally	c
,	c
it	c
's	c
easier	c
to	c
get	c
a	c
job	c
then	i
you	c
were	i
good	c
in	i
foreign	c
languagers	i
or	c
computers	c
.	c

This	c
number	c
may	i
be	c
increased	c
to	c
attract	c
more	c
and	c
different	c
people	c
.	c

Also	c
some	c
concerts	i
holls	i
were	c
too	c
small	c
for	c
this	c
much	i
people	c
.	c

In	c
contrast	c
with	c
the	c
halls	c
,	c
the	c
concerts	c
were	c
great	c
and	c
I	c
saw	c
everybody	c
enjoyed	c
then	c
.	c

The	i
films	i
and	i
plays	i
were	i
not	i
so	i
many	i
.	c

As	c
a	c
result	c
of	c
this	c
the	i
kinds	i
of	i
films	i
were	i
not	i
enough	i
.	c

In	c
order	c
to	c
attract	c
more	c
people	c
with	c
different	c
interests	c
,	c
the	c
films	c
and	c
plays	c
should	c
be	c
increased	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
nothing	c
to	c
say	c
with	i
the	c
dance	c
show	c
,	c
art	c
exhibitions	c
and	c
talks	c
by	c
writers	c
.	c

Another	c
paht	i
is	c
the	c
tickets	c
.	c

The	c
weekend	c
ticket	c
is	c
excellent	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
not	c
so	i
expensive	c
and	c
it	c
allows	c
to	i
see	c
everything	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
was	c
disappointed	c
that	c
there	c
were	i
no	c
competition	c
between	c
the	c
films	c
performed	i
I	i
think	c
there	c
should	c
be	c
an	c
Oscar-like	c
competition	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
make	c
people	c
more	c
ambitious	c
to	c
make	c
better	c
films	c
.	c

Dear	c
Elinor	c
,	c

I	c
promise	c
I	c
'll	c
write	c
more	c

The	c
school	c
is	c
like	c
a	c
dungeen	i
here	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
went	i
to	c
be	c
so	c
evel	i
about	c
school	c
but	c
the	i
rules	c
are	c
rules	c
and	c
they	c
are	c
limiting	c
us	c
with	i
the	c
borders	c
of	c
our	c
school	c
.	c

We	c
must	c
wear	c
the	i
uniform-like	c
clothes	c
all	c
the	i
day	c
and	c
week	i
They	i
do	c
n't	c
even	c
let	c
us	c
to	i
wear	i
different	c
sweaters	i
-	i
etc	c
other	c
than	c
dark	c
blue	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
boring	c
.	c

We	c
are	c
not	c
allowed	c
to	c
compare	c
our	c
thoughts	c
during	c
the	c
lessons	c
becase	i
the	c
teachers	c
think	c
that	c
we	c
are	c
chatting	c
.	c

How	c
poor	c
their	c
imagination	i
are	c
!	c
!	c

However	c
we	c
are	c
free	c
at	c
home	c
.	c

You	c
could	i
do	c
anything	c
you	c
like	c
as	c
long	c
as	c
you	c
have	c
good	c
grades	c
.	c

Love	c
,	c

To	c
the	c
manager	c
of	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
not	c
too	c
happy	c
about	c
that	c
and	c
why	c
did	c
n't	c
the	c
theatre	i
start	c
when	c
it	c
was	c
suposed	i
to	c
start	c
?	c

(	c
45	c
min	c
late	c
)	c
,	c
and	c
where	c
were	c
the	c
discounts	c
which	c
were	c
available	i
?	c

In	i
the	i
end	i
of	c
the	c
show	c
I	c
was	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
have	i
a	c
nice	c
dinner	c
in	c
the	c
restaurant	c
together	c
with	c
my	c
boyfriend	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
,	c
because	c
you	c
were	c
short	c
of	c
staff	c
.	c

I	c
buy	c
all	c
my	c
clothes	c
on	c
internet	i
as	c
well	c
and	c
it	c
works	c
brilliant	i
,	c
but	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
admit	c
that	c
there	c
are	c
some	c
disadvantages	c
with	c
internet	i
too	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
get	c
as	c
much	c
exercise	c
as	c
I	c
used	c
to	c
get	c
.	c

Nowdays	i
I	c
spend	c
2	c
hours	c
intent	i
of	c
the	c
computer	c
every	c
day	c
,	c
shopping	c
or	c
chatting	c
to	c
people	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
got	c
friends	c
over	c
the	c
whole	c
world	c
now	c
.	c

I	c
'll	c
go	c
to	c
Japan	c
next	c
month	c
to	c
visit	c
one	c
of	c
my	c
internetfriends	i
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
think	c
that	c
I	c
had	i
been	i
going	c
to	c
Japan	c
if	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
because	i
of	i
internet	i

Sally	c
Svenssen	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Ryan	c

I	c
would	c
be	i
glad	i
to	c
travel	c
only	c
in	c
July	c
because	i
of	i
family	c
reasons	c
.	c

Other	i
point	c
is	c
accommodation	c
.	c

The	c
reasons	c
as	i
following	c
;	i
better	i
relationship	c
with	c
nature	c
,	c
and	c
grate	i
opportunity	c
to	c
improve	c
my	c
health	c
.	c

I	c
like	c
swimming	c
and	c
photography	c
because	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
very	c
interesting	c
to	c
improve	c
my	c
skills	c
at	c
both	c
activities	c
.	c

The	c
last	c
thing	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
is	c
which	i
clothes	c
do	i
I	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
,	c
even	c
though	c
the	c
weathe	i
in	c
July	c
will	c
be	c
good	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
.	c

Almost	c
all	c
of	c
us	c
like	c
shopping	c
!	c

Going	c
in	c
and	c
out	c
of	c
the	c
shops	c
,	c
buying	c
clothes	c
,	c
food	c
and	c
presents	c
,	c
but	c
a	i
few	c
of	c
us	c
who	i
is	i
very	c
happy	c
to	c
spend	c
money	c
.	c

We	c
will	c
say	c
unlucky	i
,	c
but	c
no	c
one	c
will	c
help	c
you	c
in	c
that	c
situation	c
.	c

After	i
words	i
you	c
are	c
tiered	i
and	c
have	c
no	c
power	i
to	c
do	c
things	c
.	c

After	c
all	c
things	i
that	c
I	c
have	c
mentioned	c
it	c
is	c
clearly	i
seen	i
that	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

The	c
Manager	c
of	c
the	c
Theatre	c
Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
so	c
as	c
to	c
express	c
my	c
great	c
disappointment	c
about	c
the	c
Musical	c
Show	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
,	c
"	c
I	i
attended	c
to	i
,	i
a	c
fortnight	c
ago	c
.	c

Additionally	c
,	c
I	c
could	c
not	c
even	c
enjoy	c
having	c
a	c
drink	c
,	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
in	c
the	c
Theatre	c
Restaurant	c
as	c
it	c
was	c
simply	c
closed	c
for	c
renovation	c
.	c

Not	c
at	c
all	c
.	c

Under	c
these	c
circumstances	c
,	c
as	c
your	c
Theatre	c
did	c
not	c
fullfil	i
its	c
commitments	c
,	c
I	c
ask	c
you	c
for	c
a	c
full	c
refund	c
and	c
I	c
expect	c
to	c
receive	c
a	c
cheque	c
of	i
Â£	c
15	c
,	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c
Yours	c
faithfully	c

I	c
had	c
made	i
my	c
own	c
experience	c
with	c
her	c
so	i
far	i
and	c
I	c
would	c
be	i
always	i
careful	c
not	c
to	c
tell	c
her	c
anything	c
important	c
when	i
ever	i
we	c
met	c
.	c

As	c
,	i
Pat	c
had	c
recently	c
made	c
a	c
new	c
friend	c
with	i
Olga	c
,	c
my	c
sister	c
,	c
I	c
warned	c
my	c
sibling	c
about	c
Pat	c
's	c
failing	c
:	c
"	c
Do	c
n't	c
ever	c
rely	c
on	c
Pat	c
for	i
keeping	i
a	c
secret	c
,	c
Sweet-Heart	i
;	c
she	c
just	c
ca	c
n't	c
"	c
!	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
guess	c
that	c
Olga	c
turned	i
a	i
deaf	i
hear	i
to	c
what	c
I	c
had	c
told	c
her	c
.	c

This	i
is	c
the	c
impression	c
I	c
got	c
.	c

I	c
did	c
n't	c
say	c
anything	c
and	c
let	c
her	c
go	c
on	c
grieving	c
over	i
herself	c
.	c

After	c
a	c
while	c
,	c
she	c
pulled	c
herself	c
together	c
and	c
paused	c
for	c
a	c
minute	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
then	c
,	c
feel	i
her	i
,	i
upset	c
as	c
ever	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
get	c
her	c
as	i
well	i
simmer	i
for	c
a	c
second	c
or	c
two	c
then	c
she	c
suddenly	c
sarted	i
shouting	c
uncontrollably	c
:	c
-	c
"	c
Never	c
have	c
I	c
met	c
such	c
a	c
poor	c
cow	c
like	c
Pat	c
"	c
,	c
hurled	i
Olga	i
at	i
me	c
,	i
through	i
the	c
phone	c
.	c

First	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
university	c
student	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
only	c
one	c
month	c
summer	i
vacation	c
that	i
is	c
in	c
July	c
.	c

Next	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
time	c
to	c
relax	c
when	c
I	c
travel	c
.	c

For	c
activities	c
,	c
my	c
first	c
choise	i
is	c
basketball	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
been	c
playing	c
it	c
since	c
I	c
was	c
nine	c
years	c
old	c
.	c

My	c
second	c
choise	i
is	c
golf	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
never	c
played	c
it	c
until	c
last	c
month	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
could	c
enjoy	c
it	c
,	c
even	c
though	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
biginner	i
,	c
so	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
practice	i
and	c
have	c
fun	c
at	c
the	c
camp	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
giving	c
me	c
this	c
great	c
opportunity	c
.	c

I	c
will	c
be	c
expecting	c
to	c
hear	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

I	i
've	i
got	c
your	c
letter	c
yesterday	c
.	c

I	c
enjoyed	c
reading	c
how	c
you	c
spent	c
time	c
with	c
your	c
family	c
and	c
had	c
fun	c
at	c
the	c
Park	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
.	c

He	c
knew	c
that	c
I	c
'd	c
wanted	c
to	c
work	c
at	c
a	c
concert	c
hall	c
,	c
possibly	c
as	c
a	c
lighting	c
technician	c
.	c

So	c
he	c
suggested	c
me	c
to	c
help	c
their	i
concert	c
so	c
that	c
I	c
could	c
know	c
behind	c
the	c
scenes	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
arrived	c
there	c
,	c
the	c
staff	c
were	c
already	c
busy	c
.	c

At	c
first	c
I	c
just	c
helped	c
setting	c
up	c
the	c
stage	c
;	c
setting	c
microphones	c
,	c
and	c
tuning	c
guiters	i
.	c

When	c
I	c
was	c
doing	c
it	c
,	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
staff	c
called	c
me	c
and	c
brought	i
me	c

a	c
room	c

He	c
explained	c
me	i
that	c
it	c
was	c
to	c
controll	i
the	c

It	c
was	c
fun	c
practicing	i
how	c
to	c
move	c
the	c
lights	c
and	c
change	c
the	c
lights	c

When	c
the	c
concert	c

I	c
was	c
exhausted	c

happy	c

I	i
'll	i

Thank	c
you	c

I	c

sorry	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
I	c
can	c
attend	c
your	c
camp	c
only	c
on	i
July	c
because	c
I	c
just	c
started	c
my	c
new	c

I	c
got	i
one	c
month	c
of	c
my	i
holiday	c

which	c
are	i
on	i
July	c

You	c
wrote	c
to	c
me	c
that	c
I	c
can	c
choice	i
my	c
accommodation	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
stay	i
in	c
log	c
cabins	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
a	c
problem	c
with	c
my	c
back	i
it	i
is	c
a	i
reason	c
that	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
lie	c
on	c
the	c
ground	c
.	c

You	c
wrote	c
to	c
me	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
a	c
chance	c
to	c
do	c
two	c
activities	c
,	c
which	c
I	c
can	c
choice	i

I	c
'm	c
quite	c
good	c
in	i
paiting	i
and	c
I	c
play	c
tennis	c

I	c
'm	c
champion	c
of	c
my	c

think	c
I	c
can	c
find	c
a	c
right	i

who	c
can	c
play	c
with	c
me	c

Could	c
you	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
!	c

Last	c
month	c
we	c
had	c
the	c
pop	c
concert	c
of	c
our	c
favourite	c
polish	i
group	c
"	c
THE	c
CULT	c
"	c
in	c
Warshaw	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
the	c
chance	c
to	c
help	c
at	c
the	c
concert	c
.	c

You	c
ca	c
n't	c
imagine	c
how	c
happy	c
I	c
was	c
.	c

I	c
got	c
money	c
for	c
that	c
job	c
and	c
I	c
enjoyed	c
the	c
work	c
a	c
lot	c
.	c

You	c
know	c
I	c
'm	c
good	c
in	i
mace-up	i
and	c
I	c
have	c
done	c
many	i
times	i
scenography	i
.	c

They	c
were	c
pleased	c
that	c
I	c
can	c
do	c
two	c
of	c
this	i
job	i
that	i
's	c
why	c
I	c
got	c
the	c
work	i
.	c

I	c
did	c
n't	c
sleep	c
two	c
nights	c
because	c
I	c
was	c
preparing	c
the	c
stage	c
where	c
they	c
made	i
the	c
concert	c
.	c

Could	c
you	c
imagine	c
that	c
they	c
asked	c
me	c
to	c
make	c
the	c
summer	c
scenography	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
the	c
result	c
of	c
that	c
action	c
was	c
marvelous	i
.	c

Everybody	c
was	c
very	c
suprise	i
that	c
you	c
can	c
create	c
such	c
amazing	c
things	c
,	c
using	c
a	i
sizors	i
and	c
papers	i
.	c

I	c
just	c
rulled	i
a	i
paper	c
and	c
I	c
painted	c
a	i
little	i
white	i
colours	i
on	c
the	c
top	c
.	c

The	c
light	c
on	c
the	c
stage	c
was	c
very	c
bright	c
and	c
very	c
warm	c
what	i
's	i
made	c
the	c
scenery	c
very	c
pleasent	i
.	c

After	c
that	c
I	c
prepared	c
the	c
group	c
.	c

I	c
done	i
mace-up	i
for	c
them	c
.	c

She	c
is	c
very	c
intelligent	c
.	c

I	c
really	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
why	c
she	c
behave	i
herself	i
so	c
badly	c
during	c
her	c
interview	c
.	c

I	c
got	c
their	c
address	c
so	c
we	c
can	c
visit	c
them	c
one	c
day	c
.	c

We	c
'll	c
speak	c
about	c
it	c
when	c
I	c
come	c
to	c
see	c
you	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
to	c
see	c
you	c
soon	c

A	c
lot	c
of	c
kisses	c

Dear	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
the	c
wide	c
range	c
of	c
plays	c
and	c
films	c
to	c
choose	c
impressed	i
me	c
most	i
.	c

I	c
also	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
the	c
excellent	c
idea	c
of	c
one	i
ticket	c
for	c
all	c
events	c
,	c
which	c
allowed	c
me	c
to	c
see	c
all	c
the	c
things	c
I	c
was	c
interested	c
in	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

Dear	c
Friend	c
,	c

If	c
you	c
really	c
want	c
to	c
hear	c
about	c
school	c
rules	c
in	c
my	c
country	c
,	c
I	c
'll	c
try	c
to	c
write	c
about	c
them	c
in	i
a	i
nutshell	i
.	c

We	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
to	c
wear	c
any	c
special	c
uniforms	c
on	i
signs	i
of	c
our	c
school	c
.	c

Some	c
rules	c
are	c
really	c
simple	c
:	c
we	c
must	c
be	c
at	c
school	c
on	c
time	c
,	c
and	c
we	c
must	c
not	c
disturb	c
others	c
during	c
the	i
classes	c
.	c

We	c
are	c
not	c
allowed	c
to	c
smoke	c
cigarettes	c
or	c
drink	c
alcohol	c
of	c
course	c
!	c

It	c
may	c
sound	c
funny	c
,	c
but	c
mud	c
,	c
gravel	c
and	c
snow	c
lying	c
on	c
the	c
school	i
's	i
floors	c
is	c
not	c
a	c
nice	c
sight	c
,	c
so	c
we	c
change	c
our	c
schoes	i
without	c
questioning	c
that	c
rule	c
.	c

At	c
home	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
many	c
rules	c
either	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
think	c
there	c
is	c
anything	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
change	c
.	c

Your	i
faithfully	i

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
with	c
reference	c
to	c
your	c
letter	c
,	c
which	c
I	c
have	c
just	c
received	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
happy	c
to	c
hear	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
really	c
excited	c
to	c
travel	c
at	i
Camp	c
California	c
in	c
the	c
USA	c
because	c
I	c
like	c
to	c
know	i
people	c
of	i
other	c
countries	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
have	i
accommodation	i
in	c
log	i
cabins	i
because	c
I	c
like	c
to	c
be	c
comfortable	c
and	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
like	c
to	c
be	i
lied	i
down	c
on	c
the	c
floor	c
inside	c
a	c
tent	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
play	c
basketball	c
because	c
I	c
love	c
this	c
game	c
.	c

I	c
used	c
to	c
play	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
at	c
high	c
school	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
very	c
competitive	c
player	c
,	c
as	c
well	c
or	i
a	c
technical	i
player	c
.	c

Also	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
do	c
swimming	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
I	c
am	c
very	i
fast	c
swimming	i
but	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
good	c
style	c
and	i
technic	i

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

I	c
have	c
been	c
helping	c
to	c
organise	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
in	c
Dublin	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
know	c
I	c
love	c
irish	i
music	c
so	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
happy	c
when	c
the	c
organisers	c
of	c
the	c
concert	c
phone	i
me	c
to	c
help	c
them	c
.	c

The	c
organisers	c
paid	c
for	c
my	c
acommodation	i
and	c
travel	i
to	c
Ireland	c
.	c

I	c
arrived	c
at	i
Ireland	c
on	c
2th	i
July	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
next	c
day	c
I	c
helped	c
them	c
to	c
built	i
the	c
scenary	i
and	c
I	c
had	c
enough	c
time	c
to	c
visit	c
a	c
museum	c
in	c
Dublin	c
in	c
the	c
evening	c
.	c

While	c
we	c
were	c
installing	c
the	c
sound	c
system	c
we	c
listened	c
irish	i
music	c
and	c
suddenly	c
we	c
saw	c
to	i
U2	c
,	c
which	c
is	c
my	c
favourite	c
group	c
,	c
going	c
inside	c
the	c
stadium	c
and	c
they	c
played	c
music	c
for	c
us	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
speak	c
to	c
my	c
favourite	c
singer	c
'	c
Bono	c
'	c
,	i
I	c
could	c
meet	c
him	c
and	c
I	c
helped	c
him	c
to	c
repair	c
his	c
guitar	c
because	c
it	c
did	c
n't	c
sound	c
very	c
well	i

Best	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

I	c
saws	i
the	c
show	c
's	c
advertisement	c
hanging	c
up	c
of	i
a	c
wall	c
in	c
London	c
where	c
I	c
was	c
spending	c
my	c
holiday	c
with	c
some	c
friends	c
.	c

I	c
convinced	c
them	c
to	c
go	c
there	c
with	c
me	c
because	c
I	c
had	c
heard	c
good	c
references	i
about	i
your	c
Company	c
and	c
,	c
above	c
all	c
,	c
about	i
the	c
main	c
star	c
,	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
.	c

The	c
problems	c
started	c
in	i
the	c
box	c
office	c
,	c
where	c
we	c
asked	c
for	c
the	c
discounts	c
you	c
announced	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
,	c
and	c
the	c
man	c
who	c
was	c
selling	c
the	c
tickets	c
said	c
that	c
they	c
did	c
n't	c
exist	c
.	c

You	c
promised	c
a	c
perfect	c
evening	c
but	c
it	c
became	c
a	c
big	c
disastrous	i
!	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
some	c
kind	c
of	c
explanation	c
and	c
receive	i
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
agree	c
,	c
I	c
will	c
act	c
consequently	i
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

Last	c
Wednesday	c
Carole	c
received	c
a	c
letter	c
.	c

The	c
stamp	c
was	c
from	c
a	c
foreign	c
country	c
and	c
the	c
address	c
was	c
written	c
in	c
Capital	c
Letters	c
.	c

She	c
did	c
n't	c
recognize	c
the	c
writing	c
.	c

She	c
began	c
to	c
read	c
"	i
Dear	c
Carolin.	c
.	c

There	c
was	c
only	c
a	i
person	c
who	c
used	c
to	c
call	c
her	c
by	c
this	c
name	c

It	c
was	c
long	c
time	c
ago	c
,	c
when	c
she	c
was	c
fourteen	c
and	c
Paul	c
sixteen	c

When	c
they	c
were	c
saying	c

Paul	c
"	i
I	c
will	c

"	c
It	c
sounds	c
nice	c
but	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c

it	c
"	i
she	c
replied	c
.	c

"	c
You	c
only	c
have	c
to	c
wait	c

he	c
said	c

But	c
she	c
did	c
n't	c

At	i
this	i

was	c

they	c
did	c

any	c
more	c

Their	c
love	c
had	c
finished	c

In	c
his	c
letter	c
Paul	c
said	c
that	c
he	c
had	c

a	c
rich	c
man	c
and	c
he	c
would	c
come	c
back	c
to	c

closed	c
all	i
the	i
time	c
.	c

All	i
the	i
impressions	i
were	i
destroyed	i
by	i
many	i
problems	i
.	c

Or	c
I	c
will	c
have	c
nothing	i
to	i
do	i
except	c
for	i
going	i
to	c
the	i

Faithfully	c
,	c

Three	c
hundred	c
years	c
ago	c
fashion	c
changed	c
up	i
one	i
time	i
in	i
each	i
hundred	c
years	c

One	c
hundred	c
years	c
ago	c
it	c
was	c
one	i
time	i
in	c
50-25	c
years	c
.	c

And	c
now	c
we	c
have	c
to	c
change	c
some	c
of	c
our	c
clothes	c
every	c
6	c
months	c
because	c
they	c
are	c
not	c
so	c
fashionable	c
any	c
more	c
.	c

Fashion	c
is	c
becoming	c
more	c
useful	c
,	i
all	i
the	c
new	c
inventions	c
and	c
technologies	i
are	c
going	c
to	c
play	c
an	c
important	c
part	c
in	c
the	c
fashion	c
industry	c
of	c
the	c
future	c
.	c

With	c
no	c
doubt	c
,	c
the	c
influence	c
of	c
modern	c
technologies	i
will	c
be	c
great	c
.	c

Future	i
clothes	c
will	c
be	c
very	c
useful	c
and	c
incredibly	c
comfortable	c
,	i
we	i
can	c
see	c
the	c
progress	c
in	c
the	i
fashion	c
even	c
now	c
.	c

So	c
all	i
the	i
fashion	c
industry	c
will	c
work	c
to	c
make	c
clothes	c
more	c
useful	c
,	c
practical	c
and	c
comfortable	c
.	c

What	c
will	c
we	c
have	c

Dear	c

Ryan	c
,	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
only	c
in	c
the	c
month	c
of	c
July	c
,	c
because	c
during	c
the	c
month	c
of	c
June	c
,	i
I	c
'm	c
going	c
to	c
work	c
and	c
in	c
September	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
study	c
a	c
lot	c
,	c
because	c
school	c
will	c
start	c
.	i

Speaking	i
about	i
accommodation	c
,	c
between	c
tents	c
and	c
log	c
cabins	c
,	c
I	c
woul	i
prefer	c
tents	i
,	c
because	c
I	c
love	c
the	i
adventure	c
and	c
also	c
because	c
I	c
can	c
be	c
freer	c
.	c

I	c
know	c
I	c
will	c
have	c
the	c
chance	c
to	c
do	c
two	c
activities	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
have	c
choosen	i
two	c
from	c
your	c
list	c
:	c
Basketball	i
,	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
playing	c
it	c
since	c
I	c
was	c
eight	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
taking	i
part	i
in	i
a	c
strong	c
team	c
for	c
three	c
years	c
.	c

The	c
other	c
one	c
I	c
have	c
choosen	i
is	c
swimming	c
;	c
for	c
the	c
same	c
reason	c
why	c
I	c
chose	c
Basketball	i
.	c

But	c
,	c
what	c
about	c
clothes	c
,	c
money	c
,	c
food	c
?	c

Yours	c
faithfuly	i

Many	c
people	c
"	c
see	c
"	c
at	i
shopping	c
like	i
an	c
amusement	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
think	c
it	i
's	i
not	i
always	i
a	i
good	i
translation	i
to	i
give	i
it	i
.	c

For	c
exemple	i
,	c
if	c
the	c
shop	c
is	c
full	c
of	c
people	c
,	c
is	i
not	c
enjoyable	c
,	c
because	c
they	c
will	c
create	c
too	c
confusion	i
,	c
too	c
noise	i
with	i
the	i
risk	i
of	i
leaving	i
time	c
.	c

Shopping	c
is	c
a	c
funny	i
thing	c
to	c
do	c
,	c
not	c
when	c
you	c
are	c
in	c
a	c
hurry	c
,	c
but	c
when	c
you	c
have	c
free	i
time	c
and	c
when	c
you	c
can	c
relax	c
yourself	i
.	c

Another	c
thing	c
that	c
regardes	i
me	i
,	c
is	c
that	c
I	c
enjoy	c
my	i
self	i
more	c
when	c
I	c
know	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
do	i
shopping	c
for	c
me	i
than	c
when	c
it	c
's	c
for	c
my	c
parents	c
or	c
for	c
somebody	c

17.6.2000	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

I	c
saw	c
your	c
advertisement	c
and	c
I	c
expected	c
a	c
discounted	c
ticket	c
for	c
students	c
.	c

But	c
in	c
a	i
ticket	c
office	c
I	c
realised	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
get	c
it	c
.	c

Another	c
problem	c
was	c
the	c
time	c
.	c

The	c
play	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
start	c
at	c
19.30	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
delayed	c
so	i
at	c
20.15	c
a	i
curtain	c
of	c
the	c
stage	c
was	c
pulled	i
up	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
a	c
big	c
fan	c
of	c
Danny	c
Book	c
and	c
it	i
was	c
why	c
I	c
chose	c
'	c
over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
'	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
saw	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
playing	c
his	c
role	c
I	c
was	c
really	c
disappointed	c
.	c

Las	i
problem	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
is	i
a	i
restaraunt	i
there	c
.	c

After	c
the	c
show	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
restaurant	c
according	c
to	c
your	c
advertisement	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	i
of	i
decoration	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
booked	c
the	c
ticket	c
I	c
really	c
expected	i
the	c
show	c
.	c

Unlike	c
my	c
expectation	c
it	c
was	c
so	c
disappointing	c
and	c
annoying	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
for	c
some	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

I	c
remember	c
some	c
sientific	i
cartoons	i
when	i
I	i
was	i
younger	i
I	i
watched	i
on	i
television	i
.	c

Modern	c
technology	c
has	c
been	c
changing	c
even	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
in	c
positive	c
and	c
negative	c
ways	c
at	c
the	c
same	c
time	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
got	c
my	c
own	c
computer	c
so	c
it	c
is	c
easy	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
send	c
e-mails	c
to	c
my	c
friends	c
very	c
often	c
.	c

Second	c
I	i
can	c
save	c
time	c
.	c

If	c
there	c
was	c
no	c
public	c
transport	c
like	c
underground	i
in	c
a	c
big	c
city	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
imagine	c
travelling	c
on	c
time	c
.	c

Because	c
of	c
computeres	i
or	c
telephones	c
I	c
could	c
have	c
less	c
chances	i
to	c
meet	c
my	c
friends	c
than	c
before	c
.	c

Another	c
problem	c
is	c
pollution	c
.	c

The	c
more	c
cars	c
there	c
are	c
on	c
the	c
street	c
,	c
the	c
more	c
difficult	c
it	c
is	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
keep	c
myself	c
fit	c
.	c

In	c
spite	c
of	c
its	c
good	c
sides	c
I	i
think	c
my	c
life	c
could	c
get	c
worse	c
.	c

To	c
live	c
in	c
this	c
world	c
needs	c
somebody	c
else	c
to	c
contact	c
and	c
health	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
am	c
loosing	c
chances	c
to	c
meet	c
my	c
friend	c
face	c
to	c
face	c
and	c
I	c
feel	c
I	c
am	c
getting	c
weaker	c
.	c

I	c
suppose	c
people	c
including	i
me	c
should	i
keep	i
themselves	i
in	i
a	i
limited	i
their	i
own	i
space	i
in	i
near	i
future	i
.	i

It	c
will	c
be	c
caused	c
by	c
technology	c
.	c

Dear	c
Ms	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
was	c
so	c
surprised	c
and	c
delighted	c
as	c
well	c
receiving	i
from	c
you	c
such	c
wonderful	c
news	c
!	c

From	c
your	c
letter	c
I	c
was	c
pleased	c
to	c
know	i
that	c
all	c
accommodation	c
and	c
travel	c
costs	c
are	c
paid	c
for	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
been	c
learnt	i
to	c
paint	c
.	c

And	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
nice	c
audience	c
for	c
my	c
poetry	c
as	c
well	c
,	i
I	c
'm	c
a	c
poet	c
,	c
yeas	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
be	i
choose	c
a	i
month	c
July	i
,	c
because	c
I	c
'm	c
free	c
in	i
this	c
time	c
from	c
family	i
's	i
duties	c
.	c

What	i
about	i
another	i
camp	c
conditions	c
-	c
it	c
does	c
not	c
matter	c
for	c
me	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c

I	c
am	c
writting	i
about	c
this	i
letter	c
that	c
I	c
recently	c
received	c
from	c
you	c
,	c
which	c
is	c
about	c
a	c
competition	c
that	i
I	c
have	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
.	c

About	c
the	c
accommodation	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
log	i
cabins	i
instand	i
of	c
tents	i
,	c
because	c
is	i
safer	c
and	c
more	c
confortable	i
.	c

The	c
two	c
activities	c
that	c
I	c
prefer	c
will	i
be	i
Basketball	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
had	i
the	i
experience	i
to	i
play	i
in	c
my	c
school	c
's	c
big	i
for	c
almoust	i
a	c
year	c
,	c
and	c
Photography	c
,	c
which	c
is	c
a	c
hobby	c
that	c
I	c
am	c
good	c
at	c
and	c
I	c
practice	i
since	c
I	c
was	c
ten	c
.	c

On	c
top	c
of	c
everything	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
should	i
I	i
take	c
,	c
and	c
which	i
type	c
of	c
clothes	c
are	c
the	c
best	c
to	c
wear	c
in	c
the	c
competition	c
.	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
everything	c
at	c
the	c
shopping	i
is	c
more	c
expensive	c
,	c
because	c
the	c
people	c
that	c
buy	i
on	i
it	i
usually	c
do	c
n't	c
compare	c
prices	c
or	c
look	c
for	c
cheaper	c
shops	c
,	c
because	c
all	c
they	c
need	c
it	i
is	c
already	c
at	c
this	c
place	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
why	c
do	c
n't	c
we	c
try	c
to	c
change	c
our	c
customs	i
and	c
start	c
to	c
do	c
knew	i
things	c
to	c
enjoy	c
ourselves	c
.	c

There	c
were	c
many	c
things	c
that	c
were	c
wrong	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
I	c
saw	c
.	c

But	c
the	c
problems	c
started	c
while	i
I	c
arrived	c
the	i
place	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
a	c
discount	c
for	i
it	i
,	c
but	c
they	c
refussed	i
it	c
and	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
pay	c
the	c
full	c
price	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
hope	c
that	c
you	c
will	c
understand	c
my	c
point	c
.	c

I	c
also	c
had	i
to	c
tell	c
you	c
that	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
there	c
were	c
few	i
people	c
there	c
and	c
they	c
take	i
me	i
out	i
of	i
the	c
place	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
upset	c
.	c

Pat	c
's	c
secret	c

She	c
had	c
told	c
him	c
about	c
the	i
relationship	c
with	c
her	c
boyfriend	c
.	c

Everybody	c
knew	c
that	c
Caroline	c
and	c
her	c
boyfriend	c
John	c
,	i
loved	c
each	c
other	c
so	c
much	c
that	c
it	c
would	c
n't	c
be	c
rare	i
to	c
find	c
that	c
they	c
had	c
have	i
sex	c
together	i
.	c

The	c
point	c
here	c
is	c
,	i
that	c
Caroline	c
choosed	i
the	c
worst	c
friend	c
to	c
told	i
this	c
.	i

She	c
was	c
also	c
concerned	c
about	c
being	c
pregned	i
,	c
but	c
she	c
was	c
afraid	c
to	c
told	i
John	c
about	c
it	c
.	c

He	c
could	c
n't	c
belived	i
what	c
Pat	c
had	c
told	c
him	c
,	c
so	c
he	c
broke	c
Pat	c
's	c
nose	c
.	c

And	c
Pat	c
understood	c
that	c
secrets	i
should	i
die	i
on	i
your	i
own	i
.	c

London	c
is	c
the	c
place	c
to	c
be	c
when	i
always	i
something	c
happening	c
.	c

The	c
students	c
in	c
my	c
class	c
have	c
seen	c
an	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
,	c
we	i
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
if	c
is	i
possible	c
to	c
make	c
some	c
changes	c
in	i
the	c
programme	c
?	i

The	c
show	c
is	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
the	i
14th	c
between	c
10.00-	i
13.00	i
.	c

We	c
think	c
is	i
the	i
great	c
opportunity	c
to	c
see	c
latest	i
fashion	i
,	c
find	i
about	i
make	i
up	i
and	c
hairstyles	c
.	c

And	c
all	c
of	c
it	c
is	c
free	c
,	i
According	c
to	c
your	c
programme	c
we	i
have	c
the	c
science	i
Museum	c
which	c
is	c
in	c
the	c
morning	c
and	c
then	c
shopping	c
.	c

Would	c
it	c
be	c
possible	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
Museum	c
and	c
then	c
for	i
the	i
shopping	c
in	c
our	c
free	c
time	c
which	i
is	c
on	c
Wednesday	c
?	c

your	i
sincerly	i

I	c
think	c
for	c
all	c
of	c
us	c
home	c
is	c
something	c
which	c
is	c
a	i
very	c
important	c
.	c

Home	c
sweet	c
home	c
.	c

We	c
call	c
home	c
the	c
place	c
where	c
we	c
live	c
or	c
the	c
country	c
where	c
we	c
come	c
frome	i
.	c

After	c
hard	c
work	c
we	i
want	c
to	c
go	c
home	c
to	c
have	c
our	c
corner	c
where	c
we	c
are	c
all	i
able	c
to	c
rest	c
and	c
relax	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
home	c
might	c
be	c
just	c
the	c
place	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
sleep	c
.	c

Working	c
long	c
hours	c
,	c
doing	c
plenty	c
of	c
activieties	i
,	c
going	c
out	c
,	c
going	c
on	c
holidays	c
.	c

We	c
even	i
do	i
n't	i
spend	c
time	c
with	c
families	i
.	c

Propably	i
in	c
the	c
future	c
we	c
might	i
be	c
to	i
busy	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
our	c
own	c
home	c
and	c
spend	c
some	c
time	c
there	c
.	c

But	c
in	i
the	c
end	c
of	c
the	c
day	c
it	c
alway	i
will	i
be	c
place	i
to	c
go	c
!	c

We	c
find	c
our	c
family	c
there	c
and	c
our	c
life	c
.	c

Some	c
of	c
us	c
have	c
been	c
living	c
in	c
one	i
house	c
since	c
they	i
were	c
born	c
.	c

We	c
are	c
sentimental	c
and	c
we	c
have	c
memory	i
from	c
the	c
past	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
's	c
a	c
part	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
glad	c
to	c
be	c
informed	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c

Firstly	c
,	c
the	c
date	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
on	c
would	c
only	c
be	c
in	c
July	c
.	c

Regarding	c
to	i
the	c
accomodation	i
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
tents	c
because	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
closer	c
to	c
the	i
nature	c
.	c

Tennis	c
is	c
my	c
favourate	i
sports	i
evant	i

Since	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
been	c
to	c
U.S.A	i
,	c
I	c
know	c
nothing	c
about	c
it	c
.	c

Would	c
you	c
like	c
to	c
tell	c
me	c
how	c
much	c
should	i
be	i
taken	i
with	c
me	c
as	c
pocket	c
money	c
and	c
what	c
shall	i
I	c
wear	c
at	c
that	c
time	c
?	i

I	c

you	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c

Shopping	c
,	i
is	c
becoming	c
a	c
popular	c
way	c
of	c
killing	c
time	c
nowdays	i
.	c

In	c
some	c
peoples	i
'	i
opinion	c
,	c
shopping	c
and	c
spending	c
money	c
is	c
a	c
kind	c
of	c
fun	i
and	c
they	c
can	c
even	c
get	c
self-satisfaction	i
from	c
it	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
more	c
and	c
more	c
people	c
are	c
now	c
asking	c
,	c
"	c
Is	c
shopping	c
always	c
so	c
enjoyable	c
?	c
"	c

In	c
my	c
view	c
,	c
the	c
answer	c
is	c
,	c
NO	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
since	c
more	c
and	c
more	c
people	c
go	c
shopping	c
,	c
shops	c
are	c
always	c
so	c
crowded	c
,	c
especially	c
the	c
popular	c
ones	c
.	c

Try	c
to	c
imagine	c
the	c
scence	i
:	c
twenty	c
or	c
thirty	c
or	c
even	c
more	c
people	c
are	c
keeping	i
a	c
quel	i
outside	c
the	c
fitting	c
room	c
.	c

Would	c
you	c
be	c
patient	c
enough	c
to	c
wait	c
for	c
half	c
an	c
hour	c
or	c
more	c
just	c
because	c
you	c
wanna	i
buy	i
a	c
T-shirt	c
?	c

Secondly	c
,	c
the	c
cost	c
is	c
also	c
a	c
problem	c
.	c

It	c
will	i
be	i
really	i
an	i
annoying	c
thing	c
when	c
you	c
are	c
keen	c
on	c
something	c
but	c
you	c
ca	c
n't	c
afford	c
it	c
.	c

One	c
of	c
my	c
friend	i
,	c
Emma	c
,	c
happened	c
to	c
see	c
a	c
fantastic	c
jacket	c
which	c
costs	c
Â£	c
105	c
.	c

Then	c
she	c
spent	c
all	c
her	c
spare	c
time	c
doing	c
part-time	c
jobs	c
to	c
earn	c
money	c
.	c

After	c
a	c
week	c
,	c
she	c
had	c
got	c
enough	c
money	c
and	c
rushed	c
to	c
that	c
shop	c
.	c

But	c
it	c
was	c
just	c
not	c
there	c
!	c

She	c
felt	c
really	c
badly	i
after	c
that	c
.	c

More	c
and	c
more	c
people	c
find	c
that	c
there	c
are	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
nicer	c
things	c
they	c
can	c
do	c
rather	c
than	c
shopping	c
.	c

Sometimes	c
it	c
can	c
be	c
a	c
waste	c
of	c
time	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
this	c
great	c
opportunity	c
to	c
travel	c
with	c
you	c
for	c
free	c

I	c
could	c
only	c
travel	c
on	i
the	c
first	c

I	c

their	c
trip	c
to	c
Italy	c
,	c
due	c
to	c

on	c
the	c
20th	c
.	c

In	i
respect	i
of	i
the	c
activities	c
you	c
offer	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
difficult	c
to	c
choose	c
in	i
such	c
a	c
hugh	i
variety	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
prefer	c
to	c
do	c
those	c
I	c
better	i
know	i
as	i

've	c
been	c

take	i
pictures	c
of	c
new	c

Please	c
send	c
me	c
a	c
list	c

Who	c

with	i
an	i

And	c
finally	c
who	c
has	c
all	c
the	c
time	c

to	c

even	c

I	c
particularly	c

the	c
products	c
before	i

But	c
even	c
without	c

is	i
fun	c
to	c
rush	c
from	c
time	c
to	c
time	c
in	i
the	c

that	c
seasonaly	i
appear	c

at	c
the	c

Shopping	c
may	c

not	c
at	c
all	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c

Secondly	c
,	c
from	c
the	c
list	c
of	c

that	c
you	c
are	i
also	i
state	i
in	c
the	c

I	c
would	c

it	i

Dear	c
Kim	c

Many	c
thanks	c
for	c
your	c
last	c
letter	c
.	c

Anyway	c
,	c
the	c
reason	c
I	c
'm	c
writing	c
is	c
that	c
you	c
asked	c
me	c
about	c
my	c
experience	c
with	c
the	c
most	c
famous	c
pop	c
group	c
in	c
America	c
:	c
"	c
Mana	c
"	c

First	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
accept	c
but	c
finally	c
she	c
conviced	i
me	c
.	c

I	c
did	c
hamburgers	c
and	c
hot	c
dogs	c
and	c
I	c
prepare	i
orange	c
juices	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
grateful	i
because	c
I	c
knew	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
people	c
and	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
person	c
was	c
Alex	c

the	c
baterist	i
of	c
the	c

You	c
know	c
he	c
is	c

delights	c
me	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
providing	c
you	c
the	i
further	c
informations	i
you	c
asked	c
for	c
:	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
a	c
tent	c
rather	c
than	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
told	c
that	c
the	c
Californiai	i
summer	c
is	c
hot	c
and	c
dry	c
so	c
because	i
a	c
tent	c
's	c
wind	c
circulation	c
is	c
better	c
,	c
it	c
would	c
create	c
a	c
confortable	i
coolness	c
.	c

The	c
two	c
activities	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
do	c
are	c
basketball	c
and	c
surfing	c
.	c

Do	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
bring	c
particular	i
clothing	c
like	i
a	c
surfing	i
suit	i
,	c
for	c
instance	c
?	c

Is	c
any	c
"	c
pocket	c
money	c
"	c
required	c
in	c
case	c
there	c
is	c
something	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
pay	c
for	c
?	c

And	c
finally	c
,	c
is	c
somebody	c
going	c
to	c
fetch	i
me	c
at	c
the	c
airport	c
or	c
am	c
I	c
supposed	c
to	c
get	c
to	c
the	c
camp	c
on	c
my	c
own	c
and	c
get	c
refunded	c
afterwards	c
?	c

Shopping	c
seems	c
to	c
be	c
a	c
true	c
pleasure	c
at	c
first	c
:	c
spending	c
money	c
for	i
yourself	c
or	c
people	c
you	c
appreciate	i
is	c
very	c
satisfying	c
and	c
enjoyable	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
can	c
also	c
be	c
a	c
real	c
nightmare	c
.	c

You	c
often	c
enter	c
a	c
shop	c
and	c
see	c
people	c
everywhere	c
so	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
squeeze	c
yourself	c
through	c
the	c
alleys	i
to	c
take	c
a	c
look	c
at	c
a	c
product	c
.	c

Frustrated	c
,	c
you	c
nevertheless	c
pick	c
something	c
cheaper	c
and	c
advance	c
towards	c
the	c
cashiers	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
finally	c
your	c
turn	c
and	c
you	c
reluctantly	c
hand	c
the	c
money	c
over	c
to	c
the	c
hypocrital	i
cashier	c
.	c

Then	c
,	c
you	c
can	c
rest	c
a	c
little	c
and	c
examine	c
the	c
product	c
a	c
little	c
closer	c
but	c
unluckily	i
,	c
it	c
does	c
not	c
provide	c
the	c
satisfaction	c
you	c
may	c
have	c
wished	c
for	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
enquire	c
about	c
the	c
competition	c
that	c
I	c
won	c
and	c
give	c
some	c
details	c
to	c
you	c
about	c
myself	c
and	c
my	c
interests	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
first	c
place	c
,	c
I	c
prefer	c
to	c
travel	c
on	i
July	c
because	c
my	c
school	c
will	c
not	c
be	c
closed	c
before	c
this	c
date	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
spare	c
time	c
,	c
I	c
enjoy	c
playing	c
basketball	c
with	c
my	c
friends	c
and	c
I	c
also	c
like	c
swimming	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
was	c
in	c
primary	c
school	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
members	c
in	i
swimming-school	i
team	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

It	c
's	c
ages	c
since	c
I	c
've	c
heard	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Last	c
month	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
great	c
time	c
at	c
the	c
concert	c
of	c
"	c
Dragon	c
"	c
which	i
is	c
the	c
most	c
popular	c
hard-rock	i
group	c
all	i
over	i
the	c
world	c
.	c

They	c
had	c
a	c
concert	c
in	c
my	c
hometown	i
that	i
's	c
why	c
the	c
organizators	i
were	c
looking	c
for	c
young	c
people	c
who	c
can	i
speak	c
English	c
.	c

I	c
applied	c
and	c
They	i
took	c
me	c
on	c
.	c

Basicly	i
,	c
I	c
helped	c
them	c
connecting	i
with	c
the	c
local	c
police	c
and	c
getting	i
some	c
electronical	i
equipments	i
that	c
they	c
needed	c
.	c

They	c
treated	c
me	c
as	c
if	c
I	c
was	c
the	c
private	c
secretary	c
of	c
the	c
department	c
,	c
because	c
of	c
this	c
sometimes	c
I	c
felt	c
that	c
the	c
power	c
was	c
in	c
my	c
hands	c
.	c

They	c
gave	c
me	c
two	c
free	c
tickets	c
.	c

Looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

Love	c

Dear	c
manager	i
of	c
the	c
circle	i
theatre	i
,	c

I	c
got	c
very	c
angry	c
because	c
you	c
are	c
liars	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
most	c
disappointing	c
evening	i
of	c
my	c
life	c
.	c

The	c
advertisement	c
said	c
that	c
the	c
actors	c
were	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
but	c
the	c
actor	i
was	i
different	c
.	c

You	c
are	i
really	i
a	c
funny	c
theatre	c
.	c

And	c
the	i
time	c
too	i
.	c

I	c
was	c
waiting	c
for	c
45	c
minute	i
.	i

the	c
show	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
.	c

I	c
paid	c
20	i
pounds	i
without	c
any	c
discount	c
.	c

You	c
said	c
that	c
some	c
discouns	i
was	i
available	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
reastaure	i
I	c
was	c
really	c
suprised	i
.	c

The	i
modern	i
technology	c
help	i
me	c
when	c
I	c
do	c
my	c
homework	c
,	i
to	i
some	i
games	c
e.t.c	i
.	i

First	c
of	c
all	c
the	i
computer	c
.	c

I	c
can	c
find	c
many	c
things	c
from	i
the	c
internet	i
or	c
to	i
write	i
my	c
compositions	c
on	c
it	c
.	c

The	c
car	c
has	c
changed	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
,	c
like	c
everyone	c
else	i
.	c

I	c
can	c
go	c
from	c
one	c
place	c
to	i
other	i
very	c
fast	c

Most	c
of	c
the	c
machines	c
which	c
you	i
have	c
at	c
home	c
help	c
me	c
,	c
too	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
stay	c
home	c
I	c
can	c
watch	c
or	i
listen	c
to	c
the	c
radio	c
e.t.c.	i
so	c
the	i
modern	c
technology	c
help	i
me	c
to	c
spend	c
my	c
free	c
time	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
have	c
seen	c
the	i
modern	c
technology	c
has	c
changed	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
a	c
lot	c
and	c
I	c
believe	c
that	c
it	c
has	c
changed	c
it	c
to	i
the	c
better	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
never	c
been	c
in	i
the	c
U.S.A	c
.	c

Now	c
I	c
will	c
give	c
you	c
the	c
informations	i
which	c
you	c
asked	c
for	c
.	c

That	c
is	c
the	c
only	c
month	c
where	i
I	c
have	c
time	c
because	c
after	c
July	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
start	c
with	i
the	i
University	i
.	c

I	c
have	c
chosen	c
golf	c
because	c
I	c
playing	i
golf	c
sine	i
1998	c
and	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
improve	c
it	i
and	c
then	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
start	c
a	c
new	c
kind	c
of	c
sport	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
start	c
with	i
climbing	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
play	c
in	i
the	i
first	i
week	i
golf	i
and	c
in	c
the	c
second	c
I	c
could	c
start	c
with	i
climbing	c
.	c

What	c
about	c
money	c
and	c
clothes	c
?	c

You	c
know	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
need	c
and	c
could	c
you	c
give	c
some	c
advices	i
how	i
much	c
money	c
I	c
will	c
need	c
?	c

Honestly	c
I	c
had	i
never	i
a	c
shopping	c
tour	i
which	i
I	i
did	i
n't	i
enjoy	i
when	i
I	i
was	i
alone	i
.	c

I	c
can	c
remember	c
one	c
shopping	c
tour	i
which	c
I	c
had	i
with	i
a	c
man	c
and	c
it	c
was	c
nightmare	i
.	c

We	c
left	c
the	c
shop	c
without	c
shoes	i
,	c
in	c
horrible	i
mood	c
and	c
we	c
went	c
home	c
.	c

Now	c
he	c
is	c
my	c
ex.boyfriend	i
!	c

Two	c
days	c
later	c
I	c
went	c
back	c
to	c
the	c
shop	c
and	c
I	c
bought	c
the	c
shoes	c
which	i
I	c
still	c
wear	c
.	c

This	c
was	c
for	c
me	c
the	c
only	c
shopping	c
tour	i
which	c
was	c
not	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
my	c
advise	i
is	c
that	c
the	i
women	c
should	c
go	c
alone	c
or	c
with	c
a	c
female	c
friend	c
.	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

The	c
best	c
dates	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
travel	c
,	i
would	c
be	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
actually	i
I	c
work	c
in	c
the	c
communication	i
firm	i
and	c
I	c
must	c
ask	c
to	i
my	c
employer	c
when	c
I	c
can	c
take	c
holidays	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
from	c
the	c
7	c
July	c
2000	c
to	c
the	c
21	c
July	c
2000	c
.	c

For	i
the	c
accommodation	c
at	c
camp	c
,	c
I	c
prefer	c
in	i
the	c
log	c
cabins	c
,	c
because	c
few	i
years	c
go	c
,	c
I	c
went	c
camping	c
with	c
some	c
friends	c
and	c
every	c
night	c
it	c
rained	c
and	c
in	c
the	c
tent	c
,	i
it	c
was	c
impossible	c
to	c
sleep	c
because	c
the	c
ground	c
was	c
so	c
wet	i
so	i
for	c
this	c
fact	i
,	c
I	c
choose	c
the	c
log	c
cabins	c
.	c

My	c
second	c
choice	c
,	i
it	i
is	c
Basketball	i
.	c

Could	c
you	c
tell	c
me	c
approximatively	i

Your	i
sincerely	c

M.	c
Bruni	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

I	c
'm	c
fine	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
very	c
good	c
experience	c
.	c

After	c
that	c
,	c
at	c
2:00	c
pm	c
,	c
when	c
people	c
arrived	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
at	c
the	c
entrance	c
to	c
take	c
the	c
tickets	c
and	c
you	i
know	c
it	i
was	c
incredibale	i
because	c
some	c
people	c
slept	c
all	c
the	i
night	c
in	c
front	c
of	c
the	c
stadium	c
to	c
be	c
in	c
the	c
front	c
row	c
.	c

When	c
the	c
concert	c
started	c
I	c
had	c
to	i
look	i
round	i
if	c
anybody	c
threw	c
bottles	c
or	c
something	i
else	c
on	c
the	c
scene	i
.	c

I	c
also	c
helped	c
to	c
serve	c
people	c
who	c
would	c
like	c
drink	i
,	i
I	c
was	c
like	c
a	c
barman	c
.	c

If	c
I	c
had	i
an	i
other	i
opportunity	c
to	c
do	c
that	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
I	c
will	c
do	c
.	c

I	c
enjoyed	c
myself	c
very	c
much	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
the	c
organization	c
of	c
the	c
next	c
festival	c
could	c
be	c
better	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
as	c
I	c
see	c
it	c
the	c
idea	c
of	c
an	c
Arts	c
Festival	c
is	c
great	c
because	c
in	c
this	c
way	c
many	c
people	c
can	c
know	i
artists	c
who	c
cames	i
from	c
different	c
countries	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
in	c
the	c
last	c
edition	i
there	i
were	i
artists	c
who	i
cames	i
from	c
only	c
six	c
countries	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
think	c
you	c
should	c
invite	c
artists	c
from	c
other	c
countries	c
,	c
for	c
example	c
from	c
Africa	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
appreciated	c
the	c
fact	c
that	c
there	c
were	c
concerts	c
of	i
different	c
kind	i
of	c
music	c
,	c
but	c
in	c
this	c
case	c
the	c
main	c
problem	c
was	c
that	c
some	c
concerts	i
hall	i
were	c
too	c
small	c
,	c
and	c
because	c
of	c
it	i
I	c
could	c
n't	c
see	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
concerts	c
in	i
programme	i
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
best	c
things	c
of	i
the	c
last	c
Festival	c
was	c
that	c
there	c
were	c
not	c
only	c
concerts	c
.	i

In	i
the	c
next	c
edition	i
will	c
be	i
more	c
or	c
less	c
?	i

I	i
hope	i
more	i
.	c

The	c
thing	c
that	c
I	c
liked	c
much	c
more	c
than	c
others	i
,	i
was	c
that	c
I	c
had	i
to	i
buy	i
only	i
one	c
ticket	c
for	c
all	c
events	i
,	c
and	c
it	c
was	c
no	i
pricey	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
clear	c
that	c
for	c
me	c
the	c
last	c
Festival	c
was	c
really	c
great	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
have	c
only	c
one	c
suggestion	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
,	i
I	c
think	c
you	c
should	c
do	i
a	c
baby-parking	i
,	i
in	i
fact	c
a	c
certain	c
number	c
of	c
women	c
could	c
n't	c
see	c
the	c
Festival	c
because	c
of	c
their	c
sons	i
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	i

I	c
like	c
read	i
very	c
much	c
,	c
because	c
every	c
book	c
that	c
I	c
read	c
shows	c
me	c
a	c
different	c
world	c
.	c

What	c
I	c
try	i
to	c
explain	c
is	c
that	c
in	c
every	c
book	c
there	c
are	c
characters	c
or	c
situations	c
really	i
different	c
.	c

So	c
we	c
can	c
read	c
realistic	c
stories	c
or	c
fantastic	c
,	i
it	i
depends	c
from	i
what	c
we	c
prefer	c
.	c

I	c
always	c
prefer	c
read	i
books	c
that	c
are	c
inusual	i
in	c
some	c
way	c
,	c
because	c
they	c
give	c
me	c
the	c
opportunity	c
of	i
escape	i
from	c
the	i
everyday	c
reality	c
.	c

In	c
this	c
book	c
you	c
can	c
find	c
only	c
good	c
or	c
bad	c
characters	c
,	i
everything	c
is	c
good	c
or	c
bad	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
look	c
at	c
this	c
book	c
like	c
a	c
painting	c
you	c
ca	c
n't	c
see	c
afumature	i
of	c
colours	c
,	c
you	c
see	c
only	c
primary	c
colours	c
.	c

In	c
other	c
words	c
,	c
when	c
I	c
read	c
a	c
book	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
go	c
in	i
a	c
world	c
where	c
I	c
can	c
find	c
something	c
different	c
from	c
my	c
everyday	c
life	c
.	c

I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
show	c
,	i
"	c
OVER	c
THE	c
RAINBOW	c
"	c
a	c
few	c
days	c
ago	c
.	c

With	i
the	c
advertisement	c
,	c
you	c
mentioned	c
Mr.	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Ms.	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
were	c
going	c
to	c
play	i
but	c
actually	c
different	c
people	c
were	c
playing	i
,	c
whom	c
I	c
have	i
never	c
seen	c
before	c
.	c

And	c
also	c
it	c
said	c
it	c
was	c
going	c
to	c
start	c
at	c
19:30	c
but	c
it	c
was	i
not	i
started	i
until	c
20:15	c
.	c

As	i
I	i
am	i
writing	i
,	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
a	c
perfect	c
evening	c
at	c
all	c
but	c
horrible	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
for	c
money	i
back	c
and	c
compensate	i
for	c
my	c
special	c
20th	c
birthday	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
waiting	c
for	i
your	c
reply	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c
.	c

There	c
have	i
been	i
already	c
a	c
variety	c
of	c
fashion	c
style	i
nowadays	c
.	c

Some	c
are	c
in	i
formal	i
others	c
are	c
in	i
casual	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
speaking	c
of	c
sports	c
,	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
remarkable	c
progress	c
has	c
been	c
made	c
in	i
especially	i
swimming	c
costumes	c
and	c
athletes	c
'	c
costumes	i
for	c
Olympic	i
.	c

In	c
addition	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
the	c
earth	c
will	c
be	c
warmer	c
and	c
warmer	i
than	c
now	c
and	c
100	c
year	i
from	c
now	c
will	i
be	i
an	i
Area	i
of	i
Space	i
.	c

So	c
clothes	c
for	c
space	c
will	c
be	c
necessary	c
and	c
clothes	c
for	c
warmer	c
climates	c
will	c
be	c
necessary	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
happy	c
.	c

Actually	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
asked	c
my	c
boss	c
and	c
he	c
gave	i
me	c
two	c
weeks	c
in	i
July	c
.	c

Concerning	c
the	c
activities	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
choose	c
tennis	c
and	c
sailing	c
.	c

I	c
need	c
to	c
know	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
should	c
take	c
with	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forwards	i
to	c
receiving	c
more	c
information	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

The	c
car	i
park	i
of	i
the	i
supermarket	i
is	c
full	c
.	c

No	i
more	c
trolleys	i
for	i
shopping	i
.	c

Some	c
people	c
are	c
in	c
a	c
hurry	c
other	i
are	c
agressive	i
and	c
most	c
of	c
the	c
other	i
are	c
very	c
stressed	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
like	c
that	c
but	c
we	c
often	c
see	c
such	c
a	c
scene	c
,	c
even	c
though	c
shopping	c
is	c
becoming	c
an	c
entertainement	i
not	c
only	c
for	c
teenagers	c
but	c
also	c
for	c
adults	c
.	c

We	c
have	c
more	c
and	c
more	c
shops	c
everywhere	c
and	c
they	c
sale	i
everything	c
.	c

Because	c
of	c
that	c
,	c
people	c
's	c
need	i
has	i
increase	i
a	c
lot	c
nowadays	c
.	c

It	i
is	c
also	c
the	c
reason	c
why	c
we	c
have	c
all	c
these	c
new	c
supermarkets	c
.	c

Sometimes	c
we	c
need	c
them	c
and	c
sometimes	c
we	c
do	c
n't	c
but	c
it	c
is	c
fun	c
to	c
buy	c
new	c
clothes	c
,	c
furniture	c
and	c
so	c
one	i
.	c

In	i
the	i
other	i
hand	i

the	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
which	i
I	c
went	c
to	c
see	c
last	c
week	c
.	c

Besides	c
of	i
this	c
they	c
were	c
not	c
good	c
as	i
actors	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
am	c
quite	c
disappointed	c
.	c

Then	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
had	i
to	c
start	c
at	c
half	c
past	c
seven	c
and	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
wait	c
fourty-five	i
minutes	c
because	c
it	c
started	c
later	i
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
visit	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
and	c
have	c
a	c
good	c
dinner	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
impossible	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
,	c
and	c
now	c
my	c
best	c
friend	c
knows	c
that	c
I	c
will	c
go	c
to	c
visit	c
her	c
next	c
week	c
.	c

Alice	c
is	c
my	c
best	c
friend	c
and	c
we	c
met	c
twenty	c
years	c
ago	c
.	c

We	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
same	c
school	c
and	c
we	c
had	c
the	c
same	c
hobbies	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
perfect	c
because	c
we	c
always	i
were	i
together	c
and	c
doing	c
interesting	c
activities	c
like	c
snow	i
board	i
.	c

But	c
she	c
was	c
very	c
sad	c
because	c
she	c
knew	c
that	c
it	c
will	i
be	c
very	c
difficult	c
to	i
see	c
eachother	i
in	c
the	c
future	c
.	c

I	c
worked	c
hard	c
during	i
one	c
month	c
and	i
I	c
could	c
save	c
money	i
to	c
buy	c
a	c
ticket	i
for	i
the	i
plane	i
.	c

Yesterday	c
she	c
phoned	c
to	i
Alice	c
and	c
explained	c
all	i
.	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writting	i
this	c
letter	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
treatment	c
that	c
we	c
have	i
received	i
when	c
we	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
Circle	c
theatre	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
"	c
whose	i
actors	c
were	c
Anthony	c
Keens	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
the	c
actors	c
were	c
not	c
the	c
same	c
of	i
the	i
advertisement	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
we	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
they	c
were	c
on	c
holidays	i
.	c

This	c
evening	c
was	c
the	c
worst	c
evening	c
of	c
all	i
my	c
life	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
that	i
you	c
give	i
me	c
back	c
some	c
money	c
of	i
the	c
tickets	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
to	i
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

She	c
told	c
our	c
parents	c
that	c
we	c
were	c
going	c
to	c
get	c
married	c
in	c
Brazil	c
.	c

Because	c
of	c
this	c
,	c
Sally	c
's	c
parents	c
and	c
my	c
parents	c
went	c
to	c
Brazil	c
rapidly	i
.	c

It	c
had	c
three	c
bedrooms	c
,	c
two	c
bathrooms	c
,	c
one	c
dining	c
room	c
and	c
one	c
kitchen	c
.	c

Indeed	c
,	c
it	c
had	c
a	c
big	c
swimming	c
pool	c
and	c
a	c
beatiful	i
garden	c
.	c

When	c
my	c
parents	c
arrived	c
in	c
Brazil	c
and	c
found	c
us	c
,	c
our	c
dreams	c
were	c
erased	c
.	c

Because	c
of	c
this	c
,	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
sell	c
the	c
house	c
and	c
left	c
our	c
jobs	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mister	i
Muller	c
,	c

I	c
address	c
this	c
letter	c
to	c
you	c
because	c
as	c
the	c
manager	c
of	c
"	c
The	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
"	c
I	c
hold	c
you	c
responsible	c
for	c
the	c
most	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
in	c
a	c
theatre	c
I	c
had	i
in	c
years	c
.	c

Although	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
scheduled	c
to	c
start	c
at	c
19.30h	c
,	c
it	c
did	c
not	c
begin	c
until	c
20.15h	c
.	c

To	c
my	c
greatest	c
disappointement	i
Danny	c
Brooks	c
was	c
not	c
in	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
but	c
his	c
part	c
was	c
played	c
by	c
an	c
actor	c
whose	c
(	c
lack	c
of	c
)	c
singing	c
and	c
acting	c
skills	c
did	c
not	c
make	c
him	c
a	c
suitable	c
replacement	c
.	c

After	c
the	c
show	c
I	c
had	i
to	i
find	i
out	c
that	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
,	c
that	i
had	c
been	c
recommended	c
to	c
me	c
,	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
it	c
had	c
been	c
booked	c
by	c
a	c
private	c
party	c
.	c

Contrary	c
to	c
your	c
advertisement	c
I	c
had	i
no	i
"	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
"	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
you	c
should	c
return	c
to	c
me	c
at	c
least	c
half	c
of	c
the	c
20	c
Â£	c
I	c
paid	c
for	c
my	c
ticket	c

Dear	c
manager	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
that	c
I	c
stayed	i
very	c
disappointed	c
with	c
the	c
theatre	c
.	c

One	c
of	c
my	c
reasons	c
to	i
travel	i
to	c
London	c
,	i
was	c
this	c
theatre	c
.	c

I	c
knew	i
that	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
"	c
was	c
horrible	c
!	c

I	c
was	c
wrong	c
,	c
very	c
wrong	c
.	c

I	c
bought	c
my	c
tickets	c
fuee	i
days	c
before	c
the	c
theatre	i
thinking	c
I	c
will	i
have	i
discounts	i
.	c

I	c
payed	i
the	c
same	c
as	c
who	i
bought	c
the	c
tickets	c
ten	c
minutes	c
before	c
the	c
theatre	i
.	c

Other	i
thing	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
complement	i
is	i
about	i
the	c
time	c
of	c
the	c
theatre	i
.	c

It	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
starts	i
at	c
half	c
past	c
seven	c
,	c
and	c
it	c
started	i
only	i
at	c
fifteen	c
past	i
eight	c
.	c

After	c
all	c
this	c
,	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
know	c
if	c
I	c
will	c
have	i
some	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
so	c
.	c

yours	c
sincerelly	i

It	c
is	c
true	c
that	c
science	c
and	c
technology	c
affects	c
our	c
lives	c
a	c
lot	c
.	c

The	i
technology	i
is	c
essencial	i
to	c
our	c
life	c
,	c
we	c
need	c
it	c
on	i
each	c
minute	c
,	c
on	i
each	c
second	c
.	c

But	c
it	i
is	c
good	c
and	c
bad	c
in	i
the	c
same	c
time	c
.	c

Good	c
because	c
you	c
can	c
have	c
acess	i
to	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
informations	i
,	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
bad	c
because	c
the	c
computers	c
are	c
getting	i
the	i
people	c
's	c
work	c
.	c

Nowadays	c
we	c
have	c
teachers	c
,	c
and	c
tomorrow	c
?	c

It	c
is	c
interesting	c
to	c
starts	i
to	c
think	c
about	c
this	c
point	c
.	c

Another	c
point	c
is	c
that	c
the	i
television	c
is	c
taking	c
the	i
childhood	c
of	i
the	i
children	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
our	c
parents	c
had	c
time	c
to	c
played	i
with	c
dolls	c
or	c
toys	c
,	c
and	c
the	c
new	c
generation	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
time	c
for	c
this	c
,	c
because	c
they	c
spend	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
time	c
in	c
front	c
of	c
televisions	c
that	c
only	c
shows	i
silly	c
programmes	c
.	c

Sir	c
Robertson	c
,	c

We	c
are	c
very	c
interested	c
in	c
this	c
.	c

Therefore	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
change	c
the	c
program	i
on	c
14th	c
,	c
we	c
would	c
be	c
very	c
happy	c
.	c

We	c
're	c
looking	c
forwold	i
to	c
your	c
reply	c
.	c

Faithfully	i

The	c
Home	c
of	c
the	c
Future	c
.	c

As	c
developing	i
modern	c
society	c
,	c
we	c
will	c
become	c
to	c
have	c
more	c
material	c
than	c
now	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
future	c
we	c
can	c
expect	c
having	i
new	i
material	c
and	c
it	c
will	c
make	c
our	c
living	i
more	c
confortable	i
and	c
convinient	i
.	c

In	c
Japan	c
,	c
crime	c
of	i
minority	i
is	c
increasing	c
.	c

Therefore	c
Japanese	c
architect	i
consider	c
designing	i
of	i
use	i
many	i
glasses	i
as	i
much	i
as	i
they	i
can	i
in	i

and	c
try	c
not	c
to	c
create	c
speparate	i
dark	i
room	i

Otherwise	i
as	i
producing	i
new	i
electoronic	i
,	c
our	c
home	c

will	c
be	c
more	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
inside	i
of	c
the	c
house	c
will	c
be	c
too	i
simple	c
.	c

Although	c
high	i
might	c
be	i
still	i
same	i

Because	c

sound	c
system	c
and	c
our	c
equipment	c
was	c
extraordinary	c
and	c
the	c
audience	c
were	c
fantastic	c
.	c

Now	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
end	c
this	c
letter	c
,	c
so	c
please	c
call	c
me	c
if	c
you	c
want	c
to	c
see	c
me	c
next	c
week	c
.	c

Take	c
care	c

Love	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
to	c
tell	c
that	i
I	c
saw	c
your	c
musical	c
show	c
,,Over	i
the	c
rainbow	i
"	c
and	c
there	c
were	c
too	c
many	c
disappointing	c
divergences	c
between	c
the	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
show	c
and	c
the	c
show	c
itself	c
.	c

The	c
main	c
problem	c
was	c
that	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
did	c
not	c
take	c
part	c
in	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
bought	c
a	c
Â£	c
20	c
ticket	c
mostly	c
because	c
I	c
saw	c
his	c
name	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
only	c
at	c
20:15	c
,	c
although	c
,	i
it	c
had	i
to	c
start	c
at	c
19:30	c
.	c

It	c
seems	c
to	c
me	c
that	c
all	c
these	c
failures	c
were	c
your	c
falt	i
,	c
because	c
you	c
were	c
responsible	c
for	c
the	c
arrangement	i
of	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
conserning	i
that	c
I	c
saw	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
get	c
a	c
half	i
refund	c
.	c

Please	c
reply	c
at	c
your	c
earliest	c
convinience	i
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

When	c
I	c
saw	i
modern	c
technology	c
I	i
mean	c
Internet	i
.	c

My	c
friend	c
lives	c
in	c
Kresnodar	c
.	c

My	c
grandmother	c
lives	c
in	c
Orel	c
,	c
which	c
is	c
much	c
closer	c
to	c
Kursk	c
than	c
Kresnodar	c
.	c

And	c
it	c
takes	c
3	c
days	c
to	i
her	c
letter	c
to	c
get	c
to	c
Kursk	c
.	c

That	c
is	c
because	c
my	c
friend	c
uses	c
e-mail	c
,	c
but	c
my	c
grandmother	c
uses	c
post	i
service	c
.	c

So	c
with	c
Internet	i
I	c
can	c
make	c
friends	c
all	c
over	c
the	c
world	c
and	c
it	c
does	c
not	c
take	c
lots	c
of	c
time	c
.	c

So	c
that	c
I	c
can	c
get	c
books	c
which	c
is	i
impossible	c
to	c
get	c
in	c
libraries	i
of	c
my	c
town	c
.	c

That	c
is	c
why	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
modern	c
techology	i
helps	c
me	c
in	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
.	c

June	c
5	c
,	c
2000	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
on	i
July	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
work	c
and	i
my	c
parents	c
wish	c
to	c
see	c
me	c
in	i
this	c
month	c
,	c
so	c
if	c
it	c
is	c
possible	c
to	c
arrange	c
the	c
date	i
it	i
would	c
be	c
very	c
nice	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
is	i
very	c
cool	c
and	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
learn	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
know	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothe	i
I	c
will	c
need	c
and	c
if	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
money	i
for	i
shops	c
or	c
markets	c
.	c

Looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

Jason	c
Andre	c
.	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

If	c
I	c
go	c
alone	c
is	i
very	c
fast	c
and	c
I	c
enjoy	c
it	c
but	c
if	c
I	c
go	i
with	c
my	c
mother	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
horrible	c
,	c
I	c
will	i
have	c
to	c
do	i
a	c
sacrifice	c
.	c

She	c
will	i
see	c
if	c
it	c
is	c
pretty	c
or	c
not	c
,	c
if	c
it	c
is	c
in	i
discount	i
at	c
other	i
store	c
we	i
will	i
not	c
buy	c
the	c
dress	c
and	c
we	c
will	i
have	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
other	c
store	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
other	c
dress	c
,	c
but	c
at	i
the	i
final	i
of	i
seeing	c
all	c
the	c
stores	c
and	c
looking	c
all	i
the	c
dresses	c
she	c
will	i
decided	i
for	i
the	c
first	c
we	i
saw	c
.	c

Is	i
like	c
a	c
nightmare	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
planning	c
to	c
visit	c
my	c
Mum	c
in	c
Korea	c
in	c
August	c
.	c

I	c
also	c
prefer	c
staying	c
in	c
log	c
cabins	c
to	c
tents	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
once	c
experienced	c
to	i
have	i
been	c
soaked	c
while	c
I	c
was	c
sleeping	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
dut	i
to	c
heavy	c
rain	c
several	c
years	c
ago	c
.	c

Additionally	c
I	i
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
which	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
should	c
prepare	i
.	c

What	c
's	c
the	c
weather	c
like	c
in	c
California	c
?	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

Sorry	c
not	c
to	c
write	c
you	i
for	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
know	c
,	c
I	c
've	c
not	c
been	c
keen	c
on	c
pop	c
music	c
-	c
I	c
've	c
always	c
thought	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
only	c
noisy	c
but	c
also	c
even	c
rubbish	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
really	c
great	c
to	c
have	c
talked	c
with	c
famous	c
pop	c
singers	c
,	c
bands	c
,	c
and	c
TV	c
stars	c
.	c

We	c
usually	c
are	c
apt	c
to	c
think	c
famous	c
stars	c
to	c
be	c
arrogant	c
and	c
nasty	c
,	c
but	c
they	c
were	c
n't	c
at	c
all	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
absolutely	c
our	c
prejudice	c
.	c

They	c
were	c
very	c
kind	c
,	c
soft	c
,	c
well-behaved	c
,	c
even	c
modest	c
.	c

Their	c
attitudes	c
towards	c
people	c
,	c
their	c
costumes	c
,	c
their	c
songs	c
-	c
everything	c
was	c
really	c
fantastic	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
definitely	c
over	c
the	c
moon	c
!	c

I	c
'm	c
writting	i
you	i
because	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
what	c
a	c
bad	c
experience	c
I	c
had	c
during	c
my	c
holidays	c
when	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
play	c
on	c
your	i
theatre	c
.	c

To	c
begin	c
with	c
,	c
the	c
actor	c
you	c
publised	i
was	i
going	c
to	c
perform	c
,	c
did	c
n't	c
.	c

As	i
it	i
was	i
n't	i
enough	i
,	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
I	c
took	c
the	c
risk	c
of	c
going	c
to	c
your	c
restaurant	c
and	c
not	i
very	c
hard	c
to	c
guess	c
I	i
was	c
n't	c
able	c
to	c
enjoy	c
it	c
,	c
as	c
for	i
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
clean	c
enough	c
to	c
sell	i
food	c
,	i
the	c
perfect	c
ending	c
for	i
the	c
perfect	c
evening	c
.	c

Considering	c
all	c
this	c
,	c
and	c
especially	c
the	c
fact	c
that	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
get	c
a	c
discount	c
on	c
my	c
ticket	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
the	c
least	c
you	c
can	c
do	c
is	c
give	c
me	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
to	c
make	c
it	c
up	c
to	c
me	c
,	c
and	c
so	c
I	c
can	c
go	c
an	i
spend	c
the	c
money	c
in	i
a	c
good	c
play	c
when	i
they	c
do	c
what	c
they	c
've	c
promised	c
.	c

People	c
are	c
getting	c
more	c
and	c
more	c
adicted	i
to	c
this	c
,	c
because	c
helps	i
every	i
day	i
life	c
to	i
be	i
easier	c
and	c
more	c
confortable	i
.	c

From	i
a	c
simple	c
domestic	c
appliance	c
,	c
a	c
TV	c
or	c
a	c
radio	c
to	i
a	c
cell	c
phone	c
or	c
a	c
computer	c
,	c
my	c
life	c
is	c
much	c
better	c
now	c
than	c
it	c
was	c
before	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

I	c
'm	c
writting	i
this	c
letter	c
to	c
explain	c
you	i
what	c
had	i
happened	i
and	c
look	i
for	c
a	c
solution	c
.	c

To	c
begin	c
,	c
the	c
organitzation	i
of	c
your	c
collegues	i
of	i
the	c
theatre	c
was	c
awful	c
becouse	i
of	i
diferents	i
problems	i
.	c

Despite	c
saying	c
it	c
will	i
start	c
at	c
19:30	c
,	c
it	c
done	i
at	c
20:15	c
which	i
I	c
think	c
is	c
to	i
much	i
late	c
for	c
a	c
good	c
theatre	c
like	c
yours	c
.	c

After	i
,	c
you	c
say	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
to	i
visit	i
your	c
restaurant	c
,	c
however	c
it	i
was	c
close	i
,	i
how	i
can	c
you	c
explain	c
that	c
?	c

Secondly	c
,	c
there	c
were	i
some	c
false	c
information	c
in	c
your	c
advertisement	c
that	c
made	c
me	c
angry	c
.	c

You	c
say	i
it	c
would	c
be	c
Danny	c
brook	c
the	i
man	i
who	c
was	i
going	i
to	i
sing	i
but	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
.	c

And	c
to	i
sum	i
up	i
,	c
there	c
were	c
n't	c
discounts	i
on	c
the	c
prices	c
of	c
the	c
tickets	c
.	c

Your	i
faithfully	c
,	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
,	c
so	c
without	i
want	i
I	c
knew	c
that	c
it	i
was	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
a	c
concert	c
on	i
owr	i
city	c
of	i
,	c
from	c
my	c
point	c
of	c
view	c
,	c
the	c
best	c
group	c
of	i
the	c
world	c
,	c
Oasis	c
.	c

And	c
she	c
had	c
planned	c
with	c
my	c
friends	c
went	i
there	i
without	c
me	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
a	c
couple	c
of	c
minutes	c
later	c
,	c
I	c
calmed	c
down	c
and	c
asked	c
she	i
why	c
.	c

She	c
answered	c
to	i
me	i
becouse	i
all	c
this	c
year	c
I	i
have	c
been	c
so	c
irritated	i
that	c
I	i
got	c
angry	c
with	c
every	i
person	i
who	c
tried	c
to	c
talk	c
to	c
me	i
,	c
and	i
the	c
others	i
friend	i
had	c
convinced	c
her	c
to	c
let	i
me	i
out	i
.	c

And	c
that	c
's	c
the	c
history	i
of	c
how	c
I	c
lose	i
the	c
oportunity	i
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
only	c
concert	c
that	c
Oasis	c
had	i
done	i
in	c
my	c
city	c
.	c

On	i
the	i
behalf	i
of	i
all	c
the	c
students	c
,	c
I	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
organizing	c
our	c
trip	c
to	c
London	c
and	c
for	c
the	c
really	c
interesting	c
programme	c
you	c
propose	c
to	i
us	c
as	c
well	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
likely	c
to	c
enrich	c
our	c
vocabulary	c
and	c
our	c
knowledge	c
of	c
the	i
English	c
culture	c
...	c

However	c
,	c
we	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
suggest	c
you	i
something	c
:	c

A	c
few	c
days	c
ago	c
,	c
we	c
saw	c
an	c
advertisement	c
about	c
"	c
The	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
"	c
which	i
seems	c
to	c
be	c
very	c
attractive	i
.	c

Therefore	c
,	c
after	c
having	c
talked	c
about	c
it	c
,	c
we	c
all	c
concluded	c
that	c
we	c
would	c
be	c
pleased	c
to	c
go	c
there	c
.	c

What	c
do	c
you	c
think	c
about	c
our	c
jobs	c
?	c

Moreover	c
,	c
you	c
would	c
n't	c
have	c
to	c
worry	c
about	c
the	c
price	c
as	c
it	c
is	c
free	c
for	c
the	i
students	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
agree	c
,	c
we	c
will	c
only	c
have	c
to	c
change	c
the	c
programme	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
afternoon	c
:	c
I	c
mean	c
that	c
instead	c
of	c
shopping	c
,	c
we	c
would	c
go	c
to	c
this	c
exhibition	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
guess	c
that	c
neither	c
us	i
nor	c
you	c
would	c
be	c
against	c
the	c
sacrifice	c
of	c
a	c
"	c
Shopping-Afternoon	c
"	c
-	c
that	c
we	c
can	c
even	c
put	i
on	c
Wednesday	c
during	c
the	i
free-time	i
-	c
so	c
that	c
to	i
enjoy	c
the	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
...	c

Yours	c
faithfully	i

The	c
respect	i
of	c
Famous	c
people	c
's	c
private	c
life	i
has	c
always	c
been	c
a	c
hot	c
topic	c
...	c

The	c
only	c
difference	c
between	c
them	c
and	c
us	c
is	c
the	c
kind	c
of	c
job	c
they	c
are	c
doing	c
which	i
is	c
literally	c
a	c
"	c
public	c
job	c
"	c
.	c

Therefore	c
,	c
why	c
do	c
we	c
have	c
to	c
talk	c
and	c
gossip	c
about	c
them	c
?	c
!	c

But	c
on	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
the	c
aim	c
of	c
a	c
"	c
public	c
job	c
"	c
such	i
as	c
politician	c
or	c
actor	c
is	i
to	c
be	c
known	c
and	c
appreciated	c
by	c
the	c
population	c
.	c

Well	c
,	c
some	c
people	c
would	c
agree	i
whereas	c
others	c
would	c
desagree	i
.	c

I	c
guess	c
this	c
is	c
an	c
unanswerable	c
question	c
...	c

That	i
's	i
as	c
simple	c
as	c
this	i
!	c

Everyone	c
is	c
aware	c
of	c
the	c
celebrity	c
's	c
consequences	i
so	c
,	c
if	c
they	c
really	c
wanted	c
their	c
privacy	c
,	c
why	c
did	c
they	c
choose	c
a	c
"	c
public	c
job	c
"	c
?	c
?	c

Even	c
if	c
anyone	i
deserve	i
to	c
have	c
a	c
private	c
life	c
,	c
famous	i
people	i
know	i
and	i
might	i
have	i
made	i
a	i
mistake	i
...	c

But	c
to	c
solve	c
this	c
problem	c
,	c
we	c
may	i
think	c
first	c
about	c
its	c
origin	c
...	c

Therefore	c
we	c
should	c
try	c
to	c
educate	c
ourselves	c
so	c
as	c
to	c
respect	c
altrui	i
in	i
his	i
privacy	i
.	c

Why	c
not	c
?	c

To	c
conclude	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
say	c
that	c
"	c
privacy	c
"	c
and	c
"	c
celebrity	c
"	c
ca	c
n't	c
go	c
together	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

My	c
name	c
is	c
*	c
*	c
*	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
was	c
completely	c
wrong	c
.	c

I	c
had	i
come	i
with	c
two	c
friends	c
on	c
the	c
21st	c
August	i
,	c
and	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
reasons	c
was	c
that	c
we	c
were	i
big	c
fans	c
of	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
we	c
were	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
watch	i
his	c
show	c
.	c

You	c
can	c
imagine	c
disappointing	i
was	i
to	c
find	c
out	c
that	c
he	c
was	c
replaced	c
by	c
another	c
actor	c
not	i
so	c
popular	c
.	c

We	c
were	c
there	c
at	c
19:15	c
as	i
the	c
show	c
was	c
starting	c
at	c
19:30	c
for	i
getting	i
our	c
tickets	c
.	c

We	c
asked	c
for	c
the	c
discounts	c
you	c
were	i
refering	i
at	i
your	c
advertisement	c
but	c
the	i
counter	c
told	i
us	c
that	c
they	c
were	c
not	c
available	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
Sunday	c
.	c

That	c
was	c
terrible	c
but	c
we	c
did	c
n't	c
want	c
to	c
make	i
a	i
big	i
deal	i
of	i
it	i
so	c
we	c
went	c
inside	c
and	c
waiting	i
.	c

We	c
got	c
really	c
bored	c
waiting	c
.	c

After	c
the	c
show	c
had	i
finished	i
we	c
went	c
for	c
dinner	c
at	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
the	c
owner	c
was	c
ill	c
.	c

Hope	i
you	c
'll	c
understand	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

She	c
went	c
to	c
a	c
new	c
school	c
and	c
she	c
had	c
no	c
friends	c
.	c

Kim	c
explained	c
her	i
that	c
she	c
kept	c
the	i
distance	c
from	c
the	c
other	c
students	c
because	c
her	c
father	c
was	c
in	c
prison	c
and	c
did	i
n't	i
want	i
no	i
one	i
to	c
find	c
out	c
.	c

Pat	c
Kept	i
this	c
a	c
secret	c
for	c
two	c
months	c
but	c
one	c
day	c
told	i
it	c
by	c
accident	c
to	c
a	c
boy	c
from	i
her	c
class	c
.	c

Kim	c
was	c
terrified	i
because	c
everyone	c
was	c
making	c
fun	c
on	i
her	c
and	c
very	i
angry	c
with	c
Pat	c
.	c

Pat	c
had	c
to	c
make	c
up	i
.	i

She	c
had	c
to	c
find	c
a	c
way	c
to	c
make	c
Kim	c
forgive	c
her	c
.	c

She	c
had	i
found	i
the	c
perfect	c
way	c
.	c

Kim	c
forgave	c
her	c
and	c
all	c
the	c
students	c
understand	i
how	c
wrong	c
they	c
were	i
and	c
were	c
very	c
sorry	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
,	c

I	c
saw	c
the	c
show	c
at	c
your	c
theatre	c
with	c
my	c
friend	c
on	c
6th	c
June	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
disappointed	c
with	c
something	i
which	i
did	i
not	i
match	i
your	i
advertisement	i
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
have	c
seen	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
as	c
I	c
am	c
keen	c
on	c
his	c
play	i
.	c

It	c
made	c
me	c
sad	c
.	c

We	c
waited	c
for	c
ages	c
because	c
we	c
had	c
not	c
been	c
informed	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
staff	c
trainning	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
sure	c
you	c
can	c
understand	c
my	c
disappointment	c
.	c

I	c
must	c
insist	c
that	c
you	c
refund	c
the	c
cost	c
of	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

Unless	c
I	c
hear	c
from	c
you	c
within	c
ten	c
days	c
,	c
I	c
shall	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
legal	c
advice	c
on	c
the	i
matter	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

It	c
is	c
believed	c
that	c
our	c
life	i
style	i
has	c
been	c
changed	c
by	c
mordern	i
technology	c
such	c
as	c
computers	c
and	c
washing	c
machine	i
etc.	i
Especially	i
for	c
families	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
found	c
very	i
expensive	c
to	c
buy	c
them	c
but	c
there	c
are	c
number	i
of	c
advantages	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
dishwashers	c
are	c
very	c
effecient	i
for	c
me	c
because	c
I	c
work	c
full	i
time	i
and	c
look	c
after	c
my	c
children	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
very	c
difficult	c
to	c
cook	c
and	c
wash	c
dishes	c
after	c
working	c
.	c

Before	c
buying	c
my	c
dishwasher	c
I	c
asked	c
my	c
son	c
to	c
wash	c
them	c
.	c

He	c
complained	c
about	c
a	i
lot	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
for	i
explaining	i
some	c
problems	c
I	c
had	c
when	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
to	c
see	c
one	c
of	c
your	c
company	c
's	c
musical	c
shows	c
called	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
"	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
the	c
information	c
given	c
in	c
your	c
advertisement	c
was	c
not	c
true	c
at	c
all	c
.	c

Another	c
problem	c
was	c
the	i
start	c
of	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
finished	c
working	i
I	c
had	c
to	c
hurry	i
up	i
because	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
at	c
19:30	c
and	c
it	c
was	c
19:00	c
.	c

For	i
my	i
surprise	i
,	c
when	c
I	c
arrived	c
to	i
the	c
theatre	c
the	c
show	c
still	c
had	c
not	c
started	c
.	c

All	c
of	c
us	c
,	c
who	c
had	c
paid	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
money	c
for	c
those	c
tickets	c
,	c
had	c
to	c
wait	c
long	i
time	c
before	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
,	c
because	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
!	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
the	c
advertisement	c
said	c
we	c
could	c
buy	c
tickets	c
with	i
discounts	i
,	c
but	c
when	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
buy	c
it	i
your	c
employees	c
told	c
me	c
there	c
were	c
no	c
discounts	c
available	c
.	c

When	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
over	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
have	c
dinner	c
to	i
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
but	c
I	c
found	c
it	c
closed	c
because	c
your	c
company	c
is	c
lacked	i
of	i
employees	c
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
what	c
I	c
expected	c
to	c
be	c
"	c
my	c
perfect	c
evening	c
"	c
,	c
as	c
you	c
said	c
in	c
your	c
advertisement	c
,	c
was	c
a	c
very	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
due	c
to	c
the	c
problems	c
I	c
had	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
if	c
I	c
could	c
have	c
some	c
money	c
back	c
for	c
these	c
problems	c
I	c
have	c
told	c

MANUEL	c
SANTOS	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

Two	c
days	c
ago	c
I	c
thought	c
I	c
could	c
trust	c
Pat	c
because	c
she	c
was	c
not	c
going	c
to	c
tell	c
anybody	c
our	c
secret	c
,	c
our	c
important	c
secret	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
alone	c
because	c
Pat	c
had	c
to	c
go	c
with	i
her	i
parents	i
to	i
the	i
cinema	i
.	c

I	c
was	c
boried	i
,	c
so	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
follow	c
him	c
to	c
discover	c
where	c
he	c
was	c
going	c
.	c

He	c
was	c
going	c
down	c
the	c
stairs	c
wearing	c
his	c
blue	c
jacket	c
.	c

"	c
See	c
you	c
tomorrow	c
!	c
"	c

I	c
cried	c
,	c
but	c
he	c
did	c
n't	c
listen	c
to	c
me	c
.	c

Then	c
,	c
while	c
I	c
was	c
going	c
back	c
to	c
my	c
class	i
I	c
saw	c
he	c
had	c
n't	c
switched	c
off	c
the	c
light	c
of	i
his	c
room	c
.	c

I	c
went	c
to	c
switch	c
it	c
off	c
.	c

As	c
soon	c
as	c
I	c
entered	c
that	c
room	c
I	c
realised	c
he	c
had	c
forgotten	i
our	c
exams	c
there	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
n't	c
believe	c
my	c
eyes	c
!	c

The	c
exams	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
next	i
day	c
were	c
there	c
.	c

Without	i
thinking	i
it	i
twice	i
,	c
I	c
took	c
one	c
of	c
them	c
and	c
went	i
quickly	i
home	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
to	c
phone	c
Pat	c
to	c
tell	c
her	c
which	c
were	i
the	i
questions	i
of	i
the	i
exam	i
.	c

When	c
I	c
told	c
her	c
this	i
piece	i
of	i
news	c
,	c
she	c
got	i
surprised	c
.	c

We	c
thought	c
we	c
should	c
n't	c
tell	c
it	i
anybody	c
else	c
.	c

Next	c
day	c
in	i
the	c
morning	c
,	c
before	c
the	c
exam	c
,	c
we	c
were	c
going	c
to	c
put	c
the	c
exam	c
back	c
with	c
the	c
other	c
exams	c
.	c

Next	c
day	c
,	c
everybody	c
knew	c
about	c
my	c
great	c
finding	i
because	c
Pat	c
had	c
n't	c
kept	c
our	c
secret	c
.	c

The	c
problem	c
was	c
that	c
my	c
teacher	c
also	c
knew	c
it	i
because	c
someone	c
had	c
told	c
him	c
"	c
the	c
story	c
of	c
the	c
exams	i
"	c
,	c
as	c
he	c
called	c
my	c
big	c
problem	c
.	c

First	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
able	i
to	i
come	i
only	i
in	c
July	c
,	c
because	c
my	c
examination	c
session	c
is	c
due	c
from	c
the	c
24	c
June	c
till	c
26	c
June	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
be	c
accomodated	i
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
as	c
do	i
not	c
like	c
sleeping	c
on	c
the	i
mattres	i
and	c
I	c
get	c
allergy	i
to	c
rubber	c
.	c

From	c
the	c
listed	c
activities	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
choose	c
singing	c
,	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
my	c
hobby	c
and	c
I	c
also	c
sing	c
in	c
local	i
chorus	i
.	c

I	c
won	c
third	c
prize	c
in	c
competition	i
organized	c
by	c
our	c
college	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Is	c
shopping	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
?	c

I	c
like	c
shopping	c
very	c
much	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
some	c
people	c
complain	c
that	c
there	c
are	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
artificial	c
products	c
,	c
which	c
are	c
quite	c
unhealthy	c
,	c
but	c
very	c
expensive	c
.	c

The	c
second	c
thing	c
I	c
like	c
about	c
shopping	c
is	c
the	c
possibility	c
to	c
find	c
your	c
own	c
style	c
buying	i
clothes	c
in	c
the	c
small	c
boutiques	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
someone	c
else	c
may	c
say	c
,	c
it	c
takes	c
too	c
much	c
time	c
.	c

The	c
third	c
reason	c
I	c
enjoy	c
shopping	c
is	c
that	c
I	c
never	c
go	c
alone	c
just	c
to	c
buy	c
a	c
thing	c
I	c
need	c
.	c

I	c
always	c
take	c
my	c
friend	c
with	c
me	c
so	c
we	c
can	c
chat	c
or	c
have	c
coffee	c
in	c
the	c
shop	c
's	c
cafe	c
.	c

I	c
recently	c
had	c
a	c
week	c
's	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
and	c
during	c
my	c
stay	c
I	c
came	i
to	c
your	c
threatre	i
to	c
see	c
the	i
"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
.	c

My	c
evening	c
was	c
very	c
disappointing	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
advertisment	i
,	c
I	c
had	c
read	c
that	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
was	c
starring	c
but	c
she	i
was	c
not	c
.	c

The	c
play	c
should	c
start	i
at	c
19.30	c
but	c
it	c
started	c
forty-five	c
minutes	c
later	c
,	c
we	c
were	c
waitting	i
over	i
there	c
with	i
out	i
doing	i
anything	i
.	c

After	c
the	c
show	c
had	c
finished	c
I	i
went	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurand	i
to	c
hav	i
something	c
to	c
drink	c
and	c
get	i
relaxed	i
but	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
the	c
stuff	i
was	c
on	c
holiday	c
.	c

Moreover	c
the	c
discounts	c
were	c
not	c
available	c
as	c
you	c
say	i
in	c
the	c
advertisment	i
and	c
I	c
paid	c
Â£	c
20	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
some	i
refand	i
because	c
It	i
was	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
worst	c
evenings	c
in	i
my	c
life	i
it	i
if	i
this	c
matter	c
does	i
not	c
solve	i
I	i
will	c
go	i
further	i
.	c

He	c
and	c
his	c
friends	c
got	c
in	i
trouble	c
because	c
of	c
this	c
habit	c
,	i
last	c
week	c
.	c

As	c
they	c
were	c
watching	c
T.V	i
at	c
Nick	c
's	c
house	c
last	c
Sunday	c
,	c
Sally	c
noticed	c
that	c
their	c
cut	i
Curly	c
was	c
hurt	c
,	c
she	i
could	c
not	c
walk	c
.	c

The	c
children	c
were	c
very	c
unhappy	c
and	c
sorry	i
about	i
the	c
pet	c
.	c

"	c
We	c
have	c
to	c
find	c
him	c
and	c
make	c
him	c
pay	c
for	c
his	c
action	c
"	c
Sally	i
told	c
them	c
.	c

"	c
Yes	c
,	c
Oh	i
Lord	c
he	c
did	c
it	c
because	c
we	c
won	i
his	c
team	c
at	c
football	c
"	c
Nick	i
said	c
.	c

We	c
will	c
pay	c
Curly	c
's	c
doctor	i
with	c
these	i
money	c
that	c
we	c
will	i
earn	i
"	c
Pat	i
said	c
.	c

and	c
told	i
him	i
"	i
Hey	c
,	c
you	c
.	c

We	c
know	c
what	c
you	c
have	c
done	c
and	c
your	c
dog	c
will	c
be	c
sold	c
"	c
.	c

Bad	c
Jon	c
understood	c
and	c
talked	c
immediately	c
to	c
his	c
father	c
.	i

who	c
was	c
the	c
school	c
minister	i
about	c
the	c
children	i
'	i
plan	c
.	c

Of	c
course	c
they	c
were	c
punished	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
the	c
good	c
programme	c
which	c
you	c
have	c
organised	c
.	c

There	c
is	c
only	c
one	c
thing	c
we	c
do	c
n't	c
agree	c
with	c
you	c
,	i
it	c
is	c
the	c
Tuesday	i
14	c
March	c
.	c

and	c
we	c
would	c
all	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
this	c
show	c
.	c

It	c
would	c
be	c
very	c
special	c
for	c
us	c
because	c
we	c
have	c
n't	c
seen	c
something	i
like	c
that	c
before	c
.	c

The	c
show	c
is	c
not	c
as	c
expensive	c
as	c
the	c
Science	c
Museum	c
because	c
the	i
entry	c
of	i
the	c
show	c
is	c
free	c
for	c
students	c
.	c

You	c
see	c
,	c
the	c
programme	c
has	i
only	i
to	c
be	c
changed	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
morning	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
afternoon	c
we	c
go	c
shopping	c
how	i
you	c
have	c
organised	c
in	i
your	c
programme	c
.	c

In	c
our	c
opinion	c
;	i
it	c
is	c
enough	c
to	c
go	c
one	c
time	c
in	i
a	c
museum	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
on	c
Wednesday	c
.	i

your	c
English	c
Class	c
4A	c

Now	c
,	c
we	c
are	c
in	c
the	c
21th	i
century	c
.	c

Most	c
of	c
us	c
live	c
in	c
houses	c
or	c
flats	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
most	i
very	c
comfortable	c
.	c

What	c
will	c
be	c
different	c
and	c
what	c
wont	i
change	c
?	c

We	c
can	i
need	c
our	c
imagination	c
for	i
answering	i
these	c
questions	c
but	c
we	c
will	c
never	c
know	c
the	c
right	c
answer	c
.	c

The	i
life	i
at	c
home	c
will	c
be	c
more	i
easy	i
because	c
a	i
refrigerator	c
which	c
fill	i
up	i
itself	i
or	c
a	c
bathroom	c
which	c
clean	i
itself	c
.	c

These	c
things	c
and	c
a	c
lot	c
more	c
went	i
change	c
or	c
wont	i
be	c
forgotten	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
.	i

This	c
is	c
my	c
idea	c
and	c
we	c
will	c
see	c
!	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

Last	c
night	c
,	c
me	c
and	c
my	c
family	c
visited	c
your	c
theatre	c
,	c
and	c
we	c
had	c
a	c
very	c
disappointing	c
evening	c

In	c
the	c
advertisement	c
the	c
time	c
when	c
the	c
show	c
should	c
start	c
was	c
19.30	c
but	c
it	c
started	c
20:15	i
.	c

The	c
whole	c
show	c
and	c
acting	i
was	c
an	i
profeccion	i
like	i
scholl	i
theatre	c
.	c

After	c
evrything	i
what	i
happend	i
we	c
went	c
to	c
hotel	i
tipped	i
and	i
very	i
affect	i
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

Alexy	c
Pasimov	c

For	i
the	c
last	c
one	c
hundred	c
years	c
science	c
and	c
technology	c
did	i
big	i
step	c
if	i
we	c
looking	i
to	i
back	c
.	c

Same	i
thing	i
more	c
then	i
100	c
years	c
ego	i
the	i
people	c
have	i
n't	i
got	i
the	c
light	c
.	i

From	c
small	i
village	c
to	c
town	i
was	c
very	i
long	c
way	c
becouse	i
the	i
people	c
used	c
horse	i
and	c
wagon	c
.	c

And	c
look	c
at	c
now	i
.	c

Evry	i
family	c
has	i
now	i
T.V.	i
,	c
to	c
travel	c
for	i
long	c
distance	i
we	c
using	i
not	c
just	c
car	i
and	i
elso	i
train	i
and	c
airplain	i
.	c

Before	c
we	c
have	i
phantasy	i
about	c
how	c
people	c
travel	i
to	c
other	c
planets	c
,	c
and	c
what	c
we	c
see	c
now	c
spaceship	i
cruising	c
in	c
the	i
open	i
space	c
.	c

In	i
the	i
most	c
part	i
of	c
our	c
life	i
entering	i
computer	i
.	c

Before	c
it	c
was	c
only	c
emegination	i
.	c

New	c
techology	i
more	i
our	c
life	i
more	c
comfortable	c
and	c
esee	i
.	c

We	c
have	c
had	c
a	c
quite	c
pleasant	c
time	c
except	c
the	i
evening	c
.	c

Actually	c
it	c
spoiled	c
our	c
time	c
.	c

These	c
are	c
some	c
points	c
I	c
want	c
mention	i
about	c
the	c
differencies	i
between	c
the	i
advertisement	c
said	c
and	c
the	c
realities	c
.	c

First	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
great	c
expectation	c
to	c
see	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
plays	i
his	c
role	c
,	c
but	c
he	c
had	c
never	c
shown	c
up	c
that	c
night	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
a	i
such	i
disappointing	i
.	c

Second	c
,	c
it	c
started	i
only	i
at	c
20:15	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
45	c
minutes	c
later	c
than	c
it	c
suppose	i
to	c
be	c
.	c

The	c
girl	c
sold	i
the	c
tickets	c
was	c
laughing	c
at	c
me	c
when	c
I	c
mention	i
about	c
the	i
discounts	c
availability	c
was	c
written	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
.	c

Forth	i
,	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

How	c
could	c
you	c
arrange	c
work	c
like	c
that	c
?	c

Finally	c
the	i
sentence	c
was	i
written	c
blow	i
down	i
on	c
the	c
advertisement	c
was	c
absolutely	c
not	c
true	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
most	i
imperfect	c
evening	c
out	c
I	c
ever	c
exprienced	i
.	c

Sincerely	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

Secondly	c
the	c
language	c
ability	c
was	c
another	c
issue	c
.	c

Even	c
I	i
could	c
meet	c
some	c
friend	c
,	c
but	i
I	c
could	c
n't	c
express	c
my	c
heat	i
to	c
them	c
for	i
we	c
have	c
different	c
back	i
ground	i
and	c
our	c
first	c
language	i
were	c
different	c
.	c

Finally	c
I	c
met	c
Pat	c
.	c

She	c
was	c
a	i
such	i
wonderful	c
person	c
in	c
our	c
class	c
.	c

She	c
tried	c
to	c
help	c
others	c
when	c
they	c
have	i
difficult	i
time	c
at	c
school	c
.	c

One	c
day	c
she	c
invited	c
me	c
to	c
her	c
flat	c
.	c

We	c
had	c
a	c
fantastic	c
time	c
together	c
for	c
three	c
monthes	i
.	c

We	c
had	c
many	c
common	c
interests	c
in	c
music	c
,	c
art	c
and	c
books	c
.	c

There	c
were	c
some	c
stories	c
I	c
never	c
told	c
anyone	c
before	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
had	i
share	i
with	c
her	c
all	c
my	c
secrets	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
nightmare	c
!	c

What	c
a	c
lovely	c
opportunity	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
America	c
!	c

About	c
the	c
information	c
you	c
asked	c
me	c
for	c
,	c
the	c
most	c
suitable	c
month	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
travel	c
would	c
be	c
July	c
,	c
since	c
it	c
is	c
when	c
I	c
am	c
free	c
for	i
traveling	i
due	i
to	i
I	c
wo	c
n't	c
have	c
classes	c
at	c
school	c
by	c
that	c
time	c
.	c

In	i
the	c
matter	c
of	c
accommodation	c
I	c
'd	c
rather	i
prefer	c
log	i
cabins	i
,	c
because	c
I	c
consider	c
them	c
better	c
for	c
resting	c
and	c
know	i
people	c
.	c

I	c
love	c
nature	c
and	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
record	c
the	c
Californian	c
landscapes	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
something	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
.	c

How	c
warm	c
is	c
California	c
in	c
those	i
days	i
?	c

Another	c
thing	c
,	c
should	c
I	c
have	i
to	i
take	i
my	c
camera	c
with	c
me	c
for	c
the	c
activity	c
at	c
the	c
Camp	c
?	c

I	c
'd	c
appreciate	c
any	c
further	c
information	c
you	c
can	c
give	c
me	c

It	c

a	c

Dear	c
Mrs.	c
Ryan	c
,	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
the	c
letter	c
which	c
I	c
have	c
received	c
with	c
a	i
great	c
delight	c
and	c
excitement	c
.	c

And	c
if	c
it	c
is	c
possible	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
rather	c
than	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
because	c
I	c
find	c
tents	c
uncomfortable	c
to	c
sleep	c
in	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
been	c
playing	c
Tennis	c
for	c
many	c
years	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
my	c
favourite	c
sport	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
done	c
surfing	c
before	c
but	c
I	c
have	c
always	c
wanted	c
to	c
learn	c
how	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
and	c
I	c
believe	c
this	c
would	c
be	c
my	c
best	c
chance	c
to	c
do	c
so	c
.	c

Before	c
I	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
Camp	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
what	c
type	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
take	c
and	c
wheather	i
there	c
is	c
anything	c
I	c
should	c
take	c
in	c
case	c
of	c
any	c
emergencies	c
.	c

Also	c
the	c
amount	c
of	c
money	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
bring	c
(	c
is	i
there	c
any	c
shops	c
)	c
.	c

And	c
finally	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
to	c
send	c
me	c
some	c
pictures	c
of	c
the	c
place	c
as	c
I	c
am	c
dying	c
to	c
know	c
what	c
it	c
is	c
like	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
few	i
of	c
the	c
lukiest	i
people	c
from	c
my	c
school	c
to	c
be	c
picked	c
up	i
to	c
help	c
at	c
the	c
pop	c
concert	c
which	c
took	c
place	c
in	c
my	c
town	c
.	c

Me	c
and	c
my	c
friends	c
were	c
very	c
excited	c
,	c
not	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
stage	c
decoration	c
but	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
pop	c
sigers	i
and	c
bands	c
whom	c
we	c
will	i
be	c
able	c
to	c
see	c
!	c

People	c
were	c
carrying	c
big	c
boxes	c
around	c
which	c
contained	c
electrical	c
equipments	i
for	c
the	c
concert	c
.	c

We	c
were	c
all	c
given	c
different	c
sort	i
of	c
jobs	c
to	c
do	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
very	c
interesting	c
and	c
we	c
enjoyed	c
doing	c
it	c
very	c
much	c
.	c

However	c
the	c
best	c
part	c
was	c
watching	c
and	c
listening	c
to	c
the	c
singers	c
and	c
bands	c
practicing	i
on	c
the	c
stage	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
the	c
best	c
day	c
of	c
my	c
life	c
and	c
certainly	c
for	c
others	c
,	c
too	c
.	c

Love	c
from	c

However	c
,	c
Dany	c
Brook	c
did	c
not	c
act	c
and	c
was	c
replaced	c
by	c
another	c
actor	c
who	c
was	c
terribly	c
disappointing	c
on	i
his	c
performance	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
,	c
the	c
event	i
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
start	c
at	c
19.30	c
but	c
we	c
could	c
not	c
enjoy	c
the	c
show	c
until	c
20.15	c
.	c

The	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
show	c
announced	c
that	c
we	c
were	i
able	c
to	c
visit	c
the	c
Theatre	c
restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
due	i
to	i
the	c
Chef	c
who	c
leaded	i
the	c
Restaurant	c
did	c
not	c
remember	c
to	c
bring	c
the	c
keys	c
to	c
open	c
it	c
.	c

Also	c
,	c
the	c
advertisement	c
said	c
that	c
discounts	c
for	i
the	c
tickets	c
would	c
be	c
available	c
,	c
but	c
it	i
was	i
not	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
and	c
she	c
told	c
her	c
mother	c
what	c
had	c
happened	c
during	c
the	c
concert	c
.	c

Peter	c
had	c
a	c
terribly	i
problem	c
with	c
drugs	c
.	c

He	c
had	c
problems	c
at	c
home	c
because	c
his	c
mother	c
wanted	c
to	c
settle	c
down	c
to	i
Australia	c
,	c
but	c
Peter	c
was	c
used	c
to	c
live	i
in	c
New	c
York	c
,	c
overcrowded	i
and	c
surronded	i
by	c
people	c
.	c

Australia	c
is	c
a	i
country	i
too	i
calm	i
for	c
him	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
he	c
began	c
to	c
run	c
around	c
the	c
crowd	c
and	c
also	c
to	c
hit	c
the	c
advertisements	c
which	c
announced	c
the	c
concert	c
.	c

A	c
security	c
guard	c
saw	c
it	i
and	c
put	i
his	c
attention	c
on	i
him	c
.	c

Pat	c
stared	c
at	c
him	c
and	c
asked	c
for	c
help	c
.	c

The	c
security	c
guard	c
heard	c
her	c
and	c
agreeded	i
with	c
Pat	c
that	c
if	c
Peter	c
continued	c
acting	c
on	i
this	c
way	c
he	c
would	c
obliged	i
us	c
to	c
go	i
out	i
of	i
the	c
concert	c

Dear	c

accomodation	i
I	c
would	c
rather	c
stay	c
in	c
tent	i
because	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
the	c
best	c
way	c
to	c
socialize	c
.	c

For	i
what	i
concernes	i
the	c
activities	c
I	i
think	c
that	c
swimming	c
and	c
climbing	c
are	c
the	c
most	c
suitable	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
had	i
a	c
course	c
of	i
climbing	c
even	c
though	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
take	c
up	c
this	c
hobby	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
something	c
about	c
the	c
weather	c
and	c
clothes	c
I	c
should	c
bring	c
not	i
to	c
have	c
to	c
buy	c
anything	c
there	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
know	c
whether	c
meals	c
are	c
included	c
or	c
not	c
in	i
the	c
accomodation	i
so	c
that	c
I	c
could	i
decide	c
how	c
much	c
I	c
must	c
have	c
with	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

I	c
bet	c
you	c
want	c
to	c
know	c
everything	c
about	c
my	c
great	c
experience	c
at	c
Luna	c
Pop	c
's	c
concert	c
last	c
month	c
.	c

Before	c
that	c
I	c
had	c
never	c
thought	c
I	c
would	c
play	c
with	c
a	c
famous	c
group	c
.	c

But	c
maybe	c
you	c
want	c
to	c
hear	c
the	c
story	c
from	c
the	c
beginning	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
know	c
Luna	i
Pop	c
is	c
not	c
my	c
favourite	c
group	c
and	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
their	c
concert	c
only	c
because	c
Ake	c
needed	c
being	i
accompanied	c
.	c

When	c
we	c
arrived	c
she	c
persuaded	c
me	c
to	c
go	c
the	i
backstage	c
because	c
her	c
boyfriend	c
was	c
the	c
electrician	i
of	i
the	i
band	i
.	c

Unfortunately	c
what	c
I	c
found	c
was	c
n't	c
what	c
I	c
expected	c
.	c

After	c
that	c
I	c
tried	c
to	c
tell	c
them	c
I	c
had	c
just	c
begun	c
but	i
within	c
five	c
minutes	c
I	c
was	c
on	c
the	c
stage	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
playing	c
that	c
,	c
luckily	c
,	c
easy	c
tune	c
.	c

I	i
think	i
you	i
ca	i
n't	i
believe	i
in	i
what	c
I	c
've	c
told	c
you	c
but	c
I	c
wo	c
n't	c
forget	c
this	c
experience	c
.	c

Love	c

Mafalda	c

I	c
am	c
so	c
happy	c
to	c
know	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
asked	c
me	c
to	c
send	c
you	c
further	c
information	c
about	c
three	c
points	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
sending	c
you	c
my	c
preferences	c
as	c
follows	c
:	c

1.	c
-	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
long	i
cabins	i
rather	c
than	c
tents	i
,	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
much	c
more	c
comfortable	c
.	c

3.	c
-	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
travel	c
only	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
at	c
the	c
moment	c
I	c
am	c
alone	c
at	c
home	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
care	c
of	c
my	c
little	c
sister	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
,	i
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
do	i
I	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
with	c
me	c
and	c
How	i
much	c
money	c
will	c
I	c
need	c
as	i
well	i
?	c

Thanks	c
in	c

for	c
you	i
advice	c

yours	c
sinicrely	i

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
what	c
an	c
impressing	i
experience	c
I	c
have	c
had	c
,	i
helping	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
.	c

I	c
will	c
start	c
telling	i
you	c
how	c
crowded	c
it	c
was	c
,	c
the	i
people	c
was	i
so	c
excited	c
that	c
they	c
were	c
screaming	c
from	c
the	c
beginning	c
to	c
the	c
end	c
.	c

I	c
cleared	c
the	c
stage	c
before	c
the	c
concert	c
,	c
but	c
you	c
do	i
n't	i
imagine	c
how	i
it	c
looked	c
like	c
after	c
it	c
?	c
!	c
!	c
!	c
full	c
of	c
flowers	c
,	c
T.	i
shirts	i
,	c
hats	c
,	c
underwear	c
,	c
etc	c
etc	c
etc.	c
I	c
did	i
n't	i
feel	c
my	c
feet	c
the	c
next	c
day	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
tired.	c
!	c
!	c

Anyway	c
,	c
I	c
also	c
laughed	c
a	c
lot	c
,	c
the	c
music	c
was	c
fantastic	c
,	c
and	c
the	c
stars	c
were	c
really	c
nice	c
to	c
every	i
one	i
.	c

I	c
tried	c
to	c
take	c
a	c
photo	c
of	c
everyone	c
,	c
but	c
sometimes	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
possible	c
.	c

I	c
will	c
send	c
you	c
a	c
copy	c
of	c
the	c

17th	c
June	c
2000	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

I	c
read	c
your	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
show	c
and	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
wonderful	c
evening	c
by	c
visiting	i
it	c
.	c

I	c
believed	c
in	c
the	c
phrase	c
by	i
which	c
the	c
advertisement	c
ended	c
:	c
'	c
Your	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
!	c
'	c

The	c
show	c
should	c
started	i
at	c
half	c
past	c
7	c
pm	c
but	c
nothing	c
happened	c
.	c

I	c
waited	c
and	c
it	c
becomes	i
8	c
o'clock	c
pm	c
-	c
nothing	c
happened	c
.	c

At	c
quarter	c
past	c
8	c
pm	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
looking	c
for	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
.	c

The	c
problem	c
came	c
.	c

The	c
restaurant	c
,	c
which	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
visit	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
for	i
eating	i
something	c
,	c
was	c
closed	c
without	c
any	c
explaination	i
and	c
the	c
perfect	c
evening	c
was	c
completely	c
unperfect	i
.	c

I	c
think	c
this	i
are	c
reasons	c
enough	c
for	i
enquiring	i
about	c
some	i
money	c
back	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
be	c
gladly	i
to	c
get	c
an	c
answer	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Faithfully	c
,	c

Bergut	c
Hunrtner	c

What	c
will	c
we	c
wear	c
100	c
years	c
from	c
now	c
?	c

Do	c
you	c
remember	c
what	c
people	c
wore	c
100	c
years	c
ago	c
?	c

And	c
by	c
the	c
way	c
do	i
you	c
believe	c
that	c
they	c
also	c
thought	c
the	c
fashion	c
never	c
changed	c
?	c

Often	c
you	c
show	c
your	c
skin	c
because	c
its	i
popular	c
and	i
everyone	c
do	i
it	c
.	c

So	c
it	i
's	i
possible	c
to	c
wear	c
nothing	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
.	c

A	c
lot	c
of	c
thinks	i
will	c
be	c
easier	c
to	c
do	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
winter	c
you	c
'll	c
freeze	c
.	c

But	c
this	c
problem	c
is	c
solving	c
by	i
itselfes	i
.	c

The	c
clothes	c
you	c
'll	c
wear	c
will	c
be	c
very	c
extraordinary	c
because	c
of	c
their	c
special	c
kind	i
of	c
producing	i
.	c

Think	c
about	c
this	c
idea	c
and	c
perhaps	c
you	c
'll	c
understand	c
it	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
possible	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

Your	c
advertisement	c
was	i
featuring	i
"	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
"	c
as	c
the	c
main	c
characters	c
but	c
in	c
fact	c
some	c
other	c
people	c
replaced	c
them	c
that	c
evening	c
.	c

The	c
time	c
mentioned	c
on	c
the	c
tickets	c
was	c
19:30	c
however	i
the	i
show	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
.	c

After	c
the	c
show	c
we	c
tried	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
your	c
restaurant	c
but	c
unfortunately	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
for	c
renovation	c
!	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
disappointed	c
of	i
my	c
supposed	c
"	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
"	c
to	i
your	c
theatre	c
and	c
due	i
to	i
all	c
the	c
above-mentioned	c
reasons	c
I	c
am	c
asking	c
for	c
a	c
complete	c
refund	c
on	c
the	c
two	c
attached	c
tickets	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

MODERN	c
TECHNOLOGY	c

From	c
ancient	c
times	c
up	c
to	c
now	c
this	i
science	c
has	c
allowed	c
the	c
world	c
and	c
human-beings	i
to	c
develop	c
positively	c
and	c
negatively	c
.	c

Back	c
in	c
the	c
30's	i
the	c
different	c
governments	c
invented	c
guns	c
,	c
battleships	c
and	c
all	c
kinds	c
of	c
weapons	c
for	c
their	c
armies	c
.	c

The	i
military	i
technology	c
has	c
affected	c
our	c
lives	c
more	c
than	c
what	i
we	c
think	c
because	c
most	c
of	c
the	c
equipments	i
we	c
use	c
were	i
originally	c
created	c
by	c
those	c
people	c
.	c

The	c
fast	i
and	i
growing	c
computer	c
industry	c
is	c
giving	i
us	c
less	c
and	c
less	c
physical	c
work	c
due	i
to	i
a	i
mechanical	i
concept	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
keen	c
on	c
technology	c
because	c
I	c
believe	c
it	c
should	c
improve	c
our	c
lives	c
however	i
I	i
dislike	c
the	c
idea	c
that	c
such	c
a	c
science	c
might	c
fall	c
or	c
had	i
already	c
fallen	c
in	i
wicked	c
hands	c
.	c

The	c
advertised	c
beginning	i
time	i
is	c
19:30	c
.	c

But	c
due	i
to	i
some	c
unknown	c
reasons	i
,	c
the	c
play	c
did	c
n't	c
start	c
until	c
20:15	c
.	c

The	c
audience	c
were	c
anxious	c
and	c
bored	c
.	c

What	c
made	c
things	c
even	c
worse	c
was	c
that	c
the	c
leading	c
actor	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
did	c
not	c
appear	c
at	i
the	c
stage	c
at	c
all	c
.	c

A	i
second-class	i
actor	i
took	c
the	i
place	i
of	i
him	i
.	c

We	c
felt	c
totally	c
disappointed	c
and	c
cheated	c
.	c

After	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
hungry	c
and	c
tired	c
.	c

As	c
your	c
poster	c
suggested	c
,	c
I	c
intended	c
to	c
rest	c
for	c
a	c
while	c
at	c
your	c
restaurant	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
,	c
the	c
conductor	i
did	c
n't	c
offer	c
me	c
any	c
discounts	c
as	i
you	c
had	c
advertised	c
in	i
the	c
poster	c
when	i
I	c
bought	c
the	c
ticket	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
sorry	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
I	c
do	i
not	c
enjoy	c
the	c
evening	c
at	c
your	c
theatre	c
at	c
all	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
waiting	c
for	c
your	c
reply	c

When	c
you	c
are	c

to	c

you	c
can	c

Dear	c
Mr.	i

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
this	c
prize	c

I	c
'm	c
really	c
ecited	i
and	c
emotions	i
.	c

Answering	i
your	c
reguest	i
you	i
asked	i
me	i
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
only	c
July	i
because	c
,	i
in	i
fact	i
.	i

I	i
ll	i
be	c
on	c
vacation	c
until	c
August	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
this	i
is	c
the	c
best	c
month	c
to	c
travel	c
.	c

In	c
base	i
of	i
your	c
activities	c
option	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
say	c
that	c
climbing	c
is	c
one	c
of	c
my	c
first	c
option	i
,	c
as	c
I	c
've	c
mentioned	c
and	i
I	c
really	c
think	c
that	c
photography	c
will	c
help	c
me	c
in	c
my	c
other	c
adventures	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
if	c
we	c
need	c
money	i
for	i
paying	i
or	i
baying	i
something	i
because	c
you	c
did	c
n't	c
specify	c
what	c
is	c
included	c
in	c
the	c
trip	c
,	c
such	c
as	c
food	c
.	c

I	c
really	c
apreciate	i
this	c
kind	c
of	c
trip	c
and	c
I	c
'm	c
really	c
thank	i
your	i

...	c
a	c
great	c
and	c
emotion	i
statement	c
,	c
do	c
n't	c
you	c
think	c
?	c

But	c
the	c
question	c
is	c
:	c
Why	i
shopping	i
is	i
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
?	c
.	i

Let	c
's	c
talk	c
about	c
women	c
;	c
nightmare	c
!	c
women	i
ca	c
n't	c
resist	c
the	c
fact	i
of	c
shopping	c
and	c
they	c
are	c
dissapointed	i
when	c
they	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
the	c
wants	i
to	c
shop	c
.	c

The	i
shopmania	i
is	c
really	c
unstapped	i
.	c

There	c
are	c
many	c
facts	c
to	c
prove	c
that	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
"	c
pretty	c
and	c
armonious	i
"	c
,	c
but	i
believe	c
me	c
,	c
is	i
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
becaus	i
I	c
was	c
very	c
disappointing	i
with	c
the	c
presentation	i
you	c
have	c
made	i
to	c
attract	c
people	c
to	c
come	c
to	c
your	c
theatre	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
I	i
came	c
to	c
see	c
a	i
play	c
just	c
becaus	i
my	c
faivourite	i
actrice	i
shoud	i
of	i
been	c
part	i
in	c
it	c
,	c
but	c
she	c
did	i
n't	i
.	c

The	c
evening	i
time	i
on	c
a	i
tiket	i
was	c
19.30	c
and	c
actually	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
20.15	c
which	i
made	i
visitors	c
stay	i
in	c
a	i
plase	i
for	c
45	c
min	i
,	c
waist	i
of	c
time	c
.	c

The	c
tickets	i
discounts	c
was	i
not	c
available	c
under	c
any	c
subconstanses	i
and	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

I	c
strongly	c
do	i
recomand	i
your	i
to	c
pay	c
minimum	i
50	c
%	c
of	c
the	c
full	c
price	c
for	i
what	i
I	i

I	c
think	c
that	c
in	c
100	c
years	c
from	c
now	c
,	c
the	c
clothes	c
fashion	c
will	c
be	c
totaly	i
different	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
apineon	i
the	c
world	c
by	i
it	i
self	i
will	c
be	c
different	c
in	c
temperature	c
cased	i
by	i
global	c
warming	c
as	i
well	i
as	i
people	c
become	i
more	i
niceer	i
,	c
less	c
will	i
take	c
place	c
,	c
so	c
the	c
clothes	c
will	c
mainly	c
be	c
maid	i
from	c
cotton	c
with	c
smooth	i
colours	c
like	c
dark	c
grean	i
or	c
gray	i
.	c

It	i
will	c
be	c
comfotable	i
close	i
becaus	i
the	c
main	c
point	c
for	c
any	c
caind	i
of	c
clothe	i
is	c
to	c
be	c
comfatable	i
.	c

The	c
stile	i
will	c
be	c
more	c
or	c
less	c
simelar	i
to	i
each	c
other	c
and	c
everyon	i
will	c
be	c
setisfaid	i
with	c

About	c
accommodation	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c

last	c
year	c
I	c

and	c
my	c
back	c
is	i
enjure	i
,	c
so	c
sleeping	c

would	c
be	c
painful	c
for	c
me	c

Due	c
to	c
my	c
back	c
enjure	i

this	c
year	c
I	c
could	c
not	c

my	c

,	c
so	c
I	c
am	c
not	c
fit	c
,	i
it	i
would	c
be	c
a	c
good	c
aidea	i
to	c
be	c
a	c
referee	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
swim	c
everyday	c
if	c
is	i
able	i

Could	c
you	c
please	c
let	c
me	c
know	c
where	c
will	i
I	i

if	i
will	i
there	i

how	i
many	i

for	c
those	c
two	c
weeks	c

And	c
please	c
could	c
you	c
give	c
me	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

It	c
was	c
brilliant	c
!	c

I	c
had	c
the	c
best	c
month	c
in	i
my	c
life	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
hard	c
month	c
because	c
my	c
job	c
was	c
very	c
hard	c
,	i
I	c
worked	c
12	c
hours	c
per	c
day	c
but	c
alwalys	i
with	c
funny	i
people	c
.	c

My	c
job	c
was	c
cleaning	c
the	c
ground	i
after	c
the	c
concert	c
;	c
"	c
it	c
was	c
very	c
dirty	c
"	c
.	c

I	c
felt	i
in	c
love	c
with	c
a	c
beautiful	c
girl	c
"	c
Calen	c
"	c
,	i
she	i
is	c
from	c
Spain	c
and	c
was	c
selling	c
"	c
hot	c
dogs	c
"	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
next	c
summer	c
because	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
Spain	c
to	c
help	c
in	i
"	c
Doctor	c
Meesee	c
"	c
that	i
is	c
the	c
best	c
concert	c
in	c
the	c
world	c
,	i
I	c
hope	c
you	c
will	c
come	c
there	c
.	c

Love	c

I	c
'm	c
writting	i
this	c
letter	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
I	c
saw	c
during	c
my	c
stay	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

This	c
show	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
be	c
a	c
perfect	c
event	c
but	c
actually	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
very	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
.	c

How	c
could	c
that	c
happen	c
?	c

I	c
also	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
why	c
the	c
musical	i
show	c
started	c
at	c
a	c
quarter	c
past	c
eight	c
instead	c
of	c
half	c
past	c
seven	c
.	c

I	c
really	c
do	c
understand	c
that	c
problems	c
can	c
always	c
come	c
up	c
but	c
it	c
would	c
not	c
have	c
been	c
a	c
problem	c
for	c
me	c
as	i
long	i
as	i
I	c
had	c
been	c
informed	c
about	c
it	c
.	c

Of	c
course	c
discounts	c
were	c
not	c
available	c
either	c
,	c
and	c
the	c
restaurant	c
where	c
we	c
were	c
supposed	c
to	c
eat	c
afterwards	c
was	c
closed	c
without	c
any	c
explanation	c
at	c
all	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
what	c
should	c
have	c
been	c
a	c
nice	c
evening	c
out	c
came	i
to	i
a	c
nightmare	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
:	c

Modern	c
technology	c
has	c
actually	c
changed	c
my	c
life	c
quite	c
a	c
lot	c
.	c

Firstly	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
talk	c
about	c
computers	c
.	c

A	c
couple	c
of	c
years	c
ago	c
I	c
bought	c
a	c
new	c
computer	c
and	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
learn	c
all	c
about	c
them	c
.	c

If	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
communicate	c
with	c
a	c
friend	c
in	c
Australia	c
I	c
just	c
have	c
to	c
send	c
him	c
an	c
e-mail	c
which	i
is	c
going	c
to	c
get	c
to	c
my	c
fellow	i
in	c
a	c
while	i
.	c

Is	c
n't	c
that	c
amazing	c
?	c

I	c
should	c
not	c
forget	c
mobile	c
phones	c
.	c

If	c
I	c
feel	c
like	c
talking	c
to	c
a	c
friend	c
I	c
just	c
have	c
to	c
call	c
him	c
and	c
whereever	i
he	c
is	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
get	c
through	c
to	c
him	c
.	c

Several	c
european	i
companies	c
like	c
Nokia	c
or	c
Ericsson	c
are	c
focusing	c
on	c
mobiles	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
told	c
that	c
in	c
a	c
couple	c
of	c
years	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
possible	c
to	c
send	c
and	i
e-mail	c
either	c
from	c
the	i
computer	c
or	c
from	c
the	i
mobile	c
which	i
is	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
great	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
extremly	i
happy	c
because	c
not	c
only	c
do	c
I	c
earn	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
money	c
but	c
also	c
I	c
'm	c
learning	c
a	c
lot	c
.	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
know	i
USA	i
.	c

For	c
it	i
the	c
only	c
one	i
that	c
I	c
can	c
travel	c
is	c
July	c
.	c

And	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
log	i
cabins	i
because	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
bear	c
sleeping	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
,	i
I	c
hate	c
this	i
kind	c

I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
play	c
Tennis	i
and	c
swimming	i
these	i
are	c
my	c
favourite	c
sports	c
.	c

I	c
can	c
play	c
tennis	c
better	c
I	i
can	c
swim	c
,	c
because	c
since	c
I	c
was	c
I	i
child	c
I	c
've	c
been	c
practising	i
it	c
.	c

I	c
've	c
already	c
Won	i
three	c
prizes	c
about	i
it	c

And	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
about	i
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
to	c
take	c
and	c
how	c

Yours	c
Sincerely	i

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

I	c
love	c
shopping	c
mainly	c
when	c
I	c
am	c
alone	c
on	i
when	c
I	c
am	c
angry	c
because	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
can	c
help	c
me	c
to	c
relax	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
got	i
plenty	c
of	c
money	c
sometimes	c
I	c
like	c
spend	i
a	c
bit	c
of	c
it	c
with	c
some	c
friends	c
or	c
buying	c
a	c
good	c
present	c
for	c
my	c
girl	i
friend	i
.	c

Normally	c
I	c
spend	c
money	c
buying	c
some	c
new	c
clothes	c
that	c
I	c
like	c
more	i
and	c
shoes	c
I	i
love	c
new	c
shoes	c
.	c

One	c
good	c
idea	c
to	i
go	c
to	i
shopping	c
is	i
when	c
you	c
got	i
plenty	c
of	c
money	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
recently	c
recieved	i
your	c
letter	c
that	i
I	c
have	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
the	c
competition	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
very	c
fortuanate	i
of	i
me	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
Camp	c
California	c
in	c
the	c
USA	c
only	c
in	c
July	c
as	c
it	c
is	c
my	c
summer	c
holidays	c
.	i

It	c
will	c
be	c
convenient	c
for	c
me	c
then	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
two	c
months	i
holiday	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
in	c
the	c
team	i
for	i
tennis	i
at	c
school	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
played	c
against	c
different	i
other	c
schools	c
before	c
.	c

About	c
the	c
accommodation	c
at	c
the	c
Camp	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
tents	c
because	c
I	c
love	c
to	c
be	c
outside	c
and	c
I	c
like	c
dangerous	c
adventures	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
about	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
bring	c
and	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
have	c
bring	i
.	c

Will	c
there	c
be	c
any	c
shops	c
?	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
shopping	c
can	c
be	c
both	c
enjoyable	c
and	c
unenjoyable	c
because	c
sometimes	c
the	c
shops	c
are	c
full	c
of	c
people	c
,	c
especially	c
at	c
the	c
weekends	c
which	i
normally	c
is	c
the	c
only	c
appropreaite	i
time	c
!	c

The	c
clothes	c
are	c
quite	c
expensive	c
and	c
they	c
are	c
never	c
your	c
size	c
.	c

I	c
like	c
to	c
look	c
at	c
the	c
beautiful	c
clothes	c
and	c
I	c
dream	c
of	c
wearing	c
them	c
.	c

I	c
find	c
that	c
shopping	c
is	c
a	i
very	c
good	c
exercise	c
as	c
well	c
!	c

By	c
the	c
time	c
you	c
have	c
completed	c
the	c
whole	c
High	c
Street	c
,	c
you	c
will	c
be	c
out	c
of	c
breath	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
agree	c
that	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
because	c
of	c
crowded	c
shops	c
and	c
the	c
price	c
of	c
clothes	c
but	c
I	c
am	c
sure	c
that	c
the	c
majority	c
of	c
people	c
do	c
like	c
shopping	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
sure	c
that	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
,	i
there	c
will	c
be	c
no	c
more	c
crowded	c
streets	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
'	c
internet	i
'	i
which	i
you	c
can	c
order	c
onlines	i
.	c

Maybe	c
we	c
will	c
have	c
robots	c
to	c
do	c
the	c
shopping	c
for	c
us	c
in	c
the	c
future	c

Shooping	i
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

We	c
all	i
have	i
been	c
shooping	i
once	c
in	c
our	c
lifes	i
and	c
sometimes	c
it	c
probably	c
has	c
not	c
been	c
very	c
enjoyable	c
,	c
why	c
?	c
we	i
had	c
a	c
class	c
discussion	c
and	c
we	c
all	c
agree	c
in	i
some	c
points	c
.	c

Sometimes	c
we	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
our	c
little	c
brothers	c
with	c
us	c
,	c
because	c
our	c
mother	c
is	c
n't	c
home	c
,	c
and	c
then	i
is	c
where	i
the	c
problems	c
begin	c
.	c

Most	c
of	c
the	c
times	i
one	i
get	i
lost	c
,	c
or	c
they	c
start	c
plaing	i
around	c
,	c
making	c
noise	c
,	c
bothering	c
people	c
,	c
etc	c
...	c

So	c
if	c
you	c
want	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
good	c
relaxing	i
shooping	i
day	i
,	c
we	c
recommend	c
you	c
not	i
to	i
go	i
with	c
your	c
little	c
brothers	c
and	c
to	c
go	c
with	c
enogh	i
time	c
to	c
look	c
arround	i
for	c
what	c
you	c
really	c
want	c

Now	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
explain	c
the	i
problems	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
very	c
disappointing	c
for	c
me	c
that	c
the	c
actor	c
was	c
n't	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
how	i
it	i
was	c
told	i
in	c
the	c
advertisment	i
.	c

It	c
was	i
also	i
told	i
that	c
the	c
evening	c
shows	c
are	i
starting	i
19.30	i
,	c
but	c
it	c
started	c
20.15	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
to	c
buy	c
a	c
Â£	c
20	c
ticket	c
because	c
discounts	c
were	c
not	c
available	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
will	c
answer	c
my	c
letter	c
and	c
correct	i
the	c
problems	c
in	i
your	c
theatre	c
.	c

At	i
first	i
you	c
have	c
to	c
define	c
what	c
is	c
meant	c
by	c
'	c
modern	c
technology	c
'	c
.	c

For	c
me	c
modern	c
technology	c
are	i
things	c
like	c
personal	c
computers	c
,	c
mobile	c
phones	c
,	c
keyboards	c
,	c
video	c
recorders	c
,	c
Hifi	i
sound	c
systems	c
,	c
television	c
or	c
even	c
cars	c
.	c

My	c
oppinion	i
is	c
that	c
modern	c
technology	c
can	c
help	c
you	c
to	c
save	c
time	c
.	c

If	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
training	c
I	c
need	c
not	c
wait	c
for	c
the	c
bus	c
,	c
and	c
so	c
I	c
need	c
not	c
start	c
one	c
and	c
a	c
half	c
hour	i
before	c
training	c
I	i
start	c
a	i
half	i
hour	c
before	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
save	c
one	c
hour	c
,	c
which	c
I	c
can	c
use	c
for	c
other	c
hobbies	c
or	c
for	c
homework	c
or	c
something	c
else	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
I	c
can	c
save	c
time	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
think	c
every	i
body	i
should	c
use	c
his	i
saved	i
time	i
for	c
things	c
like	c
hiking	c
,	c
walking	c
,	c
swimming	c
,	c
for	c
a	c
"	c
natural	c
life	c
"	c
and	c
not	c
for	c
a	c
life	c
in	c
a	c
technical	c
world	c
with	c
stress	c
and	c
sorrows	c
because	c
we	c
are	c
humans	c
and	c
not	c
robots	c
.	c

I	c
recently	c
visited	c
your	c
theatre	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
"	c
over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
"	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
disappointed	c
because	c
the	c
actors	c
was	i
n't	i
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
.	c

Instead	c
of	c
them	c
you	c
had	c
different	c
actors	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
to	c
wait	c
45	c
minutes	c
!	c

If	c
you	c
ca	c
n't	c
give	c
me	c
all	c
the	c
money	c
back	c
then	c
do	c
it	c
particularly	i
.	c

I	c
give	i
you	c
my	c
phone	c
number	c
,	c
you	c
can	c
reach	c
me	c
from	c
8	c
o'clock	c
till	c
12	c
o'clock	c

How	c
has	c
modern	c
technology	c
changed	c
your	c
daily	c
life	c
?	c

Modern	c
technology	c
has	c
changed	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
in	c
the	c
point	i
that	c
all	i
I	c
do	c
is	c
becoming	c
more	i
comfortable	i
.	c

I	c
use	i
also	i
the	c
internet	i
when	c
I	c
need	c
any	c
informations	i
for	i
example	c
I	i
need	c
them	i
for	c
school	c
or	c
private	i
for	i
myself	c
.	c

Most	i
that	i
took	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
the	c
advantage	c
of	c
modern	c
technology	c
is	c
that	c
all	i
I	c
do	c
goes	c
very	c
fast	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
more	c
time	c
for	c
my	c
hobbys	i
or	c
for	c
friends	c
.	c

And	c
also	c
a	c
good	c
intention	i
for	c
me	c
is	c
the	c
Handy	i
,	c
because	c
everywhere	c
I	c
go	c
I	c
can	c
talk	c
to	c
other	c
people	c
.	c

They	i
were	c
Kevin	c
Starr	c
and	c
Jessica	c
Richmond	c
.	c

For	c
me	c
,	c
this	c
a	c
big	c
mistake	c
.	c

This	c
event	i
was	c
not	c
the	c
only	c
one	c
because	c
another	c
problem	c
was	c
the	i
respect	i
of	i
the	c
time	c
.	c

Your	c
advertisement	c
said	c
that	c
the	c
show	c
will	i
start	c
at	c
19:30	c
PM	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
has	i
started	i
at	c
20:15	c
PM	c
.	c

The	c
fourth	c
problem	c
was	c
that	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
be	c
open	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
but	c
once	c
again	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
lie	c
because	c
the	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
for	c
renovation	c
.	c

After	i
that	i
,	c
I	c
can	c
tell	c
you	c
that	c
I	c
spend	i
the	c
worst	c
evening	c
in	c
all	c
my	c
life	c
at	c
your	c
show	c
and	c
that	c
one	c
more	c
time	c
your	c
advertisement	c
lied	c
about	i
"	c
You	c
will	c
have	c
a	c
perfect	c
evening	c
!	c
"	c

After	c
all	c
these	c
explanations	i
,	c
I	c
am	c
sure	c
that	c
you	c
will	c
understand	c
that	i
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
have	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
and	c
that	c
I	c
was	c
disappointed	c
last	c
night	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
wish	i
to	i
hear	i
soon	i
about	i
you	i
.	c

Yours	c
sincerly	i

How	c
has	c
modern	c
technology	c
changed	c
your	c
daily	c
life	c
?	c

Modern	c
technology	c
,	c
such	c
as	c
computer	i
,	c
car	i
and	c
other	c
else	i
,	c
changed	i
my	c
life	c
in	c
many	c
different	c
ways	c
like	i
communication	c
,	c
traveling	i
and	c
working	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
a	c
car	c
,	c
which	c
is	c
used	c
from	i
everyone	c
everyday	i
,	c
changed	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
in	c
the	c
sens	i
that	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
need	c
my	c
dad	c
or	c
my	c
mum	c
to	c
go	c
to	i
ice-skating	c
or	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
work	c
.	c

I	c
can	c
do	c
it	c
by	c
myself	c
and	c
for	c
me	c
it	c
is	c
important	c
not	c
only	c
because	c
of	c
the	i
technology	c
,	c
but	c
because	c
I	c
can	c
show	c
that	c
I	c
am	c
responsable	i
.	c

With	c
this	c
car	c
I	c
can	c
see	c
the	c
world	c
,	c
not	c
exactly	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
can	c
travel	c
and	c
visit	c
other	c
countries	c
that	i
Switzerland	c
.	c

This	c
a	i
big	i
walk	i
in	i
the	i
technology	c
and	c
I	c
can	c
say	c
that	c
it	c
is	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
for	c
me	c
because	c
I	c
like	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
friends	c
.	c

At	i
last	i
technology	i
that	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
bring	i
out	i
is	c
the	c
TV	c
.	c

This	c
is	c
a	c
good	c
one	c
because	c
you	c
can	c
see	c
what	c
is	c
happening	c
around	c
you	c
and	c
everywhere	c
else	c
on	c
Earth	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Ryan	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
information	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
if	c
it	c
is	c
possible	c
to	c
travel	c
to	c
this	c
Camp	i
on	i
July	c
because	c
for	c
me	c
it	c
is	c
the	c
best	c
time	c
and	c
I	c
can	i
not	i
travel	c
before	c
or	c
after	c
according	i
to	c
my	c
employer	c
.	c

From	c
the	c
activities	c
I	i
choose	c
Basketball	i
and	i
Golf	i
.	c

But	c
in	i
Golf	i
I	c
am	c
a	c
beginner	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
if	c
it	c
is	c
necessary	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
take	c
some	c
clothes	c
with	c
me	c
for	c
the	c
sport	i
activities	c
?	c

For	c
example	c
:	c
you	c
need	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
money	c
each	c
month	c
for	c
shopping	c
,	c
and	c
a	c
part	c
of	c
this	c
money	c
is	c
only	c
for	c
buying	c
the	c
necessaryiest	i
things	c
like	c
bread	c
and	c
other	c
things	c
to	c
eat	c
.	c

I	c
enjoy	c
shopping	c
when	c
I	c
can	c
buy	c
some	c
clothes	c
.	c

Also	c
a	c
problem	c
while	i
the	i
shopping	c
is	c
that	c
most	c
there	i
are	c
so	i
many	c
people	c
and	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
traffic	c
in	c
all	c
shopping-centres	i
.	c

All	c
the	c
people	c
are	c
there	c
most	i
on	c
the	c
same	c
day	c
because	c
there	c
are	c
not	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
other	c
possibilities	i
for	c
shopping	c
while	i
the	c
week	c
for	c
the	i
employees	i

Dear	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
so	c
marvellous	i
about	c
winning	c
the	c
competition	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
answering	i
what	i
you	i
would	i
like	i
to	i
know	i
some	i
information	i
from	i
me	i
.	c

Thirdly	c
I	c
keen	i
on	c
playing	c
tennis	c
and	c
taking	c
some	c
photography	i
.	c

In	c
spite	c
of	c
the	c
fact	c
that	c
the	c
weathe	i
is	c
bad	c
,	c
I	c
play	c
tennis	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Bae	c
Ki	c
Seul	c

I	c
like	c
speaking	c
activity	c
while	c
I	c
am	c
in	c
the	c
class	c
.	c

During	c
that	c
time	c
I	c
can	c
talk	c
some	i
secret	c
things	i
or	i
private	i
with	c
class-mates	i
.	c

Other	i
lesson	i
,	c
the	c
teacher	c
teaches	c
lots	c
of	c
things	c
which	c
are	c
grammer	i
,	c
English	c
culture	c
...	c
etc.	c
It	c
might	c
be	c
good	c
.	c

However	c
all	i
students	i
are	c
passive	c
.	c

So	c
it	c
can	c
be	c
boring	c
.	c

give	i
a	c
topic	c
and	c
then	c
discussion	i
about	i
it	c
.	c

It	i
is	i
real	i
life	i
who	i
we	i
are	i
.	c

Also	c
the	c
film	c
must	c
be	c
funny	c
.	c

If	c
a	c
film	c
is	c
boring	c
,	c
nobody	c
will	c
see	i
it	c
.	c

During	c
speaking	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
lots	c
of	c
happening	i
such	c
as	c
,	c
some	c
students	c
ca	c
n't	c
understand	c
what	c
the	c
other	c
students	c
say	c
and	c
their	c
culture	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
happy	c
to	c
win	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
.	i

-	c
two	c
weeks	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
in	c
the	c
U.S.A.	c
I	c
am	c
also	c
very	c
excited	c
about	c
it	c
.	c

This	c
is	c
the	c
only	c
month	c
that	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
free	c
.	c

I	c
will	c
be	c
in	c
italy	i
in	c
August	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
be	i
appreciate	c
it	c
if	c
I	c
could	c
stay	c
in	c
tents	i
at	c
Camp	i
.	c

I	c
really	c
like	c
staying	i
in	c
tents	c
.	c

It	i
is	i
also	c
written	i
in	c
your	c
letter	c
that	c
we	c
will	c
have	c
to	i
chance	i
to	c
do	c
two	c
activities	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
really	c
good	c
at	c
playing	c
tennis	c
and	c
singing	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
been	c
playing	c
tennis	c
for	c
five	c
years	c
and	c
I	c
love	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
play	c
the	c
classicial	i
guitar	c
and	c
I	c
also	c
sing	c
songs	i
.	c

I	c
wonder	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
tell	c
me	c
about	c
the	c
wheather	i
and	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
have	i
to	c
bring	c
with	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
also	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
need	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

Second	i
answer	c
is	c
that	c
the	i
shopping	c
makes	c
everyone	c
happy	c
.	c

If	c
I	c
get	c
bored	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
stay	c
at	c
home	c
and	c
I	c
feel	c
going	i
shopping	c
.	c

Sometimes	c
it	c
can	c
be	c
nightmare	c
if	c
you	c
ca	c
n't	c
find	c
something	c
that	c
you	c
are	c
looking	c
for	c
.	c

I	c
went	c
shopping	c
last	c
week	c
with	c
my	c
friend	c
she	i
needed	c
to	c
buy	c
a	c
nightdress	c
.	c

We	c
spent	c
for	i
three	c
hours	c
and	c
we	c
could	c
n't	c
buy	c
anything	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
incredibly	c
crowded	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
are	c
in	c
a	c
hurry	c
,	c
do	c
n't	c
go	c
shopping	c
!	c

It	c
is	c
not	c
really	c
good	i
idea	c
to	c
go	c
shopping	c
if	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
enough	c
time	c
.	c

Imagine	c
you	c
have	c
three	c
children	c
and	c
you	c
are	c
going	c
shopping	c
with	c
them	c
.	c

I	c
can	c
tell	c
you	c
how	c
bad	c
situation	i
you	c
are	c
in	c
because	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
child	c
I	c
always	c
had	c
an	i
argument	i
with	c
my	c
mother	c
about	c
shopping	c
.	c

I	c
can	c
remember	c
how	c
upset	c
I	c
was	c
if	c
my	c
mother	c
did	c
n't	c
buy	c
what	c
I	c
wanted	c
and	c
how	c
much	c
I	c
cried	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
very	c
ashameful	i
for	c
my	c
mum	c
.	c

Because	c
she	c
never	c
managed	c
to	c
get	c
me	c
out	c
from	i
the	c
toy	c
shop	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
see	c
shopping	i
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Ryan	c
,	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
wonderful	c
surprise	c
!	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
the	c
information	c
you	c
wanted	i
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
you	c
asked	c
me	c
about	i
the	i
period	i
I	c
'd	c
prefer	c
to	c
travel	c
:	i
For	c
me	c
,	c
the	c
only	c
solution	i
is	c
July	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
've	c
already	c
something	c
planned	c
in	c
August	c
.	c

I	c
chose	c
tennis	c
and	c
golf	c
.	c

Althoug	i
I	c
've	c
been	c
playing	c
tennis	c
for	c
five	c
years	c
,	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
say	c
I	c
'm	c
a	c
very	c
good	c
player	c
.	c

And	c
I	c
'm	c
even	c
worse	c
at	c
golf	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
've	c
never	c
been	i
playing	i
it	c
before	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
to	c
this	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
be	c
grateful	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
send	c
me	c
information	i
on	c
these	c
few	c
details	i
:	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
is	i
required	c
?	c

How	i
is	i
the	i
weather	i
at	c
this	i
period	i
of	c
the	c
year	c
?	c

And	c
should	c
I	c
take	c
some	c
money	c
with	c
me	c
?	c

How	c
much	c
?	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
will	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
answer	c
my	c
questions	c

Cry	c
Freedom	c
"	c

If	c
you	c
are	c
used	c
to	c
reading	c
a	c
lot	c
,	c
you	c
know	c
there	c
are	c
only	c
a	c
few	c
books	c
about	c
which	c
you	c
can	c
say	c
:	c
'	c
This	c
is	c
such	c
a	c
marvellous	c
book	c
I	c
will	c
want	c
to	c
read	c
it	c
again	c
'	c
.	c

But	c
why	c
should	c
we	c
read	c
this	c
book	c
twice	c
?	c

The	c
political	c
and	c
historical	c
background	c
is	c
very	c
interesting	c
,	c
but	c
also	c
complicated	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
the	c
main	c
reason	c
why	c
someone	c
has	c
to	c
read	c
this	c
book	c
twice	c
is	c
the	c
strength	c
and	c
depth	c
of	c
the	c
two	c
main	c
characters	c
:	c
Donald	c
Woods	c
and	c
Steve	c
Biko	c
.	c

Just	c
as	i
the	c
Greeks	c
and	c
the	c
Romans	c
,	c
our	c
modern	c
society	c
has	c
mythes	i
,	c
and	c
"	c
Cry	c
Freedom	c
"	c
is	c
one	c
of	c
them	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
show	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
,	c
which	c
was	i
played	i
in	c
the	c
"	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
"	c
,	c
because	c
the	c
information	c
which	c
was	c
given	c
in	c
your	c
advertisement	c
was	c
not	c
true	c
at	c
all	c
.	c

So	c
the	c
main	c
point	i
of	c
my	c
visit	c
had	c
dissappeared	i
.	c

Another	c
point	c
is	c
the	c
time	c
when	c
it	c
started	c
,	c
exactly	c
45	c
minutes	c
later	i
.	c

A	c
serious	c
theatre	c
ca	c
n't	c
miss	i
such	i
an	c
important	c
thing	c
,	c
the	c
starting-time	i
.	c

I	c
had	c
to	c
wait	c
all	c
that	c
time	c
in	c
the	c
street	c
,	c
because	c
the	c
hall	c
was	c
not	c
big	c
enough	c
.	c

In	c
your	c
advertisement	c
you	c
informed	c
us	c
about	i
their	c
false	c
existence	c
.	c

But	c
there	c
is	c
still	c
another	c
point	c
:	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
where	c
I	c
had	c
decided	c
having	i
supper	c
was	c
closed	c
,	c
without	c
saying	i
the	c
reason	c
.	c

Summing	c
up	c
,	c
you	c
might	c
have	c
noticed	i
that	c
that	c
was	c
n't	c
"	c
my	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
"	c
wich	i
you	c
promised	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
you	c
to	c
give	c
me	c
the	c
money	c
I	c
paid	c
for	c
the	c
ticket	c
back	c
.	c

This	c
might	c
be	c
the	c
only	c
way	c
I	c
keep	c
on	c
relying	c
on	c
your	c
theatre	c
.	c

yours	c
faithfully	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
,	c
and	c
because	c
of	c
this	c
Pat	c
caused	c
a	c
big	c
,	c
but	c
stupid	c
problem	i
.	c

It	c
was	c
late	c
in	c
the	c
night	c
,	c
and	c
Pat	c
was	c
thinking	c
about	c
something	c
Nick	c
had	c
told	c
her	c
that	c
afternoon	c
:	c
-	c
"	c
Do	c
n't	c
tell	c
Marie	c
I	c
was	c
here	c
"	c
.	c

Nick	c
was	c
Marie	c
's	c
boyfriend	c
,	c
and	c
Marie	c
a	i
very	c
good	c
friend	c
of	c
hers	c
.	c

That	c
morning	c
Marie	c
had	c
told	c
her	c
that	c
Nick	c
could	c
n't	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
cinema	c
with	c
her	c
because	c
he	c
had	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
work	c
to	c
do	c
in	c
the	c
afternoon	c
so.	c
.	c

what	c
was	c
he	c
doing	c
there	c
with	c
that	c
girl	c
?	c

Marie	c
was	c
so	c
shocked	c
that	c
,	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
Pat	c
had	c
stopped	c
speaking	c
,	c
she	c
phoned	c
Nick	c
and	c
,	c
without	c
letting	c
him	c
say	c
anything	c
,	c
she	c
broke	c
up	c
their	c
relation	i
.	c

Nick	c
was	c
there	c
because	c
the	c
following	c
Sunday	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
very	c
special	c
day	c
for	c
him	c
:	c
he	c
would	c
have	c
been	c
going	c
out	c
with	c
Marie	c
for	c
three	c
years	c
,	c
and	c
he	c
wanted	c
to	c
buy	c
a	c
present	c
for	c
her	c
.	c

But..what	c
about	c
the	c
girl	c
?	c

She	c
was	c
his	c
cousin	c
!	c

She	c
works	c
as	c
a	c
model	c
,	c
and	c
she	c
was	c
advicing	i
him	c
about	c
which	i
clothes	c
,	c
etc	c
,	c
...	c
buy	i
for	c
her	c
.	c

Pat	c
could	c
n't	c
keep	c
that	c
secret	c
,	c
and	c
in	c
spite	c
of	c
helping	c
Marie	c
,	c
she	c
made	c
a	c
couple	c
disappear	i
.	c

London	c
,	c
1st	c
of	c
June	c
2000	c

Mister	c
Jones	c
,	c

I	c
decided	c
to	c
enjoy	i
a	c
play	c
at	c
the	c
theatre	c
wich	i
you	c
're	c
the	c
manager	c
to	c
see	c
the	i
"	c
London	c
's	c
newest	c
and	c
best	c
musical	c
show.	c
"	c

My	c
opinion	c
?	c

I	c
had	c
a	c
very	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
.	c

First	c
,	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
does	i
n't	i
play	i
"	i
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
"	c
his	i
paper	i
was	c
played	c
by	c
Danny	c
De	c
Vito	c
.	c

I	c
can	c
understand	c
that	c
a	c
play	c
can	c
start	c
fifteen	c
minutes	c
late	c
,	c
but	c
not	c
fourty	i
five	i
.	c

Second	c
,	c
my	c
wife	c
and	c
me	i
payed	i
Â£	c
20	c
for	c
the	c
tickets	c
and	c
we	c
asked	c
for	c
discounts	c
.	c

The	c
receptionist	c
who	c
gave	c
me	c
the	c
tickets	c
told	c
me	c
that	c
no	c
discounts	c
were	c
able	i
that	c
night	c
.	c

After	c
a	c
boring	c
play	c
,	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
go	c
an	i
theatre	c
restaurant	c
,	c
but	c
uncertainly	i
it	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

I	c
decided	c
to	c
go	c
home	c
and	c
prepare	i
some	c
sandwiches	c
.	c

The	c
principal	c
reason	c
for	i
I	c
'm	c
writting	i
you	i
at	c
the	c
moment	c
is	c
that	c
I	c
want	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
felt	c
so	c
disappointing	i
with	c
the	c
theatre	c
and	c
also	c
with	c
the	c
play	c
.	c

Your	i
sincerelly	i
,	c

It	c
's	c
a	c
good	c
question	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
never	i
had	i
asked	i
it	i
to	i
myself	i
.	c

I	c
think	c
modern	c
technology	c
is	c
changing	c
so	i
much	i
my	i
daily	i
life	i
and	c
also	c
is	i
changing	c
the	c
life	i
of	c
others	c
like	c
me	c
.	c

Before	c
modern	c
technologies	c
arrived	c
,	c
you	c
ca	i
n't	i
comunicate	i
as	c
easy	i
as	c
today	i
we	i
can	i
do	i
.	c

An	c
example	c
could	c
be	c
the	c
Internet	c
.	c

But	c
,	c
is	i
not	c
only	c
news	c
or	c
information	c
.	c

You	c
can	c
comunicate	i
with	c
people	c
from	i
place	i
were	i
you	c
never	i
can	i
imagine	c
to	i
have	i
a	i
trip	i
because	c
it	c
will	i
be	c
too	c
expensive	c
.	c

An	c
extract	i
could	c
be	c
the	c
popular	c
chats	i
,	c
where	c
people	c
write	c
with	c
the	c
keyboard	c
what	c
they	c
want	c
to	c
tell	c
.	c

But	c
,	c
if	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
like	c
to	i
use	i
the	c
keyboard	c
to	c
tell	i
something	c
or	c
comunicate	i
,	c
you	c
can	c
use	c
video	c
conference	i
,	c
a	c
sistem	i
wich	i
you	i
can	i
talk	c
with	c
other	c
people	c
simply	c
with	c
a	c
microphone	c
and	c
speakers	c
.	c

Also	c
is	i
the	c
possibility	i
of	i
download	i
things	c
to	c
your	c
pc	i
like	c
software	c
,	c
pictures	c
and	c
also	i
,	c
music	c
.	c

Also	c
computers	c
and	c
mobile	c
phones	c
had	i
evolutioned	i
thanks	c
to	c
modern	c
technologies	c
.	c

Without	c
this	c
evolution	c
,	c
we	c
probably	i
still	c
get	i
on	i
the	i
ancient	c
times	c
.	c

No	c
electricity	c
,	c
no	c
canalized	c
water	c
,	c
no	c
healthy	c
water	c
,	c
no	c
TV	i
's	i
,	c
no	c
phones	c
,	c
no	c
PC	i
's	i
.	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
afraid	c
that	c
the	c
people	c
on	i
the	i
ancient	c
times	c
lived	c
although	c
they	c
do	i
n't	i
have	c
anything	i
of	c
these	c
things	c
,	c
but	c
me	c
and	c
everyone	c
of	i
this	i
times	c
,	c
I	c
'm	c
afraid	c
that	c
we	c
would	c
n't	c
like	c
return	i
to	c
this	c
life	c
.	c

Is	i
like	c
a	c
round	i
tour	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
reply	c
to	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
very	c
glad	c
to	c
hear	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
.	c

Here	c
there	i
are	i
the	c
informations	i
you	c
require	c
.	c

As	c
far	c
as	c
accomodation	i
is	c
concerned	c
I	i
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
because	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
more	c
comfortable	c
,	c
and	c
,	c
therefore	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
stayed	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
.	c

The	c
two	c
activities	c
I	c
have	c
chosen	c
are	c
basketball	c
and	c
tennis	c
.	c

I	c
play	c
basketball	c
very	c
well	c
,	c
although	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
taken	c
part	c
in	c
important	c
competitions	c
;	c
however	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
not	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
tennis	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
improve	c
it	i
.	c

Moreover	c
I	c
would	c
be	c
grateful	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
tell	c
me	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
,	c
and	c
which	i
clothes	c
are	c
better	i
to	i
be	i
put	i
on	i
during	c
the	c
holiday	c
.	c

Rita	c
Pizzi	c

This	c
report	c
shows	c
which	c
lessons	c
and	c
activities	c
are	c
better	i
to	c
be	i
filmed	i
in	c
order	c
to	c
make	c
a	c
short	c
video	c
about	c
daily	c
life	c
at	c
our	c
school	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
based	c
on	c
interviews	c
taken	c
from	c
over	c
80	c
%	c
of	c
my	c
classmates	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
about	c
3	c
%	c
of	c
students	c
suggest	c
that	c
also	i
chemistry	i
lessons	i
should	i
be	c
filmed	c
,	c
because	c
they	c
often	c
take	c
place	c
in	c
the	c
laboratory	c
that	c
the	c
school	c
has	c
lately	i
built	c
;	c
in	c
fact	c
some	c
experiments	c
might	c
be	c
filmed	c
.	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
clear	c
that	c
not	c
only	c
should	c
the	c
film	c
be	c
about	c
the	c
subjects	c
they	c
study	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
should	c
concern	c
their	c
sportif	i
activities	c
as	c
well	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
,	c
which	c
I	c
have	c
seen	c
in	c
The	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
on	c
6th	c
June	c
.	c

On	c
that	c
date	c
,	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
spend	c
one	c
evening	c
seeing	c
a	c
musical	c
show	c
as	c
I	c
was	c
on	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
and	c
was	c
interested	c
in	c
musial	i
show	c
.	c

I	c
found	c
the	c
theater	i
rather	c
noisy	c
as	c
I	c
arrived	c
very	c
early	c
to	c
sit	c
in	c
the	c
front	c
row	c
.	c

Although	c
I	c
got	c
a	c
bit	c
annoyed	c
,	c
I	c
tried	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
good	c
time	c
.	c

And	c
I	c
really	i
disappointed	c
from	i
the	c
different	c
actor	c
's	c
performance	c
.	c

He	c
kept	c
forgetting	c
his	c
lines	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
restaurant	c
to	c
have	c
something	c
for	c
dinner	c
after	c
show	i
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
it	c
was	c

How	c
can	c
we	c

This	c
is	c
what	c
my	c
friend	c
said	c
the	c
other	c
day	c
when	c
she	c
went	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
show	c
with	c
me	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
some	c
people	c
refuse	c
to	c
wear	c
that	c
sort	c
of	c
clothes	c
so	c
they	c
prefre	i
to	c
wear	c
nothing	c

Clothes	c

Sir	c
,	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
because	c
I	c
want	c
you	c
to	c
give	c
the	c
money	c
back	c
for	i
your	c
"	i
London	c
's	c
newest	c
and	c
best	c
musical	c
show	c
:	c
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
"	c
,	c
presented	c
in	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
.	c

In	c
fact	c
,	c
unlike	c
the	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
that	c
you	c
promised	c
on	i
your	c
advertisement	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
very	c
disapointing	i
evening	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
expected	c
to	c
see	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
in	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
but	c
he	c
was	c
replaced	c
by	c
another	c
actor	c
.	c

There	c
was	i
also	c
the	c
discounts	c
wich	i
were	c
n't	c
available	c
.	c

And	c
to	c
finish	c
,	c
the	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
,	c
for	c
any	i
reasons	c
you	c
did	c
n't	c
take	i
to	i
us	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
eat	c
this	i
evening	c
.	c

Hoping	c
you	c
'll	c
satisfy	i
my	c
request	c
.	c

So	c
the	c
surprise	c
we	c
prepared	c
for	c
the	i
Leon	c
's	c
birthday	c
had	c
failed	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
we	i
've	i
started	c
to	c
search	i
an	i
idea	i
for	c
it	c
for	i
one	c
months	i
.	i

In	i
the	i
beginning	i
,	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
bring	c
him	c
in	i
my	c
house	c
where	c
everybody	c
would	c
wait	c
for	c
him	c
.	c

But	c
he	c
wanted	c
to	c
stay	c
at	c
his	i
home	c
.	c

So	c
Sigone	c
found	i
the	c
greatest	c
idea	c
.	c

So	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
find	c
a	c
dog	c
that	c
Leon	c
would	c
n't	c
recognized	i
.	c

No	c
luck	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
.	i

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
I	c
am	c
surprise	i
to	c
received	i
the	i
letter	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

I	c
read	c
the	c
information	c
as	i
you	c
gave	c
to	c
me	c
,	i
it	i
is	c
very	c
interesting	c
.	c

According	i
to	i
Camp	c
California	c
in	c
the	c
U.S.A.	c
I	i
expect	c
to	c
traveling	i
on	i
July	c
because	c
I	c
will	c
have	c
a	c
long	c
holiday	i
break	i
on	i
that	c
time	c
and	c
my	c
children	c
have	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
France	c
with	c
student	i
's	i
school	c
on	i
July	c
as	c
well	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
,	i
it	c
will	c
be	c
very	i
good	c
time	c
to	c
traveling	i
by	i
without	c
worries	c
.	c

Can	c
you	c
imagine	c
how	c
exsiting	i
when	i
we	c
stay	i
in	c
the	c
dark	c
and	c
very	c
quite	i
and	c
we	c
can	c
hear	c
a	i
sound	c
of	c
animal	i
.	c

How	i
's	i
amazing	i
that	c
?	c

I	c
have	c
been	c
doing	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
them	c
when	c
I	c
have	c
got	i
a	i
free	c
time	c
and	c
when	c
I	c
feel	c
empressted	i
where	i
I	c
have	c
been	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
I	c
can	c
do	c
it	i
very	c
well	c
.	c

By	c
the	c
way	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
say	c

Today	c
I	c
going	i

Firstly	c
it	i
is	i
about	c
the	c
hall	c
which	c
they	c
used	c
for	c
concert	i
.	c

It	c
is	i
very	i
big	c
hall	c
including	i
the	i
sound	c
system	c
and	c
the	i
light	i
at	i
the	i
steat	i

By	c
the	c
way	c
I	i

concert	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
to	c
connect	i

,	c
you	c

very	i
strongly	i
when	c

n't	c
weait	i
to	c
go	i
at	i
frount	i
and	c
they	c
are	i
try	c
to	c
go	c
over	i
very	c
quickly	c
.	c

So	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
explaining	i
too	i
many	i
time	i
to	c
make	c
people	c
clamed	i
down	c
and	c
standed	i
in	c
the	i
row	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
very	c
hard	c
for	c
me	c
and	c
I	c
wo	c

Oh	c
,	c
no	c
!	c

This	c
is	c
one	i
of	i
a	c
normal	c
scene	c
when	c
a	c
mother	c
and	c
her	c
daughter	c
are	c
buying	i
and	c
getting	c
clothes	c
from	c
the	c
shelves	c
.	c

That	c
is	c
what	c
most	c
of	i
the	i
women	c
love	c
.	c

They	c
love	c
going	c
to	c
a	c
shopping	c
centre	c
and	c
put	i
lots	c
of	c
clothes	c
on	c
.	c

That	c
's	c
so	c
good	c
when	c
you	c
have	c
money	i
for	i
joy	i
it	c
but	c
,	c
appart	i
from	c
that	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
many	c
problems	c
.	c

On	i
the	i
one	i
hand	i
,	c
a	c
big	c
problem	c
are	i
the	c
children	c
.	c

When	c
they	c
go	c
to	i
shopping	c
with	c
their	c
mothers	c
,	c
they	c
want	c
to	c
buy	c
all	c
the	c
things	c
that	c
their	i
sight	i
reach	i
:	c
doors	c
,	c
little	c
cars	c
,	c
films	c
...	c
but	c
,	c
when	c
their	c
mothers	c
see	c
a	c
good	c
thing	c
that	c
they	c
want	c
to	c
buy	c
,	c
there	i
are	i
the	i
children	i
:	i
crying	c
because	c
they	c
are	c
tired	c
for	i
shopping	c
all	c
the	i
day	c
.	c

People	c
buy	c
and	c
buy	c
unnecessary	c
things	c
but	c
,	c
when	c
they	c
arrives	i
in	i
their	i
houses	i
,	c
they	c
can	c
see	c
an	c
empty	c
wallet	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
do	c
you	c
believe	c
that	c
a	c
shopping	c
bag	i
like	c
this	c
one	c
is	c
an	c
enjoyable	c
shopping	i
day	i
?	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
,	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
the	c
letter	c
I	c
have	c
just	c
received	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
point	c
out	c
that	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
pleasure	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
take	c
part	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
assure	c
you	c
that	c
I	c
would	i
do	c
my	c
best	c
to	c
be	c
the	i
one	c
of	c
the	c
winners	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
.	c

Now	c
,	c
If	i
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
state	i
some	c
of	c
the	c
information	c
that	c
you	c
may	c
need	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
I	c
can	c
travel	i
only	i
in	c
July	c
this	c
year	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
those	c
kinds	c
of	c
sports	c
and	c
think	c
that	c
I	c
could	c
be	c
the	c
winner	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
how	c
many	c
clothes	c
and	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
should	i
I	i
take	c
with	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
will	c
wait	c
to	c
hearing	i
from	c
you	c
,	c
soon	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

Piotr	c
Kaczmarski	c

I	c
do	c
agree	c
with	c
the	c
opinion	c
that	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

Nowadays	c
many	c
young	c
people	c
like	c
to	c
do	c
their	c
shopping	c
.	c

But	c
,	c
is	c
n't	c
it	c
a	c
kind	c
of	c
entertaintment	i
?	c

In	c
the	c
first	c
place	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
point	c
out	c
that	c
to	c
go	c
shopping	c
does	c
not	c
always	c
mean	c
to	c
buy	c
something	c
.	c

But	c
,	c
what	c
about	c
real	c
shopping	c
.	i

For	c
example	c
,	c
emagine	i
that	c
you	c
are	c
a	c
bride	c
and	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
buy	c
an	c
appropriate	c
suit	i
.	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
shopping	c
is	c
enjoyable	c
when	c
you	c
are	c
going	c
only	c
for	c
fan	i
.	c

But	c
,	c
when	c
you	c
want	c
to	c
buy	c
something	c
special	c
it	c
's	c
a	c
real	c
nightmare	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
and	c
your	c
congratulations	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
really	c
wonderful	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
a	c
student	c
at	c
Portsmouth	c
College	c
and	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
this	c
term	c
is	c
23	c
June	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
can	c
only	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
.	c

I	c
wonder	c
if	c
it	c
is	c
all	c
right	c
for	i
that	c
time	c
.	c

I	c
like	c
to	c
do	c
some	c
activities	c
in	c
water	c
and	c
my	c
favourite	c
activity	c
is	c
swimming	c
.	c

Before	c
I	c
came	c
England	i
,	c
I	c
swam	c
every	c
weekend	c
in	c
my	c
country	c
even	i
in	c
winter	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
choose	c
to	c
do	c
some	c
swimming	c
and	c
sailing	c
while	c
I	c
am	c
at	c
the	c
camp	c
.	c

Actually	c
,	c
my	c
mind	c
has	c
already	c
gone	c
there	c
,	i
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
wait	c
even	c
for	c
a	c
minute	c
.	c

By	c
the	c
way	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
the	i
shopping	c
especially	i
for	c
clothes	c
,	i
I	c
want	c
to	c
buy	c
some	c
for	c
myself	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
your	c
letter	c

Dear	c
Mrs.	c
Ryan	c

I	c
was	c
very	i
delighted	c
to	c
hear	c
about	c
my	c
success	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
and	c
me	c
winning	c
the	c
prize	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
very	i
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
it	c
as	c
I	c
've	c
never	c
been	c
in	i
the	c
U.S.A.	c
before	c
.	c

Any	c
two	c
weeks	c
during	c
July	c
will	c
suit	c
me	c
perfectly	c
.	c

As	c
for	c
accommodation	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
,	c
I	c
prefer	c
tent	i
.	c

I	c
'm	c
used	c
to	c
sleep	i
in	c
tent	i
from	c
my	c
previous	c
holidays	c
and	c
I	c
always	c
injoyed	i
it	c
.	c

I	c
really	c
appreciate	c
the	c
choice	c
of	c
activities	c
at	c
the	c
camp	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
hard	c
to	c
choose	c
only	c
two	c
.	c

I	c
've	c
chosen	c
tennis	c
and	c
sailing	c
.	c

I	c
've	c
played	c
tennis	c
since	c
I	c
was	c
eight	c
years	c
old	c
and	c
I	c
'm	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
'd	c
also	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
how	c
far	c
is	i
it	i
to	c
the	c
nearest	c
village	c
and	c
how	c
much	c
cash	c
do	i
I	c
need	c
for	c
two-weeks	i
stay	c
at	c
the	c
camp	c
?	c

Do	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
bring	c
with	c
me	c
some	c
special	c
gear	c
or	c
equipment	c
?	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hear	i
from	c
you	c
again	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

In	c
my	c
last	c
letter	c
I	c
promised	c
to	c
write	c
you	i
about	c
my	c
experience	c
working	c
at	c
pop-concert	i
.	c

First	c
I	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
help	c
at	c
the	c
refreshment	c
spot	c
for	c
the	c
fans	c
but	c
some	c
15	c
minutes	c
before	c
beginning	c
I	c
was	c
told	c
to	c
go	c
to	i
the	i
backstage	c
and	c
help	c
with	c
the	c
refreshment	i
for	c
the	c
musicians	c
,	c
technicians	c
and	c
others	c
who	c
worked	c
there	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
very	c
hectic	c
there	c
as	c
everyone	c
was	c
a	c
bit	c
nervous	c
but	c
I	c
saw	c
the	c
main	c
stars	c
and	c
even	c
managed	c
to	c
talk	c
to	c
them	c
.	c

When	c
they	c
started	c
to	c
play	c
I	c
was	c
told	c
to	c
change	c
my	c
post	c
again	c
.	c

This	c
time	c
I	c
was	c
helping	c
the	c
medical	c
workers	c
who	c
had	c
full	i
hands	i
with	c
fainted	i
teenage	i
girls	i
.	c

It	c
was	c
n't	c
funny	c
anymore	c
and	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
know	c
what	c
to	c
do	c
first	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
really	c
shocked	c
by	c
the	c
view	i
of	c
crying	c
and	c
shaking	c
but	c
absolutely	i
happy	c
girls	c
sitting	c
or	c
lying	c
on	c
the	c
floor	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
manage	i
to	c
listen	c
the	i
music	c
and	c
I	c
must	c
admit	c
that	c
I	c
liked	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
actually	c
injoyed	i
it	c
working	c
there	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
n't	c
hesitate	c
to	c
work	c
there	c
again	c
.	c

As	c
I	c
know	c
you	c
like	c
this	c

The	c

the	c
whole	c

and	c
will	c
be	c

in	c
August	c

You	c
asked	c
me	c
which	c
accomodation	i

some	c
painting	c

which	c
I	c
am	c
quite	c
good	c
at	c

May	c
I	c
ask	c
you	c

money	c
do	c
I	c

I	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

As	c
you	c
asked	c
me	c
in	c
your	c
letter	c
,	c
I	c
will	c
try	c
to	c
explain	c
my	c
wonderful	c
experience	c
at	c
this	i
pop	c
concert	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
you	i
have	c
to	c
know	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
a	i
common	i
pop	c
concert	c
,	c
but	c
a	c
real	c
open	i
air	i
festival	c
.	c

It	i
is	c
n't	c
the	c
first	c
year	c
that	c
I	c
work	i
there	c
.	c

My	c
job	c
was	c
as	i
simple	i
as	i
selling	c
ice-creams	c
.	c

You	c
might	c
say	c
that	c
it	c
is	i
quite	c
boring	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
so	i
funny	i
.	c

It	c
was	c
amazing	i
experience	c
.	c

What	c
I	c
particularly	c
liked	c
about	c
it	c
was	c
that	c
the	c
staff	c
was	c
like	c
a	c
big	c
family	c
.	c

Love	c
from	c

All	c
of	c
my	c
classmates	c
are	c
expecting	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
London	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
satisfied	c
with	c
your	c
programme	c
.	c

We	c
have	c
just	c
sen	i
the	c
advertisement	c
for	c
'	c
The	c
London	c
fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
'	c
.	c

We	c
are	c
very	c
keen	c
on	c
the	i
fashions	c
and	c
make	i
up	i
.	c

It	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
to	c
study	c
the	c
latest	c
fashion	c
trend	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
held	c
at	c
the	c
'	c
Central	c
Exhibition	c
Hall	c
'	c
on	c
14	c
March.	c
,	c
from	c
10	c
A.M.	c
to	c
7	c
P.M.	c
Therefore	c
we	c
could	c
go	c
there	c
after	c
the	c
Science	c
Museum	c
.	c

Because	c
we	c
have	c
a	i
free	c
time	c
on	c
15	c
March	c
afternoon	i
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
will	c
consider	c
my	c
suggestion	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
served	c
breakfast	c
with	c
fresh	c
coffee	c
.	c

Washing	c
and	c
cleaning	c
have	c
been	i
already	i
done	c
by	c
my	c
robot	c
maid	c
!	c

It	c
would	i
be	i
come	c
true	c
in	c
the	c
near	c
future	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
to	c
this	c
you	c
will	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
control	c
all	c
part	i
of	c
house	i
by	c
a	i
computer	c
such	c
as	c
temperature	c
or	c
vacume	i
cleaning	c
.	c

They	c
can	c
clean	c
the	c
house	c
but	c
they	c
can	i
not	i
give	c
the	i
affection	c
to	c
the	c
family	c
.	c

But	c
these	c
robots	c
can	i
not	i
be	i
replaced	i
of	i
warm-heart	i
human	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Many	c
people	c
leave	i
so	c
many	c
other	c
activities	c
for	c
the	c
pleasure	c
of	c
buying	c
as	c
many	c
things	c
as	c
they	c
can	c
afford	c
.	c

Let	c
us	c
then	c
ask	c
:	c
'	c
Is	c
this	c
activitie	i
always	c
enjoyable	c
?	c
'	c

Far	i
from	i
the	i
strengh	i
that	c
practising	i
a	c
sport	c
or	c
even	c
going	c
to	c
work	c
require	i
,	c
going	c
shopping	c
is	c
something	c
you	c
can	c
do	c
either	c
on	c
your	c
own	c
or	c
with	c
all	c
your	c
family	c
and	c
it	c
could	c
not	c
be	c
easier	c
;	c
you	c
only	c
need	c
a	c
good	c
pair	c
of	c
shoes	c
and	c
a	c
wallet	c
full	c
of	c
money	c
.	c

I	c
received	c
your	c

very	c
suprised	i

I	c
am	c
writting	i

about	c
your	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
stay	c
at	i
long	i
cabins	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
stayed	c
at	i
tents	c
many	c
times	c
in	c
my	c
childhood	c
.	c

The	c
most	c
exciting	c
offer	c
is	c
your	c
activities	c

However	c
,	c
he	c
retired	c
his	i
job	c
last	c
year	c
so	c
he	c
has	c
had	c
his	c

If	c
I	c

I	c
will	c
enjoy	c

panfulet	i
of	c
that	c

,	c
CD	c
and	c
T-shirts	c

What	c

New	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
about	c
a	c

Red	c
Hot	c
Chilli	c
Pepers	i
came	c
here	c
for	c
a	c
short	c
time	c
and	c
they	c
played	c
at	c
the	c
"	c
Chedicard	c
Hall	c
"	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
realy	i
cool	c
because	c
I	c
did	c
some	c
backstage	c
job	i
.	c

I	c
helped	c
with	c
the	c
clothing	i
with	i
some	c

with	c
the	c

,	c
with	c
the	c

I	c
was	c
kind	c
of	c
a	c
"	c
handy	c
girl	c
"	c
.	c

I	c
did	c
a	c
little	c
bit	c
of	c
everything.	c
.	c

The	c
best	c
part	c
was	c
when	c
the	c
band	c
arrived	c
.	c

I	c
took	c
lots	c
of	c
pictures	c
,	c
asked	c
for	c
authographs	i

even	c
gave	c

,	c
what	i
I	c

Some	i

Dear	c
Manager	c
:	c
I	c
am	c
Angela	c
Ounis	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
writting	i
to	c
you	c
because	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
see	c
'	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
'	c
,	c
London	c
's	c
newest	c
and	c
best	c
musical	c
show	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
disappointing	i
at	i
this	c
evening	c
's	c
show	c
.	c

I	c
arrived	c
there	c
,	i
at	c
19:15	c
,	i
the	i
show	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
start	c
at	c
19.30	c
,	c
but	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
,	i
it	i
cannot	c
be	c
possible	c
that	c
a	c
schedule	c
for	c
a	c
show	c
have	i
had	i
a	i
big	i
change	i
.	c

Also	c
was	i
said	c
that	c
Discounts	c
will	i
be	c
available	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
received	i
any	c
discount	c
as	c
you	c
were	c
cheating	c
us	c
.	c

On	i
the	i
other	i
hand	i
,	c
the	c
theatre	c
Restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
they	c
've	c
got	c
a	c
problem	c
with	c
the	c
schedule	i
's	i
organization	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
so	c
disappointed	c
with	c
this	c
,	i
that	c
I	c
am	c
in	i
all	i
my	i
right	i
to	c
ask	c
for	c
some	c
money	c
back	c
,	c
your	c
theatre	c
show	c
was	c
n't	c
expected	i
.	c

Please	c
let	c
me	c
know	c
.	i

How	c
has	c
modern	c
technology	c
changed	c
your	c
daily	c
life	c
?	c

Since	c
I	i
've	i
got	i
a	c
computer	c
with	c
Internet	i
,	c
my	c
social	c
life	c
has	c
changed	c
.	c

This	c
has	c
helped	c
me	c
a	c
lot	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
can	c
talk	c
with	c
my	c
friends	c
that	i
are	i
living	i
in	c
other	c
countries	c
.	c

Technology	i
has	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
programs	c
that	c
lead	i
you	c
communicate	c
with	c
others	c
in	c
a	i
more	i
easy	i
way	c
.	c

'	c
Speak	c
Freely	c
'	c
is	c
fantastic	c
,	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
pay	c
and	c
you	c
can	c
hear	c
the	c
voice	c
of	c
the	c
one	c
you	c
miss	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
learned	c
a	c
lot	c
with	c
Internet	i
,	i
it	i
gaves	i
me	c
the	c
posibility	i
to	c
know	c
more	c
about	c
things	c
I	i
've	i
never	i
knew	i
.	i

It	c
is	c
incredible	c
how	c
it	c
opens	c
to	i
you	i
another	c
reality	c
,	c
a	c
different	c
view	c
of	c
life	c
.	c

Technology	c
had	i
gave	i
me	c
another	c
life	c
,	c
has	i
helped	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
modern	c
technology	c
is	c
our	c
future	c
,	c
we	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
to	c
depend	c
on	c
it	c
,	c
but	c
we	c
have	c
to	c
work	c
for	c
a	i
biggest	c
improvement	c
.	c

Mr	c
Jon	c
Stevens	c
,	c

Last	c
month	c
I	c
have	i
been	i
in	c
London	c
for	c
a	c
week	c
to	c
visit	c
your	c
wonderful	c
city	c
and	c
with	c
the	c
intention	c
of	c
seeing	c
at	i
your	i
Thetre	i
the	i
famous	i
musical	i
show	i
Over	i
the	i
rainbow	i
but	c
in	c
all	c
my	c
life	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
had	c
such	c
a	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
my	i
cousin	c
,	c
who	c
lives	c
there	c
,	c
had	c
had	c
many	c
problems	c
with	c
the	c
tickets	c
.	c

What	c
a	c
pity	c
,	c
I	c
thought	c
.	c

The	c
quality	c
of	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
n't	c
as	c
high	c
as	c
I	c
expected	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
n't	c
tought	i
for	i
a	c
restaurant	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
because	c
if	c
the	c
advertisement	c
had	c
been	c
right	c
,	c
there	c
should	c
had	i
to	i
be	i
a	c
luxury	c
restaurant	c
where	c
I	c
could	c
eat	c
.	c

I	c
'd	c
rather	c
I	c
had	c
been	c
at	c
home	c
seeing	i
on	i
TV	i
my	i
Italy	i
!	c

I	c
hope	c
that	c
my	c
wish	i
is	c
being	i
accepted	i
.	c

Your	i
Sinceraly	i

We	c
are	c
in	c
the	c
ages	i
of	c
the	i
technologic	i
development	c
it	i
's	i
out	i
of	i
doubt	i
.	c

Not	c
only	c
for	c
the	c
great	c
nations	c
,	c
but	c
also	c
for	c
every	i
their	i
inhabitants	c
.	c

Today	c
it	c
's	c
absurd	c
not	c
knowing	i
how	c
a	c
computer	c
works	c
,	c
or	c
how	c
to	c
use	c
Internet	i

I	c
can	c
buy	c
,	c
today	c
,	c
a	c
book	c
being	i
comfortable	c
at	c
home	c
,	c
can	c
communicate	c
with	c
other	c
friends	c
faster	c
than	c
before	c
.	c

I	c
can	i
have	i
my	i
homeworks	i
done	i
by	i
a	i
calculator	i
etc.	c
In	c
future	i
I	c
wish	i
I	c
could	c
fly	c
on	c
my	c
own	c
!	c

But	c
sometimes	c
I	c
'd	c
rather	c
to	i
switch	i
them	c
off	c
and	c
think	c
of	c
what	c
I	c
could	i
waste	i
,	c
like	c
love	c
and	c
friendship	c
.	c

I	c
wish	c
all	c
the	c
world	c
would	c
do	c
the	c
same	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
we	c
saw	c
last	c
Saturday	c
in	c
the	c
Oxfor	c
News	c
one	i
advertisement	c
about	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
and	c
we	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
if	c
could	i
be	c
posible	i
to	c
inclued	i
this	c
show	c
in	c
our	c
tour	c
.	c

We	c
think	c
that	c
it	c
could	c
be	c
great	i
opportunity	c
because	c
in	c
one	c
day	c
we	c
can	c
see	c
every	i
thing	i
about	i
fashion	i
clothes	c
,	c
new	c
makes	i
up	i
and	c
hayrstyles	i
.	c

Furthermore	c
is	i
student	i
free	i
.	c

I	i
you	c
would	c
like	c
more	c
information	c
do	c
not	c
hesitate	c
to	c
contact	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
for	i
you	i
reply	c
.	c

Yours	c
,	i
sincerely	c

Dear	c
Ms	i

In	c
this	c
letter	c
you	c
ask	c
me	c
some	i
further	c
information	c
for	i
my	i
conveniance	i
for	i
this	i
trip	i
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
sleep	i
in	c
a	c
tent	c
.	c

I	c
am	i
going	i
every	i
year	i
camping	i
in	c
the	c
countryside	c
of	c
France	c
.	c

Last	c
summer	c
I	c
took	c
a	c
course	i
of	i
one	i
week	i
in	i
Switzerland	i
of	i
climbing	i
so	c
I	c
have	i
good	i
knowledge	i
of	i
this	c
sport	c
.	c

Finally	c
could	c
you	c
please	c
tell	c
me	c
wich	i
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
shall	i
I	c
take	c
with	c
me	c
and	c
if	c
the	c
camping	c
furnitures	i
are	i
provided	c
.	i

I	c
also	i
wondering	c
me	i
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
need	c
and	c
if	c
there	c
is	c
a	c
safe	c
place	c
where	c
I	c
can	c
put	c
my	c
money	c
and	c

I	c
look	c

from	c
you	c
soon	c
and	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
send	c
me	c
a	c

I	c
would	c
be	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c

A	c
lot	c
of	c
people	c
like	c
shopping	c
and	c
everybody	c
goes	c
on	c
saturday	i
because	c
for	i
lots	c
of	c
people	c
they	i
do	c
n't	c
go	c
to	c
work	c
and	i
is	i
the	c
only	c
day	c
off	c
of	i
the	c
majority	c
of	c
people	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
get	c
up	c
enough	i
early	i
you	c
ca	c
n't	c
find	c
a	c
parking	c
in	i
the	c
town	c
centre	c
,	i
all	i
of	c
them	c
are	c
full	c
before	i
11	c
am	c
.	c

In	i
the	i
street	c
is	c
so	c
crowded	c
that	c
you	c
ca	c
n't	c
walk	c
like	c
usually	i
and	c
if	c
you	c
go	c
with	c
some	c
friends	c
you	c
can	c
be	c
sure	c
that	c
you	c
will	c
lost	i
them	c
.	c

In	i
the	i
shops	i
is	i
worth	i
,	c
if	c
you	c
are	c
lucky	c
and	c
you	c
find	c
a	i
clothes	c
with	i
your	i
right	c
size	c
you	c
will	c
wait	c
20	c
min	i
.	i

When	c
you	c
buy	c
food	c
or	c
drink	c
they	c
give	c
you	c
plastic	i
bag	c
for	i

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
,	c

The	c
reason	c
of	i
my	c
letter	c
,	i
is	c
that	c
our	c
class	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
suggest	c
a	c
few	c
changes	c
on	i
our	c
programme	c
of	i
London	c
,	c
because	c
we	c
have	c
seen	c
an	c
advertisement	c
about	c
an	c
interesting	c
activity	c
that	c
we	c
could	c
include	c
in	c
our	c
programme	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
we	c
want	c
to	c
say	c
thanks	c
to	c
you	c
because	c
we	c
know	c
the	c
effort	c
you	c
have	c
done	i
organising	c
our	i
good	i
programme	c
,	c
but	c
we	c
would	c
really	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
London	c
fashion	c
and	c
leisure	c
show	c
we	c
saw	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
.	c

We	c
think	c
that	c
perhaps	c
in	i
Tuesday	c
March	c
14	c
,	i
we	c
could	c
change	c
the	c
time	c
of	i
going	i
to	c
Science	i
Museum	c
,	c
and	c
(	i
we	i
)	i
go	c
earlier	i
to	i
the	i
Museum	i
,	c
such	i
as	i
half	c
past	c
eight	c
on	i
the	c
morning	c
,	c
so	c
we	c
could	c
go	c
after	i
,	c
at	c
ten	c
o'clock	c
to	i
the	c
show	c
,	c
and	c
we	c
could	c
also	c
delay	c
going	c
shopping	c
on	c
that	c
afternoon	c
,	c
because	c
the	c
show	c
lasts	c
til	i
seven	c
o'clock	c
on	i
the	c
evening	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
to	c
know	i
more	c
about	c
fashion	c
.	c

I	c
Look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Books	c
will	c
gradually	c
disappear	c
,	c
and	c
instead	c
we	c
will	c
read	c
all	c
the	c
things	c
we	c
want	c
in	i
our	c
computer	c
.	c

Although	c
computers	c
will	c
give	c
us	c
all	c
the	c
material	c
things	c
,	c
it	i
could	i
not	c
give	c
us	c
things	c
like	c
the	c
feeling	c
of	c
being	c
in	c
your	c
home	c
,	c
have	i
,	c
etc.	c
That	i
things	c
wo	c
n't	c
change	c
in	c
our	c
home	c
.	c

.	c
.	c
,	i
that	c
kind	c
of	c
things	i
will	c
never	c
change	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
received	c
your	c
letter	c
which	i
says	c
I	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
-	c
two	c
weeks	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c

U.S.A.	c
I	c

and	c
I	c
thank	c
you	c
a	i
lot	i
that	i
you	i
have	i
chosen	c
me	c
as	c

I	c
acxepted	i

and	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
inform	c
you	c
that	c
I	c
can	c
travel	c
only	c
on	i
July	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
booked	c
my	c
anual	i
leave	c
that	i
period	c
.	c

Also	c
,	c
I	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
tents	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
memories	c
from	c
my	c
childhood	c
.	c

Every	c
years	i
my	c
parents	c
used	c
to	c
sent	i
me	c
for	i
holidays	i
at	i
Camps	c
on	i
the	c
mountains	c
so	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
stay	c
for	c
a	c
while	c
in	c
the	c
same	c
accommodation	i
,	i
and	c
environment	c
.	c

Also	c
,	c
I	c
prefer	c
swimming	c
and	c
painting	c
.	c

My	c
parents	c
brought	i
me	c
to	c
the	c
sea	i
side	i
every	c
weekend	c
so	c
I	c
was	i
used	c
to	c
be	i
inside	i
the	c
water	c
all	c
the	i
seasons	c
.	c

Also	c
,	c
I	c
like	i
painting	c
from	c
young	i
age	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
taken	c
part	c
in	c
a	c
public	c
exhibition	c
,	c
where	c
I	c
won	c
the	i
first	c
prize	c
.	c

What	c
about	c
the	c
clothes	c
,	i
you	i
do	c
n't	c
mention	c
anything	c
.	i

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
write	c
about	c
my	i
experience	c
that	c
I	c
had	c
,	i
when	c
I	c
enjoyed	c
helping	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
in	c
my	c
neighbourhood	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
a	c
member	c
in	i
the	c
council	c
team	c
so	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
help	c
them	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
that	c
was	c
organized	c
in	i
the	i
last	c
month	c
.	c

I	c
helped	c
them	c
to	c
prepare	c
the	c
room	c
for	c
the	c
bads	i
and	c
I	c
decorated	c
the	c
place	c
for	c
the	c
singers	c
.	c

I	c
helped	c
them	c
to	c
the	i
music	c
and	c
to	i
the	c
songs	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
a	i
quite	i
difficult	c
assiment	i
but	c
I	c
got	c
very	i
good	c
experience	c
.	c

I	c
understood	i
it	c
when	c
the	c
concert	c
had	c
finished	c
.	c

Also	c
,	c
it	c
happen	i
first	i
time	c
in	c
my	c
life	c
.	c

I	c
still	c
have	c
the	c
sound	c
of	c
the	c
music	c
in	c
my	c
ears	c
and	c
the	c
voices	c
of	c
the	c
young	c
people	c
who	c
were	c
accompaning	i
our	c
songs	c
.	c

I	c
enjoyed	c
very	i
much	c
and	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
tranfere	i
my	c
enjoyment	i
to	c
you	c
though	i
this	c
letter	c

Dear	c
Ms	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
to	c
give	c
some	i
requiered	i
information	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
glad	c
to	c
hear	c
that	c
I	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
happy	c
to	c
visit	c
the	c
United	c
States	c
under	i
your	c
organisation	c
.	c

Actually	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
Camp	c
California	c
next	c
July	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
got	c
two	c
weeks	i
holiday	c
then	c
.	c

Therefore	i
,	i
you	i
asked	c
me	c
what	c
activities	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
join	c
.	i

Surfing	c
is	c
something	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
ever	i
wanted	c
to	c
try	c
.	c

I	c
enjoy	c
taking	c
pictures	c
of	c
landscapes	c
,	i
I	c
have	c
also	c
visited	i
a	c
photography	c
course	c
.	c

So	c
that	i
my	c
level	i
is	c
not	c
beginners	i
anymore	c
.	c

What	i
kind	i
of	i
money	i
is	i
used	i
?	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

Excuse	i
me	i
that	i
I	i
did	i
n't	i
write	i
you	c
sooner	c
.	c

So	c
many	c
happy	c
people	c
in	c
the	c
crowds	c
,	c
that	c
the	c
atmosphere	c
was	c
infectious	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
a	c
little	c
bit	c
disappointed	c
about	i
their	c
attitude	c
.	c

Whatever	i
,	i
if	i
you	c
ever	c
will	i
have	i
the	c
opportunity	c
to	c
do	c
something	c
like	c
this	c
then	c
do	c
it	c
without	c
hesitating	c
.	c

I	c
liked	c
to	i
see	i
their	c
way	c
of	c
life	c
.	c

Lots	c
of	c
love	c
,	c

To	c
.	c

Hi	c
.	c

My	c
name	c
is	c
Taeron	c
Jon	c
.	c

And	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
inform	c
you	c
that	c
something	c
is	c
not	c
right	c
and	c
unfair	i
about	c
your	c
theatre	c
.	c

I	c
recently	c
had	c
a	c
week	c
's	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
you	i
said	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
is	i
in	c
the	c
play	c
but	c
different	i
actor	c
was	c
in	c
the	c
roll	i
.	c

It	c
was	c
just	c
unbelievably	c
disappointing	c
because	c
the	c
reason	c
I	i
mean	c
main	i
reason	c
which	i
made	c
me	c
to	i
go	i
was	c
to	c
see	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
.	c

Secondly	c
about	i
the	c
time	c
.	c

lastly	i
about	c
the	c
ticket	c
advertisment	i
saids	i
'	c
Discouts	i
Available	c
'	c
but	c
no	c
way	c
I	i
had	c
to	c
pad	i
full	i
Â£	c
20.00	c
and	c
restaurant	i
was	c
closed	c
because	c
of	c
rebuilding	c
something	i
.	c

How	i
ever	i
the	i
point	c
that	c
it	i
am	c
trying	c
to	c
say	i
is	c
you	i
just	c
ruined	c
my	c
hoilday	i
.	c

For	c
me	c
,	c
It	c
's	c
not	c
easy	c
to	c
have	i
holiday	i
and	c
your	c
play	c
just	c
blew	c
my	c
precious	c
time	c
away	c
.	c

Let	c
me	c
make	c
it	c
clear	c
,	c
you	c
blew	i
my	c
time	c
and	c
money	c
.	c

and	c
I	c
have	c
right	i
to	c
get	c
a	i
fair	c
treatment	c
as	c
a	c
costomer	i
.	c

So	c
therefore	i
I	i
would	c
like	c
you	c
to	c
pay	c
some	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
not	c
asking	c
for	c
full	c
payment	c
but	c
minimum	i
50	c
%	c
that	i
it	i
paid	c
for	c
nothing	c
but	c
the	c
disappoint	i
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
.	c

Fashion	c
of	c
the	c
future	c
.	c

Fashion	c
,	c
what	c
is	c
fashion	c
?	c

Popular	c
design	c
of	c
cloths	i
.	c

In	c
particular	i
time	c
?	c

What	c
about	c
after	c
100	c
years	c
?	c

I	c
believe	c
we	c
'll	c
be	c
more	c
into	c
fashionable	c
stuffs	i
.	c

As	c
I	c
said	c
before	c
,	c
fashion	c
is	c
somehow	c
influenced	c
by	c
science	c
and	c
insperations	i
that	c
we	c
get	c
from	c
all	c
sort	i
of	c
enviroment	i
.	c

These	c
days	c
we	c
are	c
very	c
intrested	i
in	c
space	c
and	c
millenium	i
and	c
things	c
and	c
many	c
designers	c
showed	i
millenium	i
looks	c
recently	c
.	c

But	c
what	c
about	c
100	c
year	i
later	c
?	c

I	c
expect	c
human	c
being	i
'll	i
live	c
in	i
the	i
other	c
planets	c
and	c
trevel	i
around	c
under	c
sea	i
.	c

It	c
could	c
be	c
more	c
facinating	i
.	c

Endless	c
imagination	c
and	c
development	c
of	c
technology	c
will	c
lead	c
us	c
to	c
future	c
fashion	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
letting	c
me	c
know	c
that	c
I	c
've	c
won	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
let	c
you	c
know	c
that	c
I	c
can	c
only	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
that	c
is	c
the	c
only	c
time	c
I	c
can	c
take	c
leave	i
from	c
work	c
.	c

For	c
activities	c
choices	i
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
choose	c
Tennis	c
and	c
swimming	c
.	c

Swimming	c
is	c
my	c
best	i
way	c
of	c
excercise	i
and	c
keeping	c
fit	c
.	c

How	c
much	c
money	c
I	i
should	i
have	c
with	c
me	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
cover	c
all	c
other	c
expenses	c
?	c

Thank	c
you	c
once	c
again	c
for	c
giving	c
me	c
good	i
news	c
!	c

I	c
find	c
shopping	c
is	c
the	i
most	i
time	c
consuming	c
.	c

If	c
I	c
'm	c
not	c
lucky	c
enough	c
to	c
find	c
one	i
,	c
then	c
I	i
'll	i
have	i
to	c
take	c
a	c
train	c
trip	i
to	c
a	c
larger	c
shopping	c
places	i
such	c
as	c
London	c
.	c

To	c
walk	c
around	c
London	c
streets	c
looking	c
for	c
a	c
pair	c
of	c
shoe	i
can	c
definitely	c
be	c
a	c
tiring	c
task	c
.	c

At	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
the	c
day	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
not	c
only	c
be	c
carrying	c
pile	i
of	c
shopping	c
bags	c
but	c
also	c
trying	c
to	c
squeeze	c
in	c
between	c
other	c
passengers	c
on	c
the	c
train	c
on	c
my	c
way	c
home	c
.	c

By	c
the	c
time	c
I	c
get	i
home	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
be	c
completely	c
exhausted	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
can	c
see	c
,	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

I	c
AM	c
WRITING	c
IN	c
ORDER	c
TO	c
COMPLAIN	c
FOR	i
THE	c
TERRIBLE	c
NIGHT	c
I	c
HAD	c
IN	c
YOUR	c
THEATRE	c
.	c

FIRSTLY	c
I	c
WANT	c
TO	c
COMPLAIN	c
ABOUT	c
WHAT	c
YOU	c
WROTE	c
ON	i
THE	c
BROCHURE	c
.	c

I	c
WAS	c
DISAPPOINTED	c
TO	c
FIND	c
OUT	c
THAT	c
THE	c
ACTOR	c
WAS	c
NOT	c
THE	c
ONE	c
YOU	c
WROTE	c
I	i
DISCOVERED	c
THIS	c
ONLY	c
WHEN	c
THE	c
PLAY	c
STARTED	c
,	c
AND	c
IT	i
WAS	c
VERY	c
LATE	c
!	c

FINALLY	c
I	c
COULD	c
N'T	c
EAT	c
TOO	i
.	c

FOR	c
THESE	c
REASONS	c
I	c
WOULD	c
LIKE	c
TO	c
ASK	c
FOR	c
MY	c
MONEY	c
BACK	c
.	c

BECAUSE	c
FOR	c
ME	c
IT	c
WAS	c
NOT	c
A	c
"	c
PERFECT	c
EVENING	c
OUT	c
"	c
.	c

I	c
AM	c
SURE	c
THIS	c
LETTER	c
WILL	c
RECEIVE	c
YOUR	c
PROMPT	c
ATTENTION	c
.	c

YOURS	c
FAITHFULLY	c

UNFORTUNATELY	c
,	c
PAT	c
WAS	c
NOT	c
VERY	c
GOOD	c
AT	c
KEEPING	c
SECRETS	c
.	c

THIS	c
WAS	c
LIKE	c
AN	c
ILLNESS	c
FOR	c
HIM	c
.	c

SO	c
MANY	c
TIME	i
HE	c
WAS	c
TOLD	c
:	c
"	c
PAT	c
I	i
SAY	i
THIS	c
SECRET	c
ONLY	c
TO	c
YOU	c
"	c
.	c

THIS	c
WAS	c
TERRIBLE	c
FOR	c
HIS	c
FRIENDSHIP	i
:	c
HE	c
ALWAYS	c
LOST	c
HIS	c
FRIENDS	c
.	c

HE	c
WANTED	c
TO	c
DIE	c
FOR	i
THIS	c
.	c

THE	c
WORST	c
THING	c
IS	i
THAT	c
HE	c
COULD	c
NOT	c
IMPROVE	c
THIS	c
BEHAVIOUR	c
.	c

ONE	c
DAY	c
THE	i
FORTUNE	c
HELPED	c
OUR	c
POOR	c
PAT	c
.	c

PAT	c
,	c
AS	c
HE	c
ALWAYS	c
DID	c
,	c
COULD	c
N'T	c
KEEP	c
THE	c
SECRET	c
,	c
EVEN	c
IF	c
HE	c
WAS	c
SCARED	c
.	c

Instead	c
,	c
you	c
changed	c
actor	i
without	c
any	c
warning	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
find	i
my	c
favourite	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
with	i
my	i
total	c
disappointment	c
,	c
as	c
his	c
substitute	c
could	c
n't	c
catch	i
him	i
up	i
at	c
all	c
.	c

Another	c
thing	c
that	c
made	c
me	c
angry	c
was	c
that	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
have	i
a	c
discount	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

Most	c
people	c
think	c
modern	c
technologies	c
are	c
n't	c
so	i
positive	c
as	c
they	c
are	c
often	c
showed	i
.	i

My	c
personal	c
theory	c
is	c
completely	c
different	c
.	c

We	c
live	c
in	c
the	c
age	c
of	c
personal	c
computers	c
,	c
of	c
internet	i
,	c
of	c
the	c
mobile	c
phones	i
,	c
and	c
now	c
for	c
me	c
it	c
's	c
impossible	c
to	c
think	c
of	c
a	c
world	c
without	c
them	c
.	c

It	i
'	i
already	c
four	c
years	c
since	c
I	c
bought	c
my	c
first	c
cellular	c
phone	c
(	c
then	i
I	c
changed	i
it	c
many	c
times	c
)	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
always	c
very	c
useful	c
for	c
me	c
:	c
everyone	c
can	c
speak	c
with	c
me	c
wherever	c
I	c
am	c
.	c

When	c
,	c
for	c
example	c
,	c
I	c
go	c
abroad	c
I	c
feel	c
closer	c
to	c
my	c
friend	i
and	c
to	c
my	c
family	c
than	c
before	c
.	c

Anyway	c
,	c
the	c
thing	c
that	c
has	c
most	i
changed	i
my	i
daily	i
life	i
is	c
the	c
personal	c
computer	c
and	c
,	c
expecially	i
,	c
internet	i
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
now	c
I	c
'm	c
writing	c
my	c
thesis	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
use	c
my	c
pc	i
everytime	i
I	c
have	c
to	c
write	c
a	c
document	c
in	i
a	i
perfect	i
form	i
.	c

Then	c
,	c
surfing	c
in	i
internet	i
is	c
becoming	c
my	c
passion	c
:	c
it	c
's	c
incredible	c
how	c
many	c
unthinkable	c
activities	c
you	c
can	c
do	c
with	c
it	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
simply	c
fantastic	c
!	c

On	i
your	c
advertisement	c
,	c
you	c
have	i
written	c
that	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
would	c
be	c
performing	c
.	c

Also	c
,	c
the	c
times	c
printed	c
on	i
your	c
advertisment	i
was	i
14.30	c
and	c
19:30	c
.	c

I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
19:30	c
show	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
did	c
not	c
start	c
until	c
it	c
was	c
20:15	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
my	c
evening	c
planned	c
out	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
not	c
pleased	c
that	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
forty-five	c
minutes	c
late	c
.	c

On	i
your	c
advertisment	i
,	c
it	c
said	c
that	c
discounts	c
were	c
available	c
for	c
the	c
tickets	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
rather	c
thirsty	c
and	c
hungry	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
and	c
on	i
your	c
advertisment	i
,	i
it	i
made	c
a	c
cup	c
of	c
tea	c
and	c
some	c
cakes	c
in	c
your	c
restaurant	c
sound	c
rather	c
inviting	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
to	c
my	c
disappointment	c
,	c
the	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
being	c
redecorated	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
not	c
my	c
'	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
'	c
,	c
as	c
your	c
advertisment	i
said	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
some	c
refund	i
back	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
would	i
give	c
these	c
problems	c
your	c
immediate	c
attention	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

I	c
trusted	c
her	c
!	c

I	c
was	c
seething	c
.	c

I	c
moved	c
away	c
that	c
year	c
,	c
away	i
to	c
a	c
whole	c
new	c
place	c
and	c
a	c
whole	c
new	c
school	c
.	c

Once	c
in	c
a	c
while	c
my	c
old	c
schoolmates	c
came	c
and	c
visited	c
me	c
and	c
we	c
had	c
lots	c
of	c
fun	c
together	c
,	c
just	c
like	c
the	c
old	c
times	c
.	c

My	c
dad	c
began	c
packing	c
his	c
things	c
the	c
very	c
next	c
day	c
,	c
to	i
his	c
new	c
apartment	c
where	c
he	c
would	c
live	c
while	c
waiting	c
for	c
the	c
divorce	c
papers	c
and	i
signing	i
them	i
.	c

I	c
went	c
into	c
a	c
depression	c
,	c
and	c
not	i
matter	c
who	c
tried	c
to	c
make	c
me	c
feel	c
better	c
,	c
I	c
only	c
felt	c
worse	c
.	c

She	c
was	c
a	c
person	c
I	c
could	c
turn	c
to	c
,	c
I	c
could	c
trust	c
.	c

Ever	c
since	c
,	c
she	c
gained	i
my	c
trust	c
and	c
told	i
her	c
my	c
feelings	c
and	c
secrets	c
.	c

She	c
kept	c
every	c
single	c
one	c
of	c
my	c
secrets	c
well	c
,	c
and	c
not	i
surprisingly	c
,	c
she	c
became	c
my	c
best	c
friend	c
.	c

Eventually	c
,	c
I	c
got	c
over	c
my	c
parents	c
'	c
divorce	c
and	c
lived	c
like	c
a	c
normal	c
,	c
happy	c
teenager	c
.	c

The	c
news	c
shook	c
me	c
to	c
the	c
very	c
core	c
.	c

I	c
cried	c
for	c
days	c
straight	i
,	c
eating	c
and	c
sleeping	c
very	c
little	c
.	c

I	c
am	i
still	i
missing	i
Pat	c
,	c
but	c
my	c
pain	c
is	c
nearly	c
over	c
now	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
only	c
comfort	c
myself	c
by	c
reminding	c
myself	c
that	c
at	c
least	c
she	c
died	c
knowing	c
I	c
had	c
forgiven	c
her	c
for	c
telling	c
my	c
secret	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
read	c
the	c
programme	c
and	c
I	c
find	c
it	c
very	c
appealing	c
,	c
specially	i
because	c
of	c
the	c
River	c
trip	c
to	c
Greenwich	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
seen	c
an	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
wondering	c
if	c
we	c
could	c
visit	c
it	c
.	c

The	c
students	c
are	c
free	i
so	c
we	c
wo	c
n't	c
have	c
to	c
pay	c
for	c
the	c
visit	c
.	c

We	c
all	c
think	c
this	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
to	c
learn	c
more	c
about	c
London	i
daily	i
life	c
and	c
what	c
people	c
like	c
to	c
wear	c
.	c

We	c
all	c
hope	c
you	c
would	i
consider	c
our	c
suggestion	c
.	c

Yours	c
Sincerely	c
,	c

Almost	c
everyone	c
hates	c
other	c
people	c
gossip	i
in	i
their	c
private	c
things	i
.	c

So	c
I	c
think	c
famous	c
people	c
,	c
no	c
matter	c
if	c
they	c
are	c
politicians	c
or	c
films	i
stars	c
do	i
n't	c
deserve	c
being	i
followed	c
by	c
journalists	c
every	c
time	c
they	c
are	c
trying	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
good	c
time	c
.	c

I	c
thing	i
that	c
journalit	i
's	i
only	c
aim	c
is	c
money	c
,	c
be	i
cause	i
they	c
know	c
that	c
if	c
they	c
publish	i
famous	c
people	c
's	c
private	c
life	i
they	c
would	i
earn	c
lot	i
's	i
of	c
money	c
selling	c
the	c
magazine	c
or	c
the	c
newspaper	c
.	c

Sometimes	c
the	c
journalit	i
's	i
aim	c
is	c
n't	c
the	c
money	c
:	c
there	c
are	c
some	c
journalists	c
who	c
may	c
try	c
to	c
spoil	c
the	i
politician	c
's	c
or	c
film	c
star	c
's	c
career	c
only	c
because	c
they	c
are	c
jealous	c
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
no	c
matter	c
which	i
or	i
what	c
the	c
journalit	i
's	i
aims	c
are	c
,	c
famous	c
people	c
deserve	c
to	c
have	c
their	c
problems	c
,	c
their	c
affairs	c
,	c
their	c
private	c
life	i
just	c
as	c
normal	c
people	c

Dear	c
Manager	c
,	c

I	c
saw	c
your	c
advertisment	i
of	i
your	c
show	c
in	i
the	c
circle	c
theatre	c
,	c
over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
.	c

I	c
went	c
to	c
it	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
was	c
really	c
disappointed	c
about	c
some	i
thing	i
.	c

First	c
the	c
musical	i
show	c
,	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
started	i
at	c
20:15	c
,	c
and	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
was	i
written	c
at	i
19:30	c
,	i
then	i
also	i
was	i
written	c
that	c
the	c
actor	c
was	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
but	c
in	c
the	c
show	c
appeared	i
a	i
different	i
actor	i
,	c
that	c
was	c
really	c
disappointing	c
.	c

Also	c
was	i
written	c
in	c
the	c
advertisment	i
that	c
some	c
discounts	c
were	c
available	c
,	c
but	c
there	c
was	i
n't	i
discounts	i
.	c

And	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
time	c
that	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
went	i
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

Mr	i
,	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
disappointed	c
with	c
the	c
show	c
so	c
I	c
want	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
sure	c
you	c
will	c
understand	c
my	c
reasons	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
,	c
and	c
she	c
went	c
to	c
her	c
house	c
to	c
speak	i
about	c
the	c
things	c
I	c
had	c
told	c
her	c
.	c

First	c
she	c
said	c
to	c
her	c
father	c
,	c
then	c
to	c
her	c
mother	c
and	c
finally	c
to	c
her	c
brother	c
,	c
that	c
I	c
was	c
from	c
another	c
planet	c
called	c
Orion	c
,	c
that	c
was	c
a	c
billion	c
kilometer	i
distance	i
of	i
Earth	c
and	c
that	i
I	c
was	c
so	c
ashamed	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
his	i
boyfriend	c
since	c
I	c
have	i
came	i
to	c
Earth	c
.	c

Since	c
then	c
I	c
live	i
in	c
Area	c
57	c
,	c
and	c
this	c
is	c
my	c
diary	c
life	i
.	c

I	c
'm	c
writting	i
to	c
you	c
because	c
I	i
've	i
been	i
in	i
the	c
International	c
Arts	c
Festival	c
and	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
pleasure	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
congratulate	c
you	c
for	i
the	c
idea	c
,	i
I	c
think	c
that	c
it	i
's	i
very	i
important	i
the	i
development	i
of	i
the	i
arts	i
and	c
that	c
everybody	c
could	c
assist	i
without	c
paying	c
too	c
much	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
I	c
must	c
tell	c
you	c
that	c
some	c
concert	c
halls	c
are	c
too	c
small	c
,	c
so	c
you	c
ca	c
n't	c
be	c
enough	i
confortable	i
to	c
apreciate	i
the	c
event	c
.	c

Other	i
thing	c
,	i
is	c
that	c
the	c
artists	c
come	c
only	c
from	c
six	c
countries	c
,	c
so	c
do	c
n't	c
cheat	i
the	i
people	c
by	c
saying	c
that	c
they	c
are	c
from	c
all	c
the	i
world	c
.	c

Well	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
everything	i
is	i
told	i
but	c
could	c
you	c
tell	c
me	c
,	c
if	c
it	i
's	i
possible	c
,	c
if	c
there	c
will	c
be	c
more	c
plays	c
and	c
films	c
next	c
year	c
?	c

I	c
'm	c
waiting	c
for	c
your	c
answer	c
.	c

Faithfully	i
,	c

Dear	c
Jane	c
,	c

As	c
you	c
want	i
me	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
how	i
about	i
the	i
rules	i
are	i
here	i
,	c
I	c
'll	c
start	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
in	c
our	c
classroom	c
you	c
ca	c
n't	c
shout	c
,	c
you	c
must	c
be	c
quite	i
and	c
sat	i
.	i

You	c
must	c
pay	i
attention	i
always	i
because	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
if	c
the	c
teacher	c
will	c
ask	c
you	c
some	c
question	c
.	c

In	c
exams	c
,	c
you	c
ca	c
n't	c
talk	c
to	c
the	c
teacher	c
,	c
either	i
you	c
must	c
n't	c
eat	c
chuingham	i
or	c
take	c
a	c
walkman	i
with	c
you	c
.	c

My	c
mum	c
only	i
does	c
n't	c
want	c
me	c
to	c
arrive	c
late	c
.	c

My	c
mum	c
is	c
a	c
lovely	c
woman	c
and	c
she	c
does	c
n't	c
know	c
how	c
much	c
I	c
love	c
her	c
because	c
most	c
of	c
the	c
day	c
I	c
'm	c
outside	c
,	c
but	c
that	c
's	c
the	c
true	i
.	c

My	c
father	c
is	c
a	c
bit	c
jealous	c
but	c
agrees	c
with	c
what	c
my	c
mum	c
says	c
.	c

I	i
'd	i
like	i
it	i
would	i
be	i
nicer	i
going	i
there	i
.	c

I	c
have	c
just	c
received	c
the	c
letter	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

On	i
the	c
letter	c
is	i
asking	i
when	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
?	i

Also	c
I	c
prefer	i
the	i
Camp	i
California	i
because	c
I	c
have	c
just	c
finish	i
my	c
military	c
service	c
and	c
I	c
got	c
use	i
to	c
live	i
in	i
the	c
campus	i
.	c

Their	i
is	i
two	c
activities	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
good	c
in	i
Basketball	c
and	c
tenis	i
.	c

If	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
get	i
money	c
and	c
clothes	c
with	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hear	i
from	c
you	c
!	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Last	c
month	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
great	c
time	c
in	c
Derby	c
.	c

I	c
went	c
with	c
Big	c
Brothers	c
the	i
name	c
of	c
the	c
band	c
.	c

This	c
group	c
was	c
looking	c
for	c
Manager	i
.	c

I	c
went	c
for	c
interview	i
and	c
I	c
got	c
the	c
job	c
.	c

They	c
did	c
not	c
new	i
each	c
one	i
.	c

They	c
just	c
meet	i
each	c
one	i
a	c
month	c
ago	c
.	c

During	i
the	i
time	i
before	c
the	c
consert	i
I	c
had	c
to	c
look	i
if	i
every	i
one	i
was	c
present	c
.	c

Also	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
look	c
for	c
dried	i
place	c
in	c
case	c
it	c
was	c
raining	c
.	c

I	c
really	c
liked	c
.	i

I	c
had	c
to	c
run	c
all	c
the	c
times	i
.	c

This	c
was	c
my	c
job	c
and	c
I	c
like	i
what	c
I	c
am	i
doing	c
.	c

I	i
hope	i
all	i
the	i
best	i
for	i
you	i
!	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
extremely	c
excited	c
about	c
the	c
opportunity	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
your	c
camp	c
in	c
the	c
USA	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
I	c
am	c
studying	c
at	c
University	c
and	c
I	c
wonder	c
if	c
I	c
could	c
travel	c
on	i
July	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
exams	c
I	c
have	c
on	i
May	c
.	c

Apart	i
from	i
that	i
I	c
would	c
not	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
travel	c
there	c
until	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
June	c
.	c

The	c
activities	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
do	c
most	c
are	c
playing	c
basketball	c
and	c
Climbing	c
.	c

The	c
first	c
one	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
played	i
basketball	c
since	c
the	c
age	c
of	c
twelve	c
and	c
the	c
second	c
one	c
because	c
there	c
are	c
not	c
many	c
places	c
where	i
to	c
go	c
climbing	c
in	c
my	c
city	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

I	c
received	c
your	c
letter	c
last	c
week	c
in	c
which	c
you	c
told	c
me	c
that	c
you	c
want	c
to	c
hear	c
about	c
my	c
experience	c
at	c
the	c
pop	c
concert	c
.	c

We	c
have	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
problems	c
from	c
the	c
beggining	i
.	c

If	c
it	c
were	i
n't	i
a	c
calm	c
and	c
quite	i
public	i
,	c
we	c
would	c
have	c
had	c
troubles	i
.	c

As	c
you	c
can	c
see	c
,	c
hardly	c
anything	c
went	c
well	c
,	c
but	c
the	c
lights	c
and	c
the	c
sound	c
-	c
both	i
in	i
wich	i
I	c
helped	c
carrying	i
things	c
-	c
were	c
appropriate	c
for	c
the	c
concert	c
.	c

Looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

Love	c
,	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
express	c
my	c
dissatisfaction	c
with	c
International	i
Arts	c
Festival	c
,	c
which	c
was	c
organised	c
by	c
you	c
last	c
year	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
written	c
on	i
the	c
advertisment	i
that	c
there	c
would	c
be	c
stars	c
and	c
artist	i
from	c
around	c
the	c
world	c
I	i
believe	c
that	c
it	c
's	c
difficult	c
to	c
arrange	c
meetings	c
with	c
foreign	c
stars	c
but	c
there	c
were	c
artist	i
from	c
only	c
six	c
countries	c
and	c
in	c
my	c
opinion	c
there	c

That	c
was	c
the	c
reason	c
why	c
some	c
people	c
were	c
complaining	c
.	c

That	c
was	c
excelent	i
because	c
it	c
attracted	c
peoples	i
'	i
attention	c

Lastly	c
,	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
a	c
piece	c
of	c
advice	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
'll	c
look	c
into	c
these	c
matters	c
and	c
improve	c
the	c
festival	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c

Yours	c
sincerly	i

They	c
have	c
to	c
think	c
about	c
some	i
season	i
jobs	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
the	i
good	c
way	c
to	c
earn	c
money	c
is	c
,	i
to	c
help	c
the	c
old	c
.	c

They	c
often	i
are	i
not	c
able	c
to	c
do	c
shopping	i
or	c
walk	c
the	c
dog	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
help	c
them	c
,	c
they	c
may	c
give	c
you	c
some	c
money	c
as	c
a	c
reward	c
.	c

You	c
can	c
work	c
in	c
storage	c
,	c
look	c
after	c
the	c
goods	c
or	c
catch	c
shoplifters	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
are	c
good	i
musician	c
you	c
will	c
get	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
money	c
.	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
travel	i
on	i
July	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
going	c
to	c
finish	c
the	i
college	c
at	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
June	c
and	c
I	c
will	c
work	c
the	i
first	c
of	c
august	i
.	c

Second	i
of	i
all	i
,	c

About	i
the	c
accomodation	i
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
,	i
I	c
think	c
that	c
will	c
be	c
more	i
safety	i
about	i
all	c
my	c
stuff	i
.	c

I	c
'm	c
very	c
keen	c
to	c
have	c
the	c
chance	c
to	c
do	i
some	c
activities	c
,	i
I	c
'm	c
very	c
attracted	i
by	i
the	c
golf	c
.	c

I	c
will	c
be	c
a	c

never	c
done	c
this	c
sport	c
before	c
but	c
I	c
will	c
have	c
a	c
try	c

Also	c
,	c

surfing	c

I	c
love	c

sport	c
.	c

I	c
've	c
been	c
practicing	i
this	c
sport	c
since	i
5	c
years	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
'm	c
quiet	i
good	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
last	c
letter	c
,	i
I	i
'm	i
really	c
envy	c
you	c
holiday	i
under	i
the	c
sun	c
.	c

Last	c
month	c
was	c
amazing	c
for	c
me	c
,	i
I	c
was	c
helping	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
.	c

The	c
stage	c
was	c
gigantesque	i
the	c
crowed	i
could	i
be	i
all	i
around	i
.	c

I	c
really	c
enjoyed	c
to	i
be	i
next	c
to	c
the	c
pop	c
stars	c
I	i
got	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
autographes	i
,	i
that	i
was	c
the	c
first	c
time	c
I	c
've	c
seen	c
like	i
Jagger	i
a	i
lot	c
of	c
well	i
know	i
pop	c
stars	c
was	i
there	c
.	c

I	c
mean	c
It	i
's	i
still	c
inbelivable	i
,	i
can	i
you	c
imagine	c
that	i
was	i
like	i
a	c
dream	c
I	i
was	c
checking	i
their	c
hands	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

I	c
address	c
this	c
letter	c
to	c
the	c
manager	c
of	c
the	c
theatre	c
.	c

Your	c
advertisement	c
was	c
excellent	c
and	c
it	c
gave	c
me	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
enthousiasm	i
.	c

But	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
very	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
and	c
it	c
was	c
because	c
many	i
points	i
.	c

First	c
point	c
,	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
see	c
Danny	c
BROOK	c
as	i
starring	i
.	c

I	c
was	i
coming	i
to	c
see	c
him	c
but	c
there	c
was	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
.	c

Second	c
point	c
,	c
the	c
musical	i
show	c
had	i
to	c
begin	c
at	c
7:30	c
PM	c
but	c
we	c
have	i
waited	i
for	c
fourty	i
five	i
minutes	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
show	c
started	i
.	c

Third	c
point	c
,	c
your	c
advertisement	c
told	c
about	i
"	i
discount	c
available	c
"	c
about	i
the	c
ticket	i
's	i
price	i
but	c
it	i
was	c
n't	c
.	i

Fourth	c
point	c
,	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
visit	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
and	c
no	c
one	c
did	i
n't	i
know	i
why	c
!	c

We	c
can	c
find	c
some	c
everywhere	c
.	c

Then	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
's	c
interssant	i
to	c
answer	c
the	c
following	c
question	c
:	c

How	c
has	c
modern	c
technology	c
changed	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
?	c

My	c
plan	c
will	i
be	i
very	c
simple	c
:	c
a	c
description	c
in	i
a	i
first	c
time	i
and	c
an	c
analysis	c
in	i
a	i
second	c
time	i
.	c

After	i
,	c
when	c
I	c
take	i
my	c
breakfast	c
,	c
I	c
use	c
my	c
toaster	c
for	c
my	c
bread	c
and	c
,	c
as	c
I	c
want	c
a	i
hot	c
milk	c
,	c
I	c
use	c
my	c
modern	c
oven	i
too	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
go	c
to	c
school	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
see	c
in	i
many	i
stores	i
the	i
new	i
tools	i
they	i
've	i
just	i
received	i
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
if	c
it	c
is	c
good	c
or	c
bad	c
but	c
we	c
are	c
a	c
generation	c
who	i
's	i
grown	c
up	c
with	c
technologies	i
progress	c
.	c

Dear	c
Jane	c
Clark	c
,	c
the	c
organiser	c
of	c
International	i
Arts	c
Festival	c

I	c
'm	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
citizen	i
that	c
enjoyed	c
the	c
last	c
International	c
Arts	c
Festival	c
.	c

Most	c
of	c
attractions	i
are	i
excellent	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
point	c
out	c
that	c
"	i
quality	i
is	i
high	i
,	i
but	i
quantity	i
is	i
not	i
enough	i
!	i
.	c

And	c
others	c
could	c
n't	c
enter	c
the	c
hall	c
.	c

But	c
"	i
All	i
in	i
one	i
ticket	c
"	c
was	c
a	c
good	c
idea	c
.	c

Because	c
it	i
's	i
easy	i
to	c
manage	c
the	c
artist	i
schedule	c
and	c
audience	i
can	c
enjoy	c
the	i
live	i
.	c

I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
Festival	c
again	c
!	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

And	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
answer	c
for	i
your	c
question	c
.	c

The	c
gap	c
between	c
them	c
is	c
tremendously	c
big	c
!	c

I	c
can	c
say	c
the	c
action	i
which	c
is	i
prohibitted	i
at	c
school	c
is	i
no	c
problem	c
at	c
home	c
.	c

Because	c
the	c
purpose	c
of	c
school	c
rules	c
is	c
not	c
only	c
discipline	i
but	c
also	c
unify	i
.	c

In	c
addition	c
"	c
the	c
students	c
must	c
not	c
use	c
any	c
commercial	c
paper	c
bags	c
(	c
received	i
at	c
department	i
store	c
etc	c
)	c
"	c
.	c

Now	c
you	c
know	c
the	c
reason	c
!	c

Do	c
you	c
have	c
any	c
rules	c
at	c
school	c
that	c
make	c
you	c
upset	c
?	c

If	c
you	c
have	c
please	c
tell	c
me	c
.	c

Yours	i
faithfully	i

But	c
,	i
the	i
last	c
Friday	c
,	c
we	c
have	i
seen	i
an	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
"	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
.	i

Now	c
,	c
we	c
want	c
to	c
know	c
if	c
it	c
is	c
possible	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
watch	i
this	c
Show	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
14th	c
March	c
in	c
the	c
Central	c
Exhibition	c
Hall	c
between	c
10.00	c
and	c
19.00	c
.	c

We	c
think	c
that	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
just	c
one	i
time	i
per	c
year	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
free	c
for	c
stundents	i
.	c

If	c
it	c
is	c
possible	c
,	c
we	c
want	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
"	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
"	c
and	c
do	i
n't	i
go	c
shopping	c
.	c

We	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
dangerous	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
knew	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
.	c

Last	c
July	c
,	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
spend	c
two	c
weeks	c
with	c
my	c
best	c
in	i
a	c
beautiful	c
village	c
in	c
the	c
south	c
of	c
France	c
,	c
near	c
Saint-Tropez	c
.	c

My	c
aunt	c
told	c
me	c
it	c
was	c
the	i
famous	c
French	c
singer	c
's	c
house	c
.	c

I	c
loocked	i
outside	c
and	c
saw	c
two	c
men	c
go	c
into	c
the	c
house	c
in	c
front	c
of	c
mine	c
.	c

They	c
went	c
into	c
the	c
house	c
through	c
a	c
window	c
.	c

I	c
though	i
it	c
was	c
some	c
rubbers	i
.	c

I	c
said	c
to	c
my	c
friend	c
that	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
see	c
and	c
he	c
must	c
phone	c
to	i
the	c
police	c
.	c

When	c
the	c
other	c
man	c
came	c
out	c
,	c
I	c
caught	c
him	c
and	c
fighted	i
him	c
.	c

The	c
first	c
man	c
went	c
away	c
,	i
because	c
a	c
police	c
car	c
arrived	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
,	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
show	c
,	i
that	c
I	c
have	i
recently	i
attended	i
to	i
at	c
your	c
theatre	c
.	c

During	c
my	c
visit	c
there	c
occurred	i
some	i
problems	i
,	i
that	c
made	c
my	c
evening	c
completely	c
disappointing	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
as	i
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
buy	c
a	c
ticket	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
informed	c
that	c
no	c
discounts	c
were	c
available	c
.	c

To	c
make	c
matters	c
even	c
worse	c
,	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
without	c
any	c
information	c
given	i
about	c
the	c
reason	c
of	i
it	i
's	i
closure	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
see	c
,	c
my	c
evening	c
in	c
your	c
theatre	c
absolutely	i
was	c
n't	c
perfect	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
I	c
will	c
get	c
a	c
full	c
refund	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

I	c
would	c
answer	c
"	c
yes	c
"	c
for	i
both	c
questions	c
.	c

And	c
if	c
I	c
were	c
asked	c
,	c
what	i
will	c
be	c
completely	c
different	c
in	c
year	i
2100	c
,	c
I	i
would	c
say	c
:	c
clothes	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
if	c
the	c
weather	c
is	c
so	c
good	c
people	c
will	c
very	c
quickly	c
forget	c
about	c
any	c
winter	c
clothes	c
.	c

What	c
is	c
more	c
,	c
ground	i
will	c
be	c
so	c
hot	c
,	i
that	c
going	i
will	c
only	c
be	c
possible	c
in	c
huge	c
shoes	c
,	c
which	c
should	i
be	c
massive	c
,	c
but	c
not	c
heavy	c
at	c
all	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
this	c
letter	c
to	c
give	c
my	c
opinion	c
on	c
the	c
last	c
International	c
arts	i
festival	i
.	c

Secondly	c
the	i
plays	c
and	c
films	c
were	c
very	c
good	i
organized	c
despide	i
being	i
short	i
number	i
.	c

I	c
suggest	c
to	i
do	i
a	c
couple	c
more	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

The	c
art	c
exhibition	c
showed	c
us	c
a	c
new	c
life	i
style	i
and	c
society	c
,	i
it	i
was	c
totaly	i
different	c
from	c
ours	c
.	c

The	c
talks	c
by	c
writers	c
were	c
very	c
tecnic	i
but	c
it	i
could	c
be	c
understood	c
by	c
all	c
the	c
people	c
who	c
were	c
in	i
the	c
festival	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
I	c
am	i
impresed	i
on	i
all	c
the	c
good	c
organisation	c
,	c
the	c
service	c
and	c
the	c
cost	c
of	c
the	c
weekend	c
ticket	c
for	c
all	c
events	c
.	c

The	c
price	c
has	i
been	i
excelent	i
because	c
there	c
was	c
n't	c
any	c
limit	i
of	i
hours	i
.	c

I	c
hope	c
that	c
you	c
organice	i
this	c
festival	c
for	c
all	c
the	c
following	i
years	c
.	c

Your	i
Sincerely	c

Dear	c
Alice	c
,	c

How	c
are	c
you	c
?	c

I	i
'm	i
pleased	c
to	c
hear	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
already	c
know	c
I	c
go	c
to	c
an	c
English	c
school	c
,	c
Bear	c
House	c
,	c
in	c
Spain	c
.	c

At	c
school	c
you	c
are	c
n't	c
allowed	c
to	c
bring	c
connected	i
movil	i
phones	c
although	c
there	c
are	i
more	c
than	c
one	c
student	c
that	c
does	c
it	i
.	c

As	i
well	i
you	i
are	i
n't	i
allowed	c
to	c
bring	c
drugs	c
or	c
arms	c
,	c
to	c
smoke	c
or	c
to	c
drink	c
alcohol	c
inside	c
the	c
school	c
.	c

In	i
case	i
I	c
lie	c
them	i
or	c
do	c
n't	c
explain	c
my	i
plans	c
that	c
my	c
friends	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
I	c
want	i
be	c
able	c
to	c
go	c
out	c
.	c

Answering	i
to	c
you	i
question	c
I	i
wo	i
n't	i
change	c
nothing	i
because	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
these	c
are	c
the	c
minimum	c
rules	c
that	c
a	c
theenager	i
have	i
to	c
have	c
to	c
be	c
responsable	i
in	c
a	i
future	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
the	c
information	c
you	c
requested	c
in	c
your	c
letter	c
dated	c
March	c
,	i
31st	c
,	c
in	c
which	c
you	c
informed	c
me	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
.	c

I	c
can	c
only	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
,	c
because	c
the	c
Hospital	c
I	c
work	c
for	c
has	c
accepted	i
my	c
holidays	c
on	i
that	c
month	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
mind	c
if	c
I	c
travel	c
during	c
the	c
first	c
fortnight	c
or	c
during	c
the	c
second	c
one	c
,	c
although	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
travelling	c
during	c
the	c
second	c
fortnight	c
,	c
if	c
it	c
is	c
possible	c
.	c

Regarding	c
the	c
accommodation	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
staying	c
in	c
log	i
cabins	i
.	c

I	c
have	c
never	c
liked	c
staying	c
in	c
tents	c
because	c
I	c
think	c
they	c
are	c
uncomfortable	c
,	c
especially	c
if	c
the	c
stay	c
is	c
going	c
to	c
last	c
more	c
than	c
two	c
or	c
three	c
days	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
never	c
been	c
good	c
at	c
team	c
sports	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
really	c
like	c
basketball	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
can	c
be	c
very	c
interesting	c
to	c
meet	c
other	c
people	c
by	c
means	c
of	c
this	c
team	c
sport	c
.	c

What	c
type	c
of	c
clothes	c
must	c
I	c
take	c
?	c

Is	c
it	c
necessary	c
to	c
take	c
dressed	i
cloth	i
for	c
any	c
formal	c
events	c
?	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

I	c
have	c
met	c
our	c
favourite	c
singer	c
,	c
Celine	c
Dion	c
!	c

But	c
,	c
first	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
let	c
me	c
explain	c
to	c
you	c
what	c
I	c
did	c
during	c
the	c
concert	c
.	c

We	c
arrived	c
at	c
the	c
stadium	c
the	c
previous	i
evening	i
.	c

They	c
said	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
necessary	c
and	c
we	c
sat	c
down	c
on	c
the	c
grass	c
and	c
observed	c
how	c
the	c
scenary	i
was	c
being	c
prepared	c
for	c
the	c
concert	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
so	c
near	c
her	c
!	c

And	c
she	c
dedicated	c
the	c
photograph	c
to	c
me	c
!	c

I	c
still	c
believe	c
it	c
has	c
only	c
been	c
a	c
dream	c
!	c

I	c
am	c
willing	c
to	c
show	c
you	c
the	c
authograph	i
and	c
the	c
photograph	c
.	c

Please	c
,	c
make	c
sure	c
you	c
can	c
come	c

Let	c
me	c
know	c
if	c
you	c
are	c
going	c
to	c
come	c
so	c
that	c
I	c
prepare	i
the	c
bedroom	c
to	c

you	c

Best	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
from	c
Brazil	c
and	c
I	c
recently	c
expent	i
a	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

During	c
my	c
stay	c
I	c
read	c
an	c
advertisement	c
of	i
a	c
musical	c
show	c
being	c
held	i
at	c
The	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
.	c

As	c
I	c
was	c
reading	c
the	c
advertisement	c
I	c
got	c
very	c
excited	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
great	c
fan	c
of	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
and	c
he	c
was	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
performing	c
in	c
the	c
play	i
.	c

As	i
I	c
got	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
I	c
asked	c
for	c
the	c
discounts	c
shown	c
in	c
your	c
advertisement	c
,	c
but	c
they	c
were	c
not	c
avaible	i
.	c

As	c
you	c
can	c
see	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
the	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
your	c
advertisement	c
talked	c
about	c
.	c

Then	i
,	c
I	c
would	c
be	c
glad	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
have	i
my	i
money	c
back	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

How	c
has	c
modern	c
technology	c
changed	c
your	c
daily	c
lief	i
.	i

Modern	c
technology	c
has	c
brought	c
many	i
discoveries	i
which	c
have	c
made	c
our	c
daily	c
lives	c
much	c
easier	c
.	c

I	c
guess	c
science	c
is	c
about	c
solving	c
our	c
daily	c
problems	c
with	c
technological	c
advances	c
.	c

That	c
is	c
exactly	c
what	c
happens	i
to	c
me	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
was	c
younger	c
I	i
remember	c
that	c
when	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
study	c
or	c
to	c
work	c
on	c
a	c
school	c
project	c
I	c
would	c
take	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
time	c
researching	c
on	i
libraries	c
,	c
looking	c
for	c
old	c
books	c
.	c

Today	c
I	c
can	c
connect	c
to	c
the	c
Internet	c
and	c
find	c
all	c
the	c
information	c
I	c
need	c
faster	c
than	c
you	c
can	c
imagine	c
.	c

everything	c
in	c
a	c
zap	c
.	c

You	c
also	c
have	c
fast	c
food	c
,	c
or	c
food	c
made	c
in	c
the	c
microwave	c
within	c
a	c
few	c
minutes	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
can	c
see	c
,	c
technology	c
is	c
about	c
saving	c
our	i
time	c
,	c
so	c
we	c
may	c
have	c
more	c
time	c
to	c
do	c
what	c
we	c
like	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
technology	c
is	c
making	c
my	c
life	c
much	c
better	c
because	i
of	i
that	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
.	i

We	c
saw	c
your	i
details	c
and	c
enjoyed	i
them	i
.	c

All	c
the	c
students	c
in	c
my	c
class	c
are	c
excited	c
about	c
one	c
more	c
thing	c
.	c

It	c
will	c
be	c
at	c
Central	i
Exhibition	c
Hall	c
,	c
London	c
.	c

One	c
more	c
thing	c
about	c
show	i
is	c
,	i
it	i
's	c
free	c
for	c
students	c
.	c

We	c
hope	c
you	c
an	i
accept	c
our	c
suggestion	c
.	c

It	c
will	i
make	c
us	c
so	c
happy	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Sincerally	i
,	c

A	c
PRIVATE	c
LIFE	c

All	c
people	c
have	c
some	c
difficulties	c
about	i
their	c
job	i
but	c
some	c
of	i
them	i
have	c
more	c
than	c
the	i
others	c
.	c

Having	c
a	c
private	c
life	c
is	c
important	c
for	c
everybody	c
.	c

I	c
know	c
,	i
they	c
are	c
not	c
like	c
us	c
.	c

They	c
are	c
famous	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
think	c
they	c
need	c
to	c
be	c
alone	c
sometimes	c
.	c

We	c
can	c
love	c
them	c
without	c
disturbing	c
too	i
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

Unfortunately	c
the	i
one	c
I	c
saw	c
a	c
week	c
ago	c
in	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
was	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
worst	c
.	c

It	c
is	i
a	c
wasting	i
of	c
time	c
.	c

I	c
must	c
admit	c
I	c
'd	c
been	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
see	i
him	c
.	c

In	c
fact	c
at	i
the	c
stage	c
appeared	c
compleatly	i
different	c
person	c
.	c

Also	c
discounts	i
for	c
tickets	c
was	i
n't	i
available	c
.	c

After	c
the	c
show	c
together	i
with	c
my	c
friends	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
romantic	c
supper	c
,	i
unfortunately	i
it	c
was	c
closed	c
without	i
any	i
sensible	i
reason	c
.	c

At	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
my	c
letter	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
if	c
it	c
is	c
possible	c
to	c
have	c
some	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
be	c
very	c
pleased	c
if	c
you	c
answered	c
my	c
request	c
soon	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

But	c
to	c
make	c
everything	c
clear	c
I	c
'll	c
start	c
from	c
the	c
beggining	i
.	c

It	c
was	c
two	c
years	c
ago	c
.	c

The	i
school	i
finished	c
and	c
we	c
,	c
I	c
mean	c
Pat	c
,	c
Tim	c
and	c
me	c
,	c
did	c
n't	c
know	c
what	c
to	c
do	c
with	c
plenty	i
of	i
spare	c
time	c
.	c

I	c
did	c
n't	c
wanted	i
to	c
spend	c
that	c
holiday	c
with	c
my	c
parents	c
in	c
the	c
country	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
old	c
enough	c
to	c
go	c
somewhere	c
only	c
with	c
my	c
friends	c
.	c

It	c
seemed	c
fantastic	c
but	c
we	c
knew	c
our	c
parents	c
would	c
never	c
agree	c
.	c

We	c
planned	c
to	c
tell	c
them	c
that	c
we	c
were	c
going	c
for	i
a	c
summer	c
camp	c
in	c
the	c
mountains	c
where	c
we	c
would	c
practise	c
French	c
.	c

Parents	i
were	c
very	c
pleased	c
and	c
happy	c
we	c
are	i
so	c
ambisious	i
.	c

Of	c
course	c
we	i
did	c
n't	c
wanted	i
to	c
go	c
there	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
just	c
a	c
"	c
cover	c
"	c
.	c

We	c
promised	c
to	c
keep	c
it	c
in	i
secret	c
.	c

During	c
chat	i
Pat	c
mentioned	c
about	i
sea	i
and	c
her	c
mother	c
found	c
out	c
that	c
something	c
was	c
wrong	c
.	c

As	c
a	c
result	c
we	c
were	c
grouded	i
for	c
all	c
holidays	i
and	c
all	c
because	c
our	i
almost	c
perfect	c
Pat	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
because	c
,	c
as	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
visitors	c
of	c
the	c
International	c
Arts	c
Festival	c
which	c
took	c
place	c
two	c
weeks	c
ago	c
in	c
our	c
city	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
let	c
you	c
know	c
some	c
of	c
my	c
opinions	c
-	c
and	c
suggestions	c
,	c
as	c
well	c
-	c
related	c
with	i
what	c
I	c
saw	c
in	i
the	c
festival	c
and	c
what	c
I	c
could	c
not	c
see	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
would	c
have	c
liked	c
to	c
find	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
must	c
congratulate	c
the	c
people	c
responsible	c
of	i
this	c
good	c
idea	c
.	c

It	i
is	i
known	i
of	i
all	i
the	i
lack	i
of	i
art	i
festivals	i
and	i
cultural	i
activities	i
in	i
general	i
that	i
shows	i
our	i
city	i
.	c

But	c
including	c
only	c
six	c
countries	c
in	c
the	c
festival	c
does	c
not	c
seem	c
enough	c
,	c
in	c
my	c
opinion	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
next	c
year	c
you	c
should	c
invite	c
more	c
different	i
countries	c
,	c
because	c
the	c
festival	c
would	c
be	c
more	c
multicultural	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
there	c
were	c
some	c
problems	i
of	i
accommodation	i
in	c
the	c
classical	c
concerts	c
because	c
some	c
concert	c
halls	c
were	c
too	c
small	c
.	c

Another	c
important	c
thing	c
is	c
that	c
,	c
despite	c
the	c
number	c
and	c
quality	c
of	c
films	c
,	c
there	c
were	c
,	c
from	c
my	c
point	c
of	c
view	c
,	c
not	c
many	c
plays	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
suggest	c
that	c
,	c
in	c
next	c
year	c
's	c
festival	c
,	c
you	c
include	c
different	c
kinds	c
of	c
music	c
,	c
as	i
ska	c
or	c
ethnical	i
music	c
.	c

Who	c
does	c
n't	c
want	c
to	c
earn	c
some	c
money	c
?	c

The	i
topic	i
says	c
that	c
young	c
people	c
have	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
problems	c
,	c
but	c
without	c
any	c
doubt	c
,	c
money	c
is	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
of	c
them	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
still	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
economical	i
freedom	i
from	c
your	c
parents	c
and	c
your	c
studies	c
do	c
n't	c
permit	c
you	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
full-time	c
job	c
,	c
these	c
are	c
some	c
suggestions	c
that	c
maybe	c
will	c
help	c
you	c
.	c

One	c
possible	c
thing	c
is	c
to	c
display	c
in	i
a	i
public	i
place	i
what	i
you	i
can	i
do	i
best	i
,	c
and	c
,	c
then	c
,	c
"	c
sell	c
"	c
it	c
to	c
the	c
people	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
you	c
can	c
dance	i
folk	i
be	i
Hamlet	c
in	c
the	c
street	c
,	c
or	c
even	c
sing	c
with	i
some	i
of	i
your	i
friends	i
a	i
nice	i
song	i
from	i
you	i
country	i
.	c

You	c
do	c
n't	c
need	c
to	c
be	c
a	c
Picasso	c
,	i
it	i
's	i
enough	i
with	i
a	i
bit	i
of	i
imagination	i
.	c

If	c
you	c
like	c
fishing	c
,	c
you	c
can	c
try	c
to	c
colaborate	i
with	c
the	c
local	c
market	c
or	c
some	c
shops	c
,	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
sell	c
them	c
the	c
fish	c
you	c
can	i
achieve	i
by	i
yourself	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
if	c
anything	i
of	c
the	c
above	c
result	i
,	c
you	c
can	i
prepare	i
the	i
classical	i
parties	c
in	c
discos	c
or	c
work	c
as	c
a	c
babysitter	c
It	i
does	c
n't	c
matter	c
how	c
,	c
the	c
aim	c
is	c
always	c
money	c
.	c

Dear	c
Ms	c
,	c
Ryan	c
,	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
to	i
inform	i
me	c
for	i
the	c
prise	i
I	c
had	c
won	c
.	c

I	c
prefer	c
to	c
staying	i
in	c
cabin	i
because	c
never	i
before	i
I	i
when	i
on	i
holidays	i
in	i
tent.	i
,	c
so	c
I	c
think	c
is	i
more	c
corfotabel	i
to	c
sleep	c
in	c
bet	i
instand	i
of	c
outside	c
in	c
tent	i
.	c

The	c
activities	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
do	c
durring	i
these	c
two	c
week	i
it	i
's	i
basketball	c
and	c
swimming	c
.	c

Basketball	i
I	i
think	i
I	i
can	i
playing	i
well	c
,	c
because	c
few	i
years	c
ago	c
I	c
was	c
mamber	i
of	c
the	c
scool	i
team	c
.	c

I	c
look	i
forward	c
for	i
this	c
competition	i

Best	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

I	c
was	c
the	c
assistent	i
of	c
the	c
responsible	i
person	i
for	c
the	c
clothes	c
and	c
make-up	c
of	c
the	c
pop-group	i
,	i
realy	i
I	c
was	c
very	c
nervous	c
about	c
that	c
because	c
was	i
the	i
first	c
time	c
with	c
so	i
famous	c
people	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
happy	c
that	c
all	c
the	c
things	c
went	c
very	c
well	c
Kim	i
what	i
realy	i
particularly	c
liked	c
was	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
asked	c
to	c
do	c
the	c
make-up	c
on	c
my	c
on	i
realy	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
nervous	c
but	c
at	c
same	i
moment	i
very	c
happy	c
,	c
but	c
every	i
thing	i
when	i
well	c
and	c
everyboby	i
was	c
very	c
hapy	i
with	c
my	c
work	c
.	c

Dear	c
Ms	c
Clark	c
,	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
disappointed	c
that	c
the	c
artists	c
invited	c
were	c
from	c
only	c
six	c
countries	c
.	c

Next	c
year	c
's	c
festival	c
will	c
be	c
much	c
better	c
if	c
artists	c
from	c
places	c
other	c
than	c
Europe	c
and	c
the	c
USA	c
take	c
part	c
in	c
it	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
despite	c
the	c
high	c
quality	c
of	c
the	c
concerts	c
,	c
some	c
of	c
the	c
halls	c
they	c
were	c
given	c
in	c
were	c
too	c
small	c
for	c
the	c
crowd	i
of	i
audition	i
.	c

Thirdly	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
more	c
plays	c
and	c
films	c
should	c
be	c
shown	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
found	c
the	c
idea	c
of	c
a	c
single	c
ticket	c
for	c
all	c
events	i
of	c
the	c
weekend	c
excellent	c
,	c
as	c
the	c
price	c
was	c
reasonable	c
and	c
access	c
to	c
a	c
wide	c
range	c
of	c
events	c
was	c
provided	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
should	c
say	c
that	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
very	c
good	c
time	c
in	c
spite	c
of	c
the	c
flaws	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
wish	c
to	c
enjoy	c
an	c
even	c
better	c
festival	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Dear	c
Mary	c
,	c

Firstly	c
,	c
the	c
weirdest	c
rule	c
in	c
our	c
schools	c
is	c
that	c
we	c
must	c
wear	c
uniforms	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
.	c

This	c
is	c
especially	c
bad	c
for	c
us	c
girls	c
,	c
as	c
we	c
are	c
obliged	c
to	c
wear	c
skirts	c
and	c
we	c
cannot	c
climb	c
the	c
stairs	c
or	c
run	c
like	c
the	c
boys	c
.	c

But	c
apart	c
from	c
this	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
most	c
rules	c
of	c
the	c
school	c
are	c
quite	c
reasonable	c
,	c
like	c
addressing	c
to	i
the	c
teacher	c
using	c
the	c
second	c
plural	i
person	i
(	c
it	c
is	c
different	c
in	c
Turkish	c
)	c
or	c
standing	c
up	c
when	c
s/he	c
enters	c
the	c
class	c
.	c

We	c
stay	c
in	c
the	c
class	c
in	c
which	c
we	c
have	c
been	c
registered	c
for	c
the	c
whole	c
year	c
,	c
and	c
a	c
different	c
teacher	c
comes	c
in	c
every	c
period	c
.	c

Let	c
me	c
talk	c
about	c
the	c
rules	c
at	c
home	c
.	c

We	c
like	c
chatting	c
on	c
the	c
phone	c
so	c
much	c
that	c
most	c
of	c
us	i
'	i
parents	c
have	c
limited	c
the	c
talking	c
time	c
down	i
to	c
five	c
minutes	c
,	c
threatening	c
to	c
cut	c
off	c
the	c
wires	i
otherwise	c
.	c

But	c
we	c
are	c
legally	c
allowed	c
to	c
play	c
instruments	c
like	c
the	c
piano	c
until	c
10	c
p.m	c
.	c

Anyway	c
,	c
I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
your	c
comments	c
about	c
our	c
rules	c
.	c

Take	c
care	c
!	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
,	c

I	c
can	c
tell	c
you	c
that	c
we	c
are	c
all	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
going	c
there	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
asked	c
by	c
the	c
class	c
to	c
propose	i
you	i
another	i
visit	i
.	c

This	c
show	c
is	c
about	c
the	c
latest	c
fashions	c
,	c
the	i
leisure	c
and	c
sports	c
wear	c
,	c
the	i
make-up	c
and	c
the	i
hairstyles	c
.	c

Everybody	c
in	c
the	c
class	c
is	c
interested	c
in	c
this	c
show	c
,	c
and	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
for	c
us	c
to	c
see	c
it	c
,	c
especially	c
because	c
many	c
of	c
us	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
work	c
later	c
in	c
the	c
fashion	c
.	i

Moreover	c
,	c
this	c
show	c
wo	c
n't	c
cost	c
anything	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
free	c
for	c
the	i
students	c
!	c

What	c
do	c
you	c
think	c
about	c
that	c
?	c

Hoping	c
to	c
hear	c
from	i
your	c
decision	c
soon	c

"	c
Famous	c
people	c
,	c
such	c
as	c
politicians	c
and	c
film	c

deserve	c
to	c

a	c
private	c

"	c

On	c
one	i
hand	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
true	c
because	c
famous	c
people	c
have	c
to	c
do	c
their	c
jobs	c
,	c
that	c
means	c
being	c
interviewed	c
,	c
giving	c
news	c
to	c
the	c

and	c
soon	i

Moreover	c
,	c
especially	c
for	i
film	c

,	c
lots	c
of	c
people	c
are	c
hoping	c
to	c
see	c
them	c
on	c
the	c
Tv	i
or	c
in	c
the	c
newspapers	c
,	c
and	c
this	c
is	c
really	c
good	c
for	c
their	c
fame	i

However	c
,	c
on	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
it	c
must	c
be	c
so	c
annoying	c
to	c
be	c
followed	c
by	c
journalists	c
or	c
photographs	i
all	c
the	c
time	c
.	c

You	c
ca	c
n't	c
go	c
outside	c
quietly	i
,	c
and	c
there	c
is	c
all	i
the	i
time	i
a	c
crownd	i
of	c
people	c
who	c
stands	i
in	c

of	c
your	c
house	c
waiting	c
for	c
you	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
that	c
my	c

in	c
going	c

the	c

takes	c
place	c
in	i
central	i
exhibition	i

in	c
London	c
in	i
14th	c
March	c
.	c

We	c
have	c
seen	c
it	c
in	c
the	i
advertisment	i
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c

I	c
should	i
be	c
more	i

if	c
you	c
could	c
change	c
the	c
programme	c
so	c
as	c
to	i
go	c
to	c
the	c

For	c
example	c
we	i
shall	i
be	c
able	c
to	c
putoff	i
our	c
visit	c
at	i
the	c
science	c

starts	c
at	c
10	c

finishes	c
at	c
19	i

I	c
look	c

I	c
thin	i
that	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
Musical	c
Show	i
'	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
'	c
permormed	i
on	i
the	c
Circle	c
theatre	c
last	c
week	c
.	c

The	c
new	c
actor	c
was	c
not	c
as	c
good	c
as	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
and	c
he	c
did	c
not	c
perform	c
the	i
show	c
as	c
he	c
should	c
have	c
done	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
found	c
that	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
there	c
had	c
been	c
problems	c
with	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
ovens	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
afraid	c
something	c
should	c
be	c
done	c
about	c
this	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
urge	c
you	c
to	c
refund	c
my	c
ticket	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
receiving	c
your	c
response	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

It	c
is	c
often	c
said	c
that	c
technology	c
has	c
changed	c
our	c
lives	c
in	c
many	c
ways	c
,	c
and	c
that	c
we	c
live	c
better	c
now	c
.	c

Technology	c
brings	i
me	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
new	c
possibilities	c
every	c
day	c
,	c
and	c
it	c
also	c
makes	c
everything	c
easier	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
negative	c
aspects	c
in	i
the	c
way	c
that	c
technology	c
affects	c
my	c
life	c
.	c

As	c
technology	c
develops	c
so	c
fast	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
always	c
new	c
things	c
to	c
buy	c
,	c
and	c
it	c
also	c
reduces	c
the	c
amount	c
of	c
jobs	c
available	c
,	c
so	c
it	c
is	c
getting	c
hard	c
to	c
find	c
a	c
job	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
,	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
my	c
horrible	c
evening	c

The	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c

10th	c
June	c
2000	c
.	c

Last	c
week	c
I	c
was	c
on	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
and	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
for	c
entertaining	i
but	c
I	c
wish	c
I	c
'd	c
not	c
go	i
there	c
because	c
everythings	i
went	c
wrong	c
.	c

I	c
bought	c
a	c
ticket	c
at	c
the	c
box	c
office	c
but	c
there	c
were	c
not	c
any	c
discounts	c
for	c
student	i
like	c
you	c
said	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
show	c
and	c
also	c
the	c
show	c
had	i
to	c
start	c
at	c
19.30	c
but	c
on	c
that	c
day	c
it	c
delaied	i
about	c
45	c
minutes	c
.	c

During	c
the	c
show	c
I	c
was	i
expected	i
to	c
meet	i
Danny	c
Brook	c
who	i
is	c
my	c
favourite	c
actor	c
and	i
Tina	c
Truelove	c
.	c

After	c
finishing	i
the	i
show	i
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
visit	c
your	c
restaurant	c
and	c
I	c
found	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

Finally	c
I	i
would	c
like	c
to	c
have	c
refund	i
for	c
my	c
ticket	c
back	i
because	c
it	c
was	c
horrible	i
evening	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c

Paya	c
Chuaswee	c
(	c
Miss	c
)	c

We	c
started	c
our	c
journey	c
and	c
we	c
arrived	c
at	c
our	c
purpose	i
place	i
by	c
6	c
o'clock	c
in	c
the	c

She	c

had	c
phoned	c
her	c
while	c
we	c
were	c

my	c
mum	c
followed	c
us	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
so	c
dangerous	c
to	c
went	i
by	c

.	c

From	c
now	c
on	c
I	i
do	c
n't	c
want	c
to	c
tell	i
something	i
secrets	i
to	i
Pat	i
because	c
she	c

but	c
she	c

I	c

you	c
that	c
I	c
will	c
be	c

the	c
First	c

Furthermore	c

in	c

University	i

In	c
addition	c
,	c
I	c

Surfing	c

Sailing	c

Camp	i

Please	c

know	c
if	c
you	c
need	c
more	c
information	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

As	c
requested	c
,	c
I	c
visited	c
some	c
classes	c
during	c
the	i
lesson	i
and	c
some	c
other	c
rooms	c
while	c
activities	c
were	c
taking	c
place	c
.	c

The	c
aim	c
of	c
this	c
report	c
is	c
make	i
a	c
series	c
of	c
suggestions	c
on	c
which	c
lessons	c
and	c
other	c
activities	c
should	c
be	c
filmed	c
.	c

It	i
's	i
seems	c
to	c
me	c
that	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
an	c
extremely	c
good	c
advertisement	c
for	c
our	c
school	c
if	c
you	c
take	i
plans	i
from	i
the	c
lesson	i
of	i
Chemistry	i
in	c
the	c
laboratory	c
,	c
because	c
our	c
laboratory	c
is	c
new	c
,	c
recognised	c
as	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
best	c
in	c
the	c
area	c
as	c
it	c
has	c
a	c
huge	c
amount	c
of	c
instruments	i
and	c
really	c
some	c
very	c
good	c
professors	i
,	c
and	c
also	c
many	c
experiments	c
are	c
taking	c
place	c
in	c
this	c
laboratory	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
a	c
good	c
idea	c
to	c
take	i
plans	i
from	i
a	i
match	i
of	i
our	i
school	i
team	i
in	i
the	c
football	c
field	i
as	c
it	c
is	c
completely	c
new	c
and	c
full	i
equiped	i
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Helen	c
,	c

I	c
cannot	c
believe	c
I	c
'm	c
the	c
winner	c
of	c
your	c
competition	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
really	c
very	c
happy	c
.	c

As	c
far	c
as	c
accomodtion	i
is	c
concerned	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
live	c
in	c
tents	i
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
.	c

I	c
prefer	c
this	c
type	c
of	c
accomodation	i
because	c
I	c
am	c
used	c
to	c
living	c
in	c
tents	c
during	c
my	c
summer	c
holidays	c
.	c

As	c
I	c
am	c
an	c
athletic	c
swimmer	c
and	c
a	c
good	c
surfer	c
too	c
,	c
my	c
choice	c
from	c
your	c
attached	c
list	c
is	c
naturally	c
swimming	c
and	c
surfing	c
.	c

Hi	c
Kim	c
!	c

It	c
's	c
great	c
to	c
hearing	i
from	c
you	c
!	c

The	c
singer	c
was	c
fabulous	c
and	c
the	c
musicians	c
played	c
fantastic	c
songs	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
employed	c
in	c
the	i
security	i
service	i
.	c

It	c
was	c
the	c
first	c
time	c
for	c
me	c
and	c
I	c
consider	c
this	c
experience	c
the	c
best	c
of	c
my	c
life	c
.	c

At	c
the	c
same	c
time	c
I	c
could	c
enjoy	c
the	c
music	c
!	c

You	c
should	c
be	c
pride	i
of	c
you	i
helping	i
people	c
who	c
suffers	i
,	c
and	c
at	c
the	c
same	c
time	c
you	c
may	i
enjoy	c
yourself	c
!	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
seeing	c
you	c
!	c

Dear	c
Madam	c
,	c

First	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
offering	c
me	c
this	c
wonderful	c
prize	c
.	c

There	c
is	c
no	i
much	i
time	i
left	c
in	c
my	c
timetable	c
in	c
August	c
since	c
I	c
will	c
have	c
to	c
work	c
then	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
would	c
rather	c
come	c
in	c
July	c
.	c

Concerning	c
the	c
accomodation	i
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
sleep	c
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
,	c
because	c
to	c
sleep	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
would	c
remind	c
me	c
of	c
the	c
bad	c
experience	c
I	c
had	c
in	c
Ireland	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
weather	c
...	c

Since	c
this	c
stay	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
is	c
a	c
good	c
occasion	i
to	c
discover	i
new	c
activities	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
sail	c
and	c
climb	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
beginner	c
in	i
both	c
activities	c
.	c

Then	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c

I	c
will	c
need	c
there	c
,	c
and	c
if	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
bring	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
money	c

Yours	c

Richard	c
Amelin	c

I	c
apologize	c
for	c
not	c
having	c
written	c
this	c
letter	c
sooner	c
,	c
but	c
as	c
you	c
probably	c
now	i
,	c
I	c
was	c
actually	c
really	c
busy	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
pop	c
concert	c
.	c

What	c
a	c
great	c
experience	c
that	c
was	c
!	c

I	c
will	c
remember	c
it	c
for	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
because	c
of	c
two	c
reasons	c
.	c

When	c
they	c
are	c
on	c
stage	c
,	c
during	c
the	c
repetitions	i
,	c
they	c
are	c
able	c
to	c
play	c
a	c
music	c
that	c
completely	c
moves	c
me	c
.	c

In	c
a	c
few	c
months	c
,	c
when	c
they	c
are	c
famous	c
,	c
I	c
could	c
say	c
:	c
"	c
You	c
know	c
.	i

I	c
already	c
know	c
them	c
,	i
I	c
have	c
even	c
helped	c
them	c
at	c
one	c
of	c
their	c
concert.	i
"	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
concerning	c
your	c
letter	c
about	c
my	c
win	i
in	i
your	i
competition	i
for	i
two	i
weeks	i
at	i
Camp	i
California	i
.	c

The	c
only	c
month	c
I	c
could	c
go	c
to	i
holidays	i
is	c
July	c
,	c
when	c
we	c
have	c
n't	c
got	c
a	c
lot	c
to	c
do	c
.	c

I	c
like	c
a	c
lot	c
from	i
your	c
list	c
for	i
the	i
sport	i
possibilities	c
,	i
however	i
I	i
will	c
choose	c
swimming	c
.	c

But	c
until	i
now	i
I	c
only	i
took	i
pictures	c
on	c
holidays	i
and	c
some	i
family	c
celabrations	i
.	c

Lastly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
if	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
money	c
with	c
me	c
,	c
for	i
example	i
for	i
the	i
food	i
.	c

And	c
also	c
if	c
the	c
weather	c
will	c
be	c
good	c
at	c
this	c
time	c
.	i

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
begin	c
this	c
composition	c
by	c
saying	c
that	c
,	i
not	i
for	i
everyone	i
is	i
shopping	i
the	i
same	i
.	c

For	c
some	c
people	c
it	c
's	c
great	c
fun	c
,	c
but	c
for	c
some	c
other	i
it	c
's	c
a	c
"	c
must	i
"	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
shopping	c
is	c
like	c
relaxing	c
.	c

I	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
very	c
often	c
,	c
to	c
look	c
around	c
and	c
to	c
buy	c
some	c
new	c
clothes	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
must	c
buy	c
something	c
,	c
I	c
usually	c
ca	c
n't	c
find	c
it	c
and	c
then	c
the	i
shopping	c
become	i
a	c
nightmare	c
.	c

Then	c
it	c
is	c
perhaps	c
better	c
,	i
when	c
you	c
make	c
an	c
appointment	c
in	c
one	c
hour	c
and	c
everybody	c
enjoys	i
the	i
shopping	c
alone	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
,	c

All	c
my	c
class	i
mates	i
are	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
go	i
to	c
London	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
so	c
much	c
for	c
organising	c
such	c
a	c
great	c
program	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
you	i
about	c
changing	c
our	c
plan	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
14	c
March	c
.	c

The	c
students	c
in	c
my	c
class	c
have	c
seen	c
an	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
and	c
we	c
would	c
all	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

The	c
advertisement	c
saids	i
it	c
is	c
taking	c
place	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
14	c
March	c
from	c
10am	c
to	c
7pm	c
.	c

Sincerely	c
,	c

It	c
was	c
dangerous	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
knew	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
.	c

Otherwise	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
keep	c
walking	c
untill	i
the	c
train	c
start	i
.	c

Have	c
you	c
stayed	c
at	i
a	c
park	c
during	c
the	c
night	c
?	c

When	c
I	c
did	c
that	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
traveling	i
around	c
Japan	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
the	c
very	c
last	c
day	c
of	c
my	c
trip	c
and	c
at	c
that	c
time	c
I	c
was	c
in	c
Kyoto	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
windy	c
spring	c
day	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
sitting	c
under	c
a	c
full-bloomed	c
cherry	c
blossam	i
tree	c
.	c

Inside	c
the	c
dark	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
alone	c
and	c
only	c
the	c
moon	i
light	i
helped	c
me	c
to	c
see	c
the	i
things	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
regretting	c
I	i
risked	i
staying	c
at	i
the	c
park	c
alone	c
.	c

Suddenly	c
,	c
strong	i
wind	c
blew	c
up	c
the	i
thousands	c
and	c
thousands	c
pieces	i
of	i
flowers	i
.	c

Sometimes	c
when	c
we	c
risk	c
a	c
great	c
danger	c
,	c
it	c
turns	c
into	c
a	c
great	c
experience	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
give	c
my	c
opinion	c
about	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
called	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
.	c

To	c
tell	c
the	c
truth	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
very	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
advertisement	c
,	c
it	c
was	i
written	i
that	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
London	c
's	c
newest	c
and	c
best	c
musical	c
show	c
.	c

The	c
actor	c
was	c
somebody	c
else	c
and	c
this	c
was	c
something	i
disappointing	c
.	c

The	c
show	c
should	c
have	c
started	c
at	c
19:30	c
but	c
,	i
it	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
.	c

And	c
also	c
,	c
it	c
was	i
written	i
that	c
the	i
discounts	c
were	c
available	c
but	c
they	c
were	c
not	c
.	c

After	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
visit	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
the	c
next	c
musical	c
show	c
would	i
be	i
a	c
better	c
one	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	i
,	c

MODERN	c
TECHNOLOGY	c

People	c
had	c
completely	c
different	c
life-styles	i
.	c

People	c
were	i
using	i
candles	c
to	c
see	c
around	c
them	c
.	c

In	c
winter	c
,	c
they	c
used	c
to	c
fire	i
some	c
woods	i
to	c
keep	c
warm	c
,	i
"	c
Computer	c
"	c
was	c
a	c
word	c
that	c
nobody	c
had	i
known	i
the	c
meaning	c
of	c
it	i
.	c

As	c
my	c
mum	c
told	c
me	c
,	c
when	c
she	c
was	c
young	c
,	c
only	c
a	c
few	c
people	c
had	c
televisions	c
in	c
their	c
houses	c
.	c

And	c
of	c
course	c
,	c
they	c
were	c
black-and	i
white	c
.	c

Their	c
hobies	i
were	c
listening	c
to	c
the	c
radio	c
,	c
reading	c
books	c
or	c
sitting	c
on	c
a	c
chair	c
without	c
doing	c
anything	c
.	c

We	c
are	i
using	i
mobile	c
phones	c
so	c
it	c
does	c
n't	c
matter	c
if	c
we	c
are	c
in	c
a	c
crowded	c
city	c
or	c
on	i
a	c
desert	c
.	c

You	c
can	c
communicate	c
with	c
other	c
people	c
any	c
time	c
you	c
want	c
.	c

We	c
also	c
have	c
"	i
internet	i
"	i
,	c
by	i
which	c
you	c
can	c
learn	c
something	c
about	c
the	c
world	c
in	c
less	c
than	c
a	c
minute	c
.	c

Modern	c
technology	c
is	c
very	c
important	c
for	c
all	c
the	c
countries	c
.	c

It	c
has	c
a	c
very	c
big	c
role	c
in	c
developing	c
a	c
country	c
.	c

When	c
you	c
look	c
around	c
,	c
you	c
can	c
easily	c
understand	c
that	c
modern	c
technology	c
is	c
used	c
in	i
everything	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
,	i
we	c
are	c
all	c
very	c
lucky	c
people	c
that	c
we	c
are	c
n't	c
using	c
candles	c
or	c
black	c
and	c
white	c
televisions	c
anymore	c
?	i

I	c
had	c
a	c
wonderful	c
time	c
at	c
the	c
International	c
Arts	c
Festival	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
this	c
festival	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
idea	c
to	i
enjoy	c
arts	c
from	c
around	c
the	c
world	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
also	c
have	c
some	c
complaints	c
.	c

The	c
performances	c
were	c
great	c
,	c
but	c
some	c
halls	c
were	c
too	c
small	c
to	c
accomodate	i
so	i
many	i
people	c
there	i
were	i
that	c
day	c
.	c

A	c
crowded	c
hall	c
is	c
not	c
good	c
to	i
enjoy	i
musics	i
.	c

I	c
liked	c
plays	i
and	c
films	c
,	c
and	c
want	c
to	c
see	c
more	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

So	c
all	c
you	c
need	c
to	c
improve	c
is	i
to	i
have	i
larger	c
concert	c
halls	c
.	c

I	c
also	c
suggest	c
that	c
you	c
should	c
make	c
it	c
easier	c
to	c
find	c
out	c
where	c
and	c
what	c
is	c
being	i
held	i
using	c
more	c
notice	i
boards	i
.	c

Sincerely	c
Yours	c
,	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
recommend	c
the	c
job	c
,	i
a	i
home	c
teacher	i
.	c

It	c
is	c
very	c
good	c
considering	c
how	c
less	i
time	c
we	c
spend	c
on	c
it	c
.	c

Students	c
who	c
want	c
home	c
teachers	i
are	c
usually	c
primary	c
school	c
,	c
junior	c
high	c
school	c
,	c
or	c
senior	c
high	c
school	c
students	c
,	c
and	c
it	i
means	c
they	c
take	c
lessons	c
after	c
school	c
,	c
not	c
in	c
a	i
daytime	c
.	c

Because	c
teaching	c
requires	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
knowledge	c
.	c

You	c
have	c
to	c
be	c
much	c
smarter	c
than	c
your	c
student	c
,	c
and	c
you	c
also	c
need	c
to	c
prepare	c
for	c
lessons	c
,	c
for	i
it	c
is	c
your	c
responsibility	c
to	c
provide	c
your	c
student	c
right	i
information	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
am	c
enjoying	c
it	c
and	c
getting	c
a	c
lot	c
out	c
of	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
first	c
,	c
in	i
the	i
name	i
of	i
my	c
whole	c
class	c
,	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
all	c
you	c
've	c
done	c
for	c
us	c
and	c
for	c
our	c
trip	c
to	c
London	c
.	c

This	c
will	c
be	c
very	c
enriching	c
for	c
us	c
!	c

This	c
will	c
take	c
place	c
in	c
the	c
Central	c
Exhibition	c
Hall	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
14th	c
March	c
.	c

We	c
thought	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
great	c
experience	c
for	c
us	c
since	c
we	c
quite	i
do	c
n't	c
have	c
such	c
opportunities	c
in	c
our	c
everyday	c
life	c
!	c

Moreover	c
,	c
the	i
entrance	i
is	c
free	c
for	c
the	c
students	c
so	c
that	c
wo	c
n't	c
raise	c
the	c
cost	c
for	i
the	c
trip	c
.	c

I	c
thought	c
we	c
should	c
visit	c
the	c
Science	c
Museum	c
on	c
Monday	c
afternoon	c
so	c
that	c
we	c
could	c
do	c
the	c
River	c
trip	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
morning	c
just	c
before	c
going	c
to	c
the	c
fashion	c
show	c
!	c

Anyway	c
,	c
we	c
were	c
to	i
go	i
shopping	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
afternoon	c
so	c
that	c
wo	c
n't	c
be	c
a	c
problem	c
to	c
my	c
mind	c
!	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
will	c
take	i
account	i
of	i
our	c
request	c
,	c

Yours	c
faithfully	i
,	c

It	c
was	c
dangerous	c
but	c
I	c
knew	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
.	c

George	c
was	c
about	c
to	c
be	c
linched	i
on	c
account	c
of	c
his	c
colour	i
skin	i
.	c

.	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
to	c
react	c
!	c
...	c
otherwise	c
I	c
would	c
have	c
felt	c
responsible	c
for	c
his	c
death	c
,	c
for	c
the	c
rest	c
of	c
my	c
life	c
.	c

George	c
was	c
leaning	i
on	c
the	c
floor	c
,	c
surrounded	c
by	c
his	c
own	c
lake	c
of	c
blood	c
.	c

And	c
yet	i
,	i
he	c
was	c
too	c
weak	c
to	c
resist	c
the	c
rats	c
,	i
coming	c
from	c
everywhere	c
and	c
eating	c
his	c
face	c
,	c
his	c
legs	c
and	c
his	c
arms	c
,	c
waiting	c
with	c
great	c
impatience	c
for	c
his	c
death	c
.	c

He	c
had	c
been	c
chained	c
and	c
no	c
way	c
could	c
he	c
escape	c
from	c
his	c
fate	c
without	c
some	c
help	c
!	c

No	c
one	c
was	c
garding	i
him	c
.	c

They	c
were	c
all	c
celebrating	c
their	c
victory	c
with	c
a	c
gorgeous	c
dinner	c
around	c
the	c
fire	i
place	i
.	c

I	c
tiptoed	c
as	c
far	c
as	c
the	c
house	c
,	c
carefully	c
opened	c
the	c
door	c
,	c
and	c
headed	c
to	c
George	c
.	c

At	c
the	c
very	c
moment	c
when	c
he	c
say	i
me	c
,	c
his	c
eyes	c
began	c
to	c
shine	c
and	c
I	c
could	c
feel	c
that	c
he	c
had	c
recovered	c
some	c
hope	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
in	c
your	c
advertisement	c
states	i
:	c
stars	c
and	c
artist	i
from	c
around	c
the	c
world	c
,	c
and	i
this	c
year	c
one	i
only	c
from	c
six	c
countries	c
It	i
would	c
be	c
great	c
if	c
there	c
was	i
more	c
artist	i
not	i
only	i
six	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
the	c
concerts	c
are	i
fantastic	c
,	c
especially	c
rock	i
concerts	c
.	c

I	c
very	i
enjoy	i
on	i
it	i
,	c
but	c
some	c
of	c
the	c
halls	c
are	c
too	c
small	c
.	c

I	c
saw	c
that	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
people	c
were	c
unsatisfied	c
.	c

The	c
last	c
thing	c
is	c
that	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
surprised	c
when	c
I	c
read	c
that	c
you	c
have	c
weekend-price	i
.	c

Now	c
they	c
can	c
visit	c
it	c
by	i
whole	i
family	c
at	c
the	c
weekend	c
and	c
see	c
all	c
events	c
in	i
reasonaby-price	i

I	c
believe	i
that	c
you	c
consider	c
my	c
opinions	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
ca	c
n't	c
consider	c
all	c
of	c
then	i

I	c
would	c

Dear	c
Annabel	c

And	c
the	c
main	c
rule	c
is	c
that	c
everyone	c
must	c
be	c
nice	c
to	c
teachers	i
At	i
home	c
I	c
must	c
clean	c
my	c
room	c
and	c
vacuuming	i
home	i
.	c

I	c
often	c
go	c
shopping	c
and	c
help	c
my	c
mother	c
clean	c
windows	c
.	c

I	c
like	c
clean	i
my	c
home	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
like	c
when	i
there	i
is	c
clean	c
and	c
fresh	c
.	c

There	c
is	c
one	c
thing	c
I	c
like	i
to	c
change	c
,	c
the	i
treatment	c
students	c
by	i
teachers	c
.	c

They	c
want	c
too	c
much	c
forstudent	i
and	c
are	c
unkindly	i
for	i
them	c

Dear	c

I	c
'm	c
writting	i
to	c
you	c
to	c
answer	c
the	c
letter	c
in	c
which	c
,	c
as	c
you	c
probably	c
know	c
,	c
you	c
congratulated	c
me	c
for	c
having	c
won	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
and	c
tried	c
to	c
encourage	c
me	c
to	c
travel	c
to	c
California	c
and	c
attend	c
that	c
Camp	i
.	c

I	c
'm	c
going	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
all	c
the	c
information	c
you	c
need	c
from	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
only	i
can	i
travel	c
I	i
July	c
,	c
because	c
it	i
is	c
when	c
I	c
stop	c
playing	c
basketball	c
to	c
rest	c
before	c
starting	c
the	c
new	c
season	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
mind	c
staying	c
wherever	c
you	c
want	c
me	c
to	c
.	c

The	c
other	c
activities	c
do	c
n't	c
appeal	c
me	i
much	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
'm	c
quite	c
good	c
at	c
Golf	i
.	c

I	c
like	c
surfing	c
and	c
playing	c
tennis	c
,	c
such	i
as	c
sailing	c
and	c
climbing	c
.	c

Please	c
,	c
do	c
n't	c
make	c
me	c
sing	c
or	c
paint	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
'm	c
not	c
very	c
keen	c
on	c
it	c
.	c

there'are	i
no	c
more	c
questions	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

AT	i
seven	c
o'clock	c
on	c
the	c
dot	c
we	c
went	c
there	c
for	i
starting	i
queueing	c
.	c

We	c
bought	c
the	c
tickets	c
and	c
then	c
we	c
sit	i
down	c
to	c
rest	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
great	c
to	c
help	c
him	c
.	c

Finally	c
he	c
said	c
how	c
thankful	i
he	c
was	c
and	c
alowed	i
us	c
to	c
stay	c
with	c
them	c
till	c
the	c
concert	c
started	c
.	c

That	c

Aladdin	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Ryan	c

I	c
would	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
travel	c
only	c
after	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
my	c
exams	c
which	c
are	c
taking	c
place	c
in	c
June	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
July	c
would	c
suit	c
me	c
best	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
been	c
travelling	c
every	c
summer	c
since	c
I	c
was	c
eighteen	c
years	c
of	c
age	c
and	c
this	c
type	c
of	c
accomodation	i
is	c
part	c
of	c
the	c
ritual	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
enjoy	i
a	i
lot	i
playing	c
tennis	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
sport	c
I	c
love	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
really	c
good	c
in	i
it	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
I	c
would	c
love	c
to	c
follow	i
the	c
photography	c
classes	c
eventhough	i
I	c
have	c
never	c
tried	c
to	c
take	c
a	c
picture	c
before	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
I	c
gave	i
you	c
all	c
the	c
information	c
you	c
needed	c
.	c

From	c
my	c
part	i
,	c
I	c
would	c
just	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
what	c
sort	c
of	c
clothes	c
should	i
I	i
bring	c
with	c
me	c
and	c
also	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

I	c
got	c
your	c
letter	c
yesterday	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
really	c
glad	c
to	c
hear	c
from	c
you	c
...	c
it	c
's	c
been	c
ages	c
since	c
you	c
last	c
wrote	c
to	c
me	c
!	c

I	c
've	c
done	c
so	c
many	c
thinks	i
and	i
between	i
them	i
I	c
went	c
to	c
Glastonbery	c
(	c
as	c
you	c
know	c
)	c
!	c

It	i
lasted	c
three	c
days	c
and	c
I	i
've	i
had	i
the	c
best	c
fun	c
of	c
my	c
life	c
.	c

I	c
went	c
as	c
a	c
voluntier	i
staff	i
in	c
order	c
to	c
go	c
for	c
free	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
to	c
help	c
the	c
Green	c
Peace	c
teems	i
to	c
recycle	c
everything	c
we	c
could	c
.	c

Our	c
duty	c
was	c
to	c
work	c
eight	c
ours	i
each	c
day	c
and	c
then	c
we	c
were	c
free	c
to	c
enjoy	c
the	c
rest	c
of	c
the	c
day	c
as	c
we	c
liked	c
.	c

The	c
accomodation	i
and	c
the	c
food	c
were	c
part	c
of	c
the	c
contract	c
...	c
everything	c
free	c
.	c

They	c
provided	c
us	c
tents	i
and	c
also	c
a	c
VIP	c
pass	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
get	c
food	c
.	c

It	c
has	i
been	i
the	c
best	c
experience	c
you	c
can	c
Imagine	i
.	c

I	c
met	c
lots	c
of	c
nice	c
and	i
cool	c
people	c
,	c
and	c
what	c
I	c
most	c
enjoyed	c
was	c
the	c
crazy	c
atmospher	i
of	c
the	c
hole	i
thing	c
.	c

No	c
matter	c
how	c
hard	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
work	c
,	c
everyone	c
had	i
always	c
humor	i
and	c
a	i
positive	c
mood	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
I	c
'll	c
sign	c
off	c
now	c
and	c
I	c
hope	c
you	c
'll	c
write	c
soon	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
glad	c
to	c
hear	c
that	i
I	i
have	i
won	i
the	i
first	i
prize	i
from	i
you	i
.	c

I	c
appreciate	c
all	c
about	i
this	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
about	c
my	c
information	c
which	c
you	c
need	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
afraid	c
that	c
I	c
am	c
just	i
available	c
to	c
travel	c
only	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
difficult	c
to	c
get	c
my	i
own	i
holiday	c
from	c
my	c
work	c
a	i
the	c
moment	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
if	c
I	c
have	c
any	c
chance	c
to	c
choose	c
activities	c
,	c
I	c
will	c
choose	c
Basket	i
ball	i
and	c
Sailing	c
with	c
no	c
doubt	c
because	c
I	c
would	c
love	c
to	c
make	c
friends	c
from	i
these	c
kinds	c
of	c
sports	c
.	c

Both	c
could	c
be	c
exciting	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
got	c
not	i
idea	c
about	c
them	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
be	c
grateful	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
send	c
me	c
some	c
information	c
of	i
them	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
in	c
the	c
near	c
future	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

What	c
I	c
really	c
want	c
to	c
say	i
is	c
about	c
my	c
recent	c
experience	c
.	c

Last	c
month	c
,	c
I	c
helped	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
by	c
chance	c
.	c

Of	c
course	c
,	c
I	c
could	c
listen	c
to	c
all	c
their	c
music	c
which	i
were	i
so	c
cool	c
.	c

The	c
best	c
thing	c
was	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
learned	c
how	c
to	c
control	i
their	c
expensive	c
instruments	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
sung	c
my	c
favorite	i
songs	c
with	c
them	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
impossible	c
to	c
explain	c
all	c
my	c
experience	c
without	c
this	c
word	c
,	c
"	c
Brilliant	c
!	c
!	c
!	c
"	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
invite	c
you	c
to	c
their	c
next	c
concert	c
and	c
share	c
my	c
experience	c
with	c
you	c
.	c

Please	c
let	c
me	c
know	c
if	i
you	i
want	i
to	i
come	i
as	i
soon	i
as	i
possible	i
.	c

Best	c
wishes	c
,	c

Hello	i
,	c

Firstly	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	i
prize	c
.	c

Secondly	c
I	c
am	c
going	c
to	c
answer	c
your	c
questions	c
.	c

For	i
the	c
activities	c
I	c
would	c
be	c
very	c
happy	c
if	c
I	c
could	c
play	c
golf	c
.	c

So	c
if	c
I	c
have	c
this	c
opportunity	c
,	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
want	c
to	c
fail	i
it	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
photograph	i
too	i
.	c

Hello	c
Kim	c
,	c

It	c
was	c
marvellous	c
!	c
!	c
!	c

I	c
was	c
in	i
the	i
backstage	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
could	c
speak	c
with	c
the	c
singer	c
before	c
the	c
concert	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
to	c
serve	c
glasses	c
of	c
water	c
to	c
the	c
group	c
before	c
and	c
during	c
the	c
concert	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
contact	c
with	c
them	c
.	c

What	c
I	c
particularly	c
liked	c
about	c
this	c
experience	c
is	c
that	c
I	c
saw	c
that	c
famous	c
people	c
are	c
like	c
us	c
and	c
have	c
the	c
same	c
interest	i
.	c

Perhaps	c
in	i
the	c
next	c
concert	c
we	c
will	c
go	c
together	c
.	c

I	c
will	c
give	i
you	i
news	i
about	c
it	c
.	c

I	i
send	i
you	c
with	c
my	c
letter	c
a	c
photo	c
of	c
the	c
singer	c
,	i
what	i
he	c
give	i
me	c
.	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
letter	i
which	i
I	c
received	c
last	c
week	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
delighted	c
to	c
heard	i
that	c
I	c
won	c
the	c
prize	c
for	i
two	c
week	i
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
in	c
the	c
U.S.A	c
.	c

I	c
needed	c

-	i
week	c
to	c
prepare	c
all	i
I	c
needed	i
to	c
take	c
with	c
me	c
,	i
It	i
said	i
that	i
about	i
accommodation	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
tents	c
to	i
log	c
cabins	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
more	c
information	c
about	c
clothes	c
and	c
money	c
.	c

It	i
would	c
be	c
very	c
grateful	c
for	i
you	c

as	c

as	c
possible	c
.	c

I	c
looking	i
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Dear	c
,	i
Kim	c
,	c

How	c
are	c
you	c
?	c

I	c
have	c
n't	c
heard	c
from	c
you	c
for	c
such	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
everything	c
is	c
alright	c
with	c
you	c
.	c

Sorry	c
!	c

I	c
have	c
n't	c
written	c
to	c
you	c
since	i
last	i
two	c
months	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
very	c
busy	c
to	i
helped	i
and	c
organizing	c
the	c
pop	c
concert	c
which	c
took	c
place	c
near	c
my	c
town	c
.	c

My	c
duty	c
was	c
helped	i
them	c
cooking	i
for	c
all	c
of	c
them	c
during	c
the	c
concert	c
,	i
as	i
you	c
know	c
I	c
'm	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
cook	i
and	c
everybody	c
loved	c
my	i
good	i
I	i
cooked	i
!	c

I	c
'll	c
show	c
you	c
when	c
you	c
come	c
around	c
to	c
see	c
me	c
.	c

Anyway	c
,	c
I	c
'd	c
better	c
go	c
now	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
some	c
homework	c
that	c
needs	c
to	c
be	c
done	c
.	c

Give	c
my	c
regards	c
to	c
our	c
parents	c
.	c

Take	c
care	c
!	c

I	c
saw	c
your	c
advertisement	c
yesterday	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
I	c
am	c
not	c
satisfied	c
of	i
it	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
there	c
were	c
any	i
different	c
actor	i
.	c

I	c
was	c
disappointed	c
.	c

The	c
other	c
point	c
is	c
that	c
the	c
organization	c
was	c
very	c
bad	c
.	c

Now	c
I	c
have	c
a	c
cold	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
so	c
cold	c
evening	i
.	c

Thirdly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
enquire	c
is	i
about	c
the	c
tickets	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
twenty	c
pounds	c
are	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
money	c
for	c
such	c
a	c
organization	i
,	i
on	i
the	i
other	i
hand	i
it	c
is	i
said	c
that	c
discount	i
is	i
available	c
.	c

It	c
is	i
false	i
,	i
I	c
have	i
paid	i
twenty	c
pounds	c
.	c

What	i
other	i
I	c
would	c
like	c
ask	i
is	c
that	i
why	c
it	c
is	c
said	c
this	c
is	c
the	i
London	c
's	c
newest	c
and	c
best	c
musical	c
show	c
.	c

I	c
can	c
mention	i
it	c
is	c
the	c
worst	c
musical	c
show	c
.	c

And	c
I	c
was	c
invited	c
to	c
visit	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

But	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
there	c
were	i
not	c
anything	c
to	c
drink	c
or	c
to	c
eat	c
.	c

Finally	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
the	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
I	c
really	c
did	c
not	c
like	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
want	c
to	c
ask	c
if	c
it	c
is	c
possible	c
to	c
give	c
me	c
money	i
back	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

At	c
the	i
present	c
,	c
the	i
technology	c
develops	c
rapidly	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
World	i
can	i
not	i
do	c
without	c
it	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
very	c
useful	c
.	c

Almost	c
everything	c
is	c
connected	i
to	i
the	i
computers	c
.	c

Another	c
thing	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
say	c
is	c
that	c
modern	c
technology	c
help	i
us	c
to	c
go	i
anywhere	c
rapidly	i
.	c

What	i
other	c
I	i
would	c
like	c
to	c
mention	c
how	i
important	c
the	i
modern	c
technology	c
is	c
.	i

We	c
research	i
our	c
plant	i
,	c
other	c
planets	c
and	c
many	c
other	c
things	c
with	c
the	i
help	i
of	i
it	i
.	c

Finally	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
at	c
the	i
present	c
the	i
life	c
is	c

Dear	i
Sir	i
and	i
Madam	i

I	c
am	c
writing	c
this	c
letter	c
to	c
want	i
you	c
to	i
know	i
that	i
what	c
I	c
think	c
about	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
which	c
you	c
(	c
The	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
)	c
present	i
.	c

I	c
bought	c
group	i
ticket	c
for	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

Because	c
we	i
were	i
7	i
people	i
.	c

When	c
I	c
asked	c
something	i
about	i
"	i
discount	i
"	i
,	i
your	i
staf	i
said	i
that	i
it	i
is	i
impossible	i
.	c

I	c
ignored	i
it	c
.	c

Becouse	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
see	c
this	c
show	c
.	c

Becouse	c
my	c
favorite	i
actor	c
plays	i
in	c
it	c
.	c

We	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
bulding	i
at	c
18:30	c
.	c

We	c
waited	i
to	i
start	i
the	i
show	i
about	i
one	c
hour	c
and	c
fourty-five	i
minutes	c
.	c

We	c
were	c
bored	c
and	c
we	c
wished	i
that	c
this	c
is	i
last	i
mistake	i

During	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
we	c
could	i
n't	i
see	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
who	i
is	c
my	c
favorite	i
actor	c
.	c

An	i
other	i
one	c
played	i
in	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

We	c
were	c
really	c
angry	c
.	c

If	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
does	c
not	c
play	i
,	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
say	c
something	c
about	c
this	c
to	c
people	i
who	c
there	i
are	i
in	c
the	c
theater	i
This	i
is	c
your	c
unforgiven	i
mistake	c
.	c

We	c
were	c
bored	c
to	i
waiting	c
.	c

We	c
were	c
hungry	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

They	i
are	c
your	c
mistakes	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
that	c
you	c
can	c
understand	c
me	i
and	c
you	c
will	c
do	c
something	c
about	c
mistakes	i
.	c

When	c
you	c
do	c
something	c
,	c
I	c
went	i
to	c
see	c
your	c
new	c
shows	c
.	c

Thanks	c
for	c
reading	c
this	c
letter	c

When	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
school	c
,	c
I	c
wrote	c
a	c
letter	c
to	c
my	c
friends	c
.	c

Becouse	c
I	c
had	i
n't	i
got	i
a	c
mobile-phone	i

It	c
's	c
fast	c
and	c
easy	c
.	c

I	c
miss	c
to	i
wait	i
the	i
postman	c
every	c
morning	c

I	c
did	c
n't	c
want	c
to	c
play	c
outside	i
games	i
with	c
my	c
friends	c
.	c

Becouse	c
the	c
computer	c
was	c
more	c
interesting	c
than	c
my	c
friends	c
.	c

I	c
use	c
internet	i
now	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
buy	c
newspaper	i

Becouse	c
I	c
can	c
read	c
my	c

I	c
can	c

My	c
daily	c
life	c
is	c
changing	c
.	c

I	c
never	c
forget	c
important	c
days	c
.	c

Life	c
is	c
really	c
easy	c
.	c

You	c
need	c
to	c
learn	c
how	c
you	c
can	c
use	c
the	i
technology	c
.	c

But	c
,	c
sometimes	c
I	i
miss	c
past	i
days	c

I	c

BRASILIA	c
(	c
DF	c
)	c
,	c
JUNE	c
17th	c
2000	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
according	c
to	c
the	c
advertisement	c
,	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
main	c
actors	c
would	c
be	c
DANNY	c
BROOK	c
who	i
I	c
love	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
one	c
hour	c
late	c
and	c
I	c
hate	c
waiting	c
in	c
a	c
queue	c
more	i
than	c
it	i
's	i
necessary	c
.	c

I	c
felt	c
very	c
upset	c
and	c
my	c
enjoyable	c
night	c
became	c
a	c
stressed	i
and	i
very	c
expensive	c
one	c
,	c
too	c
.	c

Modern	c
technology	c
can	c
affect	c
our	c
daily	c
life	c
transforming	c
our	c
relationship	c
and	i
the	c
ways	c
to	i
comunicate	i
to	i
other	c
people	c
as	c
well	c
as	c
our	c
life	c
expectancy	c
.	c

With	c
the	c
introduction	c
of	c
the	c
computer	c
in	c
our	c
civilization	c
we	c
can	c
access	c
Internet	i
to	c
comunicate	i
with	c
our	c
relatives	c
and	c
friends	c
living	c
abroad	c
or	c
far	c
from	c
ourselves	i
.	c

Despite	c
of	i
the	c
distances	c
,	c
we	c
can	c
keep	c
our	c
friendship	c
closely	i
and	c
with	i
a	c
cheaply	i
way	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
we	c
can	c
feel	c
more	c
comfortable	c
with	c
them	c
providing	c
us	c
support	i
to	i
our	c
hard	c
tasks	c
and	c
letting	i
us	c
free	c
to	c
apply	c
our	c
attention	i
and	c
efforts	c
to	c
more	c
important	c
things	c
.	c

For	c
instance	c
,	c
we	c
can	c
research	c
new	c
manners	i
of	c
improving	c
our	c
quality	c
of	c
life	c
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
we	c
are	c
able	c
to	c
feel	c
or	c
to	c
recognize	c
the	c
benefits	c
of	c
the	c
modern	c
technologies	c
but	c
we	c
should	c
be	c
aware	c
about	i
how	c
they	c
are	c
introduced	c
in	i
our	c
lives	c
to	c
avoid	c
the	c
dangerous	c
side	c
of	c
the	i
TECHNOLOGY	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
,	i
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
"	c
OVER	c
THE	c
RAINBOW	c
"	c
,	i
that	c
I	c
came	c
to	c
see	c
during	i
my	i
holiday	i
in	i
London	i
,	i
at	i
your	i
theatre	i
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
in	i
your	c
advertisment	i
for	c
the	c
show	c
you	c
wrote	c
that	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
were	c
taking	c
part	c
at	i
the	c
show	c
.	c

And	c
I	c
was	c
so	c
excited	c
about	c
it	c
!	c

But	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
disappointed	c
when	c
I	c
realised	c
that	c
another	c
actor	c
was	c
taking	c
part	i
.	c

The	c
people	c
who	c
were	c
there	c
to	c
watch	c
the	c
show	c
were	c
very	c
ungry	i
and	c
they	c
were	c
shouting	c
because	c
they	c
were	i
waiting	i
for	i
too	c
long	c
,	i
And	c
I	c
absolutely	c
agree	i
with	c
them	c
.	c

But	c
when	c
I	c
went	c
there	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
why	c
and	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
you	c
to	c
tell	c
me	c
,	i
the	c
reason	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
you	c
said	c
that	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
our	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
.	c

I	c
'd	c
like	c
you	c
to	c
return	c
them	i
to	c
me	c
.	c

I	i
'll	i
wait	i
to	c
hear	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
...	i

So	c
,	c
the	c
next	c
day	c
Pat	c
went	c
and	c
told	c
to	i
his	c
sister	c
Sally	c
that	c
her	c
friends	c
were	c
organising	c
a	c
suprise	i
party	c
for	c
her	c
birthday	c
.	c

When	c
Sally	c
heared	i
that	c
,	c
was	i
very	c
suprised	i
and	c
very	c
excited	c
.	c

But	c
because	c
she	c
did	c
n't	c
want	c
to	c
disappoint	c
her	c
friends	c
,	c
she	c
was	c
acting	c
as	c
she	i
did	c
n't	c
know	c
anything	c
.	c

But	c
although	c
she	c
was	c
acting	c
like	c
this	c
she	c
was	c
very	c
ungry	i
with	c
her	c
brother	c
Pat	c
,	c
because	c
he	c
did	c
n't	c
keep	c
the	c
secret	c
.	c

The	c
party	c
was	c
on	c
Saturday	c
at	c
Sally	c
's	c
house	c
.	c

After	c
a	c
while	c
the	i
bell	c
rang	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
Sally	c
!	c

Suddenly	c
they	c
all	c
shouted	c
"	c
suprise	i
!	c
"	c
.	c

They	c
danced	c
a	c
lot	c
and	c
they	c
had	c
pizza	c
for	c
dinner	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
an	c
unforgetable	i
night	c
!	c
!	c
!	c

It	c
was	c
n't	c
at	c
all	c
like	c
what	c
the	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
show	c
had	c
promised	c
.	c

To	c
start	c
with	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
which	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
start	c
on	c
19:30	c
started	c
on	c
20:15	c
so	c
you	c
can	c
understand	c
that	c
we	c
were	c
45	c
minutes	c
late	c
getting	c
out	c
as	c
well	c
.	c

Then	c
,	c
they	i
were	c
not	c
any	c
discounts	c
available	c
for	c
the	c
tickets	c
as	c
it	i
was	c
written	c
on	c
the	c
advertisement	c
.	c

On	c
top	c
of	c
everything	c
Danny	i
Brook	c
,	c
the	c
star	c
of	c
the	c
night	c
,	c
was	c
absent	c
and	c
his	c
role	c
was	c
performed	c
by	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
.	c

You	c
can	c
understand	c
how	c
disappointing	c
this	c
was	c
for	c
all	c
of	c
us	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
sorry	c
but	c
this	c
was	c
n't	c
my	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
for	c
some	i
refund	c
because	c
the	c
whole	c
evening	c
was	c
very	c
disappointing	c
and	c
it	c
did	i
not	c
worth	c
the	c
money	c
given	i

Yours	c
faithfully	c

As	c
we	c
can	c
understand	c
by	c
observing	c
the	c
fashion	c
of	c
each	c
century	c
,	c
the	c
style	c
of	c
dressing	c
changes	c
rootly	i
through	i
the	c
years	c
.	c

So	c
we	c
can	c
easily	c
understand	c
how	c
different	c
the	c
style	c
of	c
dressing	c
will	c
be	c
like	i
100	c
years	c
from	c
now	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
two	c
possible	c
fashions	c
for	c
the	c
future	c
.	c

If	c
humans	c
turn	i
to	c
be	c
more	c
free	c
from	c
social	c
rules	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
their	c
dressing	i
will	c
also	c
be	c
very	c
extreme	c
and	c
unlimited	c
.	c

Everybody	c
will	c
wear	c
anything	c
he/she	c
likes	c
,	c
choosing	c
clothes	c
from	c
any	c
century	c
they	c
wishe	i
without	c
this	c
being	c
strange	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
if	c
human	c
society	c
turns	i
to	c
be	i
stricher	i
and	c
more	c
limited	c
,	c
there	c
will	c
be	c
only	c
2	c
or	c
3	c
types	c
of	c
clothing	c
,	c
formed	c
by	c
the	c
needs	c
of	c
the	i
society	c
.	c

All	c
people	c
will	c
look	c
about	c
the	c
same	c
and	c
mostly	c
dark	c
colours	c
will	c
rule	c
around	i
.	c

Perhaps	c
the	c
style	c
of	c
their	c
dressing	i
will	c
indicate	c
their	c
position	c
in	c
society	c
too	c
.	c

This	c
is	c
how	i
I	c
think	c
fashion	i
of	c
the	c
future	c
will	c
be	c
like	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

A	c
few	c
weeks	c
ago	c
,	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
London	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
and	c
see	c
a	c
musical	c
show	i
,	c
called	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow.	c
"	c

Then	c
when	c
the	c
show	c
finally	c
started	c
I	c
got	i
very	c
disappointed	c
because	c
,	i
I	c
really	c
wanted	c
to	c
see	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
but	c
instead	c
of	c
him	c
there	c
was	c
any	i
other	i
actor	c
.	c

Lately	i
when	c
the	c
show	c
finished	c
,	c
I	c
planed	i
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
restorant	i
and	c
get	c
some	c
food	c
,	c
but	c
I	i
was	c
close	i
,	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
being	c
repaired	c
.	c

I	c
will	i
be	c
very	c
thankfull	i
if	c
your	c
could	c
return	c
me	i
half	c
or	c
some	c
of	c
my	c
money	c
,	c
or	c
even	c
to	i
make	i
the	c
corresponding	i
discount	i
.	c

Your	i
faithfully	c

But	c
this	c
time	c
it	c
was	c
something	c
more	c
important	c
that	i
any	c
other	c
time	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
in	c
love	c
with	c
a	c
friend	c
's	c
boyfriend	c
and	c
we	c
were	c
about	c
to	c
have	c
an	c
affair	c
,	c
but	c
when	c
I	c
made	c
the	c
big	c
mistake	c
of	c
telling	c
me	i
little	c
and	c
terrible	c
secret	c
to	c
Pat	c
,	c
everithing	i
started	c
going	c
wrong	c
,	i
Katrin	c
my	i
friend	c
,	c
and	c
the	c
one	c
I	c
was	c
being	c
bad	c
with	i
,	c
was	c
very	c
upset	c
with	c
me	c
,	c
and	c
she	c
was	c
right	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
really	c
do	i
n't	i
know	c
what	c
to	c
do	c
,	i
I	c
was	c
in	c
love	c
with	c
Brett	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
love	i
my	c
friend	c
too	c
.	c

We	c
both	c
decided	c
to	c
finish	c
with	c
all	i
this	c
stupid	c
affair	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
difficult	c
,	c
but	c
I	i
was	c
the	c
best	c
for	c
everyone	c
.	c

Now	c
I	c
'm	c
very	c
happy	c
because	c
I	c
learned	c
that	c
friends	c
are	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
thing	c
in	c
the	c
hole	i
world	c
.	c

xxxx	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
performance	c
,	i
Over	i
The	c
Rainbow	c
at	c
The	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
on	c
the	c
14th	c
of	c
June	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
always	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
to	c
enjoy	c
a	c
musical	c
when	c
you	c
go	c
on	c
your	i
holiday	c
to	c
London	c
.	c

London	c
is	c
one	c
of	c
Europe	c
's	c
biggest	c
centre	i
and	c
you	c
can	c
always	c
get	i
the	c
best	c
in	c
show	c
business	c
.	i

Furthermore	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
shooked	i
when	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
main	c
persons	i
entered	i
the	c
stage	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
the	c
Theatre	c
Restaurant	c
was	c
under	i
reparation	i
so	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
find	c
another	c
one	c
for	c
the	i
evening	c
supper	i
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

A	c
century	c
ago	c
,	c
when	c
a	c
farmer	c
took	c
the	c
horses	c
out	c
of	c
the	c
stable	c
and	c
put	c
the	c
plouge	i
behind	c
them	c
,	c
we	i
've	i
got	i
the	c

Why	c
not	c
talk	c
about	c
the	i
social	c
life	c
just	c
sitting	c
around	c
a	c
table	c
without	i
no	i
rush	c
.	c

I	c
visited	c
an	c
airport	c
some	c
days	c
ago	c
and	c
in	c
nearly	c
every	c
crowded	c
corner	c
,	i
I	c
could	c
see	c
those	c
busy	c
people	c
always	i
on	c
their	c
way	c
.	i

I	c
can	c
send	c
and	c
save	c
information	c
and	c
the	c
possibilities	c
are	c
uncountless	i
.	c

In	c
nearly	c
every	c
home	c
you	c
can	c
find	c
it	i
and	c
the	c
users	c
now	c
and	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
are	c
the	c
new	c
generation	c
.	c

Watch	c
out	i
highly	i
advanced	i
technologies	i
are	i
appropriate	i
and	c
helpful	c
for	c
me	c
and	c
others	c
if	i
we	c
only	c
remember	c
the	c
importance	c
of	c
time	i
to	c
be	c
together	c

Another	c
actor	c
standed	i
for	i
him	c
,	c
without	c
any	c
advice	i

Another	c
thing	c
was	c
the	c
confirmed	i
hour	i
of	c
the	c
show	c
which	i
it	c
started	c
forty-five	c
minutes	c
later	i
without	c
any	c

reason	c

Moreover	c
,	c
as	c
I	c
had	c
read	c
the	c
advertisement	c
carefully	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
planned	c
to	c
invite	c
some	c
friends	c
to	c
have	c
dinner	c
at	c
the	c
theater	i
's	i
restaurant	c

At	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
all	c
these	c
circumstances	i
we	i
were	c
so	c
puzzled	c
and	c
disappointed	c
that	c
we	c
decided	c
to	c
make	c
a	c
complaint	c

So	c
,	c
due	i
to	i
the	c
things	c
I	c
have	c

I	c
cuold	i
read	c
in	c
the	c

that	c
there	c

some	c

That	c

It	c

every	c

and	c
I	c
do	c
not	c

Tecnology	i

,	c
well	c
hardly	i
for	c
everything	c

Mostly	i
all	c
of	c
us	c
,	i
today	c
know	c
what	c
is	i
internet	i
about	c
,	c
but	c
one	c
or	c
two	c
year	i
ago	c
we	c
did	c
not	c

And	c
when	c
we	c
understand	i
internet	i
,	c
we	c
thought	c
that	c
meeting	c
people	c
from	c
other	c
countrys	i

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
,	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
organising	c
the	c
school	c
trip	c
in	i
London	c
.	c

According	c
to	c
the	c
advertisement	c
I	c
have	c
seen	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
supposed	c
to	c
show	c
the	c
latest	c
fashions	c
,	c
leisure	i
and	i
sports	i
wear	i
,	c
make	i
up	i
and	c
hairstyles	c
.	c

It	c
might	c
be	c
a	c
good	c
idea	c
to	c
fit	c
this	c
visit	c
in	c
in	c
the	c
afternoon	c
on	c
14th	c
March	c
because	c
I	c
strongly	c
believe	c
that	c
it	c
would	c
stimulate	c
our	c
interests	c
in	c
London	c
so	c
that	c
we	c
could	c
study	c
English	c
with	c
strongest	i
motivation	c
.	c

Even	c
if	c
we	c
do	c
not	c
have	c
enough	c
time	c
for	c
shopping	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
we	c
will	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
go	c
shopping	c
at	i
a	i
free	c
time	c
on	c
15th	c
March	c
.	c

I	c
sincerely	c
hope	c
this	c
letter	c
will	c
be	c
of	c
some	c
help	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

Therefore	c
,	c
they	c
should	i
deserve	c
to	c
lead	c
a	c
normal	c
life	c
as	c
we	c
do	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
noone	i
has	c
the	c
right	c
to	c
look	i
at	i
anyone	c
's	c
private	c
life	c
even	c
if	c
they	c
are	c
journalists	c
.	c

Some	c
people	c
might	c
say	c
that	c
we	c
all	c
have	c
the	c
right	c
to	c
know	c
everything	c
happening	c
in	c
the	c
world	c
as	c
one	c
of	c
the	i
human	c
rights	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
they	c
mix	c
them	c
up	c
and	c
that	c
they	c
should	c
think	c
about	c
the	c
right	c
of	i
privacy	c
.	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
famous	c
people	c
are	c
the	c
same	c
as	c
we	c
are	c
,	c
and	c
we	c
all	c
have	c
the	c
right	c
to	c
lead	c
a	c
private	c
life	c
and	c
no	c
right	c
to	c
break	i
into	i
their	c
privacy	c
.	c

Therefore	c
,	c
I	c
strongly	c
believe	c
that	c
famous	c
people	c
deserve	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
private	c
life	c
without	c
journalists	c
following	c
them	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
in	c
connection	c
with	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
your	c
theatre	c
company	c
has	c
presented	i
recently	c
,	c
and	c
,	c
I	c
want	c
you	c
to	c
know	c
,	c
it	c
has	c
really	c
disappointed	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
paid	c
twenty	c
pounds	c
for	c
my	c
ticket	c
because	c
,	c
as	c
you	c
may	c
know	c
,	c
there	c
were	c
not	c
discounts	i
available	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
for	c
this	c
reason	c
,	i
I	c
think	c
you	c
should	c
return	i
me	c
some	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
its	c
owner	c
had	c
decided	c
to	c
go	c
on	c
holiday	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

If	c
I	c
had	c
know	c
it	c
before	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
have	i
never	i
told	c
her	c
,	c
because	c
then	c
,	i
that	i
was	c
really	c
important	c
for	c
me	c
,	c
but	c
,	c
anyway	c
,	c
presently	i
,	c
it	c
does	c
n't	c
really	c
matter	c
me	i
.	c

By	i
the	i
time	i
,	c
Pat	c
and	c
me	i
had	c
a	c
close	c
relationship	c
.	c

We	c
had	c
many	c
points	i
in	c
common	c
and	c
we	c
knew	c
each	c
other	c
as	c
if	c
we	c
were	c
sisters	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
one	c
day	c
our	c
friendship	c
was	c
broken	c
down	i
.	c

I	c
told	c
her	c
I	c
was	c
falling	c
in	c
love	c
with	c
my	c
best	c
friend	c
and	c
she	c
decided	c
to	c
explain	i
it	i
everybody	c
in	c
our	c
group	i
,	c
despite	c
knowing	c
that	c
must	i
be	i
a	c
secret	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
met	c
Caballos	c
,	c
my	c
best	c
friend	c
,	c
I	c
felt	c
embarassd	i
and	c
disappointed	c
and	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
say	c
anything	c
.	c

Now	c
I	c
wish	c
all	c
of	c
this	c
had	c
never	c
happened	c
,	c
while	c
I	c
try	c
to	c
forget	c
it	c
laughing	i
with	c
Caballos	c
and	c
Pat	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
glad	c
to	c
receive	c
this	c
great	c
notice	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
excited	c
about	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
entered	c
in	i
this	c
competition	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
always	c
wanted	c
to	c
do	c
these	i
kind	c
of	c
things	i
.	c

In	c
your	c
letter	c
you	c
asked	c
me	c
when	c
I	c
would	c
rather	i
travel	i
,	i
I	c
will	c
be	c
able	c
only	i
on	i
July	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
work	c
and	c
I	c
can	c
take	c
some	c
days	c
off	c
on	i
this	i
month	c
.	c

About	c
the	c
I	i
have	c
to	c
choose	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
something	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
tennis	c
and	c
photography	c
but	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
practice	i
new	c
ones	c
,	c
if	c
it	c
is	c
possible	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
if	c
there	c
is	c
any	c
place	c
where	c
I	c
can	c
buy	c
some	c
souvenirs	c
,	c
so	i
to	i
take	c
some	c
money	c
with	c
me	c
and	i
I	c
would	c
be	c
very	c
grateful	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
send	c
me	c
a	c
list	c
of	c
clothes	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Every	c
woman	c
in	c
the	c
world	c
likes	c
the	c
word	c
shopping	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
like	i
if	c
they	c
lose	c
their	c
concience	i
while	c
they	c
are	c
shopping	c
.	c

May	i
be	i
it	c
is	c
not	c
for	c
you	c
,	c
may	i
be	i
it	i
is	i
a	c
present	c
,	c
but	c
buying	c
things	c
at	i
least	c
for	c
me	c
it	i
is	c
the	c
best	c
.	c

But	c
all	c
this	c
power	c
and	c
all	c
this	c
excitement	c
could	c
turn	c
into	c
something	c
that	c
you	c
could	c
start	c
to	c
hate	c
.	c

When	c
you	c
go	c
shopping	c
and	c
there	c
are	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
people	c
in	c
the	c
same	c
place	c
,	c
all	c
trying	c
to	c
find	c
the	c
best	c
prices	c
and	c
not	c
carying	i
about	c
anybody	c
,	c
this	c
could	c
get	i
crazy	i
to	i
anyone	i
.	c

The	c
long	c
queues	c
,	c
close	i
places	c
,	c
hight	i
prices	c
,	c
sales	c
,	c
all	c
these	c
things	c
conbined	i
could	c
make	c
shopping	c
an	c
enjoyable	c
thing	c
for	c
people	c
who	c
like	c
doing	c
it	c
.	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

Is	c
it	c
possible	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
?	c

And	c
also	c
I	c
like	c
to	c
camp	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
,	c
because	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
more	c
interesting	c
than	c
log	c
cabins	c
.	c

You	c
need	c
to	c
do	c
everything	c
by	c
yourself	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c

You	c
can	c
find	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
interesting	c
things	c
which	c
you	i
unexpected	c
.	c

Some	c
people	c
enjoy	c
window	c
shopping	c
,	c
but	c
some	c
people	c
enjoy	c
spending	c
their	c
money	c
on	c
their	i
clothes	c
or	c
shoes	c
.	c

In	i
other	i
hand	i
,	c
after	c
shopping	c
you	c
'll	c
get	c
tired	c
and	c
maybe	c
you	c
ca	c
n't	c
afford	c
your	c
credit	c
card	c
.	c

For	c
instance	c
,	c
you	c
want	i
to	c
buy	c
everything	c
which	c
you	c
saw	c
,	c
and	c
after	c
that	c
,	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
how	c
much	c
you	c
have	c
spent	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
shopping	c
has	c
pros	c
and	c
cons	c
,	i
it	i
depends	c
on	c
personal	c
thinking	i
.	c

I	c
enjoy	c
shopping	c
very	c
much	c
,	i
it	i
can	c
let	i
me	c
know	c
what	c
's	c
going	c
on	c
in	c
the	c
world	c
.	c

But	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
good	c
idea	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
break	c
during	c
the	c
shopping	c
,	i
you	i
wo	c
n't	c
feel	c
so	c
tired	c
.	c

Dear	c
Ms.	c
Ryan	c
,	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
with	i
reference	i
to	i
the	c
competition	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
,	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
the	c
only	c
month	c
that	c
I	c
am	c
free	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
prefer	c
cabins	c
.	c

Although	c
I	c
have	c
played	c
tennis	c
only	c
twice	c
,	c
I	c
really	c
enjoyed	c
it	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
I	c
once	c
have	i
been	i
trained	i
in	c
a	c
swimming	c
centre	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
am	c
quite	c
confident	c
with	i
it	i
.	c

Lastly	c
,	c
could	c
you	c
please	c
tell	c
me	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
and	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
should	c
prepare	i
and	c
do	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
buy	c
insurance	c
myself	c
?	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c

the	c
lessons	c
which	c
English	c
and	i
other	c
foreigners	c
are	c
particularlly	i
curious	c
in	i

As	c
far	c
as	c
I	c
know	c
,	c
English	c
people	c
are	c
really	c
surprised	c
about	i
Chinese	i
students	c
'	c
advanced	c
level	c
in	c
Maths	c
,	c
as	c
well	c
as	c
the	i
knowledge	c

You	c
can	c
find	c
students	c
use	i
traditional	c

to	c
draw	c

write	c

In	i
spite	i
of	i

Dear	c
sir	c
,	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
show	c
presented	c
by	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
last	c
Tuesday	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
been	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
seeing	c
his	c
performance	c
for	c
ages	c
,	c
so	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
I	c
realized	c
there	c
was	c
a	c
substitute	c
on	c
the	c
stage	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
really	c
disappointed	c
.	c

I	c
suggest	c
you	c
should	c
solve	c
these	c
problems	c
quickly	c
.	c

If	c
I	c
were	c
you	c
,	c
I	c
should	c
keep	c
open	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
heard	c
people	c
saying	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
pity	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

Thanks	c
to	c
you	c
,	c
I	c
've	c
had	c
the	c
most	c
dreadful	c
experience	c
of	c
my	c
life	c
.	c

Write	c
back	c
soon	c

New	c
technologies	c
have	c
affected	c
people	c
's	c
way	c
of	c
living	i
for	c
ages	c
,	c
by	c
offering	c
them	c
better	c
tools	c
to	i
survive	c

Neither	c
do	c
I.	c
In	c
particular	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
talk	c
about	c
Internet	i
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
Internet	i
has	c
changed	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
most	c
of	c
all	c
.	c

In	c
fact	c
,	c
now	c
I	c
can	c
write	c
to	c
friends	c
who	c
live	c
in	c
foreign	c
countries	c
,	c
for	c
exemple	i
in	i
the	c
morning	c
and	c
receive	c
back	i
their	c
answer	c
in	c
the	c
evening	c
or	c
even	c
just	c
a	c
minute	c
after	c
writing	c
.	c

I	c
can	c
say	c
such	c
things	c
because	c
I	c
use	c
the	c
net	c
in	c
the	c
same	c
way	c
and	c
I	c
'm	c
really	c
astounded	c
by	c
its	i
way	c
of	i
changing	i
my	c
daily	c
life	c

JUNE	c
2000	c

I	c
am	c
really	c
glad	c
for	i
reciving	i
the	c
first	c
priec	i
in	c
your	c
competition	c
,	i
I	i
will	c
be	c
very	c
plesant	i
joining	i
the	i
holliday	i
.	c

According	i
to	i
your	c
first	c
question	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
only	c
at	i
July	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
my	c
school	c
holliday	i
so	c
I	c
would	c
not	c
miss	c
any	c
class	i
.	c

I	c
rather	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
tents	c
because	c
I	c
like	c
to	c
stay	c
as	c
closest	i
as	c
possible	c
to	c
nature	c
,	i
it	c
makes	c
me	c
feel	c
better	c
.	c

As	i
a	i
regard	i
for	i
activities	c
I	c
would	c
choose	c
singing	c
and	c
surfing	c
,	i
surfing	i
because	c
it	c
is	c
my	c
favourit	i
sport	c
,	i
I	c
have	c
been	c
surfing	c
since	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
child	c
so	c
I	c
am	c
pretty	c
good	c
on	i
it	c
,	i
and	i
singing	c
because	c
I	c
really	c
love	c
it	c
,	i
I	c
am	c
not	c
as	c
good	c
on	i
singing	c
as	c
I	c
am	c
on	i
surfing	c
but	c
I	c
like	c
doing	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
about	c
somethings	i
which	c
might	c
be	c
necessary	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
take	c
with	c
,	i
like	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
should	c
I	c
take	c
,	c
should	c
I	c
take	c
my	c
own	c
surf	i
board	i
,	c
and	c
what	c
about	c
money	c
,	c
should	c
I	c
bring	c
some	c
with	c
me	c
?	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Dear	c
Kin	c
,	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
breeze	c
to	c
help	c
them	c
and	c
was	c
very	c
cool	c
as	c
well	c
,	i
those	c
guys	c
really	c
know	c
how	c
to	c
play	c
rock	c
.	c

I	c
had	i
only	i
to	c
stay	c
behind	c
the	c
drummer	c
suppling	i
them	c
with	c
water	c
whenever	c
they	c
wanted	c
.	c

When	c
the	c
band	c
had	c
just	c
started	c
to	c
play	c
,	c
lots	c
of	c
girls	c
started	c
to	c
jump	c
the	c
faints	i
getting	c
very	c
close	c
to	c
them	c
,	i
some	i
of	c
the	c
girls	c
started	c
to	c
take	c
their	c
clothes	c
of	i
,	c
which	c
was	c
the	c
best	c
part	c
for	c
me	c
,	c
but	c
some	c
of	c
securities	i
went	c
there	c
and	c
took	c
them	c
away	c
.	c

Afterwards	c
,	c
the	c
Ramones	c
had	c
a	c
short	c
break	c
and	c
when	c
they	c
went	i
back	c
from	c
their	c
break	c
they	i
've	i
just	i
went	i
of	i
.	i

I	c
had	c
a	c
really	c
nice	c
time	c
with	c
them	c
even	c
tought	i
I	c
would	c
've	c
prefered	i
to	c
stay	c
at	c
the	c
front	c
with	c
the	c
others	i
people	c
,	c
but	c
anyway	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
great	c
experience	c
for	c
me	c
,	c
I	c
holp	i
to	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
help	c
them	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

I	c
holp	i
you	c
've	c
enjoed	i

.	c

See	c

Although	c
many	c
people	c
enjoy	c
shopping	c
,	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

Sometimes	c
the	c
seller	i
might	c
even	c
ignore	c
you	c
as	c
he	c
or	c
she	c
is	c
talking	c
to	c
another	c
sellor	i
.	c

Then	c
,	c
one	c
of	c
them	c
serves	c
you	c
but	c
half	c
listens	c
to	c
you	c
because	c
he	c
or	c
she	c
is	c
still	c
talking	c
to	c
the	c
other	c
sellor	i
.	c

All	c
this	c
to	i
say	c
that	c
shopping	c
may	c
seem	c
enjoyable	c
but	c
often	c
is	c
not	c
.	c

Further	c
to	c
the	c
umpleasent	i
fact	i
that	c
took	c
place	c
last	c
week	c
I	i
am	i
in	i
my	c
right	c
of	i
complaining	i
about	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
I	c
saw	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
when	c
we	c
arrived	c
we	c
went	c
to	c
pay	c
and	c
we	c
gave	c
a	i
discount	c
ticket	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
not	c
available	i
but	c
the	c
worst	c
thing	c
was	c
that	c
nobody	c
explained	i
us	i
the	i
reason	i
.	c

The	c
show	c
had	i
to	c
start	c
at	c
19:30	c
and	c
it	c
did	c
not	c
start	c
until	c
8:15	c
,	i
then	i
I	c
felt	c
dissappointed	i
because	c
the	c
main	c
actor	c
had	c
been	c
changed	c
.	c

It	c
had	i
not	i
been	c
such	c
a	c
terrible	c
thing	c
if	c
the	c
new	c
actor	c
would	i
have	i
acted	c
as	c
well	c
as	c
the	c
other	c
one	c
.	c

If	c
it	i
does	c
not	c
seem	c
enough	c
,	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
by	i
boyfriend	c
wanted	c
to	c
invite	i
me	c
to	c
eat	c
something	c
in	c
the	c
theatre	c
's	c
restaurant	c
but	c
the	c
umpleasent	i
surprise	c
was	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
all	c
the	c
waiters	c
were	c
on	c
holiday	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
our	c
last	c
school	c
year	c
,	c
so	c
we	c
decided	c
to	c
organize	c
a	c
trip	c
to	c
celebrate	c
we	i
had	c
finally	c
finished	c
it	i
.	c

We	c
knew	c
that	c
our	c
parents	c
would	c
n't	c
let	c
us	c
to	i
travel	i
alone	c
so	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
invent	c
a	c
story	c
to	c
avoid	c
they	i
could	i
realize	i
what	c
happened	i
.	c

Kim	c
,	c
Kate	c
and	c
Pat	c
told	c
their	c
parents	c
they	c
were	c
going	c
to	c
travel	c
with	c
the	c
school	c
and	c
so	c
,	i
did	c
I.	c
We	c
were	c
excited	c
and	c
we	c
started	c
to	c
organized	i
everything	c
.	c

It	c
seemed	c
the	i
perfect	c
holiday	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
.	c

Pat	c
told	c
him	c
our	c
idea	c
.	c

Pour	i
Pat	c
,	c
she	c
did	c
n't	c
know	c
my	c
brother	c
,	c
she	c
did	c
n't	c
know	c
how	c
he	c
was	c
.	c

We	c
lost	c
our	c
holidays	i
.	c

To	c
Competition	c
Organiser	c

Thank	c

From	c
activities	i
which	c

I	c

I	c
really	c
enjoy	c
it	c

I	c
'm	c
not	c
so	c
good	c
in	i
tennis	c
but	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
play	c
it	c
for	i
practise	i
.	c

It	i
is	i
all	i
about	i
me	i

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
something	c

At	i
first	i
,	c
which	i
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	i
need	c
take	i
with	c
me	c

because	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c

They	c
are	c
loosing	i
time	c
of	i
their	c
life	c
for	c
nothing	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
we	c
must	c
spend	c
more	c
time	c
for	i
more	c
interesting	c
than	i
shopping	i
things	i
like	i
sport	c

reading	c
,	c
chating	i
about	c
ideas	c
which	c
make	c

Do	c
you	c
know	c
last	i
week	c
I	c
have	i
been	i
to	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
to	c
help	c
my	c
uncle	c
,	c
who	c
is	c
the	c
director	c
of	c
the	c
stadium	c
of	c
Lugano	c
.	c

The	c
best	c
part	c
of	c
the	c
day	c
was	c
after	c
the	c
concert	c
,	c
when	c
I	c
met	c
the	c
group	c
"	c
U2	c
"	c
.	c

I	c
took	c
some	c
photographies	i
and	c
I	c
'll	c
show	c
them	c
to	c
you	c
when	c
you	c
come	c
next	c
week	c

He	c
's	c
quite	c
old	c
,	c
but	c
very	c
attractive	c

I	c

saying	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
a	c
two-week	c
holiday	c
in	c
your	c
recent	c
competition	c
and	c
it	c
will	c
all	c
paid	i
in	i
advance	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
rather	c
stay	c
in	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
log	c
cabins	c
as	c
I	c
am	c
allergic	c
to	c
many	c
plants	c
and	c
insects	c
and	c
I	c
should	c
avoid	c
contacting	i
them	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
wonderful	c
to	c
hear	c
that	c
there	c
is	c
a	c
good	c
variety	c
of	c
activities	c
available	c
at	c
the	c
camp	c
.	c

As	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
interested	c
in	c
photography	c
and	c
swimming	c
I	c
am	c
hoping	c
to	c
take	c
part	c
in	c
them	i
.	c

I	c
came	c
second	c
last	i
year	c
's	c
swimming	c
competition	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
enrolled	c
photography	i
classes	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

I	c
am	c
terribly	c
sorry	c
not	c
to	c
drop	c
you	c
a	c
line	c
since	c
the	c
last	c
time	c
we	c
wrote	c
to	c
one	c
another	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
finally	i
got	i
around	c
writing	i
and	c
you	c
'll	c
see	c
that	c
it	i
's	i
definetly	i
worth	c
waiting	c
as	i
I	c
have	c
some	c
great	c
and	c
unbeliavable	i
news	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
know	c
I	c
'm	c
on	c
half-term	c
school	c
holiday	c
and	c
have	c
plenty	c
of	c
time	c
to	c
do	c
much	i
more	c
different	i
things	c
apart	c
from	c
studying	c
my	c
A-level	c
history	c
,	c
such	c
as	c
meeting	c
up	c
my	i
friends	c
,	c
visiting	c
interesting	c
places	c
or	c
even	c
going	c
to	c
the	c
cinema	c
on	c
my	c
own	c
.	c

However	c
this	i
term	c
has	c
been	c
a	c
far	c
cry	c
from	c
the	c
others	c
.	c

Couple	i
of	c
days	c
ago	c
I	c
bumped	c
into	c
my	c
best	c
friend	c
who	i
is	c
into	c
music	c
and	i
we	c
started	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
chat	c
about	c
what	c
we	c
had	c
both	c
been	c
doing	c
.	c

She	c
invited	c
me	c
to	c
the	c
rehearsal	c
of	c
a	c
huge	c
consert	i
whose	i
singer	c
was	i
a	c
well-known	c
pop	c
star	c
as	c
well	c
as	c
my	c
favorite	i
.	c

Can	c
you	c
believe	c
that	c
I	c
was	c
introduced	c
to	c
him	c
and	c
I	c
took	c
numerous	c
photographs	c
some	i
of	c
which	c
I	c
put	c
in	c
the	c
envelope	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
like	c
a	c
dream	c
come	c
true	c
,	c
and	c
was	c
the	c
best	c
part	c
of	c
the	c
experience	c
in	c
my	c
opinion	c
.	c

I	c
helped	c
out	c
my	c
friend	c
by	c
writing	c
huge	c
billboards	c
and	c
making	c
some	c
light	c
refreshments	c
.	c

Despite	c
the	c
fact	c
that	c
I	c
felt	c
exhausted	c
I	c
must	c
admit	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
days	c
I	c
will	c
never	c
forget	c
througout	i
my	c
life	i

write	i
me	i
soon	c
.	c

Yours	i
sincerely	i
,	c

Dear	c
director	c
of	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theater	i
!	c

Last	c
week	c
I	c
was	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

On	c
Friday	c
we	c
,	c
my	c
friend	c
and	c
I	c
visited	i
your	c
Theater	i
to	c
see	c
'	c
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
'	c
.	c

The	c
first	c
thing	c
that	c
happen	i
was	c
that	c
the	c
show	c
did	c
n't	c
start	c
on	c
time	c
.	c

Instead	c
of	c
730	i
am	c
as	c
your	c
advertisment	i
said	c
,	c
it	c
started	c
815	i
am	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
meantime	c
we	c
tried	c
to	c
get	c
our	c
money	c
back	c
to	c
do	c
something	c
else	c
,	c
but	c
that	c
was	c
impossible	c
.	c

When	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
was	c
not	c
acting	c
,	c
witch	i
was	c
a	c
great	c
dissapointment	i
for	c
us	c
both	c
.	c

We	c
are	c
both	c
big	c
faan	i
of	c
him	i

When	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
finished	c
we	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
resturant	i
to	c
have	c
something	c
to	c
eat	c
.	c

But	c
then	c
it	c
was	c
cloesed	i
because	i
of	i
reparations	i
.	c

We	c
both	c
have	i
Â£	c
15	c
tickets	c
.	c

She	c
was	c
my	c
best	c
friend	c
for	c
several	c
years	c
as	c
a	c
child	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
have	c
n't	c
seen	c
her	c
since	c
we	c
were	c
10	c
years	c
old	c
.	c

When	c
were	c
nine	c
years	c
old	c
and	c
were	c
in	c
thired	i
grade	c
we	c
had	c
a	c
'	c
House	c
'	c
where	c
we	c
used	c
to	c
play	c
all	c
afternones	i
.	c

In	c
fact	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
a	c
realy	i
house	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
some	c
stones	c
between	c
the	c
trees	c
in	c
the	c
littel	i
forest	c
neear	i
our	c
house	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
secret	c
place	c
and	c
we	c
had	c
promissed	i
each	c
other	c
not	c
to	c
tell	c
anybody	c
about	c
it	c
.	c

Useally	i
we	c
were	c
cooking	c
flower-soup	i
,	c
and	c
talking	i
secrets	c
.	c

One	c
minute	c
later	c
,	c
Pat	c
and	c
half	c
our	c
classe	i
stod	i
in	c
'	c
the	c
House	c
'	c
looking	c
and	c
laufing	i
at	c
me	c
and	c
my	c
flower	c
soup	c
.	c

But	c
in	c
fact	c
that	c
day	c
she	c
had	c
loosed	i
my	c
friendship	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
a	c
musical	c
show	c
,	c
which	c
I	c
have	i
seen	i
in	c
your	c
theatre	c
,	i
in	c
London	c
during	c
my	c
holiday	c
.	c

For	c
unknown	c
for	i
me	i
reasons	c
,	c
I	c
found	c
the	c
restaurant	c
closed	c
(	c
there	c
was	c
no	c
information	c
telling	i
about	i
a	c
cause	i
of	i
closing	c
it	c
)	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
you	c
guaranteed	c
"	c
a	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
"	c
,	c
but	c
for	c
me	c
it	c
was	c
the	c
worst	c
visit	c
in	i
theatre	i
in	c
two	c
years	c
time	i
.	c

Neither	c
beautiful	i
surranding	i
near	c
your	c
theatre	c
nor	c
comfortable	i
sits	i
will	i
not	i
recompansate	i
my	i
horrible	c
evening	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

Technology	c
is	c
very	c
important	c
in	c
our	c
life	c
.	c

Nevertheless	c
it	i
has	c
some	c
advantages	c
and	c
drawbacks	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
my	i
daily	c
life	c
is	c
full	c
of	c
modern	c
technology	c
.	c

It	c
also	c
changed	c
my	c
life-style	i
for	c
better	i
-	c
I	c
think	c
.	c

Recently	i
,	c
modern	c
technology	c
means	c
:	c
mobile	c
phones	c
,	c
computers	c
,	c
internet	i
,	c
super-fast	c
cars	c
etc.	c
These	c
improvements	c
helps	i
me	c
with	c
my	c
ordinary	c
dutes	i
.	c

Couple	i
of	c
months	c
ago	c
,	c
some	c
foreign	c
scientists	c
noticed	c
that	c
mobile	c
phones	c
make	i
a	i
possibility	i
of	i
getting	i
sick	i
with	i
cancer	i
.	c

Also	c
fast	c
and	c
well-improved	i
car	i
increase	c
a	i
risk	i
of	c
pollution	c
of	i
our	c
air	c
and	c
mainly	c
lead	c
to	c
very	c
dangerous	c
accidents	c
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
I	i
think	c
that	c
modern	c
technology	c
makes	c
our	c
life	c
easier	c
,	i
nevertheless	i
,	c
we	c
should	c
avoid	c
any	c
possible	c
risks	c
connected	c
with	c
these	c
improvements	c
.	c

Then	c
we	c
will	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
technology	c
is	c
something	c
we	c
should	c
be	c
proud	c
of	c
.	c

Now	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
to	c
ask	c
some	i
details	c
about	c
these	c
two	c
weeks	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
and	c
giving	i
some	i
answers	c
to	c
your	c
questions	c
.	c

About	i
the	c
accommodation	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
staying	c
in	c
tents	i
as	c
I	c
used	c
to	c
during	c
summer	c
holidays	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
child	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
you	c
asked	c
me	c
to	c
choise	i
two	c
activities	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
do	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
interesting	i
in	c
photography	c
because	c
my	c
father	c
is	c
a	c
photographer	c
and	c
we	c
are	c
used	c
to	c
spending	c
time	c
each	i
other	i
.	c

As	c
the	i
instructions	c
about	c
clothes	c
and	c
money	c
were	c
not	c
enclosed	i
in	c
your	c
letter	c
,	c
I	i
request	i
about	i
it	i
and	i
ask	i
you	i
to	i
include	i
in	i
it	i
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

For	c
people	c
who	c
used	i
to	i
do	i
shopping	c
,	c
going	c
in	c
big	c
stores	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
they	c
like	c
it	c
and	c
they	i
are	c
always	c
looking	c
for	c
fashioned-clothes	i
.	c

If	c
these	c
people	c
have	c
a	i
family	i
with	i
children	c
,	c
they	c
must	c
buy	c
some	c
food	c
to	c
feed	c
them	c
even	c
if	c
a	i
supermarket	c
is	c
full	c
of	c
people	c
.	c

And	c
now	c
for	c
them	c
shopping	c
can	c
be	c
considerated	i
like	i
a	i
contrariety	i
.	c

Dear	c
Sir/madam	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
with	c
regard	c
to	c
your	c
advertisment	i
.	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
hopefull	i
that	c
I	c
was	c
going	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
good	c
time	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
have	i
had	i
no	c
discount	c
at	i
paying	i
.	c

Because	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
have	c
any	c
plan	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
have	c
a	i
lunch	c
in	c
theatre	i
restaurant	c
.	c

The	c
worst	c
thing	c
is	c
that	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
watch	i
my	c
favorite	i
actor	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
so	c
dissapointted	i
with	i
that	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
are	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
take	c
into	c
consideration	c
my	c
terrible	c
situation	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
waiting	c
for	c
a	c
satisfactory	c
answer	c

Azami	c

Technology	c
has	c
developed	c
increasingly	i
in	c
recent	c
years	c
.	c

As	c
a	c
result	c
of	c
this	c
our	c
society	c
has	c
changed	c
a	c
lot	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
one	c
hand	c
technology	c
has	c
made	c
our	c
lives	c
more	c
comfortable	c
and	c
easier	c
.	c

Nowadays	c
students	c
have	c
much	i
more	c
facilitis	i
in	c
education	c
than	c
before	c
.	c

Although	c
in	c
those	c
days	c
the	c
only	c
way	c
of	c
learning	c
was	c
reading	c
.	c

which	c
were	c
unusuall	i
before	i
.	c

Than	i
to	i
technology	c
we	c
can	c
reach	c
any	c
place	c
in	c
the	c
world	c
easily	c
.	c

We	c
can	c
get	c
some	i
information	c
more	c
quickly	c
.	c

Children	c
play	c
wit	i
computer	i
instead	c
of	c
usuall	i
plays	i
.	c

Despite	c
the	c
huge	c
facilities	i
technology	i
has	c
affected	c
our	c
lives	c
negatively	c
.	c

People	c
are	c
getting	c
more	c
and	c
more	c
lonely	c
.	c

While	c
we	c
are	c
using	c
technology	c
,	c
we	c
should	c
take	c
into	c
consideration	c
environment	i
.	c

We	c
should	c
n't	c
allow	c
to	i
be	i
exploited	i
the	i
world	i
.	c

Dear	c
Mr.	c
Robertson	c
,	c

The	c
programme	c
you	c
suggest	c
is	c
versatile	c
and	c
full	c
of	c
interesting	c
activities	c
.	c

We	c
are	c
eager	c
to	c
attend	c
National	i
Art	c
Gallery	c
and	c
Science	c
Museum	c
.	c

We	c
have	c
seen	c
an	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
and	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
this	c
exciting	c
show	c
.	c

It	c
will	c
take	c
place	c
in	c
the	c
Central	c
Exhibition	c
Hall	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
on	i
the	c
14th	c
of	c
March	c
from	c
10	c
a.m.	c
to	c
19	i
p.m	i
.	i

Our	c
students	c
will	c
have	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
of	i
seeing	i
the	c
latest	c
fashion	i
,	c
as	c
this	c
unique	c
show	c
is	c
held	c
only	c
once	c
a	c
year	c
.	c

What	c
's	c
more	c
,	c
new	c
hairstyles	c
and	c
leisure	c
and	c
sports	c
wear	c
are	c
presented	c
there	c
.	c

We	c
are	c
thinking	c
here	c
particularly	c
of	c
the	c
fact	c
,	i
that	c
we	c
can	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
instead	c
of	c
shopping	c
.	c

But	c
such	c
an	c
attitude	c
is	c
wrong	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
quite	c
obvious	c
,	i
that	c
celebreties	i
ca	c
n't	c
lead	c
a	c
normal	c
life	c
,	c
as	c
they	c
are	c
constantly	c
followed	c
by	c
reporters	c
,	c
what	i
makes	c
their	c
life	c
miserable	c
.	c

The	c
first	c
point	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
make	c
is	c
that	c
a	i
private	c
life	c
of	c
a	c
celebrity	c
is	c
open	c
to	c
public	i
.	c

It	c
is	c
common	c
knowledge	c
,	i
that	c
such	c
an	i
attention	c
inevitably	c
tells	c
on	c
relationships	c
in	c
the	c
family	c
.	c

Another	c
aspect	c
is	c
that	c
children	i
of	c
famous	c
people	c
suffer	c
a	c
lot	c
from	c
this	c
attention	c
.	c

They	c
ca	c
n't	c
communicate	c
with	c
ordinary	c
children	c
and	i
attend	c
ordinary	c
schools	c
.	c

And	c
last	c
,	c
but	c
not	c
least	c
is	i
the	c
fact	c
that	c
famous	c
people	c
ca	c
n't	c
express	c
their	c
emotions	c
,	c
show	i
their	c
real	c
feelings	c
to	c
public	i
.	c

And	c
it	c
tells	c
on	c
their	c
attitude	c
to	c
life	c
and	c
on	c
their	c
character	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
sum	c
up	c
by	c
saying	c
that	c
every	c
person	c
,	c
either	i
famous	c
or	c
not	c
,	c
deserves	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
private	c
life	c
without	c
being	c
followed	c
or	c
disturbed	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
show	c
which	c
I	c
saw	c
last	c
Friday	c
at	c
your	c
theatre	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
when	c
I	c
went	c
and	c
bought	c
my	c
ticket	c
,	c
there	c
was	c
no	c
discount	c
but	i
in	c
your	c
advertisement	c
it	c
said	i
clearly	i
that	c
discounts	c
are	c
available	c
and	c
as	c
a	c
result	c
my	i
ticket	c
was	i
bought	i
more	i
expensive	c
.	c

Last	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
it	c
said	i
in	c
your	c
advertisement	c
that	c
there	c
is	c
a	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
after	i
the	c
show	c
but	c
it	c
turned	c
out	c
to	c
be	c
closed	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
redecorating	i
and	c
no	c
annocement	i
was	c
made	c
.	c

I	c
did	c
n't	c
have	c
a	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
and	c
instead	c
I	c
had	c
a	i
awful	c
evening	c
out	c
.	c

Therefore	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
are	i
refund	i
of	i
my	i
ticket	i
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
a	i

the	c
informations	i
you	c
need	c
and	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
one	c
or	c
two	c
questions	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
come	c
in	c
july	i
because	c
I	c
work	c
in	i
a	c
big	c
company	c
where	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
your	c
holiday	c
in	c
this	i
month	c
.	c

For	c
the	c
accomodation	i
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
,	c
I	c
will	i
prefer	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
because	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
more	c
comfortable	c
than	c
a	c
tent	c
,	c
and	c
in	c
case	c
it	i
has	i
a	c
big	c
storm	c
with	c
a	i
heavy	c
rain	c
it	i
's	i
more	c
resistant	c
than	c
a	c
tent	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
a	c
little	c
question	c
,	i
could	i
you	c
tell	c
me	c
if	i
and	i
how	c
money	i
I	c
need	c
to	c
take	c
with	c
me	c
,	c
and	c
which	i
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
?	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
this	c
letter	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
my	i
good	c
experience	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
,	c
last	c
month	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
came	i
,	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
bit	c
afraid	c
because	c
I	c
did	c
not	c
know	c
what	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
,	c
but	c
a	c
very	c
nice	c
girl	c
told	c
me	c
that	c
my	c
first	c
job	c
was	c
looking	i
for	c
people	c
whose	i
felt	c
bad	c
and	c
to	c
guide	c
them	c
to	c
the	c
nursery	i
.	c

I	c
did	c
that	c
two	i
hours	c
,	i
this	i
first	c
job	c
was	c
sometimes	c
a	c
bit	c
boring	c
but	c
I	c
felt	c
like	c
someone	c
who	c
save	i
people	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
was	c
really	c
happy	c
!	c

My	c
second	c
was	i
to	c
take	c
the	c
money	c
at	i
the	c
bars	c
and	c
to	c
bring	i
them	i
in	i
a	c
little	c
room	c
where	c
I	c
could	c
see	c
the	c
pop	i
star	i
walked	i
in	c
the	c
corridor	c
.	c

The	i
next	i
weekend	c
I	c
have	c
an	i
appointment	i
with	c
one	c
them	i
,	c
but	c
I	c
do	i
n't	i
tell	c
you	c
the	c
name	c
because	c
you	c
'll	c
fell	i
jalous	i
!	c

See	c
you	c
soon	c

Best	c
wishes	c

Dear	c
Mrs.	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
'm	c
very	c
glad	c
about	c
that	c
and	c
I	c
also	c
want	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
a	c
few	c
questions	c
.	c

I	c
can	c
only	c
travel	c
to	c
California	c
this	c
July	c
because	c
it	i
will	c
be	c
my	i
winter	c
holidays	c
.	c

Before	c
and	c
after	c
this	c
period	c
is	c
impossible	c
for	c
me	c
:	c
I	c
have	c
classes	c
and	c
I	c
also	c
have	c
to	c
work	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
always	c
dreamed	c
about	c
going	c
camping	c
and	c
staying	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
.	c

Now	c
my	c
dream	c
will	c
finally	c
come	c
true	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
this	c
way	c
is	c
better	c
to	c
keep	c
in	c
touch	c
with	c
the	i
nature	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
do	c
photografy	i
and	c
swimming	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
learn	c
more	c
about	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
always	c
swam	i
and	c
I	c
can	c
say	c
I	c
'm	c
good	c
on	i
it	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
will	c
need	c
to	c
take	c
,	c
if	c
it	c
's	c
cold	c
out	c
there	c
and	c
about	c
the	c
money	c
.	c

Do	c
you	c
have	c
any	c
idea	c
about	c
how	c
much	c
we	c
spend	c
per	c
day	c
?	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
from	i
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
,	c

Yours	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c

We	c
can	c
hear	c
many	c
items	i
people	c
saying	c
that	c
when	c
they	c
are	c
upset	c
or	c
stressed	c
they	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
shopping	c
.	c

Is	i
a	c
kind	c
of	c
relief	c
for	c
them	c
.	c

Specially	i
if	c
we	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
to	c
worry	c
about	c
money	c
.	c

It	c
can	c
stress	c
you	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
when	c
the	c
place	c
is	c
crowded	c
and	c
noisy	c
and	c
you	c
ca	c
n't	c
even	c
move	c
easily	c

Dear	c
Madam	c

First	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
only	i
July	i
,	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
got	c
a	c
job	c
and	c
only	i
July	i
is	i
the	i
time	c
I	c
can	c
have	c
a	c
vacation	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
choose	c
swimming	c
and	c
photography	c
for	i
activities	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
a	i
planty	i
of	c
experience	c
and	c
knowledge	c
of	c
both	c
aspect	i
of	i
part	i
.	c

Lastly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
two	c
questions	c
.	c

One	c
of	c
them	c
is	c
that	i
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
suitable	i
on	c
this	c
camp	c
.	c

Another	c
one	c
is	c
that	i
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
prepare	i
.	c

Your	i
sincerely	i

I	c
had	c
a	c
wonderful	c
time	c
last	c
month	c
.	c

I	c
helped	c
a	i
pop	c
concert	c
as	c
a	c
charity	i
.	c

What	c
I	c
particularly	c
liked	c
about	c
the	c
experience	c
was	c
the	c
concert	c
had	i
achived	i
by	i
our	c
supports	i
.	c

It	c
seemed	c
that	c
all	c
people	c
,	c
audience	i
,	c
the	c
band	c
and	c
stuffs	i
were	c
delightful	c
.	c

If	c
I	c
have	c
chance	i
,	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
help	c
a	i
concert	c
again	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
never	c
felt	c
such	c
as	i
satisfaction	c
.	c

I	c
really	c
recomend	i
you	c
to	c
help	c
them	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
this	c
is	c
a	c
good	c
oppotunity	i
and	c
I	c
want	c
you	c
understand	i
my	c
feeling	c
well	c
.	c

I	c
've	c
got	c
lots	c
of	c
things	c
about	c
the	c
concert	c
to	c
talk	c
to	c
you	c
.	i

If	c
you	c
have	c
time	c
,	c
drop	c
me	c
a	c
line	c
,	c
please	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
,	c

It	c
takes	c
place	c
at	c
the	c
Central	c
Exhibition	c
Hall	c
in	c
London	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
March	c
14	c
at	c
10.00-19.00	c
.	c

The	c
show	c
will	c
have	c
latest	i
fashions	c
from	c
top	i
fashion	c
designers	c
in	c
the	c
world	c

Leisure	i
show	c
will	c

,	c
new	c
make	i
up	i
style	i
and	c
new	c
hair	i
style	i
for	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

The	c
best	c
thing	c
is	c
that	c
it	c
is	c
free	c
because	c
we	c
are	c
students	c
.	c

We	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
whether	c
we	c
can	c
change	c
some	c
programme	i
.	c

Our	c
suggestion	c
is	c
that	c
we	c
can	c
go	c
shopping	c
on	c
Wednesday	c
15	c
March	c
so	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
afternoon	c
we	c
can	c
go	c
to	c
The	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
.	c

"	c
Famous	c
people	c
,	c
such	c
as	c
politicians	c
and	c
film	c
stars	c

deserve	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
private	c
life	c
without	c
journalists	c
following	c
them	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
"	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
everybody	c
wants	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
happy	c
life	c
in	c
our	c
own	i
world	c
,	i
we	i
want	c
to	c
do	c
whatever	c
we	c
want	c
,	i
sometimes	i
we	c
do	c
the	c
right	c
things	c
and	c
sometimes	c
we	c
do	c
the	c
wrong	c
things	c
.	c

We	c
are	c
ordinary	c
people	c
,	i
we	i
work	c
and	c
come	i
home	c
to	c
have	i
activities	c
with	c
our	c
family	c
or	c
go	c
out	c
together	c
.	c

The	i
politicians	i
and	c
film	c
stars	c
also	c
want	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
normal	c
life	c
after	c
work	c

They	c
want	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
private	c
life	c
without	c
journalists	c
following	c
them	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
,	i
if	c
the	c
journalist	i
want	c
to	c
publish	c
the	c
politicians	i
and	c
film	c
stars	i
private	c
life	i

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
this	c
letter	c
to	c
mention	c
all	c
the	c
disappointing	c
events	c
in	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
"	i
Over	c
The	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
.	c

As	c
well	i
as	i
you	c
can	c
understand	c
I	i
did	c
not	c
enjoy	c
myself	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
I	c
spent	c
my	c
money	c
for	i
a	c
nonsense	i
thing	c
.	c

My	i
address	i
is	i
here	i
for	i
any	i
contacts	i
,	i

He	c
told	c
everything	c
that	c
Pandora	c
said	c
,	i
to	c
everyone	c
which	i
Pandora	c
did	c
n't	c
want	c
them	i
to	c
know	c
.	c

Pandora	c
had	c
done	c
something	c
very	c
bad	c
like	c
a	c
robbery	c
and	c
one	c
day	c
told	c
this	c
to	c
Pat	c
because	c
she	c
was	c
very	c
shy	i
and	c
regretful	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
she	c
did	c
n't	c
know	c
that	c
Pat	c
could	c
n't	c
keep	c
secrets	c
well	c
.	c

One	c
day	c
while	i
all	c
their	c
friends	c
were	c
there	c
and	c
talking	c
,	c
Pat	c
told	c
everyone	c
that	c
Pandora	c
had	c
done	c
a	c
robbery	c
.	c

All	c
of	c
them	c
were	c
schoked	i
by	c
what	c
they	c
heard	c
.	c

After	c
a	c
week	c
of	i
holiday	c
,	c
when	c
Pandora	c
returned	c
she	c
learned	c
that	c
every	i
of	c
her	c
friends	c
knew	c
that	i
.	c

She	c
became	c
very	c
shy	i
and	c
engry	i
She	i
could	c
n't	c
talk	c
with	c
people	c
and	c
she	c
just	i
was	i
very	c
sad	c
.	c

He	c
admitted	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
his	c
fault	c
to	i
say	i
and	c
told	c
everyone	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
joke	c
to	c
make	c
Pandora	c
a	c
bit	c
angry	c
.	c

After	c
all	c
they	i
again	c
became	c
good	c
friends	c
but	c
Pat	c
learned	c
to	c
keep	c
secrets	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
;	i

Yesterday	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	i
play	c
called	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
which	i
I	c
saw	c
the	c
advertisement	c
in	c
todays	i
Guardian	c
.	c

I	c
want	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
that	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
dissapointed	i
about	c
the	c
play	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
advirtisement	i
it	c
is	i
written	i
that	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
was	c
in	c
the	c
starring	c
.	i

However	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
see	c
him	c
all	c
the	i
night	c
.	c

There	c
was	c
another	c
actor	c
instead	c
of	c
him	c
.	c

I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
re-decoration	i
progress	i
inside	c
.	c

Absolutely	i
it	c
was	c
very	c
dissapointing	i
.	i

so	c
I	c
want	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
understand	c
me	i
and	c
correct	i
your	c
mistakes	c
in	c
the	c
next	c
advirtisement	i
and	c
send	c
me	c
my	c
money	c
soon	c
!	c

Our	c
lifes	i
changed	i
since	c
then	c

Today	c
every	i
5	i
out	i
of	i
10	c
pupil	i
can	c
use	c
computer	i
basicly	i
.	c

These	c
2	c
devices	c
make	c
my	c
life	c
easier	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
watch	c
Tv	i
at	c
home	c
instead	c
of	c
sitting	c
in	c
a	c
chair	c
looking	c
out	c
of	c
a	c
window	c

The	c
internet	i
is	c
the	c

ever	i
made	i

I	c
can	c
do	c
anything	c
I	c
want	c
such	i
as	c
buy	c
Cd	i
's	i
watch	i
film	i
or	c
even	c
buy	c
food	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
really	c
enjable	i
when	c
I	c
chat	c
with	c
pupil	i
.	c

Internet	i
brought	i
a	c
new	c
way	i
to	c
my	c
live	i
since	c
I	c
started	c
to	c
use	c
it	c

Transportation	c

Lots	c
of	c
thing	i
would	c
be	c
hard	c
and	c
boring	c
in	c
my	c
life	c
I	i
was	c
living	c
in	c
a	c
different	c
time	c
than	c
now	c

Technology	c
brought	i
simple	c
solutions	c
to	c
my	c
life	c

and	c
so	i
as	i
anyone	i
.	c

After	c
the	c
boring	c
show	c
finished	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
hungry	c
and	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
but	c
the	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
after	c
19.00	c
.	c

So	c
what	c
's	c
the	c
point	c
to	i
say	i
'	c
visit	c
our	c
restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
'	c
?	c

I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
if	c
you	c
can	c
give	c
the	c
money	c
back	c
to	c
me	c
or	c
I	c
'll	c
write	c
letters	c
to	c
all	c
the	c
media	c
departments	c
to	c
show	c
how	c
tricky	i
you	c
were	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

He	c
went	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
headmaster	c
and	c
told	c
him	c
all	i
the	i
truth	c
.	c

Tim	c
was	c
the	c
one	c
who	c
threw	c
the	c
paper	c
aeroplane	c
to	i
the	c
headmaster	c
and	c
Jon	c
was	c
the	c
one	c
who	c
said	c
some	c
bad	c
words	c
behind	c
the	c
headmaster	i
after	i
he	c
punished	c
Jon	c
.	c

The	c
headmaster	c
was	c
extremely	c
angry	c
about	c
it	c
and	c
he	c
gave	c
both	c
students	c
a	c
heavy	c
punishment	c
,	c
which	c
was	c
suspended	i
from	c
school	c
for	c
a	c
week	c
.	c

When	c
everyone	c
finished	c
their	c
lunch	c
,	c
they	c
all	c
got	c
into	c
their	c
classrooms	c
quickly	c
because	c
they	c
all	c
knew	c
that	c
the	c
headmaster	c
would	i
walk	i
round	c
the	c
school	c
every	c
Thursday	c
.	c

But	c
some	c
naughty	c
students	c
in	c
my	c
class	c
were	c
throwing	c
paper	c
aeroplanes	c
when	c
the	c
teacher	c
was	c
writting	i
something	c
on	c
the	c
board	c
.	c

Everyone	c
was	c
laughing	c
and	c
the	c
headmaster	c
's	c
face	c
was	c
full	c
of	c
anger	c
.	c

The	c
headmaster	c
went	c
to	c
see	c
Jon	c
and	c
Tim	c
and	c
punished	c
their	i
bad	c
behaviours	i
.	c

After	c
that	c
event	c
happened	i
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
Jon	c
and	c
Tim	c
's	c
enemy	c
.	c

They	c
both	c
got	c
into	c
trouble	c
because	c
of	c
him	c
.	c

They	c
do	i
hate	c
him	c
so	c
much	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
become	i
your	i
's	i
advertisment	i
concerning	c
the	c
show	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
I	c
thought	c
that	c
I	i
'll	i
have	c
a	c
great	c
evening	c
,	c
but	c
unfortunatelly	i
it	c
was	c
a	c
big	c
disappointment	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

Maybe	c
I	c
start	i
for	i
the	c
beginning	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
-	c
the	c
main	c
actor	c
in	c
this	c
musical	c
-	c
was	c
abbsend	i
.	c

The	c
show	c
had	c
a	c
45	i
minutes	i
delay	c
-	c
what	c
a	c
shame	c
!	c

Hereby	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
ask	c
for	c
money	i
back	c
or	c
another	i
discounts	i
for	c
me	c
.	c

Waiting	c
for	c
you	i
replay	i
.	c

With	c
best	c
regards	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

The	c
stay	i
has	i
begaun	i
last	c
year	c
,	c
when	c
I	c
stated	i
my	c
summer	c
holiday	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
really	i
a	i
good	c
plan	c
but	c
any	i
good	c
friends	c
.	c

Now	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
think	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
good	c
idea	c
.	c

Sometimes	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
sleep	c
on	c
a	i
railway-stations	i
or	c
under	c
a	i
bridges	c
.	c

After	c
one	c
mounth	i
I	i
came	i
home	i
back	i
and	c
explained	i
my	c
parents	c
how	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
fun	c
had	i
I	i
with	c
my	c
friends	c
-	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
why	c
I	c
was	c
such	c
a	c
lair	i
.	c

But	c
I	c
think	c
,	i
this	c
was	c
a	c
good	c
lesson	c
for	c
me	c
and	c
I	c
lair	i
any	c
more	c
.	c

The	c
reason	c
for	i
which	i
I	c
decided	c
to	c
write	c
you	c
a	c
letter	c
,	c
will	c
,	c
I	c
guess	c
,	c
surprise	c
you	c
.	c

It	i
was	c
very	c
excited	c
thinking	c
about	c
being	c
at	c
the	c
theatre	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
though	i
with	c
certainty	c
I	c
was	c
going	c
to	c
enjoy	c
my	c
evening	c
.	c

You	c
can	c
believe	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
disappointed	c
when	c
I	c
saw	c
that	c
he	c
actually	c
was	c
not	c
playing	i
and	c
I	c
was	c
more	c
bewildered	c
that	c
noone	i
made	c
an	c
apologie	i
for	c
it	c
!	c

How	c
rude	c
!	c

Moreover	c
;	i
it	c
was	c
written	c
that	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
start	c
at	c
19.30	c
;	c
it	c
actually	c
started	c
at	c
exactly	c
20.15	c
!	c

45	c
minutes	c
latter	i
:	c
where	c
we	c
had	c
nothing	c
to	c
do	c
,	c
but	c
waiting	i
.	c

We	c
could	c
n't	c
even	c
have	c
a	c
drink	c
,	c
because	c
,	c
obviously	c
,	c
the	c
restaurant	c
you	c
talked	c
about	c
was	c
closed	c
!	c

I	c
am	c
sure	c
you	c
are	c
smart	c
enough	c
to	c
think	c
of	c
paying	c
me	c
back	c
,	c
so	c
you	c
do	c
not	c
lose	c
a	c
faithful	c
client	i
.	c

Sincerely	c
yours	c
,	c

If	c
more	c
and	c
more	c
ingenors	i
work	c
on	i
science	c
and	c
technology	c
,	c
it	c
must	c
be	c
that	i
it	c
is	c
really	c
usefull	i
:	c
but	c
in	c
what	c
particular	c
way	c
?	c

For	c
my	c
part	c
,	c
I	c
know	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
such	c
a	c
pain	i
in	i
my	i
neck	i
.	c

What	c
a	c
great	c
invention	c
!	c

It	c
allows	c
me	c
to	c
learn	c
anything	c
without	c
having	c
to	c
travel	c
through	i
many	i
libraries	c
as	c
I	c
used	c
to	c
do	c
.	c

It	c
also	c
makes	i
me	c
write	i
to	c
my	c
friends	c
by	c
e-mail	c
.	c

I	c
did	c
not	c
to	i
write	i
at	i
all	i
to	i
people	i
until	c
I	c
have	i
got	c
internet	i
.	c

By	i
this	c
procedure	c
,	c
you	c
only	c
type	c
and	c
send	c
,	c
no	c
need	c
to	c
going	i
to	c
the	c
post-office	i
!	c

Of	c
course	c
this	c
is	c
just	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
lazy	c
,	c
I	c
actually	c
could	c
force	c
me	i
a	c
little	c
,	c
and	c
then	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
library	c
and	c
to	c
the	c
post-office	i
,	c
but	c
internet	i
just	c
makes	c
it	c
easier	c
!	c

I	c
am	c
also	c
very	c
fond	c
of	c
cell-phones	c
.	c

These	c
are	c
also	c
such	i
a	c
relief	c
.	c

Modern	c
technology	c
changed	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
by	c
making	c
it	c
easier	c
and	c
by	c
turning	c
me	c
into	c
a	c
lazy	c
woman	c
.	c

Nevertheless	c
,	c
this	c
easy	c
life	c
has	c
then	c
offered	c
me	c
to	i
be	c
more	c
peaceful	i
and	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
essential	c
.	c

Although	i
I	c
am	c
thankful	c
to	c
modern	c
technology	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

I	c
was	c
training	c
to	c
be	c
a	c
personal	c
assistance	i
to	c
Madonna	c
herself	c
.	c

Maybe	c
,	i
you	c
do	c
n't	c
believe	c
me	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
's	c
true	c
.	c

I	c
applied	c
to	i
the	c
job	c
and	c
she	c
selected	c
me	c
between	i
hundreds	c
of	c
candidates	c
(	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
receive	c
salary	i
)	c
.	c

My	c
work	i
is	c
to	c
help	c
her	c
during	c
each	c
concert	c
.	c

You	c
know	c
,	i
she	c
has	c
a	c
brilliant	c
performance	i
where	c
she	c
must	c
change	c
her	c
customs	i
,	c
make	i
up	i
,	c
scenery	i
,	c
everytime	i
;	c
so	c
she	c
needs	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
people	c
near	c
.	c

My	c
first	c
job	c
was	c
in	i
the	c
Hillsborough	i
's	i
concert	c
(	c
I	c
think	c
,	i
you	c
heard	c
about	c
it	c
)	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
running	c
all	i
the	i
show	i
,	i
my	i
responsability	i
was	c
to	c
get	i
dress	c
her	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
n't	c
alone	c
,	i
I	c
worked	c
with	c
a	c
staff	c
of	c
ten	c
people	c
.	c

We	c
had	c
to	c
take	c
of	i
some	c
clothes	c
and	i
then	c
to	c
put	c
on	c
others	i
ones	i
completly	i
different	i
,	i
in	c
just	c
few	i
minutes	c
(	c
similar	c
to	c
Formula	c
One	c
)	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
send	c
you	c
all	c
my	c
positive	c
energy	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
receiving	c
your	c
letter	i
back	i

all	c

To	c
:	c

From	c
:	c

I	c
spent	c
two	c
days	c
at	c
annual	i
international	c
arts	c
festival	c
from	c
21	c
to	c
22	c
of	c
November	c
.	c

There	c
was	c
an	c
excellent	c
jazz	c
concert	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
notice	i
that	c
a	i
dance	c
show	c
was	c
absolutelly	i
marvelous	i
.	c

From	c
my	c
point	c
of	c
view	c
I	c
can	c
complain	c
only	c
on	i
a	i
small	c
concert	c
hall	c
and	c
there	i
were	c
artist	i
from	c
only	c
six	c
countries	c
.	c

You	c
wrote	c
an	c
advertisment	i
that	i
people	c
from	c
more	c
than	c
15	c
deferent	i
countries	c
were	c
going	c
to	c
visit	c
this	c
concert	c
,	c
but	c
there	c
were	c
artists	c
only	i
from	i
6	c
countries	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
relly	i
pity	i
because	c
I	c
expected	c
to	c
see	c
artists	c
from	c
France	c
and	c
Italy	c
.	c

The	c
International	c
Arts	c
Festival	c
was	c
organised	c
quite	c
well	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
only	c
recomended	i
you	c
to	i
have	i
more	c
artists	c
and	c
a	i
classical	c
concert	c
should	c
be	c
in	c
bigger	i
hall	c
than	i
it	i
was	i
.	c

One	c
man	c
and	c
one	c
woman	c
lived	c
in	c
small	i
house	c
beside	c
the	c
sea	c
.	c

One	c
day	c
Ivan	c
caught	c
a	c
fish	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
n't	c
usual	i
fish	c
,	i
it	i
was	c
Gold	i
Fish	c
and	c
it	c
asked	i
him	c
as	i
human	i
;	i
'	c
Please	c
,	c
let	c
me	c
go	c
and	c
I	c
can	c
do	c
for	i
you	i
anything	i
you	i
want	i
'	c
.	c

She	c
was	c
angry	c
and	c
she	c
said	c
that	c
Ivan	c
was	c
just	c
foolish	i
man	c
.	c

She	c
persuide	i
him	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
sea	c
to	c
ask	c
a	i
lot	c
of	c
things	c
for	c
her	c
.	c

Ivan	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
what	c
she	c
said	c
.	c

When	c
he	c
come	i
back	c
home	c
,	c
he	c
was	c
surprise	i
because	c
Maria	c
was	c
more	c
angry	c
than	c
before	c
.	c

She	c
said	c
that	c
it	i
was	i
n't	i
enough	i
what	i
Gold	i
Fish	i
had	i
done	i
for	i
her	i
.	c

Ivan	c
had	c
to	c
beg	c
Gold	c
Fish	c
again	c
and	c
again	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
end	c
,	c
greedy	c
Maria	c
wanted	c
impossible	c
thing	i
.	c

Maria	c
wanted	c
too	c
much	c
and	c
Gold	c
Fish	c
returned	i
everything	i
at	i
the	i
beginning	i
.	c

Maria	c
and	c
Ivan	c
were	c
again	i
poor	i
.	c

This	c
story	c
happened	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
ago	c
.	c

...	c

I	c
am	i
working	i
as	c
an	c
actor	c
for	c
The	c
Spanish	c
Royal	c
Theatre	c
.	c

Sunday	c
night	c
we	c
went	c
to	c
your	c
theatre	c
.	c

We	c
tried	c
to	c
complain	c
but	c
the	c
girl	c
at	c
the	c
tickets	i
desk	c
was	c
very	c
unpolite	i
.	c

However	c
,	c
we	c
decided	c
to	c
get	i
into	i
the	c
show	c
.	c

You	c
can	c
imagine	c
how	i
were	i
our	i
faces	i
like	i
when	c
we	c
saw	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
Danny	c
,	c
but	c
Peter	c
Fox	c
,	c
who	c
was	c
on	c
the	c
stage	c
.	c

Nevertheless	c
we	c
decided	c
to	c
stay	c
there	i
till	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
the	c
show	c
and	c
to	c
take	i
dinner	c
in	c
your	c
restaurant	c
,	c
where	c
we	c
were	c
supposed	c
to	c
meet	c
some	c
friends	c
;	c
friends	c
that	c
we	c
never	c
met	c
because	c
your	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
when	c
we	c
got	c
out	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
sure	c
that	c
the	c
restaurant	c
closed	c
at	c
its	c
closing-hour	i
but	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
remember	c
that	c
the	c
show	c
began	c
45	c
minutes	c
late	c
.	c

As	i
you	i
can	i
read	i
it	c
was	c
not	c
our	c
"	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
"	c
at	c
all	c
.	c

Technology	c
makes	c
easier	i
the	i
work	i
at	i
home	i

I	c
ca	c
n't	c
imagine	c
how	c
my	c
life	c
would	c
be	c
without	c
a	c
washing	c
machine	c
,	c
a	c
drier	c
or	c
a	c
fridge	c

Technology	c
has	c
also	c
been	c
a	c
great	c
help	c
in	c
my	c
everyday	c
work	c
.	c

Also	c
,	c
the	c
e-mail	c
system	c
is	c
really	c
hepful	i
.	c

Thanks	c
to	c
the	c
advance	i
of	c
Internet	i
I	c
can	c
contact	c
lots	c
of	c
colleagues	c
all	c
around	c
the	c
world	c
everyday	i
(	c
and	c
with	c
the	c
minimum	c
cost	c
)	c
.	c

But	c
,	c
on	i
my	i
opinion	i
,	c
the	c
best	c
thing	c
is	c
that	c
I	c
can	c
stay	c
at	c
home	c
or	c
going	i
on	c
holidays	i
,	c
and	c
send	c
my	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Ryan	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
answer	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
because	c
I	c
used	c
to	c
go	c
camping	c
and	c
stay	c
in	c
the	i
tent	c
.	c

Therefore	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
try	i
some	i
kind	i
of	i
experience	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
interested	c
in	c
tennis	c
but	c
I	c
am	c
not	c
so	c
good	c
tennis	i
player	c
.	c

However	c
I	i
would	c
like	c
to	c
attend	i
tennis	i
activity	i
.	c

In	c
addition	c
swimming	c
would	c
be	c
good	i
activity	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

While	c
I	c
was	c
studying	c
at	c
the	c
high	c
school	c
and	c
the	c
university	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
in	c
the	c
swimming	c
team	c
of	i
the	i
school	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
about	c
clothes	c
and	c
the	i
money	c
.	c

Could	c
you	c
tell	c
me	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
should	c
bring	c
?	c

When	c
people	c
hear	c
this	c
word	c
shopping	c
they	c
only	c
think	c
about	c
to	i
go	i
some	i
stores	c
and	c
try	i
new	i
clothes	c
or	c
shoes	c
and	c
search	i
for	c
their	c
size	c
and	c
so	c
on	c
.	c

They	c
do	c
n't	c
think	c
about	c
other	c
kind	i
of	c
shopping	c
which	c
are	c
liked	i
by	i
themselves	i
.	c

Maybe	c
they	c
like	c
shopping	c
on	c
internet	i
or	c
window	c
shopping	c
does	i
n't	c
matter	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
shopping	c
they	c
like	c
.	c

Theater	i

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complaint	i
about	c
a	c
very	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
I	c
recently	c
had	c
during	c
a	c
week	c
's	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

My	c
girlfriend	c
and	c
I	c
read	c
an	c
advertisement	c
about	i
the	c
show	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
which	i
is	c
very	c
popular	c
.	c

When	c
we	c
asked	c
for	c
discounts	i
tickets	c
,	c
we	c
were	c
said	i
there	c
never	c
were	c
discount	c
offers	c
and	c
that	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
pay	c
the	i
highest	i
tickets	c
-	c
Â£	c
20	c
each	c
-	c
because	c
we	c
were	c
not	c
English	c
students	c
.	c

We	c
were	c
annoyed	c
about	c
it	c
but	c
we	c
paid	c
off	i
.	c

After	c
that	c
we	c
thought	c
we	c
could	c
have	c
a	c
drink	c
in	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
the	c
decorations	i
were	i
being	c
changed	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

How	c
interesting	c
it	c
is	c
to	c
imagine	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
people	c
will	c
wear	c
in	c
about	c
a	c
hundred	c
years	c
from	c
now	c
.	c

Fashion	c
is	c
changing	c
so	c
quickly	c
that	c
all	c
our	c
dreams	c
about	c
clothes	c
can	c
become	i
true	c
.	c

But	c
let	c
's	c
see	c
my	c
point	c
of	c
view	c
.	c

In	c
a	c
hundred	c
years	c
,	c
clothes	i
would	i
certainly	c
be	c
totally	c
differents	i
than	i
ours	c
.	c

Materials	c
,	c
textures	c
and	c
colours	c
change	c
,	c
and	c
are	i
minds	c
too	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
think	c
people	c
will	c
wear	c
clothes	c
made	c
of	c
recycled	c
things	c
,	c
like	c
bottles	i
of	i
aluminium	i
.	c

And	c
I	c
hope	c
colours	c
wo	c
n't	c
be	c
dark	c
and	c
sad	c
but	c
very	c
bright	c
and	c
enjoyable	c
to	c
see	c
.	c

But	c
maybe	c
the	c
shape	c
of	c
the	c
clothes	c
will	c
changed	i
:	c
large	c
pants	i
as	i
"	i
baggy	i
"	i
,	c
or	c
trousers	c
with	c
many	c
pockets	c
as	c
we	c
see	c
today	c
.	c

For	c
women	c
,	c
clothes	c
change	c
more	c
than	c
for	c
men	i
's	i
.	c

The	c
clothes	c
were	c
designed	c
by	c
the	c
famous	c
Jean-Paul	c
Gaultier	c
.	c

And	c
it	c
really	c
is	c
an	c
interesting	c
point	c
of	c
view	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr.	c
Clark	c
,	c

I	c
think	c
this	c
festival	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
idea	c
because	c
it	c
's	c
a	i
possibility	i
to	c
see	c
and	c
to	c
love	i
the	i
art	c
,	c
but	c
,	i
I	c
think	i
also	i
there	c
are	c
some	c
things	c
thas	i
could	c
be	c
changed	c
.	c

I	c
noticed	c
that	c
the	c
artists	c
were	c
from	c
only	c
six	c
countries	c
insted	i
that	i
from	c
around	c
the	c
world	c
.	c

This	c
choice	i
does	c
n't	c
give	c
many	c
artists	c
the	c
possibility	i
to	c
expresse	i
themself	i
.	c

There	c
were	c
many	c
events	c
that	i
I	c
think	c
there	c
were	c
a	c
few	c
plays	c
and	c
films	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
that	c
my	c
opinion	c
can	c
help	c
you	c
to	c
set	i
fro	i
the	i
next	c
year	c
a	c
great	c
internation	i
arts	c
festival	c
alone	i
to	i
young	i
people	i
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
and	c
greetings	i
.	c

I	c
think	c
a	c
good	c
way	c
to	c
get	c
money	c
it	i
's	i
work	i
in	c
a	c
fast-food	c
.	i

It	c
depends	c
on	c
what	c
you	c
need	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
work	c
in	c
a	c
fast-food	c
you	i
can	c
work	c
in	c
the	c
afternoon	c
,	c
or	c
during	c
the	c
night	c
and	i
so	c
you	c
have	c
time	c
for	c
yourself	c
.	c

In	i
the	c
staff	c
you	c
can	c
also	c
find	c
young	c
people	c
and	c
getting	i
fun	c
with	c
them	c
during	c
the	i
work	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
need	c
money	c
and	c
you	c
need	c
time	c
for	c
yourself	c
try	c
a	c
job	c
like	c
that	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
because	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
The	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
some	c
days	c
ago	c
and	c
I	c
regret	c
to	c
inform	c
you	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
a	c
good	c
experience	c
.	c

According	c
to	c
the	c
advertisement	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
was	c
the	c
male	c
actor	c
.	c

However	c
he	i
did	c
not	c
act	c
,	c
and	c
his	c
sustitute	i
was	c
not	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
acting	c
.	c

Secondly	c
I	c
had	c
problems	c
with	c
both	c
tickets	c
and	c
time	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
I	c
could	c
not	c
get	c
a	c
discount	c
although	c
I	c
think	c
I	c
was	c
entitled	c
to	c
it	c

Best	c
Detective	c
Stories	c
of	c
Agatha	c
Christie	c
(	c
Accident	c
)	c

Now	c
I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
because	c
a	c
story	c
of	i
Agatha	c
Christie	c
is	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
read	c
on	c
the	c
radio	c
.	c

Its	c
title	c
is	c
"	c
Accident	c
"	c

I	c
know	c
you	c
are	c
interested	c
in	c
the	c
author	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
you	c
'll	c
like	c
the	c
story	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
sure	c
you	c
'll	c
agree	c
with	c
me	c
.	c

Not	c
only	c
is	c
the	c
plot	c
interesting	c
but	c
also	c
it	c
catchs	i
your	c
attention	i
since	i
the	c
first	c
moment	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
you	c
should	c
pay	c
attention	c
to	c
the	c
ending	c
which	i
is	c
surprising	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

I	i
've	i
recently	i
visited	i
London	c
for	i
holidays	i
and	c
during	c
my	c
stay	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
your	c
theatre	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
really	c
sorry	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
I	c
am	i
very	c
disappointed	c
about	i
the	c
whole	c
organisation	c
of	c
the	c
musical	c
,	c
starting	c
from	i
the	c
advertisement	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
it	c
says	c
that	c
the	c
main	c
actor	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
be	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
.	c

Another	c
thing	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
mention	c
is	c
the	c
discount	c
that	c
we	c
were	c
supposed	c
to	c
have	c
on	c
the	c
tickets	c
.	c

There	c
was	c
n't	c
any	c
discount	c
.	c

Lastly	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
inform	c
you	c
that	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
have	c
dinner	c
at	c
yor	i
restaurant	c
but	c
they	c
told	c
me	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
it	c
usually	c
closes	c
at	c
11:00	c
o'clock	c

How	c
has	c
modern	c
technology	c
changed	c
your	c
daily	c
life	c
.	i

We	c
are	c
living	c
in	c
the	c
21st	c
century	c
where	i
everybody	c
is	c
surrounded	c
by	c
advanced	c
technological	i
methods	i
.	c

Of	c
course	c
using	c
modern	c
technology	c
has	c
both	c
advantages	c
and	c
disadvantages	c
.	c

The	c
first	c
thing	c
that	c
came	c
to	c
my	c
life	c
and	c
changed	c
it	c
completely	c
is	c
the	c
computer	c
.	c

But	c
unfortunately	c
I	c
cannot	c
live	c
without	c
a	c
computer	c
.	c

And	c
not	i
only	c
the	c
computer	c
.	c

Everyday	i
I	c
use	c
the	c
microwave	c
for	c
heating	c
my	c
food	c
and	c
of	c
course	c
.	i

One	i
of	c
the	c
greatest	c
technological	c
achievements	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
afraid	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
I	c
cannot	c
live	c
without	c
my	c
mobile	c
phone	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
up	c
to	c
us	c
if	c
we	c
can	i
use	c
those	c
technological	c
achievements	c
in	c
the	c
right	c
way	c
,	c
and	c
make	c
our	c
lives	c
easier	c
.	c

The	c
only	c
thing	c
I	c
really	c
support	i
is	c
that	c
if	c
you	c
know	c
how	c
to	c
use	c
technology	c
is	i
a	c
benefit	c
for	i
you	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
is	i
going	c
to	c
destroy	c
you	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr.	c
Robertson	c
,	c

The	c
trip	c
that	c
you	c
planned	i
for	c
us	c
,	i
students	c
,	i
it	i
's	i
a	c
great	c
chance	c
to	c
meet	c
new	c
people	c
and	c
visit	c
a	c
beautiful	c
city	c
like	i
London	i
.	c

We	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
because	c
the	i
kind	c
of	c
happening	i
shows	c
how	c
you	i
are	i
dedicated	i
with	i
our	c
school	c
and	c
the	c
students	c
that	c
study	c
there	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
for	c
us	c
because	c
there	c
will	c
be	c
expositions	i
of	c
the	c
latest	c
fashions	c
,	c
of	c
the	c
new	c
hairstyles	c
,	c
of	i
the	c
new	c
leisure	c
and	c

and	c

how	c
to	c
make	i

x	i

Famous	c
people	c
are	c
special	c
for	i
the	c
rest	c
of	c
the	i
society	c
.	c

They	c
form	c
opinions	c
and	c
invent	c
new	c
fashion	c
styles	c
.	c

The	c
media	c
is	c
starting	c
to	c
get	i
into	c
the	c
private	c
life	c
of	c
these	c
famous	c
people	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
important	c
to	c
respect	c
other	c
people	i
lives	c
because	c
it	i
can	c
cause	c
serious	c
problems	c
in	i
the	c
family	c
of	c
the	c
person	c
or	c
in	c
his	c
life	c
.	c

But	c
if	c
the	c
politicians	c
or	c
the	c
film	c
stars	c
ask	c
for	c
privacity	i
the	c
media	c
has	c
to	c
respect	c

Everybody	c
likes	c
to	c
be	c
with	c
your	i
family	c
without	c
any	c
reporter	c
or	c
photographer	c
.	i

In	c
summary	c
,	c
the	c
best	c
thing	c
to	c
do	c
is	c
try	c
to	c
extract	c
from	c
these	c
people	c
their	c
best	c
qualities	c
and	c
not	c
try	c
to	c
find	c
things	c
that	c
could	c
irritate	c
them	c
like	c
familiar	i
problems	c
or	c
personal	c
problems	c
.	c

They	c
deserve	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
private	c
life	c
like	c
any	c
common	i
person	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
you	i
to	c
show	i
my	c
disagree	i
about	i
the	c
musical	c
show	c
'	c
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
.	c

First	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
dissapointed	i
with	i
the	c
starring	i
.	c

Instead	c
of	c
him	c
,	c
there	c
was	c
an	c
unknown	c
actor	c
,	c
who	c
I	c
dislike	c
.	c

Also	c
,	c
the	c
musical	c
did	c
not	c
start	c
at	c
19.30	c
,	c
it	c
started	c
forty-five	c
minutes	c
later	c
.	c

That	c
is	c
why	c
,	c
it	i
finished	c
later	c
and	i
I	c
arrived	c
late	c
to	c
a	c
basketball	c
match	i
.	c

Another	c
thing	c
is	c
that	c
there	c
were	c
not	c
any	c
discounts	c
in	i
the	c
entrance	c
fee	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
sunday	i
.	c

It	c
is	c
closed	c
all	i
sundays	i
,	i
you	c
have	c
to	c
say	c
it	i
.	c

That	c
is	c
why	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
pleased	c
if	c
you	c
give	c
my	i
money	c
back	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

That	c
's	c
why	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
want	c
to	c
tell	c
him	c
that	c
I	c
had	c
failed	c
my	c
natural	c
science	c
final	c
exam	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
worried	c
because	c
if	c
my	c
parents	c
knew	c
that	c
I	c
had	c
failed	c
,	c
before	c
we	c
were	c
on	c
holidays	i
,	c
they	c
will	i
cancelled	i
the	c
trip	c
to	c
Africa	c
.	c

But	c
,	c
I	c
need	i
to	c
say	i
it	i
to	i
someone	i
,	c
so	c
I	c
told	i
it	i
to	i
Pat	i
.	c

I	c
was	c
n't	c
too	c
worried	c
because	c
if	c
someones	i
is	i
going	c
to	c
see	c
my	c
parents	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
tell	c
them	c
before	c
not	c
talk	i
about	c
the	c
exams	c
.	c

But	c
,	c
when	i
my	c
mother	c
was	i
talking	i
with	i
Pat	c
's	c
mother	c
and	c
she	c
mentioned	c
it	c
,	c
my	i
mother	c
cancelled	c
the	c
trip	c
to	c
Africa	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
n't	c
Pat	i
fault	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
my	c
fault	c
because	c
I	c
was	c
the	c
one	c
who	c
failed	c
the	c
exam	c
and	c
also	i
,	c
I	c
knew	c
that	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

The	c
International	c
Arts	c
Festival	c
was	c
very	c
interesting	c
including	c
the	c
fact	c
that	c
Stars	c
and	c
artists	c
had	c
also	c
come	c
from	c
around	c
the	c
world	c
.	c

I	c
enjoyed	c
it	c
tremendously	c
.	c

Later	c
I	c
found	c
out	c
that	c
the	c
stars	c
and	c
artists	c
had	c
only	c
come	c
from	c
six	c
countries	c
.	c

They	c
were	c
very	c
small	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
pushed	c
by	c
everyone	c
.	c

There	c
were	c
wonderful	c
plays	c
and	c
films	c
which	c
I	c
hope	c
that	i
there	c
would	i
have	i
been	i
more	c
.	i

I	c
thought	c
it	c
was	c
worthwhile	c
to	c
have	c
spent	c
two	c
days	c
in	i
the	c
Arts	c
Festival	c
at	i
the	c
end	c
.	c

Yours	c
Sincerely	c

By	c
that	c
time	c
the	c
widow	c
could	c
not	c
walk	c
and	c
the	c
widower	c
could	c
not	c
see	c
.	c

When	c
the	c
widower	c
sensed	c
that	c
the	c
widow	c
badly	c
wanted	c
to	c
go	c
,	c
the	c
widow	c
clung	c
on	c
the	c
widower	c
's	c
back	c
and	c
set	c
off	c
telling	c
him	c
where	c
to	c
go	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
way	c
they	c
were	c
thirsty	c
so	c
when	c
they	c
looked	c
into	c
the	c
lake	c
,	c
they	c
saw	c
a	c
long	c
bar	c
of	c
gold	c
.	c

They	c
kept	c
going	c
on	c
until	c
they	c
met	c
a	c
fat	c
,	c
small	c
man	c
.	c

He	c
came	c
and	c
said	c
to	c
the	c
widower	c
that	c
he	c
was	c
to	c
bring	i
him	c
on	c
his	c
back	c
.	c

He	c
was	c
just	c
able	c
to	c
kill	c
it	c
by	c
cutting	c
the	c
snake	c
into	i
half	c
by	c
using	c
his	c
knife	c
which	c
was	c
as	c
sharp	c
as	c
a	c
sickle	c
.	c

The	c
man	c
went	c
back	c
to	c
the	c
widower	c
and	c
kicked	c
him	c
.	c

This	c
story	c
happened	c
a	c
long	c
time	c

I	c
'M	c
WRITING	c
TO	c
YOU	c
TO	c
EXPLAIN	i
MY	c
DESAGREABLE	i
EXPERIENCE	c
IN	c
YOUR	c
THEATRE	c
THE	i
LAST	c
SATURDAY	c

IN	i
YOUR	c

FIRST	c
OF	c
ALL	c
,	c
I	c
WANT	c
YOU	c
KNOW	i
THAT	c
THIS	c
SATURDAY	c
WAS	c
MY	c
HUSBAND	c
'S	c
BIRTHDAY	c
AND	c
I	c
WAS	c
PLANNING	c
THIS	c
DAY	c
DURING	i
ONE	c
MONTH	c
.	c

MY	c
INTENTION	c
WAS	c
TO	c
SPEND	i
AN	i
SPECIAL	c
NIGHT	c
WITH	c
HIM	c
.	c

AND	c
IT	c
WAS	c
REALLY	c
SPECIAL	c
!	c
!	c
!	c

YOUR	c
SHOW	c
STARTED	c
ALMOST	c
ONE	c
HOUR	c
LATER	i
AND	c
WITH	i
ANY	c
DISCOUNT	c
FOR	c
US	c
ON	c
THE	c
ENTRY	i
.	c

BUT	c
IT	i
WAS	c
N'T	c
THE	c
WORSE	i
,	c
BECAUSE	c
I	c
CAN	c
UNDERSTAND	c
THE	c
TROUBLES	c
TO	i
PLAY	i
ON	i
THE	c
THEATRE	c

BUT	c
WHAT	c
CANNOT	i
I	i
FORGIVE	c
TO	i
YOUR	c
COMPANY	c
IS	c
TO	i
CHANGE	i
THE	c
START	i
AT	i
THE	i
LAST	i
MOMENT	i
,	c
MY	c
HUSBAND	c
IS	c
A	c
DANNY	c
BROOK	c
'S	c
FAN	c
AND	c
HE	c
FELT	c
REALLY	c
DISSAPOINTED	i

IT	i
IS	c
N'T	c
ALL	c
.	c

NOBODY	c
TELL	i
US	c
ANYTHING	c
ABOUT	c
THE	c

YOU	c

Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
the	c
most	c
popular	c
boy	c
in	c
the	c
school	c
.	c

He	c
was	c
shy	c
,	c
reserved	c
and	c
a	c
very	c
closed	c
person	c
.	c

He	c
enjoyed	c
himself	c
reading	c
,	c
playing	i
piano	c
at	c
home	c
.	c

She	c
explained	i
everything	i
what	i
happened	i
in	i
her	i
live	i
to	i
Pat	i
.	c

Definately	i
the	i
worse	i
.	c

He	c
started	c
to	c
"	c
sell	c
"	c
the	i
secrets	i
of	i
Anna	i
to	c
all	c
the	c
boys	c
of	i
the	c
school	c
who	c
were	c
interested	c
in	c
her	c
.	c

All	c
the	c
boys	c
of	i
the	c
class	c
went	c
to	c
Pat	c
to	c
know	i
what	c
Anna	c
was	c
doing	c
in	i
every	c
moment	c
,	c
and	c
Pat	c
was	c
becoming	c
'	c
friend	i
'	c
of	i
all	c
the	c
boys	c
.	c

Is	c
it	c
moral	c
,	i
to	c
get	c
some	c
friends	c
destroying	i
and	c
hurting	c
another	i
people	c
?	c

I	c
think	c
NO	i
!	c

And	c
you	c
?	c

My	c
name	c
is	c
Veronika	c
.	c

And	i
I	c
visited	c
your	c
theatre	c
to	c
see	c
a	c
musical	c
show	c
"	i
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
very	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
.	c

And	i
I	c
'll	c
try	c
to	c
explain	c
why	c
.	c

The	c
other	c
point	c
was	c
the	c
beginning	c
of	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

As	c
a	c
result	c
I	i
missed	c
my	c
train	c
.	c

The	c
third	c
problem	c
was	c
the	c
discounts	c
.	c

There	c
were	c
no	c
ay	i
discount	i
at	c
all	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
student	c
and	c
I	c
know	c
that	c
I	c
can	c
get	c
tickets	c
with	c
the	i
discount	c
.	c

And	c
the	c
last	c
disappointment	c
was	c
your	c
restaurant	i
after	i
the	c
show	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
lack	c
of	c
stuth	i

So	c
as	i
a	i
conclusion	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
one	c
piece	c
of	c
advice	c
-	c
try	c
to	c
organise	c
your	c
shows	c
more	c
carefully	c
.	c

How	c
has	c
modern	c
technology	c
changed	c
your	c
daily	c
life	c
?	c

We	c
know	c
that	c
everything	c
is	c
changing	c
.	c

And	c
of	c
course	c
the	i
technology	c
is	c
also	c
changing	c
.	c

Not	c
so	c
long	c
ago	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
many	c
things	c
by	c
our	i
hand	c
,	c
but	c
now	c
there	c
re	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
machines	c
to	c
do	c
the	c
same	c
.	c

And	c
it	c
makes	c
our	c
life	c
easier	c
.	c

Now	c
we	c
have	c
free	c
time	c
to	c
do	c
anything	i
else	c
,	i
while	c
machine	i
is	c
doing	c
our	c
work	c
.	c

It	i
's	i
connected	i
with	i
our	c
house	c
,	c
our	c
workplace	c
and	i
e.t.c	i
.	c

Another	c
example	c
is	c
that	c
earlier	i
we	c
had	c
to	c
rewrite	c
some	c
documents	c
by	c
hand	c
just	c
to	c
make	c
a	c
copy	c
.	c

Now	c
we	c
have	c
a	c
scanner	c
and	c
a	c
printer	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c

It	c
is	c
very	i
fantastic	c
especially	i
the	c
programme	i
on	c
13th	c
March	c
that	i
we	c
are	c
having	c
a	c
river	c
trip	c
to	c
Greenwich	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
worth	c
visiting	c
exhibition	i
and	c
we	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
there	c
.	c

The	c
show	c
is	c
established	i
on	c
Tuesday	c
March	c
14th	c
at	c
Central	i
Exhibition	c
Hall	c
London	i
from	i
10.00	c
to	c
19.00	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
hall	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
four	c
important	c
themes	c
;	c
latest	c
fashions	c
,	c
leisure	c
and	c
sports	c
wear	c
,	c
make	i
up	i
,	c
and	c
hairstyles	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
wondering	c
if	c
you	c
would	c
consider	c
our	c
suggestion	c
about	c
changing	c
the	c
programme	c
.	c

On	c
Tuesday	c
morning	c
,	c
we	c
will	c
visit	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
show	c
instead	c
of	c
visiting	c
Science	i
Museum	c
and	c
we	c
will	c
go	c
there	c
tomorrow	i
morning	c
.	c

Visiting	i
National	i
Art	c
Gallery	c
should	c
be	c
cancelled	c
because	c
it	c
has	i
a	i
similar	i
idea	i
comparing	i
to	i
the	i
programme	i
that	i
we	i
would	i
like	i
to	i
go	i
on	i
Tuesday	i
morning	i
.	c

There	c
are	c
people	c
from	c
both	c
side	i
of	c
agrument	i
who	c
have	c
strong	c
feelings	c
.	c

There	c
is	c
evidence	i
that	i
these	c
people	c
's	c
life	i
should	c
be	c
advertised	i
by	c
the	c
media	c
.	c

Obviously	c
,	c
they	c
have	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
fans	c
and	c
their	c
fans	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
what	c
happened	i
to	c
them	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
,	c
their	c
life	i
may	c
be	c
the	i
good	c
example	c
for	c
other	c
people	c
to	c
follow	c
.	c

Sometime	i
,	c
many	i
people	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
what	c
to	c
do	c
and	c
they	c
should	c
the	i
person	i
who	i
they	i
admire	i
to	i
immitate	i
.	c

However	c
,	c
there	c
is	i
other	i
disadvantages	c
that	c
we	c
should	c
consider	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
the	i
famous	c
people	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
do	c
anything	c
they	c
want	c
without	i
being	c
concentrated	i
by	c
media	i
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
is	i
annoying	c
if	c
you	c
did	c
something	c
and	c
tomorrow	c
your	c
performance	i
would	c
be	c
known	c
by	c
the	c
public	c
.	c

A	c
lot	c
of	c
people	c
try	c
to	c
be	c
like	c
people	c
who	c
they	c
admire	c
,	c
For	i
example	c
,	c
buying	c
the	c
clothes	c
that	c
famous	c
people	c
wear	c
.	c

The	c
reason	c
that	i
they	c
know	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
that	i
famous	c
people	c
wear	c
is	c
these	c
people	c
have	c
a	c
public	c
life	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
the	i
benefit	c
for	i
themselves	c
and	c
the	c
public	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
so	c
glad	c
to	c
get	c
the	c
news	c
I	c
've	c
won	c
the	c
prize	c
.	c

Many	c
thanks	c
for	c
giving	c
me	c
a	c
chance	c
to	c
stay	c
at	c
the	c
Camp	c
California	c
in	c
the	c
U.S.A	c
.	c

Because	c
I	c
'm	c
supposed	c
to	c
attend	c
an	c
English	c
course	c
in	c
Weymouth	c
,	c
England	c
until	c
June	c
and	c
then	c
I	c
'm	c
going	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
Europe	c
with	c
my	c
sister	c
who	c
came	c
from	c
my	c
country	c
4	c
weeks	c
ago	c
for	c
this	c
trip	c
.	c

We	c
are	c
planning	c
to	c
spend	c
2	c
weeks	c
travelling	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
can	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
camp	c
in	c
the	c
middle	c
of	c
the	i
July	c
.	c

And	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
.	c

I	c
've	c
had	c
unpleasant	c
experience	i
from	i
my	c
last	c
holidays	c
when	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
as	i
I	c
have	c
n't	c
stayed	c
in	c
a	c
cabin	c
,	c
I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
staying	c
in	c
a	c
cabin	c
.	c

Most	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
'm	c
so	c
happy	c
that	c
I	c
could	c
choose	c
some	c
activities	c
.	c

Both	c
of	c
them	c
are	c
my	c
favorite	i
sports	c
and	c
I	c
'm	c
quite	c
good	c
.	c

Which	i
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	i
have	c
to	c
bring	c
and	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	i
will	i
need	c
?	c

I	i
'll	i
be	c
grateful	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
send	c
me	c
further	c
information	c
.	c

Yours	i
Sincerely	i

When	c
I	c
was	c
asked	c
what	c
I	c
do	c
in	c
my	c
free	c
time	c
,	c
I	c
've	c
never	c
hesitated	c
to	c
say	c
,	c
"	c
I	c
enjoy	c
going	c
shopping.	c
"	c

I	c
thought	c
going	c
shopping	c
was	c
suitable	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

Especially	c
when	c
I	c
visit	c
somewhere	c
for	c
the	c
first	c
time	c
or	c
I	c
have	c
nothing	c
to	c
do	c
,	c
but	c
lots	c
of	c
time	c
,	c
I	c
naturally	c
and	c
automatically	c
look	c
for	c
a	c
decent	c
shopping	c
centre	c
.	c

But	c
nowadays	c
I	c
found	i
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

I	c
ca	c
n't	c
make	c
enough	c
money	c
for	c
my	c
living	c
expense	i
.	c

I	c
have	c
to	c
control	c
my	c
expenses	c
on	i
the	i
budget	i
.	c

I	c
really	c
wanted	c
to	c
buy	c
it	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
afford	c
to	c
buy	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
realised	c
that	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs.	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
refer	c
to	c
your	c
letter	c
in	c
which	c
you	c
informed	c
me	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
prise	i
in	c
the	c
competition	c
.	c

Further	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
live	i
in	c
a	c
tent	c
at	c
the	c
Camp	i
,	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
already	c
used	c
to	c
that	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
often	c
spent	i
my	c
holidays	c
in	c
tents	c
.	c

We	c
always	c
play	c
it	c
at	c
school	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
that	c
you	c
are	c
now	c
well	c
informed	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
which	i
clothes	c
and	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
should	c
bring	c
with	c
me	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
,	i
I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Your	i
sincerely	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
are	c
fine	c
.	c

You	c
know	c
,	c
last	c
month	c
I	c
helped	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
sure	c
you	c
want	c
to	c
know	c
some	c
details	c
.	c

My	c
first	c
task	c
was	c
to	c
open	c
the	c
doors	c
to	c
let	c
in	c
all	c
the	c
fans	i
of	i
Britney	i
Spears	i
.	c

I	c
stood	c
at	c
the	c
entry	i
and	c
theire	i
I	c
had	c
to	c
check	c
the	c
tickets	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
to	c
tell	c
one	c
of	c
them	c
,	i
that	c
she	c
had	c
to	c
leave	c
.	c

She	c
started	c
crying	c
.	c

Such	c
a	c
poor	c
girl	c
.	i

My	c
second	c
task	c
was	c
that	i
I	i
had	i
to	c
look	c
in	c
all	c
the	c
bags	i
of	i
the	i
fans	i
to	c
collect	i
"	c
dangerous	c
"	c
items	c
,	i
I	c
saw	c
really	c
funny	c
things	c
like	c
teeth-bruches	i
in	c
the	c
bags	c
.	c

This	c
part	c
of	c
my	c
work	c
was	c
really	c
funny	c
and	c
I	c
enjoyed	c
it	c
.	c

Summing	c
up	c
I	i
can	c
say	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
fantastic	c
day	c
,	c
because	c
Britney	c
sang	c
so	c
beautiful	i
and	c
the	c
performance	c
was	c
also	c
super	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
can	c
imagine	c
how	i
a	c
wonderful	c
day	c
it	c
was	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
,	c
on	i
the	i
name	i
of	i
all	c
my	c
English	c
class	c
,	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
the	c
opportunity	c
you	c
give	i
us	c
to	c
spend	c
three	c
days	c
in	c
London	c
,	c
but	c
also	c
to	c
suggest	c
some	c
modifications	c
in	i
the	c
programme	c
.	c

But	c
,	c
in	i
another	i
hand	i
,	c
we	c
have	c
seen	c
an	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
"	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
"	c
,	c
which	c
includes	c
a	c
range	c
of	c
different	c
stands	c
.	c

We	c
are	c
really	c
interested	c
in	c
visiting	c
this	c
unhabitual	i
show	c
and	c
the	c
main	c
advantage	c
is	c
that	c
the	i
entry	c
is	c
free	c
for	c
students	c
.	c

We	c
all	c
agree	c
that	c
we	c
have	c
enough	c
time	c
in	i
Wednesday	c
for	c
shopping	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
that	c
you	c
will	c
agree	c
with	i
this	c
suggestion	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	i

Famous	c
people	c
,	c
such	c
as	c
politicians	c
and	c
film	c
stars	c
,	c
deserve	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
private	c
life	c
without	c
journalists	c
fellowing	i
them	c
all	c
the	c
time	c

Famous	c
people	c
have	c
always	c
been	c
the	c
center	i
of	c
interest	c
for	c
number	i
of	c
people	c
.	c

Their	c
wedding	i
,	c
their	c
holiday	i
,	c
their	c
new	c
haircut	i
and	c
so	c
on	c
.	c

But	c
do	c
we	c
think	c
enough	c
about	c
the	c
right	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
private	c
life	c
?	c

If	c
we	c
do	c
n't	c
want	c
to	c
be	c
in	c
the	c
newspapers	c
,	c
we	c
do	c
n't	c
do	i
politics	c
or	c
movies	i
!	c

The	c
case	c
of	c
the	i
Princess	c
Diana	c
showed	c
how	c
this	c
problem	c
can	c
reach	c
such	i
extremities	i
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
say	c
that	c
both	c
parts	i
,	c
famous	c
people	c
and	c
journalists	c
,	c
have	c
to	c
respect	c
some	c
rules	c
.	c

As	c
public	c
people	c
,	c
stars	c
and	c
politicians	c
have	c
to	c
accord	i
some	c
time	c
to	c
their	c
public	c
but	c
fans	c
and	c
press	c
people	c
have	c
to	c
respect	c
their	c
private	c
life	c
and	c
to	c
stay	c
polite	c
and	c
respectful	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr.	c
Robertson	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
you	i
to	c
thank	c
for	i
your	c
program	i
which	c
will	i
be	i
for	i
us	i
in	i
the	c
next	c
three	c
days	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

On	i
your	i
program	i
of	i
Tuesday	c
is	c
very	c
interesting	c
.	c

Fortunately	c
,	c
there	c
is	c
the	c
London	c
fashion	c
and	c
leisure	c
show	c
which	i
is	c
held	c
once	c
a	c
year	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
because	c
we	c
will	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
learn	c
london	i
culture	c
.	c

We	c
can	c
be	c
part	c
of	c
this	c
show	c
and	c
be	c
up	c
to	c
date	c
with	c
style	c
and	c
fashion	c
.	c

The	c
admission	c
is	c
free	c
for	c
students	c
.	c

We	c
will	c
be	c
on	c
time	c
for	c
the	c
second	c
show	c
at	c
13.30	c
P.M	c
and	c
we	c
can	c
enjoy	c
the	c
show	c
until	c
19.00	c
P.M	c
.	c

I'am	i
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
your	c
opinion	c
on	i
my	c
suggestion	c
.	c

Your	i
sincerely	c
,	c

The	c
Home	c
of	c
the	c
Future	c

It	c
does	c
n't	c
mater	i
who	c
they	c
are	c
,	c
where	c
they	c
are	i
coming	i
from	c
,	c
which	i
color	i
of	i
their	i
skin	c
they	c
have	c
.	c

Home	c
is	c
institution	i
that	c
create	i
human	i
and	c
make	i
them	c
as	i
a	i
person	i
and	c
a	i
good	c
member	i
in	i
their	c
communities	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
think	c
of	c
"	c
the	c
Home	c
of	c
the	c
Future	c
"	c
.	i

I	c
want	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
home	c
which	c
is	c
built	c
with	c
a	c
new	c
material	c
.	c

Home	i
made	c
out	c
of	c
plastic	c
also	i
windows	c
made	c
out	c
of	c
plastic	c
therefore	i
we	c
can	i
have	c
our	c
home	c
for	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
.	c

We	c
have	c
more	c
time	c
to	c
stay	c
together	c
at	c
home	c
,	c
watching	c
TV	c
,	c
playing	c
games	c
,	c
etc	c
....	c
because	c
we	c
can	c
access	c
to	i
internet	i
at	c
home	i
we	i
can	c
have	c
all	c
informations	i
from	c
internet	i
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
the	c
best	c
way	i
of	c
education	c
and	c
working	c
when	c
we	c
can	c
stay	c
and	c
learn	c
or	c
work	c
from	c
home	c
.	c

We	c
have	c
more	c
time	c
for	c
the	c
family	c
who	i
need	i
mostly	i
care	c
and	c
love	c
.	c

It	i
will	c
be	c
a	c
numer	i
of	c
Developments	c
in	c
Technology	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
,	c
which	c
can	i
make	c
our	c
life	c
easier	c
to	c
live	c
but	c
what	c
should	c
remain	c
the	c
same	c
is	c
feeling	i
of	c
being	c
together	c
and	c
love	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
sure	c
they	c
are	c
all	c
very	c
grateful	c
to	c
you	c
now	c
.	c

I	c
've	c
already	c
been	c
to	c
the	c
festival	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
's	c
really	c
important	c
to	c
let	c
people	c
see	c
artists	c
from	c
all	c
over	c
the	c
world	c
.	c

I	c
also	c
think	c
the	c
places	c
you	c
have	c
chosen	c
for	c
the	c
classical	c
concerts	c
were	c
not	c
good	c
sometimes	c
,	c
some	c
of	c
the	c
halls	c
seemed	c
to	c
be	c
too	c
small	c
.	c

But	c
your	c
idea	c
about	c
the	c
weekend	c
ticket	c
is	c
just	c
excellent	c
,	c
people	c
from	c
the	c
whole	c
country	c
get	c
the	c
opportunity	c
to	c
visit	c
your	c
festival	c
and	c
see	c
all	c
the	c
events	c
you	c
are	c
offering	c
.	c

You	c
could	c
probably	c
show	c
a	c
little	i
bit	i
more	c
films	c
and	c
interviews	c
with	c
the	c
most	c
interesting	c
artists	c
.	c

Dear	c
Dave	c
,	c

Thank	c
you	c
so	c
much	c
for	c
your	c
lovely	c
letter	c
,	c
it	c
's	c
always	c
great	c
to	c
get	c
something	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Howe	i
are	c
things	c
going	c
over	c
there	c
?	c

Bu	i
the	c
way	c
,	c
are	c
you	c
allowed	c
to	c
smoke	c
in	c
the	c
school	c
?	c

We	c
're	c
not	c
allowed	c
to	c
drink	c
alcohol	c
as	c
well	c
and	c
quarrel	c
with	c
any	c
of	c
the	c
teaches	i
.	c

As	c
for	c
our	c
rules	c
at	c
home	c
,	c
it	c
's	c
always	c
different	c
and	c
depends	i
just	i
on	c
your	c
family	c
.	c

My	c
parents	c
are	c
not	c
very	c
strict	c
as	i
you	c
know	c
and	i
I	c
appreciate	c
them	c
for	c
giving	c
me	c
freedom	c
.	c

They	c
understand	c
that	c
I	c
can	c
make	c
my	c
own	c
decisions	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
know	c
they	c
will	c
never	c
leave	c
me	c
and	c
they	c
will	c
help	c
me	c
and	c
my	c
brother	c
nay	i
time	c
we	c
need	c
it	c
.	c

Therefore	c
,	c
I	c
hope	c
that	c
you	c
could	i
make	i
suitable	i
arguement	i
between	c
you	c
and	c
me	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
log	c
cabins	c
which	i
I	c
could	i
feel	c
more	i
American	c
style	c
of	c
the	i
accommodation	c
.	c

Because	c
I	c
grew	c
up	c
in	c
my	i
home	i
town	i
that	c
is	c
a	c
seaside	c
city	c
.	i

Esepically	i
,	c
it	c
is	i
really	c
good	c
for	c
my	c
healthy	i
during	i
the	i
growth	i
period	i
.	c

Photography	c
is	c
my	c
hobby	c
that	i
is	i
taken	i
in	i
my	i
spare	i
time	i
.	c

It	c
must	i
be	c
nice	c
for	i
my	i
memories	i
when	c
I	c
am	c
older	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
,	c
it	c
could	c
showed	i
people	c
how	c
nice	c
the	c
places	c
are	i
and	c
the	c
views	i
I	i
have	i
got	i
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
the	i
weather	c
in	c
California	c
.	c

Do	c
I	c
need	c
take	i
too	i
much	i
clothes	c
?	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
!	c

Shopping	i
is	i
concerned	i
that	i
people	i
exchange	i
from	i
money	i
to	i
their	i
demands	i
.	c

There	c
are	c
more	c
and	c
more	c
retailors	i
are	i
opening	c
to	i
customer	i
.	c

Therefore	c
,	c
people	c
used	i
to	i
shopping	c
weekly	c
or	c
monthly	c
.	c

It	i
seems	i
a	i
human	i
activity	i
during	i
their	i
spare	i
time	i
.	c

However	c
,	c
we	c
are	c
going	c
to	c
change	c
traditional	i
system	c
to	c
the	i
"	c
e-shopping	c
"	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
new	c
for	c
customers	i
by	i
technology	c
they	c
can	c
switch	c
on	c
the	c
computer	c
and	c
click	c
everything	c
they	c
want	c
.	c

Therefore	c
,	c
it	c
looks	i
like	i
a	i
service	i
and	c
also	i
boring	c
for	c
customer	i
.	c

I	c
think	c
most	c
of	i
gentlemen	i
dislike	c
shopping	c
.	c

They	c
are	c
always	c
waiting	c
for	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
after	i
women	c
finish	i
their	c
shopping	c
.	c

I	c
believed	i
that	c
most	c
of	i
busy	c
people	c
want	c
go	i
shopping	c
by	i
the	c
easy	i
and	i
quick	i
way	c
.	c

Because	c
they	c
do	c
n't	c
like	c
waiting	c
for	c
payment	i
and	c
waste	i
time	c
of	i
life	i
.	c

The	c
life	i
style	i
has	c
change	i
already	c
from	c
past	i
.	c

We	c
must	c
focus	c
on	c
the	c
specific	c
life	i
style	i
,	c
which	c
will	c
make	c
us	c
enjoyable	i
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
I	c
believe	c
that	c
shopping	c
only	c
waste	i
time	c
for	i
human	i
life	i
.	c

And	i
you	i
could	i
n't	i
get	i
back	i
any	i
more	i
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

I	c
have	c
recently	c
been	c
to	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
and	c
watched	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
-	c
over	i
the	i
rainbow	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
because	c
there	c
were	c
deviations	c
from	c
the	c
advertisement	c
which	c
is	i
published	c
on	i
the	c
newspaper	c
.	c

According	i
to	i
the	i
advert	i
,	i
it	i
says	i
clearly	i
that	c
discounts	c
are	c
available	c
,	c
but	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
buying	c
the	c
tickets	c
,	c
I	c
did	i
not	i
have	i
this	i
offer	i
.	c

The	c
second	c
point	c
is	c
that	c
the	c
show	c
had	i
a	i
delay	i
of	i
about	c
30	c
minutes	c
.	c

Apart	c
from	c
that	c
,	c
the	c
most	c
disappointing	c
fact	c
is	c
that	c
there	c
were	c
different	c
actors	c
instead	c
of	c
Danny	c
brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
,	c
for	i
whom	c
I	c
was	i
coming	i
.	c

I	c
am	i
not	c
really	c
satisfied	c
about	i
the	c
show	c
and	c
I	c
certainly	c
believe	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
a	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
.	c

I	c
therefore	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
compensation	i
of	c
Â£	i
30	c
which	c
I	c
spent	c
on	c
the	c
tickets	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

My	c
story	c
had	c
already	c
been	c
spread	c
out	i
the	c
next	c
day	c
.	c

Although	c
failing	c
in	c
the	c
exams	c
was	c
n't	c
really	c
a	c
big	c
deal	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
awful	c
that	c
people	c
kept	c
mentioning	c
it	c
.	c

but	i
this	i
idea	i
was	i
soon	i
be	i
put	i
off	i
since	c
I	c
noticed	c
on	i
the	c
newspaper	c
that	c
I	c
had	c
won	c
the	c
writing	c
competition	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
n't	c
believe	c
my	c
luck	c
,	i
I	c
was	i
really	i
sure	i
that	i
I	i
won	i
a	c
return	c
ticket	c
to	c
the	c
Meditarenian	i
Sea	c
.	c

During	c
the	c
trip	c
,	c
I	c
made	c
friends	c
with	c
other	c
people	c
who	c
had	c
also	c
won	c
the	c
competition	c
in	c
their	c
towns	c
.	c

They	c
were	c
so	c
kind	c
to	c
me	c
that	c
we	c
soon	c
became	c
good	c
friends	c
.	c

The	i
last	c
few	c
days	c
,	c
we	c
spent	c
our	c
time	c
on	i
sightseeing	c
and	c
shopping	c
.	c

I	c
must	c
admit	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
the	c
greatest	c
time	c
I	c
have	c
ever	c
had	c
in	c
my	c
life	c
.	c

A	c
horrible	c
thought	c
suddenly	c
came	c
into	c
my	c
mind	c
.	c

My	c
bad	c
luck	c
had	c
never	c
left	c
me	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
,	c

Last	c
week	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
week	c
's	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
,	c
where	c
I	c
have	i
n't	i
been	c
for	c
2	c
years	c
.	c

I	c
prepared	c
everything	c
for	c
my	c
family	c
and	c
wanted	c
to	c
enjoy	c
it	c
,	i
we	i
were	c
happy	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
,	c
but	c
,	c
unfortunately	c
,	c
the	i
last	i
day	i
was	i
the	i
worst	i
thing	i
we	i
have	i
got	i
,	c
which	c
was	c
your	c
musical	c
show	c
.	c

At	c
first	c
,	c
you	c
said	c
that	c
,	i
if	c
we	c
had	i
bought	i
5	c
tickets	c
,	c
we	c
would	c
have	i
had	i
a	c
discount	c
,	c
but	c
we	c
did	c
n't	c
have	i
anything	i
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
we	c
booked	c
the	i
show	c
at	c
19:30	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
,	i
what	i
's	i
wrong	c
with	c
your	c
clock	c
?	c
.	i

Thirdly	c
,	c
someone	i
on	c
stage	c
was	c
very	c
strenge	i
for	i
me	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
expected	c
to	c
see	c
"	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
"	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
.	c

The	c
last	c
one	i
,	i
we	c
wanted	c
to	c
have	c
a	i
dinner	c
in	c
your	c
restaurant	c
after	c
a	i
terrible	c
musical	c
show	c
,	c
but	c
we	c
could	c
n't	c
have	i
it	i
,	c
because	c
a	c
waiter	c
said	c
your	c
chef	c
had	c
gone	c
home	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
no	c
idea	c
what	i
your	i
business	i
is	i
,	i
I	c
have	c
never	c
seen	c
something	i
like	c
this	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

Have	c
you	c
ever	c
been	c
in	i
the	c
Countryside	c
?	c

Nowadays	c
you	c
wake	c
up	c
in	c
a	i
morning	c
,	c
go	c
to	c
school	c
or	c
work	c
by	i
the	c
sky-train	c
,	c
start	c
your	c
lessons	c
with	i
the	c
computer	c
,	c
go	c
for	i
shopping	c
in	c
a	c
store	c
which	c
has	c
an	c
air-conditioner	c
,	c
watch	c
cartoons	c
on	c
TV	c
,	c
or	c
cook	c
by	i
a	c
microwave	c
oven	c
etc.	c
Do	c
you	c
really	c
enjoy	c
it	c
?	c

Althoug	i
the	i
modern	c
technology	c
gives	c
you	c
many	c
comfortable	c
things	c
for	i
living	i
,	c
can	c
it	c
gives	i
you	c
natural	i
,	c
peace	c
and	c
fresh	c
air	c
?	c

How	i
much	c
the	i
technology	c
gives	c
to	c
you	c
,	c
it	c
take	i
from	i
you	i
more	i
.	c

Have	c
you	c
heard	c
about	c
the	c
environment	i
pollutions	i
,	c
the	c
healthy	i
problems	c
and	c
the	c
moral	c
problems	c
?	c

Let	c
me	c
express	c
how	c
disappointed	c
I	c
feel	c
at	c
this	c
particular	c
moment	c
,	c
or	c
I	c
should	c
say	c
angry	c
,	c
better	c
sad	c
.	c

As	c
I	c
am	c
specially	c
fond	c
of	c
musicals	c
,	c
I	c
even	c
travel	c
abroad	c
to	c
see	c
what	c
's	c
new	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
probably	c
one	c
of	c
the	i
most	c
devoted	c
customers	c
.	c

I	c
know	c
this	c
word	c
is	c
not	c
the	c
best	c
but	c
you	c
have	c
demostrated	i
that	c
the	c
theatre	c
can	c
be	c
just	c
as	c
cold	c
as	c
any	c
other	c
business	c
.	c

We	c
both	c
know	c
this	c
is	c
not	c
true	c
,	c
or	c
shoud	i
n't	i
be	c
.	c

There	c
was	c
no	c
reason	c
either	c
for	c
the	c
delay	c
.	c

Can	c
you	c
imagine	c
how	c
many	c
things	c
one	c
can	i
do	c
instead	c
.	c

Even	c
listening	i
some	c
music	c
to	c
help	c
us	c
take	c
it	c
easy	c
would	c
had	i
been	c
better	c
than	c
nothing	c
!	c

None	i
an	i
announcement	c
,	c
not	i
an	i
invitation	i
...	c
oh	c
,	c
yes	c
,	c
I	c
forgot	c
.	c

The	c
bar	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

Well	c
,	c
I	c
will	c
not	c
comment	c
that	i
point	c
.	c

That	c
terrible	c
place	c
definitively	i
needed	c
a	i
renewal	i
.	c

Of	c
course	c
,	c
you	c
shoud	i
make	i
a	c
refund	c
of	i
the	c
money	c
,	i
not	c
only	c
to	c
me	c
but	c
to	c
all	c
the	c
public	i
.	c

But	c
I	c
can	c
say	c
that	c
you	c
will	c
never	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
give	c
my	c
appreciation	c
for	c
your	c
theatre	c
back	c
,	c
at	c
least	c
till	i
you	c
continue	c
as	c
its	c
manager	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
almost	c
true	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
fashion	c
is	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
most	c
exciting	c
human	c
activities	c
nowadays	c
.	c

How	c
can	c
we	c
define	c
this	c
crazy	c
and	c
continuous	c
change	c
of	c
colours	c
,	c
shapes	c
,	c
patterns	c
,	c
and	c
uses	c
?	c

New	c
fabrics	c
create	c
new	c
textures	c
,	c
all	c
kind	i
of	c
accesories	i
are	c
added	c
to	c
create	c
new	c
versions	c
,	c
to	c
refresh	c
old	c
ideas	c
,	c
to	c
make	c
new	c
proposals	c
that	c
will	c
last	c
,	c
like	i
always	c
,	c
just	c
some	i
weeks	c
.	c

Fashion	c
is	c
a	c
part	c
of	c
our	c
lives	c
,	c
even	c
for	c
those	c
who	c
will	c
never	c
reconize	i
it	c
.	c

Have	c
you	c
notice	i
that	c
all	c
the	c
classic	c
gentlemen	c
wear	c
same	i
tipe	i
of	c
suit	c
?	c

I	c
am	c
sure	c
that	c
fashion	c
will	c
survive	c
for	c
ages	c
,	c
even	i
it	i
will	i
change	c
to	c
become	c
easier	c
to	c
use	c
and	c
clean	i
,	c
because	c
we	c
all	c
need	c
to	c
feel	c
a	c
part	c
of	c
our	c
society	c
,	c
comunicate	i
our	c
way	c
of	c
living	c
and	c
thinking	c
,	c
be	c
part	c
of	c
a	c
group	c
and	c
,	c
at	c
the	c
same	c
time	c
be	i
different	c

Dear	c
Mr/Mss	i

I	c
had	c
a	c
week	i
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
spend	c
my	c
last	c
evening	c
with	i
great	i
pleasure	i
,	c
however	c
it	c
was	c
the	c
worse	i
evening	c
in	c
my	c
life	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
the	c
actors	c
were	c
different	c
from	c
those	c
who	c
were	c
advertised	c
.	c

Second	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
,	c
althoug	i
I	c
read	c
that	c
it	c
started	i
at	c
19:30	c
!	c

More	i
over	i
after	i
watching	c
a	i
show	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
visit	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
,	c
it	c
really	c
disappointed	c
me	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
my	c
dream	c
to	c
see	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
,	c
so	c
it	c
is	c
still	c
my	c
dream	c
because	c
of	c
your	c
show	c
.	c

Fifty	c
years	c
ago	c
people	c
even	i
did	i
n't	i
think	c
that	c
after	c
2000	c
years	c
they	c
would	c
have	c
another	c
life	c
.	c

When	c
Thomas	c
Adison	c
invented	c
an	i
electric	c
light	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
the	c
greatest	c
invention	c
for	c
people	c
of	c
that	c
centure	i
.	c

I	c
mean	c
,	c
almost	c
everyone	c
has	i
now	i
a	c
car	c
,	c
a	c
computer	c
,	c
a	c
mobil	i
phone	c
and	c
even	c
an	c
airplane	c
.	c

Coocking	i
became	i
faster	c
with	c
the	c
help	c
of	c
the	c
microwave	c
.	c

Further	i
more	i
,	c
yesterday	c
I	i
've	i
heard	i
that	c
every	c
man	c
could	c
fly	c
to	i
the	i
space	c
without	c
any	c
experience	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
great	c
,	c
from	c
my	c
point	c
of	c
view	c
in	i
2050	i
year	i
everybody	c
will	c
fly	c
to	i
the	i
space	c
.	c

He	i
become	c
lazy	c
because	c
they	c
know	c
that	c
they	c
can	c
seat	i
on	c
the	c
sofa	c
and	c
turn	i
the	c
chances	i
on	c
the	c
TV	c
by	c
pressing	c
a	c
boton	i
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
:	c

-	c
Danny	c
brook	c
did	c
not	c
play	i
and	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
see	c
him	c
.	c

-	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
and	c
not	c
at	c
19.30	c
.	c

Please	c
check	c
your	c
times	c
because	c
many	c
people	c
had	c
to	c
leave	c
at	i
the	c
middle	c
of	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

-	c
When	c
the	c
musical	c
finished	c
I	c
was	c
terrible	i
hungry	c
so	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
have	c
something	c
to	c
eat	c
but	c
the	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
and	c
the	c
advertisiment	i
said	c
that	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
open	c
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
that	i
evening	c
was	c
not	c
"	c
my	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
"	c
so	c
I	c
want	c
you	c
to	c
refund	c
me	i
the	i
money	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
your	c
reply	c
.	c

Yours	c
Faithfully	c

In	i
on	i
hand	i
we	c
have	c
the	c
advantages	c
the	i
new	c
technology	c
permits	i
you	c
many	i
things	c
like	c
fly	i
,	c
see	i
in	c
the	c
dark	c
,	c
or	c
even	i
save	c
your	c
life	c
when	c
you	c
are	c
almost	c
dead	c

But	c
in	i
the	i
other	i
hand	i
we	c
have	c
the	c
disadvantages	c
.	c

The	i
technology	i
makes	c
your	c
life	c
easier	c
but	c
,	i
until	i
when	i
?	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
the	c
car	c
was	c
developed	c
by	i
the	i
modern	c
technology	c
,	i
it	i
makes	c
your	c
life	c
easier	c
but	c
also	c
"	i
dangerous	c
"	c
.	c

To	c
summarize	c
,	c
the	c
modern	c
technologies	c
give	c
and	i
permit	i
you	c
may	i
things	c
wich	i
would	c
be	c
impossible	c
in	c
other	i
times	i
but	c
also	c
gives	i
you	i
many	c
problems	c
.	c

Dear	c
Manager	c
,	c

As	i
for	i
the	i
"	c
Over	c
The	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
presented	i
by	i
your	c
theatre	c
last	c
night	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
inform	c
you	c
of	c
the	c
following	c
problems	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
you	c
should	c
have	c
informed	c
us	c
of	c
changing	i
starring	i
before	c
starting	c
of	i
the	c
show	c
.	c

The	c
Ad	i
.	i

says	c
that	c
TICKETS	i
:	i
Discounts	i
Available	i
.	c

Lastly	c
,	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
had	i
been	i
closed	i
already	i
when	c
the	c
show	c
was	i
finished	i
,	c
because	c
the	c
time	i
of	i
begining	i
of	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
late	c
.	c

There	c
are	c
lots	c
of	c
reasons	c
why	c
I	c
was	c
so	c
disappointed	c
,	c
and	c
could	c
not	c
enjoy	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
you	c
see	c
!	c
!	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

She	c
told	i
about	i
our	i
plan	i
,	i
indeed	i
our	i
"	i
secret	i
plan	i
"	i
,	i
to	i
Sally	i
!	c

It	c
should	c
have	c
been	c
"	c
surprising	c
"	c
.	c

Considering	c
her	c
loneliness	c
,	c
we	c
made	c
every	c
effort	c
to	c
please	c
her	c
and	c
to	c
encourage	c
her	c
;	c
because	c
she	c
was	c
loved	c
by	c
everybody	c
for	c
her	c
gentle	c
,	c
kind	c
and	c
lovely	c
character	c
.	c

Her	c
parents	c
already	i
died	i
when	c
she	c
was	c
in	c
the	i
high-school	i
.	c

In	c
spite	c
of	c
such	c
difficulties	c
,	c
she	c
always	c
shows	i
a	c
pretty	c
charming	i
smile	c
to	i
us	c
.	c

On	c
June	c
2	c
,	c
because	c
of	c
Pat	c
's	c
fault	i
,	c
Sally	c
already	c
knew	c
our	c
plan	c
.	c

"	c
Good	c
Evening	c
!	c
"	c

You	c
came	c
back	c
for	c
me	c
!	c

I	c
never	i
forget	i
her	c
happy	c
face	c
.	c

....	c

We	c
spent	i
a	c
brilliant	c
night	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
show	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
"	c
taking	i
part	i
the	i
15th	c
of	c
June	c

There	c
is	i
saw	c
the	c
advertisement	c
for	c
this	c
show	c
and	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
go	c
there	i
.	c

This	c
was	c
not	c
the	c
worst	c
thing	c
because	c
when	c
I	c
arrived	c
at	c
the	c
theatre	c
I	c
was	i
waiting	i
fourty	i
five	i
minutes	c
because	c
the	c
show	c
should	c
start	c
at	c
19:30	c
and	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
.	c

When	c
it	c
finished	c
I	i
arrived	i
at	i
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
they	c
are	c
going	c
to	c
do	i
a	c
new	c
better	i
restaurant	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
you	c
should	c
refuse	i
my	c
money	c
because	c
the	c
evening	c
and	c
the	c
show	c
were	c
so	c
terrible	c
.	c

Your	i
faithfully	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

No	c
one	c
know	i
it	c
else	i
her	c
.	c

The	i
thursday	i
Sally	c
phoned	c
me	c
,	c
because	c
we	c
are	c
also	c
friends	c
,	c
but	c
she	c
did	c
not	c
tell	c
me	c
anything	c
about	c
Paul	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
terrible	c
!	c
!	c

When	c
Sally	c
came	c
out	c
the	i
dyscotheque	i
I	c
was	c
very	c
nervous	i
and	c
I	c
started	c
to	c
shout	c
her	i
.	c

She	c
hit	c
me	c
and	c
I	c
decided	c
in	i
this	i
moment	i
that	c
I	c
never	i
should	i
speak	c
with	i
her	c
.	i

Now	c
we	c
are	c
friends	c
but	c
I	c
know	c
that	c
I	c
can	i
not	i
tell	c
her	c

secret	i
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
organizing	c
this	c
trip	c
to	c
London	c
,	c
and	c
for	c
taking	c
care	c
of	c
the	c
programme	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
we	c
saw	c
an	c
advertisement	c
,	c
and	c
we	c
are	c
keen	c
on	c
the	c
idea	c
of	c
going	c
to	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
.	c

It	c
will	c
take	c
place	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
March	c
14th	c
at	c
the	c
Central	c
Exhibition	c
Hall	c
,	c
from	c
10.00	c
to	c
19.00	c
.	c

Personally	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
can	i
be	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
something	c
we	c
all	c
want	c
to	c
attent	i
to	i
,	c
and	c
we	c
are	c
all	c
fond	i
of	i
the	c
latest	c
fashion	c
.	c

We	c
noticed	c
that	c
it	c
is	c
free	c
for	c
students	c
so	i
the	c
price	c
of	c
the	c
trip	c
will	c
not	c
rise	c
.	c

We	c
discussed	c
about	i
the	c
programme	c
,	c
and	c
because	c
the	c
show	c
will	c
take	c
the	c
whole	c
day	c
,	c
we	c
would	c
not	c
mind	c
going	c
to	c
the	c
Science	c
Museum	c
on	c
Wenesday	i
instead	c
of	c
having	c
free	c
time	c
all	c
afternoon	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
having	c
your	c
answer	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerelly	i

It	c
was	c
a	c
new	c
challenge	c
,	c
and	c
not	c
only	c
for	c
me	c
,	c
but	c
for	c
everyone	c
there	c
.	c

Nobody	c
thought	c
I	c
was	c
capable	c
of	c
doing	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
n't	c
sure	c
of	c
what	c
to	c
do	c
,	c
and	c
the	c
pressure	c
of	c
everyone	c
watching	c
me	c
,	i
was	c
driving	c
me	c
mad	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
listen	i
the	c
crowd	c
shouting	c
'	c
Go	c
,	c
Go	i
'	c
.	c

Only	c
few	i
more	c
seconds	c
,	c
otherwise	c
my	c
time	i
would	c
be	c
over	c
.	c

I	c
did	c
n't	c
even	c
think	c
of	c
boking	i
down	c
.	c

I	c
felt	c
an	c
enourmous	i
peace	c
.	c

Those	c
minutes	c
,	i
up	c
in	c
the	c
air	c
,	c
feeling	c
the	c
wind	c
in	c
my	c
face	c
,	c
were	c
fantastic	c
....	c

And	c
then	c
I	c
was	c
terrified	c
when	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
open	c
the	c
parachute	c
!	c

Fortunatelly	i
,	c
I	c
was	c
n't	c
alone	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
the	c
good	c
programme	c
you	c
organised	i
for	c
our	c
trip	c
to	c
London	c
.	c

But	c
we	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
suggest	i
you	i
something	i
:	c
There	i
is	c
a	c
trendy	c
event	c
about	c
the	c
latest	c
fashions	c
,	c
leisure	c
and	c
sports	c
wear	c
;	i
make	i
up	i
and	c
hairstyles	c
on	i
the	c
14th	c
of	c
March	c
.	c

I	c
have	i
almost	i
forgotten	i
to	c
mention	c
that	c
it	c
is	c
free	c
for	c
students	c
!	c

We	c
all	i
prefer	i
the	i
show	c
,	i
free	c
time	c
is	c
not	c
so	c
important	c
for	c
us	c
.	c

Please	c
think	c
about	c
this	c
and	c
give	c
us	c
an	c
answer	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	i

Dear	c
Jack	c

I	c
am	c
fine	c
but	c
quite	c
busy	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
my	c
German	c
exams	c
.	c

I	c
can	c
really	c
recommend	i
you	i
this	i
book	i
,	i
it	i
is	c
fabulous	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
also	c
a	c
suitable	c
present	c
for	c
your	c
cousin	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
.	c

One	c
story	c
is	c
about	c
ten	c
persons	i
who	c
stay	c
together	c
in	c
a	c
hotel	c
on	c
a	c
lonely	c
island	c
.	c

There	c
is	c
a	c
storm	c
and	c
they	c
can	i
not	i
leave	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
it	c
is	c
quite	c
expensive	c
,	c
Â£	c
32	c
.	c

But	c
do	c
not	c
worry	c
about	c
the	c
price	c
because	c
your	c
cousin	c
will	c
love	c
it	c
!	c

Okay	c
,	c
I	c
hope	c
to	c
have	c
news	c
from	c
you	c
very	c
soon	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
,	c

Nevertheless	c
,	c
the	c
students	c
in	c
my	c
class	c
have	c
some	c
suggestions	c
for	c
you	c
how	i
to	c
make	c
it	c
even	c
more	c
interesting	c
.	c

It	c
will	c
be	c
held	c
in	c
Central	i
Exhibition	c
Hall	c
in	c
London	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
,	c
14th	c
of	c
March	c
,	c
from	c
10.00	c
to	c
19.00	c
.	c

Certainly	c
,	c
we	c
do	c
not	c
refuse	c
to	c
take	c
part	c
in	c
other	c
activities	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
attenlion	i
and	c
understanding	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

The	c
Home	c
of	c
the	c
Future	c

Dear	c
Reader	c
,	c

I	c
have	c
decided	c
to	c
describe	c
my	c
home	c
of	c
the	c
future	c
or	c
,	c
in	c
other	c
words	c
,	c
the	c
place	c
where	c
people	c
will	c
live	c
in	c
100	c
years	c
.	c

Perhaps	c
,	c
there	c
will	c
be	c
personal	c
computers	c
,	i
which	c
will	c
control	c
every	i
thing	i
,	c
every	c
item	c
of	c
furiture	i
,	c
light	c
,	c
temperature	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
they	c
will	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
create	c
a	c
special	c
climate	c
for	c
each	c
room	c
.	c

Maybe	c
children	c
will	c
not	c
have	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
school	c
,	c
they	c
just	i
will	i
stay	c
in	c
their	c
rooms	c
and	c
study	c
from	i
computer	i
,	c
some	i
kind	c
of	c
on-line	c
education	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
possible	c
that	c
only	c
one	c
computer	c
will	c
do	c
this	i
all	i
and	c
it	c
will	c
have	c
its	c
own	c
personality	c
,	c
voice	c
,	c
eyesight.	c
.	c

This	c
will	c
be	c
your	c
home	c
,	c
another	c
member	c
of	c
your	c
family	c
and	c
your	c
house	c
or	c
flat	c
together	i

ALTHOUGH	c
THIS	c

OUT	c
THE	c
FOLLOWING	c

FIRST	c
AND	c
FOREMOST	c
,	c
IT	c
'S	c
IMPORTANT	c
TO	c
REMEMBER	c
THAT	c
TODAY	c
IT	c
IS	c
EASIER	c
TO	c
TRAVEL	c
AROUND	c

BECAUSE	c
NOWADAYS	c
THERE	c
ARE	c
LOTS	c

WAY	c
,	c
WE	c

QUICKLY	c
AND	c
SAFELY	c

SECONDLY	c

WE	c
CA	c
N'T	c

EITHER	c
THAT	c

Dear	i
Sir/Manager	i
,	c

During	c
my	c
visit	c
to	c
London	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
the	c
opportunity	c
to	c
visit	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
and	c
to	c
see	c
'	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
'	c
.	c

To	c
my	c
dismay	c
the	c
musical	c
was	c
nothing	c
compared	c
to	c
what	c
I	c
had	c
expected	c
,	c
as	c
it	c
completely	c
contradicted	c
to	i
the	c
advertisement	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
despite	c
the	c
advertisement	c
stating	c
that	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
was	c
starring	c
,	c
another	c
actor	c
was	i
starring	i
in	c
the	c
actual	c
show	c
and	c
his	c
performance	c
was	c
literally	i
horrible	c
,	c
and	c
disappointing	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
advertisement	c
,	c
it	c
said	c
that	c
discounts	c
were	c
available	c
.	c

However	c
by	i
the	c
time	c
the	c
show	c
had	c
ended	c
the	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
understand	c
my	c
disappointment	c
.	c

Yours	c
Sincerely	i
,	c

One	c
of	c
the	c
essential	c
developement	i
is	i
the	i
form	i
of	c
transportation	c
.	c

The	c
invention	c
of	c
cars	c
planes	i
,	c
trains	c
and	c
other	c
similar	c
forms	c
of	c
transportation	c
have	i
enabled	c
us	c
to	c
go	c
from	c
one	c
place	c
to	c
another	c
with	i
no	i
time	i
.	c

This	c
has	c
made	c
my	c
life	c
easier	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
I	c
feel	c
as	c
though	c
I	c
am	c
becoming	c
lazier	c
and	c
exercising	c
less	c
.	c

Another	c
significant	c
technological	c
developement	i
is	c
the	c
creation	i
of	c
electrical	c
appliances	c
.	c

There	c
are	c
many	c
indispensable	c
electrical	c
appliances	c
such	i
as	c
television	c
,	c
radio	c
,	c
fax	c
machines	c
,	c
and	c
microwaves	c
.	c

What	c
changed	c
my	c
life	c
most	c
is	i
portal	c
computers	c
.	c

They	c
are	c
particularly	c
useful	c
for	c
someone	c
like	c
me	c
who	c
travels	i
often	i
.	c

Before	c
I	c
used	c
computers	c
generally	i
,	c
It	i
took	c
so	c
much	c
time	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
looking	i
up	c
words	c
in	c
a	c
dictionary	c
and	c
looking	i
up	c
for	i
information	c
.	c

This	c
again	c
enables	c
people	c
to	c
save	c
time	c
.	c

The	i
modern	i
technology	c
helps	c
people	c
in	c
many	c
ways	c
and	c
is	c
indespensible	i
.	c

However	c
if	i
we	c
rely	c
on	c
it	c
too	c
much	c
,	c
we	c
could	c
become	c
lazy	c
and	c
apathetic	c
and	c
as	i
a	c
result	c
,	c
would	i
not	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
live	c
without	c
them	i
once	c
they	i
are	i
gone	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
,	c
which	c
will	c
be	c
the	c
only	c
month	c
for	i
me	i
to	c
go	c
.	c

Because	c
my	c
course	c
wo	c
n't	c
finish	c
until	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
June	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
will	c
have	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
the	c
college	c
to	c
get	c
ready	c
for	c
the	c
new	c
term	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
sleeping	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
is	c
funnier	i
than	c
others	i
.	i

However	i
,	c
during	c
my	c
stay	c
at	c
Camp	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
two	c
activities	c
I	c
can	c
choose	c
,	i
one	c
of	c
them	c
I	c
will	c
choose	c
Basketball	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
the	c
sport	c
I	c
play	c
most	c
,	i
I	c
and	c
my	c
friend	c
used	c
to	c
win	c
the	c
first	c
place	i
in	c
school-wide	i
match	c
when	c
we	c
was	i
in	i
school	c
.	c

And	c
the	i
other	c
one	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
painting	c
will	c
be	c
a	c
good	c
idea	c
;	c
Painting	i
is	c
one	c
of	c
my	c
hobbies	c
and	c
I	c
've	c
been	c
learning	i
it	c
since	c
I	c
was	c
5	c
years	c
old	c
and	c
now	c
I	c
'm	c
still	c
doing	c
it	c
once	i
I	c
have	c
free	i
time	c
.	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
:	c

Thanks	c
for	c
your	c
last	c
letter	c
;	c
I	c
knew	c
you	c
would	c
interested	i
at	i
my	c
experience	c
of	c
helping	c
the	i
pop	c
concert	c
last	i
time	i
,	i
now	i
I	c
tell	i
you	c
about	c
it	c
.	c

The	c
place	c
we	i
worked	c
was	c
a	c
football	c
pitch	c
;	c
we	c
spent	c
3	c
days	c
on	i
setting	c
up	c
the	c
stage	c
,	c
the	c
equitment	i
,	c
and	c
the	c
lights	c
.	c

But	c
at	i
the	c
brakes	i
and	c
after	c
work	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
chance	c
to	c
talk	c
with	c
the	c
engieners	i
,	c
and	c
I	c
leant	i
something	c
about	c
setting	c
up	c
the	c
equitment	i
.	c

The	c
fourth	c
day	c
,	c
the	c
singers	c
and	c
the	c
players	i
have	i
been	i
to	i
there	c
to	c
test	i
.	c

Then	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
chance	c
to	c
speak	c
with	c
them	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
the	c
date	i
of	c
concer	i
came	c
.	c

After	c
the	c
concer	i
finished	c
successfully	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
happier	c
than	c
ever	c
because	c
the	c
succeed	i
inclueded	i
my	c
work	c
and	c
that	c
was	c
the	c
most	c
enjoyable	c
moment	c
in	c
my	c
life	c
.	c

Anyway	c
,	c
now	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
stop	c
to	c
finish	c
my	c
homework	c

June	c
17th	c
,	c
2000	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
I	i
was	c
expecting	c
to	c
see	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
starring	i
but	c
I	c
felt	c
very	c
disappointed	c
when	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
appeared	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
saw	c
the	c
advertisement	c
of	i
the	c
show	c
it	c
was	c
written	c
that	c
the	c
show	c
will	i
started	i
at	c
a	c
half	c
past	c
seven	c
but	c
started	i
at	c
a	c
quarter	c
past	c
eight	c
.	c

When	c
the	c
show	c
finished	c
I	c
was	c
eniting	i
to	c
visit	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

So	c
because	c
of	c
this	c
horrible	c
evening	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
ask	c
for	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

Modern	c
technology	c
have	i
been	c
changing	c
the	i
human	c
life	c
since	c
the	c
first	c
many	i
was	c
born	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
wake	c
up	c
I	c
take	c
a	c
shower	c
using	c
eletricity	i
then	c
I	c
prepare	c
my	c
breakfast	c
in	c
the	c
oven	c
then	c
I	c
go	c
to	c
school	c
by	c
bus	c
,	c
when	c
I	c
arrive	c
at	c
home	c
I	c
put	c
my	c
lunch	c
in	c
the	c
microwave	c
than	i
I	c
watch	c
t.v.	i
and	c
do	c
my	c
homework	c
using	c
a	c
pen	c
,	i
when	i
I	c
come	c
back	c
from	c
jiu-jitsu	c
I	c
eat	c
something	c
that	c
was	c
cooked	c
in	c
the	c
oven	c
then	c
I	c
go	c
to	c
bed	c

About	c
a	c
millenium	i

every	i
thing	i
was	c
different	c
the	i
people	c
did	c

electricity	c
,	c
they	c
did	i
their	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
on	i
July	c
,	c
because	c
during	i
the	c
other	c
months	c
,	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
studying	c
,	c
preparing	c
myself	c
for	c
other	i
exams	c
or	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
out	i
travelling	c
somewhere	c
else	c
with	c
my	c
relatives	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
been	c
thinking	c
and	c
I	c
decided	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
tents	i
,	c
simply	c
because	c
it	c
's	c
a	c
new	c
experience	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
try	c
everything	c
new	c
.	c

For	i
the	c
two	c
activities	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
choose	c
,	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
choose	c
a	c
new	c
activitie	i
that	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
done	c
before	c
,	c
which	c
is	c
Sailing	c
,	i
so	i
I	c
am	c
a	c
totally	i
begginer	i
at	c
this	c
.	c

The	c
other	c
activitie	i
is	c
Photography	c
,	i
I	c
am	c
not	c
an	c
expert	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
know	c
how	c
to	c
use	c
a	c
camera	c
,	i
all	i
I	c
want	c
is	c
to	c
improve	c
my	c
knowledge	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
know	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
and	c
how	c
many	c
I	i
should	c
pack	c
.	c

I	c
also	c
needed	i
some	c
information	c
on	i
the	c
money	c
I	c
will	i
take	c
.	c

Do	c
you	c
have	c
any	c
kind	c
of	c
souvenirs	c
that	c
I	c
can	c
buy	c
?	c

Do	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
take	c
any	c
money	c
at	c
all	c
?	c

I	c
will	c
be	c
waiting	c
a	i
reply	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

I	c
'm	c
sorry	c
it	c
took	c
so	c
long	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
answer	c
your	c
letter	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
've	c
been	c
too	c
busy	c
with	c
my	c
school	c
,	c
papers	c
and	c
everything	c
.	c

There	c
were	c
about	c
a	c
hundred	c
people	c
that	c
wanted	c
to	c
help	c
,	c
but	c
only	c
two	c
would	c
be	c
chosen	c
.	c

When	c
they	c
said	c
my	c
name	c
,	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
believe	c
it	c
!	c

All	c
I	c
could	c
think	c
was	c
"	c
Oh	c
my	c
god	c
,	c
I	c
'm	c
gonna	c
be	c
talking	c
and	i
helping	c
the	c
most	c
famous	c
pop	c
bands	c
!	c
"	c

I	c
was	c
so	c
excited	c
that	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
believe	c
.	i

When	c
I	c
arrived	c
to	c
help	c
them	c
,	c
they	c
welcomed	c
me	c
and	c
were	c
so	c
nice	c
with	i
me	c
that	c
it	c
seemed	c
we	c
had	c
known	c
each	c
others	i
in	i
ages	c
!	c

I	c
helped	c
them	c
organizing	i
the	c
stage	c
,	c
cleaning	c
everything	c
,	c
fixing	c
what	c
was	c
broken	c
and	c
they	c
even	c
let	c
me	c
play	c
with	c
their	c
guittars	i
!	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
exactly	c
how	c
I	c
felt	c
,	i
sometimes	i
I	c
wake	c
up	c
and	c
think	c
it	c
was	c
nothing	c
but	c
a	c
dream	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
liked	c
everything	c
I	c
said	c
and	c
I	c
hope	c
an	i
answer	i
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c

Dear	c
MR	c
SMITH	c
,	c

My	c
name	c
is	c
Volencia	c
Vardez	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
services	c
that	c
you	c
are	c
offering	c
during	i
the	c
shows	c
at	c
your	c
theatre	c
.	c

Last	c
May	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
week	i
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
,	c
and	c
during	c
my	c
trip	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
buy	c
tickets	c
for	c
OVER	c
THE	c
RAINBOW	c
,	c
the	c
MUSICAL	c
SHOW	i
.	c

Danny	c
Brook	c
was	c
ill	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
put	c
some	c
money	c
aside	c
for	c
a	i
month	c
,	c
thinking	c
about	c
the	c
discount	c
,	c
but	c
when	c
I	c
want	i
to	c
buy	c
them	c
they	c
said	c
that	c
discounts	c
were	c
not	c
avaible	i
.	c

To	c
sum	i
up	i
,	c
the	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

Looking	i
for	c
your	c
repley	i
.	c

Yours	c
Faithfully	c
.	c

That	c
is	c
why	c
she	c
could	c
no	i
be	c
a	c
spy	c
.	c

When	c
she	c
was	c
a	c
girl	c
,	c
Pat	c
used	c
to	c
play	c
spies	i
and	c
detectives	i
games	c
.	c

Her	c
mother	c
gave	c
a	i
book	c
about	i
how	i
to	i
become	i
a	i
spy	i
for	i
her	i
birthday	i
.	c

When	c
she	c
finished	c
the	i
school	c
,	c
she	c
went	c
to	c
study	c
to	i
the	c
Agent	c
Trainning	i
Agency	c
where	c
she	c
learnt	c
about	c
guns	c
,	c
clues	c
,	c
agencies	c
,	c
etc.	c
She	c
was	c
the	c
best	c
student	c
they	c
have	i
ever	c
had	c
.	c

But	c
things	c
changed	c
during	c
her	c
first	c
mission	c
.	c

She	c
was	c
sended	i
to	c
New	c
York	c
to	c
discover	c
how	c
some	c
people	c
from	c
government	i
gave	c
money	c
to	c
the	c
merchants	c
because	c
they	c
want	i
to	c
build	c
a	c
Trade	c
Center	i
there	c
.	c

At	c
first	c
she	c
walked	c
around	c
the	c
bayside	i
market	c
looking	i
for	i
all	c
the	c
people	c
who	c
were	c
there	c
.	c

When	c
she	c
saw	c
a	c
man	c
,	c
different	c
for	i
the	c
rest	c
,	c
talking	c
with	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
sellers	i
.	c

Immediately	c
she	c
interrupted	c
and	c
told	c
to	i
the	c
man	c
that	c
she	c
was	c
a	c
secret	c
agent	c
.	c

Dear	c
Ms	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
pleased	c
about	c
the	c
prize	c
I	c
just	c
won	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
choosing	c
me	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
sorry	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
I	c
could	i
only	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
.	c

As	c
my	c
family	c
's	c
new	c
restaurant	c
is	c
about	c
to	c
open	c
in	c
August	c
,	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
help	c
with	c
the	c
restaurant	c
,	c
which	c
is	c
expected	c
to	c
be	c
rather	c
busy	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
live	i
in	c
log	c
cabins	c
while	c
I	c
am	c
staying	c
at	c
the	c
camp	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
bad	i
experience	c
last	c
time	c
I	c
lived	i
in	c
a	c
tent	c
.	c

As	c
for	c
selecting	c
two	c
activities	c
,	c
basketball	c
and	c
surfing	c
are	c
definitely	c
on	c
my	c
list	c
.	c

As	c
a	c
result	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
an	c
important	c
position	c
in	c
our	c
local	c
basketball	c
team	c
.	c

Surfing	c
was	c
a	c
fresh	i
sport	c
to	c
me	c
which	c
I	c
took	c
up	c
recently	c
.	c

I	c
wish	c
I	c
could	c
learn	c
more	i
so	c
that	c
I	c
could	c
enjoy	c
it	c
more	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
.	c

How	c
much	c
money	c
is	c
appropriate	i
to	c
carry	i
?	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

I	c
really	c
wish	c
you	c
were	i
there	c
with	c
me	c
at	i
that	i
one	c
of	c
the	c
exciting	c
nights	c
in	c
my	c
life	c
.	c

Now	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
wait	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
every	c
detail	c
.	c

Are	c
you	c
ready	c
?	c

And	c
I	c
was	c
initially	c
employed	c
to	c
be	c
an	c
entrance	c
assistant	c
whose	c
job	c
was	c
to	c
keep	c
the	c
queue	c
under	c
control	c
as	c
well	c
as	c
keeping	c
the	c
area	c
clean	c
.	c

A	c
few	c
minutes	c
after	c
the	c
concert	c
began	c
,	c
a	c
backstage	c
assistant	c
called	c
in	c
sick	c
who	c
was	c
responsible	c
for	c
checking	c
wether	i
everything	c
is	i
going	c
well	c
according	c
to	c
the	c
timetable	c
,	i
if	i
something	c
comes	c
up	c
,	c
she	c
should	c
inform	c
other	i
staff	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
then	c
taken	c
in	i
to	c
cover	c
her	c
job	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
n't	c
find	c
my	c
feet	c
at	c
first	c
as	c
I	c
was	c
so	c
nervous	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
given	c
lots	c
of	c
paper	c
with	c
many	c
different	c
time	i
on	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
did	c
manage	c
to	c
"	c
study	c
"	c
them	c
though	c
,	c
thanks	c
to	c
other	i
staff	c
.	c

They	c
patiently	c
explained	c
to	c
me	c
my	c
job	c
even	c
so	i
they	c
were	c
fairly	c
busy	c
themselves	c
.	c

Then	c
I	c
found	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
as	c
complicated	c
as	c
I	c
though	i
before	i
.	c

And	c
I	c
guess	c
I	c
did	c
a	c
good	c
job	c
as	c
everything	c
was	c
getting	i
on	i
quite	c
well	c
.	c

I	c
saw	c
all	c
the	c
members	c
of	c
the	c
band	c
backstage	c
,	c
how	c
did	i
they	c
change	i
their	c
make-up	c
,	c
hairstyle	c
etc.	c
They	c
were	c
even	c
talking	i
jokes	c
with	c
me	c
and	c
other	c
staff	c
.	c

All	c
in	c
all	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
once-a-lifetime	i
experience	c
.	c

According	c
to	c
your	c
advertisement	c
,	c
the	c
starrings	i
were	c
DANNY	c
BROOK	c
AND	c
TINA	c
TRUELOVE	c
.	c

They	c
were	c
all	c
sold	c
out	c
.	c

You	c
should	c
have	c
said	c
they	i
were	c
very	c
few	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
to	c
buy	c
a	c
Â£	c
20	c
ticket	c
.	c

It	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
,	c
fourty	i
five	i
minutes	c
later	i
!	c

That	c
's	c
why	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
have	c
a	i
dinner	c
at	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

It	c
had	c
already	c
closed	c
,	i
when	c
the	c
show	c
finished	c
.	c

I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
for	c
a	c
full	c
refund	c
for	c
this	c
awful	c
night	c
.	c

Could	c
you	c
give	c
me	c
a	c
satisfactory	c
reply	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c
.	i

It	c
is	c
only	c
two	c
or	c
three	c
years	c
since	c
I	c
have	i
used	i
a	c
computer	c
at	c
home	c
,	c
but	c
now	c
I	c
wonder	c
how	c
I	c
can	i
live	c
without	c
it	i
.	c

I	c
open	c
my	c
e-mail	i
box	i
every	c
night	c
.	c

Overmore	i
when	c
I	c
send	c
e-mail	c
,	c
I	c
need	i
not	i
worry	i
about	c
the	c
time	c
.	c

I	c
can	c
send	c
them	c
anytime	c
I	c
like	c
.	c

Thanks	c
to	c
modern	c
technology	c
,	c
I	c
enjoy	c
chatting	c
with	c
my	c
friend	i
in	c
other	c
countries	c
and	c
my	c
family	c
in	c
Japan	c
almost	c
every	c
day	c

Dear	c
Madam	c
,	c

Below	c
I	c
provide	c
you	c
with	c
the	c
information	c
that	c
you	c
asked	c
me	c
for	c
.	c

I	c
already	c
have	c
plans	c
for	c
my	c
holiday	c
and	c
July	c
suits	c
me	c
the	c
best	c
.	c

As	c
for	c
accomodation	i
I	i
would	c
prefer	c
log	c
cabins	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
belive	i
they	c
are	c
more	c
comfortable	c
then	i
tents	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
two	c
questions	c
.	c

Could	c
you	c
tell	c
me	c
what	c
are	i
the	i
weather	i
conditions	i
in	i
California	i
at	c
that	c
time	c
of	c
year	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
know	c
what	c
clothes	c
to	c
take	c
.	c

Will	c
I	c
be	c
given	c
any	c
pocket-money	c
or	c
do	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
bring	c
my	c

additional	c
expences	i
?	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Adalbert	c
Turnau	c

First	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
doing	i
a	c
video	c
about	c
daily	c
life	c
at	c
our	c
school	c
is	c
great	i
idea	c
.	c

Some	c
people	c
may	c
think	c
that	c
school	c
is	c
boring	c
and	c
nothing	c
interesting	c
ever	c
happens	c
there	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
that	c
after	c
seeing	c
this	c
video	c
most	c
people	c
will	c
change	c
their	c
view	c
on	c
that	c
topic	c
.	c

To	c
make	c
that	c
happen	c
,	c
we	c
have	c
to	c
find	c
some	c
interesting	c
activities	c
to	c
film	c
.	c

Below	c
are	c
my	c
suggestions	c
of	i
what	c
should	c
be	c
filmed	c
.	c

The	c
chemistry	c
lesson	c
should	c
be	c
filmed	c
because	c
we	c
do	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
interesting	c
experiments	c
there	c
.	c

The	c
computer	c
class	c
can	i
be	c
also	c
there	c
,	c
because	c
program	i
and	c
internet	c
surfing	c
is	i
quite	c
interesting	c
.	c

Martial	c
arts	c
are	c
realy	i
exciting	c
and	c
are	c
a	c
great	c
thing	c
to	c
film	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
sorry	c
of	i
writing	c
you	i
for	i
such	c
a	c
bad	c
thing	c
,	c
but	c
my	c
evening	c
at	c
your	c
theatre	c
was	c
n't	c
as	c
perfect	c
as	c
you	c
announced	i
:	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
perfect	c
at	c
all	c
!	c

I	c
was	c
pleased	c
to	i
see	i
Danny	c
Brooke	c
,	c
he	c
's	c
my	c
favourite	c
actor	c
,	c
so	c
you	c
can	c
easily	c
imagine	c
how	c
disappointed	c
I	c
was	c
when	c
I	c
saw	c
a	c
different	c
and	c
unknown	c
actor	c
on	c
the	c
scene	i
!	c

By	c
the	c
way	c
,	c
what	c
really	c
upset	c
me	c
was	c
the	c
time	i
of	i
starting	i
.	c

You	c
had	c
promised	c
discounts	c
on	c
the	c
cost	c
which	i
was	c
from	c
Â£	c
10	c
to	c
Â£	c
20	c
,	c
but	c
despite	c
my	i
thoughts	i
I	c
had	c
to	c
pay	c
Â£	c
20	c
without	c
chance	i
.	c

In	c
the	c
end	c
,	c
I	c
thought	c
I	c
could	c
enjoy	c
myself	c
visit	i
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
of	c
something	c
they	c
did	c
n't	c
explain	c
to	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
asking	c
you	c
my	i
money	c
back	c
,	c
you	c
can	c
do	c
it	c
,	c
ca	c
n't	c
you	c
?	c

Wondering	i
your	i
comprension	i

your	i
sincerely	c

As	c
I	c
see	c
it	c
,	c
the	c
Old	c
Man	c
and	c
the	c
Sea	c
is	c
a	c
really	c
exiting	i
book	c
.	c

It	c
describes	c
a	c
challenge	c
,	c
the	c
challenge	c
of	c
life	c
.	c

The	c
major	i
characther	i
is	c
the	c
old	c
man	c
who	c
has	c
to	c
fight	c
against	c
the	c
sea	c
to	c
keep	i
alive	c
.	c

It	c
could	c
be	c
his	c
last	c
adventure	c
.	c

By	c
surprise	c
he	c
comes	c
across	c
the	c
biggest	c
fish	c
he	c
has	c
ever	c
seen	c
,	c
a	c
beautiful	c
marlin	c
.	c

The	c
man	c
keeps	c
immediatly	i
in	c
contact	c
with	c
it	c
.	c

They	c
're	c
fighting	c
for	c
the	c
same	c
reason	c
with	c
the	c
same	c
strenght	i
,	c
the	c
man	c
has	c
to	c
kill	c
a	c
brother	c
,	c
as	c
he	c
calls	c
the	c
fish	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
they	c
're	c
really	c
brothers	c
,	c
they	c
feel	c
the	c
same	c
pain	c
and	c
fear	c
during	c
the	c
battle	c
.	c

When	c
the	c
old	c
man	c
won	c
the	c
fight	c
he	c
felt	c
sorry	c
but	c
pleased	c
.	c

He	c
respected	c
and	c
still	c
loves	i
it	c
.	c

Even	c
though	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
only	c
in	i
July	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
high	c
school	c
student	c
.	c

Thus	c
I	c
have	c
not	c
got	c
long	i
holiday	c
.	c

I	c
just	c
have	c
one	c
month	c
left	i
.	c

I	c
can	c
sing	c
a	i
plenty	c
of	c
songs	c
.	i

which	c
include	c
the	i
english	i
song	i
and	c
the	c
japenese	i
song	i
,	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
part-time	i
job	c
for	i
sining	i
at	c
restaurant	i
.	c

Although	c
the	i
photography	c
is	c
not	c
as	c
good	c
as	c
the	i
singing	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
interested	c
in	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
been	c
learning	i
since	i
I	c
was	c
15	c
year	i
old	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
asking	i
some	i
information	c
about	c
that	i
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
wearing	i
and	c
how	c
many	i
your	i
are	i
charge	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
,	i
sometimes	i
have	i
a	c
long	c
quare	i
or	c
a	c
mechine	i
was	i
broken	c
.	c

A	c
lot	c
of	c
circumsenses	i
will	c
have	i
been	i
happening	i
.	c

I	c
have	i
unpleased	i
experience	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
in	i
lunch	i
time	i
.	c

Everybody	c
were	i
went	i
to	c
by	i
luch	i
in	c
supermarket	i
,	i
in	i
fact	c
,	c
nobody	c
liked	i
crowe	i
and	c
quare	i
,	c
expecially	i
in	i
the	c
summer	i
time	i
.	c

I	c
was	c
quare	i
in	i
the	i
middle	i
of	i
row	i
.	c

I	c
choose	i
this	c
row	i
because	c
I	c
though	i
it	c
was	c
quicker	c
than	c
other	i
.	c

Although	i
there	i
were	i
finished	i
two	i
people	i
,	i
next	i
was	i
me	i
,	i
something	i
was	i
happened	i
.	c

Suddenly	c
the	c
customer	c
though	i
the	c
receipt	c
was	c
not	c
truth	i
,	i
she	i
did	c
not	c
buy	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
things	c
but	c
the	c
shop	c
assistant	c
did	c
not	c
make	c
mistake	i
,	i
they	i
argued	c
about	c
this	c
thing	c
.	c

Abviously	i
,	c
I	c
have	i
to	c
chance	i
other	i
row	i
.	c

I	i
was	c
long	i
quare	i
,	i
I	c
have	c
never	i
had	i

Shopping	c
would	i
be	i
enjoyable	c
,	c
if	c
you	c
were	i
good	i
luck	i

Ideas	c
to	c
improve	i
the	c
Festival	c

Dear	c
Jane	c
Clark	c
,	c

I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
International	c
Arts	c
Festival	c
and	c
saw	c
some	c
interesting	c
things	c
,	c
but	c
many	c
points	c
could	c
be	c
better	c
.	c

But	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
it	c
was	c
written	i
that	c
the	c
artists	c
were	c
from	c
all	c
the	i
world	c
and	i
I	c
saw	c
only	c
six	c
nationalities	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
the	c
classical	c
concerts	c
were	c
excellent	c
and	i
the	c
halls	c
were	c
so	c
crowded	c
that	c
nobody	c
could	c
walk	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
important	c
to	c
rent	c
bigger	c
halls	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
the	c
reasonably	i
price	c
of	c
the	c
tickets	c
for	c
the	c
weekend	c
was	c
a	c
good	c
point	c
,	c
because	c
all	c
kind	i
of	c
people	c
an	i
afford	c
to	c
buy	c
it	i
.	c

Dear	c
Andrew	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
happy	c
to	c
hearing	i
from	c
you	c
and	c
I	c
hope	c
that	c
you	c
are	c
fit	i
.	c

As	i
expected	i
,	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
talk	c
at	i
first	i
about	c
my	c
school	c
and	c
then	c
about	c
my	c
home	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
know	c
,	c
I	c
finished	c
school	c
two	c
years	c
ago	c
.	c

This	c
year	c
,	c
I	c
started	c
a	c
private	c
school	c
in	c
Dijon	c
.	c

In	c
our	c
class	c
,	c
we	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
problem	i
with	c
students	c
who	c
dislike	c
to	i
work	i
,	c
because	c
we	c
are	c
all	c
there	c
for	c
the	c
same	c
reasons	c
and	c
nobody	c
wants	c
to	c
say	i
there	c
years	i
and	c
years	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
also	c
expensive	c
and	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
afford	c
to	c
stay	c
there	c
too	c
long	c
.	c

But	c
when	c
we	c
are	c
in	i
society	i
,	c
we	c
have	c
to	c
be	c
careful	c
not	c
to	c
disturb	c
the	c
other	c
persons	i
.	c

It	c
is	c
the	c
same	c
in	c
our	c
family	i
and	i
for	i
example	c
my	i
parents	c
dislike	c
hearing	c
music	c
in	i
the	c
whole	c
house	c
or	i
that	i
I	i
let	i
dust	i
everywhere	i
.	c

I	c
hope	c
these	c
few	c
information	i
can	c
help	c
you	c
and	c
I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c

17th	c
June	c
2000	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
with	c
reference	c
to	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
musical	i
show	c
which	i
I	c
went	c
to	c
see	c
at	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
last	c
night	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
was	c
not	c
starring	c
,	c
even	c
it	i
was	c
stated	c
in	c
your	c
advertisement	c
,	i
but	c
the	c
main	c
role	c
was	c
played	c
by	c
an	c
unknown	c
actor	c
.	c

Another	c
disappointing	c
thing	c
was	c
that	c
I	c
could	c
not	c
get	c
any	i
student	c
discount	c
,	c
even	c
that	i
your	c
advertisement	c
promised	c
them	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
can	c
see	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
very	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
-	c
the	c
worst	c
one	c
during	i
my	c
week	c
's	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
therefore	c
to	c
have	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
,	c
so	c
please	c
send	c
me	c
a	c
cheque	c
for	c
Â£	c
20	c
to	c
pay	i
the	c
address	c
above	c

Fashion	c
of	c
the	c
Future	c
.	c

Every	c
season	c
we	c
can	c
see	c
arrival	i
of	c
new	c
styles	c
,	c
fabrics	c
and	c
proportions	c
.	c

Let	c
's	c
try	c
to	c
imagine	c
,	i
what	c
will	i
clothes	i
be	c
like	c
100	c
years	c
from	c
now	c
?	c

I	c
think	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
people	c
will	c
express	c
themselves	c
by	c
wearing	c
appropriate	c
clothes	c
.	c

There	c
will	c
be	c
mixture	i
of	c
styles	c
from	c
different	c
times	c
of	i
the	c
past	c
,	c
so	c
if	c
you	c
feel	c
like	c
a	c
medieval	c
princess	c
,	c
you	c
can	c
dress	c
like	c
one	c
.	c

A	i
new	i
technology	c
and	c
science	c
will	c
change	c
fabrics	c
,	c
so	c
they	c
will	c
change	c
their	c
colour	i
during	c
the	c
day	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
future	c
people	c
will	c
be	c
even	c
more	c
concerned	c
with	i
pollutions	i
and	c
harmful	c
UV-rays	c
.	c

So	c
their	c
clothes	c
will	c
have	c
built-in	c
protective	c
filters	c
to	c
help	c
them	c
keep	c
healthy	c
.	c

Fashion	i
of	c
the	c
future	c
will	c
not	c
be	c
the	c
same	c
as	c
today	c
's	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
more	c
exciting	c
and	c
fun	c
!	c

I	c
am	c
glad	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
.	c

I	c
have	i
been	i
very	c
surprised	c
winning	i
.	c

The	c
answer	c
is	c
the	c
following	c
one	c
:	c
I	c
only	i
can	i
travel	c
July	i
because	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
work	c
all	c
August	c
.	c

You	c
ask	c
me	c
if	c
I	c
prefer	c
to	c
sleep	c
in	c
tents	c
or	c
log	c
cabins	c
.	c

I	c
prefer	c
the	c
tents	c
because	c
I	c
never	c
use	c
such	i
kind	c
of	c
accommodation	c
.	c

First	i
one	c
is	c
Tennis	i
and	c
second	i
one	c
is	c
sailing	c
.	c

I	c
played	i
tennis	c
for	c
many	c
years	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
even	c
done	i
competitions	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
two	c
questions	c
.	c

How	c
much	c
money	c
do	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
with	c
me	c
for	c
these	c
two	c
weeks	c
and	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
do	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
bring	c
with	c
me	c
?	c

I	c
'll	c
be	c
very	c
happy	c
to	c
see	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerly	i

DUTEIL	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
because	c
of	c
different	c
problems	c
.	c

Sometimes	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
go	c
far	c
away	c
from	c
home	c
to	c
do	c
your	c
shopping	c
and	c
it	c
takes	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
time	c
.	c

The	c
second	c
thing	c
is	c
that	c
you	c
need	c
to	c
go	c
shopping	c
when	c
the	c
supermarkets	c
are	c
open	c
.	c

Everybody	c
do	i
their	c
shopping	c
at	c
the	c
same	c
moment	i
and	c
often	c
in	c
the	c
same	c
place	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
almost	c
a	c
battle	c
to	c
buy	c
different	c
things	c
and	c
to	i
go	i
paying	i
those	i
things	c
.	c

People	c
are	c
often	c
nervous	i
and	c
agressive	i
.	c

Sometimes	c
you	c
can	c
see	c
fights	c
between	c
two	c
men	c
or	c
women	c
.	c

When	c
you	c
are	c
a	c
man	c
and	c
your	c
wife	c
asks	c
you	c
to	c
come	i
for	i
shopping	c
,	c
be	c
patient	c
!	c

Because	c
women	c
loves	i
shopping	c
and	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
follow	c
them	c
everywhere	c
and	c
always	c
giving	i
your	c
opinion	c
about	c
clothes	c
,	c
music	c
,	c
parfums	i
...	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
:	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
the	c
information	c
it	i
was	c
ask	i
in	c
the	c
letter	c
you	c
had	i
sent	i
me	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
the	c
best	c
date	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
travel	c
will	c
be	c
the	i
second	c
week	c
of	c
July	c
because	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
very	c
busy	c
in	i
any	c
other	c
date	i
for	c
reasons	i
of	i
work	i
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
the	c
two	c
activities	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
do	c
while	c
I	c
am	c
camping	c
are	c
Singing	c
and	c
Basketball	c
.	c

The	c
first	c
one	c
because	c
I	c
think	c
I	c
am	c
good	c
at	c
it	c
and	c
also	c
I	c
love	c
singing	c
loudly	c
with	c
other	c
people	c
.	c

The	c
last	c
one	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
tried	c
it	i
but	c
I	c
think	c
I	c
can	i
do	i
it	c
well	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
tall	c
and	c
that	c
could	c
make	c
things	c
easier	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
if	c
I	c
must	c
take	c
some	c
money	c
and	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
will	c
need	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
very	c
sorry	c
I	c
have	c
n't	c
written	c
you	i
for	c
such	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
but	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
make	c
a	c
travel	i
to	c
my	c
parents	i
house	c
because	c
my	c
mother	c
was	i
operated	i
on	i
;	c
do	c
n't	c
worry	c
she	i
is	c
all	c
right	c
now	c
.	c

Last	c
month	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
help	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
where	c
Rolling	c
Stones	c
were	c
playing	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
wonderful	c
experience	c
but	c
at	c
the	c
same	c
time	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
work	c
very	c
hard	c
.	c

The	c
things	c
I	c
did	c
were	c
:	c
Prepearing	i
and	c
controling	i
the	c
equipment	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
clean	c
all	c
the	c
stadium	c
,	c
make	i
sure	c
that	c
all	c
the	c
lights	c
were	c
in	c
perfect	c
condition	i
,	c
that	c
the	c
singers	c
were	c
confortable	i
and	c
relaxed	c
,	c
etc	c
.	c

The	c
most	c
exciting	c
thing	c
was	c
talking	c
with	c
the	c
band	c
,	c
asking	i
questions	i
to	i
them	i
and	c
of	c
course	c
listening	c
the	i
music	c
and	c
enjoying	c
the	c
incredible	c
show	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
the	c
most	c
exciting	c
experience	c
I	c
've	c
ever	c
had	c
in	c
my	c
life	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
as	c
a	c
reply	c
for	i
your	c
letter	c
,	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
say	c
,	c
that	c
I	c
can	c
only	c
go	c
on	c
this	c
camp	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
a	c
full-time	c
job	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
essential	c
not	c
to	c
leave	c
it	c
for	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
.	c

In	c
July	c
I	c
can	c
make	c
an	c
exception	c
.	c

According	i
to	i
accomodation	i
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
log	c
cabins	c
,	c
as	c
they	c
are	c
more	c
comfortable	c
and	c
I	c
like	c
convenience	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
mind	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
some	c
vital	c
questions	c
.	c

Do	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
warm	c
clothes	c
?	c

How	c
much	c
money	c
would	c
you	c
recommend	c
me	c
to	c
take	c
?	c

I	c
would	c
appreciate	c
if	i
you	c
send	i
me	c
a	c
reply	c
for	i
my	c
Questions	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c

,,Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
"	c
.	c

Some	c
people	c
do	c
n't	c
like	c
doing	c
shopping	c
at	c
all	c
and	c
they	c
can	c
well	c
explain	c
to	c
everyone	c
why	c
it	c
is	c
n't	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

Luckily	c
,	c
I	c
'm	c
one	c
of	c
these	c
people	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
shopping	c
is	c
a	c
waste	c
of	c
time	c
.	c

People	c
just	c
run	c
from	c
one	c
shop	c
to	c
another	c
and	c
they	c
just	c
ca	c
n't	c
decide	c
what	c
to	c
buy	c
.	c

During	c
my	c
stay	c
,	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
to	c
see	c
your	c
musical	c
show	c
called	c
'	c
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
'	c
.	c

Here	c
are	c
the	c
problems	c
of	i
your	c
show	c
.	c

In	c
your	c
advertisement	c
,	c
it	c
says	c
that	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
will	c
act	c
but	c
he	c
did	c
not	c
.	c

The	c
price	c
of	c
ticket	i
was	c
another	c
problem	c
.	c

Your	c
advertisement	c
says	c
'	c
discounts	c
available	c
'	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
available	c
.	c

I	c
did	c
not	c
get	c
discount	i
.	c

I	c
really	c
liked	c
your	c
idea	c
of	c
visiting	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
,	c
but	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
late	c
start	c
of	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
the	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
by	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

I	c
really	c
do	c
think	c
you	c
need	c
to	c
organise	c
your	c
show	c
a	c
bit	c
more	c
carefully	c
so	c
you	c
do	c
not	c
make	c
these	c
mistakes	c
in	c
future	c
and	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
kind	c
of	c
you	c
if	c
you	c
give	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

How	c
has	c
modern	c
technology	c
changed	c
your	c
daily	c
life	c
?	c

I	c
believe	c
that	c
modern	c
technology	c
has	c
changed	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
people	c
's	c
daily	c
life	c
.	c

My	c
daily	c
life	c
also	c
got	i
affected	c
by	c
modern	c
technology	c
a	c
lot	c
.	c

I	c
can	c
play	c
games	c
,	c
listen	c
to	c
music	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
can	c
do	c
my	c
course	c
works	i
in	i
the	c
computer	c
.	c

The	c
main	c
advantage	c
of	c
modern	c
technology	c
is	c
getting	c
more	c
informations	i
in	c
shorter	i
time	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
TV	c
's	c
and	c
radios	c
so	c
I	c
can	c
watch	c
or	c
listen	c
to	c
various	c
newses	i
and	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
football	c
pitches	i
to	c
see	c
how	c
the	c
players	c
are	c
playing	c
.	c

There	c
are	c
,	c
of	c
course	c
some	i
disadvantages	c
.	c

Nowadays	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
too	c
easy	c
to	c
get	c
lazy	c
because	c
of	c
modern	c
technology	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
not	c
have	c
to	c
walk	c
or	c
run	c
a	c
lot	c
to	c
go	c
somewhere	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
to	c
spend	c
my	c
time	c
doing	c
some	c
exercises	c
or	c
I	c
will	c
get	c
really	c
lazy	c
and	c
unfit	c
.	c

I	c
sometimes	c
think	c
that	c
it	c
might	c
not	c
be	c
a	c
good	c
idea	c
to	c
use	c
modern	c
technology	c
a	c
lot	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
modern	c
techonology	c
has	c
changed	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
a	c
lot	c
and	c
I	c
hope	c
it	c
will	c
develop	c
even	c
more	c
to	c
change	c
my	c
life	c
even	c
more	c
.	c

I	c
passed	i
one	c
week	c
in	c
London	c
and	c
during	c
my	c
visit	c
I	i
had	i
the	i
fortune	i
to	c
visit	i
"	c
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
"	c
in	i
your	c
theatre	c
.	c

The	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
Musical	c
Show	c
was	c
very	c
good	c
,	c
but	c
the	c
information	c
was	c
not	c
correct	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
advertisement	c
was	i
written	c
that	c
the	c
show	c
will	i
start	c
at	c
19.30	c
but	c
it	c
started	c
45	c
minutes	c
later	c
,	c
at	c
20.15	c
!	c

Because	c
of	c
the	c
advertisement	c
I	c
thought	c
that	c
I	c
can	i
discount	i
the	i
tickets	c
available	c
but	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
.	c

After	c
the	c
show	c
I	c
need	i
to	c
drink	c
something	c
in	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
like	i
the	c
advertisement	c
it	i
concieved	i
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

And	c
there	c
was	c
no	c
reason	c
why	c
.	i

Now	c
I	c
hope	c
that	c
you	c
can	c
understand	c
my	c
question	i
for	c
some	c
money	c
back	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
trouble	c
I	c
had	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secretes	i
.	c

So	c
they	c
stopped	c
nearly	i
immediately	i
to	i
tell	i
her	i
something	i
important	i
.	c

Sometimes	c
it	c
finished	c
like	i
this	i
that	i
the	c
others	c
only	c
said	i
:	c
"	c
Hello	c
,	c
how	c
are	c
you	c
?	c
"	c
and	i
then	c
went	i
away	c
without	c
listening	c
the	i
answer	c
.	c

But	c
at	c
night	c
,	c
when	c
it	c
became	c
dark	c
the	c
dreams	c
were	i
coming	i
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c
I	c
recently	c
went	c
to	c
The	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
see	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
,	c
and	c
it	c
has	c
been	c
quite	c
deceiving	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
to	c
complaint	i
about	c
five	c
or	c
six	c
utterly	c
outrageous	c
facts	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
which	c
I	c
have	i
picked	c
up	c
in	c
the	c
hall	c
of	c
the	c
theatre	c
,	c
are	i
there	i
about	c
five	c
points	c
which	c
were	c
not	c
respected	i
.	c

Could	c
you	c
explain	c
me	i
the	c
reasons	c
of	i
such	c
a	c
huge	c
late	i
?	c

Thirdly	c
,	c
the	c
ad	c
mentionned	i
possible	c
discounts	c
.	c

Personnaly	i
speaking	c
,	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
saw	i
it	i
and	c
even	i
did	i
n't	i
heard	i
of	c
it	i
:	c
I	c
have	i
asked	i
about	c
it	c
,	c
but	c
nobody	c
seemed	c
to	c
know	c
anything	c
concerning	c
discounts	c
.	c

On	c
top	c
of	c
that	c
,	c
the	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
for	c
renovations	i
!	c

How	c
can	c
you	c
dare	c
putting	i
an	c
advertisement	c
for	c
a	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
if	c
you	c
obviously	c
know	c
that	i
is	c
closed	c
?	c

For	c
all	c
these	c
reasons	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
,	c
dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c
that	i
you	c
give	i
me	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hear	i
from	c
you	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c

If	c
only	c
Paul	c
had	c
knew	i
it	i
before	c

He	c
went	c
through	c
valleys	i
,	c
plains	c
and	c
mountains	c
of	c
the	c
Dream	c
Landscape	c
.	c

He	c
finally	c
arrived	c
in	c
Faerie	c
,	c
a	c
country	c
of	c
elder	c
elves	c
and	c
strong	c
white-bearded	c
dwarves	c

All	c
of	c
a	c
sudden	c
,	c
a	c
weird	c
creature	c
popped	c
into	c
his	c
dream	c
.	c

She	c
was	c
taller	c
than	c
a	c
dwarf	c
and	c
as	c
thin	c
as	c
a	c
dying	c
tree	c
.	c

Paul	c
was	c
wandering	i
wether	i
this	c
beast	c
could	c
be	c
offensive	i
when	c
the	c
creature	c
said	c
these	c
words	c
"	i
I	c
am	c
glad	c
to	c
meet	c
you	c
,	c
Paul.	c
"	c

"	c
You	c
see	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
mere	c
product	c
of	c
your	c
mind	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
go	i
out	c
of	c
the	c
Heavy	c

Please	c

bring	c
me	c
with	c
you	c

He	c
jumped	c
out	c
of	c
his	c
room	c
,	c
locked	c
the	c
door	c
and	c
found	c
his	c
brother	c
,	c
Pat	c

He	c
told	c
him	c
about	c
his	c
adventures	c
and	c
asked	c
him	c
not	c
to	c
repeat	c
it	i

Unfortunately	c
...	c
one	c
our	i
after	c

a	c
local	c

arrived	i
and	c
caught	c
the	c
creature	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
put	c
her	c
in	c
a	c
cage	c

There	c
she	c
died	c
because	c
of	i
not	i
having	i
Faerian	i
food	c
necessary	c
to	i
her	c
survival	c

is	c
how	c
human	i
destroys	c
what	c
is	c
good	c
and	c
burns	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
which	i
I	c
saw	c
in	c
your	c
theatre	c
last	c
week	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
really	c
disappointed	c
because	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
far	c
from	c
what	c
I	c
expected	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
really	c
expecting	c
to	c
see	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
my	c
favourite	c
actor	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
he	c
was	c
not	c
on	c
the	c
stage	c
that	c
day	c
.	c

Furthur	i
more	i
,	c
the	c
restaurant	c
in	c
the	c
theatre	c
was	c
closed	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
delay	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
to	c
go	c
home	c
without	c
eating	c
a	i
dinner	c
,	c
though	c
I	c
was	c
really	c
hungry	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
the	c
evening	c
was	c
terrible	c
.	c

If	c
I	c
had	c
known	c
all	i
of	i
them	i
,	c
I	c
would	c
have	c
changed	c
my	c
plan	c
and	c
could	c
have	i
a	c
better	c
time	c
.	c

I	c
also	i
would	i
like	c
to	c
claim	c
some	i
refund	c
for	c
the	c
evening	c

I	c
hope	c
this	c
matter	c
will	c
receive	c
your	c
prompt	c
attention	c

Fashion	c
in	c
100	c
years	c

But	c
how	c
about	c
the	c
fashion	c
of	c
the	c
future	c
,	c
for	c
example	c
,	c
100	c
years	c
from	c
now	c
?	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
'll	c
also	c
be	c
very	c
different	c
from	c
now	c
.	c

Imagine	c
that	c
all	c
the	c
people	c
have	c
hats	c
with	c
big	i
edges	i
to	c
protect	c
their	c
faces	c
from	c
sun-burn	i
,	c
and	c
it	c
's	c
the	c
most	i
trendy	i
fashion	c
of	c
the	c
year	c
!	c

But	c
we	c
never	c
know	c
!	c
!	c

During	c
my	c
recent	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
I	c
visited	c
one	c
of	c
your	c
shows	c
in	i
the	c
"	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
"	c
.	c

The	c
show	c
was	c
called	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
"	c
and	c
should	c
be	c
,	c
in	i
refer	i
to	i
the	c
advertisment	i
,	c
London	c
's	c
newest	c
and	c
best	c
musical	c
show	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
disappointed	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
saw	c
that	c
you	c
had	c
changed	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
to	i
someone	c
else	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
disappointed	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
you	c
have	i
mentioned	c
some	c
discounts	c
in	c
your	c
advertisment	i
,	c
but	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
pay	c
the	c
full	c
price	c
although	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
student	c
.	c

Even	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
for	c
repairs	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

Pat	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
friends	c
for	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
.	c

We	c
have	c
had	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
fun	c
together	c
because	c
we	c
had	i
the	c
same	c
interests	c
.	c

I	c
told	c
Pat	c
to	c
keep	c
in	c
mind	c
that	c
my	c
parents	c
would	c
be	c
very	c
angry	c
if	c
they	c
got	c
to	c
know	c
that	i
.	c

Pat	c
promised	c
me	i
to	c
tell	c
nobody	c
about	c
our	c
purpose	i
.	c

The	c
next	c
day	c
Pat	c
told	c
me	c
that	c
he	c
wanted	c
to	c
be	c
admired	c
by	c
some	c
girls	c
and	c
so	c
he	c
had	c
to	c
tell	c
them	c
our	c
secret	c
.	c

I	c
felt	c
very	c
disappointed	c
in	i
this	i
moment	i
but	c
I	c
have	c
learned	c
something	c
new	c
about	c
humans	c
;	c
is	i
you	i
can	c
only	c
trust	c
yourself	c
.	c

Pat	c
and	c
I	c
have	i
still	i
been	i
good	c
friends	c
but	c
we	c
have	c
never	c
had	i
an	i
other	i
secret	c
together	i
.	c

Sir	c
,	c

I	c
have	i
been	i
very	c
disappointed	c
when	c
I	c
had	i
read	i
your	c
advertisement	c
,	i
I	c
was	c
keen	c
on	c
your	c
show	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
have	c
not	c
seen	c
the	c
same	c
show	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
seen	c
one	c
which	c
it	i
looked	i
like	i
,	c
but	c
not	i
be	i
.	i

First	c
of	c
all	c
I	i
have	i
been	i
attracted	c
by	c
the	c
actors	c
-	c
Danny	c
Brooks	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
-	c
and	c
not	c
by	c
the	c
actors	c
who	c
played	i
effectly	i
that	c
evening	c
.	c

This	i
actors	c
appeared	c
with	i
fourty-five	i
minutes	c
later	i
refering	i
which	i
is	c
written	c
on	i
your	c
advertisement	c
.	c

This	c
late	i
forbid	i
me	c
to	i
dinner	c
in	c
your	c
restaurant	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
just	c
closing	c
!	c

For	c
all	c
this	i
reasons	c
I	c
do	i
wish	c
that	c
I	c
would	i
not	i
have	i
been	i
gone	c
see	i
that	c
show	c
,	c
for	c
which	c
the	c
tickets	c
were	c
not	c
available	c
.	c

You	c
have	c
the	c
choice	c
,	c
either	c
you	c
make	i
what	c
I	c
want	c
,	c
or	c
I	c
attack	c
you	c
in	c
justice	i
.	c

But	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
think	c
he	c
would	c
want	c
to	c
.	c

He	c
doe	i
n't	i
want	c
because	i
he	c
wants	c
to	c
prove	c
the	i
little	c
and	i
himself	c
that	c
he	c
is	c
not	c
really	c
old	c
,	c
even	c
if	c
he	c
has	c
a	i
big	i
age	i
.	c

I	c
think	c
this	i
are	c
the	c
reasons	c
of	i
his	c
will	i
.	c

Although	c
the	c
fish	c
is	c
eaten	c
by	c
the	c
sharks	c
,	c
he	c
is	c
the	c
winner	c
,	c
the	c
winner	c
of	c
himself	c
.	c

He	c
could	c
have	c
triumph	i
othe	i
fish	i
because	c
of	c
his	c
knowledge	c
of	c
the	c
sea	c
but	c
principally	i
because	c
he	c
has	c
known	i
research	i
in	c
the	c
deeper	i
of	c
his	c
mind	c
.	c

To	c
conclude	c
I	c
think	c
the	c
difficults	i
situations	c
allow	c
us	c
to	c
discover	c
ourself	i
getting	i
out	i
of	i
ourself	i
.	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
Camp	c
on	i
July	c
.	c

As	c
regards	c
swimming	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
my	c
passion	c
from	c
the	i
very	i
childhood	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
going	c
in	c
for	c
this	c
kind	c
of	c
sport	c
for	c
five	c
years	c
now	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
much	c
about	c
the	c
weather	c
down	c
there	c
,	c
in	c
California	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
am	c
rather	c
puzzeled	i
about	c
what	c
to	c
wear	c
there	c
.	c

Besides	i
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
will	i
I	i
need	c
and	c
which	c
expensies	i
will	i
I	i
have	c
to	c
pay	i
for	i
by	i
myself	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

Introduction	c
.	c

We	c
should	c
film	c
our	c
gardens	c
around	c
school	i
and	c
a	i
pitch	c
with	c
the	c
playgrounds	i
for	c
volley-ball	i
and	c
tennis	c
at	c
the	c
back	c
of	c
the	c
school	c
in	c
the	c
very	c
beginning	c
.	c

Classrooms	c
,	c
Lessons	c
and	c
Breaks	c
.	c

Next	i
things	c
to	c
be	c
shot	c
,	c
by	i
the	c
majority	c
of	c
students	c
was	i
said	i
to	i
be	i
the	c
teaching	c
process	c
and	c
the	c
breaks	c
.	c

Here	c
I	c
should	c
also	c
mention	c
the	c
decoration	i
of	c
our	c
classrooms	c
and	c
atmosphere	i
in	c
them	c
.	c

And	c
as	c
regards	c
breaks	c
student	i
consider	c
them	c
being	i
a	c
very	c
important	c
part	c
of	c
school	c
life	c
,	c
despite	c
all	c
their	i
mess	c
and	c
noise	c
.	c

We	c
can	c
make	i
some	i
short	i
shots	i
about	i
the	c
school	c
theatre	c
and	c
it	i
's	i
performances	i
and	c
also	c
about	c
the	c
sport-clubs	i
and	c
their	c
competitions	c
and	c
awards	c
.	c

Conclusion	c

In	c
the	c
conclusion	c
of	c
my	c
report	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
the	c
suggestions	c
were	c
made	c
according	c
to	c
the	c
survey	c
made	i
among	c
the	c
students	c
of	c
our	c
school	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
,	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
the	i
chance	c
to	c
do	i
such	c
a	c
gorgeous	c
trip	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
there	c
is	c
one	c
point	c
that	c
we	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
change	c
in	c
the	c
programme	c
.	c

We	c
are	c
interested	c
in	c
visiting	c
"	c
The	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
"	c
during	c
our	c
travel	i
.	c

Furthermore	c
is	i
totally	c
free	c
for	c
students	c
.	c

All	c
this	i
exhibiots	i
are	c
really	c
important	c
and	c
exciting	c
for	c
us	c
because	c
,	c
nowadays	c
,	c
fashion	c
has	c
a	c
huge	c
influence	c
in	i
our	c
lifestyle	c
and	c
we	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
more	c
about	c
it	c
.	c

We	c
think	c
that	c
we	c
could	c
go	c
there	c
next	i
14th	c
of	c
March	c
,	c
in	c
the	c
eveninng	i
,	c
instead	c
of	c
going	c
shopping	c
.	c

This	c
one	c
could	c
be	c
translate	i
to	c
15th	i
evening	i
.	c

It	c
is	c
also	c
possible	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
show	c
in	c
the	c
morning	c
but	c
we	c
are	i
totally	c
agree	c
that	c
we	c
do	c
n't	c
want	c
to	c
lose	c
our	c
visit	c
to	c
the	c
Science	c
Museum	c
.	c

We	c
truly	c
believe	i
you	c
will	c
consider	c
our	c
change	c
.	c

Please	c
contact	c
us	c
if	c
you	c
have	c
any	c
question	c
.	c

Almost	c
everyone	c
relation	i
famous	c
people	c
with	c
photographers	c
,	c
articles	c
,	c
money	c
,	c
fans	c
,	i
.	c

.	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
one	c
hand	c
you	c
find	c
the	c
ones	c
that	c
are	c
well-known	i
and	c
never	c
talk	c
about	c
their	c
privacy	i
.	c

They	c
use	c
the	c
publicity	c
exclusive	i
for	c
their	c
work	c
.	c

I	c
mean	c
,	c
they	c
enjoin	i
being	c
the	c
point	i
of	i
view	i
or	c
the	c
center	i
of	i
everyone	c
,	c
even	c
though	c
it	c
means	c
to	i
see	i
their	c
lifes	i
.	c

Communications	i
move	i
the	c
world	c
and	c
famous	c
people	c
use	c
them	i
to	c
improve	c
their	c
work	c
,	c
politicians	c
for	c
their	c
campain	i
and	c
film	c
stars	c
to	c
make	c
famous	i
their	i
last	i
movie	i
.	c

Nevertheless	c
,	c
sometimes	c
communications	i
disturb	i
their	c
lifes	i
in	c
a	c
wrong	c
way	c
.	c

Dear	c
Miss	c
Ryan	c
,	c

Here	c
I	c
enclose	c
some	c
information	c
which	c
you	c
requested	c
in	c
the	c
letter	c
I	c
received	c
.	c

This	c
trip	c
will	c
give	c
me	c
a	c
chance	c
to	c
relax	c
during	c
my	c
holidays	c
,	c
as	c
well	c
as	c
allow	i
me	c
to	c
gain	c
valuable	c
knowledge	c
and	c
experience	c
.	c

Between	c
the	c
tent	c
and	c
log	c
cabin	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
the	c
tent	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
much	i
experience	c
in	i
swimming	c
and	c
have	c
represented	c
my	c
school	c
before	c
.	c

As	c
for	c
tennis	c
,	c
I	c
find	c
it	c
very	c
enjoyable	c
and	c
have	c
gone	c
for	c
proper	c
lessons	c
.	c

Last	i
before	i
least	i
,	c
I	c
wonder	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
inform	c
me	c
of	c
the	c
clothes	c
I	c
should	c
bring	c
to	c
America	c
.	c

As	c
I	c
have	c
not	c
been	c
there	c
before	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
rather	c
unsure	c
of	c
what	c
to	c
wear	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
also	c
trying	c
to	c
decide	c
on	c
the	c
amount	c
of	c
money	c
I	c
should	c
bring	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
n't	c
taken	c
up	c
too	c
much	c
time	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
this	c
exciting	c
news	c
.	c

I	c
ca	c
n't	c
wait	c
to	c
go	c
on	c
this	c
adventure	c
of	c
a	c
lifetime	c
!	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

I	c
hope	c
the	c
weather	c
is	c
holding	c
up	c
.	c

I	c
hear	c
that	c
it	c
can	c
be	c
terrible	c
at	c
times	c
.	c

Guess	c
what	c
?	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
fantastic	c
experience	c
.	c

All	c
the	c
students	c
had	c
to	c
help	c
to	c
brighten	c
up	c
the	c
place	c
,	c
and	c
boy	c
did	c
we	c
work	c
.	c

I	c
helped	c
to	c
decorate	c
the	c
walls	c
.	c

My	c
friends	c
and	c
I	c
managed	c
to	c
paint	c
a	c
smart	c
navy	c
blue	c
on	c
the	c
old	c
,	c
faded	c
green	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
n't	c
as	c
easy	c
as	c
I	c
had	c
expected	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
special	c
equipment	c
and	c
techniques	c
which	c
must	c
be	c
used	c
to	c
ensure	c
a	c
good	c
result	c
.	c

Besides	c
that	c
,	c
I	c
also	c
helped	c
to	c
do	c
banners	c
and	c
signs	c
to	c
inform	c
other	c
people	c
about	c
the	c
concert	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
hard	c
work	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
saw	c
wood	c
and	c
paint	c
all	c
day	c
long	c
.	c

Several	c
other	c
students	c
helped	c
me	c
out	c
,	c
and	c
we	c
managed	c
to	c
make	c
some	c
eye-catching	c
advertisements	c
.	c

I	c
also	c
helped	c
in	i
the	c
lighting	c
and	c
studio	c
equipment	c
.	c

I	c
fixed	c
the	c
lighting	c
on	c
the	c
ceiling	c
and	c
attached	c
several	c
spotlights	c
to	c
the	c
walls	c
.	c

This	c
produced	c
a	c
stunning	c
effect	c
during	c
the	c
concert	c
.	c

It	c
gave	c
me	c
the	i
chance	c
to	c
expand	c
my	c
knowledge	c
and	c
gain	c
new	c
skills	c
in	c
electronics	c
.	c

I	c
really	c
enjoyed	c
myself	c
and	c
I	c
hope	c
that	c
you	c
can	c
have	c
the	c
chance	c
to	c
experience	c
this	c
too	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
that	c
you	c
can	c
write	c
to	c
me	c
soon	c
.	c

Bye	c
for	c
now	c
!	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
2nd	i
of	c
March	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
some	c
information	c
about	c
myself	c
.	c

I	i
m	i
always	c
been	i
intents	i
when	c
I	c
went	i
with	i
the	c
university	c
camps	c
so	c
I	c
prefer	i
log	c
cabins	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
because	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
new	c
experience	c
for	c
me	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
also	c
learn	c
how	c
to	c
live	c
in	c
there	i
.	c

Also	c
painting	c
is	c
my	c
hobby	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
always	c
been	i
painting	i
when	c
I	c
have	c
a	i
spare	c
time	c
.	c

Once	c
again	c
,	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
giving	c
me	c
a	c
good	c
opportunity	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
going	c
with	i
your	c
camp	c
in	c
the	c
near	c
future	c

Yours	c

Most	c
people	c
enjoy	c
going	c
shopping	c
every	c
weekend	c
but	c
some	c
think	c
that	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
because	i
of	i
different	c
reasons	c
and	c
places	i
.	c

In	c
the	c
first	c
place	c
,	c
some	c
housewifes	i
do	c
n't	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
supermarket	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
not	c
fun	c
to	c
go	c
shopping	c
with	c
a	c
long	c
list	c
and	c
decide	c
which	c
one	c
is	c
the	c
first	c
and	c
the	c
second	c
.	c

To	c
make	c
matters	c
worse	c
,	c
you	c
forget	i
to	c
buy	c
something	c
when	c
you	c
get	c
back	c
home	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
very	c
frustrating	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
if	c
you	c
go	c
with	c
your	c
children	c
,	c
you	c
will	c
have	c
to	c
control	c
them	c
and	c
remember	c
things	c
on	c
your	c
list	c
at	c
the	c
same	c
time	c
and	c
sometimes	c
they	c
cry	c
when	c
they	c
want	c
something	c
in	c
the	c
supermarket	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
a	c
tough	c
chore	c
!	c

Another	c
point	i
of	i
view	i
against	c
shopping	c
is	c
a	i
lack	c
of	c
the	i
items	c
that	c
you	c
really	c
want	c
.	c

Sometimes	c
when	i
you	c
meet	i
a	c
nice	c
dress	c
and	c
you	c
think	c
you	c
are	c
going	c
to	c
buy	c
it	c
tomorrow	c
but	c
when	c
you	c
come	c
back	c
it	c
is	c
sold	c
out	i
or	c
there	c
is	i
no	i
your	i
size	i
left	i
.	c

I	c
cannot	c
imagine	c
anything	c
worse	c
.	c

The	c
other	c
disadvantage	c
is	c
that	c
you	c
enjoy	c
going	c
shopping	c
too	c
much	c
and	c
pay	c
everything	i
buy	i
credit	i
card	c
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
I	c
believe	c
that	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
if	c
you	c
accidently	i
meet	i
a	c
bad	c
situation	c
or	c
you	c
can	i
not	i
control	c
your	c
expenditure	c
carefully	c

Dear	c
Mister	i
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
from	c
Paris	c
where	c
I	c
live	c
.	c

We	c
asked	c
our	c
travel	c
agent	c
to	c
organise	c
our	c
trip	c
.	c

My	c
wife	c
and	c
I	c
are	c
both	c
found	i
of	c
theatre	c
,	c
musical	i
shows	i
especially	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
so	c
rare	c
to	c
see	c
musical	i
in	c
Paris	c
that	c
we	c
decided	c
to	c
book	c
two	c
seats	c
for	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
"	c
.	c

Of	c
course	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
did	c
n't	c
start	c
on	c
time	c
.	c

Our	c
travel	c
agent	c
told	c
us	c
that	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
cheaper	c
to	c
purchase	c
our	c
tickets	c
directly	c
in	i
the	c
theatre	c
.	c

But	c
,	c
in	c
fact	c
,	c
there	c
were	c
no	c
discounts	c
available	c
.	c

And	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
pay	c
Â£	c
20	c
each	i
seat	c
.	c

The	c
worst	c
was	c
to	c
come	c
.	c

But	c
,	c
instead	c
of	c
him	c
,	c
we	c
saw	c
an	c
unknown	c
actor	c
(	c
who	c
really	c
need	i
singing	c
lessons	c
)	c
.	c

But	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

Perhaps	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
luck	i
!	c

My	c
brother	c
was	c
too	c
talkative	c
!	c

Two	c
days	c
before	c
,	c
I	c
told	c
him	c
that	c
our	c
father	c
was	c
about	c
to	c
buy	c
a	c
brand	c
new	c
car	c
.	c

And	c
he	c
did	c
not	c
want	c
our	c
mother	c
to	c
be	c
informed	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
be	c
a	c
gift	c
for	c
twenty	c
years	c
of	c
marriage	c
.	c

The	c
first	c
thing	c
Pat	c
did	c
was	c
to	c
tell	c
our	c
young	c
sister	c
the	c
secret	c
.	c

Her	c
reaction	c
was	c
not	c
the	c
one	c
we	c
were	c
expecting	c
.	c

Apparently	i
she	c
was	c
not	c
surprised	c
,	c
but	c
she	c
was	c
surely	i
angry	c
.	c

Really	c
angry	c
!	c
!	c

She	c
thought	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
stupid	c
idea	c
,	c
and	c
also	c
an	c
expensive	c
one	c
.	c

She	c
suspected	c
our	c
father	c
to	i
want	i
to	c
please	c
himself	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
the	c
colour	c
my	c
father	c
had	c
chosen	c
for	c
the	c
car	c
!	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
happy	c
that	c
I	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
-	c
two	c
weeks	c
at	c
camp	i
California	c
in	c
USA	i
.	c

After	c
my	c
school	c
exams	c
I	c
will	c
have	c
time	c
to	c
prepare	c
myself	c
for	c
the	c
trip	c
.	c

In	c
your	c
letter	c
you	c
are	i
asking	i
me	c
to	c
chose	i
which	c
accomodation	i
I	c
prefer	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
very	c
much	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
tents	i
.	c

Last	c
year	c
I	c
stay	i
in	c
tents	i
with	c
some	c
friends	c
in	c
England	c
and	c
I	c
really	c
enjoyed	c
it	c
.	c

Summer	i
time	i
the	c
weather	c
is	c
good	c
and	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
see	c
any	i
problem	c
anywhere	i
I	c
will	i
stay	i
.	c

During	c
my	c
time	c
in	c
California	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
love	c
to	c
have	c
the	c
chance	c
of	i
some	c
leisure	c
activities	c
such	c
as	c
swimming	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
my	c
favourite	c
sport	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
good	c
and	i
fast	i
at	i
swimming	i
.	c

So	c
we	c
all	i
play	i
as	c
a	c
team	c
.	c

My	c
final	c
question	c
is	c
this	c
.	c

Can	c
you	c
let	c
me	c
know	c
if	c
there	c
is	i
any	c
facilities	c
for	c
washing	c
my	c
clothes	c
If	i
not	c
I	c
will	c
bring	c
with	c
me	c
enough	c
to	c
last	c
for	c
two	c
weeks	c
.	c

Please	c
give	c
me	c
a	c
rough	c
idea	c
how	c
much	c
spending	c
money	c
I	c
will	c
need	c
.	c

Please	c

Shoping	i
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

Once	c
a	c
week	c
I	c
go	c
shopping	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
unavoidable	c
Sometimes	i
it	c
is	c
pleasant	c
,	c
and	c
sometimes	c
it	c
's	c
not	c
.	c

I	c
often	c
shop	c
with	c
no	c
problems	c
,	c
but	c
on	c
Saturday	c
is	i
not	c
the	c
same	c
.	c

Shops	i
are	c
so	c
crowded	c
and	c
it	c
takes	c
long	i
time	c
to	c
find	c
what	c
we	c
want	c
and	c
what	c
we	c
need	c
.	c

Also	c
we	c
got	i
to	c
face	c
a	c
long	c
queue	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
pay	c
.	c

I	c
find	c
it	c
very	c
tiring	c
sometimes	c
.	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
because	c
we	c
spend	c
money	c
.	c

Usually	c
much	i
more	i
money	i
we	i
spend	i
than	c
we	c
expect	c
.	c

We	c
ca	c
n't	c
do	c
anything	c
about	c
is	i
.	c

Sometimes	c
shopping	c
is	c
very	c
enjoyable	c
but	c
not	c
everyday	i
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c

I	c
have	c
just	c
received	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
return	c
to	c
my	c
University	c
in	c
the	c
middle	c
of	c
August	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
more	c
comfortable	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
log	c
cabins	c
than	c
in	c
tents	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
log	c
cabins	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
not	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
playing	c
tennis	c
,	c
so	c
could	c
you	c
tell	c
me	c
if	c
I	c
can	c
learn	c
at	c
the	c
camp	c
?	c

Please	c
could	c
you	c
also	c
let	c
me	c
know	c
if	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
take	c
special	c
clothes	c
with	c
me	c
?	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
the	c
camp	c
in	c
the	c
U.S.A	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

In	c
the	c
first	c
part	c
of	c
this	c
book	c
it	c
can	c
be	c
seen	c
Woods	i
is	c
not	c
on	c
the	c
side	c
of	c
the	c
blacks	c
although	c
he	c
did	c
n't	c
approve	c
of	c
the	c
government	c
's	c
attitude	c
to	i
them	c
.	c

In	c
some	c
ways	c
,	c
he	c
did	c
not	c
agree	c
with	c
"	c
Black	c
Consciousness	c
"	c
which	c
is	c
Biko	c
's	c
organization	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
too	c
much	c
against	c
the	c
whites	c
.	c

The	c
people	c
and	c
the	c
circumstances	c
he	c
experienced	c
in	c
the	c
black	c
township	c
were	c
such	c
a	c
new	c
world	c
to	c
him	c
.	c

Finally	c
he	c
changed	c
his	c
ideas	c
and	c
started	c
to	c
work	c
for	c
the	c
blacks	c
using	c
his	c
skill	c
as	c
a	c
journalist	c
,	i
in	i
other	c
words	c
,	c
he	c
became	c
an	c
activist	c
for	c
the	c
black	c
people	c
of	c
South	c
Africa	c
.	c

In	c
short	c
,	c
Cry	c
Freedom	c
deserves	c
to	c
be	c
recommended	c
and	c
once	c
you	c
read	c
it	c
,	c
you	c
will	c
want	c
to	c
read	c
it	c
again	c
.	c

Dear	c
Ms.	c
Ryan	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
,	i
in	c
reply	c
for	i
your	c
letter	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
my	i
accomodation	i
to	c
be	i
in	c
log	i
cabins	i
,	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
alergic	i
to	c
some	c
insects	c
that	c
might	c
go	i
in	c
the	i
tent	c
.	c

In	i
regard	i
to	i
the	c
activities	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	i
tennis	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
some	c
experience	c
playing	c
,	c
and	c
my	c
spin	c
and	c
volley	c
are	c
very	c
good	c
,	c
and	c
painting	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
some	i
techniques	c
,	i
that	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
put	i
on	i
practise	i

Thanking	c
you	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Carmen	c
Dolores	c
Rossell	c

Firstly	c
,	c
you	c
need	c
to	c
know	c
,	i
and	i
be	i
counscious	i
of	i
what	c
you	c
are	c
doing	c
.	c

I	c
spend	i
two	c
weeks	c
preparing	c
all	i
the	c
stage	c
,	c
speakers	c
,	c
background	i
,	c
michrophones	i
,	c
everything	c
with	i
all	c
the	c
staff	c
,	c
and	c
every	c
night	c
,	i
the	c
artists	c
came	c
to	c
rehearsal	i
their	c
show	c
,	i
I	c
could	c
see	c
how	c
they	c
really	c
improved	c
,	c
and	c
how	c
nice	c
they	c
were	c
with	c
the	c
staff	c
.	c

The	c
day	c
of	c
the	c
concert	c
,	c
everyone	c
,	c
including	c
the	c
artists	c
and	c
managers	c
were	c
nervous	c
and	c
were	c
tired	c
,	i
however	i
,	c
when	c
the	c
concert	c
started	c
,	c
we	c
saw	c
that	c
all	c
our	c
efforts	c
were	i
worthy	i
,	i
the	i
crow	i
and	c
artists	c
thanked	c
the	c
staff	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
see	c
the	c
staff	c
,	c
managers	c
,	c
artists	c
and	c
even	c
the	c
director	c
,	c
all	c
like	i
a	c
big	c
team	c
,	c
working	c
together	c
.	c

That	c
was	c
what	c
made	c
it	c
mostly	i
special	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

We	c
were	c
disappointed	c
because	c
your	c
advertisement	c
was	c
a	c
misleading	c
one	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
singer	c
,	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
was	c
not	c
singing	c
.	c

The	c
times	i
were	i
not	c
respected	c
:	c
the	c
show	c
began	c
45	c
minutes	c
late	c
.	c

The	c
children	c
could	c
not	c
stand	c
waiting	c
outside	c
in	c
the	c
cold	c
.	c

As	c
it	c
started	c
later	c
,	c
it	c
finished	c
later	c
and	c
people	c
missed	c
the	c
train	c
they	c
wanted	c
to	c
take	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
the	c
tickets	c
were	c
a	c
little	c
bit	c
expensive	c
and	c
not	c
many	c
people	c
could	c
afford	c
the	c
price	c
.	c

Finally	c
your	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
too	c
few	c
people	c
came	i
before	i
.	c

Yours	c
Faithfully	c

Modern	c
technology	c
is	c
everywhere	c
in	c
our	c
society	c
.	c

But	c
cars	c
created	i
pollution	c
:	c
for	c
exemple	i
the	c
green	i
house	i
effect	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
there	c
is	c
a	c
link	c
between	c
technology	c
and	c
sciences	i
because	c
they	c
need	c
each	c
other	c
:	c
sciences	i
discover	c
technologies	c
and	c
technologies	c
make	c
possible	i
new	i
searches	i
in	i
sciences	i
.	c

Technology	c
also	c
improved	c
the	i
communications	c
with	c
the	c
phone	c
of	c
course	c
and	c
also	c
with	c
Internet	i
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
it	c
's	c
a	c
lot	c
better	c
than	c
the	c
dictionnary	i
because	c
it	c
's	c
faster	c
and	c
you	c
really	c
find	c
what	c
you	c
need	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
we	c
can	c
find	c
everything	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writting	i
you	i
about	c
an	c
enjure	i
that	c
I	c
had	c
in	i
your	c
last	c
musical	c
Circle	i
Theatre	c
.	c

I	c
went	c
to	c
see	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
"	c
last	c
Saturday	c
and	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
very	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
surpprising	i
that	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
did	c
not	c
played	i
.	c

Anybody	i
told	c
us	c
why	c
they	c
was	i
n't	i
there	c
.	c

I	c
read	c
on	i
your	c
advertisment	i
in	c
Friday	c
's	c
edition	c
of	c
the	c
Times	c
that	c
the	c
show	c
should	c
start	c
at	c
19.30	c
but	c
the	c
representation	i
started	c
at	c
20.15	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
understand	c
the	c
problem	c
between	c
your	c
advertisment	i
and	c
the	c
reality	c
.	c

And	c
finally	c
,	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
drink	i
a	c
coffee	c
but	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c

sincerely	c

How	c

modern	c

your	c

My	c
life	c
change	i
everyday	i
with	i
the	i
modern	c
technology	c
.	c

For	c
exemple	i
,	c
if	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
time	c
to	c
do	c
my	c
shopping	c
after	c
school	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
do	c
my	c
homework	c
,	c
I	c
am	i
going	i
on	c
Internet	i
and	c
ask	c
for	c
what	c
I	c
need	c
.	c

The	c
day	c
after	c
I	c
get	c
everything	c
at	c
home	c
by	c
post	c

In	i
my	i
point	i
of	i

is	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
discover	i
of	c
the	c

You	c
can	c
book	c
tickets	c
for	c

etc.	c
,	c
you	c
can	c
find	c
all	c
informations	i
you	c

You	c

a	c
lot	c
of	c
things	c
to	c

It	c
was	c
the	c
only	c
disappointment	c
during	c
my	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
,	c
since	c
several	c
points	i
did	c
n't	c
worked	i
out	c
as	c
promised	c
in	c
your	c
advertisement	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
there	c
were	c
no	c
discounts	c
available	c
,	c
and	c
having	c
payed	i
Â£	c
20	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
wait	c
45	c
minutes	c
longer	c
than	c
expected	c
since	c
the	c
show	c
began	c
at	c
20:15	c
and	c
not	c
at	c
19:30	c
.	c

His	c
acting	c
and	c
singing	c
was	i
horrible	c
.	c

At	i
last	i
,	c
after	c
all	c
these	c
disadvantages	i
,	c
I	c
was	c
not	c
able	c
to	c
have	c
diner	i
in	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
closed	c
of	i
some	c
reason	c
I	c
still	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
.	c

Therefor	i
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
for	c
at	c
least	c
half	c
of	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
,	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c
Ewe	c
P	c
Meier	c

And	c
if	c
he	c
had	c
been	c
able	c
to	c
keep	c
one	c
,	c
the	c
following	c
story	c
would	c
n't	c
have	c
happened	c
.	c

Pat	c
was	c
a	c
teacher	c
for	i
english	i
as	c
a	c
foreign	c
language	c
.	c

And	c
always	c
,	c
every	i
body	i
made	i
it	c
surprisingly	c
well	c
.	c

What	c
was	c
the	c
reason	c
?	c

Pat	c
used	c
to	c
show	c
the	c
test	c
to	c
his	c
friend	c
Nick	c
,	c
when	c
he	c
had	c
finished	c
it	c
to	i
get	c
his	c
opinion	c
.	c

Nick	c
now	i
had	i
taken	i
a	c
copy	c
of	c
the	c
test	c
to	c
archive	i
it	c
.	c

And	c
the	i
girlfriend	i
of	i
Nick	i
happened	c
to	c
be	c
in	c
Pat	c
's	c
class	c
.	c

She	c
was	c
quite	c
clever	c
and	c
had	c
known	c
everything	c
about	c
this	c
,	c
so	c
she	c
had	c
taken	i
copies	c
for	c
her	c
classmates	c
and	c
everybody	c
was	c
prepared	c
.	c

You	c
see	c
,	c
each	c
little	c
secret	c
is	c
a	c
kind	c
of	c
pressure	c
to	c
Pat	c
,	c
and	c
he	c
only	c
feels	c
free	c
if	c
he	c
can	c
tell	c
someone	c
about	c
it	c
.	c

And	c
this	c
is	c
the	c
same	c
for	c
everybody	c
,	c
is	c
n't	c
it	c
?	c

Or	c
can	c
you	c
keep	c
a	c
secret	c
?	c

Dear	c
Mr.	c
.	c

.	c
.	c

At	c
first	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
great	c
plessure	i
for	c
me	c
to	c
get	c
a	c
ticket	c
therefor	i
becauses	i
I	c
'm	c
one	c
of	c
the	i
greatest	i
fan	i
of	i
Danny	i
Brook	i
.	c

I	c
could	c
n't	c
stay	c
any	c
more	i
and	c
had	c
to	c
leave	c
the	c
theatre	c
.	c

You	c
have	c
to	c
know	c
that	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
sik	i
because	c
of	c
my	c
blood	c
presure	i
and	c
so	c
I	c
was	c
laying	c
down	c
the	c
hole	i
weekend	c
.	c

Otherwise	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
contact	c
my	c
lower	i
.	c

For	c
me	c
as	i
an	i
scientist	c
it	i
's	c
a	c
main	i
problem	c
to	c
show	c
how	c
the	c
inovations	i
of	c
the	c
last	c
century	c
goes	i
up	i
with	i
the	c
environment	c
and	c
natur	i
.	c

In	c
past	i
new	c
technologies	c
mostly	i
followed	c
by	c
ground-	c
,	c
water-	c
or	c
air	c
pollution	c
.	c

A	i
nowadays	i
simple	c
thing	c
like	c
a	c
computer	c
include	i
so	c
many	c
possible	c
ways	c
to	i
destroy	i
different	c
environmental	i
compartiments	i
.	c

Now	c
I	c
try	c
to	c
show	c
,	c
in	c
my	c
daily	c
work	c
,	c
how	c
the	c
airborn	c
chlororganics	c
,	c
which	c
are	c
degased	i
from	c
plastics	c
,	c
will	c
be	c
seperated	i
and	c
damaged	c
by	c
green	c
plants	c
.	c

Sometimes	c
it	c
seems	c
to	c
me	c
like	c
joke	i
if	c
I	c
remember	i
all	c
the	c
daungerous	i
materials	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
do	c
my	c
job	c
.	c

Nevertheless	c
,	c
in	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
the	c
only	c
way	c
to	c
find	c
a	c
better	c
kind	i
of	c
living	c
with	c
the	i
nature	c
is	c
to	c
check	c
out	c
the	c
problems	c
we	c
have	c
.	c

Therefore	c
it	c
make	i
sense	c
to	c
use	c
the	c
inovation	i
which	c
are	c
standing	i
for	i
environmental	c
destructions	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
answer	c
your	c
letter	c
,	c
which	c
I	c
have	i
recieved	i
yesterday	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
accepting	c
me	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
appreciate	i
that	c
all	c
costs	i
are	c
paid	c
for	i
.	c

I	c
could	i
travel	c
only	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
my	c
exam	i
will	c
be	c
finished	c
in	i
the	c
beginning	c
of	c
that	c
month	c
and	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
great	c
if	c
I	c
could	c
set	c
off	c
my	i
journey	c
on	c
15th	c
July	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
,	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
nice	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
send	c
me	c
an	i
address	c
which	i
I	c
am	c
going	c
to	c
stay	c
,	c
so	c
that	c
I	c
can	c
keep	c
in	c
touch	c
with	c
my	c
friends	c
and	c
family	c
.	c

Yours	c
Sincerely	c
,	c

I	c
think	c
this	c
statement	c
is	c
true	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
suitable	c
for	c
children	c
whose	c
age	i
is	i
under	c
18	c
!	c

This	c
is	c
quite	c
a	c
strong	c
opinion	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
know	i
it	c
from	c
my	c
real-life	c
experiences	c
of	c
shopping	c
.	c

I	i
'm	i
not	c
dare	c
to	c
culculate	i
how	c
much	c
I	c
have	c
spent	c
for	i
those	c
things	c
without	c
thinking	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
bad	c
,	i
my	i
mom	i
always	c
told	c
me	c
that	c
I	c
had	c
n't	c
have	i
earned	c
enough	c
money	c
so	c
that	i
I	c
should	c
n't	c
have	c
spent	c
it	c
in	c
the	c
wrong	c
way	c
.	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
a	c
wrong	i
thing	c
to	c
do	c
as	c
long	c
as	c
you	c
can	c
earn	c
money	c
yourself	c
and	c
know	c
what	i
you	c
are	c
spending	c
it	c
for	i
!	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
about	c
the	c
International	c
Arts	c
Festival	c
which	c
took	c
place	c
these	i
21	c
and	c
22	c
November	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
idea	c
to	c
have	c
this	c
kind	c
of	c
festival	c
in	c
our	c
region	c
and	c
I	c
really	c
enjoyed	c
most	c
of	c
the	c
events	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
feel	c
that	c
it	c
could	c
be	c
even	c
better	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
according	c
to	c
your	c
advertisement	c
,	c
the	c
'	c
Stars	c
and	c
artists	c
from	c
around	c
the	c
world	c
'	c
came	c
from	c
only	c
six	c
countries	c
.	c

In	c
spite	c
of	c
the	c
fact	c
that	c
the	c
classical	c
concerts	c
were	c
really	c
good	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
some	c
concert	c
halls	c
were	c
too	c
small	c
and	c
so	c
not	c
everybody	c
could	c
appreciate	c
the	c
good	i
quality	c
of	c
the	c
music	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
so	c
!	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
a	i
weekend	c
is	c
really	c
too	c
short	c
.	c

May	c
I	c
suggest	c
you	c
to	i
think	i
about	c
doing	c
the	c
festival	c
over	c
one	i
week	c
.	c

Dear	c
Magda	c
,	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
's	c
a	i
big	i
difference	i
with	i
England	c
,	c
children	c
do	c
n't	c
wear	c
uniforms	c
at	c
school	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
surprised	c
when	c
I	c
saw	c
them	c
in	c
your	c
country	c
.	c

Of	c
course	c
when	c
you	c
're	c
in	c
class	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
behave	c
yourself	c
,	i
be	c
polite	c
with	c
the	c
teacher	c
and	c
the	c
other	c
school	i
children	i
.	c

During	c
the	c
break	c
too	i
,	c
usually	c
some	c
teachers	c
stay	c
out	c
and	c
keep	c
an	c
eye	c
on	c
you	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
nowadays	c
,	c
children	c
are	c
more	c
free	c
and	c
heard	i
,	i
I	c
mean	c
the	i
contact	c
between	c
them	c
and	c
adults	c
.	c

At	c
home	c
is	i
different	c
,	i
each	i
family	c
has	c
its	c
own	c
rules	c
.	c

As	i
I	i
am	i
concerned	i
,	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
child	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
not	c
allowed	c
to	c
stay	c
very	i
late	c
with	c
my	c
parents	c
and	c
sometimes	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
because	c
I	c
was	c
not	c
tired	c
.	c

Usually	c
,	c
at	c
home	c
,	c
like	c
at	c
school	c
,	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
behave	c
yourself	c
but	c
differently	c
,	c
because	c
you	c
're	c
at	c
home	c
so	c
you	c
feel	c
more	c
confident	c
.	c

There	c
are	c
some	c
rules	c
like	i
"	c
do	c
n't	c
speak	c
with	c
a	c
full	c
mouth	c
"	c
;	c
"	c
do	c
n't	c
put	c
your	c
finger	c
in	c
your	c
noise	i
"	c
;	c
"	c
say	c
please	c
and	c
thank	c
you	c
"	c
;	c
"	c
do	c
n't	c
fight	c
with	c
your	c
brother	c
"	c
;	c
and	c
so	c
on	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
's	c
the	c
same	c
everywhere	c
.	c

Well	c
,	c
I	c
hope	c
I	c
've	c
helped	c
you	c
a	c
little	c
and	c
I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
the	i
advertisement	c
where	c
you	c
have	i
advertised	i
your	c
program	i
and	c
what	c
the	c
theatre	c
was	i
providing	i
for	i
you	i
is	c
totaly	i
wrong	c
.	c

Also	c
show	i
started	c
very	c
late	c
compere	i
to	c
what	c
was	c
writen	i
on	i
the	c
advertisement	c
.	c

And	c
I	c
think	c
you	c
know	c
how	c
it	c
is	c
just	c
sit	i
and	c
wait	i
for	c
45min	i
.	i

befor	i
the	c
beggining	i
?	c

So	c
,	c
after	c
all	c
of	c
that	c
,	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
nice	c
relaxing	c
diner	i
in	c
your	c
restaurant	c
,	i
I	c
was	c
very	c
angry	c
when	c
I	c
apeared	i
infrant	i
of	c
closed	c
doors	c
and	c
there	c
was	c
a	c
notice	c
,	i
that	c
the	c
restaurant	c
was	c
n't	c
working	i
.	c

In	c
fact	c
writing	i
to	c
you	c
just	i
with	i
one	c
main	c
reason	i
.	c

I	c
'll	c
be	c
really	c
delightful	i
to	c
resive	i
back	i
the	i
money	i
for	c
my	c
ticket	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forword	i
hearing	i
from	c
you	c
.	c

Lena	c
Jarova	c

Begin	c
at	c
the	c
begining	i
.	c

Look	c
at	c
historical	i
books	c
400-600	i
years	c
ago	c
,	c
or	c
even	c
in	i
time	i
of	c
First	i
and	c
Second	c
World	c
War	i
,	c
how	i
are	i
sociaty	i
changed	i
,	c
just	c
because	c
we	c
did	i
step	i
up	c
in	i
the	c
science	i
and	c
technology	c
.	c

In	i
one	i
hand	i
scientist	i
discovered	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
medisent	i
from	i
different	c
illneses	i
,	c
but	c
in	i
an	i
enother	i
hand	i
they	c
discovered	c
many	c
illneses	i
about	i
which	i
we	i
have	i
n't	i
herd	i
before	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
this	c
side	i
of	i
the	i
question	i
is	i
balanced	i
because	c
before	c
effect	i
on	c
our	c
health	c
was	c
less	c
than	c
it	c
is	c
now	c
.	c

However	c
technology	i
nowerdays	i
impoved	i
so	c
much	c
and	c
it	c
changed	i
our	c
life	i
a	c
lot	c
.	c

Society	c
has	c
to	c
go	c
forword	i
not	c
to	c
stop	c
on	i
one	c
place	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
I	i
want	c
to	c
give	i
you	c
the	i
thanks	i
for	c
this	c
prize	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
excited	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
won	c
a	c
prize	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
never	c
been	c
in	i
the	c
USA	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
this	c
travel	i
will	c
be	c
an	c
unforgetable	i
experience	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
will	i
like	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
that	c
I	c
can	c
only	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
in	c
June	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
my	c
final	c
exams	c
at	c
school	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
how	c
the	c
weather	c
will	c
be	c
in	c
July	c
and	c
which	i
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
wear	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
the	i
money	i
that	i
I	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
and	c
which	i
amount	c
of	c
money	c
is	c
normally	c
spent	c
in	c
the	c
camp	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
the	c
statement	c
'	c
Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
'	c
is	c
totally	c
true	c
.	c

An	c
argument	c
in	c
favour	c
of	c
this	c
statement	c
is	c
that	c
shopping	c
is	c
very	c
tiring	c
.	c

It	c
can	c
be	c
a	c
very	c
stressful	c
situation	c
because	c
in	i
some	i
moments	i
you	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
what	c
to	c
say	c
.	c

Despite	c
shopping	c
is	i
boring	c
I	i
think	c
that	c
it	c
is	c
necessary	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
important	c
for	c
people	c
to	c
have	c
several	c
clothes	i
and	c
also	c
suitable	c
clothes	c
for	c
a	c
very	c
important	c
meeting	c
or	c
appointment	c
.	c

At	i
first	i
,	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
programme	c
.	c

But	c
last	c
week	c
we	c
have	i
seen	i
an	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
.	c

This	c
presentation	c
will	c
show	c
the	c
latest	c
fashions	c
and	c
the	i
leisure	c
and	c
sports	c
wear	c
.	c

We	c
would	c
be	c
very	c
interesting	i
in	c
seeing	c
the	i
english	i
fashion	c
.	c

At	c
this	c
show	c
we	c
could	c
see	c
different	c
new	c
make	i
up	i
and	c
hairstyles	c
.	c

The	c
event	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
on	c
the	c
14th	c
of	c
March	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
free	c
for	c
students	c
.	c

It	c
will	c
stay	i
in	c
the	c
Central	c
Exhibition	c
Hall	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
not	c
too	c
far	c
and	c
the	c
openning	i
hours	c
fit	i
us	c
.	c

As	c
far	c
as	c
we	c
are	c
concerned	c
we	i
prefer	c
seeing	i
the	c
Science	c
Museum	c
rather	c
than	c
the	c
National	c
Art	c
Gallery	c
.	c

We	c
also	c
suggest	c
to	i
visit	i
the	c
Science	c
Museum	c
or	i
Wednesday	c
morning	c
and	c
the	i
afternoon	c
,	c
if	c
some	c
one	i
of	c
us	c
is	i
intersted	i
,	c
we	c
could	c
see	c
the	c
National	c
Art	c
Gallery	c
.	c

Waiting	c
for	c
your	c
answer	c
,	c
receive	i
our	i
greetings	i
.	i

For	i
the	c
class	c

This	i
improvments	i
will	c
be	c
involved	i
by	c
the	c
lack	c
of	c
petrol	c
and	c
unrecycling	i
energies	i
.	c

About	c
the	c
size	c
of	c
hous	i
,	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
in	c
cities	c
houses	c
will	c
be	c
more	c
and	c
more	c
little	i
because	c
of	c
the	i
over	i
population	i
.	c

We	c
also	i
will	i
see	c
very	c
high	i
buildings	c
which	c
contains	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
narrow	c
flats	c
.	c

In	i
opposite	i
,	c
in	c
the	c
suburb	i
or	c
in	c
the	c
land	i
,	c
more	c
and	c
more	c
rich	c
people	c
will	c
build	c
big	c
houses	c
.	c

Homes	c
like	c
this	c
will	c
be	c
build	i
with	c
the	c
latest	c
technologies	c
and	c
very	i
luxurious	c
.	c

But	c
about	c
differences	i
between	c
rich	i
's	i
and	i
poor	i
's	i
homes	i
will	i
be	c
the	c
same	c
in	c
the	c
futur	i
.	c

New	c
technologies	c
and	c
facilities	c
wo	c
n't	c
improve	c
the	c
relationship	c
between	c
people	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
really	c
disappointed	c
when	c
I	c
realised	c
that	c
the	c
actor	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
was	c
not	c
performing	c
due	i
to	i
personal	c
reasons	c
,	i
I	c
like	c
this	c
actor	c
very	c
much	c
and	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
the	c
same	c
without	c
him	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
the	c
musical	c
show	i
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
start	c
at	c
19.30	c
but	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
making	i
all	c
the	c
spectators	i
wait	c
for	c
nearly	c
an	c
hour	c
.	c

Because	c
of	c
this	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
buy	c
the	i
cheapest	c
and	c
worst	c
seat	c
available	c
.	c

As	c
if	c
this	c
were	c
not	c
enough	c
once	i
the	c
show	c
ended	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
walk	c
twenty	c
blocks	c
to	c
find	c
a	c
Restaurant	c
since	c
the	c
theatre	c
Restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
for	c
mainteneance	i
.	c

Looking	c
forward	c
to	c
receiving	c
your	c
prompt	c
reply	c
.	c

Sincerely	c
,	c

How	c
has	c
modern	c
technology	c
changed	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
?	c

Everything	c
started	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
eight	c
years	c
old	c
and	c
my	c
family	c
bought	c
a	c
Personal	c
Computer	c
,	i
I	c
did	c
n't	c
paid	i
attention	c
to	c
it	c
at	i
that	i
moment	i
but	c
as	c
soon	i
as	c
I	c
grew	c
older	c
I	c
started	c
to	c
like	c
and	c
play	c
Computer	c
games	c
.	c

The	c
years	c
went	c
by	c
and	c
after	c
buying	c
a	c
newer	c
,	c
faster	c
and	c
better	c
PC	c
I	c
found	c
myself	c
writing	c
letters	c
,	c
doing	c
School	i
homework	c
and	c
evening	i
learning	c
with	c
my	c
Computer	c
.	c

In	c
spite	c
of	c
my	c
family	c
telling	c
me	c
to	c
turn	c
the	c
PC	c
off	c
and	c
talk	c
with	i
them	c
,	c
I	c
kept	c
on	c
stucked	i
in	c
front	c
of	c
the	c
screen	c
.	c

Nowadays	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
fact	c
that	c
my	c
life	c
would	c
n't	c
be	c
the	c
same	c
without	c
my	c
PC	c
.	c

My	c
daily	c
life	c
would	c
be	c
harder	c
without	c
modern	c
technology	c
.	c

Mr.	i
Robertson	c
:	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
our	c
class	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
our	c
special	c
thanks	c
about	i
the	c
programme	c
you	c
gave	c
us	c
yesterday	c
afternoon	c
.	c

After	c
reading	c
the	c
hole	i
organized	i
programme	c
,	c
we	c
all	c
agreed	c
about	c
the	c
sightseeing	c
by	i
bus	c
around	c
London	c
wich	i
will	c
give	c
us	c
the	c
knowledge	c
about	i
this	c
fantastic	c
city	c
we	c
all	i
want	i
to	c
meet	i
since	c
time	i
ago	c
.	c

The	c
main	c
purpose	c
of	c
our	c
letter	c
it	i
's	i
to	c
explain	c
about	c
the	c
London	c

Hairstyles	c

After	c
being	i
discussing	c
,	i
we	c
want	c
to	c
suggest	c
how	c
we	c
think	c
the	c
programme	c
should	c
be	c
re-arranged	c
.	c

Instead	c
of	c
going	c
to	c
the	c
science	c
museum	c
,	c
we	c
could	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
wich	i
is	c
opened	i
on	c
Tuesday	c
,	c
march	i
14	c
from	i
10	c
am	c
to	c
19	i
pm.	i
After	c
that	c
we	c
could	c
continue	c
our	c
trip	c
as	c
it	c
had	i
been	c
arranged	c
previously	i

Best	i
Detective	c
Stories	c
of	c
Agatha	c
Christie	c
-	c
Agatha	c
Christie	c
.	c

A	c
good	c
book	c
should	c
interest	c
,	c
amuse	c
or	c
teach	c
the	c
reader	c
something	c
.	c

Not	c
only	c
because	c
she	c
's	c
famous	c
or	i
wrote	c
lots	c
of	c
books	c
,	c
but	c
she	c
knows	c
how	c
to	c
introduce	c
caracthers	i
or	i
how	c
to	c
tell	c
a	c
good	c
story	c
us	i
though	i
decieving	i
the	c
readers	c
.	c

One	c
of	c
her	c
most	c
interesting	c
and	c
famous	c
work	i
is	c
a	c
novel	c
called	c
"	c
The	c
Orient	c
Express	c
"	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
a	c
detective	c
story	c
,	c
like	c
all	c
the	c
stories	c
written	c
by	c
her	c
.	c

In	i
our	i
words	i
the	c
story	c
is	c
settled	i
on	c
a	c
train	c
wich	i
tooks	i
a	i
trip	i
along	i
the	c
orient	c
.	c

This	c
is	c
such	c
a	c
fasinating	i
story	c
or	i
it	c
's	c
the	c
way	c
Agatha	c
Christie	c
tells	c
it	c
.	c

The	c
mistery	i
is	c
kept	i
until	c
the	c
last	c
page	c
of	c
the	c
book	c
.	c

It	c
has	c
been	c
fabulous	i
experience	c
so	c
if	c
anybody	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
read	c
a	c
good	c
detective	c
story	c
,	c
try	c
to	i
read	i
Agatha	c
Christie	c
's	c
detective	c
story	c
and	c
you	c
would	i
n't	i
regret	c
it	c
at	c
all	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
terribly	c
sorry	c
but	c
I	c
would	i
notice	i
you	c
about	c
a	c
very	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
.	c

One	c
of	c
the	c
causes	c
of	c
my	c
disappointing	i
was	c
the	c
different	i
actor	c
that	c
played	c
the	i
show	c
.	c

You	c
'll	c
be	i
agree	c
with	c
me	c
that	c
45	c
minutes	c
to	i
waiting	i
for	c
the	c
starting	i
of	c
the	c
show	c
is	c
a	i
too	i
long	i
time	c
.	c

The	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
show	c
indicated	c
discounts	c
available	c
and	c
open	i
restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
in	i
this	i
way	i
.	c

of	i
who	i
?	c

For	c
those	c
reasons	c
I	c
ask	c
you	c
for	c
some	c
money	c
back	c
,	c
sure	c
of	c
my	c
good	c
reasons	c
.	c

Greetings	i

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

I	c
was	i
agree	i
to	c
buy	c
another	c
one	c
,	c
of	c
the	c
same	c
style	c
,	c
but	c
now	c
he	c
's	c
angry	c
with	c
me	c
,	c
'	i
cause	i
I	c
did	c
n't	c
say	c
anything	c
to	c
him	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
how	i
to	c
do	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
all	c
right	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
also	c
think	c
that	c
he	c
's	c
too	i
exagerate	i
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
think	c
of	i
having	i
done	c
a	i
so	i
bad	c
thing	c
to	i
broke	i
our	c
friendness	i

I	c
like	c
his	c
company	c

and	c
we	c
are	c
happy	c
when	c
we	c
are	c
togheter	i

I	c
AM	c

MY	c

THE	c
ACTOR	c
THAT	c
REALLY	c
PLAYED	c
WAS	c
DIFFERENT	i

AND	c
THIS	c
WAS	c
VERY	c
DISAPPOINTING	c

THEN	c
,	c
THE	c

AT	c
19:30	c

BUT	c
IT	c
BEGAN	c
ONLY	c
AT	c
20.15	c
!	c

I	c
HOPE	c
TO	c
HEAR	c
FROM	c
YOU	c
SOON	c
,	c

BUT	c
IT	c
IS	c
NEARLY	c
IMPOSSIBLE	c
TO	c
DEFINE	c
IT	c
OR	c
TO	c
FIX	c
THE	c
RULES	c

IT	c

SOMETIMES	c

I	c
THINK	c
THAT	c

IN	c
THE	c

WILL	c
DEVELOPE	i
ACCORDING	i
TO	i
VERY	c
DIFFERENT	c

A	c
MORE	c
FANTASCIENTIFIC	i

SURELY	c

THAT	c

FUTURE	c
ATTENTION	c
WILL	c
BE	c
FOCALIZED	i
ON	c
COMFORTABILITY	i
MORE	c
THAN	c
ON	c

BUT	c
IF	c
IT	c
IS	c
DIFFICULT	c
TO	c
FORECAST	c
THE	c

IT	c

Dear	c
Madam	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
only	c
available	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
studying	c
in	i
an	c
engineering	c
school	c
and	c
I	c
'll	c
work	c
until	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
June	c
.	c

But	c
no	c
problem	c
for	c
July	c
!	c

You	c
asked	c
me	c
which	c
accommodation	i
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
between	c
tent	i
and	c
log	i
cabin	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
used	c
to	c
spend	i
summer	c
holiday	i
in	c
tent	i
and	c
I	c
like	c
it	c
,	c
but	c
why	c
not	c
try	c
log	i
cabin	c
?	c

But	c
it	c
does	c
n't	c
matter	c
if	c
there	c
is	c
no	c
log	c
cabin	c
available	c
...	c

Now	c
let	c
's	c
speak	c
about	c
the	c
most	c
interesting	c
activity	c
:	c
sport	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
be	c
very	c
pleased	c
if	c
I	c
could	c
practice	i
tennis	c
and	c
surfing	c
.	c

In	c
fact	c
,	c
I	c
soon	i
practice	i
tennis	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
quiet	i
good	c
at	c
,	i
and	c
it	c
will	c
the	i
occasion	i
to	c
train	c
myself	i
surfing	c
is	c
completely	c
unknown	i
for	i
me	c
and	c
I	c
hope	c
that	c
I	c
will	c
like	c
it	c
.	c

But	c
if	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
try	c
it	c
I	c
will	c
never	c
know	c
if	c
I	c
like	c
it	c
or	c
not	c
!	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
wanted	i
to	c
know	c
if	c
I	c
need	c
money	i
and	c
how	c
many	i
,	c
and	c
if	c
there	c
is	c
a	c
dry	i
cleaning	i

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c

LACOSTE	c

We	c
know	i
all	i
what	c
shopping	c
is	c
.	c

You	c
think	c
that	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
enjoyable	c
at	c
all	c
.	c

Sometimes	c
it	c
is	c
necessary	c
but	c
you	c
spend	c
four	c
or	c
five	c
hours	c
in	c
the	c
supermarket	c
because	c
there	c
is	i
too	c
much	i
people	c
.	c

You	c
do	c
n't	c
like	c
shopping	c
but	c
you	c
must	c
go	c
shopping	c
to	c
eat	c
!	c

But	c
sometimes	c
you	c
go	c
shopping	c
for	c
pleasure	c
and	c
you	c
have	c
all	i
your	i
time	i
(	c
the	i
girls	i
know	i
what	i
it	i
is	i
)	c

Dear	c
Mrs.	c
Ryan	c
,	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
this	c
prize	c
and	c
the	c
fact	c
that	c
you	c
wrote	c
me	i
asking	c
for	c
my	c
preferences	c
about	c
the	c
Camp	c
.	c

Once	c
there	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
staying	c
in	c
tents	i
,	c
because	c
that	c
is	c
a	c
way	c
to	c
remember	c
my	c
childhood	c
as	c
a	c
boyscout	i
and	c
go	i
against	i
the	c
routine	c
.	c

Please	c
reply	c
soon	i
.	c

You	c
are	c
not	c
going	c
to	c
believe	c
what	c
I	c
am	c
about	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
!	c

A	c
couple	c
of	c
months	c
ago	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
told	c
that	c
Britney	c
Spears	c
was	c
coming	c
to	c
perform	c
in	c
our	c
city	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
knew	c
this	c
,	c
I	c
managed	c
to	c
get	c
a	c
job	c
as	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
kids	c
that	c
prepares	i
the	c
stage	c
during	i
the	c
concert	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
really	c
excited	c
.	c

The	c
day	c
of	c
the	c
show	c
I	c
worked	c
so	c
hard	c
that	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
see	c
the	c
spectacle	i
.	c

And	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
even	c
got	i
paid	c
.	c

I	c
found	i
my	c
reward	c
when	c
the	c
concert	c
finished	c
.	c

After	c
been	i
carrying	c
stuff	c
like	c
lights	c
,	c
microphones	c
,	c
wires	c
and	c
some	c
other	c
equipment	c
for	c
about	c
three	c
hours	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
eshausted	i
.	c

But	c
when	c
Britney	c
came	c
out	i
of	i
the	c
stage	c
,	c
she	c
passed	c
by	c
me	c
,	c
saw	c
my	c
tired	c
face	c
and	c
invited	c
me	c
to	i
her	c
personal	c
changing	i
room	i
.	c

I	c
wo	c
n't	c
forget	c
that	c
moment	c
ever	c
.	c

Write	c
me	i
soon	c
to	c
tell	c
me	c
your	c
impression	i
about	c
what	c
happened	c
to	c
me	c
.	c

With	c
love	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
,	c

I	c
have	i
received	i
your	c
letter	c
this	c
morning	c
and	c
I	c
'm	c
very	c
happy	c
for	i
this	i
first	c
prize	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
for	c
me	c
participate	i
in	c
your	c
Camp	c
California	c
because	c
normaly	i
I	c
work	c
a	c
lot	c
and	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
spend	c
money	c
to	i
travel	c
,	i
moreover	i
,	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
maintain	i
my	i
big	c
family	c
because	c
I	c
'm	c
married	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
three	c
children	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
before	c
I	i
have	c
to	c
work	c
with	c
my	c
father	c
because	c
he	c
's	c
ill	c
.	c

I	c
recognise	i
that	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
sleep	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
but	c
in	i
this	c
moment	c
I	c
have	c
a	c
little	c
problem	c
with	c
my	c
right	c
leg	c
and	c
it	c
's	c
better	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
sleep	c
in	c
a	c
bed	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
surfing	c
or	c
climbing	c
but	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
think	c
in	i
my	c
helth	i
.	c

The	i
weather	i
I	i
hope	i
will	c
be	c
good	c
so	c
I	c
suppose	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
bring	c
short	i
clothes	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

In	c
our	c
society	c
the	i
money	c
is	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
aspect	i
to	i
have	i
power	i
.	c

If	c
we	c
thing	i
about	c
,	i
we	c
will	c
realise	c
that	c
we	c
need	c
money	c
all	c
the	i
day	c
.	c

Not	c
only	c
for	c
the	c
basic	c
needs	c
but	c
also	c
for	c
the	c
rest	c
of	c
the	i
activities	c
.	c

Sometimes	c
,	c
they	c
have	c
to	c
buy	c
something	c
that	c
they	c
need	c
but	c
frequently	i
,	c
they	c
buy	c
only	i
to	c
spend	c
money	c
.	c

It	i
's	i
a	i
first	i
step	i
to	i
educate	i
the	i
youngest	i
and	c
to	i
help	i
our	c
society	c
.	c

The	i
money	i
is	c
important	c
but	c
we	c
have	c
to	c
know	c
how	c
to	c
spend	c
it	c
:	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c

I	c
'M	c

YOU	i
BECAUSE	c
I	c

HE	i

Thanks	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
happy	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
received	i
the	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
important	c
for	c
my	c
health	c
that	c
I	c
swim	c
an	c
hour	c
a	c
week	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
overwight	i
.	c

I	c
like	c
to	c
singing	i
a	c
song	c
when	c
I	c
am	c
alone	c
.	c

Singing	c
is	c
good	c
for	c
my	c
emotion	i
.	c

Also	i
I	c
choose	c
singing	c
and	c
swimming	c
as	c
my	c
activity	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
a	c
beginner	c
in	i
swimming	c
and	c
also	c
in	i
singing	c
.	c

Which	i
kind	c
of	c
weather	c
have	i
you	i
in	i
this	c
time	c

Do	c
I	c
need	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
money	c
etc.	c
for	c
different	i
excursions	c

Your	i
sincerely	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c

I	c
need	c
material	i
for	i
drinking	i
and	i
eating	i
,	i
that	i
is	c
the	c
basic	c
fact	c
that	c
I	i
must	c
go	c
shopping	c
for	c
food	c
.	c

My	c
salary	c
are	i
going	i
lower	c
than	i
lower	c
.	c

Also	c
I	c
will	c
buy	c
goods	i
which	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
need	c
.	c

There	c
are	c
many	c
goods	i
which	i
quality	i
is	c
bad	c
in	i
this	i
way	i
the	c
environment	i
pollution	c
will	c
be	i
more	i
and	i

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
,	c

However	c
,	c
there	c
was	c
a	c
different	c
unknown	i
actor	c
in	c
that	c
.	c

The	c
show	c
started	c
later	i
at	i
20:15	c
which	i
was	c
very	c
different	c
in	i
'	c
19.30	c
'	c
as	i
shown	i
.	c

There	c
was	c
no	c
discount	c
at	c
all	c
which	i
is	i
in	c
contrast	c
with	c
'	c
Discounts	c
Availabe	i
'	c
.	c

After	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
have	c
something	c
in	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
and	c
found	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	i
of	i
no	c
reason	c
.	c

The	c
real	c
show	c
on	i
it	i
owns	i
is	c
really	c
very	c
different	c
to	c
what	c
are	i
mentioned	i
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
unsatisfied	c
and	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
for	c
some	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

It	c
is	c
a	c
very	c
hard	c
thing	c
to	c
predict	c
.	c

For	i
the	c
fashion	c
of	c
the	c
future	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
depends	c
on	c
the	i
people	c
's	c
own	i
personalities	c
and	c
develope	i
their	c
own	c
styles	c
which	c
suits	i
them	c
the	c
most	c
.	c

They	c
can	c
wear	c
different	c
kinds	c
of	c
clothing	c
,	c
like	i
they	i
design	i
for	i
themselves	i
or	i
those	i
like	i
history	i
can	i
wear	i
those	i
of	i
victorian	i
time	i
and	i
in	i
different	i
countries	i
.	c

Maybe	c
paper	c
can	c
also	c
be	i
a	i
farbic	i
use	i
for	i
make	i
clothings	c
and	c
for	c
those	c
who	c
like	c
to	c
wear	c
new	c
clothes	i
everyday	i
.	c

They	c
can	c
be	c
thrown	c
away	c
after	c
wearing	i
it	c
and	i
light	c
enough	c
to	c
be	c
carried	c
around	c
whenever	c
you	c
want	c
to	c
change	i
your	c
wearing	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
fan	c
of	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
but	c
he	c
was	c
absent	c
because	c
of	i
sick	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
your	c
responsibility	i
.	c

We	c
would	c
like	c
you	c
to	c
pay	i
back	i
the	c
fee	i
of	c
the	c
show	i
and	c
pay	c
us	c
that	i
hotel	i
's	i
fee	i
as	c
well	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
recommend	c
you	c
to	i
show	i
that	c
the	c
restaurant	c
is	c
closed	c
on	c
Monday	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
not	c
have	c
dinner	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

If	c
you	c
asked	c
the	c
young	c
people	c
what	c
they	c
spend	i
their	i
money	i
the	i
most	i
in	i
,	c
most	c
of	c
them	c
would	c
answer	c
'	c
clothes	c
'	c
.	c

In	i
these	i
days	i
,	c
new	c
fashions	c
have	i
been	i
passing	i
by	i
very	c
quickly	c
.	c

From	i
my	i
point	i
of	i
view	i
,	c
young	c
people	c
tend	c
to	c
wear	c
the	i
clothes	c
which	c
they	i
can	c
show	c
their	c
skin	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
short	c
skirts	c
and	c
tops	c
like	c
an	i
under-wear	i
.	c

I	c
think	c
young	c
people	c
would	i
wear	i
smaller	i
clothes	i
which	c
they	i
look	c
like	c
almost	i
naked	c
even	c
in	c
winter	c
.	c

I	c
suppose	c
that	c
a	c
scientist	c
could	c
invent	c
new	c
kinds	c
of	c
materials	c
which	c
are	c
warm	c
and	c
thick	c
.	c

It	c
could	c
be	c
happened	i
that	c
people	c
wear	i
the	c
clothes	c
which	c
ancient	c
people	c
used	c
to	c
wear	c
,	c
like	c
skirts	c
made	c
of	c
leaves	c
.	c

Next	c
,	c
I	c
predict	c
about	i
patterns	i
of	i
clothes	i
.	c

However	c
,	c
fashion	c
changes	c
too	c
fast	c
to	c
predict	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
fashion	c
changes	c
very	c
quickly	c
so	c
that	c
people	c
are	c
interested	c
in	c
those	c
changes	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
three	i
days	i
programme	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
your	c
good	i
programme	c
,	c
especially	i
for	c
visiting	i
The	i
National	c
Art	c
Gallery	c
.	c

We	c
saw	c
an	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
and	c
our	c
class	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

It	c
starts	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
March	c
14	c
and	c
we	c
can	c
go	c
there	c
instead	c
of	c
visiting	c
the	c
Science	c
Museum	c
or	c
go	i
shopping	c
.	c

So	i
on	i
this	c
show	c
there	c
will	c
be	c
the	c
latest	c
fashions	c
,	c
leisure	c
and	c
sports	c
wear	c
,	c
make	i
up	i
and	c
even	c
hair	i
styles	i
.	c

I	c
think	c
you	c
'll	c
agree	i
that	i
we	i
have	i
changed	i
your	i
programme	i
.	c

As	c
I	c
said	c
we	c
can	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
Science	c
Museum	c
on	c
Wednesday	c
instead	c
of	c
having	c
a	i
free	c
time	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c

Bye	i

Hello	c

I	c
'm	c
going	c
to	c
write	c
about	c
"	c
The	c
Home	c
of	c
the	c
Future	c
"	c
.	c

The	c
rooms	c
will	c
be	c
much	c
bigger	c
and	c
wider	c
than	c
now	c
,	c
and	c
you	c
can	i
have	c
up	c
to	c
twenty	c
rooms	c
in	c
your	c
own	c
flat	c
,	c
and	c
even	c
swiching	i
on	c
the	c
light	c
by	c
saying	c
only	i
;	i
"	c
light	i
"	c
.	c

The	i
same	i
problem	i
will	i
be	i
with	i
homeless	i
people	i
who	i
does	i
n't	i
have	i
money	i
at	i
all	i
,	i
even	i
to	i
buy	i
a	i
food	i
for	i
themselves	i
.	c

They	c
will	c
have	c
to	c
stay	c
on	c
the	c
streets	c
as	c
streets	i
is	i
their	c
home	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
and	c
I	c
wish	i
that	c
the	c
future	c
will	c
bring	c
us	c
a	i
good	c
moments	c
of	i
life	c
where	c
everybody	c
will	c
have	c
home	i
and	c
a	i
warm	c
,	c
friendly	c
family	c
relationships	c

Last	c
week	c
,	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
London	c
in	i
your	c
theatre	c
to	c
see	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
"	c
and	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
.	c

There	i
problems	c
were	c
;	i
Firstly	i
,	c
the	c
famous	c
actors	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
were	c
n't	c
there	c
for	i
your	c
musical	i
show	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
unhappy	c
to	c
constat	i
that	c
it	i
was	i
different	c
actors	c
this	i
evening	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
the	c
show	i
of	i
19:30	i
only	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
;	c
Thirdly	i
,	c
your	c
advertisement	c
said	c
:	c
"	c
Discounts	c
available	c
"	c
;	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
the	c
case	c
.	c

Fourthly	i
,	c
the	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
for	c
renovations	i
and	c
you	c
do	i
n't	i
have	c
to	i
propose	i
us	i
to	i
go	i
.	c

Like	i
you	c
can	c
see	c
,	c
I	c
'm	c
very	c
disappointed	c
for	i
this	c
evening	c
out	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
waste	c
of	c
time	c
and	c
money	c
.	c

That	c
's	c
why	c
I	c
ask	c
you	c
to	c
give	c
my	i
money	c
back	c
.	c

I	c
ask	c
you	c
give	i
me	c
Â£	c
20	c
,	c
back	c
by	c
check	i
.	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

How	c
has	c
modern	c
technology	c
changed	c
your	c
daily	c
life	c
?	c

The	i
technology	i
is	c
the	c
future	c
,	c
and	c
the	c
present	c
.	c

For	c
instance	c
,	c
internet	i
.	c

All	i
the	i
world	c
is	c
now	c
connected	c
on	i
it	c
.	c

The	i
technology	i
means	i
too	i
,	i
every	i
electrical	c
machines	c
,	c
which	c
do	c
n't	c
stop	c
to	i
be	i
developped	i
.	c

Another	c
example	c
,	c
computers	c
,	c
every	c
six	c
months	c
,	i
something	c
better	c
is	c
discovered	i
.	c

The	i
modern	i
technology	c
has	c
changed	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
in	i
every	c
day	c
.	c

For	c
instance	c
,	c
the	i
meats	i
,	i
we	c
do	c
n't	c
cook	c
our	c
meals	c
,	c
everything	c
is	c
already	c
done	c
.	c

Five	c
minutes	c
in	c
the	c
micro-waves	i
and	c
it	c
's	c
ready	c
.	c

Dear	c
Ms	c
Clark	c
,	c

I	c
have	i
spent	i
two	c
days	c
at	c
the	c
"	c
International	c
Arts	c
Festival	c
"	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
good	c
event	c
but	c
I	c
think	c
some	c
details	i
could	c
be	c
better	c
the	c
next	c
time	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
on	c
the	c
leaflet	c
it	c
was	c
written	c
that	c
there	c
will	i
be	c
stars	c
and	c
artists	c
from	c
around	c
the	c
world	c
but	c
they	c
were	c
only	c
from	c
six	c
different	c
countries	c
.	c

Some	c
concert	c
halls	c
were	c
really	c
small	c
so	c
that	c
there	c
was	c
bad	i
air	i
and	c
not	c
enough	c
place	i
for	c
everyone	c
and	c
you	c
could	c
not	c
enjoy	c
anything	c
!	c

What	c
about	c
plays	c
and	c
films	c
?	c

But	c
do	c
not	c
worry	c
!	c

There	c
have	i
also	i
taken	i
place	i
very	c
good	c
attractions	i
like	c
dance	i
shows	c
,	c
the	c
art	c
exhibition	c
and	c
listening	i
to	i
talks	i
by	i
writers	c
,	i

The	c
reasonably-priced	c
weekend	c
ticket	c
was	c
a	c
very	c
good	c
idea	c
.	c

Please	c
tell	c
my	i
your	c
opinion	c
about	c
this	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
there	c
are	c
some	c
possibilities	i
for	c
earning	c
money	c
.	c

There	c
are	c
also	c
some	c
schools	c
which	c
offer	c
such	c
a	c
job	c
.	c

To	i
teach	i
pupils	c
is	c
not	c
easy	c
,	c
of	c
course	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
after	c
some	i
lessons	c
the	c
pupils	c
will	c
see	c
that	c
it	c
is	c
better	c
if	c
they	c
sit	c
down	c
and	c
learn	c
their	c
stuff	c
.	c

And	c
you	c
do	c
not	c
need	c
to	c
carry	c
heavy	c
things	c
or	c
have	i
stress	i
with	i
customers	c
if	i
you	c
are	i
working	c
in	c
a	c
shop	c
.	c

To	c
be	c
a	c
good	c
teacher	c
you	c
especially	i
need	c
patient	i
and	c
good	c
nerves	c
!	c

Not	c
everybody	c
has	c
the	c
ability	c
to	c
understand	c
everything	c
at	c
once	c
.	c

And	c
the	c
money	c
you	c
get	c
is	c
not	c
less	i

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
:	c
Thank	c
you	c
for	c
letting	c
me	c
know	c
about	c
my	c
prize	c
to	i
Camp	c
California	c
in	c
the	c
USA	c
.	c

Here	c
I	c
will	c
answear	i
all	c
the	c
questions	c
that	c
you	c
ask	i
me	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
will	c
ask	c
you	c
other	i
things	c
that	c
you	c
dind't	i
mention	c
.	c

I	i
'll	i
like	c
to	c
organize	c
my	c
trip	c
in	i
July	c
because	c
is	i
when	c
I	c
have	c
vacations	c
,	c
also	c
because	c
is	i
summer	i
time	i
in	c
U.S.A	i
,	i
about	i
acomodation	i
at	c
Camp	c
I	i
'll	i
prefer	c
tents	i
,	c
because	c
it	c
's	c
a	c
new	c
expirence	i
for	c
me	c
and	c
I	i
'll	i
like	c
to	c
sleep	c
in	c
tents	i
to	c
have	c
a	c
great	c
time	c
at	i
my	i
new	c
adventure	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
free	c
time	c
I	c
like	c
to	c
play	c
golf	c
and	c
swim	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
I	c
'm	c
good	c
playing	i
golf	c
.	c

I	c
play	c
every	c
saturday	i
and	c
Sunday	c
after	i
that	c
,	c
I	c
usually	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
pool	c
because	c
I	c
love	c
swimming	c
,	i
I	c
think	c
that	c
those	c
sports	i
I	c
will	i
like	c
to	c
practice	i
at	c
the	c
Camp	c
.	c

What	c
kind	c
of	c
cloth	i
we	i
have	c
take	c
?	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c

Sometimes	c
when	c
we	c
go	c
shopping	c
with	c
someone	c
who	c
is	c
not	c
a	i
good	c
company	c
,	c
we	c
usually	i
do	c
n't	c
have	c
a	c
great	c
time	c
,	c
or	c
when	c
we	c
know	c
what	c
we	c
want	c
to	c
buy	c
,	c
but	c
when	c
we	c
get	c
to	c
the	c
store	c
they	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
what	c
we	c
want	c
,	c
in	i
that	i
moment	i
we	i
neat	i
to	i
shop	i
also	i
when	i
is	i
an	i
important	i
day	i
like	i
Father	i
's	i
day	i
or	i
christmas	i
every	i
where	i
we	i
want	i
to	i
go	i
and	i
buy	i
something	i
is	i
very	c
crowd	i
so	c
we	c
ca	c
n't	c
find	c
what	c
we	c
are	c
looking	c
for	c
with	i
calm	i
because	c
everybody	c
is	c
pushing	c
you	c
to	i
the	i
other	i
place	i
that	i
you	i
want	i
to	i
go	i

In	i
that	i
cases	i
is	i
when	i
we	c
do	c
n't	c
enjoy	c
shopping	c
because	c
we	c
ca	c
n't	c
find	c
what	c
we	c
are	c
looking	c
for	c
and	c
we	c
have	c
a	c
bad	c
time	c
in	c
the	c
shopping	c
center	i
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs.	c
Ryan	c
.	i

I	c
'm	c
glad	c
to	c
receive	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

I	c
finish	c
my	c
classes	c
on	c
the	c
25th	c
of	c
June	c
and	c
August	c
is	c
for	i
going	c
with	c
my	c
parents	c
to	c
France	c
.	c

About	c
accommodation	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
the	c
log	c
cabins	c
because	c
I	c
think	c
they	c
are	c
more	i
cleaner	i
than	c
the	c
tents	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

From	c
my	c
point	c
of	c
view	c
,	c
the	c
real	c
question	c
is	c
:	c
Who	c
said	c
that	c
is	c
enjoyable	c
?	c

Sometimes	c
that	c
means	c
a	c
complete	c
tour	c
around	c
all	c
the	c
fashion	c
shops	c
in	c
town	c
.	c

And	c
of	c
course	c
,	c
we	c
are	c
not	c
allowed	c
to	c
stop	c
in	c
a	c
place	c
that	c
we	c
like	c
.	c

The	c
Sports	i
Shop	i
.	c

And	c
that	c
is	c
allways	i
what	c
we	c
want	c
.	c

That	c
's	c
men	c
's	c
intention	c
.	c

Another	c
point	c
is	c
to	c
go	c
a	i
big	c
area	c
.	c

Specially	c
week-ends	i
.	c

Everyone	c
pushing	c
a	c
trolley	c
and	c
crashing	c
around	c
.	c

People	c
should	c
have	c
to	c
take	i
a	c
license	i
to	c
drive	c
those	c
things	c
.	c

A	c
huge	c
que	i
that	c
lasts	c
half	c
an	c
hour	c
or	c
more	c
and	c
finishes	c
with	c
you	c
completely	c
freaked	c
out	c
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
for	c
me	c
to	i
go	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
enjoyable	c
at	c
all	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
inform	c
you	c
about	c
the	c
dissapointing	i
evening	c
I	c
had	c
when	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
your	c
theather	i
to	c
see	c
the	c
play	c
called	c
"	c
OVER	c
THE	c
RAINBOW	c
"	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
the	c
play	c
started	c
almost	c
an	c
hour	c
late	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
went	c
there	c
to	c
see	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
but	c
there	c
was	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
on	c
stage	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
planned	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
great	c
dinner	c
with	c
my	c
family	c
in	c
your	c
restaurant	c
and	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
the	c
people	c
who	c
work	c
in	i
were	c
on	c
holidays	i
.	c

In	c
addition	c
to	c
this	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
the	c
most	c
horrible	c
evening	c
I	c
had	i
out	i
and	c
because	c
of	c
this	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
send	c
me	c
a	c
refound	i
of	i
a	i
part	c
of	c
the	c
money	c
I	c
wasted	c
there	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
be	c
grateful	c
if	c
you	c
do	i
it	i
.	c

Your	i
sincerely	c
,	c

years	c

Student	c

and	c
the	c
career	c
I	c
have	c
choosen	i
is	c
Internacional	i
Commerce	c
or	c

We	c
also	c
have	c
five	c
computer	i
,	c
the	c
latest	c
versions	i
of	i
them	i
,	c
because	c
they	c
are	c
useful	c
for	c
my	c
father	c
to	c
work	c
and	i
for	c
me	c
to	c
do	c
some	c
special	c
works	i
for	c
University	c
.	c

This	i
machines	c
are	c
connected	c
to	c
Internet	i
,	c
and	c
it	i
gives	c
to	i
my	c
family	c
too	c
much	c
facility	i
to	i
get	i
every	i
information	i
we	c
want	c
,	c
from	c
how	c
to	c
prepare	c
son	i

to	c
what	c
was	c
the	c
result	c
of	c
the	i
Sunday	c

Apart	c
from	c

To	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
's	c
manager	c

Dear	c
Mister	i
,	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
because	c
I	c
'm	c
very	c
disappointed	c
by	c
the	c
bad	c
evening	c
I	c
spent	i
there	c
.	c

Actually	c
,	c
I	c
read	c
the	c
advertisment	i
for	c
the	c
show	c
and	c
there	c
were	c
a	c
few	c
mistakes	c
on	i
it	c
.	c

I	c
ca	c
n't	c
accept	c
waiting	c
so	c
long	c
for	c
the	c
result	c
I	c
had	c
.	c

We	c
had	c
to	c
pay	c
Â£	c
15	c
each	c
for	i
seeing	i
a	c
miserable	c
pieces	i
.	c

I	c
'm	c
sure	c
we	c
'll	c
find	c
a	c
compromise	c
and	c
I	c
'm	c
really	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
,	c
and	c
half	c
a	c
week	c
later	c
,	c
all	c
the	c
school	c
knew	c
about	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
a	c
strange	c
feeling	c
then	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
just	c
amazing	c
to	c
notice	i
how	c
money	c
can	c
attract	c
so	c
much	i
people	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
not	c
easy	c
to	c
keep	c
such	c
an	c
enormous	c
secret	c
and	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
keep	c
it	c
inside	c
of	i
me	c
.	c

I	c
became	i
quickly	i
bored	c
by	c
this	c
hypocrital	i
attention	c
they	c
had	i
for	i
me	c
.	c

They	c
did	c
n't	c
stop	c
giving	c
me	c
advice	c
or	c
telling	c
me	c
what	c
to	c
do	c
with	c
my	c
money	c
.	c

I	c
always	c
has	i
been	c
involved	c
in	c
many	c
differents	i
associations	c
,	c
which	c
are	c
fighting	c
against	c
AIDS	c
or	c
cancer	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
:	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
ask	c
about	c
your	c
advertisement	c
and	c
theatre	c
show	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
a	c
student	c
in	c
Liverpool	c
,	c
and	c
recently	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
week	c
's	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

But	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
availiable	i
.	c

However	c
the	i
show	c
started	c
45	c
minutes	c
later	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
not	c
good	c
to	i
me	c
,	c
cause	i
I	c
had	c
only	c
one	c
week	i
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

Moreover	c
the	i
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
with	c
the	c
word	c
"	c
Stuff	i
vacation	c
"	c
on	c
the	c
front	c
door	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

Could	c
you	c
do	i
me	c
my	i
half	i
of	i
money	c
back	c
.	i

I	c
enclose	c
my	c
phone	c
number	c
and	c
address	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

And	c
did	c
you	c
notice	c
something	c
about	c
fashion	c
of	c
the	c
future	c

I	c
think	c
the	c
people	c
will	c
wear	c
convenient	c
clothes	c
with	c
simple	i
design	c
in	c
the	c
future	c

Because	c
the	c
people	c
will	c
stay	c
at	c
home	c
more	c
than	c
now	c
with	c
their	c
computer	c
.	c

And	c
they	c
will	c
use	c
the	i
most	c
kinds	c
of	c
things	c
like	i
small	i
stone	i
to	i
diamond	i
etc.	i
Maybe	c
some	c
peoples	i
are	i
nakid	i
.	c

It	c
will	c
be	c
very	c
interesting	c
...	c

Just	c
imagine	c

The	c

I	c
am	c
only	c
able	c

which	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
be	i

.	c

The	c
second	c
is	c
accommodation	c
.	c

I	c
old	i
rather	c
prefer	i
stay	c
in	c
log	c
cabins	c
than	c
live	c
in	c
tents	c
.	c

I	c
quite	i
good	c
at	c
tennis	c
.	c

What	i
about	i
basketball	i
is	i
.	c

I	c
played	c
in	c
school	i
team	c
,	c
and	c
was	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
best	c
players	c
by	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
this	c
season	c
.	c

There	c
is	c
one	c
more	c
thing	c
which	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
about	c
.	c

Should	c
I	c
have	c
any	c
special	c

if	i
yes	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
wear	i
it	i
is	i
.	c

And	c
of	c
course	c
there	c
will	c
be	c
expenses	c
.	c

Can	c
you	c
inform	c
me	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
should	i
I	i
have	c
and	c
can	c
I	c
have	c
some	c
information	c
about	c
prices	c
to	i
visit	i
local	c
places	c
of	c
interests	i
.	c

At	i
the	i
end	i
I	c
would	c
like	c
ones	i
more	c
to	c
say	c
thanks	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
and	c
I	c
look	c

you	c
by	c
post	c
with	c
all	c
detailes	i
about	c
holiday	i
.	c

Yours	c
faithfyly	i

Usualy	i
people	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
time	c
for	c
shopping	c
.	c

You	c
've	c
just	c
finished	c
your	c
long	c
hours	c
at	c
work	c
,	c
you	c
tide	i
,	c
you	c
had	c
row	i
with	c
your	c
boss	c
but	c
you	c
are	c
still	c
going	c
to	c
do	i
shopping	c
.	c

There	c
are	c
huge	c
queus	i
to	c
tills	i
,	c
noise	c
,	c
hussle	i
,	c
poor	c
custumer	i
service	c
.	c

You	c
've	c
got	c
more	c
stress	c
,	c
you	c
feel	c
fed	c
up	c
and	c
finaly	i
when	c
you	c
got	i
home	c
you	c
think	c
that	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
that	i
enjoyable	c
as	c
you	c
thought	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
a	i
lot	c
of	c
people	c
do	c
not	c
like	c
to	c
do	i
shopping	c
in	c
big	c
stores	c
.	c

It	c
takes	c
hours	c
to	c
buy	c
something	c
.	c

There	c
are	c
so	c
many	c
varaity	i
of	c
products	c
,	c
different	c
prices	c
,	c
different	c
quality	i
.	c

You	c
should	i
walk	i
miles	c
around	c
store	i
to	c
find	c
what	c
you	c
wanted	i
.	c

Yes	c
,	c
there	c
is	c
big	i
plus	c
for	i
big	i
store	c
of	c
course	c
.	c

You	c
can	c
find	c
everything	c
in	c
one	c
place	c
,	c
instead	i
of	i
small	c
shops	c
which	c
is	i
specialised	i
on	i
one	c
product	c
.	c

Internet	i
is	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
issue	i
at	i
this	c
problem	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
pleased	c
to	c
hear	c
from	c
you	c
about	c
my	c
winning	c
of	i
the	c
competition	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
inform	c
you	c
my	i
preferences	c
and	c
ask	c
a	c
few	c
questions	c
about	c
the	c

.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
would	c

And	c
about	c
accommodation	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
.	c

I	c
know	c
that	c
staying	c
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
is	c
more	c
convinient	i
but	c
I	c
just	c
want	c
to	c
feel	i
wilder	i
experience	c
.	c

While	c
I	c
am	c
at	c
the	c
camp	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
enjoy	i
swimming	c
and	c
photography	c
.	c

It	c
will	c
be	c
a	c
wonderful	c
experience	c
to	c
swim	c
in	c
a	c
lake	c
and	c
I	c
can	c
relax	c
and	c
enjoy	c
fresh	i
air	c
.	c

Photography	c
is	c
one	c
of	c
my	c
hobbies	c
so	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
take	c
nice	i
photos	i
in	i
the	i
camp	i
area	i
as	i
many	i
as	i
I	i
can	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
about	c
the	c
weather	c
in	c
the	c
camp	c
area	c
because	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
what	c
kinds	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
bring	c
.	c

I	c
also	c
want	c
to	c
know	c
if	c
I	c
can	c
have	c
a	i
time	c
for	c
shopping	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
kindness	c
and	c
I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
your	c
reply	c

tourism	c
agency	c
and	c
August	c
is	c
the	c

month	c
of	c
the	c
year	c
so	i
July	c
is	c
the	c
best	c
choice	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
always	c
loved	c
camping	c
.	c

My	c
favourite	c
hobby	c
is	c
photography	c
and	c
I	c

.	c

I	c
have	c
been	c
taking	c
photographs	c
since	c
I	c

17	c
.	c

I	c
took	c
some	c
lessons	c
and	c
after	c
that	c
I	c
have	i
really	i
improved	i
it	i
.	c

I	c
used	c
to	c
play	c
in	c
high	i
school	i
's	i
team	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
never	c
been	c
to	c
California	c
before	c
so	c
I	c
have	c
no	c
idea	c
about	c
the	c
climate	c
.	c

Could	c
you	c
please	c
give	c
me	c
some	c
information	c
about	c
it	c
and	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
should	i
I	i

my	c

.	c

Besides	c

I	c
really	c
would	c

approxiametely	i
how	c
much	c
money	c

Is	c
it	c
an	c
expensive	c
city	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

As	c
you	c
know	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
busy	c
and	c
excited	c
about	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
which	c
I	c
worked	c
as	i
a	c
director	c
's	c
assistant	c
during	c
the	c
last	c
week	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
very	c
successful	c
concert	c
and	c
probably	c
you	c
have	c
heard	c
the	c
singer	c
's	c
name	c
before	c
who	i
is	c
called	c
Tina	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
quite	c
enjoyable	c
because	c
everyday	i
I	c
met	c
different	c
people	c
who	c
like	c
listening	c
the	i
pop	i
music	c
so	c
we	c
had	c
lots	c
of	c
things	c
to	c
talk	c
about	c
.	c

I	c
also	c
helped	c
the	i
singer	i
's	i
some	i
special	i
demands	i
which	c
were	c
n't	c
so	c
difficult	c
to	c
do	i
.	c

She	c
was	c
very	c
nice	c
and	c
friendly	c
.	c

At	i
the	c
concert	i
night	i
,	c
I	c
worked	c
as	c
well	c
.	c

After	c
the	c
concert	c
I	i
was	c
absolutely	c
exhausted	c
but	c
the	c
thing	c
is	c
I	c
will	c
never	c
forget	c
this	c
experience	c
.	c

I	c
met	c
lots	c
of	c
people	c
who	c
were	c
very	c
famous	c
.	c

The	c
best	c
thing	c
was	c
of	c
course	c
Tina	i
.	c

We	c
promised	c
each	c
other	c
to	c
keep	c
in	c
touch	c
and	c
she	c
has	c
invited	c
me	c
her	i
next	c
concert	c
!	c

So	c
,	c
my	i
news	i
are	i
finished	i
.	c

Write	c
me	i
back	c
soon	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
my	c
prize	c
!	c

For	c
the	c
accommodation	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
have	c
tents	i
because	c
I	c
used	i
to	i
travel	i
in	i
Campsites	i
and	c
I	c
love	c
it	c
during	c
summer	c
,	c
just	i
to	i
change	i
the	i
customs	i
!	c
!	c

Concerning	c
those	i
activities	c
I	i
have	c
choosen	i
two	c
of	c
them	c
.	c

I	c
enjoy	c
swimming	c
and	c
anytime	i
I	c
have	c
opportunities	i
to	c
swim	c
I	c
go	c
.	c

My	c
second	c
activity	c
is	c
painting	c
because	c
I	c
love	c
art	c
and	c
art	c
history	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
is	i
better	c
to	c
join	i
one	c
sport	c
and	c
one	c
"	i
soft	i
leisure	i
"	i
and	c
I	c
do	c
not	c
really	c
want	c
to	c
involve	c
myself	c
in	c
a	c
new	c
activity	c
that	c
I	c
do	i
n't	i
know	i
for	i
my	c
holidays	c
.	c

See	c
you	c
soon	c

Save	c
some	c

Singapoor	c

famous	c
for	c

a	c
friend	c
ask	i
you	c
to	c
come	i
for	i
shopping	c

it	c
should	c

jealous	c
against	i
him	c

him	c
to	c

but	c
in	i

What	c

Firstly	c
,	c
your	c
advertisement	c
said	c
the	c
actor	c
would	c
be	c
Danny	c
Brook	c

but	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
.	c

It	c
played	i
an	i
other	i
one	i
who	c
played	c
very	c
bad	i

It	c
was	c
boring	c
that	c
nothing	c
happend	i
such	i
a	c
long	c
time	c
on	c
the	c
stage	c

Did	c
you	c
know	c
that	c
you	c
have	c
no	c
discounts	c
on	c
your	c

?	c

But	c
how	c
can	i
it	i
be	i
,	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c

I	c
am	c
afraid	c

but	i
I	c
want	c

We	c
have	c
discussed	c
about	i
it	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
times	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
important	c
and	c
necessary	c
to	c
think	c
about	c
it	c
,	c
because	c
our	c
children	c
will	c
live	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
.	c

We	c
have	c
so	c
many	c
kind	i
of	c
clothes	c
and	c
fashion	i
behind	i
our	c
old	c
generations	c
.	c

They	c
just	c
look	c
funny	c
!	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
happy	c
and	c
excited	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
won	c

Portugal	c
and	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
on	c
holiday	c
just	c
in	i
next	c
july	i
.	c

Another	c
question	c
that	c
you	c
asked	c
me	c
was	c
about	c
two	c
activities	c
I	c
will	c
have	c
the	c
chance	c

n't	c
tell	c
you	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
helped	c
in	i
this	c
concert	c
just	c
by	i
a	i
chance	i
.	c

A	c
friend	c
of	c
me	i
gave	c
up	c
one	c
week	c
before	c
and	c
asked	c
me	c
if	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
in	c
his	c
place	c
.	c

I	c
said	c
"	c
yes	c
"	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
sure	c
it	c
was	c
the	c
best	c
decision	c
of	c
my	c
life	c
.	c

Of	c
course	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
tired	c
at	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
five	c
days	c
because	c
of	c
some	c
stressed	i
situations	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
these	i
days	c
were	c
unforgatable	i
to	i
me	c
.	c

Hope	c
to	c
hearing	i
from	c
you	c
soon	c

I	c
have	c
just	c
received	c
your	c
letter	c
in	c
which	c
you	c
inform	c
that	i
I	c
won	c
first	i
prize	c
of	c
two	c
weeks	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
excited	c
about	c
it	c
!	c

I	c
'd	c
rather	c
sleep	c
in	c
tents	i
because	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
enjoy	c
this	c
wild	c
experience	c
!	c

I	c
will	c
take	c
my	c
sleeping	c
bag	c
with	c
me	c
,	c
just	c
in	c
case	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
love	c
to	c
participate	c
in	c
the	c
singing	c
and	c
photography	c
activities	c
.	c

In	c
fact	c
,	c
I	c
took	c
some	c
singing	c
lessons	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
not	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
photography	c
but	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
make	c
an	c
album	c
to	c
share	c
it	c
with	c
my	c
family	c
when	c
I	c
come	c
home	c
.	c

Could	c
you	c
please	c
tell	c
me	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
do	i
you	c
recommend	c
for	c
the	i
camping	c
?	c

How	c
much	c
money	c
will	c
I	c
need	c
?	c

Is	c
it	c
better	c
to	c
take	c
cash	c
or	c
a	c
credit	c
card	c
?	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c

If	c
people	c
would	c
think	c
about	c
it	c
BEFORE	c
going	c
shopping	c
,	c
they	c
would	c
not	c
have	c
a	c
headache	c
when	c
they	c
go	c
home	c
and	c
realize	c
they	c
did	c
not	c
want	c
what	c
they	c
bought	c
.	c

Shops	c
are	c
crowded	c
,	c
items	c
are	c
of	c
bad	c
quality	c
and	c
people	c
are	c
buying	c
without	c
thinking	c

Recommendations	c

Wait	c
for	c
a	c
sunny	c
day	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
:	c

I	c
will	c
be	c
very	c
happy	c
to	c
travel	c
on	i
july	i
because	c
in	c
that	c
date	i
I	c
am	c
going	c
to	c
have	c
my	c
holidays	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
will	c
not	c
have	c
to	c
ask	c
permition	i
from	c
my	c
work	i
.	c

At	c
the	c
same	c
time	c
,	c
on	i
july	i
is	i
my	i
birthday	i
,	c
so	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
nice	c
to	c
celebrated	i
there	i
.	c

I	c
will	i
prefer	c
to	c
have	i
my	i
accomodation	i
in	c
a	c
tent	c
,	c
couse	i
in	c
that	c
way	c
I	c
can	c
feel	c
more	i
clouse	i
to	c
the	i
nature	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
can	c
remember	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
scout	i
girl	i
.	c

Sleeping	c
in	c
tent	i
is	c
much	c
more	c
exiting	i
and	c
clousy	i
than	c
a	i
log	c
cabin	c
.	c

At	c
the	c
camp	c
I	c
will	i
like	c
to	c
choose	c
two	c
activities	c
,	c
Painting	c
and	c
Singing	c
,	i
I	c
love	c
painting	c
,	i
in	i
the	i
university	c
I	c
studied	c
art	c
for	c
two	c
years	c
,	c
but	c
now	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
much	c
time	c
to	c
paint	c
couse	i
I	c
work	c
in	c
a	c
bank	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
a	c
baby	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
very	c
happy	c
to	c
improve	c
my	c
art	c
in	i
the	c
camp	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
that	c
has	c
been	c
presented	i
in	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
the	c
advertisement	c
was	i
totally	c
different	c
of	i
what	c
I	c
saw	c
there	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
the	c
actors	c
that	c
were	c
announced	c
to	i
take	i
part	c
in	c
the	c
show	c
were	c
not	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
,	c
the	c
discounts	c
were	c
not	c
available	c
and	c
the	i
principal	c
point	c
:	c
it	c
started	c
forty	i
five	i
minutes	c
later	i
.	c

Then	c
,	c
to	c
complete	c
this	c
terrible	c
night	c
,	c
the	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

Due	c
to	c
my	c
huge	c
dissatisfaction	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
,	c
as	c
you	c
do	c
not	c
make	i
what	c
was	c
advertised	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writting	i
to	c
you	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
,	c
wich	i
everything	c
was	c
completely	c
different	c
from	c
the	c
advertisement	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
disappointed	c
and	c
upset	c
with	c
the	c
show	c
I	c
saw	c
.	c

Tina	c
Truelove	c
performed	c
marvellous	i
,	c
but	c
him	c
I	i
think	c
he	c
is	c
a	c
"	c
street	c
actor	c
"	c
from	c
Covent	c
Garden	c
.	c

Even	c
worse	c
it	i
was	c
the	c
delay	c
,	i
the	i
Show	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
instead	c
of	c
19:30	c
,	c
that	i
drove	c
me	c
mad	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
a	c
student	c
visiting	c
London	c
for	c
one	c
week	c
only	c
and	c
I	c
asked	c
for	c
discount	i
ticket	c
,	i
I	c
could	c
not	c
get	c
it	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
really	c
unfair	c
,	i
I	c
paid	c
normal	i
price	c
.	c

The	c
only	c
thing	c
to	c
do	c
is	c
:	c
to	c
compensate	c
me	c
,	c
send	c
my	i
money	c
back	c
,	i
I	c
am	c
sending	c
my	c
ticket	c
for	c
that	c
:	i
Hope	c
you	c
'll	c
be	c
fair	c
with	c
me	c
otherwise	c
I	c
am	c
going	c
to	c
take	c
this	c
further	c

I	c
look	c

"	c
Techno	c
life	c
"	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
pleased	c
that	c
I	c
born	i
under	i
such	c
good	c
tecnologies	i
like	i
my	c
parents	c
did	c
n't	c
have	c
the	c
same	c
luck	c
.	c

My	c
life	c
is	c
much	c
easier	c
with	c
all	c
these	i
stuffs	i
above	i
mentioned	i
-	c
tecnology	i
and	c
science	c
.	c

Computers	c
have	c
changed	c
people	c
's	c
life	i
,	i
many	i
of	c
them	c
can	c
work	c
from	c
home	c
,	c
they	c
do	c
n't	c
need	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
their	c
offices	c
.	c

Internet	i
is	c
very	c
handy	c
,	c
you	c
can	c
buy	i
,	c
send	c
e-mail	c
messages	c
,	c
or	c
even	c
have	c
sex	c
,	c
that	i
is	c
really	c
funny	c
.	c

The	c
bad	c
side	c
is	c
to	i
use	i
tecnology	i
for	c
war	c
-	c
missiles	c
,	c
weapons	c
,	c
etc	c
....	c

Sometimes	c
I	c
think	c
tecnology	i
is	c
not	c
a	c
good	c
thing	c
....	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Ryan	c
,	c

So	c
hey	i
need	c
me	c
at	c
work	c
in	c
that	i
months	c
.	c

Because	c
,	i
at	i
first	i
when	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
little	c
child	c
we	c
were	i
staying	i
every	i
holiday	i
in	i
a	i
small	i
house	i
and	c
I	c
like	c
that	c
.	c

At	i
second	i
,	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
like	c
tents	c
and	c
I	c
do	i
n't	i
get	c
used	c
to	c
it	i
,	c
so	c
I	c
prefer	c
log	c
cabins	c
.	c

About	c
the	c
different	c
activities	c
we	i
like	c
them	c
all	c
,	c
but	c
If	c
I	c
choose	i
two	c
I	c
take	i
sailing	c
and	c
tennis	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
summer	c
I	c
'm	c
sailing	c
races	i
almost	c
every	c
weekend	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
my	c
own	c
sailing	c
clothes	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
not	c
very	c
good	c
in	i
Tennis	i
but	c
I	c
can	c
practise	c
on	c
my	c
travel	i
.	c

Which	i
things	c
I	i
must	i
paid	i
for	c
on	c
my	c
travel	i
?	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

Thanks	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

With	i
me	i
is	i
everything	i
fine	i
and	c
the	c
pop	c
concert	c
was	c
great	c
.	c

Some	c
other	c
work	c
what	i
I	c
have	i
done	i
was	c
to	c
lead	c
the	c
people	c
to	c
there	i
places	c
.	c

The	c
most	i
beautiful	i
things	c
were	c
that	c
we	c
saw	c
famous	c
singers	c
and	c
I	c
spoke	c
with	c
Robbie	c
Williams	c
.	c

He	c
's	c
friendly	c
and	c
very	c
handsome	c
off	i
course	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
very	c
nice	c
day	c
with	i
great	c
experience	c
.	c

Loves	i

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
inform	c
you	c
about	c
your	c
question	c
.	c

At	i
first	i
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
go	i
travel	c
on	i
July	c
,	c
because	c
before	c
them	i
I	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
time	c
to	c
travel	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
more	c
convenient	c
than	c
in	c
tents	c
.	c

And	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
chance	c
about	i
painting	i
and	c
photography	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
not	c
so	c
fit	c
and	c
well	i
condition	i
,	c
so	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
like	c
to	c
do	c
activitily	i
.	c

I	c
hope	c
so	c
much	i
.	c

Generally	c
many	c
women	c
would	i
like	i
the	i
shopping	c
include	i
me	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
whenever	c
you	c
go	c
shopping	c
,	c
are	c
you	c
usually	c
satisfied	c
with	c
your	c
choice	c
and	c
do	c
you	c
always	c
enjoy	c
the	i
shopping	c
?	c

You	c
could	c
go	c
shopping	c
for	c
some	c
rest	c
to	c
the	c
high	c
street	c
or	c
a	c
department	c
store	c
.	c

Moreover	c
you	i
bought	c
something	c
then	c
you	c
could	c
find	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
little	c
bit	c
expensive	i
than	c
the	c
other	c
shop	c
.	c

Both	c
cases	c
are	i
often	i
happened	i
in	i
shopping	c
.	c

Then	c
you	c
should	c
check	c
the	c
price	c
and	c
the	c
quality	c
of	c
the	c
good	i
.	c

One	c
more	c
thing	c
I	c
recommend	c
you	c
is	c
to	c
leave	c
your	c
credit	c
card	c
at	c
home	c
if	c
you	c
are	c
going	i
only	i
a	i
window	c
shopping	c

To	c

manger	c

Circle	c

Mr	c
Smith	c

Caen	c
,	c
Saturday	c
June	c
17th	c

Mr	c
Smith	c
,	c

I	c
have	c
recently	c
been	c
to	c
London	c
on	c
a	i
holiday	c
trip	i
so	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
spend	c
my	c
free-time	i
going	c
to	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
you	c
were	c
advertising	c
for	i
.	c

It	c
seemed	c
very	c
attractive	c
and	c
the	c
different	i
informations	i
on	c
the	c
ad	c
pushed	c
me	c
into	c
going	c
to	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
not	c
keen	c
on	c
liars	c
Mr	i
Smith	c
and	i
I	c
think	c
that	c
you	c
've	c
lied	c
to	c
such	i
naive	c
tourist	i
like	c
us	c
:	c
some	c
brilliant	c
actors	c
were	c
supposed	c
to	c
play	c
the	c
part	i
and	c
we	c
only	c
had	c
different	c
and	i
pityful	i
ones	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
a	c
shame	c
!	c

I	c
ought	c
not	c
to	c
talk	c
about	c
the	c
restaurant	c
closed	i
for	c
no	c
apparent	c
reasons	c

What	i
are	i
you	i
mistaken	i
us	i
for	i
,	c
Mr	c
Smith	c
?	c

We	c
did	c
not	c
deserve	c
such	c
bad	i
show	c
.	c

Otherweise	i
I	c
'll	c
have	c
to	c
put	c
some	c
others	i
ads	c
in	i
London	c
saying	c
that	c
your	c

How	c
modern	c
technology	c
changed	c
your	c
daily	c
life	c
!	c

To	c
begin	c
with	c
,	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
underline	c
how	c
the	c
place	i
of	c
technology	c
has	c
increased	c
since	i
a	c
couple	c
of	c
years	c
.	c

With	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
the	c
Second	c
world	c
war	c
and	c
the	c
economic	i
prosperity	c
many	i
goods	c
like	c
TV	i
,	c
washing-machine	i
,	c
etc.	c
became	c
cheaper	c
and	c
available	i
.	c

Nowadays	c
,	c
the	c
Internet	c
and	c
the	c
mobile	c
phone	c
with	i
the	c
developpment	i
of	c
satellite	c
seem	i
to	c
take	c
the	c
lead	c
.	c

As	c
far	c
as	c
I	c
am	c
concerned	c
,	c
the	c
first	c
way	c
modern	c
technology	c
influence	i
me	c
is	c
in	i
my	c
work	c
:	c
the	c
internet	i
has	c
become	c
such	c
an	c
incredible	c
tool	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
make	i
research	c
about	i
everything	c
I	c
want	c
,	c
find	c
informations	i
for	c
lectures	c
for	i
example	c
or	i
exercices	i
.	c

The	c
internet	c
is	c
really	c
the	c
widest	c
source	c
of	c
knowledge	c
.	c

Nevertheless	c
,	c
new	c
technology	c
has	c
made	c
me	c
become	i
more	c
lazy	c
.	c

I	c
spend	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
free	i
time	c
watching	c
TV	c
,	c
or	c
surfing	c
on	c
the	c
Internet	c
or	c
playing	c
the	i
computer	c
.	c

Maybe	c
it	c
change	i
me	c
into	c
a	c
kind	c
of	c
self-centered	i
person	c
,	c
a	c
loner	c
.	c

But	c
the	c
positive	c
way	c
new	c
technology	c
have	i
changed	c
my	c
life	c
is	c
in	c
way	i
to	i
communicate	i
.	c

It	c
made	c
it	c
possible	c
to	c
discover	c
,	c
to	c
talk	c
with	c
new	c
people	c
on	c
the	c
Internet	c
but	c
also	c
to	c
join	c
and	c
to	c
be	c
joined	c
by	c
my	c
friends	c
or	c
parent	c

that	c

Based	c
on	c
a	c
very	c

The	c

described	c
in	c
a	i

None	c

they	c
are	c
well	c
on	c
their	c

Dear	i
Sir	i
and	i
Madam	i

I	c
am	i
recently	i
spending	i
a	c
week	c
's	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
just	c
visited	c
your	c
theatre	c
to	c
see	c
a	c
musical	c
show	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
complain	c
with	i
couple	i
of	c
things	c
.	c

First	c
,	c
I	c
like	i
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
main	c
features	i
which	i
is	c
an	c
actor	c
,	i
he	i
might	c
have	i
been	i
well	c
known	c
in	c
England	c
,	c
but	c
on	c
the	c
night	c
,	c
he	c
performed	c
abysmally	c
.	c

Lastly	c
,	c
I	c
think	i
I	i
could	i
not	i
call	i
this	c
as	i
my	c
perfect	c
evening	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
for	c
a	c
refund	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
hope	c
as	c
a	i
Manager	c
of	c
London	c
's	c
newest	c
theatre	c
,	c
you	c
would	i
handle	c
the	c
situation	c
favourbly	i
.	c

Seung	c
Phittikhun	c
.	c

We	c
always	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
same	c
school	c
,	c
and	c
he	i
's	i
often	c
make	i
more	c
friends	c
than	c
I	c
do	c
,	c
and	c
everytime	i
he	i
's	i
always	i
introduce	i
them	i
to	i
me	i
.	c

Even	c
though	c
Pat	c
has	c
got	c
a	c
great	c
sense	c
of	c
humour	c
and	c
wonderful	c
personality	c
,	c
he	c
'll	c
never	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
keep	c
any	c
secreats	i
for	i
anyone	c
,	c
even	c
himself	c
.	c

Anyway	c
Pat	i
eventually	c
apologized	c
to	c
me	c
and	c
we	c
still	i
being	i
best	c
mates	c
as	c
ever	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
a	c
terrible	c
performance	c
in	c
your	c
theatre	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
expected	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
fantastic	c
musical	c
show	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
the	c
musical	c
was	c
not	c
started	c
on	c
time	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
going	c
to	c
start	c
19.30	i
.	c

However	c
,	c
It	c
was	c
started	c
45	c
minutes	c
later	c
.	c

Afterall	i
,	c
I	c
lost	i
my	c
find	i
return	c
train	c
after	c
show	i
.	c

Finally	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
perfectly	i
terrible	c
evening	c
out	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
I	c
want	c
you	c
to	c
give	i
my	i
money	i
back	i
to	i
me	i
.	c

If	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
do	c
that	c
,	c
I	c
will	c
tell	c
public	i
what	i
you	c
are	c
wrong	c
in	c
your	c
advertisement	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
yong	i
child	c
,	c
I	c
used	c
to	c
be	c
interested	c
in	c
reading	c
a	i
scientific	i
fiction	i
.	c

Interestingly	c
,	c
nowadays	c
,	c
I	c
live	c
in	c
the	c
scientific	c
world	c
which	c
I	c
read	c
in	i
the	c
book	i
.	c

Probably	c
,	c
I	c
started	c
useing	i
mobile-phone	i
5	c
years	c
ago	c
.	c

Before	c
using	c
mobile-phone	i
,	c
if	c
someone	c
wanted	c
to	c
talk	c
to	c
me	c
immediately	c
,	c
they	c
could	c
n't	c
find	c
me	i
where	c
I	c
was	c
.	c

I	c
used	c
to	c
write	c
a	c
letter	c
to	c
my	c
friends	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
After	i
appearing	i
Internet	i
,	c
I	i
've	i
sent	i
e-mail	c
to	c
my	c
friends	c
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
Because	i
of	c
modern	c
technology	c
,	c
I	c
'm	c
very	c
comfortable	c
and	c
do	i
something	c
effectively	i
with	c
computer	i
and	c
mobile	c
phone	c
.	c

First	c
I	c
can	c
travel	c
only	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
,	i
I	c
will	c
finish	c
school	c
at	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
June	c
and	c
I	c
will	c
pass	i
my	c
exam	c
in	c
Septemeber	i
;	c
so	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
repeat	i
it	i
a	c
lot	c
during	c
the	c
month	c
of	c
August	c
.	c

To	c
answer	c
your	c
second	c
question	c
,	c
I	c
choose	c
the	i
accomodation	i
in	c
tents	i
because	c
I	c
like	c
to	c
sleep	c
outside	c
.	c

For	c
the	c
activities	c
,	c
I	c
choose	c
the	c
Golf	i
and	c
the	c
Surfing	i
(	c
that	i
was	c
n't	c
easy	c
to	c
decide	c
which	c
activities	c
I	c
will	c
do	c
,	c
cause	i
almost	c
choice	i
interested	c
me	c
)	c

I	c
never	i
did	i
surfing	c
,	c
but	c
every	c
time	c
I	c
see	c
surfing	c
on	c
television	c
I	c
find	c
this	i
magic	i
.	c

I	c
have	c
just	c
two	c
questions	c
.	c

Can	c
I	c
wash	c
any	c
clothes	c
there	c
?	c

Thanks	c
for	c
all	i

Mar	c

I	c
'm	c
sorry	c
I	c
can	c
only	c
write	c
now	c
because	c
last	c
week	c
I	c
have	i
too	c
much	c
work	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
asked	c
me	c
I	c
will	c
tell	c
you	c
about	c
the	c
pop	c
concert	c
of	i
last	c
month	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
wonderful	c
week-end	i
:	c
we	c
were	c
opposite	c
to	i
the	c
singers	c
and	c
we	c
have	i
seen	i
every	c
concert	c
without	c
buying	c
any	c
tickets	c
entry	i
!	c
(	c
we	i
were	c
include	i
in	i
the	c
staff	c
of	c
the	c

)	i

For	c
next	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
could	c
not	c
buy	c
a	c
discount	c
ticket	c
as	c
you	c
mentioned	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
p.m	i
instead	c
of	c
19:30	c
p.m.	i
Thirdly	c
,	c
a	i
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
being	i
closed	c
.	c

But	c
the	c
worst	c
thing	c
is	c
the	c
actors	c
were	c
not	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove.	c
,	i
It	c
was	c
really	c
let	i
me	i
down	i
!	c
!	c

How	c
dared	i
you	i
could	i
show	i
"	c
You	i
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
"	c
in	c
you	i
advertisement	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
very	i
rediculous	i
!	c

To	c
be	c
honestly	i
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
you	c
could	i
return	i
the	c
money	c
back	i
to	c
me	c
.	c

And	c
explain	c
what	c
had	c
happened	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
you	i
return	i
back	i
.	c

Thank	c
for	i
you	i
patience	i
.	c

Your	i
faithfully	c
,	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

Although	i
,	i
Pat	c
is	c
very	c
smart	c
and	c
intelligent	c
.	c

She	c
like	i
to	c
talk	c
with	i
other	c
people	c
.	c

Lily	c
was	c
one	c
of	c
her	c
best	c
friend	i
before	i
three	c
year	i
.	c

Nick	c
was	c
Lily	i
husband	c
.	c

And	c
what	i
she	c
was	c
worried	c
.	c

Of	c
course	c
,	c
she	c
knew	c
Nick	c
did	c
n't	c
like	c
her	c
to	c
tell	c
other	c
what	i
about	c
his	c
private	c
.	i

She	c
told	c
to	i
Pat	c
that	c
she	c
did	c
n't	c
want	c
other	i
people	c
know	i
it	i
except	c
her	c
.	c

Pat	c
also	c
promised	c
not	c
to	c
tell	c
other	c
people	c
.	c

This	c
let	i
Nick	c
very	c
embrassed	i
and	c
got	i
hurt	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
they	c
got	c
seperated	i
.	c

Today	c
,	c
Pat	c
and	c
Lily	c
still	i
are	i
friend	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
only	c
July	i
because	c
I	c
would	c
be	c
in	i
schools	i
holydays	i
and	i
the	c
weather	c
is	c
hot	c
and	c
the	c
sea	c
's	c
temperature	c
is	c
less	c
cold	c
than	c
in	c
winter	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
to	c
be	c
sure	c
it	c
would	c
not	c
rain	c
during	c
the	c
trip	c
which	i
is	i
boring	i
?	c
!	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
tents	i
to	c
sleep	c
at	i
Camp	c
California	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
fun	c
to	c
sleep	c
in	c
tents	c
to	i
compare	c
in	i
a	c
house	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
very	c
nice	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
tents	c
wich	i
are	c
strong	c
and	c
confortable	i
.	c

From	c
the	c
list	c
below	c

the	c
two	c
activities	c
I	c
will	c
choose	c
are	c
Tennis	i
and	c
sailing	c
.	c

Tennis	c
because	c
I	c
play	c
Tennis	i
and	c
I	c
am	c
classed	c
15-5	c
.	c

But	c
you	c
ca	c
n't	c
play	c
if	c
there	c
is	c
too	c
much	c
wind	c
,	c
the	i
ball	c
becomes	c
incontrolable	i
!	c

You	c
can	c
do	c
it	c
alone	c
.	c

I	c
like	c
windsurfing	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
sport	c
of	c
speed	c
and	c
slide	i
like	c
skiing	c
,	i
surfing	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
questions	c
:	c
Must	i
I	c
take	c
with	i
me	i
my	i
clothes	i
?	c

Is	c
there	c
a	c
washing	c
machine	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
?	c

Do	c
I	c
need	c
some	c
money	c
to	c
pay	c
the	i
meals	c
!	c

you	i
have	c
recently	c
had	c
a	c
class	c
discussion	c
about	c
shopping	c
.	c

In	c
fact	c
,	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
because	c
sometimes	c
you	c
want	c
to	c
buy	c
articles	i
but	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
enough	c
money	c
!	c

You	c
do	c
n't	c
find	c
anything	c
interesting	c
in	c
the	c
shop	c
.	c

The	c
seller	i
can	c
be	c
not	c
very	c
nice	c
and	c
watch	c
you	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
.	c

The	c
article	i
can	c
be	c
too	c
expensive	c
.	c

Your	i
must	c
test	i
several	c
shops	c
and	c
compare	c
the	c
price	c
,	i
the	c
quality	c
of	c
the	c
articles	i
.	c

So	c
you	c
must	c
walk	c
all	c
the	i
day	c
or	c
go	c
by	c
car	c
.	c

Dear	c
Madam	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
glad	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
and	c
I	c
can	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
United	c
States	c
.	c

It	c
has	c
always	c
been	c
my	c
dream	c
to	c
go	c
there	c
and	c
to	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
see	c
that	c
beautifull	i
country	c
.	c

Now	c
my	c
dream	c
will	c
come	c
true	c
.	c

It	c
will	c
be	c
very	c
interesting	c
for	c
me	c
because	c
normaly	i
I	c
have	i
not	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
time	c
to	c
do	c
activities	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
swimming	c
because	c
I	c
very	i
like	c
it	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
trying	c
to	c
swim	c
anywhen	i
I	c
have	c
got	c
some	c
time	c
,	c
and	c
painting	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
finished	c
painting	i
course	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
some	c
practice	c
with	c
this	c
.	c

Hallo	c
Kim	c
,	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
answer	i
on	i
my	c
last	c
letter	c
,	c
I	c
hope	c
your	c
sister	c
's	c
health	c
is	c
better	c
than	c
on	i
last	c
time	c
and	c
she	c
is	c
all	c
right	c
.	c

My	c
life	c
is	c
a	c
little	c
bit	c
changed	c
after	c
that	c
concert	c
on	i
last	c
month	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
realy	i
wonderfull	i
new	c
experience	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

Now	c
I	c
now	i
that	c
everything	c
need	i
patient	i
,	c
time	c
and	c
hard	c
work	c
before	c
someone	c
will	i
sing	i
any	c
record	c
on	c
scene	i
.	c

The	c
people	c
were	c
wonderfull	i
,	c
they	c
was	i
helping	c
each	c
other	c
with	c
everything	c
and	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
lot	c
of	i
easier	c
to	c
do	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
very	i
nice	c
feeling	c
when	c
you	c
need	c
help	c
and	c
is	i
so	c
many	c
people	c
which	i
want	c
to	c
help	c
you	c
.	c

I	c
will	c
never	c
forget	c
this	c
concert	c
and	c
those	c
people	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
good	c
experience	c
which	c
I	c
will	c
never	c
forget	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
again	c
.	c

At	c
first	c
when	c
I	c
came	c
I	c
hoped	c
to	c
see	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
on	c
the	c
stage	c
,	c
but	c
there	c
was	c
totally	i
different	c
actor	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
not	i
still	i
very	c
disappointed	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
hoped	c
that	c
I	c
will	i
have	c
a	c
good	c
meal	c
with	c
glass	i
of	c
wine	c
in	c
the	c
restaurant	c
,	c
according	i
to	c
your	c
advertisment	i
but	i
what	c
did	i
I	i
realised	i
,	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
,	c
because	c
the	c
chef	c
was	c
in	c
the	i
hospital	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

Everyday	i
we	c
keep	c
in	c
touch	c
with	i
technology	c
.	c

We	c
have	c
microwaves	c
that	c
help	c
us	c
to	c
do	i
our	c
meal	i
quickly	c
,	c
we	c
have	c
hairdryers	c
to	c
dry	c
our	c
hair	c
in	c
15	c
minutes	c
,	c
we	c
have	c
different	c
things	c
that	c
made	i
our	c
life	i
easier	c
.	c

Such	c
as	c
mobile	i
phone	c
that	c
helps	c
me	c
to	c
communicate	c
,	i
with	c
anyone	c
in	c
the	c
world	c
,	c
even	c
if	c
I	c
am	c
not	c
at	c
home	c
,	i
I	c
use	c
stereo	i
,	i
if	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
listen	c
to	c
my	c
favourite	c
music	c
,	i
I	c
use	c
tapes	c
,	c
CDs	c
,	c
hairdryers	c
,	c
ect	i
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
all	c
these	c
things	c
made	i
my	c
life	c
much	c
easier	c
.	c

Many	c
years	c
ago	c
people	c
did	c
n't	c
have	c
an	c
oppotunity	i
to	c
use	c
all	c
these	c
things	c
and	c
they	c
had	c
to	c
work	c
a	c
lot	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
happy	c
that	c
with	c
all	c
technology	i
that	c
we	c
have	c
we	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
to	c
work	c
as	c
much	c
as	c
they	c
did	c
,	c
like	i
to	i
wash	i
plates	c
and	c
cups	c
after	c
meals	c
,	i
my	i
dishwashing	i
machine	i
will	c
do	c
that	c
for	c
me	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
to	c
wash	c
my	c
clothes	c
my	i
washing	c
machine	c
does	c
it	c
better	c
.	c

Of	c
course	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
bit	c
sad	c
that	c
machinery	c
is	c
taking	c
over	c
humans	i
and	c
of	c
course	c
it	c
makes	c
me	c
lazy	c
.	c

However	c
now	i
I	c
have	c
more	c
freedom	c
,	c
free	c
time	c
,	c
and	c
privacy	c
.	c

Dear	c

if	c

is	c
a	c
called	i

That	i

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c

I	c
went	c
out	c
for	i
shopping	c
and	c
to	c
get	c
some	c
ideas	c
about	c
new	c
brand	i
computers	c
and	c
products	i
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
I	i
went	c
to	c
a	c
local	c
shop	c
but	c
I	i
could	i
n't	i
find	i
enough	c
selection	c
of	c
products	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
very	c
crowded	c
,	c
I	c
could	c
hardly	c
walk	i
in	c
the	c
shop	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
approached	c
to	i
the	c
cashier	c
I	c
suddenly	c
noticed	c
my	c
wallet	c
had	c
gone	c
.	c

My	c
money	c
,	c
travel	c
card	c
and	c
credit	c
card	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
nightmare	c
there	i
were	c
pickpokets	i
in	c
the	c
shop	c
.	c

I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
shop	i
assistance	i
but	c
it	c
was	c
useless	c
.	c

As	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c
I	i
phoned	c
to	i
my	c
bank	c
for	i
cancelation	i
of	i
my	c
credit	c
card	c
but	c
they	c
had	c
already	c
used	c
it	c
.	c

But	c
you	c
must	c
be	i
always	i
award	i
against	c
to	i
pickpokets	i

I	c

why	c
but	c
I	c
have	c
feel	i
toward	i
to	i
tent	i
from	i
my	c
childhood	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
was	c
kid	i

my	c
mum	c
to	c
buy	c
me	c
a	c
tent	c
for	c
my	c
bedroom	c
to	i

was	c
high	i
school	c

Your	c

I	c
ca	c
n't	c

I	c

It	c

There	c

a	c
lot	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Ryan	c
,	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

The	c
only	c
time	c
that	c
is	i
possible	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
travel	c
is	c
July	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
working	c
for	c
a	c
bank	c
and	c
this	c
is	c
the	c
only	c
month	c
I	c
can	c
go	c
on	c
holiday	c
.	c

Last	c
but	c
not	c
least	c
there	c
are	c
some	c
things	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
:	c
What	c
kind	c
of	c
wheather	i
do	c
you	c
have	c
in	c
California	c
?	c

And	c
what	c
about	c
money	c
?	c

And	c
my	c
last	c
question	c
:	c
how	c
many	c
persons	i
are	c
going	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
each	c
tent	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Many	c
people	c
,	c
especially	c
women	c
,	c
love	c
shopping	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
centre	c
of	c
every	i
big	c
town	c
you	c
will	c
see	c
people	c
walking	c
from	c
store	c
to	c
store	c
searching	c
for	c
something	c
to	c
wear	c
or	c
to	c
buy	c
to	c
eat	c
.	c

But	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

Very	c
often	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
what	c
to	c
buy	c
because	c
we	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
only	c
three	c
or	c
four	c
different	c
sport	i
shoes	c
to	c
choose	c
from	c
,	c
not	i
,	c
we	c
have	c
to	c
choose	c
out	c
of	c
twenty	c
or	c
thirty	c
such	c
as	c
Nike	c
,	c
adidas	i
or	c
Fila	c
.	c

Another	c
cause	i
is	c
that	c
shops	c
and	c
stores	c
are	c
often	c
overcrowded	c
.	c

Very	c
often	c
you	c
can	c
hardly	c
move	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
crowds	c
of	c
people	c
.	c

Of	c
course	c
there	c
are	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
other	c
causes	i
why	c
shopping	c
is	c
n't	c
always	c
great	c
fun	c
,	c
but	c
the	c
last	c
cause	i
,	c
which	c
is	c
very	c
important	c
for	c
me	c
is	i
that	c
shopping	c
is	c
becoming	c
more	c
and	c
more	c
impersonal	c
.	c

That	c
is	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
reason	c
why	c
I	c
only	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
shopping	c
in	c
little	i
stores	c
,	c
where	c
I	c
have	c
peace	c
and	c
quiet	c
and	c
very	c
often	c
nothing	c
to	c
complaine	i
about	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
Brown	c
,	c
I	c
'm	c
writing	c
this	c
letter	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
that	c
I	c
saw	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
very	c
disappointed	c
for	i
all	c
these	c
problems	c
!	c

Your	c
theatre	c
is	c
very	c
disorganized	c
!	c

After	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
eat	c
something	c
,	c
but	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
the	c
chef	c
was	c
in	c
Italy	c
for	c
a	c
special	c
course	c
.	c

I	c
had	i
n't	i
a	i
great	c
fun	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
ask	c
for	c
money	i
back	c
.	c

Your	i
faithfully	c

In	c
fact	c
,	c
some	c
days	c
before	c
Karin	c
,	c
a	c
friend	c
of	c
hers	c
,	c
had	c
told	c
Pat	c
that	c
she	c
had	c
fallen	c
in	c
love	c
with	c
John	c
,	c
her	c
science	i
's	i
teacher	c
.	c

The	c
teacher	c
was	c
40	c
years	c
old	c
,	c
and	c
Karla	c
was	c
only	c
16	c
(	c
years	c
old	c
)	c
.	c

This	c
age	i
's	i
difference	c
was	c
too	c
big	c
!	c

So	c
she	c
decided	c
to	c
tell	c
Hill	c
all	i
the	i
story	i
.	c

But	c
the	c
situation	c
was	c
n't	c
simple	c
,	c
so	c
Hill	c
decided	c
to	c
discuss	c
it	c
with	c
Mary	c
,	c
the	c
teacher	c
's	c
cousine	i
.	c

They	c
agreed	c
that	c
Karla	c
's	c
love	c
was	c
only	c
a	c
dream	c
.	c

So	c
they	c
went	c
to	c
talk	c
with	c
her	c
about	c
the	c
situation	c
,	c
but	c
when	c
she	c
knew	c
that	c
they	c
had	i
know	i
her	c
feelings	c
to	i
Mr.	c
Beek	c
,	c
she	c
decided	c
not	c
to	c
tell	c
Pat	c
anything	c
forever	i
.	c

I	c
write	i
to	c
you	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
dreadful	c
evening	c
I	c
had	c
when	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
see	c
your	c
show	c
at	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
the	i
9th	c
june	i
.	c

They	c
were	c
replaced	c
by	c
some	c
unknown	c
actors	c
who	c
had	c
certainly	c
never	c
performed	c
a	i
musical	c
.	c

If	c
I	c
had	c
only	c
one	c
reason	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
for	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
;	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
the	i
latter	i
.	c

But	c
to	c
add	c
to	c
this	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
make	i
a	c
long	c
queue	c
to	c
get	c
a	c
full	i
price	i
ticket	c
when	c
instead	i
I	c
had	c
brought	c
my	c
student	c
card	c
on	i
the	c
purpose	c
of	c
getting	c
a	i
discount	c
which	c
had	c
been	c
advertised	c
but	c
did	c
n't	c
in	c
fact	c
exist	c
.	c

The	c
show	c
which	c
was	c
to	c
start	c
at	c
19.30	c
only	c
began	c
at	c
20.15	c
and	c
therefore	c
me	i
and	c
my	c
friends	c
were	c
n't	c
able	c
to	c
find	c
a	c
restaurant	c
when	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
because	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
on	i
sanitary	c
reasons	c
.	c

For	c
this	c
deceiving	i
and	c
uncorrect	i
advertisement	c
and	c
for	c
all	c
the	c
given	c
reasons	c
,	c
I	c
ask	c
you	c
for	c
an	i
average	i
refund	c
of	c
five	c
pounds	c
per	c
ticket	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

This	c
feature	i
did	c
n't	c
allow	c
you	c
to	c
tell	c
him	c
much	c
about	c
yourself	c
.	c

He	c
was	c
n't	c
really	c
wicked	c
,	c
he	c
merely	c
did	c
n't	c
understand	c
to	i
keep	c
his	c
mouth	c
shut	c
,	c
especially	c
at	c
school	c
where	c
every	c
little	c
unimportant	c
thing	c
about	c
your	c
so	i
called	i
"	c
private	c
life	c
"	c
runs	c
three	c
laps	c
around	c
the	c
schoolyard	c
before	c
you	c
learn	c
it	c
although	c
you	c
are	c
the	c
most	c
concerned	c
about	c
it	c
and	c
did	c
n't	c
even	c
know	c
.	c

But	c
small	i
drama	c
can	c
grow	c
up	i
as	c
children	c
are	c
very	c
sensitive	c
.	c

I	c
believe	c
this	c
is	c
a	c
rule	c
of	c
society	c
,	c
it	c
's	c
a	c
sort	c
of	c
group	c
behaviour	c
,	c
and	c
belongs	c
to	c
the	i
childhood	c
and	c
the	c
teenage	c
.	i

We	c
all	c
speak	c
or	c
have	c
spoken	c
of	c
our	c
neighbours	c
,	c
family	c
,	c
classmates	c
,	c
workmates	c
,	c
friends	c
in	c
bad	c
terms	c
.	c

According	i
to	i
me	i
what	c
is	c
more	c
to	i
regret	i
is	c
when	c
now	i
we	c
full-growns	i
continue	c
to	i
act	i
with	i
this	c
bad	c
habit	c
.	c

The	c
criticism	i
spirit	c
has	c
to	c
be	c
preserved	c
but	c
we	c
must	c
keep	c
our	c
secrets	c
.	c

What	c
allows	c
us	c
to	c
reveal	c
parts	c
of	c
someone	c
others	i
privacy	i
,	i
nothing	i
.	c

Dear	c
Ms	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
really	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
it	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
been	c
to	c
the	c
U.S.A.	c
before	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
have	c
my	c
two	c
weeks	c
with	c
you	c
in	c
July	c
,	c
as	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
during	c
my	c
summer	c
holiday	i
in	i
addition	c
that	i
it	i
is	c
said	c
to	c
be	c
the	c
best	c
season	c
there	c
.	c

Both	c
of	c
them	c
are	c
my	c
hobbies	c
,	i
I	c
have	c
won	c
some	c
prizes	c
in	c
my	c
school	c
competition	i
of	i
them	c
.	c

Therefore	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
quite	c
confident	c
about	c
them	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
be	c
grateful	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
put	c
me	c
into	c
the	c
tent	i
side	i
of	i
accomodation	i
because	c
I	c
have	c
had	c
all	c
holidays	i
with	c
my	c
parents	c
in	c
luxury	c
hotels	c
before	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
try	c
it	c
this	c
time	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
in	c
due	c
course	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

The	c
concert	c
I	c
helped	c
last	i
week	c
was	c
the	c
greatest	c
experience	c
I	c
've	c
ever	c
had	c
.	c

I	c
mainly	c
gave	c
them	c
a	c
hand	c
in	c
setting	c
up	c
the	c
stage	c
.	c

I	c
left	c
the	c
hi-fi	i
system	i
on	c
the	c
left	c
side	c
(	c
it	c
should	c
be	i
on	c
the	c
other	c
side	c
)	c
.	c

Before	c
opening	i
,	c
the	c
pop	c
star	c
found	i
the	c
mistake	c
,	i
otherwise	i
it	c
would	c
be	i
a	c
disaster	c
.	c

The	c
performer	c
,	c
Paul	c
,	c
is	c
a	c
big	c
music	i
name	c
at	c
the	c
present	c
.	c

I	c
told	c
him	c
I	c
loved	c
his	c
songs	c
,	i
he	i
was	c
very	c
happy	c
.	c

Anyway	c
,	c
how	c
are	c
you	c
?	c

Write	c
soon	c
,	i
tell	i
me	c
how	c
you	c
're	c
getting	c
on	c
in	c
your	c
new	c
job	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

Last	c
week	c
I	c
bought	c
some	c
tickets	c
to	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
,	c
thinking	c
that	c
I	c
would	c
have	c
a	c
perfect	c
evening	c
,	c
like	i
its	c
advertisement	c
tell	i
us	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
terrible	c
evening	c
.	c

At	c
first	c
I	c
became	c
worried	c
because	c
there	c
was	i
n't	i
any	c
discounts	c
available	c
,	c
like	i
your	c
advertisement	c
say	i
.	i

It	c
's	c
necessary	c
to	c
start	c
on	c
time	c
,	c
and	c
your	c
paper	i
was	i
informing	i
that	i
it	c
would	c
begin	c
at	c
19:30	c
.	c

It	c
did	c
n't	c
happen	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
this	c
show	c
,	c
and	c
to	c
ask	c
for	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
your	c
answer	c
.	c

Cordially	c
,	c

And	c
because	c
of	c
that	c
,	c
everyone	c
at	c
school	c
happened	i
to	c
know	c
that	c
Ali	c
was	c
dating	c
Nick	c
,	c
that	i
used	i
to	i
be	i
Caroline	c
's	c
boyfriend	c
at	c
the	c
time	c
.	c

Pat	c
was	c
Ali	c
's	c
best	c
friend	c
,	c
and	c
because	c
of	c
that	c
,	c
Ali	c
told	c
her	c
that	c
she	c
was	c
going	c
out	c
with	c
Caroline	c
's	c
boyfriend	c
,	c
but	c
asked	c
her	c
to	c
keep	c
the	i
secret	c
.	c

One	c
week	c
later	c
,	c
everyone	c
at	c
school	c
started	c
to	c
laugh	c
at	c
Caroline	c
and	c
look	c
down	c
on	c
Ali	c
and	c
Nick	c
.	c

Caroline	c
discovered	c
everything	c
,	c
and	c
argued	c
with	c
the	c
infidel	i
couple	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
big	c
quarrel	c
,	c
people	c
that	c
were	c
many	c
meters	i
distant	i
could	c
hear	c
it	c
.	c

Poor	c
Ali.	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
it	c
's	c
very	c
important	c
to	c
be	c
a	c
person	c
than	i
can	c
keep	c
secrets	c
,	c
even	c
your	c
own	c
secrets	c
,	c
or	c
a	c
friend	c
's	c
one	c
.	c

One	c
of	c
the	c
most	c
beautiful	c
things	c
on	i
the	c
world	c
is	c
the	i
true	c
and	c
loyal	c
friendship	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
,	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
this	c
letter	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
a	c
musical	c
show	c
which	c
I	i
've	i
seen	i
on	i
last	c
Saturday	c
.	c

I	c
went	c
to	c
London	c
to	c
see	c
this	c
musical	c
but	c
I	c
was	c
absolutely	c
dissapointed	i
about	i
the	c
show	c
.	c

I	c
got	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
at	c
18:30	c
because	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
drink	i
before	c
I	c
get	i
to	c
the	c
hall	c
so	c
I	c
got	c
there	c
earlier	c
.	c

The	c
show	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
start	c
at	c
19:30	c
but	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
about	c
fourty	c
five	c
minutes	c
later	c
than	c
original	i
starting	c
time	c
.	c

I	c
liked	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
so	c
much	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
expecting	c
to	c
see	c
him	c
but	c
you	c
did	c
n't	c
even	c
mention	c
about	i
that	i
actor	c
was	c
going	c
to	c
change	i
to	c
another	c
guy	i
.	c

After	c
finished	i
watching	c
the	c
show	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
restaurant	c
which	c
you	c
advertised	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
about	c
21:00	c
,	c
I	c
thought	c
it	c
was	c
bit	i
later	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
my	c
falt	i
anyway	c
.	c

The	c
show	c
was	c
finished	c
at	c
21:00	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
so	i
upset	c
to	c
say	c
anything	c
anymore	c
and	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
get	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
which	c
I	c
paid	c
for	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
before	c
I	c

Nowadays	c
,	c
we	c
have	c
millions	c
styles	i
of	c
fashion	c
and	c
every	c
single	c
person	c
has	c
their	c
own	c
fashion	c
.	c

Fashion	c
became	i
a	c
part	c
of	c
our	c
life	c
and	c
some	c
people	c
think	c
that	c
what	c
clothes	c
you	c
wear	c
is	c
most	i
important	c
thing	c
.	c

A	i
100	c
years	c
ago	c
,	c
people	c
wear	i
much	i
more	i
diffrently	i
.	c

Women	c
worn	i
dresses	c
and	c
men	c
worn	i
suits	c
in	c
England	c
.	c

Fashion	c
keeps	c
changing	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
people	c
will	c
wear	c
metal	c
clothes	c
like	c
Robotcap	i
.	c

The	c
enviroment	i
will	c
be	c
very	c
polluted	c
and	c
finally	c
we	c
'll	c
get	c
desease	i
.	c

May	i
be	i
,	c
science	c
will	c
be	c
developed	c
and	c
make	c
our	c
enviroment	i
clean	c
,	c
we	i
will	c
not	c
wear	c
anything	c
at	c
all	c
!	c
!	c
!	c
(	c
except	c
under	i
wear	i
)	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
that	c
the	c
enviroment	i
will	c
be	c
better	c
than	c
now	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
and	c
our	c
fashion	c
will	c
be	c
changed	c
but	c
nobody	c
knows	c
how	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
.	c

We	c
should	c
try	c
hard	c
to	c
create	c
new	c
fashion	c
and	c
suitable	c
fashion	c
in	c
further	i
days	i
.	c

Dear	c
Jane	c
Clark	c

I	c
went	c
the	i
international	c
arts	c
festival	c
which	c
you	c
organized	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
may	c
I	c
give	c
you	c
my	c
suggestions	c
and	c
opinions	c
?	c

I	c
think	c
the	c
International	c
Arts	c
Festival	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
idea	c
!	c

But	c
the	c
stars	c
and	c
artists	c
who	c
are	c
from	c
around	c
the	c
world	c
were	c
from	c
only	c
six	c
countries	c
.	c

And	c
some	c
concert	c
halls	c
were	c
too	c
small	c
,	c
so	c
you	c
had	c
better	c
have	c
larger	c
concert	c
halls	c
and	c
also	c
you	c
had	c
better	c
have	c
more	c
plays	c
and	c
films	c
in	i
the	i
next	c
year	c
than	c
this	c
year	i
's	i
.	c

I	c
think	c
the	c
idea	c
of	c
one	c
reasonably	i
-	i
priced	i
weekend	c
ticket	c
for	c
all	c
events	c
is	c
excellent	c
!	c

Because	c
it	c
does	i
not	c
complex	c
,	c
also	i
we	i
do	i
n't	i
confuse	i
.	c

If	c
you	c
can	c
improve	c
these	c
points	c
,	c
your	c
festival	c
must	i
be	c
better	c
than	c
this	c
year	c
's	c
.	c

Dear	c
Johnny	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

Anyway	c
,	c
you	c
want	c
to	c
know	c
about	c
rules	c
at	c
home	c
and	c
school	c
in	c
my	c
country	c
,	c
do	c
n't	c
you	c
?	c

My	c
school	c
's	c
rules	c
are	c
n't	c
strict	c
.	c

We	c
are	c
allowed	c
many	i
things	c
.	c

Of	c
course	c
we	c
can	c
go	c
out	c
the	i
classroom	c
in	i
any	c
time	c
.	c

Also	c
,	c
there	c
is	c
one	c
strict	c
rule	c
at	c
my	c
home	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
come	c
back	c
my	i
house	c
until	i
11	c
o'clock	c
at	c
night	c
.	c

Love	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
,	c

As	c
a	c
result	c
our	i
evening	c
was	c
completely	c
spoiled	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
am	c
sure	c
you	c
will	c
understand	c
why	c
I	c
so	i
annoyed	c
and	c
frustrated	c
with	c
the	c
whole	c
incindent	i
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

Her	c
father	c
had	c
met	c
another	c
woman	c
who	c
had	i
not	i
been	i
as	c
pretty	c
as	c
Maria	c
's	c
mother	c
but	c
worked	c
in	c
a	c
bank	c
and	c
had	c
a	c
good	c
salary	c
.	c

One	c
day	c
Maria	c
and	c
her	c
mother	c
returned	c
home	c
and	c
found	c
a	c
letter	c
.	c

All	c
fathers	i
things	c
were	c
missing	c
.	c

They	c
could	c
not	c
believ	i
their	c
eyes	c
.	c

They	c
read	c
the	c
letter	c
and	c
slowly	c
went	c
onto	i
the	c
kitchen	c
.	c

Maria	c
bought	i
his	c
favorite	i
food	c
and	c
she	c
throw	i
it	c
away	i
into	c
the	c
bin	c
.	c

How	c
he	i
could	i
have	c
done	c
it	c
to	c
them	c
?	c

They	c
had	c
gone	c
everywhere	c
together	c
and	c
laughed	c
a	c
lot	c
.	c

Now	c
everything	c
was	c
over	c
.	c

She	c
went	c
to	c
skool	i
,	c
but	c
she	c
could	c
not	c
pick	i
the	i
material	i
up	i
as	c
easy	i
as	c
she	c
used	c
to	c
.	c

So	c
she	c
decided	c
to	c
tell	c
Pat	c
,	c
her	c
lovely	c
Pat	c
.	c

Now	c
everyone	c
knows	c
about	c
her	c
sad	c
story	c
that	i
makes	c
her	c
feel	c
even	c
more	i
worse	i
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
because	i
of	i
the	i
equipment	i
mentenance	i
.	c

You	c
should	c
have	c
let	c
us	c
know	i
such	i
information	c
in	c
advance	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
although	c
I	c
heard	c
the	i
student	c
discount	c
ticket	c
was	c
available	c
,	c
the	c
ticket	c
salesman	c
said	c
I	c
should	c
have	c
bought	c
it	i
at	c
least	c
one	c
day	c
before	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
not	c
satisfied	c
with	c
your	c
show	c
at	c
all	c
.	c

Therefore	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
you	c
should	c
pay	i
some	i
money	i
back	i
for	i
me	i
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
modern	c
technology	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
modern	c
technology	c
has	c
changed	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
,	c
especially	c
in	i
communication	c
with	c
my	c
best	c
friend	c
who	i
is	c
studying	c
in	c
Britain	c
.	c

We	c
had	i
seen	i
each	c
other	c
once	c
a	c
week	c
before	c
she	c
left	c
Japan	c
for	c
Britain	c
.	c

I	c
used	c
to	c
think	c
I	c
would	c
miss	c
her	c
.	c

But	c
now	c
I	c
can	c
communicate	c
with	c
her	c
every	c
day	c
by	c
e-mail	c
.	c

Without	c
a	c
computer	c
and	c
a	c
telephone	c
,	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
contact	c
her	c
easily	c
and	c
I	c
may	i
lose	c
touch	c
with	c
her	c
.	c

in	i
addittion	i
,	c
I	c
could	i
go	c
tot	i
Britain	c
to	i
see	i
her	i
by	i
plane	i
.	c

In	i
present	c
,	c
it	c
takes	c
just	c
12	c
hours	c
by	c
plane	c
.	c

Thanks	c
to	c
such	c
modern	c
technology	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
improve	c
the	i
relationship	c
with	c
my	c
friend	c
,	c
even	c
if	c
she	c
is	c
living	c
away	i
from	c
me	c

You	c

How	i

ends	i
and	c
I	c
will	c
be	c

I	c
would	c

Dear	c
Kim	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
about	c
my	c
experience	c
last	c
month	c
.	c

I	c
did	c
many	c
different	c
kinds	c
of	c
things	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
I	c
helped	c
with	c
the	c
decoration	c
of	c
the	c
place	c
where	c
the	c
consert	i
would	c
take	c
place	c
.	c

After	c
that	c
I	c
helped	c
the	c
singers	c
perform	c
and	c
dance	c
together	c
and	c
finally	c
I	c
helped	c
with	c
the	c
lights	c
for	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
amazing	c
!	c
(	i
the	i
show	i
)	i

I	c
had	c
a	c
really	c
great	c
time	c
working	c
with	c
all	c
the	c
pop	c
singers	c
and	c
dancers	c
and	c
decorators	i
I	i
even	c
met	c
some	c
very	c
interesting	c
people	c
with	c
who	i
made	i
really	c
good	c
friends	c
.	c

What	c
I	c
liked	c
the	c
most	c
was	c
working	c
with	c
the	c
singers	c
,	c
teaching	c
them	c
how	c
to	c
dance	c
and	c
follow	c
some	c
footsteps	i
.	c

This	c
is	i
an	c
experience	c
,	i
I	c
'll	c
never	c
forget	c

and	c
especially	i
they	i
are	i
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
sightseeing	c
by	c
bus	c
and	c
visiting	c
National	i
Art	c
Gallery	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
suggest	c
a	c
special	c
activity	c
while	c
we	c
are	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

The	c
students	c
in	c
my	c
class	c
have	c
just	c
seen	c
the	c
advertisement	c
for	c
a	c
show	c
in	c
today	c
's	c
edition	c
of	c
The	c
Times	c
.	c

There	c
will	c
be	c
The	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
in	c
Central	c
Exhibition	c
Hall	c
on	c
the	c
14th	c
of	c
March	c
.	c

All	c
of	c
my	c
classmates	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
there	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
chance	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
latest	c
fashions	c
,	c
leisure	c
and	c
sports	c
wear	c
,	c
make	i
up	i
and	c
hairstyles	c
.	c

The	c
fashion	c
show	c
is	c
only	c
on	c
the	c
14th	c
of	c
March	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
would	c
be	c
grateful	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
allow	c
all	c
of	c
my	c
classmates	c
to	c
go	c
there	c
after	c
visiting	c
Science	i
Museum	c
instead	c
of	c
going	c
shopping	c
.	c

Many	c
people	c
think	c
that	c
it	c
is	c
natural	c
for	c
famous	c
people	c
to	c
be	c
followed	c
by	c
journalists	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
because	c
they	c
are	c
famous	c
and	c
everybody	c
is	c
curious	c
about	c
their	c
life	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
in	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
famous	c
people	c
,	c
such	c
as	c
politicians	c
and	c
film	c
actors	c
,	c
deserve	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
private	c
life	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
everybody	c
has	c
rights	c
to	c
keep	c
their	c
own	c
private	i
life	i
,	c
especially	c
when	c
they	c
are	c
in	c
serious	c
situations	c
such	c
as	c
divorce	c
and	i
a	c
family	c
member	c
's	c
or	c
the	i
closest	c
friend	c
's	c
death	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
too	c
cruel	c
for	c
them	c
to	c
be	i
monitored	i
their	i
feelings	i
at	c
that	c
time	c
.	c

Another	c
reason	c
that	c
I	c
agree	c
famous	i
people	c
deserve	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
private	c
life	c
is	c
that	c
if	c
journalists	c
followed	c
them	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
,	c
it	c
would	c
result	c
in	c
their	c
death	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
if	c
Diana	c
,	c
who	c
was	c
ex-wife	i
of	c
Prince	c
Charles	c
,	c
had	c
n't	c
been	c
followed	c
by	c
paparachi	i
when	c
she	c
was	c
dating	c
with	i
a	c
guy	i
,	c
there	c
would	c
n't	c
have	c
been	c
a	c
car	c
accident	c
which	c
caused	c
her	c
death	c
.	c

Therefore	c
,	c
even	c
famous	c
people	c
need	c
their	c
own	c
life	c
apart	c
from	c
the	c
media	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
asked	c
by	c
my	c
class	c
to	c
write	c
to	c
you	c
.	c

The	c
river	c
trip	c
to	c
Greenwich	c
is	c
also	c
a	c
marvellous	c
idea	c
!	c

However	c
,	c
could	c
we	c
make	c
a	c
suggestion	c
?	c

Having	c
seen	c
an	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
,	c
at	c
the	c
Central	c
Exhibition	c
Hall	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
14th	c
,	c
we	c
would	c
particularly	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
and	c
visit	c
it	c
.	c

Besides	c
,	c
as	c
there	c
are	c
more	c
girls	c
than	c
boys	c
in	c
the	c
class	c
,	c
they	c
would	c
certainly	c
enjoy	c
attending	c
on	i
live	i
make-up	i
and	i
hairstyles	i
.	c

Lastly	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
free	c
for	c
students	c
,	c
which	c
is	c
fantastic	c
!	c

So	c
,	c
instead	c
of	c
going	c
shopping	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
afternoon	c
,	c
we	c
might	i
go	c
to	c
the	c
Show	i
.	c

We	c
may	i
go	c
shopping	c
on	c
Wednesday	c
afternoon	c
,	c
as	c
we	c
should	c
have	i
had	i
freetime	i
.	c

For	c
famous	c
people	c
,	c
having	c
a	c
private	c
life	c
is	c
difficult	c
,	c
especially	c
because	c
we	c
are	c
all	c
interested	c
in	c
their	c
lives	c
.	c

Indeed	c
,	c
it	c
can	c
be	c
useful	c
for	c
their	c
career	c
.	c

The	c
more	c
they	c
are	c
in	c
the	c
media	c
,	c
the	c
more	c
they	i
will	i
be	i
famous	i
.	c

According	i
to	i
me	i
,	c
some	c
of	c
them	c
need	c
to	c
be	c
appreciated	c
by	c
fans	c
,	c
they	c
need	c
to	c
be	c
loved	c
and	c
see	c
themselves	c
on	c
television	c
.	c

They	c
need	c
to	c
be	c
famous	c
again	c
.	c

Besides	c
,	c
I	c
consider	i
that	c
some	c
stars	c
sometimes	c
call	c
journalist	i
to	c
tell	c
them	c
where	c
they	c
will	c
be	c
,	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
have	c
free	c
advertisement	i
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
according	i
to	i
me	i
,	c
it	c
is	c
also	c
a	c
good	c
way	c
for	c
them	c
to	c
earn	c
money	c
.	c

Famous	c
people	c
are	c
so	c
often	c
asked	c
to	c
give	c
interview	i
that	c
the	c
outcome	c
is	c
that	c
they	c
want	c
to	c
be	c
paid	c
for	c
it	c
,	c
either	c
in	c
the	c
newspapers	c
or	c
on	c
television	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
for	c
other	c
famous	c
people	c
,	c
being	c
followed	c
by	c
journalists	c
is	c
the	c
worst	c
element	c
of	c
the	c
fame	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
it	c
must	c
be	c
so	c
stressful	c
to	c
endure	c
the	c
pressure	c
they	c
have	i
to	c
be	c
perfect	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
because	c
they	c
could	c
be	c
followed	c
by	c
a	c
photograph	i
.	c

They	c
cannot	c
go	c
to	c
public	c
places	c
,	c
unless	c
they	c
make-up	i
themselves	c
and	c
they	c
are	c
ready	c
to	c
sign	c
autographs	c
.	c

They	c
would	c
really	c
like	c
a	c
normal	c
life	c
,	c
either	c
because	c
it	i
is	i
their	c
temper	c
,	i
a	i
regarding	i
to	i
their	c
children	c
.	c

Nevertheless	c
,	c
they	c
are	c
never	c
let	i
alone	c
,	c
which	c
is	c
a	c
shame	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	i
Jane	i
Clark	c

We	c
can	c
inaute	i
stars	c
and	c
artists	c
from	c
around	c
the	c
world	c
who	c
will	c
make	i
and	c
prisentspresent	i
all	c
kind	i
of	c
music	c
like	c
jazz	c
,	c
rock	c
,	c
classical	c
ect	i
.	c

It	c
should	c
be	c
done	c
show	i
so	c
people	c
can	c
see	c
how	c
people	c
in	c
every	c
corner	c
of	c
the	c
word	i
make	i
theyr	i
own	i
fun	c
.	c

Afterward	i
we	c
could	c
let	c
people	c
talk	c
with	c
artists	i
so	c
they	c
can	i
get	c
knoe	i
theyr	i
privacy	i

Your	i

Because	c
I	c

For	c
accommodation	c

it	i
's	i
more	c
comfortable	c

.	c

And	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c

about	c
the	c
weather	c

Because	c
I	c

I	c

a	c

Hi	c
,	c
Kim	c

Thanks	c
for	c
the	c
letter	c
asking	c
about	c
a	i
pop	c
concert	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
really	c
good	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
good	c
to	c
work	c
with	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
people	c
and	c
shared	i
experiences	c
.	c

I	c
met	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
famous	c
pop	c
bands	c
for	c
the	c
first	c
time	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
feel	c
sad	c
if	c
I	c
did	i
n't	i
go	i
there	c
.	c

They	c
gave	c
me	c
a	c
concert	c
printed	i
T-shirt	c
.	c

I	c
'll	c
show	c
you	c
by	i
photographs	c
.	c

So	c
we	c
are	i
still	c
keep	c
in	c
touch	c
.	c

And	c
next	i
concert	c
we	c
were	c
promised	c
we	c
'll	c
be	c
there	c
again	c
.	c

I	c
wish	c
you	c
were	i
there	c
with	c
us	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
to	c
hear	c
back	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Take	c
care	c
and	c
do	c
n't	c
work	c
too	c
hard	c
.	c

Dear	c
Manager	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
this	c
letter	c
to	c
remind	c
you	c
some	i
faults	c
of	c
your	c
theatre	c
.	c

Last	c
week	c
I	c
was	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

I	c
attended	c
to	i
your	c
activity	i
.	c

I	c
wanted	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
play	c
as	c
quickly	c
as	c
possible	c
.	c

Coming	i
an	i
hour	i
earlier	i
is	i
the	i
proof	i
of	i
my	i
feeling	i
.	c

I	c
waited	c
45	c
minutes	c
more	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
play	c
.	c

Anyway	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
important	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

Because	c
,	i
I	c
believe	c
that	c
if	c
you	c
want	c
to	c
get	c
a	i
satisfaction	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
sacrifice	c
a	c
little	c
bit	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
really	c
shocked	c
.	c

Because	c
from	c
my	c
point	c
of	c
view	c
the	c
buildings	i
of	c
a	c
play	c
are	c
the	c
actors	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

But	c
Beatrice	c
did	c
n't	c
think	c
so	c
.	c

That	c
's	c
why	c
she	c
came	i
across	i
with	i
so	c
many	c
problems	c
.	c

They	c
were	c
best	c
friends	c
.	c

Beatrice	c
was	i
thinking	i
so	c
.	c

When	c
she	c
came	c
to	c
school	c
,	c
first	i
,	c
we	c
wanted	c
to	c
warn	c
her	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
Beatrice	c
and	c
her	c
family	c
were	c
our	c
next	i
door	i
neighbours	c
.	c

Her	c
father	c
never	c
let	c
her	c
to	i
have	i
a	c
boyfriend	c
.	c

Yes	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
a	i
strange	c
behaviour	c
.	c

But	c
her	c
father	c
did	c
n't	c
have	c
the	c
same	c
opinion	c
.	c

That	c
's	c
all	c
I	c
knew	c
about	c
her	c
.	c

Days	c
passed	c
.	c

Beatrice	c
and	c
Pat	c
were	c
going	c
everywhere	c
together	c
.	c

Pat	c
had	c
a	c
boyfriend	c
.	c

That	c
's	c
why	c
Beatrice	c
's	c
father	c
never	c
liked	c
Pat	c
.	c

She	c
was	c
crying	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
n't	c
believe	c
.	i

Because	c
I	c
got	i
used	c
to	c
seeing	c
her	c
every	i
time	i
cheerful	c
and	c
laughing	c
.	c

But	c
this	c
time	c
the	c
situation	c
was	c
inversed	i
.	c

She	c
had	c
told	c
Pat	c
that	c
her	c
father	c
had	i
n't	i
let	c
them	c
to	i
be	i
friends	c
anymore	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
this	c
letter	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
express	c
my	c
disappointment	c
about	i
your	c
theatre	c
.	c

On	i
the	c
advertisement	c
,	i
that	c
I	c
have	i
received	i
,	c
it	c
was	c
written	c
that	c
the	c
show	c
would	c
start	c
at	c
19:30	c
but	c
I	c
kept	c
wainting	i
for	c
it	c
to	c
start	c
for	c
half	c
an	c
hour	c
.	c

And	c
there	c
were	c
no	c
discounts	c
available	c
either	c
,	c
unlike	c
it	i
was	c
written	c
in	c
the	c
same	c
advertisement	c
.	c

Another	c
disappointing	c
point	c
was	c
that	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
watch	i
Danny	c
Brook	c
so	c
much	c
and	c
it	c
was	c
written	c
that	c
he	c
was	c
acting	c
in	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
but	c
unfortunately	c
the	c
man	c
on	c
the	c
stage	c
was	c
not	c
him	c
.	c

And	c
finally	c
,	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
to	c
have	c
something	c
to	c
eat	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
of	c
restoration	c
.	c

There	c
was	c
no	c
notice	c
about	c
it	c
in	c
your	c
advertisement	c
.	c

Because	c
of	c
all	c
these	c
reasons	c
,	c
which	c
I	c
have	c
listed	c
above	c
,	c
my	c
evening	c
which	i
should	c
have	c
been	c
perfect	c
,	c
turned	c
into	c
a	c
disaster	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
have	c
at	c
least	c
some	c
of	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	i
,	c

She	c
did	c
not	c
trust	c
the	c
boy	c
,	c
and	c
it	c
was	c
very	c
hard	c
for	c
her	c
to	c
lie	c
to	c
people	c
,	i
that	c
she	c
liked	c
so	c
much	c
.	c

And	c
she	c
realized	c
that	c
if	c
something	c
happens	i
to	c
her	c
best	c
fried	i
,	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
her	c
fault	c
and	c
her	c
best	c
friend	c
's	c
parents	c
would	c
blame	c
her	c
for	c
it	c
.	c

So	c
she	c
decided	c
to	c
call	c
the	c
parents	c
of	c
her	c
best	c
friend	c
and	c
tell	c
them	c
what	c
was	c
going	c
on	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
about	c
my	c
complaints	c
of	i
mine	i
about	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
of	i
your	c
theater	i
,	i
that	c
I	c
have	i
watched	i
a	c
week	c
ago	c
,	c
during	c
my	c
stay	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

That	c
evening	c
,	c
the	c
problems	c
started	c
with	c
the	c
tickets	c
...	c

Secondly	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
has	i
started	i
with	i
a	c
delay	c
of	c
45	c
minutes	c
,	c
and	c
because	c
of	c
this	c
all	c
my	c
arrangements	c
for	c
that	c
night	c
were	c
delayed	c
.	c

Another	c
problem	c
was	c
the	c
starring	i
male	i
actor	i
:	c
the	c
well	i
known	i
and	c
talented	c
actor	c
,	i
mentioned	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
was	c
replaced	c
with	i
another	c
one	c
,	c
who	c
was	c
really	c
very	c
disappointing	c
and	c
after	c
the	c
performance	c
,	c
I	c
visited	c
the	c
theater	i
restaurant	c
,	c
which	c
was	c
said	i
to	c
be	c
open	c
and	c
available	c
for	c
meals	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
;	i
but	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
you	c
owe	c
me	c
an	c
excuse	i
and	c
a	c
full	c
refund	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hear	i
from	c
you	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

Clothes	c
of	c
the	c
Future	c

Except	c
some	i
very	c
extraordinary	c
cases	c
,	c
no.	c
Tell	c
me	c
,	c
why	c
people	i
care	c
so	c
much	c
about	c
what	c
they	c
wear	c
and	c
what	c
others	c
wear	c
?	c

Maybe	c
because	c
of	c
this	c
,	c
just	c
like	c
living	c
things	c
,	c
the	i
clothes	c
have	i
evolution	i
.	c

This	c
evolution	c
has	c
never	c
stopped	c
and	c
it	c
will	c
continue	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
the	c
clothes	c
of	c
the	c
world	c
,	c
after	i
a	c
century	i
,	i
will	c
be	c
styled	c
in	c
the	i
Japanese	c
way	c
:	c
minimalist	c
and	c
naturalist	c
.	c

Throughout	c
the	i
history	c
,	c
we	c
have	c
observed	c
that	c
people	c
get	c
rid	c
of	c
everything	c
that	c
is	c
not	c
natural	c
,	c
such	c
as	c
corsets	c
and	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
belts	c
and	c
ties	c
might	c
be	c
"	c
out	c
"	c
.	c

Of	c
course	c
,	c
the	i
technology	c
will	c
change	c
too	c
.	c

Maybe	c
,	i
new	c
kinds	c
of	c
fabrics	c
,	i
that	c
are	c
capable	c
of	c
insulating	c
light	c
,	i
or	c
heat	c
will	c
be	c
used	c
.	c

Actually	c
,	c
some	c
clothes	c
like	c
that	c
are	c
being	c
developed	c
today	c
;	i
but	c
only	c
as	c
prototypes	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
possible	c
to	c
see	c
that	c
they	c
will	c
be	c
widely	c
used	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
it	c
seems	c
to	c
me	c
that	c
,	i
the	c
clothes	c
of	c
tomorrow	c
will	c
be	c
quite	c
naturalist	i
and	c
minimalist	c
and	c
also	c
,	c
the	c
fabrics	c
that	c
are	c
used	c
will	c
change	c
too	c
.	c

In	c
fact	c
,	c
we	c
can	i
not	i
know	c
,	i
what	c
will	i
the	i
time	i
give	c
and	c
take	c
away	c
,	c
so	c
let	c
's	c
wait	c
and	c
see	c
:	i
the	c
clothes	c
of	c
the	c
future	c
.	c

Dear	c
Ms.	c
Ryan	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

Second	c
,	c
I	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
a	i
log	c
cabin	c
.	c

I	c
usually	c
stay	c
a	i
tent	c
during	c
camping	c
.	c

Actually	c
,	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
like	c
tent	i
so	c
much	c
.	c

Therefore	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
interested	c
in	c
staying	c
a	i
log	c
cabin	c
.	c

Third	c
,	c
I	c
chose	c
painting	c
and	c
golf	c
as	c
activities	c
.	c

Specially	i
,	c
I	c
like	c
water	c
painting	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

Shopping	c
is	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
love	c
shopping	c
.	c

I	c
never	c
feel	c
tired	c
during	c
shopping	c
.	c

Especially	i
,	c
I	c
prefer	c
to	c
go	c
department	i
stores	c
.	c

They	c
are	c
heaven	c
!	c

I	c
can	c
spend	c
in	i
there	i
all	i
day	i
.	c

By	c
the	c
way	c
,	c
shopping	c
is	c
a	c
sort	c
of	c
therapy	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
many	c
people	c
,	c
specially	i
women	c
,	c
had	i
same	i
experience	c
.	c

Dear	c
Miss	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
in	c
reply	c
to	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
absolutely	c
delighted	c
with	c
the	c
news	c
.	c

It	c
really	c
took	c
me	c
by	c
surprise	c
this	i
prize	c
,	i
I	c
did	c
n't	c
think	c
I	c
would	c
be	c
so	c
lucky	c
to	i
win	c
.	c

The	c
reason	c
is	c
that	c
my	c
academic	c
year	c
starts	c
in	c
August	c
therefor	i
I	c
need	c
to	c
be	c
here	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
not	c
sure	c
whether	c
I	c
will	c
need	c
some	c
special	c
clothes	c
,	i
if	i
not	c
what	c
sort	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	i
should	i
bring	c
,	c
and	c
also	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
roughly	c
I	i
will	i
need	c
for	c
my	c
daily	c
expenses	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
be	c
very	c
grateful	c
for	c
your	c
help	c
and	c
advice	c
in	c
this	i
matters	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
it	c
.	c

The	c
concert	c
was	c
a	c
huge	c
success	c
,	i
lots	i
of	c
people	c
came	c
and	c
enjoyed	c
the	c
music	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
proud	c
of	c
myself	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
way	c
I	c
managed	c
the	c
whole	c
experience	c
,	c
although	c
there	c
were	c
moments	c
when	c
I	c
thought	c
I	c
was	c
n't	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
cope	c
with	c
all	c
the	c
pressure	c
.	c

Especially	c
when	c
the	c
musicians	c
arrived	c
,	i
they	i
can	c
be	c
very	c
demanding	c
people	c
and	c
sometimes	c
they	c
came	i
up	c
with	c
very	c
odd	c
requests	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
once	c
they	c
wanted	c
mineral	c
water	c
of	c
a	c
certain	c
French	c
label	c
,	i
which	c
was	c
impossible	c
to	c
get	c
.	c

My	c
tasks	c
were	c
very	c
especifics	i
.	c

After	c
that	c
part	c
was	c
fully-functioning	i
I	c
moved	c
on	c
to	c
work	c
in	i
the	i
back	i
stage	i
.	c

I	c
really	c
enjoyed	c
working	c
with	c
those	c
people	c
,	i
they	i
are	c
all	c
very	c
professional	c
although	c
they	c
may	c
look	c
a	c
bit	c
eccentric	c
sometimes	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
what	c
I	c
liked	c
the	c
most	c
about	c
it	c
was	c
seeing	c
so	c
many	c
people	c
dancing	c
,	c
jumping	c
and	c
enjoying	c
frenetically	c
of	i
something	c
that	c
I	c
had	c
been	c
part	c
of	c
and	c
helped	c
to	c
make	c
it	i
happened	i
.	c

Looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

Best	c
Wishes	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
the	c
letter	c
you	c
have	c
sent	c
recently	c
.	c

I	c
'll	c
be	c
taking	c
an	c
English	c
Examination	c
at	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
June	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
good	c
idea	c
if	c
I	c
can	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
it	c
's	c
the	c
only	c
month	c
I	c
can	c
spend	c
abroad	c
this	c
year	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
letter	c
you	c
said	c
that	c
accommodation	i
provided	c
can	c
be	c
either	c
tents	i
or	c
log	i
cabins	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
tents	i
so	c
that	c
I	c
will	c
have	c
the	c
chance	c
to	c
be	c
in	c
contact	c
with	c
the	i
nature	c
as	c
well	c
as	c
the	c
scenery	c
around	c
.	i

Another	i
thing	i
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
choose	c
from	c
the	c
activity	c
list	c
is	i
singing	c
(	c
because	c
I	c
take	i
part	i
in	i
a	c
chorus	i
at	c
school	c
)	c
and	c
photography	c
.	c

Do	c
you	c
think	c
you	c
could	c
also	c
let	c
me	c
know	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
we	c
will	c
need	c
during	c
our	c
stay	c
at	c
the	c
Camp	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
be	c
grateful	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
send	c
me	c
a	c
brochure	c
and	c
a	c
map	c
showing	c
where	c
the	c
camp	c
is	c
.	c

thanking	c
you	c
in	c
anticipation	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

Sorry	c
I	c
have	c
n't	c
written	c
for	c
so	c
long	c
but	c
I	c
was	c
really	c
busy	c
trying	c
to	c
apply	c
for	c
a	c
job	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
summer	c
night	c
and	c
all	c
the	c
citizens	c
,	c
as	c
well	c
as	c
tourists	c
,	c
had	c
the	c
opportunity	c
to	c
attend	c
.	c

I	c
knew	c
some	c
help	c
was	c
needed	c
so	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
speak	c
to	c
the	c
manager	c
.	c

K.	c
if	i
you	c
want	c
to	c
help	c
,	c
here	c
is	c
a	c
list	c
of	c
what	c
you	c
can	c
do.	c
"	c

Working	c
with	c
this	c
band	c
was	c
an	c
experience	c
I	c
will	c
never	c
forget	c
.	c

What	c
I	c
really	c
enjoyed	c
was	c
been	i
part	c
of	c
the	c
staff	c
.	c

I	c
'd	c
love	c
to	c
hear	c
all	c
your	c
news	c
,	i
why	i
do	c
n't	c
you	c
come	c
and	c
visit	c
me	c
?	c

Perhaps	c
I	c
could	c
show	c
you	c
the	c
pictures	c
I	c
took	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
arrangements	c
for	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
spending	c
some	c
days	c
in	c
London	c
and	c
enjoyed	i
a	i
lot	i
the	i
idea	i
of	i
seeing	i
this	i
show	i
.	c

All	i
my	i
disappointment	c
started	c
when	c
we	c
noticed	c
that	c
there	c
were	c
no	c
discounts	c
available	c
for	c
the	c
tickets	c
,	c
but	c
as	c
we	c
wanted	c
to	c
see	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
's	c
performance	c
,	c
we	c
decided	c
to	c
buy	c
them	c
anyway	c
.	c

We	c
got	c
really	c
upset	c
when	c
we	c
realized	c
he	c
was	i
being	i
substituted	c
.	c

Besides	c
the	c
boredom	c
of	c
having	c
waited	i
for	c
forty-five	c
minutes	c
,	c
we	c
were	c
not	c
allowed	c
to	c
visit	c
the	c
restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
since	c
it	c
was	c
already	c
closed	c
by	c
the	c
time	c
the	c
show	c
finished	c
.	c

As	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
our	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
,	c
as	c
you	c
suggested	i
in	c
your	c
advertisement	c
,	c
we	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
if	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
possible	c
for	c
us	c
to	c
get	c
a	c
refund	c

Its	c
name	c
is	c
"	c
Best	c
Detective	c
Stories	c
of	c
Agatha	c
Christie	c
"	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
really	c
got	i
impressioned	i
with	c
the	c
coherence	c
of	c
the	c
stories	c
.	c

Agatha	c
Christie	c
presents	c
situations	c
that	c
make	i
us	i
break	i
up	i
our	i
minds	i

I	c
'm	c
sure	c
you	c
'll	c
find	c
this	c
book	c
an	c
interesting	c
object	c
of	c
study	c

Agatha	c

are	c
simple	c

but	c
very	c
well	c
written	c

and	c
,	c
as	c
I	c
told	c
you	c

very	c
coherent	c

I	c
'm	c
sure	c
that	c
if	c
you	c
listen	c
to	c
it	c
you	c
will	c
start	c
reading	c
the	c

Best	c
wishes	c
,	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
is	i
such	c
a	c
good	c
programme	c
especially	i
because	c
the	c
places	c
that	c
we	c
visit	c
,	c
like	c
the	c
Science	c
Museum	c
,	c
are	c
very	c
interesting	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
the	c
rest	c
of	c
the	c
students	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
heard	c
about	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
show	c
that	c
will	c
be	c
celebrated	c
at	c
the	c
Central	c
Exhibition	c
Hall	c
in	c
London	c
where	i
the	c
latest	c
fashions	c
will	c
be	c
shown	c
.	c

And	c
it	c
has	c
free-entrance	i
for	c
the	i
students	c
.	c

We	c
think	c
that	c
,	c
if	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
any	c
problem	c
,	c
we	c
could	c
visit	c
the	c
Science	c
Museum	c
on	c
Wednesday	c
after	c
visiting	c
the	c
National	c
Art	c
Gallery	c
so	c
that	c
we	c
can	i
go	c
to	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
show	c
.	c

From	i
any	i
point	i
of	i
view	i
,	c
the	c
home	c
of	c
the	c
future	c
will	c
be	c
very	c
similar	c
to	c
the	c
homes	c
that	c
we	c
have	c
today	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
it	c
will	c
has	i
a	c
similar	c
structure	c
but	c
it	c
will	c
include	c
some	c
new	c
technological	c
advantages	c
like	c
having	c
all	c
the	c
house	c
controlled	c
by	c
a	c
computer	c
so	c
that	c
,	c
for	c
example	c
,	c
we	c
can	c
turn	c
on	c
the	c
lights	c
of	i
the	c
bedroom	c
just	c
pressing	i
a	c
button	c
while	c
we	c
are	c
watching	c
the	c
TV	c
sitting	c
on	c
the	c
sofa	c
.	c

Although	c
many	c
people	c
think	c
that	c
the	c
home	c
of	c
the	c
future	c
will	c
be	c
something	c
like	c
an	i
UFO	c
,	c
in	c
my	c
opinion	c
the	c
changes	c
wo	c
n't	c
be	c
very	c
important	i
,	c
they	c
will	c
probably	c
consist	c
on	i
making	c
the	c
houseworks	i
easier	c
.	c

The	c
cleanest	i
example	c
is	c
to	c
compare	c
a	c
house	c
from	c
the	c
beginings	i
of	c
the	c
20th	c
century	c
with	c
our	c
house	i
Both	i
are	c
very	c
similar	c
but	c
now	c
we	c
have	c
new	c
technologies	c
.	c

In	i
balance	c
then	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
the	c
houses	c
that	c
we	c
can	i
see	c
on	i
films	c
wo	c
n't	c
really	c
exist	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
the	c
prize	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
this	c
letter	c
to	c
inform	c
you	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
recieved	i
your	c
letters	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
going	c
to	i
the	c
trip	c
.	c

Other	i
reason	c
is	c
I	i
think	c
in	c
July	c
the	c
weather	c
is	c
not	c
so	c
cold	c
.	c

Every	c
night	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
come	i
out	c
of	c
the	c
small	c
tent	c
to	i
the	c
nice	c
enviroment	i
outside	c
the	c
tent	c
.	c

I	c
'll	c
have	c
to	c
be	c
aware	i
about	c
insects	c
so	c
I	c
've	c
bought	c
so	c
many	c
insects	i
repellant	i
.	c

I	c
can	c
choose	c
to	c
do	c
2	c
activities	c
so	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
play	c
tennis	c
and	c
swimming	i
.	c

I	c
was	c
a	c
bit	c
disapotted	i
with	c
the	c
result	c
because	c
I	c
was	c
expected	c
to	c
win	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
or	c
secound	i
price	i
.	c

Lastly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
questions	i
.	c

First	c
,	c
how	c
many	c
clothes	c
do	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
bring	c
?	c

Your	i
sincerely	c
,	c

Hi	c
!	c

How	c
are	c
you	c
.	i

I	c
've	c
been	c
asked	c
to	c
help	i
by	i
the	c
well	i
known	i
band	c
called	i
Westlife	c
.	c

At	i
last	i
,	c
she	c
allowed	c
me	c
.	i

I	c
had	c
to	c
keep	c
things	c
in	c
place	c
and	c
cheakd	i
that	c
the	c
microphones	c
was	i
working	c
properly	c
.	c

Although	c
the	c
work	c
was	c
not	c
heavey	i
,	c
I	c
gained	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
experience	c
.	c

I	c
was	i
really	c
enjoy	i
at	i
the	c
concert	c
.	c

That	c
is	c
my	c
story	c

Tell	c
me	c

Best	c
wishes	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
,	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
inform	c
you	c
about	c
The	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
show	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
14th	c
March	c
at	i
10.00	c
-	c
19.00	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
be	c
greatful	i
if	c
you	c
could	c
arrange	i
these	i
shows	i
in	c
your	c
programme	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
very	c
thoughtful	c
of	c
you	c
that	i
you	i
are	i
taking	i
all	c
of	c
us	c
to	c
London	c
.	c

This	c
is	c
great	i
oppotunity	i
for	c
me	c
to	c
explore	c
and	c
experience	c
London	c
myself	c
especially	i
,	i
The	c
London	c
fashion	c
and	c
leisure	c
shows	c
.	c

Most	c
of	c
the	c
shows	c
are	c
about	c
fashinable	i
things	c
for	c
the	i
students	c
in	i
my	c
age	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
good	c
programme	i
and	c
suitable	c
for	c
all	c
of	c
us	c
because	c
there	c
are	c
many	c
different	c
kinds	c
of	c
the	i
shows	i
for	i
instance	c
latest	i
fashions	c
,	c
leisure	c
and	c
sports	c
wear	c
,	c
how	c
to	c
make	i
up	i
and	c
how	c
to	c
have	i
propiate	i
hairstyles	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
this	c
information	c
will	c
help	c
you	i
to	i
understand	i
and	c
put	i
it	c
in	c
your	c
programme	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
dangerous	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
knew	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
afraid	c
of	c
the	c
hieght	i
and	c
was	c
very	c
nervous	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
given	c
the	c
lists	i
for	i
doing	i
the	i
activities	c
while	c
I	c
was	c
going	i
to	i
the	c
adventurous	i
school	c
schems	i
at	c
the	c
solder	i
camps	c
in	c
the	c
north	c
of	c
Thailand	c
.	c

There	c
were	c
many	c
tasks	c
that	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
complete	c
for	i
instance	c
,	c
clime	i
up	i
to	i
the	c
mountain	c
,	c
how	i
to	c
used	i
some	i
kind	i
of	c
guns	i
,	c
and	c
how	c
to	c
survive	c
when	i
I	c
got	c
lost	c
in	c
the	i
forest	c
.	c

The	c
last	c
task	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
was	c
jume	i
out	c
of	c
the	c
hight	i
tower	c
.	c

The	c
assistants	c
were	c
the	c
real	c
solder	i
and	c
they	c
were	c
very	c
kind	c
and	c
helpful	c
eventhough	i
,	i
they	c
looked	c
very	c
strick	i
and	c
unkind	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
the	c
hardest	c
time	c
for	c
me	c
to	i
do	i
thing	i
like	i
this	i
because	c
I	c
lived	c
in	c
the	c
city	c
most	c
of	c
my	c
life	c
I	i
had	c
never	c
known	c
about	i
how	c
to	c
survive	c
in	c
the	i
forest	c
and	c
how	c
difficult	c
to	i
work	i
as	i
solders	i
.	c

I	c
eventaully	i
managed	c
to	c
complete	c
all	c
tasks	i
that	c
I	c
had	i
given	i
I	i
was	c
very	c
proud	c
of	c
this	c
.	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
:	c

I	c
have	c
just	c
received	c
your	c
letter	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
happy	c
about	c
this	c
.	c

Thanks	c
very	c
much	c
!	c

It	c
will	c
be	c
very	c
nice	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
interested	c
in	c
both	c
places	i
but	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
just	c
choose	c
one	c
place	i
,	i
I	c
think	c
I	c
will	c
choose	c
log	c
cabins	c
,	i
it	i
's	i
sounds	i
good	c
and	c
if	c
I	c
have	c
time	c
,	c
maybe	c
I	c
can	c
go	i
to	i
tents	c
next	c
time	c
(	c
maybe	c
next	c
year	c
.	i
)	i

When	c
I	c
am	c
at	c
Camp	c
,	c
I	c
will	c
choose	c
singing	c
and	c
photography	c
I	i
can	c
sing	c
classic	i
music	c
and	c
pop	c
music	c
,	c
seem	i
like	c
rock	c
&	c
roll	c
.	c

Maybe	c
TITANIC	c
.	c

And	c
I	c
can	c
also	i
make	i
very	c
good	i
photography	i
,	c
because	c
I	c
learned	i
this	c
in	c
China	c
two	c
years	c
ago	c
.	c

Another	c
thing	c
is	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
some	c
questions	c
about	c
journey	i
,	i
What	c
's	c
the	c
weather	c
like	c
?	c

What	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
shall	c
I	c
take	c
?	c
and	i
how	c
much	c
does	c
it	c
cost	c
per	c
night	c
live	i
in	c
a	c
Hotel	c
?	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c

A	c
lot	c
of	c
people	c
enjoy	c
shopping	c
very	c
much	c
,	i
me	i
too	c
.	c

But	c
sometimes	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
very	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
student	c
,	i
I	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
job	i
,	c
so	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
asked	i
money	i
from	c
my	c
parents	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
go	c
shopping	c
.	i

Secondly	c
,	c
if	c
you	c
live	c
in	c
a	c
big	c
city	c
,	c
the	i
things	c
always	i
expensive	c
.	c

You	c
should	i
spend	c
more	c
money	c
on	c
buying	c
clothes	c
and	c
food	c
,	c
you	i
will	c
very	i
happy	c
when	c
you	c
buy	i
it	i
,	c
but	c
,	i
when	c
you	c
come	c
back	c
home	c
take	i
out	c
you	i
purse	c
,	c
you	c
must	i
be	c
feel	i
sad	c
,	i
you	i
purse	c
nearly	i
empty	c
,	i
(	c
when	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
enough	c
money	c
.	i
)	i

And	i
then	i
,	i
you	i
may	i
save	i
money	i
for	i
the	i
things	i
you	i
like	i
,	i
nothing	i
to	i
do	i
,	i
just	i
for	i
the	i
poor	i
things	i
what	i
you	i
like	i
so	i
funny	c
is	i
n't	c
it	c
?	c

Another	c
thing	c
is	c
when	c
you	c
shopping	i
in	i
a	c
busy	c
street	c
,	c
seem	i
like	c
oxford	i
st	i
in	c
London	c
.	i

a	c
lot	c
of	c
thief	i
there	i
,	i
they	i
will	c
steal	c
you	i
money	c
,	i
that	i
's	i
so	c
dangerous	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
in	c
my	c
opinion	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
really	c
enjoyable	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

It	i
will	c
stop	c
when	c
I	c
get	c
a	c
good	c
job	c
.	c

Maybe	c
I	c
will	c
feel	c
better	c
and	c
enjoy	c
it	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
this	c
letter	c
to	c
you	c
to	c
show	i
the	c
difference	c
between	c
your	c
advertisement	c
for	c
Over	c
The	c
Rainbow	c
and	c
the	i
real	c
life	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
a	c
fan	c
of	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
he	c
was	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
reasons	c
why	c
I	c
chose	c
seeing	i
Over	c
The	c
Rainbow	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
even	c
see	c
him	c
on	c
the	c
stage	c
.	c

Moreover	c
it	c
was	c
written	c
that	i
the	c
musical	c
was	c
between	c
14:30-19:30	i
.	c

Suprisingly	i
the	c
show	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
.	c

That	c
destroyed	c
all	c
my	c
plans	c
.	c

After	i
all	i
I	c
am	c
sure	c
that	c
you	c
understood	i
it	c
was	c
n't	c
my	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
and	c
you	c
will	c
give	c
my	i
money	c
back	c
.	c

That	c
was	c
also	c
my	c
fault	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
thought	c
Pat	c
and	c
I	c
were	c
best	c
friends	c
.	c

Yesterday	c
Larry	c
suggested	c
going	c
to	c
cinema	i
after	c
school	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
like	i
walking	c
on	i
the	c
clouds	c
the	i
whole	c
day	c
until	c
I	c
saw	c
Pat	c
running	c
towards	c
me	c
.	c

Do	c
n't	c
forget	c
bringing	i
your	c
history	c
books.	c
"	c

She	c
was	c
very	c
nervous	c
because	c
she	c
was	c
about	c
to	c
fail	c
.	c

I	c
told	c
her	c
that	c
I	c
want	i
to	c
tell	c
her	c
something	c
.	c

"	c
I	c
see	c
.	c

I	c
told	c
her	c
not	c
to	c
tell	c
this	i
anyone	i
.	c

She	c
said	c
OK	c
angrily	c
.	c

When	c
they	c
asked	c
me	c
the	c
reason	c
I	c
told	c
that	i
I	c
promised	c
my	c
Mom	c
to	c
be	i
with	c
her	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
closed	c
my	c
bedroom	i
's	i
door	c
I	c
burst	c
into	c
tears	c
.	c

Everyone	c
at	c
the	c
school	c
was	i
knowing	i
about	c
my	c
love	c
to	i
Larry	c
including	c
him	c
.	c

Pat	c
was	c
the	c
only	c
person	c
who	c
knew	i
it	i
.	c

It	c
's	c
very	c
difficult	c
to	c
change	c
it	c
.	c

About	c
the	c
accommodation	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
I	i
will	i
prefer	c
tents	c
because	c
I	c
like	c
the	c
nature	i
and	c
I	c
like	c
to	c
listen	c
the	i
birds	c
.	c

At	c
the	c
camp	c
I	c
will	i
like	c
to	c
practise	i
tennis	c
and	c
golf	c
.	c

My	c
level	c
in	c
this	i
two	c
activities	c
is	c
medium	c
,	i
I	c
never	c
practise	i
them	c
all	i
.	c

What	c
can	i
of	c
clothes	c
met	i
it	i
?	c

It	i
's	i
necessary	c
for	i
the	i
activities	i
to	i
wear	i
special	i
clothes	i
?	c

Thank	c
you	c
another	i
time	i
for	c
this	c
first	c
prize	c
two	i
weeks	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
in	c
the	c
U.S.A.	c
I	c
'm	c
very	c
happy	c
.	c

Last	c
weekend	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
Barcelona	c
with	c
some	c
friends	c
to	c
shop	c
.	c

When	c
we	c
arrived	c
to	i
the	c
shopping	c
center	i
,	c
I	c
saw	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
people	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
understand	c
why	c
they	i
was	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
people	c
.	c

My	c
friends	c
and	c
I	c
,	i
I	i
went	c
to	c
a	c
fashion	i
shop	c
"	i
Mango	c
"	c
to	i
buy	c
some	c
clothes	c
.	c

Nobody	c
at	i
the	c
shop	c
came	c
with	c
us	c
to	c
help	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
a	c
girl	i
very	i
friendly	i
came	c
with	c
us	c
.	c

We	c
bought	c
some	c
trousers	c
,	c
tee-shirts	c
,	c
and	c
one	c
pair	c
of	c
shoes	c
.	c

My	c
friends	c
bought	c
some	c
things	c
like	c
a	i
red	c
trousers	c
and	c
white	c
tee-shirts	c
.	c

After	c
this	c
,	c
we	c
returned	c
to	c
Andorra	c
.	c

Not	i
all	i
the	i
time	i
the	i
people	i
are	i
not	i
friendly	i
in	i
the	i
shops	i
.	c

Dear	c

Robertson	c
,	c

Specially	i
,	c
I	c

is	c
one	c

most	c
important	c

Being	i
London	i
one	c
of	c
the	c
most	c
multicultural	c
,	c
multiracial	c
cities	c
,	c
we	c
cannot	c
avoid	c
the	c
fact	c
that	c
is	i
these	c
days	c
The	c
London	c
Fashion	c
And	c

Based	c
on	c
this	c
I	c
would	c

In	c
those	c
days	c
we	c
decide	i
to	c
be	c
friends	c
forever	c
and	c
work	c
for	c
the	i
NASA	c
.	c

I	c
remember	c
it	c
as	c
if	c
it	c
were	c
yesterday	c
.	c

We	c
were	c
both	c
18	c
,	c
and	c
we	c
had	c
the	c
university	c
access	c
test	c
already	c
done	c
.	c

The	c
problem	c
was	c
that	c
both	c
of	c
us	c
wanted	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
same	c
university	c
,	c
the	c
NASA	c
university	c
in	c
Houston	c
(	c
Texas	c
)	c
.	c

Of	c
course	c
we	c
had	c
n't	c
got	c
enough	c
points	c
in	c
the	c
test	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
so	i
.	c

It	c
took	c
us	c
two	c
weeks	c
to	c
modify	c
the	c
results	c
in	c
a	c
very	c
complex	c
operation	c
in	c
which	c
we	c
should	c
take	c
care	c
of	c
hiding	i
all	c
our	c
fingerprints	c
.	c

The	c
operation	i
was	c
successful	c
.	c

Both	c
of	c
us	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
NASA	c
university	c
and	c
nowadays	c
we	c
work	c
for	c
the	c
CIA	c
developing	c
secure	c
system	i
and	c
new	c
encryptation	i
algorithms	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
,	c

Firstly	c
,	c
the	c
whole	c
class	c
is	c
very	c
pleased	c
with	c
the	c
programme	c
,	c
especially	c
with	c
the	c
visit	c
to	c
the	c
National	c
Art	c
Gallery	c
.	c

As	i
we	i
have	c
been	c
told	c
,	i
there	c
are	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
interesting	c
paintings	c
and	c
ancient	c
sculptures	c
in	i
which	c
we	c
all	i
are	i
keen	c
to	c
see	c
it	i
.	c

The	c
show	c
includes	c
the	c
latest	c
fashion	i
wear	i
,	c
sports	i
wear	i
for	i
spare	i
time	i
,	c
make	i
up	i
and	c
hairstyles	c
.	c

At	c
the	c
same	c
time	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
for	c
most	c
of	c
us	c
because	c
we	c
are	c
going	c
to	c
study	c
"	c
Art	c
and	c
Design	c
"	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

To	c
be	c
famous	c
or	c
not	c
to	c
be	c
famous	c
?	c

Well	c
,	c
first	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
's	c
quite	c
difficult	c
to	c
be	c
a	c
musician	c
,	c
film	c
star	c
or	c
a	c
politician	c
without	c
being	c
followed	c
by	c
journalists	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
most	c
of	c
these	c
people	c
are	c
aware	c
of	c
the	c
consequences	c
like	i
not	c
to	i
have	i
a	c
"	c
private	c
life	c
"	c
anymore	c
.	c

As	c
soon	c
as	c
they	c
are	c
famous	c
,	c
they	c
are	c
surrounded	c
by	c
their	c
fans	c
and	c
reporters	c
in	i
every	i
place	i
.	c

I	c
can	c
imagine	c
,	i
how	c
annoying	c
it	c
can	c
be	c
sometimes	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
the	c
way	c
how	i
they	c
earn	c
money	c
,	c
of	c
course	c
.	c

But	c
on	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
mention	c
that	c
they	c
are	i
going	i
too	c
far	c
sometimes	c
to	c
take	i
a	c
picture	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
go	i
to	c
Camp	c
California	c
in	c
the	c
USA	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
further	c
information	c
.	c

About	c
accommodation	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
tents	i
because	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
a	c
new	c
experience	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
pleasant	i
to	c
have	c
the	c
opportunity	c
to	c
practice	i
sports	c
as	c
well	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
good	c
at	c
swimming	c
and	c
playing	c
tennis	c
.	c

Will	c
the	i
Camp	c
California	c
provide	c
the	c
clothes	c
for	c
swimming	c
and	c
play	i
tennis	c
?	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
understand	c
why	c
men	c
do	c
n't	c
like	c
shopping	c
at	i
least	c
they	c
say	c
that	c
.	i

Despite	c
the	c
fact	c
that	c
it	i
love	c
shopping	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
agree	c
that	c
it	c
is	c
not	c
"	c
always	c
"	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

Sometimes	c
you	c
go	c
out	c
and	c
you	c
ca	c
n't	c
find	c
something	c
special	c
or	c
there	c
are	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
people	c
there	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
boring	i
.	c

Another	c
point	c
is	c
now	i
you	c
do	c
n't	c
need	c
to	c
go	c
out	c
just	i
for	i
shopping	c
.	c

I	c
believe	c
if	c
you	c
choose	c
the	c
best	c
way	c
or	c
the	c
best	c
day	c
to	c
go	c
shopping	c
you	c
will	c
love	c
it	c
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
I	c
think	c
there	c
is	i
boring	c
time	i
and	c
enjoyable	c
time	i
when	c
you	c
are	c
shopping	c
but	c
for	c
me	c
there	c
are	c
more	c
enjoyable	c
than	c
boring	c
time	i
.	c

As	c
this	c
evening	c
was	c
for	c
my	c
family	c
and	c
I	i
a	c
wasted	c
one	c
,	c
I	c
permit	c
myself	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
for	c
refund	i
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

There	i
is	i
no	i
need	i
to	i
be	i
a	i
genious	i
to	c
notice	c
that	c
technology	c
has	c
evoluated	i
so	c
considerably	c
during	c
the	c
last	c
decades	i
that	c
our	c
everyday	c
life	c
has	c
changed	c
.	c

In	c
this	c
domain	c
,	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
afford	i
everyday	i
the	i
development	c
of	c
new	c
technology	c
.	c

And	c
as	c
new	c
discoveries	c
bring	c
new	c
discoveries	c
,	c
progress	c
is	c
going	c
faster	c
and	c
faster	c
.	c

The	c
advantage	c
of	c
this	c
is	c
that	c
you	c
need	c
to	c
interest	i
yourself	i
in	c
all	i
if	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
want	c
to	c
be	c
put	i
on	i
the	i
side	i
.	c

And	c
so	c
,	c
your	c
life	c
is	c
not	c
boring	c
at	c
all	c
as	c
you	c
learn	c
new	c
things	c
everyday	i
.	c

But	c
,	c
who	c
knows	c
,	c
may	c
be	c
one	c
day	c
I	c
will	c
develop	c
technology	i
that	c
will	c
send	c
me	c
right	i
to	c
the	c
unemployment	c
office	c

Dear	c
Mrs.	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
with	c
reference	c
to	c
your	c
letter	c
about	c
the	c
competition	c
I	c
won	c
,	c
in	c
which	c
you	c
required	i
some	c
additional	c
information	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
happy	c
to	c
have	c
won	c
a	c
two-week	c
trip	c
at	i
Camp	c
California	c
,	c
but	c
for	c
me	c
it	c
is	c
only	c
possible	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
the	c
only	c
time	c
when	c
I	c
can	c
get	c
holidays	c
from	c
work	c
.	c

Therefore	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
essential	c
that	c
you	c
take	c
account	c
of	c
my	c
availability	c
when	c
booking	c
the	c
trip	c
.	c

As	c
I	c
am	c
an	c
expert	c
camper	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
be	c
accommodated	i
in	c
tents	i
than	i
in	c
log	i
cabins	i
.	c

What	i
concerns	i
activities	c
at	c
the	c
camp	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
be	c
highly	c
delighted	c
if	c
I	c
could	c
play	c
basketball	c
and	c
tennis	c
.	c

The	c
former	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
an	c
excellent	c
basketball-player	i
and	c
the	c
latter	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
interested	c
in	c
taking	c
up	c
a	c
new	c
sport	c
as	i
I	c
am	c
a	c
complete	c
beginner	c
at	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
a	c
little	c
unsure	c
about	c
some	c
things	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
be	c
very	c
grateful	c
to	c
you	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
answer	c
my	c
questions	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
if	c
I	c
will	c
need	c
to	c
take	c
some	c
special	c
clothes	c

how	c

REPORT	c
ON	c
DAILY	c
LIFE	c
AT	c
MY	c
SCHOOL	c
,	c
FOR	c
MY	c
ENGLISH	c
TEACHER	c

Introduction	c

After	c
our	c
English	c
class	i
'	i
decision	c
to	c
make	c
a	c
short	c
film	c
about	c
daily	c
life	c
in	c
my	c
school	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
asked	c
to	c
write	c
a	c
report	c
about	c
interesting	c
lessons	c
and	c
activities	c
that	c
should	c
be	c
filmed	c
.	c

Here	c
are	c
my	c
findings	c
.	c

Best	c
lessons	c
to	c
film	c

Therefore	c
,	c
to	c
show	c
the	c
good	c
aspects	c
,	c
I	c
suggest	c
to	i
film	i
Mr.	c
Clark	c
's	c
English	c
classes	c
,	c
because	c
they	c
are	c
highly	c
educative	i
and	c
because	c
the	c
students	c
participate	c
a	c
lot	c
.	c

Interesting	c
activities	c

One	c
event	c
that	c
should	c
not	c
be	c
missed	c
to	i
film	i
,	i
is	c
the	c
weekly	c
football	c
game	c
between	c
teachers	c
and	c
students	c
,	c
which	c
shows	c
how	c
well	c
they	c
get	c
along	c
with	c
each	c
other	c
.	c

Another	c
event	c
that	c
should	c
absolutely	i
be	c
captured	c
on	c
film	c
is	c
the	c
preparation	c
of	c
the	c
meals	c
in	c
the	c
canteen	c
.	c

The	c
cooks	c
are	c
very	c
friendly	c
and	c
excellent	c
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
I	c
suggest	c
that	c
our	c
English	c
class	c
seriously	c
takes	c
into	c
consideration	c
my	c
suggestions	c
when	c
making	c
the	c
video	c
.	c

INDIAN	c
DEMURO	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
because	i
I	c
have	c
not	c
finished	c
school	c
.	c

Althoug	i
I	i
wich	i
that	i
my	i
accommodation	i
at	i
Camp	i
California	i
it	i
must	i
be	i
in	c
tents	i
.	c

I	c
get	i
experience	c
in	i
the	i
last	c
summer	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
keen	c
at	i
sports	c
.	c

Specially	c
at	i
sailing	c
and	c
swimming	c
.	c

Anyway	c
I	c
am	c
hard	i
working	i
for	i
the	i
word	i
cup	i
at	i
sailing	i
.	c

Because	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
prepare	c
all	c
my	c
staf	i
and	c
I	c
am	c
sure	c
it	c
would	i
be	c
a	c
great	c
experience	c
despite	c
the	i
cost	i
of	i
living	i

Anyway	c
I	c
enjoed	i
so	i
much	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
n't	c
been	c
to	c
a	c

so	c
the	c
atmosphier	i

good	c
.	c

I	c
should	i
n't	i
forgot	i
my	c
experience	c
in	c
my	c
life	i
.	c

Dear	c
Ms	c
Jane	c
Clark	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
that	c
I	c
enjoyed	c
the	c
International	c
Arts	c
Festival	c
held	c
on	c
21-22	c
November	c
this	c
year	c
.	c

I	c
liked	c
the	c
plays	c
and	c
the	c
films	c
most	c
.	c

Some	c
films	c
were	c
really	c
wonderful	c
.	c

Especially	i
,	c
I	c
enjoyed	c
the	c
jazz	c
concerts	c
and	c
could	c
see	c
some	c
famous	c
jazz	c
musicians	c
I	c
adore	c
.	c

Some	c
concert	c
halls	c
were	c
not	c
big	c
enough	c
to	c
have	i
the	c
audience	c
.	c

For	c
next	c
year	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
you	c
should	c
take	c
this	c
matter	c
into	c
consideration	c
,	i
And	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
much	c
better	c
if	c
you	c
had	c
more	c
plays	c
and	c
films	c

I	c
will	c
definitely	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
festival	c
next	c
year	c

too	c

A	c
Japanese	c
folk	c
story	c
"	i
a	i
bamboo	i
princess	i
"	c

One	c
day	c
,	c
the	c
lady	c
went	c
to	c
a	c
river	c
to	c
wash	c
clothes	i
and	c
the	c
man	c
went	c
to	c
a	c
mountain	c
to	c
cut	c
trees	c
.	c

In	c
a	c
bamboo	c
forest	c
,	c
he	c
found	c
a	c
shining	c
bamboo	i
.	c

When	c
he	c
cut	c
it	c
,	c
he	c
found	c
a	c
beautiful	c
baby	c
girl	c
in	c
it	c
.	c

The	c
princess	c
grew	c
up	c
beautifully	i
.	c

Some	c
princes	c
proposed	c
her	i
.	c

and	c
asked	c
them	c
to	c
do	c
impossible	c
things	c
because	c
she	c
did	c
n't	c
want	c
to	c
get	c
married	c
.	c

One	c
day	c
,	c
the	c
old	c
couple	c
saw	c
the	c
princess	c
crying	c
.	c

They	c
really	c
loved	c
her	c
and	c
they	c
asked	c
a	c
prince	c
who	c
loved	c
the	c
princess	c
to	c
protect	c
her	c
.	c

But	c
,	c
one	c
the	i
day	c
,	c
the	c
princess	c
went	c
back	c
to	c
the	c
moon	c
with	c
guards	c
from	c
the	c
moon	c
although	c
the	c
prince	c
and	c
his	c
army	c
tried	c
hard	c
to	c
protect	c
her	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs.	c
Ryan	c
,	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
the	c
letter	c
which	c
brought	c
me	c
such	c
good	c
news	c
.	c

I	c
enjoyed	c
a	c
lot	c
participating	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
and	c
hope	c
to	c
apreciate	i
the	c
travel	i
I	c
won	i
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
will	c
give	c
you	c
with	c
pleasure	c
some	c
information	c
about	c
myself	c
you	c
need	c
to	c
have	c
.	c

As	c
I	c
have	c
a	c
chance	c
to	c
do	c
2	c
activities	c
while	c
I	c
am	c
at	c
the	c
Camp	c
,	c
I	c
will	c
choose	c
singing	c
which	i
I	c
am	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
and	i
swimming	c
which	i
I	c
am	c
fond	c
of	c
but	c
unfortunately	i
,	c
not	c
a	c
professional	c
.	c

In	i
the	i
end	i
I	c
would	c
like	c
you	c
to	c
tell	c
me	c
if	c
I	c
should	c
take	c
some	c
special	c
clothes	c
and	c
also	c
the	i
sum	c
of	c
money	c
I	c
will	c
need	c
...	c
during	c
my	c
vacation	c
.	c

I	c
wish	c
you	c
all	c
the	c
best	c
and	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

Sincerely	c
yours	c
,	c

Kazanova	c

A	c
lot	c
of	c
women	c
would	c
never	c
agree	c
with	c
me	c
and	c
almost	c
all	c
the	c
men	c
of	i
the	c
world	c
would	c
never	c
believe	c
that	c
in	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	i
shopping	c
is	c
really	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

Eternal	c
crowds	c
,	c
high	c
prices	c
,	c
long	c
hours	c
of	c
choosing	c
a	c
suitable	c
thing	c
,	c
that	c
is	c
what	c
shopping	c
means	c
to	c
me	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
am	c
on	c
my	c
own	c
,	c
everything	c
is	c
fine	c
:	c
I	c
do	c
my	c
shopping	c
quickly	c
because	c
I	c
never	c
have	c
to	c
spend	c
hours	c
to	i
choose	i
what	c
I	c
really	c
want	c
either	c
for	c
myself	c
or	c
someone	c
else	c
.	c

But	c
sometimes	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
forget	c
my	c
opinion	c
and	c
spend	c
all	c
the	c
day	c
looking	i
for	i
my	i
mother	i
in	i
a	c
huge	c
department-store	c
.	c

Mrs.	c
Jane	c
Clark	c
,	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
's	c
a	c
great	c
idea	c
.	i

Advertisement	i
is	i
written	i
that	c
you	c
invite	c
stars	c
and	c
artist	i
from	c
around	c
the	c
world	c
.	c

This	c
is	c
very	i
incredible	c
but	c
from	i
only	i
six	i
countries	i
you	i
wrote	i
.	c

I	c
think	c
you	c
should	c
invite	c
from	i
ten	c
countries	c
because	c
there	c
are	c
more	c
and	c
more	c
stars	c
and	c
artists	c
in	c
the	c
world	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
invite	i
from	i
more	i
countries	i
to	i
stars	i
and	i
artist	i
,	c
your	c
festival	c
will	c
be	c
unbelieved	i
.	c

Second	i
point	c
is	c
there	c
are	c
some	c
jazz	c
,	c
rock	c
and	c
classical	c
concerts	c
.	c

You	c
show	c
plays	c
and	c
films	c
.	c

I	c
congradulate	i
you	c
because	c
it	i
's	i
perfect	c
.	c

As	i
more	i
people	c
like	c
dance	c
shows	c
,	c
me	i
too	i
.	c

I	c
think	c
we	c
know	i
a	c
writer	i
life	c
or	c
how	c
is	i
he	i
writing	c
it	i
?	i
it	i
's	i
very	i
significant	c
thing	c
.	c

Lastly	c
,	c
you	c
said	c
'	c
one	c
reasonable-priced	i
weekend	c
ticket	c
for	c
all	c
events	c
'	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
can	c
pay	c
attention	c
to	c
my	c
small	c
suggestion	c
,	c
next	c
year	c
I	c
hope	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
unbelievable	i
festival	c
.	c

THANKS	c
!	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Dear	c
Edmond	c

I	c
miss	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
and	c
sorry	c
about	i
did	i
n't	i
write	i
you	c
some	i
letters	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
forgive	c
me	c
.	c

What	c
are	c
you	c
dong	i
today	i
,	i
how	i
is	c
your	c
school	c
?	c

My	c
school	c
opened	c
yesterday	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
know	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
new	c
student	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
very	c
difficult	c
because	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
anybody	c
.	c

However	c
;	i
today	c
I	c
used	i
to	c
my	c
school	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
got	i
two	c
sweet	c
girls	c
.	c

But	c
this	c
school	c
has	c
got	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
rules	c
and	c
in	c
our	c
class	c
,	i
we	c
have	c
been	c
talking	c
about	c
Rules	i
,	c
both	c
at	c
home	c
and	c
at	c
school	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
very	c
boring	c
.	c

You	c
continuously	c
must	c
study	c
hard	c
.	c

I	c
feel	c
very	c
bad	c
because	c
what	c
you	c
are	c
allowed	c
I	c
are	i
n't	i
allowed	c
to	c
do	c
at	c
home	c
.	c

Please	c
you	i
will	i
write	c
me	c
a	c
letter	c
quickly	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
!	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
"	i
Over	c
The	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
I	i
saw	c
in	c
your	c
theatre	c
last	c
week	c
.	c

I	c
looked	c
forward	c
a	i
perfect	c
evening	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
the	c
most	c
disappointing	c
one	c
I	c
have	c
ever	c
had	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
you	c
did	c
not	c
tell	c
the	c
truth	c
about	c
starring	i
.	c

The	c
advertisement	c
of	i
the	c
musical	c
said	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	i
unfortunately	i
there	c
was	c
someone	c
else	c
-	c
an	c
actor	c
which	i
I	c
do	c
not	c
like	c
and	c
if	c
I	c
have	i
known	c
that	c
he	c
was	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
I	i
woud	i
not	c
have	c
come	i
to	c
see	c
him	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
start	c
at	c
19.30	c
but	c
actually	i
started	c
at	c
20.15	c
.	c

Forty	i
five	i
minutes	c
later	c
!	c

You	c
also	c
have	i
mentioned	c
about	c
the	c
discounts	c
and	c
there	c
were	c
not	c
any	c
.	c

Keeping	c
in	c
mind	c
all	c
these	c
arguments	i
,	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
for	c
some	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
could	c
be	c
your	c
nice	c
apologise	i
for	c
all	c
my	c
problems	c
and	c
disappointments	c
.	c

Your	i
faithfuly	i
,	c

Contemporary	i
modern	i
technology	c
is	c
a	c
very	c
important	c
aspect	c
of	c
our	c
lives	c
.	c

All	c
these	c
products	c
of	c
science	c
are	c
with	c
me	c
since	i
the	c
very	c
beging	i
of	c
my	c
day	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
I	i
am	c
woken	c
up	c
by	c
my	c
electronic	c
alarm-clock	c
,	c
then	c
I	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
bathroom	c
and	c
there	c
is	c
hot	c
and	c
cold	c
water	c
,	i
next	i
I	c
eat	c
my	c
breakfast	c
and	c
listen	c
to	c
the	c
radio	c
.	c

All	c
these	c
things	c
are	c
the	c
ideas	i
of	c
the	i
technology	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
has	c
more	c
advantages	c
than	c
disadvantages	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
O.K.	c
I	c
am	c
really	c
glad	c
that	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
child	c
of	c
my	c
centuary	i
-	c
the	c
age	c
of	c
modern	c
science	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
our	c
lives	c
are	c
lives	c
with	c
technology	c
,	i
they	i
sometimes	c
mean	i
the	i
same	i
as	i
science	i
and	i
affects	i
not	i
on	i
at	i
each	i
other	i
but	i
together	i
.	c

So	c
how	c
has	c
the	i
modern	c
technology	c
changed	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
?	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
how	i
it	c
would	c
be	c
like	c
without	c
the	c
technology	c
.	c

This	c
would	c
be	c
an	c
ideal	c
opportunity	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
visit	c
the	c
United	c
States	c
to	c
learn	c
the	i
American	c
way	c
of	c
life	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
'd	c
like	i
to	i
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
tents	c
,	i
that	i
would	c
be	c
the	c
first	c
chance	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
sleep	c
on	c
the	c
outskirts	c
of	c
California	c
.	c

I	c
used	c
to	c
play	c
Golf	c
several	c
years	c
and	i
I	c
like	c
to	c
paint	c
the	i
composition	i
.	c

Therefore	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
about	c
the	c
weather	c
in	c
California	c
on	i
July	c
.	c

May	i
be	i
there	c
are	c
some	c
occasions	c
which	i
I	c
have	c
to	c
pay	c
myself	i
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

Yuna	c

It	c
is	c
a	c
largish	c
city	c
and	c
has	c
a	c
population	c
of	c
over	c
eight	c
million	c
.	c

I	c
went	c
to	c
school	c
there	c
for	c
twelve	c
years	c
.	c

There	c
are	c
all	c
kinds	c
of	c
facilities	c
what	i
you	c
can	c
imagine	c
.	c

Most	c
of	c
the	c
people	c
,	i
they	i
like	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
centre	i
of	c
City	i
that	i
's	c
Meong-Dong	c
where	c
is	i
the	i
uderground	i
acade	i
and	c
several	c
businesses	c
have	c
their	c
head	i
quarter	i
there	c
.	c

That	c
does	c
n't	c
cost	c
much	c
.	c

If	c
I	c
go	c
to	c
visit	c
my	c
family	c
in	c
Korea	c
,	c
I	c
usually	c
walk	c
along	c
the	c
Meong-Dong	c
streets	c
,	c
and	c
am	i
enjoying	i
to	i
have	i
eye-shopping	i
.	c

I	c
always	c
feel	c
very	c
tired	c
after	c
the	c
shopping	c
because	c
of	c
unfrendly	i
people	c
who	c
are	c
too	c
busy	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
or	c
Miss	c
Jane	c
X	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
the	c
annual	c
international	c
arts	c
festival	c
which	c
was	c
organized	c
on	c
21st-22nd	c
November	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
a	c
teacher	c
and	c
I	c
love	c
music	c
.	c

Most	c
of	c
the	c
events	c
which	c
I	c
had	i
seen	i
were	c
good	c
.	c

I	c
visited	c
art	c
exhibitions	c
.	c

There	c
were	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
nice	c
pictures	c
,	c
sculptures	c
and	c
other	c
creative	c
works	c
.	c

At	c
festival	i
I	c
could	c
talk	c
with	c
writers	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
an	c
excellent	c
idea	c
to	c
make	i
one	c
reasonaly-priced	i
weekend	c
ticket	c
for	c
all	c
events	c
.	c

A	c
lot	c
of	c
people	c
could	c
visit	c
as	c
many	c
events	c
as	c
the	i
they	c
could	i
.	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
surprised	c
when	c
I	c
knew	i
that	c
stars	i
and	c
artists	c
were	c
only	i
from	i
six	c
countries	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
too	c
little	i
for	c
this	c
festival	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
pitty	i
that	c
too	i
small	i
halls	i
were	i
used	i
for	i
classical	i
concerts	i
.	c

I	c
like	c
going	c
to	c
classical	c
concerts	c
but	c
at	c
this	c
festival	c
the	c
sounds	i
of	c
music	i
were	i
terrible	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
some	c
suggestion	i
for	c
next	c
year	c
's	c
festival	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
great	c
if	c
you	c
invite	c
more	c
famous	c
singers	c
and	c
bands	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
your	c
answer	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

There	c
are	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
folk	c
stories	c
in	i
the	c
world	c
and	c
there	c
are	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
folk	c
stories	c
in	c
Estonia	c
,	i
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
one	c
of	c
them	c
.	c

The	c
man	c
was	c
old	c
and	c
his	c
sons	c
were	c
young	c
.	c

One	c
day	c
the	c
man	c
quarreled	i
with	c
his	c
sons	c
and	c
they	c
left	c
the	c
house	c
trying	i
to	c
find	c
work	c
.	c

And	c
they	c
had	i
lived	i
far	c
from	c
their	c
father	c
for	c
two	c
years	c
.	c

They	c
grow	i
up	c
and	c
became	c
wise	c
.	c

When	c
the	c
sons	c
were	c
old	c
they	c
began	c
to	c
tell	i
about	c
their	c
life	c
beginning	i
with	c
this	c
story	c
happend	i
a	c
long	c
time	c
ago	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
happy	c
when	c
your	c
letter	c
arrived	c
,	c
yesterday	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
really	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
tents	i
because	c
I	c
love	c
sleeping	c
outdoors	c
and	c
listening	c
noises	i
from	c
outside	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
wondering	c
the	i
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
that	c
I	c

At	c
the	c
concert	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
clear	i
and	c
organized	i
all	c
the	c
people	c
who	c
were	c
in	i
,	c
but	c
at	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
the	c
night	c
I	c
was	c
able	c
to	c
talk	c
with	c
one	c
of	c
my	c
favourite	c
pop	c
singer	i
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
it	i
was	c
the	c
experience	c
I	c
particularly	i
liked	c
most	c
and	c
which	c
I	c
will	c
never	c
forget	c
.	c

Looking	c

to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c

Dear	c

I	c
saw	c
just	i
other	i
starring	i
that	c
was	c
completely	c
difference	i
from	c
your	i
brochar	i

To	c
make	c
the	c
matter	c
worse	c
,	c
I	c
was	i
travelling	i
to	c
London	c
to	c
see	c
this	c
famous	c
starring	i
but	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
see	c
any	c
shows	c
of	i
them	i
.	c

It	c
make	i
me	c
a	c
bit	c
angry	c
.	c

According	c
in	i
your	c
brochour	i
,	c
it	i
was	i
started	i

but	c
it	c
was	i
started	i
at	c
20.15	c
p.m.	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
sleep	c
and	c
very	i
anoying	i
.	c

I	c
had	c
to	c
pay	c
full	c
prise	i
.	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
hungry	c
and	c
tired	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	i
refund	c
some	c
money	i
back	i

I	c
paid	c
for	i
the	i
show	i
Â£	i
50.00	i
I	i
also	c
have	c
a	c
recite	i

I	c
would	c
like	c
you	c
to	c
give	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c

you	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
know	i
her	c
for	c
five	c
years	c
.	c

and	i
we	c
were	i
love	i
each	c
other	c
very	c
much	c
.	c

One	c
day	c
,	c
I	c
was	i
falling	i
in	c
love	c
with	c
closest	i
freind	i
.	c

My	c
boy	i
freind	i
was	c
very	c
handsome	c
,	c
clever	c
and	c
very	c
polite	c
.	c

We	c
were	c
stedy	i
at	i
the	c
same	c
class	c
at	c
school	c
and	c
he	c
also	c
knowed	i
Pat	c
as	c
well	c
.	c

Personally	c
,	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
keep	c
serets	i
because	c
I	c
afraid	i
that	c
we	c
might	c
have	i
splited	i
up	c
.	c

And	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
make	c
sure	c
that	c
he	c
was	i
relly	i
love	i
me	c
.	c

My	c
boy	i
freind	i
told	c
me	c
that	c
he	c
wanted	c
to	c
surprise	c
his	c
freind	i
in	c
his	c
class	c
when	c
the	i
times	i
comes	i
.	c

I	c
felt	c
unhappy	c
sometimes	c
.	c

I	c
told	c
her	c
everything	c
abat	i
my	c
boyfreind	i
and	c
when	c
we	c
were	i
met	i
each	c
other	c
and	c
evertauly	i
we	i
were	i
falling	i
in	c
love	c
.	c

After	c
I	c
told	c
her	c
I	c
felt	c
my	c
feeling	c
had	c
been	c
released	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
happy	c
.	c

On	c
Monday	c
morning	c
,	c
I	c
walked	c
into	c
the	c
class	c
and	c
all	c
of	c
my	c
freind	i
was	i
shouting	c
at	c
me	c
and	c
called	i
my	c
name	c
and	c
my	i
boyfreind	i
.	c

I	c
was	c
absolutely	i
ambaressed	i
and	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
ran	i
out	c
of	c
the	c
class	c
.	c

I	c
felt	c
very	c
angry	c
to	i
Pat	c
and	c
I	c
should	c
n't	c
have	c
told	c
her	c
about	c
my	c
boy	i
friend	i
.	c

I	c
felt	c
regret	c
but	c
too	i
late	i
it	i
was	c
n't	c
secret	i
any	i
more	i
now	c
.	c

About	c

I	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c

These	c
days	c
people	c
have	i
been	i
shopping	c
more	c
often	c
than	c
they	c
used	c
to	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
sometimes	c
you	c
can	c
get	c
really	c
nervous	i
about	i
shopping	c
like	i
when	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
deal	c
with	c
unhelpful	c
shop	c
assistants	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
a	c
very	c
common	c
fact	i
these	c
days	c
and	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
be	c
patient	c
if	c
you	c
really	c
want	c
to	c
buy	c
something	c
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
like	c
all	c
things	c
in	c
life	c
,	c
shopping	c
can	c
be	c
pleasent	i

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
recived	i
your	c
letter	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
excited	c
about	c
the	c
camp	c
.	c

One	c
of	c
the	c
activities	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
do	c
is	c
Climbing	c
,	i
I	c
have	c
n't	c
done	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
it	c
but	c
I	c
've	c
always	c
found	c
it	c
interesting	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
this	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
good	c
opportunity	c
to	c
become	c
better	c
in	i
it	c
.	c

The	c
other	c
activity	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
take	i
is	c
tennis	c
,	c
I	c
'm	c
quite	c
good	c
at	c
it	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
practising	i
for	c
four	c
years	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
what	c
type	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
should	c
take	c
and	c
also	c
if	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
take	c
money	i
with	c
me	c

13th	c
June	c
,	c
2000	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

It	c
was	c
so	c
exciting	c
.	c

This	c
is	c
what	c
happened	c
:	c
when	c
I	c
arrive	i
they	c
told	c
me	c
that	c
I	c
was	c
helping	c
in	i
backstage	c
with	c
the	c
scenery	c
,	i
then	c
the	c
group	c
arrived	c
,	c
we	c
chat	c
for	c
like	c
15	c
minutes	c
then	i
they	c
had	c
to	c
go	c
on	c
stage	c
.	c

Here	c
is	c
where	c
the	c
good	c
part	c
starts	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
doing	c
the	c
courtines	i
(	c
opening	c
and	c
closing	c
)	c
when	c
Nick	c
came	c
to	i
me	c
and	c
ask	i
me	c
to	c
go	c
on	c
stage	c
with	c
him	c
,	i
my	i
heart	c
started	c
beating	c
very	c
hard	c
.	c

The	c
next	c
second	c
I	c
was	c
in	c
front	c
of	c
more	c
than	c
2	c
thousand	c
people	c
dancing	c
with	c
The	c
Backstreet	c
Boys	c
.	c

Well	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
go	c
now	c
.	c

At	i
first	i
,	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
say	c
how	c
I	i
am	i
happy	i
to	c
have	c
won	c
this	c
prize	c
and	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
on	i
July	c
because	c
this	c
is	c
the	c
only	c
month	c
given	i
to	c
me	c
by	c
my	c
employer	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
because	c
I	c
can	i
not	i
sleep	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
(	c
it	c
is	c
too	c
hot	c
and	c
the	c
floor	c
is	c
too	c
hard	c
for	c
my	c
back	c
)	c
.	c

Concerning	c
the	c
two	c
activities	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
choose	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
swim	c
and	c
play	c
tennis	c
(	c
I	c
have	c
a	c
good	c
level	c
in	i
each	c
sports	i
)	c
.	c

Finally	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
prepare	i
and	c
which	i
sorts	c
of	c
clothes	c
are	c
usually	c
weared	i
in	c
California	c
.	c

Pablo	c
Fernandez	c

Many	c
classes	c
and	c
activities	c
are	c
important	c
in	c
our	c
school	c
But	i
I	c
have	c
to	c
make	c
a	c
choice	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
select	c
them	i
The	i
class	i
of	i
mecanics	i
seem	i
to	c
be	c
the	c
more	i
important	c
lesson	c
.	c

It	c
use	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
technics	i
that	c
we	c
learn	c
in	c
other	c
classes	c
.	c

Besides	c
it	c
gives	i
all	c
the	c
areas	c
covered	c
by	c
a	c
mecanic	i
ingenier	i
and	c
it	c
is	c
very	c
important	c
in	c
a	c
school	c
where	c
you	c
will	c
probably	c
become	c
a	c
mecanic	i
ingenier	i
It	i
lets	c
us	c
specify	i
our	c
abilities	c
in	i
the	c
part	c
of	c
mecanics	i
that	c
we	c
prefer	c
.	c

Actually	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
a	c
regret	c
,	i
there	c
is	c
no	c
ethic	i
lessons	i
,	i
It	c
would	c
show	c
us	c
how	c
use	i
our	c
knowledge	c
.	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
expect	c
that	c
these	c
two	c
weeks	c
will	c
be	c
as	i
a	c
big	c
rest	c
.	c

Third	c
,	c
you	c
need	c
to	c
know	c
which	c
sport	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
to	i
practise	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
choice	i
photography	c
and	c
tennis	c
.	c

In	c
photography	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
just	c
a	c
novice	c
,	c
nevertheless	c
I	c
have	c
got	c
a	c
suitable	c
camera	c
...	c

(	c
I	c
guess	c
that	c
you	c
should	c
n't	c
borrow	c
some	i
!	c

About	i
tennis	c
,	c
I	c
play	i
for	c
eight	c
years	c
and	c
I	c
am	i
used	i
to	i
sit	i
for	i
competition	i
.	c

To	c
finish	c
,	c
I	c
wonder	c
if	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
bring	c
some	c
money	c
or	c
if	c
all	i
has	c
been	c
already	c
payed	i
and	i
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
should	c
I	c
bring	c
?	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Joachim	c

Needless	i

There	i
are	i

the	c

the	c
time	c
we	c
have	c

between	c
lessons	c

,	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
on	c
Central	i
Exhibition	c
Hall	c
so	c
I	c
do	c
not	c
think	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
problem	c
to	c
get	c
there	c
.	c

Briefly	c
,	c
we	c
would	c
be	c
happy	c
if	c
we	c
could	c
see	c
this	c
show	c
instead	c
of	c
the	c
Science	c
Museum	c
.	c

Also	c
,	c
it	c
's	c
free	c
for	c
students	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

Although	c
human	i
is	i
a	i
social	c
creature	i
,	c
all	c
people	c
need	c
an	c
area	c
to	i
be	i
able	i
to	i
stay	i
away	i
from	c
other	c
people	c
.	c

This	c
is	c
essential	c
to	c
renew	c
the	c
energy	c
which	c
is	c
necessary	c
for	c
daily	c
life	c
.	c

Also	c
we	c
all	c
like	c
to	c
have	c
some	c
special	c
things	c
and	c
people	c
in	c
our	c
lives	c
to	c
help	c
us	c
to	c
feel	c
different	c
from	c
others	c
.	c

Thinking	c
about	c
famous	c
people	c
,	c
we	c
generally	c
tend	c
to	c
ignore	c
this	c
need	c
.	c

I	c
believe	c
this	c
feeling	c
sources	i
from	i
a	i
strange	i
though	i
;	c
when	c
somebody	c
gets	c
famous	c
,	c
whatever	c
the	c
job	c
is	c
they	c
do	c
,	c
we	c
think	c
we	c
have	c
some	c
kind	c
of	c
right	c
over	c
them	c
.	c

Consequently	c
we	c
demand	c
to	c
know	c
every	c
single	c
detail	c
about	c
them	c
and	c
their	c
lives	c
.	c

In	c
fact	c
,	c
what	c
is	c
a	c
need	c
for	c
ordinary	c
people	c
is	c
a	c
more	c
important	c
need	c
for	c
famous	c
people	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
quiet	i
sure	c
,	i
even	i
the	c
ones	c
,	i
who	c
have	c
chosen	c
their	c
occupies	i
just	c
to	c
be	c
famous	c
,	c
do	c
n't	c
like	c
to	c
be	c
pictured	i
when	c
they	c
believe	c
they	c
are	c
alone	c
.	c

The	c
situation	c
much	i
be	c
much	c
worse	c
for	c
the	c
ones	c
who	c
have	c
become	c
famous	c
without	c
desiring	c
this	i
.	c

Obviously	c
,	c
there	c
is	c
no	c
point	c
in	c
saying	c
"	c
famous	c
people	c
have	c
a	c
right	c
to	c
their	c
own	c
live.	i
"	c

Dear	c
manager	c
,	c

I	c
decided	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
19:30	c
show	c
so	c
I	c
arrived	c
on	c
time	c
at	c
19:00	c
o'clock	c
.	c

This	c
was	c
my	c
first	c
problem	c
.	c

At	c
19:15	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
impatient	c
waiting	i
for	c
the	c
show	c
begins	i
and	i
a	c
man	c
anounced	i
that	c
the	c
show	c
will	i
start	c
at	c
20:15	c
.	c

The	c
reason	c
they	c
gave	c
me	c
it	i
was	c
closed	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
being	c
repaired	c
.	c

Finaly	i
the	c
show	c
started	c
and	c
to	c
my	c
sorprise	i
my	c
favourite	c
actor	c
Danny	c
Brooke	c
had	c
been	c
replaced	c
by	c
another	c
actor	c
.	c

Now	c
what	c
I	c
hope	c
is	c
you	c
refound	i
me	c
my	c
money	c
,	i
it	i
was	c
a	c
horrible	c
evening	c
out	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

Last	c
month	c
was	c
my	c
grandmother	i
birthday	c
and	c
I	c
organised	c
a	c
party	c
for	c
her	c
.	c

My	c
grandmother	c
loves	c
the	i
parties	c
and	c
when	c
she	c
was	c
young	c
she	c
used	c
to	c
organise	c
big	c
parties	c
for	c
all	c
the	i
family	c
and	c
friends	c
.	c

I	c
organised	c
everything	c
like	c
:	c
the	c
place	c
,	c
the	c
food	c
,	c
the	c
decoration	c
,	i
I	c
sent	c
letters	c
by	c
post	c
to	c
everybody	c
she	c
knows	c
.	c

It	c
seems	i
to	i
be	c
the	c
bigger	i
party	c
of	c
her	c
life	c
.	c

I	c
thought	c
she	i
could	c
have	i
a	c
show	c
in	i
this	c
special	c
party	c
so	c
I	c
talked	c
to	c
Pat	c
,	c
my	c
best	c
friend	c
,	c
if	i
she	c
could	c
help	c
me	c
as	c
she	c
works	c
in	c
the	c
production	c
of	c
T.V.	c
programes	i
.	c

I	c
told	c
her	c
to	c
make	i
me	c
a	i
phone	i
cold	i
.	c

Pat	c
sent	c
to	i
my	i
house	i
a	i
fax	i
with	c
the	c
different	c
alternatives	c
she	c
thought	i
but	i
unfortunately	c
my	c
grandmother	c
was	c
there	c
and	c
she	c
saw	c
the	c
paper	c
so	c
the	c
sorprise	i
was	c
ended	i
.	c

But	c
after	i
all	i
the	i
party	i
was	i
great	i
.	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
reply	c
on	i
your	c
letter	c
concerned	i
about	c
the	c
holidays	i
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
in	c
the	c
U.SA	c
as	i
a	i
first	c
prize	c
in	c
the	c
competition	c
which	c
I	c
fortunately	c
won	c
last	c
month	c
.	c

About	c
the	c
activities	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
choose	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
it	c
is	c
quite	c
difficult	c
for	c
me	c
because	c
I	c
really	c
like	c
sports	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
think	c
the	c
best	c
option	c
is	c
swimming	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
practicing	i
it	c
during	i
5	c
years	c
so	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
keep	i
on	i
it	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
rather	c
tends	i
than	c
log	i
cabins	i
for	c
accommodation	i
because	c
the	i
last	c
summer	c
I	c
had	c
the	c
great	c
opportunity	c
to	c
be	i
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
and	c
now	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
know	c
the	i
other	c
one	i
.	i

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
how	c
is	i
the	i
weather	i
in	c
California	c
during	c
the	c
summer	c
to	i
bring	c
with	c
me	c
appropiate	i
clothes	c
and	c
the	c
last	c
thing	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
know	c
,	i
is	c
the	c
amount	c
of	c
money	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
bring	c
with	c
me	c
.	c

Introduction	c

To	c
make	c
easier	i
and	i
faster	i
this	i
report	i
,	c
it	c
was	c
necessary	c
to	c
make	c
a	c
questionarie	i
which	c
was	c
gave	i
out	c
in	c
the	c
school	c
.	c

After	c
collecting	c
the	c
answers	c
,	c
I	c
obtained	c
the	c
following	c
results	c
:	c

Despite	c
of	i
being	c
almost	c
300	c
students	c
,	c
the	c
answers	c
were	c
quite	c
similar	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
need	c
more	c
information	c
and	i
the	c
sheets	c
that	c
I	c
collected	c
,	c
please	c
do	c
not	c
hesitate	c
on	i
asking	i
me	c
for	c
them	c

To	c
:	c
Manager	c
of	c
the	c
Theatre	c

Few	i
weeks	c
ago	c
,	c
me	i
and	i
my	i
farmily	i
had	c
a	c
hoilday	i
in	c
London	c
,	i
the	i
hoilday	i
was	c
n't	c
too	c
good	c
!	c

Because	c
...	c

During	c
the	c
week	c
we	c
descide	i
where	c
we	c
want	i
to	c
go	c
,	i
we	i
all	c
agree	i
to	c
listen	c
to	c
music	c
so	c
than	i
we	c
descide	i
to	c
come	i
to	c
your	c
musical	c
show	c
and	c
listen	c
to	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c

Also	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
really	c
mind	c
that	c
the	c
show	c
start	i
late	c
but	c
the	c
rute	i
of	i
that	i
evening	i
was	i
rucented	i
.	c

And	c
there	c
were	c
no	c
discounts	c
when	c
you	c
say	i
there	c
is	i
!	c

Why	c
is	c
it	c
every	i
thing	i
that	c
on	i
the	i
canidates	i
were	i
wrong	c
and	c
different	c
what	i
we	c
had	i
.	c

We	c
do	c
n't	c
expect	c
much	i
bad	i
to	c
happened	i
in	i
our	c
hoilday	i
,	c
but	c
this	c
was	i
perfectic	i
show	i

it	c
was	c
the	c
worstest	i

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c

I	c
have	c
just	c
received	c
your	c
letter	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
really	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
going	c
to	i
this	c
trip	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
wondering	c
if	c
there	c
will	c
be	c
anywhere	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
wash	c
my	c
clothes	c
,	c
or	c
if	c
I	c
will	c
have	c
them	c
washed	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
when	c
the	c
shops	c
are	c
crowded	c
(	c
for	c
instance	c
,	c
just	c
before	c
Christmas	c
)	c
,	c
going	c
shopping	c
can	c
be	c
very	c
stressful	c
,	c
as	c
you	c
cannot	c
walk	c
freely	i
and	c
have	c
to	c
bear	i
endless	c
queues	c
.	c

Summing	c
up	c
,	c
going	c
shopping	c
can	c
be	c
a	c
relaxing	c
activity	c
if	c
you	c
choose	c
the	c
right	c
day	c
,	c
but	c
be	c
aware	c
of	c
how	c
dangerous	c
it	c
can	c
be	c
for	c
your	c
patience	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

When	c
the	c
show	c
had	c
finished	c
we	c
decided	c
to	c
go	c
for	c
a	c
snack	c
to	i
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
and	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
without	c
giving	i
any	c
reason	c
for	i
it	i
.	c

As	c
you	c
can	c
see	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
the	c
evening	c
we	c
expected	c
and	c
the	c
result	c
was	c
very	c
different	c
from	c
the	c
promises	c
you	c
made	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
reasonable	c
if	c
we	c
could	c
have	c
our	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
and	c
this	c
was	c
the	c
reason	c
why	c
the	c
party	c
was	c
n't	c
as	c
succesful	i
as	c
we	c
thought	c
.	c

My	i
and	c
my	c
friends	c
,	c
including	c
Pat	c
,	c
were	c
preparing	c
a	c
surprise	c
for	c
Sam	c
's	c
birthday	c
.	c

We	c
decided	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
his	c
place	c
(	c
I	c
've	c
got	c
a	c
copy	c
of	c
the	c
key	c
)	c
the	c
evening	c
before	c
his	c
birthday	c
while	c
he	c
was	c
at	c
work	c
and	c
decorate	c
the	c
lounch	i
,	c
then	c
turn	c
off	c
the	c
lights	c
and	c
wait	c
for	c
him	c
in	c
silence	c
until	c
he	c
arrived	c
.	c

Everybody	c
was	c
excited	c
about	c
the	c
idea	c
and	c
we	c
were	c
keeping	c
it	c
in	i
secret	c
in	c
front	c
of	c
Sam	c
.	c

Two	c
days	c
before	c
the	c
event	c
Carol	c
,	c
Albert	c
,	c
Sam	c
and	c
me	c
went	c
to	c
visit	c
Pat	c
in	c
her	c
house	c
and	c
she	c
invited	c
us	c
to	c
stay	c
for	c
dinner	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
her	c
aunt	c
inviting	i
her	c
for	i
the	c
weekend	c
so	c
Pat	c
said	c
very	c
loudly	c
:	c
"	c
I	c
'm	c
sorry	c
but	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
Sam	c
's	c
flat	c
and	c
decorate	c
it	c
,	i
it	c
's	c
a	c
surprise	c
,	c
do	c
n't	c
tell	c
anybody	c
"	c

Everybody	c
had	c
to	c
change	c
plans	i
and	c
the	c
party	c
became	c
a	c
normal	c
party	c
.	c

We	c
were	c
a	c
bit	c
disappointed	c
but	c
we	c
enjoyed	c
anyway	i
.	c

We	c
have	c
been	c
very	c
excited	c
about	c
this	c
and	c
coincidentely	i
we	c
have	c
found	c
another	c
option	c
to	c
add	c
in	i
our	c
programme	c
,	c
certainly	c
if	c
your	i
agree	c
with	c
.	i

However	c
your	i
decision	c
in	i
changing	i
a	i
little	i
bit	i
our	i
programme	i
,	i
we	i
would	c
suggest	c
just	c
on	i
Tuesday	i
afternoon	i
no	i
doing	i
shop	i
,	c
everything	i
else	c
could	c
stay	c
the	c
same	c
.	c

We	c
are	c
really	c
satisfied	c
in	i
sightseeing	i
by	c
bus	c
,	c
in	i
go	i
to	c
the	c
National	c
Gallery	c
,	c
but	c
the	c
whole	c
class	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
The	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	i
will	i
be	c
free	c
.	c

I	c
knew	c
,	c
I	c
could	c
die	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
dangerous	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
kew	i
I	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
.	c

This	c
sad	c
and	c
unlucky	c
day	c
was	c
on	c
Friday	c
1998	c
,	c
it	i
was	c
n't	c
13th	c
even	c
it	c
look	c
liked	i
,	i
but	c
it	c
was	c
my	c
25th	c
birthday	c
.	c

Everything	c
was	c
going	c
so	c
bad	i
and	c
I	c
knew	c
,	c
I	c
could	c
die	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
at	c
home	c
making	i
me	i
up	i
before	c
to	i
go	i
to	c
a	c
restaurant	c
with	c
my	c
friends	c
and	c
,	c
sudenlly	i
,	c
he	c
rang	c
the	c
bell	c
,	i
he	i
was	c
so	c
nervous	i
with	c
a	c
gun	c
in	c
his	c
hands	c
and	c
no	i
longer	i
I	i
could	i
speak	i
he	c
took	c
me	c
out	c
with	c
him	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
tried	c
to	c
think	c
in	i
stopping	c
him	c
,	c
but	c
he	c
was	c
stronger	c
than	c
me	c
and	c
he	c
had	c
used	c
all	c
his	c
power	c
to	c
scared	i
me	c
and	c
he	c
forced	c
me	c
to	c
buy	c
cocain	i
using	c
my	c
cheques	c
.	c

The	c
dangerous	c
man	c
who	c
we	c
'd	c
gone	c
to	c
buy	c
drugs	c
was	i
upset	c
with	c
my	c
brother	c
and	c
had	c
decided	c
to	c
kill	c
him	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
had	c
killed	c
him	c
first	c
.	c

If	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
do	c
it	c
,	c
I	c
knew	c
I	c
would	c
die	c
,	i
my	i
option	c
was	c
my	c
life	c
,	c
but	c
now	c
I	c
have	c
n't	c
any	i
chance	c
to	c
live	c
because	c
I	c
'm	c
in	c
the	i
prison	c
.	c

The	c
first	c
problem	c
concerned	c
the	c
main	c
actor	c
of	i
the	c
show	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
also	c
written	c
in	c
the	c
show	c
's	c
addvertisement	i
that	c
there	c
would	c
be	c
discounts	c
available	c
for	i
the	c
tickets	c
.	c

The	c
fourth	c
problem	c
concerned	c
the	c
Theatre	c
Restaurant	c
.	c

Even	c
though	c
the	c
addvertisement	i
said	c
we	c
should	c
visit	c
it	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
and	c
no	c
explanations	c
were	c
given	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c

I	i
all	c
happened	c
a	c
year	c
ago	c
,	c
when	c
Pat	c
and	c
I	c
were	c
still	c
best	c
friends	c
and	c
used	c
to	c
tell	c
each	c
other	c
everything	c
.	c

I	c
went	c
home	c
that	c
day	c
after	c
having	c
told	c
Pat	c
my	c
deepest	c
secret	c
with	c
a	c
weird	c
feeling	c
in	c
my	c
heart	c
.	c

Now	c
,	c
unfortunately	c
,	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
a	c
boyfriend	c
or	c
a	c
best	c
friend	c
,	c
all	c
because	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
about	c
an	c
incident	c
I	i
had	i
with	i
the	c
musical	c
show	i
which	c
was	c
presented	i
by	i
your	c
theatre	c
during	c
my	c
week	c
's	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
very	c
disappointing	c
for	c
me	c
that	c
the	c
starring	i
was	c
not	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
as	c
your	c
company	c
had	c
published	i
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
the	c
musical	i
show	c
was	c
said	c
to	c
start	c
at	c
19:30	c
but	c
it	c
really	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
.	c

As	c
the	c
show	c
finished	c
later	i
,	c
we	c
decided	c
to	c
eat	c
something	c
at	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
but	c
to	i
our	c
surprise	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

As	c
a	c
result	c
,	c
we	c
came	c
back	c
home	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
eat	c
some	c
fast	c
food	c
.	c

An	i
other	i
thing	c
is	c
that	c
there	c
was	c
any	i
discount	c
available	c
so	c
we	c
spend	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
money	c
in	i
such	i
a	c
bad	c
show	c
.	c

Before	c
this	c
week	c
ends	c
,	c
I	c
want	c
your	c
company	c
to	c
give	c
me	c
the	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

Otherwise	c
,	c
I	c
will	c
sue	c
your	c
company	c
.	c

Your	i
faithfully	c
,	c

Manuela	c
T.	c
Miracola	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

We	c
went	c
to	c
a	c
place	c
called	c
'	c
Deli	c
'	c
where	c
we	c
talked	c
a	c
lot	c
about	c
our	c
school	c
,	c
the	c
exams	c
and	c
,	c
as	c
we	c
usually	c
did	c
,	c
about	c
our	c
friends	c
and	c
boy	i
friends	i
.	c

We	c
asked	c
each	c
other	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
questions	c
but	c
then	c
we	c
started	c
talking	c
about	c
things	c
that	c
had	c
never	c
been	c
talked	c
about	c
with	c
anybody	c
.	c

The	c
problem	c
started	c
when	c
I	c
confesed	i
her	i
that	c
I	c
had	c
fall	i
in	c
love	c
with	c
Larry	c
,	c
who	c
was	c
my	c
cousin	c
's	c
boyfriend	c
.	c

In	c
spite	c
of	c
the	c
fact	c
that	c
I	c
told	c
her	c
to	c
keep	c
it	c
as	i
a	c
secret	c
,	c
she	c
went	c
to	c
my	c
cousin	c
's	c
house	c
and	c
made	i
the	i
retelling	i
of	i
what	i
I	i
had	i
exactly	i
told	c
her	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
The	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
manager	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
your	c
product	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
you	c
to	c
back	i
my	c
money	c
because	c
that	i
was	i
not	i
same	i
as	i
your	i
advertisement	i
.	c

I	c
was	c
planning	c
to	c
spend	c
my	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
when	c
I	c
found	c
your	c
advertisement	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
advertisement	c
,	c
you	c
mentioned	c
actors	c
,	c
time	c
,	c
price	i
discount	c
and	c
equipment	i
.	c

DANNY	c
BROOK	c
is	c
one	c
of	c
my	c
favorite	i
actor	i
so	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
buy	c
a	c
ticket	c
even	i
if	i
I	c
cancel	i
my	c
apointment	i
on	c
that	c
day	c
at	c
18=30	i
and	c
aslo	i
notice	i
of	i
price	i
discount	i
impressed	i
me	i
.	c

It	c
made	c
me	c
so	c
dissapoint	i
and	c
angry	c
.	c

You	c
should	c
back	i
my	c
money	c
immedeastry	i
because	c
that	c
night	c
was	c
far	c
from	c
parfect	i
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

Faithfully	c
,	c

He	c
always	c
tried	c
to	c
say	c
nothing	c
and	c
did	c
.	c

Whenever	c
he	c
has	c
secrets	i
,	c
his	c
nose	c
moves	c
quickly	c
.	c

He	c
had	i
not	i
liked	i
this	c
habit	c
and	c
had	c
thought	c
it	c
was	c
wrost	i
of	c
him	c
until	c
he	c
solved	c
a	c
big	c
crime	c
.	c

When	c
all	c
money	i
had	c
gone	c
from	c
a	c
bank	c
,	c
nobady	i
there	i
except	c
Pat	c
.	c

Pat	c
did	c
n't	c
say	c
anything	c
.	c

But	c
his	c
nose	c
moved	c
quickly	c
when	c
police	i
showed	c
a	i
picture	c
of	c
bank	i
robbers	c
.	c

Although	c
bank	i
robbers	c
complained	c
to	c
Pat	c
,	c
he	c
said	i
nothing	i
to	i
anybody	i
.	c

He	c
just	c
moved	c
his	c
nose	c
!	c
!	c

The	c
town	c
became	c
peace	i
again	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
a	c
great	c
admirer	c
of	c
the	c
actor	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
who	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
be	c
starring	c
in	c
the	c
musical	c
.	c

Surprizingly	i
there	c
was	c
a	c
complete	i
different	c
actor	c
starring	c
.	c

For	c
some	c
unknown	c
reason	c
it	c
did	c
not	c
start	c
until	c
20:15	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
take	i
benefit	i
from	i
the	c
discounts	c
available	c
,	c
but	c
when	c
I	c
came	c
to	c
buy	c
my	c
ticket	c
I	c
was	c
told	c
there	c
were	c
no	c
discounts	c
available	c
.	c

After	c
the	c
show	c
I	c
had	c
planned	c
to	c
have	c
dinner	c
at	c
the	c
Theatre	c
Restaurant	c
.	c

I	c
bought	c
a	c
ticket	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
"	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
"	c
during	c
my	c
holiday	c
.	c

Indeed	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
a	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
.	c

Therefore	c
I	c
think	c
the	c
least	c
I	c
can	c
ask	c
from	c
you	c
is	c
to	c
give	c
me	c
the	c
money	c
back	c
for	c
the	c
ticket	c

The	c
Old	c
Man	c

Ernest	c
Hemingway	c

Dear	c
Sara	c

I	c
have	c
heard	c
that	c
they	c
will	i
read	c
"	c
The	c
Old	c
Man	c
and	c
the	c
Sea	c
"	c
on	c
the	c
radio	c
P1	i
on	i
Wednesday	c
next	c
week	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
a	c
book	c
written	c
by	c
Ernest	c
Hemingway	c
.	c

The	c
basic	c
story	c
of	c
the	c
book	c
is	c
in	c
fact	c
quite	c
simple	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
about	c
a	c
tough	c
old	c
fisherman	c
from	c
Cuba	c
who	c
sails	c
out	c
alone	c
in	c
a	c
small	c
boat	c
to	c
fish	c
.	c

This	c
day	c
he	c
is	c
lucky	c
.	c

On	c
his	c
way	c
back	c
home	c
to	c
port	c
he	c
is	c
attacked	c
by	c
sharks	c
who	c
eats	i
his	i
catched	i
fish	i
pice	i
by	c
pice	i
.	c

The	c
fisherman	c
kills	c
many	c
sharks	c
with	c
different	i
weapons	c
,	c
but	c
when	c
he	c
reaches	c
port	c
there	c
is	c
only	c
head	i
,	c
tail	c
and	c
bones	c
left	c
of	c
the	c
huge	c
swordfish	c
.	c

Mr.	c
Hemingway	c
makes	c
this	c
simple	c
story	c
a	c
real	c
adventure	c
.	c

He	c
make	i
you	c
experience	c
in	c
detail	c
all	c
the	c
struggles	c
the	c
fisherman	c
has	c
when	c
he	c
fights	c
with	c
the	c
swordfish	c
and	c
the	c
sharks	c
.	c

This	c
tale	c
is	c
very	c
amazing	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
no	c
surprise	c
Mr.	c
Hemingway	c
was	c
awarded	c
the	c
Nobel	c
Prize	c
for	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
really	c
think	c
you	c
should	c
take	i
your	i
time	i
and	i
listen	i
to	c
it	c
on	c
the	c
radio	c
on	c

I	c
am	c

to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
'	c
OVER	c
THE	c
RAINBOW	c
'	c
I	c
attended	c
three	c
days	c
ago	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
disappointed	c
with	c
the	c
performance	c
and	c
apart	c
from	c
that	c
there	c
were	c
many	c
problems	i
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
the	c
start	i
time	c
was	i
at	i
19.30	c
p.m	c
,	c
but	c
the	c
play	c
started	c
at	c
20.15	c
p.m.	c
People	c
were	c
fed	c
up	c
with	c
waiting	c
so	c
long	c
and	c
most	c
of	c
them	c
apart	i
from	c
me	c
were	i
rather	c
nervous	i
.	c

From	c
my	c
point	c
of	c
view	c
I	c
think	c
he	c
was	c
such	c
a	c
very	c
bad	c
actor	c
that	c
was	i
impossible	c
to	c
fine	i
another	c
with	c
the	c
same	c
features	i
.	c

As	c
far	c
as	c
the	c
tickets	c
is	i
concerned	c
no	c
discounts	c
were	c
available	c
,	c
so	c
,	c
moreover	i
I	c
found	c
it	c
expensive	c
.	c

At	i
the	c
end	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
go	c
home	c
as	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
the	c
coffee	c
pot	c
did	c
not	c
work	c
.	c

What	c
nonsense	c
!	c

The	c
evening	c
was	c
a	c
disaster	c
and	c
I	c
wonder	c
if	c
I	c
have	c
not	c
the	c
right	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
for	i
returning	i
my	c
money	c
,	c
as	c
I	c
think	c
it	i
is	i
fair	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

MARIA	c
GARDENT	c

But	c
this	c
time	c
things	c
have	i
gone	c
too	c
far	c
.	c

I	c
relyied	i
on	c
her	c
and	c
our	c
relationship	c
was	c
excellent	c
.	c

She	c
has	c
given	c
away	i
to	c
my	c
mother	c
that	c
I	c
told	c
her	c
a	c
lie	c
as	c
far	c
as	c
the	c
weekend	c
was	c
concerned	c
.	c

Pat	c
told	c
her	c
I	c
had	c
n't	c
spent	c
those	c
days	c
with	c
her	c
,	c
but	c
with	c
my	c
boyfriend	c
in	c
the	c
mountain	i
.	c

Moreover	c
I	c
was	c
punished	c
hardly	i
by	c
my	c
father	c
and	c
now	c
we	c
do	c
n't	c
talk	c
each	i
other	c
.	c

Since	c
then	c
I	c
have	c
n't	c
seen	c
Pat	c
anymore	c
and	c
she	c
seems	i
not	i
regret	i
that	i
happened	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
'll	c
try	c
to	c
forget	c
her	c
and	c
carry	c
on	c
my	i

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

I	c
'm	c
in	c
London	c
first	i
time	c
and	c
I	c
wondered	c
what	c
is	c
interesting	c
on	c
yours	i
stage	c
:	c
I	c
read	c
in	c
newspaper	i
the	c
advertisment	i
about	c
best	i
musical	c
show	c
.	c

In	c
advertisment	i
was	i
-	c
"	c
discounts	c
available	c
"	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
teacher	i
and	c
in	c
Polan	i
I	c
have	c
discounts	c
but	c
in	c
England	c
no	i
,	i
I	c
know	c
this	c
is	c
other	i
country	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
disappointed	c
because	c
you	c
wrote	c
about	c
it	c
!	c

Otherwise	c
,	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
started	c
too	c
late	c
at	i
20	c
15	c
not	i
17	c
30	c
!	c

This	c
was	c
a	c
waste	c
of	c
time	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
suppresed	i
when	c
I	c
saw	c
different	i
actor	c
,	i
it	i
was	c
n't	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
.	c

This	c
musical	c
show	c
was	c
n't	c
"	c
the	c
best	c
"	c
.	c

I	c
went	c
out	c
earlier	i
but	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
very	i
disappointing	c
evening	c
.	c

I	c
would	i
ask	c
you	c
for	c
money	i
back	c

This	c
is	c
very	i
interesting	c
question	c
for	c
us	c
and	c
maybe	c
very	c
important	c
too	c

black	c
skin	i
,	c
the	c
trouses	i
was	i
quite	c
short	c
and	c
the	c
jackets	c
was	i
elegant	c
with	c
blazzend	i
materiell	i
.	c

I	c
think	c
the	c
fashion	c
of	c
the	c
future	c
will	c
be	c
very	c
different	c
but	c
suitable	c
for	c
all	c
people	c
.	c

The	i
people	i
will	c
wear	c
clothes	c
from	i
natural	c
materials	c
like	c
silk	c
,	c
comfortable	i
and	c
elgant	i
.	c

The	c
colours	c
will	c
be	c
very	i
good	c
quality	c
and	c
the	c
fashion	i
will	c
be	i
changed	i
very	c
quickly	c
like	c
now	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
,	c

The	c
programme	c
seems	c
to	c
be	c
really	c
interesting	c
,	c
especially	c
visiting	c
the	c
Science	c
Museum	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
the	c
students	c
in	c
my	c
class	c
have	c
seen	c
an	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
,	c
which	c
is	c
going	c
to	c
take	c
place	c
on	c
14th	i
of	c
March	c
at	c
Central	i
Exhibition	c
Hall	c
.	c

Visitors	c
will	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
latest	c
fashions	c
,	c
leisure	c
and	c
sports	c
wear	c
and	c
also	c
get	c
some	c
help	c
with	c
make	i
up	i
or	c
hairstyle	i
.	c

It	c
would	c
be	c
great	i
opportunity	c
to	c
see	c
this	c
show	c
,	c
because	c
we	c
are	c
all	c
very	c
interested	c
in	c
fashion	i
subject	i
.	c

What	c
is	c
more	c
,	c
admittion	i
for	c
students	c
is	c
free	c
.	c

Do	c
you	c
think	c
that	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
possible	c
to	c
change	c
the	c
programme	c
of	c
our	c
trip	c
?	c

In	c
our	c
opinion	c
we	c
could	c
join	i
the	c
show	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
,	c
after	c
visiting	c
the	c
Science	c
Museum	c
.	c

In	i
these	i
days	c
,	c
when	c
we	c
can	c
see	c
picture	i
of	c
famous	i
person	c
almost	i
on	i
every	i
first	i
page	i
of	i
the	i
newspaper	c
,	c
it	c
's	c
a	i
quite	i
common	c
topic	c
.	i

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
famous	c
people	c
deserve	c
to	c
have	c
private	i
life	c
.	c

Journalists	c
should	c
not	c
follow	c
them	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
,	c
trying	c
to	c
make	i
an	c
interview	c
or	c
taking	i
an	c
'	c
interesting	c
'	c
picture	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
really	c
understand	c
how	c
annoying	c
or	c
depressing	c
it	c
can	c
be	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
we	c
could	c
say	c
that	c
they	c
decided	c
to	c
have	c
such	i
kind	c
of	c
life	c
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
it	c
is	c
very	c
hard	c
to	c
find	c
an	c
answer	c
to	c
this	c
question	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
everyone	c
needs	c
to	c
have	i
some	c
part	c
of	c
his	c
life	c
being	i
a	i
secret	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	c

,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c

For	c

of	c

it	c

Hoping	c
that	c

thanks	c
in	c

Yours	c
Faithfully	i

According	i
to	i
me	i
,	c
you	c
ca	i
n't	i
deserve	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
private	c
life	c
when	c
you	c
're	c
famous	c
because	c
when	c
to	i
start	i
you	i
career	c
you	c
know	c
that	c
medias	i
will	c
be	c
hunting	c
you	c
everywhere	c
and	c
more	i
famous	c
you	c
get	c
worst	i
it	c
is	c
going	c
to	c

that	c
the	i

people	c
wants	i
to	c

they	i
saw	c
them	c
many	c
time	i
on	c

So	c
people	c
wonder	c
about	c
them	c

And	c
famous	c
people	c
like	c
it	c
because	c
if	c
you	c
're	c
a	c
star	c
or	c
whatever	c
it	i
's	c
because	c
you	c
like	c
to	c
show	c
yourself	c
.	c

if	c
you	c
're	c
famous	c
you	c
cannot	c
have	c
private	i
life	c
because	c
all	c
of	c
this	c
is	c
a	c
part	c
of	c
their	i
job	c
.	c

Dear	c
Ms	c
Helen	c

this	c
trip	c
in	i
July	c
,	c
according	c
to	c
our	c
team	c
's	c
shudule	i
.	c

The	c
next	c
thing	c
-	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
spend	c
all	c
nights	i
in	c
tent	i
,	c
so	c
I	c
can	c
move	c
it	c
to	c
the	c
place	c
will	i
better	i
suite	i
me	i
.	c

-	i
I	c
like	c
to	c
wake	c
up	c
with	c
a	c
view	c
to	i
mountains	c
,	c
wich	i
remind	i
me	c
about	i
my	c
5	c
years	i
experience	c
in	i
climbing	c
.	c

Also	c
I	c
enjoy	c
walking	c
and	c
photography	c
.	c

Do	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
bring	c
any	c
special	c
clothes	c
or	c
gize	i
?	c

And	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
should	c
I	c
take	c
?	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Elina	c

If	c
you	c
need	c
something	c
you	c
have	c
a	c
choice	c
to	i
borrow	i
it	c
from	c
friends	c
or	c
library	i
,	c
or	c
to	i
bye	i
it	c
.	c

As	c
in	i
all	i
there	c
are	c
some	c
advantages	c
and	c
disadvantages	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
would	i
ask	i
me	c
,	c
I	c
prefer	c
my	c
friends	c
to	c
do	c
all	c
shoping	i
for	c
me	c
.	c

And	c
of'course	i
not	c
all	c
shops	c
have	c
good	c
conditionering	i
.	c

Otherwise	c
,	c
you	c
either	i
will	i
not	c
find	c
what	c
you	c
are	c
looking	c
for	c
,	c
or	c
you	c
will	c
,	c
and	c
spend	c
the	c
rest	c
of	c
the	c
day	c
in	c
bad	i
mood	c
,	c
because	c
of	c
bad	i
maners	i
of	c
sales	c
people	c
,	c
that	i
not	i
every	i
time	i
you	i
ask	i
can	i
give	i
you	i
any	i
advice	i
.	c

To	c
Manager	c
.	c

My	c
name	c
is	c
Sam	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
inform	c
you	c
that	c
your	c
advertisement	c
mentions	c
so	c
many	c
different	c
things	c
,	c
so	c
it	c
spoilt	c
a	c
part	c
of	c
my	c
journey	c
.	c

After	c
reading	c
your	c
advertisement	c
.	c

I	c
went	c
to	c
your	c
theatre	c
to	c
see	c
'	c
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
'	c
last	c
night	c
.	c

But	c
everything	c
was	c
terrible	c
and	c
different	c
from	i
your	c
advertisement	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
was	c
disappointed	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
wanted	c
to	c
see	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
in	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

You	c
wrote	c
'	c
discouts	i
available	c
'	c
but	c
they	c
did	c
n't	c
discount	i
.	c

So	c
I	c
ask	c
you	c
to	c
return	c
some	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
have	c
something	c
to	c
ask	c
,	c
please	c
call	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
will	c
stay	c
until	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
this	c
month	c
.	c

(	c
Hotel	c
number	c
)	c
.	c

I	c
wait	c
to	c
hear	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
much	i
housework	c
to	c
be	i
done	i
from	c
early	c
morning	c
until	c
late	c
evening	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
if	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
washing	i
machine	c
,	c
I	c
will	i
have	c
to	c
wash	c
all	c
clothes	i
myself	c
.	c

During	i
the	c
washing	c
machine	c
is	c
whirring	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
get	i
my	c
time	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
can	c
read	c
my	c
book	c
or	c
do	c
another	c
thing	c
.	c

Also	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
imagine	c
my	c
life	c
without	c
car	i
.	c

Now	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
live	c
without	c
them	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
because	c
I	c
receive	i
your	c
letter	c
concerning	c
the	c
prize	c
of	c
two	c
weeks	c
in	c
California	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
the	i
first	c
two	c
weeks	c
of	c
July	c
because	c
in	c
June	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
working	c
and	c
at	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
July	c
I	c
am	c
planing	i
to	c
go	c
to	c
Paris	c
to	c
attend	c
a	c
course	i
of	i
French	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
be	c
accomodated	i
in	c
tents	i
because	c
I	c
love	c
camping	c
but	c
I	i
do	i
n't	i
mind	i
also	i
the	c
second	c
possibility	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
also	c
to	c
have	c
more	c
information	c
about	c
the	c
cost	c
and	c
which	i
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
you	c
suggest	c
to	i
bring	i
with	c
me	c
.	c

Your	i
faithfully	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
important	c
to	i
concentrate	i
this	i
video	i
in	i
few	i
but	i
interesting	c
part	i
of	c
our	c
daily	c
life	c
at	c
school	c

Interesting	i
will	i
be	i
to	c
show	c
how	c
the	c
lessons	c
are	c
organize	i
,	c
saing	i
that	c
we	c
are	c
never	c
doing	c
just	c
one	c
activitie	i
during	c
the	c
class	c
.	c

We	c
should	c
speak	c
about	c
our	c
library	c
that	i
it	c
is	c
well	c
furnished	c
of	i
several	i
books	c
,	c
tape	i
and	c
video	i
.	c

After	c
that	c
we	c
have	c
to	c
make	c
sure	c
that	c
we	c
explain	c
how	i
is	i
it	i
the	c
relationship	c
betwen	i
teachers	c
and	c
students	c
,	c
showing	c
the	c
several	i
time	i
that	c
we	c
have	c
been	c
out	c
together	c
.	c

Finaly	i
we	c
should	c
give	c
some	c
information	c
also	c
about	c
our	c
courses	i
concerning	i
tourism	i
,	i
buisness	i
and	i
computer	i
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs.	c
Ryan	c
,	c

thank	i
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
great	c
that	c
I	c
could	c
win	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
,	c
which	c
means	c
that	c
I	c
will	c
have	c
the	c
possibility	i
to	c
spend	c
two	c
weeks	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
in	c
the	c
U.S.A.	c
I	c
am	c
sure	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
an	c
exciting	c
experience	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

As	c
request	i
following	i
you	c
will	c
find	c
the	c
information	c
you	c
need	c
.	i

First	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
my	c
company	c
is	c
going	c
to	c
close	c
for	c
holiday	i
at	c
that	c
period	i
and	c
it	c
would	c
suits	i
me	c
very	c
well	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
an	i
accomodation	i
in	c
tent	i
because	c
I	c
enjyoi	i
being	c
outside	c
close	c
to	c
the	i
nature	c
.	c

Thirdly	c
,	c
what	i
the	i
activities	i
concern	i
,	i
which	c
I	c
can	c
choose	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
little	c
bit	c
difficult	c
to	c
decide	c
because	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
try	c
all	c
of	c
them	c
!	c

As	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
tennis	c
and	c
swimming	c
I	c
will	c
choose	c
these	c
.	c

Please	c
let	c
me	c
know	c
which	i
clothes	c
do	i
I	c
need	c
then	i
and	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
in	c
cash	c
and	c
as	i
travellers	c
cheque	i
shall	i
I	c
take	c
with	c
me	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Sometimes	c
the	c
bad	c
charachters	i
in	c
a	c
story	c
are	c
more	c
interesting	c
than	c
the	c
good	c
ones	c
.	c

I	c
completely	c
agree	c
with	c
this	c
statement	c
.	c

Recently	c
I	c
have	c
red	i
a	c
short	c
story	c
written	c
by	c
Agatha	c
Christie	c
.	c

His	i
title	c
was	c
:	c
"	c
The	c
Mistery	i
of	c
Hunter	c
's	c
Lodge	c
"	c
.	c

The	c
charachter	i
which	i
I	c
liked	c
most	c
was	c
that	c
of	c
Mrs.	c
Havering	c
,	c
the	c
mistress	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
very	c
exciting	c
because	c
she	c
could	c
play	c
at	i
the	i
same	i
time	i
two	i
people	i
:	c
herself	c
and	c
the	c
houskeeper	i
.	c

Although	c
from	c
my	c
point	c
of	c
view	c
she	c
planned	c
the	c
murder	c
of	c
his	c
uncle	c
and	c
was	c
able	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
.	i

She	c
was	c
the	c
head	i
in	c
this	c
story	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
Mrs.	c
Havering	c
was	c
a	i
extremely	c
intelligent	c
person	c
in	c
addition	c
to	c
being	c
a	c
very	c
good	c
actress	c
and	c
this	c
made	c
this	c
story	c
full	c
of	c
suspense	c
.	c

Moreover	c
she	c
must	c
have	c
had	c
an	i
"	i
ice	i
blood	i
"	i
and	c
strong	c
nerves	c
to	c
handle	c
in	i
that	c
way	c
.	c

As	c
far	c
as	c
I	c
am	c
concerned	c
I	c
would	c
appreciate	c
to	i
have	i
myself	i
some	i
of	i
her	i
characteristics	i
,	c
like	i
take	i
a	i
decision	i
and	i
handle	i
.	c

Mr.	c
Manager	c
,	c

First	i
off	i
all	i
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
it	c
has	i
started	i
later	c
than	c
it	c
should	c
to	i
,	i
I	c
had	c
to	c
wait	c
for	c
about	c
fourty-five	i
minutes	c
.	c

Then	c
I	c
realized	c
that	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
did	c
not	c
appear	c
in	c
the	c
show	c
which	i
was	c
very	c
disappoiting	i
for	c
me	c
because	c
I	c
like	c
this	c
actor	c
very	c
much	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
I	c
was	c
not	c
the	c
only	c
one	c
who	c
was	c
upset	c
.	c

Why	c
did	c
you	c
write	c
that	c
they	c
were	c
available	c
?	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
the	c
most	c
disappointing	c
think	i
was	c
that	c
theatre	i
's	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
to	i
add	i
that	c
I	c
was	c
hungry	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
not	c
such	c
a	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerlly	i
,	c

Every	c
day	c
when	c
I	c
get	c
up	c
I	c
am	i
checking	i
if	c
there	c
are	c
any	c
messages	c
left	c
for	c
me	c
like	c
e-mail	c
or	c
SMS	c
in	i
my	c
mobile	c
phone	c
.	c

Modern	c
technology	c
has	c
got	i
a	c
big	c
influence	c
on	c
our	c
life	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
easier	c
.	c

We	c
can	c
communicate	c
with	c
people	c
by	c
using	c
mobile	c
phones	c
or	c
telephones	c
which	i
are	c
the	c
best	c
things	c
ever	c
made	c
.	c

We	c
can	c
see	c
PEOPLE	c
'S	c
LIFE	c
in	c
other	c
countries	c
which	i
is	c
very	c
interesting	c
for	c
me	c
and	c
my	c
friends	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
travel	c
on	i
July	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
manager	c
so	c
I	c
can	i
not	i
travel	c
another	c
time	c
.	c

Now	c
I	c
am	c
going	c
to	c
answer	c
a	c
few	c
questions	c
:	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
better	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
terrible	c
backaches	c
so	c
I	c
can	i
not	i
sleep	c
on	c
the	c
floor	c
.	c

In	i
the	i
other	i
hand	i
,	c
I	c
can	i
not	i
sing	c
very	c
well	c
but	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
do	c
this	c
there	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
which	i
type	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
will	i
wear	c
there	c
,	i
would	i
you	c
check	c
the	c
weather	c
forecast	c
for	c
me	c
,	c
please	c
?	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

My	c
mom	c
said	c
:	c

I	c
started	c
to	c
look	c
for	c
my	c
wallet	c
and	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
find	c
it	c
,	c
lighter	i
.	c

Now	c
I	c
was	c
without	c
my	c
money	c
and	c
my	c
wallet	c
.	c

I	c
went	c
to	c
see	c
who	c
was	c
there	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
and	i
old	c
woman	c
asking	c
who	c
was	i
Maria	i

That	c
's	c
when	c
she	c
showed	c
me	c
my	c

found	c
it	c
on	c
the	c

You	c
may	c
be	c
surprised	c
to	c
receive	c
a	c
letter	c
from	c
us	c
.	c

All	c
the	c
students	c
are	c
happy	c
that	c
we	c
will	c
have	c
othe	i
oppurtinatey	i
,	i
to	c
visit	c
London	c
for	c
three	c
days	c

We	c
all	c
agree	i
to	i
the	c
daily	c
programme	c
during	i
the	c
three	c
days	c

In	c
the	c

we	c
will	c
have	c
the	c
change	i
,	i
to	c
see	c
some	c
of	c
the	c
sightseeings	i
of	c

by	c
bus	c
,	c
For	i
example	c
the	i
Science	c
Museum	c
or	c
the	c
National	c
Art	c
Gallery	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
afternoon	c
,	c
the	c
River	i
trip	c
to	c
Greenwich	c
would	i
also	c
be	c
a	c
fantastic	c
experience	c
for	c
us	c
.	c

The	c
reason	c
I	c
write	c
to	c
you	c
,	i
is	c
that	c
we	c
have	c
seen	c
an	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
,	c
for	i
a	i
fiew	i
days	i

The	c
show	c
includes	c
the	c
latest	c
fashions	c
in	c
the	i
sports	c

and	c
the	c
most	c
fashionable	c
make	i
up	i
and	c

The	c
show	c
is	c

and	c
we	c
can	c
see	c
the	c

instat	i
of	c
having	c
free	c
time	c
Wednesday	i
in	c
the	c
afternoon	c
.	c

We	c
all	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
help	c

The	c
student	c

They	c
want	c
to	c
get	c
from	c
them	c
all	c
the	c
details	c
of	c
their	c
life	c
,	c
especially	c
from	i
their	c
private	c
.	i

It	c
is	c
sometimes	c
a	c
real	c
fight	c
who	c
will	c
take	c
the	c
first	c
picture	c
of	c
a	c
film	c
star	c
or	c
a	c
politician	c
.	c

Famous	c
people	c
diserve	i
also	i
to	c
have	c
a	c
private	c
life	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
nobody	c
have	i
forgotten	c
,	i
where	c
curiosity	i
from	i
the	c
journalists	c
end	i
.	c

For	c
example	c
the	i
hunting	c
about	i
Princess	c
Diana	c
and	c
his	i
friend	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
a	c
musical	c
show	c
called	c
'	c
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	i
,	i
that	c
took	i
place	i
in	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
.	c

The	c
second	c
problem	c
was	c
the	c
time	c
of	c
the	c
play	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
waiting	c
for	c
the	c
show	c
for	c
a	i
half-an-hour	i
!	c

The	c
advertisment	i
said	c
that	c
they	c
would	c
be	c
available	c
but	c
they	c
were	c
not	c
.	c

The	c
last	c
problem	c
was	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
written	c
in	c
the	c
advertisment	i
that	c
I	c
could	c
visit	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
but	c
unfortunatelly	i
it	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

To	c
conclude	c
,	c
I	c
am	i
not	c
satisfied	c
with	c
the	c
show	c
I	c
watched	c
in	c
your	c
theatre	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
a	c
fully	i
refund	c

During	c
this	c
time	c
men	c
had	i

and	c
now	c
are	c
the	c
leading	c
creatures	c

They	c
built	c
huge	c

Now	c
,	c
modern	c
technology	c
has	c
changed	c
our	c
life	c
.	c

And	c
,	c
naturally	c
,	c
it	c
has	c
both	c
advantages	c
and	c
disadvantages	c

We	i

We	c

that	c

our	c
moving	i
faster	c

it	c
fastens	i
our	c
life	c

Factories	c
polluted	i
the	c

we	c
breath	c

appeared	i

For	c
example	c
:	i
cancer	c
occured	i
in	c
Africa	c
after	c
American	c
nuclear	c
tests	c

In	c
future	c
possibly	i
the	i
technology	c
would	i
n't	i
destroy	c
the	c
environment	c
,	c
but	c
we	c
have	c
to	c
do	c
something	c
now	c
,	c
because	c
tomorrow	c
can	i
be	c
too	c
late	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c

your	i

which	c
you	c
let	c
me	c
know	c
I	c
had	i
won	c
the	c
first	c

in	c
your	c
competition	c

For	i
accommodation	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
a	c

,	c
as	c
I	c
love	c
nature	c
and	c
I	c
like	c
going	c

a	c

I	c
know	c
very	c
little	c
about	c

it	c
is	c
almost	c
something	c

for	c

I	c

I	c

a	c
terrible	c
cold	c
but	c
I	c
feel	c
OK	c
anyway	c
.	c

I	c
got	c
it	c
two	c
weeks	c
ago	c
in	i
a	c
concert	c
,	c
but	c
although	c
I	c
've	c

to	c
the	c
doctor	c
,	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
get	c
over	c
it	c
yet	i

It	c
was	c
wonderful	c

You	c
know	c
I	c
love	c
designing	c
clothes	c

and	c
there	c
I	c
had	c
the	c
chance	c
to	c
make	c
a	c
dream	c
come	c
true	c
.	c

A	c
friend	c
of	c
mine	c
was	c
organising	c
a	i
pop	c
concert	c
,	c
and	c
as	c
he	c
knew	c
me	c
well	c
,	c
he	c
asked	c
me	c
if	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
design	c
the	c
clothes	c
the	c
pop	c
singers	c
would	c
wear	c
in	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

Of	c
course	c
,	c
I	c
accepted	c
immediately	c
very	i
pleased	c

It	c
's	c
something	c
I	c
will	c
never	c

And	c
tell	c
me	c

are	c
you	c
planning	c
coming	i
back	c
to	c

Well	c

If	c
I	c

I	c
would	c

to	c
live	i
in	c

It	c

one	c
of	c
the	c
most	c

about	c
all	c
my	c

something	c
different	c

I	c
've	c

Hallo	c
,	c
Kim	c
!	c

Thanks	c
for	c
your	c
last	c
letter	c
.	c

I	c
must	c
tell	c
you	c
that	c
helping	c
at	c
pop	c
concerts	c
is	c
very	c
exciting	c
,	c
but	c
very	c
tiring	c
too	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
rest	c
.	c

Well	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
the	c
best	c
time	c
of	c
my	c
life	c
!	c

I	c
worked	c
all	c
days	i
,	c
but	c
I	c
did	c
it	c
with	c
pleasure	c
.	c

We	i
lived	i
here	i
in	i
rush	i
,	i
but	c
there	c
was	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
fun	c
,	c
too	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
surprised	c
,	c
when	c
I	c
saw	c
that	c
singers	c
are	c
n't	c
so	c
sophisticated	c
and	c
self-confident	c
as	c
they	c
are	c
written	i
in	c
the	c
newspapers	c
.	c

When	c
she	c
tried	c
to	c
answear	i
me	c
,	c
one	c
small	c
child	c
made	i
her	c
a	i
picture	c
with	c
flesh	i
.	c

She	c
said	c
he	c
should	c
do	c
it	c
again	c
,	c
because	c
she	c
had	c
stupid	c
features	c
!	c

Trully	i
,	c
my	c
work	c
here	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
important	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
relly	i
enjoyed	c
it	c
.	c

Sometimes	i
somebody	i
should	i
on	i
me	i
,	i
but	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
say	c
they	c
are	c
often	c
right	c
.	c

The	c
hardest	c
was	c
,	c
when	c
I	c
brought	c
a	c
pepperoni	c
pizza	c
for	c
kubulska	c
,	c
but	c
she	c
does	c
n't	c
eat	c
meat	c
!	c

But	c
,	c
for	i
luck	i
,	c
it	i
was	i
n't	i
achieved	i
with	i
succes	i
of	i
our	i
concert	i
.	c

You	c
have	c
to	c
admit	c
,	c
that	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
magnificent	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
had	c
a	i
great	c
fun	c
when	c
you	c
was	i
watching	c
us	c
at	i
the	c
TV	c
set	c
,	c
did	i
n't	i
you	c
?	c

I	c
'll	c
write	c
you	i
again	c
tomorrow	c
,	c
because	c
now	c
my	c
Mom	c
is	c
angry	c
,	c
the	c
I'am	i
not	c
sleeping	c
yet	c
.	c

I	c
ca	i
n't	i
hardly	c
wait	c
.	c

Give	c
my	c
best	c
to	c
your	c
parents	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
,	c

However	c
,	c
the	c
students	c
in	c
my	c

have	c
seen	c
an	c
advertisement	c
for	c
"	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
"	c
and	c
they	c
would	c
all	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
suggesting	c
how	c
programme	i
could	c
be	c
changed	c
.	c

The	c
fashion	c
starts	i
at	c
10:00	c
am	c
and	c
ends	c
at	c
19:00	c
p.m.	c
and	c
will	c
be	c
realized	i
on	c
14	c
March	c
,	c
so	c
we	c
can	c
change	c
the	c
shopping	c
with	c
this	c
event	c
that	i
is	c
realized	i
in	c
the	c
afternoon	c
,	c
and	c
put	i
the	c
shopping	c
at	c
night	c
.	c

There	i
will	c
be	c

RYAN	c

I	c
WOULD	c
PROBABLY	c
ENJOY	c
MOST	i
TRAVELLING	c
IN	c

BECAUSE	c
I	c

THE	c

THAT	c
THIS	c

Dear	c

;	i

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
and	c
for	c
this	c
competition	c
.	c

First	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
answer	c
your	c
questions	c
.	c

Because	i
,	i
the	c
only	c
time	c
I	c
can	c
take	c
holiday	i
is	c
July	c
.	c

And	c
the	c
reason	c
I	c
choose	c
painting	c
is	c
it	i
's	i
being	i
very	c
exciting	c
to	i
me	c
,	i
I	c
am	c
not	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
this	c
subject	i
but	c
I	c
would	i
improve	c
my	c
painting	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
whather	i
you	c
have	c
competitions	c
or	c
different	i
activities	c
?	i

Do	c
you	c
reccomend	i
me	c
to	c
take	c
only	c
summer	c
clothes	c
or	c
some	c
winter	c
clothes	c
as	c
well	c
?	c

I	c
mean	c
would	c
Â£	c
700	c
be	c
enough	c
for	c
me	c
for	c
one	c
week	c
?	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

I	c
worked	c
untill	i
midnight	c
everyday	i
.	c

Actually	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
work	c
,	c
you	c
know	c
,	i
I	c
had	i
been	c
decorating	c
a	c
concert	c
hall	c
for	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
very	c
important	c
for	c
us	c
because	c
we	c
really	c
wanted	c
people	c
to	c
enjoy	c
it	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
very	c
enjoyable	c
I	i
met	i
lots	c
of	c
friends	c
We	i
'd	i
been	i
together	c
all	c
day	c
,	c
painting	c
the	c
walls	c
,	c
cleaning	c
putting	i
some	i
baloons	i
and	c
other	c
staff	i
everywhere	c
.	c

And	c
at	c
the	c
time	c
of	c
concert	i
we	c
wore	c
a	i
big	c
funny	c
costume	i
,	c
and	c
danced	c
with	c
people	c
.	c

The	i
most	i
I	i
like	i
was	c
meeting	c
with	i
the	c
band	c
.	c

Guess	c
what	c
the	c
name	c
of	c
the	c
band	c
is	c
;	c
Back	c
Street	c
Boys	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
to	c
finish	c
or	c
I	c
'll	c
miss	c
the	c
last	c
post	c
.	c

Bye	c
for	c
now	c
,	c
write	c
to	c
me	c
soon	c

Dear	c
Mr.	c
Robertson	c
,	c

We	c
have	c
discussed	c
the	c
programme	c
in	c
our	c
class	c
and	c
the	c
students	c
are	c
very	c
happy	c
about	c
that	c
especially	i
because	c
we	c
will	c
have	c
the	c
possibility	i
to	c
visit	c
the	c
Science	c
Museum	c
and	c
the	c
National	c
Gallery	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
we	c
will	c
have	c
the	c
possibility	i
to	c
see	c
the	c
newest	c
make	i
up	i
and	c
hairstyles	c
.	c

We	c
think	c
that	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
for	c
us	c
to	c
see	c
this	c
show	c
because	c
we	c
are	c
all	c
interested	c
in	c
fashion	c
.	c

For	c
these	c
reasons	c
I	i
am	c
asking	c
you	c
if	c
we	c
can	c
go	c
there	c
on	c
Tuesday	i
's	i
afternoon	c
.	c

The	c
show	c
will	c
be	c
at	c
the	c
Central	c
Exhibition	c
Hall	c
and	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
opened	i
until	c
7.	c
pm	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
even	c
free	c
for	c
students	c
!	c
!	c

I	c
hope	c
that	c
this	c
change	c
will	c
not	c
cause	c
to	i
you	c
too	c
many	c
problems	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

I	c
agree	c
with	c
this	c
statement	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
famous	c
people	c
deserve	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
private	c
life	c
like	c
all	c
the	c
normal	c
people	c
,	c
without	c
journalists	c
following	c
them	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
the	c
journalists	c
should	c
have	c
more	c
respect	c
for	c
the	c
private	c
life	i
of	c
the	i
famous	c
people	c
.	c

They	c
should	c
understand	c
when	c
it	c
is	c
too	c
much	c
,	c
when	c
they	c
are	c
going	c
too	c
far	c
.	c

For	c
instance	c
,	c
the	c
tragic	c
death	c
of	c
Princess	c
Diana	c
is	c
an	c
example	c
of	c
what	c
a	c
journalist	c
must	c
not	c
do	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
the	i
famous	c
people	c
have	c
to	c
understand	c
that	c
the	i
people	c
are	c
interested	c
in	c
their	c
lives	c
.	c

The	i
famous	i
people	c
must	c
enderstand	i
that	c
the	c
journalists	c
are	c
doing	c
their	c
work	i
.	c

When	c
he	c
goes	c
skiing	c
in	c
Switzerland	c
he	c
always	c
stops	c
for	c
a	c
while	c
to	c
talk	c
with	c
the	c
journalists	c
and	c
to	c
give	c
the	c
photographers	c
the	c
chance	c
to	c
take	c
pictures	c
.	c

After	c
this	c
break	c
he	c
continues	c
to	c
ski	c
without	c
be	i
annoyed	c
for	c
the	c
rest	c
of	c
the	c
holiday	c
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
there	c
must	c
be	c
more	c
compehension	i
and	c
respect	c
between	c
famous	c
people	c
and	c
the	c
media	c
.	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c

I	c
am	c
really	c
pleased	c
to	c
hear	c
from	c
you	c
I	i
won	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
the	c
competition	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
the	c
thing	c
I	c
really	c
want	c
.	c

First	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
afraid	c
but	i
I	c
can	c
travel	i
only	i
in	c
July	c
.	c

I	c
've	c
got	c
three-month	i
holiday	c
from	c
June	c
to	c
August	c
but	c
I	c
've	c
already	c
promised	c
my	c
aunt	c
,	c
who	c
runs	c
a	c
small	c
nursing	c
home	c
in	c
Andover	c
,	c
to	c
help	c
her	c
during	c
June	c
and	c
in	c
August	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
to	c
work	c
to	c
get	c
my	c
next-term	c
tuition	c
fee	c
.	c

So	c
July	c
is	c
the	c
only	c
month	c
I	c
can	c
take	c
part	c
in	c
your	c
activities	c
.	c

Second	c
,	c
regarding	c
accomodation	i
,	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
.	c

And	c
I	c
love	i
to	c
learn	c
surfing	c
and	c
painting	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
quite	c
good	c
at	c
swimming	c
but	c
I	c
never	c
tried	c
to	i
do	i
surfing	c
.	c

I	c
also	c
love	c
painting	c
.	c

I	c
expect	c
you	c
have	c
lovely	c
nature	i
in	c
California	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
draw	c
on	c
my	c
canvas	c
.	c

Let	c
me	c
ask	c
a	c
question	c
about	c
clothes	c
and	c
money	c
.	c

What	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
do	c
I	c
need	c
and	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
do	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
.	i

Yours	c
faithfully	c

I	c
love	c
shopping	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
help	c
accepting	c
it	c
is	c
true	c
that	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

What	c
's	c
worse	c
,	c
there	c
is	c
usually	c
traffic	i
jam	c
around	c
or	c
along	c
roads	c
to	c
a	c
big	c
supermarket	c
and	c
a	c
shopping	c
mall	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
people	c
ca	c
n't	c
have	c
a	c
good	c
time	c
even	c
at	i
weekdays	c
while	c
shopping	c
.	c

Shopping	c
gets	c
them	c
tired	c
as	c
they	c
have	c
to	c
walk	c
for	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
to	c
find	c
the	c
things	c
they	c
want	c
to	c
get	c
.	c

For	c
the	c
handicapped	c
,	c
going	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
easy	c
and	c
it	c
can	c
be	c
very	c
bothering	i
unless	c
shops	c
have	c
facilities	c
for	c
them	c
.	c

Despite	c
all	c
these	c
things	c
which	c
show	c
that	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
,	c
people	c
have	c
to	c
go	c
shopping	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	i
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
the	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
show	c
announced	c
Mr.	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
as	c
the	c
principal	c
actor	c
.	c

Surprisingly	c
,	c
he	c
never	c
appeared	c
on	c
the	c
stage	c
,	i
during	c
the	c
play	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
one	c
hour	c
fifteen	i
past	i
after	i
.	c

We	c
arrived	c
at	c
the	c
theatre	c
in	i
time	c
and	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
wait	c
all	c
that	c
time	c
until	c
the	c
show	c
began	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
when	c
I	c
asked	c
about	c
the	c
discounts	c
,	c
an	c
agressive	i
employee	c
refused	c
to	c
answer	c
me	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
incredible	c
.	c

The	c
evening	c
was	c
a	c
horrible	c
surprise	c
,	c
completely	c
different	c
from	c
the	i
promise	i
written	i
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
.	c

Defineteley	i
,	c
I	c
want	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

"	c
Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets.	c
"	c

Well	c
,	c
it	i
was	c
the	c
beginning	c
of	c
my	c
tragedy	c
.	c

In	i
that	i
precisely	i
moment	i
I	c
realized	c
that	c
I	c
had	c
forgotten	c
to	c
tell	c
her	c
that	c
Ann	c
was	c
Mr	c
Harter	c
's	c
niece	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
Very	i
much	c

I	c
am	c

this	c

and	c
I	c
hope	c
my	c
stay	c
there	c
will	c
be	c
great	c
!	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
only	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
tests	i
at	c
school	c
and	c
they	c
are	c
Very	i
important	c
to	c
me	c
and	c
I	c
hope	c
you	c
Will	i
understand	c
my	c
problem	c
.	c

I	c
Would	i
like	c
to	c
Know	i
if	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
take	c
any	c

What	i

first	c
idea	c
about	c
shopping	c
is	c
that	c
buying	c
something	c
will	c
make	i
a	c
pleasure	c
to	i
the	c
buyer	c
and	c
for	i
that	c
reason	c
,	c
will	c
be	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

But	c
this	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
the	c
case	c
:	c
at	c
first	c
,	c
you	c
see	c
a	c
very	c
pretty	c
item	c
which	c
you	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
try	c
.	i

When	c
you	c
ask	c
to	c
,	c
the	c
seller	i
offen	i
answers	c
that	c
your	c
size	c
is	c
missing	i
.	c

His	c
answer	c
is	c
:	c
"	c
Everything	c
is	c
here	c
,	c
Madam	c
!	c
"	c

As	c
you	c
understand	c
that	c
you	c
wo	c
n't	c
get	c
any	c
help	c
,	c
you	c
waste	c
your	c
time	c
looking	c
for	c
the	c
right	c
size	c
.	c

At	i
the	i
time	i
you	c
realise	c
it	i
,	c
you	c
also	c
realise	c
that	c
the	c
shop	c
is	c
closing	c
in	c
five	c
minutes	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
you	c
run	c
to	c
the	c
bank	c
but	c
have	c
to	c
wait	c
for	i
the	c
queue	c
.	c

There	c
is	c
only	c
one	c
minute	c
left	c
!	c

You	c
run	c
back	c
to	c
the	c
shop	c
and	c
get	c
your	c
item	c
.	c

But	c
now	c
,	c
you	c
are	c
very	c
tired	c
and	c
need	c
a	c
good	c
rest	c
!	c

Dear	c
Mr.	c
Ryan	c
:	c

Another	c
point	c
mentioned	c
was	c
the	c
choice	c
of	c
activities	c
.	c

Now	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
request	c
some	c
information	c
about	c
clothes	c
and	c
money	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
receiving	c
your	c
reply	c
and	c
hope	c
the	c
information	c
above	c
will	c
helpful	i
towards	c
the	c
preparation	c
for	c
the	c
weeks	c
in	c
subject	i
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Gabriela	c
Matos	c

Right	c
size	c
,	c
right	c
colour	c

However	c
that	i
impression	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
true	c
.	c

Everyone	c
enjoys	c
wearing	c
nice	c
new	c
clothes	c
,	i
however	i
do	i
we	c
really	c
like	c
the	c
process	c
of	c
chosing	i
them	c
?	c

The	c
colour	c
along	c
with	c
the	c
style	c
and	c
size	c
,	c
blue	c
or	c
red	c
,	c
long	c
or	c
short	c
,	c
medium	c
or	c
large	c
.	c

Then	c
,	c
I	c
consider	c
a	i
pain	c
having	c
to	c
go	c
around	c
some	c
more	c
still	c
thinking	c
of	c
that	c
same	c
dress	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
you	i
always	i
talk	i
yourself	i
into	i
some	i
piece	i
of	i
clothing	i
but	i
that	i
ended	i
up	i
being	i
a	i
tiring	i
day	i
of	c
going	c
in	c
and	c
out	c
of	c
fitting	c
rooms	c
and	c
figuring	c
out	c
discounts	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
to	c
give	c
my	c
opinion	c
of	c
that	c
great	c
festival	c
you	c
organiced	i
the	i
last	c
21	c
and	c
22	c
of	c
November	c
.	c

I	c
want	c
you	c
to	c
know	c
how	i
extraordinary	i
moments	i
I	c
passed	i
with	c
my	c
friends	c
in	i
the	c
festival	c
.	c

Your	c
work	c
was	c
brilliant	c
because	c
you	c
brought	c
stars	c
and	c
artists	c
from	c
around	c
the	c
world	c
with	i
only	c
that	c
reasonable-priced	i
ticket	c
we	c
paid	i
for	c
all	i
the	i
weekend	c
.	c

The	c
festival	c
was	c
very	c
well	c
organiced	i
with	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
alternatives	c
like	c
concerts	c
and	c
dance	c
shows	c
.	c

On	i
my	i
point	i
of	i
view	i
the	c
hall	c
of	i
the	c
rock	c
concets	i
was	c
too	c
small	c
,	i
you	i
've	i
to	c
consider	c
make	i
a	c
big	i
one	c
for	c
the	i
next	c
year	c
because	c
these	c
kind	i
of	c
events	c
are	c
concurred	i
by	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
young	c
people	c
.	c

Thanks	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
going	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
what	c
I	c
feel	c
.	c

They	c
only	c
want	c
to	c
know	c
where	c
I	c
am	c
and	c
when	c
I	c
go	c
out	c
at	i
what	c
time	c
I	c
came	c
home	c
.	c

At	c
school	c
is	i
complete	i
different	c
because	c
the	c
teachers	c
do	c
n't	c
foregive	i
you	c
nothing	i
.	c

You	c
have	c
to	c
be	c
quiet	c
an	i
attention	i
in	c
class	c
if	c
you	c
would	i
n't	i
to	i
be	c
punished	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
happy	c
because	c
my	c
parents	c
allow	c
me	c
to	c
do	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
things	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
n't	c
like	c
to	c
change	c
anything	c
because	c
we	c
all	c
need	c
some	c
dicipline	i
to	c
make	i
the	c
right	c
things	c
.	c

When	c
I	i
'd	i
time	c
I	c
will	c
write	c
you	i
again	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
:	c

I	c
was	c
sure	c
that	c
discouts	i
were	c
available	c
because	c
I	c
have	i
read	c
it	i
,	i
but	c
at	c
the	c
tickets	i
office	c
they	c
did	c
n't	c
accept	i
them	c
.	c

What	c
a	c
terrible	c
evening	c
!	c

So	c
I	c
payed	i
the	i
ticket	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
n't	c
my	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
so	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
have	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
!	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
so	c
he	c
told	c
his	c
mother	c
how	c
his	c
brother	c
Jim	c
lost	c
her	c
suit	c
suitcase	c
on	c
the	c
train	c
.	c

Jim	c
's	c
mum	c
did	c
n't	c
want	c
him	c
to	c
take	c
her	c
suitcase	c
,	c
but	c
he	c
did	c
it	i
.	c

So	c
a	i
morning	c
he	c
reached	c
Victoria	c
Station	c
with	c
the	c
suitcase	c
and	c
take	i
the	c
train	c
for	c
the	c
countryside	c
where	c
he	c
had	c
to	c
work	c
.	c

But	c
when	c
he	c
walked	c
out	c
the	i
station	c
he	c
realised	c
that	c
he	c
have	i
lost	i
the	c
suitcase	c
on	c
the	c
train	c
.	c

He	c
was	c
worried	c
about	c
his	c
mother	c
's	c
reaction	c
,	c
but	c
when	c
he	c
arrived	c
he	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
Station	c
Manager	c
's	c
office	c
and	c
he	c
found	c
it	c
on	c
the	c
table	c
.	c

He	c
was	c
so	c
happy	c
!	c

All	c
this	c
story	c
was	c
a	c
secret	c
but	c
Pat	c
realived	i
to	i
his	c
mother	c
.	c

She	c
was	c
so	c
angry	c
and	c
confused	c
because	c
Jim	c
have	i
n't	i
told	c
her	c
the	c
truth	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
,	c

In	c
your	c
advertisement	c
said	i
the	c
show	c
will	i
start	c
at	c
19:30	c
however	i
it	c
began	c
at	c
20:15	c
.	c

Even	c
though	i
,	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
understand	c
the	i
actor	i
of	c
this	c
play	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
does	i
n't	i
appeared	i
in	c
the	c
play	c
and	c
there	c
was	c
another	c
actor	c
instead	c
of	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
.	c

After	c
all	c
this	c
I	i
wanted	c
to	c
make	c
my	c
evening	c
pleasant	c
however	i
for	i
my	c
surprise	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c

because	c
some	i
problems	i
of	i
sanitary	i

I	c

How	c
has	c
modern	c
technology	c
changed	c
your	c
daily	c
life	c
?	c

Many	c
years	c
ago	c
human	c
beings	c
or	c
whatever	c
we	c
called	i
was	i
another	c
animal	c
species	c
but	c
when	c
they	i
tried	c
to	c
use	c
rocks	c
to	c
make	c
a	c
fire	c
we	c
changed	c
everything	c
.	c

Modern	c
technology	c
changed	c
our	c
lifes	i
in	c
many	c
ways	c
,	i
when	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
wake	c
up	c
earlier	c
I	c
use	c
my	c
alarm	c
clock	c
,	c
if	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
wash	c
my	c
teeth	c
I	c
use	c
my	c
toothbrush	c
with	c
a	c
little	c
of	i
toothpaste	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
have	c
a	c
headache	c
I	c
ate	i
pills	c
,	c
made	c
by	c
technology	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
everything	c
round	i
us	c
is	c
thanks	c
for	i
technology	c
but	c
we	c
ca	c
n't	c
forget	c
that	c
this	i
things	c
was	i
made	c
by	c
us	c
.	c

If	c
we	c
creates	i
guns	c
to	c
protect	c
our	c
homes	c
,	c
others	c
will	c
use	c
it	i
to	c
steal	i
our	c
homes	c
,	c
take	i
advantage	c
from	i
the	c
indefense	i
people	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
the	c
technology	c
never	c
stops	c
,	c
we	c
always	c
search	c
new	i
things	c
because	c
we	c
are	c
made	c
to	c
compete	c
,	c
discover	c
,	c
think	c
things	i
which	c
we	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
.	c

Dear	c
Ms	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
first	c
prize	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
.	c

Because	c
it	c
is	c
the	c
only	c
free	i
time	i
I	i
will	i
have	i
.	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
happy	c
to	c
hear	c
that	c
all	c
accommodation	c
and	c
travel	c
costs	c
are	c
paid	c
for	c
.	c

And	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
tent	i
to	c
log	i
cabin	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
chance	i
to	c
do	c
two	c
activities	c
.	c

I	c
play	i
tennis	c
since	c
I	c
was	c
ten	c
years	c
of	c
age	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
tennis	c
is	c
the	c
best	c
sport	c
I	c
have	c
ever	c
plaed	i
.	c

Another	c
activity	c
what	i
I	c
have	c
chosen	c
is	c
photography	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
just	c
finished	c
profesional	i
photographer	i
course	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
continiew	i
my	c
education	c
in	c
this	c
activity	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
some	c
questions	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	i
have	c
to	c
take	c
with	c
me	c
?	c

Also	c
,	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	i
have	c
to	c
take	c
?	c

I	c
liked	c
it	c
very	c
much	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
very	c
interesting	c
and	c
enjoing	i
.	c

While	i
this	c
concert	c
I	c
saw	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
popular	c
singers	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
:	c
Maraya	c
Kary	c
,	c
Tom	c
Jone	c
;	c
Madonna	c
.	c

I	c
saw	c
the	c
"	c
Boys	c
on	c
"	c
.	c

Afterwards	c
"	c
Boys	c
on	c
"	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
shoked	i
because	c
I	c
had	c
alredy	i
spoken	c
with	c
them	c
and	c
I	c
had	c
taken	i
two	c
autographs	c
.	c

Look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
.	c

I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
,	c
three	c
weeks	c
ago	c
,	c
to	c
see	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
,	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
that	c
was	c
played	i
at	c
this	i
moment	i
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
the	c
actors	c
mentionned	i
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
were	c
not	c
those	c
who	c
played	i
the	i
show	c
.	c

Not	c
that	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
disappointed	c
not	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
good	c
actors	c
!	c

The	i
,	c
if	c
the	c
show	c
had	c
started	c
on	c
time	c
,	c
it	c
could	c
have	c
been	c
much	c
better	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
started	c
forty	i
five	i
minutes	c
late	c
,	c
it	i
is	c
too	c
much	c
for	c
me	c
!	c

Plus	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
mentionned	i
,	i
on	i
your	c
advertisement	c
,	i
that	c
discounts	c
were	i
available	c
,	i
in	i
fact	c
,	c
no	c
discount	c
were	i
done	i
to	c
me	c
,	c
whereas	i
I	c
am	c
a	c
student	c
and	c
as	c
a	c
student	c
I	c
was	c
allowed	i
to	c
have	i
a	c
discount	c
but	c
I	c
paid	c
Â£	c
20	c
because	c
the	c
cashier	c
had	c
never	c
heard	c
about	c
any	c
discount	i
for	c
this	c
show	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
this	c
evening	c
was	c
very	c
far	c
to	i
be	i
perfect	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
ask	c
you	c
for	c
my	c
money	c
,	c
I	i
spent	c
for	i
this	c
horrible	c
evening	c
in	c
your	c
theatre	c
,	c
back	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
will	c
understand	c
my	c
disappointment	c
and	c
the	c
reasons	c
why	c
I	c
ask	c
for	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

Your	i
Faithfully	c

Our	c
everyday	c
activities	c
or	c
family	c
activities	c
are	c
simplified	c
too	c
,	i
washing	i
the	c
dishes	c
or	c
clothes	c
by	c
hand	c
is	c
rarely	c
done	c
,	c
some	c
specific	i
machines	c
are	c
made	c
to	c
do	c
this	c
stuff	c
,	c
it	c
helps	c
us	c
to	c
spend	c
much	c
more	c
time	c
in	c
extra	c
activities	c
like	c
sport	c
,	c
relaxing	c
...	c

New	c
technologies	c
allow	c
us	c
to	c
work	c
more	c
efficiently	c
,	i
with	c
computers	c
,	i
complex	c
operations	c
can	c
be	c
achieved	c
in	c
a	c
close	i
time	c
and	c
with	c
the	c
insurance	i
that	c
the	c
result	c
is	c
correct	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
new	c
technologies	c
help	c
us	c
to	c
save	c
our	c
free	c
time	c
and	c
to	c
work	c
more	c
quickly	c
and	c
more	c

Dear	c
Miss	c
Clark	c

Secondly	c
I	i
would	c
like	c
to	c
make	c
some	c
remarks	c
about	c
your	c
festival	c
so	c
that	c
you	c
can	c
improve	c
it	c
.	c

As	c
it	c
was	i
written	i
in	i
your	c
advertisement	c
,	c
artists	c
should	c
have	c
come	c
from	c
around	c
the	c
world	c
but	c
only	c
six	c
countries	c
were	c
represented	c
,	i
I	c
was	c
quite	c
disappointed	c
.	c

Plays	i
and	c
Films	i
were	c
good	c
and	c
I	c
liked	c
them	c
,	c
but	c
there	c
were	c
only	c
a	c
few	c
,	c
I	c
hope	c
there	c
will	c
be	c
many	c
more	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

As	c
a	c
student	c
,	c
the	c
low	c
priced	c
ticket	c
certainly	c
athacted	i
me	c
a	c
lot	c
and	c
gave	c
me	c
the	c
opportunity	c
to	c
see	c
and	c
hear	c
wonderful	c
artists	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
make	c
one	c
big	i
suggestion	c
:	c
you	c
should	c
find	c
a	c
place	c
for	c
a	c
camping	i
so	c
that	c
people	c
who	c
come	c
from	i
a	c
long	c
way	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
to	c
spend	c
money	c
on	c
accomodation	i
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

Money	c

Money	c

Young	c
people	c
always	c
need	c
money	c
,	c
specially	i
students	c
who	c
do	c
n't	c
earn	c
their	c
life	i
.	c

One	c
of	c
the	c
best	c
is	c
working	c
in	c
a	c
big	c
supermarket	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
departement	i
stores	c
are	c
always	c
looking	c
for	c
students	c
who	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
work	c
.	c

Another	c
solution	c
could	c
be	c
working	c
as	c
a	c
barman	c
,	c
the	c
problem	c
is	c
that	c
you	c
go	c
to	c
bed	c
very	c
late	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
's	c
very	c
exciting	c
because	c
you	c
meet	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
people	c
and	c
enjoy	c
your	c
night	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
are	c
a	c
really	c
good	c
student	c
in	c
one	c
subject	c
,	c
you	c
can	c
provide	c
private	c
lessons	c
which	i
is	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
most	c
prolific	i
job	i
but	i
do	c
it	c
only	c
if	c
you	c
like	c
teaching	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
,	c

In	c
addition	c
it	c
is	c
properly	i
to	c
mention	c
you	i
that	c
all	c
the	c
students	c
of	i
my	c
class	c
are	c
interested	c
in	c
going	c
to	c
The	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
show	i
,	c
which	c
is	c
taking	c
place	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
14th	c
in	c
the	c
Central	c
Exhibition	c
Hall	c
.	c

The	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
show	i
is	c
an	c
amaizing	i
show	c
because	c
there	c
are	c
parades	i
with	c
the	c
latest	c
fashions	c
,	i
we	i
could	c
know	i
some	c
famous	c
top	c
models	c
Besides	i
there	c
are	i
a	c
variety	c
of	c
clothes	c
either	i
sport	i
wear	i
as	i
elegant	i
desings	i
.	c

We	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
have	c
reply	i
to	i
became	i
making	c
the	c
arrangements	c
.	c

Many	c
thanks	c
again	c
.	c

We	c
arrived	c
to	i
the	c
place	i
in	c
the	c
morning	c
and	c
started	c
to	c
walk	c
.	c

The	c
landscapes	i
were	i
the	c
most	c
beautiful	c
that	c
I	c
had	c
ever	c
seen	c
before	i
.	c

I	c
realised	c
that	c
my	c
bag	c
was	c
outside	c
and	c
I	c
went	c
out	c
to	c
look	c
for	c
it	c
,	c
when	c
a	c
rain	i
of	c
stones	c
covered	c
the	c
entrace	i
of	c
the	c
hole	c
.	c

Thanks	i
to	i
God	i
everything	i
finished	c
in	c
a	c
good	c
way	c
.	c

I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
explain	c
you	i
the	c
problems	c
I	c
have	i
had	i
when	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
.	c

The	c
main	c
problem	c
I	c
had	c
was	c
the	i
actor	c
,	c
because	c
he	c
was	c
n't	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
.	c

Although	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
was	c
there	c
,	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
to	c
see	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
.	c

Another	c
problem	c
I	c
had	c
was	c
the	i
time	c
.	i

I	c
was	c
queuing	c
for	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
and	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
see	c
it	c
.	i

And	c
I	c
went	c
with	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
friends	c
and	c
we	c
did	c
n't	c
have	i
any	c
discount	c
.	c

Another	c
question	i
is	c
that	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
you	c
advised	i
we	c
could	c
visit	c
your	c
restaurant	c
but	c
as	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
we	c
could	c
n't	c
do	i
it	i
.	c

And	c
we	c
were	c
very	c
hungry	c
after	c
being	c
three	c
hours	c
in	c
the	c
theatre	c
.	c

I	c
met	c
Pat	c
when	c
we	c
were	c
children	c
.	c

We	c
went	c
at	i
the	c
same	c
school	c
and	c
at	i
the	c
same	c
class	c
.	c

I	c
liked	c
a	c
boy	c
who	c
was	c
in	c
the	c
same	c
class	c
.	c

When	c
we	c
finished	c
our	i
primary	c
school	c
we	c
went	c
at	i
the	c
same	c
secundary	i
school	c
too	c
,	c
but	c
we	c
were	c
in	c
different	c
classes	c
.	c

And	c
when	c
we	c
finished	c
the	i
secundary	i
school	c
,	c
I	c
decided	c
go	c
to	c
a	c
foreign	c
University	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
finished	c
I	c
return	i
to	c
my	c
city	c
to	c
find	c
a	c
job	c
.	c

A	c
week	c
after	c
that	c
I	c
found	c
him	c
in	c
a	c
coffee	i
and	c
he	c
asked	c
me	c
if	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
be	c
his	c
girlfriend	c
and	c
I	c
accepted	c
.	c

Now	c
,	c
five	c
years	c
later	c
we	c
are	c
going	c
to	c
get	c
married	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
the	c
actors	c
were	c
supposed	c
to	c
be	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
did	c
not	c
appear	c
in	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
another	c
actor	c
.	c

It	c
started	c
at	c
20.15	c
,	c
not	c
at	c
19.30	c
as	c
it	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
be	i
.	c

And	c
,	c
although	c
you	c
have	i
promised	c
in	i
your	c
advertisement	c
,	c
there	c
were	c
no	c
discounts	c
available	c
.	c

The	c
manager	c
said	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
they	c
had	c
not	c
been	c
informed	c
that	c
there	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
show	c
in	i
that	c
date	c
.	c

And	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
appreciate	c
if	i
you	c
give	i
me	c
a	c
refund	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
the	c
clothes	c
will	c
be	c
more	c
colourful	c
,	c
funny	i
and	c
confortable	i
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
we	c
will	c
not	c
use	i
formal	c
clothes	c
anymore	c
.	c

We	c
will	c
not	c
use	i
black	c
clothes	c
as	c
we	c
are	i
used	c
to	c
do	i
.	c

People	c
will	c
use	i
yellow	c
,	c
pink	c
and	c
green	c
clothes	c
.	c

This	c
way	c
,	c
people	c
tend	c
to	c
be	c
happier	c
.	c

It	i
will	c
be	c
more	c
beautiful	c
and	c
clean	c
.	c

They	c
will	c
wear	c
a	i
clothe	i
only	c
if	c
they	c
feel	c
good	c
wearing	c
it	c
.	c

Now	c
all	c
the	c
town	c
knew	i
my	c
secret	c
.	c

This	c
is	c
a	c
very	c
embarrassed	i
situation	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
to	c
leave	c
this	c
town	c
.	c

This	c
story	c
started	c
when	c
I	c
arrived	c
to	i
this	c
town	c
with	c
family	i
.	c

We	c
come	i
here	c
to	c
build	c
our	c
own	c
house	c
because	c
my	c
father	c
had	c
been	c
fired	c
and	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
sell	c
our	c
house	c
in	c
Buenos	c
Aires	c
.	c

My	c
mother	c
suggested	c
to	i
come	i
here	c
because	c
one	c
of	c
her	c
brothers	c
was	c
established	c
here	c
and	c
he	c
could	c
help	c
us	c
.	c

My	c
uncle	c
,	c
called	c
Paul	c
,	c
offered	i
us	c
to	c
stay	c
with	c
his	c
family	c
up	i
to	i
we	c
could	i
build	i
our	c
house	c
.	c

Cassually	i
my	c
cousin	c
had	i
the	c
same	c
age	c
as	c
me	c
,	c
sixteen	c
,	c
that	c
's	c
the	c
reason	c
for	i
we	c
started	c
a	i
friendly	c
relationship	c
.	c

We	c
spend	i
all	c
the	i
time	c
together	c
.	c

This	c
"	c
friendly	c
"	c
relationship	c
was	c
starting	c
to	c
make	i
hot	c
.	c

I	c
never	i
had	c
a	c
boyfriend	c
and	c
I	c
felt	i
in	c
love	c
with	c
him	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
wonderful	c
.	c

I	c
felt	c
that	c
I	c
had	c
discovered	c
other	i
ways	i
.	c

In	c
fact	c
,	c
I	c
did	i
.	c

We	c
made	c
love	c
...	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
express	c
my	c
pleasure	c
about	c
the	c
successful	i
programme	c
that	c
you	c
have	c
prepared	c
for	c
our	c
school	c
,	c
especially	c
the	c
excellent	c
idea	c
to	c
visit	c
the	c
National	c
Art	c
Gallery	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
inform	c
you	c
about	c
an	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
,	c
which	c
my	c
classmates	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
seen	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
we	c
have	c
been	c
informed	c
that	c
students	c
are	c
allowed	c
to	c
see	i
this	c
exhibition	c
without	i
paying	i
money	i
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
your	c
answer	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
dangerous	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
knew	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
.	c

Three	c
months	c
ago	c
,	c
I	c
cannot	c
forget	c
this	c
day	c
,	c
my	c
parents	c
visited	c
my	c
aunt	c
at	i
hospital	c
as	c
she	c
was	c
ill	c
.	c

I	c
decided	c
to	c
stay	c
at	c
home	c
and	c
listen	c
to	c
music	c
.	c

While	c
I	c
was	c
listening	c
to	c
my	c
favourite	c
cassette	c
,	c
I	c
heard	c
a	c
strange	c
noise	c
.	c

Immediately	c
I	c
opened	c
my	c
door	c
and	c
...	c

A	c
short	c
man	c
stood	i
in	c
front	c
of	c
me	c
!	c

I	c
realised	c
that	c
he	c
was	c
very	c
strong	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
was	c
faster	c
and	c
more	c
intelligent	c
than	c
him	c
.	c

I	c
ran	c
quickly	c
and	c
I	c
managed	c
to	c
escape	c
from	c
him	c
,	c
I	c
found	c
one	i
hidden	c
wooden	c
spoon	c
and	c
while	c
he	c
was	c
passing	c
in	c
front	c
of	c
me	c
I	c
hit	c
him	c
.	c

To	c
my	c
relief	c
I	c
managed	c
to	c
survive	c
!	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

However	c
,	c
when	c
I	c
saw	c
it	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
really	c
disapointed	i
and	c
I	c
ask	i
you	c
some	i
money	c
back	c
.	c

The	c
reasons	c
why	c
I	c
was	c
disappointed	c
were	i
:	i

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
was	c
not	c
there	c
,	i
I	c
was	c
very	c
upset	c
because	c
he	c
is	c
my	c
favorite	i
singer	c
and	c
it	i
was	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
reasons	c
why	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
see	c
this	c
show	c
.	c

Then	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
t	i
20.15	i
pm	i
instead	c
of	c
19.30	c
.	c

On	i
the	i
developpement	i
,	c
they	c
also	c
said	c
that	c
they	i
will	i
be	c
a	c
discount	c
for	c
students	c
who	c
are	c
between	c
eighteen	c
and	c
twenty-five	c
years	c
old	c
but	c
it	i
was	c
totally	c
wrong	c
because	c
I	c
paid	c
the	c
full	c
price	c
which	i
was	c
Â£	c
20	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
buy	c
something	c
to	c
drink	c
,	c
the	i
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
on	i
a	c
bank	c
holiday	c
!	c

As	i
a	i
conclusion	i
,	c
it	c
was	c
the	c
worse	i
evening	c
I	c
have	c
ever	c
had	c
in	c
my	c
life	c
so	c
I	c
ask	i
you	c
for	c
money	i
back	c
.	c

Your	i
faithfully	c
,	c

The	i
modern	i
technology	c
has	c
changed	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
a	c
lot	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
Internet	i
makes	c
my	c
life	c
easier	c
.	c

Some	c
of	c
my	c
friends	c
live	c
in	i
overseas	c
,	i
we	i
keep	c
in	c
touch	c
by	i
e-mails	c
,	i
it	i
is	c
a	c
very	c
good	c
way	c
for	i
communicating	i
because	c
it	c
is	c
much	c
cheaper	c
than	c
a	c
phone	c
call	c
and	c
we	c
can	c
re-read	c
mails	i
and	c
keep	c
them	c
forever	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
very	c
useful	c
for	c
several	c
reasons	c
:	c

when	c
I	c
go	c
out	c
,	c
sometimes	c
my	c
parents	c
are	c
worried	c
so	c
they	c
phone	c
to	i
me	c
if	i
everything	c
is	c
going	i
alright	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
there	c
is	c
a	c
TV	c
in	c
my	c
parent	i
's	i
car	c
.	c

We	c
can	c
watch	c
TV	c
,	i
there	i
is	c
also	c
a	c
map	c
so	c
when	c
we	c
get	c
lost	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
very	c
east	i
to	c
find	i
out	i
the	i
place	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
writting	i
in	c
order	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
"	c
.	c

At	i
first	i
,	c
the	c
advertisement	c
said	c
that	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
starring	c
by	i
Tina	c
Truelove	c
and	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	i
that	i
was	c
not	c
true	c
,	i
Danny	c
Brook	c
did	c
not	c
act	c
in	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
it	i
was	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
and	c
I	c
got	i
disappointed	c
with	c
him	c
.	c

In	i
order	i
to	i
the	c
times	c
,	i
the	c
show	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
start	c
at	c
19.30	c
and	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
20.15	c
,	i
nobody	i
likes	c
to	c
wait	c
45	c
minutes	c
just	c
watching	c
empty	c
scenary	i
.	c

Another	c
thing	c
,	c
the	c
tickets	c
.	c

The	c
advertisement	c
said	c
that	c
there	c
were	c
discounts	c
available	c
,	i
that	i
was	c
false	c
,	c
there	c
were	i
not	c
any	c
kind	c
of	c
discounts	i
.	c

They	c
had	c
closed	c
it	c
because	c
they	c
had	c
found	c
the	c
food	c
in	c
bad	i
conditions	i
.	c

Just	c
to	c
finish	c
,	c
the	c
advertisement	c
said	c
that	c
the	c
show	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
,	c
let	c
me	c
tell	c
that	i
it	c
was	i
n't	i
not	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
the	c
theatre	c
should	c
give	c
me	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
and	c
I	c
hope	c
you	c
do	c
it	i
.	c

The	i
technology	i
has	c
changed	c
,	c
is	c
changing	c
and	c
it	c
will	c
change	c
our	c
daily	c
lifes	i
.	c

Technology	c
is	c
improving	c
every	c
day	c
,	c
soon	c
everything	c
will	c
be	c
done	c
by	c
a	c
machine	c
.	c

Now	c
we	c
can	c
cook	c
in	c
a	i
easier	c
way	c
than	c
ten	c
years	c
before	i
,	c
we	c
can	c
talk	c
with	c
somebody	c
who	c
is	c
10000	c
kilometres	c
from	c
us	c
and	c
we	c
can	c
know	c
what	c
's	c
happening	c
in	c
the	i
other	i
part	c
of	c
the	c
world	c
.	c

Another	c
thing	c
is	i
changing	c
our	c
life	i
is	c
the	c
computer	c
,	c
especially	c
Internet	i
.	c

More	c
and	c
more	c
people	c
are	c
connecting	c
through	i
the	c
net	c
.	c

Soon	c
we	c
wo	c
n't	c
need	c
to	c
get	i
out	i
from	i
our	c
homes	c
.	c

Technology	c
has	c
changed	c
so	i
much	i
our	i
daily	i
lifes	i
that	c
we	c
wo	c
n't	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
live	c
without	c
it	c
.	c

Nobody	c
can	c
imagine	c
to	i
live	i
without	c
a	c
T.V.	i
,	c
a	c
computer	c
,	c
a	c
microwave	c
,	c
a	c
telephone	c

There	c
are	c
machines	c
for	c
everything	c
,	c
to	i
write	i
,	c
to	i
cook	i
,	c
to	i
go	i
from	c
one	c
place	c
to	c
other	i
,	c
to	i
talk	i
with	c
somebody	c
who	c
is	c
not	c
with	c
you	c

Our	c
lifes	i
are	c
very	c
different	c
from	c
our	c
grandparent	i
's	i
lifes	i
and	c
that	c
's	c
because	c

Dear	c
manager	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
a	c
musical	c
show	c
which	c
is	c
called	c
"	c
Over	c
The	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
and	c
ask	c
for	c
money	i
back	c
.	c

This	c
show	c
was	c
presented	c
by	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
.	c

The	c
poster	c
also	c
told	c
me	c
that	c
I	c
could	c
visit	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
know	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
late	c
,	c
so	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
not	c
able	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
because	c
it	c
was	i
closed	i
before	c
the	c
show	c
has	i
been	i
finished	i
.	c

Thirdly	c
,	c
there	c
was	i
no	c
discounts	c
available	c
but	c
it	i
was	i
printed	i
on	i
the	i
poster	i
.	c

I	c
got	c
confused	c
and	c
disappointed	i
again	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
for	i
your	c
prompt	c
reply	c
and	c
improvement	i
.	c

Yours	c
Faithfully	c
,	c

How	c
has	c
modern	c
technology	c
changed	c
your	c
daily	c
life	c
?	c

The	c
world	c
is	c
changing	c
every	c
day	c
.	c

The	c
most	c
important	c
development	c
is	c
the	c
internet	i
system	i
which	i
is	c
connected	c
to	c
the	c
whole	c
world	c
's	c
computers	c
by	c
some	i
telephone	c
liens	i
.	c

You	c
can	c
send	c
a	c
letter	c
to	c
your	c
friend	c
by	c
an	i
e-mail	c
but	i
not	i
writting	i
it	c
on	c
a	c
piece	c
of	c
paper	c
and	c
send	i
it	c
by	c
post	c
.	c

It	c
just	c
takes	c
you	c
a	c
few	c
minutes	c
.	c

There	c
are	c
also	c
much	i
more	c
advantages	c
,	i
you	i
can	c
buy	c
somethings	i
in	c
a	c
supermarket	c
by	i
only	i
a	i
mail	i
order	i
,	i
you	i
do	c
n't	c
need	c
to	c
go	i
out	i
of	i
your	c
home	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
we	c
can	c
go	c
to	c
the	i
Mars	c
and	c
do	c
some	c
invesgation	i
.	c

So	c
,	c
we	c
know	c
much	c
more	c
about	c
our	c
universe	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
trains	c
can	c
go	c
faster	c
and	c
aeroplanes	c
can	c
travel	c
faster	c
.	c

The	i
modern	i
technology	c
has	c
changed	c
our	c
daily	c
life	c
.	c

It	c
aims	c
at	i
improving	i
our	c
standard	c
of	c
life	c
and	c
makes	i
us	c
live	i
more	c
comfortably	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
think	c
the	c
changes	c
are	c
good	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c
I	c
'm	c
writing	c
this	c
letter	c
to	c
you	c
because	c
I	c
'm	c
very	c
disappointed	c
and	c
I	c
believe	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
hang	i
me	c
some	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

But	c
that	c
evening	c
became	c
a	c
real	c
nightmare	c
!	c

Firstly	c
your	i
advertisement	c
is	c
a	c
real	c
lie	c
.	c

Discounts	c
available	c
?	c
?	c

Then	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
late	c
,	i
we	c
had	c
been	c
waiting	c
for	c
a	c
long	c
long	c
time	c
before	c
it	c
started	c
.	c

But	c
finally	c
it	c
started.	c
.	c

and	c
what	c
!	c
!	c

Shame	c
on	c
you	c
!	c

After	c
that	c
"	c
show	c
"	c
we	c
were	c
starving	c
and	c
we	c
had	c
planned	c
to	c
eat	c
in	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurand	i
but	c
what	c
a	c
surprise	c
!	c

It	c
was	c
closed	c
(	c
of	c
course	c
)	c
and	c
why	c
?	c

A	c
general	c
strike	c
...	c

It	c
was	c
n't	c
at	c
all	c
a	c
perfect	c
evening	c
I	i
'm	c
not	c
pleased	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
weep	c
if	c
I	c
was	c
n't	c
so	c
angry	c
.	c

To	c
summarize	c
I	i
want	c
that	i
you	c
hang	i
me	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
and	c
very	c
quickly	c
.	c

How	c
has	c
modern	c
technology	c
changed	c
your	c
daily	c
life	c
?	c

Modern	c
technology	c
had	c
changed	c
human	i
being	i
's	i
daily	i
life	i
long	c
before	c
I	c
was	c
born	c
.	c

Nowadays	c
according	i
to	i
me	i
the	i
most	c
important	c
revolution	c
is	c
connected	c
with	c
new	c
technologies	c
.	c

Let	c
's	c
take	c
the	c
mobil	i
phone	c
.	c

Our	c
parents	c
used	c
the	c
phone	c
to	c
make	c
an	i
important	c
appointment	i
.	c

Nowadays	c
everybody	c
has	c
got	c
a	c
phone	c
which	c
is	c
"	c
mobil	i
"	c
.	c

And	c
I	c
'm	c
not	i
different	c
I	i
've	c
got	c
one	c
and	c
it	c
has	c
changed	c
my	c
everyday	c
life	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
the	c
same	c
with	c
Internet	i
and	c
that	c
's	c
a	c
very	c
new	c
thing	c
.	c

I	c
send	c
and	c
receive	c
more	c
mails	i
than	c
letters	c
!	c

I	c
can	c
chat	c
with	c
my	c
sister	c
or	c
friends	c
without	c
speaking	c
when	c
I	c
'm	c
working	c
because	c
it	c
take	i
up	i
just	c
some	i
minutes	c
.	c

With	c
Internet	i
and	c
according	i
to	i
me	i
the	i
world	c
is	c
become	i
smaller	c
and	c
bigger	c
at	c
the	c
same	c
time	c
.	c

Smaller	c
because	c
I	c
can	c
visit	c
an	c
American	c
library	c
without	c
leaving	c
my	c
desk	c
and	c
bigger	c
because	c
it	c
seems	c
to	c
be	c
endless	c
.	c

Yes	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
has	c
been	i
changed	i
and	c
it	c
's	c
a	c
good	c
thing	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

I	c
'm	c
writting	i
this	c
letter	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
your	c
fake	i
advertisement	c
.	c

You	c
are	c
the	c
theatre	c
's	c
manager	c
so	c
I	c
suppose	c
you	c
are	c
the	c
right	c
person	c
to	c
complain	c
.	i

The	c
show	c
started	c
45	c
minutes	c
later	i
.	c

This	c
made	c
me	c
get	i
bored	c
.	c

You	c
also	c
refer	i
to	i
your	c
advertisement	c
that	c
there	c
are	c
some	c
discounts	c
available	c
but	c
there	c
were	c
n't	c
any	c
.	c

It	c
had	i
closed	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
late	c
start	c
of	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

Modern	c
technology	c
changed	i
not	c
only	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
but	c
also	c
the	c
life	i
of	c
many	c
people	c
.	c

So	i
I	c
turn	c
on	c
the	c
aircondition	i
with	c
timer	i
so	c
when	c
I	c
get	i
sleep	i
to	i
turn	i
off	c
by	c
itself	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
wake	c
up	c
if	i
I	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
homework	c
I	c
sit	c
on	i
my	c
computer	c
and	c
play	c
different	c
games	c
to	c
spend	i
my	c
time	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
go	c
to	c
bed	c
because	i
there	c
are	c
many	c
mosquitoss	i
I	i
turn	c
on	c
a	c
special	c
machine	c
with	c
pile	i
like	i
thing	c
in	c
it	c
which	c
kills	c
them	c
.	c

I	c
belive	i
that	c
modern	c
technology	c
has	c
effected	i
possitive	i
our	c
lives	c
.	c

It	c
must	c
be	c
great	c
.	c

So	c
exciting	c
!	c

And	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
have	c
chances	c
to	c
play	c
tennis	c
and	c
go	c
swimming	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
very	i
enjoying	c
playing	c
tennis	c
.	c

Further	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
a	c
question	c
.	c

Actually	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
gone	i
camping	c
so	c
I	c
really	c
have	c
no	c
idea	c
about	c
that	c
.	c

I	c
wonder	c
which	c
clothes	c
are	c
suitable	c
for	c
your	c
camping	c
.	c

And	c
How	c
about	c
the	c
money	c
?	c

I	c
am	c
really	c
expecting	i
going	c
camping	c

Dear	c
Mr.	c
Robertson	c
,	c

It	c
is	c
really	i
good	c
programme	c
,	c
especially	i
visiting	c
Science	i
Museum	c
and	c
National	i
Art	c
Gallery	c
would	c
be	c
great	i
opportunity	c
to	c
learn	c
about	c
art	c
and	c
latest	i
improvements	i
in	c
science	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
my	c
classmates	c
and	c
I	c
saw	c
the	c
advertisement	c
with	i
regarding	c
the	c
London	c
fashion	c
and	c
leisure	c
show	c
,	c
which	c
is	c
enclosed	c
,	c
and	c
want	c
to	c
take	c
this	c
opportunity	c
to	c
visit	c
it	c
,	c
if	c
you	c
allow	c
us	c
.	c

It	c
will	c
be	c
great	i
opportunity	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
free	c
for	c
students	c
and	c
we	c
will	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
latest	c
fashions	c
in	c
leisure	c
and	c
sports	c
wear	c
,	c
new	c
hairstyles	c
and	c
make	i
up	i
industry	i
.	c

Although	c
according	c
to	c
your	c
programme	c
,	c
we	c
will	c
be	c
visiting	c
Science	i
Museum	c
in	c
the	c
morning	c
and	c
shopping	c
in	c
the	c
afternoon	c
,	c
we	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
make	c
a	c
suggestion	c
which	c
can	c
help	i
us	c
to	c
be	i
able	i
to	i
stick	i
to	i
both	c
.	c

Thanking	c
in	i
advance	c
,	c
we	c
very	c
much	c
hope	c
that	c
you	c
will	c
give	c
your	c
attention	c
to	c
our	c
requirement	i
.	c

We	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
relating	i
to	i
this	c
matter	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

One	c
of	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
subject	i
of	c
the	c
media	c
is	c
to	c
inform	c
people	c
bout	i
famous	c
people	c
such	c
as	c
politicians	c
,	c
films	c
stars	c
or	c
successful	c
musicians	c
.	c

This	c
kind	c
of	c
people	c
are	c
known	c
as	c
paparazzi	c
.	c

it	i
is	c
not	c
important	c
whether	c
they	c
are	c
working	c
for	c
media	i
foundation	i
or	c
not	c
,	i
they	i
just	c
try	c
to	c
find	c
the	c
best	c
pose	i
.	c

After	c
taking	c
their	c
pictures	c
in	i
the	i
way	i
that	i
these	i
famous	i
people	i
would	i
not	i
allow	i
them	i
,	c
they	c
sell	c
the	c
pictures	c
and	c
make	c
a	c
fortune	c
without	c
asking	c
their	c
permission	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
famous	c
people	c
have	c
point	i
,	i
if	c
they	c
do	c
not	c
allow	c
paparazzis	i
to	c
take	c
their	c
pictures	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
the	c
best	c
example	c
would	c
be	c
Lady	c
Diana	c
.	c

This	c
can	i
not	i
be	c
the	c
way	c
in	i
finding	i
information	i
for	i
the	i
readers	i
.	c

I	c
cannot	c
express	c
how	c
happy	c
I	c
was	c
reading	c
your	c
letter	c
about	c
the	c
prize	c
I	c
won	c
and	c
about	c
2	c
wonderful	c
weeks	c
I	c
am	c
going	c
to	c
spend	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
in	c
the	c
USA	c
.	c

With	c
regard	c
to	c
your	c
questions	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
be	c
very	c
happy	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
arrange	c
my	c
trip	c
and	c
stay	c
at	c
the	c
camp	c
for	c
July	c
.	c

July	c
is	c
really	c
the	c
only	c
available	c
time	c
I	c
have	c
.	c

If	c
possible	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
.	c

I	c
spend	i
3	c
weeks	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
last	c
year	c
and	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
the	c
best	c
experience	c
of	c
my	c
life	c
.	c

I	c
can	c
say	c
it	c
with	c
confidence	c
that	c
I	c
am	c
quite	c
good	c
at	c
basketball	c
-	c
I	c
play	c
it	c
for	c
my	c
school	c
's	c
team	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
going	c
to	c
train	c
it	i
in	c
August	c
as	c
well	c
-	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
want	c
to	c
loose	i
touch	c
with	c
it	c
.	c

Tennis	c
is	c
just	c
something	c
new	c
that	c
I	c
recently	c
discovered	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
still	c
on	i
a	i
beginner	c
level	c
.	c

It	c
seems	c
like	c
a	c
good	c
oportunity	i
to	c
practice	i
it	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
appreciate	c
if	i
you	c
could	c
send	c
me	c
some	c
information	c
about	c
the	c
weather	c
in	c
California	c
at	c
this	c
time	c
of	c
year	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
a	c
little	c
concerned	c
about	c
the	c
clothes	c
that	c
I	c
should	c
take	c
.	c

Another	c
thing	c
is	c
money	c
.	c

How	c
much	c
money	c
do	c
you	c
think	c
I	c
should	c
take	c
with	c
me	c
?	c

Will	c
you	c
arrange	c
a	c
place	c
where	c
I	c
could	c
keep	c
the	c
money	c
secure	i
during	c
my	c
stay	c
at	c
the	c
camp	c
?	c

"	c
Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
"	c

If	c
I	c
was	c
asked	c
to	c
choose	c
the	c
least	c
attractive	c
thing	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
do	c
on	c
everyday	i
basis	c
,	c
shopping	c
would	c
most	c
definitely	c
be	c
placed	c
somewhere	c
on	i
top	i
of	c
the	c
list	c
.	c

If	c
it	c
would	i
be	i
possible	c
I	c
would	c
rather	c
have	c
someone	c
else	c
doing	c
shopping	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
like	c
and	c
do	c
n't	c
enjoy	c
spending	c
endless	c
hours	c
pushing	c
my	c
trolley	c
(	c
which	c
,	c
by	c
the	c
way	c
,	c
has	c
it	i
's	i
own	c
idea	c
of	c
where	c
it	c
want	i
's	i
to	c
go	c
)	c
between	c
other	c
desperate	c
people	i
baskets	c
,	c
just	c
to	c
find	c
that	c
perfect	c
tin	c
of	c
beans	c
or	c
a	i
toothpaste	c
.	c

Especially	c
that	i
it	c
is	c
so	c
hard	c
to	c
find	c
anything	c
in	c
a	c
modern	c
,	c
huge	c
and	c
stuffed	c
with	c
lots	c
of	c
merchandise	c
department	c
stores	i
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
if	c
you	c
happen	c
to	c
forget	c
something	c
,	c
you	c
will	c
have	c
to	c
force	c
your	c
way	c
back	c
through	c
crowds	c
of	c
other	c
shoppers	c
,	c
and	c
that	c
can	c
take	c
up	c
even	c
more	c
time	c
.	c

Where	c
's	c
the	c
fun	c
in	c
that	c
?	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
and	c
we	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

With	c
great	c
respect	c
,	c

It	c
was	c
dangerous	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
knew	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
climed	i
up	c
the	c
tree	c
.	c

My	c
friend	c
was	c
looking	c
at	c
me	c
from	c
below	c
.	c

I	c
went	c
on	c
climbing	c
until	c
I	c
saw	c
my	c
friend	c
's	c
model	c
aeroplane	c
.	c

If	c
I	c
had	c
n't	c
borrowed	c
it	c
from	c
him	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
n't	c
have	c
been	c
here	i
.	c

It	c
was	c
very	i
hurt	c
,	i
my	i
friend	c
rushed	c
to	c
me	c
than	i
ran	c
back	c
to	c
my	c
house	c
and	c
called	c
Mom	i
.	c

I	c
ca	c
n't	c
remember	c
anything	c
else	c
until	c
I	c
woke	c
up	c
at	c
a	c
hospital	c
,	c
lying	c
on	c
a	c
bed	c
with	c
my	c
leg	c
in	c
plaster	c
.	c

The	c
nurse	c
sitting	c
beside	c
me	c
said	c
to	c
me	c
,	c
'	c
Your	c
mother	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
word	c
with	c
you	c
,	c
'	c
then	c
she	c
went	c
out	c
.	c

Mom	i
came	c
in	c
,	c
looking	c
very	c
angry	c
,	i
I	c
prayed	c
for	c
a	c
short	c
conversation	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c

I	c
want	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
your	c
advertisment	i
about	i
the	c
theatre	i
'	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
'	c
I	i
had	c
a	c
very	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
.	c

Secondly	c
the	c
show	c
did	c
n't	c
start	c
until	c
20:15	c
but	c
it	c
should	c
have	c
started	c
19:30	i
so	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
sit	c
and	c
wait	c
which	i
was	c
very	c
boring	c
.	c

There	c
were	c
no	c
discounts	c
on	c
the	c
ticket	i
available	c
either	c
.	c

After	c
the	c
show	c
we	c
wanted	c
to	c
have	c
something	c
to	c
eat	c
in	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	i
rebuilding	i
.	c

In	c
the	c
advertisement	c
it	c
says	c
"	c
your	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
"	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
real	c
disappointment	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
have	c
the	c
money	c
back	c
that	c
I	c
spent	c
on	c
the	c
tickets	c
I	c
bought	c
.	c

Yours	c
Faithfully	c

She	c
had	c
always	c
been	c
like	c
that	c
,	c
said	i
my	i
best	i
friend	i
Ann	i
to	c
me	c
when	c
I	c
told	c
her	c
that	c
I	c
had	c
told	c
Pat	c
a	c
secret	c
yesterday	i
.	c

The	c
secret	c
was	c
that	c
I	c
was	c
in	c
love	c
with	c
Peter	c
in	i
my	c
course	c
.	c

Yesterday	c
when	c
I	c
arrived	c
to	i
the	i
college	c
,	c
I	c
saw	c
Pat	c
standing	c
with	c
Peter	c
and	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
other	c
boys	c
and	c
they	c
were	c
looking	c
strange	i
at	c
me	c
and	c
laufhing	i
.	c

I	c
felt	c
how	c
I	c
started	c
to	c
blush	c
.	c

After	c
that	c
I	c
never	c
went	c
back	c
to	c
the	c
course	c
again	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
for	i
the	c
musical	c
show	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
.	c

I	i
've	i
been	i
recently	i
seeing	i
in	i
your	c
theatre	c
during	c
my	c
week	c
's	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
I	i
must	c
say	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
very	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
!	c

Firstly	c
,	c
the	c
play	c
started	c
nearly	c
an	c
hour	c
later	c
as	i
I	c
expected	c
!	c

So	i
it	i
's	i
better	c
not	c
to	c
write	c
anything	c
if	c
you	i
do	i
n't	i
make	i
it	c
true	i
then	i
.	c

The	c
main	c
actor	c
,	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
was	c
changed	c
and	c
the	c
one	c
who	c
played	c
his	c
part	c
was	c
n't	c
as	c
good	c
as	c
I	c
expected	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
shocked	c
by	c
the	c
reason	c
for	c
which	c
it	c
was	i
closed	c
:	c
the	c
chef	c
went	i
away	i
after	c
he	c
received	c
a	c
phone	c
call	c
!	c

For	c
all	c
these	c
reason	i
,	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
ask	c
for	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
and	c
I	c
hope	c
to	c
hear	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
!	c

A	c
suggestion	c
?	c

Organize	i
better	i
your	i
shows	i
and	c
do	c
not	c
exagerate	i
with	c
publicity	c
!	c

I	c
'm	c
not	c
sure	c
if	c
I	c
must	i
say	c
technology	i
has	c
changed	c
our	c
life	c
in	c
positive	i
or	i
not	c
.	c

Certainly	c
,	c
thanks	c
to	c
it	c
,	c
we	c
can	c
do	c
things	c
today	c
that	c
were	c
impossible	c
a	c
few	c
centuries	c
ago	c
.	c

Nowadays	c
,	c
we	c
make	i
a	c
phone	c
call	c
with	c
an	c
astonish	i
rapidity	c
,	c
instead	i
at	i
my	c
grandparents	c
'	c
time	c
it	c
took	c
one	c
month	c
or	c
more	c
to	c
have	i
contact	i
with	c
people	c
abroad	c
,	c
because	c
the	c
only	c
means	c
of	c
communication	c
was	c
the	c
post	c
and	c
its	c
service	c
was	c
very	c
slow	c
!	c

Before	c
that	c
,	c
people	c
travelled	c
by	c
horse	c
or	c
worse	c
.	c

Fortunately	c
today	c
everyone	c
can	c
take	c
an	c
aeroplane	c
and	c
go	c
to	c
America	c
,	c
Australia	c
or	c
wherever	c
else	c
he	i
wants	i
!	c

It	c
allows	c
us	c
to	c
keep	i
connections	c
with	c
the	c
other	c
states	c
of	c
the	c
world	c
,	c
improves	c
our	c
knowledge	c
,	c
offers	c
us	c
news	c
,	c
advises	c
us	c
about	c
events	c
which	c
happened	i
or	c
will	c
happen	c
.	c

In	c
the	i
not	c
very	c
far	i
1914	i
,	c
parent	i
sent	c
their	c
sons	c
in	i
war	c
and	c
it	c
was	c
very	c
difficult	c
to	c
know	c
if	c
they	c
were	c
still	c
alive	c
or	c
dead	c
!	c

It	c
's	c
terrible	c
!	c

We	c
pay	c
less	c
attention	c
to	c
our	c
life	c
,	c
to	c
those	c
things	c
which	c
give	c
us	c
happiness	c
,	c
that	c
are	c
n't	c
money	c
,	c
success	c
,	c
power	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
everyone	c
should	c
live	c
his	c
own	c
life	c
how	c
he	c
wants	c
to	c
live	c
it	c
and	c
make	c
him	i
known	c
for	c
who	c
he	c
is	c
,	c
not	c
for	c
his	c
money	c
,	c
but	c
for	c
his	c
abilities	c
,	c
his	c
good	c
habits	c
,	c
his	c
personality	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
everyone	c
should	c
decrease	i
his	c
own	c
life	c
's	c
rythm	i
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
this	c
letter	c
to	c
complaint	i
about	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
that	c
Circle	i
Theatre	c
company	c
played	i
few	i
days	c
ago	c
.	c

The	c
first	c
thing	c
that	c
annoyed	c
me	c
were	c
the	c
forty-five	c
minutes	c
we	c
were	c
waiting	c
for	c
the	c
beginning	i
.	c

It	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
fault	i
of	c
responsability	i
for	c
a	c
theatre	c
like	c
yours	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
delay	c
like	c
this	c
one	c
.	c

He	c
was	c
not	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
and	c
the	c
main	c
reason	c
that	c
I	c
came	i
to	c
see	c
this	c
show	c
was	c
the	c
possibility	i
to	c
see	c
him	c
acting	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
a	c
fan	c
of	c
him	i
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
the	c
restarant	i
were	i
I	c
would	c
like	i
to	c
have	c
dinner	c
with	c
friends	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
closed	c
against	i
what	c
was	c
announced	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
.	c

These	c
are	c
the	c
reasons	c
why	c
I	c
am	c
complaining	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
if	c
there	c
will	c
be	c
some	i
money	i
back	i
.	c

I	c
will	c
be	c
waiting	c
news	i
from	c
you	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

The	c
only	c
thing	c
I	c
can	c
say	c
about	c
technology	c
is	c
that	c
has	i
driven	c
my	c
life	c
.	c

I	c
think	i
technology	i
does	i
n't	i
change	i
the	i
life	i
style	i
.	c

Is	i
the	c
life	i
style	i
or	c
necessities	i
from	i
people	c
what	i
make	c
technology	c
develop	c
.	c

All	c
kind	i
of	c
industrial	c
machines	c
are	c
created	c
to	c
solve	c
problems	c
,	c
improve	c
other	c
machines	c
or	c
to	c
do	i
n't	i
waste	i
so	i
many	i
time	c
.	c

But	c
these	c
ones	i
bring	c
new	c
problems	c
that	c
must	c
be	c
solved	c
by	c
others	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
school	i
holliday	i
here	c
in	c
Portugal	c
and	c
I	c
will	c
have	c
the	c
entire	c
month	c
to	c
travel	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
have	c
no	c
preference	c
for	c
the	i
weeks	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
mind	c
staying	c
in	c
log	c
cabins	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
prefer	c
camping	c
because	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
be	c
really	c
near	i
the	i
nature	c
.	c

Well	c
,	c
about	c
the	c
activities	c
,	c
I	c
love	c
Photography	c
,	i
I	c
made	i
a	c
course	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
take	c
beautiful	c
photos	c
of	c
the	c
Camp	c
.	c

And	c
I	c
always	c
was	c
good	c
at	c
swimming	c
,	i
now	i
I	c
'll	c
be	c
at	c
the	c
Camp	c
during	c
the	c
summer	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
good	c
idea	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
'll	c
need	c
to	i
the	c
trip	c
and	i
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
'll	c
need	c
.	c

Do	c
you	c
have	c
any	c
night	i
plan	i
,	c
like	c
going	c
to	c
discos	c
or	c
night	i
clubs	i
?	c

Can	c
you	c
give	c
this	i
informations	i
?	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
receving	i
your	c
letter	c
.	c

The	c
cities	c
are	c
the	c
main	c
commercial	c
centre	i
,	c
our	c
streets	c
are	c
full	c
of	c
billboard	i
advertising	c
many	c
things	i
and	i
.	c

Despite	c
this	c
shopping	c
culture	c
,	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
,	i
when	i
you	c
need	c
to	c
buy	c
something	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
look	c
for	c
the	c
best	c
price	c
,	c
what	i
is	c
always	c
a	c
work	i
of	i
time	i
,	c
and	c
if	c
you	c
find	c
a	c
shop	c
where	c
the	c
price	c
is	c
cheaper	c
,	c
it	c
must	i
be	c
crowded	c
.	c

The	c
solution	c
can	i
be	c
in	i
a	i
alternative	i
way	i
of	i
making	i
shops	i
like	i
Internet	i
.	c

You	c
can	c
by	i
anything	c
without	c
problem	i
,	i
this	i
is	c
a	c
good	c
thing	c
although	c
this	i
prevents	c
poor	c
people	c
from	c
shopping	c
by	i
Internet	i
,	c
because	c
you	c
have	c
to	c

Dear	c
sir	i
or	i
madam	i
,	c

Firstly	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
actor	i
of	i
the	c
show	c
.	c

On	i
your	c
advertisement	c
you	c
say	c
that	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
are	c
starring	c
in	c
the	c
play	c
but	c
I	c
am	c
sure	c
that	c
they	c
never	c
appear	i
on	c
the	c
stage	c
that	c
night	c
.	c

Secondly	c
another	i
ploblem	i
was	c
about	i
the	c
starting	c
time	c
,	i
according	i
to	c
your	c
advertisement	c
the	i
play	c
starts	c
at	c
19.30	c
and	i
instead	c
it	c
started	c
on	i
20:15	c
,	c
this	c
is	c
about	i
almost	c
an	c
hour	i
delay	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
there	i
were	i
several	i
prices	i
about	i
the	i
tickets	i
and	i
an	i
available	i

Something	i
that	c
was	c
n't	c
true	c

We	c
did	c
n't	c
get	c
any	c
discount	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
disappointed	c
about	i
the	c
whole	c
situation	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
not	c
happy	c
to	i
ask	c
for	c
a	c

The	c
21st	c
Century	i
is	c
also	c
known	c
as	c
the	c
gold	i
century	c
of	c
high	c
technology	c
and	c
science	c

And	c
I	c
must	c
admit	c
that	c
this	c
is	c
true	c
.	c

Many	c
thinks	i
have	c
changed	c
within	c
the	c
last	c
100	c
years	c
.	c

Technology	c
-	c
along	c
with	c
science	c
-	c
has	c
made	c
huge	c
steps	c
and	c
has	c
turned	c
into	c
a	i
growing	i
monster	i
which	i
does	i
n't	i
have	i
an	i
ending	i
.	c

Reserches	i
have	i
shown	c
that	c
almost	c
every	c
single	c
house	i
owns	c
a	c
P.C.	i
Some	c
people	c
use	c
them	c
for	c
their	c
job	c
because	c
they	c
do	i
need	c
it	c
,	c
but	c
others	c
,	c
like	c
children	c
,	c
use	c
it	c
just	c
for	c
fun	c
.	c

Other	c
examples	c
that	c
may	c
not	c
look	c
like	c
huge	c
technological	c

are	c

Bye	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c

I	c
am	c
writting	i
you	i
for	i
complaining	i
about	c
the	c
last	c
saturday	i
evening	c
performance	c
in	i
your	c
theatre	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
disappointed	c
!	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
the	c
principal	c
character	c
was	c
not	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
but	c
a	c
substitute	c
,	c
and	c
the	c
theatre	c
had	c
not	c
notified	c
the	c
audience	c
about	c
this	c
changing	i
before	c
.	i

Secondly	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
45	c
minutes	c
late	c
.	c

We	c
would	i
not	c
have	i
had	i
discounts	i
on	c
price	i
and	c
any	i
worker	c
wanted	c
to	c
give	c
us	c
an	c
explanation	c
for	c
that	c
.	c

After	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
we	c
decided	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
restaurant	c
to	i
dinner	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
for	c
work	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
sure	c
you	c
understand	c
why	c
I	c
am	c
so	c
upset	c
and	c
you	c
will	c
do	c
your	c
best	c
to	c
give	c
me	c
satisfaction	c
,	c
I	c
mean	c
,	c
refunding	c
me	c
exactly	c
what	c
I	c
had	i
paid	i
for	c
this	c
terrible	c
evening	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
very	c
soon	c
.	c

Modern	c
technology	c
has	c
changed	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
,	c
making	c
it	c
easy	c
,	c
with	c
less	c
effort	c
and	c
time	c
spent	c
.	i

All	c
this	c
in	c
one	c
morning	c
,	c
and	c
the	c
day	c
just	i
begins	i
,	c
what	c
doing	i
next	c
?	c

Technology	c
allows	c
to	i
have	c
more	c
time	c
to	i
distractions	i
or	c
to	i
other	c
things	c
we	c
really	c
like	c
to	c
.	i

We	c
can	c
take	c
care	c
of	c
whom	i
we	c
love	c
and	c
give	c
them	c
more	c
attention	c
,	i
time	c
is	c
not	c
a	i
really	i
problem	c
.	c

We	c
will	c
see	c
people	c
differently	c
,	c
with	i
more	c
calm	i
,	c
because	c
we	c
have	i
no	c
stress	c
and	c
we	c
are	c
not	c
in	c
a	c
hurry	c
to	c
do	c
something	c
else	c
.	c

We	c
will	c
be	c
more	c
comprehensible	i
with	c
others	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
the	c
first	c
step	c
for	i
a	c
true	c
fraternity	c
.	c

All	c
this	c
modern	c
technology	c
increase	i
the	c
level	c
of	c
polluted	i
products	c
that	c
can	i
not	i
be	c
easily	c
destructed	i
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
modern	c
technology	c
allows	c
me	c
to	c
live	c
better	c
and	c
to	c
have	c
more	c
time	c
to	c
do	c
what	c
I	c
really	c
like	c
,	c
although	c
I	i
know	c
,	c
all	c
this	c
has	c
a	c
price	c
.	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
:	c

I	c
was	c
really	c
happy	c
when	c
I	c
knew	i
I	c
won	c
the	c
first	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c

will	c
take	c
my	c

in	c
June	c
and	c
have	c
the	c
result	i
in	c
August	c
.	c

I	c
enjoy	c
singing	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
and	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
share	c
my	c
music	c
with	c
the	i
others	c
.	c

I	c
also	c
like	c
climbing	c
because	c
I	c
like	c
the	c
view	c
on	c
the	c
top	c
of	c
hills	c
.	c

Finaly	i
,	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
know	c
what	c

Do	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
have	c
answers	c
to	c
your	c
questions	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
the	c
perfect	c
time	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
go	c
on	c
holiday	c
because	c
the	c
12th	c
July	i
is	c
my	c
birthday	c
.	c

I	c
want	c
to	c
sleep	c
in	c
tents	c
because	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
's	c
more	c
adventurous	c
better	i
scenery	c
,	c
and	c
atmosphere	c
.	c

The	c
other	c
thing	c
I	c
'm	c
good	c
at	c
is	c
tennis	c
.	c

Last	c
of	c
all	c
I	c
have	c
questions	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c

Looking	c

you	c
soon	c

People	c
today	c
shops	i
sevendays	i
a	c
week	c
with	c
their	c
family	c
,	c
friends	c
etc.	c
But	c
I	c
think	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

The	c
more	c
stuff	c
we	c
buy	c
the	i
more	c
we	c
throw	c
away	c
.	c

Shopping	c
with	c
some	c
friends	c
may	c
be	c
fun	c
but	c
you	c
must	c
also	c
remember	c
that	c
you	c
are	c
spending	c
money	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
you	c
can	c
do	c
sports	c
which	i
is	i
enjoyable	c
and	c
good	c
for	c
your	c
health	c
.	c

The	c
ozone	c
layer	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

Firstly	c
I	c
would	c
lice	i
to	c
say	c
that	c
I	c
am	i
very	c
dissappointed	i
with	c
the	c
show	c
and	c
that	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
have	c
the	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
,	c
as	c
you	i
had	i
advertised	c
.	c

The	c
main	c
character	c
of	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
,	c
which	i
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
say	c
was	c
n't	c
the	c
"	c
BEST	c
"	c
,	c
was	c
awfull	i
.	c

His	c
act	i
was	c
not	c
good	c
and	c
he	c
did	c
n't	c
seem	c
like	i
acting	c
Even	i
my	c
son	c
could	c
act	c
better	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
sitting	c
and	i
waiting	c
for	c
forty	i
five	i
minutes	c
until	c
the	c
play	c
started	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
dissappointed	i
what	i
else	i
can	i
I	i
write	i
.	c

It	c
was	c
suppose	i
to	c
be	c
my	c
perfect	c
everning	i
out	c
.	c

But	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
.	c

I	c
will	i
ask	i
my	i
money	c
back	c
.	c

In	c
Conclusion	i
I	i
'd	c
like	c
to	c
recoment	i
that	c
you	c
should	c
,	i
first	c
,	i
know	c
what	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
offer	c
and	c
the	i
advertising	i
it	c
.	c

Yours	c
sensirly	i

Helena	c
.	i

I	c
should	c
n't	c
have	c
told	c
her	c
that	c
my	c
dad	c
had	c
physcological	i
problems	c
.	c

I	c
knew	c
that	c
she	c
was	c
going	c
to	c
spread	c
it	c
around	c
and	c
tell	c
it	i
to	i
my	c
brother	c
.	c

It	c
all	c
started	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
about	c
10	c
years	c
old	c
,	c
like	i
my	c
brother	c
now	i
,	c
and	c
I	c
overheard	c
my	c
mother	c
talking	c
about	c
my	c
father	c
and	c
his	c
problems	c
,	i
to	c
my	c
aunt	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
hurt	c
inside	c
and	c
cried	c
till	c
my	c
tears	c
run	i
dry	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
n't	c
accept	c
it	c
.	c

All	c
these	c
years	c
I	c
believed	c
that	c
my	c
father	c
was	c
killed	c
in	c
a	c
car	c
accitend	i
.	c

Now	c
in	i
the	c
age	c
of	c
seventeen	c
I	c
made	c
the	c
huge	c
mistake	c
to	i
say	i
,	i
this	c
problem	c
to	c
my	c
"	c
friend	c
"	c
Pat	c
.	c

I	c
knew	c
that	c
she	c
is	i
close	c
to	c
my	c
brother	c
and	c
that	c
she	c
loves	i
him	c
a	c
lot	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
never	c
thought	c
that	c
things	c
could	i
turn	c
like	i
this	c
.	c

When	c
,	i
one	c
day	c
Pat	c
came	c
over	c
to	c
my	c
house	c
we	i
started	c
arguing	c
about	c
common	i
things	c
and	c
in	i
our	c
fite	i
suddenly	i
came	i
about	i
the	i
subject	i
of	i
my	i
father	i
and	i
his	i
problems	i
.	c

My	c
brother	c
could	c
n't	c
stay	c
away	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
realised	c
it	i
,	c
it	c
was	c
too	c
late	c
.	c

The	c
secret	c
was	i
revilied	i
.	c

And	c
now	c
I	c
try	c
to	c
help	c
my	c
brother	c
beaus	i
I	c
've	c
been	c
there	c
,	c
in	c
his	c
place	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
know	c
how	c

I	c
am	c

that	i
I	c
can	c
only	c
go	c
in	c
July	c
,	c
the	c
summer	c
holiday	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
got	c
a	c
place	c
in	i
the	i
university	c
and	c
it	c
will	c
start	c
in	c
August	c

I	c
would	c

like	c
to	c
ask	c
accommodation	i

offer	c
are	i
in	c
tens	i
or	c
log	c
cabins	c
.	c

I	c
like	c
to	c
sleep	c
on	c
open	c
land	c
and	c
see	c
the	c
sun	c
come	c
up	c
in	c
the	c
morning	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
,	c
I	c
choose	c
painting	c
and	c
sailing	c
for	c
my	c
activities	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

I	c
go	c
look	c
round	c
shops	i
.	c

When	c
I	c
see	c
some	c
clothes	c
in	c
the	c
window	c
I	c
like	c
,	c
I	c
would	i
go	c
in	c
and	c
try	c
them	c
.	i

The	i
other	i
thing	i
I	i
do	i
n't	i
like	i
going	i
shopping	i
is	i
in	i
the	c
weekend	c
.	c

All	c
the	c
shops	c
are	c
full	c
of	c
people	c
,	c
and	c
people	c
treat	c
the	c
articals	i
like	c
rubbish	c
.	c

Hang	c
them	c
every	i
where	i
after	c
they	c
tried	i
and	i
that	i
was	i
not	c
suit	c
them	c
.	c

Also	c
in	i
the	i
weekend	c
shopping	c
.	c

Mc	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
shopping	c
is	c
nice	i
to	c
spend	c
you	i
leisure	c
time	c
and	c
give	c
yourself	c
to	i
relax	c
sometimes	c
,	c
but	c
suggest	i
that	c
never	i
in	i
the	c
weekend	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
express	c
my	c
great	c
disappointment	c
about	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
I	c
attended	c
in	c
your	c
theatre	c
last	c
weekend	c
.	c

According	c
to	c
your	c
advertisement	c
,	c
it	c
stars	c
DANNY	c
BROOK	c
AND	i
TINA	c
TRUELOVE	c
,	c
but	c
surprisinggly	i
,	c
it	i
was	i
proformed	i
by	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
who	i
I	c
even	i
did	i
n't	i
know	c
the	c
name	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	i
be	i
started	i
at	c
19:30	c
but	c
it	c
was	i
half	c
hour	i
later	c
,	c
until	i
20:15	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
you	c
to	c
look	c
into	c
the	c
matter	c
immediately	c
and	c
I	c
insisted	i
on	c
some	i
money	c
back	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

The	c
first	c
and	c
most	c
important	c
thing	c
is	c
that	c
modern	c
technology	c
have	i
made	c
our	c
life	c
easier	c
,	c
for	c
instance	c
ricer	i
cooker	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
invention	c
,	c
all	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
do	c
is	c
putting	i
rice	c
on	i
it	c
and	c
switch	c
on	i
,	c
it	c
makes	c
cooking	c
more	c
effeciently	i
.	c

It	c
is	c
often	c
suggested	c
that	c
,	i
modern	c
technology	c
makes	c
the	c
gap	c
bigger	c
between	c
peoples	i
,	c
they	c
get	c
used	c
to	c
communicating	c
with	c
the	c
machine	c
then	c
forget	c
how	c
to	c
deal	c
with	c
human	c
beings	c
.	c

Mr	c
Smith	c
,	c

Spending	c
a	c
week	c
in	c
London	c
for	i
holidays	i
last	c
week	c
,	c
I	c
had	i
decided	i
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
see	c
your	c
wonderful	c
musical	c
show	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
really	c
disappointed	i
evening	c
!	c

Indeed	c
,	c
firstly	i
,	c
the	c
play	i
did	c
n't	c
start	c
at	c
19:30	c
as	c
it	c
was	c
planned	i
on	i
the	c
advertisement	c
but	c
45	c
minutes	c
later	c
(	c
20:15	c
)	c
.	c

Then	c
,	c
the	c
actors	c
(	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
)	c
who	c
were	c
mentioned	c
and	i
supposed	i
to	c
play	i
were	c
n't	c
present	c
.	c

There	c
were	c
different	c
actors	c
who	c
took	c
the	i
role	i
.	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
on	i
the	c
advertisement	c
I	c
got	c
,	c
was	i
written	c
that	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
opened	i
.	c

I	c
told	c
myself	c
,	c
I	c
could	c
eat	c
over	c
there	c
and	c
maybe	c
spend	i
a	c
better	c
evening	c
than	c
at	i
the	c
begining	i
but	i
I	c
was	c
n't	c
lucky	c
because	c
the	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
!	c

As	c
you	c
can	c
notice	i
,	c
my	i
perfect	c
evening	c
I	c
had	c
supposed	i
,	i
was	c
a	c
nightmare	c
;	c
that	c
's	c
why	c
I	c
would	c
please	i
you	i
to	i
give	i
my	i
money	c
back	c
because	c
I	c
cannot	c
tolerate	c
such	c
a	c
thing	c
!	c

Indeed	c
,	c
the	i
modernism	i
helps	c
us	c
to	c
lead	c
a	c
confortable	i
and	c
better	c
life	c
than	c
before	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
cars	c
,	i
planes	c
are	c
a	i
wonderful	c
invention	i
!	c

Human	i
being	i
became	c
more	c
and	c
more	c
clever	c
and	c
built	c
wonerful	i
things	c
thanks	c
to	c
his	c
thoughts	c
and	c
his	c
hands	c
.	c

Everyone	c
gets	i
a	c
television	c
at	c
home	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
a	c
revolution	c
,	c
something	c
which	c
was	c
unbelievable	c
a	c
few	c
centuries	c
ago	c
.	c

Thus	c
,	c
the	i
modern	c
technology	c
seems	c
to	c
be	c
a	c
positive	c
way	c
in	i
order	i
to	c
improve	c
our	c
daily	c
life	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
!	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
because	c
of	c
same	i
information	c
that	c
you	c
need	c
.	c

Of	c
course	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
.	c

To	i
stay	i
in	c
a	c
tent	c
will	c
remind	c
my	i
of	c
a	i
unforgottable	i
time	c
.	c

There	c
are	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
interesting	c
activities	c
and	c
it	i
makes	c
hard	i
to	c
choose	c
only	c
two	c
.	c

Given	c
the	c
circumstances	c
I	i
would	c
like	c
to	c
learn	c
more	c
about	c
Photograhy	i
and	c
Painting	i
.	c

Taking	c
picture	i
is	c
a	c
new	c
experience	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
never	c
been	c
I	i
California	c
.	c

How	c
is	c
the	c
weather	c
there	c
in	c
July	c
?	c

What	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
would	c
you	c
recommend	c
taking	c
with	c
me	c
?	c

Hi	c
Kim	c
,	c

How	c
are	c
you	c
doing	c
?	c

I	c
could	c
n't	c
write	c
you	i
because	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
busy	c
.	c

I	c
applied	c
for	c
a	c
job	c
at	c
the	c
ticket	c
office	c
because	c
I	c
hopped	i
to	c
see	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
diffrent	i
people	c
.	c

You	c
know	c
everybody	c
has	c
to	c
cross	c
this	c
spot	c
!	c

Given	c
the	c
circumstances	c
they	i
asked	c
my	i
for	i
helping	i
in	c
the	c
kitchen	c
.	c

You	c
can	c
imagine	c
how	c
disappointed	c
I	c
was	c
.	c

But	c
it	c
turned	c
out	c
as	i
a	c
funny	i
and	c
interesting	c
job	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
to	c
prepare	c
the	c
ingredians	i
for	c
every	c
meal	c
.	c

And	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
controll	i
that	c
nothing	c
will	i
be	i
missed	c
.	c

On	i
the	i
other	i
hand	i
I	c
had	c
a	c
lot	c
to	c
do	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
never	c
bored	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
interested	c
to	c
hear	c
about	c
your	c
new	c

Your	c
friend	c
,	c

Artemis	c

I	i
've	i
attened	i
your	c
shown	i
on	i
one	c
of	i
the	i
evening	c
,	c
during	c
my	c
stay	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

In	c
your	c
advertisement	c
you	c
've	c
mention	c
"	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
"	c
would	c
be	c
starring	c
and	c
as	c
it	c
turned	c
out	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
different	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
disapointed	i
by	c
this	c
.	c

You	c
also	c
mention	c
that	c
your	c
show	c
would	c
starts	i
at	c
19.30	c
but	c
to	c
my	c
knowleage	i
it	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
and	c
that	c
is	i
fourty-five	i
minutes	c
of	c
waiting	c
.	c

It	i
also	i
mention	i
other	i
services	i
would	i
be	i
availalde	i
to	i
the	i
adicne	i
.	c

For	c
Example	c
there	c
were	c
no	c
discounts	c
available	c
and	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
were	i
closed	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
when	c
it	c
was	c
mean	i
to	c
be	c
open	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
acording	i
to	c
the	c
advertisement	c
but	c
was	i
closed	c
dure	i
to	c
the	c
delay	c
of	i
the	c
preformane	i
.	c

Lastly	c
your	i
advertisement	c
mention	i
clearly	c
that	c
this	c
would	c
be	c
"	c
Your	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
!	c
"	c
but	c
sadly	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
real	c
waste	c
of	c
time	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

And	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
a	c
refun	i
,	i
You	c
have	c
wasted	c
my	c
evening	c
and	c
money	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
to	c
hear	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c

For	i
the	c
past	c
100	c
year	i
,	c
fashion	c
has	c
change	i
a	c
great	c
deal	c
.	c

Now	i
a	i
day	i
clothes	c
is	i
designed	c
to	c
be	c
more	c
comfortable	c
.	c

You	c
can	c
just	c
"	c
pop	c
down	c
the	c
road	c
"	c
and	c
go	c
shopping	c
.	c

Material	i
and	c
coloures	i
of	c
your	c
cloths	i
has	i
changed	c
since	c
the	c
early	c
1900's	i
to	i
2000	i
.	c

Synethetic	i
was	i
created	c
by	c
scientis	i
.	c

Clothes	c
are	c
now	c
mass	i
producted	i
and	c
desing	i
by	c
desingers	i
.	c

Desingres	i
are	c
unique	c
in	c
the	i
way	c
but	c
their	c
desings	i
are	c
some	i
times	i
more	c
,	i
a	c
pirce	i
of	c
art	c
and	c
not	c
for	c
realistic	i
perposoe	i
.	c

It	c
is	c
hard	c
to	c
imageine	i
what	c
people	c
would	i
were	i
in	c
100	c
years	i
time	c
,	c
because	c
since	c
the	c
1900's	i
clothes	c
have	c
reduce	i
into	i
smaller	i
item	i
and	i
more	i
preticle	i
.	c

May	i
be	i
it	i
would	i
contine	i
reduceing	i
in	i
100	i
years	i
to	i
come	i
.	c

It	c
could	c
be	c
that	c
you	c
would	i
carry	c
a	c
small	c
round	c
box	c
.	c

It	c
would	c
provide	c
you	c
with	c
a	c
new	c
type	c
of	c
material	c
to	c
cover	c
you	i
body	c
and	c
you	c
can	i
chosse	i
what	c
you	c
want	c
to	c
wear	c
by	c
pressing	c
bottons	i
.	c

This	c
would	c
be	c
very	c
easy	c
to	c
mantage	i
but	c
that	i
mean	i
no	c
shopping	i
for	c
girls	c
.	c

It	c
would	c
be	c
scarly	i
to	c
live	c
in	i
the	i
new	i
100	i
years	i
,	c
but	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
interesting	c
to	c
see	c
what	c
will	c
happen	c
.	c

Hopefully	c
it	i
would	i
n't	i
be	i
verybody	i

around	i
neaked	i

Dear	c
Sirs	c

Thank	c
you	c
,	c
it	i
's	i
great	c
to	c
hear	c
for	i
about	c
my	c
winning	i
.	c

First	c
I	c
can	c
do	i
the	i
travel	c
only	c
in	c
July	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
get	c
freetime	i
in	c
any	c
other	c
month	c
.	c

The	c
next	c
thing	c
is	c
,	i
that	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
a	c
log	c
cabine	i
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
want	c
to	c
sleep	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
'm	c
afraid	c
of	c
snakes	c
and	c
similar	c
animals	c
.	c

Another	c
thing	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
try	c
,	c
if	c
possible	c
,	c
is	c
to	c
play	c
Golf	i

It	c
's	c
a	c
very	c
favourite	i
sport	c
also	i
in	i
our	i
region	i
(	i
area	i
)	i
,	c
but	c
I	c
did	i
never	c
found	c
time	c
to	c
do	c
it	c

I	c
think	c

this	c
will	c
be	c
all	c
I	c

Hi	c
Kim	c
,	c

The	c
concert	c
started	c
on	c
the	c
15th	c
of	c
may	i
and	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
real	i
great	c
session	c
in	c
our	c
valley	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
so	c
happy	c
when	c
they	c
told	i
me	c
to	c
help	c
them	c
with	c
the	c
organisation	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
responsible	c
to	i
the	c
advertisments	i
and	c
I	c
had	i
also	i
to	c
invite	c
the	c
"	c
important	c
persons	i
"	c
from	c
our	c
governement	i
.	c

I	c
've	c
learned	c
a	c
lot	c
about	c
management	c
and	c
especially	c
-	i
how	c
stars	c
are	i
living	i
.	c

One	c
evening	c
we	c
went	i
all	i
together	i
out	c
for	c
diner	i
and	c
after	c
we	c
visited	i
our	i
new	c
disco	c
.	c

We	c
arrived	c
at	c
home	c
early	c
in	c
the	c
morning	c
-	c
it	c
was	c
great	c
.	c

Now	c
Kim	c
,	c
I	c
will	c
finish	c
my	c
letter	c
but	c
I	c
promise	c
you	i
to	c
write	c
again	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c
,	i
maybe	i
if	c
I	c
've	c
developed	c
the	c

Dear	c

The	c
advertisement	c

false	c

e.g.	c

of	c
the	c

were	c
incorrect	c

Danny	c
Brook	c
was	c
not	c

Moreover	c

My	c
daily	c
life	c
has	c
been	c
changed	c
much	c
by	c
modern	c
technology	c
without	c
me	c
noticing	c
it	c
up	c
to	c
this	c
point	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
am	c
too	c
tied	i
to	c
go	c
out	c
but	c
want	c
to	c
meet	c
some	c
new	c
people	c
,	c
computer	c
technology	c
provides	c
me	c
with	c
this	i
opportunity	c
.	c

Using	c
the	c
Internet	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
meet	c
people	c
all	i
around	c
the	c
world	c
not	i
going	c
anywhere	c
.	c

With	c
all	c
the	c
resources	c
on	c
the	c
Net	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
need	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
library	c
as	c
often	c
as	c
I	c
used	c
to	c
.	c

I	c
guess	c
I	c
have	c
n't	c
realised	c
until	c
now	c
how	c
much	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
has	c
been	c
changed	c
by	c
modern	c
technology	c
.	c

This	c
leaves	c
me	c
wondering	c
how	c
beneficial	c
its	c
influence	c
is	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
request	c
your	c
permission	c
for	c
us	c
to	c
visit	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
on	c
14th	c
March	c
.	c

All	c
of	c
us	c
is	i
appreciated	i
that	i
we	i
could	i
have	i
this	c
opportunity	c
.	c

Because	c
most	c
students	c
have	c
never	c
been	c
to	c
London	c
before	c
,	i
also	i
we	c
could	i
visit	c
some	c
famous	c
places	c
which	c
we	c
wanted	i
to	c
go	c
.	i

However	c
,	c
we	c
would	c
be	c
grateful	c
if	c
you	c
would	c
arrange	c
a	c
time	c
to	c
visit	c
the	c
show	c
additionally	i
.	c

Moreover	c
some	c
students	c
think	c
that	c
they	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
do	c
fashion	c
studies	c
in	c
future	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
would	i
accept	c
and	c
would	c
n't	c
mind	c
this	c
idea	c
,	c
we	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
visit	c
it	c
instead	c
of	c
shopping	c
in	c
the	c
afternoon	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Nowadays	c
,	c
quite	c
a	c
few	c
famous	c
people	c
suffer	c
their	i
private	c
life	c
from	c
disturbers	c
such	c
as	c
journalists	c
or	c
reporters	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
think	i
how	c
media	i
effect	i
to	i
famous	c
people	c
.	c

Few	i
years	c
ago	c
,	c
we	c
had	c
a	i
terrible	c
news	c
of	c
death	i
of	c
Lady	c
Diana	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
after	c
chasing	i
for	c
long	i
time	c
,	c
she	c
was	c
dead	i
because	i
of	i
car	i
accident	c
.	c

It	c
must	c
be	c
a	c
good	c
example	c
of	c
media	i
disaster	c
.	c

I	c
understand	c
she	c
had	c
a	c
good	c
reason	c
to	c
be	c
chased	c
by	c
it	c
.	c

However	c
she	i
definetely	i
deserve	i
to	c
have	c
a	c
private	c
life	c
as	c
one	i
of	i
citizen	c
.	c

Human	c
right	i
must	c
be	i
existed	i
for	c
all	c
people	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
few	i
famous	c
people	c
desire	i
to	c
be	c
watched	c
by	c
media	i
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
many	c
people	c
love	c
to	c
watch	c
a	c
gossip	c
programme	c
on	c
TV	c
or	c
in	i
a	c
magazine	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
one	c
of	i
fun	c
in	c
our	c
life	c
.	c

On	c
balance	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
happy	c
to	c
know	c
I	c
won	c
the	c
prize	c
for	i
two	c
weeks	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
in	c
the	c
U.S.A	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
only	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
at	c
that	c
time	c
I	c
am	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
free	c
to	c
travel	c
because	c
of	c
my	c
holidays	i
in	i
the	i
school	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
rather	c
to	i
stay	i
in	c
tents	i
,	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
stayed	c
in	c
tents	c
before	c
and	c
I	c
liked	c
,	i
it	i
is	c
more	c
pleasent	i
than	c
stay	i
in	c
log	c
cabins	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
such	c
a	c
wonderful	c
experience	c
.	c

Refering	i
about	i
sports	c
I	i
would	c
choose	c
swimming	c
and	c
basketball	c
,	c
because	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
child	c
I	c
used	c
to	c
swim	c
a	c
lot	c
,	c
I	c
won	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
prizes	c
and	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
competitions	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
I	c
do	c
not	c
have	c
anything	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
,	c
I	c
just	c
want	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
everything	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
.	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

I	c
agree	c
that	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
ejoyable	i
because	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
things	c
could	i
occur	i
you	i
.	c

The	i
last	i
month	c
was	i
a	c
robbery	c
in	c
a	c
commercial	i
centre	i
next	c
to	c
my	c
house	c
,	i
somebody	i
stole	c
a	c
lady	c
's	c
purse	c
with	c
all	c
her	c
identifications	i
,	c
credit	c
cards	c
and	c
cash	c
,	c
even	c
more	i
her	c
flight	i
ticket	c
.	c

Therefore	c
she	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
tramits	i
to	c
cancell	i
their	i
credit	c
cards	c
and	c
to	c
change	c
her	c
flight	i
ticket	c
.	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
I	c
would	c
say	c
that	c
even	c
when	i
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	i
enjoyable	c
we	c
have	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
because	c
we	c
do	c
not	c
have	c
another	c
option	c
.	c

Anyway	c
the	c
accommodation	c
is	c
not	c
a	c
big	c
problem	c
for	c
me	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
away	c
most	c
of	c
the	c
time	c
.	c

Moreover	c
would	i
like	c
if	i
it	c
is	c
possible	c
to	c
have	c
an	c
opportunity	c
to	c
play	c
tennis	c
and	c
basketball	c
.	c

Any	c
little	c
tournaments	i
of	c
this	c
kind	c
would	c
be	c
greateful	i
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

As	c
you	c
know	c
last	c
month	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
help	c
at	c
a	c
concert	c
,	c
the	c
one	c
that	c
I	c
told	c
you	c
in	i
my	c
last	c
letter	c
.	c

I	c
wanted	c
to	c
go	c
very	i
much	i
there	i
and	c
so	c
go	i
there	c
for	i
helping	i
was	c
for	c
me	c
a	c
unique	c
chance	i
.	c

From	c
the	c
first	c
time	i
that	c
went	i
there	c
I	c
understood	c
that	c
I	c
was	c
going	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
great	c
night	c
.	c

OK	c
in	i
the	c
beginning	c
the	c
other	c
helpers	c
and	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
work	c
to	c
do	c
,	c
so	i
as	c
cleaning	c
the	c
stage	c
and	c
so	i
some	c
decoration	c
work	c
.	c

But	c
as	i
the	c
correct	i
started	c
and	c
we	c
finished	c
what	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
,	c
we	c
were	c
free	c
to	c
do	c
what	i
ever	i
we	c
wanted	c
.	c

So	c
the	c
party	c
started	c
...	c

Do	c
n't	c
ask	c
the	c
time	c
in	i
which	i
I	c
come	i
home	c
because	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
remember	c
!	c

Some	c
of	c
my	c
friends	c
who	c
were	c
also	c
helping	c
told	c
me	c
that	c
we	c
returned	c
at	c
six	c
o'clock	c
in	c
the	c
morning	c
!	c

It	c
was	c
really	c
an	c
unforgettable	c
experience	c
.	c

Best	c
whishes	i

Dear	c
Mr.	c
maneger	i
of	c
The	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
:	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
to	c
explain	i
some	c
problems	c
about	i
your	c
theatre	c
's	c
show	c
,	i
first	i
I	c
have	c
to	c
say	c
to	c
you	c
that	c
there	c
was	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
starring	i
the	i
act	i
.	c

I	c
expect	i
that	i
starring	i
the	i
act	i
was	i
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
there	c
was	c
another	c
man	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
very	c
disappointed	c
with	c
the	c
hour	i
that	c
the	c
act	i
started	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
been	c
waiting	c
for	c
more	c
than	c
half	c
an	c
hour	c
.	c

When	c
the	c
show	c
had	c
finished	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
visit	c
the	c
restaurant	i
of	i
the	i
theatre	i
because	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

The	c
reason	c
they	c
gave	c
us	c
,	i
was	c
that	c
they	c
had	c
n't	c
got	c
any	c
waiters	c
.	c

For	c
all	c
those	c
reasons	c
I	c
give	i
to	i
you	c
,	c
I	c
ask	c
for	c
the	c
money	c
I	c
had	i
payed	i
to	i
you	i
back	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
my	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
sorry	c
if	c
I	c
make	i
any	i
problem	i
to	i
you	i
,	c
but	c
I	c
'm	c
very	c
angry	c
and	c
it	c
was	c
your	c
fault	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
attention	c
,	c

I	c
was	c
fourteen-year-old	i
and	c
I	c
was	c
with	c
my	c
bestfriend	i
,	c
Pat	c
.	c

Our	c
parents	c
took	c
us	c
there	c
because	c
they	c
wanted	c
that	i
we	i
became	i
good	c
and	i
polite	c
girls	c
.	c

The	i
life	i
in	c
the	c
school	c
was	c
very	c
boring	c
and	c
sometimes	c
we	c
organized	c
games	c
to	c
get	i
funny	i
in	i
there	c
.	c

I	c
thought	c
that	i
was	c
good	i
idea	c
told	i
to	i
Pat	c
because	c
we	c
could	c
use	c
to	i
look	c
for	c
exams	c
,	c
and	c
then	c
we	c
could	c
pass	c
all	c
of	c
them	c
.	c

All	c
our	c
mates	c
wanted	c
to	c
enjoy	c
our	c
fantastic	c
and	i
secret	c
path	c
to	c
look	c
for	c
exams	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
should	c
say	c
that	c
I	c
had	c
read	c
fantastic	c
reviews	c
of	c
it	c
in	c
several	c
newspapers	c
,	c
specially	c
regarding	c
the	c
starring	c
actors	c
'	c
superb	c
performances	c
.	c

With	c
all	c
these	c
considerations	c
in	c
mind	c
,	c
I	c
attended	i
the	i
referred	i
day	i
to	i
your	i
theatre	i
with	c
the	c
aim	c
of	c
having	c
a	c
perfect	c
evening	c
.	c

In	i
the	i
beginning	i
,	c
it	c
was	c
impossible	c
to	c
obtain	c
any	c
of	c
the	c
offered	c
discounts	c
,	c
even	c
though	c
I	c
presented	c
an	c
official	c
ISIC	c
card	c
.	c

Then	c
,	c
the	c
audience	c
had	c
to	c
wait	c
45	c
minutes	c
over	i
the	c
announced	c
timetable	i
for	c
the	c
show	c
to	c
get	c
started	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

Nowadays	c
we	c
can	c
see	c
a	c
very	c
different	c
world	c
from	c
the	c
one	c
our	c
grandparents	c
,	c
or	c
even	c
our	c
parents	c
,	c
were	c
living	c
in	c
.	c

Actually	c
,	c
whereas	c
they	c
used	c
to	c
talk	c
about	c
how	c
their	c
daily	c
life	i
had	c
changed	c
in	c
comparison	c
with	c
previous	c
generations	c
'	c
,	c
we	c
remain	c
astonished	c
looking	i
how	i
our	c
lifes	i
are	c
changing	c
frenetically	c
.	c

We	c
have	c
hardly	c
assimilated	c
a	i
new	c
technology	c
when	c
it	c
is	c
replaced	c
or	c
modified	c
by	c
another	c
.	c

Of	c
course	c
,	c
they	c
have	c
liberated	c
us	c
from	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
tough	c
routines	c
,	c
giving	c
us	c
the	c
chance	c
to	c
have	c
more	c
free-time	i
.	c

People	c
spend	c
more	c
and	c
more	c
time	c
working	c
,	c
searching	c

you	c

our	c
visit	c
to	c

you	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
to	c
complaint	i
about	c
the	c
problem	c
that	c
happened	c
in	c
the	c
play	c
called	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
"	c
,	c
and	c
for	i
this	i
reason	i
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
get	c
some	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

The	c
problem	c
is	c
that	c
most	c
part	i
of	c
the	c
advertistment	i
had	i
mistakes	i
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
there	c
were	c
not	i
discount	i
on	c
tickets	i
'	c
price	i
,	c
and	c
it	i
was	i
advertised	c
.	c

Despite	i
of	i
this	i
fact	c
,	c
that	i
I	c
did	c
not	c
care	c
about	c
it	i
at	c
the	i
beginning	i
,	c
when	c
the	c
play	c
started	c
I	c
did	c
not	c
see	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
who	c
is	c
my	c
favourite	c
actor	c
,	i
I	c
saw	c
another	c
actor	c
who	c
was	c
not	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
.	c

Therefore	c
for	i
all	c
things	i
I	i
would	c
be	c
happy	c
to	c
get	c
some	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

If	c
I	c
had	i
not	i
it	c
,	c
I	c
could	c
not	c
do	c
most	c
part	i
of	c
the	c
things	c
that	c
I	c
do	c
today	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
if	c
I	c
had	i
not	i
it	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
not	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
move	i
out	c
of	c
my	i
city	c
because	c
I	c
would	c
not	c
have	c
car	i
.	c

Nowadays	c
with	i
my	c
computer	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
travel	c
everywhere	i
in	c
the	c
world	c
,	c
just	c
with	i
it	c
connected	c
with	i
a	c
modem	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
if	c
someday	i
I	c
forgot	c
the	i
book	c
,	c
with	i
the	i
internet	i
I	i
can	i
find	i
the	i
book	i
inside	i
it	i
,	c
and	c
more	c
information	c
.	i

With	c
the	c
TV	c
I	c
can	c
know	i
all	c
the	c
information	c
at	i
the	i
moment	i
,	c
moreover	c
I	c
can	c
see	c
films	c
throw	i
it	c
.	c

And	c
the	c
best	c
thing	c
is	c
that	c
it	c
entertaints	i
me	c
alone	c
or	c
with	c
people	c
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
without	c
the	i
technology	c
we	c
could	c
not	c
live	c
as	c
good	i
as	c
we	c
live	c
know	i
,	c
and	c
our	c
lives	c
would	c
be	c
so	c
much	i
boring	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

I	c
like	c
competitive	c
and	c
changelling	i
sports	c
,	i
I	c
enjoy	c
myself	i
comparing	c
my	c
skill	c
with	c
other	c
players	c
and	c
,	c
if	c
possible	c
,	c
I	i
rather	i
practising	i
sports-activities	i
not	i
indoor	i
,	c
but	c
open	c
air	c
.	i

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
if	c
special	c
clothes	c
are	c
needed	c
and	c
how	i
the	c
weather	c
is	c
in	i
this	i
period	i
like	i
.	c

The	c
one	c
last	c
thing	c
that	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
is	c
if	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
bring	c
with	c
me	c
money	c
for	c
expenses	c
not	c
included	c
in	c
your	c
invitation	c
.	c

Let	c
me	c
know	c
this	c
information	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

13	c
June	c
2000	c

I	c
have	c
been	c
asked	c
to	c
write	c
a	c
report	c
about	c
the	c
lessons	c
and	c
other	c
activities	c
that	c
should	c
be	c
filmed	c
to	c
make	c
a	c
short	c
video	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
given	c
a	c
questionnaire	c
to	c
other	c
students	c
of	i
my	c
class	c
to	c
know	c
their	c
preferences	c
about	i
this	c
choise	i
and	c
we	c
all	c
believe	c
that	c
the	c
first	c
lesson	c
that	c
should	c
be	c
filmed	c
is	c
Philosophy	i
.	c

The	c
reason	c
is	c
that	c
all	c
students	c
are	c
interested	c
in	c
it	c
and	c
the	c
teacher	c
is	c
so	c
good	c
in	i
explaing	i
problems	c
that	c
the	c
whole	c
class	c
takes	c
part	c
in	c
discussions	c
about	c
specific	c
aspects	c
of	c
the	c
subject	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
that	c
these	c
my	i
suggestions	c
can	c
be	c
accepted	c
and	c
appreciated	c
.	c

The	c
manager	c

Sir	c
,	c
I	c
returned	c
very	c
unhappy	c
from	c
my	c
holidays	c
.	c

The	c
reason	c
is	c
that	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
that	c
I	c
had	c
seen	c
with	c
my	c
wife	c
,	c
first	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
started	c
late	c
.	c

We	c
bought	c
tickets	c
for	c
the	c
second	c
show	c
,	c
that	i
was	c
at	c
19.30	c
and	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
!	c

We	c
were	c
interested	c
on	i
see	i
the	c
actors	c
that	c
appeard	i
on	c
the	c
tickets	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
disappointed	c
when	c
,	c
in	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
we	c
saw	c
another	i
actors	c
.	c

I	c
asked	i
you	c
to	c
consider	c
all	c
my	c
reasons	c
and	c
turned	i
back	i
my	c
money	c
,	i
I	c
think	c
is	i
the	c
only	c
thing	c
you	c
can	c
do	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
comprehension	i

It	c
was	c
saturday	i
night	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
,	i
with	c
my	c
sister	c
Pat	c
alone	c
in	c
my	c
home	c
.	c

That	c
night	c
I	c
was	c
invited	c
to	c
a	c
great	c
party	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
was	i
punished	i
,	c
and	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
stayed	i
at	c
home	c
with	c
my	c
sister	c
.	c

My	c
parents	c
were	c
out	i
for	c
the	c
weekend	c
.	c

When	c
it	c
was	c
time	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
party	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
escape	c
home	i
without	c
telling	c
my	c
sister	c
,	i
unfortunately	i
when	c
I	c
arrived	i
she	c
was	c
waiting	c
me	i
in	c
my	c
room	c
.	c

Dear	c
Jane	c
Clark	c
,	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
congratulate	c
you	c
on	c
your	c
wonderful	c
"	c
Arts	c
Festival	c
"	c
.	c

You	c
have	i
a	c
really	c
great	c
idea	c
to	c
create	c
this	c
sort	c
of	c
Festival	i
.	c

I	c
would	i
like	i
to	i
come	i
next	c
year	c
with	c
a	i
great	c
pleasure	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
will	c
not	c
angry	i
if	c
I	c
give	c
you	c
some	c
advice	c
?	i

At	i
first	i
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
talk	c
about	c
your	c
section	c
"	c
Stars	c
and	c
Artists	c
"	c
.	c

Because	c
the	c
spectators	c
will	c
probably	c
more	i
interested	c
in	c
your	c
festival	c
if	c
they	c
know	c
the	c
celebrities	c
.	c

I	c
also	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
talk	c
about	c
your	c
concerts	c
.	c

They	c
are	c
too	c
small	c
for	c
all	c
the	c
people	c
.	c

Could	c
you	c
do	c
something	c
for	i
these	c
problems	c
?	c

All	c
the	c
sections	c
of	c
your	c
festival	c
were	c
great	c
but	c
I	c
think	c
there	c
were	c
not	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
"	c
Plays	c
and	c
films	i
"	c
.	c

I	c
love	c
films	c
and	c
Plays	i
also	c
,	c
and	c
I	i
'll	i
hope	i
to	c
have	c
more	c
films	c
or	c
Plays	i
next	c
year	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
a	c
good	c
idea	c
to	c
have	c
reasonably-priced	c
for	i
weekends	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	i

First	c

I	i
want	c
you	c
to	c
know	c
I	c
am	c
really	c
happy	c
about	c
the	c
prize	c

Refering	i
to	i
accommodation	c
I	c
would	c
rather	c
to	i
stay	i
in	c
tents	i
because	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
gone	i
on	i
camping	c
so	i
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
have	i
the	i
experience	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
not	c
really	c
keen	c
on	c
art	i
that	i
is	c
why	c
I	c
prefer	i
doing	c
some	c
sports	c
like	c
surfing	c
and	c
sailing	c

Besides	i
,	c
I	c
wonder	c
if	c
I	c
will	c
share	c
the	i
tend	i
or	c
not	c
and	c
if	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
take	i
it	c
from	i
here	i
or	c
if	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
provided	c
by	c
you	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
fordward	i

Yours	c

As	i
few	c
months	c
ago	c
I	c
chated	i
,	c
by	i
internet	i
,	c
to	c
a	c
nice	c
guy	c
from	c
Buenos	c
Aires	c
,	i
who	c
happened	c
to	c
be	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
member	i
of	c
"	c
Los	c
Pericos	c
"	c
.	c

We	c
started	c
mailing	c
each	c
other	c
and	c
became	c
good	c
friends	c
.	c

The	c
problem	c
was	c
that	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
technics	i
was	c
from	c
England	c
and	c
nobody	c
there	c
spoke	c
nor	i
a	c
word	c
in	i
English	c
so	c
I	c
was	c
asked	c
to	c
be	c
the	c
interpreter	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
so	c
great	c
!	c
!	c

Not	c
only	c
because	c
I	c
learnt	c
a	c
lot	c
about	c
concerts	c
and	c
music	c
,	c
but	c
also	c
because	c
I	c
practised	c
my	c
English	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
about	c
accommodation	c
,	c
I	c
'd	c
prefer	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
,	c
becouse	i
it	c
is	c
more	c
confortable	i
than	c
the	i
tent	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
if	c
I	c
will	c
visit	c
at	c

,	c
I	c
SAW	c
A	c
VERY	c
ATTRACTIVE	c
SIGN	c
:	c
THE	i
"	i
OVER	i
THE	i
RAINBOW	i
"	i
MUSICAL	c
SHOW	i
WAS	c
BEING	i
PLAYED	i
AT	c
YOUR	c
THEATRE	c
,	c
MOREOVER	c
,	c
THE	c
WONDERFUL	c
DANNY	c
BROOK	c
WAS	c
THE	c
PROTAGONIST	i
OF	i
IT	c
.	c

WE	c
ASKED	c
ABOUT	c
"	c
THE	c
DISCOUNTS	c
"	c
THAT	c
WERE	c
OFFERED	c
IN	c
THE	c
ADVERTISEMENT	c
AND	c
THE	c
ONLY	c
THING	c
THAT	c
THE	c
LADY	c
WHO	c
WAS	c
SELLING	c
COULD	i
SAY	c
WAS	c
:	c
WHAT	c
DISCOUNTS	c
?	c

THEN	c
,	c
WE	c
MOVED	c
INSIDE	c
THE	c
THEATRE	c
AND	c
WE	c
HAD	c
TO	c
WAIT	c
45	c
MINUTES	c
UNTIL	c
THE	c
SHOW	c
BEGAN	c
!	c
!	c
,	c
WHILE	c
WE	c
WERE	c
WAITING	c
,	c
WE	c
THOUGHT	c
WE	c
COULD	c
GO	c
TO	c
THE	c
RESTAURANT	c
AFTER	c
THE	c
EVENT	c
,	c
AND	c
THEN	c
,	i
WE	c
REALIZED	c
IT	c
WAS	c
CLOSED	c

BY	c
THE	c
TIME	c
THE	c
SHOW	c
STARTED	c
,	c
WE	c
WERE	c
SO	c
ANGRY	c
THAT	c
THE	c
ONLY	c
THING	c
I	c
REMEMBER	c
IS	c
THAT	c
DANNY	c
BROOK	c
WAS	c
N'T	c
ACTING	c

I	c
THINK	c
YOU	c
HAVE	c
ALREADY	c
REALIZED	c
THAT	c
IT	c
WAS	c
N'T	c
A	c
PLEASURE	c
FOR	c
US	c
TO	c
SEE	c
THE	c
SHOW	c
,	c
SO	c
I	c
HOPE	c
YOU	c

ME	c
OUR	c

IF	c
YOU	c

N'T	c

AT	c

GIVE	c
ME	c
AN	c
EXPLANATION	c

YOURS	c
FAITHFULLY	c

HOW	c
HAS	c
MODERN	c
TECHNOLOGY	c
CHANGED	c
YOUR	c
DAILY	c
LIFE	c
?	c

I	c
CAN	c
READ	c
ALL	c
THE	c
NEWS	c
AS	c
SOON	c
AS	c
THEY	i
HAPPEN	i
AT	i
THE	c
VIRTUAL	c
NEWSPAPERS	c
AND	c
I	c
CAN	c
TALK	c
WITH	c
MY	c
FOREIGN	c
FRIENDS	c
THANKS	c
TO	c
THE	c
ICQ	c
PROGRAM	c
,	i
I	c
HAD	c
NEVER	c
USED	c
INTERNET	i
BEFORE	c
,	c
BUT	c
IT	c
HAS	c
CHANGED	c
MY	c
ENTIRE	c
LIFE	c
,	c
AND	c
IT	c
IS	c
MUCH	c
BETTER	c
THAN	c
IT	c
USED	c
TO	c
BE	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

I	c
was	c
all	c
the	c
more	c
angry	c
as	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
instead	c
of	c
19:30	c
as	i
it	i
was	c
written	c
in	c
your	c
ad	c
!	c

Another	c
problem	c
:	c
there	c
was	c
no	c
discount	c
available	c
!	c

Finally	c
,	c
at	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
this	c
very	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
,	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
-	c
which	c
was	c
also	c
mentioned	c
in	c
your	c
ad	c
-	c
but	c
I	c
was	c
told	c
that	c
this	c
latter	i
was	c
closed	c
because	i
of	i
a	c
private	c
party	c
!	c

To	c
put	c
it	c
in	c
a	c
nutshell	c
,	c
contrary	c
to	c
what	c
was	c
explained	i
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
my	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
and	c
that	c
is	c
why	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
get	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

In	c
fact	c
,	c
she	c
knew	c
that	c
even	c
if	c
Sally	c
was	c
her	c
best	c
friend	c
,	c
she	c
would	c
not	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
keep	c
such	c
a	c
secret	c
.	c

It	c
might	c
seem	c
a	c
bit	c
strange	c
but	c
if	c
Pat	c
had	c
been	c
able	c
to	c
choose	c
whether	c
she	c
wanted	c
to	c
know	c
a	c
secret	c
or	c
not	c
,	c
she	c
would	c
have	c
prefered	i
not	c
to	c
know	c
it	c
.	c

Pat	c
was	c
totally	c
upset	c
.	c

She	c
felt	c
all	c
the	c
more	c
ill	c
at	c
ease	c
as	c
Sally	c
trusted	c
her	c
.	c

Thus	c
when	c
Sally	c
asked	c
her	c
not	c
to	c
reveal	c
the	c
secret	c
,	c
Pat	c
ran	c
away	c
,	c
when	i
home	c
,	c
locked	i
herself	c
in	c
her	c
bedroom	c
.	c

But	c
when	c
she	c
saw	c
the	c
phone	c
that	c
she	c
used	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
call	c
her	c
friends	c
,	c
she	c
started	c
to	c
cry	c
since	c
she	c
knew	c
that	c
she	c
would	c
use	c
it	c
.	c

Mr	c
John	c
Smythe	c
,	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
the	i
starring	c
actors	c
were	c
supposed	c
to	c
be	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
,	i
Tina	c
did	c
act	c
,	c
but	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
was	c
replaced	c
by	c
an	c
awful	c
actor	c
whose	c
name	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
recall	c
.	c

Second	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
the	c
play	c
was	c
suposed	i
to	c
start	c
at	c
19:30	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
.	c

Another	c
thing	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
,	i
is	c
that	c
your	i
advertised	c
that	c
discounts	c
were	c
available	c
,	c
but	c
there	c
was	c
n't	c
any	c
discount	c
at	c
all	c
.	c

As	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
have	c
a	c
"	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
"	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
I	c
have	c
the	c
right	c
to	c
ask	c
for	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
understand	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

Pat	c
's	c
story	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

Now	c
you	i
've	i
probably	c
asking	c
yourself	c
what	c
does	c
it	i
mean	c
,	c
well	c
,	c
now	c
I	c
'm	c
going	c
to	c
explain	c
it	c
to	c
you	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
having	c
some	c
family	c
problems	c
,	c
so	c
my	c
marks	c
were	c
getting	i
down	c
and	c
down	c
.	c

Pat	c
was	c
worried	c
,	c
she	c
did	c
n't	c
know	c
what	c
to	c
do	c
.	c

That	c
afternoon	c
she	c
visited	c
me	c
and	c
told	c
me	c
a	c
plan	c
she	c
had	c
designed	c
to	c
make	c
my	c
marks	c
rise	c
.	c

I	c
thought	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
great	c
idea	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
stole	c
about	c
ten	c
tests	c
we	c
were	c
planned	i
to	c
do	c
.	c

Pat	c
could	c
n't	c
stand	c
the	c
pressure	c
of	c
the	c
"	c
crime	c
"	c
so	c
she	c
told	c
the	c
school	c
directors	c
that	c
I	c
stole	c
the	c
tests	c
.	c

I	c
never	c
accused	c
her	c
of	c
lying	c
,	c
and	c
I	i
you	c
ask	c
me	c
why	c
,	c
I	c
really	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
just	c
received	c
your	c
letter	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
so	c
pleased	c
with	c
the	c
news	c
.	c

I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
that	c
the	c
best	c
month	c
to	i
travel	c
to	c
the	c
U.S.A	c
is	i
on	i
july	i
because	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
on	c
hollidays	i
in	c
this	i
month	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
really	c
worry	c
about	c
the	c
accommodation	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
,	c
but	c
if	c
I	c
can	c
tell	i
you	i
wich	i
one	i
I	i
prefer	i
I	c
'll	c
choose	c
in	i
tent	i
.	c

This	c
is	c
because	c
is	i
more	c
exciting	c
and	c
fun	c
than	c
not	i
in	c
log	c
cabins	c
.	c

I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
about	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
'll	c
need	c
for	c
two	c
weeks	c
in	c
your	c
country	c
and	c
what	c
sort	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
bring	c
to	c
Camp	c
California	c
next	c
july	i
.	c

Sincerely	c
,	c

How	c
are	c
you	c
doing	c
?	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
to	c
explain	c
what	c
I	c
did	c
last	c
month	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
great	c
,	c
believe	c
me	c
!	c

I	c
went	c
with	c
a	c
group	c
of	c
friends	c
to	c
help	c
and	c
organise	c
a	c
gig	c
of	c
a	c
pop	c
band	c
.	c

I	c
enjoyed	c
a	i
lot	i
doing	i
this	i
and	c
at	i
least	i
the	c
gig	c
was	c
free	c
for	c
all	c
of	c
us	c
.	c

The	c
concert	c
was	c
in	c
a	c
massive	c
club	c
and	c
the	c
tickets	c
were	c
sold	c
out	c
.	c

Well	c
Kim	i
,	c
I	c
hope	c
to	c
see	c
you	c
soon	c
and	c
take	c
care	c
.	c

Love	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
,	c

Last	c
night	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
show	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
very	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
,	c
even	c
though	c
I	c
heard	c
that	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
exciting	c
.	c

Two	c
days	c
before	c
I	c
read	c
the	i
advertisment	i
for	c
this	c
show	c
,	c
where	i
Danny	i
Brook	c
was	c
starring	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
last	i
evening	c
there	c
was	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
and	c
that	c
was	c
very	c
disappointing	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
receive	i
your	c
reply	c
with	c
my	c
money	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

Pat	c
and	c
I	c
had	c
been	c
friends	c
for	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
and	c
as	c
my	c
best	c
friend	c
he	c
knew	c
all	c
my	c
secrets	c
.	c

Yesterday	c
afternoon	c
,	c
when	c
I	c
went	c
home	c
,	c
my	c
mother	c
want	i
to	c
talk	c
me	i
for	i
something	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
went	c
in	i
her	c
bedroom	c
to	c
speak	c
with	i
her	c
.	c

She	c
told	c
me	c
that	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
stay	c
at	c
home	c
for	i
that	i
weekend	c
and	c
not	c
to	i
go	i
out	i
with	c
my	c
friends	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
went	c
in	i
my	c
bedroom	c
I	c
reliased	i
that	c
Pat	c
had	c
told	c
my	c
mother	c
for	i
the	c
party	c
,	c
because	c
noone	i
else	c
knew	c
that	c
my	c
mother	c
did	c
not	c
know	c
that	c

I	c
called	c
him	c
and	c
we	c
had	c
a	c
big	c
argument	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writting	i
in	c
order	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
which	i
name	i
is	i
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
that	i
I	c
could	i
see	i
in	c
your	c
theatre	c
recently	c
.	c

Then	c
I	c
got	c
nervous	i
and	c
I	c
thought	c
that	c
the	c
organization	c
was	c
very	c
bad	c
because	c
nobody	c
explained	c
us	i
the	c
reasons	c
.	i

Finally	c
,	c
when	c
the	c
musical	c
started	c
I	c
realized	c
that	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
my	c
favourite	c
actor	c
,	c
was	c
not	c
there	c
.	c

After	c
the	c
show	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
drink	i
a	c
coffee	c
and	c
to	c
smoke	c
a	c
cigarrete	i
to	c
try	c
calm	i
myself	c
and	c
suddenly	c
I	c
could	c
see	c
that	c
the	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
the	c
free	i
day	i
for	i
the	i
barman	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
indignatged	i
because	c
I	c
wasted	c
my	c
time	c
and	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
horrible	c
evening	c
so	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
you	c
return	i
my	c
money	c
and	c
take	c
notes	i
of	c
all	c
these	c
problems	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
do	c
not	c
return	c
my	c
money	c
I	c
will	c
send	c
a	c
letter	c
to	c
a	c
lawyer	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

HOW	c
HAS	c
MODERN	c
TECHNOLOGY	c
CHANGED	c
YOUR	c
DAILY	c
LIFE	c
?	c

A	c
long	c
time	c
ago	c
technology	c
was	c
n't	c
an	c
important	c
element	i
for	c
people	c
because	c
they	c
did	c
n't	c
appreciate	c
it	c
.	c

Nowadays	c
,	c
technology	c
is	c
changing	c
our	c
life	c
every	c
day	c
.	c

For	c
instance	c
,	c
modern	c
technology	c
is	c
changing	c
the	c
way	c
I	c
work	c
.	c

My	c
computer	c
is	c
faster	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
able	c
to	c
do	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
things	c
on	i
that	i
I	i
wasted	i
a	i
lot	i
of	i
time	i
before	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
I	c
realized	i
that	c
modern	c
technology	c
not	i
is	i
as	c
good	c
as	c
people	c
think	c
:	c
I	c
hate	c
mobiles	c
.	c

I	c
know	c
that	c
some	c
people	c
need	c
them	c
to	c
work	c
but	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
understand	c
why	c
teenagers	c
need	c
it	i
.	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
modern	c
technology	c
is	c
changing	c
my	c
work	c
,	c
my	c
life	c
,	c
and	c
my	c
friends	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c
After	c
I	c
had	c
read	c
your	c
advertisement	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
"	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
"	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
watching	c
your	c
musical	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
"	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
did	c
not	c
start	c
on	c
time	c
but	c
fourty-five	i
minutes	c
later	i
.	c

This	c
made	c
me	c
a	c
little	c
bit	c
angry	c
because	c
I	c
already	c
had	c
troubles	i
with	i
buying	c
a	c
ticket	c
before	i
:	c
although	c
it	c
was	c
proclaimed	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
,	c
there	c
were	c
no	c
Â£	c
15	c
and	c
Â£	c
10	c
discounts	c
available	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
did	c
not	c
mind	c
anymore	c
because	c
I	c
knew	c
that	c
a	c
show	c
with	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
would	c
be	c
worth	c
this	c
.	c

That	c
was	c
why	c
I	c
was	c
really	c
shocked	c
recognizing	i
that	c
there	c
was	c
another	c
actor	c
playing	c
.	i

This	c
actor	c
was	c
not	c
almost	i
as	c
brilliant	c
as	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
not	c
have	c
paied	i
so	c
many	i
money	c
if	c
I	c
had	c
known	c
this	c
before	c
.	c

At	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
the	c
musical	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
"	c
rescue	c
"	c
this	c
evening	c
by	c
visiting	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
Gabe	c
Grumman	c
(	c
Mrs	c
)	c

"	c
The	c
Old	c
Man	c
and	c
the	c
Sea	c
"	c

I	c
heard	c
somebody	c
say	c
"	i
Exciting	c
books	c
always	c
describe	c
people	c
in	c
difficult	c
situations	c
"	c
.	c

Well	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
not	c
agree	c
that	c
this	c
statement	c
is	c
always	c
true	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
is	c
true	c
in	c
the	c
case	c
of	c
the	c
book	c
"	c
The	c
Old	c
Man	c
and	c
the	c
Sea	c
"	c
by	c
Ernest	c
Hemingway	c
.	c

The	c
context	c
of	c
the	c
book	c
is	c
easy	c
to	c
understand	c
and	c
not	c
very	c
spectacular	c
:	c
an	c
old	c
fisherman	c
is	c
alone	c
on	c
the	c
vast	c
sea	c
,	c
fighting	c
with	c
a	c
strong	c
fish	c
he	c
had	i
caught	c
.	c

The	c
excitement	c
is	c
not	c
created	c
by	c
bloody	c
fights	c
but	c
by	c
the	c
strength	c
of	c
the	c
protagonist	c
.	c

The	c
reader	c
feels	c
with	i
him	c
,	c
wants	c
to	c
know	c
if	c
he	c
will	c
win	c
or	c
wonders	c
why	c
he	c
will	c
not	c
give	c
up	c
.	c

Although	c
this	c
situation	c
might	c
not	c
very	i
difficult	c
or	c
important	c
for	c
anybody	c
else	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
for	c
this	c
old	c
man	c
and	c
I	c
found	c
it	c
very	c
exciting	c
to	c
follow	c
this	c
story	c
until	c
it	i
's	i
quiet	c
,	c
sad	c
end	c
.	c

I	c
was	i
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
called	c
'	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
'	c
.	c

There	c
I	c
was	i
many	i
problems	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
arrived	c
at	c
the	c
theatre	c
at	c
9:15	c
because	c
the	c
start	i
time	i
was	c
at	i
9:30	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
fed	c
up	c
to	i
wait	i
.	c

They	c
were	c
worst	i
than	c
the	c
previst	i
actors	c
.	c

After	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
my	c
friends	c
and	c
I	c
were	c
very	c
furious	c
in	i
spite	i
of	i
that	i
.	c

We	c
decided	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
to	c
eat	c
something	c
and	c
to	c
relax	c
.	c

The	c
surprise	c
was	c
that	c
the	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
give	c
back	i
money	i
because	c
everything	c
what	i
you	c
wrote	c
in	c
your	c
advertisement	c
was	c
not	c
true	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
your	i
answer	c
soon	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
say	i
you	c
this	c
is	c
the	c
last	c
time	c
which	i
I	c
come	c
to	c
your	c
theatre	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
recollected	i
all	c
answers	i
and	c
I	c
have	c
made	i
this	c
article	c
.	c

Most	c
of	i
people	c
think	c
that	c
character	c
people	i
and	c
clothes	c
are	c
together	i
.	c

And	c
people	c
will	c
wear	c
cibernetic	i
clothes	c
but	c
in	i
the	c
same	c
time	c
comfortable	c
clothes	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
most	c
of	i
people	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
will	c
wear	c
glasses	c
.	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
,	c

I	c
received	c
your	c
letter	c
the	c
other	c
day	c
,	c
I	i
was	c
very	c
happy	c
to	c
find	c
out	c
that	c
I	c
won	i
two	c
weeks	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
.	c

It	i
is	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
an	c
apprentice	c
,	c
so	c
they	c
let	i
me	i
have	i
my	i
vacations	i
only	i
in	i
July	i
!	c
!	c

It	c
is	c
more	c
like	c
adventure	i
being	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
,	c
and	c
you	c
are	c
closer	c
to	c
the	i
nature	c
,	c
and	c
the	c
animals	c
!	c

For	c
the	i
activities	c
I	c
think	c
I	c
will	c
choose	c
swimming	c
because	c
I	c
love	c
swimming	c
and	c
being	c
in	c
the	c
water	c
.	c

And	c
for	c
the	c
other	c
I	i
will	c
chose	i
tennis	c
,	i
I	c
really	c
enjoy	c
this	c
sport	c
,	i
I	c
am	c
not	c
really	c
a	c
good	c
player	c
but	c
I	c
like	c
to	c
practice	i
tennis	c
during	i
my	c
free	c
time	c
!	c

Since	c
I	c
'm	c
coming	c
during	i
the	c
month	c
of	c
July	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
should	c
I	c
take	c
with	c
me	c
,	i
and	i
I	c
have	c
another	c
question	c
,	i
it	i
's	i
about	c
money	c
.	c

And	c
is	c
it	c
better	c
to	c
have	c
change	i
or	c
checks	i
?	c

Best	c
Regards	i
,	c

Helen	c

For	c
exemple	i
you	i
go	c
into	c
a	c
cloth	i
shop	c
,	c
you	c
see	c
all	c
those	c
women	c
running	c
around	c
trying	c
to	c
find	c
the	c
shirt	c
that	c
would	i
fit	i
their	c
new	c
skirt	c
,	c
so	c
they	c
are	c
looking	c
every	i
where	i
,	c
pushing	c
you	c
because	c
they	c
think	c
that	c
you	c
will	c
take	c
the	c
shirt	c
that	c
they	c
want	c
.	c

And	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
wait	c
after	c
to	i
buy	c
it	c
,	c
so	c
finally	c
you	c
waited	i
so	c
long	c
that	c
you	c
are	i
getting	i
late	c
,	c
so	c
you	c
get	c
stressed	c
to	i
.	c

So	c
it	c
's	c
really	c
not	c
enjoyable	c
to	c
go	c
shopping	c
.	c

You	c
get	c
headaches	c
,	c
you	c
get	c
stressed	c
,	c
and	c
finally	c
you	c
get	c
bruses	i
because	c
of	c
the	c
woman	c
that	i
pushed	c
you	c
to	c
get	c
the	c
pretty	c
skirt	c
before	c
you	c
!	c
!	c
!	c

Dear	c
Ms.	c
Ryan	c

I	c
recived	i
your	c
letter	c
recently	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
really	c
happy	c
learning	i
that	c
I	c
won	i
the	c
first	c
prize	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
to	c
answer	c
your	c
questions	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
that	c
my	c
only	c
chance	c
is	i
go	i
there	i
in	c
July	c
,	i
it	i
does	i
not	i
matter	i
the	i
dates	i
,	c
but	c
it	c
is	c
important	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
be	c
back	c
before	c
the	c
1st	c
of	c
August	c
,	c
because	c
that	c
day	c
I	c
will	c
start	c
a	c
summer	c
job	c
.	c

About	c
he	i
acommodation	i
during	c
those	c
two	c
weeks	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
rather	c
staying	i
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
,	c
as	c
it	c
is	c
really	c
difficult	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
be	i
in	c
a	c
little	c
and	i
close	i
room	c
.	c

Your	c
next	c
question	c
is	c
about	c
the	c
activities	c
that	c
I	c
could	c
do	c
at	c
the	c
camp	c
,	i
after	i
browse	i
through	c
the	c
list	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
take	c
part	c
in	c
climbing	c
and	c
photography	i
activities	c
,	c
as	c
these	c
are	c
my	c
favourite	c
hobbies	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
I	c
had	i
a	c
photography	c
course	c
five	c
years	c
ago	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
took	c
part	c
in	c
several	c
competitions	c
.	c

Can	c
we	c
get	c
there	c
by	c
public	c
transport	c
?	c

Looking	c
forward	c
for	i
your	c
answer	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Going	c
out	c
to	c
spend	c
a	c
day	c
shopping	c
is	c
something	c
very	c
popular	c
,	i
the	i
shopping	c
centers	i
are	c
always	c
busy	c
,	c
people	i
going	c
up	c
and	c
down	c
carrying	c
bags	c
and	c
looking	c
at	i
window	i
shops	i
,	i
seems	i
everbody	i
is	c
happy	c
.	c

Sometimes	c
things	c
can	c
be	i
wrong	c
and	c
the	c
situations	i
changes	c
and	c
becomes	c
a	c
nightmare	c
.	c

Firstly	c
is	i
the	c
parking	c
problem	c
,	i
if	i
you	c
go	c
to	i
shopping	c
late	c
at	c
weekends	c
for	c
instance	c
,	c
it	c
's	c
really	c
difficult	c
to	c
find	c
a	c
place	c
to	c
park	c
your	c
car	c
,	c
and	c
when	c
you	c
get	c
the	i
place	c
,	c
pay	i
for	c
it	c
!	c

Finally	c
you	c
've	c
found	c
out	i
something	c
really	c
wonderful	c
,	i
time	c
to	c
pay	c
!	c

With	i
the	c
hurries	i
you	c
've	c
forgotten	c
to	c
bring	c
any	c
cash	c
,	c
but	c
you	c
can	c
use	c
the	i
plastic	c
money	c
,	i
the	i
shop	c
assistant	c
pass	i
the	c
credit	c
card	c
through	c
the	c
machine	c
,	c
after	c
few	i
seconds	c
again	i
,	c
and	c
another	i
time	c
more	i
,	i
suddenly	i
his	c
face	c
changes	c
and	c
says	i
you	c
that	c
the	c
card	c
is	c
fault	i
!	c

No	c
choice	c
,	i
you	c
have	c
to	c
leave	c
your	c
nice	c
clothes	c
and	c
go	c
away	c
feeling	c
bad	c
and	c
sad	c
.	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
,	c
but	c
do	c
n't	c
worry	c
,	c
the	c
shooping	i
center	i
still	i
there	c
waiting	c
for	c
you	c
!	c

I	c
'm	c
really	c
good	c
at	c
Golf	c
and	c
Tennis	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
choose	c
these	c
two	c
activities	c
.	c

I	c
've	c
been	c
doing	c
these	c
activities	c
for	c
a	c
very	c
long	c
time	c
.	c

I	c
've	c
been	c
playing	c
tannis	i
since	c
I	c
was	c
seven	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
've	c
been	c
studying	c
how	c
to	c
play	c
tannis	i
for	c
a	c
very	c
long	c
time	c
,	c
nine	c
years	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
cloths	i
do	i
I	c
need	c
to	c
take	c
with	c
me	c
,	c
and	c
can	c
you	c
write	c
me	i
back	i
what	i
kind	c
of	c
weather	c
it	i
's	i
going	i
to	i
be	i
there	c
,	c
for	c
the	c
time	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
staying	c
there	c
.	c

Also	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
should	i
I	i
take	c
with	c
me	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
'm	c
not	c
sure	c
how	c
much	c
I	c
'll	c
need	c
to	c
spend	c
there	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

I	c
know	c
you	c
want	c
to	c
learn	i
what	c
I	c
did	c
and	c
how	c
I	c
helped	c
people	c
at	c
the	c
pop	c
concert	c
last	c
month	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
know	c
,	c
our	c
college	c
was	c
chosen	c
to	c
be	c
there	c
and	c
help	c
the	c
singers	c
and	c
the	c
musicians	c
out	c
.	c

My	c
friends	c
and	c
I	c
have	i
been	i
taken	c
to	i
the	i
backstage	c
where	c
we	c
met	c
the	c
members	c
of	c
West	c
Life	c
,	c
Elton	c
John	c
and	c
Robie	c
Williams	c
.	c

What	c
we	c
all	c
did	c
was	c
making	i
many	c
cups	c
of	c
coffees	i
and	c
help	c
to	c
find	c
their	c
missing	c
socks	c
or	c
any	c
other	c
clothings	i
.	c

What	c
I	c
realised	c
was	c
they	c
were	c
not	c
different	c
from	c
any	c
of	c
us	c
but	c
they	c
were	c
called	c
celebreties	i
.	c

I	c
particularly	c
liked	c
listening	c
their	i
musicians	c
when	c
they	c
played	c
the	c
piano	c
,	c
clarinet	c
,	c
drums	c
,	c
violen	i
etc.	i
Which	i
was	c
unbelievably	i
great	c
and	i
also	c
to	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
meet	c
these	c
famous	c
singers	c
made	c
me	c
realise	c
we	c
can	c
achieve	c
whatever	c
we	c
want	c
.	c

Lots	c
of	c
love	c

To	c
the	c
manager	c

London	c

Dear	c
sir	c
,	c

Besides	c
this	c
,	c
no	c
discounts	c
for	c
students	c
were	c
available	c
.	c

This	c
show	c
might	c
be	c
the	c
newest	c
in	c
London	c
,	c
but	c
not	i
the	i
best	i
at	i
all	i
.	c

I	i
do	i
eventually	i
think	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
fair	c
to	c
give	c
the	c
spectators	i
their	c
money	c
back	c
-	c
So	i
ask	i
you	c
a	i
complete	c
refund	c
(	c
cash	c
)	c
of	c
the	c
ticket	c
price	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

Their	c
parents	c
were	c
so	c
happy	c
that	c
decided	i
to	c
give	c
him	c
a	c
fantastic	c
present	c
:	c
the	c
brand	c
new	c
car	c
he	c
had	c
always	c
dreamed	c
of	c
.	c

This	c
should	c
be	i
a	c
big	c
surprise	c
for	c
him	c
:	c
the	c
car	c
was	c
bought	c
and	c
everything	c
was	c
prepared	c
in	c
a	c
very	c
hush-hush	c
atmosphere	c
.	c

Can	c
you	c
imagine	c
Philip	c
's	c
face	c
when	c
he	i
'll	i
see	i
his	c
favourite	c
car	c
out	c
there	c
?	c
"	c

The	c
car	c
was	c
already	c
parked	c
near	c
the	c
rear	c
door	c
and	c
there	c
was	c
an	c
unusual	c
activity	i
all	c
over	c
the	c
house	c
.	c

I	c
've	c
been	c
thrilled	c
eversince	i
I	c
received	c
your	c
letter	c
indicating	c
my	c
luck	c
of	c
having	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
the	c
competition	c
that	c
you	c
organized	c
recently	c
.	c

Among	c
the	c
numerous	c
choices	c
of	c
activities	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
considering	c
taking	c
those	c
of	c
golf	c
and	c
surfing	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
been	c
playing	c
golf	c
since	c
the	c
age	c
of	c
8	c
,	c
therefore	c
I	c
am	c
certain	c
that	c
I	c
will	c
not	c
require	c
help	c
of	c
any	c
sort	c
.	c

Lastly	c
,	c
I	c
've	c
been	c
struggling	c
with	c
the	c
question	c
of	c
money	c
and	c
clothing	c
and	c
would	c
lie	i
to	c
be	c
informed	c
about	c
the	c
climate	c
there	c
so	c
that	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
pack	c
the	c
clothes	c
that	c
I	c
need	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
be	c
thankful	c
if	c
you	c
would	c
consider	c
sending	c
me	c
an	c
estimation	c
of	c
amount	i
of	c
money	c
I	c
will	c
have	c
spend	i
in	c
the	c
camp	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
in	c
advance	c

June	c

2000	c

I	c
was	c
glad	c
to	c
receive	c
your	i
letter	c
from	c
you	c
and	c
after	c
having	c
heard	c
that	c
you	c
are	c
interested	c
in	c
helping	c
pop	c
singers	c
have	c
a	c
concert	c
,	c
I	c
started	c
writing	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
I	c
could	c
.	c

I	c
thin	i
it	c
's	c
a	c
wonderful	c
idea	c
and	c
my	c
advice	c
is	c
to	c
take	c
it	c
if	c
you	c
have	c
an	c
offer	c
!	c

At	c
first	c
,	c
they	c
asked	c
me	c
to	c
decorate	c
the	c
stage	c
since	c
I	c
like	c
drawing	c
,	c
but	c
as	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
get	c
more	c
involved	c
,	c
they	c
said	c
that	c
I	c
could	c
also	c
help	c
them	c
set	c
up	c
the	c
lights	c
,	c
the	c
microphones	c
and	c
the	c
instruments	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
to	c
admit	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
always	c
easy	c
,	c
but	c
my	c
effort	c
was	c
worth	c
every	c
penny	c
.	c

The	c
concert	c
was	c
a	c
hit	c
and	c
the	c
stage	c
looked	c
fabulous	c
!	c

I	c
'm	c
not	c
sure	c
of	i
what	c
part	c
you	c
're	c
interested	c
in	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
think	c
drawing	c
the	c
background	c
for	c
the	c
stage	c
was	c
the	c
best	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
suggest	c
that	c
you	c
try	c
doing	c
it	c
too	c
.	c

Lots	c
and	c
lots	c
of	c
kisses	c
,	c

Regina	c

Dear	c
sir	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
draw	c
your	c
attention	c
to	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
that	c
was	i
place	c
last	i
evening	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
while	c
the	c
advertisment	i
said	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
going	c
to	c
begin	c
at	c
19:30	c
.	c

To	c
make	c
matters	c
worse	c
,	c
when	c
the	c
show	c
finished	c
we	c
could	c
n't	c
visit	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
fact	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
(	c
since	c
it	c
was	c
being	c
painted	c
)	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
surprised	c
that	c
such	c
a	c
reputable	c
theatre	c
like	c
yours	c
has	c
been	c
able	c
to	c
break	c
all	c
promises	i
that	c
appeared	i
in	c
the	c
advertisment	i
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

What	c
will	c
clothes	c
be	c
like	c
100	c
years	c
from	c
now	c
?	c

I	c
imagine	c
it	i
will	c
be	c
very	c
different	c
.	c

Sciencist	i
will	c
invented	i
new	c
materials	c
that	c
will	c
keep	c
the	c
temperature	i
in	c
a	c
suitable	c
range	c
.	c

As	i
well	i
,	c
people	c
wo	c
n't	c
be	c
as	c
worried	c
about	c
fashion	c
as	c
nowaday	i
,	c
however	c
it	i
will	c
be	c
very	c
important	c
that	c
clothes	c
are	c
comfortable	c
and	c
suitable	c
for	c
your	c
work	c
and	c
daily	c
duties	c
as	c
well	c
as	c
sport	c
or	i
everything	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
do	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

I	c
also	c
want	c
to	c
put	c
the	c
stress	i
on	c
the	c
fact	c
that	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
at	c
8.15	c
pm	c
instead	c
of	c
beginning	c
at	c
7.30	c
pm.	c
It	c
is	i
a	i
really	c
a	c
shame	c
!	c

And	c
,	c
we	c
were	c
not	c
allowed	c
to	c
visit	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
in	i
so	i
far	i
as	i
it	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

Consequently	c
I	c
ask	c
you	c
for	c
some	c
money	c
back	c
seeing	i
that	c
I	c
think	c
:	c
it	i
's	i
not	i
worth	i
the	i
bother	i
to	c
loose	i
money	c
for	c
such	c
a	c
show.	c
,	c

Thank	c
you	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
modern	c
technology	c
change	i
my	c
daily	c
life	c
.	c

Indeed	c
,	c
daily	c
life	c
is	c
easier	c
thanks	c
to	c
technology	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
if	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
buy	c
something	c
,	c
I	c
have	i
to	i
go	i
on	c
my	c
computer	c
and	c
buy	c
it	c
.	c

But	c
it	c
will	c
make	c
me	c
lazy	c
.	c

Indeed	c
,	c
when	c
you	c
want	c
to	c
buy	c
a	c
television	c
,	c
for	c
example	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
different	c
marks	i
.	c

And	c
it	c
's	c
all	c
the	c
more	c
tyring	i
since	c
you	c
often	c
wait	c
during	i
two	c
weeks	c
before	c
buying	i
it	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
bound	c
to	c
feel	c
nervous	i
.	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
very	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
so	c
I	c
ask	c
for	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

The	c
first	c
problem	c
we	c
had	c
was	c
that	c
the	c
discounts	c
announced	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
were	c
not	c
available	c
and	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
pay	c
the	c
full	c
ticket	i
.	c

Finally	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
all	c
these	c
problems	c
could	c
have	c
been	c
avoided	c
and	c
that	c
asking	c
my	i
money	c
back	c
is	c
the	c
best	c
way	c
of	c
forgetting	c
that	c
evening	c
.	c

People	c
have	c
always	c
looked	c
for	c
the	c
most	c
comfortable	c
clothes	c
for	c
they	i
daily	c
life	i
.	c

We	c
tend	c
to	c
a	i
society	c
that	c
wants	c
more	c
free	c
time	c
so	c
people	c
will	c
need	c
more	c
comfortable	c
clothes	c
to	c
enjoy	c
it	c
.	c

Another	c
important	c
thing	c
will	c
be	c
the	c
use	c
of	c
technology	c
.	c

Fashion	c
reflects	c
the	c
way	c
we	c
live	c
so	c
we	c
can	c
expect	c
that	c
fashion	c
will	c
be	c
connected	c
with	i
technology	c
and	c
society	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Jane	i
Clark	c
,	c

The	c
International	c
Arts	c
Festival	c
is	c
a	c
beautiful	i
idea	c
.	c

I	c
enjoyed	c
most	c
of	c
the	c
events	c
and	c
I	c
found	c
your	c
prices	c
excellent	c
considering	i
that	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
student	c
and	c
that	c
I	c
do	c
not	c
have	c
much	c
money	c
.	c

In	c
your	c
advertisment	i
you	c
mentionned	i
that	c
there	c
is	i
artists	c
and	c
stars	c
from	i
all	i
around	i
the	i
world	i
coming	i
,	c
unfortunately	c
I	c
found	c
out	c
only	c
six	c
countries	c
were	c
represented	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
suggest	c
that	c
more	c
countries	c
should	c
be	c
part	c
of	c
the	c
Festival	i
if	c
it	c
is	c
possible	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
a	c
very	c
good	c
opportunity	c
to	c
listen	c
to	c
different	c
kind	i
of	c
music	c
and	c
to	c
discover	c
different	c
culture	i
.	c

Hoping	c
that	c
I	c
did	i
not	i
offend	i
you	c
in	c
any	c
ways	i
and	c
that	c
you	c
might	c
take	c
in	i
consideration	c
my	c
suggestion	i
,	c
I	c
wish	c
you	c
all	c
the	c
best	c
for	c
next	c
year	c
's	c
festival	c

Only	c
the	c
one	i
who	c
knew	c
how	c
to	c
read	c
stars	c
could	c
actually	c
tell	c
that	c
a	c
great	c
king	c
was	i
born	c
.	c

When	c
the	c
three	c
men	c
saw	c
him	c
they	i
fell	c
on	c
their	c
knees	c
to	c
worship	c
him	c
.	c

The	c
mother	c
was	c
pride	i
because	c
she	c
knew	c
he	c
was	c
sent	c
from	c
above	c
and	c
he	c
was	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
the	c
one	c
to	c
set	c
people	c
free	c
from	c
their	c
sins	c
.	c

This	c
little	c
man	c
from	c
Israel	c
died	c
as	c
the	c
hero	i
of	c
all	c
times	c
.	c

His	c
message	c
is	c
still	c
as	c
impacting	i
today	c
and	c
will	c
always	c
be	c
even	i
if	c
this	c
story	c
happened	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
ago	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
musical	c
'	c
OVER	c
THE	c
RAINBOW	c
'	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
could	c
not	c
get	c
them	c
.	c

To	c
make	c
matters	c
worse	c
,	c
it	i
was	i
the	i
different	i
actor	i
although	i
Danny	i
Brook	i
should	i
have	i
starred	i
.	c

I	c
was	c
really	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
seeing	c
his	c
role	i
,	c
but	c
on	i
starting	i
the	i
show	i
,	c
I	c
found	c
it	c
disappointed	i
.	c

Can	c
you	c
imagine	c
how	c
upset	c
I	c
was	c
?	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
to	c
give	i
some	i
money	i
back	i
to	i
me	i
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
receiving	c
your	i
satisfactory	c
reply	c
by	c
return	c
of	c
post	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
modern	c
technology	c
has	c
changed	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
greatly	i
.	c

When	c
I	c
meet	c
my	c
friends	c
somewhere	c
but	c
cannot	c
arrive	c
there	c
on	c
time	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
tell	c
them	c
about	c
it	c
with	i
the	c
phone	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
when	c
I	c
do	c
not	c
want	c
anybody	c
to	c
disturb	c
my	i
time	i
,	c
the	c
phone	c
annoys	c
me	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
as	c
far	c
as	c
I	c
am	c
concerned	c
,	c
the	c
computer	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
invention	c
.	c

With	c
internet	i
and	c
E-mail	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
get	c
lots	c
of	c
information	c
from	c
everywhere	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
can	c
get	c
in	c
touch	c
with	c
my	c
friends	c
who	c
live	c
in	i
abroad	c
.	c

Since	c
I	c
bought	c
a	c
computer	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
checking	c
E-mails	i
from	c
my	c
friend	c
almost	c
every	c
day	c

Finding	i
them	i
,	c
I	c
feel	c
happy	c
even	c
if	c
there	c
is	c
only	c
one	c
.	c

On	c
balance	c
then	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
modern	c
technology	c
really	c
affects	c
my	c
life	c
even	c
though	c
I	c
feel	c
that	c
it	c
improves	i

17th	c
June	c
2000	c

Last	c
week	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
on	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
,	c
and	c
reading	i
the	c
advertisement	c
for	c
your	c
musical	c
show	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
planned	c
(	c
like	i
it	c
is	i
said	c
)	c
"	c
a	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
"	c
.	c

But	c
it	i
turned	c
out	c
,	c
it	c
really	c
was	c
n't	c
a	c
pleasant	c
evening	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
enjoy	c
myself	c
.	c

The	c
tickets	c
were	c
rather	c
expensive	c
,	c
and	c
the	c
discounts	c
mentionned	i
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
were	c
n't	c
at	c
all	c
available	c
at	c
the	c
theatre	c
.	c

They	c
had	c
never	c
heard	c
of	c
such	c
a	c
thing	c
!	c

The	c
actors	c
were	c
not	c
the	c
ones	c
expected	c
:	c
there	c
was	c
no	c
sign	c
of	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
and	c
the	c
person	c
who	c
played	c
his	c
part	c
was	c
very	c
disappointing	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Pat	c
was	c
my	c
friend	c
,	c
I	c
trusted	c
her	c
and	c
we	c
got	c
on	c
very	c
well	c
untill	i
she	c
had	i
repeated	i
to	c
everyone	c
the	c
secret	c
I	c
had	c
told	c
her	c
.	c

No	c
one	c
knew	c
apart	c
from	c
me	c
and	c
my	c
mother	c
.	c

I	c
kept	c
lying	c
when	c
somebody	c
asked	c
where	c
my	c
dad	c
was	c
.	c

But	c
know	i
Pat	c
knew	c
,	c
and	c
because	c
of	c
her	c
,	c
so	c
did	c
everyone	c
else	c
:	c
he	c
was	c
in	c
prison	c
because	c
he	c
had	c
killed	c
a	c
man	c
.	c

Since	c
everyone	c
knew	c
the	c
truth	c
,	c
things	c
were	c
n't	c
the	c
same	c
.	c

Everyone	c
,	c
even	c
my	c
friends	c
,	c
looked	c
at	c
me	c
in	c
a	c
strange	c
kind	c
of	c
way	c
.	c

What	c
did	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
do	c
with	c
this	c
?	c

I	c
was	c
n't	c
the	c
one	c
who	c
had	c
killed	c
the	c
man	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
seemed	c
people	c
did	c
n't	c
want	c
to	c
talk	c
to	c
me	c
anymore	c
.	c

I	c
knew	i
,	c
now	c
,	c
why	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
hide	c
the	c
truth	c
.	c

in	c
your	c

California	c

U.S.A	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
this	c
year	c
because	c
I	c
think	c
the	c
weather	c
will	c
be	c
nice	c
and	c
I	c
can	c
take	c
a	c
holiday	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
more	c
interesting	c
than	c
log	i
cabins	i
.	c

I	c
can	c
be	c
more	i
next	i
nuture	i
and	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
used	c

before	c

I	c
choose	c
swimming	c
and	c
painting	c
for	c
my	c
activities	c
while	c
I	c
am	c
at	c
the	c
Camp	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
child	c
,	c
I	c
used	c
to	c
go	c
swimming	c
with	c
my	c
family	c
at	c
the	c
weekend	c
having	i
a	c
chat	c
,	c
making	c
a	c
barbecue	c
,	c
playing	c
games	c

It	c
was	c
such	c
a	c
good	c
time	c
.	c

Could	c
I	c
ask	c
you	c
some	c
questions	c
?	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
which	i
kind	c
of	c

that	c
I	c

a	c
long	c

I	c

the	c
final	c
exam	c
next	c
month	c
.	c

Lucky	c
me	c
!	c

Last	c
month	c
,	c
I	c
worked	i
as	i
a	c
part-time	c
job	c
.	c

I	c
really	c
enjoyed	c
helping	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
such	c
a	c
big	c
concert	c
.	c

There	c
were	c
lots	c
of	c
singers	c
and	c
band	i
.	c

Of	c
course	c
,	c
there	c
were	c
lots	c
of	c
spectaculars	i
.	c

I	c
was	c
really	c
exciting	i
.	c

After	c
that	c
,	c
I	c
went	c
to	i
the	i
back	c
stage	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
see	c
lots	c
of	c
pop	c
stars	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
sorry	c
that	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
ask	c
them	i
to	i
take	i
any	i
pictures	i
for	c
you	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
to	c
take	c
care	c
of	c
them	c
and	c
did	c
everything	c
they	c
want	i
.	c

It	c
was	c
really	c
busy	c
but	c
I	c
really	c
enjoyed	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
learnt	c
lots	c
of	c
thing	c
from	i
here	i
that	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
learn	c
from	c
school	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
to	c
be	c
more	c
patient	c
.	c

I	c
knew	i
lots	c
of	c
people	c
from	i
different	c
job	i
.	c

I	c
'd	c
better	c
close	c
now	c
.	c

I	c
've	c
got	c
lots	c
of	c
homework	c
to	c
do	c
.	c

Take	c
care	c
of	c
yourself	c
and	c
I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c

Best	c
wishes	c
,	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
after	c
visiting	c
your	c
theatre	c
.	c

Frankly	c
speaking	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
disappointed	c
after	c
my	c
visit	c
.	c

But	c
nevertheless	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
your	c
show	c
.	c

The	c
show	c
started	c
t	i
20.15	c
instead	c
of	c
19.30	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
to	c
wait	c
in	c
overcrowded	i
hall	c
.	c

When	c
finally	i
the	i
show	i
had	i
started	i
I	c
found	c
out	c
that	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
was	i
replaced	i
by	c
another	c
actor	c
.	c

One	c
of	c
the	c
reasons	c
for	c
my	c
visiting	c
your	c
show	c
was	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
's	c
participance	i
.	c

So	c
,	c
you	c
could	c
understand	c
how	c
disappointed	c
I	c
was	c
.	c

To	c
make	c
matters	c
worse	c
the	i
restaurant	c
which	c
was	c
mentioned	c
in	c
your	c
advertisment	i
was	c
closed	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
had	i
n't	i
such	c
perfect	i
evening	c
,	i
as	c
was	c
promised	c
in	c
your	c
advertisment	i
.	c

In	c
fact	c
there	c
were	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
mistakes	c
in	c
your	c
advertisment	i
and	c
I	c
would	c
be	c
gratefull	i
if	c
you	c
could	c
give	c
me	c
back	c
a	c
part	c
of	c
my	c
money	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

How	c
has	c
modern	c
technology	c
changed	c
your	c
daily	c
life	c
?	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
modern	c
technologies	c
play	c
the	i
important	c
role	c
in	c
people	c
's	c
life	i
.	c

Both	c
computer	i
and	c
Internet	i
influence	c
people	c
's	c
life	i
.	c

I	c
have	c
to	c
use	c
computer	i
every	c
day	c
.	c

It	c
helps	c
me	c
in	i
preparing	c
my	c
homeworks	i
.	c

With	c
the	c
help	c
of	c
Internet	i
technologies	c
I	c
communicate	c
with	c
other	c
people	c
from	c
all	c
over	c
the	c
world	c
it	c
gives	c
me	c
chance	i
to	c
improve	c
my	c
English	c
.	c

From	i
my	i
point	i
of	i
view	i
,	c
Internet	i
can	c
be	c
used	c
in	c
education	c
,	c
because	c
it	c
gives	c
an	c
opportunity	c
to	c
have	c
distant	i
relations	i
between	c
pupils	c
and	c
teachers	c
.	c

Though	c
Internet	i
has	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
positive	c
aspects	c
I	i
think	c
you	c
should	c
be	c
careful	c
with	c
it	c
and	c
not	c
to	i
be	i
depended	i
on	c
it	c
.	c

Dear	c
Jane	c
Clark	c

My	c
name	c
is	c
Yuna	c
Kimber	c
who	c
attended	c
this	c
annual	c
International	c
Arts	c
Festival	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
appreicate	i
you	c
for	c
organizing	c
such	c
an	c
exciting	c
festival	c
.	c

By	c
the	c
way	c
,	c
according	c
to	c
the	c
advertisement	c
,	c
lots	c
of	c
stars	c
and	c
artists	c
from	c
around	c
the	c
world	c
were	c
supposed	c
to	c
be	c
invited	c
for	c
the	c
festival	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
was	c
able	c
to	c
meet	c
them	c
just	i
from	c
only	c
six	c
countries	c
.	c

And	c
another	c
thing	c
is	c
that	c
some	c
concert	c
halls	c
were	c
too	c
small	c
,	c
so	c
when	c
I	c
went	c
there	c
for	c
Jazz	c
and	c
rock	c
concerts	c
it	c
was	c
so	c
crowded	c
,	c
and	c
during	c
the	c
concerts	c
people	c
felt	c
stuffy	i
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
'll	c
get	c
much	c
bigger	c
concerts	i
hall	i
next	c
year	c
.	c

I	c
expect	c
that	c
much	c
more	c
various	i
kinds	c
of	c
plays	c
and	c
films	c
will	c
be	c
on	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
brillient	c
,	c
because	c
if	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
pay	c
all	i
things	c
each	i
I	c
would	c
n't	c
have	c
attended	c
it	c
,	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
very	c
expensive	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
helpful	c
and	c
useful	c
for	c
you	c
.	c

Bye	c
for	c
now	c

Long	i
time	c
ago	c
,	c
there	c
were	c
two	c
brothers	c
,	c
whose	c
parents	c
were	c
dead	c
.	c

By	c
the	c
way	c
,	c
the	c
elder	c
brother	c
,	c
Nolbu	c
was	c
a	c
so	i
greedy	c
man	c
.	c

He	c
did	c
n't	c
want	c
to	c
share	c
the	c
money	c
with	c
his	c
brother	c
,	c
Hungbu	c
so	i
he	c
took	c
all	c
of	c
the	c
money	c
,	c
and	c
said	c
to	c
Hungbu	c
to	c
go	c
away	c
from	c
the	c
house	c
without	c
anything	c
.	c

Hungbu	c
had	c
nothing	c
but	c
his	c
twelve	i
family	i
.	c

But	c
,	c
even	c
if	c
he	c
was	c
so	i
poor	c
,	c
he	c
was	c
so	i
good	c
and	c
had	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
affection	c
about	i
the	c
people	c
who	c
were	c
much	c
poorer	c
than	c
his	c
family	c
,	c
so	c
he	c
looked	c
after	c
them	c
.	c

One	c
cold	c
day	c
,	c
Hungbu	c
saw	c
a	c
bird	c
that	c
had	c
a	c
broken	c
wing	c
,	c
so	c
the	c
bird	c
could	c
n't	c
fly	c
to	c
the	c
warmer	c
county	i
during	c
the	c
winter	c
.	c

He	c
cured	c
the	c
bird	c
to	i
fly	i
with	c
love	c
,	c
and	c
the	c
bird	c
was	c
able	c
to	c
fly	c
.	c

The	c
following	c
year	c
,	c
when	c
the	c
bird	c
returned	c
his	i
house	c
,	c
he	c
gave	c
him	c
a	c
message	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
kind	c
of	c
map	c
that	c
showed	c
the	c
place	i
for	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
money	c
which	c
robbers	c
hid	c
.	c

Therefore	c
,	c
Hungbu	c
became	c
much	c
richer	c
than	c
Nolbu	c
,	c
and	c
he	c
lived	c
happily	c
with	c
the	c
money	c
helping	c
the	c
poor	c
.	c

This	c
story	c
happened	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
ago	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
seen	c
your	c
new	c
musical	c
,	c
'	c
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
'	c
.	c

So	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
keep	c
myself	c
occupied	c
for	c
a	c
while	c
,	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
restaurant	c
except	i
it	c
was	c
n't	c
open	c
.	c

No	c
one	c
.	c

The	c
show	c
it	i
self	i
was	c
quite	c
disappointing	c
.	c

The	c
show	c
was	c
OK	c
though	c
I	c
suggest	c
you	c
hire	c
different	c
actors	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
does	c
n't	c
suit	c
the	c
role	c
he	c
plays	c
in	c
this	c
musical	c
...	c

Also	c
you	c
mentioned	c
a	c
discount	c
.	c

For	c
tickets	c
.	c

Well	c
no	c
,	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
get	c
a	c
discount	c
!	c

And	c
the	c
tickets	c
were	c
pretty	c
expensive	c
...	c

Anyway	c
,	c
after	c
watching	c
the	c
musical	c
,	c
I	c
felt	c
a	c
bit	c
peckish	c
so	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
restaurant	c
again	c
with	c
hope	i
that	c
it	c
might	c
be	c
open	c
,	c
but	c
still	c
,	c
nobody	c
was	c
in	c
.	c

They	c
had	c
been	c
closed	c
for	c
3	c
days	c
according	c
to	c
him	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
pleasant	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
am	c
going	c
to	c
ask	c
for	c
a	c
refund	c

I	c
hope	c
this	c
is	c
n't	c
affending	i
you	c
too	c
much	c
...	c

Reply	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c
,	c

best	c
regards	c
,	c

Just	c
like	c
sweaters	c
,	c
shoes	c
,	c
t-shirts	c
etc	c
...	c

When	c
it	c
comes	c
down	c
to	c
color	i
,	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
'll	c
be	c
much	c
brighter	c
and	c
maybe	c
glittery	c
.	c

As	c
well	c
as	c
bright	c
yellow	c
,	c
orange	c
and	c
green	c
.	c

Shoes	c
will	c
be	c
high	c
heeled	c
and	c
modern	c
.	c

Colors	i
to	c
match	c
the	c
clothes	c
.	c

Still	c
,	c
comfortable	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
think	c
I	c
prefer	c
the	c
clothes	c
now	c
.	c

I	c
'll	c
stick	c
to	c
baggy	c
t-shirts	c
,	c
jeans	c
,	c
baseball	c
caps	c
and	c
trainers	c
.	c

They	c
'll	c
do	c
for	c
me	c
instead	c
of	c
all	c
the	c
silvers	c
and	c
golds	c
.	c

I	c
mean	c
,	c
I	c
wo	c
n't	c
get	c
sick	c
in	i
them	c
!	c

Though	c
some	c
people	c
may	c
fancy	c
the	c
glitter	c
and	c
the	c
spacy	c
feel	c
,	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
like	c
it	c
and	c
I	c
hope	c
it	c
really	c
is	c
n't	c
the	c
style	c
for	c
the	c
future	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
I	i
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
the	i
perfect	i
organisation	i
of	i
the	c
competition	c
which	c
I	c
luckely	i
won	c
,	i
I	c
have	c
been	c
really	c
very	c
impressed	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
I	c
became	i
your	c
letter	c
with	i
two	c
weeks	c
late	c
so	c
I	c
can	c
travel	c
only	c
between	c
the	c
5th	c
and	c
the	c
20th	c
July	c
.	c

In	c
fact	c
I	c
will	c
finish	c
my	c
university	i
's	i
exams	c
only	c
on	c
the	c
first	c
July	i
and	c
after	c
the	c
20th	c
is	i
impossible	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
going	c
to	c
do	c
four	c
weeks	i
volontary	i
in	i
India	c
for	c
UNICEF	c
.	c

If	c
it	c
is	c
possible	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
log	i
cabins	i
,	c
because	c
,	c
in	c
spite	c
of	c
my	c
love	c
for	c
nature	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
terribly	c
allergic	c
to	c
pollins	i
.	c

So	c
stay	i
in	c
a	c
log	i
cabins	i
will	c
probably	c
evite	i
me	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
problems	c
.	c

Choose	i
two	c
activities	c
from	c
the	c
list	c
has	c
been	c
very	c
difficult	c
but	c
I	c
think	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
do	c
climbing	c
,	c
sport	i
in	c
which	c
I	c
have	c
many	c
years	c
of	c
experience	c
,	c
and	c
surfing	c
despite	i
I	i
really	i
have	i
any	i
experience	i
.	c

If	c
you	c
ask	c
at	i
twenty	c
womans	i
what	c
is	i
their	i
favorite	i
hobbies	i
probably	c
the	i
most	c
of	c
them	c
will	c
answer	c
"	c
shopping	c
"	c
.	c

We	c
are	c
always	c
trying	c
to	c
have	c
more	c
things	c
,	c
that	i
in	i
spite	i
of	i
care	i
after	i
us	i
family	c
,	c
us	i
future	c
,	c
or	i
other	c
things	c
which	c
are	c
probably	c
more	c
important	c
than	c
a	c
new	c
perfum	i
.	c

In	c
fact	c
if	c
you	c
have	c
the	c
new	c
Kalvin	c
Klein	c
model	i
for	i
a	c
certain	c
kind	c
of	c
people	i
you	c
are	c
cool	c
,	c
but	c
it	i
is	i
really	c
so	c
important	c
?	c

Probably	c
when	c
Oscar	c
Wilde	c
said	c
:	c
"	c
Superficiality	c
is	c
the	c
suprem	i
vice	c
"	c
he	c
was	c
right	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
this	c
letter	c
to	c
make	i
you	c
know	c
the	i
bad	c
points	c
of	c
the	c
theatre	c
.	c

First	c
,	c
it	c
did	c
n't	c
start	c
at	c
19.30	c
.	c

I	c
got	c
bored	c
.	c

Not	c
only	c
me	c
but	c
also	c
the	c
others	c
got	c
bored	c
.	c

If	c
there	c
had	c
been	c
a	c
problem	c
,	c
it	i
would	i
have	i
been	i
told	i
us	i
.	c

I	c
paid	c
Â£	c
20	c
to	c
the	c
cashier	c
.	c

But	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
without	c
any	c
reason	c
.	c

For	c
this	c
,	c
I	c
want	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

Because	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
enjoy	c
at	i
the	c
theatre	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
would	i
not	i
continue	i
like	c
this	c
.	c

TECHNOLOGICAL	c
ADVANTAGES	c

Technology	c
is	c
in	c
every	c
part	c
of	c
our	c
life	c
.	c

We	c
use	c
cars	c
,	c
trains	c
,	c
ships	c
or	c
planes	c
when	c
we	c
want	c
to	c
go	c
somewhere	c
.	c

With	c
the	c
help	c
of	c
technology	c
,	c
we	c
do	c
our	c
works	i
in	c
less	c
time	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
;	i
in	c
the	c
past	c
people	i
used	c
horses	c
to	c
go	c
another	i
place	c
.	c

And	c
their	c
life	c
passed	c
in	i
the	i
ways	i
.	c

But	c
now	c
we	c
use	c
planes	c
to	c
go	c
far	i
places	i
.	c

It	c
takes	c
less	c
time	c
than	c
going	c
by	c
horse	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
world	c
,	c
people	c
spend	c
the	c
whole	c
day	c
by	i
playing	c
computers	i
.	c

Not	c
only	c
as	c
a	c
hobby	c
.	c

They	c
use	c
computers	c
for	c
their	c
works	i
.	c

They	c
connect	i
with	c
other	c
businessmen	c
and	c
do	c
their	c
jobs	c
with	c
the	c
help	c
of	c
computers	c
.	c

Sometimes	c
they	c
do	c
n't	c
go	c
to	c
their	c
offices	c
.	c

They	c
write	c
their	c
secret	c
notes	c
into	i
the	i
computers	c
.	c

But	c
it	c
has	i
also	i
bad	c
points	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
;	i
wars	c
.	c

Using	c
technology	c
scientists	i
make	c
lots	c
of	c
powerful	c
guns	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
bad	c
for	c
the	i
world	i
's	i
piece	i
.	c

I	c
think	c
we	c
should	c
use	c
the	i
technology	c
for	c
the	i
piece	i
and	c
use	c
it	c
for	c
our	c
fortune	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
express	c
my	c
dissatisfaction	c
about	i
the	c
show	c
you	c
presented	i
two	c
weeks	c
ago	c
at	c
your	c
theatre	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
I	c
came	i
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
I	c
was	c
told	c
that	c
there	c
had	c
been	c
a	c
change	c
in	c
the	c
cast	c
and	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
was	c
not	c
part	c
of	c
it	c
anymore	c
.	c

You	c
cannot	c
imagine	c
our	c
disappointment	c
when	c
we	c
realised	c
that	c
the	c
show	c
had	c
been	c
posticipated	i
at	i
20.15	c
instead	c
of	c
19.30	c
and	c
that	c
the	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
of	c
restructuring	i
;	c
as	c
a	c
matter	c
of	c
fact	c
,	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
we	c
only	c
ate	c
an	i
hamburger	c
in	c
a	c
fast-food	c
.	i

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

In	c
fact	c
this	c
was	c
the	c
main	c
cause	i
of	i
Mr	c
White	c
's	c
resignation	c
and	c
suicide	c
.	c

Pat	c
was	c
not	c
a	c
very	c
clever	c
teen-ager	i
and	c
while	c
she	c
was	c
attending	c
the	i
Secondary	c
School	c
she	c
had	c
many	c
troubles	i
with	c
Chemistry	c
.	c

One	c
day	c
while	c
she	c
was	c
walking	c
in	c
Central	c
Park	c
she	c
saw	c
a	c
man	c
and	c
a	c
young	c
girl	c
sitting	c
under	c
a	c
tree	c
.	c

Immediately	c
she	c
recognized	c
her	c
beloved	c
teacher	c
kissing	c
one	c
of	c
her	c
class	i
mate	i
and	c
she	c
run	i
away	c
as	c
fast	c
as	c
she	c
could	c
.	c

She	c
was	c
so	c
angry	c
and	c
felt	c
so	c
betrayed	c
by	c
Mr	c
White	c
that	c
without	c
any	c
exitation	i
she	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
school	c
Headmaster	c
to	c
report	c
everything	c
she	c
had	c
seen	c
.	c

The	c
trial	c
was	c
long	c
and	c
had	i
a	i
wide	c
coverage	c
by	i
media	i

Dear	c
Sir	c

At	c
the	c
begining	i
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
You	c
for	c
Your	c
letter	c
-	c
it	c
pleased	c
me	c
much	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
always	c
dreamt	c
about	c
holidays	c
'	c
in	c
Camp	c
California	c
'	c

However	c
there	c
are	c
some	c
problems	c
that	c
I	c
hope	c
to	c
solve	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
the	c
only	c
suitable	c
time	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
go	c
is	c
July	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
the	c
only	c
time	c
when	c
I	c
am	c
free	c
from	c
my	c
duties	c
-	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
doctor	c
so	c
you	c
see	c
that	c
I	c
can	i
not	i
let	c
my	c
patients	c
down	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	i
You	i
to	i
know	i
also	i
about	c
my	c
two	c
hobbys	i
:	c
swimming	c
and	c
surfing	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
not	c
telling	i
about	c
some	c
kind	c
of	c
achivements	i
in	c
those	c
discipines	i
but	c
It	i
is	i
my	c
big	c
pasion	i

I	c
hope	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
chance	c
to	c
practice	i
both	c
of	c
theme	i
at	c
'	c
Camp	c
California	c
'	c
.	c

There	c
is	c
also	c
one	c
thing	c
that	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
You	i
about	c
.	c

The	c
question	c
is	c
:	c
Do	c
I	c
need	c
some	c
extra	c
money	c
and	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
should	c
I	c
take	c
for	c
this	c
trip	c
?	c

Anna	c
Nowak	c

It	c
's	c
like	c
,,walking	c
in	c
the	c
clouds	c
,	c
,	c
you	c
feel	c
like	c
flaing	i
.	c

Choosing	c
gave	i
me	c
such	c
big	i
pleasure	c
because	c
I	c
never	c
have	c
to	c
worry	c
from	i
vere	i
do	i
I	c
take	i
money	c
for	c
my	c
wishes	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
hard	c
for	c
me	c
even	c
to	c
emagine	i
the	i
situation	c
when	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

Everybody	c
know	i
that	c
,,present	c
presents	c
a	c
problem	c
''	c
You	c
know	c
your	c
own	c
task	i
but	c
what	c
vith	i
a	i
task	i
of	c
the	c
other	c
person	c
?	c

However	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
agree	c
with	c
opinion	i
that	c
,,Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
''	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
everybody	c
like	i
to	c
buy	c
but	c
not	c
everybody	c
like	i
to	c
see	i
pleasure	c
in	c
it	c

Dear	c
Mrs/Ms	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

My	c
name	c
is	c
Manuel	c
P.	c
Martinez	c
and	c
I	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
rather	c
than	c
in	c
tents	i
,	c
because	c
I	c
find	c
it	c
more	c
confortable	i
to	c
sleep	c
in	c
beds	i
,	c
but	c
it	c
would	c
n't	c
be	c
a	c
problem	c
if	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
sleep	c
in	c
tents	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
love	c
to	c
do	c
climbing	c
and	c
surfing	c
just	c
because	c
those	c
are	c
sports	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
praticed	i
before	c
,	i
that	i
means	c
I	c
do	c
not	c
have	c
any	c
experience	c
on	i
the	i
subject	i

2000	c
Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c
As	c
you	c
already	c
know	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
last	c
month	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
great	c
!	c

My	c
job	c
was	c
to	c
set	c
the	i
stage	c
where	c
the	c
bands	c
played	c
.	c

After	c
the	c
show	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
stay	c
and	c
clean	c
the	c
park	c
,	c
which	c
was	c
full	c
of	c
empty	c
cans	c
.	c

The	c
part	c
that	c
I	c
enjoyed	c
the	c
most	c
was	c
that	c
I	c
felt	c
I	c
was	c
doing	c
something	c
worthly	i
for	c
the	c
community	c
and	c
also	c
that	c
I	c
got	c
to	c
meet	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
people	c
.	c

I	c
made	c
great	c
friends	c
with	c
the	c
group	c
I	c
worked	c
with	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
great	c
experience	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
hope	c
we	c
will	c
organize	c
another	c
concert	c
soon	c
.	c

Best	c
wishes	c

I	c
have	c
never	c
used	c
it	i
and	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
more	c
exciting	c
than	c
tents	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
my	c
only	c
favorite	i
hobby	c
.	c

What	c
about	c
clothes	c
and	c
money	c
?	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
what	c
the	c
weather	c
is	c
like	c
,	c
and	c
you	c
are	c
paid	c
for	c
travel	c
costs	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
am	c
wondering	c
that	i
it	c
is	i
included	i
two	c
activities	c
.	c

Please	c
,	c
let	c
me	c
know	c
this	i
questions	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

Dear	c
Kim	c

I	c
am	c
sorry	c
.	c

To	c
reply	c
your	i
answer	i
,	c
it	c
was	c
realy	i
an	i
nice	c
experience	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
know	c
,	c
I	c
like	c
a	i
pop	c
music	c
so	c
much	c
and	c
singer	i
was	c
one	c
of	c
my	c
favorite	i
singers	c
.	c

Also	c
,	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
I	i
'll	i
want	i
to	c
be	c
an	c
organizer	c
like	c
this	i
concert	c
,	c
so	c
it	c
'll	c
be	c
useful	c
the	i
experience	c
to	i
me	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
how	i
I	c
got	c
the	c
position	c
and	c
what	c
I	c
did	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
applied	c
to	c
a	c
concert	c
agency	c
to	c
help	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
had	c
the	c
experience	c
before	c
and	c
I	c
knew	c
how	c
to	c
organize	c
and	c
what	c
to	c
do	c
.	c

In	i

I	c
cleaned	c
all	c
the	c

Sonya	c
Volavkova	c

Attituds	i
to	c
the	c
video	c
about	c
life	c
at	c
our	c
school	c

The	c
aim	c
of	c
this	c
report	c
is	c
to	c
summarize	c
the	c
pupil	c
's	c
attituds	i
about	i
video	i
they	c
have	c
to	c
be	i
made	i
and	c
to	c
suggest	c
which	c
lessons	c
and	c
other	c
activities	c
should	c
be	c
filmed	c
.	c

The	c
report	c
is	c
based	c
on	c
opinion	i
of	c
more	c
than	c
300	c
pupils	c
.	c

What	c
would	c
the	c
pupils	c
prefer	c
to	c
film	c
?	c

-	c
lessons	c
in	c
Mathematics	c
and	c
History	c
,	c
because	c
pupils	c
have	c
very	c
good	c
exam	i
's	i
result	i

-	c
competition	i
in	i
basketball	i

's	c
team	c
won	c
first	c

Also	c
they	c
would	c

Conclusion	c
:	c
It	c
is	c
clear	c
,	i
that	c
the	c
filming	i
of	c
video	i
is	c
very	i
important	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
in	c
response	c
to	c
your	c
letter	c
which	c
said	c
that	c
I	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
the	c
competition	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
be	c
pleased	c
if	c
I	c
could	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
as	c
I	c
already	c
booked	c
this	c
month	c
as	c
a	c
holiday	c
at	c
work	c
.	c

Besides	i
,	i
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
since	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
had	c
the	c
exciting	c
experience	c
to	i
sleep	i
in	i
the	i
middle	i
of	i
the	i
nature	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
I	c
am	c
really	c
keen	c
on	c
swimming	c
and	c
can	c
therefore	c
hardly	c
await	i
having	i
the	c
possibility	i
to	c
learn	c
the	c
butterfly	c
as	c
a	c
new	c
style	c
since	c
I	c
am	c
already	c
perfect	c
in	i
crawl	i
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

how	i
are	c
you	c
doing	c
?	c

Thanks	c
for	c
your	c
latest	c
letter	c
-	c
I	c
was	c
really	c
happy	c
about	c
your	c
news	c
!	c

Here	c
,	c
everything	c
is	c
as	c
usual	c
:	c
School	i
,	c
studying	c
,	c
eating	c
,	c
sleeping	c
-	c
but	c
did	c
I	c
tell	c
you	c
about	c
my	c
latest	c
job	c
?	c

I	c
helped	c
at	c
a	c
pop	i
concert	i
of	i
a	i
newcomer	i
group	i
and	c
you	c
ca	c
n't	c
imagine	c
how	c
exciting	c
it	c
was	c
!	c

I	c
really	c
had	c
butterflies	c
in	c
my	c
stomach	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
responsible	c
for	c
the	c
lightening	i
!	c

It	c
was	c
marvellous	c
!	c

But	c
the	c
cherry	c
on	c
the	c
cake	c
was	c
that	c
I	c
met	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
handsome	c
singers	c
back	i
stage	i
!	c

Of	c
course	c
I	c
agreed	c
-	c
I	c
would	c
n't	c
want	c
to	c
miss	c
the	c
chance	c
to	c
gain	c
experience	c
while	c
having	c
fun	c
!	c

Perhaps	c
I	c
could	c
help	c
regularly	c
in	c
the	c
lightening	i
area	c
-	c
it	c
would	c
help	c
me	c
for	i
my	c
studies	i
of	i
photography	i
.	c

What	c
do	c
you	c
reckon	c
?	c

I	c
can	c
hardly	c
await	i
your	c
reply	c

to	c
your	c

about	c
my	c
willing	i

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c

to	c

the	c
jury	c
for	c
chosen	i
my	c

from	c
all	c
the	c

Next	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
find	c
out	c
some	c
details	c
about	c
the	c
camp	c
.	c

If	c
I	c
had	c
known	c
that	c
I	c
won	i
,	c
I	c
would	c
not	c
have	c
arranged	c
my	c

.	c

You	c
mentioned	c
that	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
in	c
tents	c
or	c
log	c
cabins	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
close	c
to	c
the	i
nature	c
,	c
so	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
a	c

What	c

about	c
the	c
chance	c
to	c
do	c
for	i

acctivities	i
during	c
the	c
camp	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
even	c
won	c
competion	i
once	c
.	c

That	c
is	c
why	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
continue	c
doing	c
this	c
at	c
the	c
camp	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c

things	c
like	c

I	c

Generally	c
,	c
most	c
people	c
like	c
shopping	c
,	c
but	c
there	c
are	c
some	c
advantages	c
and	c
disadvantages	c
.	c

When	c
discribing	i
the	c
advantages	c
,	c
we	c
should	c
remember	c
that	c
most	c
people	c
like	c
doing	c
shopping	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
very	c
pleasant	c
when	c
you	c
are	c
looking	c
for	c
something	c
special	c
or	c
for	c
special	c
occasions	c
like	c
wedding	c
,	c
birthday	c
,	c
Christmas	i
presents	c
.	c

Next	c
,	c
it	c
can	c
be	c
very	c
good	c
for	c
your	c
wallet	c
to	c
save	c
some	c
money	c
,	c
when	c
you	c
will	i
find	c
a	c
bargain	c
or	c
sales	c
.	c

What	c
is	c
more	c
,	c
most	c
people	c
cannot	c
live	c
without	c
shopping	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
their	c
way	c
to	c
spend	c
free	c
time	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
some	c
minuses	c
.	c

Instead	c
of	c
that	c
you	c
could	c
do	c
more	c
interesting	c
things	c
.	i

Besides	c
that	c
,	c
shopping	c
steal	i
you	i
from	i
money	i
.	c

On	c
balance	c
some	c
people	c
still	c
like	c
shopping	c
even	c
if	c
it	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
and	c
they	c
have	c
to	c
stand	c
in	c
a	c
long	c
queue	c
to	c
buy	c
something	c
.	c

From	c
my	c
point	c
of	c
view	c
it	c
depands	i
on	c
us	c
if	i
shopping	c
will	c
be	c
enjoyable	c
or	c
not	c
.	c

Accordingly	c
I	c
will	c
give	c
you	c
the	c
further	c
information	c
that	c
you	c
wanted	c
.	c

First	c
,	c
you	c
asked	c
abut	i
the	i
travel	i
time	i
and	c
the	c
only	c
possible	c
time	c
for	c
me	c
is	c
in	c
July	c
,	c
because	c
my	c
company	c
only	c
gave	c
me	c
holidays	i
in	i
this	c
period	c
.	c

I	c
want	c
to	c
feel	c
the	c
real	c
nature	c
and	c
spirit	c
of	c
Camp	c
California	c
.	c

Further	i
more	i
,	c
I	c
should	c
choose	c
between	c
two	c
activities	c
and	c
how	i
good	c
I	c
am	c
at	c
each	c
one	c
.	c

I	c
choose	c
singing	c
and	c
surfing	c
,	i
singing	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
singer	c
in	c
a	c
band	c
and	c
I	c
hope	c
to	c
make	c
my	c
voice	c
more	c
perfect	c
and	c
surfing	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
surf	i
and	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
learn	c
to	i
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
some	c
questions	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

How	c
are	c
you	c
?	c

Me	i
,	i
fine	c
,	c
because	c
of	i
helping	c
at	c
the	c
concert	c
'	i
The	c
Dome	c
'	c
.	c

I	c
can	c
say	c
that	c
this	c
was	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
best	c
experiences	c
of	c
my	c
life	c
.	c

Kim	c
,	c
check	i
it	i
in	i
your	i
mind	i
,	c
I	c
have	c
had	c
near	i
contact	c
with	c
Mariah	c
Carey	c
!	c

At	i
the	i
time	i
the	i
concert	i
was	i
running	i
I	c
cleaned	c
the	c
kitchen	c
and	c
the	c
room	c
where	c
the	c
"	c
stars	c
"	c
ate	c
.	c

The	c
after	i
show	i
dinner	c
party	c
was	c
very	c
nice	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
thought	c
that	c
popular	i
people	i
like	c
Elton	c
John	c
dances	i
on	c
the	c
table	c
if	c
he	i
likes	i
the	c
music	c
and	c
if	c
he	i
have	c
made	i
a	c
great	c
show	c
on	c
stage	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
just	c
great	c
and	c
after	c
this	c
event	c
I	c
can	c
say	c
that	c
popular	i
people	i
are	c
normal	c
humans	c
like	c
everyone	c

Dear	c
Manager	c

My	c
name	c
is	c
Manu	c
Roddos	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
somethings	i
that	c
happened	c
in	i
the	c
performance	c
of	c
the	c
show	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
,	c
wich	i
took	c
place	c
in	c
your	c
stablishment	i
,	c
The	c
Circle	c
Theater	i
,	c
that	i
made	c
me	c
feel	c
very	c
upset	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
is	c
far	c
away	c
from	c
being	c
the	c
best	c
musical	c
show	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
exited	i
to	c
see	c
it	c
yesterday	c
,	c
but	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
I	c
arrived	c
at	c
the	c
theater	i
the	c
problems	c
began	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
looking	c
forward	c
on	i
having	i
a	c
discount	c
of	c
some	i
pounds	c
on	c
my	c
ticket	c
,	c
as	c
the	c
leaflet	c
says	i
,	c
however	c
it	i
did	c
not	c
happen	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
the	c
actors	c
were	c
not	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
,	c
but	c
others	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
seeing	i
before	c
,	c
and	c
the	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
with	c
no	c

Sincerelly	i

In	i

a	c
very	c

among	c

Firstly	c

the	c
great	c

of	i

in	i

with	c
the	c
devellopment	i
of	c
telephones	c

television	c
and	c
even	c
satelites	i
,	c
and	c
of	c
course	c
,	c
the	c
internet	i
,	c
gave	c
common	i

the	c
chance	c
to	c

a	c

over	c
the	c

to	c
grow	i
at	i
a	i

and	c
this	c
is	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
biggest	c
causes	c
of	c
violence	c
in	c
all	c
countries	c

I	i
addition	c

that	c

people	c
will	c
always	c

of	c
the	i
technological	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
from	c
my	c
point	c
of	c
view	c
,	c
people	c
must	c
learn	c
that	c
despite	c
technology	c
being	c
such	c
a	c
new	i
area	c
to	c

we	c

with	c
a	c
great	c
amount	i
of	c
responsability	i

for	c
us	c
all	c
to	c

in	c
the	c
future	c

Thanks	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
,	i
I	c
am	c
so	c
glad	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
asked	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
only	c
in	c
July	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
quite	c
busy	c
with	c
my	c
job	c
.	c

And	c
I	c
prefer	c
tents	c
to	c
log	c
cabins	c
,	c
as	c
I	c
know	c
tents	c
better	c
than	c
log	c
cabins	c
.	c

I	c
used	c
to	c
sleep	c
in	c
tent	i
once	c
on	c
my	c
holiday	c
,	c
and	c
tent	i
is	c
more	c
suitable	c
for	c
camping	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
very	c
kind	c
for	i
you	c
to	c
give	c
me	c
the	c
chance	c
to	c
do	c
two	c
activities	c
while	c
I	c
am	c
at	c
the	c
Camp	c
.	c

For	i
sailing	c
,	c
well	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
n't	c
try	i
it	c
before	c
,	i
that	i
is	c
why	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
try	i
.	c

As	c
you	c
said	c
,	c
all	c
accommodation	c
and	c
travel	c
costs	c
are	c
paid	c
for	i
,	c
but	c
I	c
am	c
sure	c
I	c
still	c
need	c
some	i
money	c
with	c
me	c
.	c

And	c
is	c
there	c
anything	c
eles	i
I	c
have	c
to	c
get	i
with	c
me	c
?	c

I	c
think	c
most	c
people	c
will	c
agree	c
with	i
"	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
"	c
.	c

Because	c
so	c
far	c
as	c
I	c
know	c
nothing	c
is	c
enjoyable	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
.	c

Some	c
people	c
might	c
say	c
women	c
just	c
love	c
shopping	c
,	c
they	c
could	c
n't	c
stop	c
thinking	c
about	c
doing	i
shopping	c
.	c

Yes	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
true	c
,	i
this	i
is	c
only	c
because	c
nowadays	c
people	c
have	c
more	c
money	c
than	c
even	i
before	c
,	c
and	c
some	c
women	c
do	c
n't	c
earn	c
money	c
,	i
they	i
have	c
no	c
idea	c
how	c
diffcult	i
to	i
earn	c
the	i
money	c
.	c

Just	c
imagine	c
if	c
one	c
day	c
their	c
husbands	c
lost	c
their	c
jobs	c
,	i
will	i
those	c
women	c
still	c
thinking	i
shopping	c
is	c
enjoyable	c
!	c

So	c
it	c
is	i
depend	i
on	c
different	i
case	c
.	c

For	i
me	c
,	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
think	c
shopping	c
is	c
enjoyable	c
at	c
all	c
.	c

I	c
even	c
hate	c
shopping	c
.	c

I	c
only	i
go	c
to	i
shop	i
unless	c
I	c
really	c
need	c
something	c
.	c

Shopping	c
is	c
just	c
like	c
a	c
nightmare	c
to	c
me	c
,	i
I	c
think	c
I	c
will	c
never	c
understand	c
why	c
people	c
love	c
shopping	c
.	c

How	c
can	c
you	c
face	i
the	i
same	c
goods	c
at	c
the	c
same	c
shop	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
most	c
men	c
have	c
the	c
same	c
opinion	c
as	c
I	c
do	c
.	c

Some	c
women	c
spend	c
their	c
whole	c
life	c
doing	i
shopping	c
,	c
and	c
most	c
of	c
times	i
,	c
they	c
do	c
n't	c
buy	c
many	c
things	c
.	c

Those	c
are	c
only	c
my	c
opinions	c
,	i
you	i
do	c
n't	c
need	c
to	c
agree	c
with	c
it	i
,	c
but	c
one	c
day	c
you	c
might	c
found	i
out	c
that	c
what	c
I	c
have	c
said	c
is	c
not	c
totally	c
wrong	c
.	c

Dear	c
Jane	c
Clark	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
to	c
give	c
some	i
opinions	c
of	c
mine	c
abut	i
The	c
International	c
Arts	c
Festival	c
.	c

Stars	i
and	c
artists	c
wee	i
only	i
from	i
six	c
countries	c

2	c
.	c

Some	c
concert	c
halls	c
were	c
too	c
small	c
.	c

So	c
it	c
was	c
impossible	c
to	c
get	c
tickets	c
there	c
.	c

3	c
.	c

I	c
think	i
that	i
there	i
were	i
not	i
enough	c
plays	c
and	c
films	c
.	c

Also	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
dance	i
shows	c
should	c
include	c
different	c
styles	c
of	c
dancing	c
(	c
e.g.	c
national	i
dancing	i
of	c
all	c
the	c
countries	c
)	c
to	c
impress	c
audience	i
and	c
not	i
to	i
bore	i
with	i
the	i
similar	i
scenes	i
.	c

It	c
is	c
a	c
pleasure	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
communicate	i
with	c
such	c
a	c
friend	c
as	c
you	c
are	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
.	c

In	c
our	c
school	c
we	c
have	c
the	c
following	c
rules	c
:	c
1	c
.	c

2	c
.	c

One	c
should	c
have	c
such	c
marks	c
as	c
,,3	c
"	c
,	c
,,4	c
"	c
,	c
,,5	c
"	c
not	i
,,2	c
"	c
which	i
is	c
eaqual	i
to	i
fail	i
.	c

Otherwise	c
you	c
are	c
not	c
allowed	c
to	c
come	c
in	c
.	c

These	c
rules	c
are	c
strict	c
and	c
certainly	c
we	c
have	c
endless	i
number	c
of	c
just-so-called	i
rules	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
think	c
you	c
will	c
be	c
interested	c
in	c
them	c
.	c

Truely	i
speaking	c
I	c
am	c
not	c
sure	c
about	c
home	c
rules	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
in	c
our	c
family	c
everything	c
is	c
based	c
on	c
mutual	c
understanding	c
.	c

We	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
old-traditioned	i
rules	c
or	c
something	i
alike	i
.	i

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c

Love	c

I	c
have	c
just	c
received	c
your	c

I	c
want	c

you	c

all	c
this	c

in	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
express	c
my	c
profound	c
gratitude	c
for	c
an	i
excellent	c
organisation	c
of	c
an	i
annual	c
international	c
arts	c
festival	c
,	c
where	c
I	c
spent	c
two	c
days	c
.	c

The	c
idea	c
of	c
such	c
a	c
festival	c
is	c
really	c
magnificent	c
and	c
I	c
enjoyed	c
various	c
art	c
exhibitions	c
,	c
talks	c
by	c
writers	c
and	c
dance	c
shows	c
.	c

I	c
believe	c
your	c
festival	c
to	c
be	c
a	c
great	c
event	c
in	c
our	c
cultural	c
life	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
convinced	c
that	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
success	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Wuthering	c
Heights	c
-	c
Emily	c
BrontÃ«	c

For	i
a	i
start	i
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
books	c
offer	c
us	c
a	c
wide	c
range	c
of	c
different	c
life	c
stories	c
,	c
both	c
realistic	c
and	c
unusual	c
,	c
they	c
make	c
us	c
thoughtful	c
and	c
form	c
our	c
outlook	c
,	c
they	i
make	c
us	c
feel	c
and	c
think	c
.	c

As	c
far	c
as	c
I	c
am	c
concerned	c
,	c
I	c
enjoy	c
reading	c
all	c
kinds	c
of	c
fiction	c
literature	i
as	c
each	c
masterpiece	c
is	c
unique	c
in	c
its	c
own	c
way	c
despite	i
the	i
fact	i
what	c
sort	c
of	c
book	c
it	c
is	c
.	c

Stories	c
that	c
are	c
realistic	c
help	c
us	c
to	c
understand	c
better	i
our	i
own	i
life	i
and	i
people	i
around	i
us	i
.	c

However	c
,	c
reading	c
an	c
unusual	c
,	c
sometimes	c
fantastic	i
story	c
we	c
could	c
dream	c
about	c
fairy	c
lands	c
and	c
observe	c
our	c
world	c
from	c
another	c
point	c
of	c
view	c
.	c

I	c
consider	c
"	c
Wuthering	c
Heights	c
"	c
by	c
Emily	c
BrontÃ«	c
to	c
be	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
books	c
that	c
wash	c
away	c
from	c
the	c
soul	c
the	c
dust	c
of	c
everyday	i
's	i
routine	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
a	c
remarkable	c
piece	c
of	c
literature	c
,	c
which	c
portrays	c
deep	c
feelings	c
of	c
love	c
and	c
hate	c
,	c
depicts	c
strong	c
and	c
unique	c
characters	c
,	c
reveals	i
eternal	c
concerns	c
with	c
good	c
and	c
bad	c
,	c
life	c
and	c
death	c
.	c

It	c
contributes	c
to	c
the	c
world	i
treasurehouse	i
of	c
literature	c
and	c
arouses	c
irresistable	i
fascination	c
.	c

i	i
am	c
writing	c
to	c
reply	c
your	i
questions	c
about	c
me	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
abut	i
this	c
big	c
opportunity	c
you	c
give	i
me	c
to	c
visit	c
this	i
wonderful	c
place	c
like	i
California	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
only	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
my	c
boss	c
can	i
not	i
give	c
me	c
a	i
leaving	i
for	c
the	c
other	c
months	c
of	i
Summer	i
.	c

Also	c
,	c
I	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
tents	i
because	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
good	c
chance	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
live	c
with	c
the	i
nature	c
and	c
to	c
wake	c
up	c
listening	i
birds	c
which	c
singing	i
.	c

It	c
will	c
be	c
nice	c
!	c

Then	c
you	c
ask	c
me	c
which	c
two	c
activities	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
choose	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
good	c
in	i
both	c
of	c
these	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
been	c
swimming	c
for	c
eight	c
years	c
!	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
ask	i
you	c
about	c
the	c
weather	c
.	c

I	c
want	c
to	c
know	c
if	c
I	c
should	c
bring	c
warm	c
clothes	c
or	c
not	c
and	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
.	c

Thanks	c
for	c
you	i
letter	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
know	c
this	c
Summer	i
I	c
really	i
enjoy	i
myself	c
doing	c
things	c
I	c
like	c
a	c
lot	c
.	c

Last	c
month	c
,	c
Alice	c
and	c
her	c
friends	c
proposed	i
me	i
to	i
help	i
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
.	c

I	c
did	c
n't	c
want	c
to	c
take	c
any	c
money	c
because	c
I	c
was	c
so	c
happy	c
that	c
I	c
had	c
seen	c
the	c
concert	i
of	i
"	i
Savage	i
Garden	i
"	i
in	i
live	c
and	c
because	c
that	c
night	c
was	c
the	c
best	c
of	c
my	c
life	c
.	c

But	c
the	c
thing	c
I	c
particularly	c
liked	c
about	c
my	c
experience	c
,	i
was	c
the	c
feeling	c
when	c
you	c
are	c
near	c
and	c
when	c
you	c
talk	c
with	c
the	i
people	i
so	i
famous	i
.	c

That	c
's	c
all	c
for	c
now	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
waiting	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c

Margaret	c

P.S.	c
I	c
hope	c
you	c

find	c
the	c
spare	c
time	c
to	c
visit	c
my	c
country	c
this	c
Summer	i
.	c

I	c
've	c
just	c

I	c
thank	c

As	c

the	i
time	i
I	c
would	c

I	c
would	c

As	c
you	c

there	c
are	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
activities	c
that	c
we	c
can	c
do	c
.	c

The	i
swimming	i
is	c
my	c
best	i
sport	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
I	c
will	c
have	c
the	c
opportunity	c
to	c
play	c
basketball	c
,	c
despite	c
the	c
fact	c
that	c
I	c

not	c
too	i

The	c
aim	c
of	c

to	c

opinion	c
that	c
the	c
morning	c
English	c
lessons	c
with	c
our	c
teacher	c
George	i
are	i
worth	c
filming	c
and	c
showing	c
for	c
many	c
reasons	c
.	c

Above	c
all	c
,	c
they	c
are	c
enjoyable	c
and	c
interesting	c
.	c

All	c
of	c
us	c
participate	c
effectively	i
.	c

I	c
want	i
this	i
opinion	i
wo	i
n't	i
imply	i
that	c
the	c
other	c
lessons	c
of	c
other	c
teachers	c
are	c
n't	c
interesting	c
.	c

The	c
pictures	c
will	i
be	c
amazing	c
and	c
wonderful	c
.	c

There	c
are	c
many	c
activities	c
that	c
they	i
could	c
be	c
filmed	c
.	c

We	c
can	c
film	c
our	c
Swimming	c
pool	c
,	c
despite	i
the	i
artificial	i
sunbathing	i
.	c

It	c
is	c
clean	c
,	c
neat	c
and	c
tidy	c
with	c
helpful	c
staff	c
.	c

The	c
gym	c
is	c
good	i
choice	c
for	c
filming	c
with	c
the	c
sophisticated	c
equipments	i
that	c
owns	i
.	c

We	c
should	c
n't	c
disregard	i
and	c
neglect	c
to	c
film	c
the	c
buildings	c
and	c
the	c
gardens	c
of	c
our	c
beautiful	c
college	c
,	c
especially	c
when	i
we	c
take	c
into	c
our	i
consideration	c
the	c
fact	c
that	c
it	c
is	c
in	c
the	c
city	c
of	c
Shakespear	i
.	c

It	c
will	c
be	c
a	i
good	c
advertising	c
,	c
and	c
will	c
help	c
to	c
make	c
the	c
reputation	c
of	c
our	c
college	c
even	c
more	i
better	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
hope	c
that	c
my	c
modest	c
report	c
will	c
help	c
the	c
management	c
of	c
our	c
college	c
to	c
achieve	c
their	c
aim	c
.	c

I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
say	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
choosing	c
me	c
and	c
sending	c
me	c
the	c
letter	c
.	c

For	c
the	c
camp	c
,	c
you	c
need	c
some	c
information	c
from	c
me	c
,	c
do	c
n't	c
you	c
?	c

Therefore	c
I	c
am	c
going	c
to	c
write	c
them	i
down	c
.	c

Second	c
,	c
I	c
prefer	c
log	c
cabins	c
than	i
tents	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
if	c
the	c
log	c
cabins	c
are	c
not	c
available	c
at	c
the	c
moment	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
stay	c
in	c
the	c
tents	c
.	c

Third	c
,	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
choose	c
painting	c
and	c
surfing	c
for	c
the	c
activities	c
.	c

Because	i
I	c
've	c
started	i
surfing	c
since	c
1998	c
and	c
I	c
'm	c
keen	c
on	c
surfing	c
.	c

Also	c
,	c
painting	c
is	c
one	c
of	c
my	c
favorite	i
things	c
!	c

I	c
know	c
everything	c
is	c
included	c
and	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
need	c
to	c
pay	c
anything	c
but	i
in	i
case	i
should	i
I	i
bring	i
some	i
money	i
or	c
not	c
?	c

I	c
really	c
appreciate	c
your	c
choosing	c
me	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c

Truly	c

Hi	c
!	c

The	c
interview	c
was	c
OK	c
and	c
my	c
friend	c
and	c
I	c
was	i
hired	c
!	c

Then	c
,	c
the	c
day	c
of	c
the	c
concert	c
came	c
!	c

Can	c
you	c
imagine	c
how	c
excited	c
we	c
were	c
?	c

Our	c
heart	i
was	i
bumping	i
and	c
we	c
were	c
kind	c
of	c
nervous	c
,	c
however	c
,	c
there	c
were	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
things	c
to	c
do	c
so	i
we	c
started	c
working	c
.	c

We	c
could	c
listen	c
for	c
free	c
!	c

I	c
just	c
imagined	c
what	c
it	c
was	c
like	c
to	c
be	c
a	c
singer	c
.	c

Anyway	c
,	c
by	c
the	c
time	c
we	c
finished	c
everything	c
,	c
thusands	i
of	c
funs	i
came	c
in	i
this	c
concert	c
hall	c
.	c

We	c
saw	c
some	c
very	c
strange	c
fans	c
but	c
most	c
of	c
them	c
were	c
quite	c
nice	c
.	c

Actually	c
,	c
they	c
were	c
well-behaved	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
the	c
concert	c
finished	c
and	c
we	c
were	c
thanked	c
by	c
this	c
singer	c
.	c

Also	c
,	c
we	c
got	c
some	c
posteres	i
as	c
well	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
great	c
experience	c
for	c
me	c
and	c
my	c
friend	c
.	c

I	c
wish	c
you	c
were	i
there	c
with	c
us	c
!	c

Please	c
take	c
care	c
and	c
please	c
write	c
to	c
me	c
,	c
right	c
?	c

Dear	c
Madam	c
:	c

Well	c
,	c
as	c
you	c
demand	i
,	c
I	c
tell	i
you	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
July	c
begins	c
,	c
I	c
'm	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
able	c
only	c
this	i
summer	i
month	c
because	c
my	i
job	c
responsabilities	i
.	c

Acording	i
to	i
the	c
choice	c
whether	i
I	i
prefer	i
tends	i
or	c
log	c
cabins	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
I	c
will	c
turn	c
to	c
the	c
first	c
one	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
always	c
loved	c
camping	c
the	i
nearest	i
to	c
nature	c
,	c
if	c
it	i
's	i
possible	c
in	i
front	c
of	c
a	c
lake	c
or	c
a	c
river	c
,	c
if	c
you	i
camping	i
has	c
one	c
,	c
so	c
that	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
practise	i
my	c
favorite	i
and	c
skillful	i
hobby	c
:	c
sailing	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
add	i
some	c
further	c
questions	c
:	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
do	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
bring	c
?	c
,	i
Do	i
I	i
any	i
kind	i
?	i
,	i
and	i
Would	c
it	c
be	c
necessary	c
to	c
bring	c
money	i
?	c
,	i
how	i
much	c
?	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
hope	c
the	c
information	c
above	c
would	i
be	c
sufficient	c
.	c

Your	i
faithfully	c
Jose	i
Fernandez	c

Besides	c
that	c
,	c
this	c
character	c
is	c
more	c
interesting	c
than	c
others	i
due	c
to	c
his	c
complex	c
mind	c
and	c
his	c
deep	c
evil	i
manners	i
.	c

It	i
's	i
the	c
richest	c
character	c
at	i
all	c
,	c
his	c
name	c
is	c
Heathcliff	c
,	c
and	c
he	c
's	c
the	c
reason	c
of	i
whatever	c
happens	c
to	c
the	c
others	i
characters	c
.	c

They	c
are	c
always	c
suffering	c
the	i
revenge	i
that	c
Heathcliff	c
swear	i
,	c
cause	i
of	c
which	c
is	c
the	c
miserable	c
situation	c
the	c
other	c
character	i
have	c
put	c
him	c
in	c
.	c

From	c
this	c
point	c
of	c
view	c
I	c
think	c
Heathcliff	c
should	c
n't	c
be	c
hated	c
by	i
his	c
bad	c
temper	c
.	c

He	c
's	c
not	c
good	c
not	c
because	c
he	c
was	c
born	c
with	c
this	c
trend	i
to	c
harm	c
but	c
the	i
others	i
character	i
make	i
him	c
become	i
thus	i
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Ryan	c
,	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
of	c
13	c
June	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
not	c
too	c
much	i
confortable	i
,	c
but	c
it	i
is	c
not	c
a	c
problem	c
for	c
me	c
,	i
I	c
like	c
this	c
kind	c
of	c
holliday	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
keen	c
on	c
photography	c
so	c
I	c
would	c
love	c
to	c
participated	i
at	i
this	c
activity	c
,	i
I	c
am	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
that	i
and	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
pleasure	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
help	c
the	c
others	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
be	c
grateful	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
tell	c
me	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
with	c
and	i
how	c
many	i
money	c
,	c
more	c
or	c
less	c
,	c
do	i
you	c
think	c
I	c
should	c
take	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

Like	i
you	c
know	c
last	i
month	c
,	i
I	c
had	i
helped	i
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
and	c
I	c
enjoyed	c
it	c
a	c
lot	c
.	c

Firstly	i
I	c
had	c
to	c
make	c
the	c
decor	i
of	i
the	c
scene	i
,	c
so	c
I	c
made	c
in	i
the	c
background	c
a	c
sky	c
with	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
bright	c
stars	c
.	c

But	c
that	c
was	c
only	c
the	c
begining	i
of	c
my	c
adventure	c
.	c

The	c
most	c
exiting	i
part	c
was	c
when	c
I	c
had	c
to	i
make	i
up	i
the	c
pop	i
stars	i
!	i

I	c
never	c
had	c
met	c
pop	c
stars	c
before	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
impresed	i
,	c
but	c
I	c
was	c
too	c
happy	c
to	c
show	c
my	c
shyness	c
.	c

Do	c
you	c
believe	c
that	c
I	c
spoke	c
with	c
Micheal	c
Jackson	c
,	c
my	c
favourite	c
singer	c
?	c

I	c
ca	c
n't	c
believe	c
it	c
yet	c
!	c

I	c
will	c
remember	c
that	c
day	c
for	c
the	c
rest	c
of	c
my	c
life	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
like	i
a	i
dream	i
who	i
becomes	i
tru	i
.	c

I	c
ca	c
n't	c
explain	c
how	c
supper	i
it	c
was	c
.	c

I	c
stayed	c
with	c
him	c
until	c
the	c
concert	c
begun	i
and	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
I	c
had	c
the	c
opportunity	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
his	c
private	c
room	c
with	c
him	c
and	c
the	c
other	c
dansers	i
.	c

Love	c
,	c

Audrey	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Brown	c
,	c

I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
yesterday	c
,	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
play	c
"	c
Over	c
The	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
and	c
I	c
must	c
say	c
that	c
I	c
got	i
rather	c
disappointed	c
.	c

Also	c
,	c
your	c
advertisement	c
sign	i
says	c
that	c
discounts	c
are	c
available	c
.	c

When	c
the	c
play	c
finally	c
started	c
,	c
and	c
the	c
two	c
actors	c
entered	c
the	c
stage	c
,	c
I	c
could	c
see	c
that	c
the	c
male	c
one	c
was	c
not	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
differently	i
from	i
what	c
the	c
advertisement	c
sign	i
says	c
,	c
what	i
really	c
disappointed	c
me	c
since	c
he	c
was	c
the	c
only	c
reason	c
that	c
I	c
came	c
to	c
this	c
play	c
.	c

But	c
my	c
complaints	c
are	c
not	c
over	c
yet	c
.	c

After	c
the	c
disappointing	c
performance	c
the	i
actor	c
who	c
replaced	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
,	c
and	c
,	c
also	c
differing	i
from	i
the	c
advertisement	c
sign	i
,	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

There	c
was	c
only	c
a	c
small	c
sign	c
stamped	i
on	c
the	c
door	c
,	c
saying	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
"	c
closed	c
for	c
repairs	c
"	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
unfortunately	c
,	c
I	c
must	c
say	c
that	c
last	c
night	c
was	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
worst	c
nights	c
I	c
ever	c
had	c
,	c
and	c
given	i
the	c
reasons	c
,	c
I	c
expect	c
to	i
count	c
with	i
your	c
sense	c
of	c
responsability	i
,	c
so	c
,	c
I	c
feel	c
that	c
I	c
must	c
ask	c
for	c
my	c
20	c
pounds	c
spent	i
on	c
that	c
terrible	c
night	c
.	c

yours	c
faithful	i
,	c

How	c
has	c
modern	c
technology	c
changed	c
your	c
daily	c
life	c
?	c

As	c
we	c
all	c
know	c
,	c
technology	c
had	i
a	i
gigantic	i
improvement	i
over	c
the	c
last	c
20	c
years	c
,	c
and	c
today	c
,	c
it	c
affects	c
us	c
in	c
many	c
ways	c
.	c

Most	c
of	c
the	c
modern	c
jobs	c
involves	i
computers	c
,	c
so	c
there	c
is	c
no	c
physical	c
effort	c
,	c
just	c
mental	c
,	c
but	c
,	c
on	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
we	c
improved	c
communications	c
with	c
computers	c
and	c
Internet	i
,	c
a	i
kind	c
of	c
communication	c
where	c
there	c
is	c
no	c
need	c
to	c
meet	c
personally	c
,	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
other	c
person	c
,	c
just	c
the	c
need	c
to	c
talk	c
.	c

Also	c
,	c
with	c
today	c
's	c
machines	c
,	c
factories	c
have	c
significantly	c
increased	c
their	c
production	c
,	c
what	i
brings	c
progress	c
to	c
humanity	c
,	c
but	c
also	c
,	c
with	c
the	c
continous	i
replacement	c
of	c
men	c
by	c
machines	c
,	c
the	i
unemployment	c
is	c
increasing	c
too	c
,	c
and	c
today	c
,	c
it	c
worries	c
every	c
single	c
citizen	c
of	c
the	c
world	c
,	c
specially	c
the	c
ones	c
who	c
lives	i
in	c
third	c
world	c
country	i
.	c

The	c
most	c
important	c
thing	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
will	c
be	c
knowing	c
how	c
to	c
deal	c
with	c
machines	c
,	c
so	c
,	c
today	c
's	c
children	c
must	c
be	c
introduced	c
to	c
computers	c
since	i
an	c
early	c
age	c
,	c
so	c
that	c
they	c
could	i
have	c
a	c
chance	c
to	c
compete	c
with	c
the	c
furious	c
emearrence	i
in	i
the	c
future	c
.	c

As	c
for	c
the	c
accommodations	i
I	i
would	c
prefer	c
a	c
tent	c
,	i
there	i
's	i
nothing	c
like	c
hearing	c
raindrops	c
on	c
canvas	c
at	c
night	c
!	c

I	c
have	c
sailed	c
some	i
in	c
my	c
youth	c
but	c
have	c
never	c
went	i
climbing	c
.	c

It	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
fun	c
experiance	i
!	c

Will	c
I	c
be	c
needing	c
any	c
money	c
.	i

Please	c
send	c
me	c
a	c
list	c
of	c
needed	i
clothes	c
and/or	c
supplies	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

P.S	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
if	c
there	c
is	c
a	c
medical	c
staff	c
present	c
during	c
the	c
two	c
weeks	c
?	i

Why	c
can	i
shopping	i
be	i
unenjoyable	i
?	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
it	c
depends	c
on	c
who	c
is	c
with	c
you	c
and	c
what	c
the	c
other	c
person	c
likes	c
to	c
shop	c
for	c

Why	c
would	c
anyone	c
shop	c
with	c
that	c
type	c
of	c

Well	c
,	c
I	c
really	c
do	c

when	c
a	c

on	c
some	c

usually	c
several	c

it	i
's	i

better	c
than	c

talking	c
about	c
shoes	c

That	c

shoes	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
"	c
over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
"	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
said	c
that	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
should	i
play	c
the	c
leading	c
part	c
,	c
but	c
there	c
was	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
instead	c
.	c

We	c
arrived	c
at	c
the	c
theatre	c
at	c
19,00	c
since	c
the	c
play	c
should	i
start	c
at	c
19:30	c
but	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
wait	c
until	c
20:15	c
then	i
it	c
started	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
also	c
said	c
that	c
discounts	c
was	i
available	c
but	c
this	c
was	c
wrong	c
,	c
because	c
we	c
could	c
n't	c
get	c
any	c
discounts	c
.	c

Anne	c
Svensson	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

How	c
should	i
she	c
manage	c
to	c
keep	c
quiet	c
about	c
this	c
.	i

This	c
was	c
the	c
best	c
thing	c
that	c
ever	i
had	i
happend	i
in	i
years	i
for	i
the	i
Fennall	i
family	i
.	c

She	c
realised	c
that	c
telling	c
Pat	c
was	c
a	c
very	c
bad	c
idea	c
but	c
now	c
it	c
was	c
done	c
.	c

Maria	c
was	c
still	c
a	c
little	c
bit	c
chocked	i
over	i
the	c
naus	i
of	i
having	c
a	c
baby	c
.	c

The	c
rest	c
of	c
the	c
family	c
understood	c
that	c
something	c
was	c
wrong	c
because	c
Pat	c
started	c
to	c
buy	c
baby	c
clothes	c
.	c

Which	c
was	c
very	c
chooking	i
for	c
her	c
mother	c
.	c

"	c
Maria	c
and	c
Peter	c
are	c
going	c

it	c
was	c
the	c
best	c
concert	c
I	c
've	c
ever	c
been	c
to	c
,	c
but	c
the	c
coolest	c
thing	c
is	c
that	c
,	c
well	c
do	c
you	c
remember	c
my	c

me	c
that	c
they	c
needed	c
people	c
to	c
put	c
everything	c

the	c
stage	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
help	c
them	c

everithing	i
else	c
,	c
and	c
when	c
I	c

told	i
me	i
would	i
you	i

me	i
a	i

with	i
my	i
decks	i

unfortunately	c
for	c
me	c
and	c
the	c
others	i
spectators	c
,	c
the	c
worst	c
thing	c
happened	c
:	c
the	c
theatre	c
's	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
without	c
any	c
reasons	c
and	i
nobody	c
went	i

to	c
apologise	c

an	i

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c

That	c
's	c
why	c
all	c
his	c
friends	c
were	c
angry	c
against	i
him	c
and	c
let	i
him	c
alone	c
.	c

To	i
beginning	i
,	c
every	c
morning	c
Pat	c
says	i
a	c
pleasant	c
"	c
hello	c
"	c
in	i
adding	i
to	c
that	c
a	c
big	c
smail	i

His	c
mother	c
always	c
says	c

"	c

As	c

what	c
his	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

You	c
ca	i
n't	i
believe	c
what	c
I	c
did	c
last	c
month	c
.	c

First	c
I	c
arrived	c
really	c
early	c
in	c
the	c
morning	c
on	i
the	c
place	c
,	c
but	c
the	c
people	c
were	c
just	c
working	c
and	c
I	c
joined	c
them	c
.	c

You	c
had	i
always	i
some	c
problems	c
because	i
like	c
not	c
having	c
enough	c
wire	c
or	c
the	c
lamps	c
were	i
broken	c
by	c
the	c
transport	c
.	c

The	c
experience	c
that	c
I	c
made	i
was	c
,	i
that	c
I	c
had	c
never	c
worked	c
in	c
a	i
such	i
perfect	c
team	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
able	c
to	c
ask	c
anybody	c
,	c
and	c
he	c
answered	c
detailly	i
,	c
althoug	i
he	c
was	i
full	i
of	c
work	c
.	c

After	c
the	c
hard	c
work	c
we	c
took	i
cool	c
drinks	c
,	c
sat	c
down	c
on	c
the	c
ground	c
and	c
enjoyed	c
the	c
pop	c
concert	c
.	c

Dear	c

also	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
buy	c
tickets	c
with	c
my	c
credit	c
card	c
but	c
on	c
the	c
advertisement	c
,	i
it	c
said	c
'	c
discounts	c
available	c
'	c
I	i
was	c
really	c
annoyed	c
by	c
that	c
!	c

I	c
have	c
no	c
idea	c
why	c
!	c

We	c
had	c
a	c
really	c
unenjoyable	c
time	c
at	c
your	c
theatre	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
and	c
I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hear	i
from	c
you	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

So	c
one	c
week	c
later	c
all	c
student	i
in	c
my	c
class	c
knew	c
that	c
I	c
was	c
an	c
angle	i
.	c

Certainly	i
!	c

Nobody	c
believed	c
her	c
...	c
neither	i
me	c
.	c

But	c
it	c
's	c
true	c
...	c

I	c
'm	c
an	c
angle	i
and	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
visit	c
the	c
earth	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
easy	c
to	c
do	c
but	c
the	c
only	c
one	i
rule	c
was	c
I	c
can	i
tell	c
my	c
secret	c
to	c
only	c
one	c
person	c
.	c

And	c
if	c
someone	c
elso	i
knows	i
,	c
I	c
wo	i
n't	i
be	c
able	c
to	c
go	c
back	c
to	c
the	i
heaven	c
unless	c
I	c
kill	i
the	c
person	c
who	c
told	c
my	c
secret	c
.	c

I	c
promised	c
to	c
myself	c
...	c

I	c
went	c
to	c
Pat	c
's	c
house	c
but	c
her	c
brother	c
told	c
me	c
that	c
she	c
was	c
n't	c
there	c
.	c

I	c
offered	c
to	c
wait	c
...	c

Her	c
brother	c
and	c
I	c
began	c
to	c
talk	c
...	c

He	c
's	c
such	c
a	c
nice	c
boy	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
want	c
to	c
go	c
back	c
to	c
the	i
heaven	c
anymore	c
as	c
long	c
as	c
I	c
am	c
with	c
him	c
.	c

Secondly	c
you	i
asked	c
me	c
,	i
when	c
I	c
have	c
time	c
for	c
travel	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
can	c
go	i
only	i
in	c
July	c
,	c
because	c
only	i
in	i
July	i
I	i
have	i
holiday	i
.	c

And	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
in	c
the	c
first	c
part	c
of	c
this	c
month	c
,	c
socond	i
part	c
I	c
spend	c
with	c
my	c
familly	i
.	c

If	c
you	c
do	c
not	c
mind	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
tent	i
,	c
because	c
in	c
tent	i
I	c
will	c
be	c
along	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
,	i
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
must	c
have	c
with	c
me	c
?	c

And	c
what	c
clothes	c
I	c
should	c
take	c
with	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c

you	c

DEAR	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

And	c
now	c
to	c
be	i
the	i
first	i
winner	i
.	i

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
for	c
two	c
reason	i
one	c
's	c
is	i
because	c
I	c
totaly	i
will	c
finish	i
my	c
exam	i
in	i
that	c
date	i
and	c
the	c
other	c
in	i
the	c
first	c
two	c
week	i
I	i
will	c
go	c
to	c
Farnborought	c
is	i
special	i
10	i
days	i
the	i
presentation	i
the	c
Air	c
show	c
and	c
will	i
be	i
there	i
the	i
delegation	i
from	i
my	i
country	i
.	c

And	c
for	c
the	c
second	c
question	c
.	c

About	c
accommodation	c
during	c
these	c
two	c
weeks	c
at	c
the	c
Camp	c
I	i
would	c
prefer	c
log	i
cabins	i
;	c
because	c
maybe	c
is	i
more	c
interesting	c
to	c
share	c
with	c
other	c
people	c
.	c

In	i
other	i
hand	i
you	c
ask	i
me	c
I	c
have	c
the	c
chance	c
for	i
to	c
choose	c
two	c
activities	c
while	c
I	c
am	c
at	c
the	c
camp	c
.	c

but	i
is	i
no	i
easy	i
,	c
because	c
all	c
is	i
very	c
interesting	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

But	c
anyway	c
I	i
like	i
more	i
to	i
have	i
the	i
possibilities	i
for	i
practice	i
climbing	c
and	c
surfing	c
.	c

Can	c
you	c
said	i
me	c
if	c
is	i
necessary	c
to	c
bring	c
special	i
clothes	c
,	i
I	i
refer	i
for	i
instance	c
if	c
I	c
practice	i
surfing	c
I	i
need	c
water	i
suit	i
.	c

I	i
need	c
extra	i
money	c
?	c

I	c
am	i
really	c
appreciate	c
if	i
you	c
can	i
answer	c
me	i
these	c
doubt	i
and	c
saying	i
again	i
.	c

Thanks	c
very	c
much	c
,	c
because	c
is	c
new	c
stimulation	c
for	c
me	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
this	c
topic	c
is	c
so	c
exciting	c
in	i
the	c
antropological	i
and	c
psicological	i
point	c
of	c
view	c
,	c
because	c
we	c
can	c
studie	i
the	c
reaction	i
before	c
,	c
during	c
and	c
after	c
to	i
shopping	c
.	c

People	c
in	c
general	c
have	c
a	c
compulsory	i
actitud	i
for	i
shopping	i
in	i
my	c
opinion	c
.	c

For	c
the	i
men	c
and	c
women	c
is	i
important	i
the	i
appearance	i
and	c
they	c
spent	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
money	c
in	i
buy	i
clothes	c
,	c
cosmetic	i
,	c
accesories	i
,	c
jewels	i
etc.	c
And	c
the	i
other	c
they	i
choose	i
sometimes	i
just	c
for	c
the	c
label	c
.	c

Without	i
give	i
really	i
importance	i
to	i
the	i
calidad	i
in	i
reference	i
to	i
the	i
appearance	i
there	i
is	i
more	i
preocupation	i
in	i
the	i
food	i
area	i
,	c
because	c
people	c
in	c
general	c
they	i
do	c
n't	c
spent	i
the	i
time	c
for	i
prepare	i
food	c
and	c
when	c
they	c
shopping	i
they	c
choose	c
pre-prepared	c
food	c
.	c

We	c
know	c
is	i
more	i
easy	i
for	c
these	i
busy	i
life	c
.	c

In	i
the	i
other	i
hand	i
the	c
facilities	c
for	c
access	c
to	c
mall	i
center	i
is	i
not	c
good	c
.	c

The	c
area	c
for	c
parking	c
,	c
space	c
for	c
play	i
grown	i
to	i
the	i
children	i
or	c
bus	c
station	c
near	c
the	c
mall	c
is	i
not	c
really	c
appropiate	i
.	c

Otherwise	c
shopping	c
will	i
be	c
more	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
in	c
the	c
nearly	i
future	c
we	c
need	c
to	c
decide	c
with	c
the	c
goverment	i
.	i

Mr	c
Manager	c
:	c

A	c
few	c
days	c
ago	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
London	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
nice	c
holiday	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
expecting	c
to	c
have	c
fun	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
play	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
,	c
thats	i
now	c
presenting	i
in	c
your	c
theatre	c
.	c

I	c
read	c
the	c
advertisement	c
and	c
I	c
thought	c
it	c
was	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
a	c
plesent	i
evening	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
buy	c
the	c
ticket	c
I	c
tried	c
to	c
get	c
a	c
discount	c
with	c
my	c
student	c
card	c
,	c
but	c
that	c
was	c
not	c
posible	i
.	c

I	c
think	c
you	c
realized	i
why	c
I	c
'm	c
writting	i
this	c
letter	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
to	c
give	c
my	i
money	c
back	c
.	c

All	c
the	c
thing	i
that	c
were	c
promised	c
in	c
your	c
advertisement	c
were	c
not	i
true	i
,	c
and	c
it	c
was	c
definitly	i
NOT	c
the	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
.	c

There	c
's	c
no	c
doubt	c
that	c
modern	c
tecnology	i
has	c
changed	c
our	c
lives	c
,	c
but	c
how	c
?	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
some	c
of	c
the	c
changes	c
had	i
been	c
very	c
good	c
,	c
like	c
the	c
impruvement	i
to	i
the	i
medical	c
science	c
,	c
that	i
now	c
can	c
saved	i
millions	c
of	c
persons	i
that	c
one	c
hundred	c
years	c
ago	c
were	c
doomed	c
to	c
die	c
or	c
to	c
live	c
miserable	c
lives	c
.	c

The	i
weapons	i
and	c
the	i
factories	c
are	c
destroing	i
our	c
planet	c
and	c
we	c
need	c
to	c
realized	i
that	c
we	c
have	c
to	c
use	c
tecnology	i
to	c
impruve	i
our	c
lives	c
,	c
but	i
always	c
triying	i
to	c
respect	c
nature	c
.	c

Dear	c
Madam	i
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
have	i
received	i
your	c
letter	c
yesterday	c
.	c

I	c
really	i
thanks	i
for	i
your	i
organisation	i
has	i
given	i
me	i
the	i
opportunities	i
to	c
go	c
abroad	i
U.S.A	c
.	c

Because	c
my	c
summer	c
holidays	c
break	i
is	i
start	c
at	c
end	i
of	c
June	c
.	c

And	c
I	c
need	c
few	i
days	c
to	c
prepare	c
my	c
stuff	c
.	c

Regarding	c
to	i
the	c
accommodation	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
tents	c
more	i
than	c
log	c
carbins	i
because	c
I	c
have	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
experiences	i
of	c
built	i
up	c
my	c
own	c
tents	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
was	c
in	c
highschool	i
I	c
used	c
to	c
be	c
a	c
member	c
of	c
the	c
campfire	i
.	c

And	c
I	c
think	c
,	i
it	c
is	i
nice	c
to	c
draw	c
the	i
beautiful	c
landscapes	c
of	c
the	c
place	c
.	c

Beside	c
drawings	i
,	c
swimming	c
is	c
my	c
favourite	c
as	c
well	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
was	c
in	c
highschool	i
,	c
I	c
have	i
joined	i
in	i
the	c
swimming	c
club	c
.	c

And	c
I	c
also	c
participated	c
in	c
a	c
few	c
swimming	c
competition	i
.	c

Although	c
I	c
'm	c
not	c
the	c
best	c
,	c
but	i
I	c
have	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
confident	i
in	i
it	c
.	c

At	i
last	i
some	i
of	i
things	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
clarify	c
,	c
that	i
is	i
,	i
what	c
type	c
of	c
clothes	c
and	c
money	i
do	i
I	c
need	c
to	c
prepared	i
.	c

For	i
most	i
of	i
the	i
people	c
might	c
think	c
,	c
why	c
would	c
I	c
say	c
that	c
,	i
because	c
shopping	c
is	c
a	c
very	c
good	c
entertainment	c
especially	i
for	c
female	i
,	c
as	i
me	c
.	c

For	i
frank	i
,	c
I	c
like	c
to	c
shopping	i
.	c

I	c
like	c
to	c
have	i
window	c
shopping	c
that	i
is	i
good	i
to	i
go	i
arround	i
the	c
shopping	c
area	i
.	c

It	c
would	i
help	i
you	c
up	i
to	c
the	i
date	c
.	c

What	c
fashion	c
is	c
hit	i
now	c
.	c

So	c
sometimes	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
think	c
shopping	c
is	c
enjoyable	c
,	c
and	c
if	c
there	c
is	c
any	c
big	c
festival	i
,	c
I	c
would	c
rather	c
stay	c
at	c
home	c
and	c
watch	c
television	c
.	c

you	c

them	c

There	c
are	c
ways	c
of	c
behaviour	i
to	i
make	i
more	i
fun	i
of	i
it	i
.	c

Dear	c
Madam/Sir	c
,	c

Recently	c
I	c
am	i
interested	c
in	c
musical	c
shows	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
seen	c
it	i
in	c
my	c
country	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
London	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

As	c
I	c
arrived	c
there	c
after	c
5	c
P.M.	c
,	c
I	c
missed	c
the	c
first	c
performance	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
19:30	c
p.m	c
performance	c
.	c

However	i
it	c
started	c
20:15	i
!	c

Furthermore	c
there	c
were	c
no	c
student	c
discounts	c
!	c

The	c
worst	c
one	i
was	c
that	c
the	c
actor	c
and	c
actress	c
were	c
not	c
the	c
person	i
who	c
had	c
been	c
written	c
in	i
the	c
advertisement	c
,	c
because	c
of	c
that	c
I	c
was	c
extremely	c
disappointed	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
I	c
could	c
not	c
concentrate	c
on	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

After	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
when	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
restaurant	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
,	c
because	c
it	c
usually	c
opens	c
between	c
afternoon	c
and	c
evening	c
shows	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
really	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
!	c

Chu	c
Jin-Sun	c
.	c

But	c
if	c
you	c
thought	c
10	i
years	c
before	i
you	c
can	i
easily	c
notice	c
.	c

I	i
would	i
like	i
to	i
see	i
the	i
change	i
in	i
an	i
advantage	i
and	i
a	i
disadvantage	i
view	i
,	i
In	i
an	c
advantage	c
.	c

The	c
modern	c
technology	c
is	c
developing	c
toward	c
convenience	c
for	c
human	i
.	c

How	c
incredable	i
it	c
is	c
!	c

However	c
not	i
only	c
this	c
advantage	c
but	c
also	i
there	i
are	i
lots	c
of	c
disadvantages	c
.	c

Although	c
mobile	i
phone	c
is	c
very	c
useful	c
our	i
life	c
,	c
it	c
might	c
be	c
harmful	c
for	c
our	c
brain	i
because	c
of	c
micro	i
wave	i
it	c
can	c
cause	c
the	i
cancer	c
or	c
traffic	c
accidents	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
the	i
side	c
effect	i
of	c
artificial	c
farm	c
products	c
also	c
ca	c
n't	c
be	c
ignored	c
in	c
our	c
daily	c
life	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
say	c
the	i
science	c
and	c
techology	c
changed	c
our	c
daily	c
life	c
more	i
convenience	c
it	i
also	c
could	c
be	c
dangerous	c
.	c

Dear	c
Ms.	c
Helen	c
.	c

I	c
'll	c
confirm	c
about	c
my	c
hopes	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
I	c
'll	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
travel	c
on	i
July	c
.	c

Due	c
to	c
the	c
fact	c
that	c
my	c
children	c
have	c
summer	c
holiday	c
from	c
July	c
.	c

I	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
log	c
cabins	c
,	c
therefore	i
I	c
'm	c
going	c
to	c
travel	c
with	c
2	c
children	c
and	c
my	c
dog	c
.	c

I	c
wonder	c
if	c
I	c
can	c
take	c
them	c
as	c
well	c
.	c

Then	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
join	c
the	c
activities	c
,	c
swimming	c
and	c
Singing	c
.	c

I	c
love	c
swimming	c
and	c
also	c
I	c
've	c
got	c
a	c
scubar	i
diving	c
licence	c
.	c

It	i
would	c
be	c
grateful	c
if	c
you	c
sent	c
me	c
more	c
details	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c

Nowadays	c
,	c
most	c
product	i
's	i
prices	c
has	i
gone	c
up	c
with	c
our	c
own	c
country	c
's	c
economy	i
development	c
.	c

Despite	c
the	c
poor	c
material	c
of	c
product	c
,	c
we	c
have	c
to	c
pay	c
much	i
money	c
,	c
even	c
though	c
we	c
completely	i
satisfied	c
shopping	i
at	c
that	c
time	c
,	c
we	c
sometimes	c
regret	c
buying	c
after	c
the	c
shopping	c
.	c

It	c
sounds	c
like	i
foolish	c
.	c

However	c
it	c
often	c
happen	i
.	c

Secondary	i
the	i
customer	i
's	i
service	c
often	c
makes	c
us	c
angry	c
.	c

Of	c
couse	i
,	c
the	c
shopkeepers	c
are	c
human	c
being	i
as	c
well	c
.	c

But	i
for	i
their	i
considerations	i
,	i
they	i
're	i
working	i
in	i
their	i
rutines	i
.	i

I	c
sometimes	c
loose	i
my	c
desire	c
to	c
buy	c
a	c
thing	c
because	c
of	c
their	c
badly	i
behaviers	i
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
shopping	c
is	c
just	c
a	c
part	c
of	c
life	c
style	i
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
for	c
our	c
jobs	c
supecial	i
ceremonys	i
and	i
so	c
on	c
.	c

Even	i
when	i
the	i
risk	i
comes	i
up	i
with	i
shopping	i

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
your	c
advertisement	c
concerning	c
the	c
Musical	c
show	c
:	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
"	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
according	c
to	c
your	c
advertisement	c
,	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
should	c
be	i
one	c
of	c
the	c
stars	c
,	c
instead	c
there	c
was	c
one	i
for	i
me	c
totally	i
unknown	c
actor	c
.	c

To	c
make	c
matters	c
worse	c
the	c
musical	c
started	c
almost	c
one	c
hour	c
later	c
than	c
it	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
start	c
.	c

Your	c
advertisement	c
also	c
failed	c
to	c
mention	c
the	c
fact	c
that	c
there	c
was	i
no	c
discounts	c
what	i
so	i
ever	i
and	c
finally	i
,	c
because	c
of	c
a	c
shortage	c
of	c
staf	i
,	c
your	c
restaurant	c
was	c
not	c
available	i
for	i
us	i
.	c

I	c
suggest	c
a	c
refund	c
of	c
the	c
full	c
price	c
and	c
I	c
hope	c
you	c
are	c
willing	c
to	c
take	c
your	i
responsibilities	i
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

I	c
asked	c
myself	c
how	c
I	c
could	c
be	c
so	c
stupied	i
,	c
telling	c
her	c
my	c
secret	c
after	c
all	c
I	c
been	i
going	c
through	c
to	c
keep	c
it	c
to	c
myself	c
.	c

But	c
now	c
when	i
the	c
story	c
was	c
out	c
,	c
it	i
was	i
just	c
to	i
start	i
to	c
accept	c
it	c
.	c

At	c
once	c
I	c
felt	c
more	c
assertive	c
and	c
a	c
big	c
smile	c
appeared	c
in	i
my	c
face	c
.	c

I	c
decieded	i
to	c
thank	c
Pat	c
,	c
and	c
maybe	c
,	c
if	c
possible	c
,	c
teach	c
her	c
a	c
lession	i
.	c

That	c
evening	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
her	c
house	c
.	c

Finally	c
I	c
smiled	c
.	c

After	c
huging	i
eatch	i
other	c
we	c
promised	c
never	c
to	c
tell	c
others	c
about	c
our	c
secrets	c
.	c

Dear	c
Manager	c

A	c
few	c
days	c
ago	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
Circle	c
theatre	c
to	c
see	c
a	c
musical	c
show	c
which	c
it	i
shows	i
in	c
your	c
theatre	c
now	c
.	c

Also	i
it	i
made	c
me	c
very	c
disappoint	i
.	c

The	c
first	c
one	c
I	c
am	c
going	c
to	c
complaint	i
about	c
is	c
the	c
actor	c
.	c

There	c
was	c
an	i
different	c
actor	c
instead	c
of	c
him	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
the	c
times	c
,	c
it	c
's	c
available	i
14.30	i
and	c
19.30	c
so	c
I	c
choose	i
19.30	c
.	c

Also	c
I	i
had	c
a	c
student	c
identification	c
card	c
to	c
discount	i
the	c
ticket	c
price	c
but	c
it	i
was	i
unavilable	i
to	i
discount	i
.	c

The	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
they	c
said	c
funds	c
are	i
runn	i
out	c
.	c

Those	c
are	c
totally	c
unexpectable	i
so	c
I	c
presume	i
that	i
I	i
would	c
like	c
to	c
get	c
paid	c
for	c
my	c
ticket	c
cost	c
.	c

How	c
has	c
modern	c
technology	c
changed	c
your	c
daily	c
life	c
?	c

Think	c
about	c
the	c
conputer	i
,	c
the	c
speed	c
of	c
conputer	i
is	c
much	c
faster	c
than	c
before	c
.	c

Also	c
T.Vs	c
,	c
I	c
guess	c
that	c
I	c
was	i
not	i
able	c
to	c
watch	c
colour	c
T.V	c
if	c
I	c
was	c
born	c
in	c
1960	c
.	c

T.V	c
colour	c
only	c
consist	i
of	c
white	c
and	c
black	c
.	c

Nowdays	i
the	i
technology	c
is	i
keep	i
develop	i
and	c
the	i
better	c
technology	c
gives	c
us	c
easier	i
life	c
.	c

Another	c
example	c
,	c
the	c
internet	i
.	c

This	c
is	c
revolution	i
which	c
has	c
changed	c
our	c
daily	c
life	c
.	c

You	c
can	c
have	i
a	i
shopping	c
on	c
the	c
internet	i
and	c
it	c
might	c
the	i
fastest	c
way	c
to	c
gather	c
any	c
information	c
you	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
search	i
.	c

However	c
it	i
also	i
can	i
make	c
our	c
life	c
very	c
lazy	c
.	c

People	c
who	c
have	c
their	c
car	i
,	c
they	i
do	c
n't	c
attempt	c
to	c
walk	c
on	i
foot	i
even	c
if	c
it	c
is	c
short	i
distance	c
.	c

The	c
improvement	c
of	c
technology	c
can	c
makes	c
our	c
life	c
easy	c
and	c
in	i
the	i
other	i
way	i
it	c
also	i
can	i
makes	i
our	c
life	c
lazy	c
.	c

Dear	c
the	i
manage	i
of	c
theatre	i
,	c

I	c
really	c
expected	i
the	c
musical	c
show	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
disappointing	c
show	c
.	c

At	i
first	i
,	c
you	i
advertisement	c
said	c
there	c
were	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
had	c
different	c
actor	i
disappointely	i
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
it	c
said	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
at	c
19:30	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
deleyed	i
to	i
20:15	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
to	c
wait	c
45	c
minutes	c
,	c
wasting	c
time	c
.	c

Thirdly	c
,	c
tickets	c
were	c
Â£	c
10	c
,	c
Â£	c
15	c
and	c
Â£	c
20	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
knew	c
that	c
these	c
were	c
available	c
to	i
discount	c
,	c
following	c
the	c
advertisement	c
.	c

But	c
it	c
was	c
impossible	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
n't	c
be	c
satisfied	c
your	i
theatre	c
.	c

With	i
hopeness	i
you	i
understand	c
me	c
.	c

Unfortunely	i
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

At	c
first	c
when	i
he	c
had	c
a	c
girlfriend	c
,	c
they	c
talked	c
to	c
each	c
other	c
franckly	i
.	c

His	c
girl	i
friend	i
talked	c
to	c
him	c
everything	i
.	c

If	c
he	c
had	c
told	c
everybody	c
,	c
J	c
would	c
have	c
been	c
blamed	c
by	c
whole	i
school	c
.	c

Actually	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
on	c
his	i
purpose	c
.	c

But	c
sometimes	c
,	c
Pat	c
mistakes	i
to	i
speak	i
someone	c
's	c
secrets	c
.	c

Though	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
on	c
his	i
purpose	c
,	c
it	c
makes	c
his	c
friends	c
leave	c
him	c
.	c

Pat	c
also	c
regrets	c
about	i
his	c
speaking	i
.	c

It	c
could	c
be	c
difficult	c
for	c
him	c
to	c
change	c
himself	c
.	c

During	c
my	c
holidays	c
in	c
London	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
see	c
your	c
musical	c
show	c
.	c

But	c
someone	c
else	c
participated	i
instead	c
of	c
him	c
.	c

The	c
second	c
problem	c
was	c
the	c
start	c
of	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

It	c
began	c
at	c
20:15	c
and	c
not	c
at	c
19:30	c
!	c

That	c
's	c
almost	c
an	c
hour	c
later	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
read	c
that	c
there	c
would	c
be	c
available	i
some	i
discounts	i
,	c
but	c
I	c
became	i
none	c
of	c
them	c
.	c

The	c
restaurant	c
should	c
had	i
been	c
oppened	i
when	c
I	c
came	c
out	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
hour	i
the	c
show	c
finished	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
n't	c
a	c
perfect	c
evening	c
at	c
all	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
can	c
understand	c
my	c
disappointment	c
and	c
ask	i
for	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

Faithfully	c

In	i
our	i
days	i
,	c
nobody	c
can	c
live	c
without	c
technology	c

The	c
timer	i
of	i
my	c
radio	c
wakes	c
me	c
up	c
at	c
half	c
past	c
six	c
.	c

After	c
breakfeast	i
I	c
have	c
to	c
use	c
my	c
car	c
to	c
get	c
to	c
school	c
.	c

At	c
school	c
the	c
computer	c
has	c
become	c
an	c
important	c
new	c
tool	c
.	c

I	c
use	c
it	c
to	c
make	i
compositions	i
,	c
to	c
print	c
some	c
pictures	c
or	c
to	c
surf	c
on	i
the	c

Without	c
these	i

I	c
would	c
get	c
realy	i
bored	c

Now	c
,	c
I	c
loose	i
less	c

and	c
can	c
use	c
the	i

to	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
:	c

I	c
am	c
rather	c
good	c
at	c
these	c
sports	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
practised	i
them	c
since	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
little	c
girl	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
and	c
what	c
type	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
need	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
be	c
very	c
thankful	i
to	c
recieve	i
answers	c
to	c
my	c
questions	c
.	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
:	c

How	c
are	c
you	c
?	c

I	c
'm	c
fine	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
all	c
about	c
the	c
pop	c
concert	c
I	c
helped	c
to	c
organize	c
last	c
month	c
.	c

it	i
was	c
really	c
cool	c
.	c

I	c
got	c
the	c
chance	c
to	c
meet	c
Ricky	c
Martin	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
in	c
charge	c
of	c
the	c
lights	i
of	i
the	i
stage	i
,	c
you	c
know	c
,	c
all	c
those	c
colourful	c
lights	c
that	c
go	c
all	c
around	c
the	c
stage	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
to	c
learn	c
what	c
part	c
of	c
the	c
stage	c
had	c
to	c
be	c
lightened	i
with	c
a	c
blue	c
light	c
or	i
a	c
green	c
one	c
.	c

Even	c
though	c
I	c
ended	c
terribly	i
tired	c
I	c
really	c
enjoyed	c
myself	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
never	c
even	c
gone	c
to	c
a	c
concert	c
before	c
.	c

I	c
even	c
got	c
the	c
chance	c
to	c
take	c
some	c
photographs	c
of	c
ricky	c
Martin	c
with	c
my	c
sister	c
and	c
I	c
've	c
got	c
one	c
photo	c
of	c
him	c
with	c
me	c
!	c
!	c

Well	c
,	c
its	c
an	c
experience	c
I	c
'll	c
never	c
forget	c
as	c
long	c
as	c
I	c
live	c
.	c

Write	c
to	c
me	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c
,	c
please	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
your	i
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
called	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
"	c

As	c
a	c
matter	c
of	c
fact	c
,	c
I	c
waited	i
for	i
seeing	i
Danny	c
Brook	c
who	i
I	c
appreciate	c
a	c
lot	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
disappointed	c
that	c
he	c
was	c
n't	c
here	i
.	c

Besides	c
,	c
the	c
actor	c
who	c
filled	c
him	i
in	i
was	c
unknown	c
and	c
specially	c
boring	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
had	i
to	c
begin	c
at	c
19.30	c
pm	c
,	c
in	i
fact	i
he	i
began	c
at	c
20.15	c
pm	c
and	c
that	c
without	i
any	c
explainations	i
!	c

After	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
visit	c
your	c
restaurant	c
and	c
once	i
again	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
disappointed	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

Anybody	i
could	c
explain	c
to	c
me	c
why	c
!	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c
.	c

My	c
daily	c
life	c
changed	c
in	c
some	c
ways	c
when	c
I	c
got	i
the	i
hand	i
of	i
using	c
new	c
technologies	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
to	c
work	c
out	c
all	c
my	c
figures	c
two	c
times	c
to	c
make	c
sure	c
that	c
my	c
accounts	c
were	c
accurate	c
.	c

Now	c
,	c
I	c
enter	c
datas	i
and	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
need	c
any	i
more	i
to	i
calculate	i
my	i
figures	i
,	c
the	c
work	c
is	c
completely	i
made	i
by	c
the	i
computer	c
and	c
in	c
addition	c
there	c
is	i
no	c
mistake	i
.	c

If	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
find	c
out	i
timetables	i
,	c
it	c
is	c
very	c
useful	c
to	c
have	c
the	c
possibility	i
to	c
see	c
on	i
the	c
Internet	c
,	c
besides	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
the	c
quickest	c
way	c
!	c

At	i
the	c
beginning	c
,	c
I	c
wasted	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
time	c
getting	c
some	c
information	c
I	c
needed	c
because	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
know	c
exactly	c
where	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
look	c
for	c
.	i

But	c
after	c
a	c
while	c
you	c
gain	c
experience	c
and	c
you	c
get	i
soon	i
used	c
to	c
this	c
kind	c
of	c
research	c
.	c

Once	c
,	c
I	c
saw	c
an	c
accident	c
and	c
I	c
could	c
call	c
the	c
police	c
.	c

Sometimes	c
the	c
ring	c
is	c
annoying	c
but	c
finally	i
,	c
the	c
mobil	i
phone	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
handy	i
object	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs.	c
Ryan	c
,	c

in	i
your	c
letter	c
I	c
received	c
a	c
few	c
days	c
ago	c
,	c
you	c
asked	c
me	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
some	c
more	c
information	c
concerning	c
my	c
journey	i
to	c
the	c
U.S.A	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
a	c
teacher	c
in	c
Vienna	c
,	i
my	i
holiday	c
starts	c
on	c
July	c
1st	c
.	c

For	c
August	c
I	c
booked	c
a	c
journey	i
to	c
Greece	c
with	c
my	c
wife	c
.	c

Tents	c
remind	c
me	c
of	c
the	c
time	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
at	i
the	c
army	c
-	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
log	i
cabin	c
for	c
my	c
stay	c
in	c
the	c
camp	c
.	c

Swimming	c
is	c
an	c
activity	c
I	c
do	i
since	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
boy	c
,	i
I	c
still	c
enjoy	c
swimming	c
especially	i
when	c
it	c
's	c
in	c
the	c
sea	c
,	c
although	c
I	c
never	c
took	c
part	c
in	c
competition	i
,	c
that	i
means	c
I	c
do	i
swimming	c
just	c
for	c
fun	c
.	c

The	c
other	c
activity	c
I	c
choose	c
is	c
Photography	i
.	c

I	c
think	c
there	c
are	c
no	c
more	c
questions	c
I	i
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
seeing	c
you	c
.	c

Yours	c

I	c
'm	c
the	c
teacher	c
of	c
that	i
class	i
.	c

-	c
I	c
start	c
the	c
day	c
by	c
greeting	c
the	c
children	c
and	c
they	c
answer	c
-	c
in	c
English	c
,	c
of	c
course	c
.	c

-	c
Later	c
on	c
we	c
'll	c
go	i
to	i
sing	i
the	c
song	c
of	i
"	c
Old	c
McDonald	c
had	c
a	c
farm	c
"	c
.	c

-	c
Some	c
sequences	c
of	i
the	c
gym-lesson	i
should	c
conclude	c
the	c
part	c
of	c
the	c
film	c
showing	c
the	c
children	c
at	c
work	c
,	c
but	c
there	c
should	c
follow	c
another	c
short	c
part	c
that	c
presents	i
how	c
children	i
have	c
their	c
lunch	c
and	c
spend	c
their	c
free-time	i
,	c
what	c
games	c
they	c
play	c
in	c
the	c
school-yard	i
and	c
how	c
they	c
have	i
contact	i
with	c
each	c
other	c
.	c

The	c
whole	c
film	c
when	c
it	c
's	c
finished	c
will	c
last	c
for	c
about	c
half	c
an	c
hour	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
musical	c
show	i
"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
,	c
that	i
I	c
went	c
to	c
see	c
on	c
the	c
16th	c
of	c
June	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
the	c
actor	c
suppossed	i
to	c
be	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
but	c
he	c
was	c
not	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
another	c
actor	c
,	c
who	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
seen	c
before	c
,	c
so	c
,	c
as	c
you	c
can	c
imagen	i
,	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
disappointed	c
.	c

Another	c
complain	i
is	c
about	c
the	c
time	c
that	c
the	c
musical	i
show	c
started	c
,	i
the	i
advertisement	c
said	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
19:30	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
did	c
not	c
,	i
we	i
had	c
to	c
wait	c
45	c
minutes	c
.	c

Now	c
,	c
about	c
the	c
tickets	c
,	c
the	i
were	c
different	c
prices	c
but	c
there	c
were	c
not	i
discounts	c
,	c
and	c
because	c
of	c
this	c
,	c
many	c
people	c
could	c
not	c
see	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
especially	c
students	c
.	c

Pat	c
,	c
Maria	c
's	c
best	c
friend	c

Maria	c
talked	c
to	c
Pat	c
about	c
the	c
stupid	c
thing	c
that	c
she	c
did	i
,	c
but	c
Pat	c
refused	c
to	c
apologaising	i
to	c
her	c
,	c
because	c
she	c
felt	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
a	c
mistake	c
and	c
she	c
did	c
it	c
for	c
only	c
one	c
reason	c
:	c
help	i
Maria	c
to	c
get	c
the	c
man	c
that	c
she	c
loved	c
.	c

Maria	c
was	c
speechless	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
the	c
first	c
time	c
that	c
she	c
did	c
n't	c
know	c
what	c
to	c
do	c
,	c
so	c
she	c
decided	c
to	c
stop	c
talking	c
to	c
Pat	c
.	c

After	c
3	c
weeks	c
,	c
Maria	c
got	c
ill	c
so	c
she	c
was	c
not	c
available	i
to	c
go	c
to	c
school	c
.	c

Some	i
friends	i
phoned	c
her	c
everyday	i
,	c
except	c
Pat	c
,	c
the	c
only	c
friend	c
that	c
Maria	c
really	c
loved	c
,	i
despite	i
that	c
,	c
she	c
was	c
not	c
sad	c
.	c

One	c
day	c
,	c
when	c
Maria	c
was	c
seating	i
in	c
her	c
bedroom	c
,	c
someone	c
knock	i
the	i
door	c
,	i
it	i
was	c
Manuel	c
,	i
he	i
was	c
worried	c
for	i
her	c
.	c

Maria	c
was	c
nervous	c
,	c
but	c
for	i
the	c
first	c
time	c
,	c
she	c
could	c
talk	c
to	c
him	c
as	c
she	c
never	c
did	i
before	c
,	c
and	c
at	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
the	c
day	c
,	c
she	c
was	c
the	c
happiest	c
person	c
of	i
the	c
world	c
,	i
she	i
gave	i
her	c
first	c
kiss	c
and	c
she	c
had	c
Pat	c
's	c
friendship	c
back	c
,	i
after	c
all	c
,	c
everything	c
happened	c
because	c
of	c
her	c
.	c

Therefore	c
,	c
July	c
is	c
my	c
last	c
free	c
month	c
until	c
much	c
later	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
during	c
the	c
camp	c
,	c
as	c
I	c
find	c
tents	c
a	c
lot	c
more	c
exciting	c
than	c
log	c
cabins	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
a	c
very	c
good	c
swimmer	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
choose	c
swimming	c
from	c
the	c
activities	c
you	c
listed	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
also	c
very	c
keen	c
on	c
climbing	c
,	c
although	c
I	c
am	c
not	c
extremely	c
good	c
at	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
also	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
am	c
supposed	c
to	c
take	c
with	c
me	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
be	c
glad	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
give	c
me	c
an	c
answer	c
before	c
the	c
camp	c
begins	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

But	c
not	c
me	c
.	c

Eventually	c
,	c
after	c
long	c
seeking	i
you	c
find	c
a	c
skirt	c
you	c
like	c
.	c

But	c
it	c
does	c
n't	c
fit	c
.	c

And	c
finally	c
,	c
after	c
a	c
few	c
more	c
hours	c
,	c
you	c
buy	c
the	c
skirt	c
of	c
your	c
dreams	c
.	c

And	c
suddenly	c
you	c
notice	c
the	c
identical	c
but	c
cheaper	c
one	c
in	c
the	c
next	c
shop	c
.	c

Accident	i
like	c
that	c
can	c
really	c
make	c
you	c
livid	c
.	c

At	c
last	c
you	c
come	c
back	c
home	c
,	c
carrying	c
the	c
most	c
beautiful	c
skirt	c
in	c
the	c
whole	c
town	c
.	c

You	c
phone	c
your	c
friend	c
to	c
visit	c
you	c
and	c
your	c
friend	c
come	i
,	c
wearing	c
the	i
skirt	c
not	c
unlike	c
the	c
one	c
you	c
have	c
just	c
bought	c
.	c

You	c
can	c
always	c
go	c
and	c
buy	c
a	c
new	c
one	c
.	c

In	c
August	c
I	c
'll	c
be	c
working	c
,	c
so	c
that	i
it	c
will	c
be	c
impossible	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
enjoy	c
my	c
prize	c
during	c
this	i
month	c
.	c

My	c
two	c
activities	c
chosen	c
from	c
the	c
list	c
are	c
climbing	c
and	c
surfing	c
.	c

In	c
surfing	c
learning	i
wo	c
n't	c
be	c
a	c
problem	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
doing	c
it	c
since	c
I	c
was	c
ten	c
years	c
old	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Nowadays	c
shopping	c
is	c
considered	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
most	c
usual	c
and	c
enjoyable	c
activities	c
,	c
especially	c
if	c
you	c
are	c
a	c
woman	c
and	c
you	c
are	c
out	c
to	c
buy	c
clothes	c
.	c

At	c
first	c
sight	c
it	c
is	c
,	c
but	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

Basing	c
my	c
opinion	c
on	c
my	c
experience	c
I	i
'm	c
going	c
to	c
talk	c
mostly	c
about	c
clothes	c
shopping	c
.	c

There	c
are	c
some	c
points	c
that	c
give	i
me	i
the	i
reason	i
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
who	c
is	c
your	c
companion	c
?	c

If	c
you	c
take	c
mum	i
shopping	c
the	c
right	i
day	c
she	i
has	c
been	c
all	i
day	i
doing	i
housework	i
,	c
that	c
will	c
probably	c
end	c
in	c
discussion	i
.	c

How	c
do	i
you	c
pretend	i
to	c
see	c
in	c
a	c
mirror	c
that	c
anything	c
fits	c
well	i
on	i
you	i
?	c

Who	c
would	c
talk	c
now	c
about	c
enjoyable	c
shopping	c
journeys	i
?	c

I	c
'm	c
sure	c
there	c
would	c
be	c
plenty	c
of	c
people	c
ready	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
.	c

Sir	i
manager	c

Yesterday	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
"	c
The	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
"	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
"	c
OVER	c
THE	c
RAINBOW	c
"	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
very	c
disappointed	c
of	i
this	c
evening	c
.	c

And	c
when	c
it	c
finaly	i
started	c
,	c
there	i
was	c
n't	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
who	c
plaied	i
.	c

After	c
the	c
show	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
drink	c
somthing	i
in	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
but	c
when	c
I	c
arrived	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
to	i
late	c
!	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

I	c
told	c
her	c
that	c
my	c
parents	c
are	c
getting	c
divorsed	i
and	c
that	c
I	c
will	c
move	c
to	c
Chicago	c
with	c
my	c
mother	c
.	c

We	c
are	c
together	i
in	i
High	i
School	i
in	c
California	c
and	c
this	c
is	c
our	c
last	c
year	c
.	c

We	c
wanted	c
to	c
study	c
biology	c
here	c
in	c
Los	c
Angeles	c
with	c
some	c
other	c
friends	c
but	c
now	c
my	c
plans	c
have	c
changed	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
leave	c
them	c
.	c

One	c
day	c
,	c
Pat	c
and	c
I	c
were	c
going	c
home	c
,	c
when	c
she	c
asked	c
me	c
,	i
if	c
I	c
will	i
give	c
a	c
party	c
befor	i
I	i
'll	i
go	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
to	c
tell	c
her	c
that	c
I	c
do	i
n't	i
have	c
the	c
time	c
to	c
organise	c
anything	c
becaus	i
we	c
,	c
my	c
mother	c
and	c
I	c
,	c
have	i
to	c
get	c
our	c
stuff	c
ready	c
to	c
move	c
.	c

I	c
thought	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
good	c
idea	c
and	c
we	c
went	c
home	c
.	c

But	c
when	c
we	c
get	i
into	c
the	c
hous	i
ther	i
were	c
all	c
my	c
friends	c
!	c

We	c
had	c
a	c
great	c
evening	c
becaus	i
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
!	c

However	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
may	i
other	c
interesting	c
places	c
and	c
exhibitions	c
to	c
see	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
a	c
coinsidence	i
which	c
we	c
would	c
be	c
extremely	c
happy	c
to	c
take	c
advantage	c
on	i
.	c

This	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
for	c
us	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
latest	c
fashions	c
and	c
famous	c
fashion	c
models	c
who	c
we	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
have	c
authograps	i
from	c
.	c

We	c
hope	c
changing	c
the	c
excursion	c
program	i
a	c
little	c
will	c
not	c
cause	c
any	c
problems	c
.	c

Our	c
suggestion	c
is	c
to	c
visit	c
Science	i
Museum	c
on	c
Wednesday	c
afternoon	c
instead	c
of	c
Tuesday	c
.	c

Because	c
the	c
fashion	c
show	c
lasts	c
a	c
whole	c
day	c
long	i
.	c

The	c
show	c
starts	c
on	c
14th	c
March	c
at	c
10.00	c
and	c
ends	c
at	c
19.00	c
the	c
same	c
day	c
.	c

We	c
are	c
sorry	c
for	c
any	c
inconvenience	c
caused	c
by	c
our	c
request	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	i

Famous	c
people	c
are	c
living	c
creatures	c
.	c

They	c
breathe	c
,	c
eat	c
,	c
feel	c
and	c
beside	i
that	i
they	c
are	c
famous	c
they	c
are	c
just	c
the	c
same	c
as	c
anyone	c
else	c
.	c

I	c
personally	c
think	c
the	c
best	c
would	i
be	c
to	c
put	c
the	c
celebrities	c
in	c
cages	c
and	c
let	c
people	c
touch	c
them	c
,	c
point	c
and	c
ask	c
for	c
authopraps	i
.	c

The	c
biggest	c
commercial	c
gain	i
in	c
history	c
I	i
believe	c
,	c
but	c
celebrities	c
are	c
not	c
animals	c
although	c
they	c
may	c
be	c
sometimes	c
treated	c
the	c
same	c
way	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
they	c
must	c
have	c
done	c
something	c
to	c
become	c
famous	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writting	i
to	c
give	c
the	c
information	c
you	c
asked	c
me	c
and	i
also	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
required	i
some	c
information	c
about	c
the	c
prize	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
I	c
would	i
let	c
you	c
know	c
I	c
could	c
travel	c
only	c
on	i
July	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
the	c
time	i
that	c
I	c
have	c
holidays	c
from	c
my	c
school	c
.	c

Finally	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
if	c
I	c
need	c
a	i
special	c
clothes	c
and	c
Do	i
I	c
need	c
money	i
?	c

Please	c
if	i
you	c
require	c
extra	c
information	c
do	c
not	c
hesitate	c
to	c
contact	c
me	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

Anyway	c
now	i
I	c
am	c
going	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
everything	c
about	c
it	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
know	c
I	i
have	c
always	c
taken	c
the	c
freeway	c
on	c
Sundays	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
my	c
grandparents	c
'	c
house	c
,	c
but	c
that	c
Sunday	c
I	c
was	c
driving	c
when	c
suddenly	c
I	c
saw	c
in	c
the	c
lay-by	c
one	c
excellent	c
car	c
.	c

He	c
had	c
a	c
puncture	c
wheel	i
and	c
he	c
did	c
n't	c
know	c
how	c
to	c
repeared	i
then	i
I	c
chanced	i
the	c
wheel	i
and	c
during	c
this	c
time	c
he	c
was	c
asking	c
me	c
for	i
my	c
hobbies	c
,	c
studies	c
,	c
everything	c
.	c

He	c
was	c
really	c
kind	c
and	c
friendly	c
but	c
really	c
what	c
I	c
really	c
most	i
enjoyed	i
of	i
it	c
,	i
was	c
when	c
he	c
invited	c
me	c
this	i
night	c
for	c
a	c
drink	c
in	i
the	c
most	c
luxury	i
pub	c
I	c
have	c
ever	c
been	c
.	i

Could	i
you	c
believe	c
my	c
luck	c
?	c

All	c
right	c
that	c
's	c
about	c
all	c
my	c
news	c
,	c

Lots	c
of	c
love	c

I	c
am	c
writting	i
to	c
you	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
some	c
details	c
you	c
asked	c
me	c
for	c
in	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
that	c
it	c
is	c
only	c
possible	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
going	c
to	c
move	c
to	c
Spain	c
in	c
August	c
.	c

About	c
my	c
accommodation	c
prefers	i
,	c
I	c
would	c
really	c
like	c
to	c
be	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
funny	i
to	c
play	c
basketball	c
after	c
five	i
years	c
;	c
and	c
since	c
I	c
go	c
out	c
to	c
the	c
mountains	c
once	c
a	c
month	c
,	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
think	c
I	c
would	c
have	c
any	c
problem	c
with	c
climbing	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
some	c
questions	c
:	c
Could	c
you	c
tell	c
me	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
would	c
be	c
addecuate	i
for	c
these	c
two	c
weeks	c
?	c

How	c
much	c
money	c
do	c
you	c
think	c
I	c
should	c
bring	c
with	c
me	c
?	c

Thank	c
you	c
once	c
again	c
for	c
your	c
attention	c
and	c
interest	c
.	c

As	c
I	c
told	c
you	c
in	c
my	c
last	c
letter	c
,	c
I	c
worked	c
two	c
weeks	c
ago	c
in	c
Edinburgh	c
helping	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
.	c

We	c
also	c
had	c
time	c
to	c
tell	c
jokes	c
and	c
play	c
with	c
water	c
balloons	c
.	c

The	c
most	c
exhiting	i
thing	c
was	c
when	c
we	c
removed	c
all	c
the	c
stuff	c
the	c
day	c
after	c
the	c
concert	c
,	c
and	c
we	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
Highlands	c
to	c
spend	c
the	c
whole	c
day	c
.	i

That	c
was	c
fantactic	i
!	c

If	c
you	c
have	c
never	c
been	c
there	c
,	c
I	c
enormous	i
recemmend	i
you	c
to	c
go	c
.	c

Even	i
I	i
played	c
the	c
drums	c
there	c
!	c

My	c
name	c
is	c
.	c

.	c
.	c

During	c
our	c
stay	c
we	c
saw	c
a	c
bright	i
advertisement	c
of	i
your	c
theatre	c
and	c
decided	c
to	c
see	c
this	c
newest	i
and	c
best	c
musical	c
show	c
(	c
as	c
it	c
was	i
said	i
in	c
you	i
advertisement	c
)	c
.	c

Actually	c
.	i

In	c
your	c
ad	i
was	i
said	i
that	c
in	c
main	i
roles	c
would	i
be	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
.	c

Danny	c
was	c
n't	c
there	c
!	c

Instead	c
there	c
was	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
whose	c
play	i
was	c
disappointing	c
.	c

For	c
all	c
these	c
reasons	c
I	i
would	c
like	c
you	c
to	c
give	c
me	c
at	c
least	c
half	c
of	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

With	i
hope	i
for	i
a	i
mutual	i
agreement	i
,	c
Mrs.	c
(	c
...	c
)	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
May	c
,	i
15	c
-	c
our	c
english	i
teacher	c
's	c
birthday	c
.	c

Month	i
ago	i
we	c
began	c
to	c
prepare	c
for	c
this	c
day	c
and	c
we	c
all	c
agreed	c
to	c
keep	c
it	c
in	i
a	c
secret	c
.	c

We	c
have	i
been	i
discussing	i
for	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
what	c
to	c
present	i
her	c
.	c

There	c
were	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
proposals	c
from	c
the	c
students	c
:	c
one	c
proposed	i
a	c
vase	c
,	c
another	c
-	i
a	c
good	c
pen	c
(	c
he	c
said	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
useful	c
for	c
the	c
teacher	c
)	c
.	c

But	c
we	c
decided	c
to	c
buy	c
a	c
picture	c
,	c
because	c
she	c
has	i
always	i
told	i
us	c
about	c
art	c
galleries	c
with	c
a	i
great	c
exitement	i
.	c

We	c
also	c
decided	c
to	c
arrange	c
a	c
party	c
on	c
her	c
birthday	c
(	c
and	c
it	c
had	c
to	c
be	c
a	c
surprise	c
too	c
)	c
.	c

A	i
day	c
before	c
her	c
birthday	c
we	c
had	c
an	c
English	c
lesson	c
,	c
and	c
after	c
the	c
lesson	c
Pat	c
came	i
up	c
to	c
Marion	c
and	c
told	c
her	c
about	c
our	c
surprise	c
.	c

Dear	c
the	i
manager	c

I	c
went	c
to	c
see	c
a	c
musical	c
show	c
last	c
Wednesday	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
a	c
very	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
advertisement	c
you	c
said	c
"	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
"	c
is	c
the	c
actor	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
.	i

It	c
was	c
somebody	c
else	c
.	c

I	c
went	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
show	c
because	c
I	c
like	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
.	c

The	c
show	c
supposted	i
to	c
start	c
at	c
19.30	c
pm	c
but	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
20.15	c
pm.	c
It	c
was	c
very	c
late	c
.	c

Staff	c
did	c
not	c
tell	c
us	c
why	c
it	c
started	c
late	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
bought	c
tickets	c
,	c
they	c
did	i
not	i
discount	i
at	c
all	c
.	c

They	c
ignored	c
me	c
.	c

We	c
bought	c
tickets	c
without	c
discount	i
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
that	i
they	c
discount	i
for	i
somebody	c
else	c
or	c
not	c
.	c

After	c
the	c
show	c
we	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
but	c
it	c
closed	i
.	c

It	c
closed	c
at	c
11	c
pm.	c
It	c
was	c
not	c
our	c
fault	c
that	c
we	c
went	c
in	c
after	c
11	c
pm.	c
The	c
show	c
finished	c
late	c
.	c

The	c
restaurant	c
should	c
open	i
until	c
the	c
show	c
finish	i
.	c

Could	c
I	c
please	c
have	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
?	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
disappointed	c
about	c
this	c
.	c

Yours	c
sinecerely	i

Sally	c

Smith	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

She	c
is	c
one	c
of	c
my	c
friend	i
at	c
school	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
want	c
her	c
to	c
keep	c
it	i
secrets	i
,	c
do	c
not	c
tell	c
her	c
.	c

She	c
always	c
tells	c
someone	c
else	c
about	c
it	c
.	c

Last	c
week	c
,	c
Tim	c
told	c
Pat	c
about	c
his	c
serious	c
problem	c
.	c

He	c
wanted	c
Pat	c
to	c
keep	c
it	c
between	c
them	c
but	c
Pat	c
did	c
not	c
keep	c
his	i
promise	c
.	c

She	c
told	c
us	c
about	c
it	c
.	c

When	c
Tim	c
found	c
out	c
that	c
we	c
knew	c
his	c
problem	c
and	c
tried	i
to	c
help	c
him	c
.	c

He	c
was	c
very	c
angry	c
with	c
Pat	c
.	c

He	c
was	i
n't	i
talk	c
to	c
Pat	c
at	c
all	c
.	c

Basically	c
,	c
Tim	c
did	c
not	c
know	c
that	c
Pat	c
was	c
not	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

She	c
did	i
not	c
know	c
when	i
she	i
can	i
speak	i
or	i
not	i
speak	i
.	c

We	c
so	i
worry	i
about	c
her	c
in	i
the	i
future	c
.	c

She	c
has	c
not	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
friend	i
because	c
of	c
this	c
point	i
.	c

It	c
was	c
dangerous	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
knew	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
it	c

I	c
knew	c
,	i
I	c
would	c
not	c
come	c
this	i
world	c
again	c
,	c
everyone	c
has	c
only	c
one	c
change	i
to	c
do	c
whatever	c
they	c
want	c

I	c
come	c
from	c
very	i
ruler	i
family	c
.	c

You	c
had	i
never	c
made	c
on	i
your	i
own	i
decision	i
,	c
you	c
always	c
had	c
to	c
ask	c
your	c
family	c
's	c
opinion	c
.	c

During	c
the	i
this	i
years	c
I	c
had	c
met	c
with	i
Zuhal	c
Olcoy	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
seen	c
her	c
every	c
morning	c
while	i
I	c
was	c
going	c
to	c
school	c
.	c

In	c
that	c
way	c
I	c
had	i
been	i
able	c
to	c
see	c
her	c
every	c
morning	c
.	c

The	c
more	c
seeing	i
her	i
I	i
could	i
,	c
the	c
more	c
ambitious	i
I	c
became	c
.	c

At	c
last	c
I	c
met	c
wit	i
her	c
.	c

She	c
had	i
invited	i
me	c
her	i
play	c
to	i
the	c
theatre	c
.	c

She	c
was	c
the	c
only	c
person	c
who	c
encourage	i
me	c
to	c
be	c
a	i
actress	c
.	c

I	c
had	i
had	i
a	i
exam	c
for	c
being	i
theatre	c
players	i
without	c
saying	i
my	c
family	c
.	c

Otherwise	c
my	c
father	c
could	i
kill	i
me	c
and	c
not	c
let	c
me	c
to	i
go	i
to	c
school	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
never	c
ever	c
go	c
to	c
school	c
again	c
.	c

Despite	c
of	i
the	i
preparing	c
the	i
exams	c
,	c
I	c
had	i
been	i
continue	i
to	i
my	c
school	c
regularly	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
my	c
dream	c
I	i

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c

I	c
am	c
shocked	c
that	c
I	c
won	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
this	c
competition	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
inform	c
you	c
that	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
.	c

The	c
reason	c
is	c
that	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
full-time	c
student	c
on	i
Cracow	c
University	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
many	c
exams	c
at	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
semester	i
,	c
which	c
is	c
in	c
June	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
that	c
it	c
is	c
not	c
a	c
problem	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
you	c
to	c
know	c
that	c
I	c
prefer	c
a	c
tent	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
much	c
better	c
than	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
.	c

Aspecially	i
in	c
the	c
summer	c
when	c
tempereture	i
and	c
humidity	c
are	c
very	c
high	c
.	c

From	c
the	c
list	c
of	c
all	c
activities	i
I	c
have	c
choosen	i
photography	c
and	c
golf	c
.	c

Since	c
secondary	c
school	c
I	c
am	i
very	c
interested	c
in	c
taking	c
pictures	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
a	i
big	i
experience	c
in	i
it	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
choosen	i
golf	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
played	c
in	i
this	c
game	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
waiting	c
for	c
your	c
reply	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
really	c
very	c
nice	c
.	c

Here	c
it	c
comes	c
...	c

My	c
friend	c
offered	c
me	c
a	c
job	c
as	c
a	c
member	c
of	c
techical	i
staff	c
on	i
Sting	c
's	c
concert	c
.	c

I	c
love	c
his	c
music	c
and	c
I	c
collect	c
his	c
albums	c
so	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
happy	c
that	c
I	c
helped	c
his	c
crew	c
.	c

We	c
've	c
built	c
it	c
using	c
ready	c
metal	c
and	c
wodden	i
parts	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
really	c
big	c
and	c
impressive	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
working	c
with	c
a	c
specialist	c
who	c
had	c
to	c
connect	c
all	c
lights	i
together	c
to	c
one	c
computer	c
and	c
prepare	c
a	c
colorful	i
show	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
hard	c
and	c
complicated	c
job	c
but	c
we	c
all	c
had	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
satisfaction	c
during	c
the	c
concert	c
.	c

Even	c
Mr.	c
Sting	c
came	c
to	c
us	c
to	c
thank	c
for	i
our	c
help	c
.	c

Rafael	c

I	c
spent	c
two	c
nice	c
days	c
watching	c
its	c
events	c
.	c

We	c
have	c
similar	c
interests	c
but	c
we	c
have	c
different	c
opinions	c
.	c

For	c
me	c
-	c
dances	i
shows	c
were	c
absolutelly	i
wonderful	c
.	c

Dancers	i
worn	i
nice	c
clothes	c
,	c
the	i
music	c
was	c
very	c
good	c
.	c

I	c
prefere	i
them	c
to	c
others	c
.	c

We	c
also	c
listened	c
to	c
the	c
concerts	c
but	c
in	c
our	c
opinion	c
the	c
concert	c
halls	c
were	c
too	c
small	c
.	c

During	c
the	c
jazz	c
and	c
rock	c
concerts	c
the	c
audience	c
wants	c
to	c
play	c
and	c
dance	c
so	c
it	i
needs	i
more	c
room	c
.	c

I	c
like	c
listening	c
to	c
the	i
classical	c
music	c
in	c
the	c
big	c
halls	c
,	c
too	c
.	c

My	c
boyfriend	c
was	c
exciting	i
about	c
the	c
art	c
exhibitions	c
and	c
listening	c
to	c
the	c
writers	c
.	c

We	c
had	c
no	c
time	c
to	c
watch	c
all	c
plays	i
and	c
films	c
.	c

We	c
chose	c
some	c
of	c
them	c
and	c
we	c
were	c
glad	c
that	c
we	c
had	c
our	c
reasonably	c
ticket	i
for	c
all	c
evants	i
because	c
we	c
could	c
change	c
our	c
planes	i
during	c
the	c
evant	i
.	c

I	c
suggest	c
to	i
organize	i
next	i
IAF	c
in	c
the	c
summer	c
.	c

We	c
are	c
both	c
students	c
so	c
we	c
have	c
our	c
holiday	c
from	c
July	c
to	c
September	c
.	c

We	c
have	c
more	c
free	c
time	c
in	c
the	c
summer	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
an	c
unusual	c
event	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Dear	c
Monte	c
,	c

I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
write	c
about	c
rules	c
in	c
Poland	c
.	c

Our	c
lessons	c
start	c
at	c
8	c
a.m	i
and	c
we	c
are	c
n't	c
allowed	c
to	c
be	c
late	c
.	c

We	c
have	c
to	c
change	c
our	c
shoes	c
.	c

We	c
can	c
wear	c
what	c
we	c
want	c
.	c

Most	c
of	i
studenst	i
wear	c
jeans	c
and	c
sweaters	i
.	c

We	c
have	c
to	c
be	c
quiet	c
during	c
the	i
lessons	c
and	c
our	c
lessons	c
are	c
boring	c
because	c
of	c
it	c
.	c

It	i
is	c
what	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
change	c
.	c

I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
leave	c
my	c
books	c
at	c
school	c
.	c

At	c
home	c
we	c
have	c
to	c
do	c
our	c
homework	c
.	c

There	c
's	c
always	c
much	c
to	c
do	c
so	c
we	c
have	c
no	c
free	c
time	c
at	c
all	c
.	c

Our	c
parents	c
want	c
us	c
to	c
be	c
clever	c
.	c

On	c
Sundays	c
we	c
have	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
bed	c
early	c
because	c
on	c
Monday	c
our	c
school	c
starts	c
at	c
8	c
in	c
the	c
morning	c
.	c

We	c
sometimes	c
help	c
in	c
the	c
house	c
but	c
it	c
is	c
n't	c
neccessary	i
.	c

We	c
are	c
n't	c
allowed	c
to	c
smoke	c
and	i
drink	c
any	c
alcohol	c
.	c

We	c
are	c
n't	c
allowed	c
to	c
argue	c
with	c
our	c
parents	c
and	c
teachers	c
It	i
is	c
also	c
horrible	c
.	c

We	c
mus	i
n't	i
talk	c
to	c
them	c
but	c
only	i
listen	c
to	c
them	c

I	c

Dear	c
:	i
Jane	c
Clark	c

I	c
had	i
been	i
your	i
annual	c
international	c
art	c
festival	c
.	c

Most	c
of	c
the	c
events	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
were	c
good	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
feel	c
that	c
the	c
festival	c
could	c
be	c
even	c
better	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
I	c
write	i
some	i
of	i
my	i
opionions	i
and	i
suggestions	i
to	i
you	i
.	c

I	c
hope	c
it	i
's	i
may	i
help	c
for	i
next	c
year	c
's	c
festival	c
.	c

The	c
idea	c
of	c
"	i
International	c
Art	c
Festival	c
"	c
was	c
great	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
feel	c
the	c
word	c
of	i
"	c
International	c
"	c
was	c
not	c
really	c
suit	i
;	c
because	c
you	c
just	i
only	c
got	i
six	c
countrie	i
's	i
stars	c
and	c
artists	c
came	i
.	c

The	c
other	c
problem	c
was	c
choosing	i
space	i
.	c

Like	c
the	c
hall	c
of	c
classical	i
concert	c
was	c
too	c
small	c
and	c
crowded	c
.	c

Look	i
forward	c
for	i
next	c
year	c
's	c
festival	c
.	c

Yours	c
Sinicerely	i
,	c

She	c
was	c
walking	c
over	c
a	c
bridge	c
.	c

Suddenly	c
,	c
she	c
heart	i
a	c
men	i
voice	c
called	i
her	c
"	i
Sara	c
...	c

Sara.	c
.	c

look	c
down	c
to	c
the	c
river.	c
"	c

Then	c
Sara	c
looked	c
down	i
the	c
river	c
.	c

She	c
was	c
very	c
scared	c
.	c

After	c
a	c
few	c
second	i
,	c
Sara	c
felt	c
that	c
golden	i
fish	c
was	c
lovely	c
.	c

She	c
never	i
seen	i
any	c
fish	c
had	i
that	c
wonderful	c
colour	c
and	c
can	i
talk	c
with	c
her	c
.	c

Because	c
Sara	c
has	i
n't	i
got	i
any	c
bother	i
and	c
sister	i
,	c
and	c
her	c
Mon	i
and	c
Dad	c
need	i
work	i
everyday	i
,	c
so	i
she	c
was	c
very	c
lonely	c
.	c

Therefore	c
,	c
she	c
came	c
river	i
everyday	i
and	c
talk	i
everything	i
to	i
the	c
golden	c
fish	c
.	c

They	c
were	c
very	c
close	c
friend	i
.	c

Sara	c
was	c
very	c
sad	c
.	c

She	c
sat	c
and	c
cry	i
on	i
the	c
river	c
.	c

look	c
at	c
me.	c
.	c

Sara	c
remembered	c
the	c
was	i
golden	c
fish	c
.	c

She	i
suddenly	i
become	i
a	i
human	c
,	c
a	c
little	c
boy	c
.	c

This	c
story	c
happened	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
ago	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
about	c
International	i
Arts	c
Festival	c
which	i
I	c
went	c
to	c
recently	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
a	c
great	c
time	c
there	c
because	c
taking	i
a	i
place	i
the	i
kind	i
of	i
festival	i
in	i
my	i
town	i
is	c
very	c
unusual	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
International	i
Arts	c
Festival	c
was	c
absolutely	c
fantastic	c
and	c
successful	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
also	c
pleased	c
with	c
the	c
weekend	c
ticket	c
because	c
I	c
tend	c
to	c
go	c
out	c
in	i
the	c
weekend	c
due	c
to	c
my	c
work	i
in	i
the	c
weekday	i
so	i
that	i
I	c
had	c
time	c
to	c
go	c
and	c
did	c
not	c
have	c
to	c
care	i
about	c
the	c
ticket	c
price	c
.	c

In	c
spite	c
of	c
having	c
a	c
great	c
time	c
,	c
there	c
were	c
some	c
things	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
my	c
opinion	c
about	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
there	c
was	i
a	c
few	c
stars	c
and	c
artists	c
from	c
only	c
six	c
countries	c
although	c
the	c
advertisement	c
mention	i
that	c
stars	c
and	c
artists	c
would	c
come	c
from	c
around	c
the	c
world	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
some	c
concerts	c
took	c
a	i
place	c
in	c
really	c
small	c
halls	c
.	c

I	c
suggest	c
that	c
concerts	c
should	c
be	c
held	c
in	c
bigger	c
halls	c
than	c
this	c
year	c
's	c
in	i
next	c
year	c
.	c

Therefore	i
,	c
there	c
will	i
be	c
more	c
people	c
coming	c
the	i
concerts	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
food	i
shops	i
should	c
be	c
added	c
in	i
this	c
festival	c
in	i
next	c
year	c
because	c
only	i
plays	i
and	i
films	i
were	i
not	i
atrractive	i
enought	i
to	i
get	i
audiences	i
.	c

Yours	c
sencirely	i
,	c

Hello	c
.	c

How	c
are	c
you	c
doing	c
?	c

I	c
've	c
been	i
also	i
considering	i
rules	c
at	c
home	c
with	c
my	c
friends	c
.	c

Is	c
n't	c
it	c
quite	c
interesting	c
to	c
talk	c
about	c
rules	c
?	c

I	c
really	c
want	c
to	c
change	c
this	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
go	c
out	c
wheneve	i
I	c
want	c
,	c
even	c
in	i
the	i
mid-night	i
.	c

I	c
'm	c
also	c
allowed	c
to	c
come	c
home	c
anytime	c
so	c
that	c
I	c
can	c
chat	c
with	c
my	c
friends	c
for	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
instead	c
of	c
talking	c
on	c
the	c
phone	c
at	c
home	c
.	c

There	c
is	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
rules	c
at	c
my	c
school	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
we	c
're	c
allowed	c
to	c
drive	c
a	c
car	c
to	c
school	c
,	c
which	c
is	c
quite	c
unusual	i
rule	c
in	c
Japanese	i
school	c
because	c
students	c
might	c
crash	c
a	c
car	c
on	c
the	c
way	c
to	c
school	c
or	c
home	c
.	c

Girls	c
ca	c
n't	c
make	i
up	i
on	c
at	c
school	c
at	c
all	c
.	c

I	c
want	c
to	c
at	c
least	c
put	c
lip	i
coluor	i
on	c
.	c

Best	c

Dear	c
Ms.	c
Ryan	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
in	c
response	c
to	c
the	c
letter	c
,	c
which	c
I	c
had	i
yesterday	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
you	c
asked	c
about	c
when	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c

I	c
am	c
afraid	c
that	c
I	c
am	c
available	c
to	c
travel	c
only	c
on	i
July	c
.	c

Because	c
I	c
have	c

all	c
year	c
except	c
one	c
month	i

on	i

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
be	i
appreciate	c
if	i
I	c
could	c
stay	c
in	c
log	c
cabins	c
at	c
Camp	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
Tennis	c

So	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
try	c
both	c
of	c
them	c
.	c

Lastly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
be	c
grateful	c
if	c
I	c
could	c
have	c
following	i
informations	i

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
about	c
clothes	i
,	i
which	c
are	c
suitable	c
for	c
activities	c

I	c
look	c

to	c

There	c
was	c
a	c
meeting	c
to	c
talk	c
about	c
a	c
video	c
about	c
daily	c
life	c
at	c
our	c
school	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
thought	c
that	c
a	c
normal	c
,	c
regular	c
lesson	c
,	c
3	c
optional	c
lessons	c
and	c
a	c
great	c
deal	c
of	c
activities	c
should	c
be	c
filmed	c
.	c

Refering	i
to	c
optional	c
lessons	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
recommended	c
that	c
Speaking	c
and	c
listening	c
,	c
Computer	c
and	c
Business	c
English	c
are	c
suitable	c
for	c
filming	c
.	c

I	c
feel	c
that	c
these	c
are	c
what	c
students	c
really	c
prefer	c
to	c
learn	c
.	c

As	c
well	c
as	c
that	c
,	c
if	c
we	c
filmed	c
famous	c
students	c
and	c
teachers	c
in	c
our	c
school	c
,	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
fantastic	c
video	c
.	c

That	c
's	c
why	c
they	c
prefer	c
to	c
film	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
activities	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
give	c
my	c
opinions	c
about	c
the	c
annual	c
International	c
Arts	c
Festival	c
I	c
have	c
visited	i
.	c

It	c
gives	c
an	c
opportunity	c
to	c
get	c
acquainted	c
with	c
the	c
cultures	i
'	i
variety	c
of	c
the	c
whole	c
world	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
at	c
this	c
festival	c
there	c
were	c
artists	c
only	i
from	i
six	c
countries	c
.	c

Although	c
,	c
some	c
concert	c
halls	c
were	c
too	c
small	c
for	c
all	c
the	c
guests	c
of	c
the	c
festival	c
.	c

I	c
suppose	i
.	c

I	c
must	c
also	c
admit	c
the	c
organization	c
of	c
the	c
festival	c
was	c
perfect	c
.	c

All	c
the	c
guests	c
were	c
offered	c
a	c
weekend	c
ticket	c
for	c
all	c
events	c
.	c

That	c
was	c
an	c
excellent	c
decision	c
as	c
all	c
the	c
events	c
started	c
at	c
different	c
time	i
and	c
there	c
was	i
plenty	c
of	c
them	c
.	c

In	c
conclusuon	i
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
in	c
spite	c
of	c
the	c
success	c
of	c
the	c
festival	c
some	c
improvements	c
still	c
can	c
be	c
done	i
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
the	i
next	c
year	c
's	c
one	c
may	i
last	c
not	c
for	c
two	c
days	c
only	c
,	c
but	c
for	c
a	c
week	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
kind	c
attention	c
.	c

Especially	c
young	c
people	c
who	c
are	c
always	c
out	i
of	i
their	c
small	c
budget	c
.	c

Fortunatelly	i
,	c
there	c
are	c
many	c
ways	c
to	c
earn	c
some	c
money	c
nowadays	c
.	c

Of	c
course	c
,	c
young	c
people	c
can	c
work	c
only	c
in	c
their	c
spare	c
time	c
.	c

It	c
mean	i
that	c
a	c
job	c
should	c
be	c
part-time	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
to	c
baby-sitting	c
you	i
may	c
also	c
give	c
some	c
lessons	c
to	c
small	c
children	c
such	c
as	c
(	c
tl	c
)	c
teaching	c
them	c
to	c
read	c
or	c
write	c
or	c
just	c
basic	c
rules	c
and	c
words	c
of	c
a	c
foreign	c
language	c
,	c
Eglish	i
for	i
example	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
you	c
can	c
help	c
them	c
and	c
earn	c
quiete	i
enough	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
happy	c
to	c
have	c
won	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
interested	c
in	c
going	i
to	i
two	c
weeks	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
in	c
the	c
USA	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
on	i
July	c
,	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
the	c
summer	c
and	c
the	c
weather	c
is	c
sunny	c
,	c
moreover	c
I	c
am	c
totally	c
free	c
during	c
this	c
month	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
good	c
in	i
those	c
two	c
activities	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
sea	c
every	c
weekend	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
now	i
more	c
information	c
about	c
clothes	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
weather	i
is	c
very	c
hot	c
and	c
that	c
the	c
nights	c
are	c
not	c
cold	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
do	c
not	c
know	c
if	c
I	c
must	c
take	c
lot	i
of	c
pullovers	c

"	c
Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
"	c
is	c
a	c
statement	c
of	i
men	c
in	c
general	c
.	c

Women	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
to	i
do	i
shopping	c
,	c
but	c
not	c
alone	c
and	c
they	c
want	c
to	c
motivate	c
their	c
husbands	c
.	c

Men	c
do	c
not	c
like	c
shopping	c
,	c
because	c
their	c
women	c
buy	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
clothes	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
very	c
expensive	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
child	i
does	c
not	c
like	c
shopping	c
because	c
he	c
often	c
waits	i
,	c
and	c
I	c
prefer	c
to	c
play	c
with	c
these	i
friends	i
.	c

To	c
conclude	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
"	c
Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
"	c
is	c
a	c
true	c
statement	c
,	c
but	c
not	c
always	c
for	c
all	c
people	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
this	c
festival	c
is	c
really	c
good	c
and	c
I	c
hope	c
it	c
will	c
have	i
every	c
year	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
the	c
attractions	i
were	i
beautiful	i
such	i
as	i
shows	i
,	i
exhibitions	i
and	i
concerts	i
.	c

I	c
liked	c
all	c
the	c
different	c
kind	i
of	c
atmosphere	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
the	c
plays	c
and	c
movies	c
were	c
marvellous	c
.	c

Considering	c
the	c
crowded	i
,	c
it	i
should	c
have	i
more	c
rooms	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
will	i
be	c
interested	c
in	c
meet	i
artists	c
from	c
everywhere	c
in	c
the	c
world	c
not	c
only	c
Europeen	i
artists	c
.	c

Your	i
sincerely	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
,	i
I	c
'm	c
very	c
happy	c
to	c
receive	c
some	c
news	c
about	i
you	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
going	c
to	c
reply	c
at	i
your	c
question	c
.	c

In	i
fact	i
,	c
at	c
school	c
we	c
have	c
n't	c
so	c
many	c
rules	c
.	c

We	c
have	c
to	c
wash	c
the	c
board	c
when	c
it	c
's	c
our	c
turn	c
.	c

I	c
ca	c
n't	c
remember	c
,	c
because	c
now	c
I	c
'm	c
19	c
,	c
then	i
I	c
can	c
do	c
what	c
I	c
want	c
.	c

They	c
wanted	c
that	i
I	i
did	i
my	c
homework	c
before	c
to	i
play	c
.	c

Also	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
come	c
back	c
at	i
home	c
on	c
time	c
,	i
it	i
was	c
very	c
important	c
for	c
my	c
parents	c
.	c

Anyway	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
great	c
time	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
child	c
.	c

It	i
's	i
all	c
for	c
now	c
.	c

See	c
you	c
soon	c
,	c
bye	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madame	i
,	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
I	i
expected	c
to	c
see	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
saw	c
different	i
actor	c
and	c
that	c
was	c
big	i
disappointment	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

Secondly	c
the	i
show	c
started	c
at	c
quarter	c
past	c
eight	c
.	c

"	c
Visit	c
our	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
"	c
.	c

That	c
was	c
cruel	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
haungry	i
after	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

At	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
this	c
letter	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
if	c
you	c
can	c
refund	c
my	c
money	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Some	c
of	c
them	c
are	c
big	c
and	c
some	c
of	c
theme	i
are	c
small	c
,	c
but	c
they	c
effect	i
our	c
lives	c
in	c
the	c
same	c
way	c
.	c

Modern	c
technology	c
makes	c
our	c
lives	c
different	c
,	c
maybe	c
better	c
.	c

Often	c
people	c
do	c
not	c
see	c
how	c
it	c
effects	i
our	c
life	i
style	i
.	c

Useful	c
things	c
like	c
TV	c
sets	c
,	c
radios	c
,	c
computers	c
,	c
Hi-Fi	i
stereos	c
and	c
cars	c
-	c
we	c
are	c
dealing	c
with	c
them	c
every	c
day	c
.	c

They	c
help	c
us	c
with	c
daily	c
life	c
and	c
make	c
it	c
more	c
pleasant	c
.	c

Transport	c
and	c
communication	c
without	i
cars	i
,	i
trains	i
,	i
planes	i
and	i
telephones	i
will	i
not	i
exist	i
.	c

We	c
know	c
our	c
world	c
from	c
TV	c
screens	c
and	c
computer	c
monitors	c
.	c

On	i
the	i
second	i
hand	i
people	c
are	c
suffering	c
from	c
modern	c
diseases	c
like	c
addiction	c
to	c
television	c
or	c
computers	c
.	c

On	i
the	i
end	i
we	i
must	c
mention	c
modern	c
medicine	c
.	c

It	c
saves	c
our	c
lives	c
from	c
ancient	c
and	c
modern	c
diseases	c
.	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
modern	i
technology	c
changed	c
our	c
daily	c
life	c
.	c

I	c
think	i
that	i
I	i
could	i
not	i
live	c
normal	i
life	c
without	c
these	c
inventions	c
.	c

They	c
are	c
like	c
air	i
I	c
breath	i
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
why	c
the	i
show	c
began	i
at	c
20:15	c
,	c
not	c
at	c
19:30	c
as	c
indicated	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
.	c

I	c
came	c
to	c
that	c
show	c
only	c
for	i
see	i
him	c
and	c
when	c
the	c
actor	c
appear	i
,	c
it	c
was	c
another	c
one	c
.	c

Where	c
were	c
the	c
discounts	c
that	c
I	c
should	c
have	c
earned	i
?	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
disappointed	c
with	c
that	c
!	c

After	c
the	c
show	c
my	c
sun	i
wanted	c
to	c
eat	c
some	c
biscuits	c
and	c
when	c
I	c
see	i
the	c
restaurant	c
closed	c
,	c
I	c
gave	c
up	c
,	i
I	c
told	c
to	i
my	c
sun	i
that	c
we	c
'll	c
never	c
come	c
back	c
here	c
again	c
.	c

The	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
there	c
was	c
n't	c
electricity	i
you	i
should	c
close	c
the	c
theatre	c
untill	i
the	c
restaurant	c
get	i
appropriate	i
to	i
use	i
.	c

As	c
we	c
see	c
the	i
clothes	i
are	c
changing	c
every	c
hour	c
.	c

In	c
each	c
country	c
,	c
each	c
people	c
wear	i
differents	i
kinds	c
of	c
clothes	c
,	c
like	i
,	c
people	c
in	c
Brazil	c
wear	c
shorts	c
,	c
T-shirts	c
or	c
only	i
without	c
them	c
,	i
in	c
Saudi	c
Arabian	c
they	c
wear	c
strange	c
clothes	c
,	c
if	c
you	c
analyse	c
the	i
point	c
of	c
view	c
who	i
does	c
n't	c
live	c
in	c
Saudi	c
Arabia	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
quite	c
sure	c
that	c
people	c
in	i
all	c
world	i
will	c
be	c
wearing	c
very	c
differents	i
clothes	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
because	c
,	i
especialy	i
women	c
,	c
like	i
to	c
be	c
very	c
elegant	c
and	c
beautiful	c
will	i
create	c
and	c
invent	c
all	c
kinds	c
of	c
clothes	c
to	i
anybody	i
and	i
that	i
's	i
it	i
.	c

I	c
'm	c
surprised	c
to	c
read	c
that	c
I	c
've	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
.	c

I	c
've	c
got	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
work	c
and	c
my	c
boss	c
did	i
n't	i
allowed	i
me	c
to	c
leave	c
my	c
job	i
any	i
other	c
time	c
.	c

I	c
prefer	i
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
because	c
it	c
's	c
more	c
like	c
a	c
camp	c
.	c

And	c
so	c
I	c
can	c
I	i
be	c
better	i
in	i
touch	i
with	i
the	i
nature	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
happy	c
to	c
read	c
that	c
I	c
will	c
have	c
the	c
chance	c
to	c
do	c
two	c
activities	c
there	c
.	c

I	c
chose	i
painting	c
and	c
photography	c
.	c

Photography	c
is	c
a	c
relaxing	c
activity	c
.	c

You	c
can	c
photograph	c
all	c
kind	i
of	c
arts	i
you	i
want	i
.	c

I	c
would	i
ask	c
you	c
about	c
clothes	c
and	c
money	c
.	c

And	c
what	c
about	c
money	c
?	c

Do	c
you	c
pay	c
for	c
all	i
?	c

And	c
for	c
food	c
,	c
drinks	c
etc	c
?	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
hearing	i
news	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Yours	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c

We	c
people	c
are	c
often	c
depressed	c
or	c
have	i
stress	i
.	c

What	c
are	i
we	i
doing	i
then	c
?	c

We	c
go	c
shopping	c
.	c

That	c
makes	i
often	i
women	c
feel	c
better	c
.	c

They	c
go	c
out	c
with	c
friends	c
or	c
alone	c
.	c

She	c
phone	i
me	c
and	c
asked	c
me	c
what	i
about	c
going	c
shopping	c
.	c

I	c
suggest	i
and	c
we	c
went	c
shopping	c
.	c

We	c
were	c
scared	c
and	c
so	c
we	c
did	c
all	i
what	i
he	c
told	c
us	c
.	i

We	c
were	i
lucky	c
that	c
we	c
are	c
in	i
life	i
now	c
.	c

You	i
ca	i
n't	i
be	i
carefull	i
because	i
you	i
do	i
n't	i
know	i
what	i
time	i
it	i
will	i
happens	i
.	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
very	c
pleasant	c
surprise	c
to	c
win	c
a	c
trip	c
to	c
California	c
and	c
I	c
very	c
much	c
appreciate	c
it	c
.	c

First	i
off	i
all	i
I	i
'll	i
prefer	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
,	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
the	c
only	c
month	c
I	c
have	c
free	c

I	c
'll	c
have	c
to	c
pass	i
several	c
exams	c

August	c
my	c
family	c
going	i
to	c
visit	c
our	c
relatives	c
in	c
Austria	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
not	c
so	c
keen	c
about	c
accomotation	i
but	c
would	c
rather	c
stay	c
in	c
tents	c
than	c
cabins	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
much	c
more	c
fun	c
and	c
you	c
can	c
really	c
enjoy	c
nature	c
and	c
a	i
company	c
of	c
your	c
friends	c
.	c

I	c
am	i
really	i
enjoying	i
swimming	c
.	c

Far	i
the	c
best	c
swimmer	c
in	c
my	c
school	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
not	c
a	c
photographer	c
but	c
my	c
family	c
think	c
that	c
my	c
photos	c
are	c
more	c
then	i
just	c
good	c
.	c

Finally	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
ask	c

better	i

guided	c
tours	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

My	c
best	c
friend	c
is	c
crazy	c
about	c
shopping	c
.	c

She	c
will	i
prefer	i
shopping	c
to	c
everything	c
else	c
.	c

It	c
seems	c
that	c
going	c
shopping	c
is	c
a	c
sense	i
of	i
living	i
.	c

Lots	c
of	c
families	c
planing	i
a	c
day	c
out	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
a	c
shopping	c
center	i
,	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
normal	c
routine	c
for	c
them	c
-	c
to	c
spent	i
the	i
all	c
day	c
just	c
shopping	c
.	c

Not	c
so	c
many	c
people	c
thinking	i
about	c
going	c
fishing	c
or	c
playing	c
sport	i
games	c
with	c
their	c
families	c
any	c
more	c
.	c

People	c
are	c
normally	c
angry	c
after	c
shopping	c
-	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
so	c
easy	c
to	c
get	c
tied	i
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
shopping	c
is	c
just	c
to	i
cover	c
our	c
basic	c
needs	c
.	c

Try	c
to	c
give	c
up	c
shopping	c
one	c
day	c
and	c
try	c
to	c
spend	c
your	c
day	c
with	c
friends	c
going	i
to	c
play	i
something	c
together	c
.	c

It	c
feels	c
much	c
more	i
better	c
.	c

You	c
'll	c
have	c
happy	c
memories	c
and	c
a	i
good	c
mood	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
so	c
happy	c
to	c
received	i
your	c
letter	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
tell	i
you	c
the	c
information	c
you	c
need	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
the	c
travel	i
start	i
only	i
july	i
if	c
possible	c
,	i
because	i
this	c
is	c
my	c
Hoilday	i
start	i
,	i
at	c
the	c
Camp	c
California	c
I	i
would	c
like	c
my	c
accommodation	i
in	c
tents	i
,	c
because	c
I	c
work	c
in	c
Army	i
and	c
in	i
the	c
camp	c
I	c
usually	c
stay	c
in	c
tent	i
at	c
night	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
will	c
feel	c
more	c
comfortable	c
.	c

Swimming	i
I	i
'm	i
teach	i
people	i
in	c
Army	i

Yours	c
Sincerely	c

To	c
make	c
a	c
daily	i
life	i
video	c
in	c
school	c
,	c
we	c
should	c
concentrat	i
on	c
the	c
most	i
things	i
we	i
do	i
in	c
a	c
school	c
,	i
the	i
most	i
thing	i
we	i
do	i
in	c
a	c
school	c
is	c
haveing	i
lesson	i
,	i
it	i
is	i
a	c
very	c
useful	c
parts	i
of	c
this	c
video	c
and	c
is	i
the	c
main	c
subject	c
.	c

The	c
lessons	c
we	c
take	i
in	c
the	c
video	c
,	i
should	c
be	c
the	c
main	c
subject	c
we	c
study	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
video	c
I	c
think	c
we	c
should	c
take	c
part	i
to	c
talk	c
about	c
,	i
what	c
we	c
doing	i
in	c
feel	i
time	c
and	c
study	c
period	i
.	c

This	c
is	c
another	c
important	c
part	c
of	c
our	c
school	c
life	c
,	c
and	c
we	c
should	c
make	i
a	c
section	c
to	i
talk	i
about	c
lunch	c
and	c
where	i
are	i
the	i
people	i
go	i
to	i
eat	i
their	i
lunch	i
or	i
what	i
they	i
do	i
?	i

After	c
we	c
talk	c
about	c
lunch	c
,	c
we	c
should	c
take	i
about	c
activities	i
we	c
are	c
doing	c
and	c
the	i
systems	i
about	i
the	i
activities	i
in	i
school	i
or	i
outside	i
school	i
and	i
make	i
a	i
little	i
section	i
of	i
the	i
School	i
term	i
,	i
and	i
what	i
kind	i
of	i
sport	i
the	i
people	i
like	i
the	i
most	i
.	c

At	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
the	c
video	c
,	c
we	c
should	c
find	c
one	c
or	c
two	c
studen	i
sit	c
together	c
and	c
ask	c
them	c
a	c
few	c
question	i
of	i
how	c
do	i
they	c
feel	c
to	i
study	i
in	i
the	c
School	i
?	c
this	i
is	c
the	i
suggestion	i
to	i
making	i
a	i
daily	i
life	i
video	i
in	i
school	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
about	c
the	c
festival	c
in	i
this	c
time	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
suggest	c
you	i
three	c
things	c
for	c
next	i
festival	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
great	i
idea	c
to	c
have	c
a	i
this	c
kind	c
of	c
festival	c
.	c

I	c
enjoyed	c
it	c
so	c
much	c
.	c

But	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
three	c
things	c
which	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
.	c

Firstly	c
.	c

I	c
supposed	i
to	c
see	c
quite	i
various	i
nationality	i
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
actually	c
liked	c
Jazz	i
,	c
rock	c
and	c
classical	c
concerts	c
very	c
much	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
some	c
concert	c
halls	c
were	c
too	c
small	c
for	c
the	c
many	i
people	c
so	c
we	c
could	c
n't	c
have	c
a	c
enough	c
space	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	i
you	c
to	c
consider	c
about	i
having	c
more	c
plays	c
and	c
films	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

It	c
would	c
be	c
nicer	c
.	c

Otherwise	c
,	c
the	c
price	c
was	c
really	c
reasonable	c
for	c
all	c
:events	i
the	i
weekend	i
.	c

I	c
was	c
satisfied	c
with	c
that	c
.	c

And	c
if	c
there	c
was	c
musical	c
event	c
.	c

And	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
about	i
making	i
this	c
festival	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
next	i
festival	c
very	c
much	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Dear	c
Lula	c

Hello	c
.	c

Let	c
me	c
tell	c
you	c
some	c
rules	c
at	c
school	c
in	c
my	c
country	c
.	c

Actually	c
.	c

We	c
have	c
quite	c
strict	c
rules	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
student	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
n't	c
allowed	c
to	c
wear	c
any	c
fashionable	c
clothes	c
.	c

Only	i
It	i
was	i
like	i
a	i
formal	i
clothes	i
.	i

And	c
we	c
could	c
n't	c
wear	c
any	c
colorful	i
clothes	c
and	c
socks	c
.	c

There	c
is	c
one	c
thing	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
change	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
pursuading	i
my	c
mum	c
,	c
perhaps	c
.	c

The	c
school	c
rules	c
in	c
my	c
country	c
are	c
more	c
strict	c
than	c
your	i
country	c
.	c

Anyway	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
want	c
to	c
know	c
about	c
something	c
of	c
our	c
country	c
.	i

I	c
'm	c
glad	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
more	c
.	c

Take	c
care	c
of	c
yourself	c
.	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
reply	c
your	i
letter	c
saying	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
the	c
competition	c
,	c
which	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
believe	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
so	c
excited	c
by	c
the	c
news	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
I	c
can	c
take	c
this	c
opportunity	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
I	c
run	c
my	c
shop	c
all	c
year	c
round	c
except	c
three	c
weeks	c
in	c
July	c
.	c

It	c
would	c
be	c
nice	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
chance	c
to	c
try	c
new	i
sport	c
when	c
we	c
are	c
relaxed	c
.	c

I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
about	c
what	c
clothes	c
we	c
need	c
,	c
what	c
the	c
weather	c
is	c
like	c
and	c
whether	c
we	c
need	c
some	c
spending	c
money	c
or	c
not	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
going	c
on	c
this	c
fantastic	c
holiday	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
.	c

How	c
are	c
you	c
?	c

I	c
know	c
you	c
have	c
been	c
waiting	c
for	c
my	c
letter	c
.	c

Actually	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
use	c
to	c
enjoy	c
pop	c
music	c
much	c
.	c

My	c
classmate	c
Cecilia	c
persuaded	c
me	c
to	c
try	c
whole	i
new	c
experience	c
of	c
helping	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
.	c

I	c
've	c
really	c
enjoyed	c
this	c
opportunity	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
too	c
complicated	c
.	c

But	c
the	c
rest	c
of	c
the	c
preparation	c
was	c
so	c
good	c
.	c

I	c
've	c
realised	c
pop	c
stars	c
are	c
just	c
like	c
us	c
,	c
down	c
to	c
earth	c
.	c

They	c
were	c
so	c
kind	c
and	c
modest	c
.	c

Do	c
you	c
know	c
what	c
I	c
liked	c
most	c
from	i
this	c
experience	c
?	c

I	i
've	i
found	i
pop	c
music	c
so	c
wonderful	c
,	c
it	c
changed	c
my	c
idea	i
of	i
that	c
classic	i
music	c
is	c
always	c
best	c
.	c

Of	c
course	c
,	c
I	c
've	c
enjoyed	c
being	c
around	c
famous	c
singers	c
,	c
too	c
.	c

Love	c

I	c
recently	c
spent	c
two	c
days	c
at	c
the	c
International	c
arts	i
festival	i
and	c
I	c
found	c
it	c
very	c
entertaining	c
.	c

The	c
idea	c
that	c
I	c
prefered	i
the	c
most	c
was	c
to	i
suggest	i
a	i
reasonably-priced	i
weekend	c
ticket	c
for	c
all	c
events	c
because	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
student	i
or	i
unemployed	c
people	c
could	c
not	c
afford	c
to	c
pay	c
too	c
much	c
money	c
.	c

I	c
went	c
to	c
see	c
a	c
classical	c
concert	c
and	c
,	c
although	c
the	c
music	c
played	c
was	c
excellent	c
,	c
he	i
concert	c
hall	c
was	c
too	c
small	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
expected	c
stars	c
and	c
artists	c
from	c
around	c
the	c
world	c
,	c
but	c
they	c
came	c
from	c
only	c
six	c
countries	c
.	c

A	c
friend	c
of	c
mine	c
went	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
play	c
"	c
Hamlet	c
"	c
and	c
the	c
film	c
"	c
Gladiators	c
"	c
.	c

He	c
told	c
me	c
how	c
great	c
it	i
was	i
and	c
I	c
was	c
thinking	c
that	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
a	i
good	c
to	c
have	c
more	c
plays	c
and	c
films	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
to	c
this	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
wondering	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
organize	c
the	c
same	c
festival	c
in	c
sommer	i
.	c

Yours	c
sincerly	i
,	c

Two	c
sisters	c
,	c
Alex	c
and	c
Daniela	c
were	i
sitting	c
in	c
front	c
of	c
the	c
fireplace	c
thinking	c
of	i
what	c
they	c
could	c
do	c
.	c

That	c
year	c
,	c
the	c
winter	c
in	c
France	c
was	c
very	c
cold	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
near	c
Christmas	c
and	c
the	c
two	c
girls	c
had	c
n't	c
found	c
any	i
present	c
for	c
their	c
mother	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
such	c
a	c
pain	c
to	c
walk	c
in	c
the	c
snow	c
.	c

In	i
deep	i
of	i
herself	c
,	c
Alex	c
knew	c
they	c
were	c
lost	c
in	c
the	c
middle	c
of	c
nowhere	c
,	c
but	c
she	c
did	c
n't	c
want	c
to	c
admit	c
it	c
.	c

Unfortuneatly	i
,	c
Daniela	c
fainted	c
.	c

Alex	c
began	c
to	c
cry	c
and	c
to	c
pray	c
and	c
when	c
Daniela	c
was	c
about	c
to	c
die	c
an	c
angle	i
appeared	c
.	c

The	c
answer	c
was	c
obvious	c
and	c
the	c
angel	c
saved	c
Daniela.	c
.	i

This	c
story	c
happend	i
a	c
long	c
time	c
ago	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
the	c
prize	c
at	i
camp	c
California	c
in	c
America	c
.	c

An	i
accommodation	c
,	c
I	c
prefer	i
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
.	c

This	c
is	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
my	c
first	c
time	i
to	c
see	c
an	i
outside	c
world	c
by	c
myself	c
so	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
gather	c
up	c
new	c
experiences	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
never	c
ever	c
stayed	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
before	c
but	c
some	c
of	c
the	c
people	c
I	c
know	c
said	c
that	c
it	c
is	c
fun	c
and	c
much	c
more	c
exiting	i
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
about	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
do	i
I	c
need	c
to	c
bring	c
?	i
and	i
the	i
money	c
,	c
do	c
I	c
need	c
much	c
of	c
them	i
?	c

Please	c
,	c
give	c
me	c
a	i
suggestion	i
about	c
these	c
.	i

Your	i
faithfully	c

How	c
are	c
you	c
?	c

Last	c
week	c
I	c
offered	c
myself	i
to	c
help	c
the	c
others	c
at	c
the	c
concert	c
and	c
it	c
was	c
amazing	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
n't	c
believed	i
how	c
close	c
I	c
was	c
to	c
the	c
band	c
.	c

There	c
were	c
so	c
many	c
youngsters	c
at	c
the	c
concert	c
,	c
but	c
because	c
I	c
was	c
the	c
youngest	c
in	c
a	i
helping	i
team	c
so	i
I	c
guess	c
that	c
I	c
was	c
the	c
luckiest	c
at	c
that	c
moment	c
.	c

Later	c
on	c
the	c
band	c
took	c
a	c
break	c
for	c
ten	c
or	c
fifteen	c
minutes	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
served	c
them	c
with	c
glasses	c
of	c
fizzy	c
drink	c
and	c
chocolate	c
bars	c
,	c
biscuits	c
and	c
sandwiches	c
.	c

You	c
will	c
not	c
believe	c
how	c
close	c
I	c
was	c
to	c
the	c
singers	c
.	c

People	c
at	i
the	i
backstage	c
including	i
me	c
were	i
helping	c
to	c
clean	c
up	c
all	c
the	c
stuff	c
and	c
ready	i
for	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
the	c
concert	c
.	c

Afterwards	c
,	c
I	c
have	i
a	c
chance	c
to	c
took	i
photos	i
with	c
them	c
and	c
have	i
their	c
autographs	c
etc	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
the	i
enjoyable	c
time	c
in	c
my	c
life	c
and	c
wished	i
that	c
you	c
were	c
there	c
with	c
me	c
.	c

From	i
this	c
letter	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
sure	c
that	c
you	c
should	i
be	c
able	c
to	c
share	c
this	c
experience	c
with	c
me	c
.	c

Lots	c
of	c
Love	c

In	c
your	c
advert	c
for	c
the	c
musical	c
show	i
you	c
promised	c
the	c
newest	c
and	c
best	c
musical	c
show	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
.	c

First	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
disappointed	c
about	c
the	c
price	c
of	c
the	c
ticket	c
because	c
I	c
expected	c
to	c
pay	c
a	c
smaller	i
pice	i
than	c
Â£	c
20	c
for	c
my	c
six	i
year	i
old	i
daughter	c
.	c

Then	c
the	c
show	c
already	i
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
and	c
not	c
at	c
19:30	c
!	c

I	c
was	c
quite	c
bored	c
,	c
sitting	c
in	c
my	c
chair	c
and	c
waiting	c
for	c
the	c
beginning	c
of	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

My	c
husband	c
was	c
also	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
seeing	c
Mr.	c
Brook	c
as	c
an	c
actor	c
of	i
your	c
musical	c
because	c
he	c
is	c
one	c
of	c
his	c
greatest	c
fans	c
.	c

When	c
we	c
arrived	c
at	c
the	c
restaurant	c
we	c
had	i
to	i
realize	i
that	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
the	c
cook	c
was	c
ill	c
.	c

Yours	c
,	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

Pat	c
was	c
really	c
shocked	c
to	c
hear	c
this	c
but	c
she	c
had	c
to	c
promise	c
Sally	c
to	c
keep	c
quiet	c
.	c

After	c
that	c
Paul	c
got	i
white	c
in	c
his	i
face	c
,	c
he	c
was	c
pale	c
like	c
a	c
wall	c
and	c
it	c
seemed	c
as	i
he	c
would	i
be	i
very	c
nervous	c
.	c

Pat	c
could	c
n't	c
understand	c
Paul	c
's	c
reaction	c
and	c
so	c
she	c
did	c
n't	c
care	i
about	c
it	c
.	c

Now	c
Pat	c
realized	c
what	c
was	c
going	c
on	c
and	c
could	c
undstand	i
why	c
her	c
boyfriend	c
got	c
so	c
nervous	c
about	c
the	c
secret	c
.	c

16th	c
,	c
Dec.	c
2000	c

Dear	c
Mr.	c
Clark	c
,	c

I	c
thought	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
interesting	c
and	c
exciting	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
impressed	c
of	i
the	c
idea	c
of	c
the	c
festival	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
enjoy	c
different	c
culture	i
and	c
also	c
I	c
could	c
expand	c
my	c
knowledge	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
the	c
weekend	c
ticket	c
was	c
fantastic	c
because	c
I	c
spent	c
two	c
days	c
the	i
festival	c
-	c
Saturday	c
and	c
Sunday	c
.	c

The	c
ticket	c
price	c
was	c
not	c
too	c
expensive	c
for	c
student	i
too	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
you	c
said	c
"	c
Stars	c
and	c
artists	c
from	c
around	c
the	c
world	c
"	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
.	c

But	c
there	c
were	c
only	c
six	c
countries	c
'	c
candidates	c
.	c

Jazz	c
and	c
classical	c
concerts	i
'	i
halls	c
were	c
especially	c
small	c
.	c

It	c
caused	c
a	c
long	c
queue	c
and	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
waste	c
my	c
time	c
.	c

Plays	c
and	c
films	c
qualities	i
were	c
good	c
,	c
but	i
quantities	i
were	i
bad	i
.	c

In	c
addition	c
,	c
most	c
of	c
the	c
people	c
in	c
the	c
festival	c
liked	c
that	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
run	c
more	c
plays	c
and	c
films	c
in	c
next	c
year	c
's	c
festival	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
your	c
answer	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

It	c
is	c
really	c
important	c
because	c
making	c
money	c
needs	c
a	c
proper	c
purpose	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
did	c
newspaper	c
delivery	c
.	c

I	c
earned	c
easily	c
and	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
control	c
myself	c
at	c
that	c
time	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
made	c
brochure	i
for	c
a	c
company	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
in	c
high	c
school	c
.	c

Also	c
I	c
was	c
leader	c
of	c
the	c
computer	i
user	i
circle	c
in	c
the	c
school	c
so	c
I	c
needed	c
some	c
money	c
for	c
managing	c
the	c
circle	c
.	c

For	c
this	c
reason	c
,	c
I	c
took	c
this	c
kind	c
of	c
part-time	c
job	c
in	c
the	c
company	c
.	c

So	c
lose	i
was	c
bigger	c
than	c
profit	i
.	c

Because	c
you	c
will	c
get	c
some	c
money	c
as	c
well	c
as	c
some	c
career	c
and	c
knowledge	c
.	c

You	c
must	c
consider	c
the	c
purpose	c
too	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
have	c
n't	c
purpose	i
,	c
you	c
would	i
waste	c
money	c
easily	c
and	c
quickly	c
.	c

According	c
to	c
the	c
title	c
of	c
the	c
advertisement	c
,	c
which	c
was	c
a	c
great	c
idea	c
,	c
there	c
were	i
stars	c
and	c
artists	c
from	c
around	c
the	c
world	c
;	i
but	c
they	c
were	c
only	c
from	c
six	c
countries	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
the	c
weekend	c
ticket	c
was	c
reasonably-priced	c
and	c
this	c
was	c
excellent	i
decision	c
because	c
it	c
gave	c
the	c
opportunity	c
to	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
people	c
,	c
adults	c
but	c
also	c
students	c
,	c
to	c
take	c
part	c
to	i
the	c
Festival	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

Dear	c
George	c
,	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
answer	c
your	c
question	c
about	c
rules	i
in	c
my	c
life	c
,	c
at	c
school	c
and	c
at	c
home	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
hard	c
to	c
be	c
extremely	c
quite	i
for	c
five	c
hours	c
but	c
I	c
reckon	c
it	c
's	c
a	c
good	c
way	i
of	c
education	c
.	c

On	i
the	i
other	i
side	i
,	c
I	c
feel	c
free	c
at	c
home	c
.	c

I	c
can	c
go	c
out	c
and	c
stay	c
out	c
late	c
,	c
I	c
've	c
got	c
my	c
car	c
and	c
my	c
mobile	c
,	c
so	c
that	c
they	c
can	c
call	c
me	c
whenever	c
they	c
need	c
to	c
hear	i
me	c
;	c
but	c
above	c
all	c
I	c
know	c
they	c
trust	c
me	c
and	c
consider	c
my	i
an	c
adult	c
.	c

Therefor	i
I	c
would	c
n't	c
change	c
anything	c
in	c
my	c
home	c
life	c
and	i
neither	i
in	c
my	c
school	c
life	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Ryan	c

Many	c

how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
will	c
get	c
from	c
you	c
for	c
those	i
two	c

because	c
I	c

to	c
spend	c
some	c
money	c
for	i
clothes	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c

Dear	c
Kim	c

These	c
two	c
people	c

stars	c
in	c
our	c
country	c
...	c

But	c
after	c
this	c
serville	i
work	c
I	c
met	c
Eminem	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
greatest	c
moments	c
in	c
my	c
life	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
a	i
hard	c
but	c
also	c
a	i
funny	i
work	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
just	c

it	i
would	c
be	c
grateful	c
if	c
you	c

more	c
information	c
about	c
the	c
two	c
weeks	c
at	c
camp	c
California	c
in	c
the	c
USA	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
appreciate	c
if	i
I	c
could	c
travel	c
on	i
July	c
because	c
my	c
school	c
gives	c
me	c
two	c
winter	i
holiday	i
's	i
week	i
.	c

As	c
far	c
as	c
accommodation	c
is	c
concern	i
,	c
I	c
prefer	c
staying	c
in	c
a	c
long	i
cabin	c
.	c

It	c
would	c
be	c
very	c
kind	c
of	c
you	c
to	c
let	c
me	c
know	c
about	c
the	c
clothes	c
you	c
think	c
it	c
would	i
be	c
necessary	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
take	c
and	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
will	c
need	c

I	c
'm	c
sorry	c
I	c
have	c
n't	c

before	c
but	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
very	c
busy	c
helping	c
at	c
Mano''s	i
concert	c
.	c

Do	c
you	c
remember	c
when	c
I	c
told	c
you	c
that	c
my	c
dream	c
was	c
helping	i
Mano''s	i
group	c
?	c

Well	c
,	c
my	c
dream	c
come	i
true	c
.	c

All	i
started	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
in	i
Drama	c
Club	c
and	c
my	c
singing	c
teacher	c
told	c
me	c
that	c
Mano''s	i

's	c
concert	c
!	c
!	c
!	c
!	c

I	c
will	c
never	c
forget	c
that	c
wonderful	c
experience	c
.	c

Please	c
write	c
me	i
as	c
soon	c
as	c
you	c
can	c
.	c

Best	c
wishes	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
thank	c
for	i
the	c
letter	c
with	c
the	c
result	c
of	c
the	c
competition	c
and	c
also	c
to	c
ask	c
some	c
questions	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
inform	c
that	i
I	c
prefer	c
travelling	c
in	c
July	c
to	c
travelling	c
in	c
another	i
month	c
.	c

Next	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
stay	i
in	c
tents	i
rather	c
than	c
stay	c
in	c
log	i
cabins	i
because	c
I	c
appreciate	c
having	c
straight	i
contact	c
with	c
nature	c
.	c

I	c
can	c
say	c
I	c
am	c
good	c
at	c
swimming	c
,	c
because	c
in	c
the	c
club	c
I	c
used	c
to	c
be	c
the	i
first	c
in	c
all	c
the	c
competitions	c
and	c
climbing	i
I	c
used	c
to	c
climb	c
trees	c
,	c
walls	c
everything	i
in	c
my	c
childhood	c
without	c
falling	c
.	c

Since	c
I	c
am	c
going	c
to	c
travel	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
would	i
be	c
adviseable	i
to	c
take	c
and	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothe	i
I	c
should	c
take	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
an	i
answer	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Adriana	c

I	c
am	c
just	c
writing	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
about	c
my	c
experience	c
about	i
helping	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
.	c

Starting	c
with	c
good	c
points	c
,	c
I	c
could	c
say	c
that	c
you	c
can	i
talk	c
face	i
to	i
face	i
with	c
the	c
pop	c
stars	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
you	c
have	i
the	c
unique	c
opportunity	c
to	c
take	i
pictures	i
with	i
them	c
,	c
to	c
have	c
their	c
names	c
written	c
,	i
on	c
your	c
notebook	c
by	c
themselves	i
.	c

Despite	c
of	i
being	c
tiring	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
rewarding	c
because	c
I	c
noticed	c
that	c
all	c
the	c
singers	c
are	c
ordinary	c
people	c
who	c
want	c
to	c
see	c
their	c
fans	c
happy	c
and	c
satisfied	c
and	c
that	i
is	c
true	c
I	c
experienced	c
that	c
.	c

Do	c
n't	c
worry	c
because	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
pay	c
your	i
ticket	c
it	i
is	c
"	c
free	c
"	c
.	c

Lots	c
of	c
Love	c

Adriana	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
about	c
my	c
preference	c
.	c

When	c
it	c
comes	c
to	c
activities	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
try	c
climbing	c
and	c
surfing	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
am	c
quite	c
confident	c
with	i
this	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
to	c
these	c
reasons	c
,	c
both	c
activities	c
are	c
popular	c
especially	i
in	c
California	c
.	c

Finaly	i
,	c
I	c
must	c
choose	c
traveling	i
there	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
not	c
allowed	c
to	c
take	c
holidays	c
in	c
other	c
months	c
due	c
to	c
my	c
work	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
your	c
time	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
visiting	c
there	c
.	c

Those	c
who	c
love	c
shopping	c
are	i
usually	c
suffer	c
from	c
serious	c
stress	c
and	c
may	c
seek	c
out	c
satisfaction	c
by	c
shopping	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
things	c
which	c
you	c
can	c
get	c
by	i
money	c
necessarily	i
fill	i
your	c
unsatisfaction	i
or	c
even	c
as	c
you	c
buy	c
something	c
more	c
and	c
more	c
,	c
your	c
emptiness	c
might	c
be	c
bigger	i
.	c

What	c
you	c
want	c
is	c
often	c
different	c
from	c
what	c
your	c
friend	c
wants	c
.	c

Unless	c
either	c
you	c
or	c
your	c
partner	c
is	c
really	c
tolerant	c
,	c
shopping	c
could	c
result	c
in	c
another	c
stress	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
whole	c
,	c
shopping	c
can	c
be	c
harmful	c
rather	c
than	c
enjoyable	c
because	c
you	c
migh	i
be	c
extravacant	i
,	c
lose	c
your	c
friends	c
and	c
have	c
what	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
need	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
,	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
you	i
because	c
I	c
had	i
been	i
asked	i
to	c
make	c
a	c
little	c
suggestion	c
about	c
the	c
programme	c
your	i
have	c
organised	c
to	i
our	c
English	c
class	c
travel	i
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
we	c
have	c
seen	c
an	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
show	i
and	c
we	c
would	c
all	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

We	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
good	c
opportunity	c
because	c
london	i
fashion	c
is	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
over	i
the	c
world	c
,	c
and	c
we	c
all	c
learn	i
a	c
lot	c
about	c
London	c
style	c
going	c
to	c
this	c
show	c
.	c

We	c
think	c
we	c
could	c
change	i
shooping	i
for	i
going	i
to	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

The	c
show	c
is	c
free	c
,	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
only	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
14th	c
of	c
March	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
open	c
from	c
10.00	c
until	c
19.00	c
,	c
and	c
we	c
could	c
go	c
there	c
on	i
the	c
afternoon	c
.	c

On	i
my	i
point	i
of	i
view	i
the	c
media	c
's	c
treatment	c
of	c
famous	c
people	c
is	c
very	c
bad	c
.	c

The	c
media	i
's	i
are	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
create	i
great	c
expectations	c
about	c
famous	c
people	c
.	c

They	c
are	c
not	c
trying	c
to	c
give	c
information	c
,	c
they	c
are	c
only	c
looking	c
to	c
get	c
money	c
,	c
and	c
to	c
entertain	c
the	c
public	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
if	c
the	c
media	i
's	i
are	c
acting	c
in	c
that	c
way	c
is	i
because	c
of	c
the	i
society	c
.	c

The	i
society	i
is	i
who	i
increases	c
the	c
audience	c
of	c
the	c
media	c
,	c
if	c
nobody	c
gave	i
attention	c
to	c
the	c
famous	c
people	i
private	c
lifes	i
,	c
this	c
treatment	c
would	c
finish	c
.	c

But	c
in	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
before	c
you	c
get	c
famous	c
you	c
know	c
which	i
are	c
the	c
consequences	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
you	c
this	c
letter	c
to	c
complain	i
about	c
you	i
have	c
organized	c
us	i
for	c
our	c
trip	c
to	c
London	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
activity	c
programme	c
.	c

All	c
the	c
clan	i
would	c
enjoy	c
going	c
the	i
show	c
,	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
oportunity	i
to	c
see	c
an	c
exhibition	c
as	i
the	c
latest	c
fashions	c
.	c

We	c
know	c
that	c
you	c
have	c
planned	c
a	c
very	c
complete	c
programme	c
.	c

But	c
we	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
suggest	c
you	c
to	i
move	i
our	c
visit	c
to	c
the	c
Science	c
Museum	c
to	c
Wednesday	c
afternoon	c
,	i
so	c
that	c
,	i
we	c
can	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
show	i
on	i
Tuesday	i
,	i
which	i
lasts	i
from	i
10	i
am	i
to	i
7	i
pm	i
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Nowadays	c
,	c
in	c
our	c
society	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
some	c
people	c
who	c
,	c
because	c
of	c
their	c
work	c
or	c
because	c
of	c
their	c
success	c
in	c
life	c
,	c
has	i
become	c
popular	c
,	c
and	c
by	c
now	c
is	i
known	c
by	c
everybody	c
.	c

But	c
,	c
how	c
does	c
fame	c
affect	c
to	i
their	c
lifestyle	c
?	c

Politicians	c
,	c
musicians	c
or	c
film	c
starts	i
are	c
controlled	i
all	c
the	c
time	c
,	c
since	i
they	i
wake	c
up	c
in	c
the	c
morning	c
until	c
they	c
go	c
to	c
bed	c
in	c
the	c
evening	c
,	c
by	c
journalists	c
and	c
photographers	c
who	c
follow	c
them	c
and	c
observe	c
all	c
that	c
they	c
do	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
certain	c
that	c
these	c
people	c
have	c
fame	c
,	c
fortune	c
and	c
success	c
,	c
and	c
that	c
many	c
of	c
them	c
are	c
rich	c
,	c
very	c
rich	c
.	c

And	c
believe	c
me	c
,	c
there	c
is	c
no	c
money	c
in	c
the	c
world	c
to	i
pay	i
that	c
.	c

So	c
now	c
,	c
all	c
we	c
should	c
have	c
to	c
ask	c
ourselves	c
is	c
if	c
their	c
damaged	i
lifestyles	i
is	c
in	c
part	c
our	c
fault	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
give	c
suggestion	i
for	i
the	c
international	c
art	c
festival	c
,	c
which	c
I	c
have	i
been	i
to	c
one	c
weeks	i
before	i
.	c

It	c
was	c
really	c
good	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
feel	c
it	c
could	c
be	c
better	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
said	c
that	c
stars	c
and	c
artists	c
from	c
around	c
the	c
world	c
on	i
the	c
advertisement	c
,	c
but	c
in	c
fact	c
they	c
are	i
from	c
only	c
six	c
different	c
countries	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
hope	c
there	c
will	c
be	c
artists	c
from	c
more	c
different	i
countries	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

Although	c
the	c
jazz	c
,	c
rock	c
and	c
classical	c
music	c
was	c
great	c
,	c
some	c
concerts	i
and	c
halls	c
are	i
too	c
small	c
,	i
could	i
you	c
consider	c
making	c
them	c
bigger	c
next	c
year	c
.	i

It	c
was	c
excellent	c
about	i
one	c
reasonably-priced	i
weekend	c
ticket	c
for	c
all	c
events	c
,	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
convenient	c
and	c
normally	c
young	c
people	c
do	c
not	c
have	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
money	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
hope	c
next	c
year	c
the	c
ticket	c
will	c
be	i
also	i
like	c
this	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
that	c
you	c
can	c
consider	c
my	c
suggestions	c
.	c

I	c
really	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
going	c
to	c
the	c
festival	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

Dear	c
Jacob	c
:	c

I	c
hope	c
everything	c
is	c
ok	c
.	c

We	c
should	c
keep	c
in	c
touch	c
with	c
each	c
other	c
,	c
because	c
you	c
know	c
I	c
'm	c
very	c
happy	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
friend	c
like	c
you	c
.	c

In	c
your	c
last	c
letter	c
you	c
asked	c
me	c
something	c
about	c
our	c
rules	c
,	c
both	c
at	c
home	c
and	c
at	c
school	c
in	c
my	c
country	c
.	c

In	c
school	c
,	c
we	c
have	c
lots	c
of	c
rules	c
,	c
especially	c
in	c
the	i
class	c
and	c
some	c
of	c
them	c
are	c
quite	c
strange	c
.	c

And	c
we	c
ca	c
n't	c
eat	c
food	c
or	c
do	c
any	c
sports	c
in	c
our	c
classroom	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
fail	c
three	c
subjects	c
in	c
your	c
exam	c
,	c
you	c
will	c
be	c
kicked	c
out	c
of	c
school	c
.	c

If	c
I	c
can	i
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
change	c
this	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
think	c
everyone	c
can	c
success	i
at	c
once	c
,	i
we	i
should	c
give	c
them	c
second	i
chance	c
to	c
try	i
.	c

Anyway	c
,	c
in	c
my	c
country	c
,	c
generally	c
,	c
children	c
are	c
free	c
at	c
home	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
also	c
depends	c
on	c
their	c
parents	c
.	c

For	c
me	c
,	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
rules	c
at	c
home	c
,	i
just	i
do	c
n't	c
take	i
trouble	c
to	i
my	c
family	c
,	i
that	i
's	i
all	c
.	c

All	i
the	i
best	i
wishes	i
and	c
good	c
luck	c
.	c

yours	c

Dear	c
Jane	c
Clark	c
,	c

The	c
purpose	c
of	c
this	c
letter	c
is	c
to	c
congratulate	c
you	c
on	c
the	c
International	c
Arts	c
Fesival	i
I	c
attended	c
last	c
weekend	c
.	c

Firstly	c
I	i
would	c
like	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
that	c
the	c
idea	c
of	c
organizing	c
an	c
International	c
Arts	c
Festival	c
is	c
fantastic	c
,	c
but	c
in	c
your	c
advertisement	c
it	c
was	i
said	c
that	c
I	c
would	c
find	c
stars	c
and	c
artists	c
from	c
arround	i
the	c
world	c
,	c
when	c
,	c
in	c
fact	c
,	c
they	c
were	c
from	c
only	c
six	c
countries	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
understand	c
that	c
it	c
must	c
be	c
difficult	c
to	c
get	c
these	c
people	c
to	c
go	i
to	c
the	c
festival	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
nice	c
if	c
next	c
year	c
we	c
could	c
meet	c
other	i
personalities	c
.	c

Last	c
but	c
not	c
least	c
I	i
would	c
like	c
you	c
to	c
know	c
that	c
I	c
think	c
the	c
idea	c
of	c
the	c
weekend	c
ticket	c
for	c
all	c
events	c
was	c
excellent	c
because	c
in	c
the	c
end	c
it	c
was	c
cheaper	c
than	c
paying	c
for	c
each	c
event	c
separatelly	i
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
find	c
my	c
opinion	i
useful	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
to	c
hearing	i
from	c
you	c
soon	c

yours	i
sincerelly	i
,	c

there	i
are	c
several	c
ways	c
to	c
earn	c
a	c
bit	c
of	c
money	c
in	c
your	c
spare	c
time	c
.	c

One	c
of	c
the	c
most	c
common	c
examples	c
is	c
baby-	i
sitting	i
taking	c
care	c
of	c
little	c
children	c
is	c
easy	c
and	c
it	c
does	c
n't	c
require	c
special	c
skills	c
,	i
all	c
you	c
need	c
is	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
patience	c
.	c

If	c
looking	c
after	c
children	c
does	c
n't	c
fit	i
you	c
,	c
you	c
can	c
try	c
with	i
pets	c
.	c

So	c
if	c
you	c
like	c
animals	c
this	c
is	c
your	c
chance	c
to	c
earn	c
money	i
and	c
have	c
fun	c
at	c
the	c
same	c
time	c
.	c

Another	c
option	c
is	c
to	c
wash	c
your	c
neighbour	c
's	c
car	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
find	c
anything	c
good	c
enough	c
for	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
worry	c
,	c
you	c
should	c
always	c
remember	c
:	c
It	c
's	c
not	c
all	c
about	c
the	c
money	c
!	c

Dear	c
Ms	c
Ryan	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
in	c
reply	c
to	c
your	c
letter	c
I	c
received	c
yestarday	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
proud	c
that	c
I	c
won	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
extremely	c
happy	c
to	c
spend	c
two	c
weeks	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
in	c
the	c
U.S.A	c
.	c

At	c
the	c
beginning	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
answer	c
questions	i
you	c
asked	c
me	c
in	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

As	c
I	c
was	c
requested	c
I	c
should	c
choose	c
two	c
activities	c
from	c
the	c
list	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
choose	c
climbing	c
and	c
photography	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
keen	c
on	c
photography	c
.	c

Climbing	c
,	c
in	c
contrast	c
,	c
is	c
something	c
I	c
started	c
few	i
months	c
ago	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
have	c
not	c
gained	c
any	c
success	c
in	c
this	c
sport	c
.	c

But	c
you	c
could	c
give	c
me	c
a	c
chance	c
to	c
get	c
more	c
familier	i
with	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	i
also	i
to	c
know	c
what	c
the	c
cost	c
of	c
spending	c
two	c
weeks	c
in	c
the	c
U.S.A.	c
is	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Juliana	c
Piotrowska	c

Have	c
you	c
ever	c
been	c
to	c
a	c
big	c
supermarket	c
and	c
tried	c
to	c
find	c
something	c
you	c
really	c
like	c
or	c
want	c
,	c
looking	c
throug	i
shelves	c
and	c
not	c
finding	c
that	c
in	c
the	c
end	c
.	c

What	c
did	c
you	c
feel	c
?	c

There	c
is	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
situations	c
which	c
could	c
make	c
you	c
feel	c
similar	c
while	c
you	c
do	c
shopping	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
you	c
could	c
face	c
an	c
agressive	i
and	c
maybe	c
even	c
drunk	c
shop	c
assistant	c
or	c
manager	c
.	c

You	c
are	c
happy	c
to	c
buy	c
a	c
dress	c
or	c
a	c
suit	c
for	c
a	c
good	c
price	c
.	c

And	c
you	c
could	c
n't	c
of	c
course	c
give	i
it	c
back	c
because	c
the	c
price	c
was	c
lowered	c
and	c
your	c
dress	c
is	c
not	c
under	c
guarantee	c
.	c

You	c
could	c
also	c
face	c
an	c
unpleasant	c
situation	c
connected	c
with	c
money	c
.	c

Somebody	c
could	c
give	c
you	c
not	c
enough	c
change	c
.	c

How	c
would	c
you	c
feel	c
?	c

Deceived	c
?	c

(	c
A	c
very	c
depressing	c
point	c
of	c
view	c
,	c
is	c
n't	c
it	c
?	c
)	c

Thank	c
you	c
a	i
lot	i
for	c
your	c
letter	c
,	i
I	c
am	c
very	c
happy	c
of	i
having	c
won	c
the	c
competition	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
several	c
precisions	i
to	c
tell	c
you	c
and	c
some	c
questions	c
about	c
the	c
camp	c
.	c

First	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
the	c
only	c
free	c
month	c
I	c
have	c
in	c
the	c
summer	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
exams	c
in	c
June	c
and	c
a	c
work	i
in	c
August	c
.	c

Then	c
,	c
about	c
accommodation	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
a	c
tent	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
used	c
to	c
.	i

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
what	c
sort	c
of	c
clothes	c
do	c
advise	i
me	c
to	c
bring	c
to	c
be	c
at	i
ease	i
during	c
my	c
activities	c
and	c
as	i
nearly	c
everything	c
is	c
already	c
paid	c
,	i
do	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
take	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
money	c
with	c
me	c
?	c

Thank	c
you	c
a	i
lot	i
for	c
all	c
these	c
details	c
.	c

Jasmine	c
Martin	c

I	c
have	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
different	c
things	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
about	c
what	c
happened	c
at	c
the	c
concert	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
tired	c
but	c
when	c
the	c
concert	c
began	c
I	c
felt	c
excited	c
because	c
there	c
were	c
so	c
many	c
people	c
dancing	c
and	c
singing	c
in	c
front	c
of	c
the	c
stage	c
.	c

That	c
was	c
the	c
best	c
.	c

Looking	c
forward	c

Sir	c
Manager	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
an	c
excellent	c
actor	c
,	c
who	c
(	c
according	c
to	c
the	c
play	c
advertisement	c
)	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
perform	c
,	c
was	c
replaced	c
for	i
a	c
disappointing	c
actor	c
.	c

Besides	c
the	i
spectacle	c
was	c
setted	i
up	i
to	c
19:30	i
,	c
but	c
ended	c
up	c
starting	c
at	c
20:15	c
.	c

Sir	c
,	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
believe	c
in	i
that	i
,	c
everything	c
that	c
was	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
was	c
a	c
fraud	i
.	c

That	c
's	c
why	c
I	c
am	c
writting	i
to	c
ask	c
for	c
some	c
money	c
back	c
,	i
I	c
believe	c
I	c
have	c
this	c
right	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
since	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
child	c
I	c
have	c
noticed	c
that	c
except	i
for	c
the	c
medical	c
facilities	c
and	c
achievements	c
,	c
it	c
has	c
brought	c
to	i
me	c
more	c
disadvantages	c
than	c
advantages	c
.	c

I	c
still	c
remember	c
the	c
day	c
television	i
came	c
to	c
my	c
house	c
,	i
I	c
was	c
only	c
seven	c
,	c
everybody	c
was	c
exciting	i
about	c
the	c
new	c
"	c
toy	c
"	c
,	c
however	c
what	i
seemed	c
to	c
be	c
only	c
one	c
more	c
way	c
to	c
get	c
together	c
,	c
turned	c
to	i
rule	c
our	c
lives	c
.	c

Unfortunatly	i
my	c
parents	c
did	c
not	c
realize	c
how	c
TV	c
was	c
creating	i
a	i
role	i
among	c
us	c
.	c

Before	c
TV	c
,	c
we	c
used	c
to	c
spend	c
our	c
nights	c
,	i
playing	c
cards	c
,	c
telling	c
jokes	c
,	c
talking	c
to	c
each	c
other	c
.	c

Nowadays	c
,	c
I	c
barely	c
know	c
my	c
parents	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
do	c
know	c
exactly	c
what	c
is	c
happening	c
in	c
the	c
soap	c
operas	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
to	c
this	c
it	c
is	c
wonderful	c
not	c
have	i
to	c
wait	c
too	c
long	c
to	c
eat	c
,	c
thanks	c
for	i
the	c
microwaves	i
invention	i

Dear	c
Jane	c
C	c

I	c
have	i
spent	i
two	i
days	i
at	i
the	i
International	i
Arts	i
Festival	i
recently	i
and	c
I	c
am	c
writing	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
give	c
my	c
opinions	c
about	c
it	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
knew	i
it	i
was	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
an	c
international	c
festival	c
,	c
I	c
got	c
really	c
excited	c
because	c
I	c
would	c
finally	c
have	c
the	c
opportunity	c
to	c
meet	c
stars	c
and	c
artists	c
from	c
around	c
the	c
world	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
felt	c
rather	c
disappointed	c
when	c
I	c
found	c
out	c
that	c
was	c
not	c
at	c
all	c
true	c
.	c

Besides	c
this	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
some	c
of	c
the	c
concert	c
halls	c
were	c
too	c
small	c
that	i
I	c
felt	c
very	c
uncomfortable	c
.	c

Although	c
that	c
Festival	c
was	c
not	c
well-organized	i
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
you	c
to	c
repeat	c
it	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
really	i
appreciate	i
it	c
if	c
you	c
would	i
take	i
into	c
consideration	c
the	c
problem	c
with	c
the	c
lack	c
of	c
space	c
in	c
the	c
concert	c
halls	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Personally	c
,	c
I	c
can	i
not	i
imagine	c
human	c
life	c
without	c
rules	c
,	c
especially	c
those	c
that	c
have	c
to	c
do	c
with	c
respecting	c
other	c
people	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
in	c
favour	c
of	c
rules	c
at	c
school	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
very	c
important	c
for	c
children	c
to	c
learn	c
how	c
to	c
cooperate	c
with	c
others	c
.	c

As	c
far	c
as	c
I	c
can	c
remember	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
respect	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
rules	c
but	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
concerning	i
wearing	c
the	i
suitable	c
clothes	c
,	c
to	i
arrive	i
in	i
time	c
and	c
get	i
on	c
with	c
every	c
teacher	c
and	c
authority	c
.	i

As	c
a	c
consequence	c
,	c
most	c
mates	i
used	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
those	c
rules	c
but	c
all	c
of	c
us	c
tried	c
to	c
put	c
up	c
with	c
them	c
.	c

Fortunately	c
,	c
rules	c
are	c
made	c
by	c
every	c
member	c
of	c
the	c
family	c
so	c
that	c
no	c
one	c
complains	c
about	c
them	c
.	c

That	c
is	c
all	c
!	c

I	c
had	c
a	c
vary	i
dissappointing	i
evining	i
last	c
saturday	i
.	c

I	c
had	c
everythig	i
planned	c
,	i
I	i
and	i
my	i
family	i
where	i
coming	c
to	c
whatch	i
your	c
show	c
and	c
then	c
have	c
a	c
decent	c
meal	c
at	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
disasterous	i
.	c

Firstly	c
there	c
was	c
no	c
available	i
discount	i
,	c
as	i
you	c
said	i
on	i
your	c
advertisement	c
so	i
even	c
my	c
6	i
year	i
old	i
son	c
was	c
charged	c
adult	i
price	c
.	c

Supposedly	c
it	c
was	c
to	c
start	c
at	c
19:30	i
well	i
it	c
did	c
n't	c
,	i
it	i
started	c
45	c
minutes	c
late	c
,	c
at	c
exactly	c
20:15	c
.	c

And	c
By	i
the	c
way	c
may	c
I	c
ask	c
you	c
how	c
up	i
to	i
date	i
your	c
leaflets	c
are	c
because	c
in	c
spite	c
of	c
the	c
ad	i
vert	i
saying	c
the	c
staring	i
actor	c
was	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
well	i
it	c
was	c
n't	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
an	i
other	i
actor	c
I	i
had	c
never	c
heard	c
of	c
.	c

Anyway	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
nowhere	i
as	i
good	c
as	c
it	c
was	c
mentioned	i
to	c
be	c
and	c
it	c
was	c
definately	i
worse	c
than	c
I	c
had	c
expected	c
it	c
to	c
be	c
,	i
I	c
did	c
n't	c
enjoy	c
it	c
at	c
all	c
so	c
I	c
was	c
relying	c
on	c
the	c
food	c
to	c
fill	c
me	c
up	c
and	c
relieve	c
some	c
of	c
my	c
stress	c
.	c

So	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
over	c
we	c
walked	c
out	c
and	c
followed	c
all	c
the	c
signs	c
for	c
about	c
5	c
minutes	c
desparately	i
searching	c
for	c
your	c
restaurants	i
our	i
stomaches	i
rumbling	c
for	c
food	c
.	c

You	c
do	c
n't	c
understand	c
how	c
dissappointed	i
and	c
angry	c
I	c
was	c
that	c
night	c
.	c

Thankyou	i
for	c
your	c
time	c
and	c
attention	c

In	c
fact	c
he	c
was	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
main	i
busybodies	c
of	c
his	c
neighborhood	i
and	c
his	c
school	c
so	c
not	c
alot	i
of	c
people	c
in	c
his	c
school	c
liked	c
him	c
.	c

Another	c
bad	c
thing	c
about	c
this	c
school	c
was	c
that	c
there	c
where	i
different	c
types	c
of	c
students	c
that	c
formed	c
groups	c
.	c

Some	c
where	i
just	c
friend	i
groups	c
but	c
others	c
took	c
it	c
seriously	c
,	c
maby	i
just	c
a	c
bit	c
too	c
seriously	c
,	i
they	i
gave	c
themselves	c
names	c
and	c
acted	c
as	i
gangs	c
rather	c
than	c
just	c
groups	c
of	c
friends	c
,	c
and	c
started	c
picking	c
on	c
younger	c
people	c
,	c
or	c
mempers	i
of	c
other	c
gang	i
,	c
trying	c
to	c
start	c
fights	c
with	c
them	c
.	c

This	c
whent	i
on	c
and	c
on	c
,	c
got	c
more	c
and	c
more	c
serious	c
but	i
it	c
was	c
so	c
secret	c
that	c
teachers	i
did	c
n't	c
notice	c
.	c

and	i
the	c
word	c
spread	c
like	c
wildfire	c
and	c
by	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
the	c
day	c
virtually	c
everyone	c
knew	c
about	c
this	c
party	c
.	c

Everyone	c
in	c
the	c
year	c
was	c
anoyed	i
,	c
but	c
not	c
with	c
Pat	c
,	c
oh	c
,	c
no	c
!	c

With	c
the	c
group	c
having	c
the	c
party	c
.	c

That	c
night	c
the	c
party	c
commenced	c
.	c

Everyone	c
was	c
enjoying	c
themselves	c
exept	i
Pat	c
who	i
had	c
heard	c
about	c
the	c
raid	c
.	c

Everyone	c
was	c
drunk	c
and	c
they	c
simply	c
would	c
not	c
let	c
him	c
go	c
.	c

Time	c
was	c
ticking	c
away	c
.	c

They	c
had	c
water	c
bombs	c
and	c
water	c
pistols	c
at	c
the	c
ready	c
.	c

they	i
started	c
charging	c
down	c
the	c
field	c
towards	c
the	c
fire	c
and	c
once	c
in	c
range	c
everyone	c
thew	i
their	c
balloon	i
as	c
far	c
as	c
they	c
could	c
.	c

they	i
all	c
exploded	c
with	c
loud	c
splashes	c
.	c

The	c
group	c
having	c
the	c
party	c
thought	c
this	c
was	c
a	c
serious	c
attack	c
and	c
started	c
throwing	c
back	i
stones	i
and	c
shooting	c
every	i
one	i
wit	i
BB	c
guns	c
.	c

Lots	c
of	c
People	c
wher	i
injured	c
and	c
even	c
more	c
where	i
suspended	c
the	c
next	c
day	c
at	c
school	c
,	c
when	c
the	c
Headmaster	c
found	c
out	c
what	c
had	c
happened	c
.	c

But	c
he	c
felt	c
awfull	i
because	c
he	c
new	i
that	c
all	c
this	c
had	c
happened	c
because	c
of	c
him	c
.	c

To	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
,	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
the	c
programme	c
that	c
you	c
provided	i
.	c

It	c
was	i
very	i
good	c
programme	c
,	c
especially	c
the	c
river	c
trip	c
to	c
Greenwich	c
,	c
which	c
I	c
am	c
sure	c
the	c
whole	c
class	c
would	i
enjoy	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
our	c
class	c
has	c
spotted	c
an	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
and	c
would	i
all	c
wish	c
to	c
attend	c
.	c

It	c
will	c
be	c
from	c
10.00	c
till	c
7.00pm	c
.	c

This	c
will	c
be	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
for	c
us	c
because	c
we	c
will	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
find	c
out	c
more	c
about	c
the	c
people	c
of	c
London	c
and	c
their	c
fashions	c
and	c
style	i
we	i
might	c
also	c
get	c
a	c
change	i
to	c
meet	c
new	c
people	c
and	c
interest	i
with	c
them	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
a	c
few	c
suggestion	i
on	c
how	c
the	c
programme	c
could	c
be	c
changed	c
to	c
fit	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
in	c
.	c

We	c
would	c
have	c
to	c
forgo	c
the	c
shopping	c
as	c
we	c
might	c
not	c
have	c
enough	c
time	c
and	c
the	c
exchange	c
rate	c
might	c
be	c
too	c
high	c
for	c
us	c
to	c
do	c
much	c
shopping	c
.	c

We	c
can	c
however	i
go	i
and	c
look	c
around	c
the	c
shopping	c
mall	c
if	c
we	c
have	c
time	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

Lastly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
be	c
very	c
grateful	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
give	c
us	c
your	c
permission	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

From	c
letters	c
to	c
emails	c
,	c
from	c
gas	c
stoves	c
to	c
electric	c
stoves	c
and	c
microwaves	c
,	i
but	i
we	c
are	c
n't	c
just	c
going	c
to	c
stop	c
here	c
are	c
we	c
?	c

No	c
,	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
,	c
the	c
present	c
will	c
be	c
the	c
past	c
and	c
these	i
things	c
now	c
new	c
to	c
use	i
will	c
be	c
old	c
,	c
outdated	c
and	c
changed	c
.	c

I	c
see	c
a	c
very	c
different	c
home	c
for	c
us	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
.	c

Most	c
things	c
will	c
be	c
computerised	c
.	c

We	c
an	i
on	c
and	c
off	c
lights	c
with	c
touch	c
pads	c
and	c
remote	c
controllers	i
.	c

Cameras	c
will	c
be	c
something	c
usual	c
in	c
every	c
house	c
instead	c
of	c
that	c
little	c
peephole	c
in	c
your	c
door	c
.	c

We	c
might	c
still	c
favour	i
that	c
old	c
carpet	c
and	c
couch	c
.	c

The	c
furniture	c
should	c
not	c
change	c
that	c
much	c
on	c
the	c
outside	c
and	c
the	c
amount	i
of	c
rooms	c
should	c
not	c
change	c
too	i
.	c

In	c
the	c
future	c
,	c
every	c
child	c
might	c
have	c
a	c
laptop	c
.	c

Never	i
have	i
to	c
leave	c
the	c
house	c
or	c
wake	c
up	c
so	c
early	c
.	c

Another	c
way	c
our	c
home	c
could	c
be	c
different	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
is	c
probably	c
the	c
utilitles	i
we	c
are	i
using	c
.	c

We	c
might	c
not	c
need	c
maids	c
to	c
do	c
housework	c
anymore	c
as	c
they	c
can	c
easily	c
be	c
replaced	c
with	c
a	c
robot	c
,	c
a	c
machine	c
,	c
or	c
something	c
other	i
with	c
the	c
same	c
purpose	c
.	c

Our	c
homes	c
will	c
still	c
be	c
the	c
same	c
in	c
terms	c
of	c
the	c
kitchen	i
,	i
it	i
will	c
still	c
be	c
filled	c
with	c
vegetables	c
and	c
meat	c
.	c

This	c
is	c
because	c
people	c
wo	c
n't	c
miss	i
the	c
great	c
taste	c
of	c
food	i
although	i
it	c
could	c
be	c
subsituted	i
to	i
a	c
vitamin	c
pill	c
or	c
two	c
.	c

Lastly	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
all	c
this	i
changes	c
wo	c
n't	c
really	c
be	c
noticed	c
as	c
we	c
change	c
it	i
daily	c
and	c
slowly	c
instead	c
abruptedly	i
.	c

Dear	c
Jane	c
Clark	c
,	c

I	c
congratulated	i
with	i
you	c
because	c
it	c
has	i
been	i
a	c
great	c
idea	c
since	i
the	c
town	c
needed	c
a	c
cultural	c
event	c
.	c

I	c
especially	c
appreciate	i
the	c
weekend	c
tickets	c
which	c
almost	c
everybody	c
could	c
afford	c
,	c
also	i
students	c
like	c
me	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
some	c
concert	c
halls	c
were	c
too	c
small	c
for	c
the	c
musical	c
performances	c
.	c

Being	c
very	c
fond	c
of	c
films	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
have	c
appreciate	i
seeing	c
more	c
of	c
them	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
make	c
a	i
really	c
international	c
festival	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
you	c
should	c
invite	c
artists	c
from	c
all	c
over	c
the	c
world	c
,	c
not	c
just	c
from	c
six	c
countries	c
like	c
this	c
year	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
that	c
you	c
will	c
appreciate	c
my	c
opinions	c
and	c
suggestions	c
,	c
which	c
I	c
have	c
shared	c
with	c
my	c
friends	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

Simply	c
a	c
good	c
idea	c
and	c
that	c
's	c
enough	c

Are	c
you	c
young	c
and	c
full	c
of	c
life	c
but	c
you	i
do	c
n't	c
have	c
enough	c
money	c
to	c
enjoy	c
your	c
spare	c
time	c
?	c

Are	c
you	c
fed	c
up	c
of	i
looking	c
after	c
the	c
screaming	c
baby	c
of	c
your	c
mother	c
's	c
friend	c
?	c

You	c
could	c
move	c
from	c
children	c
to	c
pets	c
and	c
become	c
a	c
dog-sitter	c
,	c
spending	c
your	c
afternoons	c
walking	c
round	c
the	c
park	c
and	c
chatting	c
with	c
a	c
friend	c
.	c

Are	c
you	c
keen	c
on	c
music	c
and	c
you	i
love	c
going	c
to	c
disco	i
?	c

Do	c
you	c
like	c
do-it-yourself	c
and	c
your	i
house	i
is	i
full	c
of	c
marvellous	c
but	c
unuseful	i
things	c
?	c

You	c
could	c
sell	c
them	c
to	c
a	c
specialised	c
shop	c
and	c
finally	c
tidy	c
up	c
your	c
room	c
!	c

Work	c
out	c
your	c
own	c
idea	c
and	c
realise	i
it	i
:	c
money	c
wo	c
n't	c
be	c
a	c
problem	c
for	c
you	c
anymore	c
!	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	i
response	c
to	c
the	c
international	i
Arsts	i
Festival	c
,	c
which	c
took	c
place	c
on	c
21-22	c
November	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
inform	c
you	c
,	i
that	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
great	c
idea	c
and	c
valuable	i
activitie	i
as	c
a	c
social	c
event	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
dissapointment	i
,	i
when	c
I	c
realised	c
that	c
not	c
many	c
countries	c
were	c
attending	c
to	i
the	c
event	c
.	c

But	c
one	c
thing	c
,	i
I	c
have	c
to	c
mention	c
is	c
that	c
some	c
of	c
the	c
concert	c
halls	c
was	i
too	c
small	c
and	c
it	i
was	i
n't	i
comfortable	c
as	i
well	i
as	i
to	i
fell	i
the	c
great	c
atmosphere	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
,	i
if	c
you	c
could	c
expend	i
the	c
plays	c
and	c
films	c
more	i
for	i
next	c
year	c
?	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
preciate	i
your	c
organisation	i
and	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	i
the	c
next	c
International	c
Arts	c
Festival	c
.	c

Its	i
really	c
nice	c
to	c
hearing	i
from	c
you	c
and	c
thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
the	c
letter	c
with	i
photos	c
.	c

Its	i
a	c
good	c
idea	c
to	c
send	c
them	c
to	c
me	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
confess	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
lost	c
my	c
camera	c
and	c
also	c
the	c
films	c
.	c

What	c
a	c
pitty	i
!	c

By	c
the	c
way	c
how	i
is	c
your	c
new	c
school	c
?	c

Did	i
you	c
like	c
it	c
more	c
than	c
the	c
previous	c
one	c
?	c

I	c
must	c
say	c
that	c
our	c
school	c
rules	c
are	c
quite	c
different	c
than	i
yours	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
depends	c
on	c
the	c
school	c
.	c

Privat	i
schools	c
have	c
more	i
relaxed	c
atmosphere	c
that	i
the	c
state	c
school	i
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
in	c
the	c
state	c
schools	c
as	c
I	c
said	c
,	c
we	c
are	c
more	c
respectful	c
to	c
the	c
teacher	c
and	c
bad	c
behaviours	i
are	i
punished	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
do	c
more	c
homeworks	i
or	c
they	c
are	i
sending	i
you	c
home	c
etc.	c
Of	c
course	c
smoking	c
is	c
n't	c
allowed	c
at	i
any	c
part	c
of	c
the	c
schol	i
.	c

But	c
in	c
many	c
Families	i
women	i
are	i
doing	i
more	c
than	c
men	c
.	c

Lots	c
of	c
Love	i

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c

As	c
you	c
mentioned	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
the	c
competition	c
-	c
two	c
weeks	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
in	c
the	c
U.S.A.	c
therefore	i
here	c
is	c
the	c
information	c
that	c
you	c
require	c
.	c

I	c
can	c
travel	c
only	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
during	c
this	c
month	c
I	c
am	c
free	c
to	c
go	c
anywhere	c
,	i
actually	i
it	c
is	c
my	c
summer	c
holiday	c
.	c

Second	c
activity	c
it	i
would	c
be	c
tennis	c
,	i
I	c
am	c
not	c
the	i
expert	c
in	i
this	c
one	i
because	c
I	c
've	c
played	c
it	c
only	c
twice	c
but	c
I	c
know	c
how	c
to	c
hit	c
the	c
ball	c
and	c
basic	c
stuff	c
like	c
;	i
serve	i
the	c
ball	c
,	c
back	i
hand	i
and	c
fore	i
hand	i
to	c
hit	c
the	c
ball	c
.	c

Finally	c
I	c
have	c
something	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
about	c
how	c
many	c
people	c
can	c
stay	c
in	c
one	c
tents	i
?	i

Do	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
bring	c
swimming	c
suit	i
if	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
swim	c
in	i
the	c
camp	c
?	c

This	c
information	c
should	c
enough	i
for	c
you	c
but	c
if	c
you	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
more	c
about	c
anything	c
please	c
ask	c
me	c
and	c
do	c
not	c
hesitate	c
.	c

Sometime	i
when	c
you	c
ask	c
your	c
friend	c
especially	i
girls	c
.	i

The	i
typical	c
answer	c
would	c
be	c
'	c
I	c
'm	c
going	c
to	c
shop	i
because	c
I	c
like	c
it	c
even	i
windows	i
shopping	c
would	c
be	c
fine	c
'	c
.	c

Why	c
?	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
it	i
's	i
wasting	i
my	c
time	c
especially	i
when	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
find	c
the	c
thing	c
I	c
want	c
,	i
this	i
is	c
very	c
frustrating	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
,	c
it	c
's	c
so	c
tiring	c
to	c
walk	c
around	c
the	c
place	c
over	c
and	c
over	c
to	c
find	c
the	c
thing	c
you	c
want	c
.	c

However	c
shopping	i
is	c
not	c
a	c
bad	c
thing	c
,	i
only	i
if	c
you	c
plan	c
it	i
carefully	c
what	c
to	c
buy	c
,	c
where	c
to	c
go	c
,	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
you	c
will	c
spend	c
on	i
?	c

Dear	c
the	i
competition	c
organiser	c
(	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
)	c

I	c
'm	c
as	i
happy	c
to	c
heard	i
that	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
.	c

Here	c
is	c
the	c
information	c
you	c
want	c
from	c
me	c
.	c

Because	c
I	c
'm	c
in	i
the	i
holiday	c
that	i
moment	i
.	c

Because	c
it	c
is	c
more	c
safety	i
,	c
and	c
I	c
do	i
n't	i
like	c
to	c
be	c
in	c
the	c
log	c
cabins	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
think	c
I	c
will	c
choose	c
Basketball	c
and	c
Photography	c
,	c
because	c
basketball	c
is	c
the	c
only	c
sport	c
I	c
can	c
play	c
well	c
.	c

How	c
much	c
did	i
I	c
need	c
for	c
the	c
Camp	c
?	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c

For	c
some	c
people	c
it	c
may	c
be	c
a	c
method	i
to	c
relax	c
themselves	i
,	c
after	c
you	c
have	c
been	c
to	c
work	c
or	c
school	c
.	c

It	c
depends	c
on	c
what	i
is	i
the	i
place	i
and	i
the	i
aim	i
you	i
are	i
shopping	i
.	c

The	c
place	c
where	c
you	c
are	c
shopping	c
also	i
very	c
important	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
in	i
HK	c
all	i
the	i
areas	i
have	i
lots	i
of	i
people	i
it	i
wo	i
n't	i
let	i
you	i
feel	i
good	i
of	i
the	i
noise	i
and	i
times	i
when	i
you	i
are	i
shopping	i
.	c

After	i
I	c
've	c
written	c
this	c
composition	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
you	c
will	c
enjoy	c
shopping	c
most	c
of	c
the	c
time	c
,	c
but	c
still	c
have	i
sometimes	c
you	c
wo	c
n't	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
just	c
writing	c
this	c
letter	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
I	c
have	i
seen	i
last	c
Sunday	c
at	i
the	c
evening	c
.	c

Besides	i
of	c
all	c
,	c
at	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
the	c
Musical	c
,	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	i
your	c
Theatre	c
Restaurant	c
,	c
in	c
order	c
of	i
taking	i
a	i
dinner	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
have	i
leaft	i
home	c
without	c
eating	c
and	c
so	c
I	c
was	c
hungry	c
at	c
that	c
time	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
say	i
you	c
that	c
I	c
am	c
asking	c
for	c
money	i
back	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
had	c
an	i
evening	i
totally	i
despleased	i
,	c
completely	c
different	c
that	i
you	c
have	i
anouced	i
in	c
your	c
advertisement	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
modern	c
technology	c
have	i
changed	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
the	i
last	c
five	c
years	c
more	c
quickly	c
than	c
in	c
the	i
anchient	i
time	i
,	c
or	c
even	c
than	c
a	c
ten	i
years	i
ago	c
.	c

I	c
became	i
to	c
notice	c
the	c
difference	c
in	i
my	i
work	c
,	c
since	c
when	i
all	c
tasks	c
have	i
changed	i
to	i
the	c
computer	c
and	c
I	c
needed	c
to	c
learn	c
how	c
to	c
use	c
that	c
machine	c
.	c

Besides	i
,	c
teachers	c
began	c
asking	i
us	c
a	i
lot	c
of	c
article	i
to	i
be	c
copied	c
throught	i
the	c
internet	i
.	c

Firstly	i
I	c
become	i
to	c
write	c
letters	c
and	c
articles	c
,	c
next	c
I	c
learned	c
several	c
computers	i
plays	i
.	c

Nowadays	c
,	c
I	c
can	i
n't	i
stay	i
one	c
day	c
without	c
consulting	c
computers	i
communications	c
throught	i
e-mail	c
or	c
internet	i
.	c

I	c
change	i
corespondecies	i
with	c
all	c
my	c
family	c
by	i
internet	i
,	c
my	i
mother	c
and	c
2	c
brothers	c
who	c
live	c
in	c
Curitilra	c
City	c
and	c
so	i
with	c
a	c
brother	c
who	c
live	i
in	c
Italy	c
and	c
another	c
who	c
is	c
living	c
in	c
New	c
Zealand	c
.	c

My	c
life	c
would	c
n't	c
be	c
the	c
same	c
another	i
time	i
without	c
these	i
progress	c
.	c

Dear	c
Jane	c
X	c
,	c

I	c
'm	c
an	c
italian	i
boy	c
who	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
International	c
Arts	c
Festival	c
last	c
November	c
and	c
I	c
enjoyed	c
most	c
of	c
the	c
events	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
but	i
given	i
that	i
I	c
think	c
that	c
the	c
Festival	c
could	c
be	c
better	c
next	c
year	c
I	c
write	i
you	i
these	i
lines	i
in	c
order	c
to	c
make	i
you	c
know	i
some	c
observations	c
of	c
mine	c
about	c
the	c
festival	c
.	c

The	c
Festival	i
on	c
its	c
own	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
idea	c
because	c
there	c
are	c
n't	c
many	c
of	c
these	c
events	c
dealing	c
with	c
art	c
but	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
instead	c
of	c
inviting	c
stars	c
and	c
artists	c
only	i
from	i
six	c
counties	c
they	c
could	c
be	c
invited	c
really	i
from	c
all	c
the	i
world	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
and	c
for	i
sure	i
it	c
is	c
not	c
your	c
fault	c
,	c
some	c
of	c
the	c
halls	c
for	c
the	c
concerts	c
were	c
too	c
small	c
and	c
that	c
prevented	c
me	c
from	c
enjoying	c
some	c
of	c
the	c
concerts	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
noise	c
but	c
also	c
prevented	c
many	c
people	c
from	c
entering	c
the	c
hall	c
that	i
was	c
often	c
two	i
crowded	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
next	c
year	c
plays	i
and	i
films	i
will	i
be	i
more	i
and	c
that	c
the	c
ticket	c
will	c
be	c
reasonably-priced	i
as	i
this	i
year	i
in	i
way	i
that	i
people	i
not	i
really	i
interested	i
in	i
arts	i
could	i
come	i
and	i
enjoy	i
the	i
festival	i
.	c

Dear	c
Marie	c
,	c

At	c
my	c
home	c
every	c
rule	c
must	c
be	c
respected	c
.	c

Even	c
if	c
my	c
parents	c
do	c
n't	c
look	i
after	i
me	i
for	i
all	i
the	i
matters	i
like	c
going	c
out	c
on	i
nights	i
or	c
studying	c
you	c
do	i
n't	i
have	i
to	i
think	i
that	c
living	c
in	c
my	c
house	c
is	c
like	c
living	c
in	c
heaven	c
because	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
play	c
the	c
guitar	c
or	c
listen	c
to	c
music	c
at	c
a	c
loud	c
volume	c
or	c
invite	c
my	c
friends	c
for	i
a	c
Saturday	c
night	c
party	c
.	c

These	c
are	c
the	c
things	c
that	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
chance	i
;	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
do	c
what	c
I	c
really	c
want	c
but	i
I	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
if	c
I	c
'm	c
really	c
ready	c
for	c
this	c

Dear	c
Mrs.	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
as	i
a	i
reply	c
to	c
your	c
letter	c
,	i
congratulating	c
me	c
to	i
the	i
winning	c
of	i
the	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
and	c
inviting	c
me	c
to	c
the	i
Camp	c
California	c
in	c
the	c
U.S.A.	c
I	c
was	c
delighted	c
to	c
hear	c
from	c
you	c
and	c
am	c
already	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
spend	i
two	c
weeks	c
in	c
California	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
afraid	c
that	c
the	c
only	c
possible	c
time	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
travel	c
is	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
the	c
only	c
month	c
I	c
am	c
able	c
to	c
get	c
time	c
off	c
work	c
.	c

As	i
an	i
accomodation	i
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
sleeping	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
because	c
I	c
enjoy	c

However	c

to	i
including	i
this	c
point	i
in	c
the	c
programme	c
.	c

The	c
show	c
is	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
the	c
14	c
of	c
March	c
from	c
10.00	c
to	c
19.00	c
and	c
we	c
fained	i
it	c
very	c
interesting	c
,	c
because	c
we	c
will	c
have	c
the	c
opportunity	c
to	c
see	c
mews	i
,	c
firstly	c
about	c
the	c

Your	i
sincerely	c
,	c

We	c
have	c
been	c
talking	c
for	c
hours	c
in	c
our	c
class	c
about	c
the	i
treatment	i
of	i
the	i
media	i
regarding	i
famous	i
people	i
.	c

Almost	i
the	c
time	c
they	c
have	c
journalists	c
following	c
them	c
everywhere	c
and	i
all	i
the	i
time	i
,	c
looking	c
for	c
great	i
news	i

interesting	c
pictures	c
to	c
put	c
on	c
the	c
first	i
page	c
of	c
the	c
newspaper	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
think	c
this	c
is	c
very	c
nice	c
,	c
but	c
is	i
the	c
price	c
that	c
famous	c
people	c
have	c
to	c
pay	c
,	c
just	c
becouse	i
they	c
are	c
popular	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr.	c
Robertson	c
,	c

My	c
name	c
is	c
Bao-yu	c
Liao	c
.	c

We	c
are	c
very	c
grateful	c
for	c
what	i
you	i
have	i
well-organised	i
the	i
programme	i
going	i
to	i
London	i
for	i
us	i
.	c

It	c
is	c
a	c
good	c
programme	c
,	i
especially	i
National	i
Art	c
Gallery	c
is	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
most	i
places	i
we	i
would	i
like	c
to	c
visit	c
.	c

Concidently	i
the	c
show	c
is	c
in	c
London	c
and	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
March	c
14	c
which	i
is	c
during	c
the	c
period	c
we	c
are	c
in	c
London	c
for	c
the	c
three-day	c
programme	c
.	c

Of	c
course	c
,	c
leisure	i
as	c
well	c
.	c

Therefore	c
,	c
if	c
it	c
is	c
possible	c
,	c
we	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
show	c
in	c
the	c
afternoon	c
on	c
14	c
March	c
instead	c
of	c
going	c
shopping	c
.	c

It	c
would	c
be	c
very	c
much	c
appreciated	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
arrange	c
the	i
programme	c
to	c
be	c
changed	c
.	c

We	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
a	i
good	c
news	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

We	c
know	c
it	c
does	c
not	c
matter	c
they	i
are	c
famous	c
or	c
not	c
,	i
everyone	c
has	i
his	i
own	i
privacy	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
as	c
human	c
beings	c
,	c
almost	c
all	c
of	c
us	c
are	c
curious	c
.	c

We	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
and	c
chat	c
about	c
gossip	c
.	c

This	c
is	c
why	c
gossip	c
magazines	c
are	c
so	c
popular	c
.	c

Of	c
course	c
,	c
it	i
everyone	c
pays	i
less	c
attention	c
or	c
interest	i
,	c
the	c
situations	i
should	i
be	c
better	c
.	c

I	c
remember	c
in	c
August	c
1997	c
Princess	c
Diana	c
died	i
in	c
the	c
car	c
crash	c
was	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
most	c
disarster	i
examples	c
.	c

Lets	i
all	c
leave	c
them	c
more	c
freedom	c
to	c
enjoy	c
their	c
private	c
lives	c

do	c
our	c
shopping	c

on	c
next	i

What	c
do	c
you	c
think	c
about	c
our	c
suggestion	c
?	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

In	c
your	c
letter	c
,	c
you	c
asked	c
me	c
wheter	i
the	c
book	c
I	c
've	c
read	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
suitable	c
present	c
for	c
your	c
cousin	c
's	c
fifteenth	c
birthday	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
my	c
pleasure	c
to	c
write	c
my	c
suggestion	c
for	c
you	c
now	c
!	c

You	c
know	c
I	c
love	c
reading	c
books	c
,	c
it	c
's	c
my	c
passion	c
.	c

I	c
've	c
read	c
all	c
the	c
books	c
of	c
English	i
author	c
Ernest	c
Hemingway	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
think	c
your	c
cousin	c
is	c
too	c
young	c
for	c
it	i
.	c

Why	c
?	c

Because	c
he	c
especially	i
concentrates	c
on	c
history	i
,	c
social	i
life	i
and	c
politic	i
situation	c
in	i
the	c
time	c
the	c
story	c
is	c
played	i
.	c

That	c
might	i
be	c
quiet	i
complicated	i
to	c
understand	c
,	c
especially	c
for	c
young	c
people	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
written	c
by	c
Agatha	c
Christie	c
.	c

She	c
's	c
an	c
American	c
and	c
her	c
books	c
concentrate	c
on	c
crime	c
and	c
detective	c
stories	c
.	c

She	c
especially	i
write	i
books	i
for	c
young	c
people	c
.	c

And	c
I	c
think	c
this	c
book	c
is	c
a	c
very	c
good	c
one	c
for	c
your	c
cousin	c
.	c

You	c
wrote	c
that	c
your	c
cousin	c
is	c
quite	c
intered	i
in	c
magic	c
,	c
detectives	c
and	c
sport	c
,	c
did	c
n't	c
you	c
?	c

I	c
think	c
this	c
is	c
the	c
best	c
choice	c
for	c
him	c
!	c

I	c
've	c
send	i
you	c
a	c
copy	c
of	c
the	c
summary	c
from	c
the	c
book	c
and	c
an	c
interesting	c
article	c
about	c
the	c
author	c
and	c
the	c
book	c
.	c

Please	c

it	c

Dear	c
Mr	c

I	c
'd	c
like	c
thank	c
you	c
to	i
take	i
us	c
on	c
a	c
trip	c
to	c
London	c
and	c
have	i
made	i
such	c
a	c
good	c
programme	c
,	c
especially	c
the	c
river	c
trip	c
to	c
Greenwich	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
know	c
we	i
are	c
in	c
England	c
to	c
learn	c
your	c
language	c
and	c
also	c
your	i
lifestyle	c
,	c
and	c
we	c
thought	c
this	c
show	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
good	c
opportunity	c
for	c
us	c
to	c
discorve	i
this	c
way	i
of	c
your	c
country	c
!	c

May	c
I	c
suggest	c
an	c
alternative	c
?	i

We	c
could	c
go	c
to	c
science	i
museum	c
on	c
wednesday	i
morning	c
and	c
to	c
the	c
National	c
Art	c
Gallery	c
.	i

We	c
only	c
need	c
wake	c
up	c
earlier	c
and	c
take	c
part	c
of	c
the	c
lunchtime	c
to	c
do	c
both	c
the	c
same	c
morning	c
,	c
but	c
that	c
would	c
leave	i
us	c
go	i
to	c
show	i
on	c
tuesday	i
,	c
because	c
we	c
can	c
use	c
the	i
wednesday	i
's	i
free	c
time	c
to	c
do	c
our	c
shopping	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
that	c
my	c
idea	c
sweet	i
you	c
and	c
you	c
'll	c
agree	c
.	c

Sincerely	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c

usual	c
,	c
it	c
's	c
a	c
pleisure	i
to	c
receive	c
a	i
word	i
from	c
you	c
.	c

The	c
last	c
book	c
I	c
read	c
was	c
Wuthering	c
Heights	c
by	c
Emilie	c
BrontÃ«	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
a	c
fantastique	i
book	c
,	c
which	c
I	c
recommend	c
to	c
everybody	c
keen	c
on	c
lovestories	i
.	c

It	c
's	c
a	c
perfect	c
combinaison	i
between	i
passion	c
and	c
life	i
difficulties	c
.	c

I	c
recone	i
that	c
it	c
's	c
quite	i
not	c
an	c
easy	c
reading	i
,	c
but	c
as	c
you	c
described	c
your	c
cousin	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
she	c
really	c
will	c
enjoy	c
it	c
,	c
she	c
's	c
such	i
good	c
in	i
litteracy	i
,	i
that	c
it	c
wo	c
n't	c
be	c
a	c
problem	c
for	c
her	c
.	c

Let	c
me	c
know	c
what	c
would	c
be	c
your	c
choice	c
.	c

Love	c
from	c
,	i

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
you	i
to	c
complain	c
about	c
,,Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
musical	i
show	c
which	c
took	c
a	i
place	c
in	c
The	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
several	c
weeks	c
ago	c
.	c

The	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
that	c
evening	c
and	c
I	c
had	i
not	i
recieved	i
the	i
explanations	i
why	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
whole	c
,	c
the	c
evening	c
was	c
boring	c
and	c
disappointing	c
.	c

Look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

How	c
has	c
morden	i
technology	c
changed	c
my	c
life	c
.	i

New	c
technologies	c
have	c
become	c
the	i
part	c
of	c
our	c
lives	c
.	c

Nevertheless	c
,	c
it	c
has	c
affected	c
every	c
person	c
and	c
hopefully	c
in	c
a	c
good	c
way	c
.	c

Using	c
microwave	i
oven	c
or	c
vacuum	c
cleaner	c
saves	c
me	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
time	c
.	c

Computer	i
is	c
extrrmely	i
convenient	i
in	i
writing	c
reports	c
and	c
essays	c
.	c

And	c
,	c
of	c
course	c
,	c
I	c
can	i
not	i
forget	c
about	c
cars	c
and	c
planes	c
that	c
deliver	i
us	c
to	c
all	c
parts	c
of	c
the	c
Earth	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
many	c
people	c
,	i
insist	c
that	c
new	c
technologies	c
affect	c
people	c
in	c
a	c
negative	c
way	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
better	i
prefer	c
seeing	c
my	c
father	c
talking	c
to	c
his	c
family	c
instead	c
of	c
staring	c
at	c
blue	i
screen	i
of	i
TV	i
.	c

But	c
also	c
,	i
I	c
would	i
not	i
be	i
able	c
to	c
imagine	c
my	c
life	c
without	c
the	i
nice	c
way	c
of	c
reciving	i
news	c
with	c
help	i
of	i
it	i
.	c

Modern	i
girl	c
or	c
boy	c
already	i
would	i
not	i
be	i
able	i
to	c
imagine	c
life	c
without	c
them	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
dangerous	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
knew	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
checked	c
everything	c
again	c
and	c
again	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
the	c
first	c
time	c
I	c
had	c
robbed	c
a	c
bank	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
her	c
best	c
friend	c
.	c

That	i
time	c
,	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
imagine	c
how	c
my	c
life	c
would	c
change	c
.	c

After	c
I	c
had	c
had	c
my	c
breakfast	c
I	c
put	c
my	c
clothes	c
on	c
.	c

Despite	c
feeling	c
really	c
bad	c
I	c
left	c
home	c
.	c

I	c
told	c
everybody	c
to	c
lie	c
down	c
.	c

They	c
did	c
it	c
.	c

The	c
policeman	c
arrested	c
me	c
and	c
I	c
stayed	i
in	c
a	i
prison	c
for	c
15	c
years	c
.	c

The	c
worst	c
thing	c
was	c
my	c
friend	c
died	c
after	i
10	i
days	i
I	c
was	c
arrested	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
about	c
our	c
class	c
trip	c
to	c
London	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
appreciate	c
you	i
well-organised	c
programme	c
,	c
especially	c
,	i
"	i
River	c
Trip	c
to	c
Greenwich	c
"	c
which	c
we	c
requested	c
.	c

It	c
would	i
be	c
the	c
most	c
excising	i
activity	c
in	i
this	c
trip	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
saw	c
the	c
advertisement	c
of	i
"	c
THE	c
LONDON	c
FASHION	c
AND	c
LEISURE	c
SHOW	c
"	c
in	c
the	c
newspaper	c
today	c
,	c
and	c
told	c
all	c
classmates	i
about	c
it	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
suggest	c
you	c
to	i
change	i
the	i
part	c
of	c
programme	i
for	i
visiting	i
this	c
show	c
.	c

14	c
,	c
March	c
,	c
and	c
open	i
from	c
10:00	c
to	c
19:00	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
our	c
programm	i
is	c
fixed	c
but	c
I	c
think	c
we	c
could	c
change	c
the	i
part	c
of	c
the	c
programme	c
.	c

Some	c
people	c
said	i
that	c
famous	c
people	c
such	c
as	c
politicians	c
,	c
and	c
film	c
stars	c
,	c
needs	i
to	c
have	c
a	c
private	c
life	c
without	c
journalists	c
following	c
them	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
.	c

I	c
strongly	c
agree	c
with	c
this	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
most	c
people	c
might	i
remember	c
the	c
sad	c
story	c
of	c
"	c
Princess	c
Diana	c
"	i
she	i
died	c
in	c
Paris	c
few	i
years	c
ago	c
while	c
she	c
was	c
escaping	c
from	c
lots	c
of	c
journalists	c
called	c
"	c
Paparach	i
"	c
.	c

If	c
she	c
was	i
not	i
followed	c
by	c
journalists	c
,	c
she	c
would	c
n't	c
die	i
.	c

So	c
,	c
this	c
fact	c
shows	c
obviously	c
that	c
famous	c
people	c
without	c
private	i
life	c
could	i
be	i
the	i
victim	i
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
people	c
are	c
interested	c
in	c
their	c
life	i
style	i
.	c

So	c
they	c
can	c
be	c
just	c
ordinaly	i
people	c
like	c
us	c
.	c

Overall	c
,	c
people	c
should	c
think	c
if	i
we	c
were	c
famous	c
people	c
...	c
and	c
then	c
we	c
can	c
find	c
the	c
answer	c
that	c
all	c
people	c
,	c
including	c
famous	c
people	c
,	c
need	c
private	i
life	c
and	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
behave	i
in	i
ordinaly	i
life	c
.	c

Dear	c
Ms	c
Clark	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
glad	c
to	c
write	c
to	c
you	c
.	c

I	c
enjoyed	c
most	c
of	c
the	c
events	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
feel	c
that	c
the	c
festival	c
could	c
be	c
even	c
better	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

Here	c
are	c
some	c
opinions	c
and	c
suggestions	c
:	c

Although	c
your	c
advertisement	c
said	c
there	c
would	c
be	c
stars	c
and	c
artists	c
from	c
around	c
the	c
world	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
able	c
to	c
see	c
artists	c
from	c
only	c
six	c
countries	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
there	c
was	c
one	c
reasonably-priced	i
weekend	c
ticket	c
for	c
all	c
events	c
.	c

Last	i
but	i
not	i
last	i
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
devoting	c
yourself	c
to	c
making	c
this	c
festival	c
wonderful	c
every	c
year	c
.	c

They	c
were	c
eagar	i
to	c
have	c
a	c
child	c
,	c
but	c
they	c
had	c
never	c
been	c
able	c
to	c
.	c

One	c
day	c
,	c
the	c
woman	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
riverside	c
,	c
and	c
found	c
a	c
peach	c
floating	c
in	c
the	c
river	c
.	c

They	c
named	c
him	c
Momotaro	c
,	c
and	c
looked	c
after	c
him	c
.	c

He	c
made	c
up	c
his	c
mind	c
to	c
defeat	c
them	c
,	c
and	c
asked	c
his	c
stepmother	c
for	c
some	c
kibidango	c
,	c
one	c
of	c
traditional	c
snacks	c
in	c
Japan	c
.	c

Having	c
eaten	c
the	c
kibidango	c
,	c
he	c
departed	c
for	c
Onigashima	c
with	c
three	c
friends	c
of	c
him	i
:	c
a	c
dog	c
,	c
a	c
monkey	c
and	c
a	c
bird	c
.	c

Reaching	c
the	c
island	c
,	c
he	c
and	c
his	c
friends	c
fought	c
bravely	c
against	c
the	c
devils	c
.	c

They	c
finally	c
succeeded	c
n	i
defeating	c
the	c
devils	c
,	c
and	c
took	c
back	c
all	c
the	c
money	c
and	c
treasures	i
.	c

Dear	c
Madame	i
,	c

First	c
at	i
all	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
some	c
further	c
information	c
from	i
me	c
and	c
secondly	c
,	c
I	i
'll	i
ask	i
you	c
for	i
some	c
doubts	i
that	c
I	c
have	c
.	c

With	c
regard	c
to	c
the	c
activities	c
at	c
the	c
Camp	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
choose	c
basketball	c
and	c
photography	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
basketball	c
is	c
very	i
complete	i
sport	c
for	c
training	c
your	c
muscles	c
and	c
I	c
used	c
to	c
play	c
in	c
a	c
league	c
in	c
my	c
country	c
,	i
it	i
's	i
hard	c
but	c
at	c
the	c
same	c
time	c
lovely	c
.	c

One	c
is	i
with	i
regard	i
to	i
how	c
much	c
additional	c
money	c
you	c
believe	c
will	c
be	c
enough	c
to	c
enjoy	c
the	c
holiday	c
?	i

Another	c
thing	c
is	i
if	c
the	c
meals	c
are	c
include	i
or	c
I	i
have	c
to	c
paid	i
for	c
them	c
?	i

Waiting	c
for	c
your	c
reply	c
,	c
best	c
wishes	c

Daniel	c
Ortiz	c

I	c
know	c
that	c
my	c
girlfriend	c
told	c
you	c
that	c
I	c
was	c
helping	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
and	c
enjoyed	c
it	c
very	c
much	c
.	c

Besides	i
,	c
she	c
told	c
me	c
that	c
you	c
are	c
very	c
keen	c
to	c
know	c
how	i
was	i
my	c
experience	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
'll	c
give	c
you	c
some	c
information	c
in	c
this	c
letter	c
that	c
I	c
'm	c
sure	c
you	c
will	c
be	c
glad	c
,	i
even	c
you	i
have	c
not	c
been	c
in	i
the	c
concert	c
.	c

First	c
at	i
all	c
,	c
I	c
'll	c
tell	c
you	c
that	c
in	i
the	c
day	c
concert	i
I	c
woke	c
up	c
at	c
6:30	c
A.M	i
,	c
very	c
early	c
for	c
me	c
,	i
you	i
know	c
me	c
I	i
'm	c
lazzy	i
,	i
the	i
work	c
began	c
around	c
8:30	c
,	i
was	i
very	c
hard	c
but	c
when	i
the	c
band	c
come	i
for	i
training	i
,	i
since	i
this	i
moment	c
I	c
was	i
enjoining	i
to	i
work	i
until	c
the	c
concert	c
had	c
finished	c
,	i
the	i
atmosphere	c
was	c
wonderful	c
,	c
the	c
musicians	c
were	c
very	c
kind	c
with	i
every	i
one	i
who	c
was	c
working	c
because	c
they	c
understood	c
that	c
a	i
concert	c
is	c
a	c
job	c
to	c
be	c
done	c
by	c
a	c
team	c
.	c

Looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hear	i
from	c
you	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
,	c

In	c
addition	c
we	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
about	i
the	c
programme	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
mention	c
that	c
this	i
day	c
we	c
are	c
going	c
to	c
visit	c
the	c
Science	c
Museum	c
in	c
the	c
morning	c
and	c
after	c
we	c
are	c
going	c
for	i
shopping	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
believe	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
a	c
good	c
change	i
for	c
all	c
of	c
us	c
to	c
attend	c
this	c
show	c
as	c
it	c
is	c
free	c
for	c
students	c
!	c

The	c
most	c
important	c
thing	c
is	c
that	c
the	c
time	c
that	c
the	c
show	c
starts	c
is	c
perfect	c
and	c
is	c
suitable	i
as	c
well	c
with	c
our	c
programme	c
because	c
until	i
19:00	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
everyone	c
will	c
have	c
finished	c
their	c
shopping	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
more	c
details	c
about	c
the	c
show	c
and	c
particularly	c
what	i
does	i
it	c
include	i
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
it	i
will	i
be	i
a	i
great	i
opportunity	i
to	i
all	i
of	i
us	i
to	i
be	i
on	i
this	i
show	i
while	c
we	c
are	c
going	i
to	i
be	i
in	c
London	c
.	c

But	c
,	i
if	c
there	c
is	c
a	c
problem	c
that	i
the	c
show	c
is	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
afternoon	c
,	c
the	c
same	c
hour	i
with	i
shopping	i
,	c
I	c
suggest	c
having	i
the	i
shopping	c
on	c
Wednesday	c
afternoon	c
that	i
we	c
will	c
not	c
have	c
anything	c
to	c
do	c
!	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
your	c
reply	c
,	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

Some	c
people	c
think	c
that	c
to	i
be	i
a	c
famous	c
person	c
is	c
very	i
excuiting	i
thing	c
,	c
that	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
this	c
makes	c
you	c
feel	c
completely	i
and	c
also	c
they	c
think	c
that	c
if	c
you	c
are	c
famous	c
you	c
are	c
special	c
as	c
well	c
.	c

I	c
believe	c
,	i
that	c
if	c
somebody	c
wants	c
the	i
fame	c
and	c
the	i
glory	c
must	i
be	c
tottally	i
sure	i
about	c
the	c
results	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
the	i
politicians	c
the	i
have	c
choosed	i
their	c
careers	c
,	i
they	c
must	c
know	c
that	c
they	i
are	i
going	i
to	i
involved	i
with	i
everything	i
that	i
it	i
has	i
to	i
do	i
with	i
publicity	i
and	i
their	i
country	i
and	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
is	i
that	c
they	c
have	c
to	c
realize	c
that	c
they	c
should	c
be	c
extremely	c
careful	c
of	i
their	c
movements	c
or	c
else	c
they	c
are	c
going	c
to	c
have	c
bad	i
reputation	c
,	c
and	c
they	c
will	c
be	i
not	i
trustworthy	i
.	c

If	c
somebody	c
is	c
a	c
film	c
star	c
this	c
mean	i
that	c
has	i
got	c
a	c
different	c
kind	c
of	c
life	c
,	c
more	i
comfortable	c
,	c
more	c
interesting	c
but	i
it	c
does	c
n't	c
mean	c
that	c
he	c
or	c
she	c
ca	c
n't	c
be	c
like	c
normal	c
people	c
even	c
if	c
he	c
or	c
she	c
is	c
a	c
star	c
.	c

Everybody	c
deserve	i
to	c
have	c
a	c
private	c
life	c
even	c
if	c
he	c
is	c
a	c
plumber	c
or	c
even	c
if	c
she	c
is	c
a	c
famous	c
singer	c
.	c

It	c
does	c
n't	c
matter	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
carreer	i
or	c
job	c
you	c
are	i
follow	i
.	c

You	c
must	c
control	c
your	c
behaviour	c
and	c
try	c
not	c
implove	i
so	c
much	c
yourself	c
.	c

And	c
finally	c
the	c
journalists	c
the	i
should	c
know	c
how	c
to	c
respect	c
the	c
private	c
life	i
of	c
everyone	c
and	c
not	c
trying	i
to	c
make	c
money	c
for	i
a	i
living	i
by	c
using	c
the	c
reputation	c
of	c
the	i
famous	c
people	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
impressed	c
and	c
I	c
wish	c
you	c
could	c
make	c
the	c
festival	c
better	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

You	c
should	c
pick	c
only	c
six	c
countries	c
,	c
so	c
it	c
wo	c
n't	c
be	c
very	c
busy	c
and	c
another	c
reason	c
is	c
that	c
the	c
concert	c
hall	c
is	c
too	c
small	c
that	i
the	c
people	c
ca	i
n't	i
even	c
dance	c
in	i
classical	c
concerts	c
.	c

This	c
years	c
'	c
'	c
plays	c
and	c
films	c
'	c
was	c
too	c
short	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
disappointed	c
about	c
this	c
,	c
but	c
the	c
other	c
shows	c
were	c
great	c
.	c

I	c
felt	c
very	c
good	c
about	c
all	c
these	c
shows	c
.	c

What	c
do	c
you	c
think	c
about	c
picking	c
five	c
people	c
and	c
give	i
them	c
tickets	c
for	c
'	c
Art	c
Travel	c
'	c
?	c

I	c
think	c
this	c
is	c
a	c
good	c
idea	c
.	c

Generally	c
it	c
was	c
very	c
good	c
and	c
I	c
wish	i
more	c
people	c
would	i
come	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

Do	c
you	c
want	c
to	c
know	c
about	c
our	c
country	c
's	c
rules	c
?	c

I	c
think	c
your	c
country	c
and	c
our	c
country	c
's	c
rules	c
are	c
the	c
same	c
.	c

When	c
we	c
need	c
to	c
go	c
upstairs	c
,	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
keep	c
left	c
and	c
when	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
go	c
downstairs	c
,	c
you	c
need	c
to	c
keep	c
left	c
as	c
well	c
.	c

You	c
have	c
to	c
do	c
your	c
homework	c
and	c
do	c
your	c
best	c
what	i
you	c
're	c
asked	c
to	c
do	c
.	c

Some	c
family	i
have	c
rules	c
that	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
put	i
spoons	c
and	c
dishes	c
everyday	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
the	c
main	c
rule	c
is	c
when	c
you	c
can	c
play	c
computer	c
games	c
,	c
because	c
they	c
love	c
computer	c
games	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
curious	c
about	c
it	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
wonder	c
if	c
you	c
know	c
it	i
will	i
have	i
"	c
London	c
fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
"	i
be	i
showed	i
on	c
Tuesday	c
in	i
Central	i
Exhibition	c
Hall	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
we	c
do	c
n't	c
want	c
lose	i
this	c
chance	c
.	c

Best	c
Wishes	c

That	c
was	c
a	c
very	c
hot	c
summer	c
,	i
every	i
people	c
in	c
our	c
city	c
like	i
to	c
swim	c
in	c
the	c
river	c
,	i
perhaps	i
they	c
did	c
n't	c
think	c
it	c
was	c
interesting	c
if	c
they	c
swimed	i
in	c
the	c
pool	c
.	c

One	c
day	c
,	c
I	c
passed	c
by	c
a	c
river	c
in	i
accident	i
,	i
I	c
saw	c
there	c
were	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
people	c
playing	c
in	c
the	c
river	c
.	c

Suddenly	c
,	c
I	c
heard	c
of	i
"	c
help	i
,	c
help	c
"	c
in	c
my	i
distance	c
.	c

I	c
started	c
think	i
about	c
it	c
,	i
after	i
all	c
,	c
either	i
had	i
I	i
neve	i
done	i
this	i
task	i
before	i
,	i
or	i
trained	i
.	c

I	c
also	c
extremely	i
hated	c
those	c
people	c
who	c
stood	c
there	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
went	i
the	c
river-side	i
bank	c
,	c
I	c
saw	c
some	c
red-faced	i
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
organising	c
an	c
International	c
Arts	c
Festival	c
was	c
a	c
great	c
idea	c
.	c

I	c
enjoyed	c
it	c
and	c
found	c
worthy	i
to	i
visit	i
.	c

The	c
Annual	c
International	c
Arts	c
Festival	c
,	c
which	c
was	c
held	c
on	c
the	c
21st	c
and	c
22nd	c
of	c
November	c
,	c
was	c
colourful	c
with	c
the	i
stars	c
and	c
artist	i
coming	c
from	c
around	c
the	c
world	c
.	c

Although	c
this	c
was	c
true	c
,	c
they	c
were	c
from	c
only	c
six	c
countries	c
.	c

You	c
could	c
have	c
let	c
us	c
get	c
used	i
to	i
more	c
cultures	c
by	c
inviting	c
from	i
some	c
other	c
countries	c
too	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
could	c
hardly	c
participated	i
in	i
all	c
of	c
the	c
concerts	c
.	c

Thanks	c
for	c
everything	c
.	c

Yours	c
Sincerely	i
,	c

Dear	c
Ana	c
,	c

Everywhere	c
and	c
everytime	i
in	c
our	c
lives	c
we	c
face	i
with	c
the	i
rules	c
.	c

At	c
schools	i
we	c
have	c
certain	c
rules	c
like	c
being	c
in	c
the	c
class	c
,	c
sitting	c
in	c
your	c
place	c
before	c
the	c
lecture	c
starts	c
,	c
bringing	c
in	c
your	c
equipment	c
with	c
you	c
,	c
keeping	c
quiet	c
during	c
the	c
lessons	c
and	c
raising	c
your	c
hand	c
when	c
you	c
want	c
to	c
talk	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
these	c
are	c
international	c
rules	c
which	c
help	c
things	c
to	c
go	i
in	c
order	c
.	c

You	c
should	c
wear	c
the	c
same	c
things	c
every	c
time	c
,	c
no	c
changes	c
and	c
alternations	c
are	c
allowed	c
.	c

It	c
makes	c
us	c
like	c
robots	c
and	c
feel	i
bad	c
psychologically	c
,	c
because	c
we	c
want	c
to	c
be	c
different	c
and	c
free	c
in	c
wearing	i
.	c

They	c
do	c
n't	c
care	c
if	c
we	c
have	c
problems	c
,	c
exams	c
to	c
study	c
or	i
if	c
we	c
are	c
ill	c
.	c

You	c
should	c
be	c
punctual	c
when	c
coming	c
to	c
dining	i
table	c
,	c
respectful	c
,	c
do	c
your	c
home	i
works	i
and	c
watch	c
TV	c
less	c
and	c
not	c
too	c
loud	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
change	c
the	c
attendance	c
and	c
clothing	c
rules	c
in	c
school	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
the	i
enough	c
power	c
.	c

They	c
are	c
against	c
democracy	c
I	c
think	c
.	c

With	c
all	c
my	c
love	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
a	c
musical	i
show	c
that	c
I	c
saw	c
in	i
your	c
theatre	c
.	c

This	c
situation	c
made	c
me	c
feel	c
very	c
disappointed	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
coffe	i
after	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
but	c
when	c
I	c
tried	c
to	c
get	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

A	c
police	c
officer	c
who	c
was	c
there	c
told	c
me	c
that	c
the	c
manager	c
of	c
the	c
restaurant	c
was	c
ill	c
and	c
that	c
he	c
did	i
n't	i
allowed	i
anyone	c
to	c
open	c
it	c
.	c

This	c
was	c
the	c
worst	c
night	c
that	c
I	c
had	c
during	c
my	c
stay	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

For	c
all	c
that	i
reasons	c
,	c
I	c
want	c
you	c
to	c
refund	c
the	c
cost	c
of	c
the	c
tickets	c
and	c
to	c
send	c
the	c
money	c
back	i
to	c
my	c
house	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

Her	c
school	i
's	i
class-matters	i
were	c
going	c
to	c
give	i
their	c
friend	c
Maria	c
a	c
party	c
and	c
it	c
was	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
a	c
surprise	c
to	i
her	c
.	c

That	c
day	i
afternoon	c
they	c
arrived	c
at	c
Paula	c
's	c
house	c
in	i
order	i
to	c
decorate	c
the	c
place	c
.	c

Ballons	i
and	c
coloured	c
lights	c
were	c
put	c
in	c
all	c
the	c
trees	c
.	c

Some	c
time	c
later	c
all	i
the	i
things	i
were	i
finally	c
prepared	c
.	c

But	c
things	c
did	c
n't	c
happen	c
as	c
they	c
had	i
been	i
planned	i
.	c

Because	c
when	c
Maria	c
reached	c
the	c
house	c
,	c
they	c
realised	c
that	c
she	c
had	c
been	c
told	c
about	c
the	c
party	c
and	c
they	c
supposed	c
that	c
Pat	c
had	c
done	c
this	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
happy	c
to	c
know	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
you	i
competition	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
all	c
the	c
details	c
that	c
you	c
need	c
from	c
me	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
I	c
think	c
California	c
is	c
better	c
in	c
Summer	c
.	c

Regarding	c
accommodation	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
because	c
cabins	c
seem	c
to	c
be	c
more	c
comfortable	c
than	c
tents	c
.	c

According	c
to	c
your	c
letter	c
,	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
take	c
part	c
in	c
two	c
activities	c
at	c
the	c
Camp	c
.	c

Let	c
me	c
tell	c
you	c
that	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
sing	c
and	c
play	c
tennis	c
.	c

As	c
a	c
matter	c
of	c
fact	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
both	c
of	c
them	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
you	c
to	c
tell	c
me	c
if	c
I	c
will	c
need	c
some	c
special	c
clothes	c
.	c

If	c
the	c
answer	c
is	c
yes	c
,	c
could	c
you	c
tell	c
me	c
which	i
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
will	c
need	c
.	c

One	c
other	c
thing	c
,	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
useful	c
to	c
know	c
if	c
I	c
will	c
need	c
to	c
take	c
with	c
me	c
some	c
extra	c
money	c
.	c

If	c
the	c
answer	c
is	c
yes	c

could	c
you	c
tell	c
me	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
will	c

I	c

we	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c

It	c
takes	c
place	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
14th	c
and	c
begins	c
at	c
ten	c
o'clock	c

I	c
strongly	c

that	c
we	c
will	c
be	c
at	i
the	i
right	i
time	i

FANCY	c
GETTING	c
TO	c
KNOW	c
THE	c
FUTURE	c
?	c

Do	c
you	c
think	c
you	c
've	c
the	i
future	c
in	c
your	c
hands	c
?	c

Do	c
you	c
think	c
we	c
're	c
living	c
like	c
old	i
times	c
?	c

Would	c
you	c
like	c
living	i
in	c
a	c
modern	c
way	c
?	c

Can	c
you	c
compare	c
it	c
.	c

Well	c
,	c
you	c
can	c
look	c
at	c
your	c
house	c
.	c

Maybe	c
,	c
in	c
a	c
few	c
years	i
later	i
we	c
'll	c
have	c
a	c
bigger	c
TV	c
,	c
a	c
more	c
suitable	c
radio	c
but	c
,	c
from	i
my	i
point	i
of	i
view	i
,	c
I	c
think	c
these	c
facts	c
will	c
not	c
change	c
the	i
way	c
of	c
our	i
lifes	i
.	c

We	c
will	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
accelerate	i
the	c
process	i
of	c
the	i
computer	i
's	i
games	c
for	i
example	c
...	c

But	c
not	c
in	c
the	i
strange	c
way	c
you	c
can	c
imagine	c
...	c

I	c
mean	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
think	c
we	c
'll	c
change	c
cars	c
by	i
aereoplanes	i
...	c

In	i
this	i
way	i
,	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
be	c
calm	c
because	c
as	i
you	c
know	c
the	i
things	c
are	c
developing	c
in	i
the	c
same	c
way	c
you'r	i
changing	c
,	c
too	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
we	c
have	c
the	c
future	c
in	c
our	c
hands	c
!	c

Think	c
about	c
it	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
certain	c
that	c
the	c
programme	c
will	c
give	c
the	c
students	c
considerable	c
enjoyment	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
we	c
have	c
found	c
an	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
show	c
,	c
which	c
will	c
be	c
held	c
at	c
Central	c
Exhibition	c
Hall	c
on	c
14th	c
of	c
March	c
.	c

The	c
advertisement	c
says	c
that	c
the	c
show	c
is	c
full	c
of	c
many	c
interesting	c
programmes	c
,	c
such	c
as	c
the	c
latest	c
fashions	c
,	c
leisure	c
and	c
sports	c
wear	c
,	c
make	i
up	i
and	c
hairstyles	c
etc.	c
Moreover	c
,	c
students	c
are	c
allowed	c
to	c
admit	i
for	c
free	c
.	c

All	c
of	c
us	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
attend	c
the	c
show	c
because	c
young	c
people	c
,	c
particularly	c
girls	c
are	i
interested	c
in	c
fashion	c
and	c
make	i
up	i
,	c
so	c
we	c
are	c
expecting	c
the	c
show	c
will	i
be	i
the	i
great	c
opportunity	c
to	c
see	c
what	c
the	c
new	c
trend	i
in	c
fashion	c
will	c
be	c
like	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Today	c
,	c
however	c
,	c
people	c
do	c
not	c
need	c
to	c
spend	c
many	i
times	i
on	c
making	c

washing	c
up	c

or	c
even	c
on	c

From	i

I	c

this	c
film	c
and	c
will	c
not	c
have	c
enough	c
time	c
to	c
go	c
there	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
in	i
tents	c
as	c
a	i
accommodation	c
because	c
it	c
sounds	c
thrilling	c
and	c
even	c
ecstatic	i
for	c
me	c
and	i
also	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
tried	c
this	c

of	c
accommodation	c
before	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
choose	c
Swimming	c
and	c
Tennis	c

To	c
produce	c
a	c
film	c
is	c
very	c
hard	c
work	c

I	c
must	c
keep	c
a	i
good	c
condition	c
to	c
make	c
a	c

Swimming	c
is	c
really	c

I	c
can	c

for	c

On	c
the	c

tennis	c
stimulates	c
my	c

It	c
is	c
good	c
for	c
my	c

I	c

Bye	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
the	c
programme	c
you	c
have	c
organised	c
for	c
our	c
visit	c
to	c
London	c
.	c

As	c
we	c
are	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
in	c
London	c
on	c
this	c
date	c
,	c
we	c
think	c
,	i
it	c
could	c
be	c
a	c
great	c
oppurtunity	i
for	c
us	c
to	c
go	c
there	c
because	c
we	c
are	c
very	c
interested	c
in	c
the	c
latest	c
fashions	c
,	c
make	c
up	c
,	c
etc.	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
free	c
for	c
students	c
.	c

Because	c
of	c
this	c
reasons	i
,	c
we	c
would	c
kindy	i
ask	c
you	c
to	c
change	c
the	c
programme	c
,	i
so	c
that	c
we	c
could	c
go	c
to	c
this	c
especial	i
event	c
.	c

Hoping	c
on	i
your	c
agreement	c
and	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

It	c
was	c
dangerous	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
knew	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
.	c

Although	c
my	c
parents	c
were	c
very	c
happy	c
of	i
having	c
such	c
an	i
especial	i
opportunity	c
visiting	i
a	c
place	c
with	c
no	c
tourists	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
little	c
bit	c
scared	c
.	c

The	c
first	c
week	c
was	c
find	i
,	c
but	c
on	i
the	c
second	c
week	c
I	c
got	c
very	c
seek	i
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
was	c
the	c
water	c
.	c

My	c
mother	c
tried	c
to	c
get	c
a	c
doctor	c
,	c
but	c
they	c
said	c
there	c
was	c
no	c
one	c
.	c

Some	c
days	c
later	c
we	c
went	c
back	c
to	c
Dehli	c
and	c
having	i
being	i
to	c
the	c
doctor	c
and	c
having	c
again	c
bottled	i
water	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
feeling	c
healthy	c
again	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Ryan	c

Now	c
I	c
can	c
realize	c
one	c
of	c
my	c
dream	i
.	c

I	c
can	c
give	c
you	c
all	c
the	c
information	c
that	c
you	c
need	c
.	c

I	c
prefer	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
the	c
only	c
month	c
I	c
can	c
have	c
two	c
weeks	i
holiday	c
.	c

For	c
the	c
accommodation	c
I	c
prefer	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
some	c
problems	c
with	c
my	c
back	c
and	c
I	c
need	c
a	c
bed	c
to	c
sleep	c
in	c
.	c

I	c
can	c
do	c
two	c
activities	c
during	c
my	c
stay	c
at	c
the	c
camp	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
a	c
good	c
level	c
in	i
swimming	c
and	c
I	c
have	i
done	i
some	c
competitions	c
last	c
year	c
which	c
I	c
have	i
won	i
.	c

For	c
the	c
second	c
activity	c
I	c
choose	i
photography	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
take	i
a	c
photography	c
course	c
the	i
last	c
two	c
years	c
so	c
I	c
am	c
able	c
to	c
do	i
some	c
beautiful	c
pictures	c
.	c

I	c
thank	c
you	c
in	c
advance	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

You	c
want	c
to	c
hear	c
about	c
my	c
experience	c
in	i
helping	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
.	c

You	c
could	c
speak	c
to	c
them	c
and	c
you	c
could	c
see	c
that	c
a	c
lot	c
were	c
very	c
cool	c
and	c
the	c
other	c
ones	c
were	c
still	i
in	i
the	i
sky	i
.	c

And	c
you	c
heard	c
the	c
concerts	c
too	c
.	c

After	c
the	c
concert	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
clean	c
the	c
area	c
and	c
it	c
took	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
because	c
people	c
were	i
like	c
pigs	c
.	c

One	c
more	c
word	c
!	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
very	c
positive	c
experience	c
.	c

I	c
did	c
n't	c
regret	c
it	c
and	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
again	c
!	c

Write	c
me	i
soon	c
.	c

Love	c
,	c

Dear	c
Jane	c
Clark	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
providing	i
International	i
Arts	c
Festival	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
absolutely	i
great	c
idea	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
it	c
might	c
be	c
better	c
to	c
have	c
time	c
with	c
variety	i
nationallites	i
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
the	c
music	c
concerts	c
were	c
very	c
exciting	c
and	c
had	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
fun	c
,	c
but	c
some	c
concert	c
halls	c
were	c
too	c
small	c
to	c
enjoy	c
them	c
comfortably	c
.	c

Thirdly	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
expecting	c
to	c
watch	c
more	c
films	c
and	c
plays	c
which	i
were	c
impressive	c
.	c

Lastly	c
,	c
it	c
could	c
be	c
nice	c
to	i
students	c
who	c
are	c
interested	c
in	c
arts	i
,	c
if	c
you	c
help	i
special	c
events	c
,	c
for	c
instance	c
,	c
song	i
contest	c
,	c
writing	c
competition	c
or	c
dance	c
lessons	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

PART	c
TIME	c
JOBS	c
:	c
Find	c
in	i
your	c
place	c

That	c
is	c
very	c
important	c
to	c
find	c
a	c
way	c
for	i
earning	c
and	c
saving	c
money	c
.	c

Probably	c
the	c
best	c
way	c
you	c
can	c
get	c
money	c
is	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
part	i
time	i
job	c
in	c
your	c
spare	c
time	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
recommending	c
you	c
to	i
check	i
your	c
possible	c
time	c
to	c
work	c
-	c
weekdays	c
or	c
weekend	c
?	c
-	c
before	c
you	c
request	i
a	c
job	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
go	c
to	c
your	c
school	c
or	c
local	c
council	c
.	c

They	c
will	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
help	c
to	c
find	c
safe	c
and	c
suitable	c
jobs	c
for	c
students	c
like	c
you	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
as	i
your	c
family	c
or	c
friends	c
.	c

As	c
they	c
know	c
about	c
your	c
interestings	i
and	c
personality	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
easy	c
to	c
help	c
you	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
case	c
,	c
I	i
could	i
get	i
a	i
telephone	i
researcher	i
part	i
by	i
my	i
friend	i
's	i
reference	i
.	i

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
do	c
n't	c
forget	c
that	c
a	c
job	c
is	c
just	c
spent	i
in	c
your	c
"	c
spare	c
"	c
time	c
.	c

That	c
's	c
it	c
!	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
make	c
a	c
complaint	c
about	c
the	c
show	c
'	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
'	c
.	c

During	c
my	c
stay	c
in	c
London	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
your	c
theatre	c
to	c
see	c
this	c
show	c
.	c

As	i
it	c
is	i
said	i
in	c
your	c
advertisement	c
,	i
the	c
show	c
is	i
starring	i
Danny	c
Brook	c
but	i
there	c
was	c
different	i
actor	c
.	i

The	c
show	c
had	i
to	c
start	c
at	c
19:30	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
.	c

You	c
promised	c
that	c
there	c
will	i
be	c
discounts	c
,	c
but	c
when	c
I	c
came	i
,	c
I	c
found	c
out	c
,	i
that	c
they	c
were	c
not	c
available	c
.	c

I	c
invited	c
a	c
friend	c
of	c
mine	c
and	c
promised	c
her	c
that	c
we	c
will	i
go	c
there	c
.	c

And	c
what	c
I	c
found	c
out	c
.	c

Your	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

Everything	c
was	c
just	c
vice	i
versa	i
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
not	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

It	c
happened	c
at	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
school	i
year	c
.	c

My	c
class	c
was	c
going	c
to	c
a	c
night	i
disco	i
and	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
go	c
there	c
too	c
.	c

I	c
asked	c
my	c
parents	c
if	c
I	c
could	c
go	c
,	c
but	c
they	c
did	c
not	c
let	c
me	c
do	c
that	c
.	c

But	c
she	c
told	c
it	c
to	c
very	i
kid	c
in	c
school	c
,	c
even	c
the	c
teachers	c
heard	c
it	c
.	c

It	c
occured	i
that	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
teachers	c
told	c
my	c
parents	c
about	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
should	i
be	c
bigger	c
for	c
jazz	c
,	c
rock	c
or	c
still	i
classical	c
concerts	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
some	c
ideas	c
for	c
the	c
next	c
year	i
events	c
,	c
such	c
as	c
:	i

-	c
Dance	c
shows	c
after	c
dinner	c
to	c
have	i
something	c
interesting	c
to	c
do	c
in	c
the	c
night	c
,	i

-	c
Art	c
exbitions	i
to	c
know	i
more	i
things	c
about	c
artist	i
's	c
lifestyle	c
;	c
and	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
I	c
hope	i
will	i
be	c
better	c
next	c
year	c
if	c
these	c
points	c
was	i
observed	c
for	i
the	i
each	i
year	i
the	i
event	i
to	i
be	i
better	c
than	c
before	c
.	c

Sincerely	c

How	c
are	c
you	c
?	c

Well	c
,	c
about	c
rules	c
in	c
my	c
contry	i
,	c
is	i
not	c
different	c
than	i
another	i
countries	c
.	c

While	c
I	c
was	c
staying	c
in	c
London	c
for	c
a	c
holiday	c
,	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
to	c
see	c
OVER	c
THE	c
RAINBOW	c
in	c
the	c
evening	c
.	c

That	c
made	c
me	c
feel	c
disappointed	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
the	c
actor	c
was	c
different	c
from	c
your	i
advertisement	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
it	i
took	i
times	i
to	i
wait	i
about	c
forty	i
five	i
minutes	c
,	c
because	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
.	c

It	c
should	c
be	c
on	c
time	c
at	c
19:30	c
.	c

Then	c
it	c
had	c
no	c
discounts	c
,	c
which	c
the	c
advertisement	c
said	c
so	c
.	c

Besides	c
this	c
,	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	i
early	i
closed	i
.	c

Lastly	c
,	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
think	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
my	c
perfect	c
evening	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
get	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
replying	i
from	c
you	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

Griffin	c
,	c
who	c
is	c
a	c
teacher	c
,	c
was	c
n't	c
surprised	c
at	c
our	c
preparation	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
so	i
close	c
to	c
be	i
on	i
his	c
birthday	c
,	c
so	c
we	c
made	c
a	c
decision	c
to	c
hold	c
a	c
small	c
party	c
for	c
him	c
.	c

That	c
caused	c
the	c
secret	c
disclosed	i
.	c

Although	c
he	c
was	c
n't	c
surprised	c
,	c
he	c
was	c
glad	c
and	c
pleased	c
with	c
our	c
party	c
.	c

Anyway	c
,	c
Happy	c
Birthday	c
to	c
Griffin	c
,	c
again	c
.	c

Dear	c
Jean	c
Clark	c
,	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
the	c
International	c
Arts	c
Festival	c
is	c
a	c
wonderful	c
idea	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
the	c
opportunity	c
to	c
enjoy	c
different	c
arts	c
events	c
.	c

But	c
it	c
is	c
also	c
true	c
I	c
could	c
just	c
see	c
stars	c
and	c
artists	c
on	c
stage	c
from	c
only	c
six	c
countries	c
,	c
not	c
stars	c
from	c
around	c
the	c
world	c
as	c
you	c
announce	i
in	c
your	c
advertisement	c
.	c

Secondly	c
I	i
really	c
enjoyed	c
the	c
jazz	c
and	c
classical	c
concerts	c
in	c
spite	c
of	c
the	c
fact	c
that	c
some	c
of	c
them	c
were	i
taken	i
place	c
in	c
too	c
small	c
concert	c
halls	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
hearing	i
from	c
you	c
.	c

Dear	c
George	c
,	c

As	c
you	c
tell	i
me	c
in	c
your	c
last	c
letter	c
you	i
were	c
talking	c
about	c
rules	c
in	c
your	c
class	c
and	c
you	c
want	i
to	c
know	c
about	c
school	c
rules	c
in	c
my	c
country	c
and	c
also	c
what	c
I	c
am	c
allowed	c
to	c
do	c
at	c
home	c
.	c

First	c
I	i
must	c
tell	c
you	c
that	c
teachers	i
are	c
strict	c
at	c
school	c
.	c

We	c
are	c
n't	c
allowed	c
to	c
eat	c
in	c
the	c
classrooms	c
and	c
in	c
addition	c
to	c
this	c
we	c
must	c
sit	c
down	c
in	i
individual	c
desks	c
.	c

Granny	c
is	c
the	c
problem	c
she	i
's	c
a	c
bit	c
bossy	c
!	c

She	c
usually	c
tells	c
me	c
what	c
to	c
do	c
and	c
what	c
kind	i
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
should	c
wear	c
but	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
care	i
about	i
it	i
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
as	c
a	c
representative	c
of	c
the	c
class	c
about	c
the	c
3-day	c
school	c
trip	c
which	c
has	c
been	c
organized	c
for	c
next	c
week	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
the	c
excellent	c
organization	c
of	c
this	c
trip	c
which	c
seems	c
to	c
be	c
very	c
interesting	c
and	c
useful	c
for	c
the	c
students	c
.	c

Especially	i
I	i
believe	c
that	c
the	c
visit	c
to	c
the	c
National	c
Art	c
Gallery	c
will	c
be	c
a	c
really	c
exciting	c
experience	c
for	c
all	c
of	c
us	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
some	c
of	c
them	c
have	c
read	c
an	c
advertisment	i
about	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
,	c
which	c
will	c
take	c
place	c
at	c
the	c
Central	c
Exhibition	c
Hall	c
in	c
London	c
on	c
14th	c
March	c
.	c

The	c
Exhibition	c
will	c
show	c
all	c
the	c
latest	c
fashion	i
in	i
a	c
very	c
wide	c
range	c
from	c
sports	i
wear	i
to	c
make	i
up	i
and	c
even	c
hairstyles	c
.	c

What	c
is	c
more	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
is	c
free	c
for	c
all	c
the	i
students	c
.	c

We	c
feel	c
that	c
taking	c
part	c
to	i
it	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
to	i
us	c
since	c
we	c
will	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
have	i
some	c
information	c
about	c
the	c
world	c
of	c
fashion	c
,	c
which	c
is	c
becoming	c
more	c
and	c
more	c
important	c
in	c
our	c
days	i
.	c

Under	i
the	i
circumstances	i
,	c
I	c
was	c
asked	c
by	c
the	c
class	c
to	c
inform	c
you	c
about	c
the	c
show	c
and	c
to	c
ask	c
if	c
it	c
could	i
be	c
possible	c
to	c
make	c
some	c
changes	c
in	i
the	c
programme	c
if	c
it	c
could	i
to	i
visit	i
the	c
Exhibition	i
.	c

It	c
will	c
take	c
place	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
from	c
10.00am	c
to	c
19.00pm	i
,	c
so	c
we	c
could	c
give	c
up	c
the	i
shopping	c
and	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
show	c
in	c
the	c
afternoon	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
will	c
consider	c
this	c
possibility	c
and	c
tell	c
us	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c
if	c
you	c
intend	c
to	c
accept	c
our	c
proposal	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	i

Being	c
famous	i
and	i
risk	i
is	c
something	c
all	c
of	c
us	c
have	c
dreamt	c
of	c
sometimes	i
.	c

But	c
not	i
always	i
famous	i
people	i
are	i
happy	c
of	i
their	c
condition	i
.	c

Usually	c
if	c
you	c
ask	c
them	c
what	c
they	c
would	i
desire	c
most	c
,	c
the	c
answer	c
is	c
:	c
"	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
live	c
like	c
ordinary	c
people	c
do	c
"	i

But	c
the	c
worst	c
thing	c
of	c
all	c
is	c
that	c
they	c
are	c
often	c
victim	i
of	c
malicious	c
gossips	i
,	c
which	c
most	c
of	c
the	c
times	i
are	i
not	c
even	c
true	c
.	c

Also	c
the	c
most	c
famous	c
star	c
can	c
be	c
unhappy	c
and	c
depresed	i
:	c
not	i
always	i
,	i
in	i
fact	i
,	i
money	i
and	i
celebrity	i
being	i
happiness	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
just	c
recieved	i
the	c
letter	c
,	c
which	c
lets	c
me	c
know	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
therefore	c
writing	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
my	c
further	c
information	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
student	c
and	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
can	c
afford	c
to	c
go	c
on	c
holiday	c
only	c
in	c
July	c
.	c

The	c
next	c
consideration	c
is	c
the	c
activities	c
.	c

Therefore	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
choose	c
basketball	c
and	c
tennis	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
considering	i
about	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
should	c
wear	c
and	c
how	c
much	c
I	c
need	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
be	c
most	c
grateful	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
give	c
me	c
further	c
advicable	i
information	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

Hello	c
!	c

All	c
work	i
I	c
needed	c
to	c
do	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
interesting	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
asked	c
if	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
sit	c
down	c
in	c
front	c
of	c
stage	i
.	c

It	c
was	c
absolutely	c
fantastic	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
ever	c
never	c
sit	i
down	c
there	c
.	c

Additionally	c
,	c
you	c
could	i
n't	i
believe	c
,	i
but	c
the	c
vocalist	c
said	c
"	c
All	c
the	c
chairs	c
you	c
are	c
sitting	c
down	i
were	i
set	c
from	i
him	c
,	c
"	c
pointing	c
at	c
me	c
!	c
!	c

Actually	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
bit	c
ashamed	c
but	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
my	c
brilliant	c
memory	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
suggest	c
you	c
should	c
try	c
as	c
I	c
did	c
if	c
you	c
have	c
any	c
opportunity	c
.	c

Can	c
you	c
send	c
me	c
the	i
letter	c
back	c
writing	c
what	c
happend	i
to	c
you	c
recently	c
.	i

Love	c
,	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
,	c

The	c
show	c
is	c
opened	i
between	c
ten	c
and	c
seven	c
p.m	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
,	c
March	c
14	c
at	i
Central	i
Exhibition	c
Hall	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

Latest	i
fashions	c
,	c
leisure	c
and	c
sports	c
wear	c
,	c
make	i
up	i
and	c
hairstyles	c
are	c
expected	c
to	c
be	c
displayed	c
and	c
studied	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
,	c
the	i
addmission	i
for	c
students	c
is	c
free	c
.	c

Taking	c
the	c
programme	c
and	c
the	c
show	c
into	c
consideration	c
,	c
we	c
suggest	c
that	c
we	c
can	i
have	c
time	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
show	c
in	c
the	c
afternoon	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
.	c

We	c
hope	c
that	c
you	c
consider	c
our	c
suggestion	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerily	i
,	c

The	c
ways	c
of	c
living	c
are	c
always	c
changing	c
.	c

Thinking	c
about	c
the	c
home	c
of	c
the	c
future	c
,	c
first	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
nuclear	c
families	c
should	c
be	c
expected	c
because	c
of	c
new	c
technologies	c
,	c
which	c
make	c
house-keeping	c
easier	c
and	c
simpler	c
and	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
idea	c
which	c
encourages	c
us	c
to	c
live	c
in	c
cities	c
for	c
convenient	i
life	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
the	c
bond	c
between	c
parents	c
and	c
children	c
should	i
be	i
unlikly	i
to	c
change	c
.	c

The	c
longer	c
and	c
further	i
they	c
live	c
on	c
their	c
own	c
,	c
the	c
more	c
they	c
may	c
feel	c
that	c
they	c
need	c
a	c
family	c
.	c

Hopefully	c
,	c
the	c
minds	c
of	c
people	c
will	c
stay	c
peaceful	c
and	c
tender	i
in	c
the	c
future	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs.	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
surprised	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
.	c

First	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
mention	c
that	c
I	c
can	c
only	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
will	c
work	c
in	c
August	c
in	c
a	c
web	c
designer	i
studio	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
am	c
unable	c
to	c
go	c
on	c
holiday	c
to	i
another	i
time	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
because	c
I	c
like	c
camping	c
very	c
much	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
's	c
more	c
exciting	c
to	c
be	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
than	c
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
.	c

I	c
played	c
Basketball	c
at	c
school	c
for	c
about	c
two	c
years	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
rather	c
good	c
in	i
it	c
.	c

I	c
also	c
had	c
Painting	c
as	c
main	i
subject	c
at	c
school	c
for	c
five	c
years	c
.	c

I	c
like	c
painting	c
very	c
much	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
I	c
am	c
good	c
in	i
Painting	c
.	c

I	c
paint	c
a	c
lot	c
in	c
my	c
free	c
time	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
,	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
will	c
we	c
need	c
?	c

Which	i
clothes	c
should	c
we	c
take	c
with	c
us	c
?	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

First	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
point	c
out	c
,	i
that	c
this	i
was	c
a	c
good	c
idea	c
to	c
present	i
our	c
school	c
in	c
a	c
short	c
film	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
first	c
of	c
all	c
we	c
should	c
film	c
an	c
english	i
lesson	c
,	c
where	c
pupils	c
could	c
prepare	c
some	c
group	c
work	c
or	c
information-boards	i
.	c

This	c
subject	c
teachs	i
the	c
pupils	c
how	c
to	c
make	c
good	c
presentations	c
.	c

They	c
go	i
together	c
in	c
groups	c
,	c
then	c
they	c
prepare	c
power	i
point	i
presentations	c
and	c
at	i
least	i
they	c
present	c
it	c
in	c
front	c
of	c
the	c
other	c
pupils	c
and	c
teachers	c
.	c

The	c
smokers	c
in	c
the	c
school	c
yard	c
,	c
the	c
buffett	i
and	c
the	c
other	c
pupils	c
,	c
who	c
are	c
sitting	c
in	i
front	i
of	i
their	c
tables	c
writing	i
their	c
homework	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
then	c
we	c
should	c
film	c
an	c
informatic-lesson	i
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
would	c
be	c
all	c
for	c
our	c
video	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
this	i
are	c
the	c
most	c
interesting	c
things	c
in	c
our	c
school	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
afraid	c
that	c
reality	c
had	c
nothing	c
common	c
with	c
the	c
things	c
I	c
suspected	i
to	c
meet	i
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
the	c
prices	c
were	c
n't	c
lower	i
in	i
any	i
cases	i
although	i
you	i
advertised	i
the	i
information	i
like	i
that	i
.	c

Then	c
,	c
I	c
expected	c
the	c
show	c
to	c
start	c
on	c
time	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
turned	c
out	c
that	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
wait	c
45	c
minutes	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
when	c
the	c
play	c
started	c
at	c
last	c
,	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
look	c
at	c
the	c
actors	c
.	c

According	c
to	c
your	c
advertisement	c
,	c
there	c
was	c
a	i
possibility	i
to	c
have	c
dinner	c
in	c
your	c
restaurant	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
was	c
surprised	c
when	c
I	c
found	c
it	c
closed	c
.	c

After	c
that	c
,	c
I	c
should	c
also	c
mention	c
,	i
that	c
this	c
evening	c
was	c
dull	c
,	c
boring	c
and	c
the	c
worst	c
in	c
my	c
life	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
and	c
I	c
insist	c
that	c
you	c
refund	c
my	c
lost	i
money	c
at	c
once	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

Come	i
back	i
to	c
paradise	c

The	i
clothes	i
is	i
part	c
of	c
each	c
culture	c
and	c
one	c
of	c
these	i
things	c
which	c
expresses	i
our	c
taste	c
and	c
personality	c
.	c

They	c
come	c
up	c
with	c
many	c
ideas	c
but	c
it	c
ca	c
n't	c
last	c
for	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
.	c

Nowadays	c
it	i
's	c
getting	c
obvious	c
that	c
designers	c
sold	i
only	c
details	i
,	c
but	i
significant	c
changes	c
do	c
n't	c
turn	c
up	c
.	c

People	c
look	c
for	c
something	c
new	c
but	c
it	c
is	c
not	c
so	c
easy	c
to	c
be	c
creative	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
.	c

That	c
's	c
why	c
I	c
believe	c
in	c
the	c
solution	c
which	c
is	c
the	c
closest	c
to	c
human	c
nature	c
and	c
can	c
help	c
us	c
to	c
omit	i
the	i
boredome	i
I	i
am	c
sure	c
that	c
at	i
last	i
we	c
will	c
take	c
off	c
our	c
clothes	c
and	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
we	c
will	c
be	c
undressed	c
and	c
free	i
there	i
wo	c
n't	c
be	c
any	c
problem	c
with	c
being	c
up-do-date	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
really	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
seeing	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
on	c
the	c
stage	c
.	c

As	c
if	c
this	c
were	c
not	c
enough	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
forty	i
five	i
minutes	c
late	c
.	c

According	c
to	c
your	c
leaflet	c
,	c
tickets	c
were	c
supposed	c
to	c
be	c
a	c
bit	c
cheaper	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
was	c
refused	c
being	i
given	i
a	c
discount	c
.	c

On	c
top	c
of	c
everything	c
,	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

You	c
can	c
imagine	c
how	c
disappointed	c
I	c
must	i
be	i
to	c
spent	i
such	c
an	c
imperfect	c
evening	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
receiving	c
your	c
prompt	c
reply	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

Recently	c
,	c
we	c
have	i
had	i
a	c
very	c
interesting	c
discussion	c
about	c
how	c
science	c
and	c
technology	c
affects	c
our	c
lives	c
.	c

My	c
father	c
is	c
a	c
sailor	c
and	c
I	c
meet	i
him	c
only	c
four	c
times	c
a	c
year	c
.	c

Nowadays	c
,	c
modern	c
technology	c
is	c
used	c
in	c
medicine	c
more	c
often	c
and	c
it	c
can	c
minimise	c
the	c
risk	c
of	c
the	c
death	c
of	c
the	c
patients	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
see	c
some	c
disadvantages	c
of	c
technological	c
progress	c
.	c

I	c
know	c
that	c
if	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
keep	c
fit	c
and	c
stay	c
healthy	c
,	c
I	c
must	c
take	c
up	c
some	c
sport	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
modern	c
technology	c
has	c
made	c
our	c
environment	c
more	c
polluted	c
.	c

Although	c
modern	c
progress	c
has	c
made	c
our	c
life	c
easier	c
,	c
it	c
may	c
be	i
also	i
harmful	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
giving	c
me	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
because	c
as	i
I	c
had	i
never	c
slept	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
,	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
new	c
experience	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
a	c
very	c
good	c
basketball	c
player	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
playing	c
basketball	c
since	c
I	c
was	c
six	c
years	c
old	c
.	c

By	i
the	i
other	i
side	i
,	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
climbed	c
a	c
mountain	c
but	c
I	c
always	c
wanted	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
wondered	c
which	i
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
should	c
take	c
to	c
the	c
camp	c
and	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
know	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
should	c
take	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
knowing	c
the	c
date	i
of	c
the	c
camp	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
last	c
letter	c
.	c

As	c
I	c
sold	c
all	c
the	c
tickets	c
that	c
the	c
organisers	c
gave	c
me	c
,	c
I	c
won	c
a	c
prize	c
of	c
ten	c
pounds	c
.	c

Because	c
during	c
the	c
concert	c
I	c
was	c
working	c

I	c
am	c
angry	c
because	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
watch	c
the	c

Looking	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c

My	c
name	c
is	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
on	c
behalf	c
of	c
my	c
class	c
concerning	c
our	c
trip	c
to	c
London	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
organizing	c
the	c
programme	c
.	c

I	c
read	c
it	c
and	c
found	c
it	c
very	c
good	c
,	c
specially	i
,	i
Science	i
Museum	c
and	c
National	c
Art	c
Gallery	c
as	c
I	c
am	c
interested	c
in	c
arts	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
a	c
great	c
proposition	c
for	c
you	c
.	c

I	c
thing	i
it	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
for	c
us	c
,	c
as	c
it	c
is	c
at	c
the	c
time	c
of	c
our	c
being	c
in	c
London	c
and	c
is	c
free	c
of	c
charge	c
for	c
students	c
.	c

Girls	i
should	i
like	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
latest	c
fashion	i
,	c
new	c
make-up	c
and	c
interesting	c
hairstyles	c
.	c

Boys	i
are	c
interested	c
in	c
seeing	c
leisure	c
and	c
sportswear	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
suggest	c
a	c
change	c
in	c
the	c
programme	c
by	c
giving	c
up	c
shopping	c
and	c
going	c
to	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
will	c
consider	c
this	c
proposition	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
form	i
you	c
.	c

THE	c
HOME	c
OF	c
THE	c
FUTURE	c

The	c
construction	c
will	c
be	c
more	c
simple	c
what	i
will	c
give	c
us	c
a	c
feeling	c
of	c
balance	c
.	c

More	c
houses	c
will	c
have	c
gardens	c
what	i
will	c
make	c
us	c
feel	c
closer	c
to	c
the	i
nature	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
not	c
think	c
so	c
.	c

Because	c
of	c
computers	c
we	i
will	c
have	c
the	c
possibility	c
of	c
working	c
at	c
home	c
,	c
therefore	c
,	c
home	c
will	c
be	c
very	i
important	c
place	c
worth	c
paying	c
attention	c
.	i

Take	c
care	c
of	c
your	c
home	c
,	c
do	c
not	c
hesitate	c
in	i
it	c
and	c
you	c
will	c
be	c
very	c
happy	c
.	c

At	i
the	i
begining	i
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
.	c

Now	c
I	c
am	c
going	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
some	c
further	c
informations	i
I	i
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
only	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
student	c
in	c
High	i
school	c
and	c
this	c
is	c
most	i
important	c
year	c
of	c
my	c
life	c
I	i
am	c
studying	c
to	i
university	i
entrance	c
exams	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
study	c
until	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
June	c
and	c
then	c
by	i
the	c
end	c
of	c
June	c
I	c
will	c
be	i
having	i
university	i
entrance	c
exam	c
after	i
that	c
in	i
July	c
I	i
am	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
alright	c
.	c

And	c
finally	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
some	c
questions	c
.	c

My	c
first	c
question	c
is	c
about	c
clothes	c
;	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
do	c
we	c
need	c
to	c
take	c
with	c
us	c
?	c
and	i
How	i
much	c
money	c
do	c
we	c
need	c
to	c
take	c
?	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
Every	i
thing	i

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
,	c

Firstly	c
,	c
we	c
were	c
informed	c
that	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
was	c
starring	c
but	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
was	c
starring	c
in	c
the	c
show	c
and	c
he	c
was	c
really	c
disappointing	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
it	c
was	i
written	i
that	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
to	c
start	c
at	c
19:30	c
.	c

Thirdly	c
,	c
it	c
was	i
written	i
that	c
discounts	c
were	c
available	c
but	c
we	c
were	c
again	c
frustrated	c
,	c
seing	i
they	c
were	c
not	c
available	c
.	c

We	c
did	c
not	c
have	c
"	c
a	c
perfect	c
evening	c
"	c
as	c
it	c
was	i
written	i
,	c
actually	c
we	c
had	c
an	c
evening	c
full	c
of	c
the	c
theatre	c
's	c
mistakes	c
and	c
were	c
extremely	c
disappointed	c
.	c

I	c
suppose	i
it	c
will	c
be	c
better	c
for	c
your	c
theatre	c
's	c
reputation	c
to	c
give	c
at	c
least	c
some	c
of	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

Yours	c
Sincerely	i
,	c

We	c
live	c
in	c
a	c
technologically	c
well-developed	c
world	c
,	c
having	c
every	c
opportunity	c
for	c
communication	c
,	c
education	c
and	c
entertainment	c
.	c

Almost	c
everyone	c
has	c
televisions	c
,	c
computers	c
and	c
electronic	c
devices	c
.	c

But	c
how	c
has	c
modern	c
technology	c
changed	c
our	c
lives	c
?	c

If	c
I	c
were	c
to	c
talk	c
about	c
my	c
own	c
life	c
,	c
my	c
speech	c
would	c
be	c
simple	c
:	c
"	c
My	c
electronic	c
alarm-clock	i
wakes	c
me	c
up	c
in	c
the	c
morning	c
.	c

I	c
go	c
to	c
school	c
by	c
underground	c
.	c

I	c
wonder	c
what	c
I	c
could	c
do	c
without	c
them	c
...	c

I	c
sometimes	c
get	c
bored	c
or	c
feel	c
isolated	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
know	c
I	c
am	c
living	c
in	c
a	c
virtual	c
world	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
look	c
at	c
my	c
life	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
understand	c
I	c
am	c
dependent	c
on	c
the	c
machines	c
.	c

My	c
daily	c
life	c
is	c
programmed	c
up	i
to	c
the	c
virtual	c
world	c
I	c
created	c
.	c

Modern	c
technology	c
has	c
changed	c
my	c
life	c
completely	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
give	c
my	c
opinion	c
about	c
the	c
International	c
Arts	c
Festival	c
which	c
was	c
held	c
21st	i
and	c
22nd	c
November	c
.	c

I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
rock	c
concert	c
by	c
U2	c
and	c
the	i
Chinese	c
film	c
"	c
Chung	c
King	c
Express	c
"	c
.	c

Both	c
of	c
them	c
were	c
not	c
only	c
really	c
enjoyable	c
,	c
but	c
also	c
reasonably-priced	i
.	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
feel	c
that	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
even	c
better	c
if	c
there	c
were	c
some	c
improvement	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
greater	i
if	c
there	c
were	c
more	c
famous	c
people	c
who	i
have	i
various	c
nationalities	c
.	c

Because	c
most	c
of	c
them	c
were	c
from	c
English	i
speaking	i
country	i
this	c
year	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
,	c
larger	c
halls	c
should	c
be	c
provided	c
for	c
concerts	c
since	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
people	c
could	c
not	c
get	c
tickets	c
for	c
those	c
by	c
big	c
stars	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
personally	c
,	c
I	c
hope	c
that	c
the	c
number	c
of	c
plays	c
and	c
films	c
will	c
increase	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
they	c
are	c
the	c
nearest	i
'	c
arts	c
'	c
in	c
real	c
life	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
be	c
glad	c
if	c
you	c
consider	i
my	c
suggestions	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

Money	c
-	c
has	c
n't	c
it	c
always	c
been	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
problem	i
for	c
students	c
?	c

However	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
some	c
good	c
ways	c
for	c
you	c
to	c
earn	c
enough	c
money	c
to	c
enjoy	c
yourself	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
say	c
that	c
the	c
wage	c
is	c
far	c
from	c
satisfaction	i
,	c
why	c
do	c
n't	c
you	c
teach	c
younger	c
students	c
as	c
a	c
private	c
teacher	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
also	c
really	i
popular	c
job	c
among	c
university	c
students	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
good	c
salaly	i
.	c

If	c
you	c
are	c
interested	c
in	c
teaching	c
and	c
responsible	c
enough	c
,	c
you	c
'll	c
probably	c
become	c
an	c
excellent	c
teacher	c
.	c

You	c
'll	c
find	c
that	c
your	c
life	c
is	c
becoming	c
more	c
and	c
more	c
enjoyable	c
!	c

I	c
look	c
forword	i
to	c
going	c
to	c
the	c
Camp	c
California	c
in	c
the	c
USA	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
only	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
my	c
family	c
is	c
going	c
to	c
visit	c
me	c
on	i
August	c
and	c
I	c
will	c
have	c
to	c
look	c
after	c
them	c
.	c

Because	c
it	c
remainds	i
me	c
my	i
childhood	c
.	c

We	c
had	i
always	c
enjoying	i
ourselves	c
.	c

Never	c
had	c
I	c
got	i
such	c
a	c
great	c
time	c
.	c

From	c
your	i
's	i
list	c
of	c
activities	c
I	c
choose	c
sailing	c
and	c
climbing	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
keen	c
on	c
sailing	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
my	c
favourite	c
sport	c
.	c

I	c
find	c
it	c
very	c
atractive	i
.	c

I	c
have	c
been	c
sailing	c
since	c
my	c
father	c
had	i
bought	c
a	c
boat	c
in	c
1980	c
,	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
only	c
five	c
years	c
old	c
.	c

Last	c
year	c
I	c
took	c
up	c
climbing	c
and	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
carry	c
on	c
learning	c
this	c
sport	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
what	c
kinds	c
of	c
clothes	c
should	i
I	i
take	c
with	c
me	c
.	i

Angelina	c

Most	c
people	c
think	c
that	c
if	c
they	c
have	c
got	c
money	c
they	c
will	c
buy	c
everything	c
what	i
they	c
want	c
.	c

Nowdays	i
we	c
have	c
many	c
big	c
shopping	c
centers	i
.	c

We	c
like	c
them	c
because	c
everything	c
is	c
on	i
one	c
place	c
.	c

The	c
most	c
suitable	c
time	c
for	c
shopping	c
is	c
weekand	i
when	c
parents	c
do	c
n't	c
work	c
and	c
children	c
have	c
n't	c
got	c
a	i
school	c
.	c

Because	c
of	c
that	c
shopping	i
centers	i
are	c
over	i
crowded	i
.	c

In	c
addition	c
in	i
such	i
kind	c
of	c
shops	c
prizes	i
are	c
very	c
high	c
,	c
of	c
course	c
not	c
all	c
of	c
them	c
.	c

However	c
such	c
centers	i
are	c
very	c
useful	c
and	c
necessary	c
.	c

I	i
my	c
opinion	c
the	c
worst	c
thing	c
which	c
may	c
happened	i
is	c
extremly	i
hugh	i
queu	i
to	i
the	c
changing	c
room	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
really	c
exhausting	c
.	c

Afterwards	c
you	c
are	c
all	c
in	c
.	c

Nevertheless	c
sometimes	c
shopping	c
could	i
be	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
bought	c
something	c
goregous	i
,	c
you	c
would	i
be	c
very	c
happy	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr.	c
Robertson	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
in	i
the	i
name	i
of	i
the	c
class	c
for	c
your	c
good	i
organisation	i
and	c
programme	c
,	c
Especially	i
for	c
the	c
fact	c
that	c
you	c
are	c
giving	c
us	c
some	c
free	c
time	c
.	c

The	c
show	c
is	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
the	c
14th	c
of	c
March	c
,	c
from	c
10	i
oo	i
to	i
19	i
oo	i
o'clock	i
in	c
the	c
Central	c
Exhibition	c
Hall	c
.	c

There	i
will	i
be	i
shown	i
the	i
latest	i
fashions	i
about	i
leisure	i
and	i
sports	i
wear	i
,	i
make	i
up	i
and	i
hairstyles	i
.	c

As	c
you	c
can	c
see	c
this	c
is	c
the	c
best	c
time	c
to	c
go	c
there	c
.	c

We	c
have	c
some	c
suggestions	c
about	c
how	c
to	c
change	c
the	c
programme	c
.	c

Instead	c
of	c
visiting	c
the	c
Science	c
Museum	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
we	c
could	c
go	c
there	c
on	c
Wednesday	c
afternoon	c
and	c
instead	c
of	c
going	c
shopping	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
afternoon	c
we	c
could	c
maybe	c
stop	c
at	c
some	c
places	c
during	c
the	c
sightseeing	c
tour	c
and	c
buy	c
there	i
something	i
.	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
this	c
is	c
a	c
really	c
great	c
opportunity	c
for	c
us	c
and	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
think	c
that	c
the	c
changes	c
are	c
so	c
big	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerelly	i

As	c
well	c
as	c
this	c
he	c
needs	c
his	c
own	c
free	c
space	c
and	c
privacy	c
.	c

This	c
is	c
also	c
important	i
to	c
him	c
as	c
friendship	c
and	c
family	c

In	c
our	c
society	c
some	c
people	c
are	c
treated	c
like	c
animals	c
in	c
the	c
zoo	c
by	c
the	c
press	c
.	c

The	c
newspapers	c
print	c
everything	c
about	c
them	c
.	c

The	c
yellow	i
press	i
is	c
searching	c
for	c
every	c
little	c
information	i
they	c
can	c
get	c
.	c

The	c
photographers	c
are	c
chasing	c
these	c
people	c
,	i
just	c
to	c
take	c
a	c
picture	c
of	c
them	c
on	i
how	c
they	c
eat	c
or	c
with	c
who	i
the	i
meat	i
.	c

The	c
photos	c
will	c
be	c
on	i
tomorrow	c
's	c
press	c
and	c
so	c
rumours	c
are	c
born	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
the	i
people	c
have	c
choose	i
to	c
walk	c
on	i
this	c
path	c
.	c

Everything	c
in	c
life	c
has	c
a	c
price	c
.	c

The	c
price	c
for	c
fame	c
and	c
money	c
is	c
the	c
lost	i
of	c
privacy	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
give	c
up	c
something	c
for	i
getting	i
something	c
else	c
.	c

As	c
well	c
as	c
this	c
,	c
the	c
stars	c
should	c
n't	c
complaint	i
at	c
any	c
time	c
about	c
their	c
fans	c
and	c
their	c
lost	i
of	c
privacy	c
.	c

They	c
wanted	c
to	c
be	c
famous	c
and	c
the	i
had	i
known	i
the	c
price	c
before	i
.	c

Instead	c
of	c
half	c
past	c
seven	c
the	c
show	c
startet	i
at	c
quarter	c
past	c
eight	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
n't	c
go	c
to	c
have	i
a	i
refreshment	c
because	i
of	i
two	c
reasons	c
,	c
the	c
first	c
one	c
is	c
that	c
there	c
was	c
no	c
information	c
how	i
much	i
time	i
the	c
start	c
of	c
the	c
show	c
is	i
going	c
to	c
be	c
late	c
.	i

The	c
second	c
reason	c
is	c
that	c
the	c
restaurant	i
of	i
the	i
theatre	i
was	c
closed	c
because	i
of	i
building	i
plans	i
for	i
the	i
next	i
two	i
month	i
.	c

After	c
I	c
waited	c
for	c
about	c
45	c
minutes	c
the	c
show	c
suddenly	c
started	c
but	c
I	c
had	i
to	i
realize	i
that	c
the	c
main	c
actor	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
who	c
was	c
the	c
reason	c
why	c
I	c
went	c
into	i
the	c
show	c
had	i
been	c
traded	i
by	c
an	i
other	i
actor	c
,	c
who	c
could	c
n't	c
sing	c
as	i
half	c
as	c
good	i
then	i
Brook	c
.	c

For	c
these	c
reasons	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
to	i
get	i
my	c
money	c
of	i
Â£	c
25	c
back	i

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

"	c
Sarah	c
has	c
won	c
in	c
a	c
quiz	c
show	c
?	c
"	c

James	c
was	c
more	c
than	c
just	c
interested	c
,	c
he	c
wanted	c
to	c
know	c
what	c
she	c
had	c
won	c
.	c

But	c
Pat	c
made	c
a	c
promise	c
not	c
to	c
tell	c
anybody	c
about	c
the	c
quiz	c
show	c
and	c
he	c
already	i
had	i
told	c
enough	c
.	c

After	c
one	c
hour	c
the	c
hohle	i
class	c
had	c
heard	c
about	c
Sarah	c
's	c
secret	c
.	c

Everybody	c
was	c
interested	c
in	c
what	c
she	c
had	c
won	c
but	c
knowbody	i
wanted	c
to	c
ask	c
Sarah	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
told	c
in	i
a	c
secret	c
to	c
them	c
.	c

Sarah	c
realized	c
that	c
everybody	c
was	c
nice	c
and	c
friendly	c
to	c
her	c
but	c
something	c
was	c
going	c
on	c
in	c
the	c
class	c
,	c
when	c
she	c
turned	c
around	c
a	i
talking	c
and	c
wispering	i
started	c

Suddenly	c
,	c
she	c
went	c
to	c
Pat	c
and	c
asked	c
him	i

tell	c
anybody	c
about	c
our	c
secret	c

Pat	c

Dear	c
Mrs.	c
Ryan	c
,	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
I	c
will	c
try	c
to	c
answer	c
your	c
questions	c
.	c

The	c
reason	c
for	c
this	c
is	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
work	c
in	c
August	c
and	c
from	c
September	c
to	c
June	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
school	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
long	i
cabins	i
and	c
I	c
hope	c
that	c
then	c
I	c
will	c
have	c
enough	c
place	i
for	c
all	c
the	c
things	c
I	c
will	c
carry	i
with	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
take	c
part	c
in	c
a	c
painting	c
course	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
get	c
to	c
know	c
how	c
to	c
handle	c
a	c
camera	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
I	c
do	c
not	c
have	c
an	i
own	c
camera	c
.	c

In	c
spite	c
of	c
this	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
got	c
all	c
equipement	i
I	c
need	c
for	c
the	i
activity	i
painting	c
and	c
I	c
am	i
painting	i
very	c
well	c
.	c

Could	c
you	c
please	c
tell	c
me	c
if	c
I	c
will	c
need	c
some	c
extra	c
money	c
for	c
the	c
two	c
activities	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
know	c
if	c
I	c
should	c
take	c
any	c
warm	c
clothes	c
with	c
me	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
about	c
my	c
work	c
at	c
the	c
pop	c
concert	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
carry	c
all	c
the	c
bottles	c
into	c
the	c
bar	c
and	c
later	c
I	c
helped	c
some	c
other	c
people	c
to	c
get	c
the	c
instruments	c
in	c
the	c
right	c
position	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
really	c
hard	c
work	c
.	c

At	c
one	c
o'clock	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
break	c
.	c

At	c
this	c
time	i
I	c
promised	c
that	i
I	c
would	c
never	c
do	c
this	c
awful	c
job	c
again	c
.	c

The	c
food	c
was	c
deligious	i
and	c
fortunately	c
I	c
do	i
not	i
had	i
to	c
pay	c
for	c
it	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
afternoon	c
I	c
was	c
sitting	c
around	c
,	c
waiting	c
for	c
the	c
pop	c
groups	c
.	c

Then	c
at	c
five	c
o'clock	c
my	c
favourite	c
band	c
"	c
Tristania	c
"	c
arrived	c
.	c

I	c
talked	c
to	c
them	c
and	c
to	c
many	c
other	c
groups	c
that	c
arrived	c
later	c
.	c

25th	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Clark	c
,	c

I	c
have	i
seen	i
your	c
advertisement	c
in	c
"	c
the	c
Sun	c
"	c
newspaper	c
on	c
10th	c
November	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
festival	c
on	i
last	c
Friday	c
.	c

I	c
enjoyed	c
it	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
could	c
be	c
even	c
better	c
next	c
year	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
give	c
my	c
inmature	i
views	i
of	c
it	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
the	c
idea	c
of	c
holding	c
this	c
International	c
Arts	c
Festival	c
is	c
great	c
.	c

I	i
made	i
people	c
enjoyed	i
their	c
weekend	c
,	c
relaxed	i
themselves	i
,	c
also	i
it	c
brought	c
the	i
foreign	c
culture	c
to	c
them	c
,	c
enlarged	i
their	c
kownlegth	i
.	c

In	c
addition	c
to	c
it	i
,	c
one	c
weekend	c
ticket	c
for	c
all	c
events	i
was	c
only	c
Â£	c
10	c
,	i
this	i
was	c
excellent	c
,	i
it	i
made	i
people	c
only	c
spend	i
pocket-money	i
,	c
and	c
then	c
they	c
could	c
watch	c
all	c
the	c
events	c
at	c
the	c
weeked	i
,	i
for	i
them	c
it	c
is	c
really	i
economical	c
to	i
spent	i
their	c
weekend	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
the	c
plays	c
and	c
films	c
were	c
wonderfully	c
welcomed	i
,	c
as	c
far	c
as	c
I	c
'm	c
concerned	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
can	c
show	i
more	c
play	i
and	c
films	c
It	i
will	c
achieve	i
a	c
good	c
effect	c
.	c

This	i
are	c
only	c
my	c
inmature	i
views	c
,	i
if	i
it	i
is	i
considerable	i
for	i
you	i
,	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
very	c
pleased	c
,	i
thank	i
you	c
very	c
much	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
look	i
forward	c
to	c
hearing	i
your	c
replies	i
.	c

yours	c
sincerely	c

school	c
,	c
we	c
are	c
n't	c
allowed	c

,	i

to	c
catch	c
fire	c

,	i
only	i

the	c
school	c
.	c

At	c
my	c
home	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
many	c
rules	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
'm	c

so	c
I	c
am	i
n't	i
allowed	c
to	c
smoke	c
at	c

as	i
well	i
:	c
and	c
I	c
'm	c
not	c
allowed	c

for	c
one	c
month	c
,	i
my	i

How	i

How	i

too	c
wet	c
,	i
please	i
give	c
my	c
regards	c
to	c
your	c
parents	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
make	c
a	c
complain	i
about	c
your	c
theatre	c
and	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
,,Over	i
the	c
rainbow	i
"	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
in	c
your	c
advertisement	c
was	i
said	i
that	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
has	c
a	c
part	c
in	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
but	c
there	c
was	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
in	c
the	c
play	c
.	c

This	c
fact	c
disappointed	c
me	c
a	c
lot	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
very	c
uncamfortable	i
for	c
me	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
to	c
this	c
,	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
too	c
late	c
(	c
the	c
show	c
did	c
not	c
start	c
on	c
time	c
)	c
.	c

Everybody	c
,	i
who	c
came	c
to	c
it	i
's	i
doors	c
,	i
had	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
other	c
restaurant	c
in	c
bad	i
mood	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
have	c
understood	i
this	c
if	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
had	c
been	c
marvellous	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
even	c
quite	c
interesting	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

Her	c
boss	c
was	c
rich	i
man	c
,	c
really	c
rich	c
.	c

He	c
was	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
most	c
famous	c
person	i
in	c
his	i
city	c
,	c
but	c
he	c
was	c
n't	c
honest	c
with	c
his	c
clients	c
.	c

Certainly	c
she	c
knew	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
secrets	c
.	c

One	c
of	c
them	c
was	c
about	c
her	c
boss	i
'	i
private	c
life	c
:	c
he	c
had	c
got	i
illegal	i
son	c
.	c

Timson	c
's	c
wife	c
,	c
who	c
was	c
good	i
looking	i
and	c
young	c
,	c
could	c
n't	c
know	c
about	c
this	c
,	c
but	c
one	c
beautiful	c
day	c
she	c
asked	c
him	c
how	c
his	c
son	c
was	c
and	c
where	c
he	c
was	c
at	c
that	c
moment	c
.	c

Timson	c
was	c
really	c
shocked	c
!	c

He	c
even	i
could	i
n't	i
say	c
a	c
word	c
.	c

This	c
was	c
his	c
secretary	c
Pat	c
,	c
however	c
,	c
he	c
could	c
n't	c
be	c
sure	c
and	c
decided	c
to	c
check	c
it	i
up	c
.	c

Next	i
day	c
he	i
understood	c
that	c
he	c
was	c
right	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
the	c
worst	c
weekends	i
in	i
a	i
last	c
few	c
years	c
.	c

Only	c
Pat	c
has	c
problems	c
,	c
she	c
should	i
earn	i
her	i
living	i
in	i
other	i
company	i
again	i
!	c

Today	c
a	i
recived	i

which	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
find	c
in	c
the	c
shops	c
of	i
my	c
town	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
can	c
do	c
anything	c
just	c
clicking	i
on	c
the	c
mouse	c
!	c

Sometimes	c
,	c
computer	i
substitudes	i
real	c
relationships	c
between	c
people	c
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
modern	c
technology	c
get	i
my	c
life	c
more	c
interesting	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	i
with	c
my	c
friends	c
and	c
with	c
my	c
girlfriend	c
then	i
in	c
front	c
of	c
a	c
computer	c
!	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
Musical	c
Show	c
,	i
I	c
have	i
seen	i
last	c
week	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
there	c
was	c
no	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
at	i
the	c
stage	c
.	c

She	i
is	c
my	c
famous	i
artist	c
and	c
I	c
was	i
coming	i
there	c
mainly	c
because	c
of	c
him	c
.	c

If	i
this	i
made	c
me	c
really	c
disappointed	c
-	c
he	c
was	c
n't	c
playing	i
there	c
.	c

The	c
place	c
you	c
have	i
offered	c
was	c
closed	c
and	c
there	c
was	c
nothing	c
to	c
eat	c
inside	c
the	c
theatre	c
at	c
all	c
.	c

Despite	c
changing	c
the	c
hours	c
,	c
you	c
have	i
closed	c
the	c
restaurant	c
without	c
any	c
reason	c
.	c

Could	c
you	c
possibly	c
explain	c
why	c
you	c
did	c
n't	c
provide	c
us	c
anything	i
to	c
eat	c
?	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
say	c
that	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
,	i
this	c
could	c
be	c
the	c
only	c
,	i
right	c
possibility	i
for	c
me	c
,	i
to	c
forget	c
about	c
my	c
not	i
interesting	i
evening	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

FASHION	c
OF	c
THE	c
FUTURE	c

Try	c
to	c
imagine	c
:	i
the	c
wide	c
,	c
colourful	c
street	c
with	c
many	c
fantastic	c
cars	c
and	c
shinny	i
large	i
shops	c
.	c

Try	c
to	c
think	c
about	c
people	c
in	c
weird	c
black	c
and	c
grey	c
clothes	c
on	i
them	i
.	c

It	c
is	c
n't	c
a	c
film	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
n't	c
even	c
a	c
picture	c
from	c
mysterious	c
books	c
.	c

People	c
were	i
wearing	c
almost	c
everything	c
,	c
during	c
more	c
than	c
2000	c
years	c
of	c
their	c
living	c
on	c
Earth	c
.	c

Everything	c
was	i
changing	i
:	c
style	c
,	c
colour	c
qual	i
.	c

Their	c
clothes	c
were	c
always	c
strictly	c
connected	c
with	c
their	c
lifestyle	c
,	c
climate	c
and	c
money	c
.	c

What	c
something	i
new	i
has	c
n't	c
been	c
invented	c
for	i
now	c
?	c

I	c
say	i
it	i
to	i
you	c
-	c
black	c
and	c
grey	c
.	c

The	c
climate	c
is	c
changing	c
,	c
so	c
we	c
would	i
have	c
only	c
two	c
seasons	c
.	c

And	c
we	c
will	c
need	c
only	c
two	c
colours	c
:	c
grey	c
for	c
hot	c
days	c
and	c
black	c
for	c
cold	c
ones	c
.	c

Women	c
will	c
wear	c
only	c
skirts	c
and	c
dresses	c
but	c
men	c
will	c
be	c
strictly	c
connected	c
with	c
trousers	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
,	i
there	c
will	c
be	c
times	c
,	i
when	c
women	c
would	i
like	c
to	i
be	i
again	i
thought	c
as	i
delicate	c
and	c
sensible	i
human	c
beings	c
.	c

Showing	c
their	c
figure	c
,	c
they	c
would	c
have	c
possibility	i
to	c
show	c
their	c
sexuality	c
.	c

But	c
,	c
do	c
n't	c
forget	c
,	c
any	i
exhibitionism	c
!	c

Streets	i
of	c
21st	i
century	c
will	c
be	c
smart	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
are	c
you	c
interested	c
in	c
that	c
style	c
?	c

Dear	c
Manager	c
,	c

Recently	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
week	c
's	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
and	c
during	c
my	c
stay	c
,	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
your	c
theatre	c
to	c
see	c
"	c
Over	c
The	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
really	c
disillusioned	i
.	c

In	c
the	c
advertisement	c
,	c
it	c
was	i
told	i
that	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
was	c
starring	c
,	c
but	c
in	c
place	c
of	c
him	c
there	c
was	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
and	c
he	c
was	c
really	c
dissapointing	i
.	c

I	c
could	c
not	c
see	c
any	c
portion	c
of	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
's	c
performance	c
at	i
him	c
.	c

Also	c
,	c
in	c
the	c
schedule	i
,	c
the	c
time	c
of	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
written	c
as	c
19:30	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
20;15	i
and	c
,	i
I	c
missed	c
the	c
dinner	c
I	c
was	c
going	c
to	c
have	c
with	c
my	c
best	c
friend	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

Since	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
student	c
and	c
not	c
as	c
rich	c
as	c
Bill	c
gates	i
,	c
I	c
was	c
short	c
of	c
money	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
pleased	c
to	c
hear	c
that	c
there	c
were	c
discounts	c
available	c
for	c
the	c
tickets	c
;	c
but	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
give	c
the	c
exact	i
price	c
of	c
the	c
ticket	c
,	c
which	c
I	c
consider	c
as	i
a	i
fault	c
of	c
your	c
theatre	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
to	c
these	i
,	c
it	c
was	c
mentioned	c
that	c
your	c
restaurant	c
was	c
open	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
because	c
there	c
was	c
no	c
food	c
to	c
be	c
served	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
can	c
understand	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
dreadful	c
time	c
and	c
I	c
went	i
my	c
money	c
back	c
as	c
a	c
solace	i
for	c
the	c
dissapointment	i
I	c
had	c
.	c

TECHNOLOGY	c
AND	c
MY	c
DAILY	c
LIFE	c

Until	c
1996	c
,	c
I	c
used	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
school	c
on	c
foot	c
or	c
by	c
public	c
bus	c
;	c
but	c
since	c
1996	c
;	c
I	c
take	c
the	c
underground	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
school	c
.	c

Also	c
,	c
I	c
use	c
my	c
computer	c
and	c
Internet	i
very	c
much	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
reach	i
some	i
information	c
,	c
do	c
my	c
projects	c
and	c
communicate	c
with	c
my	c
friends	c
.	c

To	c
talk	c
to	c
a	c
friend	c
from	c
another	c
city	c
or	c
country	c
instantly	c
online	c
is	c
really	c
nice	c
and	c
exciting	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
not	c
have	c
to	c
wait	c
for	c
a	c
letter	c
for	c
days	c
and	c
I	c
gain	c
so	c
much	c
time	c
again	i
.	c

on	i
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
because	c
of	c
dealing	i
with	i
computers	c
so	c
much	c
,	c
I	c
can	i
not	i
see	c
my	c
family	c
and	c
friends	c
very	c
much	c
,	c
even	c
when	c
we	c
are	c
at	i
the	c
same	c
medium	i
.	c

It	c
is	c
really	c
bad	c
to	c
make	c
your	c
human	c
relations	c
get	c
weaker	c
.	c

Recently	c
I	c
visited	c
an	c
arts	c
festival	c
,	i
organized	c
with	c
your	c
help	c
.	c

This	c
change	c
will	c
give	c
opportunity	i
to	c
create	i
some	i
different	i
performance	i
.	c

From	c
my	c
point	c
of	c
view	c
,	c
there	c
should	c
be	c
more	c
films	c
because	c
this	c
part	c
of	c
the	c
festival	c
is	c
interesting	c
for	c
people	c
.	c

And	c
,	c
at	i
last	i
,	c
I	c
should	c
congratulate	c
you	c
with	i
the	c
decision	c
of	i
making	i
one	c
weekend	c
ticket	c
for	c
all	c
events	c
.	c

I	c
support	c
this	c
idea	c
which	c
is	c
convinient	i
both	c
for	c
people	i
and	c
organisators	i
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
will	c
consider	c
my	c
proposals	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	i
,	c

Thanks	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
and	c
postcard	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
really	c
nice	c
.	i

The	c
things	c
you	c
wrote	c
about	c
in	c
your	c
letter	c
are	c
quite	c
common	i
for	c
me	c
,	c
because	c
we	c
,	c
actually	i
,	c
have	c
some	c
problems	c
about	i
our	c
rules	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
really	c
fed	c
up	c
with	c
our	c
school	c
forne	i
!	c

It	c
is	c
awfull	i
!	c

That	c
's	c
why	c
our	c
headmaster	c
is	c
really	c
angry	c
.	c

What	c
should	c
I	c
say	c
you	i
about	c
home	c
...	c

We	c
are	c
quite	c
friendly	i
family	c
,	c
that	c
's	c
why	c
we	c
actually	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
some	i
special	c
rules	c
.	c

I	c
miss	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
.	c

Write	c
me	i
what	i
do	i
you	c
think	c
about	c
it	c
.	c

Kisses	c
to	c
your	c
family	c
,	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
,	c

At	i
first	i
,	c
as	c
I	c
have	c
read	c
in	c
your	c
advertisement	c
,	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
should	c
have	c
stared	i
in	c
this	c
show	c
.	c

A	c
different	c
actor	c
has	i
appeared	i
,	c
but	i
I	c
must	c
say	c
that	c
he	c
was	c
very	c
disappointing	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
you	c
have	c
written	c
that	c
the	c
musical	c
starts	c
at	c
19:30	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
to	c
wait	c
for	c
the	c
show	c
for	c
over	c
fourty	i
five	i
minutes	c
,	c
because	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
about	c
20:15	c
!	c

You	c
have	i
also	i
placed	i
a	c
note	c
about	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
opened	i
after	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

I	c
wanted	c
to	c
drink	i
a	c
coffee	c
but	c
,	i
unfortunately	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
,	c
because	c
the	c
waiter	c
went	i
out	c
!	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
I	c
must	c
say	c
that	c
this	c
evening	c
out	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
be	c
perfect	c
.	c

Your	i
faithfully	c
,	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
modern	c
technology	c
has	c
changed	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
very	c
much	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
:	c
a	c
fridge	c
,	c
a	c
cooker	c
or	c
just	c
an	i
electricity	c
.	c

We	c
could	c
n't	c
imagine	c
our	c
life	c
without	c
them	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
thanked	i
to	c
the	i
technology	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
many	c
ways	c
of	c
travelling	c
today	c
.	c

We	c
produce	c
cars	c
,	c
trains	c
and	c
plains	i
which	c
are	c
better	c
and	c
better	c
.	c

It	c
can	c
really	c
help	c
a	c
lot	c
to	c
cure	c
people	c
.	c

Maybe	c
it	i
will	c
be	c
a	c
remedium	i
against	i
AIDs	c
or	c
cancer	c
soon	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
the	i
modern	c
technology	c
has	c
some	c
disadvantages	c
.	c

The	c
main	c
is	i
the	c
ozone	c
hole	c
that	c
affects	c
all	c
the	c
people	c
in	c
the	c
world	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
one	c
hand	c
it	i
helps	c
me	c
a	c
lot	c
in	c
daily	c
life	c
,	c
but	c
on	c
the	c
other	c
I	i
'm	c
afraid	c
of	c
the	c
future	c
everyday	i
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Ryan	c
,	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
going	c
to	c
answer	c
your	c
questions	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
we	c
are	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
tired	c
so	c
I	c
prefer	c
to	c
sleep	c
comfortably	c
.	c

You	c
also	c
asked	c
me	c
about	c
two	c
activities	c
.	c

I	c
also	c
choose	c
climbing	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
would	c
take	c
the	c
opportunity	c
to	c
improve	c
myself	i
.	c

In	c
addition	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
some	c
questions	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
in	c
the	c
near	c
future	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
if	c
you	c
try	c
to	c
do	c
your	c
shopping	c
during	c
the	c
rush	c
hour	c
,	c
it	c
could	c
be	c
very	c
difficult	c
.	c

Everybody	c
is	c
stressed	c
,	i
you	i
have	c
to	c
make	i
the	c
queue	c
.	c

But	i
sometimes	i
some	c
goods	c
are	c
expensive	c
but	c
of	c
a	c
very	c
bad	c
quality	c
.	c

And	c
it	c
is	c
not	c
an	c
easy	c
task	c
if	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
quality	c
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
say	c
that	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
the	c
most	c
enjoyable	c
task	c
you	c
could	c
find	c
.	c

Of	c
course	c
you	c
also	c
have	c
some	c
good	c
aspects	c
but	c
most	c
of	c
the	c
time	c
it	c
is	c
very	c
unpleasant	c
.	c

You	c
could	c
try	c
to	c
do	c
your	c
shopping	c
via	c
Internet	i
.	c

Last	c
week	c
,	c
during	c
my	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
the	c
opportunity	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
show	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
at	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theathre	i
.	c

That	c
is	c
why	c
I	c
am	c
writing	c
this	c
letter	c
;	c
to	c
inform	c
you	c
about	c
the	c
problems	c
I	c
had	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
the	c
tickets	c
were	c
too	c
expensive	c
.	c

The	c
day	c
of	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
we	c
got	c
to	c
the	c
theather	i
at	c
19:30	c
.	c

Instead	i
,	c
due	c
to	c
some	c
technical	c
problems	c
,	c
it	c
began	c
at	c
20:15	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
really	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
eating	c
at	c
that	c
place	c
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
appreciate	c
if	i
you	c
could	c
,	c
please	c
,	c
send	c
me	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
because	c
I	c
did	c
not	c
have	c
the	c
perfect	c
evening	c
that	c
I	c
expected	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
not	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

Sally	c
,	c
her	c
best	c
friend	c
,	c
had	c
told	c
her	c
what	c
had	c
been	c
happening	c
at	c
her	c
house	c
for	c
the	c
last	c
two	c
months	c
.	c

Sally	c
did	c
not	c
want	c
to	c
tell	c
anybody	c
about	c
her	c
problem	c
,	c
but	c
she	c
knew	c
she	c
could	c
trust	c
Pat	c
.	c

So	c
Sally	c
started	c
to	c
talk	c
.	c

She	c
had	c
seen	c
her	c
stepfather	c
hitting	c
her	c
mother	c
everytime	i
he	c
was	c
drunk	c
.	c

She	c
did	c
n't	c
want	c
to	c
tell	c
the	c
teachers	c
at	c
school	c
or	c
any	c
other	c
person	c
because	c
she	c
was	c
afraid	c
that	c
if	c
her	c
stepfather	c
find	i
out	c
about	c
that	i
,	c
he	c
would	c
get	c
made	i
and	c
hit	c
her	c
,	c
or	c
even	c
worse	c
,	c
kill	c
her	c
mother	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
she	c
needed	c
to	c
tell	c
somebody	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
the	c
police	c
.	c

Sally	c
was	c
so	c
scared	c
,	c
and	c
at	c
the	c
same	c
time	c
mad	c
at	c
Pat	c
because	c
she	c
knew	c
the	c
only	c
person	c
who	c
could	c
have	c
told	c
the	c
police	c
was	c
her	c
best	c
friend	c
.	c

Dear	c
Ms	c
Ryan	c

I	c
am	c
very	i
astonished	c
that	c
I	c
won	c
this	c
competition	c
!	c

It	c
is	c
great	c
and	c
I	c
will	i
say	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
the	c
two	c
weeks	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
already	i
.	c

I	c
have	c
never	c
been	c
in	i
California	c
yet	i
.	c

I	c
decided	c
to	i
have	i
the	i
accommodation	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
in	i
a	c
tent	c
,	c
because	c
there	c
you	c
will	c
have	c
lots	c
of	c
fun	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
pleased	c
to	c
choose	c
two	c
activities	c
,	c
because	c
now	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
learn	c
SINGING	c
and	c
SURFING	c
!	c

Another	i
question	i
I	i
have	i
;	c
the	c
live	i
there	c
,	c
is	c
it	c
as	c
expensive	c
as	c
I	c
think	c
?	c

And	c
the	c
weather	c
are	i
they	i
only	c
sunshiny	c
days	c
?	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

L.	c
Schwartz	c

Certainly	c
it	c
is	c
great	c
to	c
buy	c
new	c
clothes	c
and	c
have	c
a	c
great	c
variety	c
at	c
home	c
,	i
to	c
wear	c
,	c
but	c
mostly	c
you	c
will	c
have	i
allways	i
not	i
enough	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
not	c
a	c
typical	c
women	i
because	c
I	c
hate	c
shopping	c
!	c

I	c
am	c
lucky	c
if	c
I	c
will	i
find	i
something	c
which	c
fits	c
.	c

I	c
mean	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
too	c
crowdy	i
,	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
wait	c
such	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
before	c
you	c
can	c
pay	c
,	c
and	c
mostly	i
all	i
the	c
things	c
are	c
too	c
expensive	c
!	c

Lastly	c
,	c
you	c
can	c
see	c
,	c
my	c
opinion	c
about	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
very	c
good	c
,	c
then	i
I	c
think	c
shopping	c
is	c
never	c
enjoyable	c
!	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
:	c

To	i
spend	i
the	i
two	i
weeks	i
I	i
would	i
prefer	i
to	i
live	i
in	c
tents	i
,	c
that	c
's	c
in	i
my	c
opinion	c
a	i
way	c
to	c
be	c
nearer	c
the	c
enviroment	i
and	c
the	c
animals	c
,	c
although	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
mind	c
living	i
in	c
log	c
cabins	c
.	c

In	c
spite	c
of	c
liking	c
all	c
the	c
sports	c
you	c
wrote	c
in	i
your	c
letter	c
I	i
am	c
only	c
good	c
at	c
climbing	c
and	c
sailing	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
am	i
used	i
to	i
practise	i
them	c
with	c
my	c
father	c
since	i
I	c
was	c
a	c
child	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
got	c
a	c
doubt	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
not	c
very	c
important	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
if	c
I	c
need	c
any	c
money	c
or	c
all	i
is	c
payed	i
,	i
the	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
should	c
wear	c
,	c
if	c
the	c
weather	c
is	c
good	c
or	c
bad	c
...	c
and	c
all	c
the	c
extra	c
information	c
you	c
can	c
send	c
me	c
.	c

Eliza	c
Vasquez	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
the	c
majority	c
of	c
the	i
people	c
that	i
go	c
shopping	c
are	c
women	c
who	c
must	c
buy	c
food	c
and	c
other	c
kind	i
of	c
things	c
for	c
her	i
family	i
,	c
so	c
for	i
them	c
,	c
shopping	c
is	c
a	c
very	c
boring	c
activity	c
that	c
is	c
repeated	c
everyday	i
and	c
that	c
drive	i
them	c
crazy	c
when	c
they	c
have	c
to	c
choose	c
the	c
best	c
product	c
and	c
the	c
cheapest	c
price	c
to	c
save	c
some	c
money	c
.	c

Othrewise	i
,	c
there	c
are	c
people	c
who	c
think	c
the	c
opposite	c
;	i
such	c
as	c
:	c
children	c
,	c
teenagers	c
,	c
men	c
;	c
but	c
not	c
always	c
,	c
because	c
they	c
go	i
to	i
buy	i
hardly	i
ever	i
,	i
only	c
when	c
they	c
need	c
clothes	c
or	i
something	c
for	c
their	c
job	c
or	c
school	c
.	c

In	c
that	c
way	c
shopping	c
can	c
be	c
as	c
funny	i
as	c
you	c
want	c
,	c
although	c
if	c
you	c
do	c
it	c
very	c
often	c
,	c
it	c
will	c
be	i
as	i
an	i
obligation	i
in	i
the	i
future	i
.	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
all	i
you	c
make	i
in	c
small	c
cuantities	i
is	c
good	c
and	c
funny	i
,	c
but	c
do	c
n't	c
encrease	i
them	i
if	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
want	c
to	c
feel	c
uncomfortable	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

About	c
two	c
weeks	c
ago	c
,	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
London	c
for	c
a	c
week	i
holiday	c
.	c

After	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
over	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
possible	c
to	c
visit	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
,	c
as	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
that	c
day	c
.	c

You	c
will	c
find	c
the	c
receipt	c
enclosed	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
also	c
possible	c
to	c
read	c
the	c
news	c
or	c
play	c
games	c
.	c

I	c
also	c
have	c
the	c
possibility	i
of	c
making	c
new	c
friends	c
:	c
I	c
can	c
connect	c
to	c
a	c
special	c
site	c
which	c
will	c
enable	c
me	c
to	c
virtually	c
meet	c
people	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir/MADAME	i
,	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
says	i
that	c
the	c
starring	i
were	c
different	i
actors	i
,	i
and	i
there	i
were	i
n't	i
different	i
one	i
,	i
so	i
that	i
can	i
not	i
be	i
.	c

Also	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
says	i
,	i
that	c
the	c
show	c
will	i
begin	c
at	c
19.30	c
and	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
20.15	c
;	c
that	c
mean	i
that	c
I	c
have	i
to	c
cancelled	i
a	c
date	c
that	c
I	c
had	c
at	c
21:00	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
coud	i
n't	i
make	c
it	c
.	c

Another	c
thing	c
that	c
happened	i
was	c
that	c
the	i
tickets	i
did	i
not	i
have	i
discount	i
and	c
the	c
advertisement	c
says	i
the	i
will	i
have	i
.	c

So	c
,	c
how	c
is	c
possible	i
that	c
you	c
present	i
an	c
advertisement	c
and	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
make	i
what	c
it	c
say	i
?	c

Finally	c
,	c
it	i
supose	i
to	c
have	c
the	c
restaurant	c
open	c
,	c
and	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
,	c
because	c
they	c
did	c
n't	c
have	c
electricity	c
to	c
cook	c
,	c
so	c
they	c
close	i
it	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
really	c
made	i
and	c
I	c
want	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
,	i
please	i
call	c
me	c
to	i
the	c
number	c
23456789	c

I	c
will	c

How	c

?	c

Modern	c
technology	c
have	i
change	i

many	c
aspects	i

First	c
of	c
all	c
at	i
work	c

Dear	c
Sir	c

I	c
had	i
been	c
to	c
London	c
recently	c
for	c
a	c
week	c
's	c
holiday	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
to	c
a	c
musical	c
show	c
in	i
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
saw	c
the	c
advertisement	c
about	i
the	c
show	c
I	c
got	c
very	c
excited	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
always	c
wanted	c
to	c
see	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
had	c
some	c
problems	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
want	c
you	c
to	c
know	c
about	c
that	i
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
when	c
I	c
bought	c
the	c
tickets	c
I	c
had	i
no	c
discount	c
,	c
and	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
it	c
was	c
mentioned	i
that	c
people	c
would	c
have	i
some	c
,	c
and	c
when	c
I	c
got	c
in	i
the	c
theatre	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
play	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
wait	c
for	c
almost	c
an	c
hour	c
until	c
the	c
show	c
begun	c
.	c

Then	c
,	c
I	c
got	c
very	c
disappointed	c
because	c
the	c
actors	c
in	c
the	c
play	c
were	c
not	c
those	c
ones	c
mentioned	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
.	c

There	c
were	c
unknown	c
actors	c
,	c
and	c
they	c
were	c
not	c
as	c
good	c
as	c
the	c
other	c
ones	c
.	c

I	c
had	i
had	i
not	i
a	c
perfect	c
night	c
at	c
all	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
if	c
I	c
can	c
have	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

Please	c
give	c
me	c
an	c
answer	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

We	c
cannot	c
deny	c
that	c
technology	c
has	c
changed	c
our	c
lives	c
.	c

Nowadays	c
,	c
we	c
do	i
not	i
need	i
anymore	i
to	c
spend	c
hours	c
cooking	c
,	c
for	c
example	c
:	c
we	c
just	c
put	c
some	c
frozen	c
food	c
in	c
the	c
microwave	c
,	c
and	c
in	c
a	c
few	c
minutes	c
our	c
meal	c
is	c
ready	c
.	c

There	c
is	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
other	c
examples	c
of	c
how	c
technology	c
has	c
changed	c
people	c
's	c
lives	c
.	c

Also	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
communicate	c
with	c
some	c
friends	c
who	c
live	c
in	c
other	c
countries	c
by	c
e-mail	c
almost	c
every	c
day	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
save	c
some	c
money	c
because	c
I	c
pay	c
for	c
a	c
local	c
call	c
,	c
and	c
not	c
for	c
an	c
international	c
call	c
.	c

An	i
other	i
thing	c
which	c
is	c
very	c
useful	c
for	c
me	c
is	c
my	c
mobile	c
phone	c
,	c
because	c
people	c
can	c
talk	c
to	c
me	c
whenever	c
they	c
need	c
,	i
but	c
on	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
it	c
is	c
very	c
unpleasant	c
to	c
be	c
interrupted	c
by	c
the	c
phone	c
when	c
I	c
am	c
in	c
an	c
important	c
meeting	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Ryan	c
,	c

Besides	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
preffer	i
to	c
stay	c
in	c
tents	i
,	c
because	c
I	c
got	c
used	c
to	c
being	c
in	c
tents	c
since	c
each	i
summer	i
I	i
spent	i
my	i
holidays	i
with	c
my	c
friends	c
at	i
the	c
hills	c
.	c

In	c
adittion	i
,	c
I	c
would	c
rather	i
playing	c
tennis	c
.	c

I	c
also	c
like	c
surfing	c
,	i
I	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
dangerous	c
sport	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
know	c
how	c
to	c
practice	i
it	c
,	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
fact	c
that	c
last	c
year	c
a	c
proffessional	i
surfer	c
tought	i
me	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
should	c
take	c
and	c
if	c
it	c
is	c
possible	c
for	c
you	c
to	c
tell	c
me	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
will	c
need	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

From	c
my	c
point	c
of	c
view	c
,	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
,	c
because	c
sometimes	c
when	c
you	c
are	c
looking	c
for	c
a	c
special	c
good	i
you	c
never	c
find	c
it	c
.	c

Besides	c
,	c
I	c
do	c
not	c
like	c
to	c
waste	c
my	c
time	c
just	c
seeing	i
at	c
a	c
wide	c
variety	c
of	c
products	c
,	c
that	c
make	i
you	c
feel	c
confused	c
and	i
you	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
which	c
one	i
fits	c
you	c
,	c
instead	c
of	c
being	c
with	c
my	c
friends	c
or	c
doing	c
something	c
else	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
when	c
you	c
want	c
to	c
buy	c
something	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
be	c
sure	c
of	c
what	c
you	c
really	c
need	c
,	c
if	c
not	c
the	c
shop	c
assistant	c
has	c
the	c
ability	c
to	c
persuade	c
you	c
to	c
buy	c
something	c
you	c
do	c
not	c
want	c
.	c

Moreover	i
in	c
the	c
shops	c
that	c
sales	i
fashionable	c
clothes	c
.	c

Although	c
it	c
is	c
wonderful	c
to	c
buy	c
new	c
things	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
times	c
that	i
it	c
really	c
become	i
tiring	c
.	c

To	c
summarize	c
,	c
I	c
could	i
say	c
that	c
if	c
you	c
want	c
to	c
buy	c
something	c
,	c
first	c
make	c
sure	c
what	c
sort	c
of	c
product	c
you	c
need	c
and	c
then	c
,	i
go	c
shopping	c
.	c

I	c

glad	c
to	c

I	c
have	c
won	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
-	c
two	c
weeks	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
in	c
the	c
U.S.A.	c
Thank	c
you	c
for	c
asking	c
me	c
some	i
details	c
.	c

I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
.	c

Otherwise	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
work	c
at	c
a	c
business	c
department	c
office	i
as	i
a	c
assistant	c
from	c
the	c
beginning	i
of	i
Aguest	i
.	c

Accommodation	c
is	c
very	c
important	c
for	c
me	c
as	c
well	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
staying	c
in	c
log	c
cabins	c
.	c

I	c
've	c
got	c
some	c
skin	c
trouble	c
and	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
sleep	c
very	c
well	c
in	c
tents	c
.	c

I	c
have	i
ever	i
slept	c
in	c
tents	c
when	c
I	c
went	c
camping	c
.	c

That	c
time	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
sleep	i
in	c
tent	c
.	c

It	c
sounds	c
wonderful	c
!	c

I	c
'd	c
very	c
much	c
like	c
to	c
do	c
painting	c
and	c
swimming	c
.	c

Especially	c
I	c
love	i
water-painting	i
.	c

It	c
will	i
be	c
fantastic	c
experience	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

Actually	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	i
swimming	i
at	c
all	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
afraid	c
of	c
water	c
.	c

That	i
why	i
I	i
could	i
n't	i
have	i
swimmed	i
yet	c
.	c

I	c
expect	c
to	c
join	i
above	c
two	c
activities	c
.	c

I	c
want	c
to	c
know	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
need	c
.	c

And	c
please	c
let	c
me	c
know	c
How	c
the	c
weather	c
is	c
.	c

I	c
'll	c
buy	c
some	c
clothes	c
,	c
shoes	c
and	c
a	c
hat	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
must	c
know	c
if	c
it	c
is	c
cold	c
or	c
hot	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	i
Your	i
sincerely	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

Whenever	c
I	c
walk	c
in	c
the	c
street	c
,	c
I	c
always	c
want	c
to	c
go	c
into	c
the	i
every	c
shops	i
.	c

But	c
it	c
is	c
impossible	c
to	c
buy	c
everything	c
at	c
the	c
same	c
time	c
.	c

What	i
is	i
I	c
want	c
to	c
buy	c
and	c
I	c
decide	c
to	c
buy	c
some	c
items	c
.	c

If	c
I	c
have	c
got	c
enough	c
money	c
to	c
buy	c
something	c
what	i
I	c
want	c
to	c
buy	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
buy	c
them	c
and	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
no	c
problem	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
If	c
I	c
have	c
n't	c
got	c
enough	c
money	c
,	c
I	c
will	c
not	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
buy	c
what	c
I	c
want	c
and	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
very	i
big	c
problem	c
.	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
enjoyable	c
any	c
more	c
.	c

I	c
go	c
window	c
shopping	c
.	c

They	c
make	c
me	c
happy	c
and	c
rich	c
.	c

They	c
are	c
mine	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c

But	c
if	c
you	c
think	c
positive	c
opinion	i
about	c

,	c
It	i
will	c
make	c
you	c
the	c
happiest	c
and	c
the	c

in	c
the	c

June	c
2000	c

Dear	c
Ms.	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
almost	c
could	c
not	c
believe	c
it	c
when	c
I	c
received	c
the	c
letter	c
you	c
had	i
sent	i
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
indeed	i
!	c

I	c
am	c
working	c
as	c
a	c
Mechanical	c
Engineer	c
for	c
a	c
well-known	c
car	c
company	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
this	c
the	c
only	c
month	c
I	c
can	c
use	c
my	c
annual	c
leave	c
.	c

During	c
this	c
exciting	c
holiday	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
staying	c
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
.	c

The	c
reason	c
for	c
this	c
is	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
got	i
a	i
difficulty	c
in	i
sleeping	c
in	c
tents	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
was	c
at	c
the	c
Univercity	i
I	c
was	c
very	c
keen	c
on	c
basket	i
ball	i
and	c
I	c
was	i
playing	i
in	i
Univercity	i
's	i
team	c
.	c

In	c
1998	c
we	c
were	c
the	c
champion	c
of	c
the	c
First	c
National	c
Leque	i
.	c

Also	c
I	c
am	c
a	i
quite	i
good	c
swimmer	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
is	c
because	c
of	c
my	c
long	c
legs	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
would	c
love	c
to	c
join	i
Basketball	i
and	c
Swimming	i
activities	c
while	c
I	c
am	c
at	c
the	c
Camp	i
.	c

I	c
don	i
know	c
exactly	c
what	c
is	i
California	i
's	i
weather	i
lime	i
.	c

What	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	i
need	c
to	c
bring	c
with	c
me	c
?	c

Also	c
,	c
what	c
is	c
the	c
currency	c
in	c
California	c
and	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	i
need	c
to	c
take	c
with	c
me	c
?	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

Novadays	i
our	c
shopping	c
habits	c
seem	c
to	c
be	i
changed	c
.	c

Yes	c
!	c

There	c
was	c
only	c
one	c
shop	c
in	c
the	c
area	c
where	c
I	c
used	c
to	c
live	c
until	c
we	c
moved	c
to	c
Oxford	c
.	c

I	c
realized	c
that	c
I	c
'd	c
walked	c
so	c
many	c
times	c
in	c
front	c
of	c
the	c
entrance	c
but	c
the	c
door	c
had	c
looked	c
like	c
a	c
window	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
holding	c
a	c
peace	i
of	c
paper	c
which	c
my	c
mum	c
gave	c
to	c
me	c
.	c

But	c
no	c
way	c
!	c

I	c
started	c
looking	c
for	c
the	c
food	c
products	c
written	i
on	c
the	c
paper	i
but	c
I	c
found	c
only	c
the	c
eggs	c
,	c
milk	c
and	c
bread	c
.	c

Nothing	c
else	c
.	c

So	c
what	c
was	c
all	c
that	c
about	c
?	c
!	c

I	c
wasted	c
2	c
hours	c
to	i
buy	i
food	c
which	c
you	c
can	c
find	c
in	c
every	c
local	c
shop	c
.	c

Later	c
somebody	c
told	c
me	c
that	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
look	c
at	c
the	c
labels	c
on	c
the	c
top	c
.	c

Dear	c
sir	c
,	c

I	c
bought	c
a	c
ticket	c
for	c
the	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
musical	c
show	c
last	c
Saturday	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
felt	c
very	c
disappointed	c
with	c
it	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
announced	c
that	c
there	c
would	c
be	c
discount	c
tickets	c
available	c
,	c
but	c
there	c
were	c
not	c
.	c

And	c
,	c
the	i
worst	c
of	c
all	c
:	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
was	c
not	c
on	c
stage	c
.	c

He	c
was	c
replaced	c
by	c
a	c
novice	c
actor	c
who	c
made	i
a	c
very	c
disappointing	c
performance	c
.	c

Last	c
,	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
there	c
was	c
a	c
serious	c
leak	c
in	c
a	c
tube	i
and	c
the	c
kitchen	c
was	c
flooded	c
.	c

Yours	c
Sincerely	c
,	c

Several	c
technological	c
advances	c
in	c
the	c
past	c
five	c
years	c
have	c
changed	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
.	c

Information	c

spread	c
quickly	c

you	c
can	c
access	c
in	c
minutes	c
a	c
wide	c
range	c
of	c
data	c
,	c
that	i
would	c
take	c
a	c
much	c
longer	c
time	c
to	i
be	c
found	c
by	c
traditional	c
means	c
.	c

For	c
a	c
shy	c
person	c
,	c
like	c
me	c
,	c
Internet	i
has	c
another	c
attractive	i
:	c
the	c
possibility	i

and	c
making	c

It	c
's	c
very	c
exciting	c

I	c
exchange	c

with	c
dozens	c
of	c
people	c
all	c
over	c

Celular	i
phone	c

be	c
inconvenient	c
sometimes	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
can	c
be	c
very	c
useful	c
in	c
certain	c
situations	c
:	c
when	c
your	c
car	c
is	i
broken	c
on	i
the	c
road	c
,	c
when	c
you	c

at	c
any	c

Dear	c
Ms	c
Ryan	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
going	c
to	c
finish	c
my	c
exams	c
in	c
June	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
planning	c
to	c
go	c
back	c
to	c
China	c
in	c
early	c
August	c
.	c

So	c
if	c
I	c
could	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
,	c
and	c
coming	i
back	c
before	c
6th	i
of	c
August	c
,	c
that	c
would	c
be	c
great	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
never	c
had	c
any	c
experience	c
to	i
live	i
in	c
a	c
tent	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
give	c
it	c
a	c
go	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
I	c
will	c
enjoy	c
myself	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
.	c

I	c
love	c
swimming	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
am	c
not	c
any	c
good	c
at	c
swimming	c
.	c

I	c
really	c
wanted	i
to	c
learn	c
how	c
to	c
swim	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
wondering	c
if	c
there	c
is	c
a	c
coach	c
could	i
give	c
us	i
a	c
lesson	c
during	i
the	c
Camp	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
glad	c
I	c
had	i
taken	c
a	i
part	c
in	c
a	c
few	c
competitions	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
so	c
proud	c
of	c
our	c
basketball	c
team	c
.	c

Would	c
you	c
tell	c
me	c
that	i
how	c
much	c
money	c
you	c
would	i
give	c
it	i
to	c
me	c
and	c
how	i
is	i
the	i
weather	i
like	c
in	c
U.S.A.	i
Thank	c
you	c
for	c
every	i
thing	i
!	c

Yours	c
faithfully	i

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

It	c
was	c
great	c
to	c
hear	c
from	c
you	c
,	c
have	c
n't	c
seen	c
you	c
since	c
last	c
summer	c
holiday	c
,	c
hope	c
everything	c
is	c
fine	c
in	i
your	c
place	c
.	c

During	c
the	c
concert	c
,	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
have	c
a	c
lot	c
to	c
do	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
had	c
chance	i
to	c
see	c
most	c
of	c
the	c
performance	c
,	i
that	i
was	c
excellent	c
.	c

That	c
was	c
bit	i
boring	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
part	c
of	c
my	c
job	c
.	c

I	c
got	i
to	c
go	c
.	c

Write	i
to	i
you	i
next	i
time	i
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
&	c
Madam	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
this	c
letter	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
some	c
further	c
information	c
that	c
you	c
need	c
.	c

July	c
is	c
the	c
only	c
month	c
that	c
I	c
can	c
be	c
free	c
.	c

I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
try	c
this	c
time	c
.	c

Second	c
,	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
to	i
I	c
need	c
?	c

Dear	c
Kim	c

It	c
was	c
so	c
nice	c
to	c
hear	c
from	c
you	c
last	c
time	c
.	c

My	c
job	c
was	c
looking	c
after	c
her	c
when	c
she	c
had	c
a	c
break	c
time	c
.	c

I	c
guided	c
her	c
to	c
a	c
rest	c
room	c
and	c
served	c
her	c
a	c
cup	c
of	c
tea	c
,	c
and	c
so	c
on	c
.	c

Actually	c
,	c
I	c
could	c
have	c
a	c
chance	c
to	c
ask	c
her	c
about	c
music	c
,	c
her	c
favorite	i
artist	c
and	c
her	c
hobby	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
impressed	c
when	c
I	c
heard	c
that	c
she	c
liked	c
playing	i
puzzle	i
alone	c
.	c

She	c
seemed	c
to	c
be	c
very	i
active	c
woman	c
when	c
she	c
was	c
singing	c
but	c
at	c
the	c
same	c
time	c
she	c
had	c
very	i
gentle	c
attitude	c
when	c
she	c
spoke	c
to	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
became	c
a	c
fan	c
of	c
her	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
very	i
interesting	c
experience	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
wish	c
you	c
were	i
there	c
.	c

But	c
do	c
n't	c
worry	c
Kim	c

I	c
'll	c
send	c

a	c
copy	c

you	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
happy	c
to	c
hear	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c

I	c
also	c
have	c
some	c
questions	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
working	c
at	c
a	c
language	c
school	c
.	c

Due	c
to	c
a	c
shortage	c
of	c
teachers	c
in	c
summer	c
I	c
can	c
take	c
holiday	c
only	c
in	c
July	c
.	c

Second	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
sleep	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
slept	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
wanted	c
to	c
sleep	c
there	c
.	c

Third	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
chosen	c
'	c
Tennis	c
'	c
and	c
'	c
Photography	c
'	c
for	i
my	c
activities	c
at	c
the	c
Camp	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
been	c
playing	c
tennis	c
for	c
over	c
ten	c
years	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
teaching	c
children	c
to	c
play	c
tennis	c
for	c
three	c
years	c
.	c

I	c
took	c
up	c
taking	c
photos	c
four	c
years	c
ago	c
.	c

Since	c
then	c
I	c
have	c
entered	c
ten	c
competitions	c
and	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
three	c
times	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
could	c
you	c
please	c
let	c
me	c
know	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
should	c
take	c
with	c
me	c
?	c

I	c
would	c
also	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
should	c
take	c
with	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
and	c
travelling	c
to	c
the	c
U.S.A	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

This	c

not	i
only	i
in	i
Japan	i

famous	i

I	c
am	c
still	c
excited	c
while	c
I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
about	c
my	c
experience	c
.	c

First	c
,	c
I	c
helped	c
to	c
prepare	c
the	c
stage	c
before	c
the	c
band	c
arrived	c
.	c

They	c
were	c
very	c
heavy	c
and	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
carry	c
them	c
with	c
care	c
because	c
they	c
were	c
very	c
important	c
for	i
the	c
band	c
.	c

The	c
most	c
exciting	c
thing	c
about	c
my	c
experience	c
was	c
that	c
the	c
band	c
spoke	c
to	c
me	c
after	c
the	c
concert	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
so	c
exited	i
and	c
happy	c
that	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
remember	c
what	c
I	c
talked	c
with	c
the	c
band	c
.	i

I	c
want	c
to	c
help	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
again	c

16th	c
November	c
2000	c

Dear	c
Sir	c

According	c
to	c
your	c
brochure	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
be	c
the	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
;	c
instead	c
of	c
that	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
very	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
the	c
actors	c
were	c
n't	c
those	c
announced	c
.	c

Indeed	c
,	c
instead	c
of	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
;	i
we	c
had	c
mean	i
actors	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

So	c
when	c
Caroline	c
,	c
his	c
girlfriend	c
,	c
told	c
him	c
something	c
personal	c
and	c
very	c
important	c
;	i
because	c
she	c
trusted	c
in	c
him	c
;	i
immediatly	i
he	c
came	i
to	c
see	c
one	c
of	c
his	c
friend	i
to	c
tell	c
him	c
the	c
secret	c
.	c

So	c
immediatly	i
she	c
went	c
towards	i
Pat	c
,	c
angry	c
,	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
argue	c
with	c
him	c
,	c
saying	c
that	c
she	c
was	c
annoyed	c
by	c
the	c
way	c
he	c
behaved	c
,	c
and	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
the	c
first	c
time	c
that	c
he	c
was	c
n't	c
capable	c
of	c
keeping	c
a	c
secret	c
.	c

After	c
a	c
long	c
conversation	c
they	c
eventually	c
decided	c
to	c
split	c
up	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
about	c
the	c
trip	c
to	c
London	c
.	c

All	c
of	c
the	c
students	c
in	c
my	c
class	c
have	c
read	c
through	c
the	c
programmes	c
that	c
you	c
have	c
set	i
,	i
they	i
are	c
quite	c
interesting	c
,	c
especially	c
the	c
river	c
trip	c
to	c
Greenwich	c
,	c
because	c
some	c
of	c
us	c
may	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
university	c
there	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

So	c
we	c
can	c
walk	c
around	c
and	c
see	c
how	i
it	i
looks	i
like	i
in	i
Greenwich	i
.	c

It	c
is	c
from	c
10	c
am	c
to	c
7	c
p.m.	c
,	i
it	i
is	i
about	i
the	c
latest	c
fashion	c
,	c
leisure	c
and	c
sports	c
wear	c
,	c
make	i
up	i
and	c
hairstyles	c
,	i
all	i
of	c
us	c
are	c
really	c
interesting	i
,	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
free	c
for	c
student	i
to	c
get	c
in	c
as	c
well	c
.	c

So	c
may	i
you	c
please	c
change	i
the	c
visit	c
of	i
the	c
Science	c
Museum	c
to	i
Wednesday	c
afternoon	c
,	c
and	c
we	c
can	c
cancel	c
our	c
shopping	c
and	c
free	c
time	c
,	c
so	c
we	c
can	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
fashion	c
show	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
.	c

Yours	c
Faithfully	i
.	c

It	c
was	c
dangerous	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
knew	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
.	c

The	c
first	c
days	c
was	i
going	i
fine	c
,	i
we	i
just	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
some	c
teamwork	c
things	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
so	c
difficult	c
for	c
me	c
because	c
I	c
was	i
really	c
scared	c
to	c
stand	c
in	i
a	c
high	c
place	c
since	c
I	c
was	c
young	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
started	c
to	c
climb	c
really	c
slow	c
and	c
careful	i
,	c
and	c
I	c
climbed	c
about	c
15	c
metres	c
quite	c
success	i
,	c
so	c
I	c
tried	c
to	c
climb	c
quicker	c
because	c
the	c
destination	c
was	c
not	c
far	c
away	c
.	c

But	c
after	c
I	c
climbed	c
two	c
steps	c
more	c
,	c
my	c
right	c
feet	i
slipped	c
over	i
,	i
I	c
was	i
nearly	c
fell	c
down	i
,	c
but	c
luckly	i
my	c
hand	c
caught	c
a	c
rock	c
,	i
it	i
was	c
dangerous	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
had	i
any	c
choice	c
,	i
finally	i
I	c
did	c
it	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
:	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
:	i
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
,	c
presented	c
in	c
your	c
theatre	c
on	c
15th	c
of	c
June	c
.	c

I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
to	c
buy	c
the	c
ticket	c
and	c
expected	c
to	c
have	i
a	c
discount	c
as	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
student	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
not	c
understand	c
why	c
but	c
still	i
bought	c
the	c
ticket	c
because	c
I	c
was	c
crazy	c
about	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
.	c

Then	c
,	c
I	c
went	c
into	c
the	c
theatre	c
on	c
time	c
but	c
became	c
a	c
little	c
bit	c
angry	c
for	i
waiting	c
until	c
20:15	c
,	c
forty-five	c
minutes	c
after	c
the	c
expected	c
starting	c
time	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
so	c
disappointed	c
to	c
find	c
out	c
that	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
was	c
not	c
on	c
the	c
stage	c
and	c
the	c
leading	c
actor	c
sang	c
so	c
bad	i
that	c
I	c
left	c
the	c
theatre	c
before	c
it	c
finished	c
.	c

At	i
last	i
,	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
it	c
needed	c
cleaning	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
was	c
definitely	c
not	c
a	i
perfect	c
evening	c
as	i
garenteed	i
in	c
your	c
advertisement	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

Now	c
everybody	c
in	c
the	c
class	c
knew	c
my	c
mum	c
was	c
a	c
cleaner	c
and	c
teased	c
me	c
for	c
having	c
such	i
kind	c
of	c
mum	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
so	c
sad	c
about	c
it	c
and	c
did	c
not	c
forgive	c
Pat	c
even	c
though	c
she	c
apologise	i
for	i
thousands	c
of	c
times	c
.	c

She	c
told	c
us	c
there	c
were	c
numerous	c
types	c
of	c
job	c
in	c
the	c
world	c
.	c

Some	c
offered	c
a	c
high	c
salary	c
while	c
some	c
did	c
.	i

However	c
,	c
they	c
are	c
equal	i
important	c
for	c
our	c
society	c
.	c

Many	c
students	c
raised	c
their	c
hands	c
.	c

'	c
Who	c
wants	c
to	c
be	c
a	c
lawyer	c
?	c
'	c

Again	c
,	c
many	c
students	c
put	c
up	c
their	c
hand	c
.	c

But	c
when	c
she	c
asked	c
who	c
wanted	c
to	c
be	c
a	c
cleaner	c
,	c
nobody	c
raised	c
his	c
hand	c
and	c
I	c
felt	c
so	c
shameful	i
that	c
I	c
lowered	c
my	c
head	c
.	c

'	c
Cleaner	c
is	c
a	c
very	c
good	c
job	c
.	c
'	c

Mrs	c
Brown	c
said	c
with	i
a	c
loud	c
voice	c
.	c

'	c
If	c
there	c
were	c
no	c
cleaner	i
,	c
who	c
would	c
clean	c
the	c
school	c
for	c
us	c
,	i
who	i
would	c
keep	c
the	c
environment	c
nice	c
and	c
tidy	c
.	i
'	c

The	c
teacher	c
also	c
grinned	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
so	c
impressed	c
and	c
repeated	c
the	c
words	c
in	c
my	c
heart	c
:	c
'	c
All	c
the	i
jobs	c
have	c
the	c
same	c
importance	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

Being	c
on	c
a	i
holiday	c
trip	i
in	c
London	c
,	c
I	c
dreamed	c
to	i
go	i
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
for	i
a	c
musical	c
show	c
.	c

I	c
saw	c
your	c
advertisement	c
last	c
Monday	c
,	c
and	c
thought	c
"	i
It	c
is	c
that	c
one	c
that	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
try.	c
"	c

I	c
started	c
to	c
be	c
OK	c
with	c
the	i
"	c
Your	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
"	c
,	c
sure	i
not	i
to	i
be	c
deceived	c
.	c

But	c
all	i
was	c
disappointing	c
!	c

It	c
was	c
not	c
Danny	c
on	c
the	c
scene	i
!	c

Second	c
bad	c
point	c
:	c
beeing	i
not	i
narrowminded	i
,	c
I	c
accept	c
other	c
actors.	c
.	c

What	c
was	c
written	c
on	i
the	c
advertisement	c
?	c

The	c
summum	i
was	c
reached	c
when	c
I	c
saw	c
the	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
for	c
"	c
holidays	c
"	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
terribly	c
ennoyed	i
!	c

So	c
I	c
need	i
now	i
a	c
"	c
perfect	c
-	c
money	i
back	i
-	c
"	c
for	i
replacement	c
of	i
your	c
"	c
perfect	c

out	c

you	c
will	c

and	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
which	c
is	c
called	c
OVER	c
THE	c
RAINBOW	c
.	c

I	c
saw	c
the	c
show	c
on	c
17th	i
of	c
July	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
the	c
advertisement	c
claimed	c
discount	i
ticket	c
was	c
available	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
bought	c
a	c
second	c
musical	c
show	c
ticket	c
which	c
start	i
at	c
19:30	c
but	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
.	c

Thirdly	c
,	c
your	c
advertisement	c
misled	i
I	c
could	c
see	c
Danny	c
Brook	i
in	i
the	i
show	i
who	i
I	i
adore	i
.	c

When	c
I	c
turned	c
up	c
the	i
show	c
,	c
there	c
was	c
another	c
actor	c
instead	c
of	c
him	c
.	c

Fourthly	c
,	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
of	c
it	i
's	i
problems	c
.	c

But	i
I	i
could	i
go	i
evening	i
out	i
.	i

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
I	c
believe	c
your	c
advertisement	c
completely	c
misled	c
.	i

So	c
I	c
am	c
fully	c
entitled	c
to	c
ask	c
for	c
refund	i
except	i
for	i
evening	i
out	i
.	i

I	c
hope	c
this	c
matter	c
will	c
recieve	i
your	c
prompt	c
attention	c

yours	c

Nowadays	i

get	c
many	c
advantages	c
which	c
make	i
improve	c
our	c
lives	i
daily	i
,	c
on	i
the	i
other	i
hands	i
,	c
we	c
get	i
also	i
many	c
disadvantages	c
which	c
could	c
harm	c
us	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
the	c
main	c
advantage	c
is	c
developing	i
of	c
medical	c
technology	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
if	c
you	c
were	c
hurt	c
seriously	c
like	c
cutting	c
leg	i
,	i
the	c
new	c
medical	c
technology	c
could	c
rebuilit	i
part	c
of	c
your	c
body	c
.	c

The	c
more	c
developing	i
the	c
technology	c
is	c
,	c
the	c
quicker	c
and	c
easier	c
international	c
networking	c
is	c
.	c

So	c
at	c
the	c
same	c
time	c
many	c
people	c
can	c
share	c
some	c
information	c
even	c
though	c
they	c
live	c
in	c
different	c
country	i
.	c

By	c
developing	c
of	i
transport	c
,	c
we	c
can	c
get	c
wherever	c
you	i
want	c
to	c
go	c
easily	c
,	c
however	c
it	c
could	c
cause	c
serious	c
air	c
pollution	c
like	c
acid-rain	c
and	c
smog	c
.	c

In	c
conculsion	i
,	c
I	i
conciderly	i
said	i
we	i
has	i
been	i
charged	i
by	i
morder	i
technology	i
in	c
two	c
way	i

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
this	c
letter	c
to	c
you	c
,	i
because	c
during	c
my	c
stay	c
in	c
London	c
,	i
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
to	c
see	c
a	c
musical	c
show	i
,	c
and	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
very	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
.	c

Last	c
Saturday	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
see	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
read	c
the	c
advertisement	c
,	c
I	c
noticed	c
that	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
acted	c
in	c
this	c
musical	c
show	i
.	c

When	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
forty-five	c
minutes	c
later	i
,	c
I	c
realised	c
that	c
the	c
main	c
actor	c
had	c
been	c
changed	i
.	c

That	c
change	i
really	c
disappointed	c
me	c
.	c

Another	c
problem	c
was	c
that	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
have	i
any	c
discount	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
n't	c
alone	c
,	c
we	c
were	c
five	c
persons	i
.	c

Our	c
idea	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
,	i
was	c
to	c
visit	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

Nobody	c
could	c
give	c
me	c
an	c
answer	i
.	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
receiving	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

Secrets	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
a	i
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

That	c
night	c
my	c
parents	c
went	c
out	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
stay	c
home	c
with	c
Pat	c
.	c

I	c
invited	c
my	c
best	c
friends	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
asked	c
Christian	c
to	c
bring	c
some	c
videos	c
.	c

We	c
left	c
Pat	c
in	c
her	c
room	c
with	c
those	c
videos	c
,	c
and	c
we	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
top	c
of	c
the	c
house	c
,	c
the	c
third	c
floor	c
.	c

That	c
room	c
was	c
totally	c
dark	c
.	c

We	c
went	c
upstairs	c
with	c
only	c
a	c
candle	c
,	c
and	c
the	c
idea	c
of	c
planning	c
something	c
crazy	c
.	c

Manuel	c
had	c
a	c
farm	c
,	c
no	i
so	c
long	i
from	c
the	c
town	c
,	c
where	c
we	c
could	c
do	c
whatever	c
we	c
wanted	c
.	c

But	c
what	c
was	c
the	c
problem	c
.	i

I	c
thought	c
of	c
the	c
idea	c
of	c
telling	c
our	c
parents	c
that	c
we	c
had	c
a	i
camping	c
with	c
the	c
school	c
.	c

We	c
were	c
all	c
agree	i
.	c

Manuel	c
opened	c
the	c
door	c
,	c
and	c
there	c
she	c
was	c
,	c
Pat	c
with	c
Ramiro	c
's	c
sister	c
hearing	i
all	c
our	c
conversation	c
.	c

Dear	c
Ms	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

Thanks	c
a	c
lot	c
for	c
your	c
briefly	i
and	c
nice	c
letter	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
pleased	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
the	c
information	c
required	c
:	c

Firstly	c
,	c
the	c
most	c
suitable	c
month	c
would	c
be	c
in	i
July	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
busy	c
in	i
my	c
work	c
now	c
,	c
and	c
my	c
children	c
are	c
in	i
holiday	c
then	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
log	c
cabins	c
,	c
because	c
they	c
are	c
more	c
comfortable	c
.	c

I	c
confess	c
you	i
that	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
been	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
and	c
till	i
now	i
I	c
have	c
never	c
had	c
the	i
intention	c
to	i
do	i
it	c
.	c

The	c
activities	c
are	c
really	c
interesting	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
take	c
part	c
on	i
Painting	c
and	c
Climbing	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
not	c
very	c
good	c
painting	i
,	c
but	c
I	c
like	i
it	c
because	c
is	i
a	c
good	c
oportunity	i
to	c
practice	i
it	c
.	c

Personally	c
,	c
Climbing	c
is	c
an	c
interesting	c
activity	c
,	c
where	c
you	c
need	c
concentration	c
and	c
you	c
are	c
working	c
with	c
your	c
whole	c
body	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
want	c
to	c
dissapoint	i
you	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
am	c
beginner	c
!	c

I	c
choose	c
these	c
activities	c
because	c
I	c
love	c
challenges	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
appreciate	c
if	i
you	c
can	i
tell	i
me	c
a	c
couple	c
of	c
ideas	c
about	c
clothes	i
I	c
need	i
there	c
.	c

Thanks	c
in	c
advance	c

Dear	c

I	c

August	c
,	c

I	c

,	i
you	c
offer	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
activities	c
,	i
that'is	i
fantastic	c
!	c

It	c
is	c
very	c
difficult	c
to	c
decide	c
which	c
two	c
of	c
these	c
activities	c
I	c
like	c
and	i
I	c
can	c
also	c
do	c
the	i
best	c
.	c

The	c
other	c
activity	c
I	c
like	c
very	c
muche	i
is	c
swimming	c

I	c
took	i
part	c
at	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
competitions	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

I	c
am	c
happy	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
about	c
the	c
experience	c
I	c
made	i
at	c
the	c
pop	c
concert	c
last	c
month	c
.	c

We	i
first	i
had	c
to	c
prapare	i
the	c
stands	c
with	c
food	c
and	c
drinks	i
and	c
buy	c
something	c
which	c
had	c
been	c
forgotten	c
.	c

Then	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
put	i
on	i
the	c
night	i
lights	i
and	c
decorate	c
the	c
whole	c
room	c
.	c

He	c
is	c
very	c
beatiful	i
!	c

I	c
logically	i
accepted	c
.	c

The	c
concert	c
was	c
a	c
success	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
proude	i
of	c
me	i
and	c
the	c
work	c
I	c
had	c
done	c
.	c

We	c
went	c
to	c
a	c
nice	c
restaurant	c
and	c
enjoyed	c
dinner	c
together	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
sure	c
my	i
dear	c
Kim	c
,	c
I	c
will	c
never	c
forget	c
that	c
wonderful	c
experience	c
.	c

lot	i

Saturday	c
,	c
June	c
,	c
17th	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	i
've	i
read	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
that	c
the	c
actors	c
who	c
were	c
playing	c
that	c
night	c
were	c
D.	c
Brook	c
and	c
T.	c
Truelove	c
.	c

Now	c
you	c
can	c
guess	c
how	c
disappointed	c
I	c
was	c
when	c
I	c
saw	c
that	c
there	c
were	c
different	c
(	c
and	c
worse	c
)	c
actors	c
!	c

Moreover	c
,	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
really	c
hungry	c
because	c
I	c
had	c
n't	c
had	c
my	c
dinner	c
that	c
evening	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
be	c
on	c
time	c
for	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
It	i
was	c
n't	c
a	c
"	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
"	c
.	c

I	c
'd	c
rather	c
say	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
catastrophe	c
!	c

And	c
I	c
am	c
really	c
sorry	c
,	c
but	c
consequently	c
I	c
would	c
ask	c
you	c
for	c
some	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
considering	c
my	c
request	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
it	c
disturbs	c
nobody	c
,	c
and	c
that	c
's	c
great	c
.	c

Yet	c
my	c
hand	c
phone	c
is	c
in	c
my	c
bag	c
and	c
I	c
bring	i
it	c
everywhere	c
.	c

In	i
my	i
point	i
of	i
view	i
,	c
modern	c
technology	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
thing	c
unless	c
it	c
is	c
used	c
to	c
serve	c
bad	c
intentions	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
the	c
exellent	i
programme	c
you	c

a	c
quite	c
lie	c
and	c
I	c

you	c
my	i
disappointment	c
.	c

Every	c

were	i
wrong	c

(	c
I	c
wondered	c
if	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
fake	c

)	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
will	c
understand	c
my	i
evening	c
was	c
detestable	c
and	c
you	c
will	c
give	c
me	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
!	c

Poor	i
of	i
I	i
,	c
I	c
thought	c
it	c
was	c
nice	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
friend	c
and	c
to	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
share	c
lots	c
of	c
things	c
!	c

I	c
had	c
read	c
a	c
very	c
good	c
book	c
about	c
pirates	c
and	c
I	c
know	c
I	c
got	i
a	c
very	c
creative	c
imagination	c
.	c

To	i
make	i
to	i
profit	i
my	i
ideas	i
my	c
parents	c
lived	c
in	c
a	c
small	c
village	c
near	c

wonderful	c
country	i

The	c
highest	c

near	c
a	c

I	c
have	c
ever	c
seen	c

It	c
was	c
our	c
fortress	c
and	c
every	c
day	c
we	c
could	c
improve	c
it	c

I	c
prefered	i

It	c
was	c

Pat	i

I.	c
Child	i

He	c
had	c
a	c

All	c

from	i

.	c

I	c
could	c
say	c
that	c
I	c
am	c
quite	c
good	c
at	c
it	c
.	c

However	i
,	c
I	c
used	c
to	c
assist	c
my	c
brother	c
,	c
who	c
is	c
a	c
profecional	i
photographer	c
.	c

So	c
that	i
,	i
I	c
consider	c
myself	c
expirienced	i
enough	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
afraid	c
that	c
July	c
is	c
the	c
only	c
appropriate	i
month	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
due	c
to	c
start	c
work	c
in	c
August	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
for	c
further	c
information	c
about	c
spending	i
allowance	c
and	c
the	c
clothes	c
which	c
I	c
am	i
supposed	i
to	i
take	i

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

I	c
'm	c
sorry	c
I	c
have	c
n't	c
written	c
for	c
so	c
long	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
've	c
been	c
quite	c
busy	c
just	c
recently	c
.	c

The	c
singer	c
,	i
who	c
took	i
place	i
,	i
was	c
n't	c
one	c
of	c
my	c
favourites	c
,	c
but	c
having	c
the	c
opportunity	c
to	c
experience	c
being	c
stuff	i
there	c
,	i
was	c
just	c
amazing	c
.	c

Do	c
you	c
know	c
what	c
Kim	c
,	c
I	c
've	c
never	c
thought	c
before	c
,	i
that	c
enjoying	c
yourself	c
like	c
this	c
,	i
could	c
be	c
weirdly	c
.	i

I	c
think	c
you	c
never	c
realize	c
this	c
,	i
until	c
you	c
're	c
not	c
a	c
part	c
of	c
the	c
crowd	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
'm	c
really	c
happy	c
,	i
that	c
I	c
had	c
even	c
small	i
role	c
in	c
making	i
people	c
enjoying	i
themselves	c
.	c

This	c
was	c
maybe	c
the	c
best	c
part	c
of	c
being	c
there	c
.	c

I	c
suppose	c
,	i
I	c
will	c
never	c
forget	c
that	c
night	c
.	c

That	c
's	c
about	c
all	c
my	c
news	c
,	c
I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
hearing	i
from	c
you	c
.	c

Lots	c
of	c
love	c
,	c

The	c
advertisment	i
also	c
says	c
that	c
there	c
are	c
discounts	c
available	c
but	c
this	c
is	c
not	c
true	c
,	c
there	c
were	c
none	c
.	c

For	i
me	i
it	i
was	i
really	i
not	i
a	i
perfect	i
evening	i
,	c
I	c
was	c
expecting	c
a	c
nice	c
evening	c
but	c
in	c
fact	c
it	c
was	c
terrible	c
.	c

Because	c
of	c
these	c
problems	c
I	c
had	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
for	c
a	i
compensation	c
,	c
maybe	c
to	c
get	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

I	c
wish	i
you	c
answer	c
me	c
soon	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
the	i
modern	c
technology	c
has	c
changed	i
my	i
daily	i
life	i
not	i
really	i
a	c
lot	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
just	c
20	c
years	c
old	c
and	c
I	c
used	c
to	c
play	c
computer	i
when	c
I	c
was	c
young	c
or	c
wash	c
my	c
clothes	c
in	c
the	c
washing	c
machine	c
.	c

It	c
becomes	c
more	i
and	i
more	i
easier	i
to	c
use	c
the	c
computer	c
for	c
everything	c
.	c

You	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
shop	c
to	c
buy	c
clothes	c
or	c
to	c
the	c
restaurant	c
to	c
order	c
some	c
food	c
.	c

That	i
goes	i
quicker	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
easier	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

Because	c
the	c
biggest	c
developments	c
were	c
in	c
the	c
last	c
50	c
years	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
this	c
occasion	i
I	i
'd	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
only	c
in	c
July	c
,	c
because	c
,	c
in	i
the	c
rest	c
of	c
the	c
year	c
,	c
I	c
'm	c
working	c
in	c
a	c
bank	c
.	c

The	c
second	c
reason	c
is	c
the	c
weather	c
.	c

I	c
love	c
travelling	c
when	c
the	c
weather	c
is	c
warm	c
.	c

About	i
the	c
accommodation	c
,	c
I	c
'd	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
log	i
cabins	i
,	c
because	c
for	i
me	i
and	i
my	i
family	i
's	i
more	i
comfortable	i
.	c

I	c
have	c
a	c
baby	c
and	c
three	c
dogs	c
,	c
so	c
it	c
should	c
be	c
better	c
in	c
log	i
cabins	i
.	c

I	c
'd	c
like	c
spend	c
all	c
of	c
time	i
in	c
a	c
swimming-pool	i
because	c
I	c
love	c
swimming	c
.	c

Only	i
one	c
question	c
about	c
a	i
baby	c
's	c
accomodation	i
.	c

May	c
I	c
have	c
a	c
babysitter	c
?	c

I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
have	c
more	c
free	c
time	c
for	c
myself	c
and	c
my	c
health	c
.	c

I	c
've	c
never	c
been	c
there	c
,	c
so	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
a	c
pleasure	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

Let	c
me	c
say	c
still	i
thank	i
you	i
.	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
meting	i
you	c

How	c
are	c
you	c
?	c

Do	c
you	c
remember	c
which	c
is	c
my	c
favourite	c
group	c
?	c

The	c
group	c
needs	i
to	c
found	i
a	c
good	c
microphone	c
for	c
the	c
concert	c
,	c
because	c
the	c
singer	c
lost	c
his	c
microphone	c
last	c
concert	c
.	c

Me	c
and	c
my	c
friend	c
were	c
there	c
to	c
hear	c
the	c
sound-check	c
,	c
and	c
when	c
I	c
understood	c
was	i
happing	i
on	c
the	c
stage	c
,	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
help	c
them	c
.	c

Of	c
course	c
you	c
know	c
,	i
I	c
'm	c
a	c
singer	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
came	c
back	c
quigky	i
to	c
my	c
home	c
,	c
I	c
picked	c
my	i
microphone	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
handed	c
it	c
to	c
the	c
singer	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
so	c
glad	c
,	c
because	c
in	i
the	c
ending	i
of	c
show	i
the	c
singer	c
kissed	c
me	c
and	c
dedicated	c
to	i
me	i
a	i
lovely	i
song	i
.	c

Can	c
you	c
immagine	i
?	c

Yours	c
Irene	c

With	i
the	i
reference	i
of	i
the	c
advertisement	c
published	c
in	c
the	c
New	c
Strait	c
Times	c
newspaper	c
on	c
the	c
22nd	c
of	c
MAY	c
2000	c
,	c
I	c
,	c
as	c
a	c
consumer	i
,	c
who	c
is	c
a	c
musical	i
show	i
avid	i
and	c
a	c
great	c
fans	i
of	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
who	c
is	i
said	c
to	c
be	c
stared	i
in	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
presentation	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
really	c
furious	c
of	i
watching	c
a	c
show	c
starring	c
by	i
a	c
different	c
actor	c
,	c
instead	c
of	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
.	i

Besides	c
this	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
almost	c
45	c
minutes	c
later	c
than	c
what	i
it	c
was	c
said	i
to	c
be	i
.	c

The	i
Price	i
of	i
the	i
ticket	i
was	i
said	i
that	i
there	i
would	i
be	i
discounts	i
available	i
.	c

I	c
was	c
really	c
hungry	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
and	c
was	c
pissed	i
off	i
.	c

With	i
all	c
the	c
above	c
points	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
for	c
some	c
money	c
return	i
.	c

I	c
would	i
consider	c
to	i
bring	i
this	c
complains	i
to	c
the	i
court	c
if	c
I	c
do	c
not	c
receive	c
any	i
agreeable	i
explaination	i
from	c
the	c
theatre	c
.	c

Your	i
faithfully	c
,	c

However	c
,	c
things	c
re	i
recycling	i
from	c
time	c
to	c
time	c
.	c

So	i
do	i
the	i
objective	i
of	i
wearing	i
clothes	i
.	c

I	c
will	i
imagine	i
that	c
,	i
people	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
,	c
for	c
example	c
100	c
years	c
from	c
now	c
,	c
will	c
wear	c
clothes	c
for	c
protection	c
like	c
people	c
did	c
in	c
the	c
past	c
.	c

The	i
people	i
in	c
the	c
past	c
wear	i
clothes	c
to	c
protect	c
themselves	c
from	c
the	c
cold	c
air	c
,	c
hot	c
weather	c
and	c
strong	c
wind	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
people	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
will	c
likely	i
to	i
wear	i
helmets	c
with	c
oxygen	i
gas	i
well	i
provided	i
.	c

It	c
is	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
increasing	c
number	i
of	c
population	i
and	c
the	c
shortage	c
of	c
the	i
oxygen	c
gas	c
in	c
the	c
atmosphere	c
.	c

They	c
will	c
also	c
wear	c
water-proof	c
,	c
ultra-violet	i
proof	i
and	c
other	c
dangerous	i
liquid-proof	i
clothes	c
to	c
protect	c
themselves	c
These	i
clothes	c
have	c
to	c
be	c
made	c
of	c
something	c
light	c
,	c
suitable	i
to	c
wear	c
and	c
protective	c
.	c

All	c
the	c
above	c
ideas	c
are	c
needed	c
to	c
make	i
them	i
bare	i
no	i
burden	i
when	c
wearing	c
these	c
special	i
designed	c
clothes	c
.	c

The	c
future	c
is	c
a	i
hope	c
and	c
a	i
dream	c
for	c
everyone	c
in	i
the	c
earth	c

14th	c
June	c
2000	c

Dear	c
Miss	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
really	c
pleased	c
to	c
be	c
the	c
winner	c
of	c
your	c
competition	c
and	c
I	c
cannot	c
help	c
thinking	c
about	c
the	c
two	c
weeks	c
in	c
the	c
USA	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
only	c
in	c
June	c
given	i
that	c
my	c
wife	c
will	c
come	c
with	c
me	c
:	i
her	c
holiday	i
are	c
only	c
in	c
June	c
.	c

Indeed	i
,	i
my	i
wife	c
is	c
afraid	c
of	c
sleeping	c
in	c
tents	c
.	c

Moreover	i
,	i
I	c
practice	i
Basketball	i
in	c
a	c
famous	c
French	c
Club	i
:	i
That	i
is	c
the	c
reason	c
why	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
choose	c
the	c
Basketball	i
.	c

If	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
chose	i
an	i
other	i
activity	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
I	c
would	c
do	c
Photography	i
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
practiced	i
but	c
I	c
feel	c
to	i
like	i
discovering	i
that	i
.	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
what	c
sort	c
of	c
clothes	c
must	c
we	c
have	c
for	c
the	c
different	c
activities	c
?	c

I	c
hope	c
my	c
answers	c
will	c
satisfy	c
you	c
.	c

I	c
thank	c
you	c
again	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Tom	c
Turner	c

That	c
is	c
why	c
I	c
propose	c
to	c
start	c
our	c
film	c
with	c
the	c
beginning	c
of	c
the	c
day	c
,	c
when	c
all	c
students	i
come	c
in	i
class	i
.	c

After	c
that	c
could	i
come	i
the	i
lunch	c
which	i
takes	c
two	c
hours	c
per	c
day	c
.	c

the	c
afternoon	c

We	c
could	c
begin	c
the	c
afternoon	c
with	c
the	i
sport	c
,	c
showing	c
the	c
different	c
places	i
with	c
surroundings	i
(	c
near	i
the	i
wild	i
)	c
:	c
it	c
would	c
give	c
a	c
good	c
impression	c
.	c

I	c
advise	c
to	i
finish	i
with	c
a	c
lesson	i
of	i
Chemistry	i
so	c
that	c
people	c
see	c
the	c
laboratery	i
.	c

Before	c
that	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
have	c
showed	i
the	c
break	c
at	c
3	c
o'clock	c
which	i
is	c
important	c
for	c
us	c
.	c

Dear	c
Manager	c
:	c

Like	i
I	c
have	c
already	c
told	c
you	c
,	c
instead	c
of	c
being	c
the	c
perfect	c
evening	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
the	c
worst	c
I	c
ever	c
had	c
.	c

First	c
,	c
the	c
actors	c
that	c
the	c
Circle	c
theatre	c
publis	i
in	i
their	c
tickets	c
for	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
were	c
not	c
,	i
which	c
was	c
very	c
disappointing	c
because	c
,	i
the	c
actors	c
were	i
starring	c
the	i
musical	c
,	i
was	i
one	c
of	c
it	i
mayor	i
attractions	c
.	c

In	i
consequence	i
of	i
the	c
reasons	c
I	c
have	c
already	c
explained	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
if	c
I	c
can	c
have	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
,	c
but	c
this	c
is	c
not	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
to	i
me	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
want	c
your	c
theatre	c
to	c
change	c
and	c
become	c
the	c
best	c
.	c

Hope	c
to	c
hear	c
from	c
you	c
:	c

Science	c
and	c
Technology	c
is	c
a	c
theme	c
very	c
discussed	i
nowdays	i
,	c
most	c
of	c
the	c
comunity	i
of	c
our	c
city	c
,	c
and	c
of	c
the	c
world	c
,	c
were	i
technology	c
has	c
arrived	c
,	c
confirms	c
that	c
it	c
has	c
in	c
some	c
way	c
improved	c
their	c
way	c
of	c
life	c
.	c

Answering	i
the	c
question	c
:	c
"	c
How	c
has	c
modern	c
technology	c
changed	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
?	c
,	i
I	c
can	c
confirm	c
,	i
that	c
it	c
has	c
been	c
in	c
many	c
ways	c
,	c
and	c
the	c
most	c
important	c
one	c
that	c
I	c
can	c
remember	c
was	c
the	c
invention	c
of	c
computers	c
and	c
later	c
the	c
internet	i
,	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
easiest	i
to	i
me	c
,	c
and	c
to	i
every	i
one	i
,	c
to	c
make	i
your	c
home	i
works	i
,	c
school	i
works	i
,	c
and	c
in	i
fact	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
easier	c
to	i
me	c
to	c
search	c
for	c
information	c
that	c
in	c
the	c
past	c
I	c
would	c
have	c
to	c
look	c
at	i
in	c
a	c
library	c
.	c

But	c
not	c
all	i
about	c
technology	c
and	c
computers	c
is	c
good	c
,	c
because	c
many	c
people	c
,	c
and	c
me	c
in	c
a	c
control	i
way	c
,	c
had	i
become	c
computer	i
's	i
an	i
thechnologic	i
's	i
slaves	c
,	c
and	c
we	c
can	i
not	i
do	c
anything	c
without	c
a	c
machine	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
not	c
saying	c
that	c
it	c
's	c
wrong	c
or	c
bad	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
accept	c
that	c
they	c
make	c
easier	i
our	i
daily	i
tasks	i
,	c
but	c
we	c
have	c
to	c
mantain	i
our	c
independence	c
as	c
humans	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
glad	c
to	c
hear	c
that	c
I	c
won	i
the	c
competition	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
a	c
summer	c
holiday	c
from	c
at	i
the	c
end	c
of	c
June	c
to	c
at	i
the	c
begging	i
of	c
September	c
as	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
student	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
am	c
planing	i
to	c
work	c
in	c
August	c
as	i
a	c
part-time	c
job	c
.	c

I	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
tents	c
rather	c
than	c
log	c
cabins	c
,	i
because	c
I	c
have	c
had	i
a	i
camping	c
once	c
and	c
I	c
stayed	c
in	c
tents	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
great	c
to	c
have	c
a	i
fun	c
and	c
also	c
it	i
was	i
very	i
good	i
memorise	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
quite	c
good	c
at	c
singing	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
a	c
talent	c
about	i
singing	c
that	c
I	i
can	c
entertain	c
people	c
by	c
singing	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
I	c
am	c
keen	c
on	c
swimming	c
but	c
actually	c
I	c
am	c
not	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
swimming	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
just	c
started	c
to	c
learn	c
swimming	i
but	c
I	c
have	c
really	c
been	c
enjoying	c
it	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
good	i
chance	c
to	c
improve	c
my	c
swimming	c
.	c

In	c
fact	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
some	c
questions	c
that	i
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
will	c
need	c
,	c
what	c
else	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
bring	c
with	c
and	i
if	i
I	i
have	i
a	i
emergency	i
what	i
you	i
can	i
do	i
for	i
.	c

Once	c
again	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
happy	c
to	c
have	c
such	c
a	c
good	c
opportunity	c
and	c
I	c
hope	c
this	c
letter	c
can	i
bring	i
what	c
you	c
want	c
to	c
know	c
about	c
me	c
.	c

Han	c

It	c
is	c
not	c
,	c
however	c
,	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
that	i
there	c
are	c
both	c
advantages	c
and	c
disadvantages	c
.	c

Also	c
shopping	c
makes	c
people	c
happier	c
by	c
using	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
money	c
and	c
it	c
influnce	i
even	i
economic	i
situation	i
more	i
flexably	i
.	i

When	c
we	c
are	c
having	i
a	i
shopping	c
,	c
we	c
often	c
find	c
that	c
the	c
place	c
where	c
people	c
often	c
go	c
for	c
a	i
shopping	c
is	c
too	c
crowed	i
and	c
it	c
makes	c
us	c
more	c
tired	c
.	c

Also	c
there	c
are	c
plenty	c
of	c
dangerous	i
that	i
lots	c
of	c
people	c
have	c
wallet	i
stollen	i
because	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
public	c
place	c
and	c
there	c
are	c
too	c
many	c
people	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
shop	i
owner	i
often	c
cheat	c
their	c
customers	c
by	c
increasing	c
the	c
cost	c
secreatly	i
.	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
shopping	c
is	c
very	i
important	c
part	c
of	c
our	c
life	c
and	c
we	c
can	c
have	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
fun	c
,	c
however	c
it	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
which	c
means	c
we	c
can	i
not	i
find	c
only	c
advantages	c
from	i
it	c
.	c

Dear	c
Ms	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
very	i
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
going	c
to	c
California	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
in	c
July	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
going	c
to	c
have	c
my	c
summer	c
holidays	c
in	c
that	c
month	c
.	c

Therefore	c
,	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
sleep	c
in	c
a	c
bed	c
.	c

Also	c
tents	c
are	c
not	c
fairly	i
comfortable	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
I	c
keen	i
on	c
painting	c
,	c
however	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
painted	c
in	c
my	c
life	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
try	c
it	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
,	c
could	c
you	c
advice	i
me	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
need	c
for	c
the	c
trip	c
?	c
and	c
is	c
there	c
anything	c
else	c
do	i
I	c

I	i
've	i
received	i
your	c
letter	c
two	c
days	c

and	c
I	c
'm	c
quite	c
happy	c
to	c
know	c
that	c

passed	c
F.C.E.	c
I	c
'm	c
ok	c
and	c
let	c
me	c
tell	c
you	c
about	c
my	c
last	i
experience	c
.	c

I	c
went	c
to	c
Madrid	c
last	c
week	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
walking	c
in	c
the	c
street	c
when	c
somebody	c
asked	c
me	c
an	i
address	c
.	c

I	c
looked	c
at	c
him	c
and	c
I	c
realised	c
that	c
this	c
person	c
was	c
David	c
Bowie	c
.	c

Yes	c
!	c
!	c
!	c

I	c
could	c
n't	c
believe	c
it	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
I	c
started	c
to	c
speak	c
in	c
English	c
with	c
him	c
.	c

Well	c
my	c
friend	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
go	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
got	i
an	c
appoinment	i

the	c
Dentist	c
.	c

Write	c

Dir	i
Madam	c
!	c

I	c
'm	c

your	c
competition	c
!	c

The	c
most	c
suitable	c
time	c
for	c
me	c
is	c
Jule	i
because	c
in	c
August	c
I	c
intend	c
to	c
go	c
in	i
the	c
countryside	c
,	c
where	c
I	c
have	c
a	c
small	c
farm	c
.	c

I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
the	c
log	c
cabins	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
like	c
wet	c
places	c
like	c
tends	i
after	c
rain	c
.	c

You	c
ofer	i
me	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
activities	c
.	c

I	c
play	c
basketball	c
and	c
tennis	c
very	c
well	c
.	c

I	c
went	i
to	c
try	c
surfing	c
and	c
climbing	c
because	c
I	c
've	c
never	c
done	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
've	c
got	i
also	i
two	c
questions	c
.	c

How	c
much	c
money	c
I	i
need	c
to	c
stay	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
and	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	i
should	i
take	c
with	c
me	c
?	c

Please	c
let	c
me	c
know	c
!	c

Regards	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
!	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
,	c
which	c
arrived	c
this	c
morning	c
.	c

You	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
how	c
was	i
the	i
Top-Pop	i
Concert	i
,	c
which	c
I	c
helped	c
to	c
organise	c
last	c
month	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
absolutlly	i
great	c
!	c

I	c
was	c
responsible	c
about	i
a	i
security	c
of	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
sectors	c
.	c

I	c
gave	c
information	c
about	c
correct	c
ways	c
to	c
another	i
places	c
like	c
tooletes	i
and	c
medical	c
points	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
also	c
asked	c
about	c
a	i
timetable	c
of	c
the	c
concert	c
and	c
I	c
looked	c
for	c
drugs	c
,	c
knifes	i
and	c
so	c
on	c
in	c
bags	c
.	c

Although	c
I	c
worked	c
I	c
watched	c
the	c
concert	c
.	c

I	i
was	c
big	i
fun	c
!	c

People	c
danced	c
,	c
screamed	c
and	c
sung	i
with	c
a	i
singer	c
.	c

OK	c
.	c

Take	c
care	c
!	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
if	i
you	i
could	c
to	i
have	i
my	c
vacation	c
trip	i
on	i
July	c
because	c
is	i
the	c
only	c
time	c
of	c
the	c
year	c
that	c
my	c
job	i
could	i
let	c
me	c
have	c
a	c
vacation	c
.	c

As	c
for	c
the	c
accommodation	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
the	c
tent	c
because	c
it	c
is	i
my	i
first	c
time	c
that	c
I	i
'm	i
going	i
to	i
camping	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
see	c
how	i
the	i
real	i
life	i
is	i
.	c

I	c
was	c
so	c
thrilled	c
when	c
I	c
saw	c
that	c
I	c
could	c
do	c
some	c
activities	c
also	i
.	c

I	c
'm	c
a	c
very	c
good	c
swimmer	c
but	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
anything	c
about	c
climbing	i
that	i
's	i
why	c
I	c
choose	i
it	c
because	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
try	c
something	c
knew	i
.	c

At	i
last	i
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
about	c
my	c
clothes	c
and	c
how	i
the	i
weather	i
is	i
going	i
to	i
be	i
and	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
must	c
to	i
take	i
with	c
me	c
.	c

That	c
is	c
all	c
.	c

Everyone	c
has	c
likes	c
and	c
dislikes	c
.	c

There	c
is	i
times	c
that	i
you	c
have	c
to	c
do	c
something	c
even	c
if	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
like	c
it	c
,	c
and	c
times	c
that	i
you	c
are	c
doing	c
what	c
you	c
like	c
but	c
not	c
the	i
time	c
you	c
like	i
it	i
.	c

You	c
say	c
you	c
enjoy	c
shopping	c
I	i
understand	c
but	c
life	c
goes	c
on	i
you	i
ca	c
n't	c
do	c
the	c
same	c
things	c
every	c
day	c
.	c

live	i
your	c
life	c
and	c
try	c
to	c
do	c
different	c
things	c
and	c
you	c
will	c
see	c
that	c
to	i
do	i
different	c
things	c
is	c
exciting	c
and	c
more	c
fun	c
.	c

You	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
to	c
be	c
bored	c
with	c
the	c
same	c
old	c
things	c
.	c

Because	c
as	c
I	c
said	c
to	i
do	i
what	c
you	c
like	c
is	c
good	c
only	c
if	c
you	c
do	c
it	c
when	c
you	c
like	c
it	i
and	c
how	c
you	c
like	c
it	i
and	c
remember	c
if	c
you	c
have	c
long	i
time	c
to	c
do	c
something	c
the	i
you	c
enjoy	c
it	c
more	c
.	c

Dears	c
Ms.	c
Helen	i
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
was	c
really	c
greatful	i
when	c
I	c
recieved	i
your	c
letter	c
which	c
informed	c
me	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
.	c

Because	c
my	c
school	c
finishes	c
end	i
of	c
June	c
and	c
I	c
will	c
have	c
a	c
month	i
break	c
after	i
that	c
I	i
have	c
to	c
do	c
a	c
computing	c
course	c
which	c
I	c
have	c
already	c
applied	c
for	c
it	i
.	c

Personily	i
I	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
log	c
cabins	c
because	c
they	c
are	c
much	c
more	c
comfortable	c
than	c
tents	c
.	c

I	c
really	c
enjoy	c
swimming	c
and	c
playing	c
tennis	c
.	c

Maybe	c
I	c
will	c
have	c
time	c
to	c
do	c
enough	c
practise	i
as	i
much	c
as	c
I	c
always	c
wanted	c
to	c
do	c
.	c

Could	c
you	c
tell	c
me	c
what	c
sort	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
would	c
need	c
to	c
bring	c
with	c
me	c
and	c
will	c
I	c
need	c
any	c
extra	c
money	c
for	c
this	c
holiday	c
.	i

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
!	c

Yours	c
sincerly	i
,	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
where	c
to	c
start	c
but	c
I	c
can	c
say	c
it	c
was	c
the	c
greatest	i
time	c
I	c
have	c
ever	c
had	c
.	c

Next	c
day	c
when	i
I	c
went	c
there	c
I	i
have	i
met	i
lots	c
of	c
people	c
very	i
famous	c
and	c
very	c
friendly	c
.	c

It	c
took	c
us	c
almost	c
a	c
month	c
to	c
prepare	c
for	c
this	c
concert	c
.	c

You	c
would	c
n't	c
believe	c
how	c
hard	c
it	c
was	c
.	c

the	i
stage	c
was	c
covered	c
with	c
all	c
sort	i
of	c
light	c
and	c
we	c
made	c
it	c
look	c
like	c
a	c
waterfall	c
.	c

The	c
waterfall	c
made	i
by	i
real	c
rock	c
so	c
that	c
was	c
the	c
worst	c
bit	c
because	c
they	i
were	i
really	c
heavy	c
and	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
carry	c
them	i
,	c
but	c
the	i
end	c
of	c
moth	i
when	c
the	c
concert	c
started	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
all	c
over	c
.	c

I	c
sung	i
and	c
dance	i
all	c
day	c
.	c

I	c
wish	c
you	c
were	c
there	c
.	c

I	c
hope	i
you	c
shared	c
my	c
happiness	c
with	c
me	c
.	c

Lots	c
of	c
love	c

Dear	c
Jane	c
Clark	c

With	c
attendance	i
to	c
the	c
annual	c
international	c
arts	c
festival	c
which	c
you	i
took	c
place	c
on	c
21	c
and	c
22th	i
November	c
2000	c
,	c
I	c
spend	i
tremendous	i
two	c
days	c
enjoying	c
some	c
features	i
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
the	c
title	c
'	c
International	c
Arts	c
Festival	c
'	c
is	c
very	c
suitable	c
for	c
the	c
festival	c
,	c
because	c
there	c
were	i
some	c
variety	c
of	c
features	i
in	i
it	i
.	c

Next	c
,	c
One	i
reasonably-priced	c
weekend	c
ticket	c
for	c
all	c
events	c
is	c
also	c
fantastic	i
idea	c
,	c
because	c
everyone	c
could	c
enjoy	c
everything	c
by	i
the	i
ticket	c
.	c

While	c
you	c
stated	c
that	c
there	c
were	c
stars	c
and	c
artists	c
from	c
around	c
the	c
world	c
,	c
they	c
were	c
from	i
only	i
six	i
countries	i
in	i
fact	i
.	c

Therefore	c
,	c
I	c
strongly	c
recommend	c
that	c
you	c
should	c
collect	i
artists	c
and	c
stars	c
more	i
than	c
six	c
countries	c
and	c
rebuild	i
larger	c
concert	c
halls	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
be	c
grateful	i
to	c
support	c
you	c
providing	c
that	c
you	c
would	i
like	i
to	c
make	c
the	c
festival	c
more	c
successful	c
.	c

Dear	c
Albert	c

So	c
this	c
is	c
quick	i
note	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
what	c
you	c
want	c
to	c
know	c
,	c
as	c
you	c
asked	c
about	c
school	c
rules	c
and	c
house	c
ones	c
.	c

At	c
school	c
,	c
the	c
most	c
horrible	c
one	c
is	c
school	i
uniform	c
.	c

I	c
really	c
hate	c
it	c
,	c
because	c
we	c
're	c
not	c
allowed	c
to	c
wear	c
casual	c
and	c
fashonable	i
clothes	c
,	c
colourful	c
shoes	c
and	i
colourful	c
socks	c
.	c

We	i
ca	i
n't	i
also	i
turn	i
our	c
hair	c
colour	c
an	i
have	c
to	c
keep	c
hair	i
length	c
above	c
eye	i
blows	i
.	c

Next	c
,	c
we	c
're	c
not	c
allowed	c
to	c
get	c
driver	i
licences	c
which	c
are	c
for	c
a	c
motorbike	c
and	c
car	c
as	c
long	c
as	c
we	i
've	i
students	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
at	c
home	c

I	c

looking	c
forward	c
to	c
the	c
new	c
experiance	i
I	c
am	c
going	c
to	c
have	c
.	c

For	c
the	c
two	c
activities	c
I	c
can	c
choose	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
have	i
swimming	c

Basketball	c

I	c
have	c
always	c
found	c
these	c
kind	i

activity	c
make	c
me	c
fell	i
strong	c
and	c
enjoy	i

Introduction	c

It	c
is	c
base	i
on	c
information	c
made	c
availble	i
by	c
student	i
from	c
each	c
class	c
at	c
school	c
.	c

Lessons	c

Most	c
student	i
who	c
were	c
interviewed	c
suggested	c
to	i
have	i
a	c
speaking	c
part	c
of	i
the	c
lesson	c
to	i
be	c
on	c
film	c
.	c

It	c
seemed	c
to	c
be	c
the	c
most	c
interesting	c
lesson	c
,	c
because	c
student	i
always	c
make	c
some	c
mistake	i
while	c
they	c
are	c
practising	c
with	c
thier	i
partner	c
,	c
in	c
spite	c
of	c
having	i
told	i
from	i
teacher	i
ten	c
times	c
.	c

It	c
felt	i
to	c
be	c
a	c
good	c
memory	c
to	c
be	c
remember	i
and	c
remind	i
our	i
sleves	i
to	c
speak	c
in	c
a	c
correct	c
way	c
.	c

We	c
also	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
history	c
on	i
.	c

Activities	c

Going	c
out	c
to	c
visit	c
the	c
history	i
town	c
every	c
weekend	c
seem	i
to	c
be	c
the	c
most	c
enjoyable	c
activity	c
for	c
student	i
.	c

Spending	c
time	c
together	c
out	c
of	c
the	c
class	c
is	c
the	i
nice	c
experiance	i
.	c

Having	i
a	c
sport	c
after	c
class	c
it	i
also	c
fun	c
.	c

Conclusion	c

Lesson	i
and	c
activities	c
,	i
which	c
most	c
student	i
suggested	c
are	c
very	c
interesting	c
and	c
it	i
is	i
not	c
seem	c
to	c
be	c
boring	c
for	c
the	c
student	i
.	c

I	c
learnt	c
from	c
you	i
letter	c
that	c
I	c
've	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
.	c

I	c
felt	i
how	i
luck	i
I	i
was	i
.	c

I	c
understood	i
you	c
want	c
to	c
know	c
when	c
am	i
I	i
available	c
to	c
set	c
off	c
and	c
where	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
stay	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
go	c
U.S.A	i
in	i
July	c
because	c
of	c
my	c
university	c
.	c

My	c
exams	c
will	c
have	c
finished	c
at	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
June	c
.	c

I	c
will	c
only	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
set	c
off	c
in	c
July	c
and	c
I	i
also	i
will	c
give	c
my	c
thesis	c
to	c
my	c
teacher	c
in	c
August	c
.	c

This	c
holiday	c
will	c
help	c
me	c
to	c
think	c
and	i
prepare	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
'd	c
prefer	c
staying	i
in	c
log	i
cabins	i
because	c
I	c
need	c
a	c
proper	c
place	c
to	c
say	i
and	c
study	c
.	i

When	c
I	c
get	c
the	i
camp	c
,	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
swim	c
and	c
climb	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
fond	c
of	c
swimming	c
but	c
unfortunately	c
I	c
am	c
not	c
a	c
good	c
swimmer	c
.	c

Do	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
bring	c
any	c
special	c
clothes	c
?	c

Do	c
you	c
have	c
any	c
idea	c
what	c
is	i
the	i
weather	i
going	c
to	c
be	c
?	i

How	c
much	c
mone	i
do	c
you	c
recommend	c
me	c
to	c
bring	c
with	c
me	c
?	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

I	c
do	c
apologise	c
for	c
this	c
.	c

How	c
are	c
you	c
?	c

How	c
is	c
your	c
new	c
school	c
and	c
parents	i
?	c

I	c
hope	c
we	c
can	c
catch	c
up	c
with	c
each	c
other	c
's	c
news	c
.	c

Last	c
month	c
I	c
helped	c
the	c
service	c
crew	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
unbelievable	c
and	i
tiring	c
as	c
well	c
.	c

Believe	c
it	c
or	c
not	c
I	i
put	c
make	i
up	i
on	c
one	c
famous	c
singer	c
's	c
face	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
just	c
walking	c
down	c
by	c
dressing	i
room	c
manager	i
said	i
that	i
if	c
I	c
could	c
help	c
them	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
n't	c
believe	c
my	c
eyes	i
.	c

I	c
was	c
in	c
her	c
room	c
and	i
helping	c
her	c
.	c

I	c
advise	c
you	c
to	c
do	c
something	c
like	c
that	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

I	c
like	i
to	c
answer	c
the	c
questions	c
you	c
request	i
from	i
me	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
should	c
say	c
that	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
of	i
this	i
is	c
the	c
month	c
wich	i
I	c
could	c
more	i
likely	c
have	c
off	c
at	i
work	c
for	i
going	i
on	c
holiday	c
.	c

That	c
is	c
because	c
I	i
do	c
not	c
want	c
to	c
seem	c
fuzy	i
but	i
I	c
like	c
to	c
have	c
some	c
comodities	i
when	c
I	c
am	c
going	c
on	c
holiday	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
slepping	i
over	i
the	c
floor	c
without	c
electricity	c
it	i
may	c
annoy	c
me	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
like	i
to	c
choose	c
swimming	c
as	c
activity	i
in	c
the	c
Camp	c
.	c

I	c
love	c
swimming	c
and	c
also	c
I	c
should	c
say	c
that	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
this	c
sport	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
doing	c
that	i
for	c
long	i
time	c
.	c

On	i
the	i
contrary	i
,	c
painting	c
is	c
an	c
activity	c
wich	i
I	c
have	c
never	c
tryied	i
before	c
,	c
so	c
that	i
I	c
have	c
not	c
any	c
skill	c
in	c
drawing	c
but	c
I	c
like	i
start	i
doing	c
that	c
know	i
when	c
I	c
have	c
the	c
chance	c
.	c

So	c
that	c
is	c
my	c
second	c
choice	c
.	c

On	i
the	i
other	i
hand	i
,	i
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
some	c
imformation	i
wich	i
could	c
be	c
useful	c
in	i
my	c
holiday	c
like	c
:	c
which	i
type	c
of	c
clothes	c
could	i
be	c
more	c
suitable	c
for	c
me	c
in	c
the	c
Camp	c
?	c

Do	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
bring	c
something	i
else	c
?	c

If	c
is	i
so	c
,	c
please	c
let	c
me	c
know	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

I	c
am	c
writting	i
to	c
tell	c
you	c
about	c
my	c
experience	c
in	i
the	c
last	i
month	i
pop	i
concert	i
,	c
where	c
I	c
was	c
helping	c
my	c
friend	c
Nick	c
who	i
was	c
the	c
bouncer	c
of	i
the	c
place	i
.	c

That	i
was	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
with	c
lots	c
of	c
famous	c
singers	c
like	c
Madona	c
,	c
Julio	c
Iglesias	c
,	c
and	c
people	c
like	c
them	c

That	i
was	c
a	c
charity	c
concert	c
to	c
save	i
money	c
to	i
poor	c
people	c
of	i
AFRICA	c
.	c

My	c
job	c
it	i
was	c
to	c
accomodate	i
to	i
the	i
people	i
of	i
the	i
main	i
sit	i
of	i
the	i
theathre	i
.	c

Of	c
course	c
those	c
places	c
were	c
reserved	c
just	c
for	c
people	i
well-knowed	i
who	c
wanted	c
to	c
help	c
by	c
joined	i
the	c
concert	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
ask	c
them	c
for	c
their	c
identifications	i
and	c
for	c
their	c
invitations	c
.	c

After	c
that	c
,	c
I	c
have	i
to	c
take	c
them	c
to	c
their	c
respective	c
sit	i
.	c

At	c
first	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
bit	c
scare	i
,	c
I	c
mean	c
I	i
was	c
afraid	c
not	i
be	i
good	c
enough	c
to	c
have	i
a	i
good	i
performance	i
as	c
assistant	i
;	c
but	c
finally	c
every	i
thing	i
went	c
well	c
.	c

I	c
should	c
say	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
the	c
easiest	c
and	c
more	i
interesting	c
job	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
ever	c
done	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
I	c
hope	c
to	c
see	c
you	c
earliest	i
to	c
show	c
all	i
my	c
phothos	i
.	c

I	c
think	c
,	i
it	c
was	c
very	c
cleaver	i
of	c
me	c
to	c
record	c
that	c
moment	c
wich	i
I	c
will	c
never	c
ever	c
forget	c
,	c
and	c
that	c
was	c
the	c
think	i
that	c
I	c
more	i
liked	i
of	i
that	c
experience	c
.	c

Looking	c
forward	c
to	c
getting	c
your	c
reply	c
and	c
to	c
seeing	c
you	c
soon	c

lots	c
of	c
love	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

Last	c
week	c
,	c
I	c
,	c
my	c
husband	c
and	c
our	c
two	c
children	c
went	c
to	c
your	c
theatre	c
spend	i
a	c
good	c
time	c
,	c
but	c
we	c
were	c
so	c
disappointed	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
think	i
it	i
's	i
not	i
professional	c
to	c
change	c
the	c
principal	c
actor	c
in	i
the	c
last	c
minute	c
,	c
the	c
play	c
should	c
be	i
with	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
there	c
were	c
n't	c
discounts	i
available	c
like	i
writting	i
in	c
your	c
advertisement	c
.	c

It	i
's	i
why	c
,	c
it	i
would	c
be	c
grateful	c
,	i
if	c
you	c
could	c
give	c
me	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
in	c
the	c
very	c
near	c
future	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

Every	c
day	c
,	c
like	c
everybody	c
,	c
I	c
watch	c
the	c
TV	c
,	c
see	c
the	c
International	c
news	c
,	c
hear	i
the	c
radio	c
,	c
play	c
games	c
on	c
my	c
computer	c
or	c
get	i
across	i
with	c
American	c
or	c
Asia	i
people	c
without	c
going	i
out	i
to	i
my	c
house	c
.	c

It	c
seem	i
be	i
incredible	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
's	c
commun	i
habits	i
for	c
us.	c
.	c

we	c
do	c
n't	c
think	c
that	c
there	i
is	i
less	c
of	i
a	c
hundred	c
years	c
,	i
nothing	i
of	c
that	c
existed	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
to	c
this	c
,	c
thinking	i
also	i
,	i
to	i
the	i
medicine	i
,	i
science	i
or	i
astronomy	i
progress	i
...	c

The	c
scientists	c
are	i
again	i
ten	c
years	c
to	c
find	c
the	c
solution	c
...	c

I	c
have	c
just	c
been	c
there	c
and	c
noticed	i
some	c
points	i
which	c
could	c
make	c
the	c
festival	c
better	c
.	c

There	c
were	c
a	c
number	c
of	c
stars	c
and	c
artists	c
from	c
around	c
the	c
world	c
,	c
but	c
from	i
only	i
six	c
countries	c
.	c

Fourthly	c
,	c
everyone	c
seems	c
to	c
have	c
enjoyed	c
seeing	c
dance	i
shows	c
and	c
the	c
art	c
exhibitions	c
and	c
listening	c
to	c
the	c
talks	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
a	c
ticket	c
for	c
each	c
event	c
is	c
expensive	c
.	c

I	c
suggest	c
you	c
have	c
a	c
oneday	i
ticket	c
or	c
a	c
reasonable	i
ticket	c
for	c
every	c
event	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
be	c
grateful	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
think	c
about	c
it	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Speaking	c
of	c
rules	c
,	c
most	c
of	c
them	c
are	c
annoying	c
!	c

There	c
're	c
plenty	c
of	c
rules	c
in	c
my	c
high	c
school	c
.	c

That	c
's	c
so	c
stupid	c
!	c

And	c
also	c
we	c
're	c
not	c
allowed	c
to	c
bring	c
any	c
sweets	c
.	c

I	c
know	c
some	c
rules	c
are	c
necessary	c
to	c
control	c
the	c
students	c
.	c

The	c
school	c
uniform	c
is	c
a	c
good	c
example	c
.	c

And	c
the	c
advantage	c
of	c
this	c
is	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
need	c
to	c
think	c
about	c
what	c
to	c
put	c
on	c
every	c
morning	c
!	c

In	c
my	c
house	c
,	c
I	c
'm	c
allowed	c
to	c
do	c
anything	c
unless	c
it	c
bothers	c
somebody	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
not	c
allowed	c
to	c
go	c
out	c
late	c
at	c
night	c
.	c

That	c
's	c
wonderful	c
!	c

I	c
'll	c
write	c
to	c
you	c
soon	c
!	c

Love	c

I	i
have	i
won	c
the	i
first	c
prise	i
in	c
your	c
Competition	i
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
only	c
in	c
June	c
because	c
I	c
will	c
start	c
working	c
in	c
July	c
that	i
means	c
I	c
will	c
not	c
be	c

later	i

Concerning	c
to	i
the	c
activities	c
which	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
choose	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
inform	c
you	c
that	c
I	c
am	c
fond	c
of	c
photography	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
quite	c
good	c
in	i
it	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
attended	c
a	c
relevant	c
course	c
for	c
three	c
months	c
.	c

According	i
to	i
my	c
work	c
experience	c
as	c
a	c
lifeguard	c
I	c
will	c
choose	c
swimming	c
as	c
the	c
second	c
activity	c
.	c

Could	c
you	c
please	c
tell	c
me	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
bring	c
with	c
me	c
?	c
(	c
like.	c
.	c

How	c
much	c
money	c
do	c
I	c
need	c
?	c

Is	c
it	c
true	c
or	c
not	c
?	c

If	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
work	c
and	c
you	c
have	c
plenty	c
of	c
time	c
going	c
shopping	c
is	c
really	c
enjoyable	c
,	c
because	c
there	c
are	c
big	c
shopping	c
centres	c
in	c
which	c
you	c
can	c
find	c
so	c
many	c
different	c
things	c
.	c

There	c
are	c
new	c
products	c
which	c
you	c
could	c
not	c
imagine	c
that	i
could	c
be	c
so	c
interesting	c
.	c

Shopping	c
is	c
a	c
good	c
way	c
to	c
kill	c
your	i
time	c
and	c
some	i
times	i
you	c
can	i
not	c
realize	c
how	c
fast	c
the	c
time	c
goes	c
.	c

This	c
happens	c
because	c
people	c
enjoy	i
themselves	c
a	c
lot	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
there	c
are	c
some	c
disadvantages	c
.	c

for	i
example	c
if	c
you	c
are	c
a	c
working	c
mother	c
with	c
three	c
children	c
,	c
that	i
means	c
you	c
are	c
always	c
n	i
a	c
hurry	c
,	c
going	c
shopping	c
is	c
really	c
unenjoyable	c
.	c

You	c
go	i
shopping	i
in	c
a	c
big	c
supermarket	c
because	c
you	c
know	c
you	c
will	c
find	c
everything	c
there	c
and	c
you	c
need	c
15	c
minutes	c
to	c
find	c
the	c
goods	c
and	c
20	c
minutes	c
to	c
pay	c
for	c
them	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
big	c
queue	c
.	c

You	c
need	c
to	c
buy	c
essential	c
items	c
like	c
food	c
and	c
you	c
get	c
tired	c
because	c
it	c
very	i
crowded	c
and	c
you	c
spend	c
more	c
time	c
thank	i
you	c
prefer	i
to	c
.	c

In	c
Conclusion	i
shopping	c
is	c
enjoyable	c
but	c
not	c
when	c
it	c
is	c
too	c
buzy	i
.	c

You	c
should	c
avoid	c
the	c
peak	c
times	c
.	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
,	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
which	c
said	c
I	c
had	i
won	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
really	c
surprise	i
to	c
hear	c
that	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
afraid	c
I	c
can	c
only	c
make	c
it	c
on	i
July	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
taking	c
exams	c
this	c
month	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
I	c
'll	c
prepare	c
everything	c
for	c
going	c
to	c
University	c
on	i
August	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
no	c
time	c
until	c
Christmas	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
the	c
best	c
time	c
is	c
July	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
how	c
interesting	c
it	c
is	c
to	c
live	c
in	c
tents	c

About	c
the	i
Basketball	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
played	i
it	c
for	c
seven	c
years	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
play	c
basketball	c
with	c
local	c
people	c
at	c
the	c
Camp	c
to	c
see	c
how	c
good	c
they	c
are	c
,	c
if	c
I	c
can	c
.	c

What	c
kinds	c
of	c
clothes	c
shall	i
I	c
take	c
?	c
how	i
about	c
the	c
weather	c
there	c
?	c

Would	i
you	c
give	c
me	c
some	c
pocket-money	c
during	c
the	c
trip	c
.	i

Also	c
,	c
may	c
I	c
take	c
a	c
friend	c
with	c
me	c
,	i
how	i
much	c
will	i
she	c
pay	c
?	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c

a	c
short	c
video	c
about	c
daily	c
life	c
at	c

I	c
found	c
that	c
most	c
of	c
them	c

suggested	i
that	c
four	c
lessons	c
should	c
be	c
filmed	c
which	i
as	i
follow	c

it	c
makes	c
you	c
more	c

when	c

how	c
to	c

what	c
you	c
want	c
to	c

Also	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
two	c
activities	c
should	i
be	c
filmed	c

1	c

Students	c
are	i
talking	i
to	c
each	c
other	c
when	c
they	c
are	c
having	c
break	i

2	c
.	c

Teacher	i
are	i
helping	i
students	c
with	c
their	c
problems	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
have	c
problem	i
on	i
studing	i
,	c
asking	i
teachers	i
is	i
the	c
best	c
way	c
.	i

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
as	c
regards	c
the	c
letter	c
you	c
've	c
sent	c
me	c
about	c
the	c
competition	c
I	c
've	c
won	c
.	c

I	c
've	c
never	c
been	c
camping	c
before	c
,	c
I	c
guess	c
I	c
'm	c
not	c
an	c
outdoor	c
girl	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
give	c
it	c
a	c
try	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
'd	c
rather	c
tents	c
than	c
cabins	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
really	c
keen	c
on	c
sports	c
,	c
especially	c
sailing	c
.	c

I	c
've	c
practised	i
sailing	c
since	c
an	c
early	c
age	c
and	c
I	c
perfectly	i
manage	i
the	i
rigging	i
and	i
sail	i
.	c

I	c
'm	c
also	c
fond	c
of	c
tennis	c
,	c
I	c
've	c
just	c
started	c
my	c
lessons	c
and	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
continue	c
practising	i
during	c
the	c
summer	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
not	c
really	c
sure	c
of	i
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
to	c
take	c
,	i
could	i
you	c
please	c
write	c
to	c
me	c
specifying	c
what	c
would	c
be	c
suitable	c
?	c

While	c
we	c
were	c
in	c
Florence	c
my	c
wallet	c
was	c
stolen	c
,	c
probably	c
by	c
a	c
gypsie	i
.	c

I	c
was	c
so	c
annoyed	c
!	c

I	c
was	c
in	c
the	c
Plaza	c
Espagna	c
in	c
Florence	c
without	c
a	c
penny	c
!	c

My	c
friends	c
lent	c
me	c
some	c
money	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
more	c
than	c
120	c
pounds	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
to	c
buy	c
my	c
dress	c
,	c
it	i
's	i
accesories	i
and	c
besides	i
clothes	c
and	c
souvenirs	c
!	c

I	c
felt	c
really	c
bad	c
seeing	c
my	c
friends	c
buy	c
the	c
latest	c
fashion	c
while	c
the	c
only	c
thing	c
I	c
could	c
do	c
was	c
tell	c
them	c
how	c
great	c
their	c
clothes	c
were	c
and	c
of	c
course	c
window-shop	c
.	c

In	c
your	c
letter	c
you	c
mentioned	c
that	c
I	c
could	c
choose	c
between	c
sleeping	c
in	c
tents	c
or	c
log	i
cabin	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
sleep	c
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
please	c
.	c

Because	i
last	c
time	c
I	c
was	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
,	c
I	c
found	c
it	c
really	c
uncomfortable	c
and	c
when	c
it	c
rained	c
in	c
the	c
night	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
got	i
to	c
sleep	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
sound	c
of	c
water	c
hitting	c
the	c
tent	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerly	i

Shopping	c
can	c
be	c
very	c
exciting	c
and	c
fun	c
.	c

The	c
feeling	c
of	c
buying	c
new	c
things	c
is	c
wonderful	c
.	c

We	c
all	c
go	c
shopping	c
,	c
maybe	c
not	c
every	c
day	c
,	c
but	c
certainly	c
at	c
least	c
once	c
a	c
week	c
.	c

Shopping	c
is	c
very	c
important	c
because	c
it	c
's	c
the	c
only	c
way	c
to	c
get	c
things	c
.	c

You	c
will	c
not	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
survive	c
without	c
food	c
.	c

But	c
buying	c
things	c
that	c
do	i
not	c
need	c
or	c
you	c
have	c
not	c
planned	c
to	c
might	c
make	c
you	c
feel	c
good	c
at	c
the	c
time	c
,	c
but	c
days	c
or	c
weeks	c
later	c
when	c
you	c
realise	c
you	c
did	c
not	c
need	c
to	c
spend	c
money	c
on	c
them	c
,	c
you	c
might	c
regret	c
buying	c
them	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
you	c
did	c
not	c
plan	c
to	c
buy	c
any	c
crisps	c
,	c
but	c
they	c
are	c
at	c
half	c
price	c
and	c
you	c
buy	c
them	c
without	c
thinking	c
.	c

But	c
after	i
you	c
never	c
eat	c
them	c
and	c
just	c
bin	c
them	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Brown	c
,	c

It	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
pleasure	c
to	c
us	c
and	c
to	c
your	c
husband	c
to	c
come	c
at	i
the	c
party	c
.	c

All	c
the	c
students	c
wanted	c
to	c
organise	c
a	c
surprise	c
party	c
for	c
Mr	c
Brown	c
.	c

We	c
would	c
like	c
you	c
to	c
come	c
and	c
if	i
you	c
can	c
to	i
help	c
us	c
in	i
an	c
important	c
decision	c
.	c

He	c
must	c
not	c
learn	c
about	c
it	c
subsequently	i
you	c
must	c
not	c
tell	c
him	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
the	c
party	c
will	c
take	c
place	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
16th	c
of	c
June	c
at	i
College	i
Canteen	i
.	c

We	c
think	c
the	i
suitable	c
time	c
will	c
be	c
3-6	c
p.m.	c
You	c
can	c
come	c
earlier	c
,	c
if	c
you	c
want	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
will	i
come	i
some	i
teacher	i
,	c
of	c
course	c
all	c
the	c
students	c
and	c
the	c
Principal	c
.	c

Can	c
you	c
help	c
us	c
?	c

We	c
ar	i
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
your	c
reply	c
.	c

I	c
am	i
waiting	c
him	i
to	c
come	c
.	c

Suddenly	c
the	c
bell	c
rings	i
.	c

I	c
thought	c
that	c
would	i
be	c
John	c
and	c
was	i
he	c
.	c

He	c
would	c
go	c
to	c
work	c
in	c
a	c
cafÃ©	c
.	c

He	c
would	c
earn	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
money	c
,	c
in	c
addition	c
they	c
wanted	c
an	i
another	c
person	c
.	c

Then	c
we	c
had	c
an	c
idea	c
!	c

We	c
would	c
have	c
much	i
money	c
from	c
the	c
work	c
.	c

lovely	c
letter	c

I	c
'm	c

How	c
are	c
you	c
?	c

I	c
really	c
like	i
to	c
tell	c
you	c
all	c
my	i
experience	c
.	c

I	c
worked	c
in	c
a	c
team	c
by	i
seven	c
people	c
.	c

We	c
were	c
mainly	c
on	i
work	i
for	i
all	c
the	c
lights	c
at	c
this	c
great	c
concert	c
.	c

Its	i
sounds	c
easy	c
,	c
just	c
for	i
the	c
light	i
.	c

In	c
addition	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
a	i
nine	c
days	c
hard	i
work	c
to	c
mount	c
all	c
the	c
different	c
spot	c
and	c
houndreds	i
of	c
Coblights	c
on	i
the	c
right	c
place	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
we	c
had	i
worked	i
the	c
hohl	i
night	c
befor	i
the	c
concert	c
.	c

We	c
had	c
to	c
adjust	c
the	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
in	c
reply	c
to	c
your	c
letter	c
in	c
wich	i
you	c
told	c
me	c
I	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
.	c

It	c
would	c
be	c
very	c
convenient	c
if	c
I	c
could	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
,	c
because	c
by	c
that	c
time	c
I	c
'll	c
be	c
on	c
my	c
school	c
holidays	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
agree	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
tent	c
as	i
accommodation	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
stayed	c
in	c
one	c
and	c
I	c
wonder	c
this	i
might	c
be	c
a	c
great	c
feeling	c
and	c
that	i
this	c
way	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
in	c
a	i
deeper	i
contact	c
with	c
the	c
animals	c
that	c
live	c
in	c
the	c
area	c
.	c

I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
about	c
the	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
should	c
take	c
,	c
if	c
it	c
's	c
cold	c
or	c
hot	c
by	i
this	i
time	c
of	c
the	c
year	c
and	c
if	c
I	c
should	c
bring	c
any	c
money	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
butterflies	i
of	i
excitement	i
and	c
I'am	i
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c
.	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
if	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
those	c
spending	c
sprees	c
very	c
often	c
,	c
shopping	c
can	c
be	c
a	c
pleasant	c
experience	c
and	c
a	c
chance	c
to	c
spend	c
some	c
quality	c
time	c
with	c
your	c
family	c
.	c

Have	c
you	c
ever	c
spent	c
more	c
money	c
than	c
you	c
could	i
in	i
a	c
visit	c
to	c
the	c
shopping	c
center	c
?	c

If	c
you	c
answered	c
no	c
,	c
congratulations	c
.	c

Everyone	c
had	i
or	c
will	c
have	c
one	c
while	c
shopping	c
.	c

But	c
do	c
n't	c
be	c
afraid	c
.	c

Going	c
to	c
the	c
shopping	c
centre	c
with	c
you	i
family	c
can	c
be	c
a	c
good	c
experience	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
a	c
moment	c
in	c
that	i
you	c
can	c
talk	c
to	c
your	c
relatives	c
and	c
use	c
this	c
conversation	c
to	c
know	i
more	c
about	c
yourselves	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
I	i
was	c
really	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
the	c
performance	c
of	c
the	c
leading	c
actor	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
but	c
sadly	c
he	c
was	c
n't	c
there	c
,	c
he	c
was	c
filled	i
in	i
by	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
,	c
who	c
was	c
instead	i
rather	c
disappointing	c
.	c

At	c
the	c
ticket	c
office	c
I	c
also	c
asked	c
for	c
a	c
discount	c
but	c
they	c
told	c
me	c
this	c
was	c
n't	c
possible	c
,	c
instead	i
your	c
advertisement	c
said	i
clearly	i
there	c
were	c
discounts	c
available	c
!	c

At	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
the	c
show	c
I	c
was	c
so	c
tired	c
that	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
eat	c
something	c
at	c
your	c
restaurant	c
,	c
but	c
surprisingly	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
due	c
to	c
some	c
unreasonable	i
technical	c
problems	c
!	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
:	c
he	c
always	c
wanted	c
to	c
know	c
everything	c
about	c
everybody	c
and	c
after	i
,	c
of	c
course	c
,	c
he	c
would	c
give	c
away	c
all	c
he	c
knew	c
,	c
but	c
one	c
day	c
he	c
had	c
some	c
problems	c
...	c

His	c
best	c
friend	c
Paul	c
could	c
n't	c
put	c
up	c
anymore	c
with	c
Pat	c
always	c
revealing	c
his	c
secrets	c
,	c
so	c
decided	i
to	c
play	c
a	c
trick	c
on	c
him	c
.	c

Since	c
Paul	c
ran	c
a	c
very	c
popular	c
hotel	c
in	c
London	c
,	c
he	c
told	c
Pat	c
that	c
on	c
Sunday	c
the	c
superstar	c
Madonna	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
be	c
staying	c
there	c
with	c
her	c
new	c
misterious	i
lover	c
.	c

Paul	c
told	c
Pat	c
not	c
to	c
tell	c
anyone	c
about	c
Madonna	c
and	c
especially	c
to	i
the	c
press	c
.	c

Pat	c
obviously	c
could	c
n't	c
help	i
being	i
silent	c
about	c
this	c
so	c
,	c
since	c
he	c
also	c
needed	c
some	c
money	c
,	c
he	c
decided	c
to	c
reveal	c
everything	c
to	c
the	c
scandalistic	i
press	c
,	c
not	c
knowing	c
that	c
Paul	c
had	c
made	c
up	c
all	i
the	i
story	c
!	c

On	c
Sunday	c
all	c
the	c
english	i
press	c
was	i
waiting	c
for	c
Madonna	c
in	c
front	c
of	c
Paul	c
's	c
hotel	c
and	c
when	c
they	c
discovered	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
all	c
an	i
invention	i
,	c
they	c
got	c
so	c
angry	c
that	c
they	c
wrote	c
on	i
every	c
newspaper	c
that	c
Pat	c
had	c
made	c
up	c
everything	c
!	c

Paul	c
finally	c
had	c
his	c
revenge	c
!	c
!	c

Dear	c
Mr.	c
Smith	c

Firstly	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
how	c
disappointing	c
was	i
that	i
night	i
.	c

The	c
actors	c
I	c
saw	c
in	c
the	c
show	c
were	c
not	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
.	c

I	c
went	c
at	c
19.30	c
and	c
the	c
show	c
did	c
n't	c
begin	c
until	c
20:15	c
so	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
wait	c
a	c
lot	c
and	c
I	c
arrived	c
late	c
to	c
a	c
meeting	c
I	c
had	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

There	c
were	c
not	i
discounts	c
available	c
for	c
the	c
tickets	c
and	c
the	c
theatre	c
's	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
too	c
late	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

So	c
in	c
very	i
few	c
days	c
all	c
the	c
College	c
knew	c
that	c
me	c
and	c
my	c
friends	c
were	c
who	i
had	c
crashed	c
headmaster	i
's	c
car	c
.	c

The	c
headmaster	c
wanted	c
to	c
tell	c
the	c
police	c
what	c
we	c
had	c
done	c
so	c
we	c
decided	c
to	c
close	i
him	c
in	c
a	c
little	c
house	c
,	i
we	c
had	c
twenty	c
kilometers	i
far	i
from	c
the	c
village	c
until	c
we	c
could	c
change	c
his	c
opinion	i
.	c

We	c
put	c
him	c
in	c
my	c
car	c
and	c
we	c
left	c
him	c
inside	c
a	c
closed	c
room	c
.	c

He	c
accepted	c
and	i
we	c
left	i
him	c
free	i
.	c

We	c
need	i
to	c
do	c
something	c
like	c
that	c
to	c
make	c
him	c
change	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
only	c
in	c
July	c
,	c
because	c
in	c
June	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
study	c
at	c
school	c
which	i
has	i
n't	i
finished	i
until	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
June	c
.	c

In	i
August	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
already	c
made	c
another	c
appointment	c
with	c
my	c
friends	c
.	c

We	c
are	c
going	c
to	c
visit	c
the	c
places	c
of	c
interest	c
of	i
China	c
,	i
as	i
usual	c
,	c
our	c
new	c
term	c
begins	c
in	c
September	c
.	c

I	c
only	i
can	i
travel	c
in	c
July	c

Tents	c
are	c
very	c
easy	c
to	c
take	i
and	c
go	i
everywhere	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
good	c
at	c
singing	c
and	c
photography	c
.	c

I	c
like	c
taking	c
photograph	i
,	c
in	i
my	i
only	i
room	i
.	c

There	c
are	c
all	c
kinds	c
of	c
photos	c
,	c
for	c
example	c
,	c
beach	i
,	c
sea	c
trees	i
and	c
so	c
on	c
.	c

In	i
the	i
end	i
,	c
I	c
wonder	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
should	c
take	c
and	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
should	c
bring	c
with	c
me	c
.	i

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
seeing	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

The	c
aim	c
of	c

to	c
suggest	c
which	c
lessons	c
and	c
lessons	i

In	c
order	c
to	c
write	c
the	c
report	c
I	c
interviewed	c
about	c
one	c
hundred	c
students	c
who	c
are	c
studying	c
in	c
our	c
English	c
class	c
.	c

The	c

it	c
's	c
a	c

idea	c
to	c

something	c
about	c

Two	c
thirds	c

Although	c
Maths	c
is	c

it	c
is	c
very	c
important	c
in	i
nowadays	c

Conclusion	c
:	c

With	c
this	c
letter	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
show	i
you	i
some	c
problems	c
I	c
had	c
last	c
week	c
in	i
your	c
theatre	c
with	c
your	c
show	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
Francesco	c
Schein	c
,	c
I	c
'm	c
18	c
years	c
old	c
and	c
I	c
went	c
last	c
week	c
to	c
see	c
your	c
musical	c
show	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
upset	c
because	c
the	c
show	c
had	c
many	c
problems	c
.	c

First	c
the	c
actor	c
was	c
changed	c
and	c
his	c
performance	i
was	c
very	c
poor	c
and	c
disappointing	c
.	c

Then	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
began	c
45	c
minutes	c
later	i
,	c
so	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
wait	c
very	i
long	c
.	i

The	c
advertisement	c
said	c
there	c
were	c
discounts	c
available	c
,	c
which	c
were	c
not	c
.	i

At	i
the	i
end	i
you	c
said	c
it	i
will	i
be	i
a	c
Restaurant	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
,	c
so	c
we	c
could	c
n't	c
eat	c
anything	c
untill	i
we	c
got	c
home	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
understand	c
your	c
faults	i
and	c
I	c
'm	c
asking	c
you	c
for	c
the	i
money	c
back	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
if	c
technology	c
has	c
totally	c
changed	c
my	c
life	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
was	c
born	c
with	c
it	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
learned	c
it	i
since	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
little	c
boy	c
.	c

Many	c
industries	c
throw	c
their	c
contaminated	c
air	c
away	c
,	c
without	c
cleaning	c
it	c
before	i
.	c

Technology	c
has	c
to	c
move	c
further	c
so	c
it	c
can	c
solve	c
problems	c
as	i
pollution	c
,	c
so	c
we	c
can	c
live	c
better	c
and	c
longer	c
.	c

After	c
that	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
say	c
Thanks	c
,	c
I	c
never	i
have	i
won	c
any	c
price	i
at	c
all	c
.	c

Now	c
,	c
I	c
will	c
answer	c
your	c
requests	i
.	c

In	c
reference	c
about	i
the	c
date	c
of	c
the	i
travel	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
at	c
the	c
moment	c
I	c
am	c
working	c
at	c
the	i
University	c
and	c
I	c
only	c
have	c
July	c
to	c
take	c
my	c
holidays	c
.	c

As	c
state	i
in	c
your	c
letter	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
choose	c
the	c
accommodation	i
type	i
.	i

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
tents	i
because	c
since	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
child	c
I	c
have	c
being	i
using	c
this	c
type	c
of	c
accommodation	c
.	c

I	c
used	c
to	c
go	c
to	i
campings	i
.	c

About	c
camp	c
activities	c
I	i
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
do	c
basketball	c
and	c
photography	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
choosen	i
these	c
activities	c
because	c
actually	i
I	c
am	c
playing	c
with	i
university	i
team	c
,	c
and	c
photography	c
is	c
my	c
favoorate	i
hobby	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
recently	c
bought	c
a	c
new	c
camera	c
.	c

Is	c
necesarilly	i
bring	i
to	i
me	i
money	c
in	i
there	i
?	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Now	c
I	c
can	c
tell	c
you	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
an	c
amaizing	i
challange	i
for	c
me	c
because	c
I	c
never	i
did	i
anything	c
like	c
that	c
.	c

My	c
duties	c
like	i
a	c
organization	i
member	c
were	c
diferent	i
,	i
the	i
firts	i
day	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
pick	c
the	c
bands	c
up	c
at	i
the	c
airport	c
,	c
for	i
it	i
I	c
hired	c
a	c
van	c
.	c

The	c
following	c
day	c
I	c
was	c
the	c
person	c
who	c
provide	i
the	c
meals	c
for	c
all	c
the	c
organization	i
staff	c
and	c
besides	i
every	c
day	c
I	c
was	c
at	i
the	i
back-stage	i
supporting	c
the	c
catering	c
staff	c
.	c

Particularly	i
I	i
am	i
pleased	c
to	c
had	i
know	i
the	c
most	c
popular	c
pop	c
stars	c
in	c
the	c
world	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
bought	c
my	c
ticket	c
I	c
expected	c
to	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
take	c
advantage	c
of	c
those	c
discounts	c
you	c
announced	c
in	c
the	c
newspaper	c
advertisement	c
but	c
when	i
I	c
had	c
to	c
pay	c
the	c
most	c
expensive	c
price	c
.	c

I	c
went	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
performance	i
at	i
19:30	i
but	c
it	c
did	c
not	c
start	c
until	c
20:15	c
!	c

I	c
was	c
really	c
angry	c
but	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
see	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Now	c
Marion	c
was	c
really	c
angry	c
with	c
her	c
.	c

Some	c
days	c
ago	c
Pat	c
met	c
her	c
friend	c
Paul	c
,	c
the	c
editor	c
of	c
the	c
school	c
's	c
newspaper	c
.	c

Paul	c
asked	c
her	c
some	c
questions	c
about	c
her	c
childhood	c
and	c
her	c
toys	c
because	c
he	c
was	c
going	c
to	c
write	c
an	c
article	c
about	c
children	c
.	c

Then	c
Paul	c
asked	c
her	c
if	c
she	c
knew	c
something	c
about	c
Marion	c
's	c
childhood	c
.	c

But	c
,	c
suddenly	c
,	c
she	c
started	c
to	c
talk	c
about	c
Marion	c
's	c
toys	c
.	c

She	c
told	c
Paul	c
she	c
had	c
a	c
special	c
toy	c
called	c
Max	c
and	c
that	c
she	c
slept	c
with	c
him	c
.	c

A	c
terrible	c
mistake	c
!	c

Everybody	c
laughted	i
at	c
her	c
.	c

Marion	c
felt	c
really	c
embarrassed	c
.	c

Two	c
weeks	c
later	c
everybody	c
forbade	i
about	c
Marion	c
's	c
secret	c
and	c
she	c
took	i
into	i
account	i
her	c
relationship	c
with	c
Pat	c
.	c

They	c
became	c
friends	c
again	c
.	c

But	c
Marion	c
would	c
never	c
tell	c
Pat	c
a	c
secret	c
again	c
!	c
!	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
only	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
I	c
will	c
take	i
some	c
hollydays	i
at	c
this	i
time	c
.	c

I	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
log	c
cabins	c
than	i
in	c
tentes	i
,	c
because	c
log	c
cabins	c
has	i
much	i
esctructure	i
,	c
that	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
stay	c
for	c
a	c
few	c
days	c
.	c

.	c

I	c
can	c
play	c
well	i
basketball	i
,	c
because	c
I	c
use	i
to	i
practice	i
basketball	c
,	c
when	c
I	c
go	i
to	c
the	c
club	c
every	c
Saturday	c
.	c

Now	c
I	c
am	c
planning	c
to	c
be	c
a	c
good	c
photographer	c
.	c

I	c
will	c
use	c
some	c
photographs	c
to	c
put	c
in	i
one	i
website	c
,	i
that	c
belongs	c
of	i
one	i
magazine	c
,	c
that	i
I	c
had	c
projected	c
.	c

.	c

Last	c
month	c
,	c
I	c
work	i
like	i
roadie	i
at	c
Rolling	i
Stones	c
Pop	i
Concert	i
,	i
I	c
was	c
responsable	i
of	i
sound	i
that	i
comes	i
from	i
the	i
stage	i
.	c

Now	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
some	c
experience	c
to	i
produce	i
CDs	i
alive	i
of	c
famous	c
band	i
,	c
that	i
would	c
like	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
.	c

Dear	c
Madam	c
,	c

If	c
it	c
is	c
possible	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
.	c

I	c
will	c
be	c
working	c
until	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
June	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
going	c
to	c
start	c
university	c
in	c
August	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
sleep	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
,	c
because	c
,	c
in	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
easier	c
to	c
make	c
friends	c
and	c
I	c
like	c
camping	c
as	c
well	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
chosen	c
photography	c
and	c
climbing	c
for	i
activities	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
a	c
beginner	c
in	c
photography	c
but	c
I	c
am	c
really	c
interested	c
in	c
.	i

I	c
have	c
a	c
medium	c
level	c
in	i
climbing	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
climb	c
the	c
Californian	c
mountains	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

I	c
like	c
shopping	c
.	c

Some	c
people	c
when	c
they	c
are	c
tired	c
relax	c
spleeping	i
,	c
reading	c
a	c
book	c
or	c
watching	c
television	c
but	i
not	c
me	c
.	c

However	c
it	i
is	c
true	c
that	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
for	i
example	c
before	c
Christmas	c
or	c
during	c
some	c
special	c
salles	i
.	c

In	c
these	c
periods	c
of	c
the	c
year	c
,	c
the	c
supermarkets	c
and	c
the	c
shops	c
are	c
full	c
of	c
stressed	c
adults	c
and	c
tired	c
children	c
trying	i
to	i
walk	i
in	c
a	c
warm	i
and	c
noisy	c
place	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
the	c
actor	c
who	c
played	c
was	i
not	c
the	c
same	c
one	c
that	c
I	c
read	c
in	i
the	c
advertisement	c
.	c

Secontly	i
,	c
the	c
musical	i
show	c
began	c
fourty-five	i
minutes	c
later	i
and	c
nobody	c
explained	i
me	c
what	c
was	i
happened	c
.	c

Thirdly	c
,	c
I	c
did	c
not	c
receive	i
any	c
kind	c
of	c
discounts	i
when	c
I	c
payed	i
although	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
it	c
was	c
written	c
.	i

After	c
the	c
musical	i
show	c
,	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
but	c
I	c
could	c
not	c
have	i
had	i
dinner	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
if	c
the	c
musical	i
show	c
will	i
begin	i
later	c
the	c
restaurant	c
should	c
close	c
later	c
,	c
too	c
!	c

Finally	c
,	c
from	i
my	i
point	i
of	i
view	i
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
receive	i
the	c
money	c
that	c
I	c
payed	i
because	c
it	i
was	c
not	c
the	i
same	i
as	i
you	c
offered	i
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
when	c
you	c
explain	i
a	c
secret	c
you	c
must	c
be	c
sure	c
that	c
you	c
have	c
chose	i
the	c
best	c
person	c
to	c
keep	c
it	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
child	c
my	c
friends	c
were	c
my	c
companions	i
of	i
class	i
and	i
,	c
especially	c
my	c
neighbours	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
was	c
fourteen	c
years	c
old	c
some	c
things	c
changed	c
.	c

I	c
prefered	i
going	i
by	i
motorbike	c
with	c
the	c
people	c
who	c
studyied	i
with	c
me	c
in	c
the	c
Institute	c
.	c

But	c
,	c
until	c
you	c
are	c
twenty	c
years	c
old	c
you	c
choose	c
your	c
best	c
friends	c
.	c

You	c
have	c
an	i
experience	i
to	c
know	i
people	c
and	c
now	c
you	c
have	c
an	c
opportunaty	i
to	c
select	c
good	c
friends	c
.	c

For	c
theses	i
reasons	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
you	c
should	c
know	c
well	i
the	i
person	i
who	i
wants	i
to	c
explain	i
a	c
secret	c
and	i
keep	i
it	c
.	c

Dear	c
Manager	c
,	c

I	c
found	c
the	c
advertisement	c
about	c
this	c
show	c
in	c
a	c
newspaper	c
and	c
thought	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
fun	c
.	c

The	c
show	c
should	c
start	i
at	c
19.30	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
did	c
n't	c
start	c
until	c
20.15	c
!	c

I	c
'm	c
really	c
upset	c
and	c
disappointed	c
after	c
all	c
this	c
and	c
at	i
least	i
I	i
want	i
my	c
money	c
back	c
!	c

It	c
could	c
have	c
been	c
a	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
!	c

yours	c
sincerely	c

How	c
has	c
modern	c
technology	c
changed	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
?	c

For	c
example	c
TV	i
,	c
telephone	c
,	c
micrown	i
etc.	c
But	c
the	i
last	c
few	c
years	c
,	c
it	i
has	c
change	i
and	c
so	c
many	c
new	c
important	c
things	c
had	i
been	c
discovered	i
.	c

I	c
tought	i
I	c
would	c
never	c
need	c
a	c
mobile	c
phone	c
,	c
but	c
my	c
mum	c
and	c
dad	c
gave	c
me	c
one	c
for	c
Christmas	c
last	c
year	c
and	c
now	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
live	c
without	c
it	c
!	c

But	c
the	c
discovery	i
that	c
I	c
'm	c
most	c
thankful	c
to	i
is	c
the	c
computor	i
and	c
the	c
Internet	c
!	c

So	c
,	c
I	c
start	c
every	c
day	c
,	i
swiching	i
on	c
my	c
mobile	c
phone	c
,	c
to	c
see	c
if	c
there	c
are	c
any	c
more	c
SMS	c
messages	c
before	c
I	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
library	c
to	c
check	c
my	c
e-mail	c
and	c
that	c
's	c
just	c
the	c
begining	i
of	c
the	c
day	c
...	c

Last	c
month	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
with	c
my	c
husband	c
to	c
see	c
OVER	c
THE	c
RAINBOW	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
sorry	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
very	c
unpleasant	c
evening	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
the	c
play	c
started	c
45	c
minutes	c
later	i
.	c

I	c
felt	c
so	c
angry	c
about	c
that	c
.	c

And	c
discounts	c
were	c
not	c
available	c
(	c
nobody	c
explained	c
the	c
reason	c
)	i
.	c

I	c
wanted	c
to	c
see	c
him	c
!	c

And	c
we	c
could	c
n't	c
visit	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

Such	c
a	c
bad	c
night	c
!	c

I	c
'm	c
sure	c
you	c
will	c
complain	i
the	c
reasons	c
why	c
I	c
want	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

And	c
Lorca	c
knew	c
it	c
.	c

But	c
Pat	c
was	c
in	c
the	i
wrong	i
place	i
in	i
the	i
incorrect	i
hour	i
.	c

That	i
's	i
a	c
story	c
of	c
a	c
crime	c
of	c
passion	c
.	c

Her	c
family	c
was	c
very	c
rich	c
and	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
men	c
wanted	c
to	c
marry	c
to	c
her	c
.	c

But	c
she	c
was	c
in	c
love	c
with	c
a	c
black	c
man	c
,	c
called	c
Jim	c
.	c

And	c
Pat	c
,	c
the	c
maid	c
,	c
saw	c
them	c
in	c
the	c
river	c
.	c

Then	c
,	c
she	c
cried	c
and	c
cried	c
holding	i
him	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
shock	c
for	c
Lorca	c
.	c

She	c
jumped	c
into	c
the	c
river	c
and	c
killed	c
herself	c
two	c
days	c
after	i
.	c

Pat	c
and	c
Jim	c
's	c
wife	c
lived	c
with	c
the	c
guilty	i
all	c
their	c
long	c
lives	c
.	c

How	c
could	c
they	c
forget	c
it	c
?	c

Dear	c
Mrs.	c
Ryan	c
:	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
golf	c
and	c
surfing	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
n't	c
played	c
golf	c
for	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
,	c
so	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
pleasent	i
to	c
do	c
so	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
been	c
surfing	c
for	c
five	c
years	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
competed	c
in	c
two	c
championships	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
never	c
been	c
to	c
California	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
have	c
no	c
idea	c
about	c
the	c
weather	c
there	c
.	c

Also	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
if	c
I	c
will	c
need	c
any	c
money	c
there	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
:	c

Hi	c
!	c

It	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
start	c
at	c
ten	c
,	c
but	c
when	c
the	c
band	c
was	c
going	c
on	c
stage	c
,	c
the	c
leader	i
of	i
it	i
fell	c
down	c
on	c
some	c
wires	c
that	c
gave	c
the	c
power	c
to	c
all	c
the	c
instruments	c
and	c
all	c
the	c
lights	c
!	c

Suddenly	c
,	c
everything	c
got	c
very	c
dark	c
.	c

The	c
fans	c
started	c
shouting	c
and	c
wistling	i
for	c
the	c
show	c
to	c
begin	c
,	c
while	c
I	c
just	c
stood	c
there	c
trying	c
to	c
see	c
what	c
had	c
happened	c
.	c

I	c
happened	c
to	c
be	c
near	c
him	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
help	c
him	c
.	c

I	c
realised	c
he	c
had	c
broken	c
a	c
finger	c
so	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
get	c
a	c
doctor	c
to	c
help	c
him	c
.	c

Like	i
an	c
hour	c
later	c
,	c
he	c
recovered	c
and	c
the	c
show	c
began	c
.	c

Dear	c
Manager	c
of	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
regarding	c
to	i
our	c
visit	c
to	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
the	i
17th	c
June	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
was	c
not	c
acting	c
,	c
there	c
was	c
another	c
unknown	i
actor	c
and	c
he	c
was	c
not	c
good	c
.	c

Above	i
these	i
the	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
of	c
water	i
leakage	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
therefore	c
asking	c
for	c
a	i
compensation	c
for	c
our	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
and	c
hope	c
we	c
can	c
reach	c
a	c
sollution	i
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c
.	c

Adra	c
Johansson	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

It	c
did	c
n't	c
take	c
more	c
than	c
one	c
day	c
before	c
everyone	c
knew	c
about	c
my	c
decision	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
thought	c
about	c
it	c
for	c
many	c
years	c
but	c
never	c
been	c
able	c
to	c
fulfill	i
my	c
dreams	c
.	c

Pat	c
is	i
my	c
best	c
friend	c
,	i
since	c
we	c
first	c
met	c
in	c
primary	c
school	c
.	c

It	i
is	c
now	c
twenty	c
years	c
ago	c
.	c

I	c
really	c
like	c
Pat	c
,	c
she	c
's	c
funny	c
,	c
has	c
a	c
good	c
sence	i
of	c
humor	i
and	c
like	c
me	c
she	c
loves	c
to	c
discuss	c
everything	c
.	c

So	c
therefore	c
,	c
my	c
choise	i
to	c
ask	c
her	c
about	c
my	c
decision	c
was	c
the	c
best	c
I	i
could	c
do	c
.	c

She	c
really	c
listen	i
to	c
me	c
and	c
told	c
me	c
that	c
I	c
did	i
the	c
right	c
thing	c
and	c
persuaded	c
me	c
to	c
send	c
in	c
my	c
application	c
for	i
an	i
language	c
course	c
in	c
England	c
.	c

But	c
it	c
is	c
ok	i
,	c
I	c
still	c
like	c
Pat	c
,	c
even	c
though	c
she	c
ca	c
n't	c
keep	c
a	c
secret	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
I	c
would	c

to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
is	i
my	c
free	i
month	c
since	i
I	c
am	c
student	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
busy	c
during	i
all	c
year	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
according	i
to	i
accommodation	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
long	i
cabin	c
,	c
due	i
to	i
I	c
used	c
to	c
use	c
the	i
tent	c
on	c
holiday	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
n't	c
got	i
very	i
good	i
experiences	i
.	c

Thirdly	c
I	c
chose	c
photography	c
and	c
swimming	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
previous	c
experience	c
in	c
these	c
activities	c
and	c
of	c
course	c
I	c
have	c
some	c
diplomas	c
which	c
I	c
will	c
send	c
you	c
.	c

Apart	c
from	c
this	c
photography	i
is	c
one	c
of	c
my	c
favorite	i
hobbies	c
and	c
I	c
usually	c
spent	i
nearly	c
all	c
my	c
spare	c
time	c
practising	i
it	c
and	c
of	c
course	c
I	c
have	c
some	c
diplomas	c
as	c
well	c
.	c

On	i
the	i
one	i
hand	i
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
have	c
further	c
information	c
about	c
which	i
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
need	c
for	c
that	c
area	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
if	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
bring	c
only	c
light	c
clothes	c
or	c
both	c
.	i

On	i
the	i
other	i
hand	i
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
request	c
all	i
details	i
of	i
accommodation	c
and	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
specifie	i
what	c
this	c
trip	c
includes	c
,	c
since	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
know	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
receiving	c
a	c
prompt	c
reply	c
.	c

I	c
found	c
this	c
opportunity	c
through	c
the	c
Radio	c
in	c
an	c
advertisement	c
.	c

But	c
later	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
call	c
them	c
and	c
ask	c
them	c
for	c
further	c
information	c
about	c
this	c
job	c
.	c

According	i
to	i
my	i
job	i
,	i
I	c
had	c
to	c
help	c
the	c
teams	c
with	c
the	c
outlights	c
and	c
of	i
course	c
it	i
had	i
been	i
my	c
first	c
proffesional	i
experience	c
:	c
at	i
the	i
end	i
I	c
felt	c
a	i
member	i
of	c
them	c
,	c
because	c
they	c
were	c
so	c
kind	c
to	c
me	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
could	c
colaborated	i
a	c
lot	c
of	i
and	c
I	c
learnt	c
a	c
lot	c
with	c
this	c
project	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
I	c
found	c
it	i
very	i
short	i
time	i
and	c
they	c
offered	c
me	c
new	i
project	c
for	c
the	c
summer	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
to	c
hear	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

My	c
name	c
is	c
Lisa	c
and	c
I	c
'm	c
21	c
years	c
old	c
.	c

I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
last	c
Friday	c
to	c
see	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
and	c
I	c
felt	c
disappointed	c
about	c
the	c
musical	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
really	c
like	c
to	c
see	c
a	c
new	c
one	c
such	c
as	c
Markin	c
Davis	c
,	c
he	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
actor	c
and	c
he	c
would	c
fit	c
well	c
this	i
musical	c
.	c

Then	c
I	c
was	c
sitted	i
with	c
my	c
friend	c
just	c
waiting	c
for	c
the	c
start	c
that	i
lasted	c
forever	c
and	c
was	i
supposed	c
to	c
start	c
at	c
19:30	c
.	c

By	c
the	i
time	c
I	c
thought	c
:	c
"	c
I	c
want	c
my	c
money	c
back.	c
"	c

That	i
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
be	c
a	c
perfect	c
evening	c
turned	c
out	c
to	c
be	c
the	c
most	c
hateful	c
musical	c
I	c
've	c
ever	c
seen	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

Despite	c
the	c
fact	c
that	c
she	c
was	c
my	c
best	c
friend	c
I	c
could	c
never	c
count	c
on	c
her	c
or	c
she	c
would	c
tell	c
everybody	c
in	c
high	c
school	c
all	c
my	c
secrets	c
.	c

Then	c
I	c
told	c
her	c
about	c
my	c
first	c
kiss	c
(	c
it	c
was	c
terrible	c
,	c
the	c
guy	c
did	c
n't	c
know	c
how	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
)	c
and	c
things	c
like	c
that	c
.	c

The	c
next	c
morning	c
when	c
I	c
got	c
to	c
the	c
high	c
school	c
I	c
heard	c
what	c
I	c
was	c
n't	c
expecting	c
,	c
Pat	c
had	c
told	c
everybody	c
about	c
my	c
first	c
experience	c
in	i
kissing	c
.	c

People	c
would	i
be	i
starring	i
at	c
me	c
and	c
laughing	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
tell	c
her	c
my	c
secrets	c
anymore	c
.	c

The	c
most	c
suitable	c
time	c
for	c
this	c
trip	c
is	c
only	c
in	c
July	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
've	c
planned	i
already	i
the	c
rest	c
of	c
my	c
summer	c
holidays	c
.	c

On	i
June	c
and	c
August	c
,	c
so	c
that	c
's	c
the	c
only	c
time	c
when	c
I	c
can	c
travel	c
there	c
.	c

I	c
prefer	c
that	c
kind	c
of	c
accomodation	i
because	c
I	c
can	c
have	c
a	c
kitchen	c
or	c
even	c
a	c
bathroom	c
there	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
have	c
it	c
in	c
tent	i
.	c

I	c
've	c
also	c
choosed	i
two	c
activities	c
,	c
swimming	c
and	c
sailing	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c

I	c
agree	c
with	c
this	c
statement	c
especially	c
when	c
we	c
talk	c
about	c
small	c
shop	i
in	c
the	c
center	i
of	c
a	c
big	c
town	c
.	c

These	c
shops	c
are	c
usually	c
very	c
crowded	c
and	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
wait	c
for	c
a	c
very	c
long	c
time	c
to	c
buy	c
one	c
kilogram	c
of	c
carrots	c
for	c
example	c
.	c

In	c
such	c
a	i
shops	c
there	c
is	c
usually	c
one	c
or	c
one	c
or	c
two	c
sellers	i
,	c
what	i
is	c
not	c
enough	c
when	c
a	c
shop	c
is	c
full	c
of	c
people	c
.	c

That	c
's	c
a	c
place	c
where	c
you	c
lose	c
too	c
much	c
of	i
time	c
and	c
health	c
.	c

Shopping	c
is	c
more	c
enjoyable	c
if	c
you	c
go	c
to	c
a	c
big	c
supermarket	c
,	c
because	c
there	c
is	i
smaller	c
crowd	i
and	c
more	c
sellers	i
work	c
there	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
not	c
used	c
to	c
sleeping	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
,	c
so	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
very	c
difficult	c
for	c
me	c
.	i

at	c
the	c
beginning	c
You	i
state	c
in	c
your	c
last	c
letter	c
that	c
I	c
will	c
have	c
the	c
chance	c
to	c
do	c
two	c
activities	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
basketball	c
and	c
swimming	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
also	c
good	c
at	c
swimming	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
there	c
is	c
one	c
think	i
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
.	c

Could	c
you	c
tell	c
me	c
what	c
sort	c
of	c
clothes	c
and	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
should	c
have	c
with	c
me	c
?	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

Many	c
thanks	c
for	c
your	c
last	c
letter	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
great	c
to	c
hear	c
from	c
you	c
again	c
.	c

and	c
I	c
must	c
say	c
it	c
was	c
fantastic	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
prepare	c
the	c
clothes	c
of	c
the	c
pop	c
stars	c
.	c

and	c
handsome	c
.	c

The	c
most	c
exciting	c
things	c
happened	c
later	c
.	c

I	c
saw	c
all	c
the	c
pop	c
stars	c
,	c
talked	c
with	c
them	c
and	c
realized	c
that	c
they	c
are	c
very	c
nice	c
and	c
always	c
helpful	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
to	c
look	c
after	c
the	c
tone	i
that	i
nothing	i
goes	i
wrong	i
.	c

That	c
was	c
very	c
responsible	i
but	c
fortunately	c
I	c
had	c
help	c
from	c
other	i
person	c
.	c

I	c
must	c
say	c
that	c
being	c
in	i
a	c
concert	c
is	c
very	c
nice	c
.	c

But	c
helping	c
in	i
a	c
concert	c
is	c
much	c
nicer	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
was	i
very	c
glad	c
I	c
won	c
the	c
competition	c
.	c

As	c
far	c
as	c
the	c
dates	i
of	i
travelling	i
are	c
concerned	c
,	c
the	c
only	c
period	c
available	c
would	c
be	c
in	c
July	c
as	c
I	c
am	c
fully	c
booked	c
for	c
the	c
remaining	i
summer	i
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
nice	c
to	c
try	c
it	c
at	c
least	c
once	c
.	c

The	c
only	c
problem	c
would	c
be	c
that	c
my	c
drawing	c
is	c
pretty	c
bad	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

As	c
you	c
asked	c
me	c
,	c
I	c
write	i
you	i
about	c
my	c
experience	c
at	c
the	c
Pop	i
Concert	i
.	c

Well	c
,	c
on	c
the	c
whole	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
pretty	c
cool	c
.	c

The	c
only	c
thing	c
I	c
was	c
asked	c
to	c
do	c
was	c
to	c
help	c
carry	c
the	c
lunches	c
of	c
the	c
singers	c
and	c
to	c
help	c
with	c
light	c
and	c
sound	c
management	c
,	c
when	c
the	c
guy	c
there	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
something	c
else	c
.	c

The	c
woman	c
had	c
to	c
deliver	c
something	c
.	c

But	c
,	c
as	c
I	c
said	c
,	c
the	c
whole	c
thing	c
was	c
fun	c
.	c

That	c
was	c
my	c
best	c
day	c
ever	c
,	c
the	c
one	c
I	i
shared	c
a	c
meal	c
with	c
Paul	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
!	i

That	c
's	c
why	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
only	c
in	c
July	c
.	c

I	c
prefer	c
to	c
live	i
in	c
log	i
cabin	c
because	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
's	c
more	c
comfortable	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
's	c
very	i
usefull	i
and	c
helpful	c
thing	c
for	c
my	c
health	c
especially	i
when	c
I	c
do	c
it	c
with	c
pleasure	c
.	c

The	c
second	c
my	i
favorit	i
sport	i
is	c
tennis	c
.	c

I	c
've	c
played	c
tennis	c
for	c
ten	c
years	c
I	i
'm	c
a	c
profesional	i
and	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
be	c
good	c
at	c
it	c
,	c
in	i
any	i
time	c
.	c

I	c
want	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
about	c
money	c
.	c

How	c
much	c
money	c
I	i
need	c
and	c
if	i
I	c
have	c
to	c
have	c
them	i
in	c
cash	c
or	c
I	i
can	i
use	c
a	c
credit	c
card	c
.	i

Could	c
you	c
let	c
me	c
know	c
about	c
the	c
weather	c
because	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
should	c
take	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c

Petrov	c

I	c
'm	c
fine	i
soon	i
I	c
'll	c
have	c
my	c
holiday	c
and	c
I	c
look	c
forward	c
for	i
them	i
but	c
now	c
I	c
have	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
exams	c
and	c
if	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
pass	c
them	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
learn	c
a	c
lot	c
.	c

Now	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
about	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	i
as	i
you	c
have	i
already	i
knowen	i
I	c
helped	c
my	c
father	c
to	c
organize	c
this	c
concert	c
.	c

Sometimes	c
I	c
gave	c
some	c
advices	i
about	c
suits	c
and	c
dresses	c
.	c

Often	c
we	c
looked	i
repetitions	i
and	c
if	c
something	c
did	c
n't	c
like	i
us	c
we	c
tried	c
to	c
correct	c
it	c
.	c

The	c
most	c
enjoable	i
thing	c
was	c
to	c
smart	i
people	c
.	c

We	c
have	c
a	c
good	c
and	c
rich	c
sponsor	c
,	i
that	i
's	i
why	c
we	c
could	c
buy	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
different	c
materials	c
with	c
different	c
colours	c
and	c
we	c
tried	c
to	c
be	c
polite	c
with	c
actors	c
even	c
if	c
they	c
did	c
n't	c
want	c
to	c
wear	c
that	c
part	i
of	c
cloth	i
which	c
we	c
thought	c
was	c
more	i
similar	i
to	i
their	c
style	c
.	c

But	c
when	c
we	c
saw	c
our	c
show	c
and	c
heard	c
how	c
loud	i
audience	i
claped	i
them	c
we	c
were	c
proud	c
and	c
understood	c
that	c
we	c
spent	i
a	i
good	i
time	i
.	c

You	c
should	c
try	c
it	c
and	c
feel	i
.	c

Best	c
wishes	c

I	c
'm	c
writting	i
to	c
you	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
musical	c
show	i
that	c
I	c
saw	c
when	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
on	i
my	c
holidays	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

There	c
was	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
instead	c
and	c
it	c
put	i
me	c
very	c
nervous	i
.	c

Finally	c
at	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
the	c
sow	i
I	c
decided	c
to	c
went	i
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
it	c
was	i
n't	i
been	c
repeard	i
yet	i
.	c

I	c
think	c
you	c
must	i
told	c
people	c
about	c
this	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
a	c
bit	c
disappointed	c
because	c
you	c
told	i
that	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
perfect	c
evening	c
and	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
.	c

I	c
enclose	c
my	c
postal	c
addresses	c
and	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
a	c
completly	i
refound	i

Fashion	c
of	c
the	c
Future	c

We	i
could	i
see	i
all	i
over	i
the	i
human	i
being	i
How	c
the	i
fashion	c
change	i
in	c
its	c
colours	c
and	c
styles	c
,	c
Since	c
the	c
first	c
men	c
on	c
the	c
earth	c
started	c
to	c
wear	c
kind	i
of	c
clothes	c
because	c
they	c
were	c
a	c
bit	c
cold	c

Adults	c
think	c
that	c
new	i
coloured	c
clothes	c
,	i
that	c
young	c
people	c
wear	c
are	c
horrible	c
an	i
very	c
untraditional	c
.	c

They	c
think	c
that	c
in	c

Dear	c
Mrs.	c
Ryan	c
,	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
happy	c
to	c
be	c
the	c
winner	c
of	c
the	c
competition	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
come	i
to	c
Camp	c
California	c
.	c

As	c
far	c
as	c
accommodation	c
is	c
concerned	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
,	c
because	c
tents	c
are	c
too	c
hot	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
also	c
pleased	c
to	c
have	c
the	c
chance	c
to	c
do	c
some	c
activities	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
choose	c
something	c
I	c
am	c
not	c
able	c
to	c
do	c
so	i
.	c

So	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
decided	c
to	c
chose	i
photography	c
and	c
surfing	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
an	c
absolute	c
beginner	c
at	c
both	c
of	c
them	c
.	c

It	c
would	c
be	i
also	i
useful	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
know	c
if	c
there	c
will	c
be	c
some	i
extra	c
expenses	c
,	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
take	c
enough	c
money	c
for	c
two	c
weeks	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

The	c
first	c
one	c
is	c
the	c
Christmas	c
period	c
.	c

Shops	c
are	c
incredibly	c
crowded	c
.	c

You	c
cannot	c
try	c
on	c
a	c
dress	c
and	c
decide	c
to	c
buy	c
it	c
or	i
not	c
in	c
peace	c
,	c
because	c
outside	c
there	c
is	c
a	c
queue	c
of	c
people	c
waiting	c
for	c
their	c
turn	c
.	c

In	c
many	c
cases	c
,	c
you	c
do	c
not	c
even	c
find	c
the	c
things	c
you	c
want	c
,	c
because	c
shops	i
run	c
out	c
of	c
products	c
very	c
quickly	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
during	c
this	c
period	c
,	c
prices	c
are	c
usually	c
much	c
higher	c
than	c
in	c
the	c
other	c
month	i
's	i
.	c

For	c
the	c
majority	c
of	c
men	c
,	c
in	c
fact	c
,	c
shopping	c
is	c
the	c
most	c
boring	c
activity	c
in	c
the	c
world	c
.	c

Anyway	c
,	c
apart	c
from	c
these	c
two	c
cases	c
,	c
shopping	c
is	c
always	c
very	c
amusing	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
recently	c
been	c
in	i
London	c
for	c
spending	i
a	c
week	c
's	c
holiday	c
.	c

As	c
I	c
am	c
an	i
enthusiasmic	i
of	c
musicals	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
see	c
this	c
musical	i
show	c
.	c

I	c
felt	c
abosolutly	i
disapointed	i
.	c

The	c
musical	c
should	c
have	c
begun	c
at	c
19:30	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
;	c
it	i
is	c
inacceptable	i
!	c

After	c
the	c
show	c
me	c
and	c
my	c
friends	c
wanted	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
drink	c
and	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
there	c
were	c
n't	c
enough	c
drinks	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Modern	c
technology	c
has	c
changed	c
a	i
lot	i
our	i
daily	i
life	i
.	c

On	i
one	i
hand	i
nowadays	i
if	c
we	c
have	c
to	c
travel	c
to	c
Paris	c
and	c
return	c
in	i
the	c
same	c
day	c
you	c
can	c
take	c
a	c
plane	c
without	c
any	c
problem	c
.	c

Another	c
advantage	c
is	c
that	c
if	c
you	c
go	c
on	c
an	c
excursion	c
and	c
you	c
take	c
your	c
mobile	c
phone	c
,	c
if	c
you	c
get	c
lost	c
somebody	c
could	i
find	c
you	c
.	c

With	c
internet	i
you	c
can	c
do	c
whatever	c
you	c
want	c
without	c
going	c
out	c
home	i
(	c
shoping	i
,	c
speaking	c
with	c
a	c
friend	c
,	c
working	c
,	c
putting	c
your	c
money	c
aside	c
....	c
)	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
the	i
main	c
disadvantage	c
is	c
that	c
using	c
modern	c
machines	c
it	i
can	c
be	c
very	c
difficult	c
for	c
ederly	i
people	c
;	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
very	c
pratitable	i
if	c
the	c
modern	c
industries	c
train	i
people	c
about	i
using	i
modern	c
technologies	c
.	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
modern	i
technology	c
has	c
change	i
a	i
lot	i
our	i
daily	i
life	i
and	c
this	c
is	c
going	c
to	c
increase	i
.	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
back	i
to	c
tell	c
you	c
that	c
I	c
am	c
happy	c
to	c
accept	c
this	c
prize	c
and	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
some	c
further	c
information	c
that	c
you	c
need	c
from	c
me	c
.	c

If	c
it	c
's	c
possible	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
on	i
July	c
because	c
of	c
my	c
job	c
.	c

As	c
I	c
see	c
I	c
have	c
the	c
chance	c
to	c
choose	c
what	i
accommodation	c
I	c
prefer	c
.	i

I	c
also	c
think	c
that	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
great	c
to	c
learn	c
photography	i
because	c
it	c
will	c
give	c
me	c
the	c
chance	c
to	c
go	c
sightseeing	c
and	c
find	c
wonderful	c
places	c
to	c
take	c
pictures	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
mind	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
are	c
apropriate	i
for	c
the	c
camp	c
and	c
for	c
the	c
weather	i
of	i
California	i
.	c

And	c
also	c
may	i
I	c
have	c
to	c
bring	c
money	i
?	c
because	i
I	c
know	c
that	c
all	c
the	c
costs	i
are	c
paid	c
but	c
it	c
could	c
be	c
necessary	c
for	c
other	c
things	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

I	c
completely	c
agree	c
with	c
the	c
following	c
statement	c
:	c

"	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
"	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
we	i
usually	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
shops	c
at	c
the	c
same	c
time	c
than	i
the	c
rest	c
of	c
the	c
world	c
and	c
that	c
's	c
a	c
little	c
bit	c
complicated	c
because	c
the	c
shops	c
are	c
fulled	i
and	c
it	c
's	c
impossible	c
to	i
try	i
acurately	i
.	c

Secondly	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
thank	i
before	c
you	c
come	i
in	i
a	c
shop	c
if	c
you	c
're	c
going	c
to	c
have	c
luck	i
.	c

At	i
last	i
but	i
not	i
at	i
least	i
let	c
me	c
give	c
you	c
some	c
advice	c
try	i
not	c
to	c
go	c
with	c
that	c
friend	c
of	c
yours	c
that	i
is	c
crazy	c
about	c
clothes	c
and	c
shoes	c
because	c
she	c
wants	c
you	c
to	c
be	c
like	c
her	c
and	c
that	c
will	i
be	c
awful	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
California	c
in	c
the	c
U.S.A.	c
in	c
July	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
the	c
only	c
month	c
that	c
I	c
can	c
have	c
my	c
holiday	c
in	i
a	i
year	c
and	c
it	c
would	i
be	c
nice	c
in	c
the	c
summer	i
time	i
.	c

About	i
the	c
accommodation	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
,	c
I	c
prefer	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
.	c

It	c
would	c
be	c
nice	i
and	i
safe	i
for	c
me	c
than	c
the	c
tents	c
.	c

It	c
could	c
be	c
fun	c
for	c
me	c
because	c
I	c
like	c
swimming	c
and	i
sailing	c
could	c
be	c
exciting	c
too	c
.	c

How	c
about	c
the	c
weather	c
in	c
California	c
in	c
July	c
?	c

Is	c
it	c
hot	c
or	c
raining	c
?	c

Then	i
I	i
can	i
prepare	i
my	c
clothes	c
,	c
or	c
can	c
we	c
buy	c
some	c
clothes	c
there	c
?	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
want	c
to	c
take	c
money	c
with	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
be	c
greatful	i
if	c
you	c
could	c
send	c
me	c
the	c
full	c
details	c
.	c

Many	c
thanks	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

In	c
the	c
following	c
paragraps	i
I	c
will	c
discuss	c
the	c
advantages	c
and	c
disadvantages	c
about	i
shopping	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
very	i
important	c
thing	c
for	c
our	c
life	c
.	c

We	c
could	c
buy	c
mostly	i
all	c
we	c
need	c
in	c
one	c
store	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
very	c
convenien	i
.	c

Sometime	i
,	c
it	i
's	i
so	c
many	c
people	c
and	c
they	c
are	c
not	c
friendly	c
at	c
all	c
or	c
you	c
are	c
hurry	i
while	c
you	c
are	c
in	c
the	i
long	c
queu	i
.	c

We	c
have	c
seen	c
then	c
,	i
shopping	i
is	c
very	c
important	c
for	c
our	c
life	c
.	c

It	c
would	c
not	c
enjoyable	i
for	c
you	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c
With	c
reference	c
to	c
your	c
advertisment	i
regarding	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
"	c
I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
with	i
the	c
intention	c
to	i
give	i
you	c
an	c
impression	c
of	c
our	c
experiences	c
visiting	i
the	c
above	i
mentioned	i
show	c
.	c

We	c
were	c
disappointed	c
to	c
realize	c
that	c
not	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
but	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
played	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
main	c
characters	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
there	c
was	c
an	c
unexplained	c
delay	c
of	c
45	c
minutes	c
.	c

What	c
made	c
the	c
situation	c
worse	c
is	c
that	c
no	c
explanation	c
for	c
the	c
delay	c
was	c
given	c
;	c
not	c
even	c
an	c
apologation	i
.	c

After	c
the	c
show	c
we	c
had	c
intended	c
to	c
visit	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
which	i
was	c
-	c
to	c
our	c
surprise	c
-	c
closed	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
time	i
delay	c
!	c

Honestly	c
for	c
us	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
that	c
"	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
"	c
.	c

We	c
are	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c

"	c
The	c
old	c

and	c
the	c
Sea	c
"	c

Dear	c
Tim	c
,	c

I	c
recommend	c
you	c
listen	c
to	c
it	c
!	c

As	c
you	c
know	c
we	c
have	c
already	c
had	c
several	c
discussions	c
about	c
literature	c
and	c
what	c
it	c
can	c
tell	c
or	c
teach	c
us	c
.	c

Therefore	c
Hemingway	c
is	c
a	c
very	c
good	c
example	c
.	c

He	c
fought	c
in	c
the	c
Spanish	c
Civil	c
war	c
and	c
in	c
World	c
War	c
II	c
always	i
on	i
the	i
search	i
for	i
answers	c
to	c
questions	c
like	c
"	c
...	c
what	c
defines	c
a	c
man	c
"	c
,	c
or	c
"	c
...	c
what	c
happens	c
to	c
us	c
in	c
critical	c
situations	c
"	c
.	c

These	c
experiences	c
influenced	c
him	c
so	c
deeply	c
that	c
he	c
described	c
his	c
feelings	c
in	c
several	c
books	c
.	c

One	c
of	c
the	c
most	c
interesting	c
ones	c
is	c
"	c
The	c
old	c
man	c
and	c
the	c
Sea	c
"	c
.	c

A	c
story	c
of	c
an	c
old	c
seaman	c
leaving	c
his	c
town	c
to	c
proove	i
that	c
he	c
is	c
still	c
able	c
to	c
catch	c
the	c
biggest	c
fish	c
ever	c
caught	c
.	c

The	c
story	c
describes	c
his	c
feelings	c
,	c
thoughts	c
,	c
fears	c
and	c
emotions	c
during	c
a	c
struggle	c
with	c
a	c
giant	c
deep-sea	c
fish	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
end	c
he	c
wins	c
but	c
before	c
he	c
is	c
able	c
to	c
get	c
back	c
he	c
has	c
to	c
"	c
sacrifice	c
"	c
his	c
fish	c
to	c
attacking	c
sharks	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
will	c
enjoy	c
it	c

Kim	c

Hi	c

how	c
are	c

?	c

I	c
'm	c

.	c

I	c
just	c

Well	c

so	c
cute	c

After	c
that	c
i	i
have	i
to	c
go	c
in	i
to	i
the	c

room	c
again	c
because	c
they	c
wanted	c
me	c
to	c

the	c
singer	c
.	c

After	c

There	c

Dear	c
Lucas	c
!	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
,	i
I	c
was	c
glad	c
to	c
get	c
it	c
and	c
know	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
news	c
about	c
you	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
congratulate	i
your	i
cousin	i
with	i
fifteenth	i
birthday	i
and	c
with	i
all	i
the	c
best	c
.	c

Now	c
about	c
your	c
questions	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
very	c
difficult	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
give	c
any	c
advice	c
you	i
about	c
it	c
,	i
I	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
your	c
cousin	c
very	c
well	c
so	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
what	c
she	c
prefers	c
reading	c
.	c

But	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
fifteen	c
my	c
favourite	c
book	c
"	i
Best	i
Detective	c
Stories	c
of	c
Agatha	c
Christie	c
"	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
can	c
recommended	i
you	c
to	i
present	i
this	i
book	c
,	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
very	i
interesting	c
,	c
amuse	i
,	c
sometimes	c
dramatic	c
and	c
mystery	i
book	c
.	c

This	c
book	c
help	i
us	c
to	c
impove	i
our	c
logic	i
,	c
mind	c
,	c
memory	i
and	c
it	c
teaches	c
the	c
reader	c
not	c
to	c
lie	c
,	c
be	i
more	c
honest	c
with	c
other	c
people	c
and	c
pay	c
attention	c
for	i
the	c
smallest	c
details	c
in	c
our	c
life	c
because	c
sometimes	c
it	i
can	c
help	c
us	c
very	c
very	c
much	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
hope	c
I	c
could	i
help	i
you	c

for	c
your	c

birthday	c
present	c

I	c
'm	c

Love	c

Last	c
week	c
I	c
was	c
on	c
holiday	c
at	i
London	c
and	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
dissappointed	i
when	c
I	c
visited	c
your	c
theatre	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
the	i
show	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
start	c
at	c
19.30	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
delayed	c
untill	i
20.15	c
,	c
and	c
when	c
the	c
show	c
finally	c
began	c
we	c
were	c
supriced	i
to	c
see	c
that	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
who	i
was	c
the	c
star	c
of	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
was	c
not	c
playing	c
and	c
someone	c
else	c
had	c
replace	i
him	c
and	c
he	c
was	c
really	c
disappointing	c
.	c

it	i
was	c
a	c
complete	c
waste	c
of	c
time	c
and	c
money	c
.	c

That	c
is	c
why	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
request	c
full	i
refund	c
of	c
my	c
money	c
.	c

and	i
Pat	c
answered	c
:	c
"	c
Do	c
n't	c
wory	i
I	c
wo	c
n't	c
tell	c
anyone	c
"	c
.	c

She	c
had	c
told	c
it	i
to	i
Pat	c
though	c
and	c
that	c
was	c
extremely	c
dangerous	c
!	c

Anna	c
could	c
n't	c
do	c
anything	c
though	c
because	c
she	c
needed	c
her	c
help	c
to	c
give	c
the	i
invitations	c
.	c

The	c
party	c
was	c
set	c
up	i
to	c
be	c
in	c
two	c
days	c
.	c

The	c
two	c
days	c
passed	c
really	c
fast	c
and	c
Anna	c
was	c
happy	c
because	c
Pat	c
had	c
n't	c
told	c
anything	i
to	i
her	i
brother	i
,	c
or	c
so	c
she	c
thought	c
!	c

Pat	c
went	c
to	c
Anna	c
's	c
and	c
she	c
seemed	c
really	c
unhappy	c
.	c

Anna	c
asked	c
and	c
she	c
started	c
to	c
worry	c
.	c

Anna	c
could	c
n't	c
believe	c
it	c
,	c
she	c
was	c
devastated	c
,	c
she	c
started	c
crying	c
and	c
told	c
Pat	c
"	c
Get	c
out	c
of	c
my	c
house	c
,	c
now	c
!	c
!	c
!	c
"	c

Everything	c
were	i
destroyed	i
the	i
party	c
and	c
their	c
friendship	c
.	c

With	i
pleasure	i
I	i
'll	i
give	i
all	c
information	i
wich	i
you	c
need	c

The	c
3rd	c

Camp	c

Yours	c

Is	i
shopping	i
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
,	c
is	c
it	c
?	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
good	c
shopping	c
depends	c
on	c
ourself	i
.	c

If	c
we	c
decided	i
to	c
by	i
somthing	i
special	c
and	c
we	c
have	c
enough	c
money	c
for	c
it	c
we	c
have	c
to	c
go	c
and	c
buy	c
it	c
.	c

Probably	c
,	c
maybe	c
not	c
.	c

Some	i
times	i
we	c
have	c
to	i
have	i
deal	i
with	c
not	i
good	i
service	c
or	c
for	i
example	c
could	i
you	c
imagine	c
it	i
on	i
your	i
way	i
to	i
shop	i
you	i
have	i
met	i
wrong	i
people	i
or	c
someone	c
told	i
you	c
bad	c
news	c
.	c

Or	c
quality	i
of	c
your	c
new	c
thing	c
is	c
not	c
so	c
good	c
that	i
you	c
really	i
expected	c
.	c

Maybe	c
you	c
will	c
spend	c
all	c
your	c
money	c
for	i
a	c
new	c
thing	c
and	c
a	c
few	c
hours	c
later	c
your	c
best	c
friend	c
will	c
invite	c
you	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
night-club	i
but	c
you	c
are	i
short	c
of	c
money	c
.	c

Some	c
people	c
will	c
do	c
crazy	c
things	c
in	c
situation	i
like	c
this	c
.	c

They	c
will	c
hate	c
this	c
new	c
thing	c
because	c
they	c
will	c
miss	c
a	c
party	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
wish	c
you	c
have	i
a	i
good	i
enjoyable	c
shopping	c
all	i
your	i
way	i
.	c

During	c
my	i
prior	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
I	c
came	c
across	c
an	c
encourageing	i
advertisment	i
for	c
the	c
show	c
and	c
decided	c
to	c
see	c
it	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
dissappointed	i
to	c
find	c
out	c
that	c
there	c
were	c
no	c
discounts	c
available	c
!	c

Moreover	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
unable	c
to	c
use	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
as	c
it	c
had	c
been	c
closed	c
due	i
to	i
redecoration	c
!	c

I	c
feel	c
as	i
if	i
I	c
had	i
been	c
lied	c
to	c
and	c
thus	c
I	c
demand	c
my	c
money	c
to	i
be	i
returned	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

Everyone	c
had	c
already	i
heard	c
of	i
me	c
getting	c
the	c
secret	c
access	c
code	c
for	c
the	c
'	c
Secret	c
Society	c
'	c
organisation	c
.	c

This	c
was	c
the	c
kind	c
of	c
association	c
everybody	c
knew	c
of	i
but	c
nobody	c
talked	c
about	c
.	c

Everyone	c
was	c
aware	c
that	c
telling	i
aloud	c
about	c
'	i
Secret	c
Society	c
'	c
could	c
get	c
you	c
in	c
trouble	c
,	c
serious	c
trouble	c
.	c

I	c
guess	c
it	c
was	c
that	c
thrill	c
that	c
actually	c
made	c
me	c
anxious	c
to	c
know	c
what	c
really	c
was	c
going	c
on	c
inside	c
the	c
dodgy-looking	c
old	c
house	c
guarded	c
by	c
a	c
man	c
with	c
an	c
unfriendly	c
hound	c
.	c

I	c
've	c
always	c
enjoyed	c
the	i
hazard	i
and	c
this	c
time	c
getting	c
the	c
password	c
was	c
,	c
indeed	c
,	c
a	i
tough	i
coockie	i
.	c

But	c
knowing	c
what	c
these	c
people	c
are	c
capable	c
of	c
makes	c
me	c
doubt	i
wether	i
to	c
use	c
it	c
or	c
not	c
.	c

Especially	c
now	c
,	c
when	c
'	c
big-mouth	c
'	c
Pat	c
spread	i
the	c
news	c
to	c
litterally	i
everyone	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
n't	c
be	c
surprised	c
if	c
suddenly	c
something	c
bad	c
happened	c
to	c
me	c
.	c

Therefore	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
escape	c
.	c

Dear	c
Miss	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
glad	c

place	c
in	c
the	c
competition	c
,	i
I	c
am	c
going	c

you	c
the	i
things	c
that	c
you	c

on	i

I	c

Dear	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
about	c
my	c
experience	c
when	i
I	i
was	i
helping	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
,	i
well	i
first	c
let	c
me	c
tell	c
you	c
that	c
my	c
job	c
was	c
helping	c
the	c
artist	i
if	c
they	c
need	i
something	c
,	c
for	c
example	c
give	i
them	c
water	c
or	c
snacks	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
exciting	c
job	i
but	c
you	c
can	i
knew	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
pop	c
Artists	c
that	i
was	c
the	c
good	c
thing	c
because	i
they	c
gave	c
their	i
t-shirts	i
also	i
I	c
could	c
chat	c
with	c
them	c
for	c
a	c
few	c
minutes	c
.	c

any	i
way	i
,	c
this	c
was	c
my	c
own	i
experience	c
working	c
at	c
the	c
concert	c
,	i
if	i
you	c
have	c
any	i
oportunity	i
to	c
help	c
at	c
any	c
concert	c
you	c
should	c
help	c
because	c
you	c
have	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
fun	c
as	c
well	c
ok	i
.	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
in	i
replay	i
to	c
the	c
letter	c
I	c
have	c
recently	c
recived	i
,	c
to	c
inform	c
you	c
about	c
some	c
details	c
that	c
I	c
am	c
concerned	c
about	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
I	c
want	c
you	c
to	c
know	c
that	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
due	c
to	c
the	c
exam	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
taking	c
in	c
June	c
and	c
,	c
afterwards	c
,	c
I	c
will	c
start	c
my	c
university	c
studies	c
in	c
September	c
which	c
means	c
lots	i
of	c
things	c
to	c
be	c
sorted	c
out	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
prefer	c
staying	c
in	c
log	c
cabins	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
easyer	i
for	c
me	c
to	c
keep	c
my	c
personal	c
belongings	c
clean	c
and	c
tidy	c
apart	i
from	c
the	c
fact	c
that	c
I	c
am	c
terribly	c
afraid	c
of	c
insects	c
such	c
as	c
spiders	c
and	c
ants	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c

There	c
is	c
as	i
well	c
the	i
struggle	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
endure	c
when	c
you	c
find	c
yourself	c
into	i
the	c
crowds	c
crambled	i
in	c
the	c
small	c
shops	c
during	c
the	c
unique	i
day-off	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
buy	c
somthing	i
you	c
like	c
.	c

All	c
this	c
can	c
easily	c
leads	i
to	c
a	c
nerve-collapse	i
,	c
particularly	c
when	c
you	c
realise	c
that	c
your	c
money	c
has	c
been	c
stolen	c
either	c
during	c
your	c
difficult	c
way	c
across	i
the	c
crowds	c
or	c
while	c
you	c
were	c
qeuing	i
to	c
pay	c
.	c

If	c
this	c
was	c
n't	c
enough	c
you	i
strength	c
and	c
mental	c
health	c
can	c
be	c
completely	c
destroyed	c
when	c
despite	i
having	c
been	c
stolen	i
,	c
having	c
spent	c
hours	c
walking	c
around	c
and	c
being	c
tired	c
and	c
hungry	c
you	i
finally	c
buy	c
something	c
you	c
really	c
liked	i
with	c
your	c
credit	c
card	c
and	c
after	i
having	c
walked	c
a	c
few	c
blocks	c
you	i
see	c
the	c
same	c
item	c
at	c
half	c
price	i
in	c
another	c
shop	c
.	c

If	c
I	c
can	c
choose	c
accommodation	i
I	c
prefer	i
log	i
cabins	i
,	c
because	c
when	c
I	c
've	c
been	c
in	i
Camps	i
,	i
it	c
always	c
has	c
been	c
in	c
tents	c
,	c
then	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
change	c
and	c
try	c
this	c
other	c
kind	c
of	c
accommodation	c
.	c

Everyone	i
are	i
very	c
interesting	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
,	c
again	c
.	c

SHOPPING	c
IS	c
NOT	c
ALWAYS	c
ENJOYABLE	c
.	c

I	c
can	c
say	c
that	c
nowadays	c
is	i
growing	i
up	i
very	c
quickly	c
in	c
our	c
society	c
like	i
a	c
kind	c
of	c
sport	c
or	c
hobby	c
to	i
waste	c
or	c
spend	c
the	i
free	c
time	c
.	c

And	c
it	c
's	c
creating	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
adict	i
people	c
,	c
call	i
"	c
shopalcoholics	i
"	c
.	c

Otherwise	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

Another	c
common	c
problem	c
could	c
be	c
the	c
long	c
queue	c
in	c
the	c
fitting	c
rooms	c
waiting	i
stand	i
up	c
for	c
your	c
turn	c
.	c

After	c
that	c
,	c
the	i
unfriendly	c
and	c
sometime	i
's	i
unpolite	i
shop	c
assistance	i
who	c
breaks	i
your	c
nerves	c
down	i
.	c

But	c
never	c
mind	c
!	c
the	i
worst	c
arrive	i
when	c
you	c
get	c
at	i
home	c
in	c
the	c
evening	c
and	c
find	c
a	c
chair	c
to	c
sit	c
because	i
your	c
feet	c
are	c
killing	c
you	c
and	c
realize	i
you	c
have	c
spent	c
all	c
the	i
money	c
without	c
buying	c
the	c
stuff	c
that	c
you	c
need	c
to	c
cook	c
tonight	c
.	c

Well	c
I	i
seems	c
to	c
me	c
that	c
you	c
should	c
know	c
what	c
had	i
happened	i
there	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
read	c
your	c
advertisement	c
where	c
it	c
was	c
written	c
that	c
the	c
musical	i
show	c
started	c
at	c
19.30	c
,	c
but	c
do	c
you	c
know	c
at	i
what	c
hour	i
it	c
started	c
?	c

It	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
!	c

Most	c
people	c
could	c
n't	c
afford	c
them	c
.	c

As	i
a	i
matter	i
of	i
fact	i
,	c
when	c
the	c
musical	i
show	c
was	c
over	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
really	c
hungry	c
.	c

But	c
as	c
I	c
had	c
read	c
your	c
advertisement	c
I	c
knew	c
there	c
was	c
a	c
restaurant	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
went	c
there	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
have	c
something	c
to	c
eat	c
.	c

But	c
can	c
you	c
believed	c
it	c
,	i
it	i
was	c
closed	c
.	c

Absolutely	i
closed	c
.	c

This	c
really	c
disappoint	i
me	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

Maybe	c
this	c
is	c
how	c
my	c
story	c
begins	c
.	c

Well	c
first	c
of	c
all	c
Pat	i
was	c
a	c
very	c
friend	i
of	c
mine	c
.	c

With	c
nothing	c
to	c
lose	c
,	c
at	c
all	c
,	c
but	c
on	c
the	c
contrary	c
,	c
with	c
a	c
lot	c
to	c
learn	c
from	i
.	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
keen	c
on	c
English	c
lessons	c
,	c
maybe	c
because	c
I	c
was	c
sitting	c
near	c
the	c
Boy	c
I	c
loves	i
.	c

Yes	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
this	c
was	c
the	c
only	c
reason	c
.	c

His	c
name	c
was	c
Cody	c
.	c

He	c
was	c
a	c
very	c
handsome	c
and	c
good	i
looking	i
boy	c
.	c

But	c
far	i
from	i
that	i
,	c
he	c
was	c
a	c
very	c
kind	c
person	c
.	c

Pat	c
told	c
me	c
that	c
he	c
was	c
also	c
in	c
love	c
with	c
me	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
know	c
what	c
to	c
do	c
.	c

Pat	c
suggested	c
me	i
to	i
talk	i
to	c
him	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
really	c
did	c
n't	c
managed	i
to	c
do	c
so	c
.	c

As	c
Pat	c
was	c
lossing	i
his	c
patience	c
,	c
he	c
decided	c
to	c
talk	c
to	c
him	c
.	c

I	c
can	c
say	c
that	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
nervious	i
or	i
anxious	c
about	c
what	c
was	c
going	c
to	c
happen	c
.	c

He	c
did	c
n't	c
kept	i
my	c
secret	c
.	c

This	c
was	c
my	c
secret	c
and	c
now	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
.	c

But	c
so	i
,	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
was	c
for	c
the	c
best	c
,	c
he	c
was	c
also	c
in	c
love	c
with	c
me	c
.	c

But	c
on	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
I	c
will	c
never	c
trust	c
in	i
Pat	c
.	c

Dear	c
Madame	i
,	c

I	c
am	c
writting	i
this	c
letter	c
to	c
informe	i
you	c
about	c
the	c
decisions	c
I	c
have	c
made	c
according	i
to	i
your	c
questions	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
on	i
July	c
because	c
I	c
will	c
I	i
have	c
finished	c
my	c
exams	c
by	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
June	c
.	c

I	c
will	c
not	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
travel	c
on	i
August	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
found	c
a	c
job	c
for	c
that	c
month	c
.	c

Secondly	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
be	i
accommodate	i
in	c
log	i
cabins	i
.	c

When	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
child	c
I	c
was	c
affraid	i
of	c
all	c
these	c
little	c
insects	c
that	c
they	i
live	c
in	c
the	c
ground	c
and	c
this	c
fear	c
still	c
remain	i
till	i
now	c
.	c

I	c
also	c
think	c
that	c
the	c
log	c
cabin	c
will	c
be	c
much	c
more	c
confortable	i
than	c
the	c
tent	c
.	c

I	c
play	i
basketball	c
since	c
I	c
was	c
twelve	c
years	c
old	c
and	c
I	c
am	i
member	i
of	c
the	c
basketball	i
school	i
team	c
for	c
four	c
years	c
.	c

In	c
swimming	c
I	c
had	i
won	i
the	c
first	c
price	i
of	i
a	c
local	c
competition	c
.	c

Finaly	i
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
for	c
some	c
further	c
informations	i
about	c
the	c
clothes	c
and	c
the	c
money	c
we	c
will	c
need	c
.	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
,	c

I	c
did	c
n't	c
have	c
to	c
do	c
something	i
very	c
difficult	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
only	c
responsable	i
for	c
the	i
property	i
of	i
the	i
back	i
stages	i
.	c

I	c
was	c
shocked	c
and	c
terrified	c
the	c
firt	i
time	c
I	c
saw	c
them	c
,	c
but	c
the	c
truth	c
is	c
that	c
they	c
are	c
men	c
like	c
us	c
.	c

They	c
have	c
a	c
very	c
simple	c
life	c
and	c
behavior	i
when	c
they	c
were	i
n't	i
on	c
the	c
scene	i

If	c
I	c
have	c
the	c
opportunity	c
next	c
month	c
I	c
really	c
want	c
to	c
go	c
back	c
.	c

Kelly	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
problems	c
were	i
exist	i
on	i
the	i
musical	c
show	c
.	c

What	c
about	c
the	c
available	i
discounts	c
.	i

Except	i
of	i
this	c
there	i
more	i
.	c

After	c
the	c
show	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
,	i
because	c
the	c
chef	c
of	c
the	c
restaurant	c
was	c
ill	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
very	c
disappointed	c
with	c
you	c
.	c

I	c
did	c
not	c
expect	c
these	c
problems	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
waiting	c
your	i
answer	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

One	c
day	c
Brian	c
,	c
the	i
best	i
friend	i
of	i
Pat	i
told	i
him	c
a	c
secret	c
.	c

An	i
important	c
secret	c
for	c
Brian	c
.	c

He	c
told	c
him	c
,	i
that	c
he	c
was	c
in	c
love	c
with	c
Jane	c
,	c
a	c
girl	c
in	c
their	c
class	c
.	c

He	c
did	c
n't	c
told	i
the	i
secret	c
because	c
he	c
wanted	c
to	c
heard	i
Brian	c
but	c
because	c
he	c
wanted	c
to	c
help	c
him	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
Beth	c
,	i
asked	c
Jane	c
if	c
she	c
is	i
in	c
love	c
with	c
Brian	c
and	c
she	c
said	c
that	c
she	c
was	c
.	c

Brian	c
and	c
Pat	c
had	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
arguments	c
about	c
this	c
because	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
unexpected	c
evening	c
I	c
had	c
when	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
"	c
in	c
your	c
theatre	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
the	c
time	c
for	c
the	c
second	c
session	c
was	c
meant	c
to	c
be	c
at	c
19.30	c
,	c
but	c
somehow	c
it	c
began	c
at	c
20.15	c
,	c
which	c
was	c
a	c
45	c
minutes	c
delay	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
also	c
expecting	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
actor	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
performing	c
,	c
but	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
did	c
,	c
who	c
did	c
not	c
perform	c
as	c
well	c
as	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
does	c
.	c

This	c
was	c
another	c
disappointing	c
thing	c
of	i
that	c
evening	c
.	c

But	c
my	c
complain	i
does	c
not	c
finish	c
here	c
.	c

And	c
what	c
is	c
more	c
,	c
I	c
could	c
not	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
as	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
the	c
main	c
chef	c
was	c
ill	c
and	c
could	c
not	c
come	c
to	c
work	c
.	c

Alessandra	c
Lane	c
.	c

As	c
soon	c
as	c
she	c
arrived	c
home	c
,	c
she	c
phoned	c
her	c
best	c
friend	c
Sue	c
and	c
told	c
her	c
everything	c
,	c
all	c
details	c
included	c
.	c

She	c
also	c
told	c
her	c
not	c
to	c
tell	c
anybody	c
about	c
it	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
secret	c
.	c

The	c
thing	c
was	c
that	c
Mary	c
could	c
n't	c
resist	c
the	c
secrecy	c
and	c
phoned	c
her	c
cousin	c
,	c
who	c
also	c
studied	c
in	c
our	c
school	c
.	c

She	c
was	c
the	c
director	c
of	c
the	c
school	c
newspaper	c
and	c
Mary	c
did	c
n't	c
tell	c
her	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
secret	c
,	c
so	c
on	c
monday	i
at	c
9	c
a.m.	c
MY	c
SECRET	c
was	c
published	c
in	c
the	c
school	c
paper	c
and	c
at	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
the	c
day	c
,	c
eventually	c
everybody	c
had	c
read	c
the	c
"	c
news	c
"	c
.	c

I	c
did	c
n't	c
know	c
it	c
was	c
published	c
as	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
read	c
the	c
paper	c
and	c
no	c
one	c
told	c
me	c
anything	c
,	c
either	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
soon	c
knew	c
it	c
because	c
when	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
school	c
canteen	c
everybody	c
was	c
staring	c
at	c
me	c
and	c
whispering	c
to	c
eachother	i
.	c

At	c
first	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
realise	c
what	c
was	c
happening	c
,	c
but	c
then	c
a	c
friend	c
of	c
mine	c
told	c
me	c
that	c
everyone	c
knew	c
that	c
I	c
was	c
going	c
out	c
with	c
the	c
most	c
popular	c
boy	c
in	c
the	c
school	c
and	c
that	c
we	c
had	c
kissed	c
eachother	i
in	c
the	c
park	c
last	c
friday	i
.	c

Suddenly	c
my	c
face	c
went	c
all	c
red	c
and	c
I	c
ran	c
towards	c
the	c
toilet	c
.	c

That	c
day	c
I	c
swore	c
to	c
myself	c
that	c
I	c
would	c
never	c
trust	c
anybody	c
again	c
.	c

About	c
the	c
accommodation	c
at	c
camp	c
,	c
I	c
prefer	c
in	i
tents	i
because	c
I	c
love	c
sleep	i
in	c
tents	c
,	i
is	i
more	c
interesting	c
than	c
sleep	i
in	c
log	c
cabins	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
do	i
climbing	c
and	c
sailing	c
while	c
I	c
'm	c
at	c
the	c
camp	c
,	i
I	c
can	c
climbing	i
very	c
well	c
I	i
used	c
to	c
climbing	i
ten	c
years	c
ago	c
in	c
my	c
country	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
worried	c
about	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
will	c
need	c
in	c
the	c
camp	c
?	c
and	i
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
carry	i
for	c
the	c
trip	c
?	c

Could	c
you	c
answer	c
my	c
questions	c
please	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
you	c
can	c

because	c
I	c
'm	c
nervous	c

and	c
I	c
need	c
your	c

answer	i
,	c
and	c
I	c
will	c
have	c
talk	i
with	c
my	c
parents	c
about	c
camp	i

Yours	c
Sincerely	c

I	c
agree	c
with	i
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

Nowadays	c
,	c
the	i
people	c
are	c
always	c
buying	c
anythings	i
maybe	i
they	c
do	c
n't	c
need	c
this	i
things	c
,	c
only	i
buy	c
because	i
is	i
in	c
fashion	c

In	c
the	c
first	c
place	c
,	c
when	c
the	i
people	c
think	c
only	c
in	i
go	i
to	i
the	i
shopping	c
forgot	i
others	i
things	c
:	c
play	i
with	c

I	c
my	c

My	c

Circle	c

Danny	c

my	c

but	c
we	c
seems	i
quite	c
disappointing	i
,	i
my	i
son	c
was	c
very	c
happy	c
because	c
he	c
would	c
see	c
for	i
the	i
first	i
time	i
his	i
favorite	i

Expecting	c
the	i

at	c
19:00	c

it	c
only	c
starts	i
at	c
20:15	c
,	i
it	i
finished	c
later	c
than	c
it	c
was	c
suposed	i
to	c
and	c
then	c
we	c
missed	c

I	c
have	i

I	c
though	i
my	c

I.	c
As	c
we	c
had	c
alredy	i

Nowadays	c

First	c

I	c

I	c
'm	c

I	c

What	c
kind	c
of	c

am	c
I	c
supposed	c
to	c

with	c

And	c
what	c
about	c

And	c
what	c
about	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c

I	c
'm	c
a	c
woman	c
and	c
they	c
say	c
that	c
shopping	c
is	c
women	c
's	c
best	i
activity	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
have	c
a	c
particular	c
problem	c
.	c

That	c
's	c
why	c
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
an	c
easy	c
thing	c
to	c
do	c
.	c

In	c
fact	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
buy	c
whatever	c
I	c
like	c
and	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
follow	c
fashions	c
just	i
like	c
the	c
other	c
women	c
do	c
.	c

I	c
see	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
pretty	c
things	c
but	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
quit	i
the	c
idea	c
of	c
wearing	c
them	c
just	c
because	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
they	c
wo	c
n't	c
look	c
so	c
pretty	c
on	c
me	c
.	c

Often	c
they	c
must	c
go	c
in	i
special	c
shops	c
to	c
by	i
their	c
clothes	c
.	c

They	c
're	c
full	c
of	c
perfect	c
people	c
.	c

The	c
sort	c
of	c
people	c
you	c
will	c
never	c
find	c
in	c
real	c
life	c

Dear	c

It	c
was	c
about	c

From	c
,	c
that	c
day	c

And	c
every	c
day	c
when	c
I	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
I	c
live	i
in	c
the	i

I	c
never	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
.	i

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
getting	c
sun-tanned	c
under	c
the	c
sun	c
in	c
California	c
.	c

Here	c
are	i
the	c
information	c
which	c
you	c
asked	c
me	c
for	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
,	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
the	c
only	c
month	c
that	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
take	c
off	i
days	i
.	c

Also	c
my	c
kids	c
have	c
school	c
holidays	c
during	c
this	c
month	c
therefore	c
I	c
hope	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
mid	c
of	i
July	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
very	c
difficult	c
to	c
choose	c
only	c
two	c
of	c
those	c
fascinating	c
activities	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
made	c
a	c
decision	c
,	c
which	c
is	c
Golf	c
and	c
Photography	c
.	c

Since	c
my	c
hobby	c
is	c
taking	c
photos	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
interested	c
in	c
this	c
field	c
and	c
have	c
studied	c
by	c
myself	c
about	c
it	c
.	c

Especially	i
I	c
wonder	c
what	c
else	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
pack	c
to	c
go	c
there	c
.	c

How	c
are	c
you	c
?	c

I	c
wish	i
you	c
are	c
fine	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
fine	c
either	i
but	c
I	c
'm	c
quite	c
busy	c
to	i
find	i
another	c
part	c
time	c
job	c
after	c
the	c
one	c
,	c
which	c
was	c
the	i
concert	i
supporting	i
one	i
.	c

I	c
remember	c
that	c
you	c
asked	c
me	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
about	c
that	c
job	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
quite	c
terrible	c
when	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
let	i
people	c
leave	c
,	c
because	c
all	c
tickets	c
were	c
sold	c
out	c
.	c

Then	c
the	c
concert	c
started	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
called	c
from	i
one	c
of	c
the	c
staffs	i
for	c
help	c
,	c
finally	c
I	c
could	c
get	c
into	c
the	c
stadium	c
.	c

The	c
next	c
work	i
I	c
was	c
gives	i
was	c
ironing	c
costumes	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
pity	c
that	c
I	c
had	c
no	c
chance	c
to	c
learn	c
how	c
the	c
sound	c
system	c
works	c
,	c
which	c
I	c
was	c
mostly	c
interested	c
.	i

But	c
it	c
was	c
terrific	c
enough	c
to	c
hear	c
the	c
band	c
performing	c
and	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
audience	c
's	c
reactions	c
,	c
meanwhile	c
the	c
backstage	c
could	c
n't	c
even	c
join	i
that	c
fantastic	c
atmosphere	c
.	c

I	c
wish	i
this	c
is	c
enough	c
to	c
express	c
my	c
feeling	c
and	c
I	c
hope	c
someday	c
we	c
can	c
share	c
such	c
things	c
together	c
.	c

Stay	c
pretty	c
and	c
lovely	c
!	c

Kisses	c
from	c

I	c
am	c
writting	i
to	c
inform	c
some	i
problems	c
we	c
had	c
.	c

I	c
want	i
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
to	c
see	c
"	c
over	i
the	i
rainbow	i
"	c
at	i
17th	c
June	c
.	c

I	c
thought	c
we	c
can	i
buy	c
discounts	c
tickets	c
according	i
to	i
the	c
advertisement	c
.	c

eventually	i
,	c
we	c
got	c
the	c
tickets	c
,	c
Because	i
we	c
would	i
like	i
to	c
see	c
the	c
musical	c
and	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
.	c

After	i
we	c
arrive	i
at	c
the	c
theatre	c
,	c
We	i
were	c
very	c
disappointed	c
.	c

Because	c
the	i
different	c
actor	c
played	i
the	i
musical	c
that	c
day	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
,	c
It	i
started	c
20:15	i
.	c

and	c
we	c
could	c
n't	c
enjoy	c
dinner	c
at	c
theatre	i
restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

To	c
tell	c
the	c
truth	c
,	c
we	c
could	c
n't	c
enjoy	c
our	c
evening	c
.	c

Would	c
it	c
be	c
possible	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
back	i
money	i
for	c
tickets	i
.	i

We	c
had	c
a	c
secret	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
ship	c
!	c
!	c

There	c
was	c
beach	i
our	i
town	c
.	c

it	i
was	c
old	c
and	c
little	i
broken	i
.	c

But	c
it	c
was	c
most	i
important	c
place	c
in	c
the	c
world	c
.	c

One	c
day	c
,	c
Suddenly	i
,	c
heavy	i
storm	c
came	c
our	i
town	c
.	c

Our	c
ship	c
left	i
on	c
the	c
beach	c
.	c

Because	c
Pat	c
called	i
them	c
.	c

Of	c
course	c
we	c
could	c
n't	c
play	c
there	c
after	c
that	c
.	c

But	c
now	c
,	i
I	c
am	c
thinking	c
about	c
new	i
secret	i
our	i
place	i
.	c

It	c
is	c
a	c
secret	c
!	c
!	c

Dear	c
sir	c
or	c
madam	c
,	c

I	c
have	c
recently	c
been	c
on	c
a	c
holiday	c
in	i
London	c
.	c

First	c
the	c
advertisement	c
said	c
that	c
there	c
were	c
discounts	c
available	c
but	c
there	c
were	c
not	c
.	c

Finally	c
when	c
it	c
started	c
we	c
noticed	c
to	c
our	c
suprisement	i
that	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
the	c
right	c
actor	c
.	i

Very	c
disappointing	c
as	i
Danny	c
Brook	c
is	c
my	c
favourite	c
actor	c
.	c

Afterwards	c
we	c
wanted	c
to	c
go	c
for	c
a	c
pleasent	i
dinner	c
.	c

To	c
our	c
surprise	c
the	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
the	i
lack	c
of	c
staff	c
to	c
keep	c
it	c
open	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
be	c
very	c
pleased	c
if	c
I	c
could	c
have	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

What	c
will	c
clothes	c
be	c
like	c
100	c
years	c
from	c
now	c
?	c

In	c
what	c
way	c
will	c
they	c
change	c
?	c

Of	c
course	c
nobody	c
knows	c
the	c
answer	c
and	c
maybe	c
we	c
should	c
be	c
happy	c
for	i
that	c
.	c

My	c
conclusion	c
is	c
that	c
people	c
will	c
wear	c
less	c
and	c
thinner	c
clothes	c
.	c

I	c
mean	c
when	c
the	c
earth	i
's	i
getting	c
warmer	c
and	c
warmer	c
because	c
of	c
an	i
pollution	c
that	c
we	c
people	c
cause	i
the	i
world	c
.	c

Maybe	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
they	c
'll	c
find	c
out	i
a	c
new	c
fabric	c
which	c
protects	c
you	c
from	c
dirt	c
and	c
dangerous	c
sunshine	c
.	c

Maybe	c
everybody	c
will	c
end	c
up	c
wearing	c
shorts	c
and	c
skirts	c
.	c

Strict	i
suits	c
will	c
be	c
transformed	c
into	c
a	i
school-uniform-like	c
shirt	i
and	c
knee-lengthed	i
shorts	c

On	i
the	c
paper	c
it	c
was	c
writting	i
the	i
principal	c
actor	c
is	c
"	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
"	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
him	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
that	i
we	c
have	i
never	c
seen	c
,	c
and	i
heard	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
's	c
really	c
not	c
correct	i

They	c
have	i
n't	i
respect	c
the	c
timetable	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
had	i
to	c

at	c

he	i
started	c
at	c
20:15	i
how	i
can	c
you	c
explain	c
this	c
fault	i

After	c
this	c
bad	c

we	c
had	c
want	i
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c

for	c

ate	i
something	c
and	c
it	c
was	c

nobody	c
had	i
explained	i
us	i
why	c
the	c

was	c

So	c
,	c
I	c
'm	c
very	c
angry	c
when	c
I	c
think	c
about	c
this	c
evening	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
have	c
my	c

I	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
ask	c
for	c
some	c
queries	c
about	c
your	c
letter	c
which	c
I	c
have	c
received	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
Camp	i
California	c
on	c
Monday	c
,	c
6th	c
July	c
,	c
because	c
my	c
school	c
's	c
holiday	c
will	c
begin	c
at	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
June	c
.	c

Otherwise	c
I	c
will	c
not	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
join	c
that	c
camp	c
.	c

That	c
is	c
why	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
do	c
that	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
could	c
you	c
tell	c
me	c
if	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
bring	c
some	c
clothes	c
,	c
towels	c
and	c
extra	c
money	c
?	c

It	c
seems	c
ages	c
since	c
I	c
wrote	c
to	c
you	c
.	c

How	c
's	c
your	c
new	c
flat	c
?	c

When	c
I	c
received	c
your	c
letter	c
with	c
photographs	c
of	c
that	c
flat	c
,	c
it	c
really	c
looked	c
nice	c
.	c

Anyway	c
,	c
I	c
'll	c
tell	c
you	c
about	c
my	c
wonderful	c
experience	c
which	c
I	c
enjoyed	c
at	c
a	c
pop	c
concert	c
.	c

It	c
took	c
place	c
in	c
a	i
Korea	c
national	c
center	c
which	c
was	i
the	c
biggest	c
building	c
in	c
Korea	c
.	c

There	c
were	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
people	c
,	c
I	c
guess	c
over	c
50,000	c
,	c
who	c
wanted	c
to	c
see	c
famous	c
singers	c
and	c
listen	c
to	c
their	c
songs	c
.	c

You	c
know	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
studied	c
English	c
for	c
two	c
years	c
in	c
England	c
.	c

I	c
got	c
Madona	c
's	c
signature	i
!	c

I	c
really	c
hope	c
to	c
see	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

thank	i
you	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
,	i
I	i
've	i
been	i
so	c
happy	c
to	c
receave	i
such	c
a	i
good	c
news	c
that	c
I	c
ca	i
n't	i
already	i
believe	c
it	c
.	c

In	i
the	c
accomodation	i
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
,	c
I	c
prefer	c
to	c
rent	c
a	c
tent	c
,	c
he	i
is	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
more	c
funny	i
,	c
I	c
think	c
,	c
but	c
are	c
the	c
tents	c
singles	c
?	c

I	c
would	c
be	c
pleased	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
give	c
me	c
details	c
about	c
this	c
question	c
.	c

I	c
finished	c
5th	c
at	i
the	c
England	i
Golf	i
tour	i
junior	i
in	c
1999	c
,	i
and	c
basketball	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
discover	i
this	c
sport	c
I	c
only	c
used	c
to	c
play	c
at	c
school	c
.	c

I	c
've	c
got	c
other	c
questions	c
:	c
wich	i
type	c
of	c
clothes	c
do	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
bring	c
?	c

Can	c
I	c
change	c
money	c
on	c
the	c
campus	i
?	c

Are	c
some	i
party	i
organized	c
during	c
the	c
holidays	c
?	c

Is	c
there	c
only	c
one	c
teatcher	i
for	c
each	c
sport	c
,	c
and	c
how	c
many	c
are	c
we	i
in	c
each	c
group	c
of	i
activities	i
?	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hear	i
from	c
you	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

First	c
,	c
I	c
think	i
we	i
ca	i
n't	i
shoot	c
a	c
film	c
only	c
about	c
lessons	c
or	c
only	c
about	c
breaks	c
,	c
because	c
this	i
two	c
elements	c
are	c
representative	c
of	c
a	i
daily	c
life	c
at	c
school	c
are	i
n't	c
they	c
?	c

Just	c
after	c
,	c
to	c
make	c
a	c
contrast	c
,	c
we	c
may	c
film	c
the	c
break	c
,	c
because	c
it	c
's	c
the	c
other	c
part	c
of	c
a	c
daily	i
school	i
!	c

It	c
's	c
the	c
place	c
where	c
you	c
can	c
meet	c
your	c
friends	c
,	c
where	c
you	c
can	c
talk	c
free	i
,	c
there	i
are	c
no	c
teatchers	i
,	i
it	i
could	c
be	c
a	c
good	c
contrast	c
to	c
the	c
serious	i
of	c
the	c
lessons	c
.	c

To	c
come	c
back	c
to	c
a	i
strict	i
(	i
a	i
little	i
beat	i
less	i
)	i
subject	c
,	c
I	c
suggest	c
that	c
we	c
film	c
the	c
sport	i
lesson	c
,	i
doing	i
that	c
will	c
allowed	i
the	c
spectator	c
to	c
see	c
how	c
does	i
the	c
students	c
behave	c
when	c
they	c
are	c
all	c
together	c
and	c
in	c
small	c
groups	c
.	c

Finally	c
we	c
should	c
film	c
the	c
lunch	c
,	c
which	c
is	c
also	c
a	c
moment	c
to	i
relax	i
for	i
the	i
students	i
,	i
and	i
for	i
the	i
teatchers	i
,	i
we	i
must	c
n't	c
forget	c
to	c
film	c
the	c
teatcher	i
room	c
because	c
if	c
a	c
school	c
is	c
made	c
of	c
students	c
,	c
it	c
's	c
also	c
made	c
of	c
teatchers	i
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Ryan	c

This	c
august	i
I	c
will	c
start	c
a	c
new	c
job	c
so	c
the	c
only	c
possible	c
month	c
for	c
me	c
to	c

I	c
hope	c
this	c
will	c
cause	c
no	c
problems	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
glad	c
that	c
you	c
offer	c
for	i
accommodation	c
not	c
only	c
tents	i
but	c
also	c
log	i
cabins	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
difficult	c
to	c
say	c
how	c
good	i
I	c
can	c
sing	c
but	c
I	c
really	c
like	c
it	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
I	c
am	c
not	c
too	c
bad	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
I	c
gave	i
you	c
all	c
informations	i
you	c
need	c
.	c

How	c
much	c
money	c
do	c
you	c
think	c
I	c
have	c
to	c

The	c
motor	i

club	c
of	i
our	c
town	c
organized	c
a	c

They	c
were	c
all	c
very	c
kind	c
and	c
with	c
some	c
of	c
them	c
I	c
spent	c
the	c
rest	c
of	c
the	c
evening	c
and	c
also	c
the	c
following	c

I	c
will	c

Rosalinde	c
Schulz	c

I	c
have	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
that	c
for	i
me	i
it	i
is	i
only	i
possible	i
to	c
go	c
on	c
holiday	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
my	c
father	c
is	c
very	c
ill	c
and	c
it	c
is	c
only	c
possible	c
for	c
my	c
sister	c
to	c
take	c
care	c
of	c
him	c
in	c
July	c
(	c
because	c
her	c
small	c
children	c
are	c
in	c
summer	c
school	c
at	c
this	i
time	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
that	c
I	c
'd	c
prefer	c
tents	i
.	c

For	c
me	c
tents	c
are	c
a	c
kind	c
of	c
back	i
to	i
basic	i
living	c
and	c
I	c
like	c
this	c
very	c
much	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
people	c
should	c
become	c
more	c
familiar	c
with	c
the	c
rules	c
of	c
nature	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
glad	c
to	c
read	c
that	c
it	c
is	c
possible	c
to	c
do	c
activities	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
.	c

I	c
've	c
chosen	c
singing	c
and	c
swimming	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
also	c
good	c
at	c
swimming	c
but	c
I	c
do	c
not	c
do	c
it	c
professional	i
.	c

There	c
are	c
two	c
further	c
questions	c
which	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
.	c

First	i
How	i
much	c
money	c
do	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
with	c
me	c
?	c
and	i
what	c
clothes	c
should	c
I	c
choose	i
?	c

I	c
'd	c
be	c
very	c
happy	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
give	c
me	c
a	c
call	c
and	c
answer	c
this	i
questions	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	i

Dear	c
Kim	c
!	c

Today	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
something	c
really	c
exciting	c
and	c
also	c
very	c
hard	c
to	c
believe	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
so	c
happy	c
and	c
suprised	i
that	c
I	i
first	i
could	c
not	c
really	c
believe	c
it	c
.	c

But	c
it	c
was	c
true	c
.	c

It	c
took	c
place	c
on	c
the	c
10th	c
of	c
June	c
in	c
Salzburg	c
.	c

I	i
started	c
at	c
8	c
pm	c
but	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
be	c
there	c
at	c
11	c
am	c
.	c

First	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
help	c
with	c
the	c
catering	c
which	i
lasted	c
until	c
2	c
pm.	c
After	c
this	c
I	c
met	c
the	c
band	c
members	c
and	c
got	c
to	c
know	c
them	c
while	c
we	c
were	c
having	c
a	c
good	c
meal	c
.	c

The	c
front	c
man	c
felt	c
a	c
bit	c
sick	c
and	c
so	c
he	c
skipped	c
the	c
meal	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
so	c
excited	c
that	c
I	i
also	i
was	i
not	i
able	i
to	i
eat	i
anything	i
.	c

I	c
had	c
to	c
show	c
them	c
the	c
way	c
to	c
the	c
interviewing	c
room	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
bit	c
boring	c
but	c
more	c
or	c
less	c
okay	c
.	c

At	c
7	c
p.m.	c
the	c
first	c
group	c
started	c
.	c

At	c
8	c
pm	c
Metallica	c
started	c
and	c
I	i
have	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
,	c
they	c
did	i
a	c
great	c
performance	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
met	c
them	c
after	c
the	c
concert	c
they	c
asked	c
me	c
questions	c
like	c
Did	i
you	c
like	c
the	c
performance	c
!	i
or	c
How	i
do	c
you	c
think	c
about	c
the	c
first	c
group	c
?	c

Questions	c
like	c
you	c
and	c
I	c
usually	c
ask	c
each	c
other	c
.	c

You	c
know	c
what	c
I	c
mean	c
,	i
they	i
were	c
not	c
conceited	c
or	c
something	i
like	c
this	i
.	c

This	c
was	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
best	c
and	c
most	c
exciting	c
days	c
in	i
my	c
life	c
.	c

Hope	c
you	c
answer	c
this	c
letter	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c
.	c

Lots	c
of	c
hugs	c
and	c
kisses	c

I	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
all	c
the	c
information	c
you	c
need	c
:	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
available	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
from	c

to	c
20th	c
because	c
my	c

this	i
month	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
if	c
you	c

n't	c
mind	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
sleep	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
.	c

Although	c
it	c
is	c
not	c
very	c
comfortable	c
,	c
I	c
like	c
camping	c
very	c
much	c
.	c

Thirdly	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
interested	c
in	c
swimming	c
and	c
also	c
climbing	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

In	c
fact	c
,	c
to	i
do	i
shopping	c
can	c
be	i
some	c
disavantages	i
for	c
different	c
reasons	c
:	c

Firstly	c
,	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
queue	c
for	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
to	c
get	c
a	c
free	c
cabin	i
and	c
waste	c
of	i
time	c
putting	c
on	c
some	c
clothes	c
and	i
in	c
the	c
end	c
they	c
are	c
not	c
the	c
right	c
size	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
easy	c
to	c
spend	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
money	c
in	c
few	i
minutes	c
and	c
as	i
soon	i
as	i
you	i
can	i
regret	i
to	i
buy	i
all	c
these	i
clothes	c
,	i
which	c
you	c
do	c
n't	c
really	c
need	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
doing	i
shopping	c
bring	i
me	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
satisfaction	c
especially	c
I	i
am	c
depressed	c
,	i
nevertheless	i
it	c
could	c
be	c
very	c
dangerous	c
for	c
my	c
wallet	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
reply	c
and	c
ask	c
you	c
some	c
questions	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
for	i
the	c
accomodation	i
,	c
I	c
would	c
say	c
I	c
prefer	c
living	c
in	c
tent	i
rather	c
than	c
in	c
log	i
cabin	c
because	c
I	c
used	c
to	c
sleep	c
in	c
tent	i
while	i
I	c
was	c
joining	i
a	i
local	c
scout	c
camp	c
in	c
my	c
country	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
ask	i
you	c
whether	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
prepare	c
any	c
speacial	i
clothes	c
for	c
camping	c
or	c
the	i
camp	i
will	i
provide	c
them	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
receiving	c
the	c
details	c
of	i
travelling	i
soon	c
and	c
joining	i
your	c
camp	c
in	c
July	c
.	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

In	i
my	i
opinion	i
,	i
I	i
do	i
agree	i
with	c
this	c
expression	i
.	c

One	c
of	c
the	c
most	c
unforgettable	c
habit	i
of	c
city	c
life	c
is	c
going	c
out	c
for	i
shopping	c
.	c

A	c
group	c
of	c
girls	c
can	c
spend	i
their	i
time	i
in	c
a	c
shopping	c
center	i
forever	c
.	c

It	c
seems	c
to	c
me	c
that	c
more	c
people	c
in	c
my	c
hometown	c
tend	c
to	c
go	c
shopping	c
in	c
their	c
free	c
time	c
because	c
the	c
shopping	c
complexs	i
nowadays	c
are	c
more	c
attractive	c
and	c
combine	c
every	c
facilities	i
inside	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
service	c
you	i
'd	i
offered	i
me	c
last	c
Saturday	c
evening	c
at	c
The	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
.	c

There	c
were	c
n't	c
any	c
discount	i
available	c
as	c
you	c
'd	c
assured	c
in	i
the	c
add	i
.	c

I	c
think	c
you	c
should	c
check	c
the	c
information	c
before	c
print	i
it	c
!	c

When	c
the	c
play	c
began	c
I	c
realised	c
that	c
the	c
main	c
actor	c
had	c
been	c
changed	i
and	c
the	c
new	c
one	c
was	c
n't	c
good	c
at	c
all	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
n't	c
visit	c
the	c
theatre	c
after	c
the	c
performance	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
for	c
reparations	i
.	c

Why	c
did	c
n't	c
you	c
say	c
something	c
about	c
it	c
?	c

Please	c
answer	c
my	c
letter	c
as	c
soon	c
as	c
possible	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

This	c
is	c
not	c
a	c
simple	c
question	c
because	c
I	c
got	i
used	c
to	c
dealing	c
with	c
technology	c
since	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
child	c
but	c
I	c
'm	c
going	c
to	c
try	c
to	c
explain	c
you	i
how	c
.	i

I	c
did	c
n't	c
have	c
a	c
computer	c
until	c
I	c
was	c
eight	c
.	c

Then	c
my	c
brother	c
and	c
I	c
started	c
to	c
develop	c
a	c
new	c
ability	c
.	c

In	i
that	c
time	c
I	c
used	c
the	c
computer	c
only	c
to	c
play	c
with	i
its	i
video	c
games	c
.	c

It	c
became	c
scencial	i
to	c
do	i
my	c
homework	c
.	c

One	c
day	c
my	c
mother	c
got	c
a	c
terrible	c
disease	c
.	c

She	c
had	c
to	c
be	c
operated	c
on	c
and	c
my	c
family	c
and	c
I	c
were	c
very	c
scared	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
if	c
my	c
mother	c
had	c
got	c
ill	c
ten	c
years	c
before	c
,	c
she	c
would	c
n't	c
survive	i
.	c

The	i
modern	i
technology	c
is	c
better	c
now	c
than	c
what	i
it	c
used	c
to	c
be	c
.	c

What	c
do	c
you	c
think	c
about	c
this	c
?	c

I	c
'm	c
sure	c
that	c
these	c
arguments	c
have	c
explained	c
my	c
point	c
of	c
view	c
,	c
have	c
n't	c
they	c
?	c

Ryan	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
staying	i
in	c
a	c
tent	c
rather	c
than	c
staying	c
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
in	c
order	c
to	c
have	c
experience	i
,	i
which	c
I	c
have	c
n't	c
had	c
before	c
.	c

I	c
also	c
have	c
qualifications	c
to	c
teach	c
them	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
to	c
all	c
this	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
appriciate	i
it	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
let	c
me	c
have	c
more	c
details	c
about	c
clothes	c
and	c
how	c
much	c
I	c
shall	c
be	c
paid	c
for	c
the	c
travel	i

Introduction	c

Speaking	c
class	c
should	c
be	c
filmed	c
.	c

A	i
number	c
of	c
forigen	i
students	c
have	i
recently	c
been	c
increasing	c
.	c

School	c
trips	c

It	c
is	c
also	c
thought	c
that	c
school	c
trips	c
are	c
to	c
be	c
filmed	c
because	c
it	i
is	i
a	c
wide	c
range	c
of	c
interesting	c
places	c
available	c
.	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
recommened	i
that	c
speaking	c
classes	c
and	c
school	c
trips	c
should	c
be	c
filmed	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
giving	c
me	c
the	c
oportunity	i
to	c
travel	c

Travelling	c
in	c
July	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
say	c
,	c
would	c
be	c
perfect	c
for	c
me	c
because	c
I	i
have	i
got	i
my	i
birtday	i
the	c
24th	c
of	c
this	i
month	c
and	c
I	c
wish	c
I	i
could	i
spend	i
my	c
birtday	i
as	i
well	i
as	i
possible	c
,	c
so	c
it	i
means	c
there	c
.	c

Painting	c
and	c
swimming	c
are	c
my	c
way	i
to	c
spend	i
a	c
good	c
time	c
especially	i
on	c
holiday	c

Even	c
people	c
who	c

lots	c
of	c

Enjoying	c
shopping	c
is	c
n't	c
the	i
reason	c
for	c
doing	c
that	i

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
:	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
.	c

The	c
show	c
should	c
have	c
started	c
at	c
half	c
past	c
seven	c
but	c
we	c
had	c
to	c
wait	c
for	c
forty-five	c
minutes	c
without	c
any	c
kind	c
of	c
explanation	c
.	c

Not	c
only	c
was	c
the	c
show	c
late	c
and	c
awful	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
expensive	c
too	c
.	c

The	c
advertisement	c
said	c
there	c
were	c
discounts	c
available	c
but	c
when	c
we	c
arrived	c
there	c
the	c
woman	c
who	c
sells	c
the	c
tickets	c
told	c
us	c
the	c
discounts	c
were	c
only	c
available	c
on	c
Monday	c
evenings	c
.	c

Despite	c
the	c
terrible	c
evening	c
we	c
decided	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
to	c
relax	c
and	c
have	c
dinner	c
,	c
but	c
we	c
found	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
its	c
floor	c
was	c
being	c
repaired	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
can	c
see	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
a	c
perfect	c
evening	c
at	c
all	c
!	c

That	c
is	c
why	c
I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
.	c

I	c
want	c
you	c
to	c
give	c
our	i
money	c
back	c
because	c
the	c
things	c
published	c
in	c
your	c
advertisement	c
are	c
n't	c
true	c
.	c

There	c
should	c
be	c
no	c
problem	c
as	c
I	c
still	c
have	c
the	c
tickets	c

Best	c
Detective	c
Stories	c

Agatha	c

Dear	c
Matt	c
:	c

It	c
's	c
been	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
since	c
I	c
last	c
wrote	c
you	i
!	c

I	c
'm	c
always	c
very	c
busy	c
traveling	i
from	c
one	c
country	c
to	c
another	c
,	c
you	c
know	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
now	c
because	c
I	c
've	c
been	c
told	c
that	c
is	i
going	i
to	i
be	i
read	i
on	i
the	i
radio	i
a	i
short	i
story	i
by	i
Agatha	i
Christie	i
.	c

The	c
story	c
is	c
about	c
the	i
life	c
in	c
a	c
small	c
village	c
.	c

That	c
woman	c
is	c
supposed	c
to	c
have	c
killed	c
her	c
husbands	c
(	c
at	c
least	c
two	c
)	c
,	c
because	c
she	c
wanted	c
their	c
money	c
.	c

The	c
policeman	c
lets	c
her	c
know	c
he	c
has	c
discovered	c
her	c
and	c
he	c
wo	c
n't	c
allow	c
another	c
crime	c
.	c

He	c
threatens	c
to	c
tell	c
her	c
husband	c
what	c
she	c
had	c
done	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
she	c
's	c
a	c
very	c
clever	c
woman	c
and	c
she	c
does	c
n't	c
look	c
worried	c

There	c
will	c
be	c
a	c
horrible	c
accident	c
in	c
a	c
few	c
seconds	c

Best	c
wishes	c

Dear	c
Sirs	c

We	c
have	c
spent	c
a	c
week	c
's	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
and	c
wanted	c
to	c
see	c
a	c
musical	c
show	i
.	c

We	c
were	c
very	c
disappointed	c
to	c
hear	c
that	c
the	c
actor	c
was	c
replaced	c
by	c
other	i
at	i
the	c
last	c
minute	c
.	c

The	c
advertisement	c
said	c
that	c
it	c
starts	c
at	c
19.30	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
started	i
actually	i
at	c
20:15	c
due	c
to	c
the	i
probleme	i
of	i
the	c
sound	c
.	c

We	c
were	c
also	c
surprised	c
to	c
discover	c
that	c
the	c
student	c
discounts	c
was	i
n't	i
available	c
for	c
us	c
,	c
because	c
they	c
did	c
n't	c
accept	c
our	c
student	c
indentity	i
card	i
from	c
Switzerland	c
.	c

We	c
were	c
very	c
frustrated	c
to	c
read	c
on	c
the	c
door	c
of	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
"	c
Close	i
due	c
to	c
holidays	c
"	c
specially	i
when	c
we	c
were	c
very	i
starving	c
.	c

This	c
evening	c
was	c
a	c
waste	c
of	c
time	c
.	c

So	c
we	c
asked	i
you	c
for	c
our	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

How	c
has	c
modern	c
technology	c
changed	c
your	c
daily	c
life	c
?	c

Could	c
you	c
figure	c
out	c
how	c
your	c
life	c
will	i
be	c
without	c
all	i
the	i
modern	c
technology	c
?	c

What	c
is	c
the	c
effect	c
of	i
it	c
in	i
your	c
environement	i
?	c

Were	c
the	i
people	c
happier	c
in	c
a	i
past	c
than	c
to	i
day	i
?	c

Nowadays	c
,	c
the	i
technology	c
takes	c
a	i
large	c
place	i
in	i
your	c
daily	c
life	c
and	c
improves	c
the	c
speed	c
of	c
the	i
achievement	i
.	c

For	c
example	c
at	c
work	c
,	c
we	c
look	c
on	i
the	c
computer	c
screen	c
all	c
day	c
,	c
sending	c
e-mail	c
at	i
the	c
other	c
side	c
of	c
the	c
world	c
,	c
doing	c
some	c
searches	i
etc.	c
We	c
gain	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
time	c
with	c
computer	i
,	c
but	c
if	c
your	c
computer	c
brooks	i
down	c
,	c
you	c
could	c
n't	c
do	c
anything	c
because	c
everything	c
is	c
on	c
it	c
.	c

The	i
technology	i
moves	c
very	c
fast	c
specially	i
in	c
the	c
domaine	i
of	c
transportation	c
.	c

The	c
major	c
probleme	i
for	c
the	c
industry	i
cities	c
is	c
to	c
deal	c
with	c
the	c
bad	c
effect	i
of	c
polution	i
in	i
the	c
environement	i
.	c

A	c
lot	c
of	c
money	c
are	i
involved	c
in	c
research	c
to	c
stop	c
the	c
increasing	i
of	i
polution	i
.	c

To	c
sum	c
up	c
,	c
all	c
the	c
improvements	c
have	i
a	i
price	i
to	i
pay	i
;	i
The	i
condition	c
of	c
the	c
environement	i

We	c
are	c
too	c
reliable	i
at	i
technology	c
today	c

Our	c
children	c
will	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
travel	c
in	i
the	c

as	c
we	c
travel	c

Japan	c

Dear	c
Sir	c

Owing	c
to	c
the	c
bad	c
organisation	c
of	c
the	c
last	c
play	c
that	c
was	c
played	i
in	c
your	c
theatre	c
those	i
last	i
weeks	c
I	i
want	c
to	c
explain	i
you	c
some	i
incorrect	c
information	c
that	c
I	c
found	c
in	c
your	c
advertisement	c
and	i
as	c
a	c
result	c
of	c
it	i
,	i
all	c
the	c
problems	c
that	c
I	c
had	c
.	i

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
if	c
you	c
go	c
to	c
a	c
play	c
and	c
you	c
are	c
watching	c
to	c
see	c
your	c
favourite	c
actor	c
playing	c
a	c
good	c
play	i
and	c
then	c
appears	i
a	c
silly	c
one	c
,	c
who	c
does	c
n't	c
know	c
what	c
to	c
do	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
disappoint	i
at	i
all	i
.	c

Maybe	c
,	c
I	i
could	i
be	i
a	c
good	c
way	c
to	c
get	c
spectators	i
but	c
I	c
'm	c
going	c
to	c
comunicate	i
that	i
to	i
my	c
travel	c
office	i
.	c

When	c
the	c
play	c
was	c
finished	c
I	c
was	c
looking	c
for	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
like	i
on	i
the	i
paper	i
that	i
was	i
on	i
the	i
door	i
was	i
writen	i
,	c
it	c
was	c
too	c
late	c
.	c

I	c
think	i
,	i
that	i
it	i
was	i
n't	i
my	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
so	c
I	c
wait	c
to	c
be	c
payed	i
back	i
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
so	c
she	c
lost	c
all	c
her	c
school	c
friends	c
.	c

All	i
started	c
when	c
she	c
was	c
fifteen	c
,	c
when	c
started	i
a	c
new	c
course	c
on	i
the	c
institute	c
and	c
met	c
some	c
girls	c
that	c
passed	i
the	i
time	c
they	i
would	c
became	i
her	c
friends	c
.	c

Three	c
years	c
passed	c
and	c
like	i
is	c
normal	c
between	c
friends	c
,	c
she	c
knew	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
things	c
about	c
them	c
like	i
her	c
friends	c
knew	c
a	c
lot	c
about	c
her	c

She	c
had	c
to	c
repeat	c
that	c
course	c
and	c
all	c
her	c
friends	c
passed	c
and	c
like	i
is	c
usuall	i
girls	i
from	c
the	c
last	c
course	c
became	c
popular	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
,	c

I	c
was	c
disappointed	c
with	c
it	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
really	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
seeing	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
but	c
actually	i
,	c
starting	i
was	i
not	i
Danny	c
Brook	c
but	c
another	c
person	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
starting	i
time	c
was	c
not	c
19:30	c
but	c
20:15	c
.	c

Also	c
,	c
there	c
was	c
no	c
system	i
that	i
ticket	i
can	i
be	i
discounted	i
.	c

That	c
's	c
nub	i
of	c
my	c
complaints	c
.	c

Thus	c
I	c
spent	i
terrible	i
time	c
-	c
it	c
was	c
waste	i
of	c
time	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
expecting	c
for	i
your	c
reply	c
soon	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

I	c
think	c
after	c
100	c
years	c
,	c
at	c
least	c
something	c
will	c
change	c
in	i
the	i
point	i
that	i
design	c
,	c
material	c
,	c
color	i
,	c
etc	c
.	c

If	i
I	i
pick	i
up	i
the	i
example	c
,	c
Kimono	i
(	c
Japanese	i
traditional	i
cloth	i
)	c
will	c
wear	i
on	i
not	i
only	i
Japan	c
but	c
also	c
another	i
countries	c
in	c
generally	i
.	c

Also	c
it	i
will	i
be	i
only	i
wear	i
but	i
its	i
design	i
,	i
shape	i
might	i
take	i
in	i
casual	i
cloth	i
.	c

If	i
it	i
came	i
true	i
,	i
imagination	i
to	i
make	i
cloth	i
would	i
bigger	i
and	i
could	i
think	i
various	i
design	i
and	i
format	i
.	c

By	i
one	c
country	c
's	c
traditional	c
cloth	i
taking	i
in	i
those	i
of	c
another	c
country	c
,	c
it	i
can	i
born	i
different	i
type	i
and	i
new	i
kind	i
of	i
fashion	i
.	c

However	c
,	c
thinking	i
way	i
that	i
simple	i
is	i
the	i
best	i
will	i
not	i
change	i
.	c

Also	c
,	c
comfortable	c
cloth	c
for	c
person	c
will	c
maintain	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
.	c

I	c
guess	c
the	c
good	c
things	c
will	c
not	c
change	c
forever	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
,	c

Recently	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
week	c
's	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

During	c
my	c
stay	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
The	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
to	c
see	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
"	c
,	c
the	i
"	c
London	c
's	c
newest	c
and	c
best	c
musical	c
show.	c
"	c

I	c
have	c
to	c
admit	c
that	c
was	i
my	c
great	c
mistake	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
there	c
was	c
an	c
old	c
,	c
ugly	c
,	c
and	c
unknown	c
actor	c
in	c
the	c
main	c
part	c
instead	c
of	c
brilliant	i
Danny	c
Brook	c
!	c

Moreover	c
,	c
there	c
were	c
n't	c
any	c
discounts	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
pay	c
much	c
more	c
for	c
my	c
ticket	c
than	c
I	c
had	c
expected	c
.	c

And	c
on	i
the	i
top	i
of	i
everything	i
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
waiters	c
'	c
strike	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
look	c
for	c
another	c
place	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
snack	c
.	c

You	c
can	c
imagine	c
how	c
upset	c
I	c
am	c
at	c
having	c
suffered	c
such	c
discomfort	c
and	c
disappointment	c
.	c

That	c
is	c
why	c
I	c
expect	c
at	c
least	c
half	c
the	c
ticket	c
price	c
back	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
will	c
give	c
this	c
matter	c
your	c
immediate	c
consideration	c
.	c

Otherwise	c
I	c
'll	c
have	c
to	c
apply	c
to	c
court	i
for	c
aid	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

Fashion	c
of	c
the	c
Future	c
.	c

What	c
will	c
clothes	c
be	c
like	c
100	c
years	c
from	c
now	c
?	c

We	c
probably	c
will	c
be	c
wearing	c
dresses	c
made	c
of	c
synthetic	c
artificial	i
cloth	c
in	c
2100	c
.	c

Of	c
course	c
,	c
those	i
new	c
material	i
wo	c
n't	c
be	c
so	c
harmful	c
for	i
our	c
health	c
as	c
today	c
's	c
nylon	c
and	c
other	c
things	c
like	c
that	c
.	c

This	c
tendency	c
may	c
result	c
in	c
turning	i
down	i
synthetics	c
at	i
all	i
.	c

Anyway	c
,	c
we	c
'll	c
give	c
up	c
wearing	c
fur	c
coats	c
as	c
it	c
is	c
cruel	c
and	c
uncivilised	c
.	c

I	c
saw	c
the	c
performance	c
and	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
like	i
it	c
was	c
mentioned	i
in	c
the	c
advertisent	i
I	c
read	c
in	c
the	c
local	c
newspaper	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
the	c
main	c
actor	c
was	c
not	c
Dany	c
Brook	c
as	c
it	i
was	c
expected	c
so	i
.	c

Secondly	c
it	c
must	i
have	i
started	c
at	c
14.30	c
and	c
ended	c
by	c
19.30	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
20.15	c
.	c

Then	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
planning	c
to	c
buy	c
three	c
Â£	c
20	c
tickets	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
mention	i
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
that	c
there	c
were	c
dicounts	i
available	c
but	c
that	c
was	c
not	c
true	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
just	i
could	i
buy	c
two	c
tickets	c
and	c
my	c
son	c
could	c
not	c
see	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

What	c
was	c
suposed	i
to	c
be	c
a	c
perfect	c
and	c
enjoyable	c
evening	c
,	c
resulted	c
in	c
a	c
very	c
disappointing	c
time	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Computers	c
,	c
radio	c
,	c
CD	i
's	i
,	c
sattelite	i
television	c
and	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
other	c
things	c
have	c
changed	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
.	c

Modern	c
technology	c
affects	c
the	c
way	c
things	c
are	c
done	c
and	c
many	c
aspects	c
in	i
my	c
life	c
,	c
and	c
it	c
has	c
some	c
advantages	c
as	c
some	i
disadvantages	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
one	c
hand	c
,	c
technology	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
help	c
for	c
me	c
at	c
school	c
.	c

What	c
I	c
mean	c
is	c
that	c
computers	c
are	c
very	c
useful	c
to	i
do	i
my	c
homework	c
(	c
like	c
some	c
monographies	i
or	c
researching	i
)	c
.	c

And	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
even	c
think	c
about	i
how	i
it	c
would	c
be	c
not	i
having	c
a	c
computer	c
.	c

Another	c
advatage	i
is	c
that	c
,	c
for	c
example	c
sattelite	i
television	c
,	c
which	c
is	c
an	c
example	c
of	c
modern	c
technology	c
,	c
makes	i
me	c
be	i
informed	c
about	c
what	c
is	c
happening	c
on	i
the	c
whole	c
world	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
admit	c
that	c
technology	c
makes	c
things	c
so	c
easy	c
that	c
when	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
do	c
them	c
without	c
it	c
I	c
find	c
it	c
very	c
difficult	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
to	c
that	c
,	c
technology	c
does	i
n't	i
sometimes	i
let	c
me	c
develop	c
my	c
imagination	c
and	c
creative	c
skills	c
.	c

My	c
mother	c
says	c
that	c
I	c
'm	c
always	c
playing	c
with	c
my	c
computer	c
or	c
watching	c
T.V.	c
instead	c
of	c
reading	c
or	c
doing	c
some	c
more	c
interesting	c
activities	c
.	c

To	c
sump	i
up	c
,	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
think	c
about	i
how	i
my	c
life	c
would	c
be	c
without	i
technology	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Ryan	c
,	c

You	c
can	c
guess	c
how	c
an	i
enjoyable	i
surprise	i
receiving	c
your	c
letter	c
was	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

After	c
considering	c
your	c
accomodation	i
offers	c
,	c
I	c
'd	c
rather	c
stay	c
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
if	c
possible	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
have	c
no	c
doubt	c
about	c
my	c
taste	c
for	c
camping	c
,	c
however	c
I	i
admit	c
I	c
will	c
appreciate	c
a	c
bit	c
of	c
comfort	c
two	i
weeks	i
long	i
.	c

On	c
the	c
one	c
hand	c
,	c
I	c
own	c
a	c
camera	c
that	c
I	c
often	c
use	c
during	c
leisure	i
times	i
.	c

Even	c
if	c
the	c
photograph	i
made	i
are	c
modest	c
work	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
really	c
interested	c
in	c
this	c
activity	c
.	c

Then	c
,	c
as	c
low	c
my	i
level	c
of	c
basketball	i
is	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
enjoyed	c
playing	c
this	c
sport	c
for	c
fun	c
for	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	i

What	c
obviously	i
appears	i
about	c
our	c
daily	c
life	c
at	c
school	c
is	c
that	c
it	c
is	c
hard	c
to	c
sum	c
up	c
all	c
the	c
different	c
aspects	c
it	c
includes	c
.	c

Therefore	c
,	c
the	c
film	c
will	c
manage	c
to	c
be	c
a	c
success	c
if	c
it	c
does	c
n't	c
forget	c
the	c
main	c
times	i
that	c
make	c
our	c
life	c
.	c

To	c
my	c
mind	c
,	c
the	c
class	c
attending	c
a	c
lesson	c
must	c
be	c
shown	c
at	i
first	c
.	c

Next	c
,	c
students	c
during	c
the	c
pause	i
in	c
the	c
yard	c
should	c
be	c
filmed	c
.	c

It	c
would	c
not	c
only	c
emphasize	c
the	c
sharp	c
contrast	c
with	i
the	i
classroom	c
atmosphear	i
but	c
also	c
show	c
how	c
they	c
are	c
as	c
young	c
people	c
.	c

Students	c
chatting	c
,	c
laughing	c
,	c
eating	c
and	c
even	c
smoking	c
must	c
remain	c
in	c
the	c
video	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
two	c
moments	c
could	c
have	c
a	c
role	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
the	c
arrive	i
of	c
every	c
students	i
,	c
namely	i
the	i
picture	i
of	i
the	i
school	i
without	i
anybody	i
at	i
first	i
,	i
and	i
then	i
with	i
the	i
crowd	i
of	i
students	i
increasing	i
gradually	i
is	i
typical	i
of	i
its	i
life	i

Dear	c
sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

I	c
have	c
recently	c
had	c
a	c
week	c
's	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
and	c
,	c
during	c
my	c
stay	c
,	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
'	c
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
'	c
,	c
which	c
was	c
shown	c
at	c
your	c
theatre	c
.	c

On	c
top	c
of	c
everyting	i
,	c
the	c
restaurant	c
which	c
was	c
announced	i
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
being	c
arranged	i
.	c

You	c
can	c
imagine	c
how	c
dissappointed	i
I	c
felt	c
after	c
that	c
evening	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
for	c
a	c
further	i
return	i
of	c
part	c
of	c
the	c
money	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
modern	c
technology	c
has	c
n't	c
changed	c
my	c
life	c
a	c
lot	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
has	c
in	c
some	c
things	c
:	c
I	c
work	c
with	c
music	c
and	c
with	c
graphic	c
design	c
too	c
,	c
and	c
computers	c
help	c
me	c
a	c
lot	c
in	i
this	i
things	c
.	c

In	c
music	c
,	c
before	c
having	i
a	c
computer	c
I	c
could	c
only	c
write	c
my	c
compositions	c
and	c
'	c
listen	c
'	c
to	c
them	c
into	i
my	c
mind	c
,	c
because	c
,	c
of	c
course	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
n't	c
got	c
an	c
orchestra	c
to	c
play	c
them	c
,	c
but	c
now	c
I	c
just	i
can	i
record	c
one	c
part	c
,	c
and	c
then	c
another	c
part	c
,	c
and	c
then	c
another	c
one.	c
.	c

In	c
graphic	c
design	c
,	c
before	c
having	i
a	c
computer	c
I	c
just	i
could	i
draw	c
,	c
but	c
now	c
I	c
can	c
create	c
pictures	c
pixel	c
by	c
pixel	c
,	c
develop	c
ideas	c
more	c
easily	c
,	c
or	c
take	i
photographs	c
into	c
my	c
computer	c
and	c
transform	c
them	c
or	c
mix	c
them	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
have	c
happily	c
received	c
your	c

I	c
want	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
this	c
marvelous	i
prize	c
you	c
have	c
given	c
me	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
because	c
I	c
think	c
you	c
should	c
give	i
me	c
a	i
good	c
accommodation	c
and	c
not	c
just	c
a	c
tent	c
to	c
sleep	c
in	c
,	c
with	c
no	c
electricity	c
and	i
entertainment	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
play	c
basketball	c
and	c
tennis	c
for	i
you	i
.	c

At	i
tennis	c
I	c
'm	c
the	c
best	c
player	c
of	i
my	c
whole	c
school	c
and	c
once	i
,	c
I	c
got	c
to	i
the	c
top	c
10	c
of	c
my	c
country	i
in	i
tennis	c

Would	c
$	c
200	c
be	c
enough	c
?	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Dear	c
Kim	c

How	c
are	c
you	c
?	c

I	c
have	c
just	c
received	c
your	c
letter	c
and	c
let	c
me	c
tell	c
you	c
what	c
you	c
missed	c
over	c
here	c
.	c

You	c
should	c
have	c
been	c
here	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
amazing	c
.	c

We	c
had	c
to	c
climb	c
up	c
to	c
15m	c
to	c
put	c
up	c
those	c
lights	c
and	c
afterwards	c
the	c
band	c
did	c
n't	c
even	c
use	c
them	c
.	c

Well	c
,	c
we	c
also	c
had	c
to	c
carry	c
all	c
the	c
instruments	c
up	c
to	i
the	c
stage	c
and	c
believe	i
me	c
,	c
that	c
was	c
the	c
hardest	c
bit	c
of	c
all	c
.	c

They	c
were	c
extremely	c
heavy	c
and	c
there	c
were	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
them	c
on	c
the	c
bus	c
.	c

After	c
helping	c
to	c
do	c
that	c
and	c
many	c
other	c
things	c
,	c
my	c
friends	c
and	c
I	c
watched	c
the	c
concert	c
and	c
before	c
Green	c
day	c
(	c
the	c
group	c
)	c
left	c
,	c
they	c
came	c
up	c
to	c
us	c
an	c
thanked	c
us	c
for	c
all	c
the	c
hard	c
work	c
we	c
did	c
,	c
and	c
shoke	i
our	c
hands	c
.	c

I	c
'll	c
never	c
wash	c
my	c
hands	i
again	c
.	c

Well	c
that	c
's	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
I	c
've	c
got	c
for	c
you	c
now	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Redford	c
,	c

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
problems	c
which	c
were	i
shown	i
at	c
the	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
musical	c
show	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
advertisement	c
I	c
read	c
that	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
started	i
in	c
the	c
show	c
but	c
when	c
I	c
got	c
there	c
I	c
realised	c
there	c
was	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
in	c
his	c
place	c
whose	c
acting	c
was	c
n't	c
good	c
enough	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
also	c
read	c
that	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
start	c
at	c
19:30	c
but	c
it	c
did	c
n't	c
.	c

It	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
leaving	c
us	c
writing	i
for	c
fourty	i
five	c
minutes	c
.	c

You	c
have	c
also	c
advertised	c
that	c
there	c
would	c
be	c
discounts	c
available	c
but	c
there	c
were	c
n't	c
and	c
that	c
we	c
could	c
visit	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
they	c
were	c
redecorating	c
it	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
advertisement	c
you	c
write	c
that	c
it	c
's	c
the	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
but	c
all	c
these	c
problems	c
made	c
my	c
evening	c
in	i
the	c
show	c
very	c
unpleasant	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
are	c
the	c
manager	c
of	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
you	c
should	c
try	c
to	c
avoid	c
this	i
sort	i
of	c
problems	c
in	c
future	c
shows	c
.	c

I	c
also	c
ask	c
to	i
return	c
me	i
some	c
of	c
my	c
money	c
for	c
the	c
unpleasant	c
evening	c
I	c
passed	i
at	c
your	c
show	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
think	c
anyone	c
will	c
wear	c
a	c
suit	c
as	c
it	c
will	c
be	c
old-fashioned	c
.	c

Also	c
I	c
think	c
clothes	c
will	c
have	c
many	c
gadgets	c
on	c
them	c
like	c
a	c
small	c
oxygen	c
mask	c
in	c
case	c
someone	c
goes	c
in	c
a	c
place	c
with	c
extended	i
pollution	c
-	c
I	c
think	c
there	c
will	c
be	c
many	c
such	c
places	c
in	c
a	c
hundred	c
years	c
-	c
and	c
a	c
hat	c
designed	c
to	c
protect	c
people	c
from	c
the	c
strong	c
sunrays	i
of	c
the	c
sun	c
at	c
midday	c
because	c
the	c
ozone	c
layer	c
will	c
be	c
destroyed	c
in	c
a	c
hundred	c
years	c
and	c
the	c
sunrays	c
will	c
make	i
damage	c
to	c
the	c
human	c
skin	c
.	c

Also	c
the	c
clothes	c
in	c
a	c
hundred	c
years	c
will	c
have	c
the	c
ability	c
to	c
cool	c
down	c
the	c
people	c
who	c
wear	c
them	c
in	c
the	c
summer	c
and	c
the	c
same	c
clothes	c
will	c
keep	c
them	c
warm	c
in	i
cold	c
winters	c
'	c
days	c
.	c

With	c
reference	c
to	c
the	c
date	c
,	c
I	c
only	i
can	i
go	c
on	i
July	c
,	c
as	c
I	c
'm	c
going	c
off	c
on	c
holiday	c
on	i
August	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
start	c
university	c
on	i
September	c
.	c

The	c
place	c
I	c
'd	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
is	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
,	c
where	c
I	c
'm	c
sure	c
I	c
'd	c
feel	c
more	c
confortable	i
than	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
very	c
nice	c
of	c
you	c
to	c
let	c
me	c
choose	c
my	c
favourite	c
activities	c
.	c

Anyway	c
,	c
there	c
are	c
some	c
questions	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
:	c
What	i
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
would	c
be	c
the	c
most	c
suitable	c
for	c
California	c
weather	c
in	c
summer	c
,	c
and	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
do	c
you	c
think	c
I	c
'll	c
need	c
?	c

I	c
'm	c
waiting	i
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
so	c
sorry	c
I	c
have	c
n't	c
written	c
until	c
now	c
,	c
but	c
you	c
know	c
I	c
'm	c
always	c
very	c
busy	c
.	c

As	c
I	c
told	c
you	c
in	c
my	c
last	c
letter	c
,	c
last	c
month	c
I	c
worked	c
for	c
a	c
pop	c
band	c
,	c
and	c
helped	c
them	c
at	c
a	c
concert	c
in	c
Barcelona	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
such	c
a	c
great	c
experience	c
!	c

Basically	c
my	c
work	c
was	c
carrying	c
the	c
instruments	c
,	c
the	c
speakers	c
and	c
the	c
lights	c
from	c
the	c
vans	c
to	c
the	c
stage	c
,	c
which	c
is	c
not	c
an	i
easy	c
work	c
because	c
,	c
as	c
you	c
can	c
imagine	c
,	c
it	c
's	c
not	c
exactly	c
light	c
stuff	c
.	c

But	c
the	c
most	c
exciting	c
part	c
was	c
meeting	c
the	c
band	c
,	c
mainly	c
the	c
singer	c
and	c
the	c
drummer	c
who	c
are	c
very	c
nice	c
and	c
also	c
good-looking	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
they	c
call	c
me	c
soon	c
,	i
I	c
'd	c
be	c
the	c
happiest	c
girl	c
in	c
the	c
world	c
if	c
I	c
could	c
see	c
them	c
again	c
...	c

I	c
'd	c
better	c
leave	i
now	c
.	c

Dear	c
Madam	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	i
only	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
set	i
my	c
holidays	c
this	i
month	c
since	c
last	c
January	c
.	c

I	i
want	i
if	i
it	i
is	i
possible	i
a	c
log	i
cabins	i
like	i
accommodation	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
suffering	c
from	i
my	c
back	c
since	c
my	c
childhood	c
,	c
therefore	c
I	c
need	c
a	c
confortable	i
accommodation	i
.	c

Otherwise	i
,	i
could	i
you	c
tell	c
me	c
approximately	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
for	c
the	i
food	c
,	c
please	c
?	c

Yours	c
sincerely	i
.	c

How	c
many	c
times	c
have	c
we	c
heard	c
people	c
complaining	c
about	c
shopping	c
?	c

Sometimes	c
,	c
they	c
are	c
happy	c
to	c
do	i
shopping	c
.	i

but	c
why	c
?	c

Shopping	c
is	c
enjoyable	c
when	c
you	c
want	c
to	c
offer	i
some	i
thing	i
to	c
someone	c
.	c

Shopping	c
is	c
also	c
good	c
,	i
when	c
you	c
know	c
what	c
you	c
want	c
.	c

In	i
the	i
opposite	i
,	c
shopping	c
can	c
be	c
disenjoyable	i
.	c

That	c
is	c
to	c
say	c
,	c
they	c
are	c
never	c
happy	c
with	c
what	c
they	c
get	c
and	i
see	c
.	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
enjoyable	c
with	c
people	c
who	c
just	c
look	c
around	c
the	c
shops	c
.	c

To	c
conclude	c
,	c
I	c
agree	c
with	i
shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
you	i
in	i
relation	i
to	i
our	c
next	c
programme	c
in	c
London	c
from	c
13th	c
March	c
to	c
14th	c
March	c
.	c

First	c
at	i
all	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
pleasure	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
the	c
programme	c
which	c
you	c
so	c
kindly	c
have	c
prepared	c
is	c
very	c
interesting	c
,	c
especially	c
the	c
visit	c
to	c
the	c
National	c
Art	c
Gallery	c
on	c
Wednesday	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
our	c
class	c
has	c
recently	c
read	i
an	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
which	i
takes	c
place	c
during	c
our	c
visit	c
to	c
London	c
,	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
14th	c
.	c

We	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
if	c
it	c
could	i
be	c
possible	c
to	c
introduce	c
a	c
little	c
change	c
in	c
our	c
programme	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
will	c
consider	c
our	c
suggestion	c
.	c

How	i
will	i
be	i
our	i
future	i
homes	i
?	i

Believe	c
it	c
or	c
not	c
,	c
our	c
lives	c
are	c
changing	c
and	c
becoming	c
more	c
complicated	c
every	c
day	c
.	c

The	c
reason	c
of	i
all	c
of	c
this	c
things	i
is	c
the	c
impressionable	i
introduction	c
of	c
the	c
"	c
new	c
technologies	c
"	c
,	c
such	c
as	c
Computers	i
,	c
Internet	i
or	c
WAP	c
technologies	c
.	c

Of	c
course	c
,	c
this	i
new	c
facilities	i
will	c
be	c
introduced	c
at	c
home	c
.	c

Now	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
already	c
possible	c
to	c
send	i
our	i
shopping	i
list	i
by	c
the	i
computer	c
,	c
and	c
this	c
opption	i
,	c
in	c
the	c
next	c
years	i
,	c
will	c
become	c
the	c
most	c
common	c
once	i
.	c

The	c
new	c
technologies	c
probably	i
will	i
produce	c
a	c
considerably	i
revolution	c
in	c
some	c
essencial	i
parts	c
of	c
the	c
house	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
we	c
will	c
have	c
got	i
computerizated	i
ovens	c
,	c
microwaves	c
and	c
freezers	c
,	c
or	c
we	c
will	c
probably	c
have	c
got	i
central	c
heating	c
controled	i
through	c
Internet	i
from	c
our	c
office	c
.	c

And	c
to	c
read	c
the	c
newspaper	c
at	c
breakfast	c
instead	c
of	c
watching	c
TV	c
?	c

We	c
are	c
human	c
beings	c
at	i
least	i
,	c
not	c
"	c
new	c
technological	c
"	c
machines	c
!	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
,	c

To	c
begin	c
with	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
.	c

This	c
is	c
the	c
only	c
possible	c
time	c
for	c
me	c
,	c
as	c
the	c
school	c
holiday	c
starts	c
on	c
the	c
29th	c
of	c
June	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
log	c
cabins	c
are	c
more	c
comportable	i
than	c
tents	c
.	c

Last	i
not	i
least	i
,	c
I	c
always	c
have	c
backache	c
after	c
sleeping	c
in	c
a	c
tent	c
for	c
a	c
couple	c
of	c
days	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
whether	c
there	c
is	i
some	c
facilities	c
for	c
washing	c
the	i
Clothes	c
.	c

Lastly	c
,	c
does	c
the	c
prize	c
include	c
pocket	c
money	c
?	c

If	c
not	c
,	c
I	c
will	c
have	c
to	c
bring	c
some	c
with	c
me	c
.	c

Is	c
there	c
a	c
possibility	c
of	c
exchanging	c
different	c
currancies	i
to	c
US	c
dollar	i
?	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
.	c

It	c
sounds	c
nice	c
and	c
shopping	c
is	c
great	c
fun	c
-	c
or	c
it	c
should	c
be	c
.	c

Nowadays	c
shopping	c
can	c
be	c
very	c
stressful	c
.	c

Nevertheless	c
,	c
the	c
nightmare	c
starts	c
when	c
you	c
enter	c
the	c
shopping	c
mall	c
or	c
the	c
passage	c
,	c
which	c
is	c
terribly	c
crowded	c
.	c

You	c
cannot	c
make	c
a	c
step	c
without	c
"	c
touching	c
"	c
the	i
others	c
.	c

It	c
gets	c
enormously	c
unbearable	c
in	i
hot	c
summer	c
days	c
,	c
when	c
the	c
temperature	c
increases	c
.	c

But	c
the	c
worst	c
moment	c
comes	c
,	i
if	c
you	c
cannot	c
find	c
the	c
thing	c
you	c
were	c
looking	c
for	c
,	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
no	c
longer	c
trendy	c
or	c
because	c
it	c
is	c
sold	c
out	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Smith	c
,	c

Last	c
week	c
I	i
and	i
my	i
family	i
had	c
a	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

At	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
a	i
holiday	c
we	c
decided	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
.	c

That	c
days	i
you	c
presented	i
,,The	c
over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
.	c

how	i
you	c
have	c
written	c
at	i
the	c
advertisement	c
:	c
it	c
is	c
the	i
London	c
's	c
newest	c
and	c
best	c
musical	c
show	c
.	c

Because	i
,	c
at	i
first	i
,	c
at	i
the	i
advertisement	i
was	i
written	i
that	c
in	i
this	c
music	c
show	c
would	c
play	i
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
so	c
.	c

Then	c
at	i
the	c
adverstisement	i
stood	i
that	c
performance	i
begin	i
at	c
19.30	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
very	c
nervious	i
.	c

But	c
why	c
do	c
you	c
mention	c
about	c
the	c
restaurant	c
at	i
the	c
advertisement	c
,	c
if	c
it	c
is	c
closed	c
?	c

It	c
broke	i
all	c
my	c
impression	c
about	i
London	c
.	c

And	c
now	c
I	c
requere	i
my	c
money	c
back	c
.	c

Because	c
of	i
nothing	i
what	i
was	i
mentioned	i
at	i
the	i
advertisement	i
I	i
did	i
n't	i
get	i
.	c

There	c
are	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
new	c
modern	c
technologies	c
around	c
the	c
world	c
,	c
which	c
appear	i
not	c
long	c
ago	c
.	c

Among	c
them	c
a	i
mobile	c
telephone	c
,	c
computers	c
,	c
telefaxes	c
,	c
different	c
mashiens	i
for	c
kitchen	i
,	c
mashiens	i
which	c
helps	i
housekeeper	i
to	c
do	c
any	c
work	c
about	c
the	c
house	c
.	c

All	c
of	c
them	c
play	c
a	c
very	c
great	c
role	c
in	c
people	c
's	c
daily	c
life	c
.	c

The	c
first	c
change	c
is	c
that	c
they	c
very	i
simplify	c
the	c
life	c
of	c
people	c
.	c

They	c
can	c
only	i
push	i
on	c
their	c
dish	i
mashiens	i
and	c
go	c
to	c
do	c
something	c
what	i
they	c
think	c
more	c
pleasant	c
.	c

So	c
with	c
the	c
appearance	c
of	c
new	c
morden	i
technology	c
people	c
have	c
got	c
much	c
more	c
free	c
time	c
.	c

The	c
computer	c
also	c
plays	c
a	c
very	c
important	c
role	c
in	c
daily	i
life	c
of	c
people	c
.	c

Some	c
years	c
ago	c
people	c
especially	i
students	c
had	i
to	c
run	c
to	c
lubraries	i
in	c
order	c
to	c
find	c
a	c
book	c
about	c
something	c
.	c

Very	i
often	i
I	i
use	i
Internet	i
,	c
and	c
I	c
must	c
say	c
it	c
is	c
very	c
convienient	i
.	c

If	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
say	c
something	c
important	c
to	c
my	c
parents	c
or	c
my	c
friends	c
,	c
of	i
if	c
something	c
terriable	i
has	c
happened	c
with	i
me	c
,	c
I	c
may	i
not	i
run	c
somewhere	c
to	c
find	c
a	c
telephone	c
box	c
.	c

I	c
just	c
use	c
my	c
mobile	c
phone	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
say	c
that	c
modern	c
technologies	i
very	i
help	i
people	c
at	i
their	c
works	i
.	c

During	c
a	c
week	c
's	c
holiday	c
I	c
had	c
in	c
London	c
,	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
see	c
your	c
last	c
musical	c
show	c
called	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
"	c
at	c
The	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
to	c
say	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
the	c
best	c
musical	c
show	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
was	c
pretty	c
bad	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
a	c
very	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
for	c
many	c
reasons	c
.	c

In	c
fact	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
instead	c
of	c
19:30	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
enbelievable	i
to	i
be	i
late	i
with	i
45	i
minutes	i
.	c

When	c
I	c
got	c
to	c
the	c
tickets	i
desk	i
before	c
the	c
show	c
to	c
buy	c
my	c
ticket	c
I	c
asked	c
for	c
a	c
senior	c
discount	c
,	c
and	c
the	c
woman	c
told	c
me	c
there	c
were	c
no	c
discounts	c
available	c
as	i
I	c
read	i
on	c
the	c
advertising	i
.	c

After	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
restaurant	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
drink	c
after	c
all	c
of	c
these	c
disappointments	c
,	c
but	c
the	c
doors	c
were	c
close	c
because	c
of	c
renovations	c
.	c

Best	c
Regards	c
,	c

Once	c
I	c
was	c
on	c
vacation	c
with	c
her	c
in	c
America	c
,	c
in	c
Chicago	c
to	c
be	c
exact	c
.	c

We	c
had	i
mostly	i
a	c
wonderful	c
time	c
.	c

We	c
went	c
there	c
3	c
years	c
ago	c
and	c
I	c
had	i
only	c
19	c
years	c
old	c
as	i
everyone	c
know	i
that	i
the	c
majority	i
for	i
beeing	i
able	c
to	c
go	c
out	c
in	c
the	c
USA	c
is	i
21	c
years	c
old	c
.	c

So	c
one	c
night	c
Pat	c
,	c
who	c
was	c
5	c
years	c
older	c
than	c
I	c
,	c
and	c
me	i
decided	c
to	c
go	c
out	i
in	i
a	c
bar	c
even	c
if	c
we	c
knew	c
I	c
was	c
n't	c
allowed	c
in	c
it	i
.	c

The	c
man	c
said	c
it	c
was	c
OK	c
for	i
this	c
time	c
and	c
we	c
get	i
in	c
quite	c
easely	i
,	c
we	i
've	i
made	c
it	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
such	c
a	i
fun	c
,	c
we	c
met	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
different	c
people	c
,	c
we	c
danced	c
,	c
we	c
had	c
a	c
wonderful	c
time	c
.	c

Of	c
course	c
by	c
the	c
time	c
we	c
get	i
in	i
it	c
we	c
forgot	i
all	c
the	c
stuff	c
about	c
the	c
majority	c
.	c

The	c
barman	c
asked	c
me	c
my	c
age	c
and	c
Pat	c
told	c
him	c
without	c
thinking	c
any	i
time	i
19	c
years	c
old	c
!	c

The	c
manager	c
came	c
,	c
he	c
called	c
the	c
police	c
and	c
the	c
beginning	c
of	c
a	c
great	c
evening	c
,	i
ending	i
with	c
a	c
night	c
in	c
jail	c
and	c
an	c
expensive	c
fine	c
!	c

Thank	c
you	c
Pat	c
for	c
keeping	c
so	i
well	i
a	i
secret	i
!	c
!	c

I	c
've	c
just	c
seen	c
your	c
letter	c
and	c
I	c
'm	c
really	c
delighted	c
to	c
have	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
it	c
's	c
the	c
only	c
month	c
I	c
have	c
two	c
weeks	i
holiday	c
during	c
the	c
summer	c
.	c

While	c
I	i
'll	i
be	i
at	c
the	c
Camp	i
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
play	c
tennis	c
and	c
swimming	i
.	c

I	c
'm	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
swimming	c
and	c
my	c
level	c
is	i
medium	i
at	c
tennis	c
.	c

If	c
possible	c
,	c
could	c
you	c
let	c
me	c
know	c
what	c
I	c
'll	c
need	c
for	i
example	c
which	i
clothes	c
I	c
must	c
take	c
and	c
how	c
much	c
I	c
can	c
expect	c
to	c
spend	c
.	i

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

At	c
first	c
,	c
I	i
'd	i
helped	i
them	c
to	c
carry	c
the	c
material	i
and	c
we	c
had	i
fixed	i
everything	c
in	c
the	c
good	i
order	c
.	c

At	c
the	c
end	c
,	c
we	c
have	i
had	i
a	c
beer	c
and	c
we	c
talked	c
together	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
astonished	c
to	c
see	c
so	i
friendly	c
and	c
funny	c
they	c
were	c
and	c
we	c
got	i
good	c
friends	c
.	c

If	c
possible	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
introduce	i
you	c
to	c
them	c
,	i
they	i
are	c
very	c
nice	c
guys	c
.	c

During	c
my	c
last	c
holiday	c
week	i
in	c
London	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
after	c
reading	c
the	c
advertisement	c
of	i
the	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
"	c
show	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
in	i
the	c
advertisement	c
was	i
written	c
,	c
as	c
I	c
had	c
read	c
that	i
before	c
,	c
that	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
would	c
be	c
starring	c
in	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

The	i
time	i
of	i
the	i
beginning	i
of	i
the	i
show	i
was	c
written	c
at	i
half	c
past	c
two	c
p.m.	c
and	c
at	i
half	c
past	c
seven	c
that	c
evening	c
,	c
again	c
.	c

Lack	c
of	c
my	i
time	c
made	c
me	c
to	i
go	i
at	i
the	c
evening	c
show	c
.	c

No	c
,	c
alas	c
in	i
reality	c
it	c
appeared	c
a	i
mistake	c
.	c

That	c
appeared	c
impossible	c
,	c
because	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

That	c
was	c
n't	c
enough	c
yet	i
.	c

At	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
the	c
advertisement	c
as	i
I	c
noticed	c
it	c
was	i
said	i
something	c
of	i
perfect	i
evening	c
out	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
n't	c
truth	i
.	c

I	c
was	c
expecting	c
something	c
really	i
better	c
.	c

Yours	c
faitully	i

I	c
believe	c
,	c
living	c
in	c
a	c
modern	c
country	c
,	c
that	c
science	c
and	c
technology	c
affected	i
any	i
aspect	c
of	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
.	c

Looking	c
back	c
in	i
the	c
past	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
see	c
,	i
how	c
big	c
difference	i
is	i
between	c
life	i
of	c
my	c
grandparents	c
and	c
mine	c
.	c

People	c
living	c
in	c
the	c
past	c
could	c
n't	c
travel	c
so	c
far	i
as	c
we	c
could	i
now	c
and	c
could	c
n't	c
express	i
the	c
news	c
around	c
the	c
world	c
as	c
we	c
do	c
it	i
now	c
,	c
at	i
present	i
days	i
.	c

They	c
could	c
not	c
communicate	c
with	c
someone	c
living	c
in	c
other	i
country	c
,	c
often	i
located	c
far	c
away	c
from	c
his	i
own	c
.	c

Using	c
mobile	c
phones	c
,	c
e-mails	c
or	c
internet	i
,	c
we	c
have	c
a	i
better	c
access	c
to	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
different	c
news	i
.	c

But	c
there	c
are	c
some	c
drawbacks	c
,	c
which	c
appeared	c
last	i
years	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
a	i
lot	c
of	c
pollution	c
has	c
raised	i
.	c

We	c
now	c
breathe	c
worse	c
air	c
in	c
our	c
lungs	c
,	i
then	i
our	c
grand-parents	i
breathed	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
,	i
we	c
are	c
more	c
addicted	c
to	c
do	i
some	c
things	c
,	i
which	c
are	c
not	c
concerned	c
with	c
human	c
nature	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
think	c
and	c
strongly	c
believe	c
,	i
that	c
we	c
are	c
the	i
part	c
of	c
wildlife	i
.	c

And	c
the	c
modern	c
technology	c
that	c
we	c
use	c
in	c
our	c
everyday	c
life	c
might	c
not	c
only	c
help	c
us	c
,	c
but	c
determinly	i
might	c
destroy	c
us	c
.	c

A	c
few	c
students	c
and	c
me	i
have	c
heard	c
about	c
a	c
fashion	c
and	c
leisure	c
show	c
.	c

That	i
show	c
takes	c
place	c
on	c
14th	c
March	c
from	c
10.00	c
-	c
19.00	c
.	c

That	i
show	c
is	c
free	c
for	c
students	c
,	c
so	i
it	i
's	i
also	c
a	c
big	c
advantage	c
.	c

But	c
I	c
have	c
thought	c
about	c
it	c
.	c

On	c
Monday	c
we	c
could	c
first	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
Sience	i
Museum	c
and	c
in	c
the	c
afternoon	c
to	c
Greenwich	c
.	c

Then	c
we	c
could	c
go	c
sightseeing	c
by	c
bus	c
on	c
Wednesday	c
after	c
lunchtime	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Who	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
be	c
famous	c
?	c

It	c
must	c
be	c
wonderful	c
when	c
you	c
have	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
money	c
and	c
everybody	c
seems	c
to	c
know	c
you	c
.	c

Really	i
?	c

That	c
's	c
the	c
price	c
you	c
have	c
to	c
pay	c
nowadays	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
are	c
famous	c
it	i
was	c
your	c
choice	c
and	c
therefore	c
is	i
a	i
price	c
to	i
pay	c
.	c

Everone	i
knows	c
you	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
journalists	c
so	i
ca	i
n't	c
just	c
ignore	c
them	c
,	c
can	c
you	c
?	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
,	c

Besides	c
,	i
we	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
And	i
Leisure	c
Show	c
,	c
which	c
was	c
advertised	c
in	c
the	c
newspaper	i
"	i
Metro	i
"	i
yesterday	c
.	c

All	c
my	c
classmates	c
are	c
very	c
interested	c
in	c
this	c
show	c
,	c
which	c
includes	c
latest	i
fashions	c
,	c
Leisure	i
and	c
sports	c
wear	c
,	c
Make	i
up	i
,	c
and	c
Hair	i
styles	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
important	c
thing	i
for	c
us	c
is	c
that	c
entrance	c
fee	i
is	c
free	c
for	c
students	c
,	c
because	c
students	c
are	c
generally	c
short	c
of	c
money	c
.	c

We	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
suggest	c
you	c
change	c
shopping	i
date	i
to	c
Wednesday	c
afternoon	c
,	c
because	c
we	c
have	c
free	i
time	c
on	c
Wednesday	c
afternoon	c
.	c

We	c
would	c
be	c
very	c
pleased	c
if	c
you	c
could	i
consider	c
our	c
recommendation	c
.	c

Private	i
Life	c
For	c
Everyone	c
.	c

However	c
most	i
famous	c
people	c
,	c
for	c
example	c
football	c
player	i
and	c
film	c
stars	c
,	c
have	c
not	c
got	c
any	i
privet	i
life	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
some	c
people	c
need	c
journalists	c
to	c
be	i
more	c
famous	c
,	c
because	c
people	c
can	i
have	i
news	i
who	i
are	i
famous	i
through	c
journalists	c
.	c

As	i
a	i
result	i
,	c
journalists	c
should	c
respect	c
their	c
life	i
and	c
always	c
write	c
real	i
news	i
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

The	c
second	c
think	i
is	c
that	c
the	c
play	c
did	c
not	c
start	c
at	c
19:30	c
but	c
at	c
20:15	c
!	c

I	c
could	c
not	c
get	c
a	c
discount	c
.	c

At	i
the	i
end	i
I	i
would	c
like	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
my	c
evening	c
out	c
two	c
days	c
before	i
was	c
not	c
perfect	c
and	c
I	c
wold	i
be	c
glad	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
pay	i
my	i
some	i
money	i
back	i
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	i

Modern	c
technology	c
is	c
changing	c
world	i
every	c
day	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
write	c
how	i
it	c
has	c
influented	i
my	c
daily	c
life	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
a	c
student	c
of	i
a	c
technical	c
univercity	i
.	c

Some	c
time	c
before	i
I	c
did	c
not	c
know	c
the	i
internet	i
.	c

When	c
I	c
neaded	i
some	c
informationes	i
I	c
had	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
liblary	i
to	c
find	c
it	c
in	c
books	c
or	c
newspapers	c
.	c

Now	c
the	c
only	c
think	i
I	c
have	c
to	c
do	c
is	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
computer	i
room	c
and	c
turn	c
on	c
the	c
computer	c
.	c

The	c
computer	c
is	c
helpfull	i
when	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
contact	c
somebody	c
very	c
fast	c
.	c

I	c
just	c
send	c
an	c
e-mail	c
and	c
that	c
is	c
all	c
!	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
in	i
behalf	c
of	c
my	c
class-	i
maid	i
about	c
the	c
programme	c
you	c
had	i
organised	c
for	c
us	c
.	c

We	c
all	c
want	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
having	c
choose	i
such	c
good	c
places	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
particularly	c
like	c
to	c
talk	c
about	c
the	c
second	c
day	c
.	c

As	c
you	c
know	c
our	c
class	c
are	i
composed	c
by	i
girls	c
and	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
very	c
exciting	c
for	c
us	c
if	c
we	c
can	i
have	c
a	c
look	c
on	i
the	c
latest	c
fashions	c
,	c
make	i
up	i
and	c
so	c
on	c
.	c

Although	c
we	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
visit	c
the	c
science	c
museum	c
,	c
we	c
can	c
leave	c
it	c
to	c
the	c
next	c
opportunity	c
,	i
what	i
we	c
suggested	i
to	i
do	i
is	c
intead	i
of	c
going	c
to	c
the	c
museum	c
in	c
the	c
morning	c
we	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
Leisure	c
show	i
and	c
keep	c
the	c
afternoon	c
programme	c
the	c
same	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
dangerous	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
knew	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
.	c

We	c
were	c
not	c
allowed	c
to	c
leave	c
out	i
tents	c
during	c
the	c
night	c
or	c
until	c
the	c
day	c
start	i
,	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
dangerous	c
animals	c
which	c
leave	i
there	c
.	c

But	c
for	c
me	c
it	c
was	c
the	c
most	c
exciting	c
moment	c
.	c

One	c
can	c
be	c
really	c
amazed	c
by	c
the	c
view	c
.	c

One	c
day	c
at	c
five	c
o'clock	c
in	c
the	c
morning	c
I	c
stepped	c
out	c
of	c
my	c
tent	c
without	c
seen	i
and	c
started	c
walking	c
towards	c
the	c
river	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
want	i
take	i
some	c
photographs	c
of	c
the	c
sun	i
rise	i
.	c

The	c
view	c
took	i
my	c
breath	c
of	i
when	c
suddenly	c
something	c
took	c
my	c
breath	c
.	i

It	c
was	c
a	c
panther	c

Dear	c
miss	c
Ryan	c
,	c

Since	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
student	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
follow	c
the	c
vacation	c
programm	i
of	c
my	c
school	c
,	c
which	c
means	c
that	c
I	c
would	c
only	c
be	c
able	c
to	c
travel	c
during	c
the	c
month	c
of	c
July	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
be	c
grateful	c
if	c
you	c
could	c
book	c
a	c
tent	c
for	c
me	c
at	c
Camp	c
California	c
because	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
nature	c
lover	c
and	c
the	c
idea	c
of	c
outdoor-sleeping	i
really	c
makes	c
me	c
happy	c
.	c

Concerning	c
the	c
activities	c
,	c
as	i
a	i
matter	i
of	i
fact	i
tennis	c
is	c
my	c
favorit	i
sport	c
and	c
I	c
am	c
very	c
keen	c
on	c
it	c
,	i
for	i
the	c
second	c
activity	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
enroll	i
surfing	i
,	c
because	c
my	c
husband	c
,	c
who	c
is	c
already	c
a	c
proficient	c
,	i
keeps	c
telling	c
me	c
about	c
the	c
excitement	c
of	c
this	c
sport	c
,	c
and	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
worthwile	i
trying	c
,	c
therefore	c
I	c
'd	c
love	c
to	c
be	c
in	c
the	c
beginners	i
group	c
.	c

Once	c
students	c
have	c
taken	c
a	c
shower	c
after	c
a	i
hard	c
physical	c
training	c
they	c
come	i
to	i
real	c
life	c
,	i
depending	i
on	c
their	c
levels	c
they	i
have	c
to	c
study	c
for	i
instance	i
languages	c
wich	i
I	c
personally	c
find	c
very	c
important	c
for	c
a	c
person	c
working	c
in	c
the	c
tourism	c
field	i
because	c
these	i
enables	i
stuff	i
to	c
communicate	c
with	c
clients	c
in	c
a	c
proper	c
way	c
,	i
students	i
have	c
to	c
manage	c
to	c
speak	c
at	c
least	c
three	c
languages	c

Last	i
but	i
not	i
less	i
important	i
is	c
the	c
class	c
called	c
"	c
know-how	c
"	c
wich	i
shows	c
students	c
how	c
to	c
cope	c
with	c
unspected	i
problems	c
even	c
if	c
they	c
are	c
in	i
stress	i

I	c
would	c
also	c
take	i
an	c
outdoor	c
lesson	c
"	i
training	c
"	c

I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
tents	i

log	i
cabins	i

Since	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
child	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
intrested	i
in	c
camping	c
and	c
sleeping	c
under	i
the	i
tents	c

If	c
I	c
can	c
participate	c
on	i
swimming	c
and	c
photography	c
groups	c
,	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
grateful	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
afraid	c
,	i
I	c
am	c
not	c
good	c
at	c
photography	c
but	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
improve	c
it	i

For	c

how	c

Social	c
Activities	c

To	c
whome	i
it	c
may	c
concern	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
tell	c
that	i
I	c
had	c
a	c
very	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
regarding	i
a	c
musical	c
show	c
at	c
your	c
theatre	c
.	c

There	c
are	c
some	c
things	c
that	c
I	c
was	c
not	c
completely	c
satisfied	c
with	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
point	c
them	c
out	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
very	c
unprofessional	c
of	c
you	c
to	c
had	i
printed	i
a	i
wrong	c
starring	i
name	i
on	i
the	c
paper	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
according	c
to	c
the	c
advertisment	i
,	c
the	c
musical	c
was	c
supprsed	i
to	c
start	c
at	c
19.30	c
but	c
it	c
actually	c
started	c
at	c
20.15	c
which	i
caused	c
me	c
a	i
trouble	i
.	c

Then	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
hoping	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
meal	c
at	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
which	i
was	c
recommended	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
,	i
however	i
,	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
possible	c
for	c
me	c
to	c
do	c
so	c
as	c
the	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
due	c
to	c
the	c
stuff	i
vacation	c
which	i
I	c
thought	c
was	c
very	c
unprofessional	c
.	c

With	c
all	c
the	c
dissatisfuction	i
above	c
,	c
therefore	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
for	c
some	c
of	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
as	c
my	c
evening	c
was	c
not	c
what	c
it	c
would	i
have	c
to	i
be	i
.	c

I	c
hope	c
that	c
you	c
will	c
consider	c
this	c
letter	c
seriously	i
and	c
try	c
to	c
improve	c
your	c
service	i
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

She	c
found	i
familier	i
faces	c
on	c
the	c
other	c
side	c
of	c
the	c
street	c
.	c

Molly	c
,	c
Vance	c
and	c
Sally	c
had	c
a	c
quick	c
chat	c
and	c
said	c
good-bye	c
to	c
each	c
other	c
as	c
,	c
to	c
Molly	c
,	c
they	c
seemed	c
to	c
be	c
in	c
a	c
hurry	c
and	c
as	c
Molly	c
knew	c
that	c
they	c
have	i
been	c
dating	c
,	c
she	c
wanted	c
them	c
to	c
enjoy	c
their	c
own	i
time	c
.	i

Then	c
suddenly	i
,	c
Pat	i
's	i
face	i
turned	i
to	c
look	c
confused	c
and	c
said	i
in	c
a	c
small	c
voice	c
,	c
'	c
Have	i
n't	i
they	i
broken	i
up	c
long	i
time	c
ago	c
?	c

Sally	c
must	c
have	c
a	c
new	c
boy	i
friend	i
'	c
.	c

As	c
Molly	c
did	c
n't	c
know	c
this	c
,	c
she	c
was	c
so	c
surprised	c
and	c
tried	c
to	c
ask	c
more	c
about	c
it	c
.	c

She	c
did	c
n't	c
mean	c
to	c
do	c
so	i
,	c
but	c
this	c
kind	c
of	c
thing	c
happens	c
a	c
lot	c
.	c

Now	c
Pat	c
is	c
feeling	c
so	c
guilty	c
about	c
what	c
she	c
has	c
done	c
because	c
Molly	c
is	c
n't	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
either	c
!	c

Everyone	c
is	c
going	c
to	c
know	c
that	c
Sally	c
has	c
been	c
cheating	c
both	c
on	c
Vance	c
and	c
her	c
new	c
boyfriend	c
and	c
the	i
Poor	i
Vance	c
is	c
always	c
the	c
last	c
person	c
to	c
know	c
it	i
.	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
,	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
asking	c
me	c
to	c

Either	i
I	c
am	c

and	c
I	c
am	c
intered	i
in	c
photography	c
professionally	c

I	c
feel	c

it	c
will	c
be	c
the	c

I	c

ever	c
had	c

I	c
look	c

Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c

Perhaps	c
just	i
men	c
or	c
anybody	c
who	c
has	c
lack	i
of	c
time	c
or	c
if	c
you	c
are	c
looking	c
for	c
something	c
to	i
buy	i
particular	i
and	c
shop	i
has	c
not	i
range	i
of	i
variety	c
.	c

Frankly	c
,	c
if	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
money	c
I	c
would	c
have	i
spend	c
my	c
entire	c
life	c
to	i
do	i
shopping	c
.	c

Although	c
I	c
am	c
the	i
one	i
who	c
loves	c
shopping	c
,	c
I	c
can	i
not	i
stand	c
on	i
the	i
Easters	i
,	i
the	i
Christmas	i
and	i
Sundays	i
,	i
because	i
those	i
days	i
are	i
suitable	i
for	i
anyone	i
to	i
consume	i
the	i
food	i
,	i
buy	i
some	i
presents	i
etc.	i
However	c
,	c
everyone	c
prefers	c
to	c
do	c
the	c
same	c
thing	c
and	c
the	i
same	c
time	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c

some	c
companies	c
offer	c
special	c
service	i
such	i
as	c
sending	c
your	c
order	c
with	i
the	i
post	c
or	c
on	i

It	c
could	c
be	c
the	c
solution	i
,	i
avoid	i

hours	i
or	c
days	c
,	i
do	i
not	c
bring	i
your	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
inform	c
you	c
about	c
the	c
bad	c
experience	c
I	c
had	c
last	i
evening	c
going	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
.	c

By	c
the	c
way	c
,	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
,	c
when	c
it	c
had	i
to	c
start	c
at	c
19:30	c
:	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
in	i
late	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
to	i
much	i
in	i

And	c
what	c
's	c
more	c
,	c
there	c
were	c
n't	c
discouts	i
available	c
and	c
the	c
theatre	c

was	c

the	c
only	c
people	c
who	c
could	c
enter	c
in	i
were	c
the	c
actors	c
and	c
the	c
staff	c

Well	c
,	c
it	c
seems	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
my	c
perfect	c
evening	c
and	c
for	c
all	c
these	c
reasons	c
I	c
pretend	i
to	c
have	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
,	c
I	c
waisted	i
Â£	c
20	c
to	c
see	c
a	c

Science	c
and	c
technology	c
have	c
changed	c
man	c
's	c
life	c
:	c
that	c
's	c
true	c
,	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
need	c
to	c
look	c
how	i
they	c
affect	c
the	c
lives	c
of	c
the	i
others	c

I	c
have	i
only	i
to	c
see	c
how	c
they	c
have	c
changed	c
my	c

Radio	c

computer	c
:	c
it	c
's	c
hard	c
to	c
believe	c

every	c
day	c
I	c
'm	c
using	c
something	c
that	c
borns	i
from	c
the	i

But	c
they	c
can	c
also	c
have	c
a	c
bad	c
influence	c
on	c
people	c
's	c
mind	i

It	c
's	c
incredible	c
but	c
if	c
I	c
think	c
of	c
the	c
key-word	c
of	c
mind	i
,	c
the	c
only	c
one	c
I	c
can	c
think	c
of	c
is	c
ORDER	c

They	c
are	c
objects	c
which	c
take	i
part	c
of	c
my	c
life	c

No	c

I	c
'm	c
only	c
a	c
daughter	c
of	c
the	i

Yesterday	c
my	c
grandmother	c
asked	c
me	c
what	c
will	i
I	i
do	c
without	c
the	c
computer	c

I	c
answered	c
to	i
her	c
saying	c
I	c
probably	c
will	i
die	c
.	c

All	c
of	c
us	c
in	c
English	i
class	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
visiting	c
these	c
places	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
we	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
about	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
that	c
we	c
've	c
seen	c
an	c
advertisement	c
on	i
this	c
week	i
college	c
newspaper	c
.	c

It	c
should	c
be	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
for	c
us	c
because	c
we	c
can	c
see	c
the	c
latest	c
fashions	c
,	c
leisure	c
and	c
sports	i
wear	i
,	c
make	i
up	i
and	c
Hairstyles	i
,	i
As	c
you	c
know	c
,	c
this	c
year	c
is	c
our	c
final	c
year	c
and	c
most	c
of	c
us	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
get	c
a	c
job	c
straight	c
away	c
after	c
this	c
course	c
.	c

We	c
've	c
been	c
worried	c
about	c
our	c
future	c
career	c
and	c
we	c
believe	c
that	c
we	c
need	c
some	c
preparation	c
for	c
it	c
such	c
as	c
dress	i
and	c
hairstyle	c
for	c
an	c
interview	c
.	c

Most	c
of	i
students	c
in	c
our	c
class	c
are	c
studying	c
Fashion	c
as	i
full-time	c
.	c

Especially	c
,	c
it	c
does	c
not	c
cost	c
at	i
all	c
for	c
students	c
.	c

But	c
the	c
only	c
problem	c
for	i
the	c
show	c
is	c
the	c
date	c
which	c
is	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
14	c
March	c
from	c
10.00	c
to	c
19.00	c
.	c

We	c
're	c
thinking	c
that	c
we	c
can	c
go	c
to	c
these	c
place	i
the	c
next	i
following	c
day	c
.	c

But	c
Mr.	c
Robertson	c
,	c
these	c
our	i
suggestions	c
are	i
depended	i
on	c
your	c
programme	c
,	c
we	c
're	c
just	c
suggesting	c
.	c

We	c
are	c
look	i
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

Have	c
you	c
ever	c
thought	c
about	c
our	c
future	c
home	c
?	c

Living	c
in	c
a	c
high	c
building	c
!	c

The	c
prises	i
for	c
lands	i
are	c
getting	i
increasing	c
it	i
's	i
because	c
of	c
this	c
reason	i
.	c

So	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
the	c
future	c
home	c
could	i
be	i
considered	i
this	i
points	i
.	c

I	c
believe	c
there	c
are	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
high	c
buildings	c
now	c
in	c
Japan	c
.	c

But	c
what	c
my	i
imagination	i
is	c
that	c
these	c
flats	c
'll	c
have	c
many	c
functions	c
such	c
as	c
offices	c
,	c
leisure	c
centre	c
,	c
shopping	c
centre	c
even	c
school	c
.	c

But	c
one	c
more	c
thing	c
,	c
I	c
believe	c
these	c
flats	c
'll	c
have	c
a	c
park	c
for	c
people	c
who	c
'll	c
be	c
living	c
in	c
there	i
.	c

And	c
because	c
it	c
'll	c
be	c
a	c
big	c
building	c
we	c
'll	c
able	i
to	c
see	c
a	c
whole	i
view	c
through	c
the	c
window	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
heard	c
you	c
organised	c
such	c
a	c
nice	c
programme	c
especially	i
river	i
trip	c
and	c
museum	c
for	i
our	c
class	c
.	c

By	c
the	c
way	c
,	c
our	c
classmates	c
have	c
seen	c
an	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
leisure	c
show	c
.	c

It	c
will	c
show	c
us	c
the	c
latest	c
fashions	c
,	c
leisure	c
and	c
sports	c
wear	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
,	c
make	i
up	i
and	c
hairstyles	i
shows	c
will	c
take	c
place	c
at	c
the	c
same	c
time	c
.	c

What	c
is	c
better	i
,	c
all	i
students	c
can	c
participate	c
without	c
paying	c
.	c

It	c
takes	c
place	c
at	c
Central	c
Exhibition	c
hall	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

So	c
we	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
suggest	c
you	c
to	i
put	i
this	c
programme	i
into	c
the	c
morning	c
time	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
instead	c
of	c
Science	i
Museum	c
and	c
put	c
science	i
museum	c
into	c
free	c
time	c
on	c
Wednesday	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
will	c
consider	c
our	c
suggestion	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Much	c
safer	c
but	c
still	c
at	c
home	c

Our	c
homes	c
have	c
change	i
with	c
many	c
comfortable	c
things	c
compare	i
with	c
the	c
past	c
.	c

Our	c
homes	c
will	c
be	c
different	c
in	c
the	i
way	i
to	c
protect	c
our	c
family	c
from	c
theives	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
now	c
we	c
have	c
a	c
security	c
safety	i
like	c
a	c
bell	c
or	c
button	c
.	c

That	c
is	i
,	c
our	c
security	c
system	c
will	c
be	c
much	c
stronger	c
.	c

To	c
conclude	c
,	c
while	c
our	c
homes	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
will	c
be	c
much	c
safer	c
than	c
before	c
,	c
they	c
will	c
still	c
have	c
good	c
spaces	c
for	c
us	c
to	c
be	c
at	c
home	c
.	c

Last	c
week	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
Circle	c
theatre	c
,	c
of	i
which	c
you	c
are	c
responsable	i
,	c
to	c
se	i
the	c
musical	c
show	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
.	c

The	c
advertisement	c
outside	c
the	c
theatre	c
explained	i
a	c
lot	c
of	c
interesting	c
things	c
to	c
enjoy	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
this	c
letter	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
had	c
a	c
very	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
.	c

Everything	c
in	c
the	c
advertisement	c
has	c
been	c
done	c
in	c
the	c
Wrong	c
Way	c
.	c

Firstly	c
there	c
was	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
in	c
the	c
starring	c
;	i
you	c
have	i
written	c
DANNY	c
BROOK	c
and	c
he	c
was	c
absent	c
.	c

Another	c
thing	c
that	c
was	c
wrong	c
is	c
about	c
discounts	c
:	c
you	c
had	c
written	c
they	c
were	c
available	c
,	c
but	c
they	c
were	c
not	c
and	c
so	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
pay	c
the	c
whole	i
ticket	i
's	i
price	c
.	c

But	c
the	c
worst	c
thing	c
was	c
that	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
the	c
restaurant	c
of	i
the	c
theatre	c
was	c
closed	c
and	c
so	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
another	c
place	c
to	c
have	c
dinner	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
modern	c
technology	c
has	c
changed	c
human	i
's	i
life	c
a	c
lot	c
,	c
expecially	i
starting	i
with	i
the	i
last	c
century	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
situation	c
for	c
example	c
cars	c
and	c
motorcycles	c
are	c
a	c
necessity	c
to	i
get	i
out	i
:	c
I	c
live	c
on	c
a	c
little	c
mountain	c
at	c
160	c
metres	c
of	i
altitud	i
so	c
I	c
cannot	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
city	c
using	c
a	c
bycicle	i
.	c

Moreover	c
without	i
a	i
cellular	i
phone	i
my	i
mother	i
does	i
not	i
let	i
me	i
go	i
out	i
with	i
my	i
friends	i
to	i
the	i
city	i
because	c
it	c
is	c
too	c
far	c
and	c
she	c
is	i
worried	c
.	c

Another	c
thing	c
that	c
I	c
appreciate	c
a	c
lot	c
is	c
the	c
electric	c
guitar	c
;	c
I	c
like	c
very	i
much	i
play	i
guitar	i
,	c
and	c
in	c
my	c
free	c
time	c
I	c
prefer	c
play	i
electric	c
,	c
than	c
acoustic	c
or	c
classic	i
guitar	c
using	i
distortion	c
and	c
gain	c
and	c
the	c
highest	c
volume	c
possible	c
.	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
have	c
to	c
take	c
part	c
in	c
basketball	c
competitions	c
all	c
year	c
long	c
,	c
except	c
during	c
July	c
,	c
so	c
it	i
is	c
the	c
only	c
month	c
in	c
which	c
I	c
can	c
travel	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
never	c
practised	i
this	c
sport	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
ca	c
n't	c
play	c
golf	c
at	c
all	c
.	c

Would	c
you	c
mind	c
sending	c
me	c
some	c
information	c
about	c
the	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
will	c
need	c
?	c

I	c
would	c
be	c
grateful	c
to	c
receive	c
some	c
information	c
about	c
the	c
meals	c
at	c
the	c
camp	c
and	c
I	c
hope	c
that	c
it	c
will	c
not	c
be	c
a	c
problem	c
for	c
you	c
if	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
vegan	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
,	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

Elena	c
Pabori	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
if	c
we	c
want	c
to	c
show	c
the	c
good	c
points	c
of	c
our	c
typical	c
school-day	i
,	c
we	c
should	c
film	c
the	c
large	c
number	c
of	c
sport	i
activities	c
that	c
this	c
school	c
organises	c
because	c
students	c
are	c
compelled	c
by	c
them	c
to	c
come	c
to	c
school	c
with	c
enthusiasm	c
.	c

Only	c
who	i
gets	i
good	c
marks	c
can	c
take	c
part	c
in	c
theese	i
activities	c
,	c
so	c
sport	i
activities	c
are	c
seen	c
as	c
a	c
prize	c
,	c
so	c
while	c
the	c
students	c
are	c
playing	c
basket	i
ball	i
,	c
tennis	c
,	c
volleyball	c
...	c
or	c
they	c
are	c
swimming	c
you	c
can	c
see	c
satisfaction	c
on	c
their	c
faces	c
,	c
and	c
our	c
volleyball	c
team	c
is	c
excellent	c
.	c

It	c
would	c
be	c
nice	c
to	c
film	c
an	c
Ancient	c
Greek	c
Poetry	i
lesson	c
because	c
Ancient	i
Greek	c
teacher	c
is	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
explaining	c
;	c
she	c
is	c
excellent	c
at	c
catching	c
our	c
attention	c
and	c
she	c
wants	c
everyone	c
to	c
tell	c
the	c
class	c
the	c
impressions	c
and	c
emotion	i
they	c
have	c
reading	c
Saffo	c
,	c
Alceo	c
,	c
Alcmone	c
....	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
not	c
really	c
satisfied	c
about	i
it	c
.	c

Lots	c
of	c
information	c
in	c
your	c
advertisement	c
are	i
not	c
correct	c
.	c

Some	c
problems	c
of	c
organisation	c
seem	c
to	c
be	i
appeared	c
.	c

In	c
your	c
advertisement	c
you	c
announced	c
the	c
actors	c
were	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
and	c
Tina	c
Truelove	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
to	c
wait	c
for	c
45	c
minutes	c
without	i
nothing	i
doing	i
.	c

I	c
would	i
you	c
informed	i
us	c
before	i
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
furthermore	i
I	c
had	c
to	c
pay	c
full	c
price	c
whereas	c
you	c
granted	i
us	c
some	c
discount	c
prices	c
.	c

Your	c
assistant	c
prevented	c
us	c
from	c
visiting	c
it	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
too	c
late	c
and	c
he	c
was	c
so	c
busy	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
you	c
thought	c
that	c
you	c
could	c
grant	i
us	c
a	c
perfect	c
evening	c
but	c
it	i
was	c
not	c
true	c
.	c

Consequently	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
you	c
refund	i
my	c
bill	i
.	c

Nowadays	c
,	c
we	c
need	c
modern	c
technology	c
to	c
improve	c
on	i
daily	c
life	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
,	c
without	c
using	c
internet	i
I	c
could	c
not	c
put	i
me	i
through	c
to	c
foreign	c
people	c
.	c

This	c
interactive	c
way	i
of	c
communication	c
allows	c
me	c
to	c
reach	c
everybody	c
everywhere	c
without	c
restrictions	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
technology	c
has	c
changed	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
because	c
it	c
allows	c
me	c
to	c
do	c
much	i
more	c
things	c
than	c
before	c
.	c

There	c
are	c
links	c
between	c
the	c
greenhouse	i
,	c
technology	c
and	c
me	c
.	c

Be	c
carefull	i
,	c
my	c
own	c
technology	c
can	c
kill	c
me	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
or	c
Madam	c
,	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
and	c
give	c
some	c
information	i
you	c
asked	c
about	c
me	c
.	c

Re	c
time	i
:	c
I	c
am	c
a	c
student	c
and	c
have	c
examinations	c
until	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
June	c
.	c

The	c
only	c
convinient	i
time	c
to	c
travel	c
is	c
in	c
July	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
can	c
arrange	c
this	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
had	c
sleeping	c
and	c
breathing	c
problems	c
in	c
tents	c
which	c
were	c
serious	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
a	c
few	c
questions	c
about	c
the	c
camp	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
vegetarian	c
and	c
ca	c
n't	c
eat	c
any	c
milk	c
products	c
.	c

What	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
will	c
I	c
need	c
?	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c

I	c
want	c
to	c
apologize	c
for	c
writing	c
so	c
late	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
work	c
to	c
do	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
absolutely	c
amazing	c
.	c

My	c
job	c
was	c
checking	c
the	c
entry	c
tickets	c
and	c
the	c
bags	c
of	c
the	c
fans	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
to	c
tear	c
off	c
a	c
part	c
of	c
every	c
single	c
ticket	c
.	c

This	c
part	c
had	c
to	c
be	c
saved	c
for	c
later	c
because	c
the	c
concert	c
orginazer	i
wanted	c
to	c
know	c
the	c
exactly	i
number	c
of	c
visitors	c
.	c

After	c
two	c
hours	c
of	c
tearing	c
tickets	c
I	c
changed	c
my	c
place	i
and	c
went	c
to	c
help	c
at	c
the	c
security	c
section	c
.	c

Here	c
,	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
check	c
the	c
bags	c
and	c
couts	i
of	c
the	c
girls	c
.	c

Fans	c
were	c
n't	c
allowed	c
to	c
take	c
any	c
sharp	c
things	c
with	i
them	c
,	c
like	c
knifes	i
or	c
scissors	c
.	c

I	c
really	c
felt	c
like	c
a	c
security	c
guard	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
great	c
experience	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
a	c
serious	c
duty	c
and	c
also	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
fun	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
introduce	c
them	c
to	c
you	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

Love	c

Hello	c
,	c

I	c
'm	c
so	c
glad	c
I	c
won	c
this	c

,	c
but	c
I	c
have	c
some	c
questions	c
for	c
you	c
,	c
and	c
of	c
course	c
,	c
the	c
answers	i
you	c
asked	c
me	c
.	i

Well	c
,	c
at	i
first	i
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
only	c
in	c
July	c
,	c
because	c
it	c
's	c
my	c
holidays	i
here	c
in	c
Portugal	c
.	c

And	c
if	c
it	c
's	c
possible	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
after	c
day	i
10th	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
've	c
got	c
some	c
things	c
to	c
do	c
.	c

After	c
that	c
day	c
,	c
I	c
've	c
never	c
stayed	c
at	i
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
.	c

About	c
activities	c
,	c
I	c
enjoy	c
most	i
painting	i

because	c
I	c
am	i
a	c
plastic	i
artist	i
since	c
I	c
was	c
nine	c
and	c
I	c
've	c
won	c
lots	c
of	c
prizes	c
with	c
my	c
art	c
.	c

And	c
the	c
other	c
activity	c
is	c
singing	c
.	c

Everybody	c
says	c
I	c
have	c
an	c
excellent	c
voice	c
,	i
I	c
like	c
to	c
sing	c
when	c
I	c
painting	i
too	c
,	i
it	i
's	i
so	c
relaxing	c
.	c

Is	c
that	c
enough	c
?	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
ask	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothe	i
I	c
probably	i
will	i
use	i
there	c
?	c

And	c
how	c
much	c
clothe	i
?	c

A	c
lot	c
,	c
or	c
few	i
?	c

If	c

tell	c
me	c

I	c
'll	c
be	c
glad	c

Greatefully	i

Teresa	c

Well	c

Dear	c
Ms.	c
Ryan	c
,	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
really	c
amazed	c
to	c
have	c
actually	c
won	c
first	c
prize	c
after	c
years	c
of	c
unsuccessfully	c
entering	c
competitions	c
!	c

In	c
connection	c
with	c
the	c
questions	c
you	c
asked	c
,	c
please	c
find	c
my	c
answers	c
as	c
follows	c
:	c

-	c
As	c
far	c
as	c
accommodation	c
is	c
concerned	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
the	c
log	c
cabin	c
due	c
to	c
the	c
fact	c
that	c
I	c
am	c
not	c
a	c
teenager	c
any	c
more	c
and	c
crawling	c
in	c
and	c
out	c
of	c
a	c
tent	c
has	c
become	c
cumbersome	i
to	i
me	c
.	c

-	c
My	c
choice	c
of	c
sports	c
are	c
swimming	c
and	c
tennis	c
.	c

Tennis	c
I	c
only	c
started	c
four	c
years	c
ago	c
,	c
but	c
have	c
found	c
that	c
I	c
am	c
quite	c
talented	c
at	c
it	c
,	c
having	c
won	c
several	c
competitions	c
during	c
the	c
last	c
two	c
years	c
or	c
so	c
.	c

Looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
,	c

I	c
remain	c
,	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

Therefore	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
time	i
document	c
which	c
will	c
remain	c
of	c
interest	c
and	c
which	c
will	c
be	c
read	c
again	c
and	c
again	c
,	c
also	i
by	i
non-South	i
Africans	i
.	c

Generations	c
of	c
young	c
South	c
Africans	c
black	i
,	c
white	c
or	c
brown	c
will	i
be	c
reminded	c
of	c
one	c
of	c
the	c
worst	c
times	c
their	c
country	c
went	c
through	c
.	c

Steve	c
Biko	c
and	c
Donald	c
Woods	c
will	c
be	c
remembered	c
always	c
.	c

Steve	c
Biko	c
for	c
becoming	c
a	c
martyr	c
to	c
the	c
black	c
freedom	c
movement	c
of	c
these	i
dark	c
years	c
.	c

A	c
peaceful	c
man	c
who	c
was	c
caught	c
up	c
in	c
the	c
wills	i
of	c
the	c
apartheid	c
regime	c
,	c
dying	c
such	c
a	c
violent	c
death	c
.	c

Donald	c
Wood	c
for	c
literally	c
jumping	i
over	i
his	i
own	i
shadow	i
and	c
risking	c
his	c
life	c
and	c
that	c
of	c
his	c
family	c
in	c
the	c
process	c
of	c
reporting	c
the	c
vile	c
crimes	c
of	c
the	c
SA	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
end	c
he	c
had	c
to	c
leave	c
the	c
country	c
of	c
his	c
birth	c
to	c
escape	c
imprisonment	c
.	c

I	c
spent	c
two	c
days	c
at	c
the	c
last	c
annual	c
international	c
arts	c
festival	c
and	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
congratulate	c
on	i
the	c
organization	c
.	c

An	c
internation	i
arts	c
festival	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
idea	c
,	c
but	c
at	c
the	c
last	c
die	i
there	c
were	c
starts	i
and	c
artists	c
from	c
only	c
six	c
countries	c
,	c
and	c
it	c
could	c
be	c
more	c
interesting	c
to	c
have	c
the	c
possibility	i
to	c
meet	c
artists	c
and	c
stars	c
from	c
more	c
than	c
six	c
cultures	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
not	c
listen	c
to	c
one	c
of	c
my	c
favorite	i
classic	i
concert	i
,	c
"	c
La	c
Moldava	c
"	c
by	c
Smetana	c
.	c

Most	c
of	c
the	c
plays	c
and	c
films	c
were	c
brilliant	c
but	c
I	c
think	c
that	c
if	c
there	c
is	c
money	i
enough	i
,	c
it	c
will	i
be	c
better	c
to	c
have	c
the	c
possibility	i
to	c
watch	c
more	c
movies	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
your	c
recent	c
letter	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
very	c
happy	c
that	c
you	c
are	c
well	c
.	c

I	c
ca	c
n't	c
have	c
my	c
mobile	c
on	c
and	c
drinking	c
and	c
eating	c
in	c
the	c
classroom	c
is	c
a	i
bad	c
beheviour	i
.	c

There	c
is	c
n't	c
a	i
kind	c
of	c
punishment	c
for	c
people	c
who	c
do	c
these	c
things	c
.	c

The	c
most	c
important	c
thing	c
for	c
my	c
parents	c
is	c
that	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
tell	c
them	c
lays	i
.	c

It	c
's	c
important	c
for	c
them	c
that	c
I	c
tell	c
them	c
where	c
I	c
'm	c
going	c
if	c
I	c
go	c
out	c
and	c
what	c
time	c
I	c
think	c
of	i
coming	c
back	c
home	c
.	c

This	c
is	c
the	c
only	c
condition	c
to	i
do	i
what	c
I	c
prefer	i
.	c

There	c
is	c
n't	c
anything	c
that	c
I	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
change	c
.	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
,	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
telling	c
me	c
about	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
my	c
examination	i
will	c
be	c
finished	c
on	c
June	c
15th	c
.	c

And	c
I	c
have	c
a	c
plan	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
visit	c
my	c
parents	c
in	c
Bangkok	c
,	c
Thailand	c
,	c
in	c
the	c
middle	c
of	c
August	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
July	c
is	c
the	c
best	c
time	c
to	c
go	c
for	i
the	c
Camp	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
,	c
the	c
weather	c
may	c
be	c
nice	c
at	c
that	c
period	i
of	i
time	i
.	c

For	c
accommodation	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
tents	c
because	c
I	c
get	i
used	c
to	c
it	i
.	c

When	c
I	c
was	c
studying	c
in	i
the	i
university	c
I	c
joined	c
the	c
Photo	c
Club	c
where	c
I	c
got	i
the	i
knowledge	i
a	i
well	i
as	i
a	i
wide	i
variety	i
of	i
knowhow	i
in	i
taking	c
photo	i
.	c

As	c
I	c
love	c
singing	c
and	c
always	c
spend	c
my	c
free	c
time	c
in	i
Karaoke	c
to	c
practise	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
my	c
singing	c
is	c
not	c
too	c
bad	c
.	c

I	c
also	c
have	c
a	c
couple	c
of	c
things	c
to	c
ask	c
you	c
.	c

What	c
type	c
of	c
clothes	c
and	c
how	c
much	c
money	c
do	c
I	c
need	c
to	c
prepare	i
?	c

I	c
would	c
be	c
delightful	i
if	c
you	c
could	c
recommend	i
me	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

"	c
Shopping	c
is	c
not	c
always	c
enjoyable	c
"	c
.	c

I	c
strongly	c
agree	c
with	c
this	c
sentence	c
.	c

I	c
used	c
to	c
do	i
shopping	c
a	c
lot	c
when	c
I	c
was	c
in	i
the	i
university	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
19	c
years	c
old	c
but	c
I	c
spend	i
over	c
200	c
pounds	c
in	i
some	c
weeks	c
just	c
to	c
make	i
myself	c
up-to-date	i
all	c
the	c
time	c
.	c

I	c
bought	c
lots	c
of	c
new	c
fashion	i
clothes	c
,	c
bags	c
and	c
shoes	c
.	c

Four	i
years	c
in	i
the	i
university	c
I	c
never	c
had	c
saving	i
money	i
.	c

The	c
money	c
that	c
I	c
spent	c
on	c
shopping	c
can	i
help	i
them	c
a	c
lot	c
if	c
I	c
would	i
not	c
do	i
it	c
before	i
.	c

Unfortunatly	i
I	i
am	c
a	i
very	c
disappointed	c
about	c
organisation	i
in	i
your	c
company	c
.	c

Firsty	i
the	i
musical	c
show	c
started	c
not	c
at	c
7.30	c
p.m.	c
but	c
45	c
minutes	c
later	c
.	c

And	c
the	c
biggest	c
disappointment	c
for	c
me	c
was	c
that	c
the	c
grateful	i
Danny	c
Brook	c
,	c
the	c
best	c
singer	c
in	c
London	c
,	c
was	c
n't	c
present	c
and	c
it	i
was	i
singing	i
a	i
mother	i
unknown	i
person	i
.	c

And	c
last	c
but	c
not	c
least	c
I	i
recognised	i
after	c
the	c
show	c
that	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
waiters	c
did	c
n't	c
come	c
...	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
it	i
is	c
a	c
typical	c
situation	c
in	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatrer	i
that	c
is	i
promised	i
much	c
more	c
then	c
the	c
people	c
can	c
get	c
for	c
their	c
money	c
,	c
or	c
it	i
was	c
on	c
June	c
7	c
(	c
my	c
visit	c
)	c
only	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
am	i
not	c
agree	i
with	i
such	c
situation	i
and	c
would	i
ask	c
you	c
for	c
my	c
money	c
back	c
-	c
my	c
bank	c
account	c
number	c
is	c
enclosed	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
for	i
you	i
answering	i
.	c

Because	c
the	i
people	c
have	c
fast	c
and	c
comfortable	c
cars	c
,	c
they	c
are	c
much	c
more	c
mobil	i
and	c
can	c
spend	c
their	c
free-time	i
more	c
aktiv	i
-	c
they	c
can	c
often	c
visit	c
their	c
friends	c
and	c
travel	c
much	c
more	c
.	c

Secondely	i
we	i
can	c
do	c
our	c
jobs	c
today	c
more	c
efficient	i
.	c

We	c
have	c
modern	c
equipment	c
for	c
communication	c
-	c
phones	c
,	c
faxes	c
,	c
E-mail	c
.	c

We	c
can	c
communicate	c
with	c
our	c
partner	i
faster	c
and	c
better	c
and	c
offer	c
them	c
better	c
service	i
.	c

If	c
we	c
are	c
more	c
efficient	c
we	c
can	c
earn	c
more	c
money	c
and	c
spend	c
it	c
more	c
for	i
our	c
daily	c
life	c
-	c
for	i
better	c
clothes	c
,	c
furniture	c
,	c
spare	i
time	i

I	c
am	c
a	c
fan	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c

During	c
my	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
I	c
decided	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
.	c

I	c
found	c
your	c
advertisement	c
in	c
the	c
tourism	i
officis	i
and	c
how	i
the	c
musical	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
"	c
seemed	c
to	c
be	c
a	c
good	c
option	c
I	c
choose	i
it	c
.	c

The	c
problem	c
is	c
that	c
there	c
was	i
some	c
differences	c
between	c
the	c
advertisement	c
and	c
the	c
show	c
I	i
've	i
seen	i
.	c

First	c
,	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
was	c
n't	c
the	c
star	c
that	c
night	c
,	c
he	c
was	c
replaced	c
by	c
an	c
actor	c
that	c
seemed	c
a	i
rookie	c
.	c

How	i
it	i
was	i
explained	i
above	i
,	i
I	i
'm	i
not	i
satisfied	i
and	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
be	c
refund	i
.	c

yours	c
faithfully	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

We	i
'll	i
understand	c
why	c
I	c
'm	c
writing	c
in	i
the	c
past	c
.	c

Last	c
weekend	c
we	c
diced	i
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
bach	i
with	c
Pat	c
and	c
Nick	c
(	c
her	c
boyfriend	c
)	c
.	c

Then	c
I	c
found	c
an	c
ex-girlfriend	c
that	c
Eingrid	c
hates	c
.	c

We	c
had	c
a	c
little	c
conversation	c
and	c
suddenly	c
she	c
kissed	c
me	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
refused	c
to	c
continue	c
.	c

When	c
we	c
met	c
the	c
girls	c
Eingrid	c
was	c
furious	c
,	c
she	c
said	c
me	i
that	c
Pat	c
had	c
saw	i
me	c
kissing	c
another	c
girl	c
and	c
our	c
relationship	c
was	c
over	c
!	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
you	c
might	c
not	c
know	c
what	c
this	c
show	c
is	c
.	i

In	i
fact	i
,	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
big	c
exhibition	c
of	c
the	c
latest	c
fashions	c
,	c
leisure	c
and	c
sports	c
wear	c
,	c
make	i
up	i
and	c
hairstyles	c
.	c

It	c
would	c
be	c
interesting	c
for	c
us	c
to	c
see	c
all	c
that	c
"	c
live	c
"	c
,	c
rather	c
than	c
on	c
TV	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
for	c
us	c
because	c
the	i
entry	c
is	c
free	c
for	c
students	c
so	c
it	c
will	c
not	c
affect	c
the	c
budget	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

Terror	c
in	c
the	c
Alps	c

We	c
had	c
been	c
trapped	c
in	c
the	c
snowy	c
,	c
almost	c
vertical	c
slopes	c
of	c
the	c
"	c
TÃªte	c
Blanche	c
"	c
for	c
more	c
than	c
ten	c
hours	c
by	c
then	c
.	c

We	c
were	c
there	c
,	c
alone	c
,	c
my	c
friend	c
with	c
his	c
broken	c
leg	c
and	c
myself	c
.	c

We	c
had	c
decided	c
to	c
climb	c
that	c
more	c
than	c
3'700-metre-high	i
mountain	c
near	c
Arolla	c
in	c
Switzerland	c
two	c
weeks	c
beforehand	c
.	c

We	c
had	c
been	c
preparing	c
the	c
trip	c
for	c
several	c
days	c
when	c
we	c
started	c
to	c
climb	c
the	c
mountain	c
,	c
on	c
that	i
4th	c
of	c
September	c
1995	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
it	c
started	c
to	c
go	c
wrong	c
after	c
one	c
hour	c
of	c
downhill	c
walking	c
.	c

My	c
friend	c
fell	c
down	c
and	c
badly	c
hit	c
his	c
leg	c
against	c
a	c
rock	c
.	c

We	c
could	c
immediatly	i
see	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
broken	c
.	c

We	c
were	c
trapped	c
!	c

I	c
finally	c
decided	c
to	c
carry	c
him	c
on	c
my	c
back	c
on	i
the	i
way	i
back	c
to	c
the	c
rescue	c
chalet	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
dangerous	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
steepness	c
of	c
the	c
slope	c
and	c
we	c
risked	c
falling	c
down	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
we	c
would	c
have	c
frozen	c
to	c
death	c
if	c
we	c
had	c
stood	i
where	c
we	c
were	c
.	c

After	c
ten	c
more	c
exhausting	c
hours	c
of	c
walking	c
we	c
finally	c
reached	c
the	c
chalet	c
,	c
from	c
which	i
we	c
were	c
able	c
to	c
call	c
a	c
helicopter	c
.	c

We	c
were	c
safe	c
!	c

Dear	c
Sirs	c
,	c

The	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
was	c
so	i
far	i
the	c
best	c
theatre	c
in	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
but	c
now	c
,	c
I	c
must	c
change	c
my	c
opinion	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	i
to	c
see	c
the	c
best	c
musical	c
show	c
with	c
the	c
best	c
artists	c
.	c

We	c
have	i
disappointed	c
.	c

Moreover	c
this	i
show	c
did	c
not	c
start	c
at	c
19.30	c
,	c
but	c
45	c
minutes	c
later	c
.	c

Another	c
problem	c
-	c
the	c
tickets	c
for	c
students	c
according	c
to	c
your	c
advertisement	c
should	c
be	i
available	i
with	i
discounts	i
-	c
unfortunately	c
I	c
could	c
not	c
buy	c
such	c
ticket	i
.	c

During	c
the	c
interval	c
I	c
would	c
drink	i
coffee	c
in	c
theatre	i
restaurant	c
-	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
know	c
,	i
why	c
?	i

I	c
no	i
thought	i
,	i
that	c
so	c
serious	c
theatre	i
makes	i
such	c
mistakes	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
that	c
your	c
answer	c
will	c
be	c
positive	c
,	c
and	c
in	c
the	c
future	c
in	c
your	c
theatre	c
all	c
will	c
be	c
O.K	c
.	c

What	c
will	c
clothes	c
be	c
like	c
100	c
years	c
from	c
now	c
?	c

Fashion	c
are	i
changing	c
every	c
year	c
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
in	i
the	c
future	c
people	c
will	c
wear	c
clothes	c
made	c
of	c
a	i
natural	c
fabrics	c
;	c
silk	c
,	c
cotton	c
,	c
leather	c
,	c
wool	c
.	c

Women	c
will	c
prefere	i
the	i
long	c
skirts	c
and	c
short	c
blouses	c
and	c
jackets	c
.	c

Young	c
people	c
will	c
wear	c
jeans	c
and	c
T-shirt	i
.	c

Such	c
clothes	c
is	i
comfortable	c
and	c
easy	c
in	i
using	i
.	c

Men	c
will	c
wear	c
as	c
usualy	i
-	c
a	c
suit	c
.	c

Fashion	i
colours	c
-	c
it	i
will	c
be	c
earth	c
colours	c
:	c
grey	c
,	c
blue	c
,	c
yellow	c
,	c
brown	c
.	c

For	c
special	c
ocassions	i
,	c
for	c
example	i
-	i
the	i
party	c
,	c
the	i
concert	c
,	c
people	c
will	c
wear	i
very	c
smart	i
.	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
,	i
we	c
will	c
observe	c
a	c
little	i
and	i
slow	c
changes	c
in	c
fashion	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
hope	c
that	c
new	c
clothes	c
will	c
be	i
always	i
pleasent	i
for	c
people	c

As	c
you	c
are	c
probably	c
aware	c
of	i
our	c
English	c
class	c
is	c
going	c
to	c
spend	c
three	c
days	c
in	c
London	c
.	c

The	c
programme	c
has	c
already	c
been	c
organized	c
by	c
you	c
and	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
say	c
you	c
have	c
made	i
us	i
a	i
very	i
nice	i
schedule	i
.	c

I	c
believe	c
it	c
could	c
be	c
an	c
enriching	c
experience	c
for	c
all	c
of	c
us	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
we	c
would	c
be	c
speaking	c
English	c
outside	c
school	c
.	c

Our	c
free	c
time	c
on	c
Wednesday	c
could	c
be	c
spent	c
in	i
the	c
Museum	i

Best	c
Detective	c
Stories	c
of	i
Agatha	c
Christie	c

I	c
'm	c
sorry	c
it	c
took	c
me	c
so	c
long	c
to	c
write	i
you	i
back	i
,	c
but	c
I	c
have	c
being	i
very	c
busy	c
lately	c
:	i
Anyway	c
,	c
on	i
your	c
last	c
letter	c
you	c
asked	c
me	c
whether	c
.	i

Well	c
,	c
having	c
read	c
the	c
book	c
before	c
,	c
I	c
can	c
say	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
great	c
idea	c
!	c

You	c
told	c
me	c
your	c
cousin	c
likes	c
suspense	c
books	c
and	c
stories	c
,	c
the	c
ones	c
you	i
keep	c
trying	c
to	c
figure	c
it	i
out	c
who	c
is	c
the	c
killer	c
.	c

Agatha	c
Christie	c
's	c
stories	c
just	c
could	c
n't	c
be	c
more	c
suitable	c
for	c
your	c
cousin	c
.	c

Specially	i
because	c
there	c
is	c
n't	c
just	c
one	c
story	c
,	c
but	c
a	c
whole	c
lot	c
of	c
them	c
.	c

Personally	c
speaking	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
they	c
selected	c
the	c
best	c
ones	c
to	c
be	c
published	c
.	c

Now	c
,	c
tell	c
me	c
more	c
about	c
you	c
.	c

Are	c
you	c
already	c
on	c
holidays	i
.	i

My	c
school	c
has	c
finished	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
'll	c
need	c
to	c
sit	c
a	c
big	c
exam	c
at	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
this	c
month	c
so	c
that	c
I	c
can	c
go	c
into	i
College	i
.	c

I	c
just	c
ca	c
n't	c
wait	c
to	c
go	c
abroad	c
for	c
the	c
first	c
time	c
!	c

I	c
think	c
that	c
's	c
all	c
about	c
it	c

Merry	c
Xmas	c
and	c
Great	i
New	c
Year	c
!	c

As	c
you	c
know	c
all	c
of	c
us	c
in	c
this	c
class	c
are	c
preparing	c
to	c
go	i
in	i
for	i
the	c
art	c
&	c
design	c
school	c
in	c
the	c
next	c
semester	c
.	c

So	c
this	c
is	c
a	c
great	i
oppotunity	i
for	c
us	c
to	c
get	c
used	c
to	c
the	c
real	c
world	c
of	c
fashion	c
design	c
,	c
because	c
in	c
this	c
show	c
there	c
will	i
have	i
a	c
fashion	c
show	c
,	i
a	i
demonstation	i
from	i
make	i
up	c
artists	c
,	c
and	c
a	c
contest	c
for	c
hair	i
stylist	i
.	c

We	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
if	c
all	c
of	c
us	c
can	c
join	i
in	i
this	c
event	c
.	c

We	c
all	c
agree	c
that	c
we	c
are	c
going	c
to	i
join	i
the	c
school	c
trip	c
to	c
Science	i
Museum	c
,	c
which	c
is	c
the	c
most	c
interesting	c
trip	c
for	c
us	c
.	c

Anyway	c
,	c
intstead	i
of	c
go	i
shopping	c
in	c
the	c
afternoon	c
session	c
,	c
we	c
will	c
attend	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

We	c
hope	c
much	i
that	c
you	c
understand	c
,	c
and	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
in	i
advance	c
for	c
your	c
cooperation	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

It	c
was	c
dangerous	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
know	i
I	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
.	c

It	c
seemed	c
that	c
all	i
of	i
them	i
did	i
n't	i
have	i
any	c
sympathy	c
to	i
that	c
lovely	c
blue	i
eyes	i
puppy	c
that	c
somebody	c
who	c
have	i
no	c
mercy	c
just	i
left	i
it	i
there	c
,	c
in	i
a	c
highway	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
just	c
crossed	c
the	c
road	c
,	c
and	i
jumped	i
,	i
picked	c
him	c
up	c
.	c

I	c
feel	i
like	c
I	c
was	c
a	c
hero	c
at	c
that	c
moment	c
,	c
even	c
though	c
I	c
'd	c
never	c
though	i
of	c
it	c
before	c

Dear	c
Mr	c

We	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
all	c
the	c
time	c
you	c
have	c
spend	i
for	i
us	i
in	c
order	c
to	c
organize	c
the	c
programme	c
that	c
we	c
should	i
follow	c
during	c
three	i
days	c
that	c
we	c
are	c
going	c
to	c
spending	i
London	i
.	c

We	c
all	c
believe	c
that	c
is	i
a	c
great	c
programme	c
which	i
concludes	i
both	c
education	i
and	c
free	c
time	c
.	c

We	c
think	c
that	c
is	i
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
and	c
we	c
are	c
all	c
very	c
interesting	i
to	i
go	i
because	c
we	c
can	c
see	c
there	c
the	c
latest	c
fashions	c
,	c
leisure	c
and	c
sports	c
wear	c
,	c
lot	i
kinds	i
of	c
make	i
up	i
and	c
some	c
of	i
the	i
famous	c
hairstylers	i
.	c

The	c
show	c
is	c
absolutly	i
free	c
for	c
students	c
.	c

As	c
a	c
class	c
we	c
suggest	c
to	i
go	i
to	c
this	c
show	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
,	c
March	c
14	c
morning	i
and	i
to	i
visit	i
the	c
Science	c
Museum	c
on	c
Wednesday	c
afternoon	c
during	c
our	c
free	c
time	c
.	c

If	c
that	c
of	i
course	i
is	c
possible	c

We	c
all	i
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
again	c

The	c
media	c
is	c
everywhere	c
,	i
televisions	i
,	c
radio	c
stations	c
,	c
newspapers	c
,	c
magazines	i
all	c
have	c
one	c
goal	c
,	c
to	c
inform	c
the	c
citizens	c
.	c

They	c
just	c
published	i
gossips	i
about	c
famous	c
people	c
,	c
such	c
as	c
politicians	c
,	c
musicians	c
and	c
film	c
stars	c
.	c

They	c
are	c
humans	c
like	c
all	c
of	c
us	c
with	i
their	c
problems	c
,	c
their	c
good	c
and	c
bad	c
times	c
and	i
of	c
course	c
they	c
do	c
n't	c
want	c
to	i
be	i
publish	i
them	c
in	c
front	c
of	c
millions	c
of	c
people	c
because	c
a	c
journalist	c
thought	c
that	c
this	c
is	i
right	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr.	c
Robertson	c
.	i

I	c
'm	c
writing	c
to	c
you	c
,	i
because	c
we	c
saw	c
a	c
great	c
advetisement	i
for	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
and	c
we	c
really	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
see	c
that	c
show	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
's	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
because	i
,	i
we	c
will	c
have	c
a	c
chance	c
to	c
se	i
the	c
latest	c
fashion	c
,	c
leisure	c
and	c
sport	i
wear	c
,	c
and	c
as	i
well	i
the	i
way	i
to	i
do	i
the	i
perfect	i
make	i
up	i
and	i
hairstyl	i
.	c

In	c
my	c
opinion	c
,	c
we	c
can	c
have	c
a	c
great	c
time	c
there	c
,	c
and	c
entrence	i
is	c
free	c
of	c
charge	c
for	c
students	c
,	c
what	i
is	c
very	c
important	c
as	c
well	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
wondering	c
if	c
there	c
is	c
any	c
possibility	c
to	c
go	c
on	i
that	c
show	c
on	c
Tuesday	c
afternoon	c
,	c
and	c
move	c
our	c
shopping	c
to	c
next	i
day	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
'll	c
think	c
about	c
our	c
proposition	i
and	c
consider	c
to	i
change	i
the	c
programme	c

'	c
My	c
perfect	c
holiday	c
'	c

'	c
It	c
was	c
dangerous	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
knew	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
'	c

My	c
story	c
began	i
on	i
my	c
holiday	c
.	c

We	c
thought	c
with	i
that	c
beutiful	i
weather	c
the	c
seeside	i
is	i
just	c
perfect	c
for	c
relax	i
,	c
sunbathing	c
and	c
joy	i
.	c

However	c
the	i
truth	c
was	c
a	c
little	c
bit	c
diffrent	i
.	c

We	i
were	i
thinking	i
is	i
so	i
many	i
other	i
activites	i
to	i
relax	i
and	i
enjoy	i
ourself	i
then	i
sunbathing	i
on	i
the	i
beach	i
.	c

We	c
went	c
to	c
few	i
Exhibitions	i
,	c
night	i
clubs	i
,	c
restaurants	i
around	c
area	i
and	c
we	c
really	c
had	c
a	i
fun	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
end	c
,	c
the	c
weather	c
got	c
better	c
,	c
so	c
we	c
decided	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
beach	c
.	c

Everything	c
was	c
showing	i
,	i
today	c
was	c
going	c
to	c
be	c
a	c
good	c
,	c
sunny	c
day	c
.	c

I	c
look	i
around	c
and	c
I	c
relised	i
one	i
friend	c
of	c
mine	c
is	i
still	c
in	c
the	c
see	i
,	c
and	c
fighting	c
with	i
storm	i
,	c
trying	c
to	c
get	c
to	c
the	c
side	i
.	c

I	c
did	c
n't	c
think	c
just	i
went	c
to	i
save	c
my	c
friend	c
.	c

That	c
was	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
our	c
holiday	c
,	c
and	c
next	c
year	c
for	i
sure	i
we	i
wo	c
n't	c
be	c
going	c
to	c
the	c
see	i
side	i

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

To	c
begin	c
with	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
start	c
at	c
19:30	c
but	c
,	c
due	c
to	c
a	c
"	c
technical	c
problem	c
"	c
,	c
as	c
they	c
said	c
,	c
it	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
it	c
would	c
not	c
have	c
been	c
such	c
a	c
great	c
problem	c
if	c
the	c
show	c
on	i
the	i
proved	i
to	c
be	c
as	c
good	c
as	c
they	c
promised	c
but	c
it	c
really	c
was	c
not	c
worth	c
seeing	c
,	c
especially	c
because	c
the	c
first	i
actor	c
was	c
not	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
as	i
we	c
expected	c
but	i
an	c
unknown	c
,	c
clearly	c
an	c
inexperienced	c
young	c
actor	c
,	c
named	c
Tom	c
Douglas	c
.	c

What	c
is	c
more	c
,	c
there	c
were	c
no	c
discounts	c
available	c
for	i
the	c
ticket	c
fees	i
nor	c
we	i
had	i
the	c
opportunity	c
to	c
visit	c
the	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
,	c
as	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
for	c
mourning	c
reasons	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
not	c
satisfied	c
with	c
the	c
service	c
we	c
received	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
therefore	c
writing	c
for	i
a	c
full	c
refund	c
and	c
I	c
expect	c
to	c
receive	c
by	i
post	i
a	i
cheque	i
for	c
Â£	c
20	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

In	c
the	c
21st	c
century	c
,	c
people	c
will	c
all	c
the	c
wearing	c
the	c
same	c
clothes	c
,	c
the	c
same	c
shoes	c
,	c
they	c
will	c
be	c
buying	c
the	c
same	c
accessories	c
.	c

We	c
'll	c
get	c
out	i
in	c
the	c
morning	c
and	c
find	c
out	i
that	c
our	c
neighbour	c
wears	c
our	i
same	c
jacket	c
and	c
he	c
's	c
boasting	c
about	c
a	c
pair	c
of	c
shoes	c
which	c
are	c
too	c
similar	c
to	c
ours	c
.	c

The	c
thing	c
is	c
we	c
are	c
too	c
fashion	c
conscious	c
,	c
too	c
fussy	c
about	c
our	c
appearance	c
and	c
we	c
'll	c
end	c
up	c
forking	i
out	i
for	i
smart	c
clothes	c
only	c
because	c
the	c
people	c
next	c
door	c
are	c
doing	c
so	c
!	c
!	c

They	c
make	c
you	c
think	c
there	c
's	c
noting	c
left	c
to	c
do	c
but	c
to	c
surrender	c
and	c
do	c
what	c
you	c
've	c
been	c
told	c
to	c
,	c
like	c
blind	c
sheep	c
.	c

Anyway	c
,	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
really	c
mind	c
what	c
people	c
will	c
be	c
wearing	c
in	c
100	c
years	c
'	c
time	c
.	c

As	c
for	c
me	c
the	c
only	c
thing	c
I	c
care	c
for	i
in	c
the	c
morning	c
is	c
that	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
my	i
socks	i
mismatched	i

We	c
know	c
that	c
it	c
is	c
a	c
good	c
chance	c
for	c
us	c
to	c
learn	c
more	c
different	c
things	c
and	c
can	i
widen	c
our	c
knowledge	c
in	c
the	c
Science	c
Museum	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
I	c
know	c
that	c
most	c
of	c
the	c
students	c
have	c
already	c
visited	c
this	i
two	c
places	c
before	c
.	c

So	c
we	c
decide	i
to	c
choose	c
the	i
other	i
programme	i
which	i
have	i
seen	i
as	i
an	i
entertainment	i
.	c

It	c
is	c
the	c
LONDON	c
FASHION	c
AND	c
LEISURE	c
SHOW	c
.	c

The	c
date	c
is	c
on	i
Tuesday	c
March	c
14	c
,	c
from	c
10.00-19.00	c
.	c

It	c
shows	c
the	c
latest	c
fashions	c
including	i
leisure	c
and	c
sports	c
wear	c
.	c

In	c
spite	c
of	c
these	i
,	c
there	c
is	i
also	c
make	i
up	i
and	c
hairstyles	c
which	i
attract	i
girls	i
most	i
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
the	c
show	c
is	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
because	c
it	c
holds	i
only	i
1	c
day	c
which	i
is	c
Tuesday	c
March	c
14	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
worth	c
visiting	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
the	c
above	c
information	c
is	c
my	c
opinion	c
and	c
I	c
hope	c
you	c
can	c
accept	c
it	c
.	c

Thanks	c
for	c
your	c
kind	c
attention	c
.	c

Your	i
sincerely	c
,	c

For	c
me	c
,	c
I	c
think	c
people	c
's	c
home	i
may	c
not	c
be	c
built	c
on	c
the	c
ground	c
.	c

The	c
home	i
will	c
be	c
built	c
on	i
the	c
sky	c
-	c
so	c
as	c
to	c
save	c
more	c
land	c
to	c
build	c
the	c
other	c
buildings	c
.	c

As	c
the	c
home	i
is	i
built	c
on	i
the	c
sky	c
.	c

It	c
will	c
save	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
electricity	c
as	c
solar	c
energy	c
is	i
used	c
.	c

And	c
,	i
there	c
should	c
be	c
a	i
electrical	i
servant	c
in	c
everyone	c
's	c
home	c
.	c

So	c
there	i
's	i
no	c
need	c
for	c
people	c
to	c
do	c
the	c
household	i
work	i
.	c

There	c
should	i
be	c
no	c
beds	c
at	c
home	c
because	c
some	c
pills	c
are	i
invented	c
to	c
make	i
people	i
not	i
sleepy	c
.	c

If	c
you	c
're	c
tire	i
,	c
the	c
pill	c
can	c
give	c
you	c
vitamin	i
,	c
protein	i
and	c
make	c
you	c
refresh	i

For	i
electrical	c
goods	c
,	c
there	c
will	i
be	i
no	i
any	i
kind	c
of	c
electrical	c
products	i
except	c
computer	i
.	c

As	c
the	c
computer	c
is	c
being	i
as	i
a	c
multi-functional	c
products	i
.	c

on	i
the	c
other	c
hand	c
,	c
there	c
're	c
some	c
ways	i
that	c
remain	c
the	c
same	c
.	c

The	c
toilet	c
should	c
remain	c
the	c
same	c
as	c
people	c
need	c
to	c
use	c
daily	i
and	c
nothing	c
can	c
replace	c
it	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
!	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
apologise	c
you	i
for	c
my	c
controversary	i
opinnion	i
but	c
I	c
feel	c
really	c
disappointed	c
.	c

Firstly	c
I	i
would	c
like	c
to	c
explain	c
you	i
where	i
the	c
problem	c
is	c
.	c

I	c
came	c
to	c
London	c
for	c
a	c
short	c
journey	i
to	c
meet	c
new	c
poeple	i
and	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
meeting	i
with	i
an	i
English	c
culture	c
.	c

I	i
've	i
seen	c
your	c
advertisment	i
which	c
had	i
recommended	i
the	c
play	c
'	c
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
'	c
and	c
I	c
enjoyed	i
it	c
very	c
much	c
.	c

I	c
decided	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
with	c
hope	i
that	c
your	c
show	c
will	i
provide	c
me	c
all	i
these	c
emotions	c
that	c
I	c
have	i
been	c
looking	c
for	c
in	c
Great	c
Britain	c
.	c

Please	c
forgive	c
me	c
but	c
you	c
did	c
n't	c
do	c
your	c
best	c
.	c

There	c
was	c
a	c
change	c
of	i
the	c
leader-actor	i
what	i
annoyed	c
me	c
indeed	i
.	c

Waiting	c
was	c
horrible	c
.	c

On	i
the	c
advertisment	i
was	i
written	i
'	i
DISCOUNTS	i
AVAILABLE	i
'	i
shall	c
I	c
ask	c
you	c
one	c
question	c
?	c
-	c
Why	c
they	i
were	i
n't	i
available	c
?	c

Everybody	c
were	i
schocked	i
and	c
I	c
was	c
trying	c
to	c
keep	c
the	c
faith	c
.	c

I	c
didi	i
n't	i
expect	c
more	c
surprises	c
at	c
your	c
Theatre	c
.	c

Nevertheless	c
after	i
the	c
show	c
I	c
was	c
very	c
hungry	c
so	c
I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
restarrant	i
and	c
what	c
I	i
've	i
seen	i
?	c

A	c
poster	c
:	c
"	c
Closed	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
illness	c
of	c
the	c
chef.	c
"	c

There	c
were	c
some	c
more	c
disappointing	c
situations	c
about	c
which	c
I	c
do	c
n't	c
want	c
to	c
write	c
.	c

Eventually	i
-	c
you	c
offered	c
a	c
wonderflul	i
evening	c
but	c
I	c
must	c
say	c
that	c
if	c
I	c
had	c
known	c
that	c
it	c
is	i
going	i
to	c
be	c
like	c
that	c
I	c
would	c
n't	c
have	c
wasted	c
my	c
time	c
.	c

I	c
feel	c
honoured	i
to	c
write	c
this	c
letter	c
and	c
I	c
feel	c
the	c
oportunity	i
.	c

The	c
entrance	c
in	i
to	c
the	c
new	c
millennium	c
brought	c
us	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
changes	c
.	c

The	c
main	c
adventage	i
is	c
that	c
,	i
it	c
provides	c
you	c
all	i
the	c
informations	i
that	c
you	c
need	c
.	c

For	c
example	c
you	i
have	c
to	c
write	c
an	c
Essay	c
about	c
2-nd	i
world	c
war	c
.	c

Further	i
more	i
you	c
can	c
play	c
with	c
the	c
computer	c
,	c
and	c
unfortunetly	i
this	c
advantage	i
has	i
especially	i
changed	c
my	c
life	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
no	c
time	c
for	c
learning	c
and	c
for	c
domestic	c
works	i
.	c

On	c
the	c
other	c
hand	c
playing	i
games	c
and	c
using	c
a	c
computer	c
wide	i
my	c
brain	c
so	c
as	i
you	c
can	c
see	c
this	i
modern	c
staft	i
has	c
got	c
many	c
advantages	c
and	c
disadvantages	c
.	c

The	c
next	c
thing	c
that	c
has	c
changed	c
my	c
life	c
is	c
a	c
mobile	c
telephone	c
.	c

This	c
little	c
thing	c
brings	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
satisfaction	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
very	c
useful	c
either	i
.	c

I	c
have	c
got	c
a	c
steady	c
contact	i
with	c
my	c
parents	c
and	c
friends	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
no	c
problems	c
with	c
changing	c
the	c
time	c
of	c
meeting	i
because	c
I	c
can	c
always	c
phone	c
.	c

The	c
modern	c
technologies	c
brought	i
to	c
my	c
life	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
changes	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
even	c
seen	c
in	c
the	i
domestic	c
works	i
.	c

For	c
example	c
I	i
've	c
got	c
at	c
home	c
a	c
very	c
modern	c
and	c
special	c
machine	c
which	c
irons	c
hardly	i
itself	c
.	c

I	c
only	c
press	c
the	c
button	c
and	c
everything	c
is	c
going	i
alright	i
.	c

Dear	c
Ms	c
Clark	c
,	c

I	c
saw	c
the	c
advertisement	c
for	c
the	c
International	c
Arts	c
Festival	c
wich	i
is	c
a	c
great	c
idea	c
.	c

Do	c
n't	c
you	c
think	c
you	c
could	c
create	i
dramatic	i
courses	c
?	c

Finally	c
,	c
the	c
idea	c
of	c
a	c
reasonably-priced	c
weekend	c
ticket	c
for	c
all	c
events	c
is	c
excellent	c
because	c
we	c
pay	c
only	c
once	c
and	c
we	c
can	c
see	c
all	c
the	c
events	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
your	c
letter	c
which	c
I	c
've	c
just	c
received	c
.	c

You	c
ask	c
me	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
about	c
school	c
rules	c
and	c
what	c
we	c
are	c
allowed	c
to	c
do	c
at	c
home	c
in	c
France	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
think	c
the	c
rules	c
are	c
so	c
different	c
between	c
England	c
and	c
France	c
but	c
I	c
'm	c
going	c
to	c
try	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
examples	c
.	c

Furthermore	c
,	c
when	c
we	c
failed	i
an	c
exam	c
in	c
June	c
,	c
we	c
can	c
have	i
it	c
in	c
September	c
.	c

And	c
we	c
must	c
n't	c
speak	c
during	c
the	i
lunch	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
's	c
not	c
a	c
good	c
thing	c
because	c
we	c
ca	c
n't	c
discuss	c
with	i
our	c
family	c
.	c

l	i
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

16.12.2000	c

I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
"	c
International	c
Arts	c
Festival	c
"	c
on	c
21-22	c
November	c
.	c

Firstly	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
congratualate	i
you	c
for	i
the	c
festival	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
great	c
idea	c
.	c

However	c
there	c
were	c
things	c
that	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
like	c
.	c

You	c
said	c
that	c
stars	c
and	c
artists	c
would	c
come	c
from	c
around	c
the	c
world	c
but	c
there	c
was	i
only	c
starts	i
from	c
six	c
major	c
countries	c
.	c

I	c
suggest	c
you	c
to	i
increase	i
this	c
number	c
for	c
the	i
next	c
year	c
.	c

By	i
this	c
way	c
we	c
can	c
meet	c
other	c
stars	c
and	c
artists	c
,	c
see	c
different	c
cultures	c
.	c

Another	c
thing	c
that	c
I	c
will	i
point	c
on	i
is	c
,	c
the	c
concert	c
halls	c
are	c
too	c
small	c
.	c

There	c
were	c
some	c
plays	c
and	c
films	c
.	c

Last	i
thing	c
that	c
I	c
will	c
say	c
is	c
"	c
one	c
reasonably-priced	c
weekend	c
ticket	c
"	c
.	i

It	i
was	c
very	i
good	c
idea	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
will	c
listen	c
my	i
suggestions	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
we	c
will	c
meet	c
next	c
year	c
in	i
the	c
festival	c
.	c

16.12.2000	c

Dear	c
Emily	c
,	c

I	c
have	c
a	c
suprise	i
for	c
you	c
.	c

May	i
be	i
we	c
can	c
meet	c
there	c
...	c

You	c
asked	c
some	c
questions	c
about	c
rules	i
in	c
school	c
and	c
homes	c
Let	i
me	c
answer	c
this	i
question	i
.	c

In	c
schools	c
we	c
are	c
n't	c
allowed	c
to	c
speak	c
in	c
classes	i
.	c

Also	c
we	c
must	c
go	c
to	c
school	c
by	i
our	c
uniforms	c
.	c

However	c
we	c
are	c
allowed	c
to	c
eat	c
,	i
drink	i
during	c
the	c
breaks	c
.	c

All	i
the	i
time	i
we	i
must	i
be	i
kind	i
to	i
our	i
friends	i
and	i
teachers	i
.	c

We	c
must	c
n't	c
forget	c
the	c
books	c
for	c
the	c
classes	c
.	c

These	c
are	c
the	c
rules	c
in	c
school	c
.	c

In	c
our	c
home	c
there	c
are	c
some	c
rules	c
too	c
!	c

I	c
must	c
be	c
in	i
home	c
untill	i
11pm	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
not	c
allowed	c
to	c
listen	c
high	i
volume	i
music	c
at	c
home	c
.	c

When	c
the	i
guests	c
come	c
to	c
our	c
home	c
,	c
I	c
must	c
be	c
clear	i
.	c

I	c
want	c
to	c
change	c
school	i
uniform	c
rule	c
so	c
everybody	c
can	c
wear	c
what	c
they	c
want	c
.	c

Other	i
rules	c
are	c
O.K.	c
I	c
want	c
to	c
hear	c
some	c
rules	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Next	c
time	c
write	c
the	c
letter	c
quick	i
!	c

I	c
do	c
n't	c
want	c
to	c
wait	c
another	c
2	c
months	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
waiting	c
for	c
your	c
next	c
letter	c
.	c

Take	c
care	c
and	c
be	c
careful	c
not	c
to	c
break	c
any	c
rules	c
.	c

Dear	c
Sir/Madam	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
complain	c
about	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
advertised	c
in	c
your	c
latest	c
leaflet	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
the	c
worst	c
performance	c
I	c
had	c
ever	c
seen	c
and	c
it	c
disappointed	c
me	c
very	c
much	c
.	c

It	i
was	c
not	c
true	c
because	c
the	c
audience	c
had	c
to	c
wait	c
until	c
20:15	c
.	c

Then	c
,	c
I	c
did	c
not	c
get	c
a	c
discount	c
and	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
buy	c
a	c
full-price	c
ticket	c
,	c
although	c
I	c
am	c
not	c
adult	i
yet	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
you	c
then	c
to	c
send	c
the	c
money	c
back	c
to	c
me	c
because	c
I	c
did	c
not	c
enjoy	c
the	c
show	c
at	c
all	c
and	c
the	c
ticket	c
costed	i
a	c
fortune	c
.	c

Yours	c
faithfully	c
,	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

She	c
heard	c
from	c
her	c
friend	c
Jon	c
that	c
Paul	c
,	c
the	c
worst	c
pupil	c
at	c
school	c
,	c
had	c
thrown	c
an	c
enormous	c
frog	c
inside	c
the	c
desk	c
of	c
Miss	c
Colston	c
,	c
their	c
English	c
teacher	c
.	c

Miss	c
Colston	c
was	c
an	c
old	c
woman	c
,	c
who	c
wanted	c
her	c
pupils	c
to	c
understand	c
and	c
admire	c
English	c
novels	c
and	c
poems	c
.	c

But	c
the	c
children	c
were	c
bored	c
during	c
her	c
lessons	c
and	c
Paul	c
was	c
very	c
disappointed	c
that	c
she	c
did	c
n't	c
read	c
any	c
funny	c
stories	c
.	c

So	c
he	c
decided	c
to	c
scare	c
the	c
old	c
woman	c
away	c
from	c
school	c
.	c

She	c
approached	c
the	c
desk	c
and	c
wanted	c
to	c
open	c
it	c
,	c
but	c
suddenly	c
Pat	c
shouted	c
-	c
"	c
Miss	c
Colston	c
,	c
please	c
,	c
do	c
n't	c
do	c
that	c
.	c

There	c
's	c
a	c
frog	c
"	c
.	c

The	c
teacher	c
stared	c
at	c
the	c
whole	c
class	c
and	c
calmly	c
whispered	c
-	c
"	c
Who	c
did	c
it	c
?	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
have	c
been	c
the	c
happiest	c
woman	c
since	c
I	c
have	i
got	i
your	c
letter	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
give	c
you	c
some	c
information	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
travel	c
on	c
19th	i
of	c
July	c
and	c
come	c
back	c
on	c
2nd	i
of	c
August	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
to	c
work	c
until	c
19th	c
of	c
July	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
actually	c
not	c
so	c
good	c
at	c
climbing	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
like	c
the	c
fear	c
of	c
risks	c
and	c
dangers	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
happy`	c
,	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
will	c
have	c
the	c
chance	c
to	c
do	c
this	i
two	c
activities	c
.	c

My	c
last	c
question	c
were	i
;	i
how	c
much	c
money	c
do	c
I	c
need	c
?	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

If	c
I	c
had	c
the	c
possibility	i
,	c
I	c
would	c
never	c
go	c
shopping	c
to	i
the	c
big	c
supermarkets	c
.	c

You	c
can	c
lose	c
your	c
way	c
if	c
you	c
do	c
not	c
follow	c
the	c
signs	c
,	c
or	c
you	c
can	i
not	i
find	c
the	c
items	c
what	i
you	c
want	c
to	c
buy	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
you	i
need	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
time	c
,	c
because	c
the	c
market	i
is	c
so	c
big	c
.	c

Lastly	c
,	c
there	c
is	c
a	c
recyling	i
problem	c
which	i
many	c
people	c
do	c
not	c
care	c
about	c
.	c

You	c
buy	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
items	c
without	c
thinking	c
where	c
should	i
go	i
so	i
much	i
rubbish	i
.	c

I	i
'd	i
prefer	c
to	c
go	c
the	i
markets	i
which	i
are	i
open	i
and	i
outside	i
.	c

So	i
you	i
can	c
ask	c
about	c
the	c
qualities	i
and	c
prices	c
and	c
get	c
immediately	i
your	i
answers	i
.	c

Dear	c
Sir	c
,	c

I	c
have	i
seen	i
a	c
musical	c
show	c
and	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
my	i
favourite	i
time	i
.	c

I	c
am	i
confusing	i
because	c
of	i
playing	i
different	c
actor	c
in	c
place	c
Danny	i
Brook	c
.	c

This	c
is	c
why	c
I	c
was	c
feeling	i
invited	i
to	c
your	c
restaurant	c
after	c
show	i
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
I	c
found	c
closed	c
doors	c
and	c
any	i
information	c
about	c
the	c
reason	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
add	c
that	c
being	i
a	c
student	c
I	i
find	c
discounts	c
very	c
important	c
for	c
my	c
budget	c
.	c

Neither	i
without	i
any	c
reason	c
it	i
was	i
not	c
available	c
.	c

Your	i
faithfull	i
,	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

This	c
was	c
the	c
reason	c
whe	i
we	c
were	c
horrible	i
troubles	i
with	c
police	i
.	c

What	c
is	c
more	c
,	c
our	c
friends	c
did	c
n't	c
want	c
to	c
talk	c
with	i
us	c
.	c

We	c
called	c
this	c
place	c
like	i
this	c
,	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
land	i
in	c
the	c
middle	c
of	c
our	c
lake	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
a	i
walking	c
with	c
my	c
friend	c
Pat	c
in	c
a	c
forest	c
when	c
we	c
discovered	c
a	i
gold	c
.	c

This	c
is	c
no	c
joke	c
!	c

There	c
was	c
a	c
secret	c
place	c
when	i
robber	i
keept	i
stolen	i
gold	i
from	c
bank	i
.	c

I	c
think	c
you	c
are	c
able	c
to	c
imagine	c
what	c
was	i
happen	i
later	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
,	c

Our	c
class	c
really	c
appreciate	c
for	i
preparing	c
this	c
programme	c
,	c
especially	c
for	i
Monday	c
's	c
atraction	i
.	c

We	c
are	c
extremaly	i
interested	c
in	c
wisiting	i
London	c
.	c

The	i
idea	i
of	i
sightseeing	i
by	c
bus	c
would	i
be	c
a	c
great	c
possibility	i
for	c
us	c
to	c
know	i
better	i
our	i
wonderful	i
capitol	i
.	c

Although	c
we	c
are	c
excited	c
about	c
the	c
scientic	i
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
you	i
to	i
ask	i
,	i
if	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
possible	c
to	c
change	c
our	c
schedule	c
a	c
little	c
bit	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
it	c
recommends	i
also	c
'	i
Leisure	c
and	c
Sports	c
Wear	c
'	c
.	c

Thing	i
which	c
attract	c
us	c
the	c
most	c
are	c
:	i
'	c
Make	i
up	i
'	c
and	c
'	c
Hairstyles	c
'	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
convinced	c
that	c
you	c
agree	i
with	c
us	c
and	c
we	c
take	i
part	i
in	i
this	c
show	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Nowedays	i
famous	c
people	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
an	c
easy	c
life	c
.	c

They	c
are	c
always	c
attacted	i
by	c
naughty	c
journalists	c
,	c
which	c
have	c
aspiration	i
to	c
earn	c
big	c
money	c
for	c
writing	c
an	c
extremaly	i
good	c
report	c
,	i
or	c
article	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
we	c
are	c
fascinated	c
in	i
their	c
marriage	i
,	c
children	c
,	c
holidays	c
etc.	c
What	c
is	c
more	c
it	c
was	c
their	c
own	c
choice	c
to	c
become	c
popular	c
and	c
well-known	i
.	c

By	i
chosing	i
this	c
style	c
of	c
life	c
they	c
should	c
realise	c
,	i
how	i
their	i
life	i
would	i
look	i
like	i
.	c

In	c
spite	c
of	c
being	c
incredibly	c
famous	c
,	c
they	c
might	c
feel	c
very	c
anxiously	i
and	c
lonely	c
.	c

Some	c
people	c
may	c
argue	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
think	c
,	i
that	c
politicions	i
and	c
films-stars	i
belong	c
to	c
the	c
public	c
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
I	c
belive	i
that	c
we	c
have	c
right	i
to	c
be	c
informed	c
about	c
their	c
life	i
,	c
providing	c
that	c
journalists	c
respect	c
some	c
important	c
rules	c
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
it	c
.	c

There	c
is	c
only	c
one	c
thing	c
that	c
we	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
change	c
,	c
if	c
you	c
would	c
n't	c
mind	c
.	c

So	c
we	c
'd	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
to	c
a	c
disco	c
and	c
this	c
fashion	c
show	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
great	c
opportunity	c
for	c
us	c
to	c
learn	c
something	c
about	c
styling	c
.	c

As	c
we	c
are	c
from	c
the	i
small	c
town	c
we	c
do	c
n't	c
have	c
any	c
possibility	i
to	c
learn	c
about	c
this	c
.	c

We	c
think	c
we	c
'll	c
find	i
one	c
free	c
hour	c
befor	i
the	c
River	c
trip	c
.	c

It	c
would	c
be	c
a	c
good	c
solution	c
.	c

In	c
every	c
country	c
there	c
are	c
the	i
famous	c
people	c
who	c
are	c
in	i
the	c
middle	i
of	c
the	i
public	c
attention	c
.	c

To	c
have	c
a	c
private	c
life	c
is	c
the	c
natural	c
desire	c
of	c
everyone	c
and	c
the	c
famous	c
film	c
stars	c
or	i
politicians	c
have	c
a	c
right	c
for	i
it	i
.	c

Otherwise	c
they	c
can	c
get	i
soul	i
problems	c
,	c
fall	i
in	i
deep	c
depressions	i
.	c

Mrs	c
Ryan	c
,	c

It	c
had	i
been	i
a	c
real	c
joy	c
to	c
receive	c
your	c
and	i
I	c
still	c
ca	c
n't	c
believe	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
start	c
my	c
first	c
job	c
on	c
August	c
1st	c
,	c
that	c
's	c
why	c
I	c
must	c
travel	c
on	i
July	c
.	c

I	c
ca	c
n't	c
change	c
anymore	i
the	c
date	c
of	i
umployment	i
because	c
I	c
signed	c
the	c
contract	c
a	c
month	c
ago	c
:	i
I	c
hope	c
it	i
will	c
not	c
make	i
problems	i
to	i
you	i
.	c

For	i
accomodation	i
,	c
I	c
would	c
prefer	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
,	i
it	i
would	c
be	c
better	c
to	c
let	i
money	c
or	c
anything	c
without	i
thinking	i
of	i
theft	c
.	c

When	c
I	c
saw	c
you	i
propose	i
this	c
sport	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
really	c
excited	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
choose	c
climbing	c
as	c
a	c
beginner	c
.	c

I	c
've	c
done	i
sailing	c
for	c
more	c
than	c
ten	c
years	c
and	c
I	c
really	c
enjoy	c
it	c
.	c

Moreover	c
I	c
was	i
sailing	i
teacher	c
on	i
summers	i
the	i
past	i
few	i
years	i
.	c

Thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c

G	c
Morin	c

Life	c
at	c
school	c
is	c
made	c
of	c
several	c
things	c
.	c

But	c
there	c
are	c
also	c
a	c
lots	i
of	c
clubs	c
and	c
activities	c
that	c
take	i
part	i
in	i
the	c
daily	c
life	c
of	c
pupils	c
.	c

That	c
's	c
why	c
they	c
both	c
have	c
to	c
be	c
taken	c
in	i
account	c
in	c
the	c
video	c
we	c
will	c
make	c
.	c

for	i
example	i
,	c
the	c
lessons	i
of	i
mechanics	i
or	i
physics	i
are	c
very	c
interesting	c
.	c

And	c
especially	c
the	c
practical	c
work	c
.	c

After	c
all	c
,	c
it	c
is	c
not	c
important	c
the	i
one	c
we	c
will	c
show	c
.	i

but	c
I	c
think	c
we	c
must	c
give	i
a	c
good	c
picture	c
of	c
the	c
school	c
with	i
sport	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
with	c
reference	c
to	c
the	c
trip	c
to	c
London	c
on	c
the	c
13th	c
,	c
14th	c
and	c
15th	c
March	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
the	c
good	i
programme	c
you	c
have	c
organised	c
for	c
my	c
class	c
.	c

We	c
are	c
especially	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
join	i
the	c
river	c
trip	c
to	c
Greenwich	c
and	c
the	i
sightseeing	c
by	c
bus	c
.	c

Secondly	c
,	c
I	c
have	c
seen	c
an	c
advertisement	c
in	c
the	c
times	i
about	c
the	c
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
.	c

My	c
class	c
and	c
I	c
are	c
all	c
interested	c
in	c
it	c
and	c
we	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
go	c
there	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
visit	i
.	c

It	c
will	c
be	c
great	i
opportunity	c
for	c
all	c
of	c
us	c
because	c
they	c
will	c
show	i
the	c
latest	c
fashion	c
,	c
the	i
leisure	c
and	c
sports	c
wear	c
,	c
the	i
make	i
up	i
and	c
the	i
different	c
hairstyles	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
will	c
take	c
my	c
proposal	c
in	i
favoreable	i
consideration	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

Now	c
I	c
will	c
tell	c
you	c
in	c
brief	c
what	i
exactly	i
happened	c
to	c
me	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
a	c
fantastic	c
sunny	c
day	c
of	i
August	c
and	c
my	c
friends	c
and	c
I	c
took	c
a	c
day	c
off	c
from	c
work	c
.	c

We	c
all	c
decided	c
to	i
go	i
to	c
have	c
a	c
day	c
by	c
the	c
seaside	c
not	c
far	c
away	c
from	c
Portsmouth	c
.	c

When	c
we	c
got	c
there	c
we	c
were	c
wearing	c
our	c
costumes	c
.	c

We	c
lied	i
on	c
the	c
sand	c
under	c
the	c
sun	c
,	c
we	c
had	c
funny	c
beach	c
volley	i
matches	c
,	c
interesting	c
chats	c
,	c
but	c
after	c
two	c
hours	c
there	c
,	c
my	c
friends	c
decided	c
to	c
go	c
swimming	c
.	c

I	c
did	c
n't	c
want	c
to	c
tell	c
them	c
because	c
I	c
was	c
sure	c
they	c
would	c
have	c
started	c
laughing	c
of	i
me	c
.	c

So	c
I	c
took	c
the	c
decision	c
to	c
go	c
and	c
join	c
them	c
also	i
if	i
I	c
knew	c
that	c
it	c
would	c
have	i
been	i
dangerous	c
for	i
my	i
life	i
.	c

In	c
the	c
end	c
fortunately	c
everything	c
went	c
well	c
as	c
I	c
did	c
n't	c
sink	c
in	c
the	c
sea	c
.	c

To	c
the	c
manager	c
of	c
The	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
!	c

I	c
have	c
to	c
say	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
very	c
disappointing	c
evening	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

It	c
should	c
start	i
at	c
19.30	c
and	c
it	c
had	i
at	c
20:15	c
!	c

But	c
the	c
worst	c
thing	c
in	i
"	c
London	c
's	c
newest	c
and	c
best	c
musical	c
show	c
"	c
,	c
as	c
you	c
called	c
it	c
,	c
was	c
the	c
abscentness	i
of	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
.	c

At	i
the	c
advertisement	c
,	c
there	i
was	c
written	c
"	c
your	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
"	c
.	c

Well	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
n't	c
perfect	c
!	c

I	c
want	c
you	c
to	c
give	c
me	c
back	c
my	c
money	c
,	i
I	c
hope	c
that	c
in	c
future	c
you	c
will	c
corect	i
all	c
this	i
mistakes	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	i

I	c
told	c
him	c
my	c
worst	c
love	c
story	c
.	c

I	c
looked	c
up	c
and	c
I	c
saw	c
her	c
,	c
standing	c
next	c
to	c
me	c
with	c
her	c
friend	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
constantly	c
seeing	c
her	c
but	c
my	c
shyness	c
made	c
my	c
mouth	c
close	c
so	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
say	c
anything	c
!	c

Few	i
days	c
later	c
someone	c
told	c
me	c
that	c
Sue	c
was	c
actually	c
a	c
boy	c
!	c

That	c
was	c
supposed	c
to	c
be	c
a	c
joke	c
from	c
my	c
"	c
coleagues	i
"	c
!	c

I	c
could	c
n't	c
speak	c
to	c
anyone	c
.	c

The	c
worst	c
thing	c
in	c
this	c
story	c
is	c
,	i
that	c
Pat	c
told	c
this	c
to	c
everyone	c
at	c
school	c
.	c

From	c
that	c
moment	c
I	c
live	i
alone	c
.	c

Thanks	c
to	c
Pat	c
.	c

I	c
enjoyied	i
it	c
and	c
here	c
are	c
some	c
feelings	i
and	c
advice	c
for	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
great	c
idea	c
to	c
put	c
together	c
different	c
countries	c
to	c
organise	c
this	c
Festival	i
.	c

However	c
,	c
there	c
were	c
only	c
artists	c
from	c
six	c
countries	c
,	c
not	c
as	i
written	c
in	c
your	c
add	i
.	c

Then	i
I	c
had	c
pleasure	i
listening	i
to	c
your	c
variety	c
of	c
concerts	c
.	c

You	c
certainly	c
saw	c
that	c
plays	i
and	c
films	c
had	c
a	c
lot	c
of	c
success	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
I	c
wanted	c
to	c
know	c
if	c
there	c
will	c
be	c
more	c
films	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

That	c
was	c
a	c
great	c
idea	c
to	c
have	c
just	c
one	c
ticket	c
for	c
all	c
events	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
want	c
you	i
to	c
make	c
a	c
suggestion	c
for	c
next	c
year	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

Mark	c
and	c
his	c
family	c
decided	c
to	c
go	c
for	c
a	c
walk	c
in	c
the	c
Alps	c
.	c

So	c
,	c
her	i
father	c
prepared	c
the	c
car	c
and	c
her	i
mother	c
took	c
some	c
food	c
for	c
the	c
journey	c
.	c

He	c
was	c
very	c
keen	c
on	c
going	c
in	i
the	c
mountains	c
.	c

Suddenly	c
,	c
the	c
father	c
stopped	c
and	c
said	c
:	c
"	c
Here	c
we	c
are	c
!	c
"	c

They	c
ate	c
with	c
the	c
owner	c
of	c
the	c
little	c
house	c
,	c
whose	c
name	c
was	c
John	c
.	c

It	c
was	c
very	c
quiet	c
because	c
they	c
were	c
in	c
nature	i
;	c
they	c
could	c
just	c
hear	c
cows	i
and	c
John	c
's	c
two	c
dogs	c
.	c

Mark	c
was	c
very	c
interested	c
in	c
building	c
small	c
things	c
with	c
John	c
.	c

He	c
was	c
able	c
to	c
make	c
different	c
objects	c
in	i
wood	c
.	c

After	c
that	c
,	c
marks	i
father	c
who	i
had	i
fluent	c
traditional	c
Swiss	c
language	c
spent	i
time	c
with	c
an	c
old	c
woman	c
he	c
had	c
just	c
met	c
near	c
the	c
house	c
.	c

After	c
eating	c
old	c
cheese	c
and	c
Swiss	c
chocolate	c
,	c
that	i
was	c
high	c
time	c
Mark	c
's	c
family	c
went	c
back	c
home	c
.	c

Mark	c
was	c
such	i
happy	c
but	c
very	c
exhausted	c
to	c
recognize	i
this	c
story	i
nevertheless	i
this	c
story	c
happened	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
ago	c
.	c

Dear	c
Ms	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

Thank	c
you	c
for	c
the	c
letter	c
.	c

It	c
sounds	c
great	c
.	c

Firstly	c
I	i
can	c
travel	c
only	c
in	c
July	c
because	c
I	c
'm	c
studying	c
at	c
college	c
until	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
June	c
and	c
in	c
August	c
I	c
'm	c
travelling	c
Greece	i
for	c
one	c
months	i
.	c

Secondly	c
I	i
would	c
like	c
to	c
stay	c
in	c
log	c
cabins	c
because	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
more	c
spacious	c
and	c
comfortable	c
than	c
tents	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
play	c
tennis	c
and	c
swim	c
.	c

I	c
sometimes	c
have	c
a	c
match	c
with	c
friends	c
.	c

I	c
like	c
swimming	c
because	c
I	c
can	c
relax	c
in	c
water	c
.	c

How	i
is	c
the	c
weather	c
like	c
in	c
California	c
?	c

Do	c
I	c
need	c
clothes	c
with	c
long	c
sleeves	c
?	c

How	c
much	c
money	c
should	c
I	c
bring	c
?	c

Can	c
I	c
change	c
money	c
for	i
US	c
dollars	c
there	c
?	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

Is	c
it	c
true	c
or	c
not	c
?	c

They	c
like	c
looking	c
for	c
fashionable	c
clothes	c
,	c
bags	c
,	c
shoes	c
and	c
so	c
on	c
.	c

It	c
is	c
very	c
boring	c
and	c
tiring	c
to	c
be	c
kept	c
waiting	c
.	c

For	c
the	c
women	c
,	c
too	c
.	c

Shopping	c
is	c
enjoyable	c
when	c
you	c
find	c
exactly	c
what	c
you	c
want	c
in	c
a	c
calm	c
shop	c
but	c
not	c
always	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
;	c

I	c
recieved	i
your	c
congratulations	i
letter	i
for	c
having	c
won	c
the	c
first	c
prize	c
in	c
your	c
competition	c
.	c

I	c
think	c
it	c
is	c
very	c
kind	c
of	c
yous	i
to	c
ask	c
me	c
what	c
my	c
preferences	c
are	c
for	i
the	c
trip	c
.	c

I	c
ought	c
to	c
let	c
you	c
know	c
that	c
I	c
can	c
only	c
travel	c
the	i
second	c
week	c
of	c
July	c
,	c
because	c
that	c
is	c
when	c
my	c
winter	c
holidays	c
starts	i
.	c

Answering	i
another	c
of	c
your	c
questions	c
,	c
I	c
am	c
more	c
likely	c
to	i
stay	c
in	c
a	c
log	c
cabin	c
considering	i
that	c
I	c
will	c
be	c
to	i
weeks	c
in	c
the	c
camp	c
.	c

They	c
are	c
much	c
more	c
confortable	i
than	c
tents	c
.	c

Looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

Dear	c
Kim	c
;	c
How	c
are	c
you	c
?	c

Anyways	c
,	c
do	c
you	c
remember	c
my	c
last	c
e-mail	c
,	c
where	c
I	c
told	c
you	c
that	c
I	c
was	c
going	c
to	c
help	c
at	c
a	c
Pop	c
Concert	c
.	c

Well	c
,	c
I	c
'm	c
going	c
to	c
tell	c
you	c
about	c
that	c
awesome	c
experience	c
.	c

I	c
asked	c
them	c
if	c
they	c
could	c
play	c
at	c
our	c
school	c
and	c
they	c
told	c
me	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
350	c
pounds	c
.	c

Appart	i
from	c
calling	c
them	c
,	c
I	c
also	c
helped	c
building	i
up	i
the	c
stage	c
,	c
and	c
took	c
care	c
of	c
the	c
lights	c
.	c

I	c
can	c
tell	c
you	c
that	c
it	c
was	c
a	c
wonderfull	i
experience	c
.	c

The	c
band	c
thanked	c
me	c
very	c
much	c
for	c
calling	c
them	c
and	c
having	c
everything	c
so	c
well	c
organized	c
.	c

I	c
hope	c
you	c
liked	c
reading	c
my	c
story	c
.	c

Hope	c
to	c
hear	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c
.	c

Love	c
,	c

my	c
disappointing	c
evening	c

spent	c
at	c
the	c
play	c
"	c
Over	c
The	c
Rainbow	c
"	c
presented	c
by	c
The	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
.	c

The	c
problems	c
started	c
at	c
the	c
beginning	c
.	c

In	c
addition	c
,	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
was	c
starring	c
instead	c
of	c
Danny	c
Brooks	c
and	c
this	c
was	c
the	c
most	c
disappointing	c
thing	c
that	c
evening	c
for	c
me	c
and	c
my	c
friends	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
told	c
to	i
be	i
able	c
to	c
get	c
discounts	c
,	c
however	c
,	c
I	c
could	c
not	c
get	c
any	c
.	c

I	c
also	c
went	c
to	c
your	c
theatre	c
restaurant	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
it	c
was	c
being	c
redecorated	c
.	c

For	c
all	c
the	c
reasons	c
I	c
have	c
mentioned	c
above	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
get	c
at	c
least	c
half	c
of	c

money	c
back	c

17/6/2000	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pam	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
,	c
and	c
this	c
made	c
her	c
lose	c
her	c
friends	c
,	c
her	c
job	c
and	c
everything	c
she	c
had	c
.	c

From	c
the	c
time	c
she	c
began	c
the	i
university	c
,	c
the	c
problems	c
began	c
.	c

She	c
was	c
telling	c
secrets	i
of	c
her	c
friends	c
to	c
the	c
others	c
.	c

Pam	c
was	c
sorry	c
but	c
there	c
was	c
nothing	c
she	c
could	c
do	c
about	c
this	c
.	c

One	c
day	c
,	c
she	c
again	c
told	c
the	c
secret	c
formula	c
or	i
a	c
production	i
to	c
a	c
friend	c
of	c
hers	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
this	c
friend	c
told	c
this	c
to	c
some	c
other	c
people	c
and	c
when	c
it	c
was	c
understood	c
that	c
Pam	c
was	c
guilty	c
,	c
she	c
was	c
fired	c
.	c

Life	c
and	i
harder	c
than	c
anytime	i
for	c
Pam	c
then	c
.	c

She	c
had	c
no	c
friends	c
.	c

Nobody	c
wanted	c
to	c
talk	c
to	c
her	c
either	c
.	c

One	c
day	c
,	c
she	c
moved	c
to	c
a	c
farm	c
and	c
nobody	c
has	c
heard	c
from	c
her	c
since	c
then	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
writing	c
to	c
explain	c
to	c
you	c
what	c
the	c
problems	c
were	c
at	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
"	c
Over	c
the	c
rainbow	c
"	c
at	c
your	c
theatre	c
.	c

On	c
the	c
announcement	i
foil	i
I	c
read	c
that	c
we	c
could	c
have	i
had	i
some	c
discounts	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
not	c
true	c
.	c

This	c
is	c
a	c
very	c
disappointing	c
thing	c
!	c

Then	c
your	i
theatre	i
restaurant	i
after	i
the	i
show	i
was	c
closed	c
because	c
the	c
staff	c
were	c
not	c
there	c
;	c
so	c
we	c
could	c
not	c
visit	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
expected	c
you	c
to	c
prepare	i
"	c
our	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
"	c
for	c
us	c
;	c
but	c
you	c
did	c
not	c
for	i
unknown	c
reasons	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Unfortunately	c
,	c
Pat	c
was	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

Kim	c
,	c
her	c
friend	c
,	c
used	c
to	c
go	c
camping	c
at	c
Sunset	c
Village	c
every	c
year	c
,	c
and	c
that	c
year	c
Kim	c
,	i
asked	c
Pat	c
to	c
come	c
with	c
her	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
evening	c
Pat	c
and	c
Kim	c
used	c
to	c
walk	c
along	c
the	c
beach	c
and	c
they	c
used	c
to	c
stop	c
and	c
turn	c
at	c
the	c
Main	c
Rock	c
,	c
a	c
very	c
big	c
rock	c
.	c

But	c
one	c
night	c
,	c
with	c
the	c
moon	i
light	i
,	c
they	c
felt	c
encouraged	c
to	c
continue	c
their	c
walk	c
.	c

Pat	c
was	c
a	c
little	c
bit	c
afraid	c
,	c
but	c
Kim	c
convinced	c
her	c
to	c
follow	c
her	c
saying	c
that	c
she	c
knew	c
the	c
street	c
.	c

But	c
,	c
when	c
they	c
heard	c
a	c
scream	c
,	c
they	c
stopped	c
and	c
,	c
when	c
they	c
saw	c
a	c
shadow	c
coming	c
forward	i
them	c
,	c
they	c
started	c
running	c
,	c
hearing	c
a	c
voice	c
saying	c
:	c
"	c
Our	c
secret	c
!	c
"	c

That	c
night	c
Kim	c
heard	c
another	c
scream	c
and	c
the	c
day	c
after	c
she	c
ran	c
to	c
Pat	c
to	c
tell	c
her	c
what	c
she	c
heard	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
a	c
tourist	c
and	c
I	c
had	c
a	c
week	c
's	c
holiday	c
in	c
London	c
a	i
few	i
time	c
ago	c
.	c

I	c
had	c
enjoied	i
to	c
see	c
the	c
musical	c
show	c
that	c
the	c
Circle	c
Theatre	c
presented	c
some	c
night	i
ago	c
;	c
and	c
the	c
actor	i
's	i
Danny	c
Brook	i
performance	c
.	c

I	c
went	c
to	c
the	c
theatre	c
at	c
19.30	c
o'clock	i
but	c
,	c
with	i
my	i
surprise	i
,	c
the	c
show	c
started	c
at	c
20:15	c
and	c
so	c
I	c
could	c
n't	c
remain	c
here	i
until	c
the	c
end	c
because	c
I	c
left	i
London	c
,	c
with	c
my	c
group	c
before	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

I	c
could	c
n't	c
have	c
all	c
the	c
things	c
I	c
expected	c
.	c

That	c
evening	c
was	c
terrible	c
for	c
me	c
and	c
for	c
my	c
friends	c
,	c
so	c
I	c
'm	c
not	c
satisfied	c
about	i
your	c
informations	i
and	c
I	c
ask	c
some	i
money	c
back	c
.	c

Your	i
Sincerely	c

Some	c
days	c
ago	c
,	c
when	c
the	i
school	c
was	c
ending	i
,	c
Pat	c
and	c
her	c
friends	c
decided	c
to	c
make	i
a	c
party	c
for	c
their	c
friend	c
,	c
Frances	c
,	c
because	c
the	c
end	c
of	c
the	c
school	c
and	i
the	i
Francis	c
's	c
birthday	c
were	c
the	i
same	c
day	c
.	c

That	c
might	i
be	i
a	c
secret	c
for	c
Francis	c
-	c
and	c
they	c
decided	c
the	i
program	i
and	c
the	c
present	c
,	c
a	c
new	c
gold	c
watch	c
.	c

Peter	c
and	c
Sue	c
asked	c
to	i
Francis	c
some	i
help	c
for	i
their	c
exam	i
's	i
subjets	i
and	c
Francis	c
,	c
for	i
to	i
help	i
them	i
,	i
was	i
very	i
busy	i
all	i
the	i
week	i
.	c

The	c
last	c
day	c
all	c
the	c
friends	c
went	c
to	c
Pat	c
's	c
home	c
with	c
food	c
,	c
musical	c
instruments	c
,	c
tape	i
recorder	c
.	c

Pat	c
was	c
very	c
excited	c
about	c
this	c
.	c

In	c
the	c
afternoon	c
she	c
had	c
phoned	c
at	i
a	i
Francis	c
's	c
mother	c
and	c
she	c
explained	i
her	c
the	c
secret	c
,	c
then	c
she	c
phoned	c
at	i
her	c
best	c
friend	c
and	c
she	c
speak	i
about	c
that	c
too	i
;	c
she	c
phoned	c
at	i
many	c
people	c
all	c
the	i
day	c
.	c

Now	c
many	i
people	c
knew	c
the	c
secret	c
but	c
Pat	c
said	i
everyone	c
:	c
"	c
I	c
tell	i
you	c
a	c
small	c
secret	c
,	c
but	c
you	i
do	i
n't	i
speak	c
,	i
please	c
!	c
"	c

Now	c
all	i
the	i
Pat	i
's	i
friend	i
do	i
n't	i
tell	c
her	c
about	c
their	c
secrets	c
because	c
Pat	c
is	c
n't	c
very	c
good	c
at	c
keeping	c
secrets	c
.	c

Dear	c
manager	c
,	c

The	c
advirtisement	i
I	c
had	c
read	c
did	c
not	c
match	i
the	c
performance	c
.	c

First	c
of	c
all	c
,	c
Danny	c
Brook	c
was	c
not	c
starring	c
and	c
was	c
replaced	c
by	c
a	c
different	c
actor	c
.	c

Moreover	c
,	c
I	c
was	c
unpleasantly	c
amazed	i
no	i
discounts	c
were	c
available	c
.	c

According	c
to	c
the	c
advertisement	c
,	c
I	c
could	c
visit	c
it	c
after	c
the	c
show	c
,	c
but	c
it	c
was	c
closed	c
because	c
of	c
the	c
lack	c
of	c
customers	c
.	c

My	c
"	c
perfect	c
evening	c
out	c
"	c
was	c
not	c
so	c
perfect	c
and	c
could	c
not	c
satisfy	c
me	c
in	c
any	c
way	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
soon	c

Yours	c

How	c
has	c
modern	c
technology	c
changed	c
my	c
daily	c
life	c
?	c

Modern	c
technology	c
has	c
variety	i
of	c
uses	c
and	c
its	c
possibilities	c
are	c
being	c
widened	c
more	c
and	c
more	c
.	c

Personally	c
I	c
feel	c
the	c
greatest	c
influence	c
from	i
the	i
side	i
of	i
personal	c
computers	c
.	c

With	c
the	c
help	c
of	c
"	i
Internet	c
"	c
it	c
is	c
possible	c
to	c
get	c
much	i
objective	c
and	c
useful	c
information	c
you	c
are	c
interested	c
in	c
.	c

Computers	c
take	c
the	i
major	c
part	c
of	c
my	c
free	c
time	c
and	c
this	c
is	c
the	i
reason	i
of	c
disagreements	c
between	c
me	c
and	c
my	c
parents	c
.	c

They	c
would	c
like	c
me	c
to	c
go	c
for	c
a	c
walk	c
more	c
often	c
or	c
to	c
help	c
them	c
in	c
their	c
daily	c
routine	i
.	c

I	c
am	c
completely	c
satisfied	c
with	c
the	c
way	c
I	c
spend	c
my	c
freetime	i
,	c
but	c
they	c
have	c
another	c
opinion	c
.	c

In	c
conclusion	c
,	c
modern	c
technology	c
affects	c
everybody	c
,	c
but	c
in	c
different	c
ways	c
.	c

The	c
only	c
effect	c
on	c
me	c
is	c
more	c
often	i
disagreements	c
with	c
my	c
parents	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mrs	c
Ryan	c
,	c

I	c
am	c
delighted	c
to	c
answer	i
you	i
back	i
to	c
give	c
you	c
more	c
informations	i
about	c
me	c
since	c
I	c
have	c
won	c
such	c
a	c
nice	c
price	i
.	c

As	c
I	c
have	c
already	c
planned	c
my	c
holiday	c
for	c
August	c
,	c
I	c
will	c
only	c
be	c
available	c
in	c
July	c
,	c
after	c
my	c
exams	c
.	c

It	c
would	c
be	c
nice	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
tent	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
been	c
camping	c
and	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
try	c
it	c
,	c
at	c
least	c
once	c
.	c

The	c
list	c
of	c
activities	c
that	c
you	c
have	c
is	c
very	c
interesting	c
so	c
my	c
choice	c
was	c
very	c
difficult	c
to	c
make	c
but	c
I	c
have	c
finally	c
decided	c
to	c
chose	i
sailing	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
been	c
sailing	c
for	c
five	c
years	c
now	c
and	c
enjoy	c
it	c
very	c
much	c
.	c

My	c
second	c
choice	c
is	c
climbing	c
because	c
I	c
have	c
never	c
climbed	c
and	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
have	c
a	c
go	c
at	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
do	c
not	c
have	c
any	c
idea	c
of	c
what	c
the	c
weather	c
is	c
like	c
and	c
what	c
kind	c
of	c
clothes	c
I	c
should	c
take	c
.	c

Also	c
,	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
know	c
if	c
it	c
is	c
better	c
to	c
exchange	c
my	c
money	c
in	c
England	c
or	c
in	c
the	c
USA	c
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c

What	c
you	c
expect	c
when	c
you	c
go	c
shopping	c
,	c
generally	c
with	c
a	c
friend	c
or	c
two	c
,	c
is	c
wandering	i
around	c
and	c
looking	i
at	c
everything	c
.	c

The	c
nightmare	c
starts	c
when	c
you	c
find	c
out	c
that	c
the	c
items	c
you	c
like	c
the	c
most	c
are	c
also	c
the	c
most	c
expensive	c
.	c

Then	c
,	c
you	c
decide	c
to	c
wait	c
for	c
the	c
savings	i
but	c
it	i
is	i
even	c
worse	c
as	c
everybody	c
want	i
to	c
do	c
their	c
shopping	c
at	c
that	c
time	c
and	c
the	c
streets	c
are	c
so	c
crowded	c
you	c
cannot	c
even	c
look	c
for	c
your	c
favourite	c
items	c
.	c

You	c
are	c
hot	c
in	c
the	c
shops	c
,	c
feel	c
annoyed	c
and	c
most	c
of	c
the	c
time	c
cannot	c
find	c
anything	c
you	c
wanted	i
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
,	c

Then	c
I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
explain	c
to	c
you	c
about	i
The	i
London	c
Fashion	c
and	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
.	c

Finally	c
how	i
the	c
programme	c
could	c
be	c
changed	c
.	c

The	c
London	c
Fashion	c
And	c
Leisure	c
Show	c
is	c
taking	c
place	c
in	c
Central	i
Exhibition	c
Hall	c
in	c
London	c
and	c
happens	i
on	c
Tuesday	c
March	c
14	c
.	c

From	c
ten	c
o'clock	c
in	c
the	c
morning	c
till	c
seven	c
o'clock	c
in	c
the	c
afternoon	i
.	c

I	c
suggest	c
that	c
we	c
should	c
transfer	i
our	c
visit	c
to	c
the	c
Science	c
Museum	c
on	i
Wednesday	c
afternoon	c
in	i
our	i
free	i
time	i
that	i
we	i
have	i
.	c

Yours	c
sincerely	c
,	c

It	c
was	c
dangerous	c
,	c
but	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
do	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
did	c
not	c
have	c
any	c
choice	c
since	c
my	c
brother	c
was	c
in	c
trouble	c
.	c

As	c
I	c
knew	c
the	c
teknics	i
to	c
break	c
in	i
a	c
place	c
without	c
being	c
noticed	c
,	c
I	c
should	c
not	c
be	i
afraid	c
but	c
tonight	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
steal	c
the	c
most	c
precious	c
diamond	c
in	c
the	c
country	c
which	i
was	c
very	c
well	c
secured	i
.	c

Then	c
I	c
approached	c
slowly	i
the	i
door	i
,	c
broke	c
the	c
lock	c
and	c
opened	c
the	c
door	c
.	c

However	c
,	c
my	c
adventure	c
was	c
not	c
over	c
yet	c
.	c

There	c
were	c
laisers	i
all	c
over	c
the	c
place	c
,	c
with	i
which	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
be	c
careful	c
with	i
.	c

Suddenly	c
something	c
went	c
wrong	c
,	i
the	i
alarm	c
was	c
making	c
noise	i
.	c

By	c
surprise	i
I	c
saw	c
a	c
car	c
waiting	c
for	c
me	c
outside	c
.	c

I	c
got	c
into	c
the	c
car	c
gave	i
the	c
jewelry	i
in	c
exchange	c
of	i
my	c
brother	c
,	c
took	c
him	c
and	c
left	c
the	c
place	c
.	c

Dear	c
Mr	c
Robertson	c
,	c

We	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
thank	c
you	c
for	c
the	c
programme	c
which	c
you	c
have	c
prepared	c
for	c
us	c
.	c

The	c
programme	c
contains	i
enjoyment	c
and	c
education	c
,	c
what	i
is	c
very	i
esencial	i
for	c
young	c
people	c
.	c

The	c
show	c
will	c
be	c
about	c
latest	i
fashions	c
,	c
leisure	c
and	c
sports	c
wear	c
,	c
make	i
up	i
and	c
hairstyles	c
.	c

In	c
our	c
opinion	c
,	c
we	c
should	c
go	c
to	c
the	c
show	c
.	c

Firstly	c
,	c
because	c
we	c
are	c
keen	c
on	c
fashion	c
.	c

We	c
have	c
already	c
orgonised	i
our	c
visit	c
new	i
programme	c
.	c

The	c
show	c
is	c
on	c
tuesday	i
and	c
we	c
could	c
go	c
to	c
see	c
the	c
show	c
in	c
the	c
afternoon	c
,	c
instead	c
of	c
shopping	i
.	c

We	c
are	c
looking	c
foraward	i
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

We	c
must	c
think	c
about	c
home	c
from	c
other	i
point	c
of	c
view	c
.	c

It	c
has	c
to	c
be	c
pleasure	i
to	c
be	c
there	c
for	c
us	c
.	c

What	c
we	c
really	c
need	c
in	c
the	c
next	c
millenium	i
is	c
love	c
,	c
that	c
is	c
what	c
will	c
keep	c
all	c
family	i
together	c
and	i
forever	c
.	c

Do	c
we	c
care	c
about	c
a	c
new	c
carpet	c
or	c
a	i
fashionable	c
furniture	c
?	c

No	c
;	i
I	c
do	c
not	c
think	c
so	c
.	c

Everything	c
will	c
be	c
faster	c
.	c

We	c
will	c
used	i
to	c
that	c
.	c

What	c
depends	c
on	c
us	c
,	c
is	c
how	i
atmospher	i
we	c
will	c
have	c
in	c
our	c
houses	c
.	c

The	c
home	c
of	c
the	c
Future	i
,	c
for	c
me	c
,	c
is	c
a	c
place	c
of	c
hapinest	i
.	c

Dear	c
Helen	c
Ryan	c
,	c

Moreover	c
,	c
it	c
would	c
be	c
more	c
exciting	c
for	c
me	c
.	c

It	c
could	c
be	c
nice	c
for	i
doing	i
two	c
activities	c
while	c
I	c
am	c
at	c
the	c
Camp	c
.	c

I	c
am	c
interested	c
in	c
sports	c
.	c

I	c
have	c
swimmed	i
since	c
I	c
was	c
in	c
primary	c
school	c
.	c

I	c
would	c
like	c
to	c
learn	c
playing	i
golf	c
at	c
the	c
Camp	c
.	c

I	c
look	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
sorry	c
that	c
I	c
have	c
n't	c
written	c
to	c
you	c
for	c
a	c
long	c
time	c
.	c

Finally	c
,	c
I	c
cleaned	c
the	c
stage	c
again	c
.	c

My	c
works	i
were	i
for	c
singers	i
,	c
so	c
I	c
could	c
meet	c
singers	c
and	c
talk	c
together	i
.	c

Do	c
you	c
know	c
"	c
Radio	c
Head	c
"	c
?	c

It	c
is	c
my	c
favourite	c
group	c
.	c

I	c
was	c
able	c
to	c
have	c
some	c
signatures	i
of	i
them	c
.	c

It	c
's	c
brilliant	c
,	c
is	c
n't	c
it	c
?	c

Especially	i
,	c
I	c
liked	c
cleaning	c
the	c
stage	c
,	c
because	c
I	c
could	c
stand	c
a	i
famouse	i
singer	c
's	c
stage	c
and	c
I	c
could	c
feel	c
his	c
enthusiasm	c
,	c
even	c
though	c
I	c
had	c
to	c
clean	c
it	c
.	c

I	c
'm	c
looking	c
forward	c
to	c
hearing	c
from	c
you	c
.	c

Best	c
wishes	c
